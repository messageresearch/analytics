[0:07] all right good morning okay
[0:11] second Peter chapter one
[0:13] and we're ready
[0:18] no I'm fine they can hear me from there
[0:20] yeah okay
[0:22] second Peter chapter one
[0:26] we've been talking on the Statue of
[0:28] perfect man this is number 14. uh
[0:31] brother Bob will be speaking here next
[0:33] Sunday and the next but we'll be in
[0:36] Canton Kansas we'll be in Oklahoma next
[0:39] weekend and throw the duck starts the
[0:41] next weekend Lord willing so for the mom
[0:45] to be taken over
[0:46] so what we're talking about for the
[0:48] visitors that are here today we've been
[0:50] talking on the Statue of perfect man and
[0:52] we've really tried to set a real
[0:56] um hard Foundation because the
[0:58] foundation is Faith all right and faith
[1:00] is a substance of things hope for the
[1:02] evidence of Things Not Seen and that
[1:04] we're going to get into that maybe a
[1:06] little bit today but um
[1:09] everybody
[1:19] so Sam is cheap
[1:22] salmon
[1:25] let's read Simon Peter are serving the
[1:28] possible Jesus Christ to them that have
[1:31] obtained so it's something that you
[1:33] obtain right we're going to do we've
[1:35] already been over this 13 times but for
[1:37] the ones that that have not been here
[1:39] maybe we'll kind of go through this
[1:41] today like we did before to them that
[1:43] have obtained so it's something you got
[1:45] to get it's a gift
[1:46] uh you shall receive the gift of the
[1:48] Holy Ghost so you got to have the Holy
[1:50] Ghost before you even know what to do
[1:51] with the word of God or what to do with
[1:54] these character
[1:56] virtues that we're going to talk about
[1:59] to them that have obtained light
[2:01] precious faith in other words they had
[2:03] to have the same faith
[2:05] as Peter had right right
[2:07] obtained like Precious faith not
[2:10] something different the same
[2:12] with us through now what was it it's
[2:15] through the righteousness what an
[2:17] entrance there's an entrance way been
[2:18] made through the righteousness of your
[2:21] own self and
[2:24] oh it says God
[2:26] did the righteousness of God so we have
[2:28] to look to him for our righteousness not
[2:30] our own right and our Savior Jesus
[2:33] Christ Grace and peace be multiplied
[2:34] unto you through the knowledge of God
[2:36] and Jesus our lord according as his
[2:38] Divine look how many times this word
[2:40] divine comes up in the scripture I love
[2:42] that word divine there's only one divine
[2:44] right and that's God all right there's
[2:47] nothing in this world Divine I don't
[2:49] care if you want to say the Divine
[2:50] whoever no the most Divine one is the
[2:53] Lord Jesus Christ so according as his
[2:55] divine power so him being Divine that's
[2:57] the only thing he can give is divine
[2:59] power all right hath given unto us all
[3:03] things that pertaineth unto what two
[3:04] things this is what struck me bro tell
[3:06] when we started this I had to back up
[3:08] and read this again because this is this
[3:12] has nothing to do
[3:16] the statue of a perfect man has nothing
[3:18] to do with your salvation
[3:26] not to get it
[3:29] after we're gonna read this after
[3:34] we're going to see in Ephesians it says
[3:35] after you have received
[3:37] after this
[3:40] but Peter's saying you got to get this
[3:42] divine nature first that's believe in
[3:44] the Lord Jesus Christ be baptized in the
[3:46] name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[3:47] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all
[3:49] right well then you become into these
[3:51] virtue and all the tempered faces
[3:52] godliness but they are a requirement for
[3:54] Christians to grow in God but you can
[3:58] you know Jonas is a baby
[4:00] Jonas is a Canada he was born into the
[4:03] family of Canada birth into the family
[4:07] in Canada
[4:08] but now if Rachel quits feeding him she
[4:12] just got finished now why she fed him
[4:14] because he needed nutrients to grow up
[4:16] if she quits feeding him or he decides
[4:19] he doesn't want any more to eat he just
[4:22] wants to eat junk food
[4:24] what happened he dies
[4:26] or he's malnourished and that's what a
[4:29] lot of Christians are they're
[4:30] malnourished they're Christians but
[4:32] they're malnourished they don't have
[4:34] these virtues working in their life all
[4:37] right so these things come after they're
[4:40] gifts they come because we're going to
[4:41] read right here
[4:43] because according to his divine power
[4:45] hath given unto us all things that
[4:48] pertaineth unto life
[4:49] because how you live your life and how
[4:51] Godly you are that's what the basis of
[4:54] the Statue of a perfect man is is your
[4:57] life that you live
[4:58] and the godliness that you live in the
[5:01] Life are the lack of all right everybody
[5:04] got that through the knowledge of him
[5:07] that have called us to glory and virtue
[5:10] a higher calling all right whereby our
[5:13] given
[5:14] so what is that gifts
[5:16] whereby are given unto us
[5:20] exceeding not just enough to get us by
[5:24] exceeding great and precious promises
[5:27] that by these what these promises the
[5:29] prophet said you might be partakers of
[5:32] the divine nature
[5:36] of God I'm only one divine nature all
[5:39] right having escaped the corruption that
[5:42] is in the world through lust
[5:45] period now watch he's starting a point
[5:49] and besides this
[5:52] read that
[5:54] and besides all this from verse 1 to
[5:56] verse
[5:58] 4
[6:00] and besides this he just walked us right
[6:03] through the New Birth the greatest thing
[6:04] has ever happened in your life right but
[6:06] besides this that's what I mean this has
[6:08] nothing to do with you getting the new
[6:10] birth but after you get the new birth
[6:12] these virtues are what's supposed to
[6:14] bring you up into the full stature of
[6:17] God we read that in Ephesians last week
[6:20] and besides this besides this
[6:24] giving all diligence
[6:27] that doesn't say dilatory that says
[6:29] diligence all right
[6:32] there's a big difference there
[6:35] because we got some people that come to
[6:37] a place and they become dilatory not
[6:39] know again all right
[6:42] and besides this giving all diligence
[6:45] add
[6:48] let me not add to the word of God but
[6:50] but let me read between the lines of the
[6:52] love letter here
[6:53] add to what you believe
[6:56] faith
[6:58] add to what you believe
[7:01] knowledge
[7:03] virtue knowledge add to what you believe
[7:05] because it is it's what you believe
[7:07] you some people can we're going to read
[7:09] it today some people can only believe so
[7:10] far
[7:12] but you got to start with having faith
[7:14] you got to be able to believe something
[7:15] all right and besides just giving all
[7:17] deals add to your faith it's yours not
[7:19] God's anymore it's yours after your
[7:22] faith versus
[7:24] Faith regardless God's brother Thomas
[7:27] brother Thomas charity
[7:29] now I love this scripture for if these
[7:31] things be on you
[7:34] oh it says in because a lot of people
[7:37] can be anointed y'all said I pour out my
[7:39] spirit upon All Flesh people can be
[7:42] anointed that's your power without
[7:43] character you can have power without
[7:46] character and be satanic but you can
[7:48] have power with these characters
[7:51] and brother Brown said that's fit to
[7:52] rule all right so we don't want to have
[7:54] these these power without cat powers
[7:56] without character all right for if these
[7:59] things be in you
[8:00] and here we go again with another
[8:03] another word that says be in you and
[8:07] abound
[8:09] that's heaping up overflowing
[8:13] I like that next part there they make
[8:15] you
[8:19] it puts you so much in tune with God
[8:22] that that these virtues make you that
[8:25] you shall neither be Barren nor
[8:27] unfruitful
[8:29] and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[8:30] Christ not the knowledge of a man not
[8:32] the knowledge of of mankind here or even
[8:34] the knowledge of just having a knowledge
[8:37] of the message because the knowledge of
[8:38] the message can kill you
[8:41] that's power without character all these
[8:44] people come up with this power of of you
[8:46] know Healing The Sick and casting out
[8:48] devils and with hey Jesus had power
[8:51] you just had power without character
[8:53] right right okay
[8:55] but now look at verse 9 but he that
[8:57] lacketh these things is blind
[9:01] gross darkness
[9:03] and cannot see it far off revelation
[9:07] and have forgotten
[9:11] that he was purged from his old sin see
[9:13] that you said well that's talking about
[9:15] Sinners I'm talking about Sinners that's
[9:18] not about Christian
[9:19] okay yeah you mean growth darkness and
[9:22] be a Christian yeah
[9:26] he preached a trinity and had a new
[9:28] birth there was some Darkness there
[9:30] somewhere
[9:31] and you and I are blinded by a lot of
[9:33] things a lot of people you know we
[9:35] sitting some of you set in trinitarian
[9:37] churches some of you sitting uh maybe
[9:40] something of the message that you came
[9:41] out of two Souls seventh under virtual
[9:43] that's that's gross Darkness but you
[9:45] came out of that because watch this
[9:48] and you cannot see it far off and have
[9:50] forgotten that you were purged from your
[9:52] old sins right
[9:54] wherefore the rather brethren Peter's
[9:57] continuing on wherefore the rather
[10:00] Brethren give diligence to make your
[10:02] calling and elections sure
[10:05] I love this next statement for if you do
[10:08] these things
[10:11] and brothers going to tell us in a few
[10:12] minutes that Paul uh Peter laid out a
[10:15] outline
[10:17] if these things be in the if you do
[10:20] these things ye shall never fall
[10:25] we see up and down Christians and all
[10:27] this stuff you know
[10:28] something's wrong something's wrong in
[10:30] their walk something's wrong and they're
[10:32] godliness it's because they're up and
[10:34] down because this is a promise
[10:36] that if you do these things you will
[10:38] never fall all right so I love that so
[10:42] what we've come down to we'll come down
[10:43] to a place to say well that's really
[10:45] good but where's it going to be well
[10:47] brother Brown says right here he says
[10:49] hey
[10:50] this is Stephen talking remembering uh
[10:53] he's in front of the Sanhedrin and he's
[10:55] going he's walking them through the
[10:57] Bible
[10:58] and he's telling him he said Stephen
[10:59] spoke of Solomon building a temple in
[11:01] the most high don't dwell in temples
[11:02] made with hands for the heaven is my
[11:04] Throne on Earth is my footstool and
[11:06] where is the place of my rash
[11:09] but a body
[11:11] has thou prepared me
[11:13] so it's in a body now it's not in a
[11:15] temple
[11:16] it's not in a shrine
[11:19] a body has now prepared me God dwells in
[11:22] the stature of a man that's not
[11:25] for these six foot tall or seven or you
[11:28] know God takes more in because of this
[11:30] one or
[11:31] you know it's the stature of a man
[11:33] reflecting himself into that being
[11:35] perfect worship God in us being his
[11:39] Tabernacle God manifesting
[11:43] oh how we could stay on that to you
[11:45] would almost suffocate in him from heat
[11:46] notice that God has always at all times
[11:48] reflected himself in man so don't be
[11:51] scared
[11:53] don't be scared that God's Gonna use a
[11:56] man
[11:57] to get something to you because like we
[11:59] read last Sunday Ephesians 4 says it's
[12:02] going to take Apostle prophets pastors
[12:04] teachers and evangelists to perfect you
[12:06] so you're gonna have to listen to them
[12:07] glean what you need from them to go up
[12:10] that statue of a perfect man it's not a
[12:11] one-man message you have to hear all the
[12:14] fivefold ministering to get perfected
[12:17] and that's what it says a stature of a
[12:19] perfect man
[12:21] and many have had questions about why
[12:23] when I got the Holy Ghost I got
[12:24] everything I need
[12:26] um
[12:27] yeah you do but remember you have flus
[12:30] in there and that Spirit around memory
[12:32] reason conscious fashion imagination
[12:33] right right God don't have imagination
[12:38] when God thinks something that happens
[12:40] right we imagine things you know no not
[12:43] see so that that middle round because
[12:45] remember the center realm is either
[12:47] Faith or doubt
[12:48] right you're either born again or not
[12:50] and it starts from that inside of the
[12:51] soul of man right but the outside man
[12:54] the memories and conseffects Imagination
[12:56] that's the spirit realm and that's not
[12:57] born again because how many of us
[13:00] remember what we did in the past right
[13:03] and it host us right
[13:04] we reason
[13:07] our conscience bothers us our affections
[13:10] and you know I was talking to somebody
[13:12] going down the road the other thing was
[13:13] talking about love love is just some
[13:15] word that's
[13:18] love is just a word we throw out there I
[13:20] love this poem
[13:22] do you if you define love
[13:26] oh I love to hunt well I love to fish
[13:28] well I love my wife we've just kind of
[13:30] put it all in the same
[13:32] rainbow yeah the only love that you can
[13:34] find is right here
[13:37] this is the godliness this is the love
[13:39] that you got to find right here this
[13:41] shows love so whatever this is
[13:44] that's what we got to look for not that
[13:46] I love to go to church or I love my
[13:48] pastor I love it no the only way you can
[13:49] love your pastor is to do what it says
[13:51] in the Bible and if he's with the word
[13:54] and the words behind him backing him up
[13:58] then are you really loving the pastor no
[14:00] you're loving the word but of course you
[14:03] can't separate the man from the message
[14:06] but that word love is so loose because
[14:09] that love at the top of the pyramid is
[14:10] not just like I love to go fishing or I
[14:12] love it no that's the epitome or the
[14:14] Apex of love
[14:16] that's where a man that's where a man
[14:18] came a God and came and died for you oh
[14:22] that's love
[14:24] and not just to do that for you
[14:27] he had enough in him to where he could
[14:30] take it and give it to you another man
[14:32] can't do that that's right that's why
[14:34] you know we we see these people saying
[14:36] Jesus died of man and the Holy Ghost
[14:38] left him in the garden and well if he
[14:40] did then he needs the Holy Ghost because
[14:42] it left him
[14:43] he he died when that Spirit left him
[14:46] that was the life that's come back into
[14:48] me and you he's the only one who can say
[14:50] I Lay My Life down and I pick it back up
[14:52] all right uh you and I there's never
[14:54] been another man ever been able to say
[14:56] that I'll lay my life down and I'm gonna
[14:57] pick it right back up right he's the
[14:59] only one so we believe that Jesus Christ
[15:02] is the the Apex of love that is the love
[15:05] of God so we have to see the character
[15:07] of Jesus
[15:09] in our life we look at it in the Bible
[15:12] and we we reflect it and we say okay we
[15:15] have the spirit of God
[15:18] because we reflect what's in the Bible
[15:21] all right so now we see that
[15:25] brother Brown says we notice here he
[15:27] said first we have faith virtue
[15:28] knowledge temper patience godliness or
[15:30] godliness and brotherly love all right
[15:31] brotherly kindness then add love let me
[15:33] read this all over again so be sure to
[15:35] get it now we go through the fifth verse
[15:37] I want brother Brown to read it for you
[15:40] and besides this giving all dealers add
[15:42] to your faith version the verse of
[15:43] knowledge knowledge Temperance patience
[15:46] patience godliness godliness brotherly
[15:48] kindness brotherly kindness charity
[15:49] which is love if these things be in you
[15:51] and abound they make you that you shall
[15:53] need to be buried or fruitful and
[15:54] knowledgeable Lord Jesus Christ look
[15:56] what brother Ryan said right after that
[15:57] now Peter is outlining something here
[15:59] for us then how to get there we never
[16:03] knew how to get there
[16:06] all right even Peter writing it in the
[16:09] Bible and it's been in here for almost 2
[16:11] 000 years no land has ever been able to
[16:13] put it together like brother Brown did
[16:15] God did through William Branham show us
[16:17] the chart put everything together and
[16:19] say this is now brother Brown said now
[16:22] Peter's give us an outline now what I'm
[16:24] going to do is and I'm going to bring
[16:25] that outline and I'm going to tell you
[16:26] how
[16:27] for you to get there all right and you
[16:30] got to remember one thing like we went
[16:31] back to the to the statement when you
[16:33] get the Holy Ghost you get everything
[16:34] you need that's true
[16:36] but remember shippers sister Shepard's
[16:39] dream we went through that already but
[16:41] I'm doing it for the for the ones that
[16:43] are here today it's just your shepherd's
[16:45] dream
[16:46] what was coming out of that box trash
[16:52] so he after you're born again you still
[16:54] got trash
[16:56] you still got trash we wouldn't need
[17:00] these virtues if we didn't right we
[17:02] wouldn't need a profit to come and tell
[17:03] us exactly how to go through them if we
[17:06] didn't have trash
[17:08] what it was remember he was pouring the
[17:10] pure water in trash was flowing out
[17:13] but then when he sealed that box with
[17:15] honey in other words all the trash got
[17:16] out he sealed that box with honey which
[17:19] he said that was love or the epitome up
[17:22] there of the Holy Spirit not two
[17:24] different Holy Ghost but two different
[17:26] fillings all right
[17:28] statue of a perfect man brother I'm
[17:30] saying I want to say this that there are
[17:32] some people who have a portion of this
[17:33] virtue knowledge Temperance lives in
[17:35] patients and so forth that don't even
[17:36] profess to be Christians
[17:38] now we're just teaching Sunday school
[17:40] and that's true that some people have a
[17:41] portion of this that don't even pretend
[17:43] to be a Christian but that doesn't that
[17:45] won't do it it's like a black bird
[17:48] trying to put a peacock feathers in his
[17:50] wings in other words what is he saying
[17:52] he only disgraces himself
[17:55] oh
[17:56] be better to stay a blackbird anybody
[17:59] says when he tries to exercise these
[18:02] things without being a Christian he's
[18:03] just simply all out of place
[18:06] you know as well as I do you've seen
[18:08] people come in they've they profess
[18:10] Christianity and they've they Mandy just
[18:13] like Daddy said a candle burning at both
[18:15] ends and this is the greatest thing
[18:16] since sliced bread and what three months
[18:18] later
[18:20] they're gone right
[18:22] why
[18:23] they got a part of this they got the
[18:26] anointing of this message
[18:28] they got an anointing on them not in
[18:30] them right they got an anointing on them
[18:33] Judas had an anointing on him to preach
[18:35] the gospel heal the sick cast out devil
[18:37] but remember on the day of Pentecost he
[18:39] didn't make it to Pentecost because if
[18:41] he would have made the Pentecost he
[18:42] would have been okay because he had the
[18:44] word plant in his heart
[18:46] but it was never quickened because he
[18:48] cut it off
[18:49] we believe in predestination right right
[18:51] well we believe that we pray we trigger
[18:53] our predestination by what we do God
[18:55] knew what we would do from the
[18:56] foundation of the world all right but
[18:59] see says he's just simply all out of
[19:01] place it's like a sycamore tree time to
[19:03] manufacture apples
[19:04] it won't it can't do it
[19:07] like a mule trying to manufacture world
[19:09] trying to be a sheep when he's a mule
[19:13] it's going down here well
[19:15] now that's the way it is trying to
[19:17] manufacture Christianity you can't do it
[19:19] first thing you got to do is be born
[19:22] again
[19:23] all right brother Dale's been preaching
[19:24] on that for a while at it uh you know in
[19:27] marriage and divorce about being born
[19:28] again you got to be changed
[19:31] and when you're changed you become a new
[19:34] creation
[19:35] now you're getting right now
[19:38] see you're in the you're in the row
[19:40] you're on the road to get there all
[19:42] right you're not off in the woods
[19:43] somewhere at least you're on the right
[19:44] Highway
[19:47] now see you don't have to worry about
[19:50] the feathers
[19:51] it'll take care of itself when you're
[19:53] born again
[19:54] in other words
[19:56] you know the the peacock doesn't have to
[19:58] get up every morning and and and go over
[20:01] the corner and say no I gotta make
[20:02] feathers I got to make feathers I got no
[20:04] he just become a peacock
[20:06] and becoming a peacock automatically
[20:08] that's right makes feathers all right
[20:11] and he's talking about putting a tuxedo
[20:13] suit on a on a pig all right
[20:19] I'm not gonna say anything about that
[20:22] notice you must be born again and when
[20:24] you're born again you can't be born
[20:26] again without having faith so that puts
[20:28] you in the pyramid that big that's why I
[20:30] said you're gonna have a lot of faith
[20:31] that's why it's down at the bottom it's
[20:33] a foundation
[20:34] and you've got to believe in something
[20:37] you absolutely cannot see and has not
[20:40] have not seen in your life before
[20:44] right
[20:45] Jean's got her hand up she knows
[20:47] you gotta believe in something that
[20:49] you've never seen before
[20:51] how many people have seen Jesus Donald
[20:53] Trump
[20:56] it's just hearsay
[20:59] until you get a revelation that's my
[21:01] brother Dale said it's got to be a
[21:02] personal revelation Jesus Christ
[21:04] personally revealed to you that Jesus
[21:06] was an actual person he actually died
[21:08] and he didn't die for nobody else in the
[21:10] world but you
[21:12] what you gotta believe
[21:15] because he died for the whole world the
[21:17] Bible said he died for all
[21:19] but really he only had a certain group
[21:22] in his mind which was his children right
[21:25] he went to die for his children the
[21:27] father went to die for his kids he
[21:28] didn't go to die for the devil's kid he
[21:31] went and died for his own kids all right
[21:32] so you got to realize though and come to
[21:35] a realization that you were born wrong
[21:36] and you need to be born again all right
[21:39] or born from above like brother they
[21:40] almost come about Wednesday night
[21:43] and when you're born again you can't be
[21:45] born again without having faith you
[21:46] can't just jump up and say I believe the
[21:48] message
[21:50] well the Bible says the devil believes
[21:52] in one God believe and one God
[21:55] entrembled and he feeds the world of
[21:58] Trinity and laughs at him Satan knows
[22:00] Chad there's only one God he knows who
[22:03] he is he was there with him he knows
[22:05] he's his creator he knows there ain't no
[22:08] three or four running around up there
[22:10] but he comes right down and perverts
[22:12] what God has and he makes three out of
[22:14] it and makes that thing come that's why
[22:16] I come from the pits of Hell Brothers
[22:18] around himself Holy Ghost comfortable
[22:19] bits of hell why come from Satan come
[22:22] from him he's one to come up with that
[22:23] idea
[22:24] you know it proves that the Bible has to
[22:27] be revealed that it's written in a way
[22:31] right that's right
[22:34] that's right
[22:38] well that you know you go back to
[22:40] everybody saying brother Brown was wrong
[22:42] here and doing all these things wrong
[22:43] wrong well Jesus said eat my flesh and
[22:45] drink my blood now he didn't stay two
[22:47] hours and explain that
[22:50] now what if I walked up here today
[22:53] a lot of people wouldn't know me from
[22:55] anybody walking a crowd and stand up and
[22:57] say You Must Eat My Flesh and drink my
[23:00] blood
[23:02] to be my children to enter into my
[23:04] kingdom
[23:05] now buddy you go away and of course we
[23:08] know who you know the 700 went away real
[23:10] quick
[23:11] right
[23:12] we'll have no part with me if you don't
[23:15] eat my flesh and drink my blood
[23:17] he didn't explain it but like I told
[23:19] y'all before when we were doing a
[23:21] communion
[23:21] he let Paul explain
[23:25] and Paul wasn't even there
[23:29] what almighty God Peter was there why
[23:33] didn't Peter explain
[23:34] when Jesus said this is my blood
[23:37] the New Testament in my blood drinking
[23:40] is often as you come together you know
[23:42] and remembers of me this is my body
[23:44] broken for you eat this I didn't Peter
[23:47] Peter didn't have that revelation
[23:49] Paul had to hire Revelation Paul could
[23:52] say I have received of the Lord
[23:55] because he had to he wasn't in the upper
[23:57] room he hadn't received it from God
[23:58] that's right then he talks about why
[24:01] Jesus said eat my black Wing you know
[24:03] what
[24:03] that was a long time for when Jesus said
[24:05] it to when Paul explained it long time
[24:08] so in other words God let him let the
[24:11] people steal over that for a little
[24:12] while and fight about it and just like
[24:14] the message fighting fuss about things
[24:16] brother Brown said but you got to read
[24:18] the level letter you got to read that
[24:19] level then yeah I just got back from
[24:21] California my daughter's a Catholic and
[24:23] they know the message that they just
[24:25] want and they believed that believe that
[24:28] you're either a body of Christ that's
[24:30] correct so they said if you know what
[24:32] they come in and just what I said
[24:34] okay good miss you my son good yeah
[24:37] there you go you have to have a blessing
[24:40] from anybody
[24:43] but you know what people think it's
[24:45] crazy yeah but the Catholics literally
[24:48] believed that that wafer when they place
[24:51] it on your tongue that that's the
[24:53] literal body of Jesus
[24:56] now
[25:01] I I just I ain't got no faith in that
[25:04] right no but you know what they do they
[25:07] have faith in that because if I don't
[25:11] take it like you said the priest
[25:12] probably said well this guy see you know
[25:14] you know he's he's out of here you have
[25:18] to go convention to be able to do that
[25:19] anyway and they're going to let you do
[25:21] that correct now sister Anna grew up
[25:23] Catholic so she knew sister Anna with an
[25:24] eight what I was saying is you know they
[25:27] truly believe that right sure
[25:31] where we should thank God for our
[25:34] relationship that's great
[25:37] because see that they probably live
[25:40] better lives than probably some of us do
[25:43] they probably go to church a lot more
[25:45] than some people did probably so
[25:47] but you know what they have a false
[25:50] faith
[25:53] brother brother Nelly said it Wednesday
[25:55] night brother Brown said false prophets
[25:57] bring false burden
[26:00] so you can birth you can beat birth
[26:02] false how many uh just to be playing
[26:05] you've seen false birth sisters and cows
[26:08] do it they have it looks like they're
[26:10] pregnant they act like they're pregnant
[26:11] but they're not well that's the same way
[26:13] with you and I
[26:15] you might look like you're a Christian
[26:16] act like a Christian but somewhere
[26:19] somewhere something's got to be produced
[26:21] right and when you don't produce
[26:23] something you know that you didn't get
[26:25] pregnant everybody understand what I'm
[26:27] talking about all right same way in
[26:28] Christianity
[26:30] so you see on my chart here I got the
[26:32] very Foundation
[26:34] faith is the foundation of it all for
[26:37] without faith it is impossible
[26:40] to please God
[26:42] he that cometh to God must believe that
[26:44] he is now brother I'm quoting scripture
[26:46] here
[26:47] without face impossible to please God he
[26:49] that cometh to God must believe that he
[26:51] is what is God and a rewarder of those
[26:55] that there's that word again not
[26:57] dilatory diligent
[27:00] diligently seek him
[27:02] seeing he must be
[27:04] and when you're a skeptic of the Bible
[27:05] when you're skeptic of the word being
[27:07] right you just might as well stay back
[27:10] until first you believe it
[27:13] all right
[27:14] because what is sin sin is unbelief
[27:16] there's only two elements that control
[27:18] the human being that's either doubt or
[27:19] faith one or the other because remember
[27:22] the five senses outside sea taste feel
[27:25] smelling here
[27:27] that's not that's controlled by the
[27:28] inside
[27:31] that's controlled by the inside you know
[27:32] I mean what you see
[27:34] is either Faith or doubt right
[27:37] with your natural eye too you're
[27:40] possessed of one that dominates your
[27:43] life just depends on how much Faith you
[27:45] have
[27:46] how high you can ride
[27:51] okay and you know what you got to do
[27:57] you couldn't get this
[27:59] listen to me you couldn't get this from
[28:02] James
[28:06] I said well James well yeah but Peter
[28:09] was the one to break it down
[28:12] and he had to have these virtues in
[28:14] order for those virtues to work
[28:17] and I made a statement the other night
[28:19] in preaching about
[28:21] um
[28:22] glorified again I took the little I took
[28:24] a little piece from from White brother
[28:26] um Aaron McGarry was preaching out there
[28:28] at the in Wichita a couple weeks ago
[28:32] you see that I glorified again
[28:35] well you got the Holy Ghost down here
[28:37] and then you got the Holy Ghost up here
[28:39] when you've got to start here
[28:42] before you can get that it's the same
[28:44] Holy Ghost
[28:46] but remember brother Brown said that
[28:47] Holy Ghost here is what moles everything
[28:50] together it solidifies your Christian
[28:53] Life and I told him the other night the
[28:56] Chad and it kind of shocked them a
[28:57] little bit but I said man that's all
[28:59] news
[29:01] that's old news
[29:03] Peter already told him two thousand
[29:05] years ago how to do that
[29:08] so it should be old news to us
[29:12] brother Brown come to preach the seal
[29:14] and right on up into the heights of the
[29:16] message he didn't come to preach this
[29:18] That Never Was preached no that was
[29:20] Priest it just was it was just
[29:22] suppressed or moved over into false
[29:24] Doctrine or this was added and that was
[29:26] added brother Brown come to what restore
[29:30] behold I send you a line to the prophet
[29:32] turn the hearts and father to the
[29:34] children the children children to the
[29:35] father what father pray for the fathers
[29:37] right here Paul Peter and all them were
[29:39] standing right here
[29:42] when the Holy Ghost came on them they
[29:44] were at the faith of the fathers they
[29:46] had these things working Peter said
[29:48] Silver and Gold Have I None
[29:50] but such as I have
[29:55] unto thee
[29:57] now does that happen to you and I
[30:01] people in the book of Acts you walk by
[30:04] and they so believed in that Christian
[30:07] Life that those people were living that
[30:09] they literally were healed by the shadow
[30:11] not even a word spoken those people just
[30:14] what that's virtue
[30:16] that strength coming from those people
[30:21] come on that's what we gotta have where
[30:23] it's Gotta abound so that God can reveal
[30:27] the seals to us and he can reveal the
[30:29] the things of God the Deep things of God
[30:33] why brother Brown preach them if we
[30:35] didn't need them
[30:37] he just need to fill tape up or what no
[30:41] he come to bring a message and his
[30:43] message started in 1963 we know that
[30:45] that had never been preached before life
[30:47] had never shined on that from what he
[30:49] preached from 63 on up but if you don't
[30:51] get 47 to 63
[30:54] you're not going to understand you got
[30:55] to have that great Foundation of faith
[30:58] to get us back to this park to where we
[31:02] can be a living moving breathing
[31:04] instrumentality of God
[31:15] God told Peter whatever you bind on
[31:18] Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you
[31:20] loose on Earth or what did Peter do he
[31:22] loose those virtues
[31:23] in second Peter he stood up and preached
[31:25] a sermon and God said okay
[31:28] now
[31:30] you explained it
[31:32] teach other people how to do it because
[31:34] you can't teach somebody something you
[31:35] don't have that's right you cannot do it
[31:37] you cannot teach somebody something that
[31:39] you have not experienced I mean I've
[31:41] never been in New York I've seen pretty
[31:42] pictures and I I can probably could
[31:46] stand in maybe an hour or two in the
[31:48] city that's about it my sister Johnny
[31:50] lived there it become part of her
[31:52] because she could navigate that place
[31:54] with her eyes closed why she's been
[31:56] there she experienced it for so many
[31:58] years she knows all the ins and outs and
[32:00] that's why God is why do you think God's
[32:02] Gift let us go this long
[32:03] what
[32:04] because he wants us to experience more
[32:06] of him he wants us to not just have
[32:08] faith and say well that's it I got the
[32:10] Holy Ghost
[32:12] no he wants he wants you to be to wear
[32:15] if you walk into a room and a baby sit
[32:20] and uh because see that's what Peter was
[32:22] saying Peter was saying I don't have
[32:24] enough money
[32:25] silver and gold I don't have enough
[32:27] money I I if you're sick if I got some
[32:30] money you know what we living allow to
[32:31] see him we can go down to CVS and get us
[32:34] something for a headache or two things
[32:36] or we can send you to the doctor if you
[32:38] don't have enough money we'll get you
[32:39] some money but you know what Peter said
[32:41] Peter said I ain't got enough money to
[32:43] go take you to a doctor
[32:44] but stretches I have
[32:47] he didn't reach in his back pocket for
[32:49] that
[32:50] he just spoke the word such as I have
[32:53] rise up and walk
[32:56] that's all it was but first it's got to
[32:58] be Faith let me stay on that foundation
[32:59] for a while now Faith Is What You Must
[33:01] Believe faith is what faith is the
[33:03] substance of things hoped for it's you
[33:05] already have it when you have faith
[33:07] because it's revealed in faith faith is
[33:10] the substance things hoped for Hebrews
[33:11] 11 see the evidence what is it what kind
[33:13] of an Evidence
[33:15] a holy evidence I like that
[33:21] let's keep on going one more right down
[33:23] here
[33:26] he's talking about speaking the word now
[33:27] Faith does the rest of it Faith does the
[33:29] rest so you must have faith for a
[33:31] foundation all Christianity all you are
[33:33] all that you you'll ever be is based on
[33:36] faith in the word that's the reason I
[33:37] believe the word now look he says first
[33:40] you must be born again and then when
[33:41] you're born again you have faith you
[33:44] believe the word until you're born again
[33:45] you'll argue against it
[33:48] if you're just religiously inclined and
[33:50] you got a little human knowledge
[33:52] that you should do right you'll never be
[33:55] able to agree upon the word of God
[33:58] somewhere you're gonna fall off you'll
[34:00] never do it you've got to be born again
[34:02] and born again it produces faith
[34:05] all right then after you get Faith
[34:07] that's right here faith faith then
[34:10] you're just in position
[34:13] of growing
[34:15] now that's the prophet that's good
[34:17] you're just in position
[34:19] of growing yeah I like that quote I I
[34:21] found out this morning that's why I
[34:23] colored it in yellow
[34:24] actually I was showing brother Tom how
[34:26] to do it and I just left it in y'all
[34:28] but I like red but I put that in yellow
[34:30] for him so he could underline some of
[34:32] his quotes like that or highlight some
[34:34] of this book but then you're just in
[34:36] position oh my you say oh I got the Holy
[34:38] Ghost I got everything brother Brown
[34:39] said you start right here you're just in
[34:41] position to grow
[34:43] what he said you're a baby you're a
[34:47] babbling acts 238 babbling baby
[34:50] makes a little mistake every once in a
[34:52] while you know Jonas We're Not Gonna
[34:54] We're Not Gonna I'm not gonna now if
[34:57] y'all fall asleep I may say something
[34:59] but he's a few months old he's late he
[35:02] needs to I'm so you know so does uh
[35:05] Harmony over there but you know what one
[35:07] of you fell asleep she'd be different
[35:08] because what you're grown up I'll expect
[35:10] more from you than I will from a little
[35:12] baby God expects more from a grown-up
[35:14] than he does a little baby everything I
[35:17] see now that you see in development of
[35:18] life even in teenage years
[35:21] God understands those things God knows
[35:23] and that's the growth development you
[35:24] have baby you have baby time in your new
[35:26] birth you have a teenage time and then
[35:28] you birth you have an adult how many and
[35:31] you burn right so it's something that's
[35:33] a growth development you know why that's
[35:35] the only way we can understand it
[35:38] try to understand God any other way
[35:40] can't do it all right let's go
[35:44] Lord bless you see in a couple weeks
