[15:31] fellowship around brothers and sisters
[15:34] with precious and light faith that we

[15:39] them hard every day in our lives as
[15:41] times are drawing near and things seem
[15:45] to jump in our way and always jumping up
[15:48] in front of us but sometimes the
[15:50] standing note is what we need to do as
[15:53] Christians for me is so task out there
[15:56] in the world dealing with things and
[15:58] it's always something so thank God for
[16:01] the word that he sent it to heedless and
[16:02] delivers from our own destruction and

[16:23] the word that comes to this little
[16:24] church here father to bless these Souls
[16:27] Lord that need it and hear it because

[16:32] wasn't somebody to listen and take it in
[16:34] thank you Father for that because I know

[16:47] know how to use them and what they're
[16:49] for and father I ask today that you

[17:11] cave and couldn't even keep him bound
[17:13] first thing he said was why have you
[17:16] come to harm us he just told him to go
[17:18] and jump in the swine and the swine went
[17:21] and jumped into the ocean there was no
[17:23] way with Lord you gave us the power of
[17:26] your word

[32:01] relations for will try to read the first
[32:05] seven verses and then get into our
[32:08] thought anything else that we've missed
[32:12] always we had a real good time yesterday
[32:15] at the festival time and all like that
[32:19] and it was really good it would rain a
[32:21] while and look like it was gonna rain
[32:23] and then it quit and then it rain and
[32:26] quit and we were going up and down with
[32:27] wondering whether to have the the the
[32:29] little cookout things you know where the
[32:31] kids could do so we decided not to have
[32:33] that because you get started and the
[32:35] windup you know started raining and all
[32:39] like that but we had a good time our
[32:40] thoroughly enjoyed it and I just want to
[32:42] give a clapping hand to all of those
[32:45] that helped to do it put on the things
[32:49] and do your games and all for the
[32:51] children I know the children they
[32:54] appreciate that because we had a good
[32:55] time and that I even got to do the nanny
[32:58] couldn't do her part yesterday so I got
[33:00] to I got to have her part and we were
[33:03] fishing for little duckies you know and
[33:06] I happened to admit they told me that I
[33:08] couldn't cheat you know because they
[33:10] always tell you I'd always give too many
[33:13] you know little cards back to everybody
[33:16] you know and all like that and they they
[33:18] said now fall fall that's cheating so
[33:20] you know you don't do that this time
[33:22] we're gonna have a coin and I you know
[33:24] and everything has to match so they got
[33:26] that I still got mine cuz I'd help them
[33:28] hook those okay I'm still a kid that's
[33:34] just the way it goes amen
[33:35] license for one through seven
[33:43] now say that the air as long as he's a
[33:46] child differed nothing from a servant
[33:49] though he be Lord of all but his under
[33:52] tutors and governors until the time
[33:54] appointed of the Father even so we when
[33:58] we were children were in bondage under
[34:01] the elements of the world in other words
[34:02] we were lost
[34:03] needing redemption right okay but when
[34:07] the fullness of time was come God sent
[34:09] forth his son made of a woman made under
[34:13] the law to what to redeem them that were
[34:15] under the law that we might receive the
[34:18] adoption of sons and because your sons
[34:22] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[34:25] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[34:28] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[34:32] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[34:35] through Christ our Lord amen you may be
[34:39] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[34:42] reading of the word and we've trying to
[34:47] bring forth we preached on that last
[34:50] weekend in trying to talk about adoption
[34:56] we're in the day and time when that is a
[34:58] big word to be used because there's a
[35:01] lot of it going on you know and we found
[35:04] out a lot of things through adoption and
[35:07] stuff like that that really is it's
[35:09] glorious to help us and the way the the
[35:13] things go on of a natural adoption and
[35:16] all and we learned off for one thing
[35:18] that was something that in in you know
[35:21] you may try to disown one of your
[35:23] children disinherit or whatever you want
[35:26] to do but if you adopt a child you
[35:30] cannot disinherit that child that's the
[35:34] laws see because it's the way that they
[35:36] got everything set down and to do and
[35:39] it's really topping right but we're
[35:41] going right back into understanding all
[35:44] right now what were we talking about
[35:47] last week as we were trying to cover the
[35:52] adoption and bringing it forth that
[35:56] Paul here in Galatians is picking up
[36:00] from the Old Testament the laws of
[36:03] adoption and bringing it forth and man
[36:07] it's showing it and and you know showing
[36:11] us what to expect all right seeing the
[36:14] old law of adoption in the Old Testament
[36:16] they had would be a child born into the
[36:20] family well you know that child is a
[36:23] member of that family sort of born into
[36:26] the family all right you know and it's
[36:28] part of the family with inheritance with
[36:31] all the rest and all but it's not an
[36:34] adopted child because they had to form
[36:38] back there that when they got on up to
[36:40] their time and I always missed that Bar
[36:42] Mitzvah you know his weight groups
[36:44] correcting me all the time that they try
[36:47] to say those words that a child a son
[36:49] back in the Old Testament when they
[36:51] become to a time of maturity
[36:54] unnecessarily age wise but maturity you
[36:58] know they were adopted into the family
[37:01] which put them to the position that they
[37:03] were able to as we call it today write a
[37:08] check you know you've given the
[37:10] authority to do all kinds of things and
[37:13] you know and he was placed at to the
[37:15] position to be able to run the farm or
[37:18] to do what was needful because he was a
[37:22] son positionally placed in adoption all
[37:26] right then in doing that it sets a stage
[37:30] back tire and I hope you followed my
[37:33] point and I'll repeat it a couple of
[37:36] times that remember in the Old Testament
[37:37] now you can only deal with the point
[37:40] that you brought into the family as a
[37:43] child you're born into the family all
[37:46] right
[37:46] then you've got the second stage which
[37:49] comes into the stage of the adoption or
[37:52] authority of that child in the family
[37:56] all right now and then doing that then
[38:01] see it cuts off because there's nothing
[38:03] else to give examples with you know you
[38:07] don't have the things the
[38:09] you need to go but you have enough to
[38:11] type up to that point
[38:13] so Paul see he could take that and he
[38:16] could look back in Chapter three and
[38:19] fourth hour of Galatians and he could
[38:22] see that a child coming into the family
[38:25] he even though he's an heir because he's
[38:28] born into the family
[38:29] he's an heir he's a child he he's a
[38:32] member of that family all right but yet
[38:35] he doesn't have the authority to do and
[38:39] all is doing and that's what the father
[38:41] wanted so when a son was born the father
[38:44] would you know after a while raise it up
[38:48] you know they would when they bring it
[38:50] up I don't know what age you would start
[38:52] it off but eventually he would be given
[38:54] a tutor it's mentioned there in the
[38:57] third and then over end of the fourth
[38:59] chapter a tutor or a governor someone to
[39:04] raise that child to teach that child and
[39:07] they would would would take over you
[39:09] know and that would be their tutor you
[39:11] can hire it today you can your children
[39:13] can be grades bad in different things
[39:16] you can hire a tutor to put in the
[39:19] position to try to teach that child you
[39:21] know to upgrade it and see back then the
[39:24] father wanted to be able to his son to
[39:29] come into maturity so he would hire a
[39:32] tutor
[39:33] well that tutor would be the the one
[39:36] that would teach that child
[39:38] well that tutor also had a position to
[39:42] her it would report that person would
[39:44] report to the father and say your son is
[39:48] not acting rotten your child is not
[39:53] acting correctly you know and then I
[39:56] guess they'd out to decide what took
[39:58] place and the doing could have never
[40:00] studied that much ever to see what they
[40:02] do but I do know one thing if that child
[40:05] never reached the maturity of the
[40:08] authority it would remain a child yes
[40:12] but it would not have the right of
[40:16] inheritance in the form of the heir as a
[40:19] son of a manifested son or daughter now
[40:23] we only use appalled in them users only
[40:26] to the men so I told you women now you
[40:28] just hold on you you're in there it's
[40:30] not leaving you out of it it's just an
[40:33] example form that it was done for the
[40:36] Sun in the Old Testament and things like
[40:39] that it was brought into being all right
[40:41] and as it would come forth that Sun
[40:45] would take on the nature now listen the
[40:53] Sun would be trying the father would
[40:55] want the his own nature instilled into
[40:58] his child but how would that nature be
[41:01] come into the child through the tutor so
[41:05] he wouldn't go out and hire the drunk
[41:07] next door to raise his child you know or
[41:10] this out of the other he he'd go out and
[41:12] get the person that was the closest to
[41:15] his nature his ways and his doings to
[41:19] her that he could put that child
[41:21] underneath that tutor or governor you
[41:24] know schoolmaster as Paul calls if
[41:28] they're in relations and they would then
[41:30] that child would come forward when it
[41:32] would come forth whose nature would be
[41:35] in the child you realize then the nature
[41:39] of the tutor would be instilled into the
[41:42] child just as much as the because that's
[41:45] the only way that nature of the father
[41:46] could get into the child is to for that
[41:50] father to you know say okay now I want
[41:53] him raised this way well on it and when
[41:56] he would raise him see and my point is
[41:58] is what it comes forth in the New
[42:00] Testament and you hear the prophet in a
[42:02] minute to read to say that we had the
[42:04] greatest teacher of all placed on us we
[42:07] received a new birth by the baptism of
[42:09] the Holy Ghost were born again right
[42:11] into the family of God
[42:13] but then the tutors that is given to us
[42:16] there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:18] in a higher order our point to to to be
[42:22] a razor and you look at it as the same
[42:25] thing as we've been on the statue of
[42:27] perfect man for so long see faith virtue
[42:29] and knowledge difference places growing
[42:31] up into his nature
[42:33] whose nature the nature of the Father
[42:35] God wants his
[42:37] nature instilled into his children well
[42:40] then he picks a tutor that has the
[42:42] closest nature to him right and as he
[42:45] would do those things then who would be
[42:48] actually passing the test you know they
[42:51] say that they can go to a college or
[42:53] something like that and they give them a
[42:54] tutor that they know that tutor so well
[42:57] until I can say well we know who taught
[42:59] this child because of the nature and the
[43:02] ways and the things you know that are in
[43:05] it all right but are you following me
[43:06] now so they're in the Old Testament now
[43:08] you only had the two examples
[43:11] you had the example of being a child
[43:15] born into the family now that child is
[43:19] even though he's an heir we get the
[43:21] scripture says he's no different than a
[43:27] servant there in Galatians truth and
[43:31] forward he's no different than a servant
[43:33] even yet he is heir of all things see he
[43:38] has the right there but yet just because
[43:40] he's born into the family only placed
[43:43] him in the family it didn't place in the
[43:47] way the father wants him so the child
[43:50] would actually just be he would be an
[43:52] heir to her he would be a child right
[43:58] but he wouldn't have the authority and
[44:01] that's what God wants
[44:03] in the Christian for us to do is to come
[44:06] forth to through him as a sin a statue a
[44:09] perfect man the growth development you
[44:11] know in things in the Christian to where
[44:14] it would come to be that we would be
[44:16] like the father so he would give us the
[44:20] new birth think all right we get the new
[44:24] birth that brings us into the body of
[44:27] Christ correct that places us in the
[44:31] body of Christ but then he would give us
[44:34] with that and the Bible said you shall
[44:37] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[44:39] after you believe not when you believe
[44:41] so then we don't stop just on that point
[44:43] but we're trying to bring the point one
[44:45] that that child it represents back there
[44:48] within the New Testament he gives us a
[44:50] fuse them with the holy ghost in a
[44:52] higher order because see all of this is
[44:54] the baptism with the holy ghost he's
[44:56] here we were being born again as Peter
[44:59] says you know by the incorruptible Word
[45:02] of God all right and as it's doing then
[45:05] we come to a place of sonship okay goes
[45:10] the son back in the Old Testament he was
[45:12] a son when he's born okay when you and I
[45:16] are born again but the baptism of the
[45:20] Holy Ghost given us the new birth we are
[45:23] the children of God
[45:24] heirs as we'll cover in a few minutes in
[45:27] Romans we're all of those things because
[45:31] we are the children of God but there's
[45:34] more to it than just stay at that point
[45:37] of a child you know coming into the
[45:40] family come on in brother welcome you
[45:44] know there's more to it than just to say
[45:46] well I'm a born-again Christian you know
[45:51] because see that's where we mess up we
[45:54] think that we get everything when we
[45:57] first believe it and that's what no what
[45:58] the scripture said is I was quoting our
[46:00] minute ago it's after you believed you
[46:03] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[46:05] promise then so the scripture lays out
[46:08] to show us that the adoption back there
[46:11] was an example that that child was born
[46:16] into the family made him a child made a
[46:18] son made a child are we breaking up no
[46:22] okay okay got you know me now we got it
[46:26] so we got we've got someone welcome and
[46:32] we need to get in and I thought was
[46:34] breaking up because this thing has broke
[46:36] on the bottom and it's not quitting the
[46:38] minute you'll know what either Richard
[46:40] pushed the wrong button or I did one all
[46:42] right but now think about it see backing
[46:46] up just a moment to cover where the
[46:48] brother won't be lost in what we're
[46:49] saying that we are the children of God
[46:53] by the new birth by that new birth we
[46:59] are the children of God
[47:01] heirs of God as well
[47:04] reading Romans even joiners what about
[47:07] that what God would think of his family
[47:10] to make us his children that that you
[47:14] know that would be there in us Gentiles
[47:16] we had no right of any form of adoption
[47:19] the Bible says the Dobson was for Israel
[47:21] go see that was the natural story to
[47:25] line up with the natural people so he
[47:28] got the natural story of Israel and
[47:30] their natural story of adoption that
[47:32] their son was a son but then after a
[47:36] while he was given a tutor and the tutor
[47:39] raised him up to a position and then
[47:41] once he reached that position to where
[47:43] the father could trust him and
[47:45] everything then the father would would
[47:47] give him his signet his seal is his
[47:49] approval to use his name or write a
[47:52] check as we call it today you know and
[47:54] it would come forth as being into that
[47:58] position all right yeah but like now
[48:01] here's the point try to put up where we
[48:03] are now then but see you only had the
[48:05] two stages there the Old Testament you
[48:09] only had the stage of the son born into
[48:12] the family and the next stage was the
[48:15] teacher or tutor are coming to authority
[48:19] because you didn't have anything else to
[48:22] carry on there but Paul picks it up in
[48:25] Galatians C and he advances into the
[48:31] form of bringing it to the New Testament
[48:34] all right and as he brings it to the New
[48:37] Testament then he begins to tell us that
[48:41] there's more to it there's more to it
[48:45] see we will I mean I'm not throwing
[48:47] those stones now we just know we got old
[48:49] Baptists we said we've got it all and we
[48:51] believed well I didn't believe it when
[48:53] I've argued with him because I told him
[48:55] I said why does it say he that believeth
[48:57] you know I was by the way then and
[49:01] that's what I believe
[49:02] but yet still see there's more to the
[49:07] Christian life than they're just going
[49:10] to church being good you know and all
[49:15] like that all that's well and good
[49:17] well that part is good that is the
[49:18] nature instilling that's good it's
[49:21] wonderful but that's not all of it
[49:25] he expects us to come to the position of
[49:27] authority but it's to come to his
[49:31] authority not ours it's not for us see
[49:35] all right salvation is of the Lord John
[49:38] or two and nines they are now see then
[49:40] we come to the position to her that we
[49:44] see these examples are wonderful but
[49:50] when Paul picks it up into the New
[49:51] Testament he continues the thought all
[49:56] right he continues the thoughts he like
[49:58] we look at the pyramid and we see we're
[50:01] born again at faith that's in 2nd Peter
[50:05] there's a born again at faith then we're
[50:08] birthed into these things as God is
[50:10] bringing us forth in the body and
[50:13] teaching us the authority and the
[50:15] position and all like that but then when
[50:18] it gets to where it says Holy Spirit see
[50:20] then there's a place above they are
[50:22] called a headstone well I that headstone
[50:25] was never brought forward they rejected
[50:29] the headstone Jesus Christ was a
[50:31] headstone but they rejected him and see
[50:34] that was not for that back there it
[50:36] would have to wait until the end time as
[50:38] we'll get to it this evening to where
[50:41] that it would come to having that
[50:43] headstone would come and see you can say
[50:46] well I've got this and I've got that all
[50:48] right there's still more of God you know
[50:50] that ever if ever but ever person I make
[50:53] a carnal illustration but it I like him
[50:55] if every person in the world today was
[50:58] born again it'd be a wonderful world
[51:01] wouldn't it
[51:01] but you know that would just be the
[51:03] starting point and that wouldn't be all
[51:07] God wants it's not that he just wants
[51:10] his children born he wants his children
[51:14] to have his authority his his nature his
[51:18] ways is their makeup into me he wants
[51:21] that to be in each one of his children
[51:23] men women children at home because
[51:28] that's that's what God has
[51:30] always desired for his family to have
[51:34] his ways in nature about him like I was
[51:37] always saying I know it's carnal but I
[51:39] don't want my kids to act like the
[51:40] neighbor because I don't want to find
[51:43] out they belong to the neighbor you say
[51:45] well that's carnal well that's plain no
[51:47] it tells it like it is I want them to be
[51:51] to where they can have the my nature in
[51:54] my ways we was going around behind home
[51:58] door one day and the neighbor was dire
[52:01] and you know you know we were talking to
[52:04] him about a horse or something but
[52:05] anyhow Terence was talking to it well we
[52:07] get in the car and leave and come back
[52:08] around the house and Terence said damn
[52:11] I'm glad you didn't look like that then
[52:18] I remember the guy had long hair you
[52:19] know good-looking long hair hanging down
[52:21] I said well okay he said I said why he
[52:25] said because that's the way I'd want to
[52:27] act if that's the way you act okay okay
[52:31] maybe I can't be from having a long
[52:33] higher of a test I'll have to beat the
[52:35] rest if out of him attention okay
[52:39] raising our children you know that God
[52:43] sometimes he has to give us a whippin to
[52:44] bring us into the position to work we're
[52:46] lino okay but now are you following me
[52:49] see then when we get into the New
[52:51] Testament now we've got to come to a
[52:53] higher order because oh let's see how is
[52:58] it that the Bible speaks about the law
[53:00] that he magnified the law he made an
[53:02] honorable he it was many things that God
[53:05] done to the law he didn't just throw it
[53:08] away all right and see that's what God
[53:11] wants with all of us he wants us to come
[53:14] to a place that he can trust us then he
[53:19] can put his confidence in us that he can
[53:22] give us his nature in his ways that's
[53:26] all that I'm trying to teach on adoption
[53:28] and you think we'll adoption I said did
[53:30] not entity think it's a simple point
[53:32] it's simple it's just becoming more like
[53:37] God and acting like him all right and
[53:40] here Paul is covering that sea but the
[53:43] air
[53:44] as long as he's in a Chow she born into
[53:48] the fan
[53:49] he still everything's not right yeah
[53:54] God wants more of you and me other than
[53:57] to just be the point of trying to get us
[54:00] born again you know we say well will we
[54:03] send out this we sent out with we don't
[54:05] try to have these deep things in the
[54:07] message or something we try to have it
[54:09] simple well the most simple thing there
[54:12] is is an uber but you know what that's
[54:13] the deepest thing there is in the Bible
[54:17] because it was God's first doctrine
[54:20] right is that right the Lord Jesus first
[54:23] doctor knee priests was you must be born
[54:25] again and see the whole Bible is you
[54:28] must be born again
[54:29] all right now are you listening and
[54:32] getting the point then see it then the
[54:34] son when he's a son that's when he's
[54:38] born so bringing that into the New
[54:43] Testament and we see that when a person
[54:46] is born again that makes them a child of
[54:51] God puts them in a wonderful position to
[54:55] be brings us to a position there to
[55:00] where we can start something we can
[55:02] start growing seeing the Bible says grow
[55:05] in grace and knowledge all right
[55:07] see then that's where people messed up
[55:10] people messed up by thinking we could
[55:13] everything when we believe are you
[55:15] Pentecostals when they say well we speak
[55:17] in tongues we shouted we done we got it
[55:19] all well see that's not that's just a
[55:22] start that's my whole point of trying to
[55:25] get you to see it is you're a new birth
[55:28] it just starts your journey because
[55:30] you're born to get it faith all right
[55:33] then these things have to grow into us
[55:36] and grow in grace and knowledge and
[55:40] things all right
[55:41] and as it comes forth then see we don't
[55:44] stay just a child I mean yeah you know I
[55:48] mean you you got pictures in your
[55:50] billfold or ladies with your pocketbook
[55:52] but when you kids within a certain age
[55:54] and and really you're like from the
[55:56] state
[55:56] that way you know I used to have them on
[55:59] the wall at the home not going on Excel
[56:01] which way to stayed that away way
[56:02] Terrence stayed that way and an estate
[56:04] that away but you know that's well and
[56:06] good but you know what that's not the
[56:10] way God wants it and they wasn't given
[56:13] to us to be that away our children were
[56:16] given to us to be raised to bring in a
[56:19] nature in a way all right see that's
[56:23] where the Prophet said people messed up
[56:26] by thinking they got everything when
[56:29] they believed well you know there's a
[56:34] growth development there's more to it
[56:37] what because it didn't just stop as to
[56:42] come into a family it doesn't even just
[56:46] stop us to come into having full
[56:48] authority but that's what everybody
[56:50] wants right
[56:51] everybody wants the authority oh we want
[56:54] this willing that we want we want to to
[56:56] control less this but C Authority
[56:59] without character it's satanic you take
[57:06] authority and have no character with
[57:08] that you don't even want them working
[57:11] for you at work
[57:12] you've got you got to the boxes and
[57:15] things event you don't want them people
[57:17] to be there when they want to run
[57:19] everything their way you didn't hire
[57:21] them for that they always tried to tell
[57:23] them use this and here Chet Atkins
[57:24] didn't hire people to play the way they
[57:27] wanted to he hired him to play the way
[57:31] he wanted him to play and if they didn't
[57:33] like it they could get out the door you
[57:35] know but maybe God order throw us out
[57:37] the door sometimes but okay now go on
[57:39] what see the Holy Spirit is our tutor
[57:44] all right so when you come into the New
[57:47] Testament now you're coming into a
[57:49] different position cause now listen to
[57:51] the point even though in the Old
[57:52] Testament you had the son that would be
[57:55] born into the family even though you
[57:56] would give him a tutor a person to raise
[57:59] them that still never gave them a new
[58:01] birth there was no new birth in the Old
[58:06] Testament
[58:08] you say well no wait a minute no way see
[58:11] Jesus Christ had not died how could you
[58:13] have the old new birth in the Old
[58:16] Testament when Jesus Christ had not died
[58:19] he could not come and live in us that
[58:22] away they had the anointing yes they had
[58:26] great things David could do all of the
[58:28] great things those mighty me and all
[58:30] kind of things could take place yes but
[58:32] still it didn't have the new birth you
[58:34] think David with all that what he could
[58:36] do what if he'd had a new birth you
[58:39] don't never thought Samson well he could
[58:41] do what if he'd had the new birth oh man
[58:45] he wouldn't worry about taking on ten
[58:47] thousand then why sometimes he he didn't
[58:49] care all right but you get the point now
[58:52] what I'm trying to bring the Old
[58:54] Testament could type and shatter
[58:56] examples that's what the Old Testament
[58:59] solely is all the way through is the
[59:01] examples and then you get over into
[59:03] where is it Ezekiel then you get over
[59:09] into those you've got examples of coming
[59:12] forth in as a new birth position but it
[59:16] could not come forth me there was no way
[59:21] to bring that new birth until Jesus
[59:23] Christ had died so as we read to our in
[59:25] Galatians that he was made of own made
[59:28] under the woman to redeem them that were
[59:30] under the law that they might be the
[59:33] children of God which that didn't make
[59:37] them the children of God in the Old
[59:38] Testament I Drive that point hard
[59:41] because you cannot bring those things
[59:43] into understanding you've got to wait
[59:45] until the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:47] comes all right and that's it would come
[59:50] forth into that position then you can
[59:53] start thinking about things as they
[59:57] begin to grow and what takes place and
[1:00:00] then you'll see why the scripture speaks
[1:00:03] of the way that does me and why Paul
[1:00:07] would give the scripture to go through
[1:00:09] that the air as long as he's an air he's
[1:00:12] fine but he's not positionally placed so
[1:00:17] we need to get into the Bible and study
[1:00:20] it
[1:00:21] not to just read it for something I know
[1:00:25] I came through the Baptist Church I'm
[1:00:27] not throwing no stones I came through
[1:00:29] there I appreciate all of that all of
[1:00:31] those things and times but I learned
[1:00:33] from that that you don't just take the
[1:00:37] Bible and try to read it for your own
[1:00:40] concept you'll mess up every time you
[1:00:46] try to put it into the position to where
[1:00:48] you can have some understanding and I
[1:00:51] tried back then to do that because that
[1:00:53] was my idea excuse me for having to put
[1:00:55] in a cough drop but that's all part of
[1:00:58] that coughing you know not the graveside
[1:01:02] all right but now listen as I said you
[1:01:09] had the two examples now in the Old
[1:01:11] Testament the birth and the authority
[1:01:14] but no new birth all right but Paul
[1:01:18] picks it up in the Galatians and begins
[1:01:23] to speak of something else to come
[1:01:26] Peter's picks it up in the in his in
[1:01:30] second Peter you know he picks it up and
[1:01:33] he begins to speak of something greater
[1:01:36] than for us to just be you know babies
[1:01:40] that God don't want us to be that and
[1:01:43] just stay that he wants us to grow up in
[1:01:46] him to where he can trust us right you
[1:01:53] don't put a novice you ever noticed it
[1:01:55] even to show you one example you don't
[1:01:58] have a novice to know just I mean in the
[1:02:00] New Testament writing there were one of
[1:02:04] those writers in the New Testament was
[1:02:06] tutored and brought to a position before
[1:02:09] they were given the right to write what
[1:02:11] they were to even drive all right so
[1:02:14] then that shows that what's what God
[1:02:16] wants us to be all right let's see Paul
[1:02:19] went on to pick it up so we'll try to to
[1:02:23] just get to point to where we're at
[1:02:24] today so turn over to Roman's of course
[1:02:26] they can pull it up and we'll get into
[1:02:29] Romans and pull it up on the screen
[1:02:32] I want you to see from this that there's
[1:02:36] three stages in this adoption that you
[1:02:41] deal with instead of just the two
[1:02:43] instead it's just getting born you know
[1:02:45] born again her baby or even the
[1:02:48] authority even the position even God
[1:02:52] trusting us to be like Peter and Johnson
[1:02:56] silver and gold have I none what's it in
[1:02:59] the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:03:01] walk
[1:03:01] well ladies reach down and get a million
[1:03:04] C's they had come to the position that
[1:03:06] they had the authority with God Paul
[1:03:11] could say that you'll be judged by my
[1:03:14] gospel now what about a man like that
[1:03:16] you realize we're gonna be judged by his
[1:03:19] god you realized the world's gonna be
[1:03:21] judged by the the gospel of the Apostle
[1:03:23] Paul that's what he said and he said if
[1:03:26] anybody comes and brave anything one
[1:03:29] Gleason's 1:8 that right he comes and
[1:03:32] brings anything contrary to what I
[1:03:33] brought didn't let him be accursed
[1:03:37] that's something it what about a man
[1:03:39] with that kind of authority
[1:03:43] then when he spoke it God honored it and
[1:03:46] brought it to PI's all right but now
[1:03:50] let's get into this will this picture
[1:03:52] caught up from from this to try to cover
[1:03:54] three stages of adoption all right
[1:03:58] instead of just two instead of just of a
[1:04:01] two stage two were you birth and then
[1:04:03] position we're gonna get into another
[1:04:06] stage it's gonna cover a real good point
[1:04:09] those sorts right where everything is
[1:04:11] that so look at the Scriptures are now
[1:04:13] Romans 8:14 where as many as are led by
[1:04:19] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:04:22] God that's wonderful it if you're a
[1:04:26] child of God you're led by the Spirit of
[1:04:28] God you have the Holy Spirit the new
[1:04:29] birth that you've received and watch
[1:04:31] what he says for you have not received
[1:04:33] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:04:37] you have received the spirit of adoption
[1:04:41] whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:04:46] the spirit of adoption all right see not
[1:04:51] all together than one but you'll have to
[1:04:52] have to have a place to start your new
[1:04:57] birth is where you start your adoption
[1:05:00] right same as the Old Testament the
[1:05:03] child born into the family in the New
[1:05:05] Testament the child born into the family
[1:05:07] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:05:09] where you start your journey that gives
[1:05:12] you the spirit of adoption are the holy
[1:05:15] spirit of adoption it gives you that to
[1:05:18] her that you can can have a lot of
[1:05:21] things and not watch what he says the
[1:05:26] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:05:28] spirit how long could we stay on talking
[1:05:34] about the Holy Spirit bearing witness in
[1:05:37] you you ever had him to do that
[1:05:40] you ever had him to tell you something
[1:05:42] before it took place you ever had him to
[1:05:45] direct you into something or tell you to
[1:05:47] go a different way then once he went
[1:05:48] going down the highway you know and you
[1:05:51] turn to go the other way come find out
[1:05:52] you get home and they had all kind of
[1:05:54] wrecks over on that road see that's that
[1:05:56] Spirit of God directing you through your
[1:06:00] life to direct listen and tutor us and
[1:06:03] carry us home to bringing us to the
[1:06:06] right place right the spirit itself
[1:06:08] beareth witness with our spirit the Holy
[1:06:10] Spirit will bear witness with your
[1:06:12] spirit if you really got the Holy Spirit
[1:06:14] that spirit within you and I need to or
[1:06:17] just your natural see taste filled smell
[1:06:19] hear type of for more memories God it's
[1:06:21] the deeper meaning of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:24] coming to each one of us in our lives to
[1:06:27] guide us and to keep us into all of it
[1:06:32] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:06:34] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:06:36] God now back to where we were in the
[1:06:42] message a moment ago he wants you
[1:06:45] children to act like you you know that's
[1:06:48] what God wants God wants his children to
[1:06:52] act like him right that's the very
[1:06:57] purpose that way we can know by the
[1:07:00] speed
[1:07:00] that's what dealing with us whether
[1:07:02] we're the children of God or not if we
[1:07:05] live like the devil whose children are
[1:07:06] we if we act like the devil we must be
[1:07:11] the child of the devil that's why I love
[1:07:14] what is in Galatians five
[1:07:15] we're talks about the one of them says
[1:07:18] the fruits of the spirit is love joy
[1:07:19] peace goodness meekness and all huh but
[1:07:22] it's the other one says the works of the
[1:07:23] flesh there's a lot of difference in the
[1:07:27] works of the flesh and the fruits of the
[1:07:29] spirit
[1:07:29] it's the fruits of the Holy Spirit but
[1:07:32] it's works of natural flesh that doesn't
[1:07:34] work too good okay now listen now and if
[1:07:38] children what's how Polly begins to
[1:07:44] coming forth to to cover the toward the
[1:07:47] nature part of of God to be instilled
[1:07:51] into us to bring us to what God wants
[1:07:54] and says and if children then heirs
[1:07:56] heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[1:08:07] what am I then yeah I never read that
[1:08:12] well read it and see what about to be an
[1:08:16] heir of God right because that new birth
[1:08:22] the new birth makes you an heir of God
[1:08:27] and it even makes you heirs of God and
[1:08:32] joint-heirs with Christ and here's one
[1:08:36] that's hard for us to swallow some time
[1:08:39] to think that God wants his children to
[1:08:44] be so much like him and he makes them
[1:08:46] joint heirs your heirs of God called you
[1:08:50] receive eternal life
[1:08:53] God alone gives eternal life right and
[1:08:56] he gives us eternal life
[1:08:58] that makes us joint heirs with Christ
[1:09:00] not that Christ is another person we
[1:09:03] don't believe in trinitarianism we're
[1:09:05] not that we believe in one true and
[1:09:07] living God Almighty God he gave us his
[1:09:12] nature
[1:09:13] who does
[1:09:14] none of the reasons you cover it with
[1:09:15] cross is the point to where Christ is
[1:09:18] that r19 are the anointed that comes
[1:09:23] within you to live in you all right so
[1:09:26] look and if children if we're the
[1:09:29] children of God look what we have no
[1:09:36] there's no if we read everything
[1:09:41] correctly you know I'm 79 years old
[1:09:46] we're anything correctly a few years
[1:09:48] from now I kind of Python well if my
[1:09:52] family is my family and I love all of
[1:09:54] them equally then it will be divided
[1:09:57] equally what I have what because
[1:10:01] there'll be errors me by being born into
[1:10:05] the family will make them errors but
[1:10:09] what about being born into the family of
[1:10:11] God to make you heir of God are with God
[1:10:14] and it makes you join a hair's join
[1:10:19] tires means there's a society right
[1:10:22] plain language right it's the same what
[1:10:26] about all born-again Christians are the
[1:10:28] same now all true born-again Christians
[1:10:34] are the same one because they have the
[1:10:37] same God living within them and their
[1:10:41] heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[1:10:43] what if so be that we suffer with him
[1:10:46] that we may be also glorified together
[1:10:51] alright now that's the point we like the
[1:10:53] other we want the heirs we want
[1:10:55] everything he's got we want to be healed
[1:10:57] we wanted me deliver one two but we
[1:10:59] don't want the afflictions and things
[1:11:01] that goes with being a Christian right
[1:11:04] ain't none of you want to be sick no we
[1:11:09] want to be delivered we want to be well
[1:11:12] all right come on this little point
[1:11:15] listen
[1:11:16] if children then heirs heirs of God and
[1:11:18] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:11:21] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:11:22] glorified together for our reckon that
[1:11:26] the sufferings of this
[1:11:28] present time are not worthy to be
[1:11:31] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:11:34] revealed in us the little banner
[1:11:37] afflictions that we long you know I'm so
[1:11:41] down and out and I'm so there's no being
[1:11:44] sick it's being sick right but see you
[1:11:50] can take my wife for an example she's at
[1:11:52] home today oh she has pneumonia but now
[1:11:55] you tell me how many times she's ever
[1:11:57] met services before they we come to
[1:12:03] church if we're sick I thought that was
[1:12:06] the place we're supposed to be I didn't
[1:12:09] know we're supposed to go to the
[1:12:10] hospital no don't don't let us
[1:12:13] understand me we go to the hospital we
[1:12:15] believe in doctors we do medicine and
[1:12:18] everything right so don't misunderstand
[1:12:19] my language just get what I'm saying
[1:12:22] if you're sick where you go I went by my
[1:12:25] mother for one day and she said where
[1:12:27] you headed I said I'm headed to the
[1:12:29] church with the kids they're sick well
[1:12:34] then she going to the doctor I would
[1:12:35] take care of that second we're going to
[1:12:39] the church to be prayed for well a lot
[1:12:41] of times when church got prayed for it
[1:12:43] didn't have to go to the doctor right
[1:12:45] see if cultures what we believing okay
[1:12:48] now listen
[1:12:49] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:12:51] present time what about now if your join
[1:12:54] tires remember whatever he has you them
[1:12:59] but he suffered for you and I he
[1:13:06] suffered for you and I what's the
[1:13:10] problem was suffering a little bit for
[1:13:12] him you know I think saying we got to be
[1:13:16] sick to glorify God no no no you are
[1:13:19] going to be sick let's get that into
[1:13:23] your mind well now you're making that
[1:13:25] set in my mind and I'm gonna be sitting
[1:13:26] no I'm just telling it like it is you're
[1:13:29] going to be a sick eventually somewhere
[1:13:31] down the road but we don't have to go
[1:13:35] down the road looking for sickness right
[1:13:38] we believe in being protected but I
[1:13:40] ain't standing out here for
[1:13:41] the Train we don't go in those lines
[1:13:45] guard listen look for the earnest
[1:13:48] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:13:54] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:13:58] earnest expectation of the creation
[1:14:01] that's what that word is creature
[1:14:03] creation you realize the world is
[1:14:08] groaning you realize the animals after
[1:14:14] being run over like I said you know
[1:14:16] train come down the road or a deer
[1:14:18] running across the highway or something
[1:14:19] and they're being killed their suffering
[1:14:22] their groaning wanting to be delivered
[1:14:28] understand how can it be done you say
[1:14:32] well I can't talk he can communicate
[1:14:34] pretty good with him I've seen deer do
[1:14:38] amazing things I've seen deer walk down
[1:14:40] there through the woods and starting to
[1:14:41] look at me and me sitting completely
[1:14:43] covered and everything in the book and
[1:14:45] look at me like wave hey I see you
[1:14:47] sitting up there something took care of
[1:14:49] them but look what is the creature our
[1:14:56] creation waiting for okay now back up
[1:15:03] where was that what stage one adoption
[1:15:07] went into the family the Old Testament
[1:15:11] people had that second stage with Ora T
[1:15:14] right now what's the third C we're
[1:15:16] picking up to another stage now we're in
[1:15:19] the scripture picking up to another
[1:15:21] stage what is that stage that the
[1:15:23] creature is waiting for the
[1:15:26] manifestation of the sons of God where
[1:15:33] the creature was made subject are put
[1:15:35] under death and dying and all the
[1:15:40] livings and things like that see he was
[1:15:43] made subject to vanity not willingly not
[1:15:48] of his own self but by reason of him who
[1:15:50] have subjected the same in hope but the
[1:15:53] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:15:55] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:15:58] glorious liberty of the children of God
[1:16:00] I love to hunt I love to see the animals
[1:16:04] and watch them and I was sitting
[1:16:06] watching a squirrel one day and he
[1:16:08] jumped on this big old tree beside of me
[1:16:10] and he went up that tree and he went a
[1:16:12] good 50 feet out up that tree and all at
[1:16:16] once he just sprung off and he went sit
[1:16:20] and about ten foot off the ground there
[1:16:23] was a limb sticking out and he goes to
[1:16:24] bloom to blow this walks down off of
[1:16:27] that I cried I said there cried I said
[1:16:37] God could I trust you enough to jump out
[1:16:40] the top of that 50-foot tree see there
[1:16:47] one day they'll be delivered there won't
[1:16:51] be no more hunting in the millennium
[1:16:53] won't be no killings and doing be a
[1:16:58] wonderful thing the word death will be
[1:17:02] taken away but the point of getting at
[1:17:07] is what what's gonna cause that it tells
[1:17:14] you in plain language the creature
[1:17:18] itself shall be delivered from the
[1:17:19] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[1:17:20] liberty of the children go well we know
[1:17:22] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:17:24] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:17:26] waiting for backup above there a few
[1:17:29] verses for what the manifestation of the
[1:17:32] sons and daughters of God children with
[1:17:36] authority sons and daughters join heirs
[1:17:43] with Jesus Christ and given authority to
[1:17:48] speak it speak a storm out of existence
[1:17:53] are speaking it rain speaking all kind
[1:17:57] of things take place you have never seen
[1:18:01] those things like that speak of the dead
[1:18:03] race you haven't been in that place
[1:18:09] well you've heard the story here how
[1:18:12] they're on two different occasions the
[1:18:14] same man God raised him up from today of
[1:18:16] course of our our very word calling his
[1:18:18] name
[1:18:19] that wouldn't me I haven't didn't have
[1:18:23] nothing to do with me that had to do
[1:18:25] with that point back over there of the
[1:18:26] joint Irish back up to where the join
[1:18:30] tires is in there if we have anything
[1:18:32] whatsoever he give it to us see if there
[1:18:36] gonna be anything in our life worth
[1:18:38] anything it's worth it
[1:18:39] okay waiting for the manifestation of
[1:18:44] the sons and daughters of God the making
[1:18:48] known rolled up back down a little bit
[1:18:50] where we can pick up the the word says
[1:18:52] there you go see if you look that up
[1:18:55] that word manifestation it literally
[1:18:58] means a making known you know are
[1:19:03] declaring bringing out into the open
[1:19:05] revealing showing or delivering see the
[1:19:09] cold creation everything is waiting for
[1:19:12] the manifestation of the sons I say end
[1:19:16] daughters cuz that's not adding to the
[1:19:18] scripture of God all right but we don't
[1:19:23] believe that they're women know how no
[1:19:25] authority that's where you see you're
[1:19:28] just as wrong is to take the other side
[1:19:30] alright listen but waiting for something
[1:19:33] to happen waiting for God to be able to
[1:19:38] live among his people and to share his
[1:19:44] word isn't that the most marvelous thing
[1:19:48] that God would want to share his nature
[1:19:51] his beings but he wants us to be part of
[1:19:54] him in the word to be in us but coming
[1:19:59] on down to see there's your second stage
[1:20:01] the manifestation of sons of God all
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:04] Stage one is the new birth Stage two is
[1:20:07] manifestations of sons and daughters of
[1:20:09] God all right now there's another stage
[1:20:12] here the that if we look at it correctly
[1:20:16] we can see where we're at because that's
[1:20:19] where we'll be picking up the scene
[1:20:20] remember my thought
[1:20:22] remember the point that I told you last
[1:20:24] Sunday we're going to not be looking
[1:20:26] backward because that's the problem with
[1:20:29] us we're not going to be looking forward
[1:20:32] because that's our problem we're going
[1:20:34] to try to be realizing where we are
[1:20:37] right here now because it's fine
[1:20:41] to see tomorrow but we're not there it's
[1:20:44] great what has happened in the past
[1:20:46] wonderful opportunity to receive those
[1:20:49] things but yet we're not there we're
[1:20:51] we're right here now right we're right
[1:20:57] here now you start trying to call on the
[1:20:59] God that was back there come on
[1:21:04] or a god that was over will be over
[1:21:06] there he doesn't have to answer us but
[1:21:11] if you can make it present tense
[1:21:16] God he is a spirit not was whatever he
[1:21:20] is he still is whatever he was anywhere
[1:21:23] because that's what I like about the
[1:21:26] reason we don't want to look back and
[1:21:27] look forward because we're constantly
[1:21:29] moving science is constantly moving I
[1:21:34] was reading that yesterday where they've
[1:21:36] got some kind of a thing they said after
[1:21:37] all these years would atomic energies
[1:21:40] and things like that there was one
[1:21:41] little thing that they can't figure out
[1:21:43] they're working on it but you just think
[1:21:47] an age where we're out of all this stuff
[1:21:49] that we've gotten all the things that
[1:21:50] are taking place but they admit they got
[1:21:53] one little thing that they can't answer
[1:21:55] we'll get that to seasoning there's a
[1:21:58] mystery be the children of God has that
[1:22:03] little part already figured out because
[1:22:05] that's where we're going to you say well
[1:22:08] we've got it figured out yeah if science
[1:22:10] would just listen to us what do you
[1:22:12] think they are no but listen the world's
[1:22:16] waiting on the manifestation of sons and
[1:22:18] daughters for God amen all right now we
[1:22:20] take only we keep going now we're going
[1:22:22] to another stage what because the
[1:22:24] creature itself shall be so she'll be
[1:22:26] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:22:28] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:22:29] children of God those animals one day
[1:22:32] are going to be delivered to her that
[1:22:34] they will be with us
[1:22:36] for we know that the whole creation
[1:22:38] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[1:22:41] until now everything all that the 6,000
[1:22:46] years of mankind is groaning and
[1:22:49] travailing waiting for something the
[1:22:55] Bible says in Hebrews there 11:40 they
[1:23:00] without us cannot be made perfect so
[1:23:03] they're waiting on us you realize
[1:23:05] everything is waiting now let me say it
[1:23:09] as to the point of what we believe
[1:23:10] because we believe God sent a prophet
[1:23:12] and there was a time that he he turned
[1:23:14] around and spoke to these Hornets and
[1:23:15] they went back in her Nash he's seen a
[1:23:17] time that this bull was gonna come forth
[1:23:19] and kill him he told it to go lay down
[1:23:20] anyone laid down you know what nature
[1:23:24] saw its master just for a moment but
[1:23:27] that's not all of it that's got to be
[1:23:29] for us right that's got to be for us now
[1:23:34] come on listen and we know that the
[1:23:36] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:23:38] in pain together until now and not only
[1:23:41] they now look at the great Apostle Paul
[1:23:45] not only nature not only all the other
[1:23:48] look at his cell not only they but
[1:23:51] ourselves also the great man the great
[1:23:54] Apostle Paul is waiting on something
[1:24:00] he's waiting on something to take place
[1:24:05] right look and not only they but
[1:24:11] ourselves also which have the
[1:24:13] firstfruits of the Spirit right back
[1:24:15] where we started baby born into the
[1:24:17] family coming okay all right even we
[1:24:21] ourselves groan within ourselves what
[1:24:26] about the great man that he was the
[1:24:28] Apostle Paul yet he was waiting on John
[1:24:31] you know he's in the grave right now the
[1:24:36] Apostle Paul's in the grave right now
[1:24:37] right what's he waiting on me and you
[1:24:41] know what else would you be waiting home
[1:24:44] if we are to be the sons and daughters
[1:24:46] of the Living God
[1:24:48] if we're to be heirs or
[1:24:49] God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ if
[1:24:52] we're to have the manifestation of the
[1:24:53] sons and daughters of God among us then
[1:24:57] who's Paul waiting them he's waiting on
[1:25:02] us to call for it right add that little
[1:25:07] point
[1:25:08] Paul's waiting on us to call for it for
[1:25:11] what we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:25:15] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:25:24] redemption of the body all right now you
[1:25:28] can use that word wit as to witness and
[1:25:33] that's good to witness with what are you
[1:25:36] to witness what is this to happen
[1:25:37] waiting for the adoption to witness the
[1:25:41] redemption of our body I like to use it
[1:25:46] like this to wit to understand I'm
[1:25:50] saying the same thing now just to me
[1:25:52] it's just picks it up into a higher
[1:25:53] order but to it means to understand what
[1:25:57] is it we're growing within ourselves we
[1:26:00] right now we're groaning crying out
[1:26:04] dying with all kind of sicknesses and
[1:26:06] heartaches and problems lying
[1:26:10] waiting
[1:26:12] groaning within ourselves waiting for
[1:26:15] the adoption
[1:26:17] what is the adoption the redemption of
[1:26:20] our body right come on read it you say
[1:26:26] you ever - come in - no no just reading
[1:26:27] like that waiting the adoption the
[1:26:30] redemption of our body well my body's
[1:26:33] already redeemed no it's this in the
[1:26:36] process it was renamed rise and the day
[1:26:42] you got born again God laid a claim on
[1:26:46] that body that you're living in he later
[1:26:51] claimed on that to say that's mine right
[1:26:57] let's see there's still problems we're
[1:26:59] still dying
[1:27:04] but waiting the adoption to witness our
[1:27:09] to understand the redemption of our body
[1:27:15] what about it waiting on the
[1:27:19] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:27:21] God to come forth right let me give you
[1:27:29] a couple of that adoptions great big ol
[1:27:33] long word about that loan but I'm
[1:27:37] writing or taking out a Scofield Bible
[1:27:38] to just show you how this lines up and
[1:27:41] then I'll give you the other I gave it
[1:27:42] to you the other day but he says
[1:27:45] adoption placing as a son is not so much
[1:27:50] a word of relationship as of position
[1:27:58] let's go field knew that cuz he could
[1:28:00] read it he said the believers relation
[1:28:06] to God as a child results from the new
[1:28:12] birth where is now the very act of God
[1:28:18] were by one already is a child there's a
[1:28:21] new birth and through Redemption from
[1:28:25] the law he's placed in the position of
[1:28:28] an adult's on he's brought up the spirit
[1:28:35] given the realization in the believers
[1:28:39] present experience to full manifestation
[1:28:46] of the believers sonship now listen
[1:28:51] awaiting the resurrection the what are
[1:29:00] we waiting on the resurrection
[1:29:02] what we're waiting on the change of
[1:29:05] these bodies what are we waiting on the
[1:29:08] translation of these bodies those people
[1:29:15] knew that now let me give you I love
[1:29:17] thee to have a Bible that I've read a
[1:29:19] lot out of and it's got 26 translations
[1:29:22] and I like to use it sometime and out of
[1:29:29] one writer said it this way longing for
[1:29:35] the adoption that shall ransom our body
[1:29:43] from its bondage that's one of your
[1:29:45] writers that's that's the early early
[1:29:50] Joe beans is the epistle of Paul
[1:29:53] another writer the 20th century New
[1:29:58] Testament awaiting our adoption as sons
[1:30:08] the redemption of our body see those
[1:30:15] writers knew that that's the translation
[1:30:16] I'm bringing that from their
[1:30:18] translations of what you're saying we
[1:30:20] will that's that's another Bible or
[1:30:22] whatever eagerly one of them says
[1:30:28] eagerly awaiting we're eagerly awaiting
[1:30:33] our adoption the resurrection the
[1:30:41] redemption of these bodies eagerly
[1:30:45] awaiting it see those writers knew what
[1:30:48] they were bringing it out from as we
[1:30:52] wait for full sonship in the redemption
[1:30:55] of our bodies full sonship what is full
[1:30:58] sons you wild reformed I was a sudden
[1:31:00] wondered morning in right then there's a
[1:31:02] growth development part of that right
[1:31:03] now redemption to this body cuz about my
[1:31:07] Bible says we'll have a body like unto
[1:31:09] his glorious body
[1:31:15] sonship deals with the three stages of
[1:31:18] adoption birth sonship in manifestation
[1:31:23] and now covering it into the
[1:31:27] resurrection and the change yeah that's
[1:31:33] why I told you a long time ago hey I
[1:31:35] quit looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:31:36] a long time ago because I found out by
[1:31:40] reading the Bible that the dead in
[1:31:42] Christ is gonna rise first so I need to
[1:31:44] look for the resurrection now when the
[1:31:48] resurrection takes place then the rest
[1:31:50] gonna take place the dead in Christ
[1:31:51] gonna rise and then we which are alive
[1:31:54] and remain it will be changed
[1:31:57] see we move in to the change in the body
[1:31:59] Berkeley Cooke says it like this as we
[1:32:02] await that write of sonship that
[1:32:04] involves our bodily Redemption Phillips
[1:32:09] of the New Testament translation says
[1:32:11] which we wait for the redemption of our
[1:32:14] bodies which well means that the lie
[1:32:21] that at least we have realized sonship
[1:32:28] in him now that's that's the scripture
[1:32:34] that your reading of Romans where it
[1:32:36] says Romans 8:23 from brought from other
[1:32:40] translations to show you they were all
[1:32:44] looking for sonship our sonship is
[1:32:50] dealing with our redemption of these
[1:32:51] bodies until these bodies are fully
[1:32:54] redeemed it's not worth anything waiting
[1:33:00] for the adoption
[1:33:02] everything is groaning the trees are
[1:33:05] struggling everything is taking place
[1:33:08] waiting for the redemption of our bodies
[1:33:12] I'm reading you some quotes all these
[1:33:19] years until now
[1:33:24] now listen to him the prophets in now we
[1:33:28] have the earnest of our inheritance now
[1:33:35] we have the earnest of our inheritance
[1:33:39] all these years something's been waitin
[1:33:43] you know what was waiting on Malachi 4
[1:33:47] we know that that's easy but watch
[1:33:50] Malachi for behold I send you Elijah the
[1:33:52] Prophet you'll turn the hearts of the
[1:33:55] children back in time that has to take
[1:33:59] place before you can talk about
[1:34:03] redemption of these bodies was dying
[1:34:09] we're going by the grave but God
[1:34:12] promised us that he would send us the
[1:34:14] voice of Elijah to turn our hearts back
[1:34:18] to bring forth the message that would
[1:34:21] bring the redemption see we are waiting
[1:34:25] for the fullness of adoption that will
[1:34:30] take place when at the first
[1:34:34] resurrection salvation fully in the
[1:34:41] fullness of sonship see the Old
[1:34:46] Testament on the top - that's what I
[1:34:49] kept trying to lay that down now this
[1:34:50] evening we'll pick it up and we'll try
[1:34:53] to bring it on over into the
[1:34:56] dispensation of adoption there's got to
[1:35:01] be a dispensation or we can't fit in all
[1:35:05] right where's that dispensation what is
[1:35:07] it the whole world is waiting on the
[1:35:12] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:35:13] God we got that we understand that we
[1:35:17] understand that God sent a prophet in
[1:35:19] the last day to bring us the message
[1:35:22] well we've got that but he's waiting
[1:35:28] God's waiting on you and I adoption
[1:35:34] when he can pour his fullness into us
[1:35:36] and the things that we have need of well
[1:35:40] I just don't see it does that mean it's
[1:35:43] not there where would you be in the old
[1:35:46] days where would you be you know in the
[1:35:48] Bible times in time with Jesus well I
[1:35:50] just don't see it is that gonna change
[1:35:53] it they're gonna make it not true
[1:35:56] no somebody's gonna see it and they're
[1:35:58] gonna realize it but you're gonna have
[1:36:03] to realize it in yourself to start with
[1:36:05] are you gonna not have anyone else to
[1:36:08] realize all right the world is waiting
[1:36:11] on the sons and daughters of God to come
[1:36:14] into full maturity statue of a perfect
[1:36:16] land that's why I've been through these
[1:36:17] things we showing you what we have need
[1:36:20] of having a new birth is wonderful the
[1:36:27] manifestation of sons and daughters are
[1:36:30] making known of the sons and daughters
[1:36:33] of God what's gonna be the greatest
[1:36:36] makin known the day somebody steps
[1:36:40] through death right
[1:36:46] somebody's gonna step through death and
[1:36:48] say death where is your sting grave
[1:36:50] where is your victory just brush it off
[1:36:51] and walk right on through there won't be
[1:36:55] nothing there the end to say well I just
[1:36:57] don't believe that took place what about
[1:37:02] it come on musician what about it can
[1:37:09] you see my point the Old Testament let
[1:37:13] me review at one point where you'll make
[1:37:14] sure entreated I know I say a lot of
[1:37:15] things in it you get tied up wonderful
[1:37:17] wait a minute he said in the Old
[1:37:19] Testament you could only have the
[1:37:22] example of a son being born into the
[1:37:26] family then it could move into the
[1:37:29] second stage to her that it could be
[1:37:32] authority that the son could come forth
[1:37:34] and act like his father but that was
[1:37:36] only tops and shadows well when Paul
[1:37:39] picks it up in Galatians and Romans
[1:37:41] Peter in 2nd Peter is explaining
[1:37:46] what is taking place the headstone has
[1:37:52] not communist that's the words of the
[1:37:54] prophet
[1:37:54] you know what the headstone is reveal
[1:37:56] word that means there's something about
[1:38:00] the word that's we need to realize what
[1:38:02] took place well I've done told you what
[1:38:05] I'm doing I've done this and stood on it
[1:38:08] from the very beginning when those seals
[1:38:11] broke to the Prophet he saw Redemption
[1:38:18] when we see it by revelation
[1:38:21] we'll see Redemption well we don't get
[1:38:24] it reading Greer's almanac you know what
[1:38:29] I'm saying you don't get it that way you
[1:38:33] get it by going into the Word of God and
[1:38:35] searching it out and crying out to God
[1:38:39] to reveal it which went wrong with our
[1:38:43] thinking why are we not a eager to serve
[1:38:46] God let Stan I hope you'll just take
[1:38:54] what we've said and
[1:38:56] consider it Oh politely there are three
[1:39:01] stages then so what the New Testament
[1:39:03] added another stage to your addiction
[1:39:07] exchanger the body
[1:39:12] these old bodies are gonna be change
[1:39:15] they're gonna be renamed they're going
[1:39:18] to be resurrected
[1:39:22] don't be change and evolve on the twin
[1:39:24] mover die
