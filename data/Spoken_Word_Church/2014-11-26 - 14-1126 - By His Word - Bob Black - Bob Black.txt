TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign I want to see to see you Glory pour out your power and love sing Holy Holy holy name holy hope holy holy holy holy our holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen I pray you'll Open the Eyes of our hearts I feel like the the last couple of years the word has just been opening more and more to me it seems like sometimes you're a little bit behind catching up but um you know God's Building the body he's a he's a carpenter so I want to um just pull from maybe a little uh a lot of different scriptures as we go right into speaking on the word and turn to Matthew 25 and verse 1. and then John 3 chapter chapter 3 verse 3. and then First Peter 1 23. let's go to the author Lord God we thank you so much for your grace to us Lord and for opening your words with us Lord God and Lord we're not worthy Lord Jesus to speak of these things but Lord but you made us worthy Lord and Lord God we're so grateful Lord tonight that you're looking through your shed blood Lord God looking at the sacrifice that you made for us Lord Jesus God I thank you Lord God for your grace Lord Jesus thank you so much for your presence here tonight Lord Jesus and I pray o God that you're quick in the word as it goes into the hearers hearts Lord Jesus and make it come alive on us Lord Jesus Quicken this service Lord Jesus Lord we just give you all the honor and the glory and the preeminence Lord I we give you the full control of the service Grant it Lord we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so in Matthew 25 verse 1. it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise excuse me a second and five were foolish and we know the rest of that little scripture let's turn to John 3 3. Jesus answered it and said unto him I'm verily verily I say unto thee accept a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God right right and then First Peter 1 23 how are we born again being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorrectable by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever he may be seated yeah I kind of you know being born again has kind of been on my heart since the ministry of meeting and then when we were up in Kentucky the brother preached on uh being born again and you know I I always say that even if somebody preaches the worst sermon in the world I'm going to get a little something out of it even if it confirms more what I believe and uh so I I like hearing uh somebody bringing their revelation and uh but I it got me thinking about you know what what is the main thing and maybe I want to spend a little time talking this evening on on uh not so much being born again maybe but on Nicodemus and what he was looking for because we read in John chapter three he said it starts like this there was a man of the Pharisees and the Pharisees were the ones that were taught about about the scripture they uh you know that brother random preached that this this sermon the most holy ones the in the most holy place and so forth they should have known who he was and and Nicodemus called little glimpse and uh I'm gonna read some quotes there in a little bit that explains what brother Branham explained what nicodemus's real motivation was about and it says the same came to Jesus by night and it said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him and you know brother random explains as soon as he started you know how somebody a lot of times somebody will start complimenting and flattering you know and Joe 32 when Elijah who Rises up he said I'm not going to bring flatters and things I'm not going to uh you know and and and you know what Jesus does is as soon as the flattery start coming out I I know you're just a wonderful man you're just an amazing person an amazing teacher and you know Jesus knew he didn't know what he was talking about that he he what he was looking at what he he thought that Jesus had an understanding just of of life and a good living a good life and being a good person which is what many people today think that Jesus was just a philosopher I had a good good principle but you know if you really dive into what Jesus taught either he was the greatest deceiver ever or he was the son of God God veiled in a human flesh if you really dive into the scripture sometimes you'll find some surprising things and and that's that's really what I'm getting there what what was Nicodemus looking for right what are we looking for what is the main thing Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee after he just cut him off it looked like he changed topics it's changed it from talking about whether he was a good teacher or not to changing it to how he could see things the same way that he saw because uh you know brother Brandon preached a lot of sermons about the way we look and what what Jesus was doing is he was telling him look you've got to look at things differently and the only way you can look at things differently is by being born again by being born not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible verily verily I see unto thee accept a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he cannot even understand what you can't even understand I'm talking about and then then the rest of that chapter he proceeds to lay it out he just uh all of the all of this doctor this that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and and all these other things it just dump the doctrine right out on him and no one but you know the the things that he he spoke were written here so that we could take advantage and I want to say if the things that are preached over the pool maybe not as I'm speaking but uh but you know if you don't understand maybe there's a reason let me let me speak a little bit bluntly you know sometimes uh you know I feel like sometimes ministers maybe try to frame their words in a hidden way maybe so you'll you'll to to Shield us from being our feelings for being hurt a little bit but sometimes there's a reason why we don't see things I I was thinking about um how I I I I talked to oh I'll say one of my neighbors and tried to share the gospel with him and uh every time I share the gospel with him he begins to curse and he always comes back to this story about how he was in his church um which is uh I won't say the denomination but it's close to Catholic and and he was in line for the communion and they didn't give him the communion and so he began to curse and swear the man giving him the communion and you know the Bible says cast not your Pearls Before Swine and I I you know I I want to keep plugging away because he's not the first to kick against the pricks I want to keep plugging away but yet I don't I don't want to share these these little you don't you know go show them pictures of the cloud and pictures of these pearls these precious things that are only for an elect people I believe because what will they do they'll turn and ring you they'll go and and start searching on the internet and and uh and uh reading about all the bad things that people say and and and they'll turn and read you but maybe a little bit of time get just weed out that a little bit of time and and and long and long I mean that's how many of us came along and alone we didn't come all at once all at once were at adoption which is what's being taught that all at once you you get the spirit of God falls on you and you're all the way ready to drive the car ready to drive the truck down the road but how how do we get the Pearl a great price how do we get that you have to sell everything when you found the pearl of great price you sell you're willing to give up everything you're willing to uh you're willing to give up all your ideas and all your priests conceive Notions and all the things that you thought the way it should be and now Nicodemus came to Jesus and I wonder if he thought that he looked that he was the way that he expected him to be yeah you know the Bible says that he was not a man that we should desire he was not you know pretty to look at her or nice to look at I should say it wasn't a a greatest stature he wasn't as as big as Saul was in the Bible you know a great big huge man that's why the men elected him to Saul to be the king of Israel because he was a great big huge man then Here Comes little little David that was at the the run of the pack that nobody would even look at and God takes him from from the behind it looks like and puts him up up at the front but what are we looking at and you know uh when you begin to look for that for somebody that can teach you the Pearl gray price maybe maybe the way maybe when you find somebody that can really teach you that can really open the scriptures they they are not exactly what you're expecting maybe a little rough around the edges I wonder if Paul was a little bit rough around the edges and maybe would uh say things in a way that they it might hurt people's feelings and things might might say it just bluntly and everything you know somebody that can really teach you the truth might not polish it up and make it all pretty and Flowery and preach a sermon about roses and and uh and about uh politics and things like that but we'll just tear it right straight down the line because you know the Bible says that the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword and what's it doing is it's cutting away the things that aren't that aren't supposed to be there right it can hurt a little bit it's cutting and shaving away and and it cuts down dividing even us under the soul and the spirit all the way down to the mirror of the bone and what's what's made in the mirror of the bone the blood that's where the blood is made it's cutting all the way and that's how God inserts himself into the human life is by his word cutting down cutting down all the way through uh exposing your unbelief convicting you pricking your heart causing you by his word to give way to the to his Spirit right and now um now you know if we can if we can figure out how we grow how we're born then that you know God God has a pattern that he works with everything works in continuity when I said earlier I can see the word opening up more and more you know many people look at the word I I was talking to some one of the minister Brothers here about this a while ago about how many look at the uh you know when Daniel 70 weeks there's a little box put it over here and then you got um you know another Doctrine being born again put it over here and then another Doctrine you got um another Topic at say a ministers meeting or whatever over here and these are all separate topics is the way they think but really they all run together now you know I remember brother Reno speaking about that that black brother that that preached about the horizontal rainbow and I I always wondered what was that horizontal rainbow but I believe I'm beginning to get a an idea of where that horizontal rainbow was because God's attributes run down in continuity from the beginning to the end from Genesis to revelation all down through scripture and everything ties into everything the way you're born again is the way you grow and through justification sanctification the baptism Holy Ghost by the word growing word on type of word precept on top of precepts here a little there little and the thing that Nicodemus was looking for was was maybe not the word and that's what I I asked somebody recently uh I was talking to him about a decision they were making it I was I said what are you looking for what are you looking for and I I believe you know when when I I read this little scripture about the foolish versions I wonder what the foolish versions are looking for maybe that's why they're foolish because they don't have a revelation of what they should be looking for is it is it just to come into church you know brother Brown said Nicodemus thought that it would just be about uh that his how he washed the pots and pans and how you know how a couple girls that's that's the way the Israelites believe that you know they have everything kosher and they have everything they they believe their salvation in those orders and things but and brother Branham even explained that he that's the way he told his disciples that I'm sending you a comforter because he knew that if they were not prepared for that that they would continue on in the washing of the possum pans and things so what we're not we're not looking for just a uh a nice Social Gospel I picked up on we we had a nice conversation on the way of the ministry meeting and some of this is actually all for that conversation that some of the quotes I found I appreciate that I appreciate Bill Wayne and all the ministers because you know I'm I'm I'm standing on your shoulders and uh but now um are we just looking at what's the main thing the main focus will really govern Our Lives because you know you know you start off which way you start off determines whether you're going to end up on the Target or not let me uh I'm gonna jump to this quote real quick let's read this 1960 607 hearing receiving and acting I think it's about the fourth or fifth about the little little child I'll start reading at the part I didn't highlight as I said to you last night Mexico down there they built this beautiful city but they were so sure they was going to make it so glamorous with all the outside now the city's sitting backwards the big fine buildings are rocking back why they didn't get to that Foundation certainly not the foundation and now he talks about I heard a certain Minister the other day bring a little child to the phone or the microphone four or five of them and stood there after he said there was no such a thing as some great Bible teaching brought that little child there and took a salt shaker and throwed three drops of water on their head and said I baptized thee in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost and pass that little child on to be a member of the church not six months old yet why the poor little fella hasn't got a chance he got started on the wrong Foundation to begin with that's not even in the Bible that's a heathen trait it's not even in the scripture brother we'll never get started till we get on the foundation and start right build by the Holy Spirit upon the word of God that's exactly right no one in the Bible was ever sprinkled no such a thing the Greek word baptized means to be covered up buried hit away that's exactly right now he's talking about baptism but what he's really talking about is the foundation that's right where you where you lay the foundation how you get started because if you don't lay the foundation you can't even grow up the statue of a perfect man you can't he said be born again first and then grow start lay the foundation get everything get get that Foundation right and then you can start growing now how do you lay the foundation now I want to kind of use as an example that little um my notes straight here in First Kings chapter 17 because you know in in the Old Testament in and in the New Testament the whole scripture runs in continuity and the path to in to to to uh being part of Christ is laid all spoken of all through the scripture from from uh the beginning of Genesis from Abel's sacrifice all the way down to the end now now in First Kings chapter 17 that's when Elijah first comes on the scene and and he comes to a little widow woman's house that was looking for Elijah and he came to her home and he and we know the story he said give me can I have some water and she went to go get it and now there's the first thing she went she was doing it she was obeying she was obedience is better the sacrifice is what uh uh uh the prophet told um Samuel told Saul and so as soon as she went and turned to get that water he said bring me a little more silver bread and she said I don't have anything I don't have I I'm almost out of my my meal and my oil but he said but but uh we know the story she went ahead and made it anyway and and took the meal and the oil and mixed it together and made a cake and put it on the cross of her self-sacrifice I'm willing to do whatever it takes and you know brother Branham explained if you'll bring your little bit your empty meal and oil you drive on Wednesday night through the rain and the snow whatever it takes you bring that little bit you bring it to church and you get it filled up again you bring it you empty it it it becomes empty you bring it back again and you fill it up and you just keep filling it up you get you hear the word and the spirit comes and quickens it and makes it alive you hear the word and the spirit comes and quickens it and makes it alive and that pattern is repeated all through the scripture that you the word has to be sowed the word has to be sewn into your heart and then the spirit comes and quickens it now I I want to tell a little story this uh uh you know usually you don't want to quote names but uh I'll say I'm I'm 100 sure that I heard this right when I was a little a little child or a lot younger we were visiting brother Charlie Cox up in Kentucky and he told us that one time he was over uh brother Branham and some other brothers were were visiting over eaten and a brother started choking began to choke now uh us we would maybe call a paramedic does anybody know the Heimlich maneuver but have you ever wondered what would a prophet of God do how would a prophet of God handle that now go back to First Kings chapter 17 There Was Elijah on the scene and there was the meal and the oh now all the way up into the the 20th century here's Elijah again sitting at the table and he reaches over for the cornbread he gets the meal and gives it to the brother and immediately he stops choking because what does that meal represent that meal represents Christ it was ground and ground by that Burr until it every little piece was just ground up exactly the same because he was bruised for our iniquities he was he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed and you know brother Brown said if you've got that token that same life in you then you have a promise that your prayers will be answered he said if you don't have the token before you go pray get the token because if you don't have the token you don't have the promise you have a promise it's written in the Bible that these same things that were done in the first church age will be done by today because he's Hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever if you know if you go home driving home tonight and forget the rest of this Sermon Just remember that that that's my confession that he is still the same and if I if I can't have enough Faith to believe it I don't want to stand in anybody else's way to believe that he's still the same you I want to stand aside if I can't believe it and say come right on into the blessings and Promises of God because he's still the same his word is the same yesterday today and forever now now that same pattern that was there when Elijah got that little that little cake of bread that little that little uh piece of bread that same pattern is repeated all through the scripture because A sower went forth to sow we know the sower is Christ because if you're speaking if a preacher is speaking by a real Revelation that it's not him sowing it it's Christ in himself and you know let me I want to bring this out Paul said that I came not in word only I came to you not just in word only but in the power and the demonstration of the spirit now that's a scripture that a lot of people use to say well well when you say what are you looking for I'm looking for a church that has the power and the demonstration of a spirit now what does that mean does that mean a lot of a lot of emotion does that mean they have some awesome musicians does that mean that uh there's a a grand religious commotion going on or does that mean that the pastor hammers a lot on social conventions and things but I believe that you know if you run through what brother Branham said about power and I preached the sermon on power power is the Revelation when God gives you revelation of what's in the Bible then it gives you power over the devil it gives you power over yourself it gives you power to live a Godly life it gives you power to believe his word because you know it's true it gives you power that when you're when you're asking prayer it gives you power that you know who you're talking to it knows you you know who God is that there's only one God and that he's living inside of you that it gives you so when the gospel is it came not just in word only as Paul said he didn't come and just just open the church age book and begin to read I had a I had a professor in school that that would do that every day he got tired of the administration so he he said well I'll show him I'll just open up the textbook and just read but now now what if I did that what if I come up here with a message book and just read now that's coming in word only the letter of the word but I believe I hope that you want to hear my revelation of the word you want to hear the power the power and maybe that power that God has given me that that it will Quicken something in you and you'll say I know that's right now of course of course it's it's got to be quick and you you can hear the word and it won't be quick and maybe it'll be quicker than a week later a year later somewhere down the road but sooner or later that oil and that meal will come together and make a cake that'll give life and it'll produce something when God quickens his word to you and brings that power then that's how you're born all the way up you're you're born again and you keep eating you get the power of virtue and you get the power of knowledge you get the power of temperance and patience all the way up because you keep eating the word and eating the word and that's what Nicodemus was not looking at right he was looking at just a social convention just to uh I just want to go to church and sit in church and and partake in the worship service and partake in the atmosphere and and uh feel the spirit fill the spirit of God over there somewhere around me but I don't want to just feel the spirit I want the spirit of God to be inside of me to be to dwell inside of me and give me his power because if you just feel the spirit you cannot see the kingdom of God the only way you can see God's kingdom is that if he's living inside of you if that comforter is teaching you from the inside showing you things to come bringing things to your remembrance and brother Brandon explain it like this he said the Church of God will see the program of God the Church of God will see the program of God you know that gives you power when you can see what God where you're going when God gives you a revelation that it's one thing that when he gives you a revelation and maybe shows you who to marry or or where to work and things but when you can stand back and see and and the bride he's done something special for us he's shown us all the way out past the Battle of Gog and Magog I'll pass all way on out just way far you can see you can stand back and look and see the end past there's no end you can see on and on we ought to be the most grateful people in the world because of the things that God has shown us that that gives us power and it when you put the oil and the the meal together then you get stimulated by the stimulation of Revelation it'll make you walk different it'll make you act different it'll make you have a positive attitude let me read it let me read a quote here before I get ahead of Nicodemus let's go back to that first that first uh quote lean on not under thine own understanding why were these Pharisees blind what made them so blind now remember in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost Peter started off his sermon with ye men of Israel ye men of Israel who have been blinded because they would not accept Revelation or Vindication of the word and and let's go on and that's the reason today that the churches are blind is because they won't accept Revelation that's being Vindicated if the word says so and it's revealed and then is proven still they won't accept it and then he goes on that's the reason these Jews the Jews to this day will not you cannot talk to them about Christ because the veil is still over their face blinded and so forth but what about today and that's what he said the church the churches today are blind the churches did any uh we were riding in the car the other day and my wife was really touched by uh well I don't want to say too much but you know you you get grieved when you see you see people hungering and thirsting for the word and and their you know brother Brandon said they would eat the sloppers the god that eat whatever is available but if people are hungry and thirsty then uh well you know I believe that if you're hungry and thirsting bad enough you're gonna find it you're going to go out and figure out a way to get it you're going to do whatever it takes to get it if you have to drive four hours or uh every Sunday or or or find somebody online that that uh is preaching the truth right because you're going to be you're going to be looking for it that's one of the evidences of the new birth that he will lead and guide you into all truth he will lead you and and take you to where you need to be to hear it well I'm just speaking playing this this afternoon now I'm getting my nose mixed up but going back to the widows very fast in First Kings chapter 17. now one of the things that you do when you when you hear the truth there's a little component in there that you've got to do what it says you've got to obey it and now all through scripture that that theme is repeated when Jesus comes up to an invalid and says take up thy bed and walk what if they don't many times you're here on the prayer line brother Brandon will say lady there the pillar of fire is Over You Stand Up and she obviously doesn't stand up because he'll say the pillar of fires move to somebody else you got to seize that opportunity and do exactly what the word says God wants us to obey him what uh remember that story I I read um I'm trying to think the brother in England that told the story of uh a brother in his congregation that he finally convinced that he needed to be baptized but yet he wouldn't go do it now that's the formula if you repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then you have a promise if you just keep hanging on hang on and continue on right in in faith believing the promise is to you and to your children even as far off as many as many as the Lord Our God shall call The Promise is to the just obey that promise right and and what about when he was at the talking to the woman at the well and he says go bring your husband of course she couldn't do that what if she what if she told a little field but she she said well I I I've got uh what was it five or so and and then Naaman Elijah told him go down and dip seven times in the River Jordan the old muddy nasty River Jordan a lot of times God will you know what it's it's scary a lot of times the the truth is a little bit scary to fully Embrace and and and and that's what brother Branham explained when he was talking about the Nicodemus story is that Nicodemus was afraid it's scary right it's scary until you get the new birth you don't want to go tell anybody you don't want anybody to know what you believe yeah you don't want you don't want anybody to find out that that you don't believe that all these things are wrong why are you why are you dressing this way why why don't y'all go to these different events and social things and why don't y'all participate oh I don't want anybody to find out but let the spirit of God come in you and like Elijah in job 32 said when the spirit there's a spirit in man it gives knowledge when the Breath of God comes upon you it makes you act different it'll make you walk different and talk different in Acts 2 38 now see you gotta you gotta get that meal first and Acts 2 38 you say well I was thinking about this where how did Peter know to say the formula repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well the word had been sown right right he was sitting around one day and and Jesus said be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost what now you can just the word Paul said I didn't come with just the word only if you come with the word only oh my we'll be a little bit mixed up you know a lot of things in the scripture look like they're they're they're they're a little off and that's what brother Wade was bringing that real out a lot is that is it revelation is our absolute amen because there's a lot of things that have come out of the Bible and there's a lot of things that have come out of the message if you say the message is your absolute well then what about the two Souls people and all the polygamies and things that it seems like is coming out of the message it seems like Jesus said you should be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost but that word was quickened when that Spirit came in when the oil came in and Peter came out with a real Revelation I know who the father-son and Holy Ghost is that's the Lord Jesus Christ and that's who you've got to be baptized in his name right and and and they took on when they took on that life that name was represented in them that's why you know we when we pray of our fruit we pray in his name it's not just tacking something on at the end of the prayer but it's praying and the power and the revelation of who he is of your personal revelation when God you know there's a lot of yeah I you know the Holy Ghost will make you dress right and act right but you know God put the law first before Grace put the law first to show us that we're wrong that we're not right and then he gave us Grace because he knew he gave us an unconditional Covenant I know you can't keep everything right now when you hear somebody preaching on clothes and dressing things that should that should prick a real Christian believer whoa let me go find out about that that's right let me go see if that's true or not right see if I'm not right and brother Branham there are many sermons where he would he would really get on the people about about dressing wrong and doing those things and and it comes back to obedience will I uh because what he said I you only have to tell a real holy ghost-filled woman right one time one time because that word in her will toe the line it'll straighten up real quick real quick because it wants to be just right have everything just in line that little Holy Spirit in there so me contempting to get grieved and when it gets green you start feeling real sorrowful something's not right and you got to run quickly back to the word back get in line it'll straighten you right up what about that I I I just wrote a little note down about that that man when Jesus was calling him and and and and preaching to him and he said well I can't follow you because I got to go bury my father well let the dead bury their dead oh that seems harsh that seems but but when there's a pearl of great price there you'll drop everything and run after it you'll drop all your own ideas and and that's what we hold so dear as we we hold our own ideas so dear well I think I think the the minister should preach real sweet and soft I I I I think he should just you know stroke my fur just the right way I think when I come the the musicians should have all this just right and I I'm going to come to church with a great big loud opinion and tell everybody but you know uh you know God the Holy Spirit isn't me contentment why why wouldn't it make our spirit me contempt as we're growing more and more like him we want to be like him be like Jesus well I'm getting off a little bit but let me so the way that we're born again is the same way that we grow and I mentioned this as a Minister's meeting I read this little scripture is over there in Exodus 25 and I might have preached on this one time uh if if I did then you just get to hear it again in Exodus 25 verses 8 through 9 it says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it now we know brother Brown talked a lot about a pattern and he said the pattern is Christ how he laid the pattern over and and it has the the ones that will go when the Rapture match that pattern because they're part of the pattern and he talked about uh you know you can run that pattern all the way back to Genesis 1 26 27 that everything everything that's part of the pattern one day will be that pattern is coming to Earth and and so you got to start from that pattern in in the Masterpiece sermon he was he said God starts from a pattern that's the way any good Builder works is is and those are brother Brandon's words I I really don't know much about building but I believe it's true that how can you start a house or a skyscraper without uh without first having a pattern a thing to work from and the pattern that he started from was himself was the word that he brought down to earth and that same pattern now that was a big question is how you know that question did Brother Brennan change the way that you get the new birth further along in his ministry well now if the pattern is is the same from the beginning to the end from Genesis to Revelation right right then the way that you get into Christ is it stays the same that when he was on the cross and and out of his side came water blood and spirit that showed the pattern and the pattern does a change it doesn't change just because we fail to read a few messages and the pattern is the same because he's the same the pattern is still to be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit in that pattern just repeats itself all the way up taking us further and further up the growth process but the real way that that to sum it all up the way we go up the way we grow the way we're born again is by his word that's what Nicodemus fail to recognize you know that little Foundation there brother around talked about in the Masterpiece how he he laid the foundation in the Old Testament with Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and he said that Foundation was the Masterpiece right this is the foundation you get the new birth that's the Masterpiece but that's not the end of the Masterpiece it keeps growing it keeps growing and growing the prophets the prophets in the Old Testament laid the fact they wrote in the Bible it was written what was coming their lives wrote it was written in the Bible that the word The Headstone was coming and and now he said wouldn't it be what if we could speak what was written of us and say who can accuse me of sin what a thing to say to say exactly the same thing that was written of you written of you doubt being fulfilled today in the New Testament by his word and that's the that's that's the theme don't get lost here if I get a little bit carried away now in the Old Testament it was written about Joseph was was typing the Life of Christ how he was sold for 30 almost 30 pieces and and sold in in the boundaries and his whole life was all just a type of Christ and type in the perfect anti-type and Saul and Solomon where he said obedience is better than the sacrifice David the rejected King desired to build a temple desired to have a place where God could come down from that pattern and dwell in Earth and one day that pattern was was moving on over to where one day Jesus himself walked into that pattern into that Tabernacle you know what he found there was was it wasn't Sanctified they were doing uh you know that Tabernacle is a type of a human body it's a type of us and when he came into the Tabernacle he found that it wasn't clean and so he took off he took whips and and and began to drive out the money changers and things because God won't come to an unclean vessel first it's got to be Sanctified and purified and the word came to his Temple and found it to be unclean and the Word was there cleaning it out that's how you if you want to get uh get things out of your out of your house get rid of a demon get rid of something that's not there bring the word in and it will it will take care of it amen ah Daniel saw uh saw the the Redemption of Israel job saw a redeemer all out Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and then finally we get down to Mary and we're talking about the word and an angel came to her and said a child is going to be born to you and what was her response it was be it unto me according to Thy Word so that the word could be made manifest you know you talk about angels and and hair and dress you know the Bible says that that a woman's hair is is on her head for is her power because you you know what that signifies it signifies that she has heard from the angels and she's received a revelation right right and she believes what the angels have said and it's changed the way she acts the way she dresses when you go around and you go to Walmart and and and that message that you're wearing on your head that shows you believe is a it's a message to all the other whenever my wife gets around the homeschool people and the the different people that uh in the little homeschool groups it's like you can always tell that the people act different because they're convicted they'll start they'll start wearing dresses and and which brother around himself is a good sign it's a bad sign when they when they just don't care but when there's something inside when they're convicted they they'd uh you know they uh they want to they want to change their appearance when they're around you that's that's a good sign well I'm getting off a little bit again but let me go back and and uh because we're talking about down down through the the Old Testament and through the new God is building himself a body by his word and so that's why it's so important for us to listen to the you know we talk we talk so much about coming to church but I think maybe an even greater struggle than coming to church coming to church is one of the basic things right we come to church on Wednesday night and whenever whenever the doors are open but an even greater struggle maybe is finding time in your own personal life to sit and open up the Bible and and get along with God and and that's that's really uh I just want to speak words of encouragement to you to to set aside time because you remember in that third pool when the angel came and said uh isn't this the the things that are done in secret will be made open the the the your private time talking about your your prayer life your prayer closet that's what's so important where you when you have a a private time of a private real relationship with God it'll be made known openly so let's let's look at some scriptures in First Peter 1 22-25 seeing you have this kind of sums up everything we've been talking about seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brother now you say I love the Lord but he said if you love me you'll obey my Commandments unto unfane love of the brothers see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently you know it really does help I used to be so backwards I still am backwards in a lot of ways but but I I really enjoy fellowshipping with brothers and sisters it it really helps to you know when when you have somebody that you can call on to pray and and uh somebody to help bear the load and you know when you when you kind of uh mess up or whatever or you know sometimes you you don't feel like going to the fellowship meeting or whatever and somebody one of the brothers will call you up and what's wrong with you you know they give you a little a little a little helpful uh nudge along because we need one another you know I we'll get these complexes and things built up and and we'll try to make ourselves isolationist and and I believe that's wrong we shouldn't we shouldn't uh I mean to be honest that's one of the things that I I fight is is is making myself taking myself off to myself and and I'm just going to deal with my problem myself and but you know we we shouldn't do that we shouldn't obey and obeying the truth of the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently we went to a fellowship meeting one time and uh Jonathan Jones he just said pro ball I'm so glad to see you and he just pulled put his arms around me you know that that's how we should all all be we should just uh when we see one another just really not putting on a show but make each other feel welcome being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth an abideth River why for All Flesh is as grass right right and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower of the roof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever so how do we hear the word and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you because Romans 10 13 says or 10 14 10 13 10 14. how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how should they preach except there be sin as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but these are the best things how the gospel is so wonderful when you hear about what God has done for you are the are the feet of them the priests these Good Tidings beautiful to you in First Corinthians 4 15 he says for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel in James 1 18 it says of his own will beget he us with the word of Truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures in John 1 12 he says but as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God he gave power to become the sons of God you know even Abel had back in the Old Testament when they didn't even have the Holy Ghost they got a little bit a little bit of of the revelation to carry them through right and that gave him power he gave Abel power when he knew exactly what to do to bring a sacrifice right right he knew exactly he didn't have to guess I wonder if this is the right way and as Cain laughed maybe at all the blood and everything as he dragged it up there he took it up and I knew I knew exactly what I'm doing right David knew exactly what he was doing when he came and fought Goliath because he had power and I'm repeating myself because I want you to remember I I don't want us you know so many times we leave the service and and not even really remember what the preacher said but but power comes by Revelation amen amen so you know when you're driving or work next week think think on these things about how the word is so important because it gives you power over your flesh it gives you power over the devil it gives you power you know when you when you put your hand on somebody and pray for him or I'll pray with it for him without even putting your hands on him you're doing that because you God has given you power right he's giving you a revelation that's the way that you know whenever brother Brown did that a lot of times he would say in obedience to your word he would he would he would put it this is my phrase and he would put it back on God I'm doing exactly what you told me to do now let's see it come to pass just like Elisha came up to that River he said I bet I saw Elijah I did I did exactly what he said if you if you see me go up and he got to that River and he said where is the god of Elijah how many times maybe you feel like that in your life but you know you know that that listen to that sermon be certain of God when you've done everything that you can do when you have obeyed him and you believe him then he will come on the scene and that's been my personal experience when things when when I got laid off and there was nobody uh hiring anywhere and it seemed like there was a horrible burden on my shoulders and I got out in the garage and would pray until until the burden lifted and the burden come back I'd go out in the garage and pray a little bit more pray all night pray all weekend that was my job that became my job because you know you gotta something's something's got to give you know God makes us desperate sometimes he'll bring us through trials and troubles and tribulations and things and that grows us into his character into His Image because we learned to trust him we learn to believe him that he is able that he's still the same yesterday today and forever a lot of times trials don't seem very fun at first like that that little Widow but then Elijah came and gave her a message and she believed it and obeyed it and out of that trial came a great testimony I can you imagine what she was able to tell her friends you you wouldn't believe what God did I didn't have any oil I didn't have any meal but a messenger came on the scene and I believed his word and I stayed right with him and and believed him all the way through that's that's my testimony all the way through I believe it because I knew that his words were precious his word was true he I I found the pearl of great price now you know that that recipe of obedience is how you get the token because brother random said full obedience entitles you to the Token exactly I've done everything that's required and all the way through your journey he never takes away your free moral latency I think I think maybe that's word Nicodemus you know he went through he heard the word you know the next time he was mentioned was over in Acts 19 where he was they were putting Jesus into the ground they were covering him with anointing oil and things and then you don't hear about him anymore what went wrong what goes wrong in the foolish virgin's life what what don't they see let's read that second quote why I'm against organized relation and I'm gonna I'm gonna be closing in just a second here so y'all don't get too tired on me but like like Jesus when he was telling his disciples can't you stay awake well I love you I hope you love me too and he said why I'm against organized religion in 1962 he said um Nicodemus knew that he knew about life now now see I I believe that's what a lot of people in churches today are really interested in about life right but what about eternal life about about uh social conventions and politics and and what kind of flowers we got in the church and that kind of thing but that's not what's gonna that you know the signs and the Wonders were not what took Israel through their Journey it was the word it was the revealed word that took them through it was the pill or fire Nicodemus knew that he knew about life but he never knew that he was eternal life that's what the man that he was talking to the messenger the light of the day the light of the world the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not he was sent to his own in his own received do not why why because they were so organized set up with washing pots and pans and traditions that they failed to see the word made flesh let's go to that next one I'm just going to read through a few of these just to kind of I I I I think I always say this every time I preach it everything I say he's got to dovetail with what brother Branham said because he was the messenger to the age um why I'm against organized religion this is the same sermon neither did korra's great understanding mean anything or Adams each denying God's Vindicated message now let's listen closely now we're going to get in some high waters in a minute see each one of them the reason that they got in trouble Nicodemus Cora Nimrod and so forth is because they didn't recognize God's messenger with the Vindicated word of that day and then he says now anyone knows that wow let's go to the next one as I was with Moses so I will be with thee now Moses when he had signs he went down and performed those signs but the sign isn't the thing that took them to the promised land right it wasn't the signs it was the Vindication of the commission and the Rahab believed it without seeing anything she said that we're all trembling no wonder Nicodemus said Rabbi we know thou art a teacher come from God no man can do these things unless God was with him we all know it the world knows it today the world knows it but why why aren't where is T.L Osborne where are all the ones that that saw the signs and the Wonders but fell away to the Wayside ah or didn't recognize the pearl of great price right now you know we say I I recognize the Pearl a great price I'm sitting in a message Church I'm sitting here listening but are we like Nicodemus right that heard Jesus preach that heard the word and stayed with him right up to his burial and then said well well things aren't aren't going so good now people are leaving the message right and left I I heard somebody say well it seems like a lot of message preachers are ignoring that people are leaving uh or or uh are are not concerned or whatnot you know everybody has a free moral latency you can't control but I I'm until until the Rapture comes at as long as there's Grace left I'm still concerned about the salvation of people I'm concerned about my neighbor I'm concerned if he'll keep kicking again against the pricks I as long as I have an opportunity I'll keep tossing it over I'm concerned about the foolish virgin I'm concerned because uh you know they are aversion and and if they would I believe if if there was a chance they could just recognize the pearl of great price recognize how true it is and and get a personal relationship with with Jesus and maybe spend some time listening to the tapes instead of just taking somebody else's word for it spend some time digging into the Bible hearing receiving and acting 1960. I heard a certain Minister the other day bring a little oh I already read that let's get there without in just a few more minutes y'all don't get too tired on me sir we would see Jesus but everything that we do or say must be based upon the word of God because no man can have faith unless it comes from the word of God Amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word now if I told you that a certain certain thing would take place that might be so it might do that and if I tell you that something that seems impossible that it happened that it could happen but when God has promised this thing then you can have confidence that God keeps his word there's where my faith is built on nothing less than the Eternal Word of the Eternal God here's a good one you must be born again 1961. now this is the one where the first time he preached uh uh Dr Davis he thought he'd done such a wonderful job because he's made the old sisters cry and everything Dr Davis told him he told this is what he told him uh in 1961 12 31 he said yes they cry funerals cry bursts everything else he said what is what it is Billy you never quoted one bit of God's word you talked about some mother that had been going on or something like this and got everybody crying said you're not born again upon things and sensations of this Earth you're born by the word Hallelujah let me kind of find a find another weird one real quick ah looking at the Unseen 1959 April 10th now if God can come on the control tower and when the my sheep know my voice well now if these all these strange voices in the world of this social gospel that just belonged to church and that's all is necessary why hasn't it done something it's done nothing but confused the people right right what we need tonight is Unified Church filled with the Holy Ghost and power from on high led by the spirit of the Living God on the control tower that won't say because I'm a Baptist and he's a Methodist I'll have nothing to do with him and and he goes on but it's done nothing but confused the people right right and if I could speak plainly I think message people today are are very confused but you know there is still a man that can turn on a light I I think many times people take other people's word for what brother Brandon says and you know what's striking that today on you know you can find just anything on the internet and now the messages on the internet you can get it on your phone I can search the message and highlight things and bookmark things on my way to work and yeah we won't read it we won't study it so that's maybe where I want to close is is study study God's word and prove it and see what's in there because brother Branham said that faith is designed to see what God wills and wants right when you get the new birth you know exactly what God wills and wants what he wants you to do where he wants you to go how he wants you to live and what's far off in your life Journey Let's uh let's let's stand our feet and I'm just I'm just going to close there do you love the Lord are you grateful for his word I'm just gonna um I'm just gonna pray real quick and then I'll turn him back over to brotherdale if you have a need just lift your hand up and I believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still able to meet our need and give us what we have need of Lord God we're so grateful to you Lord Jesus for your grace to us and for your word thank you God for your many blessings Lord Jesus I pray God as the people go home that they'll not forget the things that were spoken tonight Lord Jesus but it'll feed their soul and they'll Lord you'll bring these things to their remembrance Lord and show them things to come Lord we thank you Lord God for your grace and your mercy Lord and Lord I pray God as you look down upon this scene Lord and see all the hands lifted up with special needs Lord that you'll come upon the scene Lord and Quicken the word they've heard give them power of Revelation Lord to know that you're still on the scene to heal and deliver and to fill the Holy Ghost Lord if there's any Lord that don't know you in the experience and that with with the token with this real personal experience of a living God lord I pray maybe tonight when they go home Lord maybe they'll kneel by their bedside and say Lord God I want to know you I want to know more about you I want to have that comforter in me that will teach me that will let me see the kingdom of God because without you lord Jesus we we wouldn't know anything Lord Jesus without you we'd be lost we'd be groping in darkness we'd be blind Lord God we're so grateful to you Lord Jesus for opening your word Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll just bless the ones that are are traveling on the way home who Lord bless us tomorrow as we journey down to mobile and brother Wade and sister June and all the other ones Lord Jesus and God give us traveling mercies and we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace thank you God for your word thank you for your truth because we know that your truth will set us free in your name we pray amen like he said whatever starts in Genesis must wind up in Revelation it can't change you can't have something here and something different there it's got to come out the same because he's the same amen anybody have a knee holders open just come and let's believe and see because I believe that God will back up his word it's done too late now to try to tell me he won't could have done seen him do it and I believe he'll keep on doing it don't you be free there's my heart in the blood you have a need coming let's see in the precious see his word is true forever settled in heaven can't change that's why we can depend on it no matter what day we're living in he's the same Wonderful Life you see the power of God is the revelation of God the revealed word the gospel the scripture said is the power of God under salvation so just believe in it accepting it take
