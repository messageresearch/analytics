[0:10] there we go um we had a wonderful time
[0:13] at The Minister's meeting yesterday
[0:15] praise God I mean it was really good I
[0:18] mean it was we had I really really
[0:21] enjoyed
[0:22] it and uh and a couple times I thought a
[0:26] Revival's about to break
[0:28] out but um yeah we had
[0:31] uh I I think I think a lot I I just so
[0:35] many good things were said and so many
[0:37] little nuggets that you can just take
[0:38] and and pack away with you but I thought
[0:41] this morning I could just take the topic
[0:43] and that we were looking at and and just
[0:45] kind of study it out and meditate on it
[0:48] so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[0:49] God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:51] gather around your word
[0:53] today I pray God that you'll prepare our
[0:55] hearts Lord for what you have in store
[0:56] for us help us Lord that you'll
[0:59] strengthen us through your word to
[1:01] express these things in our lives Lord
[1:03] Jesus to give us power over the enemy I
[1:06] pray God that you'll just be with us
[1:07] today we pray in your name
[1:10] amen so the the thought that we were
[1:12] meditating on yesterday was um about the
[1:15] gene seed and so um just just to maybe I
[1:21] I just really slowly go through some of
[1:24] these thoughts
[1:26] um uh somebody yesterday made a point
[1:29] that you you know really
[1:31] to the the message warrants us really
[1:35] sitting alone and thinking about
[1:38] things you've got to really just carve
[1:40] out time to think about these things and
[1:42] just meditate on it or or you're really
[1:45] not going to get anywhere um it's it's
[1:48] just really not sufficient to just come
[1:49] to church and and for an hour you you
[1:53] hear things and that that would be
[1:54] enough but uh you really got to for
[1:57] these things to really be Quicken to us
[1:59] you've got to sit and think about it and
[2:03] so that's what I want to do maybe for
[2:04] the next 20 minutes or so and and I'll
[2:06] try to leave some time for the musicians
[2:08] to come up here and kind of have a nice
[2:09] segue so um but just take our time and
[2:12] just think about some of these some of
[2:14] these
[2:15] thoughts so in Romans 9:13 it says at is
[2:18] as it is
[2:20] written Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[2:23] I
[2:25] hated and then Genesis 25:23 and and
[2:28] Romans is actually quoting from Malachi
[2:31] but um Genesis 25 tells us that story
[2:33] where the Lord said un uh their their
[2:35] mom do two nations are in thy womb and
[2:38] two manner of people shall be separated
[2:40] from thy bowels and the one people shall
[2:42] be stronger than the other and the Elder
[2:44] Shall Serve the younger now you think
[2:46] about the nature the let's take a think
[2:48] about the nature of God that he knew in
[2:51] advance he already had the thought of
[2:54] what was happening what was going to
[2:57] happen and so he' already he could
[2:59] already say say Jacob have I loved but
[3:02] Esau have I hated why that seems like an
[3:05] unfair statement to make doesn't it
[3:07] before they're even born God has already
[3:09] decided I love Jacob but not
[3:12] Esau why is
[3:15] that and you think all the all the way
[3:17] down bring it all the way down here
[3:18] there's been people in every age where
[3:20] he was like I I love that
[3:23] person and it's based on their
[3:26] response that God could look at and you
[3:30] God can look all the way down through
[3:32] time and see everything that's going to
[3:34] unfold and see your reaction and another
[3:37] words he's he's he's looking at you he
[3:39] he knows you so that's that's what we
[3:42] want to just Ponder is that God knew you
[3:44] God knew Jacob and God knows you God
[3:48] knows everything about you he knews
[3:50] everything about
[3:51] everything and um I was really just
[3:54] sitting pondering this morning that we
[3:56] we try to express with our little peanut
[3:59] brain
[4:00] these these things are almost past
[4:03] understanding how a God that passes our
[4:06] understanding we're try to articulate
[4:08] these things but to think how how can we
[4:11] are even articulate that before we'll
[4:12] say before the foundation of the world
[4:15] but but but before there was anything
[4:17] before there was anything at all that
[4:18] was expressed God knew you yes God knew
[4:22] how many times you would bat your eye
[4:24] how many times that you would how many
[4:26] times you'd pray how many times you'd
[4:28] come to church and and whether or not
[4:30] you wanted to go to church and he knew
[4:32] whether or not You' want the the word he
[4:34] knew you yes he knew
[4:38] you so he knew
[4:41] Jacob and Jacob was in his
[4:44] thoughts and and maybe that the thought
[4:46] that we're trying to get here is that
[4:47] that that the life that we're living
[4:49] right
[4:50] now is the thought that God had before
[4:52] the foundation of the world that's right
[4:55] that's what Peter was expressing on the
[4:57] day of Pentecost when he said this is
[5:00] that this is I'm identifying this right
[5:03] here with that that God thought of
[5:06] before the foundation of the world and
[5:07] he expressed it in Joel that I'm going
[5:10] to pour my spirit out on our flesh and
[5:13] so forth and so we can I when we begin
[5:15] to identify ourself how do how do we
[5:18] identify with oursel with the with with
[5:20] the thought is we look into the
[5:22] expression of the thought the word of
[5:25] God and we identify our life with the
[5:29] the word of God with all these stories
[5:32] with all these other Expressions it's
[5:34] like looking in a mirror and you begin
[5:36] to identify and you begin to
[5:38] recognize that where I am right now
[5:41] matches up with God's
[5:43] thought and and that that some of the
[5:46] brothers had some really really
[5:48] wonderful things to say about how
[5:51] identification is what gives you power
[5:53] it gives you uh Jesus was able to um
[5:56] that's what gave him power of the devil
[5:58] cuz he knew who he was
[6:01] and when you begin to identify yourself
[6:03] back but let's let's meditate
[6:06] on think about think about the nature of
[6:09] God that God is infinite yes he's all
[6:15] knowing he knows now this is where it
[6:18] almost blows our mind to think about it
[6:20] he
[6:20] knows everything yes
[6:25] everything he knows how many time the N
[6:28] is going to B it's he knows he knows
[6:31] what you're thinking right now he knows
[6:34] how many time you're going to tap times
[6:36] you're going to tap your toe and that's
[6:38] why that's why he could know that Jacob
[6:42] was going to Value the birthright over
[6:45] the Len soup that Esau would rather take
[6:47] Len soup over the
[6:49] birthright you think about that's
[6:52] unfathomable that Esau not know what the
[6:54] birthright
[6:56] was same thing today people not know
[7:01] what the gospel
[7:02] brings and yet he knows he knew Jacob's
[7:06] reaction and he knows your reaction yes
[7:10] he knows he knows whether you want it or
[7:13] not he's infinite he is all knowing even
[7:17] before the foundations of The World God
[7:19] knew every action am and decision of
[7:23] every
[7:26] individual now you know maybe maybe to
[7:28] frame up four knowledge I think I used
[7:30] to I I I would look at it as like God's
[7:33] looking at every possible action you
[7:35] could take if it was presented
[7:36] differently this way or that way then
[7:38] you know he's looking at all the
[7:39] different permutations but really he I
[7:41] think brother Brandon framed it up as
[7:44] he's looking at you as an
[7:46] individual and he knew that no matter
[7:49] where he put you whether it was
[7:53] uh whether it was in on the rack in the
[7:56] Middle
[7:57] Ages or whether it was in a
[8:00] Coliseum or a lion's den or a fiery
[8:04] furnace no matter where it put you that
[8:06] you would always respond to the
[8:08] word no matter where he put you and
[8:10] that's um I I use the
[8:14] example brother BR said if you want to
[8:16] see how you would have responded in any
[8:18] other age then look how you respond in
[8:21] this age so if he took you and
[8:24] transplanted you into the days of Martin
[8:26] Luther or the days of John Wesley or the
[8:29] zza Street or wherever he put you he
[8:31] knew you and he knew if you would
[8:36] respond now that's getting into for we
[8:39] got to understand forn knowledge to
[8:40] understand predestination because
[8:41] predestination is based on forn
[8:43] knowledge he's looking down through time
[8:45] to see
[8:46] you amen are you going to want it enough
[8:50] right are you going to want it enough to
[8:51] persevere through um Through Fire and
[8:55] furnace and like the Believers in the
[8:57] Middle Ages did put them on the ice
[8:59] sheet in the middle of winter but they
[9:01] wanted it enough to not give up and he
[9:05] knows and and and it's it's a because he
[9:08] can look down through time and know you
[9:11] it's an immutable thought that can never
[9:15] change now that's how substantial this
[9:18] thought is that he it's not like God is
[9:21] having a different idea I think that if
[9:24] this happens then we this will happen
[9:26] it's it's an immutable unchanging
[9:29] thought it's an eternal thought because
[9:32] God's thoughts are Eternal so that means
[9:35] that God always thought about you if you
[9:39] are going to come to life he always
[9:41] thought about you you are always a
[9:43] integral part of his thoughts that's
[9:45] right so God is infinite and and he
[9:49] exists Without Limits yes this is
[9:53] another thing that's really hard for our
[9:54] little peanut brains to comprehend but
[9:56] he exists outside of time so he never
[9:59] had a beginning and he never had an
[10:01] ending he's never going to have an
[10:02] ending so that's where we can we we can
[10:06] have confidence yes that he sees he sees
[10:09] all the way down through the string of
[10:11] time forever and ever and ever he knows
[10:13] everything that will ever happen yes sir
[10:16] everything that ever did happen and
[10:18] everything that ever will
[10:20] happen and that's why he can he know
[10:23] that's how he can know you and and and
[10:26] uh and we can place the thought that he
[10:28] had of of us in such a it's such a firm
[10:32] foundation that there's it it how can we
[10:35] even express it there's no changing to
[10:38] that thought in other
[10:40] words if I could be bold Bob black was
[10:43] always in his
[10:44] mind and you were always in his mind yes
[10:47] sir he always knew you he always knew
[10:50] that you were going to want it just like
[10:52] Jacob amen and God cannot make
[10:56] mistakes he can't grow any wiser
[11:00] or improve over time because he's
[11:02] already perfect in every
[11:05] sense there's no there's no there's no
[11:09] changing there's no well it it would be
[11:12] a better decision if I'd go with Esau
[11:15] over Jacob or in this case no it's just
[11:17] constant he knows
[11:22] Jacob if he could
[11:25] change advance or correct himself he
[11:29] would not be
[11:33] infinite and God is eternal which means
[11:35] that anything that had a beginning must
[11:37] have an end but God never had a
[11:39] beginning and so he has no end he exists
[11:43] beyond the boundaries of time like
[11:45] brother BR said he never begin he never
[11:48] will end
[11:51] amen God is omnipotent omnipresent and
[11:55] omniscient he knows all things all
[11:57] places all times all all powerful he is
[12:00] aware and I'm going to get to it I know
[12:02] probably some of y'all thinking Omni
[12:03] presentent hold on a second he is aware
[12:07] of every
[12:09] event thought and action in the universe
[12:13] yes he's aware of
[12:15] everything you can go on the moon and he
[12:18] knows how many times the astronaut is
[12:19] going to step his foot on the moon he
[12:21] knows he knows how many times
[12:23] everybody's going to take a breath I to
[12:25] think about that that he knows
[12:27] everything about everybody
[12:29] and that is how he can
[12:31] predestinate that is how he can know he
[12:34] can know how to set things in order
[12:36] because he knew Jacob at that
[12:39] level and brother Brandon would say he's
[12:42] omnipresent because he's omniscient he
[12:45] knows everything because he's infinite
[12:47] being infinite makes him
[12:48] omnipresent so now he's he's because
[12:51] he's a being that next quote he's not
[12:53] like the wind he is a being he's he's a
[12:56] being so he's not omnipresent in that
[12:59] sense but because he knows
[13:02] everything it's it it gives him that
[13:04] same quality of being there because he
[13:06] knows it he knows
[13:11] everything his infinite knowledge allows
[13:14] him to be fully aware
[13:16] of and present in knowledge to
[13:21] everything happening in his creation
[13:24] yes so he know he knows about your pet
[13:27] that just died or he knows about your
[13:30] children he knows about every single
[13:32] situation he knows about that little
[13:34] this little critter here that um how
[13:36] many times it's going to Blink its eyes
[13:38] and when it's going to metamorphose into
[13:40] its next stage and how many of those
[13:42] little pollen things it's going to eat
[13:43] or whatever it is he knows
[13:46] everything and he cannot make a
[13:48] mistake when God acts his decisions are
[13:52] Eternal and cannot
[13:55] change if God has ever called on the
[13:57] scene to make a decision on something
[13:59] brother Ram said his next decision has
[14:01] to be the same
[14:02] thing and every decision he ever makes
[14:05] thereafter has to be the
[14:09] same and you can use that to actually
[14:12] actually discern and and understand God
[14:15] and interact with God because if he if
[14:17] he gave something to somebody in a
[14:20] particular situation you can put
[14:23] everything you can put all your
[14:24] confidence that you if you can approach
[14:26] him in the same way
[14:29] you can get the same thing right if
[14:32] somebody else got the holy ghost or
[14:34] somebody else got healing you come the
[14:36] same way because if he acted one way to
[14:38] somebody else he's got to act the same
[14:41] way to you if you approach approach him
[14:44] with faith the same way he's going to
[14:47] respond the same
[14:49] way and he cannot
[14:51] change now really what we're talking
[14:53] about is
[14:55] identification that you know you can
[14:57] look and see that God is going to always
[14:59] always manifest himself the same way
[15:01] he's going to behave the same way
[15:04] because he cannot change in every age he
[15:07] manifests himself with the same
[15:09] characteristics his nature is the same
[15:12] his thoughts are the same and what are
[15:13] we talking about really the thoughts are
[15:16] expressed now in you and I and the
[15:19] thoughts are like the genes of God that
[15:23] are expressing in us and you so you can
[15:25] recognize God moving in a congregation
[15:28] or in someone's life because of those
[15:31] characteristics and the nature expressed
[15:34] in that individual or in a church or in
[15:36] the congregation and those same
[15:39] characteristics will be expressed in the
[15:42] bride in this last day how do we know
[15:45] cuz he's always the same he's the same
[15:48] in every age he acts the same way and
[15:52] when he was walking on the shores of G
[15:54] Galilee as the son of man he's going he
[15:57] acts the same way that he will when he's
[15:59] manifested as the son of man in the here
[16:02] in the end time he cannot change that's
[16:05] right and what is the manifestation of
[16:08] the son of man it's manifesting the
[16:10] thoughts the genes of God the thought
[16:14] that he had before the foundation of the
[16:15] world it's actually expressing those
[16:18] thoughts just like he had a thought
[16:21] about Jacob and that thought was
[16:23] expressed and now those same thoughts
[16:25] are being expressed
[16:27] here right it's for knowledge know what
[16:30] you would
[16:32] do now think about that millions of eons
[16:37] of time ago before you could even
[16:40] quantify it as some kind of an element
[16:41] of time that God knew what you would do
[16:45] and that's what for knowledge is yes go
[16:47] back back back as far as far back as you
[16:49] can go before there was even anything
[16:52] and
[16:53] already God knew what you would do yes
[16:57] there's a quote where brother R said
[16:58] today God knew that I would be standing
[17:00] behind the pulpit yes sir and he knew
[17:02] that you would be sitting out there in
[17:04] the Pew and he knew just like he knew
[17:07] Jacob he knew whether you would have
[17:09] wanted or not and that's what he's
[17:11] basing predestination on he knows if you
[17:14] want it then your whole that makes the
[17:17] everything change your whole life is
[17:19] structured in a different way CU he
[17:20] knows he knows in advance that you're
[17:23] going to want it and so he can
[17:25] predestinate he can have a preacher
[17:27] there right when you're going to hear it
[17:28] he can have uh uh even so much as
[17:33] breeding this one to this one down down
[17:37] to make sure that you come because he
[17:40] knows you're going to want it his for
[17:43] knowledge knowed what you would do so
[17:46] for knowledge speaks to God's omniscient
[17:49] ability to know the future before it
[17:52] ever
[17:54] happens I think he he knows about
[17:57] trolley cars he knows about every stage
[17:59] of mankind he knows about the invention
[18:02] of the locomotive and and Astron not
[18:04] knows but knew he knew all of that would
[18:08] unfold
[18:10] right God for and his forn knowledge
[18:12] allows him to understand people's
[18:15] characters now this is where we're
[18:16] getting at
[18:18] Jacob his forn knowledge allows him to
[18:21] understand people's characters their
[18:22] inclinations and their responses to
[18:24] Divine
[18:26] matters even before they are born
[18:29] now what we're getting at is I I it
[18:32] seems like we're belaboring the point
[18:33] but but God knew you and that made you a
[18:38] thought in God's mind an eternal thought
[18:41] something that an inescapable thought
[18:44] yeah like he because he knew you there's
[18:46] no running away from it he knew he knew
[18:49] you and he knew you would come to it and
[18:51] so now now you can you're living this
[18:55] life where the life of God has been
[18:58] manifested in you and you are the living
[19:00] embodiment of that thought the thought
[19:03] that God thought about is expressed in
[19:05] you now it's actually expressed and and
[19:09] it's and how is it
[19:11] expressed because a a word is a thought
[19:14] expressed
[19:16] right so we can say that the thought
[19:19] expressed actually expresses the thought
[19:22] that God had before the foundation of
[19:23] the world that's right in other words
[19:25] that when you hear the word it's
[19:27] actually bringing
[19:29] expressing out what God knew about you
[19:32] before the foundation of the world that
[19:33] you were in other words eternal
[19:37] life brother R would say by for
[19:39] knowledge he knowed what you would do by
[19:42] forn knowledge he knew that Esau was a
[19:44] Shyer and he knew that Jacob respected
[19:46] that birth
[19:48] right so forn knowledge includes knowing
[19:51] who will bear the character of Christ
[19:54] and who
[19:55] won't Hitler sure wouldn't he go through
[19:58] all these example Esau sure didn't balam
[20:01] sure didn't it looked like they were
[20:03] going through the motions balum with all
[20:05] of his seven seven altars and all of the
[20:07] all of the mechanics in place right and
[20:10] all of those thing uh Cain with uh
[20:13] wanted to go to church and wanted to
[20:15] come find an approach to God and he was
[20:17] trying to do it as far as his
[20:18] intellectual
[20:19] ability but God knew who would want it
[20:22] and who would who who would who would
[20:24] respond to the call of
[20:27] God and Romans 8: 29 he says for whom he
[20:31] did Forno and we'll stop on this slide
[20:34] and and just kind of transition if the
[20:35] musicians going want to go ahead and
[20:37] come forward for whom he did Forno he
[20:39] also did
[20:41] predestinate to be conformed to the
[20:43] image of his son that he might be the
[20:45] firstborn among many
[20:47] Brethren and Ephesians 1 says according
[20:50] as he ha chosen Us in him before the
[20:53] foundation of the world that we should
[20:55] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[20:58] love having predestinated us unto the
[21:00] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[21:03] himself according to the good pleasure
[21:05] of his will all this was planned out
[21:07] before the foundation of the world Amen
[21:09] and in other words there's a Target in
[21:11] your life a trajectory in your life that

[21:41] Salvation through sanctification of the
[21:44] spirit and belief of the truth how did

[21:55] would do with the word when it dropped
[21:59] into our

[22:03] ready for
[22:06] us to think to think about

[22:13] knows you but he knew you God bless you
