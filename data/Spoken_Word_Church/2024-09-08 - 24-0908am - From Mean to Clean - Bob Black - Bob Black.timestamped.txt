[22:23] cannot get near that bloodline there's a
[22:25] life there that protects Us in an unseen
[22:27] Realm that gives us our Victory amen
[22:31] hallelujah we're going to ask um I
[22:33] believe it's brother Ben you have a
[22:34] testimony this morning right okay yeah
[22:36] if you would like to make your way up
[22:38] here we'll go ahead and have you to come
[22:39] up here and and tell your
[22:42] testimony
[22:48] Hallelujah good morning y'all morning I
[22:52] came here today as a newcomer to this
[22:55] church it's my fourth time this year
[22:59] and Jesus found me I'm going to say that
[23:02] first and foremost Jesus found me
[23:04] especially over the course of the
[23:06] summer especially as a young person
[23:09] who's just now turned 20 years old I've
[23:11] definitely lived a life of hardship as
[23:14] everyone here has I'm
[23:16] sure but it was these experiences these
[23:20] past few months that well it showed me
[23:24] that God's love is real am through all
[23:27] the times that I've done stupid things
[23:30] as a young person with some people that
[23:32] I used to consider
[23:34] friends doing things that I know I felt
[23:37] disappointed God but I know that in the
[23:40] end I'm saved by his grace his love his
[23:43] Mercy In The Name of Jesus I've been
[23:46] saved and I recognized that in April
[23:50] when he when I believe it was him that
[23:52] put this thought in my head because
[23:54] before I was a
[23:56] Christian I was someone who used to
[23:59] believe that all paths lead to God and
[24:03] well that's not necessarily an evil
[24:05] thing to say but it's not that truthful
[24:07] thing to say so it's misleading a
[24:10] thousands
[24:11] astray he put the thought in my head of
[24:14] if Jesus is in every Holy scripture in
[24:17] the Quran in the Torah as he is in the
[24:20] Bible it wouldn't be too crazy to say
[24:23] that he is telling the truth and he is
[24:25] who he says he is in that Bible and
[24:29] after reading a little bit of the word
[24:31] admittedly I'm new to it myself so I
[24:34] can't really give any verses off the top
[24:36] of my head without butchering all of
[24:38] them and probably saying all of it wrong
[24:40] but I do know one thing though after the
[24:43] promises I made to like do right and
[24:46] then just breaking it just trying to
[24:48] like please other people that I used to
[24:49] consider
[24:50] friends he definitely did show me that
[24:52] the holy spirit is still there and it
[24:55] and it grew even larger that day cuz
[24:58] instead of like having this anger in my
[25:00] heart I just felt more upset but God
[25:03] told me forgive and move on don't never
[25:06] forget but don't hold that anger in your
[25:10] heart and he let me know that long after
[25:15] I was baptized and especially like the
[25:18] events I'm talking about a trip in
[25:20] Florida with my old car 2002 Nissan X
[25:24] Terror as y'all probably know that car
[25:27] probably won't be able to run it as good
[25:28] but that's besides the point um it had a
[25:32] lot of
[25:34] problems but it still was able to get me
[25:36] there and back home safe and I
[25:38] especially knew that God was looking out
[25:39] for me when he told me to stop by a gas
[25:42] station cuz my phone was almost dead and
[25:45] it had the map for directions the moment
[25:47] I parked one of the hoses to my car it
[25:50] broke off it caused the engine to
[25:53] overheat but I thank God for that
[25:55] happening and I'm going to tell you why
[25:58] it could have happened anywhere it could
[26:00] have happened to me on the highway in
[26:02] the woods where I would have had no help
[26:04] but it's the fact that it happened there
[26:07] and immediately afterward a gentleman
[26:08] came and helped me out and I learned a
[26:10] lot more about cars that day I'll say
[26:13] that but it was that moment that I knew
[26:15] that God was real I knew that moment
[26:18] that he was looking out for me as he
[26:20] does for all of us cuz some of us
[26:22] especially as a young person we leave we
[26:25] leave away from God but what I want to
[26:29] say especially to the younger people
[26:31] here and the young people anywhere that
[26:33] may watch this if this is
[26:35] recorded he is real and you may not
[26:38] believe it now but he is real he's
[26:40] watching over your life and one day you
[26:42] will realize that he does love you and
[26:45] as long as you surrender your faith into
[26:48] into jesus'
[26:49] name who can stop you who can who can
[26:53] hate you well the world can but Jesus
[26:56] never will that's right even if you hate
[26:58] yourself as I once hated myself Jesus
[27:01] said no you're meant to do something
[27:03] great in this world putting that faith
[27:06] in him
[27:07] surrendered everything to him I think of
[27:10] this quote that this one man said
[27:13] forgive me as I can't remember all of
[27:15] the words to it but it went along the
[27:17] lines of what do you gain from praying
[27:20] to God and he said I didn't gain
[27:23] anything but I'll tell you what I lost
[27:25] depression anger anxiety
[27:29] fear
[27:31] doubt all of that and I'll definitely
[27:34] say that's definitely been the truth in
[27:35] my
[27:36] life so it's definitely good to be with
[27:39] here y'all and God
[27:49] bless what a
[27:51] testimony you know the scripture says
[27:53] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[27:55] and by the word of their testimony

[32:03] just bless this service and bless our
[32:05] hearts Lord Jesus as we look into your
[32:06] words and receive strength in your name
[32:10] amen this morning we want to look as the
[32:12] musicians take their
[32:15] seats we're going to look at Luke 7:
[32:21] 36 and I was uh I was trying something
[32:25] new this morning but it doesn't seem
[32:27] like it's working Josh so we'll
[32:30] we'll fix it some other time let me get
[32:32] unplugged
[32:50] here Luke 7:
[32:56] 36 and uh we'll take we'll take a the a
[33:00] topic um from mean to
[33:03] clean and I just something I you know
[33:07] sometimes you listen to um to to
[33:09] ministers we were up there in Ohio and I
[33:12] and and brother Josh Bennett just said
[33:13] something just struck my heart and I
[33:15] just got to studying it and studying
[33:17] these things out and you find some real
[33:19] little nuggets so Luke chap 7 verse 36
[33:22] it says and one of the Pharisees desired
[33:24] him that he would eat with him and he
[33:26] went into the Pharisees home Pharisees
[33:28] house and sat down to meet you may be
[33:31] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[33:32] reading of the
[33:34] word now brother random would use a
[33:36] scripture like he used it in the in the
[33:38] message pride and he used it in in the
[33:41] message
[33:43] um the the meanest
[33:45] man that I ever knew and you start
[33:48] studying out what what mean really
[33:51] is you know if you look in this story
[33:54] you know we've got we've got a man that
[33:56] gave an invitation to Jesus to come and
[33:59] come into his
[34:00] uh come into his house and sit down and
[34:05] this man this Pharisee you know he had
[34:07] been schooled in all of the the letters
[34:09] of the law and all the understanding and
[34:11] he he knew uh you know the Old Testament
[34:14] scriptures and understood things and was
[34:16] schooled in the the understanding of the
[34:18] Pharisees of that day and he invited
[34:21] Jesus into his home knowing that when he
[34:25] got there he just put him over in the
[34:27] corner cor wouldn't clean him up and
[34:28] just laugh at him now you you talk about
[34:33] meanness and then you contrast that with
[34:36] a little prostitute who you know maybe a
[34:38] lot of the church people in the world
[34:40] would look at and say well there's
[34:41] nothing good can come out of her and she
[34:44] had the heart that she was willing to
[34:47] get down at Jesus's feet and wash his
[34:51] feet and see it's that's the story that
[34:54] you
[34:54] know maybe maybe just I want to
[34:57] encourage people maybe in the back you
[34:59] start just running quotes when you get
[35:01] home run quotes and see how many times
[35:02] brother R mentioned meanness and what
[35:06] that how terrible that is
[35:10] meanness think about think about Jesus
[35:13] sitting there over in the corner and
[35:15] that Pharisee being so
[35:17] mean that he wouldn't give him the give
[35:20] him the time of day get the the person
[35:23] that greeted him at the door didn't
[35:25] didn't pay him any mind but he just shut
[35:27] him over in the corner and you think
[35:30] about how sometimes it maybe escapes us
[35:33] how terrible meanness is but meanness
[35:36] meanness is absolutely horrible if you
[35:39] start studying it out what brother
[35:40] Randon would say about
[35:42] it he'd say like uh you know you go into
[35:45] the woods and you look watch a bear come
[35:47] out of the woods and a bear a lot of
[35:49] times you just have that nature where
[35:50] it's just mean and instead of it'll go
[35:53] rumaging through your fish and rumaging
[35:55] through all your your food and
[35:57] everything and and and and then maybe he
[35:59] said it'll get caught up in something
[36:00] like a he used the example stove pipe
[36:03] and and he said it doesn't have nothing
[36:04] to do with food but the bear just out of
[36:07] meanness will just go to beating on that
[36:10] stove pipe and just out of meanness just
[36:13] because it wants to it wants to beat on
[36:15] something now that's that's meanness
[36:18] another example brother R will use is
[36:20] that that Maniac of gdar how Jesus cast
[36:23] those Devils out of that Maniac of gdar
[36:25] and they wanted to go into the the the
[36:27] chief devil wanted to go into the into
[36:29] the pigs and he said the reason why that
[36:32] Chief devil wanted to do it was just out
[36:35] of meanness he he he wanted to well if I
[36:38] if I can't be mean to this man that I'm
[36:41] possessing I I I want to go and and be
[36:43] mean to these farmers and get them all
[36:46] riled up and stir up a lot of trouble
[36:49] and you see that's where meanness
[36:50] meanness is just it's so cruel because
[36:52] there's no purpose to it it's just you
[36:55] know and you think now going back in
[36:59] your life when you're sit there in
[37:01] school and somebody in school will say
[37:03] well uh where'd you get that sweater
[37:05] from well I got it from Walmart that's
[37:07] where the poor people get their sweaters
[37:09] from and and and all that you know it's
[37:12] mean and and people in school where'd
[37:14] you get those shoes from those are girl
[37:16] shoes and and there's no purpose to it
[37:18] but they're just saying something to be
[37:20] mean and you know that's young people
[37:22] and everything but But as time goes on
[37:24] it it'll grow on up until wa you got a
[37:26] Pharisee that's sitting there and and
[37:29] he's mean so mean that he can't be
[37:32] hospitable to Jesus
[37:34] Christ now brother Brandon when y when
[37:37] he tells these stories he'd always start
[37:38] off the story with that Courier now the
[37:41] Bible don't really go into about The
[37:42] Courier that much but it he he'd say
[37:45] he'd go on T it's it must have been
[37:47] about Sundown when The Courier arrived
[37:49] and he he was searching all over from
[37:51] capernium to Nazareth and finally he met
[37:54] the one that he was searching for Jesus
[37:56] of Nazareth
[37:58] and he say that Courier now you think
[37:59] about if you're in the position of that
[38:01] Courier
[38:02] looking he he was in the service of this
[38:06] mean fell of course he'd got maybe
[38:08] caught up in the in the atmosphere of
[38:10] that home and the atmosphere of his
[38:11] employer and maybe he he because of
[38:13] those things he just didn't recognize
[38:15] the one that he's he's coming to deliver
[38:17] a message to and he come you know and
[38:21] brother Brown would frame it up that
[38:22] philli was outside of you know keeping
[38:24] watch and so the Courier meets philli
[38:26] and Philip brings him on into Peter and
[38:28] Peter takes him on into the presence of
[38:30] Jesus and Jesus he he you know brother R
[38:33] dramatizes it Jesus was tired and he'd
[38:35] been preaching all day and his voice was
[38:37] husky husky with the soreness and the
[38:39] dust of the day and here comes this
[38:42] Courier approaching Jesus in in this
[38:44] kind of a frame in this kind of a
[38:45] scenario Jesus Jesus is tired Jesus is
[38:48] weary his voice is Husky and and he said
[38:52] he's looking out upon them and seeing
[38:53] how that they were hungering and
[38:54] thirsting would explain to them how God
[38:56] brought about all of this this great
[38:57] works and and brother Brandon would to
[38:59] frame it up like this perhaps maybe he'
[39:02] just got through with a sermon of Jesus
[39:05] Jesus Jesus's first Doctrine you must be
[39:08] born
[39:10] again now now we're on kind of the topic
[39:13] of of of meanness and cleanness a a and
[39:16] and you begin to well let's meditate
[39:18] this morning let's just think about
[39:19] these things why is it so important to
[39:23] be born
[39:25] again why is it so important I think
[39:29] sometimes it escapes us you know when
[39:30] we're talking to our young people and or
[39:32] maybe your children and you and and it I
[39:35] feel like it sometimes escapes you know
[39:37] we just don't we kind of devalue being
[39:39] born well you can go ahead and get
[39:41] married before you're born again
[39:43] everything will just work it work itself
[39:45] out and now it might eventually maybe
[39:48] years down the load 20 30 years down the
[39:50] load road you you you'll finally come to
[39:53] the Lord and get and get born again get
[39:55] saved but but I tell you what it matters
[39:59] to be born again and why why does it
[40:03] matter so much we we know what being
[40:04] born again does it's it's the life of
[40:06] God in you and he gives you of his faith
[40:09] so that you can really believe and the
[40:10] world begins to open up to you and you
[40:12] your eyes become open so you can see
[40:14] things more plainly than because that
[40:16] you that before they were cloudy but but
[40:18] what is being born again doing it's it's
[40:21] changing your nature amen you might ask
[40:25] the question well how do I get born
[40:26] again this morning well you know uh
[40:28] we're we're we're expecting our first
[40:30] little grandbaby and we're you know
[40:32] we're thinking about a baby being born
[40:34] and and you know it in the natural it
[40:36] works very similar to the way it does in
[40:38] the spiritual you start believing and
[40:41] and you don't you don't get the baby
[40:42] right then when you believe have you
[40:44] received the Holy Ghost since you
[40:46] believed you believe and it starts a
[40:48] process and before long you got the
[40:49] twitching muscles and the mama can feel
[40:51] some something's growing but and and
[40:53] there's a life in there but it ain't it
[40:55] ain't the life that you want yet it's
[40:57] not that life and and before long after
[40:59] nine months then all of a sudden the
[41:02] baby comes out after labor labor pains
[41:05] just like in the spiritual how can you
[41:07] have a a birth in the spiritual without
[41:10] a lot of Labor and and all of that
[41:12] pressure and Desperation and all those
[41:14] things trying to trying to work things
[41:16] out and then the life comes into the
[41:19] baby now in the natural it's a life the
[41:22] life that's that's wrong we're born
[41:24] wrong we're born with all this meanness
[41:27] and hatred and Malice and and we can't
[41:29] even get along with the kids at school
[41:31] hardly we can't get along with our
[41:33] brother and sister and then of course
[41:35] mama and M and daddies wonder why your
[41:37] kids are acting up sometimes it's
[41:39] because we need the we need the Holy
[41:41] Ghost we need to be born again and we
[41:44] need to be born again so that we can put
[41:46] up with ourselves and so we can put up
[41:48] with one another and so we can
[41:49] communicate with God right so we need we
[41:52] need oh we need the life of God that God
[41:56] would come and Tabernacle Le himself in
[41:58] us and change us and bake all the
[42:01] meanness out bake all that stuff out of
[42:04] us that ain't supposed to be there and
[42:06] change our
[42:07] nature I'm talking this morning about
[42:10] not just knowing a lot of
[42:11] things but being different amen acting
[42:15] different now now isn't it some strange
[42:18] that we'll we'll preach a lot of time
[42:19] we'll preach now when you get born again
[42:22] they can see you coming and going your
[42:24] life has changed you'll be a living
[42:25] billboard and all those kind of things
[42:27] and then on the other side we'll go away
[42:29] and we'll say well I can't really tell
[42:31] people can't you can't really know you
[42:33] can't really tell it's just a secret
[42:37] it's just now come on now if you're if
[42:39] there's a change it's going to be
[42:43] apparent and you on the one side well oh
[42:46] the seals are written on the back side
[42:48] on the inside the backside and and
[42:50] everybody will know but on the other
[42:51] side well you just you just can't really
[42:55] know now I I I believe that God has
[42:58] given us the ability to know and and and
[43:01] not just it's going to be apparent come
[43:03] on now it's going to be apparent to the
[43:04] people that you work with the people are
[43:07] going to that you work with will see
[43:09] that there's something different now I I
[43:12] went through it myself when when I was
[43:15] born again I know that there's a change
[43:18] uh we went through it watching our
[43:19] children be born again we know there's a
[43:22] change when you come staggering in from
[43:24] driving home from work and you're
[43:26] staggering around around like a drunk
[43:28] man praising God in the living room and
[43:31] and telling a testimony about how how
[43:33] that something happened on the way home
[43:36] and then your life begins to change
[43:38] there's something something changed and
[43:41] and oh nobody's going to convince you
[43:44] otherwise nobody's going to say
[43:45] something different something changed
[43:49] and that's what I'm talking about it's
[43:50] not where well bless God I now I've got
[43:53] a right to be mean and hateful and no
[43:55] more than you and and all this kind of
[43:56] thing but no your your nature is
[43:59] changed and that's what I'm talking
[44:01] about this morning you got to be born
[44:04] again you you've got to be born again
[44:07] now young people you you need to be born
[44:10] again before you get married and and
[44:12] we're going to lay this out what brother
[44:14] Bram said about the little German boy
[44:16] and things you need to be born again
[44:17] because why what happens if you're not
[44:19] born again if you're not born again you
[44:22] get married to somebody and and you're
[44:24] just your whole your whole the whole
[44:26] stage is said for a bunch of yelling and
[44:29] screaming and and sleeping on the couch
[44:33] and and arguing about what kind of music
[44:34] you listen to and how you should dress
[44:36] and arguing about this and that and
[44:38] there won't be any peace and you won't
[44:39] be able to come come to the right
[44:41] conclusion about how to raise your
[44:42] children or or or or whether or not to
[44:44] go to school or whether or not to stay
[44:46] at home and and and bake breakfast for
[44:48] your husband and you won't be able to
[44:49] agree on anything first of all cuz you
[44:51] can't even read the Bible right and
[44:53] you're going to be looking it through it
[44:54] with a looking at the Bible with your
[44:56] eyes uh closed over and you won't be
[44:58] able to look at things right so you
[45:00] everything CH everything changes when
[45:02] you're born again the Bible changes your
[45:05] life changes the way that you look at
[45:07] things changes when you're born again
[45:09] now maybe maybe sitting here if you're
[45:10] not born again you might not be able to
[45:13] really place the value on it because and
[45:16] and oh but if oh if you just do like
[45:19] that little do that little prostitute
[45:21] woman and just humble yourself at the
[45:23] feet of Jesus and say I I'm willing to
[45:26] do whatever if it I'm willing to
[45:27] humiliate myself I'm willing to do
[45:30] whatever it takes to get to you amen now
[45:33] that's the birth process that's the
[45:36] birth mama mama wakes up in the middle
[45:38] of the night and she's got to go I I got
[45:39] to get now I'm I'm going to preach on my
[45:42] daughter a little bit she she she she
[45:44] worried us a little bit she'll say
[45:45] she'll wake up wake up in the middle of
[45:46] the night and she got to go get a
[45:47] LongHorn steak like okay but you see
[45:52] there's things there's Cravings within
[45:54] you that you you something there's a a
[45:57] desperation within you that you got to
[45:59] have it satisfied and there's something
[46:01] working within you to be birthed and
[46:03] you're believing you're beling but you
[46:05] see it's a gift of God you don't get it
[46:08] because because you did something or
[46:10] because you prayed enough or something
[46:12] but all you can do is believe and along
[46:14] and along the baby will be born so so if
[46:18] the baby ain't born the second you
[46:19] believe right now you just keep
[46:20] believing and you just believe with a
[46:23] steadfast assurance and just keep
[46:25] walking ahead hang on to that promise of
[46:28] God and by and by God will do something
[46:31] now see it takes a while for a baby to
[46:33] be born God will walk you through
[46:35] justification and sanctification he'll
[46:37] clean you out and you start studying the
[46:39] word and doing the things that a
[46:41] Christian is going to do and then and
[46:42] then he gives you his life and and and
[46:45] you couldn't better believe that his
[46:47] life is going to change
[46:49] you his life is going to change you and
[46:52] everybody will be able to see it
[46:54] everybody will be able to see it say it
[46:56] again everybody will be able to see
[46:59] it and brother Brown would say he might
[47:02] have went back to Genesis and began and
[47:05] said in the beginning God said let there
[47:08] be in the
[47:10] beginning and there
[47:12] was framing it up that God spoke and it
[47:16] caused something to happen and he said
[47:19] let everything that I have spoken for
[47:21] bringing forth of its kind and it did
[47:24] then he might have brought something
[47:25] like this saying well now and it brings
[47:27] forth and he's laying out how that you
[47:29] plant a seed and it's going to bring
[47:30] forth of its
[47:32] kind in other words you you preach the
[47:35] word of God and it's going to produce a
[47:37] change in your life it's there's going
[47:40] to be something different it's going to
[47:42] change you and he said but yet you can
[47:45] take these seed and you can mix them
[47:47] together and you can get what's called a
[47:50] hybrid product beautiful very nice but
[47:53] it isn't the original you let it go
[47:56] it'll go back to its kind again now he's
[48:00] talking about an original life now we
[48:04] sing that song the original Life The
[48:06] Original Seed and and that's what we
[48:08] want we don't want something hybridized
[48:10] by denominations or hybridized even by
[48:13] our own thinking but we want to go back
[48:15] to the original life and you see it all
[48:18] comes down to the life the life will
[48:22] manifest the characteristics of that
[48:24] life and and God is ident identified by
[48:27] his
[48:28] characteristics how how you it's
[48:30] identified you look at a mule you look
[48:33] at a mule and it's it's identified by
[48:35] the life that it has now you could put a
[48:37] costume on it and a parade or something
[48:39] but you can still identify it but that's
[48:41] well that's a mule because it's stubborn
[48:43] it's is hateful it you know get into a
[48:45] situation and it start that it just
[48:48] doesn't know how to handle it and it
[48:49] gets all aggressive you know it starts
[48:51] kicking and popping people upside the
[48:53] head with it with his Hooves but it it
[48:55] to take it back to the original life is
[48:57] going to act different the original life
[49:00] now it might have come from a a
[49:02] thoroughbred horse and a donkey but if
[49:05] you could take that life of the
[49:06] thoroughbred horse and put it in that
[49:08] mule then you got a thoroughbred horse
[49:11] again and by and by its ears are going
[49:13] to start changing and it's fur is going
[49:16] you know it's hair on its body it's
[49:17] going to start changing and and it its
[49:19] eyes are going to start changing because
[49:21] the life is what controls how it acts it
[49:24] controls its characteristics the life on
[49:27] the inside of that
[49:28] thing brother B said he might have said
[49:30] you see really your lives are hybrid
[49:32] that's that first birth your Li you come
[49:35] here with with all that stuff wrong that
[49:38] we need to have corrected he said father
[49:40] said don't touch the tree but Satan said
[49:42] it won't hurt you so therefore your life
[49:44] now is in a hybrid condition and that
[49:46] life cannot go back to itself breathe
[49:49] back now we've tried we tried for 7,000
[49:52] years had we people scientists are
[49:54] trying to to to change the DNA and fix
[49:57] the tel miror so that you don't age
[49:58] anymore so you can live forever and all
[50:00] these kind of we we've tried to to to
[50:02] get to get things fixed but there ain't
[50:04] no fixing it outside of the Holy Ghost
[50:07] that's why you got to get the Holy Ghost
[50:08] because the Holy Ghost takes you back to
[50:10] the original so that your inside is
[50:12] different and it starts working from the
[50:15] inside out starts changing you so that
[50:17] so that by and by our bodies will be
[50:19] changed it's changing us from the inside
[50:22] changing our spirit to align with our
[50:24] with our soul changing us over time
[50:26] until our whole being is changed now now
[50:29] look what brother R was talking about a
[50:31] hybrid we're talking about fake we're
[50:34] talking about meanness versus cleanness
[50:36] a hybrid he said can never stand the
[50:39] roughness and the treatment that the
[50:41] original can stand a hybrid just can't
[50:44] stand it when people you know at school
[50:46] or or work start making fun of you for
[50:48] living a real clean life they they make
[50:50] fun of you for for for dressing
[50:52] different and and not drinking alcohol
[50:54] and make fun of you for not cussing what
[50:56] you don't don't you don't cuss you don't
[50:58] smoke or drink you and but a hybrid a
[51:01] hybrid can't stand that but by and by
[51:03] they just can't put up with it they'll
[51:05] just go right back out but he said an
[51:07] old Longhorn would starve one of your
[51:09] heers to death out on the Prairie in the
[51:10] winter time she can make her own way
[51:13] like a deer now that's the real the or
[51:17] original can just just in the roughness
[51:20] and the toughness can just make its own
[51:22] way I I'm I ain't giving up original is
[51:27] like I ain't I ain't giving up I ain't
[51:28] backing down I'm I'm here for the Long
[51:30] Haul if I have to go scrimp for some
[51:33] food and and and grab through all the
[51:35] sand and all the brush and all the
[51:37] briers and all the Thorns I I I'm I'm
[51:39] keeping on because there's an original
[51:41] life in there that'll keep you moving
[51:43] but your hybrid Herford your hybrid
[51:45] Brahma Angus he' die out there he said
[51:48] you you have to Baby him so he saying
[51:50] hybrids have to be baby they got to have
[51:52] constant care and attention got to
[51:55] constantly be catered to
[51:57] constantly giving them exactly what they
[51:58] want and what they need constantly well
[52:01] oh I I'll give you if you want to do
[52:04] this I'll give it to you just just don't
[52:06] leave please don't if you want if you
[52:08] want this I'll give it to you just don't
[52:10] just stay just stay with the word just
[52:12] stay but but a real a real genuine you
[52:15] don't have to do all that
[52:18] to H Birds got to be baby they they they
[52:21] you know they got to give a be given
[52:23] some kind of a a thing in church that
[52:25] they might not be really be suited for
[52:27] but just to keep them involved that's
[52:29] the the like brother Dale used to say
[52:31] give somebody a hamburger or a hot dog
[52:33] or something just to kind of keep them
[52:34] around but but you don't have to do that
[52:37] to a real genuine cuz what they want
[52:39] they they just want to worship God they
[52:41] want the word of God they're there for
[52:43] for for uh because they're being CH
[52:45] changed and brother R would say they
[52:47] have to be soft soap to encourage them
[52:49] to hang around to hang around and soft
[52:52] soaping is trying to Coke someone
[52:54] through flatteries or gentle words
[52:56] rather than presenting the hard truth of
[52:58] a
[52:59] matter that's right that's all the
[53:02] ministers have is the truth that's the
[53:05] merchandise we're selling is the truth
[53:08] and we don't soft soap things just to
[53:09] kind of keep people keep the church full
[53:12] and and and keep things keep things uh
[53:15] keep the building going but the truth of
[53:18] the matter you know is that just not
[53:19] many are willing to be a doormat if
[53:21] necessary in Psalm 84 uh David said I'd
[53:25] rather be a door Keeper in the house of
[53:27] my God than to dwell in the tents of
[53:30] wickedness you know there's seasons in
[53:32] life where you have to just you just got
[53:34] to you got to take what God gives you in
[53:36] that moment and that season that you're
[53:37] going through a and that's what a real a
[53:40] real Longhorn will do is just willing
[53:42] I'm I'm keeping on I'm not giving up I'm
[53:45] willing to take whatever but instead of
[53:47] that hybrid Viewpoint if the me
[53:49] Methodist don't treat me right then I'm
[53:50] going to go to the
[53:52] Baptist now the balance is though that
[53:55] we should treat it each other
[53:57] right now now there's the balance a lot
[54:00] of times we get so caught up in well we
[54:03] just got to endure that we we we don't
[54:06] realize that we should be treating each
[54:08] other
[54:09] right we should be we should be speaking
[54:12] in kindness and dealing with one another
[54:14] in love because it shouldn't be that
[54:16] Christians like Paul told the
[54:18] Corinthians are biting and devouring and
[54:20] scratching each other's eyes and faces
[54:22] and clawing each other out and and and
[54:25] just calling each other liar and calling
[54:26] each other is but we should be living in
[54:28] love and harmony and
[54:30] unity
[54:32] Amen brother Brown will say hybrid
[54:34] Behavior has to be constantly defended
[54:37] excuse is constantly made for the
[54:40] behavior I can I can do that because
[54:42] society says it's all right I could I
[54:45] could treat how others however I want
[54:47] because God will forgive me anyway you
[54:49] realize what a terrible statement that
[54:50] would be and what are we talking about
[54:52] this morning we're talking about
[54:53] meanness I can do whatever I want cuz
[54:55] God's going to forgive me in the end and
[54:57] you got to forgive me cuz you're a
[54:58] Christian so I can just do whatever to
[55:00] you any way I want but and you got to
[55:02] forgive me cuz you're a
[55:04] Christian God has blessed me with
[55:06] special gifts and talents so I deserve
[55:08] more recognition than others or my anger
[55:11] is righteous anger just like Jesus
[55:13] showed in the temple people just can't
[55:15] handle my
[55:17] passion that's what we try to oh you
[55:19] know that's that's a real evil when
[55:21] you'll take an use something that Jesus
[55:22] did as an excuse to be mean to be mean
[55:25] and horrible and hateful but you know I
[55:28] don't want somebody to have to make
[55:29] excuses for my behavior like somebody on
[55:31] a playground that comes home and they
[55:33] they they run to the teacher and and
[55:35] they they're title telling on well they
[55:37] they were on the playground and they
[55:38] punched somebody in the nose and then
[55:40] the parents say well the reason they did
[55:42] that and they lay out all these kind of
[55:44] excuses oh I don't want have to some
[55:47] somebody to have to beg me to be
[55:48] different or beg me to be changed
[55:50] brother R say you don't have to beg a
[55:52] real Christian around because he is a
[55:54] genuine plan of God he's got something
[55:57] in him that
[55:58] Wars something in him oh there's a fire
[56:01] down on the inside that Wars and he
[56:03] ain't going to give up so you don't have
[56:05] to beg a Christian to pray you don't
[56:07] have to keep begging a Christian to ask
[56:09] for
[56:10] forgiveness you don't have to beg a
[56:12] Christian to
[56:13] love am you don't have to beg a
[56:16] Christian to help others you don't have
[56:18] to beg a Christian to give up to God and
[56:21] just yield
[56:23] themselves now we're talking about being
[56:25] born again now
[56:27] and and it's that's different from
[56:29] learning I think you know sometimes
[56:31] people look at the problems that maybe
[56:32] their family has or their children has
[56:34] and they're like well if I can just get
[56:35] my kids to this seminar or get them to
[56:38] this program over here that they can
[56:41] learn how to be different but but that's
[56:43] not what it is is it it's not you How
[56:46] you going to learn not to be
[56:48] mean how you going to learn to love you
[56:52] can't learn those things it's something
[56:55] in eight that happens from the
[56:58] inside I I I I have that's a big problem
[57:00] I have sometimes with people it seems
[57:02] like we're trying to get real educated
[57:04] educate ourself into changing but CH
[57:07] being changed comes from a real Born
[57:10] Again experience where the life of God
[57:12] has birthed into you and that's what
[57:13] changes you genuine Christians are going
[57:16] to have strength and resilience and the
[57:18] life is what makes a genuine believer in
[57:20] the Old Testament they had offer up the
[57:22] lamb or whatever and the the life of
[57:24] that animal could not come back back on
[57:26] the believer so their sins were taken
[57:28] care of in that moment but going forward
[57:31] they go right back out and do the same
[57:32] thing all over again in other words
[57:34] there wasn't a change there was no
[57:37] change but now since Christ died on the
[57:40] cross his blood dripped down the life
[57:41] was released and the life was released
[57:43] to come back on the believer on the day
[57:45] of Pentecost to change the church to
[57:47] begin changing us cuz the life is in the
[57:51] blood you take a donkey and breed it
[57:53] brother Brown would say to the horse and
[57:55] the mayor and it will produce a mule the
[57:57] mother mule and father mule cannot have
[57:59] a baby mule you have to keep hybrid so
[58:02] you know you you you take a mu and you
[58:04] wrap it up in sheep skin and a mule just
[58:07] can't do what a sheep can do a mule
[58:10] cannot be a horse or donkey or sheep no
[58:13] matter how much it tries because the
[58:16] life is different you look at the life
[58:18] of a mule and you're going to find out
[58:20] it's ignorant and hard-headed it it it
[58:22] doesn't know anything about hardly where
[58:24] it's at and all of a sudden d danger
[58:26] comes on it and it's just going to start
[58:28] reacting
[58:29] aggressively it it you can't teach a mu
[58:32] nothing it's resistant to learning you
[58:34] can't teach it you can you can take it
[58:35] to all these seminars but it just won't
[58:40] learn it it it because there's something
[58:42] in it life is different and its whole
[58:46] nature is
[58:47] unyielding a mule is not going to form
[58:50] positive
[58:51] relationships a mule is not going to
[58:53] form a relationship with with some a
[58:55] good happy relationship ship it there's
[58:56] just something in its life and brother
[58:59] brand would say a mule is the dumbest
[59:01] thing that I know of maybe if you look
[59:03] at a mule Square on in the face and it'd
[59:05] be all crosseyed and everything and and
[59:07] and and he said no matter whatever you
[59:09] do you can't teach him anything you just
[59:11] can't teach a mule something now what
[59:13] what are we talking about that you've
[59:15] got to have the new birth so that you
[59:17] can be
[59:18] taught because when you're Life Changes
[59:21] then then now you're teachable now
[59:25] things are different see you can't teach
[59:28] a mule nothing but now what what if you
[59:30] could take a mule and return it back to
[59:32] the original take a mule and change it
[59:35] back so that it's like the
[59:36] original back to the
[59:39] original God promised the spiritual Eve
[59:41] as same as he did the natural Eve that
[59:43] again the word would be restored to her
[59:45] that's what we've been preaching on the
[59:46] I will restore sayith the Lord that the
[59:49] original teachings will be restored back
[59:52] and he said if you always want to know
[59:54] what's truth go back to the beginning go
[59:58] back to the
[1:00:00] original you know you go uh to to to an
[1:00:04] art shop or something and and they'll
[1:00:06] have a lot of copies you can go to
[1:00:08] Costco and you can get you a copy of of
[1:00:10] an artwork and it' probably be worth
[1:00:12] maybe a couple hundred bucks or whatever
[1:00:14] that you could spend on but if you if
[1:00:16] you want to go back and get an original
[1:00:17] Picasso or an original Dy that there
[1:00:21] it'd be countless thousands of dollarss
[1:00:24] because it's beyond price you go back to
[1:00:26] the original and something's different
[1:00:29] we want to get back to the gospel again
[1:00:30] he say brother Rand will say that the
[1:00:32] reason people want to want to go back to
[1:00:34] like Renfro Valley and things is because
[1:00:36] there's something in us that's craving
[1:00:38] to return back to the original return
[1:00:41] back to like like we used to say that I
[1:00:43] want to be old school I want to be the
[1:00:45] old time and old school symbolizes that
[1:00:48] like that old way of thinking where you
[1:00:50] stood for something you you represented
[1:00:53] something right I I I I want to go back
[1:00:55] to the the right the old school way of
[1:00:57] doing things back to the original life
[1:01:00] the original Faith the original love the
[1:01:02] original Power and you know in this
[1:01:05] modern time it seems like some of
[1:01:06] Twisted Old School in have mean is
[1:01:08] something different because we've seen
[1:01:10] so much different old school doesn't
[1:01:12] mean mean and crabby and hateful will
[1:01:14] there be old school cuz they're mean and
[1:01:16] crabby and no old school means to go
[1:01:18] back to the original the original life
[1:01:21] the original where your nature is right
[1:01:24] now this morning I'm glad that God can
[1:01:26] change our nature that's what that
[1:01:28] message the Paradox is about so many
[1:01:30] others that I'm glad that God can take
[1:01:32] our nature and change it and make us
[1:01:34] different that we don't have to stay a
[1:01:36] stubborn old mu and we don't have to
[1:01:39] stay a contous old Billy
[1:01:42] Goat it's willing to butt heads with
[1:01:44] anything that comes by we don't have to
[1:01:46] stay an old vulture right we don't have
[1:01:49] to stay some some old crabby animal that
[1:01:53] all it wants to do is just throw out
[1:01:55] insults well I don't like that sweat
[1:01:57] where'd you get that sweater you know
[1:01:58] somebody was telling me at school that
[1:02:00] that their kids got so bad at school
[1:02:02] that they would go and and just grab
[1:02:04] your shirt and flip it open and look at
[1:02:05] the tag on the inside to see where you
[1:02:07] got your clothes from because if you got
[1:02:09] it from the wrong place if you didn't
[1:02:11] buy it from a place where your shirt was
[1:02:13] $150 and they were going to make fun of
[1:02:15] you now that see that's
[1:02:18] mean that's mean that's what we're
[1:02:20] talking about and meanness brother
[1:02:23] brandham said comes from the Devil yeah
[1:02:26] when you're when you're poking fun at
[1:02:28] somebody and just and and and you're
[1:02:30] you're you want to make them feel
[1:02:32] bad to think why would you want to make
[1:02:36] somebody feel
[1:02:37] bad now now look at all these animal
[1:02:40] animals brother Brown compared he's a
[1:02:42] lamb and a
[1:02:44] goat a lamb's real Meek and it's real
[1:02:46] innocent and it just constantly
[1:02:48] sacrificing itself why because it's life
[1:02:51] the life of that lamb but but now goats
[1:02:54] going to be real f it's just full of
[1:02:57] lies and deception and a goat will lead
[1:02:58] you to the slaughter acting like it's
[1:03:00] the real thing and all the Sheep
[1:03:02] following along well he's taking us
[1:03:04] where we're supposed to go and a goat is
[1:03:06] deceiving lying you look at a goat with
[1:03:08] those little slit eyes and it's like
[1:03:10] there's so that's why the The Satanist
[1:03:12] use that as an example of of of the
[1:03:14] devil because it's it that's what it
[1:03:16] represents something wrong it represents
[1:03:18] selfishness and a lack of
[1:03:20] sensitivity a lack of sensitivity now
[1:03:24] aren't you glad that when you get in to
[1:03:25] a real Holy Ghost fill meeting that you
[1:03:27] can feel the presence of the Lord but
[1:03:30] but now a goat a goat just can't don't
[1:03:31] know what's going on Harley it's just
[1:03:34] it's not sensitive to nothing it don't
[1:03:35] care about anybody else all it cares
[1:03:38] about is itself brother Brown would say
[1:03:41] it takes a real Sheep Man to know the
[1:03:43] difference between the bleet of a wolf
[1:03:45] and a bleet of a lamb and a goat they
[1:03:47] both bleed
[1:03:49] alike you you just about can't tell them
[1:03:51] apart but there's there's still a
[1:03:53] difference in nature still a difference
[1:03:56] in the life look at a dove and a crow
[1:04:00] the dove is real gentle and it's it's
[1:04:02] just committed it's committed to its
[1:04:04] partner it's it symbolizes Purity and
[1:04:07] peace and the Holy Ghost and it cannot
[1:04:09] stomach anything unclean now that's
[1:04:12] that's what a real Holy Ghost filled
[1:04:14] believer is like and brother that's
[1:04:17] that's what the Holy Ghost is like
[1:04:18] brother R said if you want the holy
[1:04:20] ghost in your life be like a real gentle
[1:04:23] lamb so that you can be a little lamb l
[1:04:25] led by the led by that little Dove and
[1:04:28] on the other hand though you got a crow
[1:04:30] that's just a symbol of hypocrisy and
[1:04:32] that dual nature you know we we don't
[1:04:34] want no dual Natures where you're living
[1:04:36] different at home than you are at church
[1:04:38] and you come to church and your wife or
[1:04:40] your kids are like you don't know the
[1:04:42] real them what what if I could yank my
[1:04:45] glasses off I you don't know the real
[1:04:47] them what does that mean we we want to
[1:04:50] be living the same way at home that we
[1:04:52] are at church the same way at work no no
[1:04:55] duel nature where we're when we're at
[1:04:57] home when when we're our family then we
[1:04:58] can really throw our arms back and let
[1:05:00] loose that temper and let that vein pop
[1:05:02] out but at church at church we're really
[1:05:06] we're just real Pious everybody we're
[1:05:10] only here a couple hours so we can we
[1:05:13] can fake it for that long and see that's
[1:05:16] what we're talking about a mule with a
[1:05:18] sheep skin on it a goat with a sheep
[1:05:21] skin a crow sticking a peacock feather
[1:05:24] in and you could fake it
[1:05:26] you can you can see somebody else living
[1:05:27] a real Holy Ghost filled Christian Life
[1:05:29] and and see some virtue and you going to
[1:05:31] take that peacock feather that
[1:05:32] symbolizes virtue and just jam it in
[1:05:34] real quick just for long and it it'll
[1:05:37] come out looking like it's right on the
[1:05:40] outside but we're talking about down on
[1:05:42] the inside are you
[1:05:45] changed and if you're changed it'll take
[1:05:47] the meanness away it'll take that take
[1:05:50] that away where you just want to be
[1:05:51] cruel to somebody right an eagle and a
[1:05:54] vulture an eag Eagles got that strength
[1:05:56] and the vision the ability to rise to
[1:05:58] Great Heights a symbol of God's great
[1:06:01] heritage of power and a vulture that it
[1:06:03] it don't mind eating anything
[1:06:05] dead and and it sure can't it it sure
[1:06:08] can't get up to the heights of true
[1:06:10] Revelation amen a vulture can fake it
[1:06:13] for so long but you start talking about
[1:06:15] the seals and the Thunders and the and
[1:06:17] and the Deep things it just it is only
[1:06:19] so high it can go it just can't get up
[1:06:22] it it can might get up as far as you can
[1:06:24] go by intellectual understanding but to
[1:06:26] really truly understand it can't climb
[1:06:29] that high a and an eagle is going to eat
[1:06:32] live meat it's got to eat live meat
[1:06:34] because it needs some blood in it it
[1:06:36] needs some life it it wants something
[1:06:38] that's going to because we're talking
[1:06:40] about life and an eagle an eagle wants
[1:06:42] life it wants something that's going to
[1:06:44] help it to
[1:06:46] sustain look at that pig that nature
[1:06:48] that returns to dirt and uncleanliness
[1:06:51] or somebody that just keeps going back
[1:06:53] to sin despite claiming to be something
[1:06:55] else
[1:06:56] a pig you know my uh my brother-in-law
[1:06:58] used to raise pigs and that was the
[1:07:00] nastiest thing you you to wash wash wash
[1:07:02] them out real good clean up their pen
[1:07:04] and come back the next day and it just
[1:07:05] be just as filthy again and and that's
[1:07:08] how a pig it's C the nature of that pig
[1:07:11] it'll just keep going right back to
[1:07:12] where it came maybe come to church and
[1:07:15] get in a good Revival and then right
[1:07:16] back it goes and right back it goes
[1:07:19] right back it goes maybe maybe if you're
[1:07:21] comparing it to uh somebody in church
[1:07:24] maybe in secret maybe nobody knows that
[1:07:27] you're going right back to where you
[1:07:28] come from on the Internet or something
[1:07:30] but it's that nature you got to get your
[1:07:33] nature
[1:07:34] changed it's a nature change that you
[1:07:36] can't fake
[1:07:37] fake cuz you can't you can't fake real
[1:07:41] virtue and real
[1:07:43] Temperance and real godliness and real
[1:07:46] brotherly kindness brother R say it
[1:07:49] would be like a crow trying to put a
[1:07:50] pigeon feathers in or a peacock and
[1:07:53] saying you see I'm a beautiful bird see
[1:07:56] it's something manufactured but a
[1:07:58] peacock don't have to worry whether he's
[1:08:00] going to have peacock feathers or not a
[1:08:02] dove don't have to worry whether he's
[1:08:04] going to have Dove feathers or not as
[1:08:06] long as his nature is a dove he will
[1:08:09] have Dove
[1:08:10] feathers now see that that means that
[1:08:13] it's not works I'm not saying these
[1:08:15] things like you you got well you better
[1:08:17] go home and get those feathers
[1:08:19] straightened out no we go home and get
[1:08:22] the life straightened out we go home and
[1:08:25] get back into the word and get get that
[1:08:27] part straightened out because if you get
[1:08:28] the inside right then the outside will
[1:08:31] take care of
[1:08:32] itself and what is what is the outside
[1:08:36] inside you do for God your faith outside
[1:08:39] you're living for others and therefore
[1:08:41] you can take all of the law and all the
[1:08:44] prophets in the all the Old Testament
[1:08:46] and just steal it all up and to just do
[1:08:49] for your brother like you would like
[1:08:50] them to do to
[1:08:52] you brother Brown said or Jesus said
[1:08:55] therefore all things whatsoever you
[1:08:57] would that men should do to you do you
[1:08:59] even so to them for this is the law and
[1:09:02] the
[1:09:03] prophets now that's what that's what
[1:09:05] that Pharisee got
[1:09:07] wrong he's sitting over there with that
[1:09:09] with Jesus over in the corner and and he
[1:09:12] ain't treating him like he would want to
[1:09:14] be treated he's not showing him
[1:09:17] Hospitality he's not he's not giving him
[1:09:20] the very best he's not robing him
[1:09:22] putting on those nice soft sandals and
[1:09:25] and oing him and anointing him up but
[1:09:27] he's shoving him over in the corner and
[1:09:30] being mean right being mean comes from
[1:09:33] the
[1:09:34] devil you know that scripture I just
[1:09:36] read whatsoever you would do that men
[1:09:39] you would that men should do to you that
[1:09:40] means that we should treat others the
[1:09:42] way we want to be treated with empathy
[1:09:44] and kindness and fairness by putting
[1:09:47] ourselves in the shoes of other people
[1:09:50] guiding us to act with love and respect
[1:09:54] not with mean
[1:09:56] you know all these animals we just
[1:09:58] looked at all these animals that that
[1:10:01] brother Brandon would teach us that in
[1:10:03] the church you're going to have
[1:10:04] scarecrows and that's what all these
[1:10:06] animals are you you come to church and
[1:10:08] you'll see what looks like a mule and it
[1:10:10] throws people off well we're not going
[1:10:13] to church anymore we're going to just
[1:10:14] stay home and listen to tapes all
[1:10:17] because there was a mule in church
[1:10:19] somebody that just hadn't had a life
[1:10:21] change well I'm going to stay home
[1:10:23] because I saw a vulture I I'm not going
[1:10:25] to get around the people at church
[1:10:27] anymore because I saw a goat that
[1:10:29] somebody just you know they they buted
[1:10:32] me over in the parking lot and they just
[1:10:34] run ran and trumped all over me so I'm
[1:10:36] just going to stay away but all of these
[1:10:39] copycats are put there it's almost like
[1:10:41] they're tools of the devil to act as
[1:10:44] scarecrows to see if you what you going
[1:10:46] to do are you a real genuine that are
[1:10:49] you really going to power through and
[1:10:52] and and do like a real Longhorn a real
[1:10:54] thorough bread and just keep powering
[1:10:56] through no matter what comes your way
[1:10:59] and brother Ram said don't let the
[1:11:00] Scarecrow bother you that's right if
[1:11:03] there's a scarecrow that only means
[1:11:05] there's something good behind it and you
[1:11:08] can believe that there's a lot of
[1:11:09] scarecrows around the message there's a
[1:11:12] lot of strange things strange doctrines
[1:11:15] strange people we'll go ahead and say it
[1:11:17] strange all kinds of strange and it'll
[1:11:20] keep you away if you're not willing to
[1:11:22] just power through Power past it cuz I
[1:11:24] guarantee you there's some good stuff
[1:11:26] behind the scarecrows there's some good
[1:11:28] stuff in that field if you can just look
[1:11:31] past all the fakeness there's some good
[1:11:33] stuff in the field and he said I'll
[1:11:36] admit it it's being tramped on made fun
[1:11:38] of misinterpreted misrepresented and
[1:11:40] everything else like that that's only
[1:11:42] the devil counterfeiting but there is a
[1:11:45] real genuine baptism of the holy spirit
[1:11:48] that brings the same results that they
[1:11:50] had on the day of
[1:11:53] Pentecost God can change our nature
[1:11:56] there's a lot of mean a lot of crabby a
[1:11:58] lot of backbiting a lot of all that kind
[1:12:00] of stuff but God can still change your
[1:12:02] nature if you just look past all of that
[1:12:04] to Gentle and meek and kind and
[1:12:08] loving now there's a lesson there too
[1:12:11] other people ain't my example on how to
[1:12:13] live and they can't be yours either you
[1:12:16] live according to what the word of God
[1:12:18] says the word of God is my metric for
[1:12:20] what I want to live up to not other
[1:12:23] people and the word of God says that God
[1:12:25] is going to restore all these nine
[1:12:27] spiritual fruits and nine spiritual
[1:12:29] gifts and part of that is gentleness
[1:12:32] meekness
[1:12:34] longsuffering love and those are the
[1:12:36] things that you can't fake you can't
[1:12:39] fake love you can't fake love you you
[1:12:42] know look down through history and see
[1:12:44] people they will sever relationships
[1:12:46] just because somebody said a harsh word
[1:12:48] toward them when Jesus
[1:12:51] said father forgive them they're on the
[1:12:53] cross they were crucified and see you
[1:12:56] you can't you can't manufacture it you
[1:12:58] can try to fake it all day long but
[1:13:00] there's no faking that kind of love amen
[1:13:04] God is going to change our nature in
[1:13:06] Matthew 7 7:16 he said ye shall know
[1:13:08] them by their fruits did men gather
[1:13:11] Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles in
[1:13:13] other words you're going to know people
[1:13:16] by their life amen by the way that they
[1:13:20] treat others by the way that they
[1:13:22] respond to God by by the way that they
[1:13:26] react to the word you're known by that
[1:13:29] you're known that so much till you know
[1:13:32] if they lower you down in the grave at
[1:13:34] the end of your days you're going to be
[1:13:35] remembered people remember you by the
[1:13:38] way that you treated them by the way
[1:13:40] that you spoke it's sad to say but
[1:13:43] they'll remember you by the way that
[1:13:45] they they made you feel when you were
[1:13:47] around them were you mean or were you
[1:13:51] clean were you mean and brother brand
[1:13:54] was say like this your life speaks so
[1:13:56] loud that I can't hear your testimony we
[1:13:59] might you know I might preach a long
[1:14:01] really nice sermon but if I go out in
[1:14:03] the parking lot and I just treat
[1:14:04] everybody like dirt then what does that
[1:14:07] say about my life it's my life your life
[1:14:10] is your testimony what we are how we
[1:14:13] walk no matter what we say our life
[1:14:15] speaks louder than our words
[1:14:17] do you know that's what the seals are
[1:14:20] about tell me brother Bob what the seals
[1:14:23] are well they you got a genuine and a
[1:14:25] fake and brother R said that's just how
[1:14:27] the how the how the devil wants to do he
[1:14:29] wants to see God do something and then
[1:14:32] he wants to copy it here comes a dove
[1:14:35] and he's going to copy it with a crow
[1:14:37] here comes a lion and he's going to copy
[1:14:39] it with a white horse rider and because
[1:14:41] all he knows how to do is fake he wants
[1:14:43] to watch and see the genuine and then
[1:14:45] just come along behind it and just fake
[1:14:47] and try to copy it but if you got a real
[1:14:50] something real genuine people what is
[1:14:53] the Thunders what is the the Thunders
[1:14:55] it's a real genuine life of God
[1:14:58] reflecting the word that you've eaten
[1:15:01] brother an would say how we need in
[1:15:02] Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices
[1:15:04] the Thunder of God thundering out and
[1:15:06] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled
[1:15:10] lives walking around in the Earth today
[1:15:12] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:15:14] Christians that's Thunder against the
[1:15:16] enemy the devil don't care how loud you
[1:15:19] can holler the devil don't care how much
[1:15:21] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:15:23] or shout but what hurts the devil is to
[1:15:25] see that Sanctified holy life
[1:15:27] consecrated to
[1:15:30] God say anything to
[1:15:33] him call him
[1:15:35] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[1:15:39] move right
[1:15:41] on that throws him
[1:15:43] away that's the Thunder that shakes the
[1:15:46] devil now that's real Thunder is a life
[1:15:49] live by the
[1:15:50] word we need a life change you know
[1:15:54] brother Ram told that story in the in
[1:15:55] the message the Paradox about that
[1:15:57] little that stubborn little German boy
[1:15:59] that we use as an example for why you
[1:16:01] need to be born again before you get
[1:16:03] married before you start off on life and
[1:16:06] he talked about that little stubborn
[1:16:07] German boy was was uh he'd go to church
[1:16:11] he'd sit there in church but there was
[1:16:13] something wrong with his nature and it
[1:16:16] come from the way he was born his his
[1:16:18] all of his family was like that they
[1:16:20] were they had that strain in all of the
[1:16:22] family where they just could not ask ask
[1:16:25] for forgiveness now now brother brandham
[1:16:27] is making this case that it's something
[1:16:30] really that needs to be dealt with and
[1:16:32] and see what I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:16:34] uh to to stress a sense of urgency to
[1:16:38] let's not just deal with things if if
[1:16:40] you can't ask for forgiveness if oh to
[1:16:42] think about what a what a terrible
[1:16:44] situation it would be for a couple to
[1:16:46] live for 20 30 years and neither one of
[1:16:48] them could ever ask for
[1:16:51] forgiveness neither one of them could
[1:16:53] ever seek reconciliation you're raising
[1:16:54] up kids and you can never get down by
[1:16:56] their their bedside and say I'm sorry I
[1:16:59] shouldn't have talked to you like that I
[1:17:00] shouldn't have talked to your mama like
[1:17:01] that and brother Bram said the reason it
[1:17:04] was was because there was a strain in
[1:17:07] the family there was a genetic strain
[1:17:09] that the the all of that family was like
[1:17:12] that and you know sometimes you get
[1:17:15] around at Family reunions and things and
[1:17:16] you're like well okay now I know why my
[1:17:18] nose is like this or my ears are like
[1:17:20] this now I understand well well they
[1:17:22] this wasn't something visible this was
[1:17:24] something in their nature right and see
[1:17:27] we're talking about changing your nature
[1:17:29] now your whole family might might have a
[1:17:31] certain strain and have a certain makeup
[1:17:34] where they're just unwilling to do
[1:17:35] certain maybe maybe like this case
[1:17:38] unforgiving unwilling to
[1:17:40] apologize stubborn it ain't my fault I'm
[1:17:44] not admitting wrong it ain't my fault
[1:17:46] it's anybody's fault but mine and you'll
[1:17:48] just cow cow toow down and and but see
[1:17:51] brother brandom said there was some
[1:17:53] somebody in that family that was
[1:17:55] different the mama had got a hold of God
[1:17:59] or God had got a hold of her and and had
[1:18:02] changed her nature and and he said
[1:18:05] you're the only one of all your sisters
[1:18:08] and brothers and you are sweet kind and
[1:18:13] forgiving you out of all your brothers
[1:18:16] and sisters are sweet kind and
[1:18:21] forgiving what does that and your true
[1:18:25] part of that family tree yet you have
[1:18:27] received the Holy Ghost that's the thing
[1:18:30] that made you tender and sweet is the
[1:18:34] Holy Ghost oh the Holy Ghost can change
[1:18:37] your nature and he said it's not your
[1:18:40] people anymore it's your Christ that
[1:18:43] lives in you now that's why sometimes
[1:18:46] you know we preach so hard against
[1:18:47] horoscopes and things because you know
[1:18:49] if you're born again from that first
[1:18:51] that first birth the horoscope might do
[1:18:53] you some good you can figure out what
[1:18:54] time of year you're born and what your
[1:18:56] Nature's like you know I'm going to do
[1:18:58] I'm going to be a real hard worker on
[1:19:00] this day I need to all this kind of
[1:19:02] stuff but but when your Nature's
[1:19:04] changed there might still be some
[1:19:06] leftover as far as you like fishing and
[1:19:09] and maybe you're real studious and those
[1:19:10] kind of things but but your nature is
[1:19:12] going to be changed from mean to clean
[1:19:15] and you're not out to be cruel to
[1:19:17] somebody anymore but now you're out to
[1:19:19] help
[1:19:22] am it's a nature change
[1:19:25] you would think in that sermon the
[1:19:27] meanest man I ever knew that brother R
[1:19:28] would mentioned that that uh Bert KY but
[1:19:32] he never mentions him he mentions them
[1:19:33] in the sermon why and in that sermon why
[1:19:36] he also said that was the meanest man
[1:19:38] that I ever knew remember that Burke
[1:19:40] Kyle that he went out hunting with and
[1:19:42] he said there was a man up in New
[1:19:44] Hampshire by the name of Berke Kyle and
[1:19:46] one of the finest Hunters I ever met but
[1:19:48] he was the meanest man I ever met oh he
[1:19:51] was cruel in heart he was cruel
[1:19:57] he said you know how people get just
[1:19:59] want to make you feel bad do
[1:20:02] something you know cruelty is one of the
[1:20:05] inherent aspects of sin because cruelty
[1:20:08] is a deliberate infliction of pain
[1:20:12] suffering or distress it's a deliberate
[1:20:15] inflection let me see that tag on your
[1:20:17] shirt and then I'm going to make fun of
[1:20:19] you cuz you don't have enough money in
[1:20:21] the bank to buy the right kind of shirt
[1:20:24] let me see those shoes you got on and
[1:20:26] I'm going to make fun of them because
[1:20:27] you didn't buy them from the place that
[1:20:29] I think you should buy them from and
[1:20:30] here's Burke call who will try to make
[1:20:34] brother brandham feel bad by shooting a
[1:20:36] little deer now cruelty is inflicting
[1:20:39] mental anguish through verbal abuse or
[1:20:42] humiliation in other words you know the
[1:20:44] words that we say can have such a
[1:20:46] profound effect on people's lives well
[1:20:49] you just want to be popular you're
[1:20:51] you're a liar you're a failure you wish
[1:20:52] you had Temperance you're the Problem
[1:20:55] Child you know you think about the these
[1:20:56] words that they cause scars over time
[1:20:59] the words that people
[1:21:00] say and and listen now y'all y'all don't
[1:21:04] draw up on me
[1:21:06] I'm I I I I feel like this I I I don't I
[1:21:09] I'm trying to work out what what what's
[1:21:10] happening here you're you're you're
[1:21:12] looking at the floor and falling asleep
[1:21:14] but surely you can recognize that these
[1:21:16] things are are helpful because God's
[1:21:19] God's got he's going to change us he's
[1:21:21] going to change us or we'll perish he's
[1:21:24] going to change us or we'll be left here
[1:21:26] and you see that we we getting we're get
[1:21:28] in that mindset just like that scene
[1:21:30] that's playing out if we don't have that
[1:21:32] mindset of that little prostitute woman
[1:21:34] will'll never be able to get something
[1:21:36] from God because a mean hateful attitude
[1:21:39] will never be able to come to the
[1:21:41] Fountain and get anything that's what
[1:21:43] that Pharisee had that Pharisee had that
[1:21:44] old well I I was I was reading through
[1:21:47] the the message why and brother brand it
[1:21:49] seemed like he was in such despair he
[1:21:51] said I go overseas and people receive it
[1:21:53] but you come to America am and about all
[1:21:55] you're going to get in America is money
[1:21:56] to take overseas to preach it it's just
[1:21:59] like people in America they don't want
[1:22:00] it he said I can be in a prayer line and
[1:22:03] I can be talking to somebody about their
[1:22:05] their disease and revealed to them all
[1:22:07] their backstory and then I can just feel
[1:22:09] from every corner of the building well
[1:22:11] he said even from Christians well I
[1:22:13] guess that's right I guess that's right
[1:22:16] it's because is there's something
[1:22:18] something wrong spiritually wrong with
[1:22:20] this nation and we've got to fight
[1:22:22] against that don't let the thing that's
[1:22:24] spiritually wrong with this nation creep
[1:22:27] into the church and into your home life
[1:22:29] until you get all cold there's a promise
[1:22:32] in eel 36 that God will take that old C
[1:22:34] Stony heart and soften it up soften it
[1:22:38] up so it's pliable and so it's sensitive
[1:22:41] to the moving of the Holy Ghost In other
[1:22:43] words God will take a cold Stony heart
[1:22:45] and change it change it so he can talk
[1:22:49] to it amen I I want to be changed that's
[1:22:52] what I'm expecting when I come to chur
[1:22:54] church is I want God if there's anything
[1:22:56] wrong with me and at the end of this
[1:22:58] sermon brother brandom starts laying out
[1:23:00] all the things wrong with him I should
[1:23:01] have I wish that I had more power in my
[1:23:03] life I wish I had a more Pentecostal
[1:23:06] experience I wish this and that there's
[1:23:08] always something else that we can do for
[1:23:11] more for God there's something else that
[1:23:12] we can do that's lacking in us and I
[1:23:15] tell you one thing I think that's
[1:23:16] lacking in US is how we don't guard our
[1:23:18] words maybe we value too much how plain
[1:23:21] we are but you know being real plain it
[1:23:24] will will cause lasting scars you know
[1:23:27] people come up to you and say well
[1:23:28] you're you're the bad twin and you're
[1:23:30] the good twin people have come up which
[1:23:33] one is the good twin and and you know
[1:23:36] you think about things will not have an
[1:23:38] effect on people's life but the words
[1:23:40] that you say have a profound effect I
[1:23:43] can say something good to my wife uh the
[1:23:46] other day I I I made a mistake I was
[1:23:48] trying to just kind of joke around about
[1:23:50] the baby and I said boy y'all better get
[1:23:53] to praying they're going to be teenagers
[1:23:54] before long and
[1:23:57] I cuz why you you say something negative
[1:24:00] and it affects people's thinking and the
[1:24:04] the words that you say matter and if
[1:24:07] you'll if you'll surround yourself with
[1:24:09] a positive confession if the doctor says
[1:24:12] something something wrong just say
[1:24:14] something positive
[1:24:17] back these words and James told us that
[1:24:21] behold also is the ships that your
[1:24:23] tongue is like like the Helm of a ship
[1:24:25] that your tongue can actually guide your
[1:24:27] life and he said even so the tongue is a
[1:24:30] little member and boasteth great things
[1:24:32] behold how great a little matter how
[1:24:36] great a matter a little fire kindleth in
[1:24:38] other words your tongue we use the
[1:24:40] Expression sometimes oh you're going to
[1:24:42] throw Another Log on the Fire and that's
[1:24:44] how we throw a Log on the Fire is that
[1:24:46] there a situation arise and we'll that
[1:24:48] underneath your tongue is the fire of
[1:24:50] hell and we'll use that tongue to Throw
[1:24:52] Another Log on the Fire to cause
[1:24:54] somebody hurt to cause somebody pain
[1:24:57] right but if we'll clean our heart out
[1:24:58] our tongue will work differently cuz
[1:25:01] Matthew 12:34 says out of the abundance
[1:25:03] of the heart the mouth
[1:25:05] speaketh what's in your heart is going
[1:25:07] to come out in your
[1:25:09] mouth and if in your heart is meanness
[1:25:11] and hatefulness it's going to come out
[1:25:13] in your mouth that's that's that toxic
[1:25:16] speech you know that that I we keep
[1:25:18] labored on the kids go to camp and they
[1:25:20] come back and all this drama gets
[1:25:22] stirred up on Instagram or whatever and
[1:25:24] it's because they don't have a life
[1:25:26] change and then you come to church and
[1:25:29] sometimes the adults are in the same
[1:25:31] predicament and out of their mouth out
[1:25:33] of their heart spews
[1:25:34] toxicity why why are you dressed like
[1:25:37] that why this why this because there's
[1:25:40] something something lacking down in the
[1:25:43] heart that's right an unclean heart will
[1:25:46] say I can I can say anything I want as
[1:25:48] long as I'm honest but if we'll think
[1:25:50] about
[1:25:50] it if we'll think about it think about
[1:25:53] what our word words mean like James is
[1:25:55] instructing us to do you know I there's
[1:25:58] this story uh it's a table quote where
[1:26:00] brother brandom was advising this couple
[1:26:03] and and you know he he actually saw a
[1:26:05] vision about how they were meant to be
[1:26:07] together and so forth and and he used an
[1:26:10] analogy of like a golden vow and he was
[1:26:13] counseling the brother and he said you
[1:26:15] you better guard your words because
[1:26:17] there's like a when you get married
[1:26:18] there's like a golden vow that the more
[1:26:21] harsh words you say sooner or later The
[1:26:23] Vow gets depleted more and more and more
[1:26:26] until all that's left is just a lot of
[1:26:30] resentment and once the vile is emptied
[1:26:33] it's never going to be able to be filled
[1:26:34] up again and see we we think we we just
[1:26:37] take so lightly the words that we say to
[1:26:39] each other there's there's a limit in
[1:26:42] other words what I'm saying is there's a
[1:26:43] limit to hurtful words before The Vow
[1:26:46] runs out God can forget but but we
[1:26:50] remember now that's the the sad state of
[1:26:53] the thing is that we remember remember
[1:26:55] we remember when if you loan somebody
[1:26:57] money and they don't pay you back we'll
[1:26:59] forgive them we'll release that hurt but
[1:27:01] the next time they want money you're
[1:27:02] still going to remember we we it's just
[1:27:06] part of humanity God can forget he'll
[1:27:08] throw all these things in the sea of
[1:27:09] forgetfulness but we
[1:27:11] remember and there's just no getting
[1:27:13] away from it we remember we remember all
[1:27:15] the times that somebody told you you're
[1:27:16] ugly or how could you be so dumb or that
[1:27:19] dress looks terrible on you I don't even
[1:27:20] want to look at you all those things
[1:27:22] build up so let's not speak from a place
[1:27:25] of meanness and hurt meanness is
[1:27:28] important now there's there's Jesus
[1:27:31] sitting on the chair in the corner and a
[1:27:33] mean old hateful Pharisee that ain't
[1:27:35] going to get nothing from Jesus cuz he
[1:27:37] can't even treat him right get down on
[1:27:39] your knees and wash him like that dirty
[1:27:41] old prostitute that everybody's looking
[1:27:43] at but the Pharisee with all his
[1:27:45] background all of his all of his word
[1:27:47] all of his teaching that he's supposed
[1:27:49] to know but he can't have the right
[1:27:51] attitude and brother Brian will say B
[1:27:54] call was just a fine fell but the
[1:27:56] meanest I ever seen in my life he used
[1:27:58] to F shoot little phones just to make me
[1:28:01] feel
[1:28:02] bad why would anybody want to make
[1:28:04] somebody feel
[1:28:07] bad he said you know there's people like
[1:28:09] that in the world will just make fun of
[1:28:11] you just to make you feel
[1:28:14] bad say something evil about
[1:28:16] you I'm sorry church but that is
[1:28:19] straight up evil to make fun of somebody
[1:28:22] just to make them feel bad you sit sit
[1:28:25] somebody over in the corner have a
[1:28:27] little family gathering and then you're
[1:28:28] going to put one of the adults over with
[1:28:29] the kids so you can laugh at them like
[1:28:31] Jesus over in the corner just to make
[1:28:33] them feel bad cuz you don't care about
[1:28:35] them you just care about you care about
[1:28:37] your own selfish desires and your own
[1:28:39] selfish motives you'll put somebody over
[1:28:41] in the corner and laugh and make fun of
[1:28:43] them make fun of the way they're dressed
[1:28:44] and make fun of all these things he said
[1:28:46] there's people like that in the world it
[1:28:48] isn't a person it's the devil in that
[1:28:51] person that's all that person loves his
[1:28:54] wife just the same as you love yours and
[1:28:56] so forth likes to eat and sleep and
[1:28:58] drink and be sociable and things but
[1:29:01] they do it just because the devil has
[1:29:03] control of them it's the devil in that
[1:29:06] person he said now I don't think it's
[1:29:09] wrong to shoot a phone I'm sorry y'all
[1:29:11] but I ain't looking at the time I'm
[1:29:12] holding y'all prisoner this this morning
[1:29:15] sorry he said now I don't think it's
[1:29:17] wrong to shoot a phone if the
[1:29:19] conservation says for you to shoot a
[1:29:20] phone that's all right Abraham killed a
[1:29:22] calf and fed it to God so the phone
[1:29:25] parts all right but not just to be mean
[1:29:27] now look what Theo the lesson he's
[1:29:29] explaining here the law said it was all
[1:29:33] right to shoot the phone but the spirit
[1:29:37] is what was
[1:29:38] mean in other words how how the Spirit
[1:29:42] Matters just as much as what and many
[1:29:46] times you know you can look at the word
[1:29:48] of God and say well I I got a right to
[1:29:50] do this thing I got a right to do
[1:29:52] whatever and you think that it's right
[1:29:54] right to do it but the how will be wrong
[1:29:56] your spirit won't be right am you can
[1:29:59] approach something with meanness or the
[1:30:01] the wrong kind of an attitude or
[1:30:03] something and it it will make the right
[1:30:04] thing wrong because of the spirit
[1:30:07] brother R would say this he'd said it's
[1:30:09] not what you do it's the way you do it
[1:30:13] so sometimes it's not what you
[1:30:16] say it's the way you say it I want to
[1:30:20] think about that that you can say you
[1:30:22] can say the same thing differently and
[1:30:25] it'll have two different meanings the
[1:30:27] right way and the wrong way and what is
[1:30:28] it the spirit gives it the
[1:30:32] meaning when Jesus was laying up there
[1:30:34] in that grave and the spirit entered his
[1:30:36] body it come out the spirit gave it life
[1:30:39] the spirit takes the word and makes it
[1:30:41] live and the spirit will take your words
[1:30:45] and give them meaning the spirit gives
[1:30:48] your words
[1:30:49] meanings he had a right to kill the
[1:30:51] phone by the law but his Spirit was
[1:30:53] wrong I think about that story that
[1:30:55] brother RAM used over and over about
[1:30:56] Micah being called to the scene by
[1:30:59] Jehoshaphat and Ahab and Jehoshaphat
[1:31:01] visited Ahab and they discussed they
[1:31:03] they wanted to Ahab wanted to go reclaim
[1:31:05] Routh Gilead and the word said he had a
[1:31:09] right to go reclaim that land because
[1:31:10] Joshua had given it to him Joshua
[1:31:13] prophesied he said you you got a right
[1:31:15] it's
[1:31:16] yours but ahab's claim to ramothgilead
[1:31:19] was invalidated because his Spirit was
[1:31:22] wrong he wasn't going to listen to to a
[1:31:24] prophet he wasn't going to listen to the
[1:31:25] word for his day so Ahab had a write by
[1:31:28] the word but Jehoshaphat wanted the
[1:31:31] right spiritual
[1:31:32] interpretation the Spirit Matters the
[1:31:35] spirit in which we do things matter
[1:31:39] matters we we need the right kind of a
[1:31:41] spirit that's why brother Ram said we
[1:31:44] said well we got all this word but he
[1:31:45] said well it doesn't do good to have the
[1:31:47] word the car up on the blocks you got to
[1:31:50] have a spark in it to make it come off
[1:31:52] and ride on the road and fire on the
[1:31:54] same 16 cylinders it's the life in the
[1:31:57] body that makes it move it's the life in
[1:31:59] that car the spark in that car that
[1:32:01] makes it ride down the road it's the
[1:32:03] spirit it's the spirit that makes things
[1:32:06] that makes it return back to the
[1:32:08] original
[1:32:09] life God made a way for us to return
[1:32:12] back to the original life and Jesus
[1:32:14] would tell that Courier he said in order
[1:32:16] to get back to the
[1:32:18] original God has got to speak again
[1:32:22] that's what he does when he gives you
[1:32:23] the new birth your old life is gone and
[1:32:26] you're back to the original word of God
[1:32:29] you're back to the
[1:32:31] original when God speak to your heart
[1:32:34] that's what makes the difference you
[1:32:36] know this morning that's what we're
[1:32:37] trying to do to create an atmosphere of
[1:32:38] Faith where we can begin to grasp a hold
[1:32:41] to the word of God and and we can begin
[1:32:43] to hear things differently because
[1:32:45] brother ran would say you don't hear
[1:32:46] with your ears you hear with your heart
[1:32:48] so Faith cometh by hearing according to
[1:32:50] Romans 10:17 and hearing by the word of
[1:32:53] God which is why you need to be born
[1:32:55] again because you're not going to be
[1:32:57] able to hear right if your heart is not
[1:33:00] changed your heart your the life in
[1:33:04] you brother Brown would say when God
[1:33:06] speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit
[1:33:08] then you're back in the original family
[1:33:10] of God again you don't have to be baby
[1:33:12] then you're a rugged Christian who can
[1:33:14] stand it what can a rugged Christian
[1:33:16] stand a rugged Christian can stand
[1:33:19] persecution and Temptation and isolation
[1:33:22] and criticism and all those all all the
[1:33:25] fake all the fake and all the hypocrisy
[1:33:28] it can power right through it and you
[1:33:31] know what the hypocrisy and the fake
[1:33:32] will help you it will help you because
[1:33:35] it will mold you it will mold your way
[1:33:36] you think to to look to to run back to
[1:33:39] the word and find out what's true and
[1:33:42] what's real it will help you navigate
[1:33:43] all the trials and tribulations and life
[1:33:47] changes and he would say that rugged
[1:33:50] word of God stays right there when he
[1:33:52] spoke that original voice into your
[1:33:53] heart you are
[1:33:56] mine or when you hear God speak to your
[1:33:59] heart not the minister not the Deacon
[1:34:02] not the Elder but God speak to your
[1:34:05] heart not somebody that you're hanging
[1:34:07] on to their coattails waiting for
[1:34:08] something to change but God speak into
[1:34:10] your heart and that's what changes
[1:34:14] everything God has to speak
[1:34:17] again he'd say that career perhaps
[1:34:19] thought this was a time this journey was
[1:34:21] over and he said so he invited him and
[1:34:24] so forth and and brother R would say
[1:34:26] that Jesus always goes where he's
[1:34:29] invited you
[1:34:31] know I was meditating on this this this
[1:34:33] is this is where my problem is I I don't
[1:34:37] like
[1:34:38] meanness I you know brother Wade has
[1:34:40] many times used the example of how
[1:34:42] sometimes there's people that you don't
[1:34:43] really want to go on a car long car ride
[1:34:45] with and and and people that you just
[1:34:47] can't sit long with and talk and I I
[1:34:50] feel like that I can just about put up
[1:34:51] with just about anybody but I just can't
[1:34:53] hardly stand meanness but Jesus would go
[1:34:57] to the Pharisees house and maybe that's
[1:35:00] something that I need to struggle on
[1:35:01] because it just it just tears me up to
[1:35:03] see somebody being bullied or somebody
[1:35:05] being mean to somebody else I don't want
[1:35:07] to sit in a car on car ride for six
[1:35:09] hours with somebody that's mean and
[1:35:10] insulting but Jesus did Jesus would go
[1:35:14] where he was invited even if it was by
[1:35:16] an old meanie like Pharisee this
[1:35:19] Pharisee he he Jesus will go whenever
[1:35:21] he's invited he'll come he went to a
[1:35:23] line then one time he came to a fiery
[1:35:26] furnace even David said if I make my bed
[1:35:29] in hell he will be there that if you
[1:35:32] invite him he'll come and and this
[1:35:34] morning that's something to meditate on
[1:35:35] if you want God all you got to do is
[1:35:37] invited because you've got a promise
[1:35:38] laying there that if you draw nigh to
[1:35:40] him if you'll just open your heart up an
[1:35:42] invitation that Jesus will come Jesus
[1:35:45] will come even if you've got meanness in
[1:35:47] your heart if you'll just invite him or
[1:35:50] to think about that he he'll come just
[1:35:53] open up your heart even even if he knows
[1:35:56] you're going to make fun of him when he
[1:35:57] gets there even if he knows you're going
[1:35:59] to sit him over in a corner he'll
[1:36:02] come Jesus brother Brown said no matter
[1:36:05] what your conditions and positions and
[1:36:07] life is he will still come that's what
[1:36:10] makes him God to me humble I'll be
[1:36:15] there and when he got there you think
[1:36:18] about you think about that
[1:36:20] situation now if you're a little lamb
[1:36:22] sitting here today surely you've had
[1:36:24] many experiences where maybe you were
[1:36:25] put over in a corner and everybody was
[1:36:27] laughing at you you can put yourself in
[1:36:30] that situation and think about Jesus
[1:36:32] sitting over there in that corner and
[1:36:33] everybody poking fun of it and making
[1:36:35] fun of the way he was and well he says
[1:36:38] he's a prophet he says he's this he he
[1:36:40] says he believes this message all of
[1:36:43] those different kind of things and those
[1:36:45] Pharisees didn't like Jesus they hated
[1:36:47] him now now look we're this is a lesson
[1:36:50] in
[1:36:51] discernment you watch the devil
[1:36:54] the devil all the time will make fun of
[1:36:57] the thing that's
[1:36:58] real will make fun of the thing that's
[1:37:02] true he's going to mock it he's going to
[1:37:04] scorn it and this little woman as The
[1:37:07] Story Goes On I'm trying to wrap it up
[1:37:08] here when she come around she observed
[1:37:12] that this Pharisees attitude was Jesus
[1:37:15] was like that and it picked her entrance
[1:37:18] interest is what brother rown said oh
[1:37:22] that's that's that should strike us you
[1:37:24] know when you hear somebody say well I
[1:37:25] wouldn't listen to that brother over
[1:37:26] there I wouldn't listen to that Prophet
[1:37:29] well if that's what the church world is
[1:37:31] saying of this day I should piak our
[1:37:33] interest like it did this little
[1:37:35] prostitute she know she knew something
[1:37:38] of them was real you know Jesus and this
[1:37:41] Pharisee didn't have any fellow they
[1:37:43] couldn't have any Fellowship because
[1:37:44] there was their Spirits were
[1:37:46] different right that was there was no
[1:37:51] commonality and I'm sorry y'all I gotta
[1:37:55] I gotta hit this before we close y'all
[1:37:58] bear with me just a little bit longer
[1:37:59] look when you see brother Brown would
[1:38:01] lay it out that when you see young
[1:38:02] people and old people together
[1:38:04] something's wrong cuz you can't how can
[1:38:06] you going to have Fellowship in
[1:38:08] common when you when you see somebody
[1:38:10] fellowshipping with somebody that's
[1:38:12] telling dirty jokes and hanging around
[1:38:14] their Spirits should be different
[1:38:17] amen people that like Darkness
[1:38:19] depression and drama like hanging around
[1:38:22] other people like that that's right now
[1:38:24] that's why Christians don't like being
[1:38:26] around someone that likes all the
[1:38:27] homosexual jokes and death and suicide
[1:38:29] and mocking and bullying and all all
[1:38:32] that kind of
[1:38:33] perversion and that's why this Pharisee
[1:38:35] and Jesus could not have communion
[1:38:37] because their Spirits were different
[1:38:40] amen aren't you glad this morning that
[1:38:42] you're out of place in a bar on a honky
[1:38:44] tonk in a skating rink or in the wrong
[1:38:47] part of town or that you're out of place
[1:38:49] in a cold dead
[1:38:51] Church oh but when the Holy Ghost is is
[1:38:53] moving you feel right at home you feel
[1:38:56] right at home amongst other believers
[1:38:59] amongst other little sheep amongst other
[1:39:02] little
[1:39:02] doves amongst other Little
[1:39:05] Eagles all where the spirits moving
[1:39:09] aren't you glad that you feel right at
[1:39:10] home in the house of the Living God
[1:39:12] where we can praise and worship where we
[1:39:14] can just turn loose and be be
[1:39:17] ourselves and I'm going to end on that
[1:39:19] as the musicians come
[1:39:21] forward that Pharisee over at Jesus and
[1:39:24] he just left him with his dirty
[1:39:27] feet mocking him and scorning him how
[1:39:30] did he get dirty brother Brandon would
[1:39:32] say because he come down and got dirty
[1:39:35] with us he come down in Old Dirty
[1:39:38] manger and come down on a on a old dirty
[1:39:42] cross come down and they nail them old
[1:39:45] dirty nails into his feet and into his
[1:39:48] hands and he got dirty for us and that's
[1:39:52] mean that's why he would say that's the
[1:39:53] meanest man I know somebody that
[1:39:57] wouldn't feel for a man like that that
[1:40:00] would come down from glory and pay the
[1:40:02] price for us come down from glory
[1:40:07] and and die for us so that we could have
[1:40:09] his
[1:40:10] life what a reaction that would be to
[1:40:13] put him over in the
[1:40:15] corner and not do for
[1:40:18] him you know that that doorma was
[1:40:20] supposed to have put the soft slippers
[1:40:22] on his feet
[1:40:23] and anointed him washed him up got him
[1:40:25] cleaned up and got him got him all
[1:40:27] presentable but to to think that the god
[1:40:29] of Glory was left over in the corner
[1:40:32] there and a little prostitute woman if
[1:40:35] we'll stand to our feet a little
[1:40:38] prostitute woman was willing to do more
[1:40:41] for
[1:40:43] Jesus than a man that had been Ed
[1:40:46] educated in all the religious thought of
[1:40:47] the
[1:40:49] day that mean man sitting over in that
[1:40:51] corner that mean man watching in
[1:40:55] Jesus oh won't we open up our hearts to
[1:40:58] him
[1:40:59] today I wonder if we could say like like
[1:41:02] brother
[1:41:03] brandom I I wish that I was more
[1:41:06] Pentecostal I wish that I had more of
[1:41:08] God I wish that I prayed more I wish
