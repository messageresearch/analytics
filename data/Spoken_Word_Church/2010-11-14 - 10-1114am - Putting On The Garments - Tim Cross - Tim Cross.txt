heart's desire this morning amen amen i trust we come not to see one another but to see him high and lift it up amen god bless you i'll invite you to take your seats this morning and uh before we go into the word i'll just uh see if my wife has a song maybe she wants to sing this morning and we worship the lord together for just a few more moments before we go into the message just like to say it's a privilege to be with you again i think it's been close to two years since we were last here and it's good to see everyone looks like everyone's doing well and smiling and happy and just looking forward to a good time in the lord this morning amen um so through so many dangers and toils of this life i have already gone but he keeps on giving the grace and the strength to just keep pressing on he's given a is i'll never fear whatever lies ahead he already said i'll just keep trusting that he's working everything for my good is through in spite of the good intentions i've had sometimes my strength can fail and though i have tried the very best that i could my weaknesses prevent but that's when i remember the promise he made that in my weakness he is oh just keep trusting that he's working is through do you believe you're going to make it this morning he that started a good work in you amen will be faithful to perform it till the day of jesus christ i'm sure thankful i don't have to rely on my own righteousness this morning to make it into the kingdom of heaven amen i was just talking to a lady this week and she was sharing with me uh the desire of her heart for her children for her husband and uh she was raised baptist and her husband has always been raised well he was actually he was raised baptist but he didn't convert it over to methodist and she was telling me and she was weeping she said i'm so concerned for my husband she said he lives such a sad life she said he believes he's going to make it to heaven based on his good life and his good works and she said he's very uncomfortable even going into a baptist church hearing what she described as hellfire and brimstone preaching she said that makes him uncomfortable but she said he doesn't realize he needs the grace of jesus christ he needs the blood of christ to wash him from his sins and i tell you one thing we're blessed to have that realization this morning because it's not our own works our own good deeds if we had to rely on that we would be lost without hope amen but we have a sacrifice amen we have an atonement that has been made on our behalf and with confidence in that and with faith in that we can press through this journey and know that at the end he'll be standing there with open arms to receive us into his kingdom amen well the lord bless you this morning i'm going to invite you to stand and turn with me in your bibles to romans chapter 13 and we'll begin reading it romans 13 verse 11. we want to be in prayer for brother samuel dale and brother wade is there out ministering there this morning that the lord had blessed their visit there and bless the services bless their time of rest there and relaxing and just enjoying some fellowship with the brothers i know what it's like to uh to need to get some time like that and just kind of refresh yourself amen so we trust the lord's blessings will be with them i heard the brother said many were out this morning not feeling well want to hold them in prayer but believing the lord will come also and meet with us this morning amen just before we read this portion of scripture let's go to the author of the word in prayer heavenly father it is indeed a privilege and an honor together this morning with saints of like precious faith lord in this place of worship that's been set aside as a sanctuary for your children to come into lord and to come out from under the cares of life the burdens of the world that concerns lord and the things that we have to shoulder the load from day to day lord to have an opportunity to come into a haven of rest lord and just to come into the presence of the shekinah glory father god where you can minister strength and nourishment and refreshment lord to our bodies our spirits and our souls father as we draw near to the end of all things lord and the climax of the rapture lord daily we gain a greater realization lord of our need for you and lord our need to gather like this with one another and draw strength father from your word and from the fellowship of like precious saints saints of light precious faith lord father god this gathering this morning would be in vain except that you would come by your holy spirit into our midst lord we know by your promised word that you are here and lord we give honor and we give reverence father we give praise and glory unto thee this morning oh god may we not as simon lord allow you to come into this place of worship unrecognized and unattended to father but god may we realize that you're in our midst this morning and may we go father god over to the corner as it were lord or to the place lord where we would have to humble ourselves father god to worship you and thank you and praise you for what you have done and what you continue to do in our hearts and lives father as we read your word this morning and as i endeavor lord is your servant lord to yield myself into the leadership of the holy spirit lord may we also lord as your children lord pull our chairs up to the table as it were to receive and let the holy spirit go into our hearts and our lives father god and search our hearts lord and find those areas lord where we need to be strengthened and nourished lord and minister to that lord we may grow to become more like you bless this service this morning we pray and bless each one who's been faithful lord to put forth the effort and make their way to the house of god this morning lord we want to be mindful of those who are unable to be here this morning that your holy spirit will go lord your omnipresent will you go lord and minister to them lord we pray for brothers samuel and brother wade and brother richard lord the others that are there in fellowship lord and service for the king may you bless their gathering this morning father bless their efforts there for your kingdom bless their time of fellowship lord and as their hunting lord and resting their lord i pray that your holy spirit will go and minister to them lord strengthen and refresh in them lord encourage them lord give them a renewed zeal for the kingdom of god for lost souls and lord for this portion of the bride that you have placed in here lord lord to be servants to and to prepare our hearts lord for your soon coming lord o god have your way i pray in this service today lord i'm mindful of the fact that these services are broadcast lord where others will at some point be listening in lord god i pray that you'll minister to their hearts father god have your way lord as you bring us all lord to the statue of a perfect man lord may you mold us and shape us into your very image lord take away everything that's unlike you father god that when the world looks upon us they may see you and you only granted father pray lord for the meeting there this morning lord as i spoke with brother dutch scott pray that you'll bless that joint meeting there with uh brother the congregation there where brother scott pastors and brother padgett and lord brother ernie villanueva as your servant there pray you'll bless their gathering father god lord is your bride is gathered across the world father may you have your perfect will and way in every service every gathering we thank you for it lord and now we just commit this into your hands and we ask these blessings in jesus christ let me pray amen romans chapter 13 beginning in verse 11. the bible says and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and waltonness not in strife and envying i want to place special emphasis on verse 14 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and made not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof let's read that verse together again but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning and in just a few moments we'll turn and also read from galatians chapter three but i want to take for a thought this morning or for a title putting on the garments putting on the garments and paul here as he writes to the roman church there he commends them to put on the lord jesus christ and we'll also read here in galatians chapter three we'll just read verses 26 and 27 and his paul here also addresses the galatian church and i believe the prophet of god exhorts us to see ourselves in the word of god amen and here in verse 26 of galatians chapter 3 paul says for ye are all the children that would also be the offspring amen you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ amen how many is that's your heart's desire this morning is to put on christ now turn with me also to the book of titus and if you will just read for read with me here just to establish a little bit of a foundation and titus chapter 2 we'll read two verses of scripture here and from this portion of scripture is where i begin to receive inspiration for the thought that we'll deal with this morning and i want to say this too that um i've been ministering now on this thought for about the past three or four services and it just keeps unfolding and opening up into more and more things and i don't i don't suppose we'll be able to cover all of those things this morning in this service but i just trusting the leadership of the holy spirit to guide me into what areas would be his perfect will for this service this morning and then from these things i trust it will stimulate your your thoughts and your interests in these things from the word of god because i believe it has a very relevant application to where you and i are in this hour now at the end of time and as the bride of christ but paul here is exhorting titus as a in the pastoral work as he is here dealing with the church and you know uh when we minister when we gather in a group like this we have people from all walks of life you know and and titus here was dealing with uh people in the congregation perhaps there were some who were wealthy who were been prosperous in life maybe they were held in high esteem or high regard and then there were some who who worked in servanthood and even in this time in this in this era of time it was very common to have slavery and i think that much of the church was made up at that time of slaves and of common people and people much like you and i today you know so he's exhorting titus here in chapter 2 and verse 9. he says to titus exhort servants to be obedient and to their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again and in verse 10 he says not perlini that word also means stealing or thievery not pervoiding but showing all good fidelity now watch this that they may adorn that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things and i i tell you how i came across this scripture was uh as part of a bible study that i'm a part of there every wednesday morning and and this is a a group of about six or seven men and they come from all denominations and all backgrounds only only two of us there are believers of the message and some are coming into it but the two of us there have been raised and spent many years studying in the prophet's message but we came across this scripture in our bible reading three or four weeks ago and it was very uh it was very interesting to us how that paul uses the phrase adorn the doctrine of god right and you know we think of that word adorn and we're coming up now we're approaching the christmas season where we you know put or so the world at least puts decorations on their homes they put adornments and all these things on their home they you know deck the halls and they put the uh the the lights and the mistletoe and all these things the glitter and the gold on the on the trees and on their homes and you think of adorning in that way we could think of adorning perhaps with jewelry uh you know whether i have a tie chain on this morning you know or maybe a pen or sometimes the sisters will wear something i think they call a brooch you know it's just something they they pin onto their clothes as part of the garment they're wearing uh you know the boy scouts or the girl scouts get merit badges and they put those things on their uniform to indicate their labors or their efforts or some area they have specialized in but paul here is speaking to titus and in the king james translation of this from the hebrew into english adorned means to put on as a garment it's something that we're to wear it's something that we're to clothe ourselves in and when i began to think of it in that regard then it you know brother ma'am talked about the roman candle how it goes off and it just continues bursting forth and as we were sitting around the table there at a little coffee shop and one of the brothers i think he's from a lutheran background he he just took special note of that that phrase there and i was looking at this other brother who's a believer you know in our minds we went back to the garden of eden when satan came and deceived eve there with the temptation and then she uh went to adam and adam and eve went immediately and began to sow fig leaves together to create a covering to put on a religion that would hopefully appease a holy god amen because they had a desire to be admitted back into his presence but there was something there where they realized they would have to be dressed in something even that would enable them to enter back into his presence and they put all the fig leaves it was their best effort it was their best attempt they meant to please god but it wasn't sufficient amen it took jehovah god it took elohim to provide them with a sacrifice that he alone would be pleased with amen and he alone could provide that for them right amen it was nothing they could conjure up there was nothing they could formulate it was nothing they would in their own mental powers could ever come up with to please god that's right hey my oh he's jehovah god will provide for himself a sacrifice right oh we begin to think of that i thought of joseph and the code of many colors i thought of the hebrew children down in babylon how the nebuchadnezzar tried to change their clothing to represent the babylonian tastes and the babylonian fashions and designs and things of that hour amen and those hebrew children absolutely resisted that amen they said we're not going to dress in your clothes we're not going to borrow from your fashions we're not going to try to please the modern world around us we are going to maintain our hebrew heritage we are going to maintain our identity we are going to maintain our place of origin the country that we come from the letters that we come from we are the royal seed of abraham and we're not ashamed to dress like him oh my how that must have been a rebuke in the face of all the other jews and all the other hebrews amen that were compromising their standards and compromising their convictions how they must have come up to those young people and said well you won't be popular you won't be accepted you won't fit in they couldn't argue with that right amen right you might as well accept it we're gonna be down here in bondage for so many hundreds of years because the prophet jeremiah prophesied it and if you believe the prophet you might as well just like it you might as well just get used to it we're trapped in this laodicea we're trapped in this babylon so you might as well just give up on your convictions give up on your morals give up on your standards because it's not gonna do this it's not gonna do that and it's not gonna do all these other things but there was something else those garments wouldn't do they wouldn't burn amen there was a special quality to those garments that they had been trusting and because the hebrew children refused to compromise and refused to allow their speaking to be influenced in the babylonian direction god came and reinforced their testimony amen the holy god elohim thought the job was so important for the aaron that he wouldn't assign it to an archangel amen he said those hebrew children aren't taking a stand for angels they're not taking a stand for their pastor they're not taking a stand for this one or that one they are standing for me and i'm going to go down there and stand for them it's important brother and sister there's a great significance pardon me there's a great significance to our garments and paul is exhorting titus to adorn the doctrine of god i save you in all things i think of doctrine and i know at times in my life i have gone through phases i've gone through periods of time when i put a lot of emphasis on my beliefs my doctrines being precise you know and because of the way the the light has shown upon the revealed word of this hour there has never been a moment in time when so much revelation was made available all the truths that were lost down through the dark ages everything that was forfeited in icy rome has been restored and in addition to that christ himself has descended in this hour amen to tear the seals off the book and to make available to the bride of christ truths and revelations that have never been made available to man in the history of time amen so we're living a tremendous hour brother and sister but there is also an effort on the part i believe of our enemy to get us so focused on being precise in our theology okay to be placed so much emphasis on how right we are we've got the truth and the god we've got the truth of water baptism in jesus name we've got the truth of serpenty we can explain it we can articulate it we can detail it and then we can prove our point with the best of it amen there is not a modern religion or theologian in the world that can withstand the truth that the bride of christ takes for common knowledge now that's right hey man i like one brother yesterday liking it you said we have a nuclear arsenal and the best that the denominations can offer would be relative to a bb gun now that's the truth brother that is not an exaggeration however to whom much is given much is required we have been given a sacred trust and it is in our it is in our discretion how we present that to the world that's right and you will notice here if you read in the book of titus paul is not dealing so much with being doctrinally precise but he's getting down where the rubber meets the road he's getting down in the lives and the conduct of the people on a day-to-day basis right how we handle our be ourselves at work right how we hold ourselves amen not just when we come to church why it's easy to be a christian then it's easy for our halos you know to shine then but it's when you go out of these doors it's when you go into the fiery furnace it's when you're going to the laodicean pressure cooker it's when the children have to go to the public schools or the college campuses or the university or the sister you know has to go down to the workplace or the brothers has to go down amongst centers say that our conducts our behavior our actions amen shows if we have truly had an experience and the world doesn't care how revelated you are they don't care how doctrinally precise you are they want to see jesus that's right they are dying for a lack of love they're dying for a lack of the manifestation of the life of christ and paul is saying we need to adorn ourselves with the doctrine of god ourselves not just have our list you know i believe this i believe that i've got the truth on all of these wonderful things but if we don't have a life left behind it it's all in vain though i know all the mysteries and have not love i'm as a sounding breast and a tinkling symbol so this is this is coming down where the robber meets the road right brother brown says lived voices thundering out that's the thunder that shakes the devil come on amen notice jesus never came to satan in the temptation wilderness and said don't you know on the immaculate conception don't you know out of the virgin born manifestation of god wrapped in a robe of flesh he never attacked satan with doctrine right satan was trying to attack jesus it is written it is written but the written word versus the written word that's right it won't do it that's right you're not going to defeat the devil with your quotes you're not going to defeat the devil with your intellectual understanding of the bible in the message you're not going to defeat the devil amen with your ten commandments you pharisee you're going to defeat the devil in the life of jesus christ the dynamics comes and strikes those mechanics and makes you a living son and daughter of god amen and that's when you have put on christ amen when you have died to yourself you have been stripped of all your ideas and your ways and your notions and your premonitions and you have died out completely to that right then christ can come and live through you right right hey amen amen isaiah 61 verse 3 says oh my let me just turn and read it there so i don't misquote it just looking at garments for a moment we want to bring this down to the bride of christ by the grace of god isaiah 61 we're just beginning at verse verse 1 there jesus used this text there in the temple the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek brother brown said live your sermon amen that's what preaching really is living your sermon out before the world preach good tidings unto the meek he had sent me to bind up the broken heart to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn brother sister this is our charge this is our charge as the bride of christ as the living tabernacles in which he now dwells and reveals himself to the world verse 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning how many members in the third seal around dealing with stimulation of revelation touch not the wine and the oil amen oh the oil of joy for morning what what an exchange here what a train the garbage of praise for the spirit of heaviness there is a garment of rejoicing there is a garment of worship there is a garment of praise that god wants to wrap you in god wants to appoint unto you not that you deserved it not that you've earned it but that you have come and you've made an exchange you have laid down upon the altar of sacrifice amen a spirit of heaviness a spirit i will say of laodicea a spirit of depression a spirit of indifference a spirit of apathy a spirit of i don't care you've got to lay that down because god has a current of praise that you need to be dressed in so you can enter into his courts hey man what did david say i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his court with praise now as the bride of jesus christ there is a secret place there is a hiding place there is a sheltering man that we must be in for the rapture to take in the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide me brother joe in his pavilion there is a place of perfect rest near to the heart of god amen as the world is going into insanity and chaos the bride has entered into a rest she's entered into a chamber she's entered into a holy place the holiest of holy say man but to go there you must be dressed right in a certain way amen he's appointed this this garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord oh my i the lord have planted it no man shall pluck them out of my hand that he might be glorified we're not seeking our own glory our lives our brokenness our fragments of shattered glass and clay and tiled upon the ground is that he may receive glory and honor to take the broken pieces of our hearts and minds and to reshape them into molded into a vessel however for his service that he as the potter might receive glory and how he has fashioned the clay amen that he might be glorified down verse 10 david said our isaiah says i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels oh brother this isn't something that we selected this isn't something that we went down to walmart or jc pennies or dealers or coals or belts or something in the selected but we have been dressed hallelujah in a garment that he selected for you and i before the foundation of the world oh my we have been adorned with his glory with his jewels with his righteousness even with the animals and the substance of an earth that he created he has appointed this to you and i dress in this my lovely bride dress in this the feminine expression of himself amen right praise the lord james 1 chapter 27 you don't have to turn there but it says pure and undefiled religion is this to visit the fathers fatherless and the widows and to keep himself unspotted from the world we've got a great charge amen we've been dressed in robes of righteousness pure linen pure fine white linen which is the righteousness of saints the book of revelation says but once we've been dressed in that then our daily walk amen the path that we choose we must avoid the things that will spot and stain and mar the garments and when we should amen come in contact with something amen that puts a stain on our testimony we must immediately go for cleansing amen we must immediately go to the high priest to be cleansed and sanctified and to have our robes restored to their original condition amen i want to look this morning by the grace of god at the very quickly we are all familiar with the story of asking and how that came about when king of hazarus was displeased with the conduct of the queen vashta and because she exalted herself into a position that was inappropriate for her she challenged the beckoning of the king right she was rendered from the kingdom she was stripped of her position she was stripped of the crown and the royal robes that she had been dressed in to signify to the world that she held the position of the queen of the land and when this decree was made in the laws of means and persians then it was determined by the councillors that they would bring in the young maidens the young virgins there to be brought before the king for consideration as to who would become the next queen now if you recall the story there were many many young virgins that were eligible candidates that were qualified to come into the house of the of the virgins there the house of the young maidens and the bible says they were giving up one years of beauty one year beauty treatments six months of oil and myrrh and six months of all these things my they you know this was before the days of the ultimate makeover you know but you you can just see how they all they all were given the same treatment they were all given the same consideration they all had an equal opportunity to go before the king they were all virgins they were all qualified in that sense but here in esther chapter 2 esther chapter 2 verse 15 remember regardless of how many dozens or how many hundreds or how many thousands of qualified candidates were to come in review before the king only one could be appointed to the throne so it was going to require something really special a man to attract the interest of the king and i think we can see here it was going to take more than beauty because no doubt they all were beautiful he was going to take even more than uh virtue because they were all virtuous maybe they had kept themselves pure and virtuous to be married someday and to be to be a suitable wife for a husband and here they're brought in consideration so it's going to take something more than her beauty he was going to take something more than even her virtue it was going to take an inward quality that only the king could recognize as being fit or suitable to make it to that throne and to share with his power amen to share his majesty to share his governing authority over that land amen right so the bible says in verse 15 of esther chapter 2 now when the turn of esther the daughter of abile the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king look at this she required nothing she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain and the keeper of the women appointed there was an appointed provision there was an appointed measure amen there was an appointed message amen there was an appointed word for esther and when she amen applied that word now it's one thing to have the garment it's another thing to have it hanging in your wardrobe it's another thing to pull it out and admire it every day it's another thing to have it on the books and tapes it's another thing to have it up on the shelf collecting dust but brother she had to put it on amen amen she dressed herself per the instruction of the prophet she dressed herself per the direction of higgy i who is a representative of the king and he had been challenged he had been charged with the responsibility of bringing before a hazarist a queen hallelujah how many virgins how many young maidens had come under the instruction of habeat how many young women had heard that message had seen those provisions and said i need something more that message isn't sufficient to satisfy what i believe it will take to appease the king so they had they heard the message they heard the word they heard the voice of the king's chamberlain and then they went out and said but amen i'll run down here to the cosmetics store and get some eyeliner you know i'll uh put a perm in my hair i'll get some highlights you know i'm not picking on the sisters you understand but look at the spiritual that's right they were never satisfied with the simplicity right of the revealed word amen it wasn't glittery enough for them it wasn't shiny enough for it it didn't stimulate their interest remember because they're all in their minds what will it take to catch the king's eye what will it take to differentiate me from the dozens or hundreds or thousands of other young sisters that will come and review so you know these these maybe women don't think like this i wouldn't know but if i were one of these young mates i would be thinking what i want to get in the mind of the king i want to get into his thoughts i'd be studying him i'd be reading on him i'd be looking at his history i'd be studying queen vashtai what was it about her that he didn't like what did he see in her initially that won his favor and then what surfaced later on to uh cause his refusal and dismissal of her i'd be saying that but you know ultimately it came down to that young that young lady she's thinking this will will set me apart you know i'll i'll get some of these special heels you know i i'll i'll go and have this dress altered to be a little more suited to my form or my you know makeup uh you know these things were given to me by my genetic makeup so i'll alter the dress to suit what i think in my mind will appease the king and that was what disqualified all of them no doubt as some of them just think about this now amongst with churches no doubt some of those beautiful virtuous young ladies would come before the king and no doubt if you could see the thought bubble above his head see i've got i've got to talk to haggai where did she get those heels where did she come up with that hairdo where did she get those gaudy earrings i mean they stood out in his mind but for all the wrong reasons they differentiated themselves they distinguished themselves but it was all for the wrong reasons i don't remember ever instructing heavy eye that way i don't remember ever giving those prada shoes for her to wear i don't ever remember that uh gucci purse you know or whatever where did she come up with those hard rim glasses that oh my goodness those don't suit her much less my taste you see what i'm saying but they were all making a special effort to dress up and snazz up the message or to deviate from the simplicity of its instructions because they wanted to be a little different than the rest oh god help us but esther required nothing but what had been appointed whatever he supplies is sufficient whatever he has given to dress me in is all i need i don't need the l'oreal i don't need the max factor i don't need the covergirl i don't need the cosmopolitan i don't need to borrow from the modern fashions and trends of this day to try to appease the king's taste or win his favor amen if what he has provided dressed upon me or adorned upon me isn't suitable to meet his favor then i simply won't meet his favor if what he provided and what he appointed isn't sufficient enough then so be it amen i believe as the bride of christ that's the attitude we need to have i don't need john hagee's message i don't need james dobson's psychology i don't need some trinitarian influence to come mix into the pot to become mixed into my religious formula to win god's approval and to make a rapture amen god has provided us with a message a rapture message he's provided us with the fullness of the revelation of who he is to enable us to come to the recognition of who we are as the feminine expression of himself and whatever he provides for that that daughter of god to wear will be sufficient for the bride now thank god esther had that inward quality she had character that was fit to rule you know i i would i would suppose that there were other other ladies other young sisters who by modern standards would look better would win the beauty contest but they were lacking the character and the character you can't put a price tag on that brother sister you can't put a value on that and he said that's what i need in the throne i don't want a jezebel that the kings of all the other countries are going to be nested after i don't need a jackie o'nasus or michelle or whatever you know some woman to lead the modern trends i need godly character and virtue here on the throne beside me something that will not detract from the glory of the king but something that will actually complement his glory and his rulership and his governing authority and long after he is the king their natural king is dead in god his legacy will live all look at his choice for companion look at his choice for what look at his choice for king and that character will be reflected throughout the subjects of his kingdom amen oh how many thank god that you've been selected amen how many thank god i'm so thankful brother and sister that the simplicity of the message is enough to satisfy my taste i don't need anything more i wouldn't settle for anything less amen he has provided us in this hour a garment that will win his favor by thinking of ruth and i'm trying to work toward it toward a goal here thinking of ruth there a moabitess a gentile completely outside of redemption amen completely outside the economy of god no uh no merits of her own nothing to earn any recognition or position you understand what i'm saying but just almost seeming like by chance or happenstance there naomi and elimelech and maelon and those sons went down into that gentile land and their ruth marries and then her husband dies and naomi's husband dies and the other ruth's comrade there her her friend there orpha her husband dies and here ruth finds herself with this desire with this attraction to her mother-in-law who is under redemption who does have rights who does have a place and a position in a promised land under a promise of almighty god jehovah to abraham and his seed after him naomi with this hope amen with this attraction to draw her back to the homeland then ruth finds an attraction within herself to naomi where you go i will go where you lodge i will lodge your people shall be my people and your god shall be my god so for reasons that ruth doesn't even understand necessarily she's saying things things are coming forth from her lips that even she doesn't comprehend she finds herself going down into a strange land and she finds herself out in this field gleaming and here comes boaz the king of the harvest and he's riding all on this white horse and he spots ruth there gleaning in the field and she grabs his eye she attracts his attention and there she goes back in this great love affair amen begins to be kindled between ruth and boaz and notice she has to go home to naomi to receive teaching to receive instruction to be able to begin to understand the laws of redemption and it comes down here in ruth chapter 3. let's just read it there together i hope this isn't too much scripture for you this morning but there's a great love story unfolding here that's going to be a type of a great invisible union between a gentile bride a man and christ the son of god the bible says in route 3 chapter 1 naomi is a type of israel the bible says then they owe me her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast oh my you were right there in there with the churches you were right there gathered with the other denominations these amen we're candidates to become wise to boaz behold he went to its barley tonight in the threshing floor now ruth has no comprehension of the significance of the things that naomi is fixing to tell her but in verse 3 naomi says wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known until the man until he shall have done eating and drinking shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will temple thee what thou shalt do now this in many regards was somewhat of a risky amen proposition right for ruth to go down here and do this was a 50 50 chance that it would either go very bad right or very well right and ruth doesn't even understand perhaps the the consequences or the full breadth of the risk that she's taking here but she trusts naomi she says in verse 5 she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law baker when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou now think of this it's dark it's pitch black he can't see a thing she can't see it she knows of who he is but he has no idea at this point who she is and so in the middle of the night he wakes up someone's lying at his feet he sits up he looks down he says who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid watch this spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmade for the apple heart a near cancer spread you're kingly garnets i'm dressed right in the robes of widowhood my husband is dead right i have nothing i am not i have no rights i have no position i have no home i have no land i have no family i'm a nobody and i'm dressed in the robes that signify or indicate just who i am but you are a near kinsman right by a marriage relationship right hallelujah by a husband who came into my country and i married him but now he's dead amen and i have been admitted back into a country and back into a land and now i realize i am kin to you amen hallelujah you have become kin to me the great god of glory elohim laid down his kingly garments and he came to earth and took all the robe of flesh and he became a sinner he became sin i should say because he that knew no sin became sin for us amen he became sin he became in the likeness of human flesh to redeem back a jewish bride who had forfeited him that's right hallelujah and here comes a gentile bride and she says i recognize that you are the second person come on you are the third person you are god you wrote yourself in flesh to become a near kinsman speech and now she is requesting amen she is pleading stretch forth your majesty stretch forth your glory stretch forth your holiness and your righteousness and your omnipotent power over me that's right oh i feel like shouting and running a 10k race by now brother sister do you realize what was rejected by the jewish pride was too open and tolerant of opportunity for you and i totally totally separated from the economy and because a you're messenger this hour to reveal to you and i who we are right and who the kinsmen redeemer amen and just strip away our trinitarian ideas and to strip away all of the perversion and the corruption and the filth amen that satan had tried to pervert our minds and understanding a revealed word is unfolded in this hour amen to bring us right to the feet of the king and to ask him hallelujah some of the theologians some of the scholars some of the you know great minds of religion supposed that this was some form of seduction or this was some form of enticement all roots part nothing could be further from the truth this was a holy act of redemption this was a holy request on her part showing that she recognized who he was and what he could do on her behalf and not even fully comprehending the significance of this she was requesting redemption that's right she was requesting him amen oh my at all cost although it may mar his reputation although it may bring him reproach and shame among his people are you willing to stretch forth your spirit over me that i may be brought into your mind all right amen and he said i am willing hallelujah he went over and he took her veil and he filled it with six measures of barley hallelujah this will hold you over through the church ages until my return at the end to rapture and she went back home and she told naomi all of the wonderful things that happened right naomi said don't fidget don't worry right all his way all right you might as well rest you might as well relax you might as well trust because he will not rest until he has finished the work in the kitchen amen oh hallelujah i feel like praising god right now amen god has sent us a message in this hour to reveal to us that the kinsmen redeemers work is good as done don't you worry don't you try to earn your way don't you try to gain your weight amen just allow yourself to be dressed amen just allow this message to dress you brother sister because he has already determined he will not rest until the work is complete until that last name from the lamb's book of life has come to that recognition and realizes he has spread his spirit of redemption and when the last name that was on that last book of life comes to that realization brother that a change is going to sweep over you today and then a great resurrection then a great gathering time for 30 to 40 days we'll gather in a realm in a place a man in a realm that's unseen and unacknowledged and unrecognized by the world but it'll be a pavilion it'll be a place hallelujah it'll be a great gathering time right so that when he appears all eyes will be upon him i want to sing a song what a day that will be with my jesus i shall see brother brown says the very one you've worshipped will become personalized before you in the form of the holy ghost then you and he are one amen and all the hymns in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning wonderful wonderful jesus is to me can i continue on just for a few more moments amen so far brother nobody's sleeping praise the lord amen god is good to us brother sister god has done a marvelous thing in this hour i'm just thinking here we're living in an hour you know billy bennett preached the message he's the rising of the sun he spoke a quickening power spoke of the dynamics how it's required to strike those mechanics to have one without the other used to have a motionless automobile right amen right we must have the mechanics of the word we must have those doctrines right we must have those truths correctly placed in the word of god that's what the ministry of elijah did was restore the altar so that the fire of god the dynamics could come and quicken that's right and bring to life and to bring to manifestation that sacrifice upon the altar which was you and i amen we talked about two cadillacs one having no spark the other having sparked both identical and feature both identical in construction both identical in looks and appearance and even oh and function but one lacking the dynamics one lacking the power required to strike that gasoline that potential and to bring forth the manifestation of that octane amen to release and unleash that power that lay within that fuel so we got two cadillacs there and in this hour we've got a group that call themselves the queen of heaven we have a group that calls themselves the bride and in the church ages book brother brother says they will be held accountable as bright because they called themselves and proclaimed and professed himself to be right but there is also a true bride that's right an elected brother amen a predestinated bride with his virtue and character dwelling on the inside of her come on brother says this just looking for a moment at satan's bride but it says notice satan is not called the god of any other age but this age it was his ambition to be like god from the very beginning and he goes into isaiah 14 how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how art thou cast down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god and brother brown says sons of god do you realize satan's desire was to be exalted above you the stars of god represented was symbolic of the sons of god and in satan's desire and ambition to elevate himself above you and i he was cast down i will exalt my throne above the stars of god the red says the sons of god now and i will set also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and brother brennan says it was satan's ambition to be worshipped like god he took two-thirds of the stars of heaven ascended himself above those stars and preached to them reckoned what he preached yeah yet god said yeah yeah hath god says what he always preaches it is written right he preaches an intellectual understanding of the written word of god he deceived two-thirds of them preached to them to see two-thirds of them you see it all right now that's his ambition and now he is ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all painted up in his deceit of big buildings and big denominations and paints of knowledge and theology and smart and intellectual and educated to deceive the whole world and become a god that's what he's done that's what he's done all heading up into the person of the antichrist which is already crowned the viker of god listen to this in by how was he crowned by his worldly loving scientific bride all dressed up in pop of intellectual religious education she is made religious like him and by his own interpretation of the word of god as he did eve and as his son cain did how did how did satan deceive eve he enticed her using her mind eve just putting it into paraphrasing do you know your purpose do you know why god formed you and brought you into existence here on the earth you have potentials right you have abilities right right there there are power there's a power that lies within you should give birth has adam ever told you about this well no because it wasn't time yet so satan revealed to her her purpose using her body which was a creation of god but to accomplish his own objectives and means which was to sow his seed of discrepancy into creation amen so he come along using god's creation was his bible is that right his creation was in the stars and then nature but the premise of nature was his first bible right so satan came and used a bible used god's creation but he twisted its intent and meaning to accomplish his own objectives his own motives but in doing so he threw the entire creation into a simple state right now he does the same in this hour now he remember this and take note of this eve was naked but with a holy veil the prophet said she had no knowledge or comprehension of her condition right but satan came to her to entice her to become as a god she was already a god she was already an amateur god amen with co-equal with adam so satan used her very position to to work against her and to make her a god he rendered her naked because once his revelation that he gave her came into fruition she realized i'm naked that's right and then she began to try to clothe herself now satan does the same thing with his bride in this hour we read in revelations 3 you don't have to turn there but this laodicean church has in her mind which is satan's battleground in her mind she has an idea or a perception of how she appears i'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing that's her mental understanding that has been given to her by her god right satan all right you are beautiful you are clothed you are acceptable in the sight of god you're fine just go on the way you're going worship the way you're worshiping believe the way you're believing how could a holy and righteous and just god cast you into the lake of fire with all your beautiful denominations and glitter and gold and all the pop and splendor that but when god looks at her he says i know thy works i don't care what your profession is i see your hearts i see your actions i see your conduct i see your works and i say you don't even realize it but you're naked you're wretched you're poor you're miserable and you're blind right but you have been weaved a web of deceit so much so that you're in a disillusioned state you're in a deluded state of believing you are covered and believing you're clothed now think about the preview of the bride brother brown said he'd been in pig alley rome france new york city los angeles but he said the filthiest bunch of women i've ever seen in my life is jeffersonville indiana i've never seen so much gom and filth in my life as i see amongst them people he said he'd been in a shopping center right there in jeffersonville he said i sat there till my heart ached and the lord had given me a vision this is in the masterpiece 1964 he says now i'm going to tell the vision i don't know that i could interpret it but i'm going to television for my first time i failed into a trance and when i did there was somebody with me i didn't see the person it was just a voice and i looked and as i looked this way he said the bride will come in view for preview and i looked coming to me and i seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women i had i had ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women and they looked kind about say maybe about 20. now i want you to realize you know satan comes and he really gives his sisters a hard time the preachers is always bearing down on you the women haters but if you can realize it's the position you hold and it's what you are remember representing bride is feminine in designation but she's the feminine part of him right so brother babin says if you want to know the condition the church look at the women she's a representation of the bride whether it be christ bright or satan's right you understand so it's what you're representing you you have a sacred trust and then you have a tremendous charge that's been given to you brotherham says now i have the bible open here before me see i can only say what i see if you say what are you looking at looking at a clock what are you looking for i'm looking for people looking at people what are you looking at i'm looking at the bible i'm telling the truth that's what i see and i can only say what i see i don't know what all about it i just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at the one was talking to me and standing together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people i ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more i don't know how many was abreast but there was just a group of them and she passed by sweetly with the air in their eyes up watching as she passed by all she was beautiful i looked at her and as she passed by he said now we shall review he said that's the bride now we will review the churches now this is just like king of hazarus that's right and here's the chamberlain standing there and the voice is with him in there watching these come before the king for consideration and now remember the prophet doesn't think his own thoughts doesn't see his own sights he has seen this as god caesar are you with me he's watching this he's seeing these come into preview and he's viewing them as god because a prophet is the eyes of god amen and he says she's the sweetest cleanest cleanest sweetest looking people so that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come i notice them coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse i never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next i heard a noise and it said next said here comes the american group now i'm an american but this just made me sick i am not eloquent enough in a mixed audience to say what was taking place you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on the order you remember years ago you still remember we cut the paper you don't use paper and make an old fly bush how many remembers it you know and i think they used it in carnivals you know hanging down like that fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this holding below them all of this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and frizzy looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes now remember in that era of time women weren't dressed in this way yet the fashions the trends all these things hadn't developed to this level of vulgarity but the prophet seeing a vision and the vision is not only showing the natural state of the american women but it's showing the condition that the modern churches are going into you understand that i was just talking with a sister a few weeks ago she was raised in the mountains of west virginia her parents only got electricity a few years before they died and she told me that she moved from west virginia to north carolina to a city there called winston-salem she said brother tim i worked in a factory i worked in a factory she said i was unsaved she said but i wore sunday clothes i wore formal clothes from my home to the factory she said when i got to the factory then i would go into the changing room and train change out of my formal wear into a uniform a factory workers uniform like coveralls or something of that nature she said i worked all day in the factory and then before going home i went back and changed into a dress and a blouse and some type of formal shoes now this was the united states of america probably in the 60s lord about today you hear brother brown say if a woman dressed if the woman went out on the street like that 20 years ago she had been locked up forbid and say that's the truth friends that's the truth look at how the dress of the people has degraded to such a condition now and here the prophet seeing it 40 years 50 years before it even manifests but it's showing the spiritual condition are you with me still they looked nothing but look like street prostitutes and there they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper what was hold in front of them but when they passed the review stead in the back of them and to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting i thought is that the church and there she went and they were singing this here twist and roll songs you know whatever what you call going down singing like going behind i said is that the church and i was standing there and in my heart i was crying remember brother brown was feeling the charge he's feeling the burden as the king's chamberlain he was accountable to how these women were presented before the review of the king so he's crying in his heart and he said and this witch to my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's that world council of churches leading them right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side into the other side and then like that carrying on like that walking and i started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again remember that first bride he went on later to explain that was the alpha that was the early christian church she started off with the standard of holiness she started off with the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ she started off with the baptism of the holy ghost and signs and wonders following and the way he started her the way he dressed her there on the day of pentecost and provided the holy spirit his robe of righteousness over is the same way he's going to finish your way amen the bride must come again and i looked and here they come again and as they passed by sweet looking little ladies they was all looking right at me as they pass by hey amen they required nothing but what the king's chamberlain appointed them oh we've got this message amen is the voice of god amen coming through the lips of the seventh angel messenger brother we need to keep our eyes on that that's christ in the form of his word if we will stay with our eyes on the mirror of god's word we will find very quickly whether or not we meet the requirements of that message because that is the only thing that will permit to be going into his presence amen how many is keeping your eyes on on the word of god keeping your eyes on the message of the hour a lot are coming now and trying to doctor it up dress it up modernize it upgrade it improve upon it doesn't need any doesn't need any improvements amen the medicine will work good just straight as it was served originally amen i noticed each one was all dressed different and one in the back kind of had had kind of long hair hanging down and they had rolled around like this might have been german or something like that and i watched them and they started leaving two or three of them in the back get out of step and i was going to holler at them and they was trying to get back and step again and i seen them just a vision just fade out and change from me tell you one thing that prophet's voice is still crying today get back in get back instead amen don't get your eyes on that witch don't get your eyes on that worldly church system don't be influenced by what appears to be success and prosperity and they're feeling up their churches they're feeling up their pews they're busting at the same brother it's the tares being bound for burning amen you say brother tim that's straight that's the truth amen satan is singing a song to them he's preaching a message to them to address them for a burning to gather them and bind them for a burning but the bride is heard a voice hey man she was singing a song too onward christians soldiers marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before amen same message that paul preached right here brother ben and priest amen the same bride paul said i have espoused you to one husband and the seventh angel messenger came in to take that bride right into the presence of her groom and so here she is dressed in your word dressed in your holiness dressed in your righteousness oh my let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride have made herself ready let's stand this afternoon i've held you a little long i trust it's been a blessing to you amen amen my there's so many things that can be said about the garments as musicians come back lord prepare me to be a sanctuary the bible says in exodus chapter 28 that the sons of aaron god gave moses specific instructions on garments that was supposed to be made to enable i see brothers shaking his head back there he's right with me to enable those men to go and minister in the sanctuary and even aaron the high priest had to wear specially prepared garments to go into the holiest of holies and god told moses said i have given those hebrew children some of those israelites special wisdom in how to prepare these garments god has given the bride a prophet's message and a five-fold ministry special wisdom wisdom that has never been released before in all of time why to dress a bride to go right into his presence the world is fearful the world is scared they're afraid to approach his majesty but not esther hey man she's got a heart connection with the king the man on the throne and she steps in there and battles and he extends the golden center amen welcome my bride what is your need what is your request you can have anything up to half the kingdom i want the salvation of my two sons i want the salvation of my people i want to
