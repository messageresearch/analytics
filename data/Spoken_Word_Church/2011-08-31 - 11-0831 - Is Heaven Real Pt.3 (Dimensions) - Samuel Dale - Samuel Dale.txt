him well you know what that's laying just ahead of us we're just getting ready to see it okay good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures we'll go and read in Revelations 21 and then we'll read from Matthew 6 Revelation 21 Matthew 6 remember the Bible study now we'll this coming Saturday come and be with us and just have a good time fellowshipping and it's like it's just general questions and things that we're talking on so maybe there'll be some things after what we said we'll be stirred up a little bit you know to to uh help us with some questions and answers and also now on the October the 2nd uh the first Sunday in October brother Keith Reed will be coming by and preaching for us for the weekend on October October the the 2nd so I reckon We're not scheduled anything till we get about that far but then the month of October will be covered up with brother Reed and brother for is going to be with us and then brother um Ron Spencer be with we will be with us the end of the month they're preaching for us so remember that and just pray for him that the Lord would bless amen is that all the announcements I gener forget something and let's pray father we thank you we love you and we thank you for everything we ask you to just help us now as we Endeavor to speak about you and you come on the scene and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to look to you the author and finisher of our faith and just have your way now and keep us Lord touch the sick among us cuz we know that there's many things many needs but you said you was the Healer so we believe you and we thank you you're also the Savior the Redeemer the all in all in Jesus is your name amen and amen you may be I mean excuse me say you may be SE Revelations let's read Revelations 21 we just read a couple of verses because there still remember now we're still up in heaven so uh remember these points Revelation 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city near Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now let's go over and I'd like for you to read this with me because Matthew 6:9 let's all read it together because it's a very very fitting after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in Heaven be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been covering for a while and we don't have a lot of just a few little quotes tonight because basically what I want to do is just couple cover couple of items and then uh the Lord will in Sunday we will begin to make our descent down out of heaven and uh you know coming down to Earth in our journey cuz we've been covering now for for quite a few services that you know talking about heaven Butz I believe heaven is real I believe it's a real place it's not just the thoughts as we used to say and the prophet said you know like Mama used to think and people used to teach that you know you get up to heaven one day and you'd just be floating on clouds and and you'd just be you know playing hars and and things like that I I don't believe that I I don't believe that's the way it is I believe that it's more to a real or reality than even the reality that we're think that we're living in all right we've been covering the dimensions and the things to try to see a little more about that and you know of the the like we're in the Life Light and matter our life like time you know matter we're in existence that we think is real and solids because we can stand on it and do things but my point has been to you is to get you to realize that wherever all of this came from would have to be more real than what this is then we're we're just into the basis of of scratching the service surface as we call it on trying to to understand about heaven now we we know for a sure that that it's a real place amen and God is real that's the two points that I've tried to make to you that God is real and Heaven Is Real it is not just a a uh an atmosphere even though we have to read that in the Bible and it does speak of a certain atmospheres uh speaks of things and it calls them Heaven you know but still there has to be a heaven as we gave it there uh Sunday the scriptures where that it talks of heavens of Heavens there's many heavens and and and all like that but yet my point is if there is one Heaven here that is like a dimension that we're in well then surely we ought to be able to understand that all of this had to come from somewhere you know we say well God just spoke it into existence well that's the point I'm trying to get you to to see that we look at God as being just a an object of worship you know and think about him as being well brother Dale he might just be some kind of a glob he might just be a a a pillar of fire of something floating by you know and and all like that well why would we want to think that why would we want to make ourselves greater than him right why wouldn't we want to realize realization that he's real and that heaven is real amen God lives in heaven you say well where is Heaven it's beyond the the atmospheric ways of man or thoughts or atmospheres and things up into the eternity that's what I was bringing out about the dimensions cuz you only have seven dimensions you have the light like life and matter you know then you have the fourth dimension which is like TV and and things like that are traveling in that Dimension and then you have the Fifth Dimension which is the sinner dead you know those that have died without Christ and then you have the sixth Dimension which is the souls under the altar which is all of the Christian dead in the place that they abod and then you have the seventh Dimension which would be where Jesus went to in his when he you know was death burial resurrection and made Eternal and went up and see then nobody had to approach to immortality except the Lord Jesus Christ all right so then there has to be a place that he's there as one laying on the throne see we don't talk about heaven as having a throne but read the book of Revelation read Revelation 4 5 and all through there and and read those things and look at what it's telling you about the the the the places and all but we know that as we look at it see we we realize that that is more real than we are and that's what I'm that's my point that's the the whole thing of the of the message tonight is to try to get it to our hearts and minds and then we will start with the the creation and and you know and bringing in the angels and etc etc by way of the prophet and start our journey down toward Earth but what have we' been trying to do is to tell you of the things that are in heaven and and seeing those things that are there and seeing how real they are and why wouldn't we want to go there right well you know we just we yeah yeah that's our ideas that's what we've been taught see and then what we've been taught has put us to the basis that that we don't comprehend reality what about in we're reading here in Revelations 21 cuz you go on and read the rest of the story and and you'll read it and find out that the future home or the city comes down out of heaven and settles on a redeemed earth right well why can't we believe that but see we we're wanting to do away with everything that's just like the people of the message when when they want to you know you talk to them and they say all God was he poured into Christ I know that's a quote amen and then say all Christ was he poured into the church well see that's that's a quote that's just like reading John 3:16 it's the Bible it's a quote but yet without understanding what is it right if all God was he poured into Christ and there's no God left he said that's not what they're saying well why what's the purpose of of everybody wanting to emphasize so much on on those statements could it be that they're trying to do away with God could it be that that's Satan's idea see his idea is to come up to be God remember that's what he wants to be as God right and then he literally becomes God to the people that's what he's wanting well to do that he's got to do away with God being real He makes himself real so then that the point I've been trying to make to you like and even like Revelations 19 where that Jesus comes riding back on bu horses and we ride they come down out of heaven right see like you the prophet said you know people say but but brother brandom there ain't no horses in heaven he said well according to Revelation 19 there is you know what would be our trouble it's because of what we've been taught grandma taught me this and I'm going to stay with what grandma taught me bless God well just stay with what grandma taught you but you'll never understand the Bible as it unfolds right you'll never see the truth of the reality of what to look at right but see in doing that then we we tried to make our I say we kept ourselves up up up back before the the beginning of anything before there were any molecules or or air or anything and looking back to see heaven and I tried to get it to you there Sunday I believe Heaven is so real I I'll make it to the point what I'm saying it never had a beginning I don't believe Heaven had a beginning you said well now you read the scripture where Heaven and Earth we'll get to that just a minute but see Heaven if it has a beginning it have to have an end why would you want to think it'd have a beginning that God would exist billions of billions of billions of trillions of years before ever anything ever was brought into being and he would exist in heaven or do you think he was just walking through the remember there was no iron that's what I'm trying to get you to see it wouldn't take our if we didn't have to have these problems with lungs and things you explain to me now you explain this one little thing to me how that a baby can go 9 months in the wound of a mother floating in water with water in its lungs water and everything about it all in it just floating there it's like a fish and then it's born and when it does it starts breathing well how come you can't put the baby back into the water you had drowned it because it's changed the situation of what it was and that's way God does and things he just changes it and makes it go right on down the line and see in doing it then we've tried to keep it to there I don't believe heaven was ever created right right I believe Heaven is eternal I believe it's a place to go to this as we talk about is just basically a a gap or whatever you want to call it in the eternity that would come into being about a world and the existence of mankind and thing would just be that up on Earth it wouldn't be a you know it certainly is not more real than heaven right but see I don't believe Heaven is a dimension now I'm just getting a few things out of the way where we can go on Sunday all right I don't believe Heaven is a dimension because a dimension has a signification about it of a position or place or something to remind you know uh uh uh this room is a a a there's so many dimensions you you so wide so long so so high you know Etc that's Dimensions right and see then there's seven dimensions but Seven's not Eternal right am so then where would you get the city coming down out of the seventh Dimension it would not be eternal you're eternal life is a number eight we've got to get to that because you know it was the Holy Ghost fell on the 50th or the number eight right all the babies were circumcised 8th day because of the top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost read the future home and see what the prophet is covering about those things and you'll see that heaven then is not a dimension right it was where all these Dimensions come from yes that's right they were created brought into being for a purpose and they never will be annihilated you said but now what are you going to do with The Fifth Dimension where the sin are dead you clean it up what's wrong with it you better remember that your soul one day was as black as Su and God cleaned it up right and made it a perfect a place to be used through the new birth all right see a dimension signifies like a cube or a space or a thing that we would have but whereas eternity would signify that it goes just as much one way as it goes the other way right up or down round or whatever it would never have any stopping place to it we see we look at it we say well you know well what did they breathe well until we come into this Dimension we didn't need the a we breathing that's what I was trying to explain about the baby whatever Dimension the people were in or or Angels or whatever you want to do or God or whatever whatever was there in heaven don't need no air like we need to breathe it would change things to bring it here what about the Eternal God coming from where that there was eternity but he had to step into time and become a time being he had to start breathing and start living that's just what I'm trying to get you to look at look at something in reality instead of looking at it like Mama's idea I'm not against Mama's idea but my Lord Mama used to think hell was eternal too she scare us to death with it you better straighten up you going to burn in hell eternally you take that away from a Baptist preacher and he ain't got nothing left right cuz he'll scare you and old brother M City Fred you over hell that wey you know hold you out there and dangle you and threaten you with hell and scare the people into trying to get the kids to come to the altar that's right what it wind up doing two-fold child of hell cuz the kids wind up being smart enough to find out that they didn't believe what Daddy and mom was talking about and and it changed things I'm just trying to get us to look at eternal life as a person a being and not look at it as just a raindrops of clouds or some zap of electricity that we would receive and say oh I got the Holy Ghost that's the baby after it gets here you got to get the L first see then everything can can deal in it all right see anything that's Eternal can never have a beginning so Heaven never had a beginning and it can never have an ending to it now what we speak of Heavens in these atmospheres and things that we're in it it can come into existence and exist and be called heaven but then when it goes out of existence it doesn't do away with it that's what I want you to see go we read there in Revelation 21 see that the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away all right we read that like annihilated but your prophet got into the future home you know and picking that up and trying to show us the word of what it would would mean that it means change in form it doesn't mean annihilate that's right this world is not even annihilated it just changes in form you and I are not annihilated we just change in form we change from Mortal creatures to Immortal creatures it's not we got to throw our body down and go get us a new one that's right CU we don't believe in that we believe in this body being redeemed cuz if he's going to redeem it why is he going to kill it right you know what's he going to throw it away for but you see I gave you a couple of quotes so let's get on to this to just get them out of the way and uh you know so we'll we'll read a little bit and I didn't P these out cuz there's not enough of it to to I just gave a couple now if anybody can't read it from up here I got a couple ling up here all right so if you say I can't see it raise your hand one of the deacons will come and and I gave them to Brother Ray where he could read and sister Julie and where they could use but if you need it raise your hand one of the deacons will come up here and get these and give them to you cuz that's what we intend to do as we try to get along but now look what the prophet had to say about heaven you know Paul one day was speaking and he said that he was taken up to the third heaven taking up to the third heaven right all so now there must be three heavens right and see then doing that look what the prophet I gave you one showing you this way then we gave the future home I mean the uh the next coming up on the other uh one it'll be coming up but just to get this one which is paragraph 134 uh the true Easter SE 61 402 and look what he says now we know that the Bible speaks of three heavens we know it we know it first Heaven second heaven third heaven I believe it was Paul that was caught up into the third heaven and seen things that wasn't expedient for him to speak of then now the first Heaven is called into scripture like the clouds now that's that's Heaven is referred to just like the clouds it's up in the heavens you walk out and you look up in the sky and you see the clouds you're just talking about heaven clouds all right so I'm giving you this part to look at you like the cloud in other words down below here on the Earthly seal now when that atmosphere from up and above the clouds becomes down into the church that's a Heavenly place then the second heaven is considered the solar system and the third heaven goes beyond that so now he shows you what he's saying anything down in here then you go up into the solar system you go up into where all the stars and the moons Etc and all of that is and you can cover that is the second heaven H but you see then he goes on to the next one and I like this one because he he he went to the message Satan's Eden paragraph 167 and look what he's covering he's talking about in my father's house and all like that and the economy in the streets of gold all the gr uh where that you would talk about over Revelation 21 saw the city coming down look there was no more sea the first heaven and first Earth was passed away what was our first first Heavens was the Millennium what's the first Earth was this it'll be renovated all right now what is the first heaven or the Heaven and Earth that you know as we read in 21 that will pass away the millennial reign will come one day to the church you agree with that amen and that will be heaven ruling over Earth am so that will be called in the first heaven and when we get back to it on the earth and start coming through some of the thing it'll begin to develop a little picture in your mind that it was possible that brother brandham went to that sixth Dimension and he can call that sixth Dimension and wind up being talking about the Millennium so he may have entered the Millennium when he went beyond the curtain of time not trying to make no Doctrine out of it but just saying that he does cover a lot of things that we need to to maybe uh enter there end all right but look at the next one is off the future home I just wanted to bring this point out and it's paragraph 173 I guess he couldn't pronounce the word so he spelled it out you know and all because the word meant that the heavens and earth will pass away now this word means passing from from one form to another all right it says to another to pass from one condition to another condition all right so just don't do away with anything remember anything that God made was to be made for eternity except for one thing you know what that is hell was created for the devil and his angels and hell will have to be annihilated cuz it cannot be Eternal see we were talk that while we in organized religion right oh we're going to burn in hell eternity you better be scared you know don't you you don't want to go to that place you're going to burn eternally why you trying to scare the kids right or why you trying to scare the adults right the only way that you could burn eternally in hell is to put God's own life in there and then you'd have God living in Hell For Eternity see just simple little things that we should have thought about and should keep in our thinking but to think about see that hell was made for the devil and his angels but there's things that will change in form as we go along there's going to be a millennial Reign for a thousand years but at the end of that Millennial reign which will be Heaven ruling over Earth see then it will be changed Satan is lose for a little season and you go forth and you have go and Magog which will be a final battle to destroy all things even demons and stuff like that will be annihilated anything that's not Eternal will have to face an existence after white drone judgment and those that at the white Throne judgment it will be a decision at the white Throne whether or not to go into eternal life but the bride will be sitting on the throne with him because he's already been made Eternal here and goes up see we're just trying to get into these things to see where we're going to where are we going when we leave here well it don't matter to I know it I've been through that now just don't even get on to that garbage can with me I've been through the Baptist and you have to and all of your other Church well it don't matter about all knowing about all this stuff where we're going I just want to go there right you know what everybody says what does it matter what we know I just want to be there I just want to know about Jesus I'm not not making no lie to nobody I'm telling it like it is cuz you see I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking about eternal life right amen there can't be a false Jesus with a false word and a trinitarian concept and a good little God that loves everybody you know and all these angels floating around whether they male or female they don't care they just put them in on Christmas now you know and got all them glorious sitting down there with them and they got now they got Mary is in the upper room with the Lord Jesus they got all kind of things going CU it's man's ideas amen but I'm talking about eternal life I'm talking about something to where that we come to a place to where that we can see that there has been things happening and are still happening to where that we can see that God is real and that everything was you know real and we go back though see we've been trained we've heard the prophet say it and the preachers preach it that way it's just in his mind you remember I spent a couple of messages trying to to to help our understanding along that line that God's thoughts are Eternal that he can never have a new thought he can't thank of something one day and think of something better the next day am he wouldn't be God see and we we we think we know all about the the the things and we just wind up being quoters instead of possessors of what we're talking about all right I've always told you Judas is car it was in God's mind yeah right but I don't want to be there that way right right so I con the phrase about probably 30 years ago and been trying my best to get you to to hang on to the phrase that I don't want to be in God's mind I want to be a part of God's mind I want the mind of Christ inside of me cuz that's what the Bible said it would make me a new Creature if I had it inside of me I want eternal life I don't want just a thought about something or a raindrop or or anything that you say that's my new birth no that would have to be the after effects get the new birth all right so if you say well it's just in the mind of God brother brand said 49 Church age book I didn't bring this one he said it's not like somebody with a blueprint draw out that will one day be made substance you know brother Gary he'll go down and look at a place somebody wants to build him a house and he'll go out and he'll he'll get a man to draw him out of blueprint well the man can walk up and he said here's your house the guy said I'd like to see it about 3 months later if you don't mind no here's your house pay me you agreed to pay me when I give you the house there your house we know better than that now don't we that wouldn't quite work the man was paying him to build him a house all right something to bring into reality right but that's from a blueprint print that somebody's drawn right God never had a blueprint he is the blueprint he doesn't need a blueprint we're over here in Banks County a poor truction of the world and and you can't go over there and get a book to tell you how to build a house because the inspector will tell you and if he don't like the way you do it he'll tell you he don't like that you'll build it according to his standards and see you can't say back in Hall County you can go up to Hall County and you get the big old thick book it lays down tells you everything you don't have to worry long as you build it according to the book it's all right but Banks County don't have it well see God don't have no standard he knows what he wants he's not trying to make it take place as far as he's concerned it's already taken place right that's what I want to get on for just a few minutes tonight that we we covered this but I just want to get on to a point according to Revelations 13:8 it said all who names were not written in the loue Book of Life from the foundation of world will be deceived right now what is that name we've covered it but what is that name I just want to tie it together with a Redemption just just talk to you a little tonight about this and then we'll try to get this out of the way and get down to earth so we're trying to tie it together with Redemption so what about what was written in the book of life you know that in the bible really there's nothing but names well what do you mean I here's this we read about this we that's telling you what took place around when that name was here it's really a book of names it wasn't a scoffield or a Thompson Chain or or whatever ever that fell in the garden it was a book of names when Adam and Eve couldn't bring it forth the book had to go back to the hand of the one that sit on the throne you find it in Revelations 4 and 5 right it's a book of names why because it's there's two sections of it we'll cover it when we get down to earth and start on it there's a section of it that's called The Book of Life and all names will be written in there but then there's a section called The lon's Book of Life that only the bride will be listed in the Lamb's Book of Life but what about that name all right let's read a few of them and then we'll just read these three right here is all we use tonight so let's read number four which is hear ye him 1956 92930 1956 paragraph 12 look what he says so God before the foundation of the world knew that we would be here he knew you by name before the foundation of the world think of it and many times we sing the song new name written down in glory tonight it was an ERA that's right it was written down before there was ever a human on the earth what your name was written down before there was ever human being on Earth your names are written in the Lou book of life amen think of it the Bible said that Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world taking 4,000 years for that to materialize 4,000 years later he was actually slain but when God spoke the word in the beginning he was slain right then because word God's word Can't Fail You See amen there's not a new name they got the song you know there's a new name written down in glory and it's mine it's mine it sounds good and beautiful but it's not scripture there's no such thing as writing down there it was written before the foundation of world or will never be written see we want to argue that point there well well you know that's all right it's a good song all right it's a good song what good is a good song right if there ain't some words on there that don't sound good and tell you something there's a lot of good songs out there that sounds beautiful but then you analyze the words go get your Beatles and sing some of them and and think about Jesus Christ and Mary and there what they're singing took place all never listen to them just read cuz never did care nothing about none of it but look at the next one paragraph 70 of the serpent seed 1958 9:28 the evening service he said the man talking about who wrote the song There was a new name written down in glory tonight in its mind his idea was all right but he was wrong scripturally your name wasn't put on the on the night you got saved your name according to the B according to the Bible according to Revelations 3 137 1317 I think it really go at 138 but and so forth was put on there before the world ever begun and Jesus Christ was slain before the foundation of the world now Jesus Christ was slain you said that's only in the mind of God as far as God is concerned it was over with right yep am right amen amen far as God is concerned where was our names written now let's see what kind of a name it was page 211 pergam Church age which would be the church age book 211 and don't worry about it I know about the Overcomer and all of the names of the The Messengers and the Overcomers and I know that too but here's this one listen to it he is going to give the Overcomer a white stone an end not own the stone a new name which the owner Al knows now the idea of a new name is a familiar one Abraham was Abram was chained to Abraham Sarah to sah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter Saul to Paul these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change it was only after Abram and Sarah had their names Changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son in Jacob's case he had to overcome and then he was called a prince in the case of Simon and Saul when they had received the Lord their their change came and today each one of us true Christian Believers have had a change in name we've already had a change in name what is it he tells you we're Christians right read we're Christians that's our new name Christians what do you mean we going to call everybody Christians well why not I thought that's what we are but look at it and today each one of us True Believers that had a change in name we're Christians it is a name common to all of us but one day we will have another change it will be of a certainty it change we will of a certainty receive a new name it could well be that name that was our true and original name written in the lounge Book of Life from the foundation of the world that's why my name is not Samuel in the Bible right my name is not Samuel but what name is written in the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life you're new name the name that was in the original right of when when god named his children see you're still not clicking with what I'm talking about at there was a day God named you right right you said well you're saying we was back there I done told you over and over and I do every service we wasn't back there as people we wouldn't back there as Souls we wouldn't back there as identities we were in Christ the Bible we read and how many services do we preach there from Ephesians were that we're chosen in Jesus Christ and what is that name that was when you received your name right what is that name there's some other quotes that goes along with it where the Prophet would get down to to talking about that there will be a group of people that will receive a new name and Jesus will receive a new name to he be revealed in the Thunders and things but what am I trying to get to you there was a time your name was called in heaven right John may I quote the prophet John saw his name written in heaven now did he see John you know what I'm saying R didd see his original name which one is it my name Samuel has to do with my Earthly Journey sure natures and ways Etc go with your name well if you can see that I'm glad you thought of it if you can see that nature and ways goes with your name why can't you see that in God when he named his attributes or his offspring or his children but they would also have n ways and Natures right amen why can't we see that why can't we see that there's something real about that name that you don't even know yet the prophet said to be made known when we get dire H not worried about it you know everybody in the message I remember this one brother he got on up in age and he divorced his wife and a bunch of garbage but he got him a new wife and you know what she found out his new name and she told him his new name well you know what that is contrary to the scripture cu the scripture says only you know the name read it the Book of Revelation that no man knows himself you know in other words nobody else knows it you only know it yourself so how could you get my new name and come tell me said brother Dale I I found it out your name is not Samuel your name is is Joe he's not here tonight trying to get him well what good would that help me cuz I know you're wrong it would be only revealed to me all right look at what I'm talking about you are real in heaven because we're talking about eternal life if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life was the life of God or is the life of God you agree all right and that was in God in the beginning right when he had all his attributes he was a father a Healer a savior Etc there was just nothing displayed on Earth to cover those things yet yet it was already there in him I was trying to get it across to a couple of services why can't we see the eternal life that he has given us was in glory then I can say that I walked the shores of Galilee in Jesus Christ am you know but you know I can say I was with Abraham I can say I was with David when he killed Goliath why right because of my connection back in that eternal life that's what I'm trying to get you to see your name written in the lounge book of life section the Eternal section will be the name that you should have had had it not been a fall okay you go along with me we should have come without a fall right you agree but God had attributes so there was no way it could be any other thing do allow it to take place he permitted it to happen to way it's happened to display those attributes but you and I had to be there in the beginning in Jesus Christ now watch that Sunday when we go back because I still hold the point you talk about people saying they come into the world with eternal life that come here that always was eternal I fought that from the beginning because we must receive eternal life we must receive the new birth to have the eternal life then the eternal life always was eternal cuz how many times have I made this statement be careful you'll redeem yourself out of existence you realize that he will never God will never go back to be self-existent he'll never go back to be self-existent amen why cuz he brought us into being we were there not as people's identities and little lines and him but what don't you look at it sometimes and draw it out and make it the body of Christ and just look at the body of Christ and see if that ain't the Bride of Jesus Christ why don't you look at the seven Church ages and just see that it was God in each one of these ages living in this true rde right God himself so like I said the other day where the Prophet said what age would you like to live brother R said I'd like to live in this life age but you know some of them maybe didn't get a choice about where they wanted to live but you know what God put them to that age in that time not their natural nature don't get that involved that's all that's part of it sure brother around had a natural nature of Elijah A wilderness man but that was not his the nature that God was talking about it's the nature of the Prophet that was his natural nature that you look out here and see that made him wanted to hunt and fish and stuff but you see ever born again believer then being a part of God we wouldn't all be the same way in things but if you see what I'm talking about and can see that that pull ourselves back there but just don't go too far and stop right there where we will get up Sunday to of where that it's the the the Lo logos the word the theophany the the pillar of fire the the Son of God that comes out to begin to create if we wasn't in that in God we never will be there cuz that was eternal life that was God's full nature that stepped out there to begin to create and I was part of that you that have eternal life was part of that nature that walked his shores of Galilee without you and I he doesn't have his nature but you see then you can be redeemed what does the word redeem mean it means to go back where you came from right you're in the pawn shop you're redeemed out of the pawn shop you go back where you come from see now we can go back and see that if we have eternal life we was in him in heaven amen and we can be redeemed to that point but we won't go back that far because he don't want us to go that far come on we're trying to get something God don't want us to go back that far that's right he don't want us to go towards self-existing that's right he wants us to be what we are here on Earth he wants us to be the part of him here on Earth to speak to people and do things amen he wants us to be his children his offspring and he'll never go back to self-existing he'll always be known as Jehovah which would be signifying a father with his family cuz he said over there in the Old Testament he said by my name Jehovah was you never was I never known that never did know that name Jehovah because they couldn't pronounce it cuz it was jvh and there was no way to pronounce it they put vowels in it you know the AEI O's and the U's guys in it you know and and they come up with Jehovah but that wasn't away his name is Jesus The Only Name God ever had was Jesus I like one old brother U what was his name Theo arasmus years ago right it up and he just take he take the the US off of Jesus and said what you got his name would be Jess I Glory shouted because that's the truth you take away the Bride of Jesus Christ away from the plan of God's salvation and he has not got a Plan of Salvation he only got a this creation and a bringing forth and this happens and that happens and judge it and kill it and destroy it no it's not see we can be redeemed but how far do you want to be redeemed do you want to go out of existence no I want to go back to see my real part I want to be redeemed in my real part and you know what those who make the change is going to come to that part before we leave out of here cuz that's what's going to make the change you know what it's not a running out of time cuz God don't have any it's not a running out of Revelation because it never will exhaust that it's a real reality of a people to realize who they are We Are The Offspring of God we are his children we're the Sons and Daughters of a living God by the new birth our name has a lot to do with us your name naturally has a not lot to do with you that's you know that's that's why brother around said For Heaven's Sake don't call you kids Ricky he said don't do it he said change it for the gospel all right because now if he hears that on tape he he talk to me about it we'll try to find out something about it call him Richard orever what his name is cuz it ain't going to help him to change his natural name I'm wanting his heart changed when the heart changes Ricky goes right right right sure it still has a human bearing upon us the time you're born under the sign you're born under the time of the month you're born under your parents and their nature and and brother randam did you know that he even said that where you're born again at will determine whether you're emotional or not emotional all of that's involved but that's just the outside let's get on down in here where we live at I want I want to be redeemed to the part that I'm supposed to make manifest upon this Earth that's right that's righten because that will be the display of my father that's right that's why you've heard me say that brother ROM says see gifts and callings are without repentance the Bible say gifts are predestinated eternally now listen he's so specific if you want me to bring it I'll show you he said not to not the nine spiritual gifts the nine spiritual gifts is not counted in that but see the prophets were counted in and the for Ministry is counted a gift that's why it says he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists I've tried to explain that to you my wife see in it he gives you what you out need of right some Churches they can't handle a p a teacher Ministry they would break up the church and lose all of them well God Honors that now what the preacher does with it that's his business I don't have nothing to do with it I just tell it like it is and leave it alone but you see he gave some prophets because that's what to add me God gave the church gifts according to Ephesians there and Galatians and gifts but not the just the nine spiritual gifts that can work but the real true gift the real true Ministry is a gift unto a church that's why you pull off the gift and don't look at to the guy that's doing the part that's working it cuz you're going to get confused every time now that don't justify us to go out and live like the devil ain't talking garbage C I'm talking about that we are human mortal people brother Dale is a human mortal and is subject to things of this Mortal life subject to frustrations and and heartaches and trouble just as much as anybody but I wish I could explain that gift I've tried to I've tried to explain a gift that God gave me that can't do it see he's never failed me yet I've never come to this pull pit without a message that's 40 something years I've come to this building without you know a good clearcut where your way it's going right but he's never failed the gift that's right it don't matter how sick I am or what's going on or what I can stop just a moment and that gift will be there but that don't make anything for you folks other than one thing you honor the gift God will honor you he will speak to your heart if you honor the gift any of these ministers you honor the gift I honor those gifts I do not there's no way will I say anything against a gift because the gift can be there and and the one that's using it can be all messed up but don't you worry about it if it's a true gift he'll straighten him out that's why I say I'm responsible to God to what I say and do and talk to you about and I try not to even some sometimes tell you something why because I don't want you built on just Samuel Dale and some point you know that there's a gift there's an operation or this that and the other any five-fold Ministry that there is with a gift of God can do the same thing I do and that's sit down in your study and say God give me what you want the people to hear come on the scene and speak to my heart then I'll go speak to them cuz see gifts and callings are without repentance I never repented to get one but listen it don't mean I'm saved either just because a gift can work I don't mind saying that that's right see that's where people think that it's not they say well well I'm a I'm a minister so it doesn't matter yes it does don't think because you're a preacher that you can get by of anything that's right you're going to answer more than anybody else right right you can take my word for it you'll answer more than anybody but you see that's why I never worry about you know being sick or anything I just say Lord I didn't call myself to preach you mean you talk to him like that yes sir Lord I didn't call myself to preach you call me whether I'm right or not just use it never seen him fail see if we just be that way as Christians and find out we're the children of God those gifts and things was ordained before the foundation of the world I see brother Richard quotes one I haven't looked it up but I know he quotes it there something like yeah will brandom said ordained you to preach the gospel before the foundation of the world we know that's true cuz that's what he said to all the prophets true Jeremiah knew you and ordained you a prophet while he was in your mother's W did that save Jeremiah no no don't ever get that idea that preaching saves you that's right I can quote too much and brother R he said I'm saved if I never preach another sermon but he said who would want to stop from preaching to tell him about Jesus right brother up in call brother that I knew years ago backley had I talked to him a few years later and he said Brother D why is it that I still get sermons he said I know backlit but he said I still get sermons just like I did when I was preaching I said yeah because gifts and callings are without repentance brother the gift is there but Heaven help you to use it brother Brown said his gift was there so much until some people wanted to know where Oil was one time you remember that and he said they had a selfish motive even though they said we'll put all of the money into the work you know he knew they didn't mean that he said I knew where the oil was at and said it wouldn't tell them he said they tried and tried and couldn't find it he said one man come in from somewhere else and sat down hit a gusher and found the the oil that gift to work brother Mo used to tell about the Russian monk you may have heard of him that the people that they had their their child had some kind of disease in this old Russian monk they would get in touch with him well he could be as drunk as a coot on the D Floor and women's arms all kind of good they got in touch with him he would stop the whole thing get right down on the floor and pray and God would heal that boy because it's what they believed but do you see what I'm talking about and as we end this part we found a lot of things are up in heaven you know that's where all the things that we have need of is coming from I thought we believe that the word came to the prophet but where did it come from it come from Heaven Come From The Throne what did the prophet cover on adoption Angels ascending are descending and ascending you know going up and down amen see those angels coming down and taking your prayers and carry them up to God L amen God stops in heaven and says go to Earth and take care of it amen you said well why don't we see more than what what we see brother Dale because we don't believe we believe the word right but we don't honor it to the basis of putting our entire life upon that nothing wrong with going to doctors nothing wrong with being anything like that you can go to doctor and have every bit of your confidence right in the directly in God that serve that you serve Ser because that don't prove nothing but you see one of these days we'll understand what the Bible said that heaven and earth kissed in Jesus Christ allmighty God came to this earth he came from Heaven that's why I wanted us to read that prayer you know what brother random would do some of you're grinning you know exactly what he would pray and a demon wouldn't leave people person would still be sick he said we're going to pray one more prayer and he's going and he'd stop and he'd say the Lord's prayer Our Father which are in heaven that's right ever Redemptive name of Jehovah is in the Lord's Prayer amen right amen amen everything we have need of just think on these things we can be redeemed folks that's right that's right but we don't want to be redeemed out of existence so if we never had a fall we never had a problem and everything you you would be going back to where you came from and that would make you go back to the self-existing but when our journey on Earth took place and has taken place and is now taking place we have somewhere to go but it's not up into heaven we'll be able to go there one day because we want to because heaven and Earth is going to kiss again and the Bride of Jesus Christ will stand upon the Earth in God's word whether we believe it or not somebody's going to do it why can't we believe we're part of it come on stand together why can't we believe that we're part of it why can't we say that we're the redeem the Bible said let the redeem say so why can't we believe it why can't we stand up on God's word and say by stri I'm heal whatever we have Happ what we got 288 in red book 288 288 in the red book trome times are here filling his hearts with fear freeding oh de now heart to God the Ching seek away Jesus is Calling soon in the where no one that when signs

closer than it was yesterday what about 40 years ago or something like that what about when some of you started your Christian journey and we got to realize that things is closer the world around us is testifying of it it's falling apart and everything but see it'll only be for the Royal seat of Abraham only the redeemable will be redeemed right the rest can't do it cuz the prophet I had it in some notes there the prophet said they have they don't have anywhere to go to right that's why they go to hell as we call it sh sh goana Hades which is not it's just a place of aode it's not a burning
