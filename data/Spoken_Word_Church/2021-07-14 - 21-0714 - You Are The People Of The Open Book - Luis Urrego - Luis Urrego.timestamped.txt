[11:04] christ that we pray amen
[11:06] amen praise the lord nehemiah chapter 8
[11:10] and all the people gathered themselves
[11:12] verse 1 and all the people gathered
[11:14] themselves together as one man
[11:16] into the street that was before the
[11:18] watergate
[11:19] and they spake unto ezra the scribe to
[11:21] bring the book of the law of moses
[11:23] which the lord had commanded to israel
[11:26] now to go
[11:27] just to go back just for a moment this
[11:30] was
[11:31] israel when they came back to the land
[11:33] of the promised land or to
[11:35] to israel to jerusalem after they had
[11:38] been in captivity
[11:39] uh in babylon for a long time and so
[11:43] being in captivity for such a long time
[11:46] they
[11:46] forgot their customs that a lot of the
[11:49] customs
[11:50] and the law that moses had given them uh
[11:53] they
[11:53] had not even opened the the the the
[11:56] bible
[11:58] really pretty much is how you boil it
[12:00] down and they forgot
[12:02] the customs so when this book was
[12:04] restored back to them the law of moses
[12:06] was
[12:07] restored back to them i want you to see
[12:09] and i want you to notice how the people
[12:12] how they reacted to it and how and how
[12:15] important it was to them
[12:16] and so it says here in verse 1 and they
[12:18] spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the
[12:20] book of the law of moses
[12:22] which the lord had commanded to israel
[12:25] and ezra the priests brought the law
[12:27] before the congregation both of men and
[12:30] women and
[12:31] all that could hear with understanding
[12:33] upon the first day
[12:35] of the seventh month what it what what a
[12:37] number
[12:38] the key number there and he read therein
[12:41] before the street that was before the
[12:44] watergate
[12:44] from the morning until midday
[12:48] my he just read the he just read the
[12:50] bible for several hours
[12:52] before the man and the women and those
[12:55] that could
[12:56] understand and the ears of all the
[12:58] people were attentive
[12:59] unto the book of the law my
[13:03] and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit
[13:06] of wood
[13:07] which they had made for the purpose and
[13:10] beside him stood ma
[13:11] matathaya and shema and ananiah anaya
[13:14] and nurija
[13:15] and hilkiah and masaya on his right hand
[13:19] and on his left hand
[13:20] padaya and mishael and malkaya and
[13:23] hashem
[13:24] and badana and zechariah and muslim
[13:28] and ezra verse 5 and ezra opened the
[13:32] book
[13:32] in the sight of all the people all right
[13:35] for
[13:36] he was above all the people in other
[13:39] words it was
[13:39] not just his position but but also where
[13:42] he was standing at the same at
[13:44] he was higher than them at the moment
[13:46] they were looking to him for leadership
[13:48] and when he opened it all the people
[13:50] stood up
[13:52] and ezra blessed the lord the great god
[13:55] and all the people answered amen
[13:58] amen with lifting up their hands and
[14:01] they bowed their heads
[14:03] and worshiped the lord with their faces
[14:06] to the ground
[14:06] amen may the lord add a blessing to the
[14:08] reading of the word you may be seated
[14:10] amen i wanted to start with this
[14:14] scripture because
[14:17] it gives us an example of when the book
[14:19] of the word of god was opened
[14:21] amen and how and how it was such a a
[14:24] a time of rejoicing for the people
[14:28] i don't know about you but uh some of us
[14:30] haven't experienced it but
[14:33] maybe you've you don't know what it is
[14:34] like to be out in the world and we know
[14:36] that babylon
[14:37] babylon represents the world you know
[14:40] and i've been there you know you go out
[14:43] and you get
[14:44] away from the things of god for a while
[14:46] and you realize that you're like a
[14:48] misfit out in the world you don't belong
[14:50] in there
[14:50] because the word of god has you've
[14:52] opened that book at some point in time
[14:55] or that book has been opened to you at
[14:56] some point in time uh uh i i know
[14:59] brother wade can attest to this and then
[15:00] you realize that
[15:02] even though you're out there in the
[15:03] world even though you're partaking of
[15:05] the things of the world you don't real
[15:06] you really don't belong you feel like
[15:08] you don't belong with there
[15:10] with them you just can't really get into
[15:12] what they do
[15:13] because you know better right and and i
[15:15] say this to all of us
[15:17] young people you think right now that
[15:19] you're okay
[15:20] everything's fine and and you're going
[15:22] to where you're going and and and
[15:24] and that's that's fine but if god gets a
[15:27] hold of you
[15:28] you will never be the same amount you
[15:30] will never be the same you realize
[15:32] you will realize i don't belong in this
[15:36] this is not where i'm supposed to go
[15:38] because you know better
[15:40] yeah i was that way amen and when and
[15:43] and you feel like you're out there with
[15:44] your drinking buddies you're out there
[15:45] doing these things of the world and then
[15:48] and then you feel like my goodness what
[15:50] am i doing
[15:51] you know they're cursing like a sailor
[15:53] they're doing all these things listening
[15:54] to the worldly music the hip-hop the rap
[15:56] and all that kind of stuff
[15:58] and you think that you're one of them
[15:59] but something is telling you're not
[16:01] really one of them
[16:03] you think that you are but you really
[16:04] are not god will make that known to you
[16:07] amen
[16:08] amen praise god because let me tell you
[16:11] if your
[16:11] true child son and daughter of god god
[16:14] won't leave you alone
[16:16] i'm thankful that he doesn't yes
[16:19] i'm thankful god will not leave your
[16:22] goal you will come back to the place
[16:24] where you are manifesting him
[16:26] instead of manifesting the things of the
[16:27] world amen
[16:29] god will make sure that you that you
[16:31] will manifest him amen
[16:33] i don't know who needed that but
[16:34] somebody did and it didn't cost you one
[16:36] ten one cent praise god amen
[16:39] so we are the people of the open book
[16:41] amen praise the lord jesus now
[16:44] as the people of the open book you know
[16:46] as i was saying you know there's people
[16:47] out here the nominal world
[16:49] they read the bible the same bible that
[16:51] you and i do
[16:53] yet it's not open to them i've had them
[16:56] tell me
[16:57] well you know when you try to explain to
[16:59] them water baptism in the name of lord
[17:00] jesus christ
[17:01] and you give them matthew 28 but then
[17:04] you also give them acts 2 38
[17:06] and and you and you try to bring it to
[17:08] the together to them
[17:09] and there's something that they say well
[17:11] i'd rather take the words of jesus
[17:13] yeah instead of what peter said like
[17:16] it's two different types of words
[17:19] and isn't that what they're kind of
[17:20] saying today even the people that have
[17:22] left this word this message
[17:23] oh i'd rather just take the bible i'd
[17:26] rather take instead of the
[17:27] instead of the prophet and that's
[17:29] actually worse
[17:30] yeah amen they have seen what the
[17:33] prophet has said
[17:35] for them to come and say i'll just take
[17:37] the bible they have not
[17:39] what what has happened is is they have
[17:42] seen the word open
[17:43] and they have rejected that open word
[17:45] right that's right
[17:48] and they say we got the we got i'll just
[17:50] take the bible i'll just take christ
[17:53] but you see christ has to be revealed it
[17:56] ain't just the letter of the bible it
[17:58] has to be a
[17:59] living word amen a living word and you
[18:02] and i
[18:02] praise god and it was i i i don't know
[18:05] of of any other man amen in this our day
[18:08] where that word was vindicated more than
[18:10] our prophet brother branham amen
[18:12] god vindicated this message amen in
[18:15] many different ways and they just they
[18:18] fall flat on
[18:19] on on a vision the brown bear vision the
[18:22] bridge
[18:22] all these different things with and none
[18:25] of those things bring me salvation
[18:28] none of them the opening of the word
[18:32] brings me salvation
[18:34] the seven seals brings me salvation and
[18:37] brother branham was they cannot dispute
[18:39] that though
[18:40] they won't come back against that but
[18:42] they'll talk about brown veg
[18:43] brown bear they'll talk about a bridge
[18:46] and all this than that
[18:47] and that won't ever give anybody the
[18:49] holy ghost
[18:51] amen praise god amen amen so
[18:54] we know that the word of god from
[18:55] genesis to revelation saints we know
[18:57] that the central theme and brother wade
[18:59] and brother dale they've covered these
[19:00] things but we're just going to go back
[19:02] through and we know that the central
[19:03] theme of the word of god
[19:04] is redemption amen praise god and we see
[19:07] redemption even in the in in
[19:10] in in women in the bible such as rahab
[19:12] ruth
[19:13] esther amen those are all
[19:16] representations of redemption
[19:18] praise god and you know that that it's
[19:20] interesting that they were all women
[19:23] amen they were all women and and
[19:26] and who redeemed them right it was their
[19:28] husbands
[19:29] that redeemed them right amen you know
[19:32] the story of rahav
[19:34] and she married with the captain of
[19:36] israel that was a marriage that was a
[19:38] a marriage that took place it was her
[19:40] husband that redeemed her same thing
[19:42] with ruth even though she was a
[19:44] moabitess she was a gentile she came
[19:47] and she could only be redeemed amen
[19:50] by the near kinsmen and the one that was
[19:53] the most nearest to her which was uh
[19:56] uh um i forgot his name but um
[20:00] um no bo boaz but there was a no
[20:04] another one that was nearer to her i
[20:05] don't think the bible says the name
[20:07] so but we know that he represents the
[20:09] devil
[20:10] he was our near kinsmen but he couldn't
[20:13] redeem us
[20:15] and so boaz stepped in and he said well
[20:16] i'll do it amen praise god
[20:19] amen and we see the same thing with
[20:20] esther amen she was married to
[20:23] uh the king and uh she was
[20:26] she she was a representation of
[20:28] redemption praise god
[20:29] amen and when you look at and you go
[20:31] back home and you read the book of ruth
[20:33] amen you look at
[20:34] uh for example at chapter 2 of of of
[20:37] ruth
[20:38] you see how boaz he reveals to her her
[20:41] life
[20:42] amen and they're in chapter two he he
[20:44] starts talking to her about her about
[20:46] where she come from i believe brother
[20:48] wade was mentioning this sunday
[20:50] how how he i i have heard of the things
[20:52] that you've done where you came from
[20:54] and all these things and wasn't that the
[20:56] same thing that took place
[20:58] at the the woman at the whale man amen
[21:01] the woman at the well that came to jesus
[21:03] jesus was talking to her revealing to
[21:05] her her life
[21:06] amen revealing to her who she was but
[21:09] you know what as much
[21:10] as as as boaz was revealing to
[21:14] to uh to ruth her life
[21:17] and as much as as jesus was revealing to
[21:21] the woman at the will of her life that
[21:22] did not bring redemption to their life
[21:26] see because ruth still had to go through
[21:28] a process
[21:30] amen and we see that process amen
[21:32] unveils itself amen as you read continue
[21:35] reading through the book of ruth amen
[21:38] and uh uh in the in the later chapters
[21:41] and we'll touch on it here in just a
[21:42] moment
[21:43] but i want you i want us to look at here
[21:45] for just a moment here in in luke
[21:47] chapter four
[21:48] uh in luke chapter four the brothers
[21:50] could bring it up
[21:52] uh speaking about this open book
[21:55] and how brother wade was kind of
[21:58] bringing this this th
[21:59] this past sunday amen but jesus
[22:02] amen he's here in the synagogue and the
[22:04] bible says in verse 16 and it says and
[22:06] he came to nazareth
[22:08] where he had been brought up and as his
[22:10] custom was he went into the synagogue
[22:12] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[22:15] read
[22:16] and there was delivered unto him the
[22:17] book of the prophet isaiah isaiah's
[22:20] and when he had opened the book he found
[22:22] the place where it was written
[22:24] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[22:26] because he had anointed me to preach the
[22:28] gospel to the poor
[22:29] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[22:31] to preach deliverance to the captives
[22:33] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[22:35] set at liberty them that are bruised
[22:38] to preach the acceptable year of the
[22:41] lord amen
[22:42] and he stops there amen
[22:46] he stops there now i just want to throw
[22:49] this in here for just a moment
[22:51] just to kind of uh uh uh to kind of i
[22:53] guess back up what brother wade was
[22:55] saying
[22:56] on sunday uh but uh you know
[22:59] brother branham calls that the the the
[23:02] greatest anointing that ever existed
[23:04] was right there in that scripture right
[23:07] there and they're in there
[23:08] in luke and brother and brother branham
[23:10] says here in the message why are
[23:12] people so tossed about he says some
[23:15] people gets the wrong impression of what
[23:17] the anointing
[23:18] is did you ever think of that when when
[23:21] was the greatest anointing
[23:24] ever give to anyone and what did they do
[23:27] when they had the anointing
[23:29] the greatest anointing that was ever
[23:31] given to
[23:32] anyone was jesus christ now he is the
[23:35] holy ghost he is the spirit amen so he
[23:37] is the greatest anointing
[23:39] we have the spirit by measure he says he
[23:42] had it without measure
[23:44] and one day he entered into the temple
[23:46] and picked up the scroll and read
[23:48] said the spirit of god is upon me for he
[23:50] has anointed me to preach the acceptable
[23:52] year
[23:53] to bind up the broken hearts to heal the
[23:55] sick give sight to the blind
[23:58] and now we would think if such anointing
[24:00] was on him
[24:01] had been prophesied 800 years before
[24:03] that it would come and here
[24:05] he was with that type of anointing the
[24:08] full blessing and anointing of the lord
[24:10] upon him
[24:10] we would have want to run all over the
[24:12] building scream and holler
[24:15] amen all right so we know that that
[24:18] wasn't the case with jesus amen
[24:21] right jesus wasn't running and and and
[24:24] and screaming and hollering and all that
[24:25] none of that is bad
[24:27] i want you to understand that there's
[24:28] nothing wrong with that amen right
[24:31] there is a balance amen and also it
[24:33] depends on
[24:34] our makeup as well some of us are not
[24:37] that way
[24:38] yeah some of us are amen and so
[24:41] we express and we worship god in
[24:43] whatever way god made us amen
[24:46] amen but have something to shout about
[24:50] amen all right have something to to to
[24:53] to
[24:53] run about have something to jump about
[24:57] amen don't just make it just just i i
[25:00] feel good
[25:01] and that's it and there's no word behind
[25:03] it you make sure that the word is
[25:05] backing up your shouting
[25:06] you make sure that the word is backing
[25:08] up you're you're running
[25:10] you make sure that the word is backing
[25:11] up any any externals
[25:14] amen praise god amen amen
[25:17] so but brother branham continues and
[25:19] says here but the bible said he laid
[25:21] down the scroll
[25:22] and sat down and precious words
[25:24] proceeded from his mouth
[25:27] all right that's when jesus closed the
[25:30] book and he started explaining what that
[25:32] what that what the scripture was about
[25:35] that's what he done under the anointing
[25:38] the anointing is not emotion now brother
[25:42] brown did not say that the emotion was
[25:44] bad
[25:45] he just said that it wasn't the emotion
[25:48] you can't say that
[25:49] anointing is just emotion amen because
[25:52] brother
[25:53] brother uh jesus christ amen was the
[25:56] greatest and
[25:57] he was the greatest anointed at that
[25:58] moment when he opened back that's that
[26:00] book
[26:01] you see that's right all right he done
[26:04] the
[26:04] he says that's what he done under the
[26:06] anointed the anointing
[26:07] is not in motion watch what the
[26:09] anointing is the anointing is supreme
[26:12] power in control
[26:15] all right what is the anointing the
[26:17] anointing is supreme
[26:18] power in control
[26:21] amen amen amen knowing how to control
[26:25] amen at the moment amen
[26:29] how to dividely write rightly divide the
[26:32] word
[26:32] exactly when it needs to be done amen
[26:34] right amen
[26:36] not not not speaking just because you
[26:38] feel like it
[26:39] that's right because sometimes we do
[26:42] that
[26:43] yeah we just just i feel like saying it
[26:46] and then you do so much damage by doing
[26:48] that
[26:50] you may or may not but we have to that's
[26:53] supreme power
[26:54] under control now i believe that when
[26:57] you and i receive the holy ghost we
[26:58] receive supreme power
[27:00] amen but we also got to make sure that
[27:03] that supreme power is controlling us
[27:05] from the inside out
[27:07] amen praise god the anointing is not in
[27:10] motion the anointing is supreme power
[27:12] in control knowing exactly what and how
[27:15] amen amen praise god that that's a
[27:19] powerful quote
[27:20] amen praise god knowing exactly what and
[27:23] how now
[27:26] saints you may go through several months
[27:28] and you may not even
[27:30] feel or even cry one time
[27:33] that does not mean that you have the
[27:36] right to doubt what god has done in your
[27:38] life
[27:39] if god has really done a work in your
[27:41] heart in your life
[27:42] you know that god is changing you from
[27:44] day to day
[27:46] whether you jumped whether you shouted
[27:48] whether you screamed whether you sang
[27:49] really loud
[27:50] whatever it doesn't matter if you did
[27:52] that or not
[27:54] god is still on the scene amen amen
[27:57] you've got to realize because satan will
[27:59] try to make us think well i didn't
[28:01] run and i didn't shout i haven't done
[28:03] that and i haven't even cried
[28:04] well i pray in several months it must
[28:06] mean god is not with me
[28:08] amen god is just might be trying to test
[28:11] you trying to
[28:12] and see what you're what you're going to
[28:13] do about it are you going to hold that
[28:15] holy ghost that's in you
[28:17] in supreme control amen because
[28:20] really it's the holy ghost that holds
[28:21] you amen
[28:23] praise god the anointing is supreme
[28:26] power in control
[28:27] amen amen you go back and you read that
[28:30] go back home and read that
[28:31] again amen amen now continuing here and
[28:35] reading in luke chapter 4
[28:36] and and verse 20 and it says and and he
[28:38] closed the book
[28:40] and he gave it again to the minister
[28:42] jesus
[28:44] gave it the book again to the minister
[28:46] and sat down
[28:47] and the eyes of all them that were in
[28:49] the synagogue were fastened on him
[28:52] and he began to say unto them this day
[28:54] this scripture
[28:55] is fulfilled in your ears now jesus knew
[28:59] exactly what he was talking about
[29:00] for one he was the one who wrote the
[29:02] word he was the one who wrote that
[29:04] portion in isaiah
[29:06] actually gave it to isaiah to speak it
[29:08] right right
[29:09] but now i want you to understand that
[29:12] jesus did not complete all of his work
[29:15] while here on earth that's right
[29:17] amen and we may have heard all these
[29:19] things but he didn't complete all these
[29:21] things
[29:22] that's the reason why there was another
[29:24] portion there in isaiah that he could
[29:26] have continued if he would have read
[29:27] if he would have continued reading he
[29:29] would have read another portion but
[29:30] it wasn't his time to fulfill that part
[29:34] he only read the part that he was to
[29:36] fulfill at that moment when he was
[29:38] fulfilling praise god
[29:40] and so god a man he is he is he is
[29:44] a a god who is ever present amen
[29:47] he is here to fulfill his word amen but
[29:50] he will not do it
[29:51] amen faster than what he needs to or all
[29:54] slower than what he needs to amen it's
[29:56] exactly when it needs to be done amen
[29:59] no no no no no further no
[30:02] no no less amen praise god
[30:05] now brother branham was the one that
[30:06] says this he says in if you read in the
[30:09] pergament church he says
[30:10] those in the bride do only his will no
[30:13] one can make them do otherwise
[30:15] they have thus said the lord or they
[30:17] keep still that's right
[30:18] they know that it has to be god in them
[30:20] doing the works fulfilling
[30:22] his own word he says he did not complete
[30:25] all his work while in his earthly
[30:26] ministry
[30:28] so what so now he works in
[30:31] and through the bride
[30:34] satan hates that amen but the bride
[30:38] loves that
[30:40] satan hates that she knows that for it
[30:44] was not yet
[30:44] time for him to do certain things that
[30:47] he must now
[30:48] do amen but he will
[30:51] now fulfill through the bride that work
[30:55] which he left for this specific time
[30:58] amen
[30:59] how many believe that amen
[31:02] can isn't it awesome to be part of this
[31:05] word amen
[31:06] that you are now fulfilling in this hour
[31:11] you are that other part of the scripture
[31:12] that jesus didn't read
[31:15] praise god amen and i know we've all
[31:19] heard these things amen but sometimes
[31:21] you know
[31:21] it's good to come back and and look at
[31:24] our positions in the word
[31:26] amen because satan uh would like to
[31:29] make us look at other things we'd like
[31:31] to keep our eyes focused on other things
[31:34] outside externals and we forget who we
[31:36] are
[31:37] we forget what god has done for us we
[31:39] forget the the
[31:41] the work that god has been doing in our
[31:43] lives
[31:44] and that we have the greater works and
[31:46] we are powerful
[31:48] you have more power laying within you
[31:50] than even satan could ever imagine
[31:52] having and that's the power that he's
[31:54] been wanting this whole time
[31:57] think about that he's been wanting that
[32:01] and you have the secret because he
[32:02] doesn't have the open book you do
[32:06] praise god as a matter of fact you are
[32:08] the open book
[32:09] amen not just have the book you are the
[32:11] open book we'll just look at that here
[32:13] in just a moment amen
[32:14] in chapter three of ruth uh uh we see
[32:17] that uh
[32:18] that ruth she lays at the feet of boaz
[32:21] amen so
[32:22] so it it even
[32:25] even at the woman at the well even
[32:27] though jesus told her about all her life
[32:29] told her
[32:30] her husbands that she had and and
[32:32] revealed all those things to her
[32:34] the woman at the will still had to wait
[32:36] for calvary
[32:38] she still had to go to calvary she still
[32:40] had to accept self receive salvation in
[32:42] her life
[32:43] and and so i i just look at that at ruth
[32:46] amen laying at the feet of buzz it's
[32:48] like a type of
[32:49] of the death of christ us laying at the
[32:51] foot of the cross amen
[32:53] amen there's there's a process amen of
[32:55] salvation there's a process that we must
[32:57] go through
[32:58] amen of justification sanctification
[33:00] baptism of the holy ghost amen
[33:02] and without it there's not you can't be
[33:04] saved you can you can't be fully
[33:06] redeemed without those three processes
[33:08] you have to have those in your life amen
[33:10] you can't skip one
[33:12] amen and say that you're fully redeemed
[33:15] amen ruth had to go through all these
[33:17] processes in order to come to her full
[33:19] redemption
[33:20] amen and i believe that the woman at the
[33:22] well she was there at
[33:24] pentecost amen that's just me personally
[33:27] the bible doesn't say but just me
[33:28] personally thinking
[33:29] because god did something great in her
[33:31] life jesus
[33:33] did something great in her life and i
[33:35] believed that as she was running to tell
[33:36] others hey man she ran over to the
[33:38] to the to the uh uh to the uh to the
[33:41] there at the uh at the day of pentecost
[33:43] i believe she ran there she was there
[33:46] amen because god did something for her
[33:50] and then if you read there in in ruth
[33:51] chapter four ruth is there you see that
[33:54] ruth is redeemed there
[33:55] by boaz and no one else could redeem
[33:58] ruth amen
[33:59] uh even though she had a closer kinsmen
[34:01] and and
[34:02] and we saw that now in the redemption
[34:05] process
[34:07] there in ruth if you read there we know
[34:09] we see there
[34:10] that in verse 11 there of chapter four
[34:12] and it says and all the people that were
[34:14] in the gate
[34:15] and the elders said we are witnesses the
[34:18] lord make the woman that is come into
[34:20] thine house like rachel and like leah
[34:23] which two did build the house of israel
[34:25] and do thou worthily in ephrata
[34:28] and be famous in bethlehem in other
[34:29] words when the redemption process when
[34:32] he announced that he was redeeming ruth
[34:35] amen the people around him amen they
[34:38] were they were uh
[34:39] uh they were congratulating him they
[34:41] were they were giving him uh praise
[34:44] amen for what this great thing that he
[34:46] had done amen
[34:48] and and and it was the same thing when
[34:51] when jesus
[34:52] when he read and he opened the book
[34:54] there in in the synagogue amen
[34:56] people were were were wondering well
[34:58] they were astonished by the words they
[35:00] were
[35:00] they were hearing they were even asking
[35:02] wasn't this just the
[35:03] the son of the of the of joseph the
[35:05] carpenter you know they started
[35:07] expressing themselves what they feel
[35:09] when the book was opened amen when
[35:10] redemption came in on the picture
[35:13] and we see this the same thing took
[35:14] place if you read in revelations chapter
[35:17] 5.
[35:17] amen i want us to look at revelations
[35:19] chapter 5. amen for just a moment
[35:22] amen revelations chapter 5.
[35:28] and it's interesting that in revelations
[35:30] is revelation chapter 5 the number five
[35:32] number of grace yeah that's right amen
[35:37] let's just read this here for just a
[35:38] moment amen you love the lord
[35:40] amen amen praise god and i saw the in
[35:44] the right hand of him that sat on the
[35:46] throne a book
[35:46] written within and on the backside
[35:49] sealed with seven seals
[35:51] so this book was sealed and i saw a
[35:54] strong
[35:54] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[35:56] is worthy to open the book and to lose
[35:58] the seals thereof
[36:00] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[36:02] neither under the earth
[36:04] was able to open the book neither to
[36:07] look thereon
[36:09] there was nobody able to to open this
[36:12] book
[36:13] that that that that that was closed now
[36:16] this book
[36:16] saints is the book that actually adam
[36:19] lost amen there in the garden of eden
[36:22] the book that adam was supposed
[36:26] to come to a place where for a
[36:28] redemption of his body
[36:30] now he was a son of god he had eternal
[36:32] life amen but he
[36:34] did not have eternal life in his flesh
[36:36] and that's what he was
[36:37] that's why he needed that tree of life
[36:38] there to continue eating from the tree
[36:41] of life
[36:42] and eventually he would come to that
[36:44] point amen
[36:45] now the book amen has been redeemed to
[36:48] us and we'll see here in just a moment
[36:50] it's been restored that book that adam
[36:53] uh uh
[36:54] gave up amen the book a book of
[36:56] redemption that adam gave up
[36:58] for the for for the knowledge of of
[37:01] worldly knowledge brother branham says
[37:03] amen you can read these things in in in
[37:06] in revelations uh
[37:07] in the first seal brother brown talks
[37:09] about these things
[37:10] and and he gave up for for satan's
[37:13] worldly knowledge
[37:15] and he lost everything amen and now
[37:18] jesus came back amen
[37:20] and and he restored amen this this book
[37:23] now
[37:23] if we continue reading it says in verse
[37:25] 3 and no man in heaven
[37:27] not nor in earth neither under the earth
[37:29] was able to open the book
[37:31] neither to look thereon and i wept much
[37:34] this was john because no man was found
[37:36] worthy
[37:37] to open and to read the book neither to
[37:40] look thereon and one of the elders said
[37:43] unto me weep not
[37:45] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[37:48] the root of david the hath prevailed
[37:50] to open the book and not just to open it
[37:53] but to lose the seven seals thereof
[37:56] amen and i beheld and lo in the midst of
[37:59] the throne and the four beasts and in
[38:01] the midst of the elders
[38:03] stood a lamb now here john was
[38:07] told that the lion of the tribe of judah
[38:09] was the one that was worthy to open the
[38:11] book
[38:12] but when john heard this and he turned
[38:14] around what he saw was a lamb
[38:17] he was he thought that it was supposed
[38:19] to be a lion because that's what he was
[38:21] told
[38:22] when he turns around he sees a lamb and
[38:24] not just any lamb look what the bible
[38:26] says
[38:27] and and in the midst of the elders stood
[38:29] a lamb as it had been slain
[38:32] in other words it was bloody it was it
[38:35] was it was torn
[38:37] it was it was it was it was ripped yeah
[38:40] it was not a pretty sight right
[38:43] jesus's death wasn't a pretty sight
[38:46] i think i said this last time amen the
[38:49] uh uh
[38:50] the the mel gibson's movie amen the
[38:52] passion of the christ doesn't even do it
[38:54] justice
[38:55] that's that doesn't even scratch the
[38:57] surface of how jesus looks
[38:59] and it looks bad in the movie if you've
[39:01] seen the movie
[39:02] amen jesus it was much worse than that
[39:04] amen not to mention that he was hanging
[39:06] before people
[39:08] hanging before the people naked amen
[39:12] nude you know we always see them see him
[39:14] that he's got a little
[39:16] a little cloth around him and he didn't
[39:18] even have that
[39:20] fully exposed that's what a lamb is
[39:25] before a pastor before you're fully
[39:28] exposed
[39:29] to the to the elements of the world
[39:31] you're fully exposed to the
[39:33] to the dangers of the world you're fully
[39:35] exposed
[39:36] to everyone and that's the reason why
[39:38] we've got to have the shepherd the great
[39:40] shepherd to lead us amen
[39:42] because the same lamb amen that died for
[39:44] us he's the same one that leads us amen
[39:47] he's our pastor he's our shepherd amen
[39:49] we can't depend on ourselves we've got
[39:52] to be led
[39:53] if we are true sheep if we are true
[39:55] lambs amen
[39:57] praise god and i beheld and lo
[40:00] in verse 5 and one of the elders said
[40:01] unto me well where am i
[40:03] oh verse 6 and i beheld and lo in the
[40:06] midst of the throne
[40:07] and the four beasts and in the midst of
[40:08] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[40:10] slain
[40:11] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[40:13] are the seven spirits of god
[40:15] sent forth into all the earth we could
[40:17] be here all evening talking about those
[40:19] different things but we'll just move on
[40:22] and he came
[40:23] and took the book out of the right hand
[40:25] of him
[40:26] that sat upon the throne amen
[40:30] and when he had taken the book the four
[40:33] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[40:35] down before the lamb
[40:36] having every one of them harps and
[40:38] golden vials full of odors which are the
[40:40] prayers of saints
[40:41] and watch what they did they were doing
[40:42] the exact same thing that what that took
[40:44] place when
[40:45] ruth was redeemed amen when jesus opened
[40:49] the book
[40:50] the exact same thing is taking place
[40:52] praise is given forth it
[40:53] comes forth and when he had taken the
[40:55] book the four beasts and four and twenty
[40:57] elders fell
[40:57] down before the lamb having every one of
[40:59] them harps and golden vows full of odors
[41:02] which are the prayers of the saints
[41:03] and they sung a new song saying thou
[41:05] worthy to take the book
[41:07] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[41:09] was slain and has redeemed us to god by
[41:12] the blood
[41:13] out of every kindred and and tongue and
[41:16] people and nation look what it says
[41:17] there in verse 9
[41:18] and for thou slain and has redeemed us
[41:21] amen to god amen by the blood
[41:25] redeemed amen there we see the complete
[41:29] plan of redemption right there
[41:30] amen taking place before us and it
[41:32] wasn't it wasn't the lion
[41:34] although it was but it was a lamb amen
[41:37] a lamb that redeems us praise god and
[41:40] has made us unto our
[41:42] god kings and priests and watch him we
[41:45] shall reign on the earth amen
[41:48] praise the lord see you are kings and
[41:51] priests in this hour saints
[41:53] amen brother branham says in the first
[41:55] seal and as
[41:56] as i mentioned earlier you can read that
[41:58] yourselves and
[41:59] he says john turning he saw a lamb
[42:01] coming out he must have been bloody and
[42:03] cut and wounded
[42:04] it had been slain uh said that a lamb
[42:07] that had been slain and of course
[42:09] uh it was still bloody if you if you had
[42:13] cut the lamb
[42:13] and killed it the way that lamb was
[42:16] anyhow it was hacked to pieces on a
[42:17] cross
[42:18] spears in the side and nails in the
[42:20] hands and feet and thorns over the brow
[42:23] he was in an awful condition and this
[42:25] lamb come forth and went over to him
[42:27] that set upon the throne
[42:29] that held the complete title deed of
[42:31] redemption
[42:32] what adam lost amen the lamb regained
[42:34] for us amen restored
[42:36] and the lamb goes and takes the book out
[42:38] of the hand of him
[42:39] that set up on the throne and was took
[42:42] and opened the seals and open the book
[42:45] praise god amen and we'll continue here
[42:48] reading in just a moment but you know
[42:49] what saints i want you to keep in mind
[42:51] that it wasn't brother branham that
[42:52] opened the seals
[42:55] it wasn't wasn't the prophet brother
[42:58] branham when he preached when he was
[43:00] going to preach the seals
[43:01] he was going to preach the exact same
[43:03] way that he preached them in the early
[43:04] 50s
[43:06] but it but it was god that intervened
[43:10] the angel of the lord came in there amen
[43:12] every day amen and told them this is
[43:14] this this is this
[43:15] this is this and if it wasn't for that
[43:17] amen we would still have
[43:19] a closed book amen it wouldn't be an
[43:22] open book for us
[43:23] it'd still be closed even though we read
[43:26] the literal word we read the text we
[43:28] read in john chapter five what happened
[43:31] but many people throughout the ages they
[43:33] they they looked and they probed
[43:35] at john i'm sorry revelations chapter
[43:38] five
[43:40] and those different things and they they
[43:41] they just guessed
[43:43] amen but we see the full opening of the
[43:46] book now praise god
[43:47] brother branham continues on saying it
[43:49] says and then when that had happened
[43:51] we found out there must have been a
[43:53] great something took place in heaven
[43:55] for the elders and the four and twenty
[43:57] elders and the beasts and
[43:58] everything in heaven began to cry worthy
[44:01] and and here come the angels and poured
[44:03] out the vows of the prayers of
[44:04] saints the saints under the altar
[44:07] screamed out worthy art thou o lamb
[44:10] for you have redeemed us and now you
[44:12] have made us kings and priests
[44:15] and we shall rule on the earth oh my and
[44:17] that's so when he opened that book
[44:19] amen amen praise god
[44:23] amen so i say this saints to
[44:26] to to to bring bring it down to to this
[44:29] point
[44:30] because i want us to go now to
[44:32] revelations chapter 10.
[44:34] revelations chapter 10. now that was
[44:36] revelations chapter 5
[44:38] and we know that 5 is the number of
[44:39] grace so it's interesting that
[44:41] revelations chapter 10
[44:43] is 5 plus 5 equals 10.
[44:46] uh i call it the double you get that
[44:50] double grace because what was at the cap
[44:51] what was that the mount what was it the
[44:53] capstone
[44:54] it wasn't just grace it was grace grace
[44:58] you get that double grace amen so here
[45:01] is revelations chapter 10.
[45:03] now that the book had been ope had been
[45:05] redeemed amen
[45:07] and in revelation chapter 10 here stands
[45:09] the lamb amen
[45:10] with the open book amen in his hand and
[45:13] his right hand
[45:14] yeah now i call it double double because
[45:16] uh
[45:17] in canada there's a
[45:21] there's a chain of of of of uh
[45:24] of stores there of of it's like it's
[45:26] like starbucks but i mean it's it's a
[45:28] coffee
[45:29] coffee place and it's and it's called
[45:31] tim hortons i don't know if you ever
[45:32] heard of it before
[45:34] and if you want a coffee there with
[45:37] two sugars i believe and and two
[45:39] creamers you say i want a double double
[45:42] amen so i just thought you know double
[45:44] double double grace amen
[45:46] that's when it tastes good i don't want
[45:50] just grace i want double grace
[45:52] i need double grace amen the crapstone
[45:55] is crying
[45:56] grace grace amen praise god not just
[45:59] grace
[46:00] but double grace so that leads us to
[46:02] revelations chapter 10 amen
[46:04] and it says and i saw another mighty
[46:06] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[46:08] a cloud
[46:09] and and i like what brother wade was
[46:13] saying there on sunday that
[46:14] how god hid this amen because that angel
[46:17] there is
[46:18] it's lower case a but we know that
[46:21] that's christ
[46:22] amen amen the mighty angel came down
[46:25] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[46:27] rainbow was
[46:28] upon his head and his face was as it
[46:30] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[46:32] fire
[46:33] amen now you see here in the end time we
[46:35] see
[46:36] that that that's the true meaning of
[46:38] what the rainbow is amen
[46:40] it's not what the world tells you it is
[46:43] that's a perversion of it
[46:45] perversion of the rainbow i would say
[46:48] this young people do not believe what
[46:50] they tell you out here in the in
[46:51] in the schools because we we see some
[46:54] trying times ahead of us
[46:57] they're going to start changing
[46:58] curriculums in schools they're going to
[47:01] start changing
[47:01] your mindset of of of accept certain
[47:04] lifestyles
[47:06] and accept certain ways and things like
[47:08] that and
[47:09] and i've i've expressed this to my to my
[47:11] children
[47:12] and parents i believe that we must be
[47:14] even more vigilant now than ever
[47:18] you you cannot depend on the teachers
[47:21] that
[47:21] the teachers all they can do is just say
[47:24] what they're told to say
[47:26] now you have to fill in those gaps
[47:29] because they're there to
[47:31] satan is going to try to destroy your
[47:33] children he is there
[47:34] amen satan wants to this wants to take
[47:38] your children
[47:38] in seed form that's why he's uh
[47:42] that's what we see all this abortion and
[47:44] all these things you see it's a seed
[47:46] and if satan can destroy amen in seed
[47:48] form
[47:49] he doesn't there's no chance for that
[47:51] seed to grow
[47:53] that's why he tries he's he's he's
[47:55] attacking our children
[47:57] more than ever nowadays amen amen
[48:00] just because the government said so or
[48:02] just because school such and such said
[48:04] so doesn't make it so
[48:06] amazing doesn't make it true amen the
[48:08] word is true
[48:09] amen that's what we do that's what we
[48:11] lean upon amen
[48:12] i don't care who says what and one day
[48:15] amen we they may close our church down
[48:17] because of the way we see things the way
[48:19] we believe amen
[48:20] and the way we come against these things
[48:22] but i'm certainly not going to stand for
[48:24] certain
[48:24] things that they believe out there amen
[48:27] you as parents amen you have to at some
[48:28] point you're going to have to put your
[48:30] foot down and say
[48:31] listen i'm not allowing this in my in my
[48:32] home right i'm not allowing this type of
[48:35] mindset in my family because they'll
[48:37] they're coming sneakingly
[48:38] for you to kind of be appeased for those
[48:41] certain lifestyles and all those
[48:43] different things
[48:45] it's just so sneak how sneak how they're
[48:47] sneaking that in your life
[48:49] and you just have to be on the guard in
[48:51] this hour and for those they're
[48:53] the older younger people amen and those
[48:55] who you're thinking about marriage and
[48:57] things like that
[48:58] these are things that you have to look
[48:59] at you're going to have to face them
[49:01] even worse than we are right now
[49:03] if if time if time allows it that's
[49:06] right
[49:07] we're living in a perverse world
[49:11] praise god so that is what the meaning
[49:13] of the rainbow really is there
[49:15] in verse two and it says and he had in
[49:17] his hand the little book
[49:18] opened so we know that this book amen it
[49:21] was it was open already we see
[49:22] it uh opened in revelations chapter five
[49:26] amen and he set this right foot upon the
[49:28] sea and his left foot on the earth
[49:31] and cloud and crowd with a loud voice
[49:32] and when a lion as when a lion roareth
[49:35] and when he had cried seven thunders
[49:37] utter their voices
[49:39] amen now it wasn't just he was just the
[49:41] lamb the meek lamb that was slain amen
[49:44] now he's coming in judgment amen as a
[49:47] lion praise god
[49:48] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[49:50] their voices i was about to write said
[49:52] john and i heard a voice from heaven
[49:54] saying unto me seal up those things
[49:55] which the seven thunders uttered and
[49:57] write them not amen
[49:59] praise god and the angel which i saw
[50:01] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[50:03] lifted up his hand
[50:04] to heaven and swear by him that liveth
[50:06] forever and ever who created heaven and
[50:08] the things that their
[50:09] their therein are and the earth and the
[50:12] things that therein are and the sea
[50:13] and the things which are therein that
[50:15] there should be time no longer
[50:17] now watch but in the days of the voice
[50:19] of the seventh angel
[50:21] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[50:24] of god
[50:25] should be finished as he had declared to
[50:28] his servants the prophets
[50:30] now a lot of people just leave it there
[50:33] it's finished but now there's a part
[50:35] that we must took
[50:36] that we must partake in amen that we
[50:40] must
[50:40] exercise and the voice which i heard
[50:42] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[50:45] go and take the little book
[50:50] now look what it says go and take the
[50:51] little book not just a little book but
[50:53] go and take the little book which is
[50:55] open
[50:56] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[50:59] upon the sea
[50:59] and upon the earth so it's up to you and
[51:02] i saints in this hour to
[51:04] go and take the book amen brother dale
[51:07] he can't force you to go take the book
[51:09] brother wade can't do it nobody else can
[51:11] do it amen it's got to be you
[51:13] to go take that book it's got to be you
[51:15] amen to
[51:16] get in the word amen it's got to be you
[51:18] to get a revelation
[51:19] for yourself praise god
[51:23] even god can't give you a force of
[51:25] revelation upon you if you don't want it
[51:28] it's got to be him to do it it's got to
[51:30] be you you've got to want for him to do
[51:32] it amen
[51:34] so what god is what
[51:37] what god is telling what what the angel
[51:39] is telling john to do here in
[51:41] revelations chapter 10
[51:42] was the exact same thing that the lamb
[51:44] did in revelations chapter 5.
[51:48] say that again what god is telling
[51:51] john to do amen here in revelation 10 is
[51:53] what the lamb did in revelations chapter
[51:56] five
[51:56] good took and took the book amen so
[51:59] everything that jesus did
[52:02] the life that he lived the the the
[52:04] things that happen as the head goes
[52:06] so does the rest of the body amen
[52:10] praise god i've said it before when you
[52:12] wake up in the morning when you wake up
[52:14] from your bed amen
[52:16] usually it's your head that gets up
[52:17] first then it's the rest of the body
[52:20] right normally it can't be the other way
[52:24] around amen
[52:26] yeah i guess sometimes the most we've
[52:27] fallen out of bed you know and
[52:29] our feet touch the ground first amen but
[52:31] normally it's our head that gets up
[52:33] amen jesus was the first fruits of the
[52:36] resurrection amen
[52:37] because he lives i can live as well
[52:40] because he lives i can face tomorrow
[52:43] amen because he raised in triumph and
[52:46] victory amen
[52:47] all power was given unto him both in
[52:49] heaven and earth
[52:50] praise god i have that same power you
[52:53] and i
[52:53] praise god amen
[52:57] and we know that john here in revelation
[52:59] chapter 10 he's a type of the bride amen
[53:02] now watch in verse 9 and i went unto the
[53:05] angel
[53:06] and this is john speaking and i went
[53:07] unto the angel and said unto him
[53:09] give me the little book amen amen and he
[53:12] said unto me
[53:14] take it i can't you know he just can't
[53:17] give it to you amen
[53:18] you've got to take it amen amen you've
[53:21] got to take it
[53:22] and eat it up not just take it but eat
[53:25] it up and
[53:25] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[53:28] shall be in thy mouth's
[53:29] sweetest honey and i took the little
[53:32] book out of the angel's hand
[53:34] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[53:36] sweet as honey
[53:37] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[53:40] was bitter
[53:41] amen and he said unto me
[53:44] watch thou must prophesy again before
[53:47] many peoples
[53:48] and nations in tongues and kings
[53:52] and what verse is that
[53:55] verse 11. i don't think that's there
[53:58] just to be there
[54:00] that's the hour that we're living in
[54:02] saints that's you and i in this hour
[54:05] amen thou must prophesy again
[54:08] before must there's no way around it we
[54:11] must prophesy again in this hour
[54:14] we look at if we look at the that word
[54:16] prophesy
[54:17] is the greek word prophet prophetio
[54:20] prophetic you i think the brothers can
[54:23] bring that up
[54:24] and it's watch to foretell advance
[54:27] divine
[54:28] to speak under inspiration
[54:32] amen that's just not for a preacher
[54:38] it's just not for me or for brother dale
[54:40] for brother wade amen
[54:41] you sisters have a part to speak this
[54:43] word amen amen
[54:45] praise god you young people you have a
[54:47] part to speak this word amen
[54:49] amen exercise the prophetic office
[54:52] prophesy
[54:53] that's in the strong concordance now in
[54:55] the thayer's dictionary
[54:57] that same thing it says uh it says to
[55:00] utter forth declare a thing which can
[55:02] only be known by divine revelation
[55:06] so before you speak you have to it has
[55:09] to be revealed to you
[55:10] amen under like prompting to teach
[55:13] refute reprove admonish and comfort
[55:16] others
[55:17] amen praise god so you can't do none of
[55:19] those things unless the comforter is in
[55:21] you
[55:22] amen i can't comfort you unless the
[55:24] comforter is in there
[55:25] praise god what did jesus tell the tell
[55:27] peter amen when you get
[55:29] converted peter then you go strengthen
[55:31] your brethren
[55:32] amen but we can't strengthen one another
[55:35] amen when you're not even converted
[55:38] amen when you don't even want to one you
[55:40] don't you're not even
[55:42] god's not even dealing in your life you
[55:44] can't help somebody else spiritually
[55:46] praise god amen now this
[55:49] this here in john in in revelation
[55:52] chapter 10 ties in directly with ezekiel
[55:54] chapter 3
[55:56] amen where ezekiel eats the eats the
[55:58] role
[55:59] amen there in ezekiel in ezekiel chapter
[56:02] 3 verse 1 it says moreover he said unto
[56:04] me son of man
[56:05] eat that thou find us eat this roll and
[56:08] go speak
[56:09] unto the house of israel so before you
[56:12] go speak you must eat the roll
[56:14] not just he eat the book amen
[56:18] i opened my mouth verse two so i opened
[56:20] my mouth and he caused me to eat that
[56:22] roll
[56:23] verse three and he said unto me son of
[56:25] man cause thy belly to eat
[56:28] and fill thy bowels with this roll that
[56:30] i give thee
[56:32] then did i eat it and it was in my mouth
[56:34] as honey
[56:35] for sweetness so it was the same thing
[56:37] that john experienced is the same thing
[56:39] that ezekiel experienced here
[56:42] and he said unto me son of man go get
[56:44] thee
[56:45] unto the house of israel and speak
[56:48] with my words unto them praise god amen
[56:52] so the book has to be had to already
[56:54] been open in order for you to be able to
[56:56] go eat it fully
[56:58] and you go speak the words amen praise
[57:01] god
[57:02] now in verse in amos chapter 3
[57:06] verse 7 through 8 brother brother wade's
[57:08] been reading this
[57:09] uh last several verses it says surely
[57:12] the lord god will do nothing but he
[57:14] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[57:16] the prophets
[57:19] verse 8 the lion hath roared who will
[57:22] not fear
[57:23] the lord god hath spoken who can but
[57:25] prophesy
[57:27] and you know if you look at those two
[57:28] verses there they kind of tie in with
[57:30] revelations chapter 10 verse 7 and 8.
[57:33] amen amen where it says but in the days
[57:35] of the voice of the seventh angel
[57:37] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[57:39] of god should be
[57:40] re we should be finished see god is not
[57:43] going to do nothing unless he reveals it
[57:44] to his servants the prophets first
[57:46] amen and we've seen that in our day amen
[57:49] the lion hath roared
[57:50] amen we saw that in revelations chapter
[57:52] 10 at the beginning
[57:54] amen he cried with a loud voice amen
[57:57] and who will not fear the lord god has
[57:59] spoken who can but prophesy amen
[58:02] amen you can't do nothing but prophesy
[58:05] when this word is in you amen
[58:07] and what is prophesying amen is is
[58:09] speaking or
[58:10] or or even if you look at that word
[58:13] prophesy in the hebrew it says
[58:14] to speak or sing by inspiration
[58:18] so you can speak amen or you can sing by
[58:21] inspiration
[58:22] amen that's that's a problem that's a
[58:24] prophecy right
[58:25] that's like prophesying amen doesn't
[58:27] necessarily mean just like a
[58:29] like a way a prophet the way we look at
[58:31] our prophet
[58:32] but prophesying is like speaking his
[58:34] word amen
[58:36] you have that that authority in this
[58:38] hour saints
[58:39] if the word is in you amen praise god
[58:48] amen
[58:50] praise the lord let's just read this
[58:54] here in
[58:54] in in in the uh church age book amen
[59:01] now this is a little lengthy but but
[59:04] just look at what brother branham says
[59:05] here the word of promise came to the
[59:07] virgin mary
[59:08] but that word of promise was he himself
[59:11] to be made manifest
[59:13] god was made manifest he himself
[59:16] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[59:19] word of promise
[59:20] in the virgin it was an angel that had
[59:24] brought her the message speaking of the
[59:26] virgin mary
[59:27] amen but the angel's message was the
[59:30] word of god
[59:31] isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time
[59:34] all that was written of him because she
[59:37] accepted his word
[59:39] to her amen so jesus amen so god
[59:43] did exactly what he needed to do he
[59:45] fulfilled his word amen when he gave his
[59:47] word to mary
[59:49] amen and that word was fulfilled in
[59:50] mary's life amen
[59:52] and what did she say be it unto me
[59:53] according to thy word
[59:55] amen that's like you eating the book
[59:59] amen lord you said it i believe it
[1:00:02] that settles it amen that's like you
[1:00:03] taking the whole book
[1:00:05] amen the members of the virgin bride
[1:00:08] will love him
[1:00:09] and they will have his potentials for he
[1:00:12] is their head and all power belongs to
[1:00:15] him
[1:00:16] they are subject to him as the members
[1:00:19] of our bodies are subject to our heads
[1:00:22] that's why the head of the head wherever
[1:00:24] the head moves that's where the body
[1:00:25] goes
[1:00:27] it'd be kind of weird if you know if you
[1:00:28] were looking this way but your body's
[1:00:30] trying to move this way
[1:00:31] amen notice the harmony of the father
[1:00:34] and the son jesus never did
[1:00:36] anything until it was first showed him
[1:00:39] by the father
[1:00:40] john 5 19. watch this harmony
[1:00:44] is now to exist between the groom and
[1:00:46] his bride
[1:00:48] he shows her his word of life she
[1:00:51] receives it
[1:00:52] she never doubts it therefore nothing
[1:00:55] can
[1:00:55] harm her not even death for if the seed
[1:00:58] be planted the water will raise it up
[1:01:00] again
[1:01:02] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:01:04] in the bride
[1:01:05] as it was in mary the full word
[1:01:09] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:01:11] knows what she wants
[1:01:12] done with the word she performs the
[1:01:15] command of the word in his name
[1:01:20] for she has thus saith the lord then the
[1:01:23] word is
[1:01:24] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:01:27] pass
[1:01:28] that's why you have to receive the word
[1:01:29] first then that word has to be quickened
[1:01:32] amen there is never been
[1:01:36] a a new birth to take place without the
[1:01:38] word
[1:01:39] first being that's that's part of the
[1:01:41] ingredients
[1:01:42] amen a full knee birth has to be there
[1:01:45] in with
[1:01:46] by the word the word has to be preached
[1:01:48] first
[1:01:50] like a seed that is planted in water it
[1:01:52] comes to full harvest
[1:01:54] serving its purpose those in the bride
[1:01:57] do only his will
[1:01:59] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:02:03] they have thus said the lord or they
[1:02:05] keep still amen so we read this earth
[1:02:07] just a little bit ago amen praise god
[1:02:11] so saints you are the people of the open
[1:02:13] book
[1:02:14] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 2
[1:02:16] tells us
[1:02:17] ye are our pistol written in our hearts
[1:02:20] known and read of all men amen amen
[1:02:25] if we have the open book amen in our
[1:02:28] lives amen
[1:02:29] that's what we must be expressing that's
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:32] you can't say you have the open book
[1:02:34] amen and be expressing something
[1:02:36] different
[1:02:37] it has to be amen what did what was john
[1:02:39] gonna do when he ate the book
[1:02:41] the same thing that the lamb did the
[1:02:43] same thing that the lion did
[1:02:45] express him amen verse three there in
[1:02:48] second corinthians and we're finished
[1:02:49] with this for as much
[1:02:50] as you are manifestly declared to be the
[1:02:53] epistle of christ
[1:02:55] ministered by us written not with ink
[1:02:58] amen so in other words there's nothing
[1:03:00] carnal
[1:03:02] man but with the spirit of the living
[1:03:04] god
[1:03:05] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[1:03:08] tables of the heart
[1:03:10] that's where that word wants to abide in
[1:03:12] such trust have we
[1:03:13] through christ to godward not that we
[1:03:16] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:03:18] anything as of ourselves but our
[1:03:20] sufficiency
[1:03:21] is of god now watch verse 6 who also
[1:03:24] hath made us
[1:03:26] able ministers of the new testament not
[1:03:29] of the letter
[1:03:30] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[1:03:33] but the spirit
[1:03:34] giveth life amen so this
[1:03:37] has nothing to do with you need the
[1:03:40] letter
[1:03:41] man we gotta read the word we gotta have
[1:03:43] the letter in order to obtain
[1:03:45] get to a revelation praise god but
[1:03:49] um if you you can have the letter
[1:03:52] a lot of people have the letter but they
[1:03:54] don't have the spirit backing it up
[1:03:56] and it doesn't produce the life amen
[1:03:59] so that's like uh you know if john was
[1:04:01] eating that book amen
[1:04:04] you can eat the book but it has to be
[1:04:06] the open book
[1:04:08] amen right it would be different if john
[1:04:11] was eating that book
[1:04:12] and that book not be open right it'd be
[1:04:16] different then
[1:04:17] he would not be able to manifest fully
[1:04:19] what took place in revelations chapter
[1:04:21] 5.
[1:04:22] amen but that book was open and that's
[1:04:24] the reason why john could eat it and
[1:04:26] john
[1:04:27] being our type amen type in the bride
[1:04:29] amen amen we do the same in this hour
[1:04:31] saints praise god amen you must eat the
[1:04:35] book amen
[1:04:36] you must you must be the book amen amen
[1:04:40] not just eat it but be the book in this
[1:04:42] hour praise god
[1:04:43] and the book is open no matter what they
[1:04:45] tell you no matter what anybody says
[1:04:47] amen i don't care what
[1:04:48] anybody says or somebody it could have
[1:04:51] been the greatest person that
[1:04:53] that even preached this message
[1:04:57] the book is open amen this word has been
[1:05:01] has been vindicated amen thoroughly
[1:05:03] vindicated
[1:05:04] amen amen and and you just watch there's
[1:05:08] a lot of spirits
[1:05:09] out there a lot of luring spirits
[1:05:13] amen but you watch those people's lives
[1:05:15] afterwards
[1:05:16] right and and you realize
[1:05:19] if they ate the open book they'd be
[1:05:21] expressing the open book
[1:05:23] right but you see their lives and you
[1:05:25] see the way they go
[1:05:26] and it's totally contrary to the open
[1:05:28] book amen
[1:05:30] that's right so you make sure we we we
[1:05:32] feed off the open book amen
[1:05:34] i'm gonna cut it off there we're gonna
[1:05:36] cut off early let's stand to our feet
[1:05:39] praise the lord let's have the musicians
[1:05:41] come
[1:05:46] you are the people of the open book
[1:05:51] praise god
