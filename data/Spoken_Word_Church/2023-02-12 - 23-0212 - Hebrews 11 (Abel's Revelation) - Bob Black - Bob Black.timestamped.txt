[0:55] thank you
[1:03] God bless you thanks we've got a full
[1:05] house this morning
[1:07] we had a we had a wonderful time last
[1:08] night didn't we that was I love laughing
[1:11] and having a good time with family
[1:13] and y'all are my family
[1:17] let me see if I can get this slideshow
[1:19] started
[1:23] we've been going through the book of
[1:25] Hebrews and um and made it through three
[1:27] verses of Hebrews 11.
[1:30] so we're going to get to verse four
[1:32] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:33] before we begin our study Lord God we're
[1:34] so grateful to be able to gather around
[1:36] your word this morning as we look into
[1:37] these things Lord I pray you lord it's
[1:39] your Quicken that to us
[1:40] give us an understanding Lord Jesus so
[1:42] we can read between the lines and I pray
[1:44] God that you'll just prepare our minds
[1:45] Lord to receive the word that comes
[1:47] forth and the sermons today Lord God
[1:48] granted Lord Jesus bless the services we
[1:50] pray in your name amen
[1:54] now Hebrews 11 verse 1 says now Faith is
[1:56] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:58] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[2:00] the elders obtained a good rapport
[2:03] so if you want to have a good report if
[2:05] you want to please God you've got to
[2:06] have faith and we were kind of laying
[2:08] down the last few Sunday school lessons
[2:10] about how that faith is based upon
[2:11] something not just based upon your own
[2:13] ideas or just uh like like somebody came
[2:15] to brother Brown and said can I just I
[2:17] could just put my hand on a tree and I'd
[2:19] have faith no he got to base it on
[2:20] something and we base it upon God's word
[2:22] and so all these things that Paul says
[2:24] leading up to chapter 11 is to to ground
[2:27] us that we can trust what God said that
[2:29] he gave us two immutable things he uh
[2:32] God they can't lie made a promise on
[2:34] they made a nose on top of that and all
[2:36] these things that to give us confidence
[2:38] to build us our confidence up that we
[2:40] can trust what God says we can believe
[2:43] what God Said now Hebrews 11 has all
[2:46] these examples that when you believe God
[2:47] something's going to happen we're not
[2:49] just believing for something in vain and
[2:51] and one of the first examples I want to
[2:53] look at is is that uh is the life of
[2:56] Abel
[2:57] um so verse 3 says through through faith
[2:59] we understand that the world we're
[3:00] framed by the word of God so that things
[3:02] which were not seen were were not made
[3:04] of which are seen were not made of
[3:06] things which do appear
[3:08] you know like I said last Sunday that
[3:11] that should give us confidence to know
[3:12] that if if uh if the worlds were framed
[3:15] by the word of God well what kind of
[3:17] effect can the word of God have in our
[3:19] life that the word of God can have an
[3:20] effect on the cosmos and the and the and
[3:23] the and the Very Earth that we're
[3:24] standing on to holding in his position
[3:26] and and situate it so that we can have
[3:29] life and breathe air and all those
[3:30] things all by the word of God and what
[3:32] what kind of confidence should we have
[3:34] that the word of God would have an
[3:35] effect in our own lives and so that's
[3:38] the kind of confidence that all these
[3:40] great Heroes of Faith in Hebrews 11 have
[3:42] that that they knew that if they trusted
[3:44] God if they trusted what he said that
[3:46] something was going to happen
[3:48] and so in verse 4 it says by faith Abel
[3:51] offered unto God a more excellent
[3:53] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[3:55] witness that he was righteous
[3:57] y'all excuse me this morning God
[4:00] testifying of his gifts and by he being
[4:02] dead yes speaketh now now you think
[4:05] about what a situation that was that
[4:07] Abel
[4:08] had heard the story about his how his
[4:11] parents were kind of had to leave the
[4:14] Garden of Eden and what had happened
[4:15] there and I was reading a quote
[4:16] yesterday where brother Brown said that
[4:19] um that Adam and uh that Cain and Abel
[4:21] had been instructed by Adam and Eve and
[4:24] maybe just growing up they had had heard
[4:27] all the little stories about how that
[4:29] God clothed them when they were leaving
[4:30] the Garden of Eden and and um that their
[4:33] their their their their covering of fig
[4:35] leaves wasn't good enough and and all
[4:38] those things and yeah you see so you see
[4:40] that now Cain and Abel were really on
[4:42] the same level as far as that goes as
[4:44] far as the education that they had and
[4:47] the kind of the background but there was
[4:49] something that set Cain and Abel apart
[4:51] something that differentiated them one
[4:53] had something the other didn't and what
[4:55] the one had what Abel had was a
[4:57] revelation from God you see a revelation
[4:59] is what makes a difference Revelation is
[5:03] the is the thing
[5:04] when the maniac of gadar brother Raymond
[5:06] said look come in here at Abel not with
[5:08] the working
[5:09] not trying to work something up and that
[5:12] what we do sometimes we try to force it
[5:14] we try to work work try to try to make
[5:16] it happen but it's got to be just
[5:18] something natural that comes wrap the
[5:21] little Vine around this old sheep's neck
[5:23] and here you come pulling him up there
[5:24] throwing him up on the Altar and begin
[5:26] to beat his throat and killed him
[5:29] what a what a what a strange horrible
[5:32] looking situation but Abel did all those
[5:34] things because he had a revelation of
[5:35] what God required you think about you
[5:38] think about what that Revelation gave
[5:40] Abel that he knew the predicament that
[5:42] he was in he knew how they got there and
[5:44] he knew how to get back
[5:46] and this morning you can have that same
[5:48] Revelation how to get back into
[5:49] fellowship with God if you can if God
[5:52] can reveal to you that you need
[5:53] something that you need a redeemer to
[5:55] reveal to you that you ain't where
[5:57] you're supposed to be and reveal to you
[5:59] how to get back that you need a blood
[6:00] covering then something can happen just
[6:03] like it did with Abel you know sometimes
[6:05] we forget in the story that that
[6:07] something happened when Abel offered up
[6:09] that sacrifice God recognized that
[6:11] sacrifice some way or another he knew
[6:14] that God accepted that his faith and and
[6:17] and and he recognized it and God
[6:19] recognized his his faith and his
[6:21] sacrifice and what he what he came to
[6:23] offer in such a way that it got Cain
[6:25] kind of kind of upset a little bit so
[6:28] this morning maybe if we have time we'll
[6:30] examine that how did how did God
[6:32] recognize Abel's sacrifice
[6:35] you know this is uh looking back 10
[6:38] years ago this was maybe more than 10
[6:40] years ago this is the very first Sunday
[6:42] school lesson that I ever gave was
[6:44] Abel's sacrifice so that's kind of
[6:48] interesting for me
[6:49] why Abel had a revelation we're letting
[6:52] that soak just a minute it was a
[6:53] revelation that Abel had that made him
[6:56] just
[6:57] the Revelation that Abel had that made
[6:59] him just he had a revelation of the
[7:01] requirement of almighty God and he
[7:03] brought a lamb and that's the only way
[7:05] that you'll ever be able to see Divine
[7:07] Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:09] it'll be by revelation
[7:13] to see God's requirement that God made a
[7:17] sacrifice for you that's what you needed
[7:18] the blood that what's the requirement
[7:20] the requirement is life
[7:22] they brought around well in Genesis
[7:24] chapter four it said if we go back and
[7:26] it said in in prop in process of time it
[7:28] came to pass that Cain brought of the
[7:31] fruit of the ground and offering unto
[7:33] the Lord and Abel he also brought the
[7:35] firstlings of his flock and of the fact
[7:37] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[7:40] Abel into his offering but unto Cain and
[7:43] to his offering he had not respect and
[7:45] Cain was very Roth and his countenance
[7:47] failed now as we started this out you
[7:49] can kind of see you see the difference
[7:50] there they they both had a religious
[7:52] education they both had an understanding
[7:54] of religious precepts and things like
[7:56] like going to church and paying your
[7:58] tithes and being a good citizen and and
[8:00] all those kind of things but see that's
[8:01] not good enough just going to church and
[8:04] warming the Pew and keeping the lights
[8:05] on and all those kind of things is not
[8:07] good enough the difference is a
[8:08] revelation you've got to have a
[8:10] revelation of what God requires
[8:13] your brother said in the faith it was
[8:15] once delivered to the Saints he said now
[8:17] look at Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain
[8:19] when he come back to Eden he was just as
[8:22] religious as he could be he was just as
[8:24] religious as he could be
[8:26] he brought flowers and so forth and put
[8:28] them on the altar he brought the fruits
[8:31] of the field and laid them laid them
[8:33] down he believed in God
[8:35] he worshiped God
[8:37] he sacrificed to God he built a church
[8:40] to God just as religious as he could be
[8:44] I got all these highlighted so it really
[8:46] stands out to us this morning just as
[8:49] religious as he could be and Abel rolled
[8:51] him up a rock and made him a Church of
[8:53] Worship place that Cain had all this
[8:55] stuff all these things that he was doing
[8:57] and all this all this religious things
[8:58] that were that were backing up what his
[9:00] form of worship but Abel just rolled up
[9:02] a rock
[9:03] it's it's simplistic if you if you know
[9:07] a revelation of your God
[9:10] a revelation trumps all the religious
[9:12] forms and like we were sharing uh how
[9:15] when we went to Nicaragua we got to we
[9:17] got to take a look at one of those the
[9:18] this big Catholic church and they had
[9:20] all the forms and all the gold-plated
[9:22] things and all of that all that built up
[9:25] and big models of the all the different
[9:27] things of Jesus's life and of a finger
[9:31] that you could look at of Jesus being
[9:33] crucified and Jesus rising from the
[9:36] grave and all those things but yet where
[9:38] where's the Revelation Revelation is
[9:40] what separates the thing Revelation is
[9:42] what makes a difference
[9:45] and brother I'm sitting in the face that
[9:47] was once delivered to the Saints he said
[9:48] if oh if you can only see this you'll
[9:51] see the greatest thing you've seen in
[9:53] years look not because I'm standing here
[9:55] saying it but if you can understand how
[9:57] it is that faith is not something
[10:00] mentally perceived but it is a
[10:02] revelation a revelation of God by faith
[10:06] not intellectual but by his heart oh you
[10:09] see now there's the difference between
[10:11] Cain and Abel Cain was coming in with a
[10:13] mental understanding an intellational
[10:15] understanding based on what his mama and
[10:17] daddy had taught him see that's how
[10:19] sometimes we come to church when and
[10:20] brother round would you know he would
[10:22] constantly say you can't go on anybody's
[10:24] coattails based on just what somebody's
[10:26] told you you got to have your own
[10:28] personal revelation for yourself and you
[10:30] come like like Cain did Cain was just
[10:33] coming with the best he knew how but but
[10:36] he was missing that that uh the the
[10:39] Revelation now in Hebrews chapter 9 it
[10:42] says how much more shall the blood of
[10:44] Christ who through the
[10:46] eternal spirit offered himself without
[10:47] spot to God Purge your conscience from
[10:50] dead Works to serve the Living God now
[10:52] we a couple of chapters ago we study
[10:54] that out and we we began to realize that
[10:56] God wants us to to not just serve him in
[10:59] this form like Cain was doing he wants
[11:01] to purge our conscience from dead work
[11:03] dead what is dead Works dead works is
[11:05] when you're just coming to church and
[11:07] you're going through the motions without
[11:08] Revelation but you're trying to do it by
[11:10] works by because you see other people
[11:12] that are paying their tithes and their
[11:14] their you know Paving the parking lot or
[11:16] doing things baking cookies and doing
[11:19] all the things that church people do
[11:21] but without a revelation see the
[11:23] Revelation is what brings the thing to
[11:25] life Revelation is what allows you to
[11:27] serve a living God a living God that
[11:29] will come down and recognize your faith
[11:31] like he recognized Abels that will
[11:33] recognize your faith like he recognize
[11:35] Noah's faith that when Noah believed him
[11:37] the flood came and the rain began to
[11:39] fall and he when Enoch believed that he
[11:41] he got a body change he he he left the
[11:44] Earth because when you believe God
[11:47] you're suffering a living God a living
[11:49] reality not just going through some kind
[11:51] of dead Works where you're just trying
[11:52] to work something up serving him by a
[11:54] mental there's the difference between
[11:56] Cain and Abel a mental understanding an
[11:59] intellectual understanding and a
[12:01] revelation and wrote what is revelation
[12:02] Revelation ties you to something Eternal
[12:05] it is a substance it's something that
[12:07] you can hang everything on that nobody's
[12:09] going to take away from you so something
[12:11] that uh it is it it is something where
[12:15] God's going to come and back it up like
[12:17] he backed up what Abel believed when
[12:20] Abel believed God God came down on the
[12:22] scene and consumed that Sacrifice by
[12:25] fire and you you reckon you you come to
[12:27] God with that same kind of faith and
[12:29] he'll come and fill you with the Holy
[12:30] Ghost and Fire he'll he'll recognize
[12:33] your sacrifice your faith the same way
[12:35] that he recognized Abel's Faith so now
[12:38] you've got those two what the two
[12:40] differences that the tree of knowledge
[12:41] is full of full of like mental
[12:43] understanding education that's why I
[12:45] think brother Brown was so against
[12:46] education not education like um you
[12:50] gotta you when you gotta have if you're
[12:52] gonna have a job you got to be educated
[12:53] at least enough to be able to if you to
[12:55] know how to swing a hammer and nail a
[12:58] nail or uh you know put wires together
[13:00] if you're wiring a house not in that
[13:02] kind of education but when we come
[13:03] together and we just get so educated to
[13:05] where we we think we know a lot it's
[13:07] just mental and that begins to take you
[13:09] away from God but a real Revelation is
[13:12] the thing that ties us back to God where
[13:14] God can work through our lives that's
[13:17] the difference education and Revelation
[13:19] see God brother Brown was never against
[13:21] you knowing something and being being
[13:23] able to provide for your family being
[13:25] able to provide but but when education
[13:27] takes you away from God where you just
[13:29] start you just start getting built up in
[13:31] what you know and and uh you can get you
[13:35] know like a doctor can get so educated
[13:37] where they think they understand how
[13:38] everything works and how your body works
[13:40] and they you know what education will
[13:42] not tell you about education can tell
[13:44] you about how trees work and how uh all
[13:47] the different components of your body
[13:49] and things but one thing education will
[13:51] never be able to tell you about is life
[13:53] brother Adam said you can go out and
[13:55] look at the grass growing in the field
[13:56] and that you can look and figure out all
[13:58] the chlorophyll and all that stuff but
[14:00] one thing science will never be able to
[14:02] tell you is how life came in that piece
[14:04] of grass you see that's what the gospel
[14:07] is for that's that's what Abel's
[14:08] Revelation was really about life that
[14:11] when they hear that they were they were
[14:13] they were they had to leave the Garden
[14:15] of Eden because life got messed up they
[14:17] came he was born the wrong way and the
[14:19] way back was through life the shed blood
[14:22] of an animal the shed blood of Christ
[14:24] that's the way back is through the life
[14:26] of God and the believer
[14:29] that's that's what makes the difference
[14:31] in life God's life is
[14:33] God's life is his rep
[14:36] and God Reveals His word to you that's
[14:38] the life of God coming in your life and
[14:41] and showing himself to you and revealing
[14:43] himself to you to so that it makes his
[14:46] life living in you there's a difference
[14:49] now uh
[14:51] I don't meet the preach this morning let
[14:53] me get I'm gonna get carried away
[14:56] God hiding himself in Simplicity then
[14:59] revealing himself in the same brother
[15:00] around said notice he built this Altar
[15:02] and he's more like put flowers and fix
[15:04] it up and put beautiful trees and
[15:06] thought surely a great holy clean
[15:08] beautiful God will accept that sacrifice
[15:11] what's the requirement for God to accept
[15:13] your sacrifice this morning God wants to
[15:16] see your faith God almost don't want to
[15:18] see your dead works and just coming to
[15:19] church and living out trying to work
[15:21] something up and make it happen God
[15:23] wants to see your faith in God's word
[15:25] but see he done it with his own wisdom
[15:27] he'd done it by his own thoughts and
[15:29] that's what it is today to do it by
[15:31] their own wisdom by their schooling by
[15:34] their education and ethics that they
[15:37] have learned
[15:38] but Abel by a revelation by faith
[15:41] offered unto God a more excellent
[15:43] sacrifice
[15:45] nothing clean about it as far as it
[15:46] looked humanly speaking the little fella
[15:48] and grabbed him by the neck and wrapping
[15:50] a Vine around him like that and pulled
[15:51] him along to this altar there was
[15:53] nothing so beautiful about it laying him
[15:55] upon the Altar and hacking his little
[15:57] throat with a sharp rock until his blood
[15:59] flying all over him bleeding dying it
[16:02] was a horrible sight to see it it's a
[16:04] horrible it was a horrible sight when
[16:05] Jesus died on the cross and it'll be a
[16:07] horrible sight when you die to your own
[16:10] self because whenever life comes when
[16:13] life was given on the cross it was a
[16:14] horrible sight and when life comes into
[16:16] you it'll be a horrible sight laying on
[16:18] the floor snotting and crying out to God
[16:20] when God fuels you with his life it's a
[16:23] horrible sight because you're dying out
[16:25] to yourself oh that's what God wants you
[16:27] don't want this dead works but he wants
[16:29] a living reality in the life of the
[16:31] Believers and he said it was simple it
[16:33] was simple though it's Simplicity he
[16:36] know that he was born of his mother and
[16:38] father's blood
[16:39] there's Abel's Revelation if you want to
[16:42] ask this morning what what did Abel see
[16:44] he'd know that he was born of his mother
[16:47] and father's blood his mother and
[16:50] father's life and there's the problem
[16:53] born in his mother's Blood by his
[16:56] father's blood and it was blood that
[16:59] caused the fall so it was blood that
[17:02] would take it back
[17:04] what's Abel's Revelation life
[17:07] life is in the blood he come by the
[17:10] wrong life he come by the wrong way and
[17:12] it would take it would take life to
[17:14] bring him back it was blood that would
[17:16] take it back so he offered unto God a
[17:18] more excellent sacrifice because it was
[17:21] revealed to him
[17:23] oh you see when it's revealed Revelation
[17:26] takes you beyond anything and all the
[17:28] education you can come to church and how
[17:30] many times maybe you've heard somebody
[17:32] preach a real great sermon about Daniel
[17:33] 70 weeks or just just some something
[17:35] that would you know somebody was telling
[17:38] me about somebody that preached A good
[17:39] sermon and then they went off into the
[17:40] world and things because you can you can
[17:42] have a good education of something but
[17:44] it not be revealed Revelation goes
[17:47] beyond the education because it
[17:49] communicates the essence of it to you
[17:51] Revelation is something it's It's
[17:54] Supernatural Revelation is not something
[17:57] that somebody taught to you that
[17:58] somebody educated into you but it's a
[18:01] supernatural thing that God has given to
[18:03] you a supernatural understanding of his
[18:05] word
[18:08] brother random said how did Abel know
[18:10] what to do
[18:11] in order to offer a proper sacrifice to
[18:14] God by faith he received the revelation
[18:17] of the blood
[18:19] of the blood
[18:21] Cain didn't get such a revelation even
[18:23] though he had a commandment he had all
[18:25] the education he had the Commandment
[18:28] so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[18:30] it was a revelation from God that made
[18:33] the difference and gave Abel eternal
[18:35] life
[18:36] now you might take what the pastor says
[18:39] but what the Seminary teaches and though
[18:42] it might be taught to you with eloquence
[18:44] until God reveals to you that Jesus is
[18:47] the Christ and that it is the blood that
[18:50] cleanses you and that God is your savior
[18:52] you will never have eternal life it is
[18:56] the spiritual Revelation that does it oh
[18:59] you see why Revelation is the most
[19:01] important what God reveals to you that
[19:02] you're born again ain't nothing
[19:04] difficult to say take that away from you
[19:06] when God reveals to you the the right
[19:09] way to be baptized what God reveals to
[19:11] you that godhead when God Reveals All
[19:14] these things to you it's something that
[19:16] it's it's not an education it's beyond
[19:18] that because it's supernatural a
[19:21] supernatural gift from God
[19:23] and wisdom versus Faith he said now
[19:25] notice by faith Abel saw the Revelation
[19:28] the vision and brought a living running
[19:31] blood because life was in the blood I I
[19:35] want you to get this morning what Abel's
[19:37] Revelation was his Revelation was life
[19:40] a living running blood it couldn't be
[19:43] just some some animal that had been
[19:44] laying out there for for a week decaying
[19:47] but life is in the blood it had to be a
[19:49] living animal that he cut that animal's
[19:51] throat and that blood run down bleeding
[19:54] and everything life is in the stem of
[19:57] the flower and it's botany life which
[19:58] has no feeling I was in hopes that was
[20:01] sinking and Able by faith staying with
[20:03] the word by faith not wisdom by faith
[20:06] he's seen that it was sex blood the
[20:10] blood cell comes from the male the male
[20:12] the man has the blood cell and the sperm
[20:14] the hemoglobin is the blood comes
[20:16] through the male and Adam noted it
[20:18] wasn't apples and peaches and potatoes
[20:20] or whatever it was that brought them out
[20:22] of the Garden of Eden that caused the
[20:23] sin it was sex blood and he offered
[20:27] blood back by faith he done it not by
[20:30] wisdom
[20:32] how is a man through wisdom going to
[20:34] understand it when the whole Bible and
[20:37] the whole Church of God is built upon
[20:39] divine revelation absolutely by faith
[20:43] let me just read some quotes but we've
[20:45] got five more minutes to just kind of
[20:46] close and just kind of uh
[20:49] move into move into this thought he in
[20:51] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[20:53] and forever he said the germ of life
[20:56] life
[20:57] is what we're talking about to the child
[21:00] come from the male sex we know that
[21:01] don't we it's like a hen can lay an egg
[21:03] but if she hasn't been with a male bird
[21:05] it's not fertile see it won't hatch The
[21:07] Germ of Life comes from the male and God
[21:10] making his promise the life germ lays in
[21:12] the male's blood the male sex produces
[21:15] the life you realize that the female has
[21:17] nothing to do with it no more than the
[21:19] incubator but it's the man the male
[21:23] the sperm the life is in the mail I I
[21:26] hope we're this morning we're looking at
[21:28] pattern you can see that pattern
[21:29] everywhere you can get real educated in
[21:32] the message you can get real educated
[21:34] have a good education but if the life if
[21:38] God doesn't come and Quicken that to you
[21:40] then it's just going to be dead you got
[21:42] to you've got to be with Christ and for
[21:44] second Corinthians it says who also has
[21:46] made us able Ministers of the New
[21:48] Testament not of the letter
[21:50] but of the spirit not just a good
[21:52] education but of the of spirit of life
[21:55] we got to have life life is the thing
[21:57] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[21:59] giveth life so life what are we talking
[22:03] about I'm talking about Abel's
[22:04] Revelation this morning a revelation of
[22:06] life
[22:08] we got five more minutes
[22:10] y'all get your naps out in five minutes
[22:13] [Laughter]
[22:16] now there's the difference there's a
[22:18] difference between Abel and Cain Cain
[22:21] coming with just a carnal fleshly
[22:23] understanding because he'd been educated
[22:25] educated well and here come Abel with a
[22:29] it looked like just a dirty blood
[22:32] running down a gory nasty nasty kind of
[22:35] religion the kind of religion where
[22:37] people shout and people want to praise
[22:39] God and it just looks it just looks
[22:41] nasty to the world it looks it looks
[22:43] horrible somebody somebody at the altar
[22:45] dying and crying out to themselves
[22:47] people coming up because they want to be
[22:49] saved they want to be changed see that's
[22:52] what we believe in this morning is a
[22:53] religion a gospel that will change you
[22:56] and not leave you not leave you just
[22:58] serving a god based on dead works not
[23:00] just trying to work something up but a
[23:01] God that will change you this morning
[23:04] by the Revelation by the revealing of
[23:07] his word of the shed blood for an Adam
[23:08] all die you've been born wrong
[23:11] even so in Christ shall all be made
[23:13] alive how by his blood by the blood that
[23:15] he shed for us to release his life on
[23:18] the cross that that same life could come
[23:20] back and live in you
[23:23] now Abel's Revelation was based in in
[23:26] Genesis chapter 2 it says in the Lord
[23:28] God commanded the man saying of every
[23:30] tree of the garden thou mayest free to
[23:31] eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good
[23:34] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[23:36] the day that thou eatst thereof Thou
[23:39] shalt surely die
[23:41] I I think Sunday school sometimes is a
[23:43] good opportunity to just kind of back up
[23:45] a second and let's examine what we
[23:47] believe
[23:48] so let's back up a second and look at
[23:49] what Abel was believing in the last two
[23:51] or three minutes here
[23:54] and y'all I ain't gonna finish I will
[23:55] we'll we'll continue on this home for
[23:58] the next time
[23:59] what was let me skip over that and go
[24:01] back in Genesis chapter 3 it said the
[24:03] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[24:05] thou has done this Thou Art cursed above
[24:07] all cattle and above every beast of the
[24:10] field because they ate from the Tree of
[24:12] knowledge of Good and Evil did what God
[24:14] Said
[24:15] uh he's cursing the serpent for what
[24:18] what uh the serpent did the lie that he
[24:20] told Eve upon thy belly that shalt thou
[24:22] go and thus shalt thou eat all the days
[24:24] of our life now now let's let's just
[24:26] examine that for a second we can tell
[24:28] here that the serpent first of all his
[24:29] first condition was he was not on his
[24:32] belly crawling around so there you can
[24:34] see let's let's paint a picture in our
[24:35] mind now now he he's a serpent is a he's
[24:38] a beast that he can talk and he can
[24:40] converse with somebody I hope we can
[24:42] read between the lines here and at least
[24:43] see that much that the sir it says
[24:45] serpent but he his first condition was
[24:48] not on the ground and then he got cursed
[24:50] and now he's on the ground
[24:52] so that paints a picture for us that he
[24:54] was in some kind of condition where an
[24:56] upright condition where he could talk to
[24:59] Eve and tell her things and then he got
[25:01] changed into something where he's on the
[25:03] ground crawling around and I'll put
[25:05] enmity between thee and the woman he's
[25:07] this is speaking of Christ and between
[25:08] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[25:11] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heal
[25:12] and that what Christ did on the cross
[25:15] between thy seed and her seed so the the
[25:17] serpent has a seed and there's another
[25:19] and the woman has a seed now if we can
[25:22] get a picture in our mind of what those
[25:23] two things are we can get a we can start
[25:25] to get an understanding of what Abel saw
[25:27] what gave faith faith to Abel
[25:30] and we're certainly not going to finish
[25:32] that in two minutes
[25:34] in proverbs 30 it says such as the way
[25:37] of an adulterous woman she eats and
[25:39] wipeth her mouth and saith I have done
[25:41] no wickedness
[25:43] I'm hopping around through slides let's
[25:45] go back let's the serpent see brother
[25:47] Adam said what was the seed of the
[25:49] serpent the seed of the serpent was
[25:51] adultery you follow it adultery with he
[25:54] what's adultery now Spirit you got
[25:55] spiritual adultery
[25:58] I'm gonna have to come to a screech and
[26:00] stop
[26:03] we're gonna stop there and we'll finish
[26:05] next time
[26:06] always at war with the clock
[26:10] [Applause]
[26:49] thank you
