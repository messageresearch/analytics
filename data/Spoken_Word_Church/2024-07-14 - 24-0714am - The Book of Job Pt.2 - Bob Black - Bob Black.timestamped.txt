[0:12] God bless you and good morning
[0:18] morning let's turn to the The Book of
[0:20] Job again and and let's just read our
[0:23] scripture from verse 20 to
[0:27] 22 Lord God we're so grateful to be able
[0:30] to gather around your word this morning
[0:32] and I I pray Lord that these words Lord
[0:35] will be helpful to to as we as we study
[0:37] these things out Lord help us Lord as we
[0:39] navigate these scriptures Lord God to
[0:41] guide us through them Lord Jesus and
[0:43] Quicken them to our hearts I pray Lord
[0:45] that you'll prepare our hearts for
[0:47] what's in store for us today Lord God as
[0:49] we meditate upon your words Grant it
[0:51] Lord that you'll be with us now we pray
[0:53] in your
[0:54] name so we've been studying started
[0:57] studying The Book of Job the most
[1:00] depressing book in the Bible and it's
[1:03] funny how the most depressing book maybe
[1:04] can give you encouragement in time of
[1:07] trouble and um you know the the reason
[1:12] um I think why this book is so helpful
[1:15] is because it frames our thinking up in
[1:18] the way you know we we wonder why things
[1:21] are the way they are and are the things
[1:23] that I'm going through are they normal
[1:26] and this book kind of uh helps us to
[1:29] understand understand that when we're
[1:31] going through rough times it is normal
[1:35] it's normal it's part of it's part of
[1:37] life suffering and trials and things and
[1:40] and uh and a lot of times God will allow
[1:43] things to happen to us so that we can he
[1:47] can see our reaction and so we can see
[1:48] our reaction and look at job's reaction
[1:52] here in verse 20 where it says then job
[1:55] arose after all these things befell him
[1:57] and chapter one then job arose and in
[2:00] his mantle and shaved his
[2:03] head and fell down upon the ground and
[2:07] worshiped and said naked came I out of
[2:09] my mother's womb and naked shall I
[2:12] return thither the lord gave and the
[2:16] Lord hath taken away blessed be the name
[2:19] of the Lord in all this job sinned not
[2:22] nor charged God foolishly now what a
[2:26] what a reaction there you can see uh a
[2:29] lot of strange things happening here in
[2:31] his reaction he's of course he's G
[2:33] Grievous he's grieving and after all the
[2:36] things that befell him you that's that's
[2:38] a totally normal reaction and then he
[2:41] worshiped God which is a strange
[2:44] reaction and we'll get to that a little
[2:46] bit later but um he he said basically
[2:50] what he's saying here is that everything
[2:51] I got God gave me God gave it to me it's
[2:54] his right to take it away now that's
[2:56] framing up the a mature reaction to
[2:59] things that happen in your life it's
[3:01] it's God no matter what what happens to
[3:03] me I'm trusting God regardless the lord
[3:06] gave me everything that I've got is is
[3:09] he he's the one that give it to me and
[3:11] if he takes it away from me then blessed
[3:13] be the name of the Lord amen now think
[3:16] about that kind of reaction something
[3:19] horrible like that befil him I I was I
[3:22] was talking to my wife the other day you
[3:24] think if God took away one of your
[3:25] children that would be devastating but
[3:27] he took away all of his children if God
[3:30] took away your livelihood that would be
[3:31] devastating he took away all of his
[3:34] camels all of his everything everything
[3:38] was gone and he still in that moment
[3:41] could say the lord gave the Lord can
[3:44] take away blessed be the name of the
[3:46] Lord amen and all this job s not nor
[3:49] charge God
[3:51] foolishly so the Book of Job what doing
[3:54] is framing up our understanding of how
[3:56] God runs the world and as well what
[3:59] later on we'll get into the all his
[4:01] friends coming and telling him their
[4:04] their different perspectives which were
[4:06] all wrong and and that's how we we look
[4:09] at things that are happening in our life
[4:10] and we've got our own perspective of
[4:12] things how how things really are and and
[4:14] many times it's wrong so job is helping
[4:17] us to frame it up so that we look at
[4:19] things the right way and at at the end
[4:22] you'll see God God's telling job were do
[4:25] do you know how the world was framed up
[4:27] do you know how the Stars like we we
[4:29] come with with our little puny
[4:30] conception of how things really are and
[4:33] there's a greater purpose and a greater
[4:35] understanding if we could really see
[4:36] things from the way God's looking at it
[4:38] we'd look at things different so that's
[4:41] what job is trying to Frank it help us
[4:43] to understand why things are the way
[4:45] they are and one one thing that we can
[4:47] look at is in Job chapter 14 that I read
[4:51] last Sunday man that is born of a woman
[4:53] is a few days and full of trouble so
[4:57] life that means life is full of suff
[4:59] suffering what can we get out of that
[5:02] scripture that life because life is full
[5:05] of suffering suffering does not
[5:07] automatically mean that you are not a
[5:11] Christian or that you are a secret
[5:13] sinner or
[5:14] something I said that's what job's all
[5:17] of his friends were they just leap to
[5:19] the conclusion you're going through a
[5:21] bad spot in life there must be something
[5:23] wrong in your life and job kept going
[5:26] back I've done everything right I've
[5:27] done I've done everything that I know
[5:29] that I can do so it it normalizes
[5:31] suffering this this this perspective
[5:34] normalizes you're going through a rough
[5:36] time you know somebody loses their job
[5:39] or uh loses a loved one or these are
[5:43] things that are normal to happen and and
[5:46] like Psalm chapter 90 David David tells
[5:48] us the days of our years or three score
[5:52] years and
[5:53] 10 and if by reason of strength they be
[5:56] four score Years yet is their strength
[5:59] lay labor and sorrow for it is soon cut
[6:03] off and we fly away now you look back
[6:07] many of us look back on all of our Liv
[6:09] all of our years and it's a lot there's
[6:11] a lot of sorrow and sadness and a lot of
[6:14] things what we're in this sin condition
[6:18] and and and that's that's part of life
[6:21] that there's a lot of a lot of bad
[6:23] things there's a lot of good things but
[6:24] there's a lot of bad too
[6:26] Ecclesiastes Solomon said for what hath
[6:28] a man of all all his labor and of the
[6:31] vexation of his heart wherein he ha
[6:34] labored Under the Sun for all his days
[6:37] are sorrows and his travail grief yay
[6:41] his heart taketh not rest in the night
[6:44] this is also
[6:46] vanity Solomon wisest man on Earth his
[6:50] heart taketh not rest in the night in
[6:53] Psalm 939 David said behold thou has
[6:56] made my days as in hand breath in my age
[7:00] is as nothing before theee verily every
[7:03] man at his best date is all together
[7:06] vanity Amen in Psalm 103 David said as
[7:11] for man his days are his grass as a
[7:14] flower of the field so he flourisheth
[7:18] for the wind passeth over it and it is
[7:20] gone and the place thereof shall know it
[7:25] no
[7:26] more that's a sad thought and I I look I
[7:29] watch my neighbor he he labored he built
[7:31] this this big workshop and all these
[7:33] kind of things and then then the bank
[7:36] foreclosed on him took it all away and
[7:37] somebody else moved in and and uh now
[7:39] they own that property and all that
[7:41] labor it it's that's sorrowful to think
[7:44] about I I I watched my my uh my
[7:47] grandparents when before they died they
[7:49] they labored and built this nice house
[7:52] and and had a beautiful garden and a
[7:54] spring in the backyard and all these
[7:56] kind of things and then then they died
[7:57] and somebody else moved in and and just
[7:59] trash the place and and it that's
[8:01] sorrowful well here we have no
[8:04] continuing City we're not living for
[8:05] this life we're looking for a city whose
[8:08] Builder and maker is God that's right so
[8:10] we're looking for the end the end of the
[8:12] story is Christ this is not where we're
[8:14] building up our Treasures but we're
[8:16] storing up our Treasures in Heaven
[8:18] that's that's where our heart is right
[8:21] and and you think job why why would all
[8:24] these things happen to job job the the
[8:27] frame up the story job was doing
[8:29] everything everything right he was
[8:31] righteous and that means he was matching
[8:34] up his life was matching up with the
[8:36] standard that God had laid out for him
[8:37] he was doing everything right so in job
[8:40] 1:1 it says there was a
[8:43] man in the land of oo us whose name was
[8:47] job and that man was
[8:49] perfect and upright and one that feared
[8:52] God and issued
[8:54] evil now perfect means he was he was
[8:57] blameless or he he had Integrity he was
[9:00] he was living right he was doing right
[9:02] he was walking right everything he he
[9:05] was trying to dot every eye and cross
[9:07] every tea and just live live life
[9:10] anytime you make a mistake go offer the
[9:12] sacrifice and and it says he was upright
[9:15] so that means he was living a just and
[9:17] honest life now the reason the Bible
[9:20] belabors this point is because you you
[9:23] contrast that with all these things
[9:25] happening to him well there's got to be
[9:27] a reason why and it wasn't because he
[9:30] was doing something wrong it says that
[9:32] he feared God he had reverence and
[9:35] respect for
[9:37] God he assed evil he was constantly
[9:40] turning away from and avoiding evil now
[9:44] Ezekiel spoke so highly of job if you
[9:47] read in Ezekiel chapter 14 that it
[9:49] compared job to job's right
[9:51] righteousness to Daniel and Noah so job
[9:55] was living a righteous kind of
[9:57] life and a righteous not life life is
[9:59] not an easy life in Psalm 34 it says
[10:03] many are the afflictions of the
[10:05] righteous but the Lord delivereth him
[10:07] out of them
[10:10] all in Matthew Chapter 5 Jesus said
[10:13] blessed are they which are persecuted
[10:15] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[10:18] kingdom of
[10:19] heaven and first Peter it says but if
[10:22] you suffer for righteousness sake happy
[10:25] are ye and be not afraid of their Terror
[10:28] neither be trouble and second Timothy
[10:31] says yay and all that will live Godly in
[10:34] Christ Jesus shall
[10:36] suffer
[10:37] persecution so suffering is going to
[10:41] come with righteous a righteous
[10:43] life and we read that quote last time in
[10:46] the message the ark where brother R said
[10:48] you might be sick for a little
[10:50] while you may have to go through
[10:52] something for a little B while but
[10:55] remember Christ is at the
[10:57] end he never said this Ark will set in a
[11:00] little Whirlpool where there'll be no
[11:02] calm just as calm as it can be he never
[11:05] carried a flower bread of ease he never
[11:08] promised things easy but he promised
[11:12] Grace to sustain you in the time so he
[11:17] never promised that life would be easy
[11:20] there's plenty of promises that life is
[11:21] going to be hard that you go through
[11:24] times where you just wonder almost if
[11:25] you can bear the the suffering and the
[11:27] agony and so that's if we frame it ight
[11:31] if frame up our perspective that we can
[11:33] see that there is really no promise that
[11:36] suffering will always be at a manageable
[11:39] level right now that's that's if we look
[11:43] sometimes uh you look at you look at
[11:45] situations and you just wonder how you
[11:47] can cope with it it seems like it's just
[11:49] washing over you like a wave and you
[11:51] just can't you just can't bear it and I
[11:54] think sometimes we we've we we've come
[11:57] to look at suffering it with a skewed
[12:00] interpretation of scripture because like
[12:03] 1 Corinthians chap 10: 13 is often
[12:07] misquoted if I if I was going to read
[12:09] that real quick it says there hath no
[12:11] temptation taken you but such is common
[12:15] demand but God is faithful who will not
[12:18] suffer you to be tempted above that ye
[12:22] are able but will with the Temptation
[12:25] also make a way to escape that ye may be
[12:29] be able to Bear it right amen now what's
[12:32] that mean brother R he preached a sermon
[12:35] about this that that God will if if if
[12:37] let's say if you're if you're a drunkard
[12:40] there's a way of Escape out of being a
[12:42] drunker and that way is Christ if you're
[12:45] a sinner there's a way of Escape there
[12:48] is a way of Escape out of the Temptation
[12:51] and God won't give you a Temptation that
[12:53] there's not a way to get out of it but
[12:57] this is speaking of Temptation not
[12:59] suffering and life life bearing down on
[13:01] you so hard where it seems sometimes
[13:04] like you just can't bear it there's not
[13:07] a promise where he won't give you so
[13:09] much that so much that you just can't
[13:11] handle it cuz sometimes you got to turn
[13:13] it over to God many times you got to
[13:16] turn it over to God I was reading this
[13:18] morning where brother Brandon was
[13:20] talking about
[13:21] um he he he was telling his life story
[13:25] of how he watched his wife and little
[13:27] Sharon Rose die and and then it just
[13:29] became so unbearable till he got to that
[13:32] place where he reached up and grabbed
[13:33] the power line but God come on the scene
[13:36] and raised him up and then he said he
[13:38] said I was sitting there after that
[13:39] after that happened this is a born again
[13:41] Christian he he was sitting there in his
[13:43] home and he got a letter in the mail and
[13:45] it was addressed to Miss Sharon Rose
[13:48] brandom and he said that just pushed him
[13:50] over the edge now see sometimes things
[13:53] in life get to where you just you just
[13:55] feel like you can't handle it you can't
[13:57] bear it and that pushed him over the
[13:59] edge and he grabbed his gun he went out
[14:03] I guess he was in the woods or somewhere
[14:04] grabbed his gun pulled his gun up to his
[14:06] head and he said I I was delirious I
[14:09] couldn't I couldn't deal with it pull
[14:10] the trigger and it wasn't him that saved
[14:13] him it was God that Sav him see sometime
[14:16] we get to the place where we just can't
[14:18] deal with it anymore and that's when you
[14:20] got to turn it over to God when you
[14:23] can't bear it anymore you turn it over
[14:25] to God and he's the one that will come
[14:27] on the scene and will bear it amen so we
[14:29] look at First Corinthians chapter 10
[14:31] that's about Temptation and temptation
[14:34] is about your choices God's not going to
[14:37] give you put you to to a place where
[14:38] there's not a way of Escape where you
[14:40] can't make the right choice but
[14:43] suffering is a different category from
[14:45] your choices suffering and life and and
[14:48] thing you know I I I was thinking this
[14:50] morning about when Esther was born I'd
[14:53] got laid off from my job and I was
[14:56] watching her being born and I didn't I
[14:57] was my insurance was about to run out
[14:59] and you you feel like you actually when
[15:01] you get in a place of pressure you
[15:03] actually feel like that there's a weight
[15:06] a literal weight on you and you you
[15:09] you're thinking you know what what am I
[15:11] going to do I I can't I can't just run
[15:14] out and go get a job or
[15:16] something you know you I call the
[15:18] recruiters and they they wouldn't even
[15:19] answer during that time and I it was
[15:21] around uh uh 20 years ago or whatever
[15:25] where there was a market uh crash and
[15:27] there were no jobs available
[15:29] and and you get to a place where you
[15:30] feel that weight what are you going to
[15:32] do and and you God brings you to those
[15:34] places what are you going to do you
[15:36] can't bear it you can't do it there's
[15:38] nothing within yourself so what you got
[15:39] to do is turn it over to God turn it
[15:42] over to God and let him bear your burden
[15:45] now Temptation temptation is a desire or
[15:49] urge to do something especially
[15:51] something unwise or wrong but suffering
[15:53] now this suffering is a different
[15:55] category it's a state of undergoing pain
[15:58] or distress or hardship and it's often
[16:02] suffering sometimes is unavoidable it's
[16:05] just part of The Human Condition it's
[16:08] just part of living and now that's the
[16:10] story of job that is framing up
[16:12] sometimes things just happen in life
[16:15] that doesn't have anything to do with
[16:17] whether you're righteous or unrighteous
[16:19] it's just part of living or part of God
[16:22] just pulling the Hedge back to see What
[16:24] You're Made Of to allow things to happen
[16:26] to you to mold your character and it has
[16:29] nothing to do with whether you're right
[16:30] or wrong it's just it's just part of
[16:33] life like like losing your job or or
[16:37] losing a loved one or things things just
[16:41] happening that befall everybody that
[16:43] just happen to everybody it's just part
[16:45] of life yes so there's no promise now
[16:48] that God won't allow overwhelming
[16:51] suffering overwhelming suffering now now
[16:54] think about that in the in I I was
[16:56] reading through all these stories of the
[16:58] uh
[17:00] uh I'm trying to remember the name of
[17:02] the the Christian ladies um that were
[17:05] martyred that were actually there was a
[17:07] a Christian lady in the uh third Century
[17:10] ad that they they grabbed her and she
[17:12] had a little woman that worked with her
[17:14] and they they they they arrested him and
[17:16] this little woman her name was
[17:18] Felicity and she was pregnant and they
[17:21] grabbed her and threw her into the uh
[17:23] the prison of the Coliseum and she was
[17:25] pregnant at 8 months and and because of
[17:28] of her Christian stand I'm talking about
[17:30] suffering now suffer that you would
[17:32] think that God want not allow
[17:34] overwhelming suffer suffering she was
[17:37] pregnant at 8 months and they grabbed
[17:38] her she gave birth in prison right a
[17:41] month before she died in the Roman
[17:43] Coliseum there's a lot of things that
[17:45] have happened through life uh Paul
[17:47] getting his head chopped off and being
[17:49] dragged to Rome and Peter being
[17:50] crucified upside down and the the saints
[17:53] that that had uh Li hung upside down and
[17:55] have salt shoved in their nose to and
[17:58] tortured tortured and unimaginable
[18:00] torture see it seems like those were
[18:03] those were unbearable things but God was
[18:06] on the SC
[18:08] Amen in 2 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul
[18:11] said speaking of very unbearable
[18:14] suffering he said we would not Brethren
[18:17] have you ignorant of our trouble which
[18:19] came to us in Asia that we were pressed
[18:22] out of
[18:24] measure out of measure means it was
[18:26] beyond our our tolerance above strength
[18:30] in so much that we despaired even of
[18:33] life but we had the sentence of death in
[18:36] ourselves that we should not trust in
[18:38] ourselves see when you get to a place
[18:40] where you just can't bear it no more oh
[18:43] that's when you put all your trust in
[18:45] God when you maybe reach over to the
[18:47] side of your bed and your loved one's
[18:49] not there anymore or you you you're you
[18:52] you you wish that maybe you could do
[18:54] things over again and you just can't
[18:56] bear it no more and it seems like the
[18:58] waves of suffering are just crashing
[18:59] down over you put it put it in God's
[19:01] hands turn to him and say God I need you
[19:04] to help me and he'll help you like like
[19:06] he helped brother Brandon when he
[19:07] stopped that bullet stopped the gun from
[19:10] firing he helped him when when he
[19:13] reached up and grabbed the power line
[19:15] and it was beyond anything that he could
[19:17] do so Paul said that we should not trust
[19:20] in ourselves but in God which raiseth
[19:23] the Dead who delivered us from so great
[19:25] a death and doth deliver and whom whom
[19:29] we trust that he will yet Deliver Us
[19:32] yes Psalm 34 like we just read many are
[19:36] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[19:38] Lord
[19:43] deliverthat me in the day of trouble I
[19:46] will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify
[19:49] me in Philippians chapter 4 says I can
[19:53] do all things through Christ which
[19:55] strengtheneth me amen now see there is
[19:58] when you're framing it up the right way
[20:00] you're not trusting in your own ability
[20:02] you're not trusting in your own self but
[20:05] you're trusting in the god
[20:07] that he's the one that makes a way he's
[20:11] the one that rose on Easter Sunday and
[20:13] he's the one that gives us strength in
[20:15] the time of
[20:17] adversity and there will be times of
[20:19] adversities yes you think about all
[20:21] these stories that are laid out in the
[20:23] scripture of Christians and Believers
[20:25] that faced tremendous adversities like
[20:27] job that lost everything and Joseph that
[20:30] was thrown into prison by his own
[20:32] brothers and Daniel that got thrown in
[20:35] the Lion's Den and Shadrach mesach and
[20:38] Abednego and John the Baptist thrown
[20:40] into prison and then cut his they cut
[20:42] his head off and Stever that was
[20:44] stoned those all seemed like unbearable
[20:48] suffering to be stoned to be rocks
[20:51] thrown at you till your heads cracked
[20:53] open and you're laying there in the
[20:55] street looking up at the Sun as your
[20:58] life Le you Paul was beat in prison
[21:01] Shipwrecked constant danger Peter was
[21:04] crucified upside down all the early
[21:06] Christian Martyrs that were crucified in
[21:09] Roman Arenas polycarp that was burned at
[21:11] the
[21:12] stake Joon of art William tendale John
[21:16] bunan thrown into prison for 12 years
[21:19] for preaching without being sanctioned
[21:21] by the church and on and on so Christian
[21:24] scripture emphasizes that God's God's
[21:26] going to be there with us during SU
[21:28] suffering but it doesn't promise that
[21:31] our suffering is always going to be
[21:33] manageable by our own abilities that's
[21:36] right God might allow life to bring us
[21:39] to our knees so that we can learn to
[21:41] trust
[21:44] him you know that's I think that's when
[21:46] our character is really shaped when it's
[21:49] really shaped when you're maybe maybe
[21:51] curled up in the shower in the morning
[21:53] in an Agony because there's mental
[21:55] problems and mental battle that's what
[21:57] most of the jok was about the mental
[21:59] problems first the first chapter is
[22:02] everything Stripped Away the second
[22:03] chapter is he he doesn't have his health
[22:06] anymore and then the following chapters
[22:07] it's mental anguish and battles and
[22:09] things and that's when that's when in
[22:11] that in that in The Crucible of life
[22:14] when your character really begins to be
[22:16] shaped God allows us to go through these
[22:18] things sometimes to validate and
[22:21] effectively mold our character to
[22:24] validate our character you go through a
[22:27] place in life where you you you get
[22:29] tested and it validates that you really
[22:32] have the goods it validates that you
[22:35] really trust
[22:37] God brother Ram would compare that to a
[22:40] uh he he'd call it a
[22:43] Capa and in one place he said there's a
[22:46] a Capa is like this big giant furnace
[22:49] thing where they would make they would
[22:51] make
[22:52] uh fashion something out of uh you know
[22:55] metal and and if they get all the
[22:57] ingredients right
[22:59] and like if they're making a bail they'
[23:01] get have this big F uh this big Capa
[23:04] where they're molding something in it
[23:05] and they're molding a in the story
[23:07] brother random told a baale and if they
[23:10] can get all the ingredients right and
[23:11] get the fire real nice and hot when they
[23:14] pull that that uh the bail out of the
[23:17] Capa then it would ring right and see
[23:21] that's what our life is sometimes the
[23:23] things that we go through in life where
[23:25] the Fire gets real hot and if all the
[23:27] ingredients are just right right after
[23:29] it's tested after it gets pulled out of
[23:30] the Capa the big Capa and then they
[23:34] strike it and it'll ring just right now
[23:37] that's what we want we want to be pulled
[23:39] out of the fire and God canest us and
[23:41] and if you ring right you'll do like job
[23:43] and you'll say no l no matter what
[23:46] happens I'm still trusting you're not
[23:48] trusting him to get something you're not
[23:51] trusting him to get a lot of money
[23:54] you're not trusting him to get a lot of
[23:55] wealth or have a lot of popularity
[23:58] popularity no matter what happens in
[24:00] life you're still going to trust him if
[24:03] the Lord takes everything away from you
[24:06] I'm going to trust him no matter what
[24:08] now there is a real mature
[24:10] Christian and we have seen his star
[24:13] brother R said did you ever see them
[24:15] when they was fixing to mold a
[24:18] bail some famous bail for a church chime
[24:21] or something that had to give a certain
[24:24] Dean you see if you're ringing a chime
[24:26] it takes a certain range for each B and
[24:28] it takes certain materials to go in
[24:30] there so much brass so much steel and so
[24:33] much of other ores to go into this bail
[24:35] if it's just straight brass it won't
[24:37] ring right it's got to have all kinds of
[24:40] materials thrown into it to make it ring
[24:43] the right kind of a
[24:45] tone and the man who has put the mold up
[24:48] and set the mold he knows exactly what
[24:51] it takes to go in that Capa what it
[24:54] takes to go into that metal to make that
[24:57] Bale ring that tone God is our great
[25:02] Capa God is he is the great Refiner's
[25:06] furnace that where he has to put these
[25:08] things upon us and trials and
[25:11] persecutions and things to mold it
[25:13] together to make our testimony ring for
[25:15] a certain time and a certain note that
[25:18] he wants rang out in a certain day so
[25:23] you got to go through the fire yes you
[25:25] got to where people mock you and make
[25:28] fun of the way that you're living and
[25:30] and and and and go through all the the
[25:32] the Hall of critics because look
[25:34] suffering is necessary for your
[25:36] character development what does it do it
[25:38] builds it builds
[25:40] resilience so somebody says something uh
[25:44] somebody says something about the way
[25:46] that you're living and the way maybe
[25:47] it'll affect you when you're a young
[25:48] Christian but later on you're not you're
[25:51] not looking for validation from somebody
[25:54] else you can stand on your own two feet
[25:57] and you can know like like job said I I
[26:00] know my redeemer liveth you don't need
[26:02] somebody else to tell you you know it's
[26:05] and it builds resilience as you go
[26:06] through the fire it it it it it Fosters
[26:10] Independence because you you're standing
[26:12] on your own you you got to be independ
[26:14] you got to be able to stand on your own
[26:16] two feet it helps you to understand
[26:19] consequences and and it helps you to
[26:21] cultivate empathy cuz how can you really
[26:24] feel for somebody if you've never gone
[26:26] through trials and never never gone
[26:27] through something
[26:28] you know you you you you have back
[26:30] trouble you can feel for somebody that's
[26:32] has has back trouble you you have
[26:34] migraines you can feel for somebody
[26:36] that's got migraines you ever been laid
[26:37] off before you can feel for somebody
[26:39] that's been laid off you lose a spouse
[26:41] or lose a loved one or something you can
[26:42] feel for somebody that's going through
[26:44] that and then you can really you can
[26:46] Minister and help to somebody and what
[26:49] does it do hard times actually builds
[26:52] your self-esteem too it it helps you it
[26:56] helps you look at things differently
[26:58] because you you get you get crushed and
[27:00] you get you get molded down to where
[27:03] you're trusting in God and then you
[27:05] realize you start to realize that you're
[27:08] genuine
[27:10] hallu yes sir and you start to
[27:14] appreciate positive
[27:16] experiences you start to appreciate
[27:19] appreciate life because you're looking
[27:21] at things
[27:22] differently hard times and trials and
[27:24] tribulations are necessary for character
[27:27] development
[27:29] that's one thing to keep in mind as
[27:30] we're raising our children as we're
[27:32] about to close I I'll stop on this note
[27:35] but you know sometimes we want to
[27:36] prevent our children from from in from
[27:39] hard times and from suffering and things
[27:42] but that's actually what if we'll take a
[27:44] step back and allow sometimes allow
[27:47] things to happen allow them to go
[27:49] through a little rough spot I I will I
[27:52] was watching Zoe when she she had to she
[27:55] she got called to uh uh this this place
[27:59] where that does teaches violin students
[28:01] they they didn't have a piano teacher so
[28:03] she got called to play the piano for the
[28:05] of this little class and boy she was so
[28:08] nervous she didn't think that she could
[28:10] do it and you know she was real nervous
[28:12] about doing that and you know once it's
[28:14] all done then you it builds you now
[28:16] she's got a little bit more confidence
[28:18] but going into it you know you I don't
[28:20] know I don't think I can do it and and
[28:22] you you're Str she's stressing and
[28:24] practicing a little bit more and see
[28:26] what where would we be without those
[28:29] those suff those suffering times where
[28:31] you're you're maybe you're staying awake
[28:33] the night before worrying about it and
[28:35] wondering how it's going to turn out but
[28:37] it actually molds your character and
[28:39] what see what we do sometimes as parents
[28:41] is we try to limit those things but
[28:43] that's that's not what God did with job
[28:47] and that's not that's not how you're
[28:48] going to be how you're really going to
[28:50] grow to a mature individual and I'm over
[28:54] time so we'll stop there but God allows
[28:57] these things to happen to us amen for
[28:59] our good God bless you
[29:02] [Applause]
