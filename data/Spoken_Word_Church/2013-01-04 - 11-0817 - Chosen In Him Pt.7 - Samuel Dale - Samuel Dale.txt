of my heart open me i am shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy good to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have our visitors back there with us we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor two times you're just part of us so we don't have anything to join we're just part of the body of christ so just make yourself to home good to see you amen you like turning these scriptures turn to ephesians 1 where we've been reading at and we will read tonight from isaiah 55 ephesians 1 in isaiah 55. let's pray before we read our scripture father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for everything that you've given us we know that you have truly given them unto us freely we didn't have to do anything to get them but we all we have to do is just receive it nor do we just ask you to help us tonight as we try to speak about you and open our understanding of our scriptures that we may walk in the light of your love and understanding and forgive our sins and lead us father by thy love and thy grace and keep us lord as we endeavor now to speak about you you come on the scene and speak to our hearts and as we were talking about sunday then truly lord come and open the understanding of our of us as thy people but speak to our hearts and quicken yourself unto us because that's what happened there at pentecost they're you you open their understanding but then you quicken them to seeing what was alive we love you and we thank you and just have your way now and keep us in jesus name amen ephesians 1 verse 3 and 4. you have it on the screen if you want to follow it they should be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places that we're at in christ there's nothing worth anything except in christ jesus right according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love now remember we've been trying to bring a point of how that we were chosen in him so then tonight we're going to be dealing with like the thoughts of god and and the things you know of trying to express it to you and so let's just go to isaiah because i like what he has to say about it isaiah 55 i start reading it verse 7. let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon now the original there says that he will multiply to pardon right because that's what it's going to take place that's where he dealt on the dead pentecost he multiplied all right for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for is the rain cometh down into snow from heaven and return is not hither but waters the earth and make it that bring forth but bring forth in bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please it shall prosper in the thing whereunto i sent it you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word i told you that we're going to be using the screen to to read off of but i wanted to give you these quotes sometimes um you know to where that you would be able to take them home with you we won't be doing this continually we're just doing it throughout this kind of a series that we're in because we want to make sure you understand that it's what the prophet of god says and that's what we believe we believe god sent us a prophet to bring the word unto us in the last days and we're not here at just a reading room to read off what he says but we want you to see what he did say in the way he said it to work that it would give us an understanding but now isaiah see he said i said we're talking about being chosen in him all right now we we get in our mind a lot of times what we think something says and as we do then it's really not what is being said all right and uh most of our thoughts on chosen you know they're in in paul saying to the ephesians chosen us in him we kind of make that as being chosen by him or of him and that's not the correct scripture the scripture says to be chosen in him all right see then that way we've got to find out as i've been trying to express to you we're chosen in him all right who's the hymn christ because he just said up above there in the verse of above you know that it's all in christ all right so we know who it you know the part that's that's happening is in christ and then the one who chooses is almighty god all right now we don't believe in trinitarian the trinitarian doctrine uh you know and we do not believe in god in three persons blessed trinity we believe in one true and living god and believing it that way then it was not two people that are doing this because as i tried to bring out unto you that the choice was not like somebody choosing you know i'll take this but it won't take that because that would make a respecter of persons out of someone but it's the fact that god chose to do it this way he chose to reveal himself he chose to to come down and and make himself known and that's what i love about god is the way he can unfold itself uh unto us that like we we talk about it you know and the prophet has said it that you know science they can't no way to make a blade of grass but yet you can take a blade of grass and look at it and see almighty god because you can see that something had to be the creator then you're coming down from that then you can follow it in and understand but that's what we've been trying to see that we were chosen in him so when he was chosen now we'll get to it on another message or two when we get on it we'll get on to work that your name was written in revelations 18 uh 13 8 that your name was written in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world and you know and we'll get down to seeing that these things are taking place back there we're still remember in our studies we we've been about four services or five covering that all we're talking about is what's up in heaven we haven't got down to earth yet so we're trying to study what took place in heaven and then seeing that god stalks now god's thoughts are eternal now we have to credit him to be in that way he can't have a new thought if he has a new thoughts he then he he wouldn't be god he would be like you and i so he doesn't have doug don't make me new way whatever he says that's it when he said a lamb would be slain you know back there before the finally that had to take place right the lord jesus christ had to fool that fulfill that and die on on a cross to pay the price for me and you that had to take place why because god said it and that's the point that i've been trying to make to you and i that if we would just believe it if you find what god says in the bible then just stand on it and say it's mine if it be healing if it be salvation if it be anything that you have need of you know in a real true line then you can look at it and just say the bible says it and i believe it because god can't tell you one thing and then tell you something else there's just no way it can't be done because he'd be changing his mind now we've been through and you know in the stories there it looks like in the bible that he changed his mind but no he didn't change his mind when he gave that man 15 years back there the man died 15 years later he just extended his life for 15 years the same prophet that one told in making his house in order he was going to die was the same prophet that went back and told him that's right that i've extended your life for 15 years he didn't change his mind god doesn't change his mind what he says is it amen all right so then that way we can believe in it and be able to stand on it and believe it so then we realized that we were chosen in him paul says were he said before the foundation of the world all right now how can we bring it down to where that god can choose you know and doing his choosing how can we bring it to the basis of understanding to keep it from crossing up maybe in our thoughts and our minds our scriptures and things that you know that we we look at because it does look like that he just really chose somebody well he did if we weren't chosen by him back there then we'll never be chosen because that's why jesus said see he said i chose you the scripture we used last week he said i chose you before the foundation look at jeremiah go back and read jeremiah where he said you know i saw thee and ordained be a prophet before the founder for the world see all right god can do these things but he has to do it in a way that he won't be a respecter of persons all right so in doing that then he has to give everybody a choice because he can't override your free moral agency he won't make you be saved if you don't want to be all right man because that would be overriding your free moral agency see so he lays it down in front of us that's why the bible says no man sought god at any time because it was god seeking us but that doesn't do away with the fact that we were crying praying fasting uh quitting doing things and trying to line up and and all of that that was the human element trying to to come under subjection to god because we don't believe that he just come down and just dumped everything on us no we had to make the choice but sure then he knew the choice or if he wasn't you know if he didn't know the choice we would make then he's not almighty god that's just to solve the problem so then we we know that he he could look down through time and see everyone that would accept him right and then he could go ahead and write her names in the book but he could leave out names because he knew they would not accept it see then you don't blame god because that's what paul said can the thing formed say why did you form me this way see we god didn't form us wrong he formed us right gave us a choice adam and eve took the wrong choice right and when the choice was made now we don't blame them because we're free moral agents see if we blame them we could put it all on them and god couldn't condemn us but that can't be true see because we're free mortal agents just exactly like adam and eve was we have a choice to whether we want to accept jesus christ as our savior or not i mean and god will come down and i like the way the prophet would bring it out that even the people who have never heard of the gospel will be given an opportunity one day because god won't condemn them because they haven't heard he might take away some rewards from you and i that's pocketed our money instead of putting it out to be able to send the gospel to the world he could do that part but he won't be you know he can go ahead and give those people eternal life one day not because of being good but it's got to be something on the basis of work that like the scripture said jesus comes in a cup of water in my name will be forgotten in this world or the world to come it's doing a good deed for somebody could it hurt your eternal life but we don't go around saying now what can i do yeah you know now we don't go around saying what can i do that i might inherit because that's the rich young ruler what good thing can i do jesus said this he said i've done that he said okay say what you got come on follow me that put him in a place where he didn't want to follow it all right but look what i'm saying we have to make the choice here on earth but god knew that choice before the world so before the world he chose christ right amen not choosing as we say about uh uh it wasn't that god chose to send a son if we used to teach in the organization you know things we thought that god would would send his son well now would you do that i mean consider the thought would you send your son you know somebody's out there and they shot now one of you two is gonna die well go on boy you say now that's being silly because that wouldn't what happened jesus i know the story i come through all of it i heard all of the the discourses and the things about it back there that they say well jesus chose to do it it was who was jesus that's right if he wasn't almighty god then who was he right all right that's right all right so then before the world he never chose to send a son he chose to come himself that's right so he moved over in another form if we talk about it another manifestation of god in the form called a son and then he could create the world and and be those things and all of the things that would take place and it's not another god it's the same god all right see then that god being there then he would be able to see you and i in the correct order before the foundation of the world that's what i've been trying to get you to see see if we were chosen in him well i know when he was chosen we were chosen all right we get back to the story now it wasn't that he chose it was he chose to do it it wasn't he was chose to come you know well okay son you go on down you go down there and die no no he chose to come himself that's why i'm trying to get the point to you about isaiah he said my thoughts are not your thoughts so about the time we think we get the bible figured out as being what we believe it is you come to find it out it doesn't work that way too a lot of times you find out your thoughts on the word of god is not worth anything see there's a scripture there um he says his thoughts are deep well that's true god's thoughts are deep it's not to be able to worry that we can think it out but his thoughts is part of him that's what i've been trying to get you to look at now god is like not like me and you now so let's get it out of the way his thoughts are eternal and he can never have another thought that's right all right see i could have a new thought stand right here say something haven't you thought say something else backwards and forth and change all the time in my thinking but he can't because if he did he wouldn't be gone so you'd be dealing with him as a a human vessel and that's not true but his thoughts are eternal and part of him because whether you like it or not your thoughts are part of you now brother dale i had some bad thoughts today well you know why i had the bad thoughts i let them come right there come on you agree with me i let them come that's right you say well well no i can't help you having bad thoughts well you can let them come in and entertain the thought you might not be able to keep it from coming but you don't have to let it build a nest in your head you know what the old saying goes you know right but that's what we do we let it build a bird dance up into our brain and then it becomes part of us but here regardless your thoughts are what you are you know different what your thoughts are even though your thoughts are not eternal see if you think you're ugly you know what but if you think see a lot of people you know they they're so skinny and all because they've got in their mind that they're fat and they look like a well rope with orange sticking on it you know already skinny as can be but yet they think see they've got it in their mind that their their see is it they're they don't want to get fat they don't want to if they eat much so they'll go eat but then they'll stick their finger down their truck and go throw it up and get rid of it and finally kill them why because you're not getting no nourishment to keep you alive see but that's the way your thoughts are still you know what that person's thought that's what that person's thoughts are if you want to go home lay down goof off be lazy as all get out not work for a living depend on the government you know what you do you can do it because that's your thoughts but you know a millionaire that's one that you know if you inherit your money that's one thing but a lot of millionaires are people who have earned their money you know that's the type of person that is not a lazy person that's the type of person who has thoughts about what to do and all of his thoughts he's bringing it into manifestation right right we see if we could look at it like that then we could see that god multiplied that ten thousand times ten thousands about his thoughts and see his thoughts are eternal amen see a millionaire could think of a little while he said oh i goofed up because if you know the story let's see who i don't know the name but the guy that was uh ripley's ripley's believe it or not he actually went broke he was sitting at the desk the story says and he wrote across the desk broke believe it or not his thoughts went to work probably died a multi-millionaire i guess he did but now because they're way back when they he started see we can change life right we can change things around us by changing our thoughts that's right changing the way that we think about things the way that we we do we can change them you know and see as a christian why wouldn't we want to have good thoughts why would we want to have any kind of bad thoughts what would be the the situation the word that we would would even consider to to you know to think about uh some form of having a wrong thought i mean i repent i know that that i can't help the devil coming and bringing the thought you know what i try to move that thought away as quick as possible but then i say lord why did i let my mind go idle the old saying is what i don't mind it's the devil's workshop that's right man because that's our thinking all right but you see if we cut it off and we put something else in the place of it but it starts going wrong just start saying jesus jesus jesus sweetest name i know you know god don't care how good you are singing he don't care what you got in tune he don't care nothing about you because his thoughts is a whole lot different than ours so what does he do he just moves in closer all right now you have to take the prophet's word for what he says about it but i i know york too but he says the devil sees god moving towards you and he said he'll do everything he can to cut that off that's right yeah sure amen he said you let me be around the house and people coming in to be prayed for he said the kids start acting up everything starts going wrong he said quick as everybody leaves he said kisses just settle down you know he's talking about his kids having little devils in them because that's that's what i try to get you to see you know you look down at that little baby and you saw a wonderful little sweet baby nice born and since everything in the neck would come in the world speaking lies it will lie no matter how good mom and daddy is it will lie you say my kids don't lie that you are a liar you are the liar you're the one that needs help because they're born that way sitting there with a cookie all over his hand and all over his face and said you eat that cookie right come on because they're born into this domain and their thoughts begins to be motivated by this world and the way that we are and the day that we're living in thine sea you know and the way these kids are today you just think about it well my lord when i was about as bad as old boy to worked with he said he went to school for 12 years so he finally finished the sixth grade and quit we were i was pretty close to that but you know how it works but you know but look how smart the kids are today see their thoughts have increased and that's what i love to do with kids i like to see them think about things because i know god thinks about me i've got one in here somewhere trying to find it while i go running through all my notes but i'll find it and bring it back to you but you see god set our thinking you know god before the world sit there thinking he said now brother dale you're just making him too human why not he made us why can't you comprehend that god could sit down and think things over that's right but just remember what i said once he thought it opened i said he couldn't sell he couldn't say well that's a bad way of doing it i'll change my mind do it so much no no because he's not dealing like me and you his thoughts are not like our thoughts he can never have a new thought he can't do that he has to whatever he says that's it right all right see then if he says we were chosen in him well i want to say what he says see then we get down to looking at that and seeing that we wasn't back there as people no we don't believe in that that's right we don't believe in in those doctrines like that like the mormons they believe we were back to ours literal identities or forms or whatever right and you know and finally came down to earth to be uh where we are i don't believe that right amen because i believe what the the bible as far as the basis of where it can go back to it can go back to the word god we see the word god means an object of worship all right so there wasn't anything to worship him until he created the angels that he was god all right and as he created them then those angels worship and make him manifest that point of god but see then the scholars can go back because you read in your bible if you've got anything like a scofield you go back there and read and it'll say elohim you'll use different titles and elohim means self-existing so if we're not going to believe in trinitarian doctrine we sure don't want to believe in philosophy or whatever you want to make it to where you make the bride as being back there as people with him no huh he was back there and he saw us he thought of this world he thought of life and what it would be but then as he thought about it he knew exactly what we would do he didn't make adam and eve sin in the guard right no because he would have been the author of sin right but he put him on a choice a free moral agency and when they got onto the choice of free moral agencies they said want to go then they would be able to make the wrong choice or the wrong thought now don't you think he's got the wrong thought transmitted to her see satan transmitted his thought into her mind as to what you know in other words he said to her go back and read your bible you were brought into this world for that purpose you just read it and transfer it over into your human mind and think about eve was told you were brought into the world for this purpose to reproduce that's what she was trying to do she was trying to do god's bring god's thought into manifestation but the problem was she got her thought involved when she got her thought involved it messed it up had she stayed with adam right but adam the bible said adam didn't sin right he said he was in the transgression he said well adam done the same thing yes he did but he done it willfully he walked out of there willfully with he to try to redeem her and couldn't bring her back because he found himself lost but you see eve had that thought transmitted satan transmitted it into her mind and as he transmitted his thought into her mind then she went forth and and produced the act or the problem whatever you want to call it you know we believe we know what it is but still it was first a thought i want you to see i'm not spanish and i want you to see okay so i say see every once in a while all right i've got a couple other words that i say all right brother gary he can't imitate that because he can't say see he won't try to imitate me he'll do all of you i guess he might be afraid to but listen if god's thoughts are eternal what caused the fall in the garden was satan's followed placed into eve's thinking right right and that caused the fall to come cause us all to be born in sin shape and iniquity and spouse my mother's wounded liar because it was the wrong thought now what if she'd waited on god what if she didn't really just stay with adam because the adam never had a wrong thought he was a son of god he never had a wrong thought but she had the wrong thought and when she had that thought it was finally transmitted into the basis of what we call sin right and see that's the way our thoughts are our thoughts can be great if they're in line i have no problem with the senses of the body do you see they still smell in here as long as god's leading me i have no trouble with the senses of the spirit which is raising memory conscious affections and all like that and desires and as long as god is leading me i like what a man told me at work one time and you know and i'm a human being so don't get the wrong point what i'm saying but where a lady did she she said something to me about them and i said well you know i'm like you or anybody else she said i've been around you all my life all i mean for five years i've worked with she said i've never seen you have a bad day there's always never a wrong thought in your mind it's not plenty of them but as i try to live what i am whether it be at work or whether i'm playing or what i'm hunting or fishing or whatever i want to be you know i want his thoughts because his thoughts are eternal all right now he has to transmit them thoughts down to you and i okay right so he opens up our understanding as we were bringing out about the disciples during the book of luke where it says he opened their understanding of the scriptures but you know he never gave them the new birth right there right he just opened up their understanding that's right amen we can have her understand it open today not even how did you burp right that's where the trouble's at because that's our thoughts right see our thoughts is what's messed this whole bible up amen right right our ways of thinking instead of taking what god says we try to dissect it in some way to figure out some other way instead of saying exactly what he's saying that's right how many trinitarians they use the same bible we used to prove three gods right that the oneness people they use this same bible to prove that they're just one like your finger using the same scriptures you use to show the one true and living god when it's court and what thoughts you're having okay according to your thoughts what are your thoughts today that's right i probably wouldn't want to know them you know because you don't tell them what you're sitting there thinking about me and i'm glad that i don't have that ability i can read faces enough that's right you know i'm out of trouble with that i can read faces and you know i mean if you're sitting there then i know you're not agreeing with me see that's no problem but now listen i'm not going to get into the thought of what we need but i want to just read you the first one that's on the backside of the last quilt that you have it's called 1a the back side of it all right addition to what we've been at it and i want to just read that and then we'll just go from that little thought about what it is because see i want you to look at what god's thoughts are and see what really his thoughts are they're a part of him we've been through this they're eternal he can't have another thought all of that but what's this little one quote type together from a message called adoption 1965-18 so the inside of that was attributes now an attribute is like you're an attribute of your father right it means something coming forth from but now watch what i'm saying so don't get the wrong idea of attribute attribute is not something coming forth from is something it's a part of that that's doing it moving over into another way because see it's not god and another god coming out or another identity or another person or another idea that's not sure an attribute simply means that we were trying to bring out the other day of where the in the book of acts there where paul was talking to him on mars hill and he said we're the offspring of god amen that's right now the offspring of god even to the heathen even to those that's why he could bring that out to them he said even your poets have said that we're the offspring of god see because the people have believed that in other words a cun a whole country believes that their leader especially the kings and the the thing they believe that that king was their god incarnate that he come down to them in that person now they know he's not the god he's the person that the god is in right amen all right and see they writ that's what they believe so paul was saying that even your own poet said it because you heather and you believe that you're the offspring of god and you know what every person in the world every person in the world i don't care how mean how good whatever it is every person in the world is an offspring of god in the fact of creation right because where did we come from well my mom and daddy had me well how did they get you you go and study how they get here and you'll find out a lot of difference now my brother brother brandon would sit like this one down he said the virgin birth is a simple thing he said god just created egg and sperm or what the words you want to use germ or whatever he said he just created them and put them in the wounds of mary he said with the natural birth millions of germs and millions of eggs coming what determines whether it's going to be red-headed brown-headed green-headed or white-headed nowadays god is in all of it but that's not his offspring the way he wants them that's his offspring by creation he wants his offspring to be of the same thing that he is or the same sources he is we'll get back to that but let's look at the prophet this let's see what he says about a an attribute do you understand what an act an attribute then is not see wade is my attribute in other words that means he come from me you understand then josh is his attribute that meant he come from him see if i'd adopted him into the family he wouldn't be my attribute no matter how much i don't know how much that i would give him he could never be my offspring all right so then what does god say he says we're in offspring so watching inside of that was an at was attributes which meant which meant that he was inside of this great ella ella a-l-e-h elohim was an attribute all right you know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature look how simple a man could make the great words of science the great words of the theologians of all of the logos theophany attributes etc etc coming down and boy they got it all blowed up and the prophet just said it's the nature now watch what he said that's so the little fellas would get it and i'm one of the little fellas that has to get it that way pretty good point here inside of him was the nature to be a father but he self-existed there ain't nothing for him to be a father by this is back in the beginning right and now down inside of that was something else that he was god and the god is an object of worship but he was self-existent ella elohim hella elohim so there was nothing to worship him inside of that he was a savior and there's nothing lost to be saved inside of that he was a healer but there was nothing sick to be healed or nothing to be sick now do you get the picture so his attributes his nature produced what is today amen all right now in him was to be father and no children so that does away with pre-existence sometimes we wouldn't back there's people like that in him was to be a be god there was nothing to worship him he finally made angels they worshipped him inside of him was to be a savior but there was nothing lost inside of him was to be a healer but there was nothing sick all right now then if that be true his attributes being his nature his nature all right being a nature of god we can look at it and see him as he displays it came down through and he made man knowing man would fall but he made man he made angels they worshipped him that made him god he made man man sinned he could be the savior there was sickness follower to sin so it could be the healer it's like i told you the other day see he's never been the kind of father that he wanted to be right even though you would call him father in the old testament but that was only the part of creation he could never be the right father until you would bring it on over into this time or the the new testament dispensation right because that's where he wanted to be fathered i'll get back to this sunday a little more on but on christ the mr god revealed the prophet said that was the only way that he could be father was to be the son of man amen that's right and we think jesus was just playing around and just goofing off and just talking and just you know going along just he was sowing the seed he was showing the seed of the word now you and i must be that word you and i must become that word right amen now how can we start it see our thoughts and well what do you mean i'll just be it see that's our cause now that won't fit god's ways right so god's thought says what we're in sin we're away from god there's no way to be able to call him father in the correct way jewry is our creator but that's not the father he wanted to be but that son of man would stand there which would god almighty in human flesh not another god that's right the bible said in him dwelt in the fullness of the godhead bodily all right so when he walked the shores of galilee all of god was to be revealed to mankind was there in that person walk in there with it i read it then he had to release that life that was inside of him but before he could release the lie what was it what was the use of releasing the life see we thought jesus christ has come to die matthew mark luke and john is the most important part of the bible that you need to read i mean that's just the way i put it i'm sorry because we we call it just you know well that's just the gospels if you really get in there and see what he was doing he had to bring all of that before he could die what good would it have done if he'd just went out there and died and gave his life right who would it come back on how could it come back upon anybody because there never was anybody in the bible that were born again and didn't hear a message first you showed me that in the bible that's right brother dale i i didn't i i wasn't reading the bible i was doing nothing i was just sitting there the holy ghost fell on me well all right glory but it could only fall on what you already heard right you're going to tell me you hadn't heard anything before then it was necessary in the bible that a message be preached peter had to come the holy ghost couldn't fall it fell onto them in the upper room because jesus had planted that seed right amen that's right then they preached the message and the holy ghost came amen over it who would it coney is house they had heard about jesus they heard about the things but a man had to go and talk to him why because the seat could only come through the body all right then in doing that then see we look back and we see that his attributes has been displayed savior healer father they've been displayed upon the earth in people but can't we look at it and see by the new birth we become the offspring of god amen right not that we were born you know that way we were born in sin generally to iniquity the psalmist says went forth from our mother's womb a liar paul gets over in the scriptures and says nothing good in none of us we all had our conversation our manner of life like everybody else see that in doing that he had to come and die but before he could die he had to sow the seeds you see what i got to say brother dale never met rip read matthew mark luke and john how much you heard a message right that's right amen somebody told you about it mama uncle or you read the word amen what's the difference when no man didn't tell me no you read the bible right who's that who wrote this come on all right that's right i'm looking at the book of isaiah and i don't think jude wrote that right do you right i mean so you understand what i'm trying to get to we are supposed to display his nature then it was for ordained that we would have to come into the world to be lost so that his nature could be displayed or his attributes could be displayed but he couldn't make us lost and judges were being lost right so we had to put us three more agencies that bring that one ago and then if he put us on the freeway agency he left us and we made a choice now come on why does the bible or why do we talk about you know we use it basically because it's not really written out is that we talk about the age of accountability you know there's no such way of judging the age of accountability because that's what it means accountability a person who's who is not capable of making choices etc their accountability is a whole lot different than anyone else agreed but see god knows that person and knows exactly what it takes to contact that person and like i said we think that big things deep things oh brother you need to preach simple things i try to because you talk about deep things and when you do you don't even consider that in the book of acts those people have never heard a sermon whatsoever the three thousand a lot of them never probably heard the name jesus they just happened to be there when the preacher started preaching but god pricked their heart because that's what jesus said no man can come unto me unless the father draws him amen so if you've come to god for salvation you back on one thing god called you if he didn't you don't have salvation all right that's right simple plain you don't have it all right but get the point of what i'm saying the nature of anything animals have a nature no but people have a nature right you you have been around here long enough until you know my nature you know what i know yours too i know how to talk to you because of your nature but you know what i've talked to one of you but i can't talk to the other one the same way come on because it's a different nature your nature is what caused you to be a mother and a father he said no i didn't know we just got married well what do you think i'm talking about right it was the nature of an individual right why did you pick the wife you did what if you women pick the husband when you picked when i agree with most of you most of us are ugly old man watch me what was the beautiful choice that you made i was laughing the other day we was listening right around talking about that little girl you know said he said what in the world you think about that boy said oh said he's got pretty feet and said he smells so good you know she just want that that's the choice she wanted to make that was her thoughts he said i don't care if he looked as ugly as mud and had carboxyuse he said if he's a christian how many of us chose people because they were christians you know or did we do like i've always tried to tell you you marry first for lust hormone factors and stuff like that causes you to get married then you learn to love you so oh no it was love at first sight well what was you looking at the cute little feet or how they smell all right which one was your life i mean if god told you now that's my wife or that's my husband that's not all about that now i'm not a dummy i'm just saying that god's nature was all of his attributes right that's right you know he can't change them that's right and you know he never got new attributes coming this way i've tried to tell you that for what 40 years and god's descended down he never increased his attributes he either had him or he doesn't have it right he always was a father he said yeah but he couldn't be father because he now there's your thoughts my thoughts are not your thoughts god said he was a father that's right amen that's right god said he was a healer god said he was a was god we see our thoughts gets involved no no no he had to have some that's a display the angels displayed the fact of who he was he never gained attributes by creating angels right he never gained any attributes by creating people right we just made him come out in the manifestation of the things that he wanted to be he always had those attributes but his attributes is his thoughts god's talks are eternal amen so then what do we look at looking back and seeing that before the foundation of the world we were chosen in him now if there's only one eternal all right there's only one eternal and that's god agree all right you know you don't have two or three eternals you know how this that's why we don't believe in hell being eternal because if hell's eternal you'd have to put god's own life into hell and that won't work that's right amen so we don't believe that right that could be billions of billions or trillions of trillions of trillions of trees it could be more than our national debt that'll get every one of you every one of you can tell how many trees what is it thirteen one fourteen uh oh done gone up and won the lights not checked exactly right 14 trillion dollars going up now that's but you know what eternal is a whole lot greater than all of us that's right so hell could be for billions of billions and trillions of years but it can't be eternal because you have to put god's own life there and is god's own life going to be in hell i thought the bible tells you what hell was created for and said it was created for the devil and his angels you know that people are intruders into hell now don't get on that but we are we were intruding into hell why because it would only make for the devil in this angle which is going to be full of people because they chose to go that way why because their thoughts got involved they're all tied up in our own thoughts and we thought we had it right what do you mean brother dale the bible says that the worm dies not the bible says there will be an eternal judgment you better go back and find out what that worm is because really that worm is you and i the soul comes it don't die it death god has to destroy but you see looking at god's thoughts and seeing to his thoughts or his attributes and his attributes is his nature right so then we would look and see what's our nature what is our name our nature is supposed to be you know that he made us a god sure amen says your god when the word comes that's right one because it's saying that we are higher than the animal the animal doesn't have a soul right he has a spiritual life about him and things but he he doesn't have a soul that's why he can't reason things out right he builds the nest the same way in the hogs to its own water and everything else it doesn't matter what you do with it you dress up a hog and powder him up and everything you go right back in the mud because he doesn't have a soul but you see church then god wants us to find his nature and to display his nature that's right amen so there was going to have to be a fall amen there would have to be a fall but god can't make us follow right amen that's right so he could give us free moral agency hallelujah that's right now listen when we come over past adam don't misunderstand me we're still free moral agents every one of us and we can't blame adam and eve but when we pass adam we're automatically born sinners right it's not like adam and eve was born perfect i said perfect the way i wanted to be perfect not eternal they were perfect but you see you and i when we were born we were already brought into the sin gap but we can't blame them see we have a free moral agency that takes over the age of accountability as i said a moment ago and starts working on us right right i mean how many of you can remember when you was a little you know a child or whatever age of accountability but you remember that there was something dealing with you right but yet you turned it away see then that was our free moral agency oh we didn't want christianity we wanted to be like the world you know what that's what we got but you know what that didn't stop god his nature was to steal to be a savior a healer and etc and so he just kept waiting on us waiting on us waiting on it the bible said it's all about noah 120 years god waited amen you know what he didn't get one more soul but he still waited didn't change the thing it still comes he waited that's a wonderful god you know what that is that's his nature amen his nature is to not to be and to do things faster so i signed the other day my wife's readings were going down the road and said something about god doesn't do things fast or something you know he just does it slow and gradual you know what the sun draws millions of gallons of water out of the ocean every day takes it up drops right back down on us don't make a better racket but see we can't figure that out because we can't get the right thoughts you've heard him tell that when they started to go into outer space they had to learn where everything would be and every rocket would be and everything would be because they knew there'd be a lot of them up there and they had to figure it out so they get the the days and things and start figuring it out you know what they wound up one day mission they had to get that calculated correctly because they couldn't shut them rockets off you know what they couldn't find it they went back to the bible and went back to the bible if you remember the man there was telling about the one that was talking about the the 15 years he said you know let the sun go back but it said about a day they ran it back in some way knew exactly that there was lacking about 20 minutes oh that was scooping the sun stand still with joshua all right and then the man where it was to turn back turn back so many degrees you know what that was for 20 minutes they knew exactly i had you read the bible and believed it you know if we read it i don't believe we'll be worried about going to mars what we're going to mars for now i agree that all this junk that we have down here they need to some way get it up somewhere but you know pollute this place but still get the point of what i'm trying to get you to see and then we'll quit god's nature that's his attribute that's right that's just too small for us to think about right you can think about god being some kind of a great and miraculous situation or something you could think on it maybe but to think of how simple it is that almighty god came to earth to give his life for you and me amen amen couldn't send a son he became the son amen that's right to take my place so then he's my brother he's my father he's my healer he's my savior he's my all in all and jesus is his name amen what about your thoughts what are your thoughts about it you know that god has never asked you and i what our thoughts are i run that through the bible i thought i had one night running back looking you know god don't ask us about our thoughts he just said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so our thoughts are not even in the way now it's all right you can run it back you'll find thoughts in there and you find people had good thoughts they had good thoughts but god's thoughts are so much higher right so much higher because he's almighty god let's see yeah psalms 92 and 5 i think it is where he said that thoughts are very deep amen god's thoughts are very deep but you know when he displays it to you and i and gives it to us not deep no more that's right simple when he reveals it simple when he reveals but get the point we'll quit i mean the only way that god could be a father the way he wanted to be was to be the son of man that's right all right because that way he sold to sea you know what he sold he sold you and i am do we believe we're the seed of god amen don't we spend a lot of time talking about we're the seed of god we're the gene of god where it is attributes and things don't we don't spend a lot talking about it we'll see then we are his seed you know what he'd done he sold her he sewed us into the earth you see into the earth not into the ground not into the it's not talking about that but go back in there and read to matthew mark luke and john and find out right that you can find your own place that's right jesus said unless a corner wheat dies and falls into the ground said invite along and said if if it goes into the ground comes forth multiple forms well that's what he was telling was going to take place he was going to have to go to calvary and die but then when it would happen he would come back and live in uni see he sowed us into the earth because that's the way he can be the son of the son of man can be our father no i want god to be my father you're not even getting god's thoughts to be a father would mean that he would have to have seed and our terminologies today we call this that but still there is no such thing as being a father unless you have an offspring that's right that right right i don't care what you you know you inherit somebody you marry into somebody and they call you father but that's not true you're not a father unless you have offspring that's right correct god is not a father unless he has offspring his offspring is his children we are his children we are his children that's how we were in him the eternal life that he had in him is now in you and me that's where we were chosen at we were chosen back there because we have eternal life eternal life means you have no beginning no ending you say did you come into the world with eternal life we come into the world with representation from predestination that's right it's on the future home we come into the world and go out knowing we would want to be saved so he would have it for us he would have it for us to be ready for us when we got here and that all he would have to do is cross our path oh if i'd just had somebody god crossed my face and i was about 11 years old you've heard me tell about it the what i saw whatever if i just had somebody i started searching for that god i wanted somebody when that prophet said job wanted one day that he got to the place that he wanted somebody to be able to reach up and get almighty god and come down and get him and bring them together see that's what jesus christ did when he came to earth to make that up that's what i wanted i wanted to meet that god but you wouldn't nobody could talk to me about it the best thing tell me so what you need to do you need to go up here to a pentecostal church because you know they didn't talk like i was talking see i wanted to know about god anybody that's ever crossed the path of god or god crossed her past really you want to know about him don't you write these quotes back sunday we'll pick up and go on because you know if god's thoughts are eternal and we are his attributes we're just as eternal as he is by the new birth and you know what that makes us part of him there's the children of god there's his offspring is to be part of him he said no i just can't hardly see it that way you're making it too too natural and and everything well why not he was made natural that's right he dwelled on this earth he said unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins well now what that was brother dale was the second person of the trinity you know well we don't believe that that's right see there's where our thoughts get involved our ideas you know what's called you know what caused organized religion or causes ideas of mankind right amen that's right that's why we're not against the people were against the system that caused it to be an organization we're not against anybody catholics it doesn't matter what we're just against the system that made the people that way and you know what every one of us used to be part of those systems right we just don't want to admit it we were part of that system that's right carrying their bible and believe in their doctrine so what do we believe what is it now have our thoughts been changed it better be yes sir because our nature is supposed to be changed if our nature's changed it should bring you thoughts come on brother it should bring new thoughts because god's thoughts are eternal that's right amen god's word is eternal you say no no brother dallas you burn that up yeah but you can't burn up god's word to show you what they tried one day they tried to burn shadrach meshach and abednego didn't he that was god's word they tried to burn it wouldn't work just hot enough burned the bands off their hands that's all they could do god's word is determined let's stand together think of these things 288 jesus is coming soon amen you have a need just come and let's believe and let's see she studied god's word because that's his thoughts will be we had are nothing compared to the thoughts of god morning oh oh thank you oh anybody uh let is oh is maybe there's a blessing time tonight we are here my home is more than you for one another is oh you
