glory [Music] amen and amen and amen and i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord we'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from hebrews 11. and we'll go to romans 8 trying to finish up the uh thought for the of what we've been on and try to move on a little bit into other other points okay uh remember wade is over at brother scott's preaching today so remember that keep him in your mind uh the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday at brother longoria so remember that they're in alabama uh the lord willing brother bob will be ministering this coming wednesday so keep him in mind all right now brother boyd's sunday school class and sister monica's sunday school class are to to meet today at 12 45 to practice singing and everything getting in your songs and getting that ready okay uh also the ladies will be sisters i guess we say sisters uh instead of ladies uh sisters will all meet together this afternoon after the evening service for a little bit to discuss the mother's day outing that you're planning you know us brothers we're going to have us one and so you can have your one two and the sisters will meet after the evening service to get all of that straightened out and find out what you're going to do and where you going what are all of the things okay um true not this what it is not this coming weekend but always get mixed up on which one that the kids and the uh uh things that are supposed to be is that just coming next weekend or the next one anyhow it'll be there one day or the other so y'all can y'all just getting all that together all right any other announcements anything we need uh father we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for everything and we just ask you lord that you'd come on the scene here today and be in our hearts and our lives and that you would open our understanding through thy word because that's our desire more than anything and whatsoever is to hear from you and to walk in the light of your grace and love lord remember those that are sick among us and just reach down and touch each one sister kathy there and lord brother dick brother isle brother dale and sister mary and for all the different ones lord that are sick among us we pray that you would just touch each one you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you have your way now as we read your word and talk about you you just come on the scene in our hearts and our lives in jesus name amen okay hebrews we've been on this for a while we'll try to finish it today if possible now you notice how i said that that okay let's go to hebrews 11 39 we've been up in reading and showing how this is the children of israel this is the old testament saints and all coming down through through the 11th chapter and then we're getting down to the 39th just save time and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise what all those old testament saints they had a good rapport everything's wonderful but the problem was that they didn't receive the promise of what the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost all right is everybody following me they did not receive the baptism of the holy ghost those old testament saints so that was the promise that was to be unto them but they never attained unto it god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect all right let's go over to romans we'll read it all we'll start about the 18th verse romans 8 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope in other words all creation everything is to this place doing what because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits now watch what we of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i want to i said if i can i want to try to finish this up on the uh point that we've been trying to bring out for quite a while that the whole creation we just read it the whole creation everything in the world is groaning painting to be delivered right animals trees people everything is groaning all right now and then we picked up the title part of it to where that we would uh be able to follow it and we'll read this in a second where that brother branham says even god is waiting on us see we think it's right opposite direction huh well that's all right that's fine it's all right but the main thing is to see that god is waiting god is waiting on you and i waiting on somebody why can't we believe that we're that person that's there all right why can't we accept the fact of who we are as i've always tried to illustrate to you the prophet said what is our biggest problem looking back looking forward failing to see what's taking place now all right now the statement i make is this point here and we'll back up into the message after a while and pick it up see we've we we accept the fact we gladly accept the fact that god sent a prophet in this last days to bring us the message right we happily rejoice over that fact of doing some of you actually were there enough to see you with your literal eyesight and see the things that took place in the ministry of this last day prophet all right so we don't have to worry about wondering well we don't know whether this is another no that's what i'm saying we make that statement and make that statement plain and blunt to you i believe that god sent us a prophet all right and we've been able to rejoice over those things you know that was brought by the prophet all right but that doesn't end at all me now i'm saying it and you get upset with me do what you want i'm not offended to nobody because i'm saying what i believe if the prophet's right he said we look back we look forward but we fail to see what's taking place now okay we look back some of you look back now and can talk and and have made your testimonies and and things about what you saw of the the the prophet being coming and bringing the message and you actually seeing the dead rays the sick healed and the thing all right and you're looking forward out there to many things to come forth because we do look forward to that but the prophet said our main point should be able to see what's going on now because what happened is wonderful what will take place is wonderful but what about now all right see that's my whole emphasis that i've driven to you for all of the years that i've been trying to pastor this church is one thing that i'm happy to be where i'm at i rejoice in where i'm at i don't have to worry about trying to find something else i believe it and i walk in it to what that we receive right now all right then that way the pres the bible comes to an open point because what does that let's see what i am means ever present for eternity the word i am so that's where we're at we're i am ever present for eternity right here talking now about god that's alive okay well i i i just don't believe that he's he's like well what do you believe when are you going to believe and what are you looking forward to to try to uh achieve whatever you decide in your life for what to be i'd like to know i mean i'm serious i'll give you the pulpit and let you let you explain it because i want to get out of here i mean there's one thing about it we're going to get out of here one way or the other now you know i mean i'll be 80 in april and a lot of you are and and there's a lot of us old enough to worry that you know we we need to realize we're going to do something like brother howard carroll said one time he said said i'm going one way or the other the age is going to get him you know or you know and just everything going to run out okay but now listen that's my whole point my whole thing is to try to to see what we're talking about that god is waiting on you and i to step forth and we'll follow it through in a minute to come to the position that we're supposed to come to and to walk off of this earth all right now that's that's as much as we can do okay all right but see now here's i don't want you to forget this see i believe that god is waiting on us to step forth and believe who we are and what we're here for i believe that uh you know i've always looked forward to that and i believe it i've always preached it i've always tried to believe it that you know that that it would come forth a day in a time that god would move on the scene i'm looking forward to that you say are you looking for a great revival no i'm in a great revival well he's been preaching on that part about the revival thing see i rejoice in the fact that that i've always talked about a revival as not because even in the baptist church we preached it come on church whether you preached it or what you did where was you at we preached in the baptist church that a revival was not for a sinner you don't revive a sinner revival is for a christian to be revived in what you're doing then sinners will come to the altar yes and rejoicing in their point to catch it but it's not that far the revival is supposed to be within you well i've been in a revival ever since i've been in this message i'm as serious as i can be about it and it's honest i wish you'd take my word for it i've i've rejoiced over this message ever since i saw the and started studying it and rejoicing about the things of god all right in doing that then see god is now and we'll cover this in a minute and just get back to the point but here's the main thing i've been driving okay listen is what why does it say that they without us cannot be made perfect and we know that means not to push policy up and make it it means to that we're not complete right we're not in our complete state all right now and what is it doing see i've emphasized over and over one thing to me the greatest thing could be thought of is the fact that you know that you're looking at christ and seeing him alive among us and walking in and you know and doing because that's the point all right that makes a pull what if we emphasized about that the reason or the point of saying they without us it's a pull there's a great pull among the endtime people all right see you may not look at it the way that i look at it i look at it as a pull to understand god's word you may look at it as a pull to have signs and wonders well that's okay because it'll be there don't don't tell me that god is going to come on the scene and open his word to the people and and let it be made known to the people and not be signs and wonders to follow i've never been that dumb maybe stupid but maybe not that far off because i've always looked forward to work that the prophet said after the door of the gentile i'll quote it back in the mean of the gentile churches close god will anoint a church then but what did he say he said he's doing it now right now among us right god moving among the people drawing what's going to bring the dead out of the ground not you're going to go dig holes and what's going to do there's a pool all born again believers are connected together you follow me all born again believers how that connection that that uh that part that anointing or whatever and we'll get back to it this afternoon the lord willing and uh because i want to make sure that i'm understood about what i'm trying to bring about this it's this end time about the anointing and the things that where we're at uh i'll try to make it clear as possible because i've i've been at it for 40 something years trying to preach it and seemingly some have misunderstood what i was saying in the things that i've said so i want to make sure you understand what i'm saying whether you believe it or not that ain't got nothing to do with me that's between you and god i just want you to make sure to understand what i'm talking about all right and to worry that i can can see it huh would you go get me some water um i've had a problem with a dry mouth now for a couple of two or three weeks and you've never seen me in a dry mouth but i i have to drink water okay so forgive me all right but now listen what does it mean thank you brother what does it mean that they without us cannot be made perfect okay it's not something that we do it's something that we are then all right when the when the methodist went forth with a revival or luther when luther went forth with a revival and bringing it forth it started a great move right among the people okay the revival was among the people not necessarily luther as much he was dire and part of it but the main thing was the revival that was within the people of that day that started a pull a connecting so then when wesley would come forth he could walk right out onto luther's message of the just shall live by faith and as he would walk out on it then and bring forth his message it would just start a pull a connecting and as i said each one of these to me each each one of these virtues is a connection to each other each one of these ages is a connection the people of that age is a connection it's a drawing power they without us cannot be brought to that position of fullness all right see the whole creation is waiting now the whole creation is waiting on you and i right let's just see what is what the prophet had to say we'll read a little bit of these anyway uh go ahead with number one what was the holy ghost given for look what he says now when we need it the spirit of god raises a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit a standard right and those that are are resting out yonder in the grave are under the altar of god as the scripture says they're crying how long lord how long how much longer god's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you now look what he said adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ become so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture how much more wonderful could a thought be than to think about what has just been said by a prophet to us but do you understand what he's talking it's waiting on me and you huh see waiting god's waiting on you on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness all right then are you not looking forward to something i mean is there anything wrong with me to be able to read what a prophet says is due to come and i should be able to rejoice and say i believe that i believe that thank god for that i'm looking forward to that i've always looked forward to a great move coming among the people of god yes but not the way most people think about the doings because they don't think of the revival as the word of god being unveiled and then the after effects the rejoicing comes in the after effect part of it right why shouldn't we be happy about what we see i mean if if it's something wrong i'm sorry i don't i don't uh uh try to uh to make anything other than to me to just read it and see what it says all right now if we read it it says when we need it the spirit of god raises the standard why well brother dale are you expecting god to move on to sin i sure am i've always expected him to move on the scene you know what but i've always seen him move on the scene haven't you i mean we've seen the dead rays we've seen this thick heal we've seen everything could be thought of in forms or ways of of a manifestation in this little bitty little building here we've had a lot of manifestations right well i don't know about that well then just go to sleep and forget it you know i'm not throwing no stones at nobody i'm just telling you we've seen it take place when you can holler to a man and he's laying there in his eyes it doesn't roll back in his head and you call his name and you see him just uh he just come right back well you say well i don't know whether he was dead or not and i'll holler for you and we'll see if it'll work so if you die get me word i'll holler for your name i'll call for you because i believe in it i believe the same god that walked the shores of galilee is here today all right does that do away with brother branham no that establishes him in the basis of what he come to bring the message to us it doesn't do away with anything it doesn't make this that or the other it makes it all to be one thing god is living among his people amen all right think about it number two message adoption he's talking about dispensation there was a dispensation of christ there's a dispensation of the church organization there's a dispensation of the outpouring of the holy ghost now is the dispensation of adoption now listen what the world's waiting groaning and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time when the dead rises when the sickness ceases when all the earth ceases to grow the fullness of the dispensation of time a dispensation waiting on us go right to number three here you him running up where we get the there you go that's where god's trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved and it will move now do we believe i mean a big man in this message i won't call his name but you know it enough he says that that spoken word was only for brother branham and the lord jesus well okay bring me your bible let me rip out that part where it says if you say to this mountain you know i mean what am i supposed to do with that just that one scripture what am i supposed to do with it i'm supposed to believe it all right and in believing it what authority sons of god the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation which the word manifestation is making known of the sons of god waiting to a spot to where the sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight what we need is adoption listen that's why i said it and i mean it i would have given my life hardly i mean almost the fact of seeing what some of you saw through the ministry of this last days why because i believe it i believe it when god spoke to me back there years ago coming out of the the denominations and said look like there'll be two prophets come well i believe it when he done a lot of things in my life i believe it i believe in a living god i believe in a god that's alive and well in our hearts and life when he's waiting on us to call him on the scene he's waiting on you and and i to to call him on the scene to where he can make manifest what he's promised that he'll do after the door of the gentile church is closed he said i'll know in a church then he said but he's doing it now all right to be rejoicing over what we see well i just don't know see that's the point that we die in our own ways go ahead number four we just die in our own sails huh go ahead and we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption and will we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in now watch not with a new birth for we've received that through christ but you'll adopt your church then i'm looking forward to these things i've always looked forward to it but the only way that i can look forward to it is look at it present tense see if i'm looking forward that means that somewhere away on our channel i'm pushing it beyond no i'm looking at what's taking place but i realize there's going to be more i've always looked for the church to come to a place and always preach it that way to where if we just believe god he'll move on the scene and do the great signs and wonders but if we don't believe him he won't do it do we believe it though do we believe the word do we do we accept one fact that he is alive waiting for the fullness of adoption all right there's no problem with waiting i don't have no problem with waiting do you i want to see god move more among us yeah but i can also wait for him to move why because he promised me he would and if he promised me he'd move then what i do i wait for him to move that's right but i don't wait like others do you know to well one of these days i i know but we we we we we we need to be more in tune with that back there now we need to be in tune with what's taking place right now what back there was back there what's out there is out there what's here now is what we need to be but i kept asking you the question why would it keep saying or why did it say there that they without us cannot be made perfect now that us must mean a group of people or you and i or whatever you want to call without us trying to come to a place to see what's among us then go ahead to number six i'm just trying to read a few of these things where at least you'll have it in your mind and i'll even put i'll read to you what i wrote on the side of my notes okay we have seen the same ministry of jesus christ in our day in the prophet amen okay i wrote that on my own notes where i wouldn't fail to remember we've seen i'm talking about you that saw it in the it was diary and and what we've seen in the prophet but does that stop it we're waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when this is number five at the first resurrection the fullness of adoption is going to come at the first in other words the first resurrection is the fullness of adoption it's not the fact of it trying to come it's here if we just believe it but why can't we believe it why can't we put our whole life see i don't have anything left over i don't have nothing in reserve i don't have any uh bank account and swiss stone bank in switzerland you know and all and i ain't trying to save up all of that i think it's sensible to be sensible with your life and your doings and your money i think that's sensible all right you don't have to be you know all out of it just just be sensible in other words ain't nothing wrong with having money in the bank right no problem but see don't put our whole life based upon that put our life based upon what god said right what god said i've seen these things i don't have to worry about it you know we were going to have a meeting had a dinner here one time and they all come in and told us what in the world are we going to do back then we didn't have something you could run up here and down here to get and to do with hardly you know and i said put it before the people there will be enough we set the table everybody ate it was enough we didn't have bushels left over didn't need it we just needed enough for that day we've seen these things church it's not something to to make that well i i feel if you know if i'd seen it in the prophet praise god the people were back there saw it well see you can't just put the whole thing based upon one point we put it based upon what his word says he said he'd take care of us are you worried about it i used to me and brother mo we kind of you know years ago we kind of got tied up in a little bit of our own sales i guess and at one time i had enough food sitting in the house my house had been able to fed this church for about six months sure did why because i was like everybody else and i still think you ought to have some beans and taters stored up i still ain't against that we still got some my wife she'll go to town she'll pick out two cans and sit in two cans you know and we cause why cause we may need it sometime okay ain't nothing wrong with storing up food but you see then it dawned on me one day hey if we need it god will take care of it he did a man gave terrence a big old pig so we were going to feed the pig so we took the food out of the house and we opened the cans and we poured it in and we fed that pig it got to where that it couldn't even stand up to eat i ain't telling you the poor old pig would wiggle up and get to the trough and then he'd just scoop it up sure was good to eat wouldn't it terra we had us a good time out of it but see listen church i still think you ought to have something i'm not saying to pile your house full of stuff but i'm saying it's good to have a couple of cans left over when the power goes off at our house you may not be on the end of the line like we are now the people on the internet wouldn't understand we're on the end of the line and when the power goes off we're the last one to get the power back on because we're out on the end we're in the country well i i think it's nice you ought to have something you want to put your few cans in this that or the other back somewhere and set it up and leave it well i ain't preparing for that don't be that way with me don't i've done told you i've been on both sides of the fence so don't worry about it you know i'm i'm going to depend on god i am too but if nothing happens i want something to eat after a while how about you i mean don't you tend sometime today to eat a little bit well why are you going to do that just wait for god to bring it to you just go sit down at the table and wait on him to bring it it's a good way to lose weight okay trying to be serious but not to be so bad but serious see why is it that they without us cannot be made perfect because in each age the word of god has always been the pulling power to bring that age to jesus christ to bring me and you to christ for what we have need of and he always promised he'd take care of that a pull between each church age a drawing power to draw us toward him till even as we've read from the prophet that he said god is waiting on you and i well no no no no we're waiting on god well see you're not listening god is waiting on you and me to believe his word he'll take care of the rest of it he'll take care of everything if we'll believe him right he had always promised it he's always kept his word to me we've never been hungry we've never had we always had something to eat how about you well somebody supplied it i'm going to believe it's god you say well now we got i can work for it well that's that's a good way to do that too because you uh you need to work i found out the bible said that it means ever read the bible you know the bible says if you don't work you don't eat well i didn't know the bible said that we'll try reading it sometime you might find out there's a lot of good things in there if we'll just read it and believe it but see what am i trying to get god is waiting on me and you all right see adoption time when he can pour in as we read his fullness into the church until it would make manifest god in a great way all right what would it be you realize that it's the same ministry can you believe it the same ministry is right here today that was on the shores of galilee now that's what your prophet said the same ministry all right then we don't have to try to pump up something we just believe it the same ministry that was back there with the children of israel it's right here today waiting on me and you to believe it accept it say thank you lord but i've never seen this what is the scripture and never seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging bread go over to number eight trying to read a few of these where you'll believe it so listen to what he's saying and the ministry of the pentecostal church will have to get so perfect till it'll fit right in with the same ministry that he had here okay let me read it which will take the whole thing in the rapture be in the church the ministry is going to fit together because that to me that's what i emphasize see to me that's the pulling power that's the drawing power of the church of trying to pull it to to the to the point of believing god the same ministry look at the next one number nine that's the church like the pyramid comes into a point so has the church in the days of luthier days of wesley days of pentecostal and now just before the headstone comes into it that church has to be honed so perfect and now what there's the point of why that they without us cannot be made perfect come on it has to be honed so perfectly to the same ministry he did hear his same spirit so predominant every banana will bring that same body right into it and resurrected the whole thing it's going to be what he's going to do right but he's going to do it through you and me right let's do let's get this slicer all right but the cap on the pyramid was never put on of into cairo and in egypt and the captain never did come because it was a cornerstone it was a headstone in the church it was the cornerstone in the full church it was the headstone is that hard to understand in the church it's the cornerstone because that's where it started we built on the foundational apostles prophet jesus christ being the chief cornerstone build on what they're saying all right that's the cornerstone but then you got to come to a headstone okay it was rejected and it will come and i believe that when it's coming that the church will shape into its place from justification under luther sanctification on the wesley and the pentecostal message will bring the church to such a a minority and a ministry will be among those people till it will be exactly the same ministry that jesus christ did that'll bring jesus and catch the whole thing away do we believe that the same ministry of the lord jesus christ is not coming it's here with us well i just can't see it open your eyes what's the matter is that you don't want to see would that be it could it be that we don't want to see what it would do away with anything for for god to come down and do great signs and wonders with you and i right now what would that do away with it'd be an honor to see him among us manifesting himself and i've declared to you over 40 years that at least you ought to listen to that point that i've declared that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever because i believe that then see to me then the point of what i've been driving at is the main thing the drawing power see here's your headstone here's your cornerstone which is over here but it's just faith it's drawing pulling us upward drawing us it's here among us see why would we doubt it being among us well i just don't see it well where's your eyes where are you at why is it you can't see it see if he's the same yesterday today and forever then all right when are we going to start believing now i mean literally believing it it doesn't matter what and let christ come among us to pull us together in a unity of love and i like i like what we're talking about kind of a sound mind but what about it do you believe he's the same there's no reason for us to doubt jesus christ being the same yesterday and forever that would make us unbelievers i believe that he's the same today as he's ever been i've seen him live that way i've seen him in manifestation i don't have to worry about it yeah brother dale i've never seen well then take somebody else's word for it until you can believe it for yourself how much more would that need to be said what's the problem you mean you don't believe him to be the same i believe he's the same in every way i'll quote wrote a random he said in every way except a human body that's one quote that he's the same in every way except for the human body why can't we believe that you see that's what i've tried to get you to see over this series part of it to to get you to understand they're waiting on us to step out and believe it who's waiting everybody everybody from here back is waiting right if not what are they waiting on they're waiting on me and you to step forth and believe what god had already said if you don't get nothing out of the message you get anything to understand get one thing that new birth that you have within you is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen why would we want anything other than that or try to desire after it well if i could just see what is it how you believe to see or see the belief one of those will mess you up but listen church i've tried to get you to see that those people have died and went on they're waiting on me and you no they're waiting on god well where do you think god's going to be i thought you believed that god was in you i thought you believed the new birth put him into you christ in you the hope of glory this is each church do we actually believe god can we put everything we've got on it like i said i don't have nothing extra left over i just don't i don't have anything to worry that you know would be any different i'm just working on what i've got right now to be whatever god wants me to be come on musician listen get my whole point the bible says there in romans the whole creation is waiting the whole creation is waiting now we've talked about it that even god is waiting and i don't think that offends him when he was the one that told the prophet to say it do you i think he meant it everything's waiting on you and me to believe it and just stand on it if you don't get nothing from the series parts of what i'm talking about that they without us cannot be made perfect everything in the world is waiting on you and me adoption time when he can pour into us his fullness we can go in the rapture but see we look at adoption time like i tried to tell the people 40 years ago about adoption they were talking about adoption back then and they were saying well one of these days one of these days you know it's going to come one of these days we're going to have this out the other i said then as much as i've tried to say it now if you can't see christ alive in your life right now don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about tomorrow we need to be serious in our lives and our thoughts to believe god and believe what he's doing among us is what he said he would do how much how long would we need to stand here and talk about the things that god has done among us oh sister kathy's not here but she somebody stole her pocketbook we called for it and it came back brother cawley was up ministering years ago on a wednesday night i think for certain they broke into his home and stole his guns they come in the next day at work and told me about it and said brother colley got his gun stole i said we're going to call for him to come back we stood right there and all of us prayed together a few days later a man come up and said i'll tell you something to this degree i'll tell you where your gun is at if you just won't tell on me in other words what he was finally saying he wound up and got his guns back what else do you need we've seen the sick healed that a word well i need this well all right speak the word what do we need to be able to prove that god lives what is our reason for not believing that god lives he we've seen him do what he said he'd do what are we going to believe it men sitting right over here on this seat they were out fishing and he left his old boots on where he'd been working um concrete work and when the guy gets out in the boat the boat flips over brother doherty goes down they don't know how long that he was underwater because he doesn't know how long he said all he knew to do was he just raised his hands if you think about what i'm saying the boat turns over the guy has to get the boat turned back over has to get everything straightened back up get back into the boat and roll comes back to the spot that he thinks right where he's at and reaches down in the water and he gets him by the hand don't know how long he was in the water but god brought him forth what else do we need there's old danny sitting back there fell off a building bummed up put him in the hospital i was there waiting for some what were joyce from two weeks two weeks that joyce and i were at the hospital until they even actually thought joyce was his mama and i was his daddy because when people come by looking for him they say well his mom and daddy took him down to the test to be run you know because we're there so much two weeks that danny lays up in the hospital comes out of it and he says you ought to know that i wasn't in my right mind well you see there he was in intensive care laying up in the bed just talking like everything and they'd say danny you got this spleen messed up here or something you got this done you got that and said you need to get he said well just go ahead and work on it when he come out of that i got chewed out he said you ought to know i wouldn't have volunteered for stuff like that but what i mean is he lived went down to atlanta aneuism ask him to just stick your hand up danny you see that hanging up underneath that watch is a prayer cloth told a lady the other day we took some prayer claws down to some people at the chiropractor and and i thought she might think about it some way and i said i said hey look don't you worry about them laws you can't wash the anointing off of them she just looks at it i said don't worry about it just wash them whatever they don't make you ain't gonna wash it off and i said if you need to just whack one of them in hive because it don't have to be a whole size because i believe it danny's had that prayer cloth under his watch now for what five years eight years i don't really know how long 14. okay you know he believes in it how about you how many more miracles do we need what do we need to

squirrel so i said okay we will and i got a prayer cloth out of the bible and um my oldest son called my daddy and said papa i squirrel has god would you help us pray for it so mama said daddy got
