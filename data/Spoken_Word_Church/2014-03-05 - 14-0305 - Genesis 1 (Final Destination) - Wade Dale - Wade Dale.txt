heads and talk to the talk to the one that brought us here Heavenly Father we pray tonight Lord that you would again as we always say be the active participant in the service please don't be the bystander of a recorder of our thoughts and ideas because they're wrong and and against you father but may as we speak here and just for just a little while that that you'll come down and and be the one to to see one to hear and and the one to speak father we ask you Quicken the word father we know the word's anointed already but anoint us father to hear the word be with each one Lord in the building we pray that you'd be with a little bride around the world there be any sick among us you said you sent the word and healed them and deliver them from destruction so we ask Lord that you would take care of each one Lord be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields give them fruit for their labor be with the ones that are that are coming in next weekend brother Vernon from the Philippines just bless him and be with him be with us Lord as we travel just be with a little bride around the world cuz we truly are your children father we are the Masterpiece family the one you've always wanted to see and here we are father forgive us of our sins be with us take care of us in the furtherment of this service in Jesus name we pray amen Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them now here we're going to see that we're going to see some things in a little while that we looked at these definitions but I want to kind of maybe uh let you I I was I was thinking today and I thought well Lord I'll just put the put the things together and you the thought came to me well just put a seed out there and let it let them do it let you because see I can stand up here and speak all night but unless you relate to something or or or the seed is being nurtured you can the seed is the word of God so as we preach the word of God you either take it in or you spit it out or or or you don't get it at all and then when you don't get it at all it doesn't do you any good all right I've always told Brother Claude I said I said brother Claude you'll understand one thing as a preacher you get your anointing while you're studying that's our anointing we get our anointing while we're studying brother B said I was sitting in the woods and and I was sitting at the tree and he said you thought I was a wild man he said cuz I started writing scriptures down he said then I started running running around the tree well that was his that was his anointing God had anointed the word to that man and same way with a with a minister and a lot of people don't understand that you say well I've got to get anointed to preach no we actually we were born with a gift right to get oursel out of the way getting another gear so that God can anoint us first cuz if he doesn't anoint us first he's not going to anoint you so so the word's already anointed so maybe we can just clear some things out of your head a little bit today that will help us to realize that uh keep this in mind as we go through I think we're always putting things off as humans we put things off we're procrastinators most of us 99.9% but God wants us to realize that things have already been done all all the provisions have been made and that everything we need so we don't have to go get anything cuz right here in verse 28 God blessed them God said unto them he's speaking straight to whoever that group of people he's not speaking through he's speaking straight to that group of people be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now that pretty much covers everything Brother Gary that pretty much covers the whole the whole earth everything that creeping creeps on the Earth all the fish in the water and all the foul in the air so that pretty much covers it all so now let's read in Revelations 21 verse one I like it when you can take it from Genesis to Revelation and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself Not Another Not a second person not a third person God himself shall be with them there's that them right we picked it up in Genesis 1 them God blessed them now we look and we see that God himself shall be with them and be their God you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I believe there that we that John saw saw the holy city he saw the New Jerusalem he saw it as a bride Adorn for a husband John actually saw Adam and Eve back in the Garden of Eden right that's right hey if Adam and Eve was drove out and Redemption puts them back it's not Tom and Susie going back into the garden right it's Adam and Eve going back into the garden all right so that's where full restoration comes is where you see that this journey that this Genesis 1 is taking sure there was a there was a gap in there where that if we had not been part of the fall or or God didn't have an attribute of healer Savior and Redeemer he just had an attribute of father if he just had that then then there would have been no need for the city to come down the city would have been here it would have been it would have been the Garden of Eden all right because remember I'm going to read you several quotes and you know many of them by heart but brother R talks about us going back into the garden Christ the mystery of God revealed you know that third purpose was to restore Fallen Eve or for Adam and Eve to get back into the garden because to get back into the garden restores all things because in the garden there you got Adam and there you got Eve and they're they're expressing the they're expressing their godship their rulership they're expressing that Adam had control over everything Eve also rightly had had control and Eve also so here we see that it's not uh you look and you see heirs and Joint HS you see that when we what God has done because of Fallen Eve he's going to take that part and he's going to restore it back to its full dominion and full power because we're join HS with Christ not not here and here join HS is is together one so it's not it's whatever we lost so Adam remember just kind of backgrounding just a little bit Adam was the complete gene expression of God for his time you hear what I said for his time he was a gene expression for his time he was the very DNA of God he was the attributes of God being made manifest on the face of the Earth all right so now we see though that that all that came into view that that that theophonic 1: 126 man everybody understand that's the theophonic that's the theophany of God Amen not another person not a not a like substance right you got to go back to that we can't we can't see ourselves as second persons now in natural form Josh is is me made manifest in another form and he is another person that's down here right that's human relations but God relations is the problem was is we see ourselves yourself as a second person that's the problem we see but remember these things have already been spoken by God God's already blessed this group of people he's already said multiply he's already said replenish he's already said have dominion so it's going to happen whatever God said it's going to happen all right so that's going to take place but we see that if it's already spoken by God it's going to take place but during that time the attributes of God were not fully made known even in the Old Testament right I want you to see that how how that you and I are we we see that that God is he's so gracious remember I want you to remember one thing I was telling uh the group over in uh Columbia the other day remember this is not for God's benefit he knows these things the Bible's not telling him something he don't know right he already knows it amen he wants us to realize it so it's not a surprise to him and it's not a it's not something that that God just thought of yesterday and it's not like a newspaper where he printed the Bible up yesterday or the day before when something else happened no this is all done and you can look at true predestination you can see that that you got here by some way but the reason you got here by some way is he saw that Genesis 126 man looked down through time and saw where it was going to land and that you you remember as a as that together were the fullness of the godhead bodily I'm jumping ahead a little bit but I'll back up in a minute all together will the fullness of the godhead Bly not one person except Jesus Christ because Jesus had us in him he could be the fullness but see I don't have all of you in me so that I can't be the fullness but brother Dale has a fullness his part brother Tatum had a fullness his part brother Tom had a fullness his part right and the only way that God's going to get back together right is to bring all those attributes back on this Earth amen and going to bring his children back because Satan didn't steal some of them but he took them for a downfall right can we say that he took just took him for a downfall because remember I was telling him uh in the U Bible study the other night the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first now there ain't nothing dead in Christ when we listen I want you to raise your hand when we read that scripture we literally think that the dead out there in the in the in the uh mums and the dead in that's not true exactly Christians are asleep you died in Christ when you got the new birth so that dead in Christ is going to rise first amen so they're coming up the dead in Christ the ones that's already died here because remember don't worry about the second death if you've already went through the first one that's why brother Brown says he fell asleep that's why the Bible says step fell asleep they just brother Tatum just fell asleep God did him a favor right he'd be hund and something years old now and he it'd be in a horrible condition we just don't look at it that way right but remember excuse me I didn't bring any water up here can somebody get me just a little glass of water I usually do it myself but I didn't do it myself this time but remember the dead read the Bible the dead in Christ I died in Christ in 1997 exactly so I don't have to die again this thing right here may fall asleep but when I come back right I'm going to pick this thing up and it's going to change it well now there's a group of people so says the Bible that that will not happen to all right you love the Lord he's got this journey it is predestinated it is it is done and finished in God's eyes it is pred before you get here but it's because of the forn knowledge of God knowing what you choose when you get here you've heard that I don't think you've heard it enough but I think we've heard it to where we can understand that everything comes by for knowledge everything if God didn't for know it then it didn't happen right what a mighty God we serve so so the little things that we go through and pops up in life and all the the heartaches and troubles it didn't surprise God right that's right and if he's in you you can take it better I didn't say you was going to do away with it I said you can take it better what we've been studying in the Bible in the Sunday school class downstairs the statue of a perfect man I I think it's it's vitally important because remember Genesis 1:26 was given power before the foundation of the world right right hello somebody power before the foundation of the world I just read it to you and God blessed them and God multiplied replenish and subdue and have dominion they weren't even in flesh bodies yet right amen right but here we are in flesh bodies and we can't hardly get to church come on we've got the power right but Power without character you know what the prophet said it's satanic it's not that the power satanic right the power is not satanic the power is of God but the way you use it in the hands of a novice that's why the Old Testament I I don't and I know you don't and but maybe some people out there sees that the Old Testament had the new birth or or or you know had the Holy Ghost like we do I don't see that because the blood of bulls and goats was just a substitute it didn't do away with a man's sin it just covered it or capoed it just it just kept it covered until Christ came to do away with it so they weren't a part of that Genesis 1 126 man because that was lost in the fall the book was taken I'm trying to get all get all this banked together and then we'll then we'll rush through some quotes here but in the Old Testament it did show God's attributes yes sir I mean they were on display Isaiah Daniel U you name them they they were on display Abraham Isaac hey they're the foundation they're the pillows that's the C I don't have one of them great big things like Bob had the other day I told him we was going to get him a hydration pack and put it on his back next time he preach and I told him too I said he remember at the first of the service he said I don't have anything tonight if he ever gets something it'll be a three-hour sermon cuz that was an hour and a half from nothing did a good job absolutely a good job and he's going to go somewhere in a couple weeks to preach and I'll let him announce that to you so he just told me a few minutes ago so anyway so on the Old Testament the attributes were showed in type remember in the book of I think it's maybe in Romans where where Paul is talking he says look he said those were given to us for an example so they were examples couldn't be the children of God they could be examples of the children of God I'm going somewhere with this all right but now look when the fullness came which was Jesus Christ he came with that theophany that Genesis 126 man he came with that inside of him everybody clear with that because that's the theophany of almighty God there God doesn't have two theophanies God doesn't have two Holy Ghost right he's either got the new you either got the new birth or you don't you know there's no there's no gray area there but when the fullness came the genis one was in him the very attributes of God and he displayed them on the earth now as we were speaking before last um couple Wednesdays ago we were with him we were in him when he walked the shores of Galilee we were in him when he preached we were in him how do you think that we can heal we can't heal the sick but how do you think God heals the sick through us if he didn't come and heal the sick how would we know how to heal the S how would we know how to get them in the condition to to be healed or a condition to be saved nobody knew anything about salvation till Christ came nobody understood it Nicodemus didn't look at that example the man lived in the temple and he didn't understand anything about this new kingdom or this new birth or or or the coming back of power of this Kingdom that that Christ was talking about but now look Jesus wasn't a type anymore he was the literal person amen all right so he was the literal one that was coming to bring the power back remember I I I read that um quote to you not too long ago where Jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance everybody understand that that's kind of hard for some people because you go preach it at other places and you better read that quote because they'll look at you pretty strange but he didn't come to bring you inheritance back your inheritance was at Genesis 1:26 right Dominion power replenish multiply you can't do away with that God said it it's going to happen but it was it was covered or or it was it was pushed back into Calvary so that the real deal could come the very attribute of God not something that acted like God right Satan acts like God if if if brother B said Satan I know Dad made a comment the other day and I've been thinking on that how that Satan brother says Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts now he did not say he could make Supernatural gifts he could pass them out well see Satan's Satan is spiritual he's a conduit he can pass out God's spiritual gifts right amen amen he did that in that man that brother Bram said stood up and spoke in tongues remember and he was living with another man's wife and had a couple of kids that was a conduit Satan but s he said that man was full of the devil so there's Supernatural gifts coming through a devil possessed person but it was a conduit there Satan is very spiritual Satan is not something in a barroom or something like that he's very spiritual he's highly spiritual and in this day and age he's so close to it would deceive the very elect if it was possible but we know it's not going to deceive the very elect but now look the one that fashioned us came amen remember I told you where it says God created that word created means fashion see the one that fashioned us that's why and pull up Revelations 3:14 and we've been through this before but I'm coming to a point here but in Revelations 3:14 and to the angel the Church of the layout of sins right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now Jesus Christ wasn't a creation as you would say creation like we weren't one hello right we we weren't created in Genesis 1 126 from nothing and then something we were fashioned in other words something God pulled everything together and said here's my children they always existed with him because if he had a beginning he's going to have an end right all right so we see here the beginning of the creation of God and then brother Brown says we are the continuation of that creation I didn't bring that quote but that's you you should know that but now what is that creation back to it brought Genesis 1 126 Out of Heaven to Earth CU we're not made to be Spiritual Beings it's not what the prophet said he said Angels were made to be Spiritual Beings he said you're made to be a human amen yes sir how simple but he wants us to be human beings so here is that here is that power or here is that way back right here on the earth and we're there with him in him that's why I said remember he was the fullness of the godhead B Because all the fullness was in him the fullness of what us that's right all of us were in him that's why he can be the fullness of the godhead bodily we can we're we're we're out here now we're we're in a multiplied form out here but remember when we go back to Oneness with God which is brother BR said in Oneness he said it's Adam Eve and God he said that's true Oneness now we look at it is like the denominational World they see three we see one but there's three people standing there but if he got the new birth then it's just God made manifest in another form called a bride so all that fullness was in him The Offspring of God was now being able to come back into power right but now remember we're going to read in just a few minutes how that that character of that man was eat down Through the Ages and brother Dale speaking on that now I thought I'd kind of bring that in too in with this because there was Jesus Christ all the attributes of God all every attribute of God was in Jesus Christ amen John 17 pray the father that that that you be like me and I be like you and they be in you and I be in them it's hard to understand but it's not really I and you and you and me right I and you you and me that's a revelation right that's true Oneness you and me you would think it'd be two but remember when God saw Adam and Eve he saw one amen they were so much one he saw one person and when he sees you and I he he doesn't see us like that he sees us as one he sees us as the fullness of the godhead bodily as brother Dale has been preaching the fullness of the godhead bodily because we are all of God for our part right brought together in a multiplied form that we can see that we see I think God sees us all as one if you're born again you're born again but now look there has to come something though when God brings this stature together he doesn't just stay on the foundation brother Al he he faith is fine that puts you in the body that that gets you into the kingdom that gives you the new birth but that attribute let me just put it this way remember the Son of God didn't take the book in Revelations 5 and it may be a little farfetched for some of you to to realize but the son of God was the spirit that's Spirit God that's the God that was down into the church ages as the Holy Ghost okay but now there was a man come up and took that book in Revelations 5 there was a human cuz he bled he was a bloody lamb but it was a human it was the son of man that's why the son of man has to come back into power in the end time because it's the word made flesh again amen all right in a group of people all those other ones that have went on there they were under the Son of God dispensation where they had the new birth and they had the Holy Ghost just like you and I do but they were not able and and I'll I'll emphasize this in just a minute the Bible says loose the seals they were bound somewhere and he's going to loose them all right so now let's go let's read number one but just keep that in your mind because on the day of Pentecost the kingdom started coming into po everybody understand that say Amen that when it's the new birth on the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room there was 120 offsprings of God all right I'm not talking about second person same person all right it's just that Genesis one heading to its final destination because remember once sin happened brother Gary there's no way we could go back to Genesis 126 like the Genesis 126 says at that time right Dominion replenish multiply all sure we do that in a perverted form now does everybody see that we do that in a perverted form we multipli and replenish the Earth we've subdued it man's taken over this world but it's Satan's eeden it's what Satan has done everybody understand that right cuz remember Satan can he's not an original of anything right right he's a perverter of anything if God brings something if God brings this Genesis 126 person into being then Satan's right there to bring something like it he can't touch it but he can bring something like it all right it's what we were talking about that Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts sure he can on the only ones at the end time it's the true Holy Ghost through an anointed person that's of the devil brother randam said all right so there's a conduit that Satan can use that's why it's so hard to to realize that if you've got the new birth sure you're you're immune to certain things but you're not immune to everything right you can still sin you can still do things wrong you can still have bad thoughts and bad days and all those things that's just a human when we come down here to get into this part that's where all that is um had a brother not too long ago uh even uh he's he's trying to preach to his group sinless Perfection and he even said this is a quote out of his mouth he said he said I wish brother brandham had have never made that quote about remember brother BR said this thing will be sticky until the day we're changed now I want y'all to realize something we are going through a gradual change but it's not that this arm's going to change first and then then my leg's going to change no the Bible says changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this whole being is going to be changed all right so it's not going to be just part of my mind is going to get where I don't have any bad thoughts I mean I can't I can't see how a preacher could stand up in a pull pit and say I wish brother BR had said that wish he had have said that I think he was telling the honest truth he was a human he knew he was a prophet stood right there with God but he knew he had problems so do you and I but the rest of this creation Now look he started there in Genesis what we were talking about was fashioning and developing and bringing something together to bring it to Earth and put it in Earth yeah that was the whole deal bring it to Earth and put it in Earth that's what he did he brought it to Earth put it in Adam right 27 man brought it to Earth and put it in now exactly what's he doing now he's working right back the same way amen he's come to Earth brought us the word and he's putting it in earth right so it didn't stop God's plan it just kind of lengthened it a little bit kind of let a lot of other people come in what a gracious God we serve Glory all right let's look at number one let's read this I want you to I want you to watch because I think where we're missing it at we're we're speaking of all these things and and and the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily I agree 100% but do we believe it right now yeah right to believe it's right now or do you believe when we get good enough it's coming this thing's been done since the foundation of the world signed sealed and delivered but we had to go through this Final Destination to get I mean to get to this Final Destination we to go through a journey all right we had to live and and look at the attributes of God that are being displayed instead of just father I really appreciate God doing that because we see him in all the other attributes but watch this right here power of transformation 1965 now also we find out that when he come in talk about Satan he deformed that seed and he corrupted that seed now he didn't bring a seed he just corrupted it by getting into the Bing ground which was e even corrupted that seed with a corruptible seed before it could get there to corrupt that beautiful Garden of Eden where where Heaven the only thing that that is is just the restoration where we are now we are on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God Amen you believe that right amen we still believe the prophet okay back to the Garden of Eden again husband and and wife without without any sin or anything to live eternally all right now watch this one for all of you that think that something's coming number two 1956 is not after the seals this is before fellowship with God through reconciliation you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God and God Longs for his creature who he created in his enemies now what's he going back to Genesis 1 he created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you love to have lived in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he's asking a question to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with them wouldn't that be marvelous we all would like to have that time but read that red letter now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God next week in 20 years tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship now he had no problem seeing us restored right he had no problem 1956 the seals hadn't opened the seals had not been loosed wow number three law in Chicago Illinois God's Great holy Spirit moving in the hearts of people now who he's talking about now everybody understand that he's talking about now I shorten these a little bit for a Time bringing that Eve and Adam together again in their perfection God's holiness God's Perfection God's Great Holy Spirit now that is that what you receiv received with a new birth amen amen so you receive God's holiness you receive receive God's Perfection I said God's Perfection okay not yours God's Perfection you're being perfected by what's in the earth remember he came on the earth to go in the Earth all right now he's got to restore that Earth back now let's read number four and then we'll make a few comments Feast of the trumpets we quote this one so let's quote it again 1964 now while that group is a writing making themsel ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them there's another group being made ready we always talk about the Devil's writers and the devil's people making things ready well you know as we teach it around here and and uh brother Dale in the 80s there brought out the uh the seals is for the Redemption of of the of the Saints it's not for anything to do with the devil yeah sure it exposes him but it's for our Perfection that's why the seals were Loos the seals weren Loos to show you what the devil was it showed you who you were and that showed who the devil was all right cuz remember will you see it in opposition anything that's in you that's in opposition to God you know one thing for sure that's the devil all right after a while Revelations 19 the next time the church is heard she comes also but not upon exact horses but the Bible said he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon White Horse is that right while this group down here has got 2,000 bound at the river Euphrates has been bound for 2,000 years also that church has bound the Holy Ghost right for nearly 2,000 years under martyrdom back there that's right see they had the power they had the Holy Ghost but they didn't have the character to go with it not totally all right martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work it didn't say it didn't have the Holy Spirit he said it can't work right in the church because of man-made systems like brother was talking about the life came through those churches come on the two shoes had life that's where the life come from you cut it down you don't have anymore so that had the life in it stop then you come out to the full grain but it's got to come back to the grain it's got to come back to watch this but she is going to be liberated amen she is coming back that's what the Bible said and these two meet one another on the Battleground l Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years almost almost 2,000 years the Holy Spirit can't work in the church why because of Creeds and dogmas for the things that we have have bound you see where it says bound and then we see where the seals loosed all right but you see that you say what's this got to do with Genesis 126 man well that 126 man listen the Genesis 126 man doesn't need Redemption we've already said that okay the genesis6 man is perfect the Genesis 126 man is the word Amen period Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God and Word was God and that word came on Earth and went in Earth in 14 and the Word was made flesh sure that is for Jesus but we got to realize that's for me and you right that's why the Son of God down through the church ages couldn't work like he wanted to the son of man had to come back cuz he'd been bound the Holy Ghost is the Son of God everybody understand that say Amen all right remember he was son of man he died son of man he rose Son of God well see when he come back on the day of Pentecost there was the son of God made manifest sure it was God in flesh right but it wasn't God in flesh to loose the seals everybody understand that it's like talking about the other day uh you got to see that uh somebody made an analogy and I like it it's it's like an onion peel if you ever tried to really peel an onion it's just real thin it's kind of like kind of like the you know the pages in The Bible but you keep pulling it back you see more of the onion right okay so that's the same way with God this Genesis 126 man has always been in power but when it when the fall happened and God had to do what he did come the way he did in flesh and put us in flesh there was still a barrier there right 126 couldn't work in its fullness because remember 126 worked in his fullness in Adam right amen amen move tree go lay down I'm going to name all these animals I'm going to do this there was no fear okay so there was the power and Adam had the character but he didn't have all of it cuz he was n the fullness of the godhead bodily that's why the fullness of the godhead bodily had to come Jesus Christ himself had to come with us in him all right Adam was going to be able to speak the word maybe and us come into being but he wasn't the Big G he was a little G the Big G had everything in him little G Adam had a part but now remember when we're taking it back to the Garden we'll read it in just a little while in Christ the mystery God reveal but the son of man is what the reason the son of man had to come back in the end time is to bring all the attributes of that 126 man not not not from somewhere else that's our problem we think we got to get it from somewhere else the inexhaustible Fountain is in you tonight if you're born again GL the whole Genesis 126 man that you were back before the beginning of time is in you if you're born again it's not coming from somewhere right if it's coming from somewhere you're not born again right that's what I told him I said I'm sorry I Church means more to me than than anything right right the Bible says and much more as the day approaches now what's our problem do we not think the day is approaching cuz if you don't go to church more now than you did 6 months ago or a year ago you don't think the Lord's coming right I'm sorry I told him downstairs I said you're either backslid or lost one of the two yeah backslid or lost hey I I feed it to them in Sunday school and they must like it cuz they fill the room up so but I try to tell them the truth like Daddy I don't soft soap it I don't want to I don't want the devil to pull something over on he's already pulled enough over on us he pulls enough over on me to make up for you he don't pull anything over on you he's done it to me twice but now remember let's get back to Revelations 5 when those seals were loosed that loosed it didn't take and give power remember power was given to the devil to do things it never says that about us right we have the power sister Gale we have the power right brother BR said you have enough power to go create a world why cuz you got that in you the Creator's in you but the bar is we can't do it right now say it again sister Trudy unb thank you amen unbelief right that's the bar right because remember if you're born again tonight you are creating another world you are creating another world and you are going to live on it cuz when John saw the holy city what did he see he said it look like the bride amen Adorn for a husband right so it was all the bride so you're building your own part of the Kingdom that's why I say we we we've got this problem where where we think we got to go get something we already got it in us right I I just want us to release it get it out let it work let it do the things it's supposed to do but now remember it couldn't happen in the first age it couldn't happen in the second age couldn't happen in the third age because number one the fullness had got here yet right now remember we're not the fullness but I'm talking about our part of the fullness hadn't got here yet remember there was promised seven Church ages right can't can't do away with God's word but we were still in this earth while all these promises were being made but you and I God saw us come in this last age to bring and then he brought a prophet to speak to us not 1964 people not 1965 people he said it's gone from you you're not going to get it it's not even for you right well who was it for then was he wasting his time no it was for somebody to pick up the voice sir right amen what it was at Genesis 1:26 man hearing right from the Creator again but it had to be a son of man to loose the seals because it had to be a flesh man right it's just too simple like brother brandom said it's just it's just God and simplicity the reason that we see that we act different come on baby people we're supposed to anyway than the other ages we're supposed to act different than the other ages even Paul Paul said I see through a glass Darkly they without us not be made perfect he's G he's prophesying he's prophesying he's prophesying who are we prophesying about I want to know we don't get up and prophesy anymore this is a reality amen that's our problem we look looking for another prophecy to come we may not be in our own we know in our own psyche we're not looking for another Prophet to come or looking for but I told him a long time ago and and it goes out on the internet and you can listen to it if you want to Satan's going to bring somebody in this message you hear what I said Satan he's going to give him Supernatural gifts he's going to give him a healing campaign and the people are going to flock right to that man like you've never seen it before and they ain't going to care what he preaches right you mark my word somebody that's what 90% of the people are waiting on is for somebody to raise up and do what brother brandom did right not this church amen you know why because they're waiting we're not waiting right signs and wonders are okay but to be the expressed attribute of God right is what God wants God wants his kids to act like kids because they are his kids and I ain't talking about kids I ain't talking about kids I'm talking about the children of God Richard back there laughing right but now remember you remember we went through and and let's pull them up and and look at them because I was looking at them the other day and this is what I was getting to we're doing this um series on the Statue of a perfect man downstairs and we're bringing Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godl brotherly kindness and I kind of wanted to bring in let's look up let's look at created Brother Anderson must be with the baby no baby's back there okay but now look and I want you to look at these because remember this is the whole part that we've been talking about in Genesis 1:26 and we're going to read through them and then we're going to make a few comments because to me I think now probably the greatest outside the seals the greatest sermon brother Brown preached was the Statue of a perfect man yeah because he didn't bring the power the power was already here brother Brown did not change the way the New Birth come he did not change the way we get the Holy Ghost right and he didn't come to bring us a new Holy Ghost that's right it was the same Holy Ghost it was the power but now he's putting character on top of that power because power without character is satanic right but Power with character is fit to rule but now could we say power without the virtues and that's what it was it God wasn't going to wasn't going to let Peter stand up on the day of Pentecost and him just get born again like the 3000 Peter wouldn't had nothing to say right cuz remember in the to 3,000 said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved that's all they knew what to say but Peter gets up and preaches them a sermon why Peter had the virtue Peter had that he had when the Holy Ghost came and quickened what he held that's right that sound familiar Quicken what he held he used that not as a satanic power but as a power of God as a conduit to get that power back to that 3,000 downstairs 3,000 downstairs had no power that's right before they were born again they didn't even know how to get it men and Brethren what must we do to be saved they were lost that's right but Peter showed them how to get there but now watch created remember God created man in his own image so this word created is to shape fashion create always with God is subject of Heaven and Earth of individual man and watch this one of new conditions and circumstances so God fashioned this Genesis 1 126 man not create is what we said from nothing to something he's bringing it out into a new condition and a circumstance because see at Faith and on the bottom of the pyramid now I'm not going to put all these together that's what that's why I believe the Lord said well let them figure it out let you do a little studying cuz I'm going to tell you that that word when you see number one there and created go back to your new birth the beginning of the creation of God and you're the continuation of that creation your beginning of the creation of God was the day you got born again it wasn't the day you were born on the Earth it was the day you got born again God put you in a new condition and Circumstance he shaped you he fashioned you is that okay so there's the bottom of the pyramid then if you go all the way up to the last one Dominion remember the last thing he said roll it all the way up we'll not get we we'll read those later me going up right there Dominion to rule brother BR said how does a Christian rule right that's right with love see when we see these and we see dominion and rulership we think oh this no no that's love right that's the love of God right so you see the first and last so then you put Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you read through those you do a little homework cuz look watch these things God created and it's kind of it's kind of outstanding that there was eight of these what I call blessings on this Genesis 126 man and there's also you say oh no there's seven sure there's seven ads in the Statue of a perfect man but there's eight manifestations I I was thinking about today you know you got to have those eight manifestations if you stay at seven then you stay just you stay Earthly sure we know that's completion but but remember brother brandham takes and puts us in an eighth day amen he puts that holy city in an eighth day right so Adam and Eve was potentially you hear me potentially was in an eighth day I said potentially cuz they didn't have Eternal bodies but potentially they were heading toward that Brother Gary they were heading toward something we're headed toward something I hope but look at this image likess reflection what does that happen in the Statue of a perfect man what are we reflecting Jesus Christ look blessed to be adored to pray fruitful to show fruitfulness or to bear fruit well that's absolutely the fruits the statue of a perfect man amen that's why I'm telling you nobody taught this down through the church ages nobody Peter put it in the word of God but nobody brought that together to show that those were the virtues of God surely they sure I'm sure they read it and said well we need to be like God cuz it say godliness we need to be like this we need to do this but brother Brandon breaks those down and tells us he says look these are requirements why he knows we got the power but without the character we're not going to take a body change if we don't have the character let me just put it down in simple terms you're not going to take the body change at Faith right you're going to get your body changed at Faith yeah you understand what I'm saying because you're going in the ground and you're going to get your body changed but to get a body changed here on the earth see that Genesis 126 man if all his power was released because remember listen listen to me when Jesus stood on Earth after the resurrection he said all power in heaven now where were we where were we at that moment right if you're a Christian if you're born again tonight where were you when Jesus said all power in heaven and in Earth has been given unto me right and he was standing there in a glorified body oh it ought to make you happy that's why I like the Bible says we're preserved in him right that's where we were we were preserved in that man and when what he said brother Chris I'm just going to try to believe from now on that he's talking to me sister Gil right that he's telling me that you know who I believe Jesus stood up and he said devil all power you ain't got this baby no more it's ain't yours I have got the title deed back well now remember the title deed was a book of names it wasn't the title deed to the Earth like like I bought a car from brother Mark and he gives me a title and now I got a car he didn't lose the Adam didn't lose the title deed to the Earth like he had to give him a deed right no he lost ability for me and you to come that way so what is Jesus saying when he gets here all power in heaven and earth been given unto me amen and where were we we were right there inside of him amen not a second person not a third person right fruitful multiply to become great to increase greatly exceedingly to make great to enlarge to do much wow that word multiply now what are we doing with these same with the virtues somebody got to come to that position to bring others right exactly that's where the multiplying is coming from Peter on the day of Pentecost one man preached a 40 minute sermon that's what the prophet said a 40 how you knew that I don't know a 40 minute sermon and 3,000 people right that's right what a sermon accepted Christ 3,000 people from One sermon we we hardly can stay awake for one well somebody said amen I believe we're just missing it I believe we are looking for something to happen or or or or we maybe that Genesis 126 will will come into power sometime if we keep thinking that that's if we keep thinking that we're either going to go to the Grave or we ain't got to start with cuz somebody's got to become the positive when Jesus stood and said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me he did not turn around and see if anybody believed it brother Chris he believed it himself amen remember what brother Bram said even God when he created the world he said he just believed himself he just believed brother Bob he just believed that when he said it it happened what about us but you come through watch replenish fullness abundance to be full to be accomplished to be ended I like that one right because this is the finality this is the final destination of the Genesis 126 person is to replenish this Earth and subdue it right to subject and Dominion is to rule let's read number five statue of a perfect man these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are now I'm sure he's pointing to the church ages don't you everybody okay with that these fellas he's pointing at the church ages wasn't required what these fellas are this wasn't required what this was I believe he was pointing at church agents now is that okay I'm not putting any words in his mouth but what fellas is he talking about he's talking about the church down through the church ages but he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his people up what through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost did y'all notice the other day brother Bob brought out an outstanding statement last Wednesday about the uh Pope and the Methodist signing the decree in 1999 then in 2006 I mean the lutherans and then in 2006 the wans right and then in 2013 it's when they got to the Pentecostal people do you know that seven years between every one of them yeah see Satan has a completion too right he's got a completion it was from 1999 to 06 is 7 years from 06 to 2013 7 years right could there be in the next seven years that we get out of here I sure hope so I ain't looking for seven years but could it be because remember Satan's a copy cat always he always copies after all right then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue seek come up knowledge Temperance patience godliness Brotherly Love add brotherly kindness then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now remember a lot of people have form doctrines around that that you don't get the new birth until you get to where it says holy spirit now we know that's false right cuz brother Bown says and and and you know what let me put it this way it doesn't matter what brother Brown said about it I know that when I got born again I was born again at Faith right cuzz I didn't have virtue I had to acquire that right that was something that had to be birthed in me all right it wasn't that I had all it's like even even brother Buster across the street he's one he's been listening to my or watching my um Sunday school class downstairs and he said I thought you you got all that when you got born again he said but you proved that through the Bible that that's not true so he's teaching his people right that they need virtue after they become a Christian that they need knowledge after they become a Christian now where they are in the body that's God that's that's for God to place them but at least they knew something that they previously didn't know all right but he said he you know he appreciated it and I do I appreciate people listening and taking it instead of just it just being a formality but you need to pray for him too his wife said the other day I saw in the restaurant to really pray for him because he's got a lot of fluid and he's retaining fluid he was in the hospital not too long ago but he's out so just pray for him he he's a good brother he's a good he's a good guy the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism now that doesn't mean you got a false one and then you got a true one like it says the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God not as in true versus false but it brings us now remember see right here because it says and you got all these virtues sealed in you see you get the Holy Ghost as a baby right you act like a baby right cry like a baby walk like a baby but when you get here this is the Holy Ghost himself this is the true person not that you didn't get the true person but this is the true person working in your person right all right is that okay that did I say that all right I mean it's it's the Holy Ghost the whole time but what it is remember if if it was bound in the church ages who bound it right people religious people the devil didn't bind it religious people bound it I just got that myself religious people bound it through Creeds and dogmas so can we be doing the same thing yes we can right all right but when you see this comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get all these virtues sealed in you sealed in you right then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place amen now look paragraph 342 I made that real big they didn't make it real big least real big on mine because remember remember when a man possesses these kind of things right what the virtues possesses possesses that means it's mine right you give it to me it's mine right when a man possesses see that's what I'm telling you you've got the new birth if you're born again if you got you've got the new birth if you're not I hope you don't sleep till you get it I hope God stirs your water so hard till you don't you can't sleep and you just God just here I am amen and all of us that's been born again we need to say the same thing too right God fill us some more right but when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him right it's another anointing that's what I was saying the other day they there like that onion peel let me get back to that because there there's things for the ages everybody got me right now there's things for the church ages there's things for the Born Again believer but when this message come there will something come on top of that amen so we can talk about the new birth and it being baby form but we can talk about the new birth and it be it the Holy Spirit and not have a problem with that amen amen so it's not brother Bown didn't bring us something new let me put it this way Christ didn't come to bring us our inheritance is that right he came to get us the way back to that inheritance now let me be easy with this the Holy Ghost through brother brandham did the same thing cuz if we've been bound we were bound under Creeds and dogmas all of us were and sure it was loosed by Christ but it had to come through not the son of man but a son of man which was God in human flesh so are you if you're born again but brother brandham was a conduit to bring us to our inheritance now our inheritance from William brandham come on was a change of the body now that wasn't Paul's commission right that wasn't irenius that wasn't Martin that wasn't columus that wasn't Luther that wasn't Wesley that wasn't their commission so brother Bram didn't bring us a new way is that okay without making him God he wasn't God but he brought us back to God Amen He restored he was a restorer amen He restored us back if we'll just listen to him right here when a man possesses listen to the things he says when a man possesses these kind of things right then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God has got you might do that but until these virtues here go into you right you're still off the real true foundation of Faith right exactly wow and you got the new birth at Faith but the real true foundation Brother Gary for us is to body change so we've got this layer that we that we see that that this layer of the new birth that we have and that put the people in the body of Christ that brought that Genesis 126 back in power partially CU remember they bound it brother Dale the other day the true bride went to NAA well see they went back and bound it right the de I mean it wasn't the people in the bars that bound it right it was the religious people it went back to their churches that's right and took Holy Father Son Holy Ghost baptism God winked at that ignorance those people had the Holy Ghost that's that's kind of hard to understand but it's a truth Martin Luther had the Genesis 126 man inside of him but that Genesis one man never literally baptized anybody in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost CU that's contrary to the word so it was contrary but Martin Luther bound it by his Creeds amen that's right you and I that's what brother Dell's doing every Sunday right he's getting our old Creeds and ideas sure we have the power sure we have the new birth that's the one layer of the onion peel right but there a lot more layers sir for us to build on to go to this stature of a perfect man so God's give us this final Journey or this final destination of the just Genesis 126 man sure the finality of the journey is is the future home CU that's and I'll read that in just a minute but now to get that finality we got to have something here right right we're not not going to get a change of the body in the future home we're not going to get a change of body in the Millennium right some will in the future home get a body change after they go through the white Throne judgment they'll get a body change right we get ours right here cuz this is where the Genesis 12 126 man was supposed to do everything right here on this Earth this is where we were to rule and Reign and subdue it and replenish and multiply I you're not getting it maybe you'll get it if I say it 15 more times you're supposed to say it 17 times I've already saying it twice but maybe with a visual we'll cut some of it down look when a man possesses all these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but he didn't leave us out on a limb but when these virtues grow in so in other words they're not instantaneous they grow in amen all right you grow in Grace and knowledge and you add that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol amen the prophet said paragraph 3:44 but when we not in an IM see what he's trying to do he says up there in 342 when a man possesses watch this but when we not in an imaginary way in an imaginary way we can say we've got virtue and faith and knowledge and Temperance and we got this and we've got that in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living God makes a living man not a dead man a living man a Living eny Image in in the stature of God right what's he doing the same things that Jesus did I should have read letter that one the same things that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary things there's a reality that proves that's like we're on patience and brother Brown spent more time on temp and patience than he spent on all the others in the statute of a perfect man book he Temperance is where he said we fall off patience is where he said we fall off but see in in patience possess you your soul the Bible says possess ye your soul right in patience that's what we've got to come to that's why I said this statue of a perfect man to me has become more of a reality instead of just I got to have faith and I got to have virtue and I got to have knowledge no no it's a requirement but it ought to be like brother Brown said not an imaginary thing but a possession right our problem is our problem is it's become imaginary yeah well one day I'll get that when this certain thing happens I was thinking today when California sinks I'll just get better when this happens I'll just get better or when boy start speaking in tongues I'll start speaking in tongues no that's our problem that's our problem we're throwing it off on somebody else or someone else Jesus said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me like I said he didn't look around to see if anybody agreed with him right it becomes to an individual now watch this number six revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book when we see that when these last of Israel have been joined in love to the Lord and the enemy has been destroyed God will prepare His Holy Mountain his new Garden of Eden for the bride and his and her attendance for the Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the Earth as Adam and Eve were in the garden as Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve true church right will fulfill all the plan of God Amen that's what's left for us to do that's our final destination fulfill the plan of God now the on just went on the grave they can't they fulfilled their part but the ones are still alive we got to part it we got to fulfill we're still part of the plan Christ The Mystery of God revealed number seven it's a revelation it's as Eternal as God's word is eternal look but the three-fold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed he didn't say it's going to be right exactly he said is revealed amen 1963 God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order right see in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden oh my let me read that one more time God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition right in the Garden of Eden oh my sometimes we miss these little quotes number eight future home then in this new Earth let's look at it for a few minutes in this new Earth the skies will never be black again no that's from the curse see never be black again with angry clouds winds will never blow across her again like that you know why that happens now there's no atoms on the earth to stop it right come on Adam could stop that when he was in the garden amen Adam could stop that when he was in the garden now we've seen it in his partiality here already we've seen it in individual we've seen it brother bradam we've seen it in our own church but remember God wants this thing to pop like firecrackers amen like the Roman Candle One go up eight go off out of that eight eight goes off of one eight goes off another eight goes off another he doesn't it's not for one man right it's not for one man it's not a one man show now she'll never tear up the trees and tear up the houses and turn over the things lightning and the Wrath will never belts from Satan that cross there and kill a man walking down the road or burn up a building see no no more there'll be no more typhoons sweep down or storms and tornadoes tear up houses and kill little children and things uhhuh won't be no more trying to destroy it won't be there Satan is cast out now where's he got to be cast out first right here right so you see why this is happening don't you cuz Satan's not all the way cast out of here right I'm talking about this man right all right wish we had time now I'm just passing scriptures now so it won't be too late I got to pray for the sick paragraph 274 Heaven and Earth heavens and earth have met remember the Bible always says Earth it says Heaven's plural but it only says Earth CU there's only one Earth right Isaiah 44 says I am God I made the Earth to be inhabited and you know what that's the way it's going to be this Earth is going to be inhabited by his people Heaven and Earth have met heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun amen see all the curse is gone just like listen just like now he's not putting this maybe so hope so when we get there it'll be so just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you not maybe not in a form not in a type literally see you don't accept it it accepts you amen see because it's God's attribute what we've been talking about see if it's the holy ghost means God's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose there's Genesis 1 there's the Final Destination see yet you were born in sin but God had that attribute and here you express yourself here on Earth and he comes down and gets you see you're back here here is where you belong see this is not where we belong not in this part not in this part of the earth not in this sin that's why it's all got to be wiped off here is where you belong sin has lost its power Glory huh sin has lost its what power that's right the desire of sin has gone from your heart right when the Holy Spirit comes in you are going to be a restored person oh that's not what he said you are a restored person let's stand stand to your feet we either going to have to start believing it are we going to keep falling by the wayside I I like I said we talking about patience Paul ran the race he said with patience we have to have patience brother Brown said with God first right not with each other with God right knowing that he'll do what he said he'll do amen but I like that where the Bible says in patience possess ye your soul now that's the real you that's the theophany that's the real person amen amen possess ye your soul in patience study the virtues put it with this Genesis 126 because you know what that is exactly where these virtues come from right they come from that Genesis 1:26 theophany that God Amen fashioned before the foundation of the world knew you were going to be here knew where it was going to land and you know what he knew how you'd act when it got here for you you'd either take it and just have faith and be measurable or you would take it and have faith and then have virtue so you can give it to other people so you can have knowledge of what God said because you know what Genesis 126 man doesn't need knowledge it is knowledge it is the knowledge of God how can it be learning it's not learning it it the Genesis 126 man is not a learning is not a learning person hello Genesis 126 man's got virtue it's got knowledge but we bind it by our Creeds and dogmas right that's very important cuz you know what when I used to read that quote I thought well that was denominations did did that brother Mark that no no no no that's right here that's our own Creeds and denominational ideas brother Dale's been preaching it for years it's not out there it's not the denominations out there so when we set up here right our own thoughts and our own ideas on the word of God let's sing us 211 red book 21 fountain filled with blood amen
