TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you and good morning we battled it out this morning we drove and we're here and we made a choice to come and and Worship the Lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning isn't it see if we can get this on there we go um this first one's a little bit small so just hang in there with me and I'll read it and we'll just kind of get this started I wanted to read this quote um as we continue on our study of Cain and Abel because really the whole story of what happened in in Genesis is a story about choice and uh this this might be kind of something to set the set the tone for this little Sunday school lesson this morning um brother Branham and thy loving kindness was he was he was having an altar call and he asked everybody to raise their hands if they wanted to give their life to the Lord and then then he asked them you know those that Rose your hands come on up to the front come on up and he was surprised as he was preaching that a lot of people that raised their hands wouldn't come up so he was he began to talk to them like hey like I'm are you really sincere about it did you know you raised your hands but then you don't want to come up you don't want to make a move unless let's see what he said now he said I want you people to look here I want you ministers can you see what tear tears the heart of a Preacher can you see what tears the Holy Spirit when people will raise their hands that they'll do that and then we'll sit there and won't move what's left but judgment you'll cry someday when I'm gone you remember that I speak in the name of Jesus Christ you'll long to hear these things and we'll never hear them come on come on now I invite you in Christ's name was you ashamed you raised your hand then you wouldn't make a good Christian to begin with that's awful rude but brother it's time that the gospel let us take take off the kid gloves and tell the truth Christ is here he's raised from the dead he's present that's the reason we do the way that we do come on now that's right raise up if Mama says sit down say mama you go with me if husband says you can't go or I'll leave you say goodbye come on we're going that's right that's the way to do it walk right up here and give your personal testimony come down out of the balcony you'd have been backslid you that's done wrong and want to make it right with God these are coming for testimony for healing we're going to have a little Revival started here as soon as you get to your feet and do something about it and now here's the main thing that I just want to kind of belabor this morning God is never going to pull you up in there you're going to walk under your own free will Now isn't that a wonderful thing to think about this morning that that when you believe God is not because somebody beats you into it or forced you or dragged you up to the altar or something because you made a choice that you wanted to accept God into your heart so let's just think about that as we as we kind of study on verse 4 that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and body being dead yes speaketh Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning Lord as we come Lord Jesus that people out and come Lord because they this morning because they were forced to come to church because they wanted to hear from you and Lord they've come with hungry Hearts this morning we just ask that you'll bless them Lord Jesus says As we study these things out and dive into your word Lord God and help us Lord that our hearts will be in the right place Lord God for the word that you've got in store for us today blessed brother Wade is he stood in Lord Jesus and bless all the people Lord God of gathered here today that you'll feed him Lord are we ask in your name amen now you think about that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and Abel made a choice that he was going to obey the revelation of God that he had heard this whole story from Adam and Eve is is about choice that Eve had a choice to go this way or that way and Adam had a choice to go this way or that way and I think really that that to know that to kind of give us Liberty this morning to think about now God the greatest example of a parent I think about this a great example of a parent step back and let his kids make a choice oh you gotta you gotta oh you think how it just messes everything up it messes everything up if like a minister put somebody in a headlock and says you're going to be a Christian it messes everything up if a parent just grabs her kid and said you're going to do what I tell you you're going to be a CR you can't you can't be a Christian that way you can't you can't be a good you can't be a good citizen that way if you just made to do things you know I was I was thinking of um you know uh as my kids leave and go go a different way it just would mess everything up if I just grabbed them by the nape of their neck and said you're going to come to this church do you see if they got to make their own choice they got to make their own way and and God you think about God the greatest example of a parent pulled himself back and said there I'm gonna watch and see what they do and now you the reason I say it should give us Liberty this morning is like a lot of times you know parents they'll you'll feel guilty about the way things turned out and stuff but you know if that was a pretty bad situation that happened in the Garden of Eden and you can't get a better parent than God sometimes you do the very best you can and because everybody has to make their own choice sometimes your kids will make a choice that that you didn't really want them to make but you see it's not necessary sometimes we make mistakes and things but you know when you've done the very best you can you can't you you can and they just they they're gonna they're gonna make their own choice because they have a soul they have a soul and and they're gonna do what they're gonna do and you pray for them and and you you trust that God will bring them back around but ultimately I'm trying to but let's be be freed of your guilt I've heard so many sermons you know coming up and things about people say well it's your fault the way that your kids turned out how about have a little bit of Liberty and trust that even if you made a mistake that God will bring them back around how about have a little bit of Liberty and just trust it even when you've done the best you can that sometimes sometimes they they're gonna because they have their own soul they're gonna do they're going to go their own path in life and it's maybe not your fault sometimes this stuff happens I I I I see I believe the gospel is an encouraging gospel I believe the gospel is a gospel to lift you up and look at this situation and gain gain encouragement from it the situation of this this story that you can look at in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve had a choice and they had their own their ability to go this way or that way Cain and Abel had a choice they had an ability to with the same uh Cain and Abel had heard the same gospel the same stories and they both had the same opportunity to accept or reject and the serpent of seed brother Brown said but by spiritual Revelation Abel knew it was blood so he brought a lamb hacked its throat and it died and God said that's right that's what done it it was blood and you know what blood I'm talking about all right it was blood that did it now watch now all you think Abel coming up realizing that he was in a he was in a situation and he needed a redeemer he needed something to take he needed something to die for him if we could all realize if we could realize that we need a savior that we were like David said I was shaping and iniquity and his sanded my mother can see we could realize that that our our soul was we were born carnal our spirit was carnal our flesh was carnal everything about us with carnal our thoughts are carnal our whole makeup is perverted by our natural birth and we needed something what we needed was a redeemer to come and die for us and give his own blood his life so that that life could come and Tabernacle back in our lives and burn out all the carnality with the Holy Ghost and Fire and see that's what Christ came to die on the cross for us to pay the price for everything that the serpent did and get rid of it right and overcome it oh you see when you're born again that's what that process starts that God is slowly overtake it overcoming your life claiming you and taking you over and burning out every bit of carnality in your life so you think different you walk different you act different like in Ephesians 2 3 it says among whom we all all had in our conversation in time passed in the lust of Flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by nature of the children of Wrath even as others by Nature by your natural birth you just everything was was messed up that's why in John chapter 3 he said as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish and and I want to continue to belabor that point that we believe whosoever whoever wants to has an opportunity not as some say uh you know that that there's only a certain group of people that even has the opportunity no everybody's got the opportunity and we'll see we'll we'll dive into what God told Cain there why don't you do like your brother sin lies at the door and you're going to have you gotta if you've got a rule over it I ought to think this morning that you have an opportunity through what Christ did for you to rule over sin to rule over sin in your life that you don't have to continue being subject to pornography to Instagram addictions to all the stuff that you see on the internet that the smoking and the alcohol and and uh addicted to the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life addicted to your carnality that you can overcome those things by just believing and Lord Jesus Christ for Gods who love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that's what he died on the cross for right an invisible Union the bride of Christ brother Brown said life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book God is the author of Life do you believe that our natural life here we have is just to perversion because it started in the garden of ede it all got perverted it really should be the right life to begin with but it's perverted by the natural birth oh you say well not me yeah I come straight from Adam no it's it's perverted it was perverted by the by Eve taking the wrong thought in her mind every Everybody every person that was ever born was born perverted because ever because Eve's womb was perverted right every person in the world was perverted and came perverted because the in the in the flesh you got all twisted up with all the lines and everything all the lineage it's all perverted and that's why you need a savior the first life or your first Union you were joined in at Birth by Nature a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together Associated together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death how can you miss seeing the serpent seat and from that time brother Brown said it's a perverted birth but when the new birth comes in it corrects that perverted birth and gives the eternal life through the father Jesus Christ yes all to think about what you think what what is the what does the new birth do the new birth corrects your life well we you can't get along with yourself and God gives you the new birth and and it begins to change you that's why we believe in this church that the new birth will change you you know you know all the denominational world says you come to come come as you are come to church we want you to come to church as you are but you ain't going to stay that way you're going to be changed because that's what the new birth is for to correct your carnal nature and change you from the creature that you once were to something new to be like Jesus Christ so what did the serpent seed do as the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh an Ephesian Church age brother Adam said so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and entered introduced or injected himself into the human race I also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race that we are speaking of so let me I just read a selection of quotes that I found about what brother Randall said how can you believe how can you believe somebody that's born from their carnal natural birth how can you believe when there's nothing there to believe with what you got just a carnal mind through mental conception you can't do it to the world and the next quote it's carnal mind it's foolishness but to them that believe it's everlasting life that's why you got to get born again you got to be born again so you can even believe what is being born being born again positions you to believe because now you got the believer the one that wrote the word living inside of you and now when you read the word he's there to interpret the word to you now you can believe it you you can't even believe until you're born again you're believing with your own faith trying to get to a place and but when God puts his life in you now you can read the Bible that's why the Bible the Bible isn't even for the unbeliever maybe we'll bring you to a knowledge that you need salvation but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost then you can read the Bible and understand it a Christian Spirit Bears record with Christ's Spirit brother said see and you'll call everything of God Gods but if you're carnal minded you'll make fun and laugh at the Holy Ghost the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die and the carnal man has a religious atmosphere around him and wants to worship and so forth but his carnal not an unbeliever but a carnal believer and it's the kind was rejected he said you don't know what pleasure is till you really get those carnal Roots out of your heart and get God in there where you can fellowship and worship God and rejoice and sing in the spirit and wash his feet like a real lady or gentleman house under control and your children all obedient say what is Satan's injection do injecting carnality what is the life of God do it overcomes all that carnality it uproots it it gets it out of you that's why he said in a blushing prophet he said bring us back to God not with an injection of Education not with an injection of religious Reformation not in the injection of some kind of man-made theology but an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost sent down from God out of heaven and a Pentecostal experience of burning out the carnality and replacing in there the jewel that's calling there of a son and daughter of God until we do that brothers and sisters we will still have Bob here make up on sexy looking women and men drinking smoking and calling themselves Christians because they don't know no better and in their heart that very root of carnality lays there now I got this picture of the fire of the holy ghost in a in a new believer's heart burning burning out that carnality what's this got to do with the story of Abel because when Abel come with his faith we're bringing that blood offering his faith was accepted by God how was it accepted and we're gonna if we're kind of running out of time here so I just want to I just want to lay this out it was accepted by fire that God came down and consumed that sacrifice just like he consumed so many other sacrifices when they were offered Moses sacrificed and Gideon's sacrificing Solomon the sacrifice at the temple and brother Branham said he accepted Abel's Sacrifice by consuming it he came down with fire and that's how he'll accept your sacrifice your sacrifice where you lay down all the all of your carnality and say I don't want it anymore I don't want my old life anymore I want to die to myself and you come and lay yourself on the altar of self-sacrifice and lay yourself down and God will accept that sacrifice and fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire to burn out every bit of carnality in your life that's right but around said in Ministry explained he said what is sin what is sin not drinking not smoking not gambling not rejecting Church sin is unbelief is that right he that believeth not is condemned already see you're not you did not you're not destroyed or separated from God because you're a sinner you're separated to God from God because you refuse to walk with him to walk in his provided way you got death and life before you just like Adam and Eve Every Man's a free moral agent and sitting here this morning you've got a choice you gotta whatever condition your life is if you're a sinner needing a savior if you're if you're been born again and you're needing the Capstone if you're at the Capstone and you're needing that body change you got a choice you're sitting there you had a choice this morning whether or not to come to church you might have been laying there and in your pains and your aches and stuff but you made a choice to come whether or not you like the preachers or not whether or not you like the choice that the church you had a choice whether or not to get up and come and and and you see that's what brother Brown looks is playing in here everybody is a free moral agent that you have a choice whether to accept or reject just like Adam and Eve every man that means Cain had a choice everybody that had a little bit of King's DNA has a choice because listen listen it's not the flesh that determines whether or not you can make a choice or not it's whether or not you got a soul and I wanted to believe her that point this morning that Cain had a soul even though in his flesh he was you know he had come from maybe that weird lineage and everything and had all something something just to be carnal a little bit something looked like one come from one of them talk shows you know where they're like let's now let's bring out the real father you know in that messed up situation but yeah he had a choice because he had a soul and every man woman and child in this building this morning has a has yeah I I see you laughing I'll give you something to laugh at this morning but it's you've got a you've got a choice because you have a soul the soul is what allows you to make a choice and the tree of life and tree of death is before us all you can take either one you wish to it depends on what tree you eat off of is what you are that's right and God as God created you a free moral agent to do whatever you want to do about it he can't make you love him and he don't force you to love him he can't make you love him oh you see that's why sometimes Ministry we're preaching when we preach we're really preaching from our experience I I never gave my heart to the Lord because somebody forced me into it I gave my heart to the Lord because one day I heard God calling me and it wasn't like a all of a voice but I felt that tug in my heart as you see it's not you know it's I'll just keep reading and the unity of one God and the one Church Brothers said did you think that in this Russia they have got a false Pentecost they are that's the work of the devil they're trying to force all men into communism wherever man has everything commonly do you know that see what the problem with Communism was the problem with Augustine was he was trying to force somebody to believe it but you can't be forced into doing it right they're trying to force all men into communism wherever man has everything commonly do you know that was the condition of the church under the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost of the people sold their possessions and lay them at the feet of the disciples and they distributed them to every man as they had need and now the devil's come around and got into the world and made a political power to force man to do that God does not force man to do anything you do it on your own free will that's what that when brother Brown was witnessing to that that man with the The Apple Tree the Infidel and and he was he was that he you threw that back in brother around his face he said y'all y'all are constantly trying to pull for money trying to get people but brother I'm said but that we do live off people's Free Will offering but we're not forcing them to do that you you see what it would be a mess up if you if you were just forcing people to give money or forcing people to do but we're not forced to do anything we come of our own free will we do of our own free will because we've heard of from God and the God of this evil ladies brother said the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses where five senses rather the Inside Man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside man see taste feels smell and hear but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept What God Says and that'll determine what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world Jesus said if you love the world of the things of the world it's because the love of God has not even entered this inner part Satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God my brother Adam said in the unity of one God and now I've just got two slides and then we'll stop there he said there's so many people today who says that the holy spirit is not real today while tens of thousands of them and millions are saying it's not so there's that many enjoying the blessings of it and we'll just skip down to the end it says he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creature in Christ and that's why Abel brought a lamb because he knew he needed a way back by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh brother Randall said here come a little old Abel pulling that Lamb with a spiritual Revelation that he know that it wasn't fruit that brought them out of the Garden of Eden he knowed it was blood and life don't lay in Plants it lay in blood that's why what did he have a revelation of life he knew he was dead he was dying and he needed life here he come with a little string wrapped around a grapevine wrapped around that little lamb throwed him up there and said this is it lore now that's what faith is Faith is a revelation personally to you and we'll stop on the stop on this thought oh yeah I was thinking this morning of all the times that people have told me that I was my Doctrine was wrong and the things that I believe was wrong now look look back in your own I'm not trying to just make a flipping statement but people will tell you that you're believing wrong or whatever but faith when you can tie it back into every type in the Bible and run through the Bible and know that God has given you a spiritual Revelation that's something that you can hang on to brother Brandon said faith is the will of God and when God gives you a revelation you have the will of God and that is something that you can stand in with his Surety knowing that you know what direction you should go you know what you should do and you know the God that you serve and what church you should go to and where you should work and what the will of God and purpose for God is in your life and that is faith and we'll stop there God bless you [Applause]
