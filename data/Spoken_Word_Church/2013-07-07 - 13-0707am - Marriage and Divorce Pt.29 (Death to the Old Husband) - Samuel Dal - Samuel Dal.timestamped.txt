[0:00] uh speak about it and to try to
[0:04] uh help us to understand where we're at
[0:06] all right so let's read romans 7
[0:09] 1-6
[0:11] no you're not brethren for i speak to
[0:13] them that know the law how the law had
[0:15] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[0:18] but the woman which hath and husband is
[0:20] bound by the law to her husband so long
[0:22] as he liveth
[0:23] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[0:25] from the law of her husband now remember
[0:27] the prophet saying what this is a
[0:33] scriptural thing showing us today this
[0:35] is a time a prophecy of the end time
[0:38] and showing it unto us and he said he's
[0:41] not speaking of necessarily
[0:43] marriage and divorce but he's speaking
[0:45] of the next verse
[0:47] and going on down from there and into
[0:49] verse four see so then if while her
[0:51] husband lives she'll be married to
[0:53] another she shall be called an
[0:54] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[0:56] she is free from that law
[0:58] so that she is no adulteress though
[1:00] she'll be married to another man
[1:02] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[1:04] dead to the law what by the body of
[1:07] jesus christ in other words by the new
[1:08] birth all right
[1:10] that you should be married to another
[1:12] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:14] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:17] god
[1:18] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:20] motions of sin which were by the law
[1:23] did work in our members to bring forth
[1:25] fruit under death
[1:27] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:30] that being dead wherein we were held
[1:32] that we should serve in the newness of
[1:34] spirit
[1:35] and not in the oldness of the letter you
[1:38] may be seated the lord add his blessing
[1:41] to the
[1:41] reading of the word
[1:43] now
[1:48] we have been using the invisible union
[1:52] as a background point to
[1:55] speak from
[1:56] and i believe that in that message the
[1:59] prophet was covering
[2:00] uh the three things that we've been
[2:02] talking about
[2:03] that he was covering in the invisible
[2:05] union uh the point that our old
[2:08] denominate our old husband
[2:11] that is about was had us bound was the
[2:14] world of sin
[2:16] all right our natural nature and the
[2:17] things of being the way we were born in
[2:19] satan's domain
[2:21] made us with an old husband and that
[2:24] husband had to be dead as paul is saying
[2:27] for us to be married to christ by the
[2:29] new birth
[2:30] all right then we went on from that into
[2:33] covering
[2:34] uh that how that the grace of god had to
[2:37] be given on the point of the natural
[2:40] point of marriage in divorce
[2:43] and in seeing that
[2:44] that god would set the people free
[2:48] if they could believe it and accept it
[2:50] but if you don't believe it
[2:52] uh you know it's not for you uh the new
[2:55] birth is not for you if you don't
[2:56] believe it
[2:58] the promises of god throughout the bible
[3:00] is not for you if you don't believe it
[3:02] everything has got to be believed he
[3:04] that cometh to god must they
[3:05] he must believe that god is
[3:08] it's got to be accepted remember went
[3:09] through we went through those things
[3:11] but see then the grace of god to set us
[3:14] free
[3:15] would be that that old husband or wife
[3:18] or husband in your marital situations
[3:21] that god would take that yoke of bondage
[3:24] off of us and set us free
[3:27] by revelation now not as a
[3:30] thing to be just used as we want to it
[3:32] has to be done according to what uh you
[3:36] know the word of god said
[3:38] then now we're trying to finish it all
[3:40] up because that's the point i i've tried
[3:42] to make to you and i on
[3:45] this message
[3:46] you see we think that our biggest
[3:48] problem is uh the situation of marital
[3:51] life
[3:53] but i've never read were in the bible
[3:55] nor in the prophet's message where a
[3:58] marital situation was blaspheming the
[4:00] holy ghost
[4:02] if you have i'd like to see it that's uh
[4:04] you know i've never read it that way
[4:07] it may give you a lot of problems it may
[4:10] uh hinder us
[4:11] and i've preached it as flat and blunt
[4:14] as i could
[4:15] coming down it may even keep us and make
[4:18] us go by the grave
[4:19] you know
[4:20] because we may not be able to have the
[4:22] faith to stand to be changed but that
[4:24] doesn't mean you can't be saved
[4:26] and because of a marital situation
[4:29] but there is ways in god to correct all
[4:32] things if we believe it all right but
[4:34] that to me is not the vital thing
[4:38] the first thing you must have the new
[4:40] birth
[4:41] all right if you don't have the new work
[4:42] then nothing in the bible is written to
[4:44] you don't worry about marriage and
[4:45] divorce until you get born again don't
[4:47] worry about your marital situation of
[4:49] life until you get born again
[4:51] because it's not even to you
[4:54] i
[4:55] that's why the prophet would say for
[4:56] this followers of this message only it's
[4:58] not for the world
[5:00] you can't take these things to the world
[5:02] and tell them they're set free because
[5:04] they're not
[5:06] it's he that the son is set free
[5:08] and the son is revealed word so then if
[5:10] we don't have the new birth then there's
[5:12] no need to even worry about anything
[5:15] all right see but if we can get to that
[5:17] point of seeing
[5:18] that that new birth that brother brown
[5:20] said that old husband died that old
[5:24] adamic nature
[5:27] that we had by being born as we were in
[5:29] sin shape of an iniquity because of the
[5:32] fall
[5:34] that old husband's got to be dead
[5:36] if he's not dead then we're trying to do
[5:39] like you know have two or three husbands
[5:40] one hanging in the closet to wear him
[5:42] when we want to if we're not dead to the
[5:45] world and the things of the world
[5:47] you know of sin
[5:49] then that old husband's still alive and
[5:51] we're just claiming to be christians
[5:53] but we've got to be christians see and
[5:56] and the prophet said
[5:57] god let that die
[6:00] and he gave us the secret of it he said
[6:02] it was put in the sea of his
[6:04] forgetfulness
[6:06] all right which is really you know the
[6:07] scripture is it is as brother kali was
[6:10] reading it there that as far as this the
[6:12] east is to the west our sins it's not in
[6:15] the scripture about the sea of his
[6:17] forgetfulness that's the prophet
[6:19] expressing it to us
[6:21] as to terminologies of our day to
[6:23] understand it all right
[6:25] but see then he said he let it die
[6:30] we were not capable of killing that old
[6:32] man
[6:35] all right
[6:36] and we were not capable of taking care
[6:39] of our marital situations that's right
[6:42] see so god had to come and let it die
[6:45] all right and then when he can let
[6:47] something die as i tried to explain to
[6:50] you everybody else in the world can look
[6:52] at you and see you and he said well i
[6:53] don't see any difference in them
[6:57] they still look just like they looked
[6:58] before the day they got born again
[7:01] you know well if we keep on living in
[7:03] sin then they got a right to look at us
[7:05] and say they got a problem
[7:08] so then if we got natural situations and
[7:10] we're still running around living with
[7:12] two or three partners or doing what
[7:13] we're doing in adultery then that's not
[7:16] dead
[7:17] and god has to let these things die
[7:20] but to me the main thing is what brother
[7:22] branham said of invisible union
[7:25] he said romans 7 is not necessarily
[7:28] about marriage and divorce he said we
[7:29] know the scripture is
[7:31] but said it's a prophecy
[7:34] for the bride and the end time
[7:37] all right a setting in order of
[7:39] scriptures is a prophecy
[7:43] r o p-r-o-p-e
[7:43] h e c y not s y that's why it's the
[7:46] talking part speaking see why is the
[7:48] sitting in order of scriptures
[7:50] and bringing it to understanding of the
[7:53] word of god all right
[7:55] but see the main thing he said is
[7:59] paul is trying to get us to see that
[8:02] you can't be married to the law
[8:04] and be married to christ at the same
[8:06] time
[8:07] all right then we take law as being
[8:10] you say law to 99 percent of the people
[8:12] who want to say 10 commandments
[8:16] the bible speaks of the law of spirit of
[8:18] life made us free
[8:19] the law of this the law of that there's
[8:20] many many laws
[8:22] that's in the bible
[8:25] and see law then we we come to a
[8:27] conclusion of understanding
[8:30] that law is
[8:32] man's ideas
[8:35] placed upon the word of god
[8:38] they chose law but they didn't get what
[8:41] they wanted i told you they didn't want
[8:42] a book of rules to worry that they had
[8:44] to go out and dig ditches
[8:46] you know every day
[8:48] right they didn't want that they didn't
[8:49] want the pots and the pans and the
[8:51] ordinances and things they didn't want
[8:53] that they just wanted to have something
[8:55] to do in their salvation
[8:59] it was just not enough that god had to
[9:00] say you're my people
[9:04] and the way it is today uh you know you
[9:06] you can't it's hard to get people to
[9:08] accept
[9:10] the fact that jesus christ
[9:11] died and paid our price all we got to do
[9:14] is accept it
[9:16] but ain't there something i've got to do
[9:19] that's the same thing you've done in the
[9:20] garden that's right
[9:22] that's the same thing paul is speaking
[9:23] of he's not just speaking of the law
[9:26] of the ten commandments he said the law
[9:28] is spiritual
[9:32] he said but i'm carnal sold under sin
[9:37] see
[9:38] then
[9:39] the prophet goes into invisible union
[9:42] and using that as saying that our old
[9:45] denominational husband
[9:49] must be not divorced
[9:52] but he must be dead that's right
[9:55] all right
[9:56] but brother dale i'm out of organized
[9:58] religion
[9:59] i left the church amen
[10:02] now that's what i told you the first
[10:03] time i left
[10:04] up to gainesville when i walked into
[10:06] that church i said this statement and i
[10:08] still believe it
[10:10] god got me out of the baptist
[10:12] i got up walked out they didn't run me
[10:14] off they wanted me to stay
[10:17] i got up and walked out because i knew
[10:19] the word was contrary to him but i said
[10:21] now lord you've got me out of the church
[10:23] now get the church out of me
[10:26] now watch that as we're trying to
[10:28] conclude the whole point today
[10:31] see then to me the importance
[10:35] is not just to say
[10:37] it's the new birth because we must have
[10:39] that to start with
[10:44] but watch it in a minute when the
[10:45] prophet says
[10:47] we're free from sin
[10:50] but he said we're bound by our creeds i
[10:52] don't have no creeds i'll tell you that
[10:58] i don't have no temper well why in the
[11:00] pyramid
[11:03] does it have the word temperance
[11:05] after you're born again
[11:08] well all i gotta do is tell you the
[11:09] message that's not the knowledge in the
[11:11] statue of perfect man it's holy ghost
[11:14] knowledge
[11:16] that's holy ghost temperance sometimes
[11:19] he said how to control your temper well
[11:21] i ain't got no temper
[11:22] with god
[11:26] why is your face red
[11:28] you know
[11:29] you're trying to deceive everybody but
[11:30] yourself
[11:32] but you see then
[11:33] we look at it and we say but but i left
[11:36] the church system
[11:39] well amen right that's good
[11:44] don't you think that paul
[11:46] had left the church system
[11:50] but yet he said i must die daily
[11:54] what have you got to die daily if
[11:55] everything is so set free and gone
[12:00] see that old husband always wants to
[12:02] come back
[12:07] now
[12:08] if we're set free from organized
[12:10] religion why do we want to play around
[12:12] with their ideas
[12:15] that's a question i've asked many times
[12:17] right
[12:18] why do we want to play with their ideas
[12:20] why do we want to stay with and use
[12:22] their doctrines and their ideas
[12:27] and there was a lot of good ideas
[12:31] but why do we want to go that away and
[12:33] try to organize this message
[12:37] and the prophet said they'll organize it
[12:38] into the lady of sea he said you won't
[12:40] denominate it
[12:41] you don't see a sign stacked out on the
[12:43] front of the church you know
[12:44] branhamites and things you you don't see
[12:46] that
[12:48] he says you'll organize it into lady
[12:49] osea
[12:52] well
[12:54] it's death to start with organization is
[12:57] so the worst of all things is not our
[12:59] new birth
[13:01] although that must be there
[13:03] it is not our marital life situations of
[13:07] human elements
[13:09] but it's whether or not that old husband
[13:12] of denominationalism is dead or not amen
[13:16] and now remember
[13:18] if it's true as the prophet would say of
[13:20] the invisible union that
[13:22] that old husband must be dead
[13:25] of the world for you to be born again
[13:29] because there can't be two living in you
[13:31] at the same time
[13:32] all right
[13:33] now
[13:34] so then if that's true
[13:37] and if it's trued in our marital
[13:39] situation
[13:41] as i've said to you some people believe
[13:43] the new birth took care of those things
[13:45] well if it did why did the prophet have
[13:46] to preach on it
[13:48] i mean what was the purpose of bringing
[13:50] it
[13:51] i know i'm sorry i'm just blunt and i'm
[13:53] just the way i am i just tell you where
[13:54] i stand
[13:56] and that way you can do what you'd like
[13:57] to about it we had a wonderful time last
[14:00] night at the bible study speaking on the
[14:02] rapture but we never got to it
[14:06] we got started
[14:08] and we didn't get to what we were
[14:10] supposed to been speaking on but i
[14:12] enjoyed it anyway i hope you did and
[14:14] lost part of my voice so if i have to
[14:16] put cough drops in today that's fine
[14:19] but now listen
[14:21] see i believe the major thing in our
[14:24] lives
[14:26] why did the prophet say you come into a
[14:28] marital situation
[14:30] what do you say in marriage and divorce
[14:32] he said because of misinterpreted
[14:35] theology
[14:36] we are in this position our condition
[14:39] today all right that means organized
[14:41] religion
[14:46] because of organized religion you and i
[14:48] have got our problems that's right amen
[14:51] now then organized religion you said but
[14:53] organized religion is baptism no no no
[14:56] no no
[14:57] no eve brother branham said tried to get
[15:00] it organized
[15:03] see she had her own idea
[15:05] she set up her own organization
[15:08] even moses smithing the rock the second
[15:11] time when he was supposed to speak of
[15:13] iraq he said brook ever type in the
[15:15] bible and set up an organization
[15:19] amen
[15:20] that's what i gave you what your prophet
[15:22] said
[15:25] we see our problem is organized religion
[15:29] but i've gone from that brother dale i'm
[15:31] out of the church
[15:33] i want the church out of you and me
[15:36] what is the
[15:38] church people's ideas
[15:45] people's ideas i said even the garden
[15:47] set the first organization in the
[15:49] process
[15:50] of what saying i think
[15:54] is that the basis of the profit of our
[15:55] interpretation or thoughts
[15:57] i think
[15:59] when we don't have a right to think
[16:01] well the bible get no the bible doesn't
[16:03] give you a right to think
[16:05] your constitution gives you that don't
[16:07] get the two intermingled amen
[16:10] the bible don't give you a right to
[16:11] think
[16:13] sheep has no thoughts
[16:17] well you sure take it to where we've got
[16:18] to believe you've got to believe what
[16:20] the word says
[16:24] if we don't believe what the word says
[16:26] then what do we need the word for
[16:28] just burn it throw it away
[16:31] because see that's what they've done
[16:32] with it adolf hitler took the bible and
[16:35] put it on the desk that's what we we see
[16:37] the movie versions
[16:40] we see them taken out and burning the
[16:41] bibles
[16:44] no
[16:45] that was not what he started with
[16:46] because he knew better he knew if he
[16:48] burnt that bible
[16:50] at the beginning they would rebel
[16:53] he put the bible on the school desk
[16:56] and taught them the fallacies or the the
[16:59] contradictions the the wrongness that
[17:02] was in the bible
[17:04] then they took them out and burned them
[17:08] go back and study your history you're
[17:10] not even getting it correct
[17:13] you couldn't have took all the bibles
[17:14] and just throw them away you can't do
[17:16] that
[17:17] that's what it's so gradual and so
[17:20] moving now as the things that are being
[17:22] brought to you and i
[17:24] by the religious system of the world
[17:29] as i told you every one of those people
[17:30] that lined up out there when that um 911
[17:33] that took place
[17:36] and they all lined up in front of the
[17:37] white house and sung amazing grace
[17:39] whatever what it was
[17:43] and sung the star-spangled banner of the
[17:45] things they were to put every one of
[17:47] them in jail
[17:48] why
[17:49] because they passed the laws it says we
[17:51] can't pray
[17:54] and they were out there praying and
[17:55] singing
[17:57] but you see it's all a deception
[18:00] to get control
[18:03] adolf hitler he knew what he was doing
[18:06] he put them bibles on the desk and
[18:08] taught them the contradictions that's
[18:10] within it
[18:11] well how about today when all of the
[18:13] preachers in this message
[18:15] are laying it before their congregations
[18:17] every day i'm bad brother branham was
[18:19] wrong
[18:21] that he missed it here and he was wrong
[18:22] here the dates was wrong here and
[18:25] what's the difference
[18:35] you know that's what hell's made for
[18:37] that's right
[18:38] it was made for good people amen that's
[18:40] who's gonna be god
[18:42] religious good people
[18:46] he said well no well they killed jesus
[18:48] for what he believed
[18:51] right
[18:52] but you see my point now
[18:55] organization is a
[18:57] people
[18:59] that come together on the same idea
[19:03] see then they form general motors
[19:06] you know
[19:07] att whatever you know they made
[19:10] organizations by people coming together
[19:13] and then in church systems they came
[19:14] together and made methods baptist
[19:16] presbyterian branhamats lula otts
[19:20] no problems
[19:24] he said well you mean you got problems
[19:26] with lulu yeah we've got blue lights
[19:30] and i'm against blue lights
[19:32] you know i don't like anything on the
[19:34] ice on the end of it
[19:35] it was israel to start with and they
[19:37] made it israelites and that messed it up
[19:40] but get my point of what i've been
[19:41] driving at
[19:44] we think we don't have any organized
[19:46] religion
[19:48] but
[19:48] people coming together with the same
[19:50] idea
[19:51] now let's take a little thought of
[19:54] the people of the message idea
[19:58] you know you tell the women it's wrong
[19:59] to cut your hair and paint your face
[20:02] well i think it's all right to do a
[20:04] little bit here don't you
[20:06] see that's organization
[20:08] you're trying to get somebody to agree
[20:10] with you
[20:11] get your ideas together
[20:15] see
[20:16] and form a statement because of your
[20:18] ideas but do you think you're perfect
[20:22] well the bible says i am amen
[20:26] no the bible says he's none good no not
[20:28] one amen
[20:31] that's right
[20:33] what the bible says i'm perfect
[20:35] see when we take man's ideas
[20:39] two souls two lord seventh under virtue
[20:41] proves his father
[20:44] when we take man's ideas
[20:46] we have organized against the word of
[20:48] god
[20:52] and see the next step is
[20:53] denominationalism
[20:57] because the organization is deaf
[20:59] but you see what i've been trying to get
[21:01] you to see
[21:02] that old husband of organized religion
[21:06] which is our ideas
[21:09] contrary to god's word
[21:12] and you don't have to have no group of
[21:14] people to have an organizational spirit
[21:17] eve had one by herself
[21:22] and it caused all this depth now you you
[21:24] think we can get by with our own ideas
[21:26] and talks
[21:28] organization any kind of an idea that we
[21:30] have contrary to the word of god
[21:34] is an organizational spirit
[21:37] and that's what's killing us but but
[21:39] brother dale i think it's this way
[21:44] why was it right
[21:47] i don't know but i think it's that i
[21:48] just think it i think
[21:51] well show it to me in the prophet's
[21:53] message or in the bible well
[21:55] that's just what i think
[21:57] well who's i
[21:59] you know
[22:01] it's kind of like it was i remember
[22:02] brother branham you know they told him
[22:04] in some country over there said we don't
[22:06] want you over here
[22:10] we'll see he had the idea that that all
[22:12] the churches was against him coming
[22:15] so he contacted somebody you know what
[22:17] he found out it was one person's idea
[22:20] everybody else in the country wanted him
[22:23] come on read the message you heard it
[22:25] everybody else wanted him but one man
[22:28] you know what if brother around him
[22:29] would have took that and not went on he
[22:31] would have went on thinking that the
[22:32] whole country was against him
[22:37] it doesn't take a whole lot to be an
[22:38] organization
[22:40] i hope you've caught that point
[22:42] throughout the series because we want to
[22:44] get the marriage in divorce yes
[22:46] you know we want to get the things
[22:49] in that we want to talk about them
[22:50] things
[22:54] and organize against the truth
[22:57] all right
[23:00] but is that old husband dead
[23:03] and we're talking about some of this
[23:04] last night
[23:07] you know that when martin luther
[23:09] protested the catholic church
[23:11] and i didn't write these later after
[23:13] last night
[23:16] you know that a lot of people came out
[23:18] of the catholic church when martin
[23:19] luther protested the church
[23:21] you know what a lot of them started
[23:22] doing
[23:23] read your history
[23:25] they went back and burnt some of those
[23:26] churches
[23:28] some of those synagogues are what you
[23:29] want to call them
[23:31] mosque or whatever you want to call the
[23:33] words for
[23:35] because they said well luther that's
[23:36] what you wanted us to do
[23:39] he didn't want to have
[23:42] he wanted his own reading it on writing
[23:44] i've got some of it at home
[23:46] he wanted to convert the church
[23:50] he didn't want to leave the church
[23:52] they drove him out of the church
[23:58] he wanted to help him
[24:00] don't you
[24:03] don't you want to help people
[24:06] let's go i don't want to go ain't
[24:07] nothing to do with that old stuff over
[24:09] there get on me don't worry about it
[24:11] it's already on
[24:15] people are scared of spirits don't worry
[24:17] about a spirit it can't get on you
[24:19] it's totally defenseless
[24:24] come on tell me what a spirit can do
[24:26] you can't do a thing unless you let it
[24:32] people are scared of cats
[24:34] well i got blood around for it
[24:38] scared of cats
[24:40] you know why because they're sneaky like
[24:41] the cat
[24:49] i'm doing it as a joke telling the truth
[24:54] i told you about the man up there set in
[24:55] a cage for 17 days at a time with
[24:57] brother richard then
[25:00] sit in there and throw ashes and things
[25:01] on him and came out of there pounding on
[25:04] himself so ain't got one ounce of
[25:05] tradition in this whole body
[25:08] fasting for 17 days or so
[25:12] two sisters used to fast
[25:14] no i i'll probably miss the total amount
[25:16] but they would fast like 25 days out of
[25:19] every 30.
[25:23] but when the truth was presented to them
[25:25] about water baptism they turned it down
[25:31] come on
[25:32] they're right you remember some of you
[25:34] older ones remember people in your day
[25:37] but when the truth was presented of the
[25:39] end time message where are they at well
[25:42] what good was all their fasting and
[25:44] doing
[25:47] it didn't bring them to the lord
[25:50] okay
[25:51] that's organized religion
[25:53] but in martin luther's day they burned
[25:55] the churches
[25:57] that they came out of
[26:02] they thought that's what he was teaching
[26:06] he had to come forth and tell him to
[26:08] quit it
[26:12] so what happened those that came out
[26:14] without a revelation of the just shall
[26:16] live by faith went right back into other
[26:18] organizations or formed their own let's
[26:20] go burn the churches
[26:22] we'll get rid of that catholic church
[26:23] we'll just burn the buildings
[26:27] you don't burn spirits
[26:31] all right
[26:33] they did not see the truth of the just
[26:36] shall live by faith
[26:41] they only had words
[26:43] that made them with actions to do what
[26:46] they thought
[26:49] was right
[26:53] all right
[26:54] now listen
[26:57] i was fixing this to leave this part off
[26:59] but i decided we better go on with it to
[27:01] finish at least this message
[27:03] you know that organized religion
[27:07] according to revelation 17 6
[27:11] i didn't give these for them to pull up
[27:14] but you know that john when he saw the
[27:16] church revelation 17 6
[27:19] he'd honor he wondered with great
[27:22] admiration
[27:26] he had him deceived
[27:33] revelations 12 and 9 says the whole
[27:35] world was deceived
[27:38] by this great
[27:40] red dragon
[27:42] devil satan
[27:47] the whole world
[27:52] now
[27:54] this is what people don't like for me to
[27:56] read or to say
[27:58] what about a system that was so uh
[28:04] great and and looked so great
[28:07] until it even had the profit deceived
[28:11] now there's one you stop on right
[28:18] you mean it had the prophet to see
[28:20] see i'm glad i can read
[28:24] and read what he says
[28:27] john after having the holy ghost for 60
[28:29] years
[28:30] before he goes to patmos somewhere in
[28:32] that order
[28:33] you come from 30 up to
[28:35] 95 or something
[28:39] and he's admires that
[28:41] church
[28:47] something that as we read
[28:49] 9 12 9 did it to deceive the whole world
[28:56] organizationalism deceived the whole
[28:59] world
[29:06] you might be quiet
[29:09] he said well the prophet was he deceived
[29:11] well let's just read and see if he was
[29:12] go ahead brother pull up the number one
[29:14] on the notes and let's just see
[29:17] let's just see if the prophet was
[29:19] deceived
[29:23] taken from the third seal paragraph 151
[29:26] 363 320.
[29:29] as i said shoot a gun if you don't hit
[29:30] the target find where it went off and
[29:32] you got to come back to her and to start
[29:34] again
[29:35] then if you go back and you go to nicaea
[29:39] that's where you start
[29:40] again go back anyway from the
[29:42] organization away from all of that
[29:45] church
[29:46] we've been seeing these seals as
[29:48] perfectly
[29:50] look i've always wondered all of my life
[29:54] why i was so against the organizational
[29:56] system
[30:01] not knowing
[30:03] excuse me not the people
[30:05] the people are just like me and you or
[30:07] anything else anybody else but the
[30:09] system that denominational system
[30:11] and i see it right here i never knowed
[30:14] it till now
[30:15] that's right
[30:18] now
[30:19] he never knowed it until then
[30:23] he said it had him deceived well
[30:25] until 1963 when the seals broke
[30:30] your prophet was preaching
[30:32] the white horse rider
[30:34] was the holy spirit
[30:40] is that enough to understand
[30:43] that he was deceived
[30:46] why because light had never shined upon
[30:47] that
[30:48] you remember the story the pyramid
[30:50] mountain that looked down in to see the
[30:52] fields of things and light had never
[30:53] shined on that so it had everybody
[30:55] deceived
[30:57] and even him
[30:59] he comes for the first seal and he gets
[31:01] ready to preach
[31:02] read your books
[31:04] he said i made a most horrible mistake
[31:07] today if the holy spirit had not come
[31:09] and corrected me on something that i was
[31:12] going to preach
[31:14] what was he going to preach
[31:16] that the white horse rider
[31:18] was the holy spirit
[31:24] now brother dale i don't believe that
[31:25] you just formed an organization because
[31:27] you just done what i said to start with
[31:29] you started your own idea or concept
[31:33] that's what he said
[31:41] see then that way when you come forth
[31:43] with what he said
[31:45] you can see why john admired it
[31:50] i don't believe he was necessarily
[31:51] admiring it because of the beautiful
[31:53] churches
[31:56] you know buildings
[31:59] he admired it because he saw the
[32:01] situation of organized religion
[32:05] you know they're wonderful things this
[32:07] church right across over here feeds
[32:09] people just about every sunday
[32:14] billions of dollars is being spent every
[32:16] year by organized religion churches to
[32:19] feed the hungry
[32:22] are you contrary to that brother dale no
[32:23] and neither was the prophet of god
[32:26] what did he say
[32:27] he said i'm not against
[32:29] the organization
[32:32] he said i'm against the system
[32:37] he said you got to have an organism
[32:42] but you don't need an organization
[32:44] right
[32:46] the system
[32:50] system is man's ideas coming together
[32:54] to form a thought or a concept that
[32:57] they're using
[32:59] a system
[33:01] systematically doing things see
[33:05] all right
[33:07] but he said i i didn't know
[33:09] why i was against organized religion
[33:12] so much until the seals broke
[33:15] he said now i see
[33:22] the whole world was deceived by
[33:26] that system
[33:28] that's according to the bible
[33:29] look at the next one
[33:34] number two which is the first seal
[33:39] 63 through 18 paragraph 33 28
[33:43] he said they wanted it so he would give
[33:45] them a strong delusion
[33:48] okay
[33:50] remember this prostitute of revelation
[33:51] 17 she's a mystery
[33:54] mr babylon the mother of harlots and
[33:56] john admired her
[33:59] just like this man look wait till we get
[34:01] here and watch him watching this horse
[34:04] here
[34:06] and you notice he was what happened was
[34:08] this
[34:09] that he admired her with great
[34:10] admiration
[34:13] what
[34:14] but the mystery was that she drank the
[34:17] blood of the martyrs of of christ a
[34:19] beautiful church
[34:21] set there decked in purple and gold
[34:23] and she had a cup in her hand
[34:26] of filthiness
[34:27] of her fornication
[34:31] now
[34:34] a beautiful church system
[34:38] that had everybody deceived
[34:41] that's organizational religion that's
[34:44] organized religion
[34:47] when you put up a sign and tack it on
[34:49] there bad this method this thing you've
[34:51] denominated that's why they call it the
[34:53] denomination of the baptism denomination
[34:55] method
[34:57] and always
[34:59] an outstanding statement brother random
[35:01] made one time it's long about 62
[35:04] somewhere in there i can surely find it
[35:06] for you
[35:08] he said the baptist has just become a
[35:10] denomination
[35:16] now
[35:17] the baptists become a
[35:19] organizational system of church and
[35:20] anything like that over a hundred years
[35:22] ago
[35:25] but why did they become a denomination
[35:28] because they turned down his message
[35:32] he come to the whole world with a
[35:34] message
[35:35] and they would have not been
[35:36] denominations of the mess this baptist
[35:38] presbyterian pentecostal sometimes
[35:40] had they accepted the message right
[35:43] but when they turned down the message
[35:44] they denominated and totally died
[35:49] yet the system of it had done over 100
[35:50] years old or 200 years ago in luther
[35:56] but you see that's where we can't get it
[35:58] correct we want to follow what we think
[36:03] you mean i don't have a right to think
[36:04] no
[36:07] show it to him in the bible
[36:10] show me the prophet's message you've got
[36:11] a right to think for yourself
[36:14] if you've got a right to think we need
[36:16] to follow you we don't need to follow
[36:17] brother brown's message
[36:20] but we followed a man that didn't think
[36:23] he waited until god spoke to him
[36:27] and gave him the understanding because
[36:28] he liked the rest of us in his thinking
[36:30] was wrong
[36:34] come on
[36:36] he said i used to think that
[36:39] god hated me and jesus loved me
[36:42] until i found out there's a self-sane
[36:43] person
[36:45] do you need that quote
[36:48] he said i wouldn't preach on hell until
[36:50] god revealed it to me
[36:54] so we must have had some wrong ideas
[36:56] about that
[36:59] do you understand what i'm getting at
[37:03] i'm getting at what an organization
[37:05] really is
[37:07] it's man's ideas
[37:09] then you'll see why paul is using it
[37:12] as the law
[37:15] and see why brother adam in the
[37:16] individual union says this is a prophecy
[37:19] for the church
[37:21] about law and grace
[37:24] and to see that they chose law
[37:27] because like i said go back to exodus 19
[37:30] and show me they chose it
[37:32] it looked like and that's what we were
[37:34] all deceived by it looked like
[37:37] god said you're this this this and the
[37:39] people said hey we'll do whatever you
[37:42] say
[37:46] your prophet said the greatest mistake
[37:47] they ever made was they chose law
[37:49] instead of grace
[37:52] or for grace
[37:55] they chose a book of rules of man
[37:56] thinking it was what god wanted
[37:59] and they died
[38:01] all right
[38:08] look at what he goes on to number three
[38:12] and look what the prophet calls these
[38:14] things
[38:16] which is taken from questions and
[38:17] answers
[38:20] law having a shadow 1950
[38:22] 4
[38:24] 5 16
[38:25] 8 69.
[38:27] michael the archangel great one that
[38:29] stands in the presence of god and his
[38:31] angels fought against satan and his
[38:33] angels the red dragon
[38:39] now that's over in the book of
[38:40] revelations right and that's that's in
[38:42] revelations 12 and revelation 12 goes
[38:45] over to israel after we leave but look
[38:47] where the prophet pulls it back over
[38:49] here to show us where we're at
[38:51] they fought against satan and his angels
[38:53] the red dragon
[39:00] we know who the devil is
[39:02] but who was the church there that was
[39:04] the church that's led by the holy spirit
[39:06] and the angels of god fought against
[39:08] the organization and his angels and
[39:11] ministers of light
[39:14] now that's what your prophet had to say
[39:18] that an organization formed by
[39:21] people
[39:24] to fight against
[39:27] see we're organized to the point that
[39:30] we're fighting against
[39:31] organized religion
[39:34] but we form an organism which is the
[39:35] body of christ and we don't go on to
[39:37] organize because an organization's got a
[39:38] period on the end of it right what the
[39:40] prophet say
[39:43] when you write your book writer put a
[39:45] period he said you're you're dead
[39:50] it's like i've told you
[39:52] when this message came don't put a
[39:54] period on the end of this message now
[39:56] you won't like that one either
[39:59] because your prophet didn't put a period
[40:01] he said quote
[40:03] there would be a message of cheer down
[40:05] to the endless ages after we leave
[40:08] here so he didn't purity's message and
[40:11] stop it
[40:13] this is just getting us ready to be able
[40:14] to hear
[40:16] that's right what do you think we're
[40:18] going to do in heaven
[40:20] well we just play harps
[40:25] not quite
[40:27] we're just then going to be able to
[40:28] understand that's right
[40:30] let's get what he's saying
[40:33] all right
[40:36] going down to the last part of it
[40:38] that roman power going into every nation
[40:41] that city that ruled over all the earth
[40:44] he deceived it
[40:45] many churches organizing just like him
[40:49] see making an image unto the beast is
[40:52] that the book of revelations
[40:54] 17th chapter
[40:56] all right
[40:57] yeah but that's not us
[41:03] we can sit right here and dominate and
[41:05] die just like the rest
[41:10] no bless god i'm out of organized
[41:11] religion i ain't having nothing to do
[41:13] with it
[41:17] that can be an organization
[41:21] look at number four
[41:25] because here's one that we're going to
[41:27] talk about a little bit
[41:29] something that the prophet said
[41:34] that he didn't understand why he was
[41:36] against organized religion
[41:38] and why he taught
[41:40] the white horse writer
[41:43] was the holy spirit
[41:50] that's what we're talking about
[41:52] why because look what he says on
[41:55] feast of the trumpets
[41:59] if you think things are horrible and bad
[42:01] just remember
[42:04] in that message just prior to this he's
[42:06] explaining that under eichmann and
[42:09] hitler and mussolini and those
[42:12] where i've just finished reading a book
[42:13] sister trudy had on eichmann where they
[42:16] captured him
[42:17] and he himself had record of killing
[42:19] over six million jews
[42:23] not himself killing them the guy that
[42:25] gave the orders
[42:27] it took them 15 years to find him they
[42:30] finally captured him some of you ought
[42:31] to remember they captured him in about
[42:33] 62
[42:35] and finally crew
[42:37] hung him
[42:41] and to show you what they done they took
[42:43] his ashes and dumped it out in the ocean
[42:45] you know why
[42:47] because they said they didn't want no
[42:49] monument made
[42:51] to eichmann or a place isn't it kind of
[42:54] odd when
[42:58] what's this last guy's name
[43:02] in laden
[43:03] bin laden however you pronounce it isn't
[43:06] it odd that you remember what they done
[43:08] with his body
[43:12] they took it out in the ocean and dumped
[43:14] it
[43:16] i thought that was an odd coincidence
[43:18] but they didn't want no place left to
[43:20] make a monument in his honor
[43:23] brother random says that the holy ghost
[43:25] was loosed
[43:29] back there or excuse me the
[43:32] systems was loosed
[43:33] to drive the children of israel to the
[43:35] homeland
[43:37] and he said it killed millions of them
[43:39] to drive them to the homeland
[43:42] but he said 20 years later
[43:44] which would have put it 45 to 65 or
[43:47] whatever you want to calculate
[43:50] he said it's reduced on the bride
[43:56] you don't believe it take the word
[43:57] you're at paragraph go back one or two
[43:59] and read it
[44:02] the driver to the message of the hour
[44:05] so you think we're having troubles you
[44:06] know what it's for to drive us to the
[44:08] message of that hour
[44:12] of course
[44:15] the economy is getting tight
[44:19] and it won't be long until we get tired
[44:20] and you won't have money
[44:23] and you'll say well i can't go to church
[44:28] let's read what your prophet had to say
[44:30] about it and remember
[44:34] the system he's talking about had him
[44:37] deceived
[44:38] until the seals broke
[44:41] that statement
[44:43] is
[44:44] what he said
[44:46] go ahead and roll it up where we can
[44:47] start reading paragraph
[44:49] the feast of the trumpets
[44:52] while this group down here got 2 000
[44:55] got 2 000 bound at the river euphrates
[44:58] and has been bound for 2000 years now
[45:01] you remember that in the scripture
[45:03] he loose
[45:05] knows all right
[45:06] also the church
[45:13] what
[45:15] the church has bound the holy ghost
[45:18] nearly 2 000 years
[45:26] are you reading
[45:30] the church
[45:32] the thing that we thought as the prophet
[45:34] said one day like this he said what was
[45:36] to be
[45:38] the thing to deliver us
[45:41] to save us the church he said wound up
[45:43] being done
[45:45] to crucifies
[45:50] right
[45:54] bound the church
[45:56] has bound the holy ghost for nearly two
[45:58] thousand years
[46:01] under martyrdom back there who killed a
[46:03] christian down to the ages
[46:05] and under the church ages once
[46:07] it's been bound
[46:10] not at the river you say freitas but at
[46:12] the door of creeds and dogmas
[46:17] hiya hiya wake up
[46:22] hard to think when you sleep
[46:30] see this was the river euphrates within
[46:32] bound that would loose under eichmann
[46:34] and hitler them to drive them to
[46:35] homeland
[46:36] but the holy spirit
[46:38] can't work in the church today because
[46:40] of man-made system
[46:44] everybody's got a doctrine
[46:52] and they form together and they make a
[46:54] two soul group a seventh under virgil
[46:56] group a parousia group a son of man
[46:58] group or whatever you want to call it a
[47:00] little ice
[47:03] brother they don't like you call little
[47:04] eyes well what's the difference
[47:07] i don't preach to the world it may go
[47:09] out on the internet they can listen but
[47:11] i'm preaching to you and me
[47:16] what they do out there they're just
[47:17] listening that's right
[47:21] and so
[47:22] people in lula that's letting that
[47:24] organizational system still bind us
[47:27] because listen if you're going to quote
[47:28] quote the prophet
[47:31] if the holy ghost has been bound nearly
[47:33] 2 000 years it's only been 2 000 years
[47:35] since calvary
[47:38] so the holy ghost has never worked
[47:39] correctly
[47:44] well you want to get in the book of acts
[47:46] and let's preach all day
[47:50] right read the book of acts
[47:54] in that book of acts they had people
[47:56] trying to make them go back to
[47:58] circumcision
[48:00] they were supposed to be converted
[48:02] christians
[48:04] amen
[48:05] that's right
[48:09] and you know paul he didn't like that
[48:10] organization that spoke up in peter one
[48:12] day so he rebuked him in front of
[48:14] everybody
[48:19] so the holy ghost has never been free if
[48:21] you're getting my point
[48:22] you think it was in the book of acts
[48:29] your prophet just said it
[48:32] okay
[48:33] not at the river of euphrates but at the
[48:35] door of creeds and dogmas
[48:42] bless god i don't have no creed
[48:48] well what do you believe
[48:52] well i believe glorified is showing
[48:53] something
[48:55] that's an organization
[49:01] come on
[49:02] i think we're gonna follow brother dale
[49:04] that's an organization
[49:07] now paul never said that
[49:10] paul said follow me how
[49:14] is i father christ
[49:17] not father paul
[49:18] i'm a follower of william branham no no
[49:20] i'm a follower of the cross that was in
[49:23] william brown
[49:26] amen
[49:28] not the man
[49:30] then i don't give a hoot
[49:34] what they say about where he was wrong
[49:36] he led me to christ through the revealed
[49:38] word
[49:41] i have no time to argue with him about
[49:43] whether he was at out in arizona when he
[49:46] was supposed to have been that's right
[49:48] you better remember one thing though he
[49:50] said there's where the angels met him so
[49:52] you argue with him about it that's right
[49:55] you dig your own hole and go dive into
[49:58] it
[50:00] to try to be so super religious
[50:02] not realizing why would i want to
[50:04] correct brother branham it would mean
[50:06] that demon in me is wanting to be in
[50:09] charge or be the head man i got enough
[50:11] sense to know that
[50:14] don't follow me follow christ
[50:17] that way when you see me and say well
[50:19] brother dale i think you missed it right
[50:20] here
[50:23] i don't have no problem would you see
[50:24] where i missed it or not
[50:31] listen
[50:33] it's been bound not as
[50:35] that the holy spirit can't work in the
[50:36] church because of manmade system one of
[50:39] the holy ghosts can't work in lula
[50:44] amen
[50:45] and i think he does a lot
[50:48] i think we have a lot of healings and
[50:50] signs and wonders
[50:52] and we can stand and talk about the dead
[50:53] being raised the sick being healed
[51:00] but you go right over there and they can
[51:01] talk about the dead being raised and the
[51:03] sick being healed
[51:08] but can they talk about the word
[51:12] no that's the difference okay
[51:15] but i love this part
[51:17] but she's going to be liberated
[51:23] all right
[51:25] what's going to happen
[51:28] she's going to be liberated
[51:29] she's coming back that's what the bible
[51:31] said
[51:33] i love the way he talks don't you
[51:37] and those two meet one another
[51:40] on the battlegrounds
[51:43] lucifer and michael again like in the
[51:45] beginning
[51:47] they've been bound almost 2 000 years
[51:49] almost almost 2 000 years
[51:54] but michael and lucifer's to meet over
[51:57] there with the jews that we leave out of
[51:58] here who do you think is battling you
[52:01] who do you think is on the scene now
[52:11] what do we think about it
[52:14] look at the next one
[52:20] this goes over to paragraph 163 of the
[52:22] feast of the trumpet
[52:23] there is that roman empire burned there
[52:25] by what
[52:26] the ecclesiastical powers which rome
[52:29] pagan rome became papal rome and was
[52:31] bound there in its traditions of
[52:33] christianity christians
[52:35] all right
[52:36] it's bound there so what's he's still
[52:38] holding his point right what's binding
[52:40] it christian people
[52:42] whole so-called christian spirit in
[52:44] people
[52:48] and was bound there in its traditions of
[52:50] christians what part of christian
[52:54] and and superstitions it had of rome
[52:56] putting together all these
[52:58] things worship of women
[53:02] oh we don't do that
[53:05] and all these other kind of stuff
[53:07] and christmas days
[53:09] right
[53:10] and holidays and holy days and things
[53:14] it's been bound with that tradition that
[53:17] it cannot let loose
[53:20] because it's against christian
[53:21] principles
[53:23] feel the same ungodly pagan spirit
[53:27] and that spirit called into the nations
[53:29] of the world
[53:30] according to the prophecies of ezekiel
[53:33] and the rest of them
[53:37] holy ghost been bound for two thousand
[53:38] years
[53:44] see because for 2000 years mankind
[53:46] believed the white horse rider was
[53:48] the holy spirit
[53:52] right
[53:58] i just ask you a simple question is that
[54:00] right
[54:04] it was bound by traditions and creeds
[54:11] i told you about the time i was coming
[54:13] home listening to brother brown and
[54:14] talking about how they made all those
[54:15] images and all those things you know and
[54:17] they build them like the sphinx and and
[54:19] all of the things because they build
[54:20] them as guardians
[54:25] right
[54:27] i got home pulling the driveway started
[54:29] dying laughing
[54:32] had two swans sitting there one on each
[54:34] side of the driveway alongside the
[54:35] walkway
[54:37] i thought there ain't no difference
[54:49] we think we're free
[54:52] we'll get to it this afternoon when we
[54:54] finish this thought on it then how the
[54:58] in the day of martin luther
[55:01] something made that man free right yeah
[55:07] what was it
[55:13] but listen to this statement go ahead
[55:14] with number five
[55:21] this is taken from the revelation of
[55:22] jesus christ preaching 1960 1204 morning
[55:25] paragraph 240.
[55:28] and that's the way with a lot of people
[55:32] you're tied down with creeds and
[55:34] denominations
[55:36] listen
[55:37] from the old mother prostitute back
[55:40] there
[55:41] telling you that jesus christ isn't the
[55:44] same
[55:46] and now brother dale we've heard that
[55:48] i used to believe it that way but said
[55:50] i've heard brother around and said 8432
[55:53] times that he's the same yesterday day
[55:55] and forever and i don't believe that no
[55:57] more
[55:59] well you're burning churches just like
[56:00] the lutherans were
[56:03] the lutherans that didn't get the
[56:04] revelation that luther got without
[56:06] burning churches
[56:10] looked like they were more against
[56:11] organized religion than luther
[56:14] was were willing to kill
[56:26] and there's no such thing as healing
[56:27] there's no baptism in the holy ghost
[56:29] there's none of this stuff like that
[56:30] trying to tell you them
[56:32] you've been tied so long till you still
[56:34] think you're tied and what's he talking
[56:36] about johnny crow right
[56:38] johnny crow
[56:40] was a crow that was tied
[56:41] and after a long time they untied him
[56:45] well he didn't know he's untied so he
[56:47] just still stood in the same place
[56:50] i saw some horses one day doing that i
[56:52] thought of it and we were going by going
[56:54] to work every day and drove by there and
[56:56] they had this electric fence and and you
[56:58] know the horses would come up so close
[57:00] to the fence and and they would eat
[57:01] because electric fence they won't get
[57:02] close to it like a regular fence
[57:05] they know
[57:06] well you know what they moved that thing
[57:08] over about 50 feet
[57:10] you know it took over a week of me
[57:11] watching them horses before them horses
[57:14] ever moved a foot across from where they
[57:15] were
[57:17] they were still bound
[57:20] stephen wilson showed me something one
[57:21] day he was out in the backyard at his
[57:23] house he had one of those wire things
[57:25] you know to stop the dog
[57:26] you know in the collar on the dog
[57:28] he said now brother dale
[57:31] the electricity's off
[57:34] the thing's not working
[57:36] he said but watch
[57:37] he throw the frisbee in a dog doggie run
[57:39] and get it he throws a little further
[57:40] the dogger run get it he said watch this
[57:42] he throwed it outside of that rim where
[57:43] that wire was there that dog would not
[57:46] go get that frisbee
[57:48] he was still by him
[57:51] right
[57:52] what did the prophet say
[57:55] you're tied down with creeds and
[57:56] denominations
[57:58] right
[57:59] right
[58:00] why because we believe in what man has
[58:03] said
[58:06] okay and you still think you're tired
[58:10] i'm free
[58:12] but you're tired we're going out place
[58:14] that line right there
[58:17] right i'll have you know i'm free
[58:24] come on cross the line
[58:26] amen
[58:28] step over in the word
[58:30] you know what i'm talking about
[58:32] people this message what are they
[58:34] teaching
[58:35] we
[58:37] we don't dare get into them seals and
[58:38] things
[58:40] because we might get confused no you
[58:42] might find out you are
[58:44] that's what you're afraid of you're
[58:46] afraid of the line that's stuck there
[58:47] come on all right
[58:51] listen
[58:52] and your sin
[58:53] is your only thing that keeps you from
[58:55] being free
[58:59] now what's he saying
[59:01] watching
[59:02] it's because god cut you loose from your
[59:04] unbelief
[59:06] now what's the sin he's talking about
[59:09] i thought we put it all as unbelief
[59:15] read your prophet when i talk we put
[59:18] everything as unbelief is sin
[59:21] and your sin is your only thing that
[59:24] keeps you from being free
[59:27] what sin is he speaking of
[59:31] it's because god cut you loose from your
[59:33] unbelief
[59:37] but you're so bound with creeds
[59:40] do you still think you're tired
[59:45] right
[59:47] and what do you say
[59:49] just starving to death
[59:53] right
[59:55] see the hobbling around i'm presbyterian
[59:57] i'm methodist i'm baptist
[59:59] i'm blue lights
[1:00:03] i'm talking
[1:00:05] they tell me i'm church of christ
[1:00:08] these miracles fights there's no such
[1:00:10] thing
[1:00:12] the only reason i don't think i'd like
[1:00:13] for them to do on that is when they say
[1:00:15] i'm church of christ there's no such
[1:00:16] thing they ought to say there's no such
[1:00:17] thing as church of christ
[1:00:19] but that's not what they're talking
[1:00:20] about right you poor starved crow
[1:00:23] wonder what you come along this morning
[1:00:25] why don't you fly away hallelujah rise
[1:00:27] up with the wings of a morning and fly
[1:00:29] away to the sun of righteousness with
[1:00:32] healing in his wings amen that's it
[1:00:33] that's
[1:00:34] it brother sister oh he who the son has
[1:00:37] cut free is free indeed
[1:00:40] what about it
[1:00:44] look at number one at number six
[1:00:47] look at number seven
[1:00:52] a wicked in an adulterous generation
[1:00:53] would seek actor a sign assigned
[1:00:55] listen
[1:00:57] let's get number seven
[1:00:58] it's a two part taken from the
[1:01:00] indictment
[1:01:02] number six if we read number six
[1:01:05] okay look like number six
[1:01:07] if we hadn't read that
[1:01:10] come back down okay there we go
[1:01:12] and our creation denomination has bound
[1:01:14] many our people lord sin has bound them
[1:01:17] but today they want to be free
[1:01:20] they stand like pilate
[1:01:22] instead of trying to pass them on to
[1:01:24] somebody else
[1:01:25] if they raised their hands
[1:01:28] they wanted to say i want jesus christ
[1:01:31] i believe there's honest hearted people
[1:01:33] out there that wants to be free
[1:01:37] that's the reason the internet system is
[1:01:39] working i've told you
[1:01:40] is because i used to go out and people
[1:01:43] and say brother dale what about this
[1:01:46] i can't answer you because your pastor
[1:01:48] won't listen
[1:01:50] get your password okay you can get the
[1:01:52] tapes
[1:01:54] you know my pastor won't let me listen
[1:01:56] nobody else
[1:01:58] i've never told any of you here at all
[1:02:01] that you couldn't listen to somebody
[1:02:02] else
[1:02:04] right the only thing i've ever said is
[1:02:07] you bring in here what somebody else is
[1:02:09] saying i'll deal with it from the pulpit
[1:02:13] that's pastor i have to do that part
[1:02:15] that's not a
[1:02:16] situation
[1:02:18] and i never told you you couldn't listen
[1:02:20] to nobody else
[1:02:22] why because that's organized religion
[1:02:24] when you say you can't listen to nobody
[1:02:25] else
[1:02:27] much as anybody else all right going now
[1:02:29] to number seven
[1:02:35] rolling up to number seven which is
[1:02:37] the indictment
[1:02:42] my wicked selfish greed you took the
[1:02:43] word of life and crucified it before the
[1:02:46] people
[1:02:47] and blasphemed it and called it
[1:02:49] fanaticism
[1:02:50] which god has raised up in our midst to
[1:02:53] prove that he's the same yesterday today
[1:02:55] and forever
[1:02:56] i indict this generation go ahead and
[1:02:58] put it up you can read all in between
[1:03:00] but pull it on up to the last part
[1:03:01] paragraph 274
[1:03:04] and through your creeds and your
[1:03:06] organizations and your denominations
[1:03:09] with your form of godliness
[1:03:13] still talking your form of godliness you
[1:03:16] denied the power of his resurrection
[1:03:19] now in the message of teaching
[1:03:20] resurrection done twice
[1:03:22] millennium's here and
[1:03:24] all kind of things right
[1:03:26] but look what he says
[1:03:27] but the hour has arrived the last days
[1:03:31] are here
[1:03:32] when god promised according to malachi 4
[1:03:34] that he would raise up in the last days
[1:03:38] and he turned the hearts of the people
[1:03:39] back to the original blessing the
[1:03:42] pentecostal blessing faith of the
[1:03:44] fathers all right
[1:03:47] go ahead now to the next one
[1:03:52] this is paragraph 242 of the feast of
[1:03:55] the trumpets
[1:03:57] the holy spirit has been bound by these
[1:03:59] denominational rivers for almost 2 000
[1:04:02] years what but it's to be loosed in the
[1:04:04] evening time how
[1:04:07] by the evening time message
[1:04:11] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:04:14] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:04:16] in the evening time
[1:04:18] he said it it's promised
[1:04:21] okay number nine
[1:04:24] let's get back to the point now what
[1:04:27] that old husband
[1:04:29] for us to be loosed and be free by the
[1:04:31] end time message
[1:04:33] that old husband's got to be dead
[1:04:37] right
[1:04:39] so to be married to the second this is
[1:04:40] paragraph 153
[1:04:42] of the invisible union the bride of
[1:04:44] christ you'll be married to the second
[1:04:46] adam christ the word you must separate
[1:04:48] yourself by death from your first
[1:04:50] denominational husband
[1:04:52] he said well that's only the new birth
[1:04:53] well he's kind of pulled it all together
[1:04:55] right because there isn't one of them
[1:04:56] that can take all the word of god
[1:04:59] just show me where that one is at oh you
[1:05:01] say mine
[1:05:03] two souls says mine seven thunder says
[1:05:05] mine bruises it says mine lula says mine
[1:05:15] the other fellow says he is too
[1:05:17] put them together and you find out
[1:05:19] you're both wrong
[1:05:21] as soon as you denominate read
[1:05:23] revelation 17.
[1:05:25] you see this you've got to be dead to
[1:05:26] them things
[1:05:29] you've got to be dead to that old
[1:05:30] husband of organized religion
[1:05:33] all right look what he says on
[1:05:35] paragraph 159
[1:05:37] which would be number 10
[1:05:40] of invisible union
[1:05:41] neither can you bear god's sons of his
[1:05:43] word to this illegitimate
[1:05:46] denominational group you cannot do it in
[1:05:49] your incubator you cannot bring forth a
[1:05:51] word son of god i am speaking to the
[1:05:53] church but still you claim to be very
[1:05:55] religious so was kind the prostitute
[1:05:58] he's son very religious built alders and
[1:06:00] offered sacrifices paid his tithe and
[1:06:03] done everything
[1:06:04] that any other religious man that would
[1:06:07] do
[1:06:08] but he failed to keep the word he failed
[1:06:11] to have
[1:06:12] the revelation
[1:06:14] okay go on to the next paragraph 281
[1:06:18] gotta get these two and then we'll quit
[1:06:21] still on the invisible union and we know
[1:06:23] that the church could not the
[1:06:24] pentecostal church by no means by no
[1:06:26] means could carry out the last day
[1:06:28] message in his present condition
[1:06:31] good at congregation says no white can't
[1:06:33] even agree on one or two words in the
[1:06:35] bible
[1:06:37] how are you going to do it it can't do
[1:06:39] it so you see the nomination is out
[1:06:41] that's right
[1:06:43] it's going to be an elected people
[1:06:46] that's elected for it see
[1:06:50] now no and so do every one of us know
[1:06:54] that the whole rank of denominational
[1:06:56] pentecostals and all are dead
[1:07:01] what
[1:07:02] that is to the born-again christian of
[1:07:04] the message
[1:07:08] your first husband is dead
[1:07:11] you know he's dead
[1:07:13] god let it die
[1:07:15] now he's the only one can let it die you
[1:07:17] can't do it i can't kill organized
[1:07:19] religion
[1:07:20] you can't either
[1:07:22] god has to let it die we'll get to it
[1:07:24] this evening only the revealed word
[1:07:33] it's finished all these scientific
[1:07:34] intellectual educational scientific ways
[1:07:37] a so-called bible school now look at
[1:07:40] get into that one and try to figure it
[1:07:41] out scientific intellectual educational
[1:07:44] system
[1:07:45] scientific and he's talking about bible
[1:07:46] school i mean talking about your bible
[1:07:48] school
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:56] come on let's bring it down a little
[1:07:57] more present in the hour
[1:08:00] when all of these
[1:08:01] young people go into youth camps and we
[1:08:03] send our people to them i'm glad of it
[1:08:06] but where do they put a person up there
[1:08:08] to teach the kids how to get the baptism
[1:08:10] of the holy ghost
[1:08:12] no they want a motorcycle hell angels
[1:08:15] reject
[1:08:17] to tell about his life
[1:08:22] why is it every year the same people
[1:08:24] kids come back to the same altar
[1:08:30] why don't they tell them about jesus
[1:08:32] christ and get them born again amen
[1:08:38] oh that's the educational scientific
[1:08:41] what is scientific scientific is you
[1:08:43] know getting everything well don't you
[1:08:46] think we can get this message together
[1:08:47] and present it in a special way that
[1:08:49] everybody will receive it no they won't
[1:08:51] receive it
[1:08:53] won't be done
[1:08:55] separate one this year and trinity's
[1:08:57] here two this year and over here and
[1:08:59] down here and such a mess up and call
[1:09:02] themselves pentecostals get the
[1:09:04] license this is ending up with the
[1:09:06] invisible union and he says this
[1:09:08] paragraph 300.
[1:09:11] now we're closing and saying this
[1:09:13] finish up the great commission
[1:09:15] how could they do it
[1:09:17] you know they're dead god let it die
[1:09:20] what this scientific age
[1:09:24] of all of it he keeps dealing with
[1:09:26] scientific and you see scientific is
[1:09:28] what you're thinking scientific
[1:09:32] is uh
[1:09:34] you know
[1:09:35] bombs and nuclears and airplanes and
[1:09:39] cars
[1:09:40] uh
[1:09:41] get over i believe it's in the book of
[1:09:43] acts if not you'll find it and look
[1:09:45] where the bible says that
[1:09:47] science so called
[1:09:51] go read your bible and see if it's not
[1:09:52] in there
[1:09:54] science so called
[1:09:56] he's talking about religious systems
[1:10:01] you see why then the prophet would keep
[1:10:02] saying science
[1:10:04] scientific
[1:10:07] for once god let it die this
[1:10:09] scientifically age of all so he could do
[1:10:11] what
[1:10:14] open up the seven seal mystery to the
[1:10:17] undenominational bride
[1:10:19] how can our denomination accept those
[1:10:21] seals and it's absolutely contrary
[1:10:23] serpent seed and all those other things
[1:10:25] the whole full seven mysteries is
[1:10:28] contrary to what they been taught
[1:10:30] because they took the old school from
[1:10:33] their bible school
[1:10:39] and yet in the message you have
[1:10:41] an argument
[1:10:45] that the seventh seal is not broke yet
[1:10:52] the message is split today over argument
[1:10:55] but one group saying it's open the other
[1:10:57] group said it's not open
[1:10:59] the bible said it was
[1:11:02] but it's not open to everybody because
[1:11:04] he said it'd never be open to the public
[1:11:09] simple isn't
[1:11:10] it he's right
[1:11:14] the seventh seal will never be revealed
[1:11:16] to mankind
[1:11:18] it's revealed to the bride of christ
[1:11:24] so the seal is broke to the bride and
[1:11:27] sealed to the world
[1:11:29] and yet they're split trying to split
[1:11:31] the message wide open
[1:11:32] saying whether or not the seventh seal
[1:11:34] is broke or not
[1:11:39] you see what i'm talking about organized
[1:11:40] religion this group is organized
[1:11:43] we've got to quote
[1:11:45] it's broke
[1:11:46] this group is organized
[1:11:49] it's not broken
[1:11:56] you see you don't like me to talk like
[1:11:58] that
[1:11:59] but i'm not preaching to a bunch of
[1:12:01] babies
[1:12:04] that has don't know the message of the
[1:12:06] hour
[1:12:07] you're supposed to know it
[1:12:12] i'm preaching to people that believe the
[1:12:13] message supposed to believe it
[1:12:18] see we can denominate claiming brother
[1:12:19] branham was a prophet and die
[1:12:28] man on up in the virginias will out
[1:12:30] quote me to death about brother branham
[1:12:33] and teaches it
[1:12:37] we're going to walk out in on our own
[1:12:38] ashes into the millennium
[1:12:43] because he believes we got to get a new
[1:12:44] body
[1:12:48] and you know what a lot of the people
[1:12:50] message follow it
[1:12:54] we're going to get a new body
[1:12:56] how many times did the prophet say it
[1:12:58] this body made you
[1:13:03] yet that don't mean anything to them
[1:13:04] they don't organize
[1:13:08] you see it don't take a group to be an
[1:13:10] organization just one person
[1:13:15] but that old husband's got to be dead
[1:13:16] let's stand come on musician that old
[1:13:18] husband got to be dead the old husband
[1:13:20] of organized religion
[1:13:22] of us saying we have a right to think
[1:13:28] we have no right to think whatsoever
[1:13:31] if we're sheep
[1:13:38] sheep will automatically father the
[1:13:40] shepherd
[1:13:46] right
[1:13:48] well let's just follow the shepherd and
[1:13:50] let that old denomination die
[1:13:57] brother brother you don't understand i
[1:13:58] left a denomination 50 years ago amen
[1:14:02] i left it 40 something
[1:14:08] but if anything comes into our mind that
[1:14:10] is contrary to the word of
[1:14:12] god
[1:14:14] and we don't destroy that thing
[1:14:17] it will sprout within us
[1:14:20] and we will not abide by ourselves and
[1:14:23] our thoughts
[1:14:24] we will infect everything that's around
[1:14:26] us with that virus as we call it off the
[1:14:29] computer system
[1:14:32] and we'll infect everybody with their
[1:14:34] ideas
[1:14:36] all i got to do is say mark not no
[1:14:38] that's all right all right mark no no i
[1:14:40] shouldn't even said that now i've done
[1:14:42] set in his mind something
[1:14:46] that he's going to want to know what i'm
[1:14:48] talking about
[1:14:50] well i know something that's in the
[1:14:51] church at lula but i won't tell nobody
[1:14:54] if you know something that's in lula and
[1:14:56] won't tell me
[1:14:58] get out of lula
[1:15:01] is that plain enough
[1:15:03] get out of lula
[1:15:06] why because i'm the pastor you're
[1:15:08] supposed to come tell me
[1:15:13] if you don't the blood is on your hands
[1:15:21] you're carrying
[1:15:22] blood on you if you carry a tail or an
[1:15:25] idea
[1:15:28] you see i don't do it like that
[1:15:31] i just go to people personally and say
[1:15:33] i'd like to talk to you a minute i'd
[1:15:35] like to know about this
[1:15:36] but you know then i don't go tell nobody
[1:15:44] well because i'm not supposed to
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:50] if it's under the blood we put it under
[1:15:51] the blood who's going to dig it out
[1:15:55] you dig it out you got the blood on you
[1:15:59] i just don't tell you what to do
[1:16:02] i'm sorry i guess i'm supposed to
[1:16:06] but i've never seen it solve anything
[1:16:09] a blabbering mouth
[1:16:11] is the devil's workshop
[1:16:20] organized religion
[1:16:22] is that old husband dead if not
[1:16:25] why is he still showing up every once in
[1:16:27] a while
[1:16:28] you know
[1:16:32] why is he still raising up every once in
[1:16:34] a while
[1:16:36] you know somebody hear the wife or the
[1:16:38] husband you know or be dead
[1:16:41] you say well they're dead well then you
[1:16:43] see the license plate on the car they
[1:16:45] used to drive or you see somebody seeing
[1:16:47] somebody walk in the house it looks like
[1:16:49] them something's wrong somewhere
[1:16:52] we're not dumb
[1:16:54] somebody ain't dead

[1:17:05] 316. 360. yeah 360.
[1:17:09] wow
[1:17:10] anybody have a need the altar is open
[1:17:41] what's killing us
[1:17:44] probably said our sin of our unbelief
[1:17:47] is gone but our sin of breathing
[1:17:50] darkness
[1:17:54] is killing us
[1:18:05] greater is he that
[1:18:09] is he that
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:15] in the name of jesus christ we lay our
[1:18:16] hands upon our neighbors
[1:18:18] and by your stripes she's healed
[1:18:21] your word said it and we believe
[1:18:24] she believes it
[1:18:25] and thank you for taking the way lord
[1:18:27] in jesus name
[1:18:30] anybody else
[1:18:40] a power greater than a problem with
[1:18:43] congestion in his chest and think he's
[1:18:45] been sick so let's just pray and believe
[1:18:47] it lord take care of him
[1:18:49] father
[1:18:50] in the name of
[1:18:52] christ brother here lord
[1:18:53] you lay hands on jesus
[1:18:55] we ask you to just remove this problem
[1:19:33] yes
[1:19:41] what i want to see is an organism form
[1:19:44] of the bride of jesus christ around the
[1:19:46] world
[1:19:48] to be the body of christ
[1:19:54] she's going to be set free by this end
[1:19:56] time message
[1:19:57] that's what it was sent for
[1:20:00] the holy ghost had been bound for 2000
[1:20:02] years
[1:20:03] but is to be set free
[1:20:06] by the end time nations
[1:20:12] you see yeah but look at it all around
[1:20:13] the world that ain't got nothing to do
[1:20:14] with it
[1:20:21] this message is only sent to the bride
[1:20:23] of jesus christ
[1:20:29] she's the only one can receive it
[1:20:32] because he's the only one the bride of
[1:20:34] christ that has the holy spirit
[1:20:40] if we don't have the holy spirit we
[1:20:42] can't understand the message i don't
[1:20:43] care how much we hear
[1:20:45] but brother said in the church eight
[1:20:46] book who didn't have the holy spirit
[1:20:49] he said you hear the message every day
[1:20:50] you laugh and
[1:20:52] die and go to hell
[1:20:55] it's about time to get rid of man's
[1:20:57] ideas
[1:20:58] and start believing the prophet
[1:21:05] believe what god said through a man's
[1:21:07] lips
[1:21:09] but yet people want to try to prove him
[1:21:10] wrong
[1:21:16] want to get wrong dates and wrong
[1:21:18] thoughts that you told me say it
[1:21:28] it is to be set free
[1:21:31] you're dismissed
[1:21:32] remember the service is after you
[1:21:36] father you speak with everybody
[1:21:44] but yet lord jesus
[1:22:04] greater than
[1:22:06] any earthly phone
[1:22:22] greater is he that is
[1:22:26] greater is he that
[1:22:34] is he that is
