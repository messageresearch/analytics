walk better now that's we're trusting that was the goal right amen praise the Lord see brother Aaron back and his family and we just appreciate each and every one of you amen amen Let's uh we're going to this morning uh or this afternoon we're going to uh turn to uh John chapter 1 John chapter 1 and I want to talk this evening I want to speak about the life is the light of man the life is the light of man praise the Lord and I somewhat want to kind of piggyback on on what I was speaking about on Sunday morning if you haven't heard that that uh that Sunday school lesson uh I encourage you to do so but um we just kind of kind of piggy back on that but just kind of take it from a a different angle amen we want to talk about uh about the light you know and usually when we read John chapter 1 you know we we we we talk about the godhead and and we talk about uh you know Jesus Christ creating all things and of course all that is true but I just want I just wanted to uh break it down on a specific thing that the Lord showed me I I guess the Lord showed me this afternoon about the light amen so let's just let's just go to the Lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to open back the pages of your word and that we are gathered here Lord Jesus father God not to Feast on the word of a man but Lord to Feast on you father God lord we want to be more like you you are the son of man Lord and and the bride Lord Jesus father is the son of man and father God in this hour Lord Jesus because we're part of you Lord we have father just as much Lord God uh everything father God belongs to us because Lord you've given it to us Lord Jesus we we are we we are join heirs and coair with you Lord God and so Heavenly Father we just pray Lord that you would just have your way here this evening Lord meet all needs amongst us and just father God speak to our hearts and help us to receive something from you Lord God forgive us for all of our sins sins cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness and we just kind of we just commit ourselves now into your hands Lord and we ask these things Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord Jesus amen John chapter 1 and the brothers can bring it up there and we'll just read to verse four and then I'll have you be seated it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man praise the Lord and so that's where I got the title from and I chose the title the life is the light of man because I believe that life is still the light of man praise God and it's interesting that you know the the the Bible doesn't say there you know the light was the life of man praise the Lord but the life was the light of man and I believe the reason the reason why is because you have to you have to show forth life amen in order for the ones receiving the life be able to walk in that light you see what I'm saying so so so it was life before light although we know that if it's just light and there's no value to the light amen then it just doesn't serve any purpose but if there's light amen that causes life to grow amen that's valuable light so therefore Jesus is life praise God we know he's the originator and the source of life and that is why he showed us life that's why that verse says in there that in him was life and the life was the light of man praise the Lord so with that you may have your seats praise God Amen so you know Jesus we know that he brought life and and that life you know we can tie it to Mercy and Grace first amen and it gave it gave man that the light the necessary light to light up the way praise the Lord Jesus amen I I I I needed mercy and Grace when I was out in the world shaped in iniquity sinning and and and and that that that is when I needed the most Grace in my life amen and and and and you know when you receive Grace amen when you receive re mercy and when you receive amen uh uh compassion amen that that's what draws you amen that's what draws you it draws you Amen to be able to walk in that light whereas if we don't receive that amen it keeps us away it causes us to it keeps us away it pushes us back praise God but that's what Jesus was amen so that light amen came forth first Amen in the Bible and and and and we see there that that that in in in in um in in in Genesis chapter 1 when we read uh we'll just read it here together real quick it says in Genesis chapter 1 that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water in verse three it says and God said let there be light and there was light and you know that that light that is speaking about there is not the sun light it's not the moon light not the Stars light stars light but it was him himself amen it was the life of God Amen he is the originator of all life amen he is the light of the world the Bible says Hey praise God everything was created by Him and nothing that was created amen uh didn't didn't exist on its own didn't come about on its own praise God it was originated by him he is the originator of all life praise the Lord amen everything good everything bad there had to be a pharaoh and there had to be a a a Moses amen life Moses Pharaoh had just as much that life that came from God just as Moses did praise God but it was Moses amen that got had the word of God that caused him to walk in the light amen for his day praise God and so and so it's interesting amen that everywhere that you see in in in John chapter 1 when we're reading John chapter 1 and it helps you to understand it better is when you're looking at it like this when you when if if you're reading John chapter 1 it says in the beginning was the word so you put in Jesus Christ right there amen amen I if the brothers could bring those scriptures up and it could help us Amen in the beginning was Jesus Christ amen and Jesus Christ was with God and Jesus Christ was God right where did in the beginning who created the Heaven and the Earth amen Jesus Christ amen God praise amen praise the Lord now in in verse two the same or Jesus Christ was in the beginning with God that's why he could say that I I I I come from God and I go back to God that's why when he was going to die when he was dying he said I must go back to to the father Amen in other words to that position praise God it's the same God all the time amen there's no no three persons there's no two persons amen it's the same God Amen putting on a different mask depending on the dispensation or what he needs to do amen amen praise God all things now verse three all things were made by Jesus Christ and without Jesus Christ was not anything made that was made in him or Jesus Christ was life and the life was the light of man amen praise the lord we can uh go down to and the light verse 5 and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehend it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the Jesus Christ that all men through Jesus Christ might believe kind of a little bit different when you read it this way it makes it even more personal right he was not that light or that Jesus Christ but was sent to bear witness of that Jesus Christ he was talking about John that was the true light or Jesus Christ which lith every man that cometh into the world so we could be here the rest of the time reading it that way but that is exactly how what it is it kind of helps when you put in Jesus Christ wherever it says word wherever it says him amen praise the Lord and so maybe you and your your children can go back home and read that whole chapter that way and it'll just maybe be more impactful to them now and when we skip down to verse 16 and it says there of that same chapter and of his Jesus Christ fullness of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace amen and then it says in verse 17 for the law was given by Moses but Grace but amen but God but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ am amen praise the Lord Jesus so that is where the grace comes from amen it comes from the Lord Jesus Christ amen we know that that in the in the days of Moses amen as the children left Egypt and God really what he wanted to do is deal with the people through Mercy through Grace Amen on on on a uh on that basis amen but the people amen as they were walking through the children through the through the Wilderness amen they they got caught up in in in Idol worshiping and and in all other things as a matter of fact while Moses was up on the mountain amen they were down they were down at the bottom of the mountain worshiping a golden calf they got tired of waiting for Moses they got tired of waiting uh uh what God what what was God doing up there with him amen and they wanted to get this program going so they thought that they could just do it on their own amen and so they asked Aaron hey make us a an idol that we can worship because they just come out of Egypt and Egypt they worship bulls and they worship frogs and they worship all kinds of things and and and so they they wanted they wanted to to to worship something something tangible cuz they couldn't see a tangible God they couldn't see but they saw his Works they saw his miracles and they see his Prophet but his Prophet is not on the scene and so they wanted to worship something tangible amen I just wonder if in this day and hour if it isn't like that with the even even amongst our ranks amen the prophet's gone off the scene amen he's not with us anymore and the people amen they're getting bored they're getting tired that the message isn't enough for them anymore they they want something tangible something that they can do amen praise God but God's giving us a word amen a message Amen in this hour that if you believe it by faith amen and take it in your life amen and apply that token in your life amen it'll change your life it'll change the life of your home it'll change the life of your family members it'll change you amen praise God if you take it amen no matter if the prophet's not on the scene anymore God is on the scene his people amen are still here praise the Lord and it then we don't need anything tangible but it's it's it's so amazing to me amen and and and you see this a lot amongst the Hispanic ranks they they want something tangible they want something they can touch something they can feel and something that they can uh or hit play something that they can do Amen to cause them amen to get closer to God and that's the Trap that the that that Satan has brought into them they left Catholicism but they gave to another Catholicism that's that's just the truth amen know some something that they can do amen praise God in the Catholic Church you know they're praying novenas and and walking on cobblestones on their knees and all kinds of things whipping themselves and the Philippines they Whi themselves and they they're bleeding some of them sacrifice or or crucify themselves on the cross they do all kinds of stuff to gain favor to God Amen when God has already done all that for them praise the Lord and he did it in real life he did it really for them praise the Lord it was their sins that put them there on that cross it was your sins that put him there on that cross for the love that he had for you and I praise the Lord and so this light amen that that that the children of Israel amen they got to they got finally God had to give give them a law and and so this law amen was was to be able to guide them to be able to differentiate their life amen from the peoples around them but it was also Amen to be able to give them to know what sin was Amen to know amen what was wrong and what was right amen praise God now in that law there was consequences amen if you broke the law there was consequences amen there that and so the law according to the New Testament amen it didn't show Grace it didn't show Mercy amen it was if you broke the law there was consequences amen so there was there was people amen people were probably just walking in fear amen because when there is law amen and and and that's all there is amen it causes you to walk in fear it causes you to walk amen subservient Amen to other people amen and not realizing amen that what you need is Grace amen amen because when you get Grace amen it causes you Amen to be a you want to walk in that in in in you want to love the Lord and follow his Commandments praise the Lord you want to do what's right when you obtain Grace when you obtain Mercy you will want to do to do because why that's what you can give back right I if I receive Grace from God I want to give my life back to God if he gave me so much grace if he gave me so much Mercy I just want to give my whole body as a living sacri rice amen praise the Lord and so the elements of light Saints it when when when God sent light amen he brought that light amen that caused all eventually caused things to to It produced uh animals It produced botney life It produced all these things amen and eventually it was being drawn to the light amen you know the the the the the the the the plants amen they they were being drawn to that life amen that would that came only by God Amen and so that's what light does Saints amen it's supposed to be drawing amen light is supposed to be drawn you and I your life is supposed to be drawing others Amen to who to you no to Jesus Christ it's supposed to be a draw or amen drawing others Amen to see where where is the source of that light amen and you and I are supposed to be light in this hour praise God and we're supposed to be walking in the light in this our amen and we can only walk in that light if we've received that life in US amen and he is the light he is the life he said I am the way the truth and the life amen no man comes to the father but by me amen and so we were reading here in Genesis chapter 1 here in in verse three it says and God said let there be light and there was light amen and we know that that light was life it was not the sun and it was not the moon and the stars because those came later in the chapter amen and then verse four it says and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and so we were just reading there that in John 1:9 that that was the True Light who was that True Light amen it was the Lord Jesus Christ which lith every man that cometh into the world Amen so this life amen everybody lives by the by the by the life the life of God Amen remember when when Eve she said that I beg got a a man from the Lord when she had Cain and that she was saying something true amen but she thought it was just a she thought it in a different way amen that life did come from God everything that that was that was serpent seed amen came from God Amen because he is the source of life amen there's nothing that lives unless he was the one who thought it and spoke it first amen he is the source of life amen praise God so and then in verse 5 and God called the the light day and the Darkness he called night now we were just now talking about light that light we know that light attracts and it draws amen and we know that light it it symbolizes it often symbolizes positivity guidance hope and safety amen you know when you're walking down the street amen and you're walking in you know somewhere you generally don't want to go around where it's not well lit right I know you sisters don't want to go where some some Alleyway that is not very well lit amen there's something that's that's unsafe about that there there's something that doesn't that doesn't give you comfort about that amen but but when it's when there's light amen there's plenty of it amen it gives you confidence Amen to be able to to go in that in that Alleyway or to go wherever you need to go amen because there's light there's sufficient light if something goes on Amen I I can scream and somebody will see me amen somebody will be able to see what's going on there and and it gives you confidence amen and that's what light does Amen it draws you and it gives you confidence amen it gives you it gives you peace and it gives you a a satisfaction knowing that there's protection there amen praise God that's what that's what light does Amen right you know there is a there is something called phototaxis I was looking that and it's those insects amen it's the insects that are drawn to to to light is what I was reading is that the insects were those insects like the moths and the different bugs that you see that they are drawn you turn on your porch lot outside and and they're all over the place I mean look at out here while we're out there talking in the summertime and everybody's just constantly doing this you know hitting themselves but it's because those bugs originally were meant to be drawn and and and guided by the Moonlight amen but but here's this artificial man-made light am that that that that is that is really messing them up that's right and and here and therefore they're they're constantly hitting and bashing themselves on that light and it's producing nothing for them it's not doing anything for them amen and so it's a false light amen it seems like it gives hope but there's no life about that light you see and so that's the reason why Saints you and I amen that the light that we have must come from the original source which is the Lord Jesus Christ which is by the Holy Ghost amen that light produces life amen anything else amen outside of that is is nothing but man-made amen it's your own thing it's your own light it it's something fake amen and when others amen are drawn to it amen they realize they've hit a dead end that's right I can't get any life from this person I can't get any light from this from this person amen I've hit a dead end with you see amen so we must amen we must be sure that we know that we know that we have the originator of that life in US amen that we are born again amen filled with the holy spirit amen amen be be be led by the spirit of God Amen praise the Lord because he is the original of that true life amen so we also know that there's a there's a thing also called phototropism and phototropism is this plant growth when when when plants are grow and the and they're and and they seem to to tilt or lean over to wherever the light is amen you see anything amen that has life or that has the potential for life amen wants to go where there is life amen amen wants to be around where there is life amen where there is death they don't want to be around there amen but where there is life they want to be around where there's life praise God that's why I don't see why a Christian amen wants to be around with with with uh uh with with with worldly people and or or or being or feeding on worldly things amen because that's that's what a Christian wants to feed on the good things that bring more life even to him amen and what causes that that that plant amen as it's as it's leaning towards that life it's causing it to grow even more amen praise God as you are leaning towards the light or as you are leaning towards Jesus Christ it's not he's not going to make you not grow amen he's not going to crush you amen you're going to keep growing in him amen praise God it's as simple as that amen Jesus said in John 644 no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him amen right or phototropism amen draw him and I will raise him up at the last day amen amen because what will do that what what will raise amen the the same Jesus Christ that they had is the same Jesus Christ that raises them up in the last day amen praise the Lord when you when we're talking about the stature of a perfect man what is what is it that is drawing I always like to think of this like a as a magnet amen it's a magnet from above that's drawing amen it's drawing us slowly and it's not it's not us amen we're we're having to kind of kind of scratch amen oh I've made it through virtue oh oh I'm just barely hanging on knowledge oh Temperance and and then you know it's nothing that you do amen but it's the Holy Ghost In You producing this virtues in your life and as I always said it C it comes they come through trials tribulations tests um all those things that you and I need that will cause us you you still don't have uh a Temperance you're going to get things in their life that happen that will cause make you to have more and more Temperance you don't have brotherly love brotherly kindness more things will happen in your life that will have to produce brotherly kindness at some point amen that Holy Spirit in your life amen the potentials are there amen the potentials are there at Faith amen praise God but it's that other amen is what brother Wade was talking about this morning that uh the on Sunday that holy spirit amen it's what's drawing amen praise God it's word on top of word life on top of life amen you receive life here amen but it's more life amen that's drawing you Amen to keep growing in him praise God we don't want to stay stale we don't want to stay the same as we did 10 years ago or you know God sent a prophet that's wonderful that's good people need that still amen but amen we must be growing in the stature of a perfect man we must be growing amen so no man can come to the father unless the father draws him first amen so as light we know that light can cause life as we just as as we just read it it can do positive things amen but light if it's not well balanced it can also cause damage and Destroy amen and some examples of this is ultraviolet radiation amen it's caused by light sunlight amen but it can cause damage to your skin it can cause damage to the eyes amen and and into different parts of the body but it's light but it's not well balanced for you and I'm so glad that God has given us a balanced diet a balanced word in this hour amen not too much Amen to lead us amen into some sort of legalism or not too little amen that we're starving for for for more of God Amen he's given us an exact exactly what we need Amen in order to grow in this hour amen praise God when you when you come into this message or you preach the word or or or or you talk to someone about the gospel amen I can't start talking to them about D 70 weeks if they've never heard anything about the Lord Jesus Christ being able to save them from from their sins amen because that'd be too much amen you'd be liable to to more do more damage even though you're you're giving them light amen but you'd be able to do more damage to them if if if because they can't handle it it's like you're trying to shove a a steak down their throat a baby's throat you can't can't can't do that the baby's going to choke amen amen but you start little by little amen you start with the milk and you start with those things amen and eventually amen they'll they'll they'll build up to the to the steak amen praise God to the tacos Amen to the barbecue you see eventually they'll be able to there there's great things in store for them oh yes it's not just about the the the milk amen or the powder milk or the or even the the mom's milk you see amen that all has its purpose though and it and and it's there for them to start but eventually there's some other good things for them amen praise God but you got to start them softly and slowly amen and and and and sometimes you know it's hard for us you know as as as parents and and and as as as us dealing with people amen because that's what gives us patience to to have to deal with people that that are not getting it you you but you have to remember amen if you got it amen if you got it you you've been being trained for the last 30 40 years amen and that that that that child of yours is still hasn't only but lived maybe 15 years amen and you're wed to for them to see what you see and it doesn't work that way you see they have to be slowly trained it might sound kind of uh uh you know out of you might think well I'm way past this but but you see in you humbling yourself into their level amen it causes you to obtain Temperance causes you to get patience amen and all those things God does it so perfectly because we cannot live this life thinking we know it all I've come to I'm 50 years old and I've got it down packed no you don't there's people that are older than that that are still learning lessons you see we're all learning Brother Don all of us are learning lessons and I've said before until you leave live leave this earth you're still going to be learning things learning about life learning learning what this is all about amen because it's a growth process amen praise God and I love what brother Dale would always say he said I can truly not say that I'm born again until I've I've met him amen until I've gone to the other side then I could say I am born again amen praise the Lord Jesus so we are growing amen we are gr into that stature amen so so there there's light that can destroy you know there's ultraviolet lights is causes skin damage and high intensity light sources which are explosions and fires now it's nice to have a nice fire you know during the fall and during the winter time to warm you up amen but let that fire get out of control then then it won't be good then that that good that good light that light won't be good at that moment you see but but but but when the light is contained amen and when that fire is contained then it can it can do some good things praise God laser lights amen it also it can burn it does Burns and gives eye injuries amen so as I said you know there has to be a balance of light in order to bring forth life amen you have to have a balance praise God now remember light amen remember he is the life and he is the light amen and he gives forth life amen before you can go on with that light praise God you have to have that life for praise the Lord too much light can cause damage or too little light can cause damage as well amen it's the same thing with us as parents amen uh you know when we're too loose on the rules amen we make it makes them for being broken all the time right when we're too loose on the rules we say this we expect this out of you but when they they break the rule and you don't do anything about it they're just going to keep doing it that's right they're just going to keep doing it and doing oh parents are just Loosey Goosey and you know we could just get by with anything why because all they are is just talk all they are is just talk and and we can just amen that's that's not even the child's fault that's your fault as a parent and then you're wondering why why my kid has gone wild amen why my kid is is disobedient and rebellious amen it's because you haven't tightened the screws on that right you haven't tightened the screws on those on on on on those things in in your family or in your home amen but yet too strict of the rules allows for no room for Grace amen and eventually those kids amen who have that strictness put down upon them they'll do it for a time but they'll come a time where they'll break those rules anyways right they're going to go out and do it anyways because amen it's not in their heart to do it amen to live to to what the rules are there for that's not in their heart amen it's it it's they're only doing it to please you you see so you have to have a balance just like there has to be a balance of the light amen there can't be too much light but there can't be too little light either you have to have a certain balance in order for there to bring forth life amen and for there to be Harmony and for there to be uh peace praise God and and you know and and and we are still in the same in in this road amen we're learning as parents and we're learning amen what to do what not to do don't do that again do okay do this more more of this you see there has to be a balance Amen in order to bring forth life amen in our in our children's and you know eventually it's God that does the work we know that eventually you can do all that you can do but eventually it's God that has to change their lives you see and if God doesn't do it then there's nothing else that you and I can do amen but what a great thing that it is that we can turn them over to God Amen what a great thing it is that we could just Lord here they are you the one who brought them in this world you're the one who gave them life amen you brought them here in this world and you I know that you have a purpose for them so here you are Lord You know here you are right that gives you a a peace of mind us as parents it gives you rest in him knowing that God is in control that's right God is in control of their lives praise the Lord amen don't worry about about them amen just live the life before them right praise God so now let's let's look again here real quick at this at this uh at the law and and and so we were talking about that God he originally well he wanted Grace he wanted Mercy he wanted love for his people amen for the children of Israel amen and and when the law of Moses was given amen as I said it was was given to for to for guidance it was given for separation from other nations so they could know amen who they were amen people knew who the CH who Israel was amen they had somebody they had a god somebody that was with them and they knew what had happened in Egypt they knew so that it was different so and there were some people amen that that they have a message in their life amen they they're following a prophet and and things happen in their life and and and and changes take place and and their children and and God does things amongst them because they have amen a word that they live by amen and that's what that's why God Amen wanted to give them that word amen that law in reality what he wanted for them to live was Grace amen and and but but but yet it was because for them to give him some sort of order in order for them to to Define amen these things in their life to Define what sin was amen right and things like that amen because Paul says that I would not know amen what what the I forgot the example he gives there I would not know about stealing if if the Bible didn't say not to steal you see if the word of God did not say don't steal you see you wouldn't have known you would have just picked up somebody's iPhone amen and and this is mine now yeah and I'm going to sell it on eBay amen and get some money out of it and it's okay it's cool you know it's it's all right you know and I'll just go around and just do that you see it it it but you see there's a law there and it's not just God's law but but there's a law there also in the books of of of of of mankind and government amen that you're not supposed to to rob people and you're not supposed to to take people's things you see and and so or else there's consequences for those things or or or take the or or or take the money off people out of people's accounts and stuff like that you're not supposed to do that or else there's there's uh there's repercussions to that if there is that in the human amen or in the government the natural how much more in God Amen why because sin was present amen amen if there was no sin there was no need for a law amen if there was no sin Amen to to that for for people to fall under amen everybody was born in sin shaped in iniquity and everybody needed some guidance in their life praise God and the children of Israel there definitely needed it but when Moses came down amen from the from the mount sin and I that was the first thing he saw he saw them there worshiping a calf a golden calf made out of gold I I'm I'm actually surprised as to how fast they made that thing right and Aaron you know when Aaron he he he Moses came to Aaron and asked him he said what is this what is going on here and Aaron said you know I just I G they gave me their their gold and they gave me all their their earrings and everything I just threw in the fire and here jumps out this calf and they decided to worship it right and and and so this it's how the it's how people are but and and what did what did Moses do he out of anger amen he throws down those those those tablets of stones and then they break amen and God of course gives them some some some other ones and that showed amen they needed amen some sort of structure in their in their life amen because again that was before the Holy Ghost amen and really that's what the Holy Ghost is supposed to do because Jesus amen he he he lived that law he fulfilled that law amen so that that spirit that fulfilled that law goes into the believer so that now you're fulfilled the law amen by that spirit amen that fulfilled the law which is the spirit of Christ praise the Lord that's good amen so now while the law itself amen it was good it it was weak Amen in that it lacked the power to change a sinful heart it could not change sinful Hearts it could not change the heart it it could make you do things amen and and if you broke them amen you'd get consequences but it would not change the heart you see and that's what I was talking about with our with children amen who don't do things because they desire to or because out of respect or out of obedience or out of respect to God it's because they they they they have to you see and and and so that's what law was that's what rules and regulations do amen really it's what causes it draws people to just do things amen just out of out of out of uh it's not from the heart amen praise the Lord and so that's what the law did it wasn't from the heart amen and that's why in the Old Testament you know when we read a case of someone showing Mercy or someone showing Grace amen after the law was introduced it's shocking to us because we think that in the Old Testament everybody lived like that Stern and and and and and and do it my way and and and but there was also people amen that God was working in their heart amen that that knew what the heart what the heart was and and and they did things amen uh uh because it was in their heart to do things you see praise the Lord Jesus and so uh one of those examples that we can see by Moses himself Moses who is a representative of the law who is remember as I as I said to you two Sundays ago God he was the law to the people he was the word to the people amen and so Moses himself when he came down from that mountain he he he he was angry and he threw down those stone tablets and and God was was was was saying Amen to the way he was acting he's like yeah I I'm I'm with you Moses I'm about to destroy these people right you better believe it and he was angry his his his anger was was was was uh was about to destroy them but what did Moses do at that moment he did he realized wait a second I may be angry God God's angry is wax amen but he threw himself between God and the people and cried for mercy and Grace for them amen the same law the same word amen cried for mercy and Grace and because he cried out amen I God heard him and the people were not destroyed amen but he did give them a choice he made them to choose amen who are you to serve this day and that's what God does to you and I amen you give Mercy he gives Grace amen but he also gives you a choice amen praise God who are you going to serve this day amen whether the gods of Egypt the gods of this world the music of this world the the people of this world the Fashions of this world Amen or are you going to serve a living God Amen in this hour praise Lord you you choose mercy and Grace was there for them the fact that they gave the they gave them opportunity to choose that was the mercy and the grace am amen and so that was that was that was Moses he did that amen interceding for the people with with empathy and compassion even though the people didn't deserve it but he knew that there was some people there that their heart was not in that they were caught up in that you see praise God then Moses again in number you can read that uh in Exodus chapter 32 but when you and then when you go over into Numbers Chapter 14 Moses again after the spies came back from the from from the Canaan and said and gave the bad report the the the children of Israel they got distraught before the Lord they got scared they got unbelief came amongst the camp that's right and Moses and CA Caleb and Joshua they were they were in the frame of mind that we are more than able to take that land we are more than and they tried to get up and try to quiet the people to to shut them up and and say listen we are more than able because that promise belongs to us but yet the people didn't even want to listen to them and so and so God was God again man I just the patience that God has with with us I tell you what with me it's it's great but I'm so thankful for it am you know sometimes we think that God is just this wrathful God and that that all that's amen but the fact that you are even still alive amen at this very moment breathing living you don't deserve it amen you're not you're not making your own body do its functions amen it's it's the that life going in through you where that life come from amen it came from God and the mercy and the grace that he has towards us amen praise the Lord and here's that mercy and Grace that he that that that Moses again he he puts himself before the people amen and he asked the Lord Lord forgive them for this sin forgive them for this because uh Lord if you destroy them what will the other nations say Here Comes God there's God oh and they'll laugh at you Lord they'll say they'll say Lord uh the Lord brought them out of Egypt wasn't wasn't was powerful enough to bring them out of Egypt but wasn't power enough to bring them into their Promised Land you see and God heard Moses and because he cried for he cried for mercy and he cried and and uh against God show God shows Grace again and the people of Israel amen they continue they had to suffer the consequences they're at kades Bara and they had to walk around the the the the desert for 40 years amen and you know I've been reading the Old Testament when Jesus said that all your when he was telling the Israel oh you're of your F you're of your father the devil and all of those that were in were in the desert they were they all ate of the same mana and they all died and you know and sometimes you might read that and you think you think uh oh well he's just maybe saying that as a me no when you reading the book of numbers they all died every single one of those people that came out of Egypt they died the ones that remained were their children their offspring amen every one of them so Jesus was was exactly right when they all of them died because of their unbelief the promised land was only like 5 days away from from Egypt am walking but yet they had to go around that mountain 40 years Amen in order to get to the to to where they needed to get and eventually they did not all get there amen amen the original ones that that came out of Egypt was Joshua and Caleb amen so in reading these examples amen it it seems like God was dealing more with Moses than than anything else you know what it seemed like it was God dealing with Moses during those those times it was trying to get Moses to react a certain way to cause him to to give him some growth you see praise the Lord and and sometimes you know we think that the trials that we have with but with our children and with our loved ones amen it may not be just for them it's for you and I as parents amen it's for you and I amen where where we are not stacking up amen it's helping us to St to be able to get our things together amen where is it that we're failing Lord where what is it that we're doing it's it's not really for them amen it's e the the work of God for them that's easy amen it's you and I that it's hard for him to work with cuz we think we know it all and we think we got it all figured out and we think that we because amen that's that's just uh because we're the parents but that's not how it works all the time amen you realize the the more and more we we see uh you know our children grow and and the things and things happen in our lives and things we realize amen Lord I don't know it all I don't know all things amen but you do you do amen and you're and you're in control and I just I just humble myself and give myself to you Lord amen praise God and so you know if you if you listen to to the the Sunday School lesson this past Sunday we were talking about Leviticus chapter 10 and in there in there at the end uh just to briefly briefly describe it that's where uh Aaron's two sons they got killed because they offered Strange Fire to the Lord in the Tabernacle and so they got killed right there in the presence of the people right in front of the people they went in there and they offered a fire that that wasn't the fire that was prescribed by God it wasn't the fire that Lit the the the the the Holy Fire you see it was something else and they went in there and as soon as they offered God killed them right there and then in front of Moses in front of Moses in front of Aaron their dad in front of their two other brothers everybody saw it because in in in Leviticus chapter 9 they had just came from a Revival the fire of God Amen was came down the presence of God came down on the back of the Tabernacle on the holy on the holy holies of holies and and the people were rejoicing and and and everything and then Leviticus chapter 10 here comes the two sons and they offer that Strange Fire and that and that Revival was quenched and the people of Israel amen they they saw this and Aaron but what like about about Aaron is that the is that he continues in that service he continues F finishing up that service even though he just saw his two sons get killed and it's interesting you put yourself in in in Aaron's shoes amen his two sons just died thinking that they were doing something for the Lord but they wasn't from their heart their heart was elsewhere and therefore God had to take kill them and here's Aaron and his two brothers and and his two other sons and they're there seeing this I'm sure that they were upset they were they were they were they were they were uh uh extra you know they were they were grief a lot of grief upon them and so Moses comes to them and asks them you know about the goat that they were supposed to eat you know just to make a long story short a goat that they were supposed to eat and they instead instead of eating them they they throw it in the fire and then they burn it up and Moses gets upset and he gets he gets mad at them and says what in the world this go you're supposed to go by the Commandments of God and you're supposed to do exactly what what the law says and you didn't do it amen and and Moses amen he he had the right to be mad at them because he was the word that word of the Lord came to him amen but Aaron gave them and you can read that in Leviticus chapter 10 Aaron says how can I eat this my sons and I being that we just went through what we went through today I just lost my two sons Aaron I just lost family members I saw them get killed in front of my eyes how can I do this before the Lord with all my heart and the Bible says in Leviticus chap 10: 20 that Moses he understood and if Moses understood that means god understood amen and he didn't didn't ask them any more questions and so Moses was there showing a form of empathy amen a form of of of of of U uh you know uh just empathy for what for what Aaron was going through amen a and sometimes amen that's what we have to do amen instead of just sometimes the law the law is there but when does when can the law be be be applied and and when does the law need to not be applied amen there are situations when that needs to happen amen and I'll give you I'll give you an an example here in just a moment but um you know when when let's just say that there's a a a lady who's who's a car that's driving really fast down the down the highway amen and and it's breaking the law it's breaking the speed limit it's breaking the law and goes by a police officer to stop and you know I say this because we we had this happened to us when my wife and I when when my wife was pregnant with Bella and we needed to get from Anderson South Carolina to Greenville and I passed by my emergency lights and I said I don't care if I get stopped I'm going amen and but we passed by a cop he didn't do anything to us though cuz he saw that we had their emergency flashers on I guess but what if that cop amen he pulls out and and and that that car is speeding and she pulls them over and stops him and they gets to the car and sees that the reason why they're driving fast because there's a pregnant woman in there about to have a baby now the cop he has two two choices he can either go ahead and apply the law give them the ticket and and and and and waste their time cuz he's wasting their time This Woman's about to give birth right and and and nothing good will come out of that the people will come out out will come out in a way think thinking something against that cop uh you know something uh I don't want to see that cop anymore amen and if I have to see him in court I'll tell him a thing or two or the other thing is the cop sees the emergency and says wait a second let me just help you and he escorts the woman to the to the hospital you see what will the lady say then afterwards what will the family think you see he the the officer he he's said wait a second let's get even faster let's go even faster to get to the to the to the hospital because there's an emergency the law was there the law said only 70 M an hour but hey we need to get to the hospital right away you see so what's going to be the outcome of that I believe good things will come out of that that officer will have respect from the family that officer will have respect amen from even even probably the people around you see because amen he did he for he he overlooked the law for a moment amen and looked at the need at the moment the need at the moment was more important praise God you see so in Leviticus in in Leviticus chapter 10 that's exactly what happened Moses overlooked the law for the moment and saw that there was a need amen there was a need at the moment Aaron was was hurt Aaron needed Amen to to to to be restored and he did what he did to do Amen in order to restore him praise God Amen let's not let's let's not amen just you know just keep hitting each other down and hurting each other amen if if a brother Falls just restore him back amen just bring that's what the Bible says to do amen we all make mistakes we all we all do things wrong amen but restoration is more powerful amen than any crushing that we can do am amen I I believe that with all my heart what what is that light for amen it's to cause light life amen praise the Lord Jesus so Jesus amen who is the life to shine upon men he came on the scene Amen in a very leg legalistic climate amen the religious leaders of that day amen the Pharisees the Sadducees amen that's all they were they were about that law amen but they didn't realize amen that there was a there was a a life amen The Life of Christ the life of the life of God that the the one who gave the law was standing right in front of them amen praise the Lord and so we know that the law amen I'm just going to go quickly here now the law we know it's not evil amen but it served as a mirror Amen to reveal the condition of our heart amen the law itself but who could fulfill that law it was Christ Christ was the only one who could fulfill that law amen and that's why when we are in Christ the law is fulfilled amen hallelujah amen we respect we don't we don't commit adultery we don't do those things but the what causes not to commit adultery is the holy spirit in US amen your own natural man will do that amen but the holy spirit in US amen the true holy spirit will cause us amen don't don't do those things amen it's it's a red light there amen that will cause us and give us to do those things John 11:7 says for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ amen we know that Jesus embodied the perfect balance between grace and law amen praise the Lord and so that same God Amen who gave law is the same God that gave us Jesus Christ amen it's the same person amen why because he wanted it to balance it amen because he said in Matthew Chapter 5 he said you you you've read where you know this that and the other amen but I say unto you amen you read where if somebody smacks you you know smack them again I can't remember what exactly what it says there but you do this amen eye for an eye tooth for a tooth you see and but Jesus says but I say unto you amen love your enemies do good to them that despitefully hate you amen so it's bringing both things together it's bringing law but it's bringing Grace at the same time you see praise the Lord and that's what Jesus came to do amen but when we're just always just looking at law law law amen that will never bring that the law never saved anybody in the Old Testament law never gave anybody the Holy Ghost law amen only put you in jail but when Grace came amen and applied that law to it amen it could save people then amen Grace that's what I need I need that light I need that life first before I can get that before I can walk in that light amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so I don't I just don't want letter laws rules amen and and regulations amen I want love Mercy Grace amen first those things that can actually change me amen amen and you know there was a there was a with this well let me just let me just read this quote you know brother brandom I read this quote Sunday but brother brandom said this he said now I said to brother Schism to and brother NES to answer your question I said now I do not take either sides with you Brethren and I know as long as you fuss you are both wrong see because I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart amen then to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart see I said after all it's your heart's condition praise the Lord Jesus amen a person a person that can have perfect theology amen and be devoid of love and compassion and it won't lead to anything you see you you can have because when you have amen the right Doctrine amen but don't have the right Spirit there you you're already set in your ways and there's no room there for growth but when you have the right Spirit even though you may not have the right Doctrine you're that's room for growth that same Spirit can lead me to the right Doctrine you see so it's better to have a right spirit amen good amen a right spirit amen when we deal with people amen praise God and and so uh true love and sincerity amen should be the foundation of a Christian's life amen not just rules and regulations amen not just rules and regulations there was a story I was reading um it was in 2015 and uh about Judge uh Oliva and a veteran amen and it happened in North Carolina and this judge he he he it says that that uh he showed compassion to a veteran named Joe Cerna who violated his probation by lying about a urine test for a a DWI charge and so this Joe Cerna he he was a a veteran and so was uh a veteran in Afghanistan he had went to multiple tours multiple I think people even went to Iraq and things like that but this judge he had to apply the law to him he gave him a night in jail for for for failing to to to fulfill what he was supposed to do with that DWI charge he gave him a night in jail but he knew this judge knew that this man was going through issues in his life he was he was suffering from PTSD he he he was having problems with with all these things you know that that that sometimes soldiers they come back and they they suffer and he this judge having been a soldier himself he knew that this man was going through this so the judge he ordered for him to spend one night in jail so here's Joe CNA he goes into jail and he says in his testimony that I felt like I wasn't even going to make it that night because I knew I was going to go through my mind he said I was thinking about that accident apparently he was in an accident with three of his other comrades a truck flipped over and they they landed upside down and the the smell of kerosene and and smoke and things that's all he could smell and that would keep coming in his mind he would smell kerosene and all these things and as he was there in in in uh they put him in the cell and about couple of maybe an hour or so later I don't know exactly the judge walks in and asks the the the the guard to let him in the same judge that put him in there walks in and the judge spends the whole night with him in that in that cell and he talks to him and he lets Joe talk to him back and they're talking and they're commun he said I would know I don't know if I would have made it if that judge the one that put me in there was the one that was that helped me at the same time and that's a true story in 2015 in North Carolina and so I you know that impressed me you see cuz the judge got in in in his shoes or in his boots so to speak you see he put himself in his shoes and he was able to help this man amen to be able to spend that one night in jail because he put himself in that position as well the judge didn't need to do that amen he was the judge he could been at home and sleeping in his nice bed with his wife and his family and stuff but he put himself in his shoes and he spend that night in there and I thought that was that was impressive if a judge I don't know if the man was Christian or not but if he wasn't amen what a wonderful thing he did for another human being how much more another human being with the Holy Ghost can do for another brother or sister with the Holy Ghost amen put ourselves in each other's shoes amen and we'll see things a little bit different we'll look at each other a little bit differently and maybe there might not be misunderstandings amen we'll look at things a little bit differently when we put in each other's shoes amen amen so we want that life amen the life amen to help us walk in that light amen praise the Lord Jesus God bless you Saints let's stand to our feet amen let's have musicians come and maybe we can sing we'll walk in the light that beautiful light or if you had something else brother an that's
