[0:00] foreign

[0:10] I hooked the Marion Esther at all so but
[0:13] we sure appreciate brother John for
[0:15] filling in last Sunday I sure
[0:17] appreciated that Sunday school message I
[0:19] listen I listen while I'm working in the
[0:21] in the yard or whatever
[0:23] and I sure was a blessing
[0:28] let me see here
[0:30] let's get back maybe we might uh finish
[0:33] up kind of talking about Sunday serpent
[0:36] seed uh today we'll we'll see if we can
[0:39] get through some of these remaining
[0:40] slides but
[0:41] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[0:43] Lord God we ask Lord that you'll just
[0:45] bless us here this morning as we study
[0:47] these things out Lord God let you'll
[0:48] bless our study and
[0:50] bless uh Lord our hearts Lord as the
[0:53] people of gathered or that they'll come
[0:54] expecting to hear from you today Lord
[0:56] and that you'll just bless brother wait
[0:58] as he's studying preparing for the
[0:59] sermons today Lord granted Lord that
[1:01] you'll just help us today we ask in your
[1:03] name amen
[1:06] now in Ephesians Church age brother
[1:09] Brown and said
[1:11] speaking about this situation I got a
[1:12] little graveyard picture you know I I I
[1:15] take a little effort to put these
[1:18] pictures in here because it really Nails
[1:19] home the point of you know to things to
[1:22] think about that um the Adam made a
[1:25] decision here in in back in Genesis and
[1:28] the decision he made uh caused the uh
[1:32] you know ever you go through struggles
[1:34] in life and you you go through
[1:36] heartaches and sickness and people
[1:38] getting sick with cancer and struggling
[1:40] with illness and death and all those
[1:42] things and you can look back it all
[1:43] started from that from that decision of
[1:46] course it had to be that way you know
[1:47] everything was was ordained so that
[1:50] God's attributes could be manifested and
[1:52] so forth
[1:53] well let's see what brother Brown said
[1:54] about in Ephesians Church age he said
[1:56] Adam took her back he knew exactly what
[1:58] he was doing but he did it anyway and
[2:01] you see that's that's something to know
[2:03] that you're what you're doing is wrong
[2:05] but just to go and and and just step
[2:07] right over you see what what Adam did is
[2:10] the thing in Adam the Bible says in Adam
[2:11] all die because Adam made that decision
[2:14] knowing that he was going the wrong path
[2:17] that he was accepting that what what his
[2:19] wife believed was wrong
[2:21] and what his wife had done was wrong
[2:24] she was a part of him and he was willing
[2:26] to take her responsibility upon himself
[2:28] he would not let her go so Eve conceived
[2:30] by him he knew she would he knew exactly
[2:32] what would happen to the human race and
[2:35] he sold the human race into sin that he
[2:37] might have Eve for he loved her and so
[2:39] those two sons were born sons that would
[2:42] be the fathers of the human race that
[2:44] was even now polluted so we wanted just
[2:47] this morning kind of examine
[2:49] how it got polluted and how to get
[2:52] unpolluted
[2:54] that's why in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4
[2:56] it says by faith Abel offered unto God a
[2:58] more excellent sacrifice than came by
[3:00] which he obtained witness that he was
[3:01] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[3:04] and by it being dead
[3:07] and by it he being dead yet speaketh oh
[3:11] let's just keep meditating on what faith
[3:12] is that Faith the difference between
[3:14] Cain and Abel here Cain had a good
[3:16] theology it understood a lot he'd been
[3:18] taught a lot but faith faith is I was
[3:21] listening the other day to Invisible
[3:22] Union and brother Branham just really
[3:24] Nails in faith is a revelation and all
[3:26] those things faith faith takes the uh
[3:29] the Theology and puts it together so you
[3:32] know what it is
[3:33] just like I use an example you know we
[3:36] quote many times where I know what the
[3:38] first seal is because I can read where
[3:39] brother random said my revelation of the
[3:41] first seal is and he lays it out right
[3:43] there but do you know what it is like do
[3:46] you have a revelation of what it is and
[3:48] that applies all throughout the
[3:49] scripture we can read things about it
[3:51] but when God comes and reveals it to you
[3:54] it takes it to a level where it like
[3:57] brother Dale used to use the example if
[3:59] you dump out all the parts on the floor
[4:00] of the car if you've got if you
[4:02] understand you can put it back together
[4:04] because you know how it works you know
[4:07] and that's what faith is revelation that
[4:09] you know because it comes from God of
[4:11] faith faith is a a something
[4:14] Supernatural that God gives you
[4:17] and I was I was reading the other day
[4:19] what brother brother Dale said in the
[4:21] seventh seal when he was preaching that
[4:22] about when when God faith is such a
[4:26] supernatural thing
[4:27] that when God gives you a revelation and
[4:29] I'm just paraphrasing so y'all excuse me
[4:31] I don't
[4:33] that when God gives you a revelation you
[4:35] know that God is with you because it's
[4:38] not something that you got from just
[4:40] reading and understand like reading the
[4:42] book of Shakespeare or something
[4:44] but God gave that to you so you know God
[4:47] is on the scene
[4:50] that's really I think that should help
[4:52] us all that it's not based on feelings
[4:54] or emotions or something but when God
[4:56] shows you something in the Bible and you
[4:58] can read and understand what that door
[5:01] in heaven was and the whole scene in
[5:04] Revelation 4 and the whole scene in
[5:05] Revelation 3 and you can understand
[5:06] these things have been mysteries for
[5:08] years you know that God is on the scene
[5:13] so in the spoken word is the Original
[5:15] Seed he said she got in a hurry Eve got
[5:18] in a hurry in our trouble we want to we
[5:21] want to rush things and hurry things up
[5:23] and and say we got it when we don't
[5:26] she got in a hurry and what did she do
[5:28] she crossed her seed she mingled it with
[5:31] the serpency and when she did she
[5:33] brought what did she bring she brought a
[5:34] child of death a child that now now
[5:36] listen to what kind of my point my
[5:39] sticking point this morning is because
[5:40] there's I want to look at some of the
[5:42] false doctrines and things and things
[5:43] that the naysayers say about the message
[5:45] that they'll say well they say that
[5:47] they're just a little special group that
[5:49] because if if you got the right lineage
[5:51] or whatever but look what brother I'm
[5:52] saying he said a child that she
[5:55] perverted every child after that now see
[5:58] that that just puts us all in one bucket
[6:00] that we all need a redeemer we all need
[6:03] a sacrifice we all need a blood covering
[6:06] there's not something special about some
[6:09] group or some other because we all have
[6:11] a soul that gives us the ability to go
[6:13] this way or that way we all have a soul
[6:15] that allows us to make a choice but we
[6:18] all were come come wrong because of what
[6:21] happened in the garden
[6:23] now
[6:25] if you can really see where I'm going
[6:27] this morning I wonder how many get
[6:30] nervous
[6:32] hold on now
[6:34] it might be good to get to get nervous
[6:36] because that'll that'll keep us awake
[6:38] and attentive
[6:39] and brother Brown said in the Ephesian
[6:40] Church age he said then that was to come
[6:42] a day when God would appear in flesh and
[6:45] by means of his humiliation he would
[6:46] restore Fallen man and make him a
[6:48] partaker of that life eternal once you
[6:51] see this you can understand the serpent
[6:53] seed and know that it was no apple evade
[6:56] it wasn't no apple
[6:57] no what what was it and I got see
[7:00] there's picture doesn't really drive
[7:01] home the point of a tree that's dead and
[7:04] a tree that's alive and you mix those
[7:06] two together and now you got what this
[7:08] picture that brother Brown was painting
[7:09] for us and as he preached the Ephesian
[7:11] Church age what it was it was the
[7:14] degradation of humanity by intermingling
[7:17] the seed the degradation of humanity by
[7:20] interim England the seed so now that
[7:22] puts us all into one's condition that we
[7:24] all need a savior and the invisible
[7:26] Union of the bride of Christ that sermon
[7:28] I was listening to the other night while
[7:30] I was working in the yard he said her
[7:31] body has given her a sacred Trust From
[7:33] God no female dog no bird no other
[7:35] animal no other creature like that no
[7:37] she's the only one but she is the reason
[7:39] is so sacred she is to bring forth life
[7:41] into the Earth her body is the bedding
[7:44] grounds of life therefore that's the
[7:46] reason she is give this sacred Trust
[7:49] oh you think about that that we've been
[7:51] given a sacred trust to bring forth the
[7:52] word of God that you have the ability to
[7:55] choose uh left or right wrong or right
[7:59] you got the ability to go in either
[8:00] direction now he said now here's where
[8:02] you may disagree many youth theologians
[8:05] that's what defile
[8:07] part of the human race no the whole
[8:10] human race that's what defiled the whole
[8:13] human race is that adultery at the
[8:15] beginning her betting ground was marred
[8:18] she brought forth those twins Cain and
[8:20] Abel one act two children search the
[8:22] scriptures one act two children now I
[8:25] got kind of a rough a rough picture that
[8:28] you can see what when he when eve took
[8:30] that lie of the of the devil and mingled
[8:33] it with the truth of God's word well you
[8:35] can see here I've got faith on the left
[8:36] unbelief on the right
[8:38] it polluted her the womb of her mind
[8:40] where she was unable to bring forth a a
[8:43] child the way that God had intended and
[8:46] he said now the womb he received the
[8:48] wrong c word and that's in the spoken
[8:50] word is the Original Seed and he said
[8:51] and again the bride what Mighty have
[8:53] become polluted Adam's bride now because
[8:56] she never stayed with God's word that
[8:59] right
[9:00] so it polluted
[9:02] mingling mingling two things mingling
[9:05] the truth and the false mingling right
[9:09] and wrong causes a polluted state
[9:12] oh you see you see why God told told
[9:15] them in the garden the day you eat
[9:17] thereof of that tree of knowledge of
[9:19] Good and Evil that day you die and
[9:21] that's the thing that mankind has been
[9:23] struggling to get back from ever since
[9:25] is to to to come back to the full word
[9:28] which is why God gave us a prophet in
[9:30] this last day to restore the full word
[9:33] that's one of the greatest promises in
[9:36] the Bible and that Prophet that Prophet
[9:37] Joel prophesied that I will restore what
[9:40] he'll restore the full word because one
[9:42] word off in the beginning caused death
[9:44] and if we restore back the full word if
[9:47] God brings us back to the forward then
[9:50] it will bring bring us back to that
[9:52] original condition where we are in in
[9:54] control of ourselves but we've got
[9:57] Temperance that we're in control and the
[9:59] patience of God and all those other
[10:00] things and that and that puts us in a
[10:03] condition where we are able to speak the
[10:05] word and that we're able to bring us
[10:07] back right into the same condition that
[10:09] they were in where we're able to have
[10:12] control over ourselves and control over
[10:14] that create like brother Adam said we're
[10:15] created create an atmosphere
[10:17] you can create an atmosphere control
[10:19] over the atmosphere of your surroundings
[10:21] and so forth
[10:23] now you see the pollution she accepted a
[10:27] one word off she she believed one word
[10:30] off and it polluted the womb of her mind
[10:34] and it also polluted her natural womb
[10:37] you see where brother Raymond said in
[10:39] Joseph meeting his brother he said the
[10:40] Bible said he was the most subtle of all
[10:42] the beasts not reptile of all the field
[10:45] he was the one who beguiled the woman in
[10:47] his Beauty and she conceived and now by
[10:49] doing that and seeing sin was coming God
[10:51] put such a curse upon him until science
[10:53] will never find any relationship between
[10:55] this serpent as known today in mankind
[10:58] but there is your Fallen degraded being
[11:01] between that hooked the animal life
[11:04] together hooked it all together now you
[11:06] can see uh Adam and Eve there on the
[11:09] left I put in yellow and and you you
[11:12] take that Beast line on the right and
[11:14] before long you got I I got a little
[11:16] Melting Pot before long you get and get
[11:19] it all Blended together like brother for
[11:21] example brother Aaron has been uh
[11:23] showing how that uh you know he's
[11:25] related to all these different people
[11:26] you start tracing your lineage back and
[11:28] you find out whoops I'm related to Elvis
[11:31] Presley whoops I'm related to uh uh
[11:34] somebody in history that uh killed a
[11:36] bunch of people and or whatever you
[11:38] before long you get bound down to this
[11:40] one little family Noah's Ark that they
[11:42] were on the no on the ark and then and
[11:45] brother Brandon wanted us he said man
[11:46] can find monkeys and chimpanzees
[11:49] chimpanzees and so forth but they can't
[11:51] find that link the link that what that
[11:54] connects man and Beast together there he
[11:58] is God cursed him so far he can't come
[12:01] back again that's on him for this evil
[12:03] act that he did he was the only seed
[12:05] that would mix
[12:07] yeah
[12:09] make sure I'm on the right slide and
[12:11] brother Ram said in the Ephesian Church
[12:13] age he said I want to go into some
[12:15] certain proof we have that there is a
[12:17] definite Affinity between man and animal
[12:19] animal it is a physical thing and I got
[12:22] two sales there and we'll get into what
[12:24] Affinity means in just a second he said
[12:26] do you know that you can take the embryo
[12:28] cells from an unborn fetus and inject
[12:30] them into human beings then those
[12:32] thyroid cells will go right to the human
[12:34] thyroid the kidney cells will go right
[12:36] to the human kidneys do you realize how
[12:38] stupendous this is some intelligence
[12:40] guides those animal cells exactly to the
[12:43] right place that intelligence accepts
[12:45] those cells and puts them in exactly the
[12:47] right place there is an affinity between
[12:50] animal and man they can't intermingle
[12:53] and reproduce that has been tried but
[12:55] back in the garden that intermingling
[12:58] did take place and the chemical Affinity
[13:01] which still exists proves it for back in
[13:05] Eden the serpent was an upright creature
[13:06] he was close to man he was almost man
[13:09] Satan took advantage of the Serpent's
[13:11] physical characteristics to use him to
[13:13] beguile Eve then God destroyed that
[13:15] pattern of the serpent no other Beast
[13:17] can co-mingle with man but the Affinity
[13:20] is there and Affinity means you take you
[13:23] take a liver cell and you put it in your
[13:24] bloodstream it's going to attract itself
[13:26] to the liver you take uh what whatever
[13:29] kind of cell and you you you it's gonna
[13:32] it's and what he's saying is you can
[13:34] take a one of those types of cells from
[13:36] an animal put it into a human and it's
[13:38] going to move toward that same kind of
[13:39] cell in a human because there's an
[13:42] affinity Affinity is the tendency of
[13:44] cells to adhere specifically to cells of
[13:47] the same type but not to sales of a
[13:49] different type so brother man said in
[13:51] the spoken words the original CD said
[13:53] she brought death through a bastard-born
[13:55] child which we all are children of but
[13:58] God Came In the Flesh to give us another
[14:00] birth to bring us back to original sons
[14:03] and Daughters of God what am I what are
[14:06] you talking about this morning brother
[14:07] Bob I'm trying to say that like Paul
[14:09] said we have no confidence in the flesh
[14:11] I don't have confidence I don't have any
[14:13] confidence in where my natural lineage
[14:16] came from but what I have confidence in
[14:18] this morning is the lineage of Christ if
[14:21] I can get tapped into the new birth and
[14:22] get tapped into the eternal life of God
[14:24] that will override everything that that
[14:27] was messed up by the Fall In the Garden
[14:29] of Eden that was messed up by the
[14:31] pollution of Eve's natural mind of the
[14:33] pollution of her mind that prevented her
[14:35] from being able to bring forth children
[14:37] the right way the pollution of her womb
[14:39] that was able that would be able to
[14:41] bring forth a child in the way that God
[14:43] wanted to and just how everything just
[14:45] got all mixed up and matched up you need
[14:48] to be born again you need to be born
[14:50] again because we were born wrong and we
[14:52] need to be born again not by man's ideas
[14:54] and man's thoughts and things but by the
[14:56] word of God
[14:58] brother Adam said if folk can finish
[14:59] this quote he said God Came In the Flesh
[15:01] to give us another birth to bring us
[15:03] back to original Sons and Daughters of
[15:05] God see there you are the life sperm of
[15:08] Eve never happened it never did why she
[15:10] mingled it kept it away instead of
[15:12] adding Adam coming to her for a bride
[15:15] when the time appointed would be just
[15:17] like will would have come to the group
[15:18] Christ would have come to his church he
[15:21] promised it
[15:22] now this this kind of ties in together
[15:25] with a lot of Old Testament scriptures
[15:27] that that people use to refute
[15:29] Christianity and say well why would God
[15:31] say this in the Old Testament so I just
[15:33] want to briefly look at some of these
[15:35] like
[15:36] because God was so against mixing the
[15:39] truth and fault mixing things up because
[15:42] you mix it up and you you can't bring it
[15:44] back to the original
[15:45] so in Deuteronomy chapter 22 it says
[15:47] Thou shalt not sow thy venue with
[15:49] diverse seeds don't don't sow your
[15:51] vineyard with with well let's say true
[15:53] and false lest the fruit of thy seed
[15:56] which thou has sown and the fruit of thy
[15:58] Vineyard be defiled don't plow your
[16:01] field with an ox and a nice together and
[16:03] you think well that doesn't make any
[16:04] sense but it makes sense in the context
[16:06] of what we're talking about how the
[16:08] degradation of humanity began because of
[16:11] mixing things up
[16:13] so God was so against mixing things up
[16:16] that he even told the Israelites don't
[16:18] plow your field with an ox and an ass
[16:20] together just just if you're going to
[16:22] apply your field let them both be oxes
[16:24] or let them both be donkeys but but
[16:26] don't mix things up don't don't even
[16:29] make a garment with different kind of
[16:31] fabrics don't make a garment with with
[16:32] uh polyester and a garment with cotton
[16:35] and because we want to keep things pure
[16:38] we want it we want to you mixing things
[16:41] up just messes everything up Thou shalt
[16:44] not wear a garment of diver sorts as a
[16:46] Woolen and linen together and brother
[16:47] Adam said in the meanest man I know he
[16:49] said not only have we high-breeded fruit
[16:51] animals but we've hybrid religion has to
[16:54] be babied and petted it's not the
[16:56] original we try to take the word of God
[16:58] and breed it into something else and
[16:59] breed it over here and it becomes a
[17:01] bunch of delicate babies that we have to
[17:03] baby and they can't take the real word
[17:07] aren't you glad this morning that we're
[17:08] able to take the real word aren't you
[17:11] glad to be able to take a good gospel
[17:13] spanking or a good gospel's golden gonna
[17:15] shape you up and mold you into a real
[17:17] genuine Christian that don't have to be
[17:18] babied and put moved over into the hot
[17:20] house for a little bit
[17:23] oh well that'll that'll preach but
[17:27] but let's let me let me pause here and
[17:30] let's look at what the some of the
[17:32] naysayers of the message say because
[17:33] they'll use these they'll use a
[17:35] misinterpretation of what brother
[17:37] random's Doctrine is to poke at what
[17:39] people we believe and then so for
[17:41] example they'll say uh this this one
[17:43] article I found I think it was on
[17:45] Wikipedia they say to hear it so the
[17:46] white supremacist theology which is
[17:48] known as two as two sea lion Christian
[17:50] identity don't believe that the Jew
[17:53] before I get in this let me just give a
[17:55] brief explanation people try to
[17:57] associate that they discredit the
[18:00] serpent Seed doctrine about trying to
[18:01] make it something racist or trying to
[18:03] make it exclusionary which is in some
[18:07] cases a lot of people in the message
[18:08] have done saying by saying that if
[18:11] you're come from the specific line in
[18:14] the flesh that you can be saved but if
[18:17] you can't have it then you can't be
[18:19] saved and and they and and so that
[18:21] people will take that and explode it out
[18:22] into well if you if you're if you're a a
[18:26] why person and we will read this if
[18:29] you're white you can be saved if you
[18:30] come from the right lineage you can be
[18:32] saved but the people that can't be saved
[18:34] that's where the black people and Jews
[18:36] and all this other they put them in that
[18:38] in that and and you see they twist up
[18:41] the truth and and I just want to declare
[18:43] this morning that I don't stand for none
[18:45] of that Tommy Rock that's a bunch of
[18:47] trash and that is not what
[18:51] yeah you go back and listen to the
[18:53] serpent seed message and brother Graham
[18:54] said that a black man can give a white
[18:56] man a blood transfusion and I can
[18:58] actually live off of his same blood
[19:00] because we're made the same we're all
[19:03] made the same and so they twist that and
[19:04] say well well see brother random was
[19:07] promoting a racist idea but there's no
[19:09] racist racism or anything any any
[19:12] inclination of that and any of the
[19:14] things that he taught if you would just
[19:16] go back and listen to it listen to what
[19:17] he really said
[19:19] that what he really said was we're all
[19:22] lumped in this together and we all need
[19:24] a redeemer we all need a lamb sacrifice
[19:27] and that's why Abel brought a lamb
[19:30] because he knew the only way back was
[19:32] through the blood of something and it
[19:34] had to be an animal because an animal
[19:36] was the one that that caused the mess in
[19:38] the beginning that the Beast so let an
[19:40] animal brother around sit in in one of
[19:42] the churches Messengers messages it was
[19:45] animal life that caused it so let animal
[19:47] life pay the price until finally Christ
[19:50] had come on the scene and die for us and
[19:52] his blood can have an effect in your
[19:54] life and change you and begin to redeem
[19:57] your soul and begin to work outward
[19:59] change in your spirit until one day your
[20:02] body will be changed see your your flesh
[20:05] got messed up in the beginning but God
[20:07] has got an antidote for that he's got a
[20:09] way to redeem your flesh the same way
[20:12] that he redeemed your soul and your
[20:14] spirit now let me get back to this quote
[20:17] and we'll get carried away
[20:19] he said adherence of the white
[20:21] supremacist theology this this is this
[20:23] quote I got on the internet which is
[20:24] known as two seed line Christian
[20:25] identity did I believe that the Jews are
[20:27] the chosen people of God because in
[20:30] their view only white people are the
[20:31] descendants of Adam and hence the chosen
[20:33] people of God
[20:34] according to their belief members of all
[20:36] other races are descended from Cain and
[20:38] are thus descended from Satan especially
[20:40] Jews and blacks this belief was
[20:42] popularized by Wesley Smith
[20:45] Conrad guard Dan Gaiman and William
[20:48] Potter among others the opposing faction
[20:50] is called one seed line Christian
[20:52] identity because the said here and sold
[20:54] the view that all people are descended
[20:55] from Adam but they believe that only
[20:57] Aryans meaning Northern Europeans or
[21:00] God's chosen people now let's see how
[21:02] they tie this in with brother Randall
[21:04] according to this guy named Stephen
[21:06] Hassan brother branham's sermons lay the
[21:08] foundation to believe that black people
[21:09] are the inferior race
[21:11] Branham used the term hybrid to describe
[21:14] anything he believed to be tainted by
[21:16] the serpent which he did not oh you see
[21:19] how see how it easy it is for somebody
[21:21] to twist things into something that's
[21:23] and it's so important you you kind of
[21:27] have your own Revelation your own
[21:29] experience that's why you got it when
[21:31] you hear somebody say something about a
[21:33] church or doctor or whatever go about
[21:35] yourself and search things out and find
[21:38] out if it really is true what people are
[21:40] saying because I if you go back and
[21:42] listen to what brother Brown and
[21:43] preached in the serpent seed and a
[21:45] visible unit and all these things you
[21:47] can't come away with this kind of
[21:49] understanding they're just trying to use
[21:50] it to discredit and I think you know we
[21:53] sometimes we shy away from these things
[21:55] because you know I I I I think we should
[21:58] uh I think it's helpful to just um
[22:01] people are battling this kind of stuff
[22:03] out all the time I think it's helpful to
[22:05] just just put it right out there in the
[22:06] open and shine a spotlight on the mess
[22:08] that this is
[22:10] Branham accused Eve of producing a
[22:13] hybrid race certainly she produced a
[22:15] hybrid race and he provided a way to
[22:17] trace the hybrid line of the serpent
[22:18] seed to Africans and Jews no not like
[22:21] that no through ham the biblical
[22:23] progenitor of the African peoples King
[22:25] Ahab Judas Iscariot Roman Catholics and
[22:28] the future Antichrist how are you going
[22:30] to trace the serpent seed not not
[22:32] through your flesh like that but you
[22:34] trace the serpent seed by what you
[22:36] believe today but while just like how
[22:39] Eve disbelieved God's word and took one
[22:42] word off today you can still take one
[22:45] word off and believe the lie of the
[22:48] devil the believing the light of the
[22:51] devil is what what produces It produced
[22:54] the mess in the beginning and it's going
[22:55] to produce a mess in the end time and
[22:57] that's why God sent us the antidote and
[23:00] a message that would restore tie up all
[23:02] the Loose Ends and type all the
[23:04] misunderstandings and all the confusion
[23:07] and give us Clarity in an age where
[23:09] everybody is confused yeah and the
[23:12] person that wrote this is clearly
[23:13] confused he said Michael Birkin wrote
[23:16] that Branham was the most significant
[23:17] proponent of the Rachel teaching racist
[23:20] teaching teaching outside of the
[23:22] Christian identity movement and directly
[23:24] influenced their theology which is a lie
[23:27] of the devil it's a straight up lie of
[23:29] the devil just like so many of these
[23:32] things that people say that if you go
[23:34] research is just a lie like that brother
[23:36] Brown said that Hattie Wright's daughter
[23:38] was going to be healed that's a lie he
[23:40] never said that he said if God told me
[23:42] that she would be healed she'll come out
[23:44] of that out of that wheelchair or
[23:45] whatever she was in so many things it's
[23:48] a lie a lie just like the devil spun to
[23:51] Eve in the beginning that where he just
[23:53] take just one little word that's close
[23:55] and just twist it until it's it just it
[23:59] can't produce anything real
[24:01] so brother man said in the spoken word
[24:03] is the Original Seed if we go back to
[24:04] that quote he said to every man no
[24:07] matter whether he's the Pope priest
[24:10] Bishop whatever he is he dies because
[24:13] he's a hybrid
[24:15] now that puts us all in the same
[24:16] category oh well bless God I I'm sure I
[24:20] can trace my lineage back to Adam
[24:21] somehow or or whatever whatever you'd
[24:23] say
[24:24] but no matter whether you're a pope
[24:27] priest Bishop whatever you are whatever
[24:30] you are you need a redeemer whatever you
[24:33] are and you need a savior
[24:35] that means whether you're a prophet a
[24:38] priest a king whatever
[24:40] that's exactly he was born between who
[24:43] Satan and Eve and they call it whatever
[24:46] you want to it was Satan and Eve the
[24:49] original word had nothing to do with it
[24:51] the original word was life he had hybrid
[24:54] it and it brought death
[24:56] that's why in Genesis chapter 2 God told
[24:59] him that the tree of knowledge of Good
[25:00] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[25:02] the tree of knowledge of good take some
[25:05] good
[25:06] it takes some evil
[25:07] and
[25:09] God didn't want us to know about evil he
[25:11] just wanted us to know about good to
[25:13] know him
[25:14] right he said God didn't want us to know
[25:17] about pornography and he didn't want us
[25:19] to know about addiction to cigarettes he
[25:21] didn't want us to know about all the
[25:22] filth that you learned in school he
[25:24] didn't want us to know about all he
[25:25] wanted us to just have faith and
[25:26] confidence in him
[25:28] you eat of the tree of the knowledge of
[25:30] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[25:32] for in the day that thou eatst thereof
[25:33] Thou shalt surely die
[25:35] the message one that he said his kingdom
[25:37] Satan's kingdom can promise nothing but
[25:39] death that's all he has he's the author
[25:42] of death
[25:43] he can promise lies but he's the father
[25:45] of Lies he can't give you life he can't
[25:48] give you Heaven he has no heaven to give
[25:50] you think of it one word to disbelieve
[25:52] God through a promise of the devil or
[25:54] his Machinery one word
[25:57] sends you into torment
[26:00] one word twist it up and we'll stop
[26:02] there but that's something to think
[26:03] about that God can the devil can take
[26:05] one word take the serpent Seed doctrine
[26:07] and twist it up and make it racist take
[26:10] one word twist it twist it up and say
[26:12] well the promise of the Holy Ghost ain't
[26:13] for you and give you torment one word
[26:15] off and say well some people just can't
[26:18] get it no matter how much they want it
[26:20] some people but I want to I want to end
[26:22] on this that the promise is to whosoever
[26:25] will it doesn't matter where you come
[26:28] from in your flesh I have no confidence
[26:30] in the flesh but I have confidence in
[26:31] what Jesus Christ did for me
[26:34] [Applause]
