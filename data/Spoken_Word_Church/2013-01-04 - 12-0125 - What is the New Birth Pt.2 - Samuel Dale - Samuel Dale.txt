house of the Lord if youd like turning your scriptures turn where we were reading there Sunday from John 3 and then we'll go to Ephesians 2 John 3 Ephesians 2 I wrote something else down I need to check what I wrote down for it would be good to read that but I won't anyhow just remember Wade and and June will be over with brother brother um dut Dutch Scott this weekend so remember them is they traveling just pray one for another I know there's a lot of sicknesses you know a lot of the kids are sick and we're sorry about that and Zoe and KK they they didn't get to get their birthdays cuz they're a little bit late getting here but they did sing but happy birthday to you okay so today is their birthday and and we appreciate it amen uh I think all the announcements has been made I'm try to look back on my other notes make sure I keep them not okay let's just pray and go on into the to the word father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things we know you give them to us freely so thank you we just pray now that you'd bless us as we speak about you and try to talk a little bit to the people about the thought that's on our mind and you just come and be with each and every one of us that we may all be one together in you is our prayer we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us Lord sanctify us make us a fresh in you in you and just come now and speak to us as we read your word we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen John 3 very familiar scripture with all of us there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's wound and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again and we went through that this past Sunday trying to cover you know that Nicodemus must have been a pretty good believer we said well all we got to do is believe so he must have been pretty good one he put his life on the line his job and everything and confessed that that no man could do these things unless God be with him that's right all right now let's go to Ephesians 2 and we just read verse 89 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to review just a little bit and then we'll try to move on into the to the message I had a bunch of quotes there Sunday to you know just scan across but we didn't get to them but I want to make sure you understand that what we're trying to bring we're talking about just simply what is the new birth all right and we have a lot of young people with us we have a lot of young people on the internet interet system and everything that you know maybe they've never heard really anybody talk about you know the new birth and so we just you know chose that point to do and because way has has the list there of all the people you know that put their families on there to be prayed for and the things and you know when they you you can take this to them and and say well okay just listen there and you'll see what we believe the new birth is am you know and let them up their own mind if they will listen if not then just hold on to it until they get around to where they will listen and just keep believing and accepting them you know for them because uh you know they they really in a position to where that to be lost is a bad thing right but you know we can believe for them and it's not that it'll save them but it sure puts them in a good place because somebody's praying for you you always I always want somebody to pray for me that it wouldn't matter to me if it was a pope of Rome you know I wouldn't no problem against him if I saw him I'd say pray for me you know I used we used to have a woman preacher there at the plant you know when someone would say well you mean you'd ask a woman preacher to pray first you do you know because if she can touch God that's all I'm interested in is somebody that can touch God all right but now I tried to cover some things to where we wouldn't be confused in our thoughts and we covered then Sunday that there's not three works of Grace because that would be lining up into the line of works right and it's not works it's all salvation of the Lord but it's in three stages you know three stages of Salvation not three works of Salvation see if you said it's three works you would have justification one work sanctification another work the baptism would be another work and that wouldn't that wouldn't line up up see and it's not that it's three stages it's the same holy ghost that justifies you it's the same holy ghost that sanctifies you it's the same holy ghost that fills your soul you know and gives you eternal life all right but now to we want you to understand truly that we believe that you know like I was bringing out Sunday if you truly repent of your sins and if you died right there in that state yes you would go to heaven that's right I don't believe you would be the bride of Christ right because you would only be in a repentant stage of justification but still if you died in that condition you know believing that holding on then sure one day you'll receive eternal life at wiro judgment but that that would be a wonderful thing to to think about you know to think about getting everybody wants to they want to win a lottery you know and and you know just get millions of dollars well what good is it right you know it's just no good I like what one guy seen it in the paper yesterday he hit the lottery one time for $115,000 or something like that and he hit it for 750,000 he just took the ticket signed it where nobody else couldn't uh cash it or anything if it got lost and put in his pocket and went on working he said I'll just wait like the first of year where the taxes be cheaper he didn't care you know well that's that's I like that idea better than being so hog tied you know you want to run after every dollar but anyhow but we believe in three manifestations right because that will tie together to understand the new birth then will tie together to where that it helps us to understand the godhead amen because God is not three persons he's God manifested in three ways Father Son and Holy Ghost there are many many ways that he can manifest himself but that way we can put it all together and and you can see your new birth tying together with with God revealing himself and that's why I've always told you that's the way I check a a Doctrine when I'm listening to somebody I I'm listening to see if what they're preaching Compares with what happened in my life am because if they telling me something contrary to what's happened to me I I I just can't accept it that way I I want to stay with what the Lord's revealed me to me you know and through my life all right but we were trying to cover that to get it that it was not three wordss we gave the quotes and than and the prophet that it was three manifestation or three stages all right we'll read that in a minute from future home but then we we're trying to cover that he that comes to God must believe that he is amen all right now not that he was as I told you history can prove that Jesus Christ existed right they can prove they have the proof that he was crucified right they have all of that is natural proof but that doesn't save anybody it's not that to just say I believe in God or I believe Jesus Christ come on that's fine but if it's not something to believe that he is now right the same yesterday today and forever then we'd be in trouble so we we try to emphasize and I want to make sure you you follow that point that you know if you want to be saved the thing to do is to believe that God is Right amen right well I believe Jesus Christ was on the earth 2,000 years ago history can prove that I believe is this I believe that history can prove that right but it's to believe that he is amen and that's why that Jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right that's why the manifestation see we want to we we dwelt so much upon that that there's not three Gods there's three manifestations of the same God right all right there's not three works of Grace there's three stages our manifestation all right in this day in time see we're not back in the Lutheran the Wesley God you know honored those things in but we're in a time now that the New Birth has come to the basis of being justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost giving us the new birth and that's the same situation that uh Nicodemus was asking about in Jesus was explaining it you know he goes on to explain of it he just born of water and and all the blood and things like that and explaining it to him all right so I hope you follow that point then we got to the point of talking about that many are called but a few are chosen right all right now I was looking some quotes today on that and brother R said the chosen goes back to election all right so we could go into that but we're not trying to do that we're trying to just cover it over a a a simple scale to look at it and see you'd say well how do I know God is dealing with me well why are you listening I mean why are you here why are you on the internet system why are you listening you know why are you paying attention or why you you concerned come on if you wouldn't you know if you just think about it to be concerned right the Bible said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness why cuz they shall be filled it's a great honor to Prophet said to just thirst to just have a longing in your heart for God and I went through it to explain even to the people of the the countries where they've never even heard of the name of Jesus that's right but yet they see they have something because of a soul that's within them of being a mortal being that that soul is longing for the Creator you know and all and they they have that calling in their life so you say well I I just don't really know where God's calling me or not because we know that nobody can come Jesus said to the father except by me you can't just jump up and say I'm going to go get saved right it's not that way it's him dealing with you amen cuz salvation's of the Lord amen salvation is not you making a decision come on right right now you got to make a decision that's fine right but you got to make a decision about the salvation all right so then you see why it's so valuable to understand the truth because a lot of churches they've got a set of rules you go by and they tell you you're Sav they got a set of something that you do certain scriptures you learn certain uh ways you learn to quote them and say them and memorize a bunch and and and you know and you're saved right but now that's not our understanding of Salvation right our understanding is that God is the author of it all right and that he's trying to make it manifest is to us right all right so now don't worry I wrote back a note world to remember see in this day you got a lot of people in the message if you was a seed you could be saved if you wouldn't one you couldn't be saved and all it's doing is putting doubt in people's mind even if it was true you know I I don't agree with the the seed doctrinal ideas like that I I believe what brother R said about the se but even if it was true why would you want to um somebody come up to want to be saved you say no you can't be save CU you in seed now what kind of a don't tell me that's Christianity come on don't talk to me about that being God that's as heeren as any Heathen could be they wouldn't do that with you they'd let you convert to their ideas yep but you see that's the way the people of the message then they they put people to the point that they don't even see seek God anymore right and like I told you before about it I heard of a couple said they'd like to have another baby but they didn't know whether that baby they have would be a seat of God or no no M well I mean especially if you both of you Christians why wouldn't you think about being deceived are you talking about going out and doing something wrong to get it you know yeah why wouldn't you want to believe it if if I was going to adop a child I would still believe that child that by by me adopting it and and praying for it that God could honor that and save the child wouldn't you why is it that people are this to the point you know that they they really they've they've torn up the gospel instead of trying to preach it right you know and and just it bothers me but now see if we don't accept the truth all right then we say I don't believe we have an excuse when we get there about the truth that's right I mean I've tried now and other ministers here with me we've tried to preach to you the truth and give you an opportunity to be able to be saved and do it correctly and and not go off onto the the Tantrum of all of the message people and and and I'm not against people for doing that no more and I'm against the BST message this Presbyterian what just leave them alone you know let them go and leave them alone now telling you what what I believe and why I don't believe some of the doctrines is my responsibility that's right true but now just just get with it and let's move on then so you see what I'm talking about that we believe in Salvation in three stages all right now and we'll show this through the prophet's message that at justification all that is is Ching off your past sins right he said it's like picking up a GL out in the yard he said you got a reason for it you picked it up he said but it's still dirty he said then you sanctify it or wash it cleanse it and he said then that still doesn't mean that that vessel is in in use CU it it it it needs the fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost to finish all up amen but justification by faith now that's the the thing I want you to get tonight is one thing all right if you don't get nothing else out of the message I don't you to get one thing and we'll read it when we get on over a little further the prophet of God said everything you get from God you get by faith well my brother they see hearing the message people well you can't have faith without the Holy Ghost now show me where the Prophet said you couldn't right right that's right faith is a reation right and you can get a revelation of healing and you are LW inner you agree see then we put it all and I told you there the other day faith has to be understood the way only way I look at it is is Faith is actually a mental believing and you just keep mentally believing it and God moves that mental believing into a position to where that he can Quicken it make it alive but it's still up on my confession that's now if you don't get anything out of the message you get this point we've got to accept by faith right right and then we've got to ex confess according to Romans what is it Romans 10 you believe in your heart confess with your mouth you get a high salvation believe it in your heart you said well I'm not going to go out and tell the world that I'm saved but then you're lost right amen because you've cut off your salvation that's right well I believe in my heart but that ain't all the word said it said confess with the mou all right so then if we believe it that way why don't we stand upon it and accept it on that basis right that what we get we receive by faith God drops down low enough I guess is a way to say it or how would you say it he comes down into our realm of life and living and doings to talk to us and communicate with us the goodness of God the scripture said lead us to repentance see then you must accept God now here as we'll get to this at the last but I've got the quotes on we must accept God as our savior see now here's the the brainy people in the message Christ Min of God revealed it's not you accepting him it's him accepting you well now you explain that to me when you must first accept him that's right right that's right if you don't accept him he can't override your free moral Ag and save you okay amen that blown enough right see I'm trying to make it plain and simple we must accept him as our savior all right we must repent of our sins all right then he accepts Us by giving us the baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's right that's when he accepts you amen is when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz then that way you can't be lost you get to baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't be lost all right but if you're just to going through justification and going through sanctification in those stages you have the ability at that position to lose what you started off with right am but once you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't lose that all right see that's why it's in stages now don't worry about what Luther and westling him was we can take ours to express cuz that was the New Birth like there amen but down here it's required that we have justification from isusa Street coming on down it's required that we have justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have the new birth amen now in doing that see then we must first confess him he begins to deal with us and talk to us a little to call us we come under what we call conv ition you know words we realize we're lost right right he now the prophet of God said all the preacher could do was break the spell that Satan has over your eyes where that God can speak straight to you amen all right that's why you see him stumbling around a lot of times trying to find a way because somebody's pulling something and and we're not prophets to be able to understand what that works on so we have to just play around sometimes we find it and and don't let the Lord do it amen but now get to this will be the main thought that we must accept him as our savior and we must believe that he is dealing with us talking to us speaking to us right why would you be concerned as I said want to go if he wasn't doing it see then we must accept the fact that he's doing that then we must start confessing like I said you mean you would go out and and God would forgive your sins and and then you turn around say I'm not I I I'm I'm like the lady said I believe I'm a Christian but said I believe I got the Holy Ghost the other night said but don't don't tell nobody now well now I doubt your salvation when you because even at repentance it's a it's God working a work in your life to cleanse us of sin why wouldn't we want to tell that God has forgiven us am you know why why wouldn't we want to to speak about those things see maybe it's because he hasn't done it because we haven't approached it correctly all right see we must approach him correctly we must bring it to the basis of where we can take his word and lay it before him right don't get don't you think God would get mad at you for him for you reminding him of what he said now wouldn't that be something I mean you parents where you get mad at your kids cuz they remind you of something you said there something wrong with you right you ought not have said it maybe but might have to tell them ought not to said it but still you said it and you'll try to keep your word right well how much more is our savior the prophet of God said if you find any promise of God in the Bible he said you can bring it before God and this is his words he said if he won't fulfill it then he lied now that's strong that's right but that's how much he believed in the word amen yeah see we find in the word maybe maybe it's not you reading the Bible don't misunderstand me because some people say well I wasn't reading the Bible when I got saved no but you heard somebody or something caused you to get to that position maybe you uh you maybe you heard other people read it maybe you uh you know went to church maybe you uh just love grandma grandma M was a good person and Grandma pray for you you know just like that but that would be all it would take to bring you to a knowledge it's not we'll read in a minute it's not how much of the word you know right it's not that's how much is revealed lot of difference in knowing things and revealing I wish to God I had revealed in my heart what is running around in my head of this message after 40 years of reading it we ought to have a little bit you know but think about it now you must accept him as your savior and you must confess because he is our high priest the scripture says that's making intercession Upon Our confession or profession is the word that's there but it's the same word confession and profession so then he can't do anything until I do it I'll read your quote in a minute we get time to where brother Brown said if you're confessing you're a Christian you are he said you quit confessing you're Christian you're not one you know that's a hard thing a it right but just remember and I'm going to make a bold statement then may hear from this on the internet system or some of you but I'm going to make it anyway see that person that can is you know quits confessing their salvation is not a truly Born Again believer to me now right that's a justification sanctification person that's that's in the stages of Salvation because when you come to that baptism of the Holy Ghost he's going to confess right from the inside of you are let me quote brother randam when he said the man went out and got his beard and sat down and said he wasn't going to preach no more he said in a couple of weeks later he's dead right he said God won't let you Mar his name right there you go see so put it in a category we will get to it eventually one of these days to word that we can speak on it but brother R said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body right or if you'll listen to what I'm talking about you'll see that exactly you'll see that he's calling the born again experience in that situation the justification of where you're repenting of your sins and that's why he said surely if you die in that condition you will go to heaven but he says that's not the Born Again experience this day you know that's not the new birth for this day all right so then follow those things and you won't get confused when you hear him make statements that sounds odd you know just study it a little while if you'll think about it it' be the only way he could say it how else could he say that you're that he could prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body how else could he say it there is no other way of saying it because he's tying together everybody right from a justification St of repentance accepting Jesus Christ repent of your sins he cus it to thief on the cross now the thief on the cross didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right come on because the Holy Ghost not been given yet because the man with an in was hanging there right he went to heaven on the basis of his confession right not the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he didn't receive it right all right but you see then that's where we need to understand that we need to just simply get down and believe God Amen right that's right but see we got so super duper revelated until we're not in that realm anymore you know oh that's just the old days teaching show me work the old days right let's read what we around saids about it see whether it's old days or new days and let's see what he had to say about it go ahead brother let's just read what he had to say about it from Christ the Myster of God revealed you don't ask you he while back to to uh read that message you know it' be good to study it but look what he says you see people as I said they say brother brandom Le the new birth this way and then he change it this way well now here he is in 1964 802 1964 preaching the future home and we're going to read two places where he said that he taught three processes from the beginning that's right all right see then he preached the world in three process he preached the the Regeneration of the world in three proc the Regeneration of man in three processes right but see what it is people don't have I'm just honest now you forgive me why would anybody say that that it it's not the new birth this way when brother R would say it was why don't you hear him say look this what I got to saying right that brother R says if your sins are remitted at justification and you die right there that's the thief on the cross experience and you're going to heaven that's right but then need turn around and say you must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in the Kingdom no problem not with me anyway amen because I can see and I know what happened to me back there and I told you about it I saw God when I was about 11 years old I saw that that didn't save me right no but one day I come to the bases I had to get over and I explained it Sunday there to you I had to get over the church to be able to get to God to be able to get saved because they was telling me how to be saved when their salvation wasn't what I wanted right cuz I wanted something that would save me instead of me going on and living like the devil like everybody that there was doing you know and I don't mean everybody there were good people there and you know that but you know what I'm talking about look what your Prophet had to say about it now 1964 and 802 paragraph 77 to 78 on this and notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption they talk about the world now but then he's explaining the new birth to you and I because he said it's the same thing same for each one all right just thrilled my soul when I saw how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done it to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's led the world in three stages you know what he went through you've been through the future home the world was justified by the washing of the water and the Noah and Sanctified when Jesus dropped his blood upon it and one day it will receive a fiery baptism to cleanse it and everything but but it was claimed it was claimed back there when when he stepped upon this Earth all right just like he led the world in three stages to come to the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through through three stages of Grace I taught that at the beginning I've never changed since it's God's word right see then why would man come along go ahead with the next come along and try to tell us that brother around change this and change that well I want to know where changed it right you know I mean I just like to know where he changed today well you just can't you're just not spiritual enough I agree with you I'm just not spiritual enough to receive false Doctrine I'm sorry maybe if that's what you call it forgive me look what he goes over paragraph 86 out the future home notice how God makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a great confirmation of good a great loving blessing from God when I see this and see that sense a boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've always taught those three stages of Grace notice if it it isn't true now now the first step is what repentance toward God all right and then follows after that is water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism followers showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our P sins that has nothing to do with future sin watch you it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what far remission taking away of P sins has nothing to do with the future just your sins have been chopped off what you did now I love this one you can't repent for what Adam done everybody blames Adam they blame Eve they blame the devil right well what's he say you can't repent for what Adam done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness of what you done the old nature is still there so now on justification what's he talking about that old nature of mankind is still living in us at justification when you repent of your sins see how where you would go wrong if you took it totally that the fact that you just repented I accepted a you know Baptist Doctrine not throwing off on them but that's just their Doctrine or the issue of saying well you know I believe what do you believe what do you mean what I believe I I believe Jesus Christ died for my sins well the history book says he did right right come on the history book says he died they said he was crucified right is that the point that it's talking about is that what we need to be saved is it just to believe that he was and what he done no it's to believe that he is what he's doing now amen the prophet just showed us right there he said don't you ain't no need of us repenting for what Adam done he said we never done it well if it had been for Adam and Eve we wouldn't be in this ja like my brother my brother's Methodist preacher he told me one time he said God made me a sinner how can he condemn me for sinning well you know he's right if God made him out way come on if God made him that way he's right if God made him a sinner he can't condemn for being a sinner so I simply told him no no he didn't make you that way you made yourself one right I said because that that wouldn't be God he can't create evil and do those things that's right but you see what he said now see justification just chops off your P sins right it does nothing to your nature it does nothing to your future point we're not Catholicism to believe in being able to pay before we do you know but are you following me the old nature is still there right all you done is just repented right all you done just got rid of a load of sin amen all but you know we repent for being a sinner now come on listen to what I'm saying saying all right we shouldn't repent for for what we now listen what I'm saying please you accept Jesus Christ as your savior you repent for what you done right right all right come on now you repent for what You' done you believe God forgive you right what are you doing now still repenting for what you done that song you know I don't p Doctrine on the song but it's says what sins are you talking about see we're repenting for what we used to be well that would be repent for what Adam done right get what I'm talking about I I don't like the life that I liveed no and I'm definitely sorry for the life that I lived as a sinner amen right but I asked him to forgive me and I believe he did the reason I believe he did is because he gave me the baptism of the Holy Ghost all so then if you ever want to know whether you whether you've been fully you know your repentance was genuine and God accepted it just get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know watch you can't get it until you do that's why they they went it was there there was only 120 received the baptism of the Holy Ghost why didn't the world get it when Jesus died and the Holy Ghost fell why didn't he fall on everybody go everybody wasn't repentant everybody wasn't cleaned out they wasn't capable of receiving right right you following me so the prophet said it has nothing to do then with your future you just repented for what You' done right right but no repentance for what you're going to do repentance is of what you do right right but it's all based on whether or not you can believe it if you can't believe it then it's not for you remember the man told Brother Brown said I wouldn't believe in Divine Heen no matter what you done he said it's not for you that's right man it's not farting you can't believe it right now you might wonder sometimes why I preach serieses and then keep on going sometime you might order time together and listen CU if you remember when we were back there a few weeks month or two 6 months ago I gu all right when we were talking about the atonement all right you know you know I put a lot of emphasis on the atonement okay you know those people that brought those animals up in that Old Testament and laid them down and put their hands on them the prophet of God said that he they believed when the blood was sprinkling out and splattering all over them as they cut his throat and done the thing that that animal was dying in their place now do you believe Jesus Jesus Christ died in your place no Roman killed my savior no Jew killed my savior my sins is what killed him and if I was the only person in the world he would have still died for me right right are you listening see my sins is what put him on Calvary amen that Roman he didn't kill him he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it said I can call 12 Legions of angels and one destroyed the world with Waters wormwood and he could call 12 Legions 12,000 Angels but he died in my place amen why wouldn't you want to repent of your sins right I mean let all Christianity aside that's hard statement I'm sorry I just carnal way of talking but forgive me just listen let all facts aside that even we would talk about going to heaven or whatever but to think that history can prove Jesus Christ died and he said he was dying for me he's taking my place wouldn't that be something see are we afraid of hell is that the reason we want to be saved come on that's the way people preach it you don't get saved you're going to die in hell and burn eternally come on how many of you come out of denominational churches there's not a one of them that don't teach eternal hell and there's a lot in this message close enough to it but see threatening people to try to get them to be saved scaring them scaring the little kids don't do that right come on I know I'm meddling okay you ain't got enough guts to whip your own child with your with to correct it and then you turn around and place it on that Jesus don't love you cuz you're doing wrong and you're making the kid have a complex towards Jesus you ain't got enough guts to whip it yourself so you're pacifying your own do by putting it off on saying Jesus is mad at you sorry that's just the way I believe listen folks don't try to scare nobody into salvation right you just presented yes but Brother D I can show you where brother brand yes he was a prophet I can tell you where he was a saying he kept on give an order call and he said come on down come on down Jesus is waiting here at the altar for you that's not a scar tactic that's truth that's where he was that night when I saw him standing on the right hand side of the altar see that's not a fear that way to tell him Jesus is waiting on you he said we're going to put a cross up here where when people come down and Bow Down maybe it'll help get their mind on you're Prophet talking like that yeah right cuz he truly was a prophet was he right but are you following me amen you don't have anything to do with the future justification repentance just chops that off amen right Naturally by chopping off your sins you want to go to church right see when I repented my first thoughts was if I'm going to believe in God which I knew about knew God was real but if I'm going to believe the way that people I need to read the Bible so I set out to read it and I I set out to read the Bible not to get a gold star I didn't care about that my point was I wanted to to know about him amen amen you know he was good to me and he he allowed me to to be able to read his word what about that and I read about all of his goodness and the things but I read about the things the way he was how straight he was and when this Prophet began to talk about it I didn't have any trouble believing it when he began to tell how that God that those Jews were so you know so tied up in their own religion they wouldn't have D wrote that they Abraham lied and all of that he said but God made him do it brother Brandon began to talk about how that in his own life that he even wanted to smoke he wanted to drink he wanted to do those things and God wouldn't let him those things touch me when I heard a man talk about a God that I knew had to be real somewhere right amen amen but if you ever to that contact that that point of even thinking about God being real that's why it says he that believe that he that come to God must believe that God is words he is he's he's real right see then accept him as your savior yes but Brother D I claimed salvation 40 years ago I I've been in this message 50 years that don't have nothing to do with it right I CLA salvation from the time I was 18 years old in the Baptist Church and at 23 years old I was an ordained Deacon teaching adult Sunday School classes and the things that's what they thought of me but you see when I come in this message and I saw God the way the prophet was talking about it and salvation the way he was talking about it I realized what i' done I had repented of my sins I had asked God to forgive me and I had set out and got baptized course it was wrong but still you know as quick as I could I got it done right but I had it father son Holy Ghost like most everybody else sitting here and had you know but I done that and I went to church it was never a concern whether or not we went to church from the day my wife and I married it was never a concern where we was going to church or not that's right that didn't make any difference we were there I didn't have to come in this message and learn how to pay tith on I done it when in the Baptist Church and making anywhere from $42 to about finally went to a job making about $90 you know thought I was rich and went to gent Motors making about 120 man things going good but you see something was dealing with me and when I seen what this Prophet was talking about the new birth I knew not real quick I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he was talking about I had a great understanding of the Bible I studied it I didn't read everything else I read the Bible I studied it I could look up scriptures and talk about the kingdom I remember striking me one day when I was reading it about when when they said something and Jesus said Thou Art the way you know they said to him said Thou Art the way the truth and the lie and I thought what does that word way mean you know I got the best I could do with a Concordance and they begin to look up the way you know and I found out there's a lot about that in the Bible I I probably one of these days I get around I'll preach on him but you know there was a lot behind that little word way right but you see it's because I wanted to know about God I told you I'll just talk to you some I wanted to know about God right I wanted to know about him as a as a God not to to just know that he was God or existed somewhere in a in a realm way up above you know and how we all were and talk that God you remember the little boy wanted to know if you could see God and went to his mama and his Sunday school teacher and his pastor and none of them couldn't tell him about seeing God the old fisherman finally told him said all I've seen all my life has been God you know the old man had had an experience right and see I believe I walked in a Sanctified State because I remember that when when the things that I used to do would go away from me and you know but when I saw this prophet and heard him talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and knew right then I needed that well what do you mean you believe the message you believed he was a prophet yes sir I've told you before under a Justified or somewhere stay in there I read the Bible when I come to Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I told my wife they would be two prophets come before the end of the world that's how I believe the word when brother Mo began to talk to me about it he said I said where do you get this at about a prophet he said Malachi 4 I said okay explain Malachi 3 I hit a man that was gracious enough could explain it am he explained John the Baptist and showed me Luke 11:17 all of the things you know the scripture well how could I argue with a man about what he was to say and when I had talked many years before about that to see it in the word it looked like two prophets would come you see I believed God's word I still believe it I believe it's God speaking to us all right but if you ever been condemned or did you just go to church somewhere or was you raised in the message right that's where my kids my grandkids raised in this message cutting their teeth on the pews here that don't save them amen they got to have their own experience with God not just because Daddy's the pastor right right you see and that that way that's why I stand the way I do but repentance is just simply we saying I'm sorry and I'll turn around but now if it has nothing to do with your future and it doesn't drive the unclean Spirit out of your justification tur it around is one good thing that's right you turned around started in another Direction but about 2 weeks later you going to turn back around right you may be going to church church but you're going to turn back around the other way cuz the devil the prophet said you ever say you're a Christian he said the devil turns every gun he's got on you right he's going to try you to make sure right right you see then he that endureth to the end the Bible says shall be saved he that goes on but see in this day and age now get what I'm saying before we can move on in this day and age to to repent of your sins is not the new birth right but now you see you take people in the message then they're hunting for something they're searching like in the old days when we didn't have the computers to run up things I never have looked it up since then either but they used to condemn me and brother Mo call we had a flat top haircut and they told us that that was wrong another devil you know flat top haircut brother Mo said Brother D you've been looking for thing I said no ain't concerned about it I said because I don't think a flat top hardcut is going to keep you out you know I'm just going to go on wearing my flat top well it wouldn't long now till I've got a good one it just keeps going backwards you know and it's getting flatter cuz getting less of it but I'm not throwing off on somebody that believes that but why would you want to believe that to be your salvation I got to Hur okay let me get off go pull up the last part of that from brother Joe brother R in the future home that's why I'm ask you the last part of number two which is paragraph 90 that's why I've asked you to go to the Future home and study it just study it over and over over and over cuz he said in there he said if I don't get the Plan of Salvation you he said if I don't get nothing but the Plan of Salvation let me get that him preaching the change of a world and a world to go to and a place you know and know but look what he said now when you are asked are you're forgiven of your sins you've only done this now you remember what he's done up there he's draw two hearts one of them's got a snake in it the other one's got a dove in it now I believe that that was the same heart you can believe what you want to about it CU why would you want to take the snake out and leave the dove in the other one when you don't deal with that one that you took the snake out of right you know he didn't put a dove over in the one you take the snake out of come on so didn't want to do it cuz that's what he's explaining see he said one of got the dove in which is the Holy Spirit and he's got a life the other one has malice hatred he's got a life too all right so what's he saying now when you're asked and you're forgiven of your sins you've only done this now he draw lines in I representing sin and he just erased them lines that was representing sin H he taken that away but the thing that made you do it is still there Snake unclean Spirit that's the old root of evil that's still there notice when you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins all the snake is still in there the thing that caused you to do it is still there and then you better keep repenting at that stage right see at that stage you better repent every day and Paul even got up to where he was at in his life and he said I Die daily that's a man after the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sitting in a pretty good place but are you following me amen look at what he's saying let's get a few now to get them out of the way and then we'll you know carry on maybe Sunday on the sanctification but look what he says on the manifestation of the spirit 19501 717 or E21 now how do you get saved let's take it in a childlike form where every believer no matter if you're what church you belong to and your pastor if he's a right man he will tell you that that you can only be Sav through faith now if a man really right that's what he'll tell you all right not through Works through faith now you believe that he saved you now the first thing that comes from the heart you believe it then you walk up and confess it say I accept Jesus as my personal savior I believe he saved me there's not a physical thing in the world that you could prove what there's not a physical thing in the world to prove that you're saved now why does everybody want signs and wonders and things or or speaking in tongues or or whatever to be in evidence of the Holy Ghost look what he's saying there's not a physical thing in the world that you could prove that you're saved your eyes are the same color got the same shirt on you had on go out outside and the old guy say there ain't nothing to that but you believe that there's something to it don't you all right you believe it you believe that you're saved you act like you're saved you say you're saved and you associate with those that are saved and it works salvation watch it is that right and the same thing will take place by Divine Healing you believe you're healed you act like he healed you you say you're healed and he's the high priest of your confession to make good anything that you confess that he's done before before the father and there it is right amen so now you believe it you believe you're saved you act like you're saved right I'm talking just just repentance now we're not talking about the New Birth we're not talking about the the baptism and all of the different things we're talking about just repenting of your sins right you repent of your sins you're going back to the bar go back in and get drunk again well it didn't bother me bless God I got saved last night now we don't believe in junk amen right God don't go to the bars right amen right you don't do with those things salvation you repented at least you can quit to the best you can right and I'm honest in saying that because I realized I was a human I realized my life and I lived you need help amen that's right you talk about Alcoholics Anonymous helping you I believe they do but you need to hang around people that's got the Holy Ghost amen that's right quit associating with the world and the things quit running out there with them right yeah and get together with somebody that's got something right amen why because at least you can act like it look at the next one as I was with Moses paragraph 228 19691 in the morning remember you can only be saved by your personal faith now listen to you you can only be healed by your personal faith you believe this to be the Bible God's word you believe your pastor to be a man of God whatever Church you go to if you don't you should leave it I like that and I'm the guy that's the pastor I like that if you don't think this right what we do here and what we're doing you need to go somewhere else find you a place to where that you can agree with what's going on I don't mind that if you don't you should leave it get to a man that is a man of God and if you believe him believe he's telling you the truth then accept it your own personal faith in Christ savor you no matter how good your pastor is how Godly saintly your mother is how how real the word of God is now listen to it how much you cry how much you pray it's your faith that saves You by faith are you saved right it's your faith that saves you now did Brother brandham not agree with crying and praying and all the things no he's just simply telling it like it is right the truth of it all right you can do every bit of that and not be saved look at the next one which is as I was with Moses that's paragraph 228 this is paragraph 212 by faith you're saved how many knows that do many how many many good men praise over you how many good preachers preaches to you you got to have your own personal faith for salvation is that right it's your own I don't care how many good sermons you hear listen to it how many good churches you belong to it's your own personal faith that saves you how loud you cry how much you beg how much you scream how much you dance in the spirit you're only saved by faith is that right that's the only way you're healed it comes the same way right right all right now let's get this point here look at Thy word Lord preach 1954 221 e32 now he cannot heal you or cannot save you or do one thing for you until first you accept it and believe it and confess it right accept it believe it confess it that's right you got to confess it not you got to feel it you got to confess it he's not the high priest of your feelings now I'm glad we got the the ability to pull these things in and read them off you know people say oh I don't know where brother random said that or not well there it is he's not the high priest of your feel he said high priest of your confession that's right what you confess then you go on down through down you never live above your confession that the sliest every how you pronounce that word person in this building right now just make it up in your mind that you're not a Christian anymore that's when you become not a Christian see don't you're confession when you go out and say are you a Christian no I used to be but I I'm not no more you've fallen from Grace right then right that's what I said now you take that you're going to die but listen to what the simple point I might want to go you could be Saint l or whatever but you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fall From Grace right right God's not an Indian giver he doesn't give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you fall from grace can't be done all right brother Mo had a good point the way he made his point listen he said you can't sin enough to be lost if you're born again well natur you ain't going to sin anyway cuz God's going to take you off the sin whatever that's right but you see that way get with somebody the prophet says that knows what you're talking about somebody that's been through experiences can tell you how to go through other experiences right right am MH that's all I do is just tell you what I go through right you know what I've been through in my life I'm just trying my best to tell you what God revealed to me when I preached to you the seals the the Daniel 70 weeks the the the the serieses the things over all these 40 something years I'm just trying to tell you what he's dealing with me about cuz that's all I can talk about so you ask people to put in their own words what brother Brown would say about the new birth and they just most of them would die they wouldn't be able to express it they only can give you quotes you know how I love them I love to read what he says but if you'll notice I said this before I said read these quotes you're saved by Faith by through you're saved by grace through faith amen amen your confession is what God God is acting upon right right you say you're saved then you're saved right you say you're healed you're healed all right let's going down right let's see we Jehovah 195 5817 paragraph E18 it is only the love of our father that loves us so much that he sends his word he sends his ministers to preach the word then he sends gifts in the church into the church with his arms spread out trying to get you to believe it he wants to heal you tonight a thousand times more than you want to be healed but do we believe that and God wants to heal us a th times more than we want to be healed right what's wrong maybe our confession is not what he says he says we're healed we say maybe we are he says he that believeth that God is we say yeah history says he was you see when it bring out about lay that down into your heart sometime think about it a lot of our confessions is only confessing what brother brandham said right that's good but I I didn't think that was what the scripture said I thought the scripture was saying what we confess what we believe right I thought it was saying that no man can all Jesus the Christ except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right but look what he goes on to say but you're afraid you you go by how you feel because you you regarded that you live by your feelings that's your whole life has been wrapped in that but you must get away from that and act on God's word not what you feel or what you see what God said and act on that making confession of that confess means to say the same thing he's at the right hand of the father with his own blood to make intercession on your confession he cannot do anything for you until first you've accepted it and confess it and then he can act on it he's the high priest of what you confess that he is to you he's a high priest of what you confess that he is to you it's not what he is to everybody else right it's what he is to you you see what I mean but now listen as I said a minute ago we read about three quotes here and I know you'd know that there'd be plenty more if we wanted to look them up that we must confess and it won't do us any good until we do that's right we've got to confess it right we got to say that we're saved right we got to say that we're healed amen we got to say that our sins are gone we've got to confess what he said where he can come on the scene and take care of it but you see we've got so revelated into the message now to where then people are say don't know what you're talking about God it's not whether or not I accept him whether or not he accepts me that's Christ mess God reveal if you want to read it be glad to no excuse me future home get it over and get it right 64 go to number 10 Brother Anderson Heaven and Earth have met God and man is reconciled restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you because it's God's attribute and that would sound like that would be destroying all these other quotes that we made that he must make you must accept him but just remember if he is the high priest of our confession yeah then we must confess him first before he can do anything for us that's right agree so then we must must accept him then he can accept us so now are you following it just read it off there and look at it if my accepting is not correct he he will never accept me right right are you reading off the screen while I'm talking if my acceptance is not correct he cannot make intercession upon that right that would mean he would save me whether I wanted to be saved or not right that's not true well brother D I just don't I I believe in a in a Salvation I I I you know the brother so and so preach go with brother so and so that's all right I I just can't follow it that way I must follow it in a line to be able to fit the scriptures and all the prophet has said see you must accept him as your personal savior all right but if my accepting is not right it don't matter about what I accept right right cuz he ain't going to accept me that's right but if I confess which means to say the same thing he said then he's accepting my confession and he's accepting me so there's nothing wrong with what the prophet had to say it's exactly right amen right it's not whether you confess him or not it's whether he confesses you sure why because salvation not whether you accept him it's whether he accepts you right because we just got to going through I hope you follow me a justification you're not born again right you're only confessing unto salvation right if you die in that place yes you're going to heaven but that don't mean you're the bride it don't mean you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is proof your sins are gone we got to go we've got to go through the stage of sanctification talking about it the unclean Spirit going out in the things so read the future home there what the prophet is talking about you see talking about this world and what it's got to go through but it's already been cleansed and climed by the Lord Jesus dropping his blood upon it it's just waiting on a fiery baptism you know these bodies that we live in they've done been cleansed they've done been cleaned right justification and sanctification sanctification lays a claim on that body that you're living in because the unclean Spirit goes out and he lays a claim it's just like you people you got to deed to your property worth enough to burn that's all it's worth that's right there is no such thing as an abstract title deed to a land in America it would be the Indian that had it that's right you said but I had it searched back I don't care that's right they only search 100 years normal inexpensive one search 20 years to see if anybody got claims on it I told you about the home there we used to have in Gils we got the house hold up we had it dried in had it was fixing when was working on the outside I went and put in for a loan I had enough money to get up to that point went put in for a loan they said you don't own the property I said I've got the deed he said but this done so we going had to go check it out come find out I didn't have a clear Deed from the man he had bought the property thinking it was a clear deed but a man put it up out there in the store the original deed was put up against the debt that he owed it just happened that that man was a friend of ours was matter of fact fact was in the same church and uh he said I remember when that man paid it off but said we just didn't mark it off the Record he marked it off and he gave me a deed that's all it takes you think you got a deed okay the only thing we got an abstract tit of deed is the eternal life that's the only deed I'm concerned about anyway whether I got a home or what I've got I ain't concerned about that is whether or not I got a home in glory but he follow me just repentance just cleans away don't do anything to the Future don't even drive out the unclean Spirit it just washes away your sinsen right amen then your repentance baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says for the remission of sins but now what the water baptism does not remit your sins right right it's an act of a good conscience of an outward thing water baptism does not and I'll show you where brother said it does remit your sins but then you take the rest of what he said the baptism don't remit your sins it's an outward work of and it's work in a conscious part of you on the inside that goes and has it done that's still where the the repentance is at see because water doesn't repent a lot of people went down with come I me dry to come up wet and that's all they done that's right that's what I told that Church of Christ man that time I said you believe water baptism under regeneration you mean a man just gets baptized he regenerate I said I'll meet you on Lake ler Sunday we'll fill the kingdom you think that's been a joke and not been a joke and I'm in it we'll just go down through there and everybody we F don't matter they got bikinis on what they got on or nothing on what we just shove them in the water we baptize them he just looked at me I went on and told him I said first off you don't need baptized correctly course he didn't like that either said I said you're a Church of Christ W baptize in his name but listen Church your baptism is just an outward show that something has happened to you it doesn't save you it's just sh into the world what you believe right and then you walk on see it is on the form of remittance because John's baptism if you think I don't know what I'm talking about John never baptized under repentance right John the Baptist never baptized under repentance that's right he he only baptized to the name to carry it on but in the book of Acts they baptize under repentance why because it would deal more with the coming forth into the body Body of Christ does everybody understand that in the book of Acts it was coming into repentance was going towards the body of Christ to where that you could enter their in there was no concern up in the Old Testament that's why the the John never baptized under repentance he just baptized because really in a baptismal form back there baptism was a the fact that most Believers that would be just like say I would take all of you out and baptize you because you were Believers going to this church that's what they where the Baptist Point come from right and that's why John was baptized in his convert some time see to to believe on something to come but then in the book of Acts it was to believe on something that already come I hope you understand what I'm saying let's say repentance you simply say Lord I'm sorry forgive me you've been so good to me yes and wouldn't that be something for all of us old plow boy falling behind a me when I was 7 years old my patches had patches on top of the patches I life when brother around was talking about the little boy running out there pulling that nail and just keep running out in the water cuz he didn't have nothing else on he running out into the water just pulled a nail and prance just fell off of him well that's our only way to get to hold him up old buttons should break off especially as they handed down from my three brothers above me you know but look at it what he's give us but most of all to give us eternal life oh bring us into this message to show us the truth that order to be the thing that would keep all of us and there you know on hold is to see the truth what we got 612 the spiral book 612 anybody have a need but just read
