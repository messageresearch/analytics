[0:17] [Music]
[0:20] teacher didn't be in the world hurt but
[0:35] we don't look in the first Corinthians

[0:41] several scriptures

[0:57] [Music]
[1:01] first rate this chapter to targeter
[1:09] still reading this morning
[1:25] and he was talking about that really the
[2:14] Queen says the sermon in the waiting
[2:17] trig lasts more than seven minutes and
[2:19] he went 13 but he was good hiding with
[2:26] people there were people from the United
[2:28] States that we're posting online said
[2:29] we've heard prayers lasted longer than
[2:37] when you go to church you don't know how
[2:41] long Turks are gonna be bearing those
[2:42] time limits no there's not they have one
[2:46] sterling service they have a preacher
[2:47] then they have a second song service the
[2:52] black family is in the little church
[2:54] group that was singing for them it was
[2:58] beautiful not stiff and starchy and I
[3:04] just looked at the flags all down
[3:06] through there and her and her gowns and
[3:09] her long training book
[3:11] oh god brother Branham talked about
[3:13] those the bride and coming in they're
[3:16] different oh I'm sorry
[4:07] get back second Corinthians chapter 2
[4:10] verse 1 and it says and I brethren when
[4:15] I came to you came not with excellency
[4:18] of speech or of wisdom declaring unto
[4:21] you the testimony of God but determine
[4:25] not to know anything among you seek
[4:27] Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was
[4:30] with you in weakness and in fear and in
[4:32] much trembling and my speech and my
[4:36] preaching was not with enticing words of
[4:38] man's wisdom but in demonstration of the
[4:41] Spirit and of power that your faith
[4:44] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[4:46] but in the power of God howbeit we speak
[4:49] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[4:52] enough the wisdom of this world nor of
[4:56] the princes of this world that come to
[4:58] nought but we speak the wisdom of God in
[5:03] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[5:06] God ordained
[5:07] before the world unto our glory which
[5:11] none of the princes of this world knew
[5:13] before had they known it they would not
[5:15] have crucified the Lord of glory but it
[5:18] but as it is written I have not seen nor
[5:21] ear heard nor neither have entered into
[5:24] the heart of man the things which God
[5:25] hath prepared for them that love him but
[5:29] God hath revealed them unto us by spirit
[5:32] for the spirit searches all things yea
[5:35] the deep things of God for what man
[5:37] knoweth the things of a man save the
[5:40] spirit of men which is in him even so
[5:44] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[5:47] Spirit of God now we have received not
[5:50] the spirit of the world but the Spirit
[5:52] which is of God that we might know the
[5:54] things that are freely given unto us of
[5:57] God which things we also speak not in
[6:01] the words which man's wisdom teaches but
[6:05] which the Holy Spirit teaches comparing
[6:07] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[6:09] natural man receiveth not the things of
[6:11] the Spirit of God for they are
[6:13] foolishness unto Him neither and he know
[6:16] them because they are spiritually
[6:17] discerned but he that is spiritual
[6:21] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[6:24] judged of no men for who can who have
[6:28] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[6:30] instruct him but we have the month of
[6:33] Christ alone long scripture reading this
[6:39] morning that the time good one of
[6:43] thoughts don't pick up this morning Paul
[6:46] says here in verse 12 he says now we
[6:49] have received not the spirit of the
[6:51] world but the Spirit which is of God
[6:54] that we might know the things that are
[6:56] freely given to us of God and you know
[7:00] well it's all coming it was speaking to
[7:03] the Corinthians you know he said I
[7:04] didn't come to speak to you with
[7:07] excellency of speech or wisdom you know
[7:11] Paul didn't want the people you know
[7:13] even though that Paul was a scholar was
[7:17] well
[7:18] Haidee want people to look at him as
[7:20] being a scholar he wanted them to see
[7:23] Jesus Christ he said I don't I don't
[7:26] know anything else but Jesus Christ and
[7:28] him crucified in Ohio in his
[7:30] resurrection that's the only thing I
[7:31] want you to see because you know a lot
[7:33] of people you know he could have come
[7:35] and spoke a lot of things that were
[7:38] enticing to people's ears and you know
[7:41] being a scholar there's a lot of things
[7:42] that would have been sounded great and
[7:46] thanks but you know that was one thing
[7:47] that he said I come in fear and
[7:49] trembling and weakness you know he came
[7:53] in a certain way that he wanted to speak
[7:55] to him because he wanted to see Jesus
[7:58] Christ and you know the thing is it is
[8:02] to see Jesus Christ in to know what he
[8:04] has and what he has said to us and it
[8:10] says here that we might know the things
[8:12] that are freely given to us of God so
[8:15] you know he wanted to come and he wanted
[8:17] them to see Jesus Christ but he wanted
[8:19] them to know what what the word had to
[8:20] say and let's look and see what the word
[8:23] has to say for us because that's what
[8:26] was given to us and he says there was a
[8:28] mystery here and he said it was speak it
[8:30] was spoken and he said it and say the
[8:33] world can't see that it's not it's not
[8:36] naturally discerned he said it takes the
[8:39] Spirit of God to find these things and
[8:41] you know if we don't stand we don't have
[8:43] the Spirit of God to to look at these
[8:45] things and you know we find many many
[8:51] things in the scripture that you know
[8:53] Paul talks about some things that
[8:55] program talk about but you know it took
[8:57] it takes a fivefold ministry you know it
[9:01] took it took something to bring these
[9:03] things out because you know it wasn't in
[9:06] love the world being able to discern
[9:08] these things when the world to be able
[9:10] to find them because he said if not he
[9:12] said they would have crucified Jesus but
[9:15] it wasn't but it wasn't for them to see
[9:17] those things but it's but it's for us
[9:20] and it's for us to me to realize that
[9:22] they're friendly given to us
[9:25] you know if we if we take things and you
[9:27] know if we realize that it's freely
[9:29] given to us you know it's not that we
[9:31] have to struggle and strive and try to
[9:35] obtain something though it's free if
[9:37] it's free then it's free you know
[9:40] brother Brent said it it's you know and
[9:42] he wants to give this to you more than
[9:44] you want it for yourself so if it's free
[9:46] then you know we're not having a
[9:47] struggle and strive to get it
[9:49] it wants to us whatever thing is is
[9:52] you've got to know how to get it you
[9:54] know just like he talks about the two
[9:56] groups of people he said you know one
[9:57] group knows how to write a check but
[9:59] they got no money in the bank and the
[10:01] other ones got money in the bank they
[10:02] don't know how to write a check but see
[10:04] the problem is that you've got to get
[10:06] them together he said if they know how
[10:07] to write a check cause the money's in
[10:08] the bank you know when brother Brent
[10:10] hopes about the story one of my favorite
[10:12] stories is the lady that didn't have any
[10:15] money in June if she was poor and she
[10:17] had to go to charity you know you know
[10:19] many people you know heard me tell the
[10:21] story many times but I just love that
[10:22] story is why they called it speaks to me
[10:24] you know and you know you know she was
[10:26] without but you know she had those what
[10:30] she thought was pretty pictures yeah she
[10:33] had pretty pictures and you know and
[10:35] they said well let me
[10:36] let's see those pictures and when she
[10:39] when he got her Bible she had those
[10:41] pictures in her mouth and when she
[10:44] opened him up in the hand him to her you
[10:46] know they were back drafts her son had
[10:50] sent her that money but she didn't know
[10:51] what she had and he said what lady in
[10:54] what light in the Bible what leg in the
[10:55] lids of her Bible was a real help to her
[10:58] but she didn't see that somebody had to
[11:01] come and show her what late in the lids
[11:03] of the bottom and you know many times we
[11:06] have people that you know well I can
[11:08] just get it myself
[11:09] you know brother they said rubber makes
[11:12] the foot one time people say well you
[11:13] know I don't have to go to church you
[11:14] know I can just live a good Christian
[11:16] life he said you can't you know if that
[11:21] if a fivefold ministry wasn't required
[11:23] then he wouldn't put it in the scripture
[11:25] to have
[11:27] they don't they never would have just
[11:29] fallen out of the sky and you know
[11:31] weather just stripped over it it just
[11:34] hit us all in the head but it didn't it
[11:38] takes it takes a person to come speak
[11:40] these things to us that land the lives
[11:42] of the Bible and how many times have we
[11:43] taken the Bible and we've read and read
[11:46] and listen to brother Brown same things
[11:48] and all of a sudden it takes a minister
[11:50] to come by and speak somebody speaks
[11:51] something to us and we see that and I
[11:54] can remember years ago brother Harold
[11:56] Hill Debrett preached to the message and
[11:58] he was on the masterpiece and not long
[12:02] before I heard brother Hill Brett preach
[12:04] I had read the book the masterpiece
[12:07] and I was sitting in it was a video that
[12:09] somebody had given me of him preaching
[12:12] and I was sitting him up in the basement
[12:13] listening and I was watching and brother
[12:17] Hilda bright started bringing things out
[12:19] of the masterpiece and I was like I
[12:22] didn't hear that
[12:23] so I finally stopped the take them and
[12:26] got the book and I brought it in there
[12:28] and he started reading things out of the
[12:30] masterpiece and you know what it and I
[12:33] was like well I read that I had to read
[12:36] that but something had to strike it that
[12:40] it was there I had read over it and all
[12:44] of a sudden brother Brett was saying
[12:46] that things have struck me and it was
[12:48] like wow that wasn't there and I didn't
[12:49] see that and you know rock wise because
[12:52] it's so important to have a fivefold
[12:54] ministry because you know we've seen
[12:57] people that have you know we've read
[12:59] things we've studied things but you
[13:01] don't want I've heard so many times
[13:03] people preach but you know what I thank
[13:05] God that we have a five fold ministry
[13:06] that we have a ministry that preaches
[13:10] the word and you know it takes the Holy
[13:12] Ghost it takes laying before the the
[13:15] word for it to conduct to life for them
[13:18] to see mate you know I'm Alma try to
[13:23] come we'll get a handle on himself and
[13:25] my notes here but brother Karen yes sir
[13:27] what
[13:29] the faith that we have from other
[13:34] religions out there back to what you
[13:37] mentioned earlier power demonstration of
[13:39] God and what separated brother Branham
[13:42] and why we know that God sent him it was
[13:47] power in demonstrate right and as you
[13:52] were mentioning not knowing that things
[13:53] are available for us
[14:04] we have a lot of teaching instruction
[14:08] and but putting it it into action is
[14:12] where the separation is going to take
[14:15] place and I still appreciate brother Ram
[14:22] the power of the spoken word but and how
[14:25] often do things come out of our lips
[14:28] that we aren't even aware of that were
[14:32] defeating power and demonstration in our
[14:35] lives
[14:35] I can't do that run my family we've
[14:38] always had this I have to go to the
[14:41] doctor because I gotta watch out for
[14:42] this how many times are we in fighting
[14:47] forces in our life that we can be free
[14:51] of rut and a part of the five hope is
[14:54] dish to share those things right to
[14:56] share how to be delivered from from even
[15:01] illnesses pains in our body right so I
[15:05] just appreciate how Paul said I can come
[15:09] like in that day and age I can come and
[15:11] teach right like Galileo my instructor
[15:15] did and I can do this that and the other
[15:18] but you'll be following uh maybe even a
[15:22] cunningly devised by religion to some
[15:25] sort offshoot of world we're called to
[15:28] be especially in this day and age power
[15:30] and demonstration and this morning I
[15:32] woke up again encouraged there's three
[15:34] three things that I believe the Lord's
[15:36] that being released in the earth right
[15:38] now one is truly his love to be able to
[15:43] flow through his bride
[15:45] another is boldness I want to speak the
[15:49] word I've been praying that X was a
[15:52] chapter or there were they pray boldness
[15:56] to sprits
[15:57] beat your word and to stretch forth your
[16:00] arm to heal and to see the signs and
[16:03] wonders take place in the site the other
[16:05] thing namely Jesus issue and then the
[16:08] third thing is a favor I've been I think
[16:10] favors being released I not sent away to
[16:13] never before then we can talk to people
[16:16] I mean the other day at the job site I
[16:18] had a whole group of people I was
[16:20] telling us experiences about
[16:22] supernatural things and another brother
[16:24] and I rented a book about and he said
[16:27] guys in her and to just been cussing
[16:29] like before that and one guy had talked
[16:31] about being in prison and that he go he
[16:34] went red well that was a sign to me if
[16:36] if there's anybody here that goes red
[16:39] and just gets in a fit of rage that's a
[16:42] that's a demon I mean that this plan is
[16:44] simple there they go they today I've
[16:46] learned that they run in games you have
[16:49] like murder will be on the end of anger
[16:53] and violence or what have you that those
[16:58] are actual spirits and they run in gangs
[17:00] and murder usually tagging along to try
[17:02] and manifest it so that's all the
[17:04] spiritual doing but looking for vessels
[17:06] to manifest them so so I shared with
[17:08] them you need there need to be
[17:10] deliverance in your life because there's
[17:11] a demon there that's trying to manifest
[17:13] itself and in it how do we know that we
[17:17] can be delivered of things or what we
[17:18] just say with us I'm Irish so if I'm
[17:20] gonna be angry there's no way I'm going
[17:22] there all of those rage is that just who
[17:23] I am and you don't don't burst yourself
[17:25] that's a double in the family line that
[17:27] we can take care of those soul ties to
[17:30] hold generational spirits that want to
[17:32] hang around weddings you know
[17:34] so anyway I think I didn't I just want
[17:37] to make people aware of exactly we're in
[17:39] a game because you know only thing about
[17:40] it is is when when you receive the
[17:43] spirit of the price when you have this
[17:45] when you have the Holy Spirit now he
[17:47] said he was a gentleman
[17:48] rubber emcees a gentleman but see the
[17:50] thing is is you gotta allow him to work
[17:52] because you hear the
[17:55] now are you going to act them because we
[17:57] can hinder The Weekender the work of God
[17:59] it's not that we don't have the word go
[18:02] where do we hinder the work of going
[18:03] because we hinder the work of God
[18:05] because of our own actions and their own
[18:07] words because what we speak because if
[18:11] we don't if we don't speak the word what
[18:14] he says whether we feel it or not we're
[18:16] the you know whether we don't see it or
[18:18] not if we speak what he says it comes to
[18:20] pass
[18:21] because our words are seats that were
[18:23] sewing so are we so when the word that
[18:26] God said are we so in the word that we
[18:28] think he said let every man's word be
[18:33] alive and might be true and he said
[18:37] brother M said that he's a high priest
[18:39] the Bible says he's a high priest that
[18:40] can be touched by the feeling of our
[18:42] infirmities and if we Berlin said if we
[18:44] don't confess to say the same thing he
[18:46] did he cannot act on that he's lonely
[18:50] he's available exactly he hates the high
[18:52] priest acts on what we prove what we can
[18:54] face now going back to what you were
[18:56] saying I was before the scripture that I
[18:58] was going to was Hosea 4 and in Hosea 4
[19:02] you know Hosea brings to the brings to
[19:06] the people and if you if you go to Hosea
[19:09] verse 1 and you start reading the
[19:11] chapter and four time I'm not going we
[19:14] wouldn't go there today but you know
[19:17] when he starts bringing out when you
[19:19] when you start reading and home sale
[19:20] when he starts talking about what what
[19:23] was going on and how they lacked the
[19:27] word verse four says my people are
[19:30] destroyed for lack of knowledge because
[19:33] thou has rejected knowledge I will also
[19:36] reject thee that thou shalt be no being
[19:39] no priest to me seeing thou has
[19:41] forgotten the law of thy God I will also
[19:43] forget that children now if you go back
[19:46] and start reading at verse 1 you'll find
[19:48] out that he talks about Indian and
[19:51] murder and all the different things that
[19:53] was going on and and the scripture even
[19:57] before verse full when you start reading
[19:59] he talks about them bringing complaints
[20:03] against one
[20:05] he said not Stryver contend against one
[20:08] another because God said that it was not
[20:11] the people see the people work tough to
[20:13] work and he said the problem was enough
[20:16] though people and he said don't bring it
[20:18] he said because it's the priests fault
[20:21] God said I'm bringing the accusation to
[20:24] the priests because the priests were the
[20:26] ones that didn't preach the word he said
[20:28] they not they y'all have failed to bring
[20:30] the work to the feet and then he says
[20:33] y'all stumble in the day and he said in
[20:35] the prophets felt in the night he said
[20:38] they both fall in the night he said what
[20:40] was it he said so the priest because
[20:43] they had gotten away from the word
[20:44] because they were too lags and too
[20:47] afraid to to have boldness to speak to
[20:50] the people and tell them what the truth
[20:51] was the people had gotten all mixed up
[20:55] they said they had because of the place
[20:57] and then the Bible says and blood
[20:58] touches blood the scripture tells us
[21:01] that it was it was they had murdering so
[21:04] often that one blood shed touched the
[21:09] other blood ship that's how much that's
[21:13] how much the the murdering was going on
[21:15] and what struck me was you know that's
[21:18] the way we are with our words we can
[21:21] edify somebody or we can destroy
[21:23] somebody and you know what there may not
[21:26] be bloodshed but you know by the words
[21:29] that you speak to somebody it's just the
[21:32] same brother Brent says if you if you
[21:34] say something against your brother and
[21:37] you cause someone to be offended by this
[21:40] said it's the same as murdering here
[21:42] if you kill somebody's influence you
[21:48] might as well just took a knife and stab
[21:49] him in the heart and that's what that's
[21:53] what he was that he was telling Hosea
[21:55] the Hosea was bringing to the people and
[21:57] what struck me is you know he didn't say
[22:00] my people are weak because the lack of
[22:03] knowledge they said my people are
[22:05] destroyed because of the lack of
[22:08] knowledge and he says because the
[22:11] priests didn't bring the word see that's
[22:13] the reason that it's important
[22:15] to have a fivefold ministry but see the
[22:17] thing is is it's we take on that
[22:20] responsibility because we are the ones
[22:23] that should labor in that it's it you
[22:28] know because you know everybody says
[22:29] well the fivefold mean you know they can
[22:31] to point fingers and oh you know but see
[22:33] the thing is is yeah you can always find
[22:35] one that's wrong you can always find one
[22:37] that's failed you know all the different
[22:39] things but you know what look at the
[22:41] ones you know because they I was
[22:43] speaking the other Wednesday night
[22:45] you know when Satan always brings things
[22:48] and it happened in your life and you see
[22:50] things that have happened and he says
[22:51] well you know what about this and what
[22:53] about that and this happened and that
[22:55] happened but you know what when when
[22:57] every devil inhales against you when
[23:01] every gun has been pointed at you when
[23:03] there is no way out and everybody has
[23:07] even people that don't even that are not
[23:09] Christians and yet they are the ones
[23:11] that have to testify that it was
[23:13] Almighty God to come on the scene and
[23:15] moved in that situation you know what
[23:16] you never find Satan bringing that back
[23:18] up and saying what about that right
[23:23] you know when when the three Hebrew
[23:25] children were in the fire when they were
[23:28] getting ready to be thrown in and they
[23:29] said listen said we don't care
[23:31] our God is more than able to deliver us
[23:34] but if he does not deliver us from this
[23:36] fire we still won't battle we'll still
[23:39] have the same testimony that we have
[23:40] when we go in yet but you know what when
[23:43] they went in God came on the scene and
[23:45] became visible among them that everybody
[23:48] else had to testify because when the
[23:50] King looked in he saw the four men
[23:52] standing under fire when those three
[23:54] boys came out they didn't have the smell
[23:56] of smoke on them they more singe they
[23:59] can have a sunburn did mess up their
[24:01] clothes right they didn't have anything
[24:05] and they come out of fire and you know
[24:06] what they had to testify that they'd
[24:08] sing God come on this it see in those
[24:10] situations anyone were surfing exactly
[24:14] exactly that's what's going on today we
[24:15] serve the same God takes the same
[24:19] yesterday today and forever you know
[24:21] brother Matt says in this is from the
[24:26] message if God be with us then where is
[24:28] all the miracles and spaces someone said
[24:33] to me one time I know the doctor was
[24:34] talking about a miracle that had to
[24:36] happen among a sick person he said to me
[24:38] preacher don't you believe if I told
[24:41] them people to go up and touch a tree or
[24:43] post the same thing would take place I
[24:45] said no sir that's it because you cannot
[24:48] have faith in touching a tree or a post
[24:50] faith is not that loose it's got to be
[24:53] based upon some note in fact you've got
[24:56] to know something about what you are
[24:58] having faith in because you can have
[25:01] faith in it so we first must know and
[25:04] what what God's desire is what God's
[25:08] plan is and how to approach God by that
[25:11] plan and then we can walk up boldly to
[25:13] the throne of grace complete what the
[25:15] plan is promised us so if we know so
[25:21] that's the reason that you have to be in
[25:22] the word to know what God has saved him
[25:24] and how to approach God you know many
[25:27] people that it's not that they don't
[25:29] have
[25:30] I had a preacher one time use that as an
[25:33] examples we go to hit one of those
[25:35] switches it's got a turn on right mm-hmm
[25:39] you have that simple faith it's going to
[25:41] come up it's that it's that it's that
[25:44] simple when we take God of this word and
[25:48] we know it's supposed to end if it's not
[25:49] happening in that way we call somebody
[25:51] and say hey why is it happening that way
[25:53] that's right or preacher use that one
[25:55] time for that perfect example knowing we
[25:59] having faith in something that we've
[26:01] experienced we've walked out or we've
[26:04] heard someone else walk out why can't I
[26:06] have that same thing where the word says
[26:41] I'm perfect whether you like it or not
[26:43] whether you see it or not that's not
[26:46] that's not as nothing to do with that
[26:48] word perfect is mature exactly sure sons
[26:51] and daughters in this day and age we've
[26:52] been given you said but say the thing is
[26:57] is you when you become mature when you
[26:59] grow up you're growing into the stature
[27:01] of Jesus Christ okay
[27:03] now the thing is is Jesus nothing Jesus
[27:06] not only was mature because he was God
[27:09] but he was perfect no when we look at
[27:15] the word perfect I mean what does that
[27:16] mean that means that there you're not
[27:19] not lacking anything he walked up with
[27:21] the father and son know everything that
[27:23] was there was was perfect what because
[27:26] it was exactly what the scripture said
[27:28] was when he come out he said you know
[27:31] showed me where I disbelieve the word
[27:33] amen
[27:33] where'd were this right here because the
[27:36] body was built by the Old Testament
[27:38] prophets they spoke the word and
[27:40] when came in so when he walked up there
[27:42] he was exactly what they see oh yeah so
[27:45] he was perfect in the fact that he was
[27:47] exactly what the word said it so not
[27:51] only are we growing in maturity because
[27:53] you know if you but if you receive the
[27:55] Spirit of Christ if you receive the new
[27:58] birth you are perfect in know there's
[28:02] still a growth that we have to come to
[28:04] into maturity but we're still perfect if
[28:08] because the thing is is if we're not if
[28:09] we're not perfect if we if we don't come
[28:13] to and you know and everybody just you
[28:16] know you know we're not perfect though
[28:18] you're not ever gonna have a problem
[28:19] it's not the perfection that you know
[28:22] you don't ever have singing but you know
[28:24] we have a blood that makes us perfect
[28:28] well your thoughts in right now exact
[28:30] everything is under the blood so that
[28:32] they end us and to say they still
[28:33] covering us today amen
[28:35] all the way up until the bodycheck
[28:36] Jonathan the scripture tells us is you
[28:40] know we don't know what we would be but
[28:42] we know that we'll be like him wheesht
[28:45] by cold will see him as he is so as we
[28:48] come to that place in we are reaching
[28:49] that perfection missing people as people
[28:53] will look to well I have this and I have
[28:55] it no you're perfect this thing that
[28:58] pest house is only working on that real
[29:01] us the perfection part so don't don't
[29:04] identify with this thing here this is
[29:06] only being used to perfect the character
[29:09] like you said abroad of our Messiah
[29:11] because there is the time well this will
[29:12] be made perfect yeah the same curse will
[29:15] be removed
[29:17] brother it says in God's chosen place of
[29:20] worship he says now notice in the aroma
[29:25] 16 he said worship in the place that
[29:28] I've chosen
[29:29] now you must worship God he said in the
[29:31] place that I've chosen not what someone
[29:33] else chose but what I have chosen now if
[29:37] God chose a place it behooves us then to
[29:40] find out what he said about it and where
[29:43] is it I want to find it and truly I want
[29:45] to worship
[29:47] he talks about the different
[29:49] denominations we are here to worship
[29:50] together takes it we're all seeking
[29:53] something he said I want to know truth
[29:56] the Bible said you shall know the truth
[29:58] and the truth shall make you free
[30:00] somebody you can't know what you're
[30:03] doing you don't know how to do it until
[30:06] you know how to do it you don't know
[30:10] what to do
[30:11] until you know how to do it rather you
[30:13] must know what you're doing and how to
[30:16] do it this shows us that God has a
[30:18] meeting place for worship ours and one
[30:21] certain place in that place only God
[30:23] meets his worshipers so we must know the
[30:27] truth and the truth that set us free
[30:29] they said there's a way big God wants us
[30:32] to know how to do it and we got to know
[30:33] what we're doing and how to do it
[30:41] so we must know these things in the the
[30:48] definition of no ties a lot of lot of
[30:52] scriptures together but to no means to
[30:55] understand or perceive as a factor truth
[30:59] to apprehend clearly with certainty he
[31:03] says to have established or fixed in the
[31:05] mind or memory to be cognizant or aware
[31:10] of to understand from experience or
[31:13] attainment usually that says to be able
[31:20] to distinguish as one from another or
[31:23] deserve so when we know something when
[31:26] he says we must know these things we
[31:28] must be able to not only to understand
[31:31] perceive but discern these things
[31:32] because as a scripture says the
[31:35] spiritual Mendes earns spiritual things
[31:38] and the natural man deserves natural
[31:40] things and it has to be by the Spirit of
[31:42] God that we know these things that we
[31:43] can discern these things and in the
[31:49] scripture in 2nd Peter chapter 3 verse 1
[31:53] says this second epistle beloved I now
[31:57] write unto you in both which I stir up
[31:59] your remember about your pure Minds by
[32:03] way of remembrance and he may be mindful
[32:06] of the things which were spoken before
[32:08] by the holy prophets and of the
[32:10] commandment of us of us the apostles of
[32:13] the of the Lord and Savior knowing this
[32:17] first that there shall come in the last
[32:19] days scoffers walking after their own
[32:21] lusts and saying where is the promise of
[32:23] his coming for since the father's fell
[32:26] asleep all things continue as they were
[32:28] from the beginning for this they
[32:33] willingly are ignorant of that by the
[32:35] Word of God the heavens were old and the
[32:38] earth standing out of the water and in
[32:40] the water whereby the world was then was
[32:42] that was then was being overflowed with
[32:45] water perished but the heavens and the
[32:49] earth which are now by the same
[32:51] are kept in store reserved unto fire
[32:53] against the day of judgment and
[32:55] perdition of ungodly men but beloved be
[32:58] not ignorant of this one thing that the
[33:00] that one day is with the Lord as a
[33:03] thousand years and a thousand years as
[33:06] one day so you know even you know as the
[33:12] scripture came forth and then he says
[33:14] that in the last days of big scholars
[33:18] that will cover he says I want you stir
[33:21] up your pure Minds in a way of
[33:22] remembrance of these things these things
[33:25] that you should know they said and the
[33:28] scoffers will come in the last days
[33:29] wanting to know where's the sign of his
[33:32] coming and he said you know they're
[33:35] speaking of these things and said you
[33:36] know things continue as they are but yet
[33:38] he said they're willingly are ignorant
[33:40] of the fact that the earth has already
[33:42] been destroyed say they've not even seen
[33:44] what's been taking place they said you'd
[33:47] be speaking to us to understand these
[33:49] things but we should know what the
[33:52] scripture has to say and I don't look it
[33:59] up I don't have I don't have it on the
[34:02] screen this morning but I just want to
[34:05] read a few scriptures I'm gonna kind of
[34:07] go through so and just kind of hit a few
[34:10] things but there's two there's two
[34:12] things that we know we've been looking
[34:14] at this morning and one of them is to
[34:17] know something and the and the other one
[34:20] don't look yet if we're where Peter says
[34:23] here not to be ignorant of something and
[34:26] you know there's a lot of scriptures
[34:27] throughout the Bible and oh the
[34:29] homecoming we don't have time to go
[34:32] through all of them but I just want to
[34:33] point out a few scriptures that we look
[34:34] and this is from then what the Apostles
[34:36] wrote that we can move and go through it
[34:39] and just look at some of them and listen
[34:42] to what listen to off of the Apostle
[34:43] Paul and John and therefore once right
[34:45] and then we're going to look at we'll
[34:48] look at some other ones but starting in
[34:51] Romans chapter 3 verse 19 and Paul says
[34:55] and we know that what things soever the
[34:59] law saith is saying itself to them
[35:02] under the law that every mouth may be
[35:04] stopped and all the world may become
[35:07] guilty before God Romans 7:14 says for
[35:12] we know that the law is spiritual but I
[35:15] am carnal sold under sin Romans 8:22
[35:19] says for we know that the whole creation
[35:22] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[35:24] until now Romans 8:26 says likewise the
[35:30] Spirit helpeth our infirmities for we
[35:32] know not what we should pray as before
[35:36] as we all but the spirit itself maketh
[35:38] intercession for us with groanings which
[35:40] cannot be uttered Romans 8:28 says for
[35:44] we know that all things work together
[35:47] for the good to them that love God to
[35:49] them who are the called according to his
[35:52] purpose
[35:53] 1st Corinthians 8:1 says now as touching
[35:57] things offered unto idols we know that
[36:00] we have that we all have knowledge
[36:02] knowledge puffeth up but charity
[36:04] edifieth 1st corinthians 8:4 says that's
[36:09] concerning therefore the eating of those
[36:11] things that are offered in sacrifice
[36:13] unto idols we know that an idol is
[36:15] nothing in the world and that there is
[36:18] no other god but woman 1st corinthians
[36:22] 13 verse 9 says for we know in part and
[36:27] prophesy in part
[36:28] verse 10 says but when that which is
[36:31] perfect is come then that which is in
[36:33] part shall be done away 2nd Corinthians
[36:37] 5:1 says for we know that if our earthly
[36:41] house of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[36:43] we have a building of God a house not
[36:46] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[36:49] 1st Corinthians 5:16 says therefore
[36:52] henceforth know we no man after the
[36:55] flesh yea though we have known Christ
[36:58] after the flesh yet now henceforth know
[37:01] we him no more
[37:05] 1st Timothy 1 verse 8 says
[37:08] but we know that the law is good if a
[37:10] man use it lawfully
[37:12] Hebrews 1030 says for we know that him
[37:19] for we know him that hath said vengeance
[37:21] belongeth unto me I will recompense
[37:23] saith the Lord and the go and again the
[37:26] Lord shall judge his people and at first
[37:31] John first John first - chapter 2 verse
[37:35] 3 says and hereby we do know that we
[37:39] know him if we can keep his commandments
[37:42] in verse 5 says but whosoever keepeth
[37:47] his word and him verily is the love of
[37:49] God perfected hereby know we that we are
[37:53] in him first John 2:18 says little
[37:58] children it is the last time as we have
[38:01] heard that anta that enterprise shall
[38:03] come even thou art of their many
[38:05] Antichrist whereby we know that it is
[38:08] the last time he says first Corinthians
[38:13] 3 - says beloved now we are the sons of
[38:16] God and it does not yet appear what we
[38:19] shall be but we shall know that when he
[38:22] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[38:24] shall see him as he is first grant first
[38:27] job 3:14 says we know that we have
[38:30] passed from death unto life because we
[38:33] love the Brethren he that loveth not his
[38:35] brother abideth in them
[38:43] first John nothing I'm not reading all
[38:46] over that this just trying to get a few
[38:48] but first John chapter 5 the beginning
[38:51] of verse 15 he says and if we know that
[38:54] he hears us whatsoever we ask we know
[38:57] that we have the petitions that we
[39:00] desired of him and if any man see his
[39:03] brother sin a sin which is not unto them
[39:05] he shall ask and he shall give him life
[39:07] for them that sin not unto death there
[39:11] is a death there's a sin unto death I do
[39:14] not say that he shall pray for it all
[39:18] right now all unrighteousness is sin and
[39:20] there is a sin not unto death we know
[39:22] that whosoever is born of God sin if not
[39:25] but he that is begotten of God keepeth
[39:28] himself and that wicked one toucheth him
[39:31] not and we know that we are of God in
[39:34] the whole world lieth in wickedness so
[39:41] there's more scriptures that work but
[39:42] that's what I was amazed at is how many
[39:44] times where the Apostles are right
[39:46] especially Paul where he says we know we
[39:49] know we know we know and then you go and
[39:52] then I will read all of them but here I
[39:54] just looked up in the Greek it's the
[39:57] inferences to be hidden from one
[39:59] something that they're unaware of herbs
[40:02] even secretly run from in the Hebrew
[40:05] they take the word know to know and they
[40:09] just put the knots next to it so you're
[40:11] not knowing I just thought that was so
[40:14] interesting how it's the same word for
[40:16] no but they just put the negative roman
[40:19] in the hebrew a''- yeah doc and i just
[40:23] went across the minister this week so
[40:24] it's interesting you this popped up that
[40:26] was talking about how God has laid out
[40:29] in our path
[40:30] thinks he wants us to find about himself
[40:34] and then we can share with others or
[40:36] however edifies us right he said it's
[40:38] like a two-year-old it media's mr. bone
[40:41] Easter eggs or whatever you sit around
[40:43] on the floor you want them the time
[40:45] to buy this this this this this gift or
[40:48] treasure right and then you said that
[40:53] when we pass on the other side God talks
[40:57] about on that mantle ages to come we're
[41:00] gonna continue to reveal to us his mercy
[41:03] his his his his manifold mercy there the
[41:07] scripture talks about right and I just
[41:09] thought how we're in this neat little
[41:11] journey on this side and God actually is
[41:13] laying things along our way that we're
[41:16] going to stumble on because we need to
[41:18] eventually written as we're becoming
[41:20] mature and learning we're gonna come
[41:22] into that place to eat wants us to eat
[41:24] before we get out of here then we get on
[41:26] the other side it's going to continue
[41:28] britta umpteen age is still revealing
[41:31] finding out about the one we're in love
[41:33] with yeah I just thought that was a neat
[41:35] encouragement to keep fighting this
[41:38] battle well anyway I didn't get to the
[41:42] scriptures Rick what Paul says that we
[41:44] should not be ignorant of the rete one
[41:47] of the personal s first Thessalonians 4
[41:50] you know Paul says but I would not have
[41:52] you ignorant brethren concerning them
[41:54] that are asleep so there's different
[41:56] scriptures in there and we didn't wait
[41:58] to get to those but I've been expecting
[42:00] to get through all this this morning but
[42:02] so there's a lot to cover but you know
[42:04] there's lots of time for falseness I
[42:06] would not have you ignorant brother I
[42:08] would not have you and you know it's
[42:10] it's important you know because the
[42:13] scripture has word of a certain length
[42:14] and you know it's for us to know these
[42:16] things and that you know it's just one
[42:19] thing had come in when I was looking at
[42:20] this was Jesus said verily verily I say
[42:23] unto you rubber am said that man
[42:24] absolutely
[42:25] you know he was calling their attention
[42:27] to what he was saying in lots of times I
[42:29] think when when Paul was the Apostles
[42:31] are writing we know these things are not
[42:33] being there these things I think it's
[42:35] important for us to look at what they
[42:36] have to say
[42:37] the
[42:37] I think they're bringing us a point that
[42:39] you know that we need to look at be
[42:41] cognizant of ss you this morning
[42:46] [Music]
