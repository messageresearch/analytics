[3:10] Lord we know that we're human and we're
[3:12] gonna have problems where we're going to
[3:15] be sick and things like that but we have
[3:17] some that are seriously into situations
[3:20] that need you Lord so we just ask you to

[3:31] in Jesus name Amen
[3:38] Asians to verse 8 for by grace are you
[3:43] saved through faith and that not of
[3:46] yourselves it is the gift of God okay
[3:49] let's go over to 1st Peter 1 and we'll
[3:55] begin reading the thirteenth verse
[3:57] through I guess the twenty-fifth says
[4:01] we're for gird up the loins of your mind
[4:02] be sober and hope to the end for the
[4:06] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[4:09] the revelation of Jesus Christ now there
[4:13] supposed to be a grace brought to us at
[4:16] a revelation so Grace and revelations
[4:18] got to go together that's if you don't
[4:21] get anything of the night you get that
[4:22] part grace and revelation has to be
[4:25] interlocked with each other you know
[4:27] because that's that's where it is all
[4:29] right as obedient children not
[4:31] fashioning yourselves according to the
[4:33] former lusts in your ignorance but as he
[4:37] which have called you is holy be so be
[4:40] ye holy in all manner of conversation
[4:43] because it is written be there being you
[4:46] holy for I am holy and if you call on
[4:49] the father who without respect of
[4:51] persons judgeth according to every man's
[4:54] work pass the time of your sojourning
[4:56] here in fear for as much as you know
[5:00] that we were not redeemed with
[5:02] corruptible things as silver and gold
[5:05] from your vain conversation received by
[5:09] tradition from your father's it won't do
[5:11] it
[5:13] that won't redeem you right is that what
[5:16] it's saying for as much as you know that
[5:18] you were not redeemed with corruptible
[5:21] things it won't work they don't matter
[5:25] what we think of this that or the other
[5:26] it won't work all right from your vain
[5:30] conversation received by tradition from
[5:32] your father's but with the precious
[5:35] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[5:37] blemish and
[5:38] that spot Hoover Lee was foreordained
[5:40] before the foundation of the world what
[5:43] was manifest in these last times for you
[5:45] who by him do believe in God that raised
[5:49] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[5:52] that your faith and hope might be in God
[5:55] seeing you have purified your souls and
[5:59] obeying the truth through the spirit
[6:01] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[6:07] that you love one another with a pure
[6:09] heart fervently being born again not of
[6:13] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[6:17] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[6:19] forever for all flesh is as grass and
[6:23] all the glory of him as the flower of
[6:25] the grace the rice with grace withereth
[6:30] and the flower thereof falleth away but
[6:34] the word of the Lord endureth forever
[6:36] now watch him and this is the word of
[6:39] the Lord which by the gospel is preached
[6:43] unto you and you may be seated the Lord
[6:46] at his best seen to the reading of the
[6:48] word no it really enjoyed this past
[6:54] weekend with brother Forney I think he's
[6:56] done a marvelous job and everything we
[6:58] appreciate everything
[6:59] no but just break the Lord would lead us
[7:03] on in your love all right
[7:05] now we've been talking about the new
[7:08] birth our salvation and knowing that the
[7:13] new birth consists of justification
[7:16] sanctification and the baptism of the
[7:18] Holy Spirit they asked brother Branham
[7:20] and the questions and answers is it
[7:22] required for you to have these three
[7:25] stages he said absolutely all right no
[7:30] matter if you think you received it at
[7:32] one time or if it took you 20 years to
[7:35] get it no matter what you're gonna have
[7:37] to go through that's my point to say to
[7:39] you all of us if we received it at one
[7:42] time praise God if if it took us 20
[7:45] years praise God he took us three and a
[7:47] half years like the disciple praise God
[7:50] all right let's see we got to do it and
[7:52] ever what it is it has to go through
[7:54] those three stages and all I've been
[7:58] trying to do is to show you what those
[8:01] stages are and try to compare them to
[8:05] our natural you know our lives in our
[8:09] journey because that's why I believe the
[8:13] disciples that they were three and a
[8:14] half years with the Lord Jesus before
[8:16] they receive the new birth that was not
[8:20] necess
[8:20] mean was was necessary for them but it
[8:24] was laid there for you and me if we want
[8:29] to know something about the the way that
[8:31] it takes place go back and read Matthew
[8:34] Mark Luke and John and see what the
[8:37] disciples went through all right then we
[8:40] can go to other things and say well then
[8:43] 3,000 the same day receive West great
[8:46] wonderful I believe in that I believe
[8:49] you can go through it but we have to
[8:51] quote the Prophet you say well you're
[8:53] quoting him for your own benefit okay
[8:55] okay
[8:57] I'm doing it for my own benefit the
[8:58] Prophet said very few people would ever
[9:00] believe all the way okay now that's his
[9:04] wording now if that de-christianized is
[9:07] any of us in our thoughts then we know
[9:10] one thing for sure I mean it's the fact
[9:16] that we don't have it if it makes us
[9:17] upset about what we we do or what we
[9:19] don't do or whatever you know all right
[9:21] now we covered that it would take the
[9:25] three stages because even the last three
[9:29] three ages brother Brennan says the
[9:32] third seal paragraph 169 life the life
[9:37] stage three ages completed the new birth
[9:42] see the ages had to be in correct order
[9:46] for it to come out for us to be in
[9:48] correct order so then it was a
[9:51] completion of it by coming through for
[9:54] justification sanctification the baptism
[9:58] of the Holy Ghost gave those on Azusa
[10:00] Street the new birth amen
[10:04] then the Prophet had to come to bring us
[10:07] the word they had to word for their age
[10:12] in time okay they were already preaching
[10:15] a lot of great things your oneness
[10:17] doctrines and different things were
[10:19] already there before the Prophet came
[10:21] into you know on the same all right but
[10:24] the thing of it is they asked him and we
[10:26] covered that you know about it that
[10:30] there was Lucien's left and one of those
[10:35] loose ends if you're reading what I gave
[10:36] you that was the baptism of the Holy
[10:38] Ghost
[10:38] he said his loose ends all right the
[10:42] Prophet had to come to tie together the
[10:44] loose ends to word that we could be
[10:46] ready for the rapture as he said all
[10:50] right now
[10:51] he then according to Malachi 4 got
[10:56] around said birth pangs prior have 170
[10:58] 172 that the bride is to be delivered of
[11:02] a new birth from according to Malachi 4
[11:05] so there's your new birth of the there's
[11:09] your loose ends to be taken up by
[11:11] Malachi 4 and placed in an order to
[11:13] bring us the complete birth or to finish
[11:17] our birth pricing it in the order and
[11:19] that's why the Prophet had to come and
[11:24] there would have been no way for it ever
[11:26] took place if the Prophet hadn't come on
[11:28] the scene when he came on the scene he
[11:30] started right worth Azusa Street would
[11:33] he started with them and came up because
[11:36] that's what I love about the message it
[11:38] has the greatest of all answers could be
[11:42] thought of I'll get to one in a second
[11:43] where the Prophet says something all
[11:46] right
[11:46] the last three ages then completed to
[11:49] birth and left it to her that this age
[11:53] could come to full maturity are to
[11:58] adoption as we'll get to it later the
[12:00] statue of a perfect man the things that
[12:03] would have to be in this age that would
[12:06] not be there in Luther's age or Wesley's
[12:09] age or Azusa streets you know Pentecost
[12:12] but it would be in this day because they
[12:15] without us cannot be made perfect
[12:17] so they're waiting on us to come to a
[12:20] place of fulfilling our completing that
[12:25] birth all right so then you know that's
[12:29] the point to where we we need to stand
[12:31] whether we're talking what to go outside
[12:33] a little bit about it the that those
[12:37] without us cannot be made perfect do we
[12:40] believe that all right no they asked if
[12:44] you believe this
[12:45] about to live with our workers the
[12:49] Levites our workers got the same pay is
[12:52] the first hour right
[12:54] you know why goes day without us cannot
[12:58] be made perfect so they're waiting on me
[13:01] and you to reach that place to bring
[13:05] them out of the ground and that's why
[13:07] you don't see in there that they're all
[13:09] mad because they didn't get the same pay
[13:12] there's no emphasis related to that
[13:15] story that you'll read to think that
[13:17] they were mad because I had to work all
[13:20] the time and they just went in on free
[13:23] ride dog they didn't go free ride the
[13:27] last part of that age the life part of
[13:30] that day is hard because everything's
[13:32] got to be gathered got to be brought in
[13:34] and lined up and everything got to be
[13:36] cleaned up okay we get onto that so you
[13:39] think about it all right we talked about
[13:41] the prophets saying the seal book
[13:44] paragraph 54 on the third seal that
[13:48] there is a mysterious part of
[13:49] justification sanctification the baptism
[13:52] in the Holy Ghost as I said he covered
[13:55] fuel take it and go back to it to her
[13:57] that this messenger is to top all the
[14:00] loose in one of those loose is was the
[14:01] baptism of the Holy College because
[14:04] people had cabbage down on it and
[14:06] everything else that happened that was
[14:08] one of the mysteries mysteries of what
[14:13] the Baptist says it says the Methodist
[14:17] says is that the presbyterian says it's
[14:19] that we say it's this the brand of might
[14:21] say that what is it that a mysterious
[14:23] part of the new birth just a simple part
[14:27] of being born again
[14:30] all right there's mysteries there in
[14:34] other words a mystery something that is
[14:36] hidden that has to be made known all
[14:40] right see then you'll see one day why it
[14:43] says they then without us cannot be made
[14:46] perfect because they never reached the
[14:48] perfection that was needed to be down
[14:51] through the ages those waiting on you
[14:56] and I okay now that's how important the
[14:59] new birth is we covered the mysterious
[15:02] part I hope you listen to what I was
[15:05] saying that under justification it's in
[15:07] three stages your sins are chopped off
[15:10] by repentance from believing then you go
[15:15] on in your being chopped off chopped off
[15:18] you go on to the basis that you've done
[15:23] it with cry invisible Union you find
[15:28] that it's as though you never done it
[15:32] see chopping off your eyes seeing these
[15:34] chops that all doesn't it into the
[15:35] future but justification under the
[15:38] mysterious part of unveiling it brings
[15:41] it to the basis that we can see that you
[15:45] we done it
[15:47] we done it and God has an exact right to
[15:51] condemn every one of us and kill us but
[15:54] instead of doing that he covers it
[15:57] because he forgives our sins and this is
[16:03] though you never done it then he comes
[16:07] to the bases are saying the real you
[16:11] which is the baptism with the holy ghost
[16:14] never did do that to me it's a great
[16:16] mystery that's a great opportunity for
[16:19] weeks and weeks or months the years for
[16:21] preaching and you know how I'm on one
[16:23] topic I get on something like this I can
[16:25] stay on it for years they don't bother
[16:27] me I know it bothers you but maybe you
[16:30] don't understand what I'm talking about
[16:32] cause if he did you'd be rejoicing
[16:34] saying come on come on come on come on
[16:36] come on preach some more about it
[16:39] that's I get something that says I'm
[16:41] bored and I get others that say don't
[16:43] stop don't quit brother to help keep
[16:47] repeating yourself over and over until
[16:50] we get it okay so where do I go I go
[16:54] down the line all right we covered
[16:57] sanctification in three stages how that
[17:00] you're sanctified by the fact of your
[17:04] repentance and casting out of the
[17:07] unclean spirit and all like that and how
[17:09] your sins are gone all right then we
[17:13] covered that there's a daily
[17:15] sanctification in your growth
[17:16] development a daily sanctification Paul
[17:20] said I die daily see he knew that he had
[17:24] to keep himself under subjection the
[17:28] Prophet said I have to do that you just
[17:31] think of all that he faced you think he
[17:34] didn't have to die daily huh
[17:36] what's he went through daily
[17:38] sanctification then we went through
[17:39] sanctification even under the seals that
[17:42] would bring it to the basis that even
[17:44] the world will be sanctified cleansed
[17:48] and set aside to be able to be used even
[17:53] in starting to be used in the Millennium
[17:55] it has to go into that part all right
[17:57] then we covered the baptism of the Holy
[17:59] Ghost in three stages the new birth were
[18:03] you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior
[18:05] and he comes and lives in you giving you
[18:07] eternal life all right then it comes to
[18:11] and we'll get to it later on on the
[18:14] adoption the adoption to work that you
[18:19] and I have to be adopted into the family
[18:21] all right
[18:22] then it comes to the complete final
[18:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost for a man in
[18:27] the world to cleanse us and make us to
[18:31] be totally pure all right what happens
[18:34] in then God does this because he wants
[18:38] to fill every fiber of the church that
[18:41] was a lie start on what I was on the
[18:44] other Wednesday I guess I feel ever
[18:47] fiber
[18:52] they'll ever fiber that's what he wants
[18:54] to do cuz in doing that we're brother
[18:59] Dale I thought I got everything that's
[19:01] what the Baptist said and brother Owen
[19:03] said they're wrong
[19:04] see you say I got everything when I
[19:06] believe that's not according to
[19:08] Scripture that's contrary to the Bible
[19:11] and the Prophet you say well that that
[19:15] that's not me well that's between you
[19:16] and God that ain't nothing to me I'm not
[19:19] your Savior but I am one thing if you
[19:24] claim me to be your pastor you're gonna
[19:26] hear from me because I'm gonna take the
[19:28] responsibility of being the pastor I'm
[19:30] gonna take responsibility saying it the
[19:32] way I believe it if you don't want it
[19:35] that way then hey help yourself go
[19:39] somewheres I'll do what you want - I
[19:42] want no problems against anybody he
[19:45] never tried to run nobody off but it's
[19:50] kind of like one brother done we
[19:51] preached women in 30 years
[19:52] and he left and he said setting off his
[19:55] women and he said brother Dale I'm
[19:57] leaving us and okay that's your choice
[19:59] he said and I'll never say nothing
[20:02] against you to anybody in any way it's
[20:07] no quebra that's good you know about
[20:12] three or four months later he was
[20:15] telling people that called him and
[20:16] talking to him if you'll come and ask me
[20:18] why I left I'll tell you well I thought
[20:21] he wouldn't don't say nothing against me
[20:24] okay forget it you see that's where I
[20:27] just let the whole thing ride cuz it
[20:29] ain't gonna change me on that all right
[20:31] but now let's get to something because I
[20:34] want you to think about this new birth
[20:38] now I'm gonna approach it funny go up to
[20:42] a spot and try to get you to believe it
[20:44] I'm thinking about all right now to a
[20:49] lot of people the new birth that they
[20:55] get any work when they believe no I'm
[21:00] giving you overall view of the of the
[21:04] system religion part and you know and in
[21:07] this message Park okay a lot of people
[21:11] think you get the baptism of the Holy
[21:12] Ghost when you believe okay are you
[21:23] living now then others believe you don't
[21:28] get to baptism of the Holy Spirit until
[21:30] the headstone comes now that's basically
[21:36] people of the message because the
[21:38] denomination don't know anything about
[21:39] that alright what do you see what I'm
[21:42] talking about look at the vast
[21:44] difference of what people can say they
[21:47] believe people say they get the baptism
[21:49] of the Holy Ghost when they believe I
[21:51] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[21:53] accepted me and give me the baptism the
[21:55] Holy Ghost will praise God the brother
[21:59] Brennan said there was a lot believed
[22:01] and didn't you he said you say you
[22:04] shouted he said there was a lot shouted
[22:06] and didn't get it he said you say you
[22:08] got the baptism he said you can have it
[22:10] every day in your life on your spirit
[22:11] and I go to hell it's time to think over
[22:16] the things the Prophet is saying and
[22:19] that's what I'm trying to do because the
[22:22] Prophet is covering things to give us an
[22:26] opportunity because that's what I've
[22:29] always believed and taught you this way
[22:31] that down through the ages the disciples
[22:35] that's why I believe it where do I
[22:37] believe the Apostle Paul taught adoption
[22:39] etc different things Peter doesn't
[22:42] mention basically the word adoption he
[22:45] may say it or something but he doesn't
[22:48] go deal in that Paul deals with adoption
[22:51] but now Peter he deals with a statute of
[22:55] perfect man in other words Paul I've
[22:58] always taught you this Paul tells us how
[23:00] to go up the statute are from the new
[23:03] birth up to the statute of perfect land
[23:05] to the chains of the body Paul tells us
[23:07] that the Peter tells us how Peter gives
[23:15] the directions of how its to be done so
[23:19] they both brought it together in a
[23:20] wonderful situation I love it when run
[23:23] around and said it this way he said Paul
[23:25] and Peter with no difference in doctrine
[23:26] I love that because you read sometimes
[23:30] repeater and he sound like he's kids
[23:32] Paul read Paul's telling he's against
[23:33] Peter mister prophet said no they wasn't
[23:38] he said this teaching the same identical
[23:41] time all right now so where do we fit
[23:50] where do we fit do we get borned again
[23:54] somewhere here below the pyramid as far
[23:57] as what's called faith is that the point
[24:00] of just believing on the Lord Jesus
[24:01] Christ do we get the new birth iyer or
[24:07] do we get the new birth when it comes up
[24:08] to the pyramid at the top well there's
[24:10] teachings in this message that away
[24:14] teaching you this message say you don't
[24:16] have the baptism of the holy ghost like
[24:18] they did on the day of Pentecost well
[24:20] brother Brown said something see I get
[24:24] if I get people upset at me because I
[24:27] say that but hey remember one thing I'm
[24:30] the pastor I'm gonna say it the way I
[24:33] believe it if you don't want it come to
[24:36] my office we'll sit down talk about it
[24:38] but make sure you bring your equipment
[24:40] we don't come in there to me and say
[24:44] brother Dale I don't agree with you but
[24:48] I don't know words I had and what it is
[24:51] I just don't agree with you don't waste
[24:54] my time or your time just leave it alone
[25:00] tell me where I'm off cause I'm gonna
[25:06] tell you why I don't agree with what
[25:12] get up here and say this is what I
[25:13] believe you know what I'm gonna do I'm
[25:15] gonna prove it about what I believe so I
[25:20] do not believe that you're born again
[25:22] just by believing on the Lord Jesus
[25:24] Christ to give you the full eternal life
[25:29] leave it on the Lord Jesus Christ just
[25:32] doesn't give you the baptism of the Holy
[25:33] Ghost but neither do I believe you got
[25:39] to wait up to the top and get the
[25:41] headstone and all of that - how's the
[25:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe
[25:47] there's a truth in between dark I
[25:49] believe the truth is in between though
[25:54] cuz listen I've got it written down
[25:56] y'all get back to it later and I'll get
[25:58] this point would you ever know this
[25:59] brother branham sayin he said I firmly
[26:02] believe let's see uh you must be born
[26:05] again he said I firmly believe that you
[26:08] are born again and then baptized the end
[26:12] of the body
[26:19] you gonna say well I'm born again I'm
[26:22] baptized in the button no no no what are
[26:25] you gonna say I'm gonna say he's writing
[26:28] both sides because for me to try to
[26:31] correct him that won't work so for me to
[26:35] try to understand so then you just take
[26:39] a statement he makes you are born again
[26:42] by the new birth it places you into the
[26:46] body of Christ and then you are
[26:50] positionally placed in the body for the
[26:55] gifts adoption and the things so he's
[27:02] right and see when you say well well
[27:09] justification brother deal I got where
[27:11] to probably said justification said I
[27:12] save amen I believe that always told it
[27:17] that way well I sure don't sound like
[27:19] what you will you ain't listening
[27:23] could you see when your sins is truly
[27:25] forgiven you now I'm quoting brother
[27:28] branham's he won't pigs I'll say if you
[27:30] find them if you're truly repentant of
[27:33] your sins and died in that position
[27:36] you're going to heaven what he said but
[27:42] now that you'll tell you in another
[27:45] place that don't put you in the body of
[27:47] Christ
[27:48] so you're going to the white throne they
[27:54] don't give you eternal life to just
[27:56] repent of your sins but if you die in
[28:02] that state now remember that too later
[28:04] don't misquote me if you die in the
[28:06] state of the point that you have been
[28:08] repent of your sins and you've come even
[28:11] to sanctification sanctification not
[28:16] being the new birth it's only a way to
[28:19] come to the new earth with
[28:22] sanctification even if you're justified
[28:23] and sanctified if you die in that state
[28:27] yes you're going to heaven yes but you
[28:30] are not going to be in the bride
[28:36] because you've not received eternal life
[28:38] you don't get eternal life at
[28:41] justification you're confessing
[28:44] something you don't get eternal life at
[28:48] sanctification you're confessing
[28:50] something you get eternal life at the
[28:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:58] did you birth well and only those who
[29:03] have the new birth the Prophet said is
[29:05] the ones who qualify for the rapture all
[29:08] right so now then don't misunderstand
[29:11] what I'm saying I believe if you come to
[29:16] the altar and repent of your sins and
[29:17] you die in that state now I said die in
[29:20] that state and it's genuine now don't
[29:22] make me that did somebody come up only
[29:24] be safe okay you're safe no but no no a
[29:26] genuine experience of justification is
[29:31] all this chops off your pie sins a half
[29:34] way south-south step little well out
[29:38] Lord I'm sorry would you forgive me that
[29:42] ain't gonna give you eternal life that's
[29:46] why the Prophet made that statement of
[29:48] the love he said you have accepted Jesus
[29:51] Christ he said but has he accepted you
[29:56] see he said if he accepts you he'll give
[29:59] you the baptism when the only God why
[30:03] are you in me now so what's the end of
[30:06] the scale are we some believe you get
[30:09] mourned again down here somewhere below
[30:11] the pyramid and then others believe you
[30:13] don't get born again until you come up
[30:15] to the headstone which one are we gonna
[30:21] go with all right let's go with
[30:26] something that is so wonderful and
[30:27] marvelous how that prophet could talk
[30:32] about things in such of a way that a
[30:36] child could understand him of what he's
[30:40] saying but yet baffle the theological
[30:45] error what he would call it rim
[30:46] of mankind so simple did he'd make it so
[30:53] simple till the people couldn't father
[30:55] what he's saying well I got him over
[31:00] here where he says here and I got him
[31:01] over here where he says - won't this
[31:03] hold on a little while they'll come
[31:04] together then you'll find out he's
[31:07] saying the same thing and if he ain't
[31:10] saying the same thing you and I'd have
[31:13] no right to try to correct him to say he
[31:15] was right or wrong or whatever it is cuz
[31:18] we're not the Prophet well I don't care
[31:23] who it it you're gonna quote said so and
[31:25] so if you're gonna quote me remember you
[31:27] better quote me right sure I believe if
[31:32] you repent of your sins and die in that
[31:34] state you're going to get eternal life
[31:36] but you're not born again you're gonna
[31:39] go to the white throne judgment and
[31:41] receive eternal life as a foolish virgin
[31:44] okay show me anywhere else it can be so
[31:49] now let's just take something that the
[31:51] Prophet said go ahead brothers over to
[31:53] number six so you'll see these others
[31:57] with quoting recoating I want you to
[31:59] read this little statement number six on
[32:06] the Messiah sixty one one one seven
[32:10] like it reminded me to give these dates
[32:12] I noticed I've got work and I say
[32:15] something don't give the dates that it's
[32:16] on oh you know I'll give the title its
[32:20] owner for them and they order to know it
[32:22] but still so many Atari nice huh alright
[32:26] now for instance when a man gets saved
[32:34] my brother there what happened to me
[32:37] when I got saved the prophets gonna tell
[32:40] you I love his way of telling us because
[32:47] you know what he tells us in a way that
[32:50] it can be attained into he doesn't make
[32:53] it to where it can't be attained unto I
[32:57] mean I hate it for somebody to come up
[33:00] say we're gonna go run a race what is it
[33:05] you're gonna guy four-minute mile he's
[33:08] already broke that and he's probably
[33:09] something broke that behind him well I
[33:11] ain't gonna get in the race cuz I can't
[33:13] run that far I first off I couldn't make
[33:16] it tomorrow the second off I certainly
[33:18] couldn't follow him into speedy runs
[33:21] let's just slow down and listen to what
[33:25] the Prophet says let him explain what
[33:27] happened to you and to me at the new
[33:31] birth let him explain it
[33:36] he's enough for instance when a man gets
[33:38] saved he's just about like the light
[33:43] that comes in to him is about like this
[33:47] little white button on my shirt
[33:49] I thought you so far I thought you come
[33:54] into that all this that you better
[34:02] listen to him the light that comes into
[34:07] them is about like this little white
[34:09] button on my shirt that's when God comes
[34:14] into the inner part of a man now of
[34:18] course we'll stop here to express
[34:20] something you say for instance when a
[34:23] man gets a last year's when he gots
[34:24] repented of his sins he didn't say that
[34:28] so don't you think that well that was
[34:31] when you just get repented he didn't say
[34:34] that
[34:35] let's let him talk a lot that comes into
[34:39] him is about like this little white
[34:41] button on my shirt that's when God comes
[34:43] into the inner part of a man I like that
[34:47] don't you not in his body not his spirit
[34:51] with the inner part in the inner part of
[34:53] a man a man is made up made up in this
[34:56] system of a tabernacle the outer courts
[34:59] in the holy place and the holiest of
[35:01] holies this is kind of glory on the
[35:03] inside the veil now on the outside gates
[35:07] of a man is five senses that enters into
[35:10] his body on the inside which is his soul
[35:12] and I watch him
[35:14] are the the soul is the nature of the
[35:17] spirit that's on the inside of his heart
[35:21] okay produces his soul you realize
[35:28] what's in to you coming outwardly comes
[35:32] from your soul and it produces it
[35:35] outwardly what we do come on the soul is
[35:39] the nature of the Spirit that's on the
[35:40] inside of his heart produces his soul
[35:43] which makes the atmosphere around him
[35:46] y'all he has also five entrances then on
[35:50] the inside he has only one gate one
[35:52] interest to go into this kind of glory
[35:54] where God can enter into him and take
[35:57] over in the control tower
[35:59] that way it's through self will whether
[36:03] you will or - will - or not that's up to
[36:06] you but that's the only Avenue that's
[36:09] open to the man that God can come into
[36:12] his heart
[36:13] it's by self wheel puts him right back
[36:17] like Adam and Eve would you like to be
[36:23] back like Adam and Eve not after the
[36:26] fall now would you like to be back like
[36:30] Adam and Eve but running one spoken word
[36:32] reading her seat he said that brings us
[36:34] back like Adam and Eve like it was in
[36:35] the original well I okay puts them right
[36:40] back like Adam and Eve on the free moral
[36:42] agency you can choose right or wrong
[36:44] either one you want to now self will
[36:47] then God comes down into the man into
[36:50] the heart which is the spirit then the
[36:54] spirit makes the soul and the soul
[36:56] dwells in the body now when a man is
[36:59] converted say just like that little
[37:02] white button starts in his heart
[37:09] now we're gonna read something here
[37:11] that's going I want to see if you
[37:17] believe
[37:22] button starts in his heart now that part
[37:25] is God so where's the little white
[37:28] button in your heart you're so and that
[37:30] part is God right okay
[37:36] everybody with me when he's born again
[37:39] with the Spirit of God God's Spirit
[37:41] dwells in him now as he can let that
[37:45] spirit grow and take out all the roots
[37:58] of bitterness and press God's way
[38:04] through him again he can become back in
[38:07] the same condition that he was when he
[38:10] was in the Garden of Eden now we've got
[38:18] a little problem we've got a little bit
[38:23] of a problem
[38:27] no let back damned well make sure and
[38:30] see it
[38:31] the little white button starts in his
[38:34] heart now that part is God when he's
[38:36] born again with the Spirit of God God's
[38:38] Spirit dwells in him and now as he can
[38:42] let that spirit grow were in you were in
[38:52] your soul that's what he just said let
[38:59] that spirit grow and take out all the
[39:02] roots of bitterness but brother though I
[39:10] always thought that everything went out
[39:13] so much till there was nothing left in
[39:15] the soul with me and God and don't put
[39:21] it to be God having any bitterness so
[39:23] well make sure you understand the story
[39:26] if there's anything in our soul besides
[39:30] God it's me and you that's what I've
[39:34] tried to get you to think about
[39:37] if the new birth is a mystery then
[39:42] here's the mystery here as part of the
[39:44] new birth there's still problems that
[39:51] after you're born again you can have
[39:53] some bitterness don't worry about it
[40:00] hold the point now this flag that button
[40:03] in the other mine and hold on a minute
[40:06] and press God's way through him again he
[40:10] can become into the same condition he
[40:13] was in the Garden of Eden so evident he
[40:16] must not be in the same condition oh
[40:19] okay
[40:20] the brother Dale I thought the the
[40:25] unclean spirit root of evil went out at
[40:30] sanctification right
[40:32] I thought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:37] burn out everything that was liking it
[40:40] is no you don't believe your prophet
[40:48] when he says you're born again it's like
[40:51] a little button and the more you let
[40:54] that grow in there the more it's gonna
[40:57] push you out the root of bitterness not
[40:59] the root of evil not the unclean spirit
[41:02] because God won't drought in an unclean
[41:05] vessel so I want to get that in there
[41:07] before you ever start that computer of
[41:09] my brain of yours thinking and say well
[41:13] he don't I taught it and believe it the
[41:16] Prophet taught it the unclean spirit
[41:18] goes out at sanctification but they
[41:22] steal parts of us left and the Holy
[41:28] Ghost comes in to burn out the rest of
[41:29] us right and put a little button a
[41:34] little white button
[41:38] well far
[41:42] let that spirit grow now is that let
[41:46] that spirit grow what is this message
[41:49] here call the stature of a perfect man
[41:54] which is means the growth right now
[42:00] right now come on
[42:03] listen if Anita will put it right turn
[42:14] stop
[42:15] so now if you're following what I'm
[42:19] saying it's easy to think to follow the
[42:26] upper part of that to think about well
[42:27] god this puts this little bitty thing
[42:30] like a button you know that all of you
[42:33] was kind of yeah yeah I can read faces
[42:36] maybe not smart enough to read it all
[42:39] but you kind of was going along with
[42:42] that but then when I said the Prophet
[42:49] said let that spirit grow well if it's a
[42:54] little button you know the size of a
[42:59] little button there's you growth
[43:01] development
[43:02] there's your stature of a perfect man
[43:05] growing in grace and knowledge as we'll
[43:08] get to in a minute
[43:09] do you believe in that you believe in
[43:12] growing in grace and knowledge you
[43:14] believe in being born again okay go
[43:24] ahead and number seven
[43:29] the uncertain sound priest 1960 1218
[43:33] and yet the man some were down in him
[43:37] some were in him if he could only let
[43:42] that little as I Ellis trated it like a
[43:47] button when a man saved that much of him
[43:53] is God what the little button
[44:03] I really am confused man because I
[44:06] thought when I got the new bird I got it
[44:08] all no no no the Bible says you've got
[44:13] the earnest of your inheritance right
[44:17] we're still in the Bible okay
[44:21] I go straight like a button when a man
[44:25] save that much of him is God
[44:27] that's the little light that comes in in
[44:29] in it comes in to make you quit doing
[44:32] what's wrong oh you mean you need it
[44:38] after you're born again you need
[44:41] something to keep you from doing wrong
[44:46] I'll ask you to go to and get them and
[44:50] listen there's I think it's five or six
[44:53] messages that brother Branham preached
[44:58] that's called doors in doors now he's
[45:07] talking about it and he says there are
[45:08] the new birth he's the born-again
[45:10] Christian doors and doors but he says
[45:14] you've got the doors closed oh you're a
[45:22] Christian you got the doors closed
[45:24] that's what's your profits then he said
[45:26] now you look right in there on the right
[45:28] hand side you know how run around a lot
[45:30] Olivia illustrate he said riding the
[45:32] inside there that heart and soul you
[45:34] know he said you got a little place I
[45:36] call pride well that every bit of that
[45:39] pride merits
[45:40] they went out of me when I got born
[45:41] again that's not what your prophet said
[45:47] well you have made the new birth to be
[45:50] an odd situation to think about but is
[45:53] it the truth whether you like me or not
[45:59] I don't care whether or not this word is
[46:01] right and I try to preach it the way he
[46:03] says it
[46:04] that's where we'll stand then you're
[46:07] gonna have to argue what he says when I
[46:09] just don't believe it
[46:10] well now where did that give you the
[46:12] right to say that what kind of a spirit
[46:16] would it be for you reading brother
[46:18] branham's message to show what happens
[46:21] and you say what does it matter to me I
[46:23] don't care that means that spirit is of
[46:26] the devil oh now you are getting hard on
[46:32] us not hard enough because I ain't
[46:35] cracked about most of you yet you're
[46:38] still sitting looking when it cracks on
[46:43] you you find out and you'll see why it
[46:45] took so long 50 years to preach this
[46:50] message come on
[46:59] as I've Illustrated like a button when a
[47:02] man get man saved that much of him is
[47:05] God
[47:06] that's the little light that comes in to
[47:08] make you quit doing what's wrong now if
[47:12] you can take all the malice I'll tell
[47:17] you what it just bothers me I got
[47:18] righteous indignation but not now is
[47:23] your hatred long church you think all
[47:36] the malice and envy and strife like I
[47:40] said you're not listening you're trying
[47:43] to refute because you're still back
[47:45] there about 15 minutes ago where you
[47:47] said brother Dale you told us that
[47:50] brother Branham says that unclean spirit
[47:52] goes out and the Holy Ghost comes to
[47:56] burn out what's left that's exactly
[47:58] right because right now the Word of God
[48:02] is either cankering in you or me or it's
[48:05] burning out malice Envy strife and time
[48:09] is supposed to be burning out of us now
[48:14] come on but I didn't think I had any
[48:17] that's God you can't tell me not born in
[48:21] this message hallelujah just don't die
[48:30] in it and I don't mean that backwards
[48:34] now I mean it right make it quit doing
[48:38] what's wrong you can take it all the
[48:40] matters that end instruct you mean
[48:42] there's malice envy and strife in a
[48:44] born-again Christian that's what he's
[48:47] saying I mean come on why say something
[48:56] to you go rest Lord gene got no wrong
[48:59] there's a little malice envy and strife
[49:03] there's little things it seems out of
[49:06] there that ain't been took out and like
[49:08] I said if you'll do what I ask
[49:10] you'll see what I'm talking about go get
[49:13] all those messages on doors and doors
[49:16] and see what your prophet said
[49:18] he said you got pride left now here's
[49:21] one that's hard in there I just read it
[49:23] today he said you go inside and look
[49:27] over on the left side maybe something
[49:28] and he said DARS faith he said just
[49:33] don't you make mix with my faith that's
[49:40] what's your prophet said did we say God
[49:42] don't you mix with my faith in other
[49:44] words I believe what I believe I don't
[49:46] care what did it I believe it that's the
[49:49] way I believe it and I'm gonna stay with
[49:51] it my mom said it I'm not against her
[49:53] she said I was born the Baptist and I'll
[49:56] die one well how many people like
[50:02] statements like that but this is what I
[50:06] like the malleus the end of the strife
[50:09] and unbelief out of that little that
[50:11] little button lack of the light and
[50:14] power of God will keep growing growing
[50:17] growing growing can I go back here and
[50:21] say growing growing growing growing
[50:24] growing growing going going glory it's
[50:28] growing growing in grace and knowledge
[50:33] growing crowding out unbelief I think I
[50:38] know one believe
[50:47] okay and you don't do it by expectations
[50:50] ever had that word is enough bodily
[50:53] exercise you do it by sanctified
[50:56] consecrated life that the Holy Spirit
[51:00] moves through you I caught some of you
[51:04] in it this place
[51:05] not long ago no that's just like
[51:09] sanctification the Apostle Paul truly
[51:13] was a born-again Christian right but yet
[51:16] he taught a daily sanctification what
[51:18] far oh that was just out what he done in
[51:20] his spirit oh that just doing it in his
[51:25] spirit prevailed it's just in our spirit
[51:28] where we go wrong I agree with you what
[51:33] the Prophet said it's on the end word
[51:34] man that needs to do the growing you
[51:36] don't grow in your spirit you understand
[51:39] me you don't grow to take away is that
[51:42] it it's got to come out from the inward
[51:45] man and go out orally okay
[52:00] okay Oh Leslie wrote it on the up I
[52:02] think no okay hold on we're on number
[52:06] eight that'll be all right
[52:08] little note the message y61 128 fully
[52:12] don't remember when a man is saved this
[52:17] much like this button here now we
[52:22] already read I three or four he talks
[52:25] about the little button so I mean Lord I
[52:27] know he knows about the little button
[52:31] and look what he says when a man is
[52:34] saved this much like this button here
[52:37] becomes eternal life in your heart
[52:43] that's God and as you're able to push
[52:48] out all the roots of bitterness God then
[52:52] God begins to spread in you then you
[52:56] become a son of God okay he's talking
[53:06] about the image and the hands and the
[53:07] feet and the river what happens what
[53:10] happened because he just believed God
[53:12] God's Word he sent him right back out to
[53:16] shift for himself talking about one of
[53:18] the always wonder about the kingdoms and
[53:20] find Genesis now look now God's trying
[53:23] to bring him back and when you have
[53:26] faith and accept him my brother just let
[53:31] that little lot begin to grow out taking
[53:35] all the roots of doubt and bitterness
[53:38] yielding yourself to the spirit then you
[53:42] begin to become a son of God a daughter
[53:45] of God begin to grow in the grace of God
[53:49] the Holy Spirit begins to build his
[53:52] kingdom within you stature of a perfect
[53:56] man okay
[53:59] number nine go ahead to the neck 1962
[54:06] 624 super time let me tell you anything
[54:11] outside of being born again
[54:14] we'll never reach the rapture so now if
[54:20] we don't have the new borough we're not
[54:22] going in the rapture now whose fault is
[54:26] it if we don't have the new bird we're
[54:31] not going in the rapture I mean is that
[54:37] what he said well you're just quoting it
[54:39] listen unless there is a germ of life
[54:42] inside of you you'll perish
[54:45] you cannot rise up again if you haven't
[54:49] got the germ of life in you this
[54:50] afternoon and you're not a Christian why
[54:53] not you walk right up here nice by here
[54:56] what's he talking about
[54:59] go ahead so what do we actually get when
[55:03] you're born again a little white light
[55:07] the loop spot we call it and it needs to
[55:11] grow now let's read what the scripture
[55:15] says about this new birth now all of
[55:19] these is about the new birth not about
[55:21] just justification or something coming
[55:24] unto this is the new birth 2nd
[55:28] Corinthians 1:22 who also has sealed us
[55:32] and given the earnest of the spirit into
[55:37] our hearts so what do you get when
[55:40] you're born again an earnest what is an
[55:43] earnest a down payment or part payment
[55:45] right do you get the fullness no no you
[55:51] just got the part payment you start okay
[55:54] second Corinthians five and five now he
[55:57] that hath wrought us for the self same
[55:59] thing is God who also hath given unto us
[56:03] the earnest of the Spirit okay keep on
[56:08] going these is 1:13 in whom we also
[56:13] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[56:14] truth the gospel of your salvation and
[56:18] whom also after that you believed you
[56:20] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[56:21] promise now that's your enough to enough
[56:24] to know it's talking about the baptism
[56:25] of the Holy Ghost the seal of God right
[56:27] and what did he say which is the earnest
[56:28] of our inheritance until the redemption
[56:31] of the purchased possession unto the
[56:33] praise of his glory is that Scripture
[56:37] okay
[56:39] we're we in it first Corinthians three
[56:42] and one and two and I brethren could not
[56:45] speak unto you as unto spiritual but as
[56:48] unto carnal even as unto babies in
[56:52] Christ I have fed you with milk and not
[56:57] with meat for hitherto you were not able
[57:00] to bear it neither yet now are you able
[57:05] are we able to bear it can we follow
[57:09] that do we get our feelings hurt no some
[57:14] don't go our way
[57:18] come on go ahead to the minute Hebrews 5
[57:24] 11 or 14 of whom we have many things to
[57:27] say he's telling me Oh charity and hard
[57:30] to be uttered seeing you're dull of
[57:31] hearing Christians dull of hearing for
[57:36] when the time you ought to be teachers
[57:39] you need that one teach you again which
[57:42] be the first principles of the Oracles
[57:44] of God and our our become such as how
[57:48] need of milk and not of strong meat
[58:00] wherever one that uses milk is
[58:02] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[58:04] for he is a baby with strong meat
[58:09] belongeth to them that are a full age
[58:12] even those who by reason of use have
[58:15] their senses exercised to discern both
[58:19] good and evil
[58:21] what about it over the next what do we
[58:26] got first Peter 1:22 and 23 we will pick
[58:30] this up next to it I mean this weekend
[58:33] seeing ye are purified your souls and
[58:36] obeying the truth through the spirit
[58:38] under unfeigned the love of the Brethren
[58:40] see that you love one another with a
[58:42] pure heart fervently being born again
[58:47] not of corruptible seed but of
[58:49] incorruptible how by the Word of God
[58:53] which liveth and abideth forever how can
[58:56] we ever do it see there was no one ever
[58:59] table I'm gonna say this and you've what
[59:00] are you like it or not alright no one
[59:03] would have been capable of attaining to
[59:04] the statue of a perfect man had brother
[59:06] Adam not come I've said that from day
[59:11] one I still say it and brother branham
[59:14] not come no one could have reached the
[59:17] statue of a perfect man and listen plain
[59:20] language he could not have done it
[59:23] himself unless he was a prophet that the
[59:28] Word of God could come to to teach him
[59:31] how to climb that pyramid I'll do that
[59:36] myself but I'm talking about the man
[59:40] that brought us this message we have the
[59:46] message we just need to believe it
[59:51] what we're doing do we get it all one
[59:58] more quote we'll finish it
[1:00:00] go to number 19 let back up to that and
[1:00:03] back up I got back I'm back I'm back we
[1:00:05] missed one back up there's one scripture
[1:00:09] now if we're laying aside all malice oh
[1:00:12] why did now no matters the Prophet says
[1:00:15] you have malice we need to let it grow
[1:00:17] get rid of the malice right wherefore
[1:00:20] laying aside all malice and all guile
[1:00:23] opened the doors of our heart doors
[1:00:28] endures an envious and the evil
[1:00:31] speakings what as newborn babies desire
[1:00:40] the sincere milk of the word that you
[1:00:42] may grow thereby
[1:00:43] newborn babies we start as babies we
[1:00:50] started in the body of Christ as babies
[1:00:53] I tried to tell you over the years why
[1:00:56] only death pentecost 120 in the Upper
[1:00:59] Room and the Holy Ghost come on to them
[1:01:01] and brother Branham said they had these
[1:01:03] virtues but they didn't have the
[1:01:05] headstone now we'll get back to that so
[1:01:08] the disciples had these virtues but the
[1:01:10] 3,000 outside received the new birth
[1:01:13] only his faith because they could not
[1:01:15] talk the Word of God they only heard one
[1:01:20] message listen he what there's life's
[1:01:26] one okay we'll go to that go to 19 no
[1:01:33] less in chapter 5 part 261 618 I got
[1:01:38] some scriptures and comments and so
[1:01:39] forth
[1:01:40] wrote down here now in Ephesians 1:13 14
[1:01:44] if you want to write it down that we
[1:01:47] have now the earnest the Holy Spirit is
[1:01:51] the earnest of our inheritance the new
[1:01:57] birth is an earnest
[1:02:01] in other words listen the Holy Spirit is
[1:02:06] the earnest of our inheritance
[1:02:09] it is the assurance the earnest is the
[1:02:12] assurance the downpayment
[1:02:14] that we have been received on into
[1:02:17] Christ it is the Blessed hope and
[1:02:20] instance insurance ever I guess that's
[1:02:24] interesting okay
[1:02:25] look at the inside way that we do have
[1:02:29] eternal life and our heirs of everything
[1:02:33] that he purchased for us
[1:02:35] oh my and you see it what is the next
[1:02:40] one start on Sunday Romans 8 Romans 8
[1:02:48] what is it heirs and joint heirs with
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ see I'm not against people
[1:03:01] in there talking to me about their
[1:03:03] experiences what I'm against is when
[1:03:07] those things riled up that don't work
[1:03:09] out too good now I'm gonna read this got
[1:03:12] I wrote it down so I read my own notes I
[1:03:15] would have given you a copy but you
[1:03:16] couldn't read it I would have to tell
[1:03:19] you what it say it sister Johnny one
[1:03:22] times he said let me take all of your
[1:03:24] messages and type them in the computer
[1:03:26] so I've got every message that I've ever
[1:03:28] preached every grace was looking at me
[1:03:31] like what puppy I got a tote like this
[1:03:34] in every sermon that I've ever preached
[1:03:36] I got two notes so you want to know what
[1:03:39] a priest in a 50 60 s 7 is that I'm
[1:03:42] loyal in the 70
[1:03:44] I've got him but I told her I said what
[1:03:48] would be any good I just have to move
[1:03:50] into your home and tell you what I say
[1:03:52] it and let you top it off okay now
[1:03:56] listen now here's where we started some
[1:04:01] believe that you're born again when you
[1:04:04] believe
[1:04:04] all right justification or even
[1:04:06] sanctification some people believe that
[1:04:08] whereas others believe you are not born
[1:04:12] again until you receive the capstone or
[1:04:14] headstone
[1:04:15] and the pyramid of love that's the vast
[1:04:18] difference between what a lot of people
[1:04:20] believe one believes here one believed
[1:04:22] here somewhere in between
[1:04:23] I can't see neither of these is to be
[1:04:27] right okay but there is a way but I do
[1:04:36] believe that you can be justified by
[1:04:40] believing on Jesus Christ and to even to
[1:04:44] also be sanctified and if that is
[1:04:47] genuine justification and sanctification
[1:04:49] are truly so that if you die in that
[1:04:54] state you will go to heaven and receive
[1:04:59] eternal life at the great white throne
[1:05:02] which means you are not in the body are
[1:05:05] broad you're not in the kingdom at
[1:05:09] justification and sanctification you are
[1:05:14] believing unto but do not possess the
[1:05:19] new birth but I believe when you are
[1:05:22] truly born again you are in the kingdom
[1:05:25] of God with eternal life but you are
[1:05:29] waiting the adoption you are a son of
[1:05:35] God by the new birth when you're born
[1:05:38] it's like a natural collagen you know by
[1:05:41] new birth you're born in the body of
[1:05:43] Christ your son of God okay but not
[1:05:47] positioned in the body like you will be
[1:05:50] at the completion of the adoption
[1:05:54] brother Brandon what outside of this day
[1:05:58] I'm quoting in perforates but he says
[1:06:01] what outside of this day is he said
[1:06:02] about the manifestation of sons and
[1:06:04] daughters of God outside of this age cuz
[1:06:07] everything is waiting on this age okay I
[1:06:10] believe you are born again at the place
[1:06:14] on the pyramid call faith then you must
[1:06:19] grow up into him which is the headship
[1:06:22] see then you are born again by the new
[1:06:26] birth see if you're born again a new
[1:06:28] body
[1:06:29] faith and you can be can be baptized
[1:06:33] into the body for gifts because that's
[1:06:36] what your prophet said because I believe
[1:06:38] you you're born again but he said in
[1:06:41] you're baptized into the body for gifts
[1:06:43] that's true that's adoption they see
[1:06:47] then it that that like you have truly
[1:06:50] been accepted of God it'll come a day
[1:06:54] that we're truly accepted of God I
[1:06:57] believe that looking forward to that day
[1:07:01] when he can say well done good and
[1:07:03] faithful servant enter into the joys of
[1:07:07] the Lord aren't you looking for that
[1:07:10] come on musicians let's do you got done
[1:07:14] quicker than I thought okay now you go
[1:07:16] outside for an hour and a half and talk
[1:07:19] about where I so wrong and what I said
[1:07:23] was wrong
[1:07:24] just just remember one thing what we say
[1:07:29] his own record its own record and we'll
[1:07:38] give account of the record brother
[1:07:42] Brennan said one person in a church into
[1:07:46] that church he said you will answer for
[1:07:48] it well you say where are you trying to
[1:07:52] scare me no no don't worry about it it's
[1:07:56] not made to be a scare tactic it's made
[1:07:58] to be a soul saving I'm trying to save
[1:08:01] your soul not scare you
[1:08:07] let's just be careful what you say let
[1:08:12] me say it this way and let it go is it
[1:08:19] not true that the order of events is
[1:08:22] supposed to be that if you have a
[1:08:25] problem you are supposed to go to that
[1:08:30] person to work out that problem if you
[1:08:31] can't but now it's not right for a woman
[1:08:37] to go to a man and straighten him out
[1:08:39] whether he be preacher or not you're in
[1:08:45] danger of God because you're not
[1:08:50] supposed to do it you're supposed to go
[1:08:51] to your husband
[1:08:52] this is prophets words let your husband
[1:08:56] go to the pastor or whatever and then I
[1:09:00] can say something about it you can
[1:09:04] bypass a lot of it and don't say nothing
[1:09:06] but be careful just don't get yourself
[1:09:10] in trouble with God because you don't
[1:09:12] agree with what's they come to me bring
[1:09:16] your husband then come to me our
[1:09:20] husbands you don't have to bring your
[1:09:21] wife you come yourself let's talk it
[1:09:25] over because I believe I've told you the
[1:09:30] truth and see then that's the danger
[1:09:34] part is when we think we can straighten
[1:09:38] out these things you know yourself what
[1:09:42] I'm saying is right the woman isn't a
[1:09:45] never-to-be
[1:09:46] just straighten out the man well hi you
[1:09:50] mean I can't straight my girl go to the
[1:09:52] pastor and let him deal with now for a
[1:09:58] woman to say something to a minister
[1:10:00] about what they preached you're in
[1:10:04] danger with God
[1:10:05] that's as well as I can say it in love
[1:10:09] and respect to everyone we bring down
[1:10:15] nation up and on her own sale
[1:10:16] I love that in the communion where it
[1:10:20] tells you about those times and says not
[1:10:23] discerning the Lord's body the Lord's
[1:10:26] body is his people in his word you've
[1:10:32] heard me mention some of these brothers
[1:10:34] that have left but I had ever write to
[1:10:37] as pastor to tear them to pieces with
[1:10:40] the Word of God but I've never done it
[1:10:44] what they've done is their business
[1:10:47] that's their choice
[1:10:51] yeah see but I am responsible to the
[1:10:56] tale the truth and if you don't like it
[1:11:00] either way like I said then I'm not your
[1:11:02] passenger but you see you want to come
[1:11:06] that's the way my family is that's
[1:11:07] pretty good

[1:11:10] word but let one of them get sick right

[1:11:18] come across railroad track yeah don't
[1:11:21] you pray farm well that's good I don't

[1:11:35] have if we have a need of somewhere to
[1:11:37] go to our neighbor I mean go to our
