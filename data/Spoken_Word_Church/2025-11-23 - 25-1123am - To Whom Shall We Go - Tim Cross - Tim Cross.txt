TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the way you feel this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoicing coming to the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; for renewing in life and joy and peace. And I always pray sometimes I struggle a lot and I have to get things right with the Lord and ask him to return unto me the joy of thy salvation. That's one of my lines that I love to use from the scripture that he's given us to make it through this life. That's our sword that we use against the one that takes away our joy. And usually it's us that give him the arrows to take it away. &gt;&gt; So I'm just thankful to be here today. And it's good to see all these smiling faces, these beautiful smiling faces. If y'all seen what I seen, you'd love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. Anyway, let's uh we're going to be reading from Deuteromy 33-16 today. And uh before we go to the author, let's just give him thanks. &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, we thank you for this day you've given us to come and gather around your word. What a beautiful day it is. A beautiful fall day. And father, as the little brother brought this morning about the rest, what a rest, Lord. Oh, what a rest we're looking for in this life, in this word, Lord. That if you can just get this word in us that we can we can manifest it like we should, Lord, and this bride can come to our fruition as she's supposed to come to, Lord, all these things will be done. But, Father, in your time and you're in charge, and we must be patient and take your word a little, here a little, there a little, as your prophet said. We ask now, Father, that you'd bless all those that couldn't make it through the door. whatever their hindrance is, just bless them and be with them. And father, thank you for the wonderful conversation I had with brother Collie this morning. It was so beautiful and so timely, Lord, that he called me and talked to me this morning all the way to church. He misses us. And Father, we he's here with us. &gt;&gt; He and brother Dy and all the other ones that can't be here, Lord, just bless them and be with us. And Father, we ask now that you bless the reading of the word here today and bless all our children that's out in the world there, Father. Just be with each one of them. Thank you for the things you've given us in our lives, Lord, that we don't have any problems. All we got to do is trust in you. You'll just give us all we need. We know that, Father. So, let us reach out, Father, with open hands and take your word, Lord. We ask these things in your precious name, Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's see. Okay, here we go. They got it fixed. That's good. Deuteronomy 30, we're starting at three. Then that the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whether the Lord thy God has scattered thee. From the Lord thy God, and then he fetch thee. And the Lord thy God will bring thee unto the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it, and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God, to love the thy God, with all thy heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live. &gt;&gt; And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee, which persecute thee, &gt;&gt; thou shalt return the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments. And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thy hand, in every fruit of thy body, in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fruit of thy land for good. For the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers. unord. &gt;&gt; For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it. &gt;&gt; Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shalt say, Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it? word in thy mouth and thy heart thou mayest do it. See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil. &gt;&gt; And to command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it.

I had a little time to spend with my dad yesterday. just a little bit, you know, and you know, my dad is definitely older now. And anytime he gets around believers, even around the family, his grandkids, he he'll cry. My dad never cried. My dad was not a crier. You that generation, they didn't cry. They didn't tell you they love you. You just saw it. But he cries all the time. You get around believers, you see, he cries. And it's a deep cry because I know he knows.

But we go through seasons, but thank God it's just a season. We were we were singing about the sun never go down. This morning I was looking online. There's a city in Alaska that the sun &gt;&gt; the sun went down today &gt;&gt; and will not come up until after January the 20some. no sunlight. &gt;&gt; We're not going to that place &gt;&gt; physically physically up there or or in the new city because it'll always be sunshine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never be a cloudy day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We can't understand that, but we will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The old song says we'll understand it what better &gt;&gt; by and by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By and by when the morning comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And all the saints will be gathered home. Well, we've gathered today to hear our brother. Uh he's no stranger, brother Tim Cross. We've known him for a long long time. Appreciate his ministry and we appreciate him and uh he's going to come and he'll sing maybe a song or two for us and and play the piano. So let's let's sing holy words long preserved &gt;&gt; for this walk in this world. &gt;&gt; Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words of life. Words of hope. It gives us strength and helps us cope. In this world, wherever we roll, the word of God guide us home. Sing it to him.

Amen. and God bless you this morning and greet you in the name of the Lord. You can be seated if you'd like and just say it's a privilege to be with you again and uh to see you still gathering and pressing the battle fighting the good fight of faith and looking for the coming of the Lord. And uh we are just honored to be with you today and bring you greetings from my wife and family in the ble just a little north of the border there. And uh we're also amen gathering uh encouraged and revived as we look for the coming of the Lord. Amen. So, Brother Wade, I think had expected to be away this morning deer hunting and getting a little break and called me yesterday and told me he was heading on back. Got rained on for three days and said it'd be better to hear me preach than have to sit in a treeand and be rained on. So, Amen. So, uh, we appreciate what I see the Lord doing here in this body of believers. And I know God has called his servant, Brother Samuel Holm. But God had another vessel waiting and ready for God to work through and minister to your needs. And so, uh, we're just here this morning to put our shoulder to the wheel with that. And, uh, trust the Lord can use us in some way to be a blessing to you. So, I'm going to step over to the piano and maybe we just uh play a special or sing and let's just worship the Lord together. that you know I was coming over uh from the hotel this morning. I got up to my turn and there was a big long train blocking the way and uh I went on down and it dead ended. So I made a 180 and came back up and traveled on past and uh thank the Lord I passed a white Suburban with a sister driving that I recognized and I said, "You know what? I believe I can follow her from here and uh and and get to the other side of the tracks. Amen. So, thank God there's a there's believers that know the way. &gt;&gt; And uh you don't have to know the way. If you know who does, you can just follow them. &gt;&gt; Uh but um I pray the Lord will bless you this morning. See if I can sing a little song that's on my heart. I make no claims on being a singer, but uh we're all worshippers. Amen. So just worship the Lord from your heart. Be in the key of Fat. Empty and broken, I came back to him. A vessel unworthy and so scarred by sin. But he did not despair. He started over again. And I bless the day. He didn't throw the clay away. Over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the clay a vessel of honor. I am today. All because he didn't throw the clay away. He is the potter and I am the clay. Holded in his image. That's how he wants me to stay. When I stumble, when I fall, when my vessel breaks, he just picks up those pieces. He doesn't throw the clay away. Aren't you thankful? Over and over, he molds me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the clay. Oh vessel of honor I am today. All because he doesn't throw the crap away. A vessel of I am today. All because Jesus doesn't throw the Amen. I know that is true. Amen. I'm not just singing a song someone else wrote. I know that to be the truth this morning. Amen. If you'd like to stand with me, I invite you to turn in your Bibles to St. John chapter 6. I'm going to read um two verses or three verses of scripture here. Then we'll um ask the Lord's will will uh will you can be seated. Before we read these verses, um let's just go to him once more in prayer. You know, you may think that you're just here this morning, but it's more than that. &gt;&gt; Every time we gather, he promised to be here. &gt;&gt; And I could think I'm just here this morning, but it's more than that. He's here &gt;&gt; and he can speak to your heart, your life, your need, your situation and he can take me completely off of anything I might have prepared to say to tell you exactly what you need to hear and to today could be the turning point and I believe it will be the turning point in your life for him to reveal to you his how great and how much his abilities surpass our inabilities. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have given us the privilege to gather again this morning, Lord, and to enter into the divine promise where you agreed that to meet with us. And we are inviting you now, Lord. And we believe that the songs have been sung, the prayers have been offered, and all of the preparation, the effort has been put forth, Lord, to make what will now take place possible. But we also realize Lord our inability Lord as a minister, as a speaker, as a person Lord I I could not know what is needed or even how to speak to that Lord. But I surrender my vessel to you in full assurance, Lord, that you know and that you are present, Lord, to take your word and minister it to our hearts and meet the needs that are in our lives today and the needs that we'll encounter, Lord, as we move along and progress in our Christian journey. And we're asking you, Lord, to now come and meet with us. reveal yourself in such a way that it would dissolve all doubt, would dismiss all unbelief and it would change our lives Lord as you desire to change us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask it. Amen. Amen. St. John chapter 6, let's begin reading at verse number 67. Then said Jesus unto the 12, will ye also go away? And Simon Peter answered him,"Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God." May the Lord bless the reading of his word. And you can be seated. I will uh invite you to hold your place there in the scriptures because we want to look back at some of the earlier verses leading up to this uh to establish the context of this scripture. But this question that Peter asked and I was thinking this morning um in looking at the way the gospels and the way the New Testament uh paints us a picture of this character of Peter, he seems like he was a he was kind of an outspoken person. uh like he was very responsive and very reactive and be maybe like myself sometimes before really thinking about it. He would just say what was the first thing that came to his mind. But and so I I thought I wonder how many things Peter said that never got captured in the scriptures. We'll just never know unless the Lord would reveal it. But even though Peter seemed to say things that would embarrass him or embarrass the Lord Jesus, things that Jesus had to correct, they were still worthy of being placed in God's word &gt;&gt; because I believed the Lord knew we would have the same questions. We would have the same tendencies. Whether it would be Peter, Thomas or others we see in the Bible, God let their words go into his Bible &gt;&gt; to be immortalized for our benefit. &gt;&gt; And so I will say this just in the beginning. I don't believe that Peter's question was born out of frustration. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't think Peter uh I don't think he said this because he felt it it was just hopeless and that you know he had spent everything he had given everything he although we know Peter had fully invested himself into Jesus' life and ministry. I don't believe it was just a frustrated question. Lord, to whom shall we go like that, but I believe it was as much of a statement as it was a question. &gt;&gt; It was a sincere question, but it was also a statement, which is different than a question. And so uh it it immortalized Peter really as a true disciple that would not meet with the same fate as others who were still in that group of 12. There was at least one there who would go all the way to the communion service before he actually defected or before it became evident and apparent that he although he was called of God and given a part in Jesus ministry he was not a true disciple in the same way that Peter and the 11 others were. All right. So, uh, you're very quiet this morning. And, uh, I I really, in preparing this morning, I thought, Lord, why this message and why this thought? And I know that you have a good pastor who is a good teacher. And maybe it would seem like I'm in a mode of teaching this morning or sharing from the scriptures, but I I just believe that if if a a minister can be surrendered, God can use him however he wishes. And I also believe that if there's a need here, if if you need teaching, God can teach. If you need evangelism, God can evangelize. Whatever your need is, God can use a yielded vessel in that way to meet that need even in the next uh 60 or so minutes. So, um God just has a way of doing that. So, I would like to back up here to get the context. Let's move uh into verse number 57 of of John, St. John chapter 6 and let's catch what's happening here. Jesus is speaking to the du the Jews who are having a difficult time understanding what he's been telling them. &gt;&gt; And we're just going to break in at verse 57. And he says, "As the living father hath sent me and I live by the father, so he that eateth me even he shall live by me." Right? &gt;&gt; Jesus is showing them I am only here and the only uh the only thing that enables what you're seeing displayed is the life of God. Uh my life is an expression of God's desire to reveal his life. &gt;&gt; All right? And he says uh but he but he's not just keeping that in himself. He's saying if you're going to live as I live by his life, you are going to live by the life that I give to you. &gt;&gt; All right? Which is a um it it's a I don't want to say it, it's adding to or it's it's elaborating, if you will, it's an escalation of what was shown in the Old Testament through natural types. All right. Israel was called out of Egypt. They were uh people that were slaves. They were almost in a subhuman category. Uh they weren't entitled to anything. They were they were servants of Pharaoh and the and the nation of Egypt. But God called those people out of Egypt. And and God was sustaining them along the journey with everything they had need of. He was revealing himself to them as Jehovah Gyra. Whatever their needs were, he was revealing himself as the source or as a supply. So if they needed the waters of the Red Sea to open, the waters of the Red Sea opened. If they needed mana from heaven, mana from heaven. If they needed water from the rock, water the the rock opened and water came out. So God was God was showing his relationship, amen, to humanity, amen, to a people, amen, that were just nothing to the world. But they were because God had made a promise to Abraham that he was going to do this to his seed. Israel was experiencing that now in this journey. So Jesus is showing them uh that he on another level is the fulfillment of what that was typing using very natural people, natural obstacles, natural challenges. Uh it was spiritual too but it was expressing itself in a very natural way. And so as he had given Israel life, then naturally he's showing, amen, that the very life he lived would become the life of the convert. Amen. The the New Testament believer, the sons and daughters of God, we're going to live by his life the same as he lived by the life of God. &gt;&gt; This is we're in verse 58. This is that bread which came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. &gt;&gt; So saying this is different. &gt;&gt; This is on another level. It's greater. &gt;&gt; They ate it. They died. &gt;&gt; Friends, not just Israelites ate it. Janice and Jambers ate it. Cor and Dayathan ate it. I mean, there was all kinds of people who parttook of the supernatural, but never had the faith to go all the way into Canaan and to enjoy the benefit of why God sent a prophet. They died in their unbelief. They perished. They circled the mountain. They were called up. You know, I I I think this and I I say this, you know, we're living in an hour when it seems like there's more defection or more apostasy than there's ever been in our own ranks. But don't forget Joshua and Caleb prevailed. The 1,999,998 other believers. &gt;&gt; Fell away. &gt;&gt; Joshua, it never deterred or discouraged Joshua or Caleb in the least. &gt;&gt; They were overcomers and they were going to overcome. It didn't matter how many fell away. Didn't matter what took place in that interim between Egypt and Canaan, Joshua and Caleb were going to prevail. Amen. And they saw a whole new generation of overcomers rise up and they encourage their faith. Amen. So that's what we are today as true believers of God. You know, u all that happens, it saddens us. It it should never bring us any joy or or satisfaction to see people falling away. But it's not going to change what God has deposited in our hearts, in our lives. Amen. All we have ever seen in the truth that God has revealed is who we are. &gt;&gt; Is where we belong. And that's not in Egypt. And that's not somewhere in between. That's fully occupying every part of God's promise for our lives. And you will not stop short of that. You cannot stop short of that because something is drawing you. There's a power greater than you that's pulling you to be the fulfillment or the vindication of God's word for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he say, "Not as your fathers didn't eat man and are dead. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever." And these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernium. Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard thing. Who can hear it? Who can hear it? That's quite a question. Who can hear it? Who can really comprehend &gt;&gt; what he's now saying? And Jesus had said hard things before. Jesus had said things that didn't make sense and and there had already been a falling away. But now here closer in, you know, this wasn't just the the riffraff. &gt;&gt; This was closer to that inner circle. Who can hear it? Now the Bible says, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches." &gt;&gt; And brother Benham talks about and he says, you know, there's a prophetic class of people. &gt;&gt; It really differentiates the true overcomer from just anybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got a tuned hearing or you've got an ability to hear something that goes beyond the vessel, &gt;&gt; the person or the personality or even the ministry itself. As far, you know, uh, and here I go. I'm getting off track, but but that's okay. I I saw there was a brother that um printed some of the news articles. You you y'all are familiar with when the pillar of fire appeared uh over brotherham's head in Houston, Texas. That was a debate that had been organized and brother Bosworth and a man named Dr. Best were going to debate the scriptures and debate divine healing because the Baptist denomination had closed the door on the prospect or even the idea that divine healing was still ongoing after the last disciple died. &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it. They believed it was uh they believed it was superstition. They believed it was mental telepathy. They believed it was something manufactured. They they they didn't believe there was any authenticity to it whatsoever. And this was a prevailing belief amongst denominational believers who believe the Bible, who believed Jesus Christ is God and believed in a new birth and all of these things, but they did not believe in divine healing. So, uh, brother brother, uh, brother Bosworth had agreed to take this man on in a in a debate. And well the debate ended very quickly because he said did the redemptive or did the names the seven redemptive names of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ which of course they did. And so as there was salvation in that atonement there was also healing in that atonement. It's irrefutable and ir uh inseparable. So that ended the debate and then brother Benham comes up there and uh he begins to address the audience and the pillar of fire appeared and the man who had taken what six or seven pictures or so of Dr. uh best shaking his finger in Dr. Bossworth's face. None of those developed, &gt;&gt; but the picture of the pillar of fire did. &gt;&gt; But but what most people, and I didn't know this until I began to read that, uh, you know, this was back in an era when revival made the news. &gt;&gt; This was back in the era when tent meetings and those types of things would come out on the front page of the paper. That's what actually made headlines was the revival. And so in Houston, there were two or three magazines or two or three newspapers that carried on the front page of their of their paper headlines dealing with this uh convention. And I didn't know this. And brother Ben never says one thing about it, but the the controversy was so heated that there was actually a fist fight that broke out between I think it was a Baptist minister and a Pentecostal minister. They were they were they were throwing fists. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, that is representative of the spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The conflict that was going on. Because while there are preachers up there swinging fists at each other, there's people lying on CS, stretchers, beyond what medicine, beyond what science, beyond what anything man, and even the wisdom God has given the medical world. They were beyond what science or medicine could do for them. lying there in a condition only God could change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're there in that building. They're there in that auditorium while preachers, Amen, religious leaders are fighting it out whether these scriptures even mean what they claim they mean. &gt;&gt; And in all of that, God moved. The pillar of fire appeared. God authenticated his prophet. And God wasn't just authenticating a man. God was authenticating his own word and saying, "If you will believe this, if you will accept this, if you will cling to this, if you will focus on this and look to this, you can get up off that cot. You can get off that stretcher. You can be healed. You can be miraculously transformed. Amen. If you can believe this, amen, and you can prevail over whatever unbelief, amen, is around you, you can be changed." &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not even just a possibility. It became a reality. There were people that were healed. There were people that got up off those CS and stretchers. And there were people, amen, who came through healing and salvation because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It was true then and it's true today. But you can see there's a great conflict. Amen. There's a great battle. It's going on even this morning while I'm here preaching this. there's a there's a devil trying to sit on your shoulder and say, "Well, it's all true, but it's not for you, you know, and all this all this is right, but you know, you're you're under this umbrella or this uh cloud of unbelief that is going to try to hold you captive." Amen. Until you can dismiss it long enough to say, "No, I'm going to believe God's word. I know that's true and I know it's for me and I'm going to step into it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't hard saying who can hear it. And when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, "Do this offend you?" And watch, he doesn't say, "I'm sorry. I'll back up." He doesn't say, "Let me let me rephrase this. Let me see if I can let me see if I can uh present it to you in a way that's more palatable or digestible. I I I don't want you to leave. He doesn't do that. &gt;&gt; Does this offend you? What and if he shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before? &gt;&gt; What if this ministry becomes more mysterious? &gt;&gt; Jesus uh I love something. I've heard my father-in-law say this. It's true. God is always on the increase &gt;&gt; and truly God is unchanging but the way he reveals himself is always increasing and escalating. &gt;&gt; So our understanding and our comprehension realization and the revelation that God is imparting to us is always on the increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus isn't backing up, but he's saying, "What if you what if you hang around? What if you remain with me &gt;&gt; and see this become even more &gt;&gt; mysterious to the carnal mind &gt;&gt; and to the unbeliever." &gt;&gt; Jesus gave them every reason they had to unbelief. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, I don't believe that." Well, they came to Jesus and asked him, "How long dust thou make us to disbelieve? They credited him with making them &gt;&gt; not believe." &gt;&gt; And in fact, they weren't wrong. The more he did, the less they believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The more he said, the less they believed. He started out with a supernatural signs and wonders ministry, healing the sick, raising the dead, uh, multiplying the loaves and the fishes. That attracted a large multitude of believers. But then he mo moved into a mode that thinned that crowd and sent and dispersed many of those who were only attracted to the surface of his ministry went back to the council, back to the temple, back to the synagogue, back to their former way of life because there was nothing deposited on the inside of them to draw them into his ministry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And friends, that is so today also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before verse 63, it is the spirit that quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit. and they are life. Uh I looked this phrase up this morning because I wanted to understand better what he meant when he said the flesh profitth nothing. And there's there's a number of ways that can be understood. Um one is um without the spirit the flesh is worthless or or will never become anything. And that's true. It takes the spirit of God to quicken your flesh. Amen. Or otherwise you'll remain in your sin. &gt;&gt; Uh I also believe that because we are born in sin, shaped iniquity, coming into the world, speaking lies. There's always an element of this flesh that we're going to have to contend with. We're going to have to keep covered in prayer. It's going to have to be atoned by the blood of Jesus Christ. And only until you are glorified in the rapture. Amen. Will that leave you and no longer afflict you. Amen. But I I think it I'm just going to present this as a possibility. I think it also dealt with Jesus own ministry. As long as he was there in a body of flesh, that was going in some ways to hinder their faith. &gt;&gt; Because they were going to attach to the man &gt;&gt; instead of what was greater, &gt;&gt; which was the spirit of God or the word of God which made the man possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to substantiate that, I'll take you to the Emmas road. &gt;&gt; After his resurrection, he didn't let them actually comprehend who they were talking to. He held their eyes. He withheld their their actual their five senses from recognizing who he was. And instead of tell showing them nail scars and instead of performing miracles, instead of uh giving them some inclination or some hint that he was that same Jesus, he took them to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Don't the scriptures say this? Didn't Moses say this? Didn't David say this? Don't the Psalms Don't Didn't Isaiah say this? He bound their faith to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and the and the Bible said their heart, Amen. That wasn't their flesh realm. That wasn't even their spirit realm altogether. Their heart begin to burn within them. Their heart, Amen, the that the the the inner person, that soul realm, Amen, began to be to to be ignited by the word. Amen. And they and then they recognize the same circumstances that made us lose our confidence and lose our ability to hold on to him as our Lord and Savior and King. Amen. The trial, the scourging, the mocking, all of those things, all of those circumstances, amen, that was weakening their confidence in who he was was actually the fulfillment of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; They weakened Peter. &gt;&gt; They weakened the other disciples. I think everyone but John and Mary actually fled the Lord Jesus, forsook him. Amen. And Peter was one of those. But when Jesus arose and instead of showing them his body or starting off with the the nails and the wounds and all of those things that their natural eyes could behold, he took them to the scriptures and he was proving that their faith and confidence would not be anchored in a person but in the revelation of the word. Amen. and he took him and and and brother, they weren't going to leave this stranger. &gt;&gt; And they were not going to let him leave them. When they got into the home, they said, "Abide with us." They didn't even know who he was, but they knew there was something about him that they didn't want to let go of. So they said, "Abide with us. It's just evening time. Come inside." And when the door was closed and they sat down at the table, then their eyes were open. When he broke the bread &gt;&gt; the way he had done it before, their eyes were opened. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they knew him. &gt;&gt; Oh my friend. Then he had revealed himself to them in a way they would never deny him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then they didn't necessarily need him there as a man in flesh. &gt;&gt; At that point, their faith had been anchored to something even greater. Amen. And that would take them after his ascension to the upper room. Amen. where his very life would quicken them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, so I I believe that's captured in that phrase, the flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, they are life. Now Jesus words aren't that to everybody. &gt;&gt; Many hear the word and it does nothing for them. In many cases, it makes them more accountable for their unbelief and it brings them under judgment. &gt;&gt; But you've heard me talk about, I know I've preached on it maybe twice here, um, sympathetic resonance, how things begin to ring out upon hearing the sound of the note they are tuned to. So that shows you there are there's something within the predestinated believer that when the word is spoken or when it's heard by that believer, it begins to quicken something on the inside of them. Amen. That also begins to echo that or begins to sound that out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone used this uh uh recently. They were talking about sympathetic resonance and they said, you know, if those tuning forks, the one is struck and the other one begins to sound upon just hearing it. It doesn't have to be struck. It just hears it. It comes within the sound. They said, then the first one can be muted &gt;&gt; and the other one won't stop sounding. Amen. It's already amened or been quickened by that sounding. So even if the even if you take that first one and you can do whatever you want to with it, the other one's going to keep sounding out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. But verse 64, but there are some of you that believe not even in these few remaining. You see friends, I I don't like having to say this, but in Jesus own life and ministry, we see how there was a pairing down. There was a great multitude initially and it kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller till it was distilled or concentrated to only 120. &gt;&gt; And then they went into the upper room. And then when God descended in the form of the Holy Spirit and quickened them to the same life that had lived in Christ, then the church began to grow. &gt;&gt; Then the church began to multiply. Then you see the outburst or the that that great uh birth of the church there at Pentecost. There are some of you that believe not. Verse 64. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed him and who should betray him. And he said, "Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come to me except it were given unto him of my father." That's a powerful statement. &gt;&gt; But that is a sobering realization. That is a sobering truth that not only Jesus recognized, but every one of us has to come to that same recognition. And it won't make you arrogant, haughty, or proud or any of those things. It will make you appreciate the only way I could have ever actually heard this and believed it and been transformed by it is God's grace, mercy, and favor shown to me. Amen. Uh to allow me to be a part of what he is doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Therefore said unto you that no man can come unto me." I I I feel like I come through here so regularly. I I I at the risk of sounding like a broken record, but uh I just have to be me and I could only preach what the Lord has shown me. But it's so powerful to me how in Genesis, the Bible talks about God laid Adam in a deep sleep and he took a part of Adam from Adam and formed that part of Adam into Mrs. Adam. And the Bible says the Lord the the rib that the Lord had taken from man formed he into a woman and brought her to the man. &gt;&gt; God had to bring the feminine expression of Adam back to Adam. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying that in St. John 665. No man can come unto me. You can't come back to him unless you came from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can reach him is for God to have formed you from him and lead you back to him. &gt;&gt; Now, when you get there, you will understand why God sent this message. &gt;&gt; You will be a message believer because God has revealed to you the message. And and and friends, now I'm uh now I'm winging it, but God does not no true message believer is an attachment to this message. &gt;&gt; No message, no true message believer is someone that heard it said, you know what? That is more right than the Baptist. That's more right than the pent. That's more right than Jehovah's Witness. That's more right. You know, that makes more sense than anything I've ever heard before. I'm going to believe that and follow that. Being a true message believer is more than that. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. When you really hear this message, you're going to recognize that's who I am &gt;&gt; and that's who I've been all along. &gt;&gt; And I could never answer. Amen. That's why nothing else ever made sense to me or produced in my life what this message has produced. You are the message and the message in you, the message is Christ. But Christ is not a singular person or being. Amen. He is a family. He is a is a groom and a bride. Amen. And he has expressed himself in the earth as a family of people and those children or those attributes of God upon hearing the word of God. Amen. Are awakened to the realization. Amen. And his life begins to form itself within you. Amen. And you are drawn into him by the power of the Holy Spirit. It is an irreversible and invincible process. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "All that the Father hath given me will come unto me, and no man shall put them out of my hand." No man, no past, no circumstance, no sickness, no condition, no sin, no unbelief. There is nothing that can separate you from God. If you are a part of God, you are going to be restored and renewed. Amen. Rejoined to God as an expression of his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I've got full confidence in that. And it's not you doing it. It's just you coming subjective to it. It's just you saying amen to it. It's just you, Amen, becoming transformed by the omnipotent power of God in his word. The words that I speak unto you. I no doubt Jesus could have looked at Peter. He could have looked at John. He could have looked at Thomas. He could have looked at Andrew and said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit in their life." He probably didn't look at Judas when he said that. Amen. Unto you. Hallelujah. This message unto you is spirit and life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were. That believe not. That's interesting. I never caught that. There was a group that believed not, but there was one that would betray him. &gt;&gt; Who they were that believed not and who should betray him. Judas really just manifested to a higher degree. The result of the unbelief that all unbelievers had. But I don't know how to say this except Jesus life and and his presence has a very polarizing effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just can't remain neutral. &gt;&gt; When he is present, when his word is present, when it's revealed in its fullness, you can't stay in the middle. You're either going to be pushed away &gt;&gt; or you're going to be drawn fully &gt;&gt; into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just can't you can't remain neutral any longer because it is so powerful. It's it's like a magnet. It's you're either going to go north or you're going to go south. You the more power you apply to it, the the the quicker it drives it. It's just a it's polarizing. Now, that was true then and it's true today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen to the message uniting time inside. Never before had Herod and Pilate and the Sadducees and the Pharisees and and all these people. They'd never joined forces before. But now he's here. And they got to do something. They got to put aside their differences and unify against the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; So you can't remain neutral. You got to either be a fullout unbeliever &gt;&gt; or a fullout disciple. &gt;&gt; And the thing I love is Peter. If you look at the life of Peter and you look at the life of Judas, you'd have you'd be hardressed to tell the difference. &gt;&gt; But Peter had something on the inside of him that even though he could not understand it, he could not even defend it. Though he tried, Lord, I'm not going to deny you. Peter meant that. When Peter said that, he meant that. He was the most loyal disciple Jesus had. But he didn't have the new birth. So in his humanity, in his human desire to be as loyal to Christ as he could be, he simply did not have the wherewithal. He really had nothing more than Judas except for something buried down deep on the inside that could be quickened once the Holy Ghost was released. &gt;&gt; And that Judas did not have. But he stuck he stuck around long enough, Amen. to be so associated with it that he could lead the Romans to the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Now, our job in this hour is not to figure out who's who. &gt;&gt; Our job is to know who we are, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And be certain of who we are. Amen. And and and and be fully enveloped into that. Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him. And he said in verse 65, "Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me, no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father." I believe it's the same thing he said in Matthew 16. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, Peter. But my father which is in heaven and on this rock I'll build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Now we're back to St. John 6 verse 66. That's not a coincidence. St. John 6 66. From that time, many of his disciples went back. See, there was somewhere for them to go back to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it was not him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had to go back to something. And then Peter and the and the 11 had to be pulled back into him. &gt;&gt; Everybody's going back. The question is where is back? &gt;&gt; Is it back to eternity where you originated from &gt;&gt; or someplace else? Then said Jesus unto the twel, "Will ye also go away?" That's amazing. You can see he wasn't worried about numbers. You can see he wasn't worried about an attraction. Uh I think it was Christmas two years ago, Christmas day, my wife and I went to Colombia and she told me never to make a sermon out of this. So I'm not going to make a sermon out of this today. I'm just going to use it as a point. All right. &gt;&gt; We went past an exit. We needed our our daughter was really small at the time and and she needed something to drink and we knew that uh you know there's only a few places open on Christmas day. So the first place we went was a convenience store and we couldn't find those little those special little bottles for kids that you know they they won't spill it all over the place. We couldn't find the juice. So my wife said, "Well, there's a McDonald's and and they have a chocolate milk for kids." So, there was a there was a car at the drive-thru kiosk that we figured the the dining room was probably closed and this was I think even during the coming out of CO. So, um but there was a car at the drive-thru. So, we're like, we'll just drive over there and order to go. So, we drove over there and and the the car had already moved around and and the way the drive-thru was situated once you left the kiosk to move around, you couldn't see the car that was in front of you. So, no one answered me at the kiosk. No one said a word. And I So, in my mind, I thought, well, if they're open, I'll just drive up to the window. Maybe the intercom doesn't work. The problem is the McDonald's was closed. And the sign and they even had a calendar. They had printed a paper calendar and they'd stuck it on the kiosk, but even it didn't make it clear that the restaurant was completely closed. So, the reason people were pulling in there and driving up to the kiosk is simply because they saw other cars there &gt;&gt; and they thought, "Well, if they're getting served, maybe I'll get served." And I thought, "There's a lot of churches &gt;&gt; that the only reason anybody goes there is because they see some cars in the parking lot and they think, well, they must be getting served, so maybe I can, too. And only later do they realize nobody's getting anything &gt;&gt; because God's not there. &gt;&gt; His word's not being preached. There's a joke about a cowboy that went to church one time and they the deacon board or somebody told him said, "If you ever come back, don't come back dress like that because we don't like people dressed like you coming to our church." So he went home and he prayed and he said, "Lord, how should I dress the next time I go?" And Jesus said, "I don't know. I've never been there myself. I know the pulpit's not a place for jokes, &gt;&gt; but friends, you know, Jesus knew that his the draw for his ministry would not be a crowd. &gt;&gt; He knew the thing that would attract people to him wasn't the size of the following because that will attract people. &gt;&gt; There are people who want to be a part of the biggest thing. right or wrong, whatever it is, it's just big and they want to be attached to big. &gt;&gt; So they'll they'll even put up with a lot of nonsense just to be in the biggest group. &gt;&gt; But the draw for the true believer and the and Jesus knew his ministry on earth was not in vain. He knew the whole reason he was sent was to call an elected few. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Elijah had to be told the same thing. Amen. There's 7,000 I have reserved that have not bowed their knee to bell. That's who you were sent for. Amen. It Moses was really sent to Egypt for two people. When you boil it all down, he had two converts, but two million lives were affected by it, and they gave birth to the generation that went over with Joshua and Caleb. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, he said, "Will ye also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered him,"Lord, to whom shall we go, "Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I feel like I've preached my sermon, but uh so I don't disappoint the people that came here to hear a 60 to 90 minute message, I'm gonna say a few more things. Is that all right? I want to know how many of you have ever heard the phrase, "Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing." &gt;&gt; You ever heard that before? Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. Now, how many of you know who who originated or who authored that statement? Does anybody know whose statement that is? Now, do you really know or are you just pretending to be non-sports enthusiast because the pastor's looking on because I know there's some Bulldogs fans and I know I'm in Georgia. That quote is attributed to Vince Lombardi who was a coach of the Green Bay Packers way back when. Amen. &gt;&gt; Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. Well, this for whatever reason, this was in my mind this morning. So, I looked it up because Peter has made a phrase. Now, to whom shall we go, Lord? Thou hast the words of eternal life. Those are the immortalized words of Peter. &gt;&gt; This phrase I've just shared with you, winning isn't everything. It's the only thing is a famous quote popularized by former Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi. While often used to emphasize a ruthless drive for victory, it is a misattribution. He later clarified that he meant the will to win is the only thing that matters, not necessarily the victory itself. &gt;&gt; Boy, when I read that, I said, man, AI is pretty smart. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, I've heard that statement. Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. And you think, man, that that that that does sound kind of I mean, you know, whoever you got to stomp, whoever you got to beat up, whoever you got to massacre, getting that trophy is that's that's the only thing. But that's not what he meant. &gt;&gt; He clarified that he meant the will to win is the only thing that matters, not the victory itself. And then it went on to say this. The original quote is attributed to UCLA football coach Red Sanders. It wasn't even Vince Lombardi's. &gt;&gt; He didn't invent. He was not the first person to say it. He was the person who popularized it. &gt;&gt; That's something to think about. He didn't originate the statement. He just made the statement famous &gt;&gt; because of his success as a coach. &gt;&gt; Now, that's that does tie in with what I'm saying this morning. &gt;&gt; This is what differentiated Peter, Thomas, John, and the others who remained with Jesus despite the reproach, the disappointment, or the losses they faced. It wasn't about a win. It was about the will to win. &gt;&gt; They didn't always win. And on the day of the crucifixion, they didn't feel like winners. And on the day of the resurrection, when he joined with them along the road to Omus, they sure didn't feel like winners. They were discouraged. They were defeated. They were despondent. They were cast down. Amen. Peter had already gone back to fish. And in fact, when Jesus found them, he was on the boat naked. Right? So, not a lot there to uh to to really wow you with Jesus' ability to pick disciples or their ability to remain loyal to him. Although they were his choice and although they amen rose above Judas in their loyalty and faithfulness to who Jesus Christ is, amen, they weren't, it shows us in hindsight, amen, they weren't in it for the immediate benefit. They were not in it for the instant gratification. THEY HAD BEEN CALLED BY him because it was in the mind of God and it WAS IN THE DESIRE OF God for Jesus not to live on the earth as a singular expression of who God is. But it was to include a body. It was to INCLUDE FISHERMEN AND TAX collectors and people who were so ignorant and unlearned they couldn't even sign their own name. It was to include prostitutes, ill-famed women. It was to include people whose lives were so shameful they could not go to THE TEMPLE. BUT GOD DESIRED TO REVEAL HIMSELF and include those people. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. And within them was the will to win. Within them was the will. I don't want to be a prostitute. I DON'T WANT TO BE A DRUG ADDICT. I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS for the rest of my life. SOMETHING WANTED to be more. BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT until they met Jesus. Jesus did for them what the temple could not do, what the religious order could NOT DO, WHAT MOSES and what the writings of the Old Testament couldn't do. Jesus did it. &gt;&gt; When they met him, their lives were changed. She didn't keep on in prostitution. They didn't keep on fishing and tax collecting. Their lives were changed &gt;&gt; by the manifestation of God's life to them. Quicken his life within them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This resolve is not born out of human desire or effort, but is a divine characteristic that the revelation of his word quickens. It's his own life &gt;&gt; that he's quickening by his word and by his spirit. &gt;&gt; The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and their life. So, I'm just going to read to you a little bit. Jesus life and ministry were to express God's life in humanity, not to reveal himself as the singular expression of God in the form of a son, but to open the way for sons and daughters to see and recognize his life to the extent that his very life would quicken them to the same expression of fulfilling his word for the day and hour it was ordained. Regardless of the age, the conditions, the prevailing governmental or ecumenical powers or spirits of the age, his elected and predestinated attributes or children would be born into their age to hear and fulfill echo or amen that word to the extent their lives would be his word embodied in humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pentecost was the birth of that bride body in its infancy. That was the alpha expression of Christ's life. But the great mystery waiting to be revealed, waiting to be revealed at the end of time would be that same life expressed as an omega. Amen. &gt;&gt; A maturity, a maturity, completeness and perfection that by the expression of the original life, that original life on earth again would bring the rest of the body to a resurrection and a rapture. I appreciate your amen, brother Wade, because that'll show your congregation I'm not saying something different than what you believe. Amen. God was starting there in Christ. And in those 11 disciples and in those 120, God was starting there a pattern that would follow through each age &gt;&gt; and and escalate and build a body. God was actually building a body with his word revealed in each age. It was calling out the parts and pieces that would make up the pyramid, the stature of a perfect man. God was building that and God is capping that in this age. And when it is kept, there are alive and remain. There are people that will not experience death. &gt;&gt; But the revelation of the rapture, amen, will be a reality that transforms their bodies. And when they are quickened into glorified bodies, the sleeping saints will also rise from the graves. Amen. And Jesus Christ will come, will descend from glory, and we will leave the earth to meet him in the air. After a 40-day or so gathering here on the earth, amen, we're going to see those sleeping saints rise. Amen. And we're going to begin having fellowship with him. We're going to have a reunion with him. There's going to be a great rejoicing for about 40 days. And then he's going to appear. And we're going TO BE TAKEN UP, HALLELUJAH, to be with him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise the Lord. Amen. Man, I feel like a preacher now. Ain't God good? &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to back up here. Paragraph 218. Brother Bam says in Christ, the mystery of God revealed. It's not expressions of some church that we should express something. It's a life that you don't live yourself, but he comes in you and lives by himself and you become a prisoner to any to any human intellectual being at all. You're led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's God's desire. That's he's showing us how God's desire to have his preeminences. &gt;&gt; See, what God did in Christ was to enable him regaining the preeminences in his church. One leads to the other. One makes way for the other. And so when he gains the preeminences in his church, that takes us back to Eden, that edmic condition where there was a complete harmony between God and his created son and daughter to the extent that they were the gods of this earth and all nature recognized. Amen. Adam was the god of this univer. Amen. the the the the the earth that we live on today, Adam was its God. Until he failed, the earth recognized that and God's desire is to restore us back to Eden. And it's already underway. &gt;&gt; And the prophet OF GOD WAS SHOWING US the life of God was expressing itself to him to the measure that deer, squirrel, and storms were recognizing God expressed in a man. &gt;&gt; But it didn't stop there. God was showing through his messenger just as he showed through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, what he was going to do in the believers of his ministry. He was showing, Amen, through another adopted son, William Brandham, what he was going to do through a bride. I believe that with all my heart. Amen. And I believe it is happening. I believe it IS GOING ON NOW. I don't believe it's something off in the future. I believe it's taking place right now. Amen. But it's so humble, simple. The world will miss it. &gt;&gt; Most of the world missed it in Christ's day, too. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel good this morning, brother. &gt;&gt; All right, let me share a few other things. &gt;&gt; Like I say, I don't want to disappoint those people that know I never preach less than 90 minutes. I like to joke, too. Y'all forgive me, but your original pastor was invited me, too. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget. I'm I'm I'm really stretching it now. But I'll never forget I came here as a young preacher one time and I demonstrated how that uh your attributes are passed to you through the human genetics and you can't even help it. You're not even conscious of it. You walk a certain way, you talk a certain way. There are there are reactions and responses that are just part of your DNA &gt;&gt; and you really can't do anything to change it. And I was talking about how we how crosses, you know, my last name is cross and I got four brothers and we we we sit in a chair a certain way &gt;&gt; and and I said we won't sit down, you know, just walk up in front of a chair, sit down. We kind of glide into it and we we kind of we're squatting as we make that last tour. And I demonstrated that. I'll never forget brother Samuel got up and he said, "Now I've heard of a crosswalk." He said, "But I've never seen a crosswalk like that." And so, uh, that's, you know, I I don't want to make an excuse, you know, but, uh, I humor is part of my nature, and I like to I'll pick on myself before I pick on anybody else. If that makes you feel any better. &gt;&gt; All right. Jesus was God's love and revelation to let know to a predestinated seed that he had called you. &gt;&gt; This is him. Hear him. Paragraph 371. know the fullness of Godhead is made known. The secret of the mystery is now revealed that God is manifested. God and man become one. The anointed man, Christ, what does Christ mean? The anointed one. The anointed that was anointed with the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Oh my. How can people doubt it? We're once partly Moses had him, partly David had him. But oh my, here he is manifested in his fullness deity himself standing on earth. God in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days. See, listen now. and pinch yourself a little. Now watch what was Jesus manifested for. Now a lot of times I'm going to give you a key. A lot of times when brother Brandham says pinch yourself, pinch yourself, what he's doing is giving a signal. This is not a 2,000 year ago event. &gt;&gt; This is happening again. &gt;&gt; Pinch yourself means come to your conscience. Quit dreaming and fantasizing about this being off in the future or somewhere in the past. &gt;&gt; Realize &gt;&gt; Samson knocked the pillars down when he came to himself. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is bringing us to the realization of what God is doing now and how it was shadowed and typed then but is repeating now. &gt;&gt; What was Jesus manifested for? To show God. He was God. He had to be. No man could die. No prophet could die. He was God. He was the God of the prophets. He was the prophets. He was the kings. He was the history. See, he's showing how all those things shadowed him. He was that that was to come, that w that was, that is, and he that's to be in this day, the same yesterday, today, and forever. He was manifested for that purpose. And through that purpose, he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promise to God in these last days when he gets the preeminences in the church. The position his place in the church. Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, even more than this shall he do, for I go to my father." See, that was his purpose. Can the purpose of God be defeated? &gt;&gt; Then if you're a part of it, how can you be defeated? &gt;&gt; That were there was the manifestation. And now today, he wants to get somebody that can so see it. They can let the word Jesus so seen it. It was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made. He was God's revelation. Oh my. He was God's revelation. &gt;&gt; God revealed. Now he sanctified. I'm I am going to close, church. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Because this brings you into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed. Now see, he could go back and pick up what these other fellas left off here in the last days and by his Holy Spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals. You see friends, this is not just ideas and doctrines and truths. It's people. It involves the lives of people that have become the embodiment of these truths. &gt;&gt; They're living the truth. I've said before, God's not going to rapture books and tapes. The rapture is going to be people who have become the rapture because they receive rapturing faith through this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his purpose. That's that's why he died. That's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation. First to express himself in Christ, then express itself through the church. In the same thing, Christ was the word. And the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them. But when they accept a hybrid denomination, how can the word go through? It's grounded, causes a short and blows a fuse. But when the current is flowy free, flowing freely, the word of God, it expresses itself. Now, I want you to understand this morning. You don't have to manufacture this. &gt;&gt; It's not a pressure for you to manufacture. It's a consignment of you saying Lord be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. &gt;&gt; It's the simple acceptance of his word and say Lord this is your word and I am a willing vessel. I am a bedding ground. I want your word to have its preeminence in whatever way you decide. Here I am Lord. Fill me, send me. &gt;&gt; That's what makes this, you know, it's not you gota you got to manufacture this wool. No, just eat. Eat the word. &gt;&gt; The wool is in your DNA, but you got to eat the word to be able to grow wool. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, when the current is flowing freely, the word of God, it expresses itself. The works that I do shall you also, and in the last days it shall come to pass. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. And in there, there would come a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead, deity through the church, &gt;&gt; have the preeminences in this church. I've got to say this, I do not believe that William Brandham alone embodied this. I refute that on the basis of his own statements. &gt;&gt; The problem I have with that idea is brother Bradom didn't believe it. &gt;&gt; He did not believe he was the only one. &gt;&gt; Elijah thought that one time and God said, "No, you're not. I've got 7,000. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to be alive. You don't have to know who they are. I know who they are." &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my friend, it's wonderful to see it in brother Brenham. BUT DO YOU KNOW who you are? Whether other churches, other doctrines, other moves, your neighbor, YOUR PARENTS, I DON'T CARE WHO, whether or not they ever see who you are, if you know who you are, God's word can express itself through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the amen to the message. You know, uh Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus one day. He'd been there dead for 4 days. The Jews didn't want to have anything to do with them cuz even getting in proximity to a dead body was a violation of the Jewish faith. And Jesus says, "Show me the tomb." And they led Jesus to the mouth of the tomb and he said, "Roll away the stone." And they rolled away the stone. And he said, "Lazarus, come forth." And out of that tomb, a man that had been laying there for four days and had begun to decay and decompose walked forth from that tomb wrapped in grave clothes. And you know what? Jesus did not unwrap him. He told them, "Loose him." &gt;&gt; The same words he said to the cult and the same words he used in the loosing of the earth from the atmospheres that made it Satan's Eden. He said, "You've got to do this, church." Because you're the one who thought he was dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And wrapped him in grave clothes. &gt;&gt; Now, friend, that has a great application. I'm taking my time and I'm off my notes. But there are people that God does something in their lives that only God can do. &gt;&gt; He speaks to them and calls them out of that dead condition and they will never be more alive &gt;&gt; than they are at that moment. &gt;&gt; But they are still wrapped in something other people put them in. &gt;&gt; And that is the memories &gt;&gt; of that condition. And we say, "Well, he's a drunkard. She's a drug addict. She's prostitute. They, you know, you don't know their past. Their past don't matter." &gt;&gt; He spoke and his word brought them to life. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now you unwrap those grave clothes. &gt;&gt; You get that off of them and you get that idea out of your mind that that's who they are. That is not who they are." Amen. Amen. That's a result of the condition. Lazarus did not wrap himself in those grave clothes. They wrapped him in the grave clothes because to them he was dead. But Jesus said, "Loose him because he's not dead. I made him alive. Now you loose him and let him demonstrate. Let him live in the life that I put in him by the hearing of my word." Somebody say amen. Somebody say thank you Lord. I was dead in sin. I was dead. I WAS UN UNDONE. I WAS A SINNER. I SERVED SATAN. I BUILT PHARAOH'S KINGDOMS. I was the least of the least. BUT ONE DAY I heard a voice. AND WHEN I HEARD THAT VOICE, I COULD NOT LIE STILL. I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THAT CONDITION. I had to stand up. Amen. &gt;&gt; You imagine how many Sadducees that would have loved to keep Lazarus in that condition and and and never have a reason not to to believe &gt;&gt; never have a reason to believe in the resurrection. And they might have taken Lazarus to the side later said, "Lazarus, you completely demolished all that we've built our church and faith on. We don't believe in a resurrection, but now you're alive. &gt;&gt; Why in the how in the world? &gt;&gt; Lazarus say it's as simple as this. I heard my name. &gt;&gt; Somebody called my name. And when I heard him say my name, I could not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I COULD NOT remain in that condition. BUT I STEPPED FORTH and his word unraveled me, removed the obstacle, REMOVED THE STONE, AND HERE I AM TODAY as an echo or an amen to Jesus life and ministry. Lazarus lived on after Jesus was taken to be a witness to his life, his power, and his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. In there would come a time when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church. Have the preeminences in his church. In this church. Oh my. What? The anointed man. Now the anointed people. The anointed people. Oh my. To bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anointed by why? accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointed word because he said my word is spirit. See anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept. &gt;&gt; All right I'm closing now. If they want to come to the music that'd be fine. To whom shall we go Lord? That was Peter's question and he originally authored the phrase. Peter was the first one that ever said it. But my question to you today is who will popularize the phrase? Because just as we saw with the statement, winning is it everything, it's the only thing, the man most people attribute that statement to didn't say it the first time. He picked it up from a lessernown coach and made it his own statement. And even though it was mis appropriated and mischaracterized, it's still the statement for which he is known today because of how popular he made it. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking today, we know who originally said, "To whom shall we go?" And it wasn't because he wanted Jesus to point him somewhere else. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because he was so discouraged and so disheartened and so hopeless and so despondent. He was just waiting on Jesus to tell him he knew there was nothing better. &gt;&gt; In a sense, it was a rhetorical question or it was a statement. &gt;&gt; And to prove that, listen to what he said. Thou hast the words. &gt;&gt; You're the source. &gt;&gt; You got it. If you aren't it, we're we're lost. We're nothing. We're toast. It's over. But it was a declaration of absolute abandonment to Christ and him alone. It wasn't everything. It was the only thing. &gt;&gt; Friends, we're being questioned today. Whether by the unbelievers, the critics, or just everyday life, we're being questioned. What will my response be? &gt;&gt; I say, let's popularize the phrase. &gt;&gt; Peter might have said it originally, but let's recognizing who Christ is today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And saying, "Where else would I go? Where else would I turn? Who has what he has done for me? Who can do for me what this message, what this truth, what this revealed word has done for me today? You came too late to tell me there's something else. You came too late to tell me this is setting the stage for something greater. You come too late to tell me the seventh angel was a forerunner to an eighth messenger or that I need some other pastor or some other leader or some other great move of God to rise up after this and lead me onto something greater. You came too late to tell me that. &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? This message is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to me. &gt;&gt; TO ME, IT'S PERSONAL NOW. It's personal now. I'm thankful brother Wade sees it. I'm thankful you see it. BUT IF NOBODY ELSE SEES IT, I'M A JOSHUA AND I'M A CALEB. And I will not stop short of a full inheritance AND A FULL DISPOSSESSION OF everything that stands BETWEEN ME AND MY PROMISE. WHERE ELSE am I going to go? What else is there? There is nothing ELSE LEFT BUT THIS MESSAGE IS TO BRING RAPTURING FAITH. It is bringing rapturing faith. IT HAS BROUGHT THE RAPTURING FAITH. It is the visitation of Jesus Christ to the earth today in the form of the revealed word to perform the promise of the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying amen to it. AMEN. ISAIAH MADE THE PHRASE, "BEHOLD, a virgin shall conceive." But Mary popularized it. Hallelujah. THERE WAS A PROPHET WHO SAID IT, BUT THERE WAS A VIRGIN WHO LIVED IT. SHE EXPRESSED IT. SHE SAID, "I AM THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT SCRIPTURE." Peter came out of the upper room AND SAID, "THESE MEN are drunk as you suppose." But the third hour OF THE DAY, HE SAID IT, BUT I'M HERE TO popularize it. I'm here to live it. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS IT. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TODAY IS THAT FULFILLED. What you're seeing today, this is spoken word, church. SAMUEL DELL DIDN'T START IT AND WADE Dell can't keep it going. God spoke it into existence. And God's going to pastor it. God's going to sustain it. God's going to keep it. And he's going to use men like Brother Wade and myself. And you, &gt;&gt; you got a part in this church, too. Friends, I believe that. I believe God ordains everybody to be a part of a local assembly. And when you know that, you can find your place and function in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't plan on saying that, but when you have a revelation of where you fit into God's body, and God's body is much greater than this portion of his body. I realize that. But when you know where you belong, get in there, get grounded, get attached, become cemented together, and watch God perform through his building. Amen. The expression of his life here on the earth. Amen. You know, you know what Mary did? She filled in the blank. There was a blank there. A virgin shall conceive. Mary simply filled in the blank. My wife and I have have adopted a child and we'll by the grace of God adopt another one maybe within the next year. There's all kinds of paperwork and you know this from buying a home, buying a car, but especially when it comes to legal documents. There are things that you are required to sign and it'll talk about, you know, this is the state, this is the county, this is the federal government, this is this this uh governmental power, this entity and all of that is on the document, but there's a blank space and it says your name in the blank. And what that blank is giving you is the privilege of putting yourself as a part of the bond that is reinforced by everything the state is &gt;&gt; or everything the county is, everything the federal government is. They are put there on the document, typed in, irrevocable, irreovable. They are there permanently and it's saying you write your name there and you are going to become a part of this institution that can never never be disenfranchised, never be separated. The state would have to go bankrupt and the federal government would have to go bankrupt. They would have to be completely dissolved for you to lose. And once you put your name in there in ink, they go back and the same person that typed up the first one types up another one with your name in the same type that theirs was before you signed it, inc. It makes you a permanent fixture &gt;&gt; in that government of that power. Mary wrote her name. Actually, the angel of the Lord did it, but Mary had to say amen to it. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is say amen. &gt;&gt; That was for me. &gt;&gt; That's for me. That's for my life. That's for my condition. That's for my marriage. That's for my family. I say amen to it. When you write your name in the blank, God comes back behind it and writes it in there and said, "Dares Satan or any other power &gt;&gt; to challenge it." &gt;&gt; Because when he does, God himself would have to go bankrupt before you could lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word, behold the handmade of the Lord. That's the life of the word expressing itself through you which makes you the ultimate vindication of its power. Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's stand to our feet. Could you give me the key of G? I'm going to turn it over to a good song leader here in just a second, but I want to sing this one. They were g in the upper room all praying in his name. They were baptized with the Holy Ghost when powerful service came. Now, what he did for them that day, he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Come my brother, seek this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sin. That will start the joy of that. Turn around, shake somebody's hand, and say, "I'm one of them." Or boast of a worldly fame. They have all received their Pentecost, baptized in Jesus' name, and are pouring now with Lord and water. Glory gets the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, these people may not learn to meet nor boast of a world. It will not receive a show in Jesus name and now both hit the bride. I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Judas said he was one of them. &gt;&gt; You got to know what them you're talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Judas thought he was right there in with them. And he was. He sure did. Uh he faked the other 11 out. &gt;&gt; But brother Tim, only one person that was the son of man knew who he was. So in the end time only the manifestation of the son of man is going to know where that other party's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're one of them though. &gt;&gt; We're one of them that the end of earth has come upon. We're one of them that's going to take a rapture. &gt;&gt; We're one of them that's going to what? Benefit from the word of God being preached just like our brother Tim today. What a wonderful job. Let's give him another hand. Amen. Now that hymn I was talking about God. So now let's give brother Tim a hand a hand clap that one that him because we know God used him and we sure appreciate uh &gt;&gt; appreciate the Lord using him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and coming being with us today. He's just he's part of the family. He's just a family member. He is pretty cross but he is part of the family. If any of you have ever made his other brothers, &gt;&gt; he's the best of the best. So, so if he's a little bit, his brothers are 10 times worse. So, but we sure appreciate brother Tim and uh Sister Faith, we've known him for a long time. And and I had forgotten that dad had said that, but I remember now that uh you talking about crosswalk. So, but we you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you have to love our brother because he brought the word of God to each one of us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope you got your portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you got your fill. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you got something to sustain you until &gt;&gt; we only got Monday now. Tuesday night we'll be back. And uh and then I want you all to have a wonderful Thanksgiving coming up the end of the week. And uh we'll be back regular service on Sunday. And um just pray for each and everyone. I know there's a lot of traveling goes on during that time and um we are going to pray that your travel is safe. go see friends and family and uh but brother Brandham, you would think on a Thanksgiving day he preached in Streetport, Louisiana. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The invisible. He said this will make you want to cry. This is my message. My message. He's the prophet of the end time. &gt;&gt; This is my message to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. My thanksgiving message to you &gt;&gt; is that you have united &gt;&gt; with Christ &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; Not waiting as denomination say, well, when we get there. No, &gt;&gt; no. There is here. &gt;&gt; If it's like the old saying is, you got to have some heaven here to get to heaven there. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a connection. And I believe brother Tim, he's connected. As brother Ernie Villan Noea always says, you got to be plugged into eternal. If &gt;&gt; you're not plugged into the eternal, you're not eternal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we're plugged into the eternal eternal word of God. &gt;&gt; We'll never have to leave. There'll be a time when we will not have to go. We can just praise the Lord for thousands of years and not have to worry about Monday. &gt;&gt; Like I said, I hope the rapture takes place between 6:00 and 9 Monday morning. We'll just mess the devil up, won't it? because some of us that do still work, we have rough Mondays. So, but just pray for us all. We had a good time uh being gone and rested and uh get back to the uh get back in the saddle again. But, Brother Aaron's going to be with us Tuesday night and speak for us. So, um all minds and hearts clear. Thank y'all so much. Last weekend, brother Steven Wilson did a wonderful job. He called and said to thank every one of you for your prayers and pulling on the gift he had. And we sure appreciate all the food that y'all fixed that u your sisters and brothers brought. and the um efforts that you put together to serve it and serve the uh the bride of Jesus Christ. And we sure do appreciate that. They're the cream of the crop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're serving the bride, you're serving Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. An extension of himself, &gt;&gt; not another person. An extension of himself. &gt;&gt; So all minds clear. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this day. My, what a word that we've heard, Lord, that we can now, Lord, digest this message, Lord, and just chew it up over and over again, Lord, as you told John to eat the book. But we're still eating it now. We're eating the word of God as our brother brought to us, Lord. How that Lazarus, Lord, he was in that grave for 4 days, but when he came out, there had to be one more step. He had to be unwrapped. Lord, we've come to a place now of the unbinding. I believe we've resurrected out of this world as far as the denominational ideas and things, but Lord, there's one more time. Lazarus had to die again, but we will not. Father, hasten that day, Lord, that we come to a place, Lord, of as we come to adoption and then we come, Lord, to the to the resurrection, Father, and then the rapture, Lord, that's what our soul is longing for because that's what's going to get out of here. It's going to get us out of here, Lord, as our soul that's connected to you, Father, from the foundation of the world. Father, forgive us of our faults and ideas.
