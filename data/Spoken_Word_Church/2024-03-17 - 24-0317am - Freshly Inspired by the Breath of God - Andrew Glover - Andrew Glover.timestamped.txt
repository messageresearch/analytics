[47:55] you brother Wade sister Junior
[47:57] amen we we sure love and appreciate you
[47:59] all and this morning if you have your
[48:01] Bibles we want to go to the word we're
[48:02] going to turn to the book of St John the
[48:04] 20th chapter the book of St John the
[48:07] 20th chapter we want to look here in the
[48:10] 18th verse of John chapter 20 we just
[48:13] have a few things here today to share
[48:15] with you on our heart and we just pray
[48:17] it'll be a blessing to you in the book
[48:19] of St John the 20th chapter and in the
[48:23] 18th verse the Bible here says that Mary
[48:27] Magdalene came and told the disciples
[48:30] that she had seen the Lord and that he
[48:33] had spoken these things unto her then
[48:35] the same day at evening being the first
[48:37] day of the week when the doors were
[48:39] shut where the disciples were assembled
[48:42] for the fear of the Jews Jesus came and
[48:46] stood in the midst now I love that came
[48:49] Jesus and stood in the midst now we know
[48:52] that in the beginning was the word and
[48:54] the Word was with God and the Word was
[48:56] God
[48:57] and the Word was made flesh and the Word
[48:59] was made flesh in Jesus so we could say
[49:01] that the word came and stood in the
[49:04] midst and saith unto them peace be unto
[49:07] you so now we have the word speaking
[49:09] peace be unto you and when he had so
[49:12] said he showed un them his hands and his
[49:14] side and then were the disciples glad
[49:17] when they saw the Lord then said Jesus
[49:20] to them again peace be unto you as my
[49:24] father hath sent me even even so send I
[49:28] you and when he had said this he
[49:30] breathed on them somebody say breathed
[49:32] on them bre he breathed on them and
[49:35] saith unto them receive ye the Holy
[49:38] Ghost now watch he breathes the word
[49:41] breathes on them and says receive ye the
[49:44] Holy Ghost then the very next verse
[49:46] speaks of the authority of the church
[49:48] and says whosoever sins ye remit they
[49:51] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[49:54] sins you retain they are retained amen
[49:58] let's just bow our hearts together this
[49:59] morning Heavenly Father we thank you for
[50:01] the opportunity to serve you today we
[50:04] thank you for the anointing that we F in
[50:06] your word Lord knowing that you are the
[50:08] same yesterday today and forever and
[50:10] Lord we know that you're in our midst
[50:12] today to minister to the needs of your
[50:14] children so father as we Endeavor to
[50:16] look into your word we invite the spirit
[50:18] of wisdom and Revelation to come into
[50:21] the building and to move in the power
[50:23] lord of the spirit Lord may you break
[50:25] every stronghold of the enemy oh God
[50:28] lord may you bring inspiration Lord may
[50:30] you bring change to hearts and lives and
[50:32] father I pray a special blessing upon
[50:34] our brother Wade upon his family oh God
[50:37] upon this assembly father Upon Our
[50:39] Brother Sam sister Peggy Lord I pray
[50:41] that your anointing oh God would rest
[50:43] upon them Father Lord may you bless this
[50:46] church Lord may you continue to use them
[50:48] Lord as a lighthouse in this community
[50:50] for the word that you've revealed in
[50:52] this generation now father we invite you
[50:55] have your way among us today God we love
[50:57] you Lord we thank you for your blessings
[50:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all
[51:02] the Believers says amen and amen God
[51:06] Rich you bless you today amen I want you
[51:08] by the help of the Lord you can have
[51:09] your seats here for a moment amen I want
[51:11] you by the help of the Lord for just a
[51:13] moment today to speak to here and if I
[51:15] would title this today I want to talk to
[51:17] you about freshly inspired by the Breath
[51:20] of God Amen freshly inspired by the
[51:23] Breath of God you know I believe if
[51:25] there ever was a time
[51:27] amen that we could use a refreshing or a
[51:29] freshness amen I believe that time is
[51:32] right now and you know uh as we look at
[51:34] that word refresh of course you know the
[51:36] root word of refresh is fresh and that
[51:39] word fresh means having its original
[51:41] qualities unimpaired amen having its
[51:45] original qualities unimpaired full of or
[51:48] renewed in Vigor it's not stale it's not
[51:52] sour it's not decayed it's not faded
[51:55] amen and it's not all altered by
[51:57] processing so when something is original
[52:00] or something is fresh amen it's not
[52:02] altered there's nothing added to it
[52:04] there's nothing taken away from it amen
[52:07] it still has its original qualities now
[52:10] when you look at that word qualities it
[52:12] is the standard of something amen as
[52:14] measured against other things of a
[52:16] similar kind it is the degree of
[52:18] Excellence of something it is a
[52:20] distinctive attribute amen or
[52:22] characteristic that is possessed amen by
[52:25] someone or something so when something
[52:28] amen is original it has an original
[52:31] quality amen and it's still packing the
[52:34] the the characteristic or the
[52:36] distinctive attribute amen that has been
[52:38] given to be manifested in that now says
[52:41] it very beautiful he said Jesus amen was
[52:44] possessed with all the fine qualities of
[52:46] God and you all know in Matthew chapter
[52:48] 4 the Bible said that Jesus met Satan
[52:52] amen and there the devil tempted him
[52:54] three times amen and here is Jes Jesus
[52:56] with all of these qualities because all
[52:59] that was in God he poured into Christ
[53:01] and all that was in Christ he has poured
[53:04] into to the church right amen then here
[53:06] is Jesus with the fine qualities of God
[53:09] but when he meets the devil he does not
[53:11] use one of those qualities but rather he
[53:14] uses this the word amen and says it is
[53:17] written brother said what was he doing
[53:19] he was bringing the power and the
[53:21] authority of the word amen into the
[53:24] reach of the weakest of Christian now
[53:26] amen I believe that there's power in the
[53:28] word of God I believe there is Authority
[53:31] in the word of God now maybe just for a
[53:33] moment to read here something to lay a
[53:35] foundation to draw our thought from
[53:38] brother says here speaking on hear ye
[53:40] himm in 1956 from Matthew 17 he's
[53:44] speaking of Jesus on Mount
[53:45] Transfiguration and he says you know
[53:47] God's word is so Eternal it's so
[53:49] inspired he said it's not just for one
[53:52] occasion or for one generation he said
[53:54] but the word of God is so Eternal it's
[53:57] the same it's the truth amen the word of
[54:00] God is eternal the word of God is the
[54:03] same and the word of God is the truth he
[54:05] said now this same word inspired the
[54:07] disciples it inspired the first row of
[54:10] disciples and then the next is they
[54:12] follow amen down to the Lutheran age
[54:14] down to the Methodist age and every age
[54:16] amen and is just as sufficient and
[54:19] inspiring today to us amen as it was the
[54:22] first day it was given and if the world
[54:24] should stand a million years amen that
[54:27] word would still be just as inspired to
[54:30] the generations that will follow amen us
[54:33] as it is to us because it's perfect it's
[54:35] always given for the time he said one
[54:38] great way we could approach it this
[54:39] afternoon as the coming of the Lord see
[54:41] the first as Moses then Elijah then
[54:44] Jesus he said but then we noticed that
[54:46] Peter while he was there he had just
[54:49] been freshly inspired amen because he
[54:52] had just given a witness to who Jesus
[54:54] was amen and he was was inspired now
[54:57] when a man is inspired and he reads the
[54:59] inspired word amen then the two
[55:02] Inspirations gives a result no matter
[55:04] how well you study the word amen it'll
[55:07] never do you no good till you are
[55:09] inspired yourself amen it takes your
[55:12] inspiration the word is already inspired
[55:15] so what we need today here's a prophet
[55:18] now what we need today is an inspiration
[55:21] over us amen God sweeping down with a
[55:24] new inspiration and breathing over us
[55:26] his power amen his love and himself that
[55:30] it might Inspire us to Quicken us amen
[55:33] and to awaken us through his word when
[55:35] the word being brought in the spirit of
[55:37] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[55:39] happen and things take place because the
[55:41] two amen just comes together so what we
[55:44] need today amen is not a new chart we
[55:47] don't need a new book or we don't need a
[55:48] new doctrine amen but we need the
[55:51] inspiration amen of the word of God to
[55:53] breathe over the Church of God Amen and
[55:56] when those two Inspirations comes
[55:58] together amen there is where you will
[56:00] see Miracles take place now I want to
[56:02] say this the word of God Amen is not
[56:05] like the word of a man amen the word of
[56:07] a man has a certain meaning amen or an
[56:10] expression for a Time amen but the word
[56:13] of God has an eternal meaning amen down
[56:16] Through the Ages Amen in other words if
[56:18] there was healing in the beginning there
[56:21] will be healing in the end if there was
[56:23] salvation in the beginning there will be
[56:25] salvation in the end whatever was in the
[56:28] alpha amen will be in the Omega come on
[56:32] church amen there will be a bride who
[56:34] will not be stale she will not be sour
[56:37] she will not be decayed she will not be
[56:40] diluted amen she will still have the
[56:43] same qualities manifested in her that
[56:46] was manifested in the groom every
[56:48] generation can pick up the same word
[56:51] because it is
[56:52] inspired it is eternal it is Everlasting
[56:56] lasting it is a nonfading declaration
[56:59] from God no matter if the apostles read
[57:01] it in their age it meant something for
[57:03] them if Wesley read it in his age and
[57:06] Luther in his age and Calvin in his age
[57:08] amen but yet today it's just as
[57:10] brilliant and bright and got just as
[57:12] much of an effect amen as it did for
[57:15] them on the very day it was spoken amen
[57:18] because it's God's word now you say our
[57:20] words St John you come over to my house
[57:22] I'll be glad to see you that's our words
[57:25] it just means John come over to our
[57:27] house amen but when God speaks somebody
[57:30] say when God speaks amen when God speaks
[57:33] it's Eternal amen it's breathed from the
[57:36] very breath of the immortal Everlasting
[57:39] Creator himself amen so when God speaks
[57:42] it's not coming amen from the ideas of a
[57:45] temporary mind when God speaks it's not
[57:48] coming from a finite mind but when God
[57:50] speaks it's coming from an infinite mind
[57:53] amen and it is the very Breath of God
[57:56] amen speaking the Creator himself I'll
[57:58] say this to you I believe that the
[58:00] message of the hour amen has brought the
[58:03] word of God Amen back to the Church of
[58:05] God Amen by the Breath of God and that
[58:08] word has come unto us unaltered oh come
[58:12] on church amen it's come unaltered it's
[58:15] not processed it's not hybridized amen
[58:18] it's a pure original word with the same
[58:21] qualities that it had Amen in the
[58:24] beginning and I believe if that word is
[58:26] has come to us that word amen must have
[58:29] the preeminence the word of God must
[58:31] have first place in the service it must
[58:33] have first place in our life it must be
[58:35] first place in our thoughts amen for it
[58:38] is eternal and it shall never pass away
[58:41] my word has to be altered like another
[58:43] man's word time has to be altered or
[58:45] altered rather to meet time but Thy word
[58:48] never changes there's no altering to
[58:51] God's word it's forever the same and now
[58:54] holy spirit author of this word word
[58:56] will you come and open it for us tonight
[58:58] and may the speaker be so submissive
[59:01] until you'll be able to come in and take
[59:04] the word of God and place it right out
[59:06] into every Hungry Heart and may there at
[59:09] lodge and find its Abiding Place and may
[59:11] it bring forth fruit 100-fold amen
[59:14] salvation healing joy and peace listen I
[59:17] want to say this God forbid amen we ever
[59:20] water this message down Amen to just
[59:23] some teaching or just some intellectual
[59:25] Gathering amen God forbid we ever take
[59:28] the authority and the power to produce
[59:30] joy and peace and salvation out of the
[59:33] word of God Amen I love what the Bible
[59:36] says there Amen in job 32:8 it says but
[59:40] there is a spirit in man amen and the
[59:42] inspiration of the almighty amen giveth
[59:45] them understanding now when you look at
[59:48] that word inspiration the word
[59:50] inspiration there actually means
[59:52] breath amen I love that it means breath
[59:55] it means Spirit it is the Breath of God
[59:58] Amen now watch this amen every breathing
[1:00:00] thing Spirit of man now I'll say it like
[1:00:03] this in other words amen the breath of
[1:00:05] the almighty amen giveth them
[1:00:08] understanding in other words when God
[1:00:10] begins to breathe understanding begins
[1:00:12] to come in the church in job 33:4 the
[1:00:15] spirit of God hath made me and the
[1:00:18] breath of the almighty amen hath given
[1:00:20] me life brother said oh God who formed
[1:00:23] the heavens and the Earth you just let
[1:00:25] your breath go forth with his word and
[1:00:27] everything Tak in its right position the
[1:00:30] Earth the moon the stars they all swung
[1:00:33] into place just as God breathed on his
[1:00:35] word he said oh God today we ask amen
[1:00:38] that you'll breathe on your word as we
[1:00:40] are trying to bring it to the people may
[1:00:42] it take its position this morning its
[1:00:45] place and be rooted and grounded in
[1:00:47] every heart amen that every person here
[1:00:50] amen might receive your blessings so let
[1:00:53] me say this there's a connection amen
[1:00:55] between when God breathed and things
[1:00:57] taken their position when God breathed
[1:00:59] the moon took its position when God
[1:01:02] breathed the Stars took their position
[1:01:04] when God breathed the Earth took its
[1:01:06] position listen if God can breathe over
[1:01:08] the natural creation and it come into
[1:01:11] its position I believe he can breathe
[1:01:13] over the spiritual creation and he can
[1:01:15] move every believer into their position
[1:01:18] in the body of Jesus Christ amen every
[1:01:21] breath that we breathe amen comes from
[1:01:24] God every breath that we breathe it
[1:01:27] comes from God now in Genesis chapter 2
[1:01:29] as you study your Bible you will find
[1:01:32] amen that Genesis 2 is the first time
[1:01:34] amen that the word breath is mentioned
[1:01:37] in the Bible in Genesis 2:7 the Bible
[1:01:39] said the Lord God Amen form man of the
[1:01:42] Dust of the earth of the ground and he
[1:01:44] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:01:46] life amen and Man became a living Soul
[1:01:50] so there is a connection between the
[1:01:52] Breath of God Amen and man coming into
[1:01:55] his position brother said I can see Adam
[1:01:57] standing let's take it this way see him
[1:01:59] standing there like a tree God had made
[1:02:01] him he was dead as he could be his toes
[1:02:04] like the root sticking in the ground
[1:02:06] amen but God said let there be Amen
[1:02:09] brother said let there be or breathe the
[1:02:11] breath oh God or breathe the breath of
[1:02:14] life into him and he jumped and came to
[1:02:17] himself amen the same thing that he said
[1:02:19] in Genesis 1 let there be the moon Let
[1:02:22] There Be The Stars let there be the
[1:02:24] firmament amen and God God said let
[1:02:26] there be amen and there was by the
[1:02:29] Breath of God I'll say this to you amen
[1:02:32] if you go to the Book of Luke 15 you
[1:02:33] will see that there was a prodal amen
[1:02:36] who was in the pig pin amen he was out
[1:02:38] of his position as a son in his father's
[1:02:41] house amen but I believe that the same
[1:02:44] breath amen that breathed upon Adam amen
[1:02:47] and caused him to come to himself and
[1:02:49] realize he's not a tree amen but he's a
[1:02:52] creation of the Mighty God is the same
[1:02:55] breath that went to the pigs pin and
[1:02:57] breathed over the prodal sign and said
[1:03:00] you do not belong here amen but you got
[1:03:02] a father's house and you got a position
[1:03:05] in that house and Church of the Living
[1:03:07] God Amen that's the same breath that has
[1:03:09] breathed across this church in the last
[1:03:12] days amen come out of the world come out
[1:03:15] of confusion come out of Babylon and
[1:03:17] come into your position by the word of
[1:03:21] God Amen I believe it I believe the
[1:03:23] Breath of God has the ability to move
[1:03:25] things into their position when you
[1:03:28] start talking about this Breath of God
[1:03:30] you will realize that the Breath of God
[1:03:31] is connected to Creation amen and
[1:03:34] creation is connected to the Breath of
[1:03:36] God in Psalms 33:6 by the word of the
[1:03:39] Lord were the heavens
[1:03:42] made and all the host of them amen by
[1:03:46] the breath of his mouth in Isaiah 42:5
[1:03:50] amen thus sayith the Lord thus sayith
[1:03:52] God the Lord he that created the heavens
[1:03:54] and stretched them out he that spread
[1:03:56] forth the Earth and that which cometh
[1:03:58] out of it now watch this he that giveth
[1:04:00] breath unto the people upon it amen and
[1:04:03] spirit to them that walk therein so he's
[1:04:06] the creator of the heavens he's the
[1:04:09] creator of the earth he's the Creator
[1:04:11] amen of the things that is inhabiting
[1:04:14] the earth amen but that same Creator
[1:04:17] amen turns around and gives breath to
[1:04:19] his creation and spirit to his creation
[1:04:23] Amen to walk in what he has created he
[1:04:26] said you are The God Who breaths the
[1:04:27] forth amen the first breath of life ever
[1:04:30] come in the earth and has control of
[1:04:32] every life amen until this present time
[1:04:35] and shall forever more control for thou
[1:04:37] art the creator of all mankind and all
[1:04:40] things that breathe he said I think of
[1:04:42] you when you walked here in Galilee up
[1:04:44] on the mountains at night time amen
[1:04:47] watching the great planations and so
[1:04:49] forth amen great planets of the heavens
[1:04:51] and the solar system knowing that you
[1:04:53] made them now watch this you spun them
[1:04:55] out with your hand and you blow your
[1:04:58] breath in the palm of your hand and
[1:05:01] every Star come into existence amen when
[1:05:04] you see the stars in the sky they didn't
[1:05:06] come into existence by some
[1:05:08] manufacturing of some Factory somewhere
[1:05:11] they come into existence amen by the
[1:05:13] breath of almighty God come on Sir amen
[1:05:16] is it okay to preach or y'all ready go
[1:05:17] home Amen in Isaiah 14 you know what the
[1:05:20] Bible said the Bible said that the devil
[1:05:23] would exalt himself amen above the stars
[1:05:26] of God he would try to exalt himself
[1:05:29] above the stars of God Amen but he would
[1:05:31] be brought low you know what the prophet
[1:05:33] of God said he said the stars of God
[1:05:36] Amen are the sons of God you know the
[1:05:38] prophet of God said that God reserved
[1:05:40] Isaiah 14 for the last day amen when the
[1:05:44] son of predition would be revealed what
[1:05:46] was the son of predition doing he was
[1:05:49] trying to disposition amen the sons of
[1:05:52] God Amen as the Messiah EDS of this
[1:05:55] generation
[1:05:56] but the same breath amen that put the
[1:05:58] devil in his place back there has
[1:06:01] returned to the church in the last days
[1:06:03] and it'll put the devil in his place
[1:06:04] here today I want to tell that devil
[1:06:06] this morning he will never disposition
[1:06:09] this bride he will never pull us out of
[1:06:11] our position because a devil didn't give
[1:06:14] it to us and a devil can't take it away
[1:06:17] a man didn't give it to us and a man
[1:06:19] can't take it away our position has been
[1:06:22] revealed by the breath of almighty God
[1:06:25] and there ain't no devil can take it
[1:06:27] there ain't no Spirit can bind you from
[1:06:29] positionally placing in the word of God
[1:06:32] Amen the Breath of God has breathed upon
[1:06:36] this generation I love what the prophet
[1:06:38] says he said God wants to be God Amen
[1:06:41] how many agree with there amen God wants
[1:06:43] to be God and if he ain't God he ain't
[1:06:45] going to be second
[1:06:47] place he don't have to let bail and some
[1:06:50] man-made dogma and some theory of some
[1:06:52] man or some idea of a Creed or some idea
[1:06:55] a denomination standing his way he's God
[1:06:58] look at somebody next to you and say
[1:06:59] he's
[1:07:01] God he's God and he's able these stones
[1:07:04] to rise children to Abraham he don't
[1:07:06] have to have your denomination he don't
[1:07:08] have to have your big societies and
[1:07:10] schools he takes what he can get in his
[1:07:12] hand he takes what he can get in his
[1:07:15] hand that is nothing amen and breathes
[1:07:18] the breath of life into it and it
[1:07:20] becomes something that'll serve him amen
[1:07:23] that's what makes him God amen what
[1:07:26] makes him God is he takes something in
[1:07:28] his hand that is nothing amen and he
[1:07:31] breathes upon it and causes it to be
[1:07:34] something and when he does that amen
[1:07:36] that gives him the position as The God
[1:07:39] Who can do anything any time anywhere
[1:07:42] any place under any condition listen if
[1:07:45] God saved you he didn't save you to put
[1:07:47] you on a Pew and make you just a church
[1:07:50] member if God redeemed you he didn't
[1:07:52] redeem you just to put you in a Pew and
[1:07:55] make you some cold formal intellectual
[1:07:57] but he redeemed you for a purpose he
[1:07:59] saved you for a purpose and if God is
[1:08:01] able these stones to rise children unto
[1:08:05] Abraham my God can come in this building
[1:08:07] this morning and he can take a bunch of
[1:08:09] nobodies amen and save them by his grace
[1:08:13] and fill them with his spirit and

[1:08:39] able to break addictions he's able to
[1:08:41] send Revival he's able to send to
[1:08:44] refreshing he's able to send to renewing
[1:08:46] listen have we forgot our God is able
[1:08:50] He's Able amen he's able let me say this
[1:08:53] if he's able amen then we ought to be be
[1:08:55] willing to be
[1:08:57] able come on you say preacher amen I
[1:08:59] don't know about that our God is able
[1:09:02] and if he is able we ought to be willing
[1:09:04] to be able Amen to move with the spirit
[1:09:06] of God when the spirit of God begins to
[1:09:09] move amen I love this breath amen amen
[1:09:11] breath is a sign of life you know that
[1:09:14] you know that that breath is a sign of
[1:09:15] life amen and let me say this if there
[1:09:17] is no breath amen there is no life amen
[1:09:21] if somebody fell over and you called 911
[1:09:23] and you called them up and they said hey
[1:09:25] hey we need some we need an ambulance
[1:09:26] down here you know what's the first
[1:09:28] thing they're going to say are they
[1:09:30] breathing amen are they breathing now
[1:09:32] watch what the prophet says he said now
[1:09:34] the baby is born with live muscles a
[1:09:36] beaten heart but there's no Breath of
[1:09:38] Life in it its muscles are twitching see
[1:09:41] but then see if there was something
[1:09:43] different from that if there wasn't a
[1:09:45] spirit that had come into it later then
[1:09:47] our breath could leave us and we would
[1:09:49] Breathe No More and still be alive
[1:09:51] remember he is the Creator and he giveth
[1:09:54] breath to the creation
[1:09:55] and spirit to walk therein amen now
[1:09:58] watch but when this body doesn't receive
[1:10:00] oxygen or breath watch a prophet the
[1:10:03] intake Amen in the outtake of our lungs
[1:10:06] he says then we are dead if the body
[1:10:09] does not intake
[1:10:12] oxygen and outtake then we are dead you
[1:10:16] know what the intake and outtake of your
[1:10:18] lungs is they work together Amen to
[1:10:21] bring oxygen into the body and take out
[1:10:24] carbon dioxide which is a waste product
[1:10:28] out so in other words there's some
[1:10:30] things that's got to come in but there's
[1:10:33] some things that's got to go out are you
[1:10:36] hearing me there's some things that's
[1:10:38] got to come in but then there's some
[1:10:41] things that's got to go out in other
[1:10:43] words you got to breathe in oxygen but
[1:10:45] you got to breathe out carbon dioxide
[1:10:47] can I say this to you if you only
[1:10:49] breathe in and don't breathe out you'll
[1:10:51] die are are you with me now now I'm
[1:10:53] going to bring it in the church okay
[1:10:55] because a church has got to breathe in
[1:10:57] and a church has got to breathe out if a
[1:11:00] church just breathes in breathes in
[1:11:01] breathes in amen that church will die
[1:11:04] amen because as you're breathing in some
[1:11:06] things are going to come in that don't
[1:11:08] belong amen and the only way to get them
[1:11:10] out is to breathe them out and the only
[1:11:12] one that can breathe them out amen is
[1:11:14] the word of God and when you begin to
[1:11:17] preach the message of the hour the
[1:11:19] Breath of God begins to blow across the
[1:11:21] church and it'll blow out sin it'll blow
[1:11:24] out bad ad udes it'll blow out little
[1:11:26] funny feelings it'll blow out little oh
[1:11:29] we might as well preach we're here it'll
[1:11:31] blow out all kinds of things and that's
[1:11:33] what makes a church
[1:11:36] strongl are you hearing me there's some
[1:11:38] things got to come in and there's some
[1:11:40] things got to go out can I say this
[1:11:43] we've got to inhale the promises and we
[1:11:45] got to Exhale the problems we've got to
[1:11:48] inhale the word and we got to Exhale
[1:11:50] Traditions we've got to inhale the
[1:11:52] blessings and we got to Exhale the
[1:11:54] curses we got to inhale the anointing
[1:11:57] and we got to Exhale the spirit of
[1:12:00] confusion come on church we got to
[1:12:02] inhale fellowship and we got to Exhale
[1:12:04] division we got to inhale vision and we
[1:12:07] got to Exhale wondering in the
[1:12:09] wilderness are you hearing me as the
[1:12:11] Church of the Living God we got to
[1:12:13] breathe in some things but we got to
[1:12:15] breathe out some things amen come on
[1:12:17] spoken word are you want to be a strong
[1:12:19] church are you wanting to keep on moving
[1:12:21] forward are you wanting to still believe
[1:12:23] the promises of God then start breathing
[1:12:26] again come on start breathing again amen
[1:12:29] breathe out all the confusion breathe
[1:12:31] out all that he didn't shake my hand and
[1:12:33] I don't agree with that and I don't like
[1:12:35] that breathe all that out and let the
[1:12:37] wind of God come back in the church
[1:12:39] again until our young people can breathe
[1:12:42] until our musicians can breathe until
[1:12:44] our preachers can breathe until our
[1:12:46] singers can breathe we need the power of
[1:12:49] the Holy Ghost to come in the Dynamics
[1:12:52] of the resurrection and breathe over the
[1:12:54] church again until we can see God in the
[1:12:57] power of His word I'm talking about
[1:12:59] breathing I'm talking about breathing
[1:13:02] I'm talking about breathing I'm I might
[1:13:05] as well preach I'm here amen if you're
[1:13:06] going to breathe you know what the next
[1:13:08] thing breath is connected to it's
[1:13:10] connected to
[1:13:14] praise breath is connected to praise my
[1:13:18] Bible says amen let
[1:13:21] everything that ha breath praise ye the
[1:13:25] Lord you know what the prophet of God
[1:13:26] said in think of man's filter he said
[1:13:28] Grant Lord that we may know how that we
[1:13:31] should give you praise it's beyond our
[1:13:34] understanding to know how to give you
[1:13:37] praise listen but when the spirit of
[1:13:39] insiration comes when God begins to
[1:13:42] breathe amen there will be an
[1:13:45] understanding that will come in the
[1:13:46] church I say this let everything that
[1:13:50] hath breath amen praise ye the Lord

[1:15:14] ought to praise God we ought to worship
[1:15:16] him we ought to bless his name I'm

[1:15:35] there and who was preaching and who
[1:15:37] wasn't preaching and who was singing
[1:15:39] amen we were just happy Amen to be in
[1:15:41] the number one more time we would sing

[1:15:47] happened amen some problems come in and
[1:15:50] some situations come in and we let those
[1:15:52] things shut up our praise and up our
[1:15:55] worship but you know what I say today I
[1:15:57] say it's time to let a stick of the Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost Dynamite amen droing the church
[1:16:02] again and blow all the channels out
[1:16:05] until a praise can arise from the seat
[1:16:08] of

[1:16:13] going to say this to you there's some
[1:16:15] things amen that the only thing going to
[1:16:17] get you through is praise there's some

[1:16:31] wants us to back up and quit but you
[1:16:33] know what I believe it's time to do I
[1:16:35] believe it's time to praise God like
[1:16:37] we've never praised him before I think
[1:16:39] it's time to bless his name I think it's
[1:16:41] time to love his word I think it's time
[1:16:43] to love his people I think it's time to
[1:16:46] serve the anointing I think it's time

[1:19:41] his word come on when the anointing
[1:19:43] Moves In You amen that's not a feeling

[1:19:54] another if don't let it out you'll hurt
[1:19:55] yourself amen so you just got to let it

[1:20:02] that's the truth preacher what are you
[1:20:03] doing it's God rejoicing in his people
[1:20:07] to his
[1:20:09] word I love what brother says here he
[1:20:12] said God rejoices in his people he said
[1:20:14] let them of the learn say
[1:20:18] Amen only a Kentucky Prophet can say
[1:20:21] that let them of the Learned Say Amen
[1:20:24] when anything is said
[1:20:27] right now don't get mad at me but when
[1:20:30] Hatty R heard the word she didn't
[1:20:35] nod and she didn't
[1:20:38] wink come on church and she didn't give
[1:20:41] a thumbs up come on Sir she didn't she
[1:20:43] didn't bow her head or raise her hand or
[1:20:45] clap her she said that ain't
[1:20:48] nothing but the truth are you hearing me
[1:20:51] in other words there was something on
[1:20:53] the inside of her that responded to the
[1:20:56] word and the amen come out and there was
[1:20:59] an agreement between what she was
[1:21:01] hearing amen and the manifestation of
[1:21:03] the miracle listen can I say this amens
[1:21:05] are a powerful thing in the house of God
[1:21:08] you you want to change the atmosphere of
[1:21:10] a church amen just get you about two
[1:21:12] good amen
[1:21:14] or and let one say amen and another say
[1:21:18] amen and before long somebody else will
[1:21:20] say amen and then somebody else will say
[1:21:23] are you hearing me amen be a whole
[1:21:25] church amen of amens you know what that
[1:21:28] means that means so be it come on church
[1:21:31] when the word Goes Forth and you say
[1:21:33] amen amen stands for finality amen
[1:21:36] stands for so be it amen stands for the
[1:21:39] way it's been spoken is the way it shall
[1:21:41] be and this word is being preached to
[1:21:44] you unaltered amen not decayed not sour
[1:21:48] you ought to say Amen when the preacher
[1:21:50] says the seven seal is open you ought to
[1:21:53] say Amen when he says our God is a
[1:21:55] redeemer you ought to say Amen when he
[1:21:57] says our God Is A Healer you ought to
[1:21:59] say Amen when he says our God is a
[1:22:02] deliver you ought to say Amen I'm
[1:22:05] talking about bring back
[1:22:09] amens to the house of God I was
[1:22:11] preaching over Jason Watkins one time I
[1:22:13] made a statement I said make Holiness
[1:22:15] great again you know brother Jason said
[1:22:16] we going to make some hats like that you
[1:22:18] know what I say this morning I say make

[1:22:22] again are you hearing me amen and bring
[1:22:24] back amens to the house of God they
[1:22:27] belong in the house of God well brother
[1:22:29] andw we got to be real quiet and we
[1:22:31] can't say much well well where else are
[1:22:33] you going to say
[1:22:36] Amen well brother Andy you know the
[1:22:38] house of God ain't a place to cut up
[1:22:40] well where else are you going to cut
[1:22:44] up glory to God brother you know the
[1:22:47] house of God we got to you know we just
[1:22:49] got to we just got to stay real bound is
[1:22:51] that what you're trying to tell
[1:22:52] me no no Liberation has
[1:22:57] come the word is The Liberation listen
[1:23:01] when you hear the word agree with it now
[1:23:04] you say brother you're getting the way
[1:23:06] out there well brother brand preaches a
[1:23:07] beautiful sermon and calls it
[1:23:08] Blasphemous names brother begins to
[1:23:10] teach on this thought of breath and when
[1:23:13] he opens this thought he says now I'm
[1:23:14] going to correct the Jehovah Witness
[1:23:16] teaching he said because they believe
[1:23:18] that the breath you breathe is the soul
[1:23:20] he said that's not right he said now the
[1:23:22] breath is wind and wind is what you
[1:23:24] breathe into your nostrils then he goes
[1:23:25] to Genesis 2 speaking of Adam he said
[1:23:29] but what God did was he breathed the
[1:23:31] breath of eternal life amen then he
[1:23:35] became a living Soul see a soul that
[1:23:38] cannot
[1:23:40] die now watch notice breathe the breath
[1:23:43] of eternal life into his nostrils and he
[1:23:45] became an eternal Soul cuse God breathed
[1:23:48] not what nature done but what God did
[1:23:50] see breathed the breath of life into his
[1:23:53] nostrils and he become a living Soul
[1:23:56] well then you say to me Adam died
[1:23:57] brother brandom but remember before Adam
[1:24:00] died he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:24:03] Hallelujah those he forne he is called
[1:24:06] he got a lamb to redeem them he was a
[1:24:09] type amen Adam failed and the lamb was
[1:24:11] provided for Adam because already in his
[1:24:13] nostrils I love this already in his
[1:24:16] nostrils had be come on now had become
[1:24:21] the breath of the Eternal God and he
[1:24:23] become a living Soul he was a Son of God
[1:24:27] he said not his breath as the African
[1:24:29] word which is amoia he said now see that
[1:24:31] means the wind or the Unseen Force he
[1:24:34] said animals breathe them Oya and
[1:24:36] sinners breathe them Oya he said but God
[1:24:38] especially upon Adam he breathe the
[1:24:41] breath of eternal life and he become an
[1:24:43] eternal person with God he had power
[1:24:46] like God he was an amateur God he was
[1:24:49] God of the earth not God Of Heaven now
[1:24:51] God of the earth and so here it is and
[1:24:54] someday amen the sons of God will again
[1:24:58] become Gods that's why the devil hates
[1:25:01] amen the preaching of this message is
[1:25:03] because it is the breathing of the
[1:25:05] Eternal God coming over the Church of
[1:25:08] God listen and as he breathes you're
[1:25:10] becoming gods of the earth Jesus said is
[1:25:14] it not written in your law ye are Gods
[1:25:16] then if you can call those who he called
[1:25:17] God who God visited how can you condemn
[1:25:20] me see when I say I am the Son of God
[1:25:23] then may I announce to you this morning
[1:25:25] amen that you are the true church amen
[1:25:27] the sons of God Amen and you are born
[1:25:30] amen by the Breath of God the church is
[1:25:33] the mystical Body of Christ born amen of
[1:25:36] the Breath of God the Church of God is
[1:25:38] born of the Breath of God God Brea in
[1:25:40] the nostril spiritually of Adam he
[1:25:42] become a living Soul did you know the
[1:25:44] Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal
[1:25:46] church is born amen of the Breath of
[1:25:50] God remember read St John 20 and then he
[1:25:53] says now watch the father that sent him
[1:25:55] went in him the father that sent him
[1:25:58] went in him and Jesus when he sends a
[1:26:02] disciple he goes in him he said now the
[1:26:05] church born of the Breath of God when
[1:26:07] this stature has molded itself up there
[1:26:09] in condition God's breath breathe upon
[1:26:12] them receive you the Holy Ghost then you
[1:26:15] are a son of God you can join anything
[1:26:17] you want to but you are born into the
[1:26:20] Church of the Living God you are born by
[1:26:22] the Breath of God God breathed upon them
[1:26:25] now can I preach to you God breathed
[1:26:27] upon them and said receive
[1:26:30] ye the Holy Ghost he breathed upon them
[1:26:34] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost there
[1:26:37] you are not come and join put your name
[1:26:40] on there with your soup suppers and all
[1:26:42] that goes with you join a lodge you join
[1:26:44] a Methodist Lodge a Baptist Lodge a
[1:26:46] presbyterian Lodge a Catholic or
[1:26:48] Pentecostal Lodge anything you want to
[1:26:51] join but you join a lodge but when you
[1:26:53] become a a child of God you are born
[1:26:57] amen by the Breath of God can I say this
[1:26:59] the Church of the Living God did not
[1:27:02] join the church amen you were born in
[1:27:04] the church by the word brother said
[1:27:07] that's how we have eternal life it's
[1:27:09] because we were spoken into existence by
[1:27:12] God not joined into a church but born by
[1:27:15] the word the original seed that God said
[1:27:18] let there be and there was then the same
[1:27:21] breath that said let there be to Adam
[1:27:24] and he come to his position is the same
[1:27:26] breath that is breathing through this
[1:27:28] adoption message and is saying let there
[1:27:30] be a bride let there be a Rapture let
[1:27:33] there be a resurrection let there be a
[1:27:35] victory let there be a miracle and as he
[1:27:37] begins to breathe things begin to happen
[1:27:40] listen I believe it I believe God
[1:27:41] watches over his
[1:27:43] word I believe God watches over his word
[1:27:47] and I believe God Reveals His word now
[1:27:50] can I say this the revelation of the
[1:27:52] word is the INSP eration of the age when
[1:27:55] you see the church getting worly like it
[1:27:57] was in the days of Sodom you see the
[1:27:59] church going in the worship the God of
[1:28:01] this evil age and seeing that amen but
[1:28:03] then seeing a little minority group
[1:28:06] gathered out under the inspiration of
[1:28:08] God producing again amen the life of
[1:28:11] Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's
[1:28:14] supposed to happen you know what hour
[1:28:17] you're living in did not Jesus say no
[1:28:19] man come to me except my father draws
[1:28:22] him remember said what is it amen can
[1:28:24] can we say this together it's the word
[1:28:28] joining with the word it's the word
[1:28:32] joining with the word it can't do
[1:28:34] nothing else the word cannot join a
[1:28:37] feeling the word cannot join an emotion
[1:28:40] the word cannot join a denomination it
[1:28:42] cannot join an organization the only
[1:28:45] thing the word can join is the word in
[1:28:48] other words we are called by the
[1:28:52] word we are called
[1:28:54] by the word can I say it like this the
[1:28:56] written word amen called out to the
[1:28:59] predestinated word and there was a union
[1:29:02] between the word now can I can I can I
[1:29:04] just ask you a very a very blunt
[1:29:06] question will that be okay are we
[1:29:09] sufficiently impressed with the
[1:29:15] word are we
[1:29:18] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:29:22] said now Jesus knew there was going to
[1:29:23] be a Terri drift away from the word of
[1:29:25] the pergam church age which was yet 200
[1:29:27] years off from the Patmos fishion he
[1:29:29] knew that drift would cause them to go
[1:29:32] into the Dark Ages he knew that way man
[1:29:34] would originally get away from God was
[1:29:35] by first leaving the word now watch can
[1:29:38] I say what a prophet said if you leave
[1:29:40] that word you have left God thus he has
[1:29:44] presented himself to the church at
[1:29:46] pergamus and indeed to all Church ages I
[1:29:50] oh God I am the
[1:29:52] word it's if you want deity in your
[1:29:55] midst then welcome and receive the word
[1:29:57] don't never let anyone or anything get
[1:29:59] between you and the word this which I am
[1:30:02] giving you the word is a revelation of
[1:30:05] myself I am the word remember that then
[1:30:09] he says I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:30:12] impressed with the word in our midst let
[1:30:15] me give you a thought here how do we
[1:30:16] pray we pray in Jesus name don't we
[1:30:19] every prayer is in his name or there
[1:30:21] isn't any answer 1 John 5:14 this is the
[1:30:24] confidence we have in him that if we ask
[1:30:26] anything according to his will he
[1:30:28] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[1:30:30] us who soever we ask whatsoever we ask
[1:30:34] we know that we have the petitions that
[1:30:36] we desired of him he said now we ask
[1:30:39] what is the will of God there is only
[1:30:41] one way to know his will and that is by
[1:30:44] the word of God let me just let me just
[1:30:46] preach here for a second amen don't you
[1:30:48] take this bride amen back into following
[1:30:50] gifted men with gifts and feelings and
[1:30:53] Sensations
[1:30:54] and well brother so and so saw this
[1:30:56] brother so and so had this visitation
[1:30:58] brother so and so had this word amen we
[1:31:00] have got the Vindicated absolute
[1:31:03] authority of the word of God Amen it's
[1:31:05] an absolute and we ought to tie Our
[1:31:07] Lives to it come on we might as well
[1:31:09] preach here come on a we ought to tie
[1:31:11] Our Lives to it and stand on the word of
[1:31:14] God and let the devil back up but don't
[1:31:17] you ever back off of this
[1:31:20] message well brother Andrew it's brother
[1:31:22] so H God we will preach well we're here
[1:31:25] hadn't we well brother Andrew brother so
[1:31:26] and so but but listen amen if a prophet
[1:31:29] taught something amen either say what he
[1:31:32] said come on say what he said or just
[1:31:35] tell us you don't believe what he said
[1:31:37] so we can move
[1:31:39] on is that okay well brother Andrew we
[1:31:43] believe the message but we're going to
[1:31:44] do something different here talk this
[1:31:46] but we're going to let this well come on
[1:31:48] church amen I've done come through too
[1:31:50] many trials somebody day they spender
[1:31:53] you ought to back up a little bit you
[1:31:55] know amen preaching that message so
[1:31:56] strong is the absolute I said if I back
[1:31:58] up now I owe Brothers phone calls to
[1:32:01] apologize amen for standing with this
[1:32:03] message against their ideas and against
[1:32:06] their Traditions but I will never
[1:32:08] apologize for standing with what the
[1:32:10] seventh angel taught it's the Vindicated
[1:32:13] absolute of this generation and I will
[1:32:15] not back off of it for nobody nowhere no
[1:32:18] time under any circumstances because I
[1:32:21] want to see real Miracles I want to see
[1:32:23] real gifts I want to see real
[1:32:25] manifestation but the only way it's
[1:32:28] going to come is by the
[1:32:31] word well we might as well preach for
[1:32:33] here are we sufficiently impressed with
[1:32:37] the word in our midst who is he that
[1:32:40] saith and it come to pass when the Lord
[1:32:42] commandeth it not there it is if it
[1:32:44] isn't in the word then you cannot have
[1:32:47] it so we cannot ask unless it's in the
[1:32:49] word and we cannot petition or ask
[1:32:52] unless it's in his name there it is is
[1:32:54] again Jesus the name is the word the
[1:32:56] will and you cannot separate God and the
[1:33:00] word they are
[1:33:06] one now then this word he is Left Behind
[1:33:08] on the printed page is a part of him so
[1:33:12] when you accept it by faith into a
[1:33:14] Spirit-filled life he said his word was
[1:33:16] life John 663 there it is he is spirit
[1:33:20] and he is life that is exactly what the
[1:33:23] word is that is exactly what Jesus is he
[1:33:27] is the word so when a spirit born
[1:33:30] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[1:33:33] word into his heart places it up on his
[1:33:35] lips while that is the same as deity
[1:33:38] speaking Every Mountain has to go amen
[1:33:42] Satan cannot stand before that man if
[1:33:44] the church way back there in that third
[1:33:46] age had only held on to the revelation
[1:33:48] of the Living Word in their midst the
[1:33:51] power of God would not have faded as it
[1:33:53] did in those Dark Ages but right today
[1:33:55] when the church right today right today
[1:33:58] when the church returns to the word and
[1:34:01] faith we can say without doubt that the
[1:34:03] glory of God and the wonderful acts of
[1:34:06] God will be in her midst again come on
[1:34:10] church he did not say are we
[1:34:12] sufficiently impressed with signs he
[1:34:15] said are we sufficiently impressed with
[1:34:17] the word but although we believe in
[1:34:21] signs right we don't dismiss there signs
[1:34:24] we believe in signs but we don't follow
[1:34:28] signs you say preacher why because signs
[1:34:31] can be impersonated but the word cannot
[1:34:35] be impersonated somebody say well
[1:34:37] brother Andrew we just need some gifted
[1:34:39] brother to come speak over us or or just
[1:34:41] see something or prophesy or discern us
[1:34:43] amen amen come on Church we're not a
[1:34:45] bunch of Pentecostal babies amen
[1:34:47] wondering through Pentecost trying to
[1:34:49] find the direction we have had a messiah
[1:34:51] sign that is coming this generation
[1:34:54] and it spoke the word of God and it
[1:34:56] didn't miss one time can I preach
[1:34:58] brother Wade it didn't miss one time you
[1:35:01] could put it under any kind of pressure
[1:35:03] you wanted to but it never missed you
[1:35:05] can listen to 8,000 sermons rather 8,000
[1:35:08] discernments and never hear one time
[1:35:11] where somebody said that's wrong or you
[1:35:13] missed it there and I'll say this
[1:35:15] without any hesitation any man that
[1:35:18] claims to have the discernment of the
[1:35:19] Messiah side is a false prophet and he
[1:35:22] ought to sit down and of the thing
[1:35:24] because there was one gift to an age
[1:35:26] there was one Messiah signed to an age
[1:35:29] and I refused to follow any carnal
[1:35:31] impersonation of the Vindicated
[1:35:34] manifestation of the return of the
[1:35:36] Messiah to this
[1:35:38] generation you say preacher you're
[1:35:39] getting way out there I'm passionate
[1:35:41] about these things we've had enough
[1:35:43] confusion it's time for some direction
[1:35:46] it's time for some clarity it's time to
[1:35:48] move
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:51] forward brother Ander brother you don't
[1:35:54] understand no I do understand there's
[1:35:55] one thing the devil cannot impersonate
[1:35:57] and that's the
[1:35:58] word right now you know why people back
[1:36:01] off the word and go back to gifts don't
[1:36:03] you it's because they're really not in
[1:36:05] love with the
[1:36:07] word because there sometimes you just
[1:36:09] got to go to church and preach and you
[1:36:11] don't get a shout
[1:36:14] meeting you can clean it up when I leave
[1:36:17] wait there's sometimes you don't have a
[1:36:20] shout meeting but you just got to stand
[1:36:22] there and lay the H him but do you see
[1:36:24] where Pentecost failed is they couldn't
[1:36:26] take a good word service they couldn't
[1:36:29] satisfy oh God honey go start the van
[1:36:32] they couldn't satisfy and then they
[1:36:34] could not be satisfied with the word of
[1:36:37] God so they said well he's he's here
[1:36:39] somebody get on the drums he's here
[1:36:41] let's dance the devil out he's here
[1:36:42] let's shout the devil out amen but
[1:36:44] listen Jesus didn't shout the devil down
[1:36:46] he didn't dance the devil down he put
[1:36:48] the word against that devil and defeated
[1:36:51] the devil on the
[1:36:52] word Hallelujah and if we're going to
[1:36:55] defeat the Devil we got to come back to
[1:36:57] the word you say preacher you don't
[1:36:58] believe in shouting yes I believe in
[1:37:00] shouting yes I believe in dancing amen
[1:37:03] but let the word have the preeminence of
[1:37:04] our shout and let the word have the
[1:37:06] preeminence of our dance and let the
[1:37:08] word be the reason why that we shake for
[1:37:10] singles off the roof because the word
[1:37:13] has come into our midst and there's
[1:37:15] deity in our midst there's Mountain
[1:37:17] Moving faith in our midst come on
[1:37:19] church I'm I'm I'm trying to tell you
[1:37:21] something anchor yourself to to the
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] word can I share something say well
[1:37:30] brother we need a prophec here we need a
[1:37:31] we need a gift we need somebody to
[1:37:33] prophesy over us I remember one time I
[1:37:34] was I was in a service and there was a
[1:37:36] situation in the church you know a guy
[1:37:38] got up and there was there was a
[1:37:39] musician in the church he had left the
[1:37:40] church

[1:37:47] my servant he shall return and play this
[1:37:49] instrument he called the instrument went
[1:37:51] through all these things he said he
[1:37:52] shall turn that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:37:54] you know I said well all I can say is
[1:37:57] what the prophet said if it's thus
[1:37:58] sayith the Lord it'll be thus and if
[1:37:59] it's not the man's got a Lon Spirit on
[1:38:02] him see brother Bob I may be young but I
[1:38:04] remember when we gave than the word
[1:38:07] test I remember when we used to check
[1:38:10] things by the message and not by the
[1:38:12] person saying
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:17] it I remember when we used to take it
[1:38:20] back to the tapes and say that's right
[1:38:22] or that's wrong but now we say well it's
[1:38:24] brother so and so so it's right or it's
[1:38:26] sister so and so so it's right amen let
[1:38:28] me say this on record brother so and
[1:38:30] so's wrong and sister so and so's wrong
[1:38:33] and the message of the hour is
[1:38:36] right I don't care who it is the message
[1:38:40] of the hour is
[1:38:42] right come on somebody get something
[1:38:45] says I have church say amen and some
[1:38:49] says well that's say for you know I cut
[1:38:52] it off amen amen amen now
[1:38:55] watch I lost it my ear he said like this
[1:38:58] he says now that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:39:01] he said now watch he said he'll come
[1:39:03] back okay we're just going to believe
[1:39:05] him take him you know that's that say
[1:39:07] the Lord so so somebody comes along you
[1:39:09] know and they say well brother we want
[1:39:11] to play this instrument they said no you
[1:39:13] can't play that instrument there's a
[1:39:14] prophecy over it you
[1:39:16] know said you can't play that there was
[1:39:18] a prophecy over that so they said well
[1:39:20] well well why not and they said well
[1:39:21] this been prophesied this brother's
[1:39:22] coming back to play
[1:39:25] so the brother was living in one state
[1:39:26] and about two weeks later the people
[1:39:28] hear that the brother's moving to about
[1:39:30] three states
[1:39:32] away they get up and they say you know
[1:39:34] brother so ando's moving out of state I
[1:39:36] think we ought to have a meeting about
[1:39:37] selling this
[1:39:40] instrument hold it I thought you had
[1:39:44] thus sayith the
[1:39:45] Lord I don't care if he moves to 10 Buck
[1:39:48] two I don't care if he moves to Outer
[1:39:51] Space if you have the sayith the Lord
[1:39:54] you leave it there and the boy's going
[1:39:56] to come back and play it but what you
[1:39:59] have is somebody's impression and not
[1:40:01] thus sayith the Lord but thank God in
[1:40:03] the last days we have come back to thus
[1:40:06] sayith the Lord without Impressions
[1:40:08] without feelings we have a clear thus
[1:40:11] sayith the Lord from the
[1:40:13] message we have it is written now
[1:40:16] brother said like this he said we
[1:40:18] believe in signs amen but are we
[1:40:20] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:40:22] our midst now let me say this to you
[1:40:24] remember said the thousands he said I
[1:40:26] with thousands of sign workers in this
[1:40:28] last day has created are you hearing me
[1:40:31] has created a generation of sign Seekers
[1:40:34] so whatever you're creating is what
[1:40:37] you're responsible to keep
[1:40:41] alive he created the earth and the
[1:40:44] things therein and he breathed into the
[1:40:46] creation and give a spirit to walk in it
[1:40:49] God is responsible for this message but
[1:40:52] can I say this he's not responsible for
[1:40:55] anything outside of this
[1:41:00] message so if you start a direction I
[1:41:02] don't know why I'm here but I'm
[1:41:03] preaching if you start a direction apart
[1:41:06] from the message you better make sure
[1:41:07] you got enough to keep it alive 20 years
[1:41:09] down the road because God will not
[1:41:11] sustain it but this message has been
[1:41:14] here for years and it still as fresh
[1:41:16] today as it was when it was put on tape
[1:41:19] you know why because God backs this
[1:41:22] message yes
[1:41:24] amen now how can you tell them give them
[1:41:26] the word test how can you know it speak
[1:41:28] the word see what they say about it if
[1:41:30] they don't believe the word they have no
[1:41:32] seed germ in
[1:41:34] them they are of the evil one and
[1:41:36] deceive you and the first bride was
[1:41:38] deceived the second bride was deceived
[1:41:40] they are deceivers of the third bride by
[1:41:42] high breing the word or trying to do so
[1:41:44] listen God never placed signs ahead of
[1:41:48] his
[1:41:49] word he said that's a scorcher God never
[1:41:52] plac sign ahead of his word they oh they
[1:41:56] were added for the proof of the
[1:41:59] word ready for this but the word was
[1:42:04] first to prove that Elijah said the
[1:42:07] woman make me a cake first then watch
[1:42:09] the miracle happened see come to the
[1:42:11] word first and then watch the miracle
[1:42:15] the seed word itself is what the Holy
[1:42:18] Spirit energizes see then the pr of God
[1:42:20] said where does the miracle take place
[1:42:22] you begin to believe God's word and then
[1:42:25] the miracle takes place on the word
[1:42:27] because the word is the seed that brings
[1:42:30] forth a miracle you got to take the word
[1:42:33] first the holy spirit gives it life like
[1:42:36] water falling from Heaven I I never can
[1:42:39] talk about signs and wonders without
[1:42:41] thinking about Danny steon one time
[1:42:43] brother Danny was preaching a youth camp
[1:42:45] I was in it probably last year I was a
[1:42:46] camper there and he got two boys on the
[1:42:48] front row and he said now I'm going to
[1:42:50] rename you he said your signs and your
[1:42:52] wonders
[1:42:53] that's right he said I'm the believer he
[1:42:56] said now follow me Mark 16 says signs
[1:43:00] and wonders shall follow them that
[1:43:03] believe brother Danny took off walking
[1:43:05] and here was signs and wonders they took
[1:43:07] off walking you know what he never did
[1:43:09] Brother Wade he never stopped and looked
[1:43:11] back to see if they was
[1:43:14] there he never got down and had a prayer
[1:43:17] meeting to make sure signs and wonders
[1:43:19] was there he just took off walking as a
[1:43:21] Believer and signs and wonders followed
[1:43:26] him
[1:43:28] hallu I love it he said if I speak speed
[1:43:31] up they speed up if I slow down they
[1:43:34] slow down I love this one he walked off
[1:43:37] the platform into a dark room and he
[1:43:39] said if I go in dark places they go with
[1:43:42] me are you hearing me we are word
[1:43:45] Believers we're not following signs and
[1:43:48] wonders signs and wonders are following
[1:43:50] the
[1:43:51] word can I give you another illustration
[1:43:54] amen and listen we don't F we don't
[1:43:56] follow signs of wonders because they
[1:43:58] don't have the direction the word sets
[1:44:00] the
[1:44:04] direction now I'll say this to you what
[1:44:07] we got to do is unclog the channel and
[1:44:10] let the word move in and when the word
[1:44:13] moves in then the devil can't move
[1:44:15] us watch this when you know you've done
[1:44:18] exactly what God told you to do then
[1:44:20] wait for the channel of inspiration to
[1:44:21] open up to you and now I'm Healed when
[1:44:24] it drops in there then it's all over see
[1:44:26] you don't need no prayer lines or
[1:44:28] nothing else it's over it's been
[1:44:30] revealed to you why do we follow the
[1:44:33] word because the word cannot be
[1:44:35] impersonated in other words look at
[1:44:37] Simeon now Simeon received a revelation
[1:44:41] I will not die until I have seen the
[1:44:43] Lord's Christ you know what the prod of
[1:44:45] God said he said nothing could shake him
[1:44:48] it was revealed to him Simeon come to
[1:44:50] the temple at the T at the minute walked
[1:44:52] over and give praise to God now what did
[1:44:54] he say let thy servant amen depart in
[1:44:57] peace when he picked up the baby mine
[1:44:59] eyes have seen my salvation see he
[1:45:01] knowed he was going to see it can I show
[1:45:04] you why we don't follow signs and
[1:45:06] wonders we don't follow anything but the
[1:45:08] word brother said no matter how many
[1:45:10] babies he would visit each day he knew
[1:45:13] that God had revealed to him he was
[1:45:16] going to see the Christ before he
[1:45:20] died hallelujah amen so you could have
[1:45:23] put a baby in simeon's arm and he knew
[1:45:24] it wasn't the
[1:45:27] one you could have put a baby in
[1:45:30] simeon's arm and said here Simeon you're
[1:45:32] getting old buddy you you just need to
[1:45:34] just accept this and go on but Simeon
[1:45:36] had a revelation by the word and he knew
[1:45:40] that when the Revelation come into
[1:45:42] manifestation there would be a direct
[1:45:45] Revelation in his heart and would say
[1:45:47] that's it are you hearing me listen
[1:45:50] friends said job he had I'm coming down
[1:45:53] now he had a way of moving himself out
[1:45:56] and let the word of God move in remember
[1:45:58] said I've often said the greatest enemy
[1:46:00] I've got is William Brandon he's the one
[1:46:02] that gets in God's way he's the one that
[1:46:04] gets lazy he's the one that gets to a
[1:46:06] place sometimes he can thinks he can do
[1:46:08] something about it and when he does that
[1:46:09] shes God right out of the picture but
[1:46:11] when I can get rid of that
[1:46:14] guy when I can get to a place that he's
[1:46:18] out of the way then God can come over
[1:46:21] and do things that will Willam brandom
[1:46:23] knows nothing about that's when God can
[1:46:27] use you when he can use any of us he can
[1:46:30] use somebody when we get out of the way
[1:46:33] when we listen when we get ourselves out
[1:46:35] of the way then the inspired word moves
[1:46:38] in and does things proba to God said now
[1:46:40] listen oh it's a great thing to come up
[1:46:43] here and preach a
[1:46:45] gospel that can make people actually
[1:46:48] that was once bootleggers and gamblers
[1:46:50] and prostitutes and everything else had
[1:46:52] don't the street amen sit in Heavenly
[1:46:55] places in Christ Jesus are you ready for
[1:46:58] this and can feel the inspiration of the
[1:47:01] spirit amen rise you to a place Till You
[1:47:04] Lose
[1:47:06] Yourself amen till you lose yourself and
[1:47:10] scream out amen hallelujah praises to

[1:47:17] youall something if that's a wonderful
[1:47:19] thing why have we made it such a
[1:47:20] negative thing why have we made it such
[1:47:22] a embarrassing thing why they made it
[1:47:24] such a bad thing we need to lose
[1:47:27] ourselves church until the spirit of God
[1:47:30] can find a right away in the church and
[1:47:32] can raise us to a
[1:47:34] place Hallelujah come on we need to lose
[1:47:37] ourselves we need to lose our ideas we

[1:50:53] you know what I found I'm just going to
[1:50:55] say it I'm just going to let it out you
[1:50:57] know what I found I found sometimes that
[1:50:59] some of the greatest praisers you got in
[1:51:00] the church are the most Warrior people
[1:51:02] you got in the church they've been
[1:51:04] through more than you could calculate in
[1:51:06] your mind they've been through more
[1:51:07] troubles and disappointments and let
[1:51:13] downs and here's the miracle after
[1:51:15] everything they've been through they
[1:51:17] still got their
[1:51:21] praise after every situation they still
[1:51:24] got their praise after every bad day
[1:51:27] they still got their praise I was over I
[1:51:29] was over in England one time preaching
[1:51:30] for brother Crosby brother brother
[1:51:32] brother uh brother Crosby there in
[1:51:34] Lester England and there was a couple
[1:51:35] sitting on the front row brother sister
[1:51:37] Taffy is their name brother brother
[1:51:39] sister Taffy Elders in the church sister
[1:51:40] Taffy she probably I don't know she's
[1:51:42] probably 75 80 I don't know how old she
[1:51:43] is she's she's just a pillar in the
[1:51:45] house of God just a a prayer Warrior
[1:51:48] well I was preaching while I preach amen
[1:51:50] it' be real quiet you know and I'd say
[1:51:52] something she'd stand up she'd say
[1:51:56] hallelujah and then she'd do this little
[1:51:58] walk brother Wade you know up the pull
[1:52:00] pit and she'd put her hand up and she'd
[1:52:02] shake my hand you know and she' turn
[1:52:03] around she'd go back and sit down she'
[1:52:05] get her Bible back out she'd sit there
[1:52:06] for a few minutes and I'd get to preach
[1:52:08] and you know and the church be on fire
[1:52:10] and I'd hit a point and she'd stand up
[1:52:11] right against you go
[1:52:14] Hallelujah walk up there and shake my
[1:52:16] hand so after service I said brother
[1:52:18] brother Crosby I got to know her story
[1:52:20] he said brother Andrew he said she used
[1:52:21] to never act like like that he said she
[1:52:23] used to come to church and just sit
[1:52:25] there in a in that quiet formal mode he
[1:52:27] said but one day she got in a car wreck
[1:52:29] and she about died and he said God come
[1:52:31] on the scene and healed her and brought
[1:52:33] her back to life he said now we cannot
[1:52:35] contain her in the house of
[1:52:40] God come on Church listen if you won't
[1:52:43] praise him he'll get the rocks to praise
[1:52:45] him if you won't bless his name he'll
[1:52:48] get the rocks to bless his name but God
[1:52:50] forbid there ever come a time that a
[1:52:52] rock has to take our place may we lose
[1:52:55] ourselves and say God I thank you for
[1:52:57] everything that you brought me through I
[1:53:00] thank you for every trial I thank you
[1:53:02] for every Victory I thank you
[1:53:05] Lord she said Glory Hallelujah he said
[1:53:08] mother you're beginning to act like
[1:53:09] those
[1:53:10] people said now listen son looked at his
[1:53:13] mother and said mama said Mark 16's not
[1:53:16] inspired he said mother why you begin to
[1:53:18] act like that she saidwell son I just
[1:53:21] got to thinking
[1:53:23] if God could heal me with that which is
[1:53:28] uninspired he said then what could he do
[1:53:30] with that which is really
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:34] inspiring I'm talking about see and a
[1:53:38] prophet comes along and says Mark 16 is
[1:53:41] just as inspired as John 3:16 sir amen
[1:53:44] see what I'm getting at church is this
[1:53:47] in the last days Satan is going to begin
[1:53:50] to blow his foul and P poisonous
[1:53:53] breath I don't have time to read it to
[1:53:55] you but I'm going to say this and I'm
[1:53:56] going to tie this together whenever
[1:53:59] Satan blows on something he's trying to
[1:54:01] sink
[1:54:03] it he blew on the disciples he blew on
[1:54:05] the ship he was trying to sink it but
[1:54:08] can I turn that and say whenever God
[1:54:10] breathes or blows up on something he's
[1:54:14] trying to raise
[1:54:15] it now what happens in the natural
[1:54:19] happens in the spiritual you ever heard
[1:54:20] of something called the Clean Air Act
[1:54:22] yeah the Clean Air Act you know before
[1:54:25] the Clean Air Act nobody cared anything
[1:54:27] about how long your exhaust was on your
[1:54:31] truck you know what I'm talking about
[1:54:33] brother you go in a building and you
[1:54:34] weren't worried about the smoke and the
[1:54:35] smell and but after the Clean Air Act
[1:54:38] what it was was United States primary
[1:54:40] Federal air quality law intended to
[1:54:42] reduce and control air population
[1:54:44] Nationwide now This Clean Air Act
[1:54:47] because you got to breathe right you got
[1:54:49] to breathe so the Act was to improve and
[1:54:52] to strengthen and to accelerate programs
[1:54:55] for the prevention and the abandonment
[1:54:57] of air
[1:54:58] pollution so the whole reason they come
[1:55:01] up with this Clean Air Act was to
[1:55:03] improve the air quality so when you went
[1:55:05] in a place or you were somewhere you had
[1:55:08] a right by the Clean Air Act to breathe
[1:55:11] clean air without pollution I got to
[1:55:14] think about that brother Wade and I
[1:55:16] looked it up do you know when that act
[1:55:18] was initially enacted in 1963
[1:55:23] Amen in 1963 in the natural they're
[1:55:28] already thinking if People's going to
[1:55:30] survive if they're going to live we got
[1:55:32] to clean up the air we got to get all
[1:55:35] the pollution out can I say this at the
[1:55:37] same time the America government is
[1:55:40] establishing a Clean Air Act amen a
[1:55:43] prophet is standing on the earth and
[1:55:44] he's opening up the word in the
[1:55:49] church at the same time they're cleaning
[1:55:52] the air up in the restaurants they're
[1:55:53] cleaning the air up in Airplane they're
[1:55:55] cleaning the air up everywhere a prophet
[1:55:57] is standing in the pull pit and he's
[1:55:59] opened the word and you know what he's
[1:56:01] doing by the opening of the word he's
[1:56:03] improving the air quality in the church
[1:56:06] in other words we now have a filter
[1:56:10] listen for years it was full of
[1:56:12] pollution it was full of three gods and
[1:56:15] woman preachers and tongues is the
[1:56:17] evidence and false gifts and false
[1:56:19] interpretation but when a prophet stood
[1:56:22] there and begin to preach the open of
[1:56:24] the word it brought a filter in the
[1:56:26] church and the message removed the
[1:56:28] pollution from the church listen friends
[1:56:30] Amen in the days of the son of man being
[1:56:32] revealed it would be a day of pollution
[1:56:34] it would be moral immoral amen pollution
[1:56:37] just the same way but listen the message
[1:56:39] would seem to be the world of fanaticism
[1:56:41] but the Holy Ghost would come down in
[1:56:43] the church and the pollution would go
[1:56:45] out and there would be clean air
[1:56:47] returned among the church where the
[1:56:49] bride could breathe clean air again
[1:56:55] so now you don't have to intake and just
[1:56:58] intake pollution intake pollution intake
[1:57:01] pollution but now there's a filter in
[1:57:04] the house of
[1:57:06] God the church can breathe again come on
[1:57:10] Church you know what I'm talking about
[1:57:11] I'm talking about you can come to church
[1:57:13] and you don't have to worry about not
[1:57:15] saying amen or should I agree with that
[1:57:17] or should I agree with this amen if
[1:57:19] they're preaching the message amen it's
[1:57:21] an air filter in the church and if it's
[1:57:23] the message you got a right to breathe
[1:57:25] it in if it's the message you got a
[1:57:27] right to agree with
[1:57:29] it I may say well brother andyw you're
[1:57:31] getting a little strong on that message
[1:57:33] you're exactly right because it's the
[1:57:35] filter of the
[1:57:36] church now let me say this to you when
[1:57:40] God breathes on something he's going to
[1:57:42] raise
[1:57:43] it John 20:22 the Bible said when he had
[1:57:46] said this he breathed on them and said
[1:57:48] receive ye the holy ghost look at this
[1:57:52] breathe it is to blow or breathe upon
[1:57:54] where Jesus after the manner of the
[1:57:55] Hebrew prophets expressed by the
[1:57:57] symbolic Act of breathing upon the
[1:57:59] apostles the communication of the power
[1:58:01] of the Holy Spirit to them this word
[1:58:04] used only once by the translators in
[1:58:06] Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam
[1:58:09] and he became a living Soul now can I
[1:58:11] can I close on this point just as the
[1:58:13] original creation was
[1:58:16] completed right by an act of God so the
[1:58:20] new creation was complete completed by
[1:58:22] an act from the head of the New Creation
[1:58:26] in other words in the first creation he
[1:58:28] completed it by breathing upon Adam and
[1:58:31] he became a living soul but here the
[1:58:33] Bible says in the new creation the head
[1:58:36] of the new creation will once again
[1:58:39] breathe upon that creation and that will
[1:58:41] be the completion of that creation but
[1:58:45] said listen he's creating his own bride
[1:58:47] justification of Luther sanctification
[1:58:49] of Wesley see the evolution of a spirit
[1:58:52] being given more and more because the
[1:58:53] body is building amen coming to the head
[1:58:56] which is Christ the body of Christ
[1:58:59] another place then a new creation not to
[1:59:01] denomination but to the word you are a
[1:59:03] creation of the word remember said see
[1:59:05] in the church age book what is it it's
[1:59:07] the creation of God can I say this to
[1:59:09] you and I'm done now the breath and the
[1:59:13] spirit has become the same in The
[1:59:17] Bride come on church when God breathed
[1:59:20] upon Adam he put Authority Adam and Adam
[1:59:23] could say son stand still he could say
[1:59:25] tree uproot and go here he could say
[1:59:27] line calm down he could say wind calm
[1:59:30] down he can say when pick up are you
[1:59:32] hearing me in the last days there will
[1:59:35] be a second Eve who is married to the
[1:59:37] second Adam and the part of God said now
[1:59:39] the breath and the spirit has become the
[1:59:41] same she is uniting together bringing
[1:59:44] forth that same powerful blow of the
[1:59:47] Holy Ghost like he did back there and is
[1:59:50] manifesting the same works that it back
[1:59:52] there is being manifested right here
[1:59:58] today in
[2:00:02] you somebody's got to breathe
[2:00:05] again somebody's got to breathe again
[2:00:08] can these bones live
[2:00:10] again there's a valley of dry bones can
[2:00:14] they live again Lord can they live
[2:00:17] against son of man now knowest what are
[2:00:19] you going to do he said prophesy son of
[2:00:21] man he said so I prophesied as I was
[2:00:24] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[2:00:27] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[2:00:29] bones came together now watch this if
[2:00:31] you got a valley of dry bones and

[2:00:39] John's bones amen and now Jim's got a
[2:00:41] leg bone and John's got a backbone the
[2:00:44] Bible does not say when the Ezekiel blew
[2:00:46] across the bones that the bone come to
[2:00:49] Bone but this was a this was an original
[2:00:55] restoration the Bible says that bone
[2:00:58] came to his bone so Jim didn't get
[2:01:01] John's backbone and John didn't get
[2:01:03] Jim's leg bone but Jim got Jim's
[2:01:05] backbone and John got John's leg bone

[2:18:15] thing that fixes a
[2:18:17] misunderstanding is an understanding
[2:18:21] can I share this with you y'all remember
[2:18:23] brother Brandon we we quote it brother
[2:18:24] way we quote it by heart House of Hell
[2:18:28] give way to the name of Jesus y'all
[2:18:30] remember that remember that you know
[2:18:33] what brother BR said he said now them
[2:18:35] people was in prison right they were in
[2:18:37] they were in bars and he said they they
[2:18:39] said they come to him and said brother
[2:18:41] help these people you know what he said
[2:18:44] they misunderstood
[2:18:47] you they misunderstood him and the
[2:18:51] misunderstanding had put them in a
[2:18:53] prison and the only one that could break
[2:18:56] the prison was the one they
[2:19:01] misunderstood now in other words if me
[2:19:04] and Nate has a
[2:19:05] misunderstanding and it puts me in a
[2:19:07] prison I don't want to fellowship with
[2:19:09] Nate I don't want to talk to him I don't
[2:19:10] want to see him listen I cannot go to
[2:19:13] Wade and get the misunder understanding
[2:19:16] fixed I've got to go to the one that I
[2:19:19] misunderstood and I've got to let there
[2:19:22] come a
[2:19:23] humility and an agreement and an
[2:19:26] understanding come and then brother BR
[2:19:28] said now look he turned and said House
[2:19:29] of Hell give

[2:19:33] was the one that spoke the word that
[2:19:35] tore the prison walls down brother
[2:19:37] Andrew why' you say that because there's
[2:19:39] going to be times that somebody's going
[2:19:41] to say or do something or act a certain
[2:19:43] way and you're going to misunderstand
[2:19:46] them and if you're not careful it'll put
[2:19:48] you in
[2:19:49] prison
[2:19:52] and you'll let that prison enable them

[2:24:01] me the joy of thy
[2:24:07] salvation oh
[2:24:10] Lord
[2:24:12] Spirit within
[2:24:15] me you know old David he got a little
[2:24:18] bit he got some flu clogged up and he
[2:24:21] didn't lose a Salvation the prophet said
[2:24:23] he just lost the joy of it right and I
[2:24:26] was thinking while our brother was
[2:24:27] preaching there's there's a wonderful
[2:24:29] air conditioner it's blowing air through
[2:24:31] here and you're breathing but there's
[2:24:33] got to be something called a return
[2:24:35] right there's a return over there
[2:24:37] there's a return over there it's
[2:24:39] returning all that bad air it's taking
[2:24:43] it up so we need as as we were singing
[2:24:46] this song I was thinking well that's
[2:24:47] what that's what David was doing he said
[2:24:50] return amen refreshing my
[2:24:53] air make me fresh Lord amen cuz without
[2:24:56] listen without those returns it would
[2:24:58] have got so stale in here after about 30
[2:25:00] minutes brother Aaron know that a
[2:25:02] returns as important as a as when you
[2:25:05] where you put them as it is uh as it is
[2:25:07] the air conditioner cuz it keeps the air
[2:25:09] flowing well return unto us Lord the joy
[2:25:12] of our Salvation we believe in a return
[2:25:14] Ministry I believe it's going on right
[2:25:16] now and brother Ram's going to step
[2:25:18] right back into it amen amen I believe
[2:25:21] in return Ministry I believe brother
[2:25:23] Brown's going to come back but I believe
[2:25:24] so is Paul so is irenius so is Martin so
[2:25:26] is Luther and all the people underneath
[2:25:28] them they're all coming back brother
[2:25:29] Tatum all the ones that have passed on
[2:25:31] in this church they're all coming back I
[2:25:33] believe in that return Ministry I sure
[2:25:35] do amen but I don't believe we need him
[2:25:38] to come back here to tell us how to get
[2:25:40] there he's already told us and what he's
[2:25:43] already told us is going to bring him
[2:25:46] here and then we can enjoy that for 30
[2:25:49] 40 days ever how long I it don't matter
[2:25:52] to me and then we're going home and you
[2:25:55] know what we're going to breathe some
[2:25:56] air that that's just going to you not be
[2:25:58] able to you there's no
[2:26:01] way there's no way that you can explain
[2:26:03] it there's no way you can explain Heaven
[2:26:06] there's no way you can explain right now
[2:26:08] we have aches and pains we have things
[2:26:10] we got to do and we got Wayward loved
[2:26:12] ones think about a day when all that
[2:26:14] just sheds
[2:26:16] away think about when all that you can't
[2:26:19] think of it cuz we're still human
[2:26:20] but we we do as brother Andrew said we
[2:26:22] believe that God's already said it put
[2:26:25] it in the word the word's already said
[2:26:27] it we which are alive and remain so as I
[2:26:31] was telling you y'all the other day
[2:26:33] we're not looking for a
[2:26:34] [Music]
[2:26:37] Rapture no we got to have a body change
[2:26:42] first we which are alive in remain shall
[2:26:45] not prevent those which are
[2:26:48] asleep for the Trumpet Of God shall
[2:26:50] sound and they're going to come back
[2:26:52] here and take a body change then we're
[2:26:54] going to go in Resurrection cuz we're
[2:26:56] all going to go so I'm looking for God
[2:26:58] to change this vile body amen and it
[2:27:02] gets more vile as the years get longer
[2:27:04] and I promise you if God brother Andrew
[2:27:06] would be 28 and about another
[2:27:09] month God teares another 10 years he
[2:27:12] won't be preaching like that he'll be
[2:27:14] paining himself a little bit
[2:27:17] more let's give our brother a big hand
[2:27:26] thank God for these young on they can
[2:27:28] stand that and do it and he's got a uh
