[0:00] time with your loved ones, your family,
[0:04] a good time off of work, some of us, and
[0:06] a good time to to rest, to refresh.
[0:10] Praise the Lord.
[0:20] That's good. Have your Bibles, you can
[0:22] go to the book of John, and you're going
[0:24] to be on chapter one and then chapter
[0:25] eight. Praise the Lord.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly
[0:52] Father, we want to thank you so much. We
[0:54] want to ask for your presence to be here
[0:56] this morning, Father, as we have service
[0:58] unto you, as you give service unto us,
[1:00] Lord. We want to ask that your perfect
[1:02] word will be preached in power and
[1:03] demonstration, Father, of your word, of
[1:05] your glory, your power. And I pray that
[1:06] [snorts] you would enlighten us, Father,
[1:08] with your uh precious uh eternal truths
[1:10] of life. I pray that you would um
[1:12] quicken these words to us, that you
[1:13] would help us, Father, to enter into
[1:14] worship, into praise, into prayer,
[1:16] Father, for for each other, for loved
[1:18] ones. And I pray that you will make this
[1:20] time memorable for us. and that you will
[1:22] equip us, Father, for the days to come
[1:24] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:26] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29] [clears throat]
[1:30] So, in in the book of uh John,
[1:33] be there with me. We'll we'll read some
[1:35] scriptures.
[1:37] That's good.
[1:43] Let me know if you have it, brothers up
[1:45] there.
[1:46] We're going to be uh teaching on the the
[1:48] light of life. And we might need some
[1:49] help with the brothers here. I don't
[1:50] know why. U my video is showing here for
[1:54] some reason
[1:57] but we won't let that stop us. We we'll
[1:59] go carry right through on book John uh
[2:01] 8:12 we'll be reading on the light of
[2:04] life and also on book uh John 1. Title
[2:07] of this teaching will be the light of
[2:08] life. So we'll be touching on the word
[2:10] light and teaching of what the Bible
[2:12] says, what the messenger says and the
[2:15] light of this day. Amen.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; So praise the Lord. So in John 1:4 it
[2:21] says in him was life
[2:23] and the life was the light of man.
[2:27] Such a memorable word when I read the
[2:29] light of man. I'm thankful that there's
[2:31] a light of man. And in John 8:12 it says
[2:35] then spake Jesus again unto them saying
[2:38] I am the light of the world. He that
[2:41] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[2:44] but shall have the light of life. And
[2:48] when I read that, to me it meant that it
[2:50] was not just a natural light, of course,
[2:53] not just something that was physical,
[2:55] but it it came with a life. It came with
[2:57] a source. It came with the power. And
[2:59] one of the things that's interesting
[3:00] about light is that you need a source,
[3:03] usually fire. You need something that
[3:06] emits the light. And then you need
[3:08] something that reflects it like the moon
[3:11] or something that that stops it. and and
[3:14] those wavelengths then come back and
[3:16] then are seen in the eye of the
[3:17] beholder. So it takes those three
[3:20] things. It takes a source. It takes
[3:22] something emitting the light. The moon
[3:23] has no light of itself. It needs it
[3:25] needs something to to give it that
[3:27] light. And then we we don't see the
[3:30] light of the moon until there got to be
[3:31] the moon to reflect it. And then there's
[3:34] got to be the eye to see it, the natural
[3:36] eye. And for the things that we're going
[3:38] to read about, there's a lot of types in
[3:40] there. And then then you need the
[3:42] spiritual eyes to re to receive the
[3:44] things of the kingdom, the the things
[3:46] that are promised that Jesus promised as
[3:49] a light and then also in the light of
[3:51] the messengers. We'll see that in John.
[3:52] We'll see that in Paul and we'll see
[3:54] that in William Mariam Brandom for this
[3:57] age and how he spoke about them being a
[4:00] light reflecting to us reflecting the
[4:02] true light. So, Matthew 4:15:17, it
[4:06] says, "The land of of Sebun and the land
[4:09] of Nephilim, by the way of the sea."
[4:12] Isn't that a beautiful saying, "By the
[4:13] way of the sea beyond the Jordan,
[4:15] Galilee of the Gentiles, the people
[4:18] which sat in darkness
[4:21] saw a great light. And to them which sat
[4:24] in the region in the shadow of death,
[4:28] light is sprung up."
[4:30] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful thing when you know
[4:31] what darkness has been. And then for you
[4:33] to be able to see light from that time
[4:36] Jesus began to preach
[4:39] and to say repent for the kingdom of
[4:41] heaven is at hand.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; So there's uh generally two words for
[4:48] light in the Old Testament. It was used
[4:49] in Hebrew and and that's the word
[4:50] illuminary and it's or it's also kind of
[4:53] a reflecting of element. It's also
[4:56] reflecting of order. you know the the
[4:57] earth was without form and void and then
[5:00] darkness was upon the deep and God's
[5:02] spirit was upon the face of the waters
[5:05] and then he said let there be light so
[5:07] there's a content there that light is
[5:10] more than just you know you being able
[5:12] to see it brings about an order it
[5:14] brings about a reflection it brings
[5:15] about it actually comes with a lot and
[5:18] in the New Testament in the Greek they
[5:19] use the word false so that's like fire
[5:22] right that's light to shine or to make
[5:24] manifest to reflect
[5:26] So the manifestation of God's
[5:28] self-existent
[5:30] life, divine illumination to reveal and
[5:34] impart life
[5:36] through Christ.
[5:38] Man, we read a lot about how light and
[5:41] salvation are associated with each
[5:42] other. It says, "Turn us again, oh God,
[5:46] and cause thy face to shine, and we
[5:50] shall be saved." Isn't that beautiful?
[5:52] Just the look of the father. And we'll
[5:54] read about how his face, of course, we
[5:56] we've seen it before. It's been radiant.
[5:57] There's fire that comes out of his face
[5:59] that there's it's like lighting. And it
[6:02] says, "Turn us again, oh God of host,
[6:05] and cause thy face to shine, and we
[6:08] shall be saved."
[6:11] &gt;&gt; 27.
[6:13] Psalm 27, it says, "The Lord is my light
[6:16] and my salvation." Right?
[6:18] &gt;&gt; So don't take for granted that light of
[6:20] your salvation that came by your way
[6:22] that has taken you out of darkness. You
[6:24] sat in darkness in the regions of the
[6:26] shadow of death. Light sprung up. Jesus.
[6:29] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is my the
[6:32] strength of my life.
[6:34] I have no strength without his life. Of
[6:37] whom shall I be afraid?
[6:39] Amen. And then in Acts 13:47, it's very
[6:42] powerful scripture here. Um, this is
[6:45] Paul. For so hath the Lord commanded us,
[6:48] saying, I have set thee, so that's Paul,
[6:52] to be light of the Gentiles.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll see a type there, right?
[6:58] I mean, John said, "I'm not that light."
[7:01] But we'll see how the Bible says that
[7:02] Jesus actually testified to him. He
[7:04] says, "That was the light to you."
[7:06] Right.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Like reflecting the light,
[7:08] &gt;&gt; his light to be the light of the
[7:12] Gentiles that thou shouldest be for
[7:14] salvation.
[7:16] Wow. Paul, right? That thou shouldest
[7:17] reflect the salvation unto the ends of
[7:20] the earth with that twothirds of the New
[7:23] Testament, right? Words of life. So the
[7:26] light of thy countenance, I I just think
[7:28] it's beautiful. You know, we have a
[7:29] face, but we also have a countenance,
[7:31] right? So the face is like the natural
[7:33] thing you see but the countenance is
[7:35] it's the spiritual thing you see.
[7:36] Sometimes you can see somebody and you
[7:37] just say, "Hey, you I can just see a
[7:39] shadow over you and and that is
[7:42] grows with discernment, but you see it
[7:45] naturally. You can see you can sometimes
[7:47] even see it naturally because it's so
[7:48] deep. It's so dark, right? But but in
[7:50] general, right, you got the the face and
[7:52] now we're going to talk about
[7:53] countenance." And with countenance comes
[7:56] with u it's that spiritual reflection
[7:58] that you can see. Of course, we know
[8:00] that God is countenance is light, but we
[8:02] can also see it in when we are walking
[8:03] in the light. So it says in number 6
[8:06] 24-26, the Lord bless thee and keep
[8:10] thee. The Lord make his face to shine
[8:12] upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The
[8:15] Lord lift up his countenance upon thee.
[8:19] So he's going to lift up his countenance
[8:21] upon thee and give thee peace. So see
[8:25] there's a lot that comes with these
[8:26] lights with the light of salvation with
[8:29] the light of his countenance. Psalm 4:6.
[8:32] There may be that say, "Who will show or
[8:35] reflect us any good?"
[8:39] Lord, lift thou the light of thy
[8:42] countenance upon us. I never realized
[8:46] that that, you know, I've seen where it
[8:47] says, you know, may your face cause your
[8:49] face to shine upon us, but I I never
[8:51] read it where it says like, lift thou,
[8:53] in other words, you reflect, turn on
[8:55] that light of your countenance, like
[8:57] lift it up, show it, manifest it.
[8:59] Because this is actually a question I
[9:01] didn't realize that when I was studying
[9:03] it. It says there may be that say it's
[9:07] beautiful when the scriptures open up
[9:08] but I've never noticed this. Who will
[9:10] show us any good?
[9:13] &gt;&gt; What a challenge if you really think
[9:14] about it.
[9:16] And then here comes the answer. Lord you
[9:19] lift thou up the light of thy
[9:22] countenance. His countenance has light
[9:24] upon us not just for anything. And and
[9:28] it says right if that happens then we
[9:30] shall be saved. Psalm 44:3 for they got
[9:33] not the land in possession by their own
[9:36] sword. Neither did they that their own
[9:38] arm save them but thy right hand and
[9:41] thine arm and the light of thy
[9:44] countenance. Again because thou hast
[9:46] favor unto them. Psalm 40, excuse me,
[9:50] Psalm 89, it says, "Blessed is the
[9:52] people that know the joyful sound.
[9:56] They shall walk
[9:58] Oh Lord, in the light of thy counters,
[10:02] that light we were talking about, the
[10:04] people that know the joyful sound.
[10:07] Mine, I pray this will be a good worship
[10:09] service right after some of these
[10:10] scriptures [laughter]
[10:11] opening up to us. Thou hast set our
[10:14] iniquities before thee, our secret sins.
[10:17] Now in the light of thy countenance,
[10:21] isn't that beautiful? He could help us.
[10:23] He could um expose our own very secret
[10:26] and our sins. And you know the word
[10:29] knows the thoughts and the intentions of
[10:30] the heart, the deep things.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:15, in the light of the
[10:36] king's countenance is life and his favor
[10:41] is a as a cloud of the latter rain.
[10:46] It's in Matthew 172. This is about
[10:48] Jesus.
[10:50] and was transfigured before them and his
[10:53] face did shine as the sun
[10:56] &gt;&gt; and his raignment was white as the
[10:58] light.
[11:01] Other places we'll find out was Raymond
[11:02] was white as snow and and so forth. So
[11:06] light is all throughout the scripture,
[11:07] all throughout our message
[11:10] and it's a type, right? But we also see
[11:13] the not types like spiritual things
[11:15] going on that that actually are direct
[11:18] says about the the spiritual realm.
[11:21] Matthew 28:3 it says his countenance was
[11:23] like lightning and his raignment was
[11:26] white as snow.
[11:29] You know I like in Spanish they have a
[11:31] they have a separate word for shining
[11:33] and then for like almost like a splendor
[11:35] or or like a spiritual reflection. And
[11:39] and uh I I just like how it gives it a
[11:42] little bit, you know, it's like gold.
[11:43] You know how they say there there's
[11:44] things that that are shinier than gold,
[11:47] but you know, it's just doesn't have
[11:49] that glow. It doesn't have that
[11:51] respondor that they say. And the light
[11:55] of the eye. Okay. Now, so buckle on this
[11:57] one because this is going to have a
[11:58] little bit. This is where the teaching
[11:59] comes in. So, I remember reading this on
[12:03] my own and and just being um how you can
[12:07] say troubled, you can say it um I guess
[12:10] convicted.
[12:12] Okay? Cuz you know it's the light of the
[12:14] eye. Now, this is talking about us now.
[12:16] Okay?
[12:18] So, consider and hear me, oh Lord, it
[12:21] says my Lord, lighten my eyes,
[12:24] lest I sleep, the sleep of death. So we
[12:28] we'll see one of the things there and
[12:29] it's actually a parallel in some of the
[12:31] gospels we'll get to here. So Psalm
[12:33] 38:10, my heart panth, my strength
[12:36] faileth me for the light of mine eyes,
[12:40] note that light of mine eyes, it is also
[12:43] gone from me. Okay, so in Proverbs 15 30
[12:48] it says, "The light of the eyes rejoices
[12:50] the heart and the good report maketh
[12:52] bones fat." So look at all the good
[12:54] things that it says about the eye and
[12:56] then some of the the the dark things
[12:58] that it says about the eye. So in
[13:00] Matthew 6:22 it says and then the next
[13:03] one's going to be 23. If you really want
[13:04] to go to these scriptures, I do
[13:06] recommend it if you have the time in the
[13:07] Bibles. Just go to Matthew 6:22 and then
[13:09] Matthew 6:23
[13:12] and it's also in some other um parallel
[13:15] gospels. It says, "The light of the body
[13:18] is the eye."
[13:20] So if you have light in your Christian
[13:21] walk, that's the eye. If therefore thine
[13:25] eye be single,
[13:27] sure, firm, thy whole body shall be full
[13:30] of light.
[13:32] Now here comes the kicker.
[13:34] But if thine eye be evil,
[13:38] the whole body shall be full of
[13:41] darkness. If therefore, look at this. It
[13:44] says seems like an oxymoron. The light
[13:47] that is in thee, that's the fake shine.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Be careful now. You might look at
[13:53] somebody's eyes and you might think
[13:54] that, oh man, that person is full of
[13:56] light.
[13:57] Let the word tell you what kind of light
[13:59] it is.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the light that is in the you
[14:02] you might think you might have light.
[14:05] The darkness,
[14:06] my goodness, how can darkness have a a
[14:09] light, a fake light? How great is the
[14:12] darkness? That means if you see
[14:14] somebody's eyes spiritually or in the
[14:16] natural that's full of light,
[14:19] but it's really a fake light, a
[14:22] darkness, how great is that darkness?
[14:26] &gt;&gt; I felt reproved, brothers, when I read
[14:28] the scripture. Now I said, Lord, if
[14:31] there's any of that and because it is
[14:34] saying, right, that's the light, right?
[14:36] But it says the light is the real light,
[14:38] the eye, excuse me, then your whole body
[14:40] is light. But if your eyes,
[14:44] it says, full of, let's read it. But if
[14:47] I be evil, I guess that just calls it
[14:49] out, right?
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Thy whole body shall be full of
[14:52] darkness. You can't really fool the
[14:54] scriptures, guys. We I I can't, you
[14:58] know, I might as well just put it in
[14:59] front of me and say I'm wrong
[15:03] in something, right?
[15:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have my eye be full of
[15:07] evil, wrong my body. And I don't want to
[15:10] the word telling me how great is thy
[15:12] darkness.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; All right. So, you got your seat on.
[15:16] That was that was the scripture of the
[15:17] day. Now, we can go on and talk about
[15:19] great things. But I I felt reprove when
[15:22] I read that. You know, the light's
[15:23] great. It's wonderful. The light of this
[15:24] message, the light of your day. But it
[15:28] comes with it comes with with exposure
[15:31] of good and the bad. Help us, Lord.
[15:34] Revelations 3:18 I counsel thee to buy
[15:37] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[15:40] mayest be rich and white raignment that
[15:42] thou mayest be clothed that thy shame of
[15:45] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[15:49] thine eyes there's there's your cure to
[15:51] the evil eye anoint thy eyes with eyes
[15:54] sab
[15:56] that thou mayest see
[15:58] &gt;&gt; amen may may the Lord he said it ble me
[16:01] gold you know go pay the price to
[16:03] receive this message even fullness to to
[16:06] let that evil eye, you know, be taken
[16:09] away that we can have the eye be good,
[16:12] the light of the eye, and then the whole
[16:13] body be light, full of light. He said
[16:15] it. And I think this is really what the
[16:18] message came to do in my life.
[16:21] This is Paul speaking with King Agria
[16:23] where he almost says, "You almost
[16:24] convinced me to be a Christian, Paul."
[16:27] This is a king too, right? People don't
[16:29] know about a thing or two about a thing
[16:31] or two. Acts 26:18
[16:34] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[16:36] darkness to light and from the power of
[16:39] Satan unto God that thou may that they
[16:42] may receive forgiveness of sins and an
[16:44] inheritance among them that are
[16:47] sanctified by faith that is in me.
[16:50] Whereupon, oh king Agria, I was not
[16:52] disobedient to the heavenly vision. He's
[16:55] testifying of some of the things that he
[16:57] came to do. see that he to turn them
[16:59] from darkness to light, right? And from
[17:03] the power of Satan unto God. So God is
[17:05] light. Let's go through these some
[17:06] quickly. We have a very little time.
[17:09] First John 15. This is then this then is
[17:13] the message which we have heard of him
[17:17] and declare unto you that God is light.
[17:20] Very clear. And in him is no darkness at
[17:24] all. So if we're struggling with some
[17:27] darkness, that's not God's fault.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Revelations 22:5, no darkness at all in
[17:33] it. And I love that about a God. I mean,
[17:35] he could have been a god and kind of be
[17:36] a little sneaky in here and there, but
[17:37] I'm just thankful.
[17:40] Revelation 22:5, "And there shall be no
[17:43] light there, and they need no candle,
[17:45] neither light of the sun, for the Lord
[17:48] God giveth them light." Remember our
[17:49] source. And they shall reign forever and
[17:53] ever. 22:5. But remember, you got to get
[17:54] that evil eye out.
[17:57] I keep bringing that up. Psalm 104:2,
[18:00] "Who convertth thyself with light?" Who
[18:02] coverth, excuse me, himself with light
[18:04] as with a garment. Can you imagine
[18:05] somebody just putting on a garment of
[18:07] light as with a garment of light? Who
[18:09] stretches out the heavens like a
[18:10] curtain?
[18:12] Now, Revelation 22:16, no question, no
[18:14] doubt about the three people that are
[18:16] being spoken about here. It says, "I
[18:18] Jesus have sent mine angel
[18:22] to testify unto you." There you are
[18:25] these things in the churches with the
[18:27] nest. I am the root and the offspring of
[18:30] David and the bride. That's light and
[18:34] morning star.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I like to go to the message
[18:37] here in the pillar of fire 53. But then
[18:39] the logus was I love this. I just see a
[18:41] love in here. So you know look at the
[18:44] picture. But then the logus was sent out
[18:47] of him become like a little halo of
[18:50] light.
[18:52] Let's see it playing yonder like a child
[18:55] before the doorstep of the father. I
[18:59] remember one time Jeremiah was playing
[19:00] in the doorstep like the most innocent.
[19:02] He's like about four and just playing in
[19:04] the doorstep and I this scripture just
[19:07] was I was just reminded of it just like
[19:09] a little child playing in the doorstep
[19:10] of the father. And now I can see him
[19:13] now. He entered into the vision. Is this
[19:14] as he moves over there and he draws into
[19:18] his memory or his mind a picture of what
[19:23] the world should be. Now there's not a
[19:26] star or nothing. I hear him say, "Let
[19:29] there be light."
[19:31] That's powerful, brothers. And an Adam
[19:34] broke yonder.
[19:38] There's much in there. And Jehovah Gyra
[19:41] 64 said, "Don't be scared. There's a
[19:44] light. There's a man that can turn on
[19:45] the light." The little the little girl
[19:47] that went down one mile deep or whatever
[19:49] it was in the cavern and the little
[19:51] brother said,
[19:53] "There's a man that can turn on the
[19:55] light.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, he is the word. He can
[19:59] turn on the lights." And in Hebrew, I'll
[20:01] skip through some of these so we can get
[20:03] to some of the other items I want to go
[20:06] over here. So look at this. and his by
[20:09] his grace. So none will have any excuse
[20:13] now. Oh, they could forget the
[20:15] illiterate messengers. And remember,
[20:18] it's not the messenger, it's the
[20:19] message. He's come down again with us in
[20:23] a form of a pillar of light. And he
[20:26] moves with the same miracles and signs
[20:28] nothing out meaning out of the of the
[20:32] Bible staying right with the Bible
[20:35] holding it under subjection bringing out
[20:38] his glory. That's manifestation
[20:40] reflection showing his power. Blessed be
[20:43] his holy name
[20:45] who being in the brightness of his glory
[20:48] in Hebrew 1:3 and the express image of
[20:51] his person. Now that's a reflection. and
[20:53] upholding all things by the word of his
[20:55] power when he had by himself purged our
[20:59] sins. Praise the Lord. Remember that's
[21:01] the cure for the evil eye. Sat down on
[21:03] the right hand of the majesty on high.
[21:06] And Habacook uh skip down to the last
[21:09] verse. And his brightness was as the
[21:11] light and his horn, look at this, he had
[21:14] horns coming out of his hand and there
[21:16] was the hiding of his power. Much to be
[21:19] said about the the Bible. 2
[21:21] Thessalonians 2:8. Uh much of the Bible
[21:23] says about light. Skip down to the last
[21:26] portion of the verse. And shall destroy
[21:28] with the brightness of his coming.
[21:30] Right? Talk about the wicked up there in
[21:32] the first line. So God's light promise.
[21:35] He promised light to him to his sons
[21:39] in the pillar of fire in Nehemiah to
[21:41] give them light in the way. I'm gonna
[21:44] summarize some of these because it's
[21:45] time to wrap it up. And Mori left the
[21:48] presence of the king. He was wearing
[21:50] blue and he was wearing um white. And in
[21:54] 16 it says the Jews had light and
[21:56] gladness and joy and honor.
[21:59] Psalms for with thee is a fountain of
[22:01] life. Imagine a fountain is sprouting
[22:03] out life.
[22:05] In thy light we shall see light. No we
[22:08] can't see the light a part of him. That
[22:10] evil eye that's great at darkness, it
[22:12] can't see light without him, you know,
[22:15] his face. Him lifting up the light of
[22:17] his countenance, showing you, then y'all
[22:19] shall be saved. And he shall bring forth
[22:22] thy righteousness as a light. So this is
[22:23] when we are walking in the light as thy
[22:25] judgment as the noon day when it says
[22:27] when the day is perfect, right? The
[22:28] middle of the day. Oh, send thy light
[22:30] and thy truth both of those things. and
[22:33] let them, meaning the light and the
[22:34] truth, lead me, and bring me unto a holy
[22:38] hill
[22:39] and to thy tabernacles.
[22:42] The day is dine, the night also is
[22:44] dying. Thou hast prepared the light of
[22:46] the sun. For thou has delivered my soul
[22:49] from death. Well, now, it says, well,
[22:51] now thou deliver my feet from failing
[22:55] that I may walk
[22:57] before God in the light of the living.
[23:00] That's communion, brother. That's a
[23:01] sweet communion where we have one with
[23:03] another.
[23:05] This a special scripture for me. Um the
[23:07] word is a lamp unto my feet and a light
[23:09] unto my path. So it's is giving you
[23:12] light for the here and now and for where
[23:14] you are to be in the future.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Walk in the light. Walk with
[23:19] there's much scriptures here about how
[23:20] walking the light. But I want to skip to
[23:22] in the next five minutes to some of the
[23:24] message quotes that I have here.
[23:30] Okay. Okay. Well, he revealth the deep
[23:32] and secret things and knoweth what is in
[23:35] the darkness and the light dwelleth with
[23:37] him. This is Daniel
[23:41] spirit man. And this is talking about
[23:44] Daniel and how he was able to under. So
[23:47] light here being how you able to have
[23:48] the excellent spirit and knowledge of
[23:50] understanding interpreting dreams and
[23:52] showing off hard sentences and
[23:54] dissolving the doubts and um here is
[23:57] typifying um in a in the context of uh
[24:00] how he was a light it says to uh
[24:04] that that he had the interpretation and
[24:06] he was like able to bring light of of
[24:08] the matters.
[24:12] All right. So, I want to get to some of
[24:13] the message quotes that I have. So, I'll
[24:15] skip down here. We're going on over time
[24:17] here. Light manifested. I want to go to
[24:20] the message quotes, brother. So, this is
[24:21] what I want to get to. Um, talk about
[24:24] the messenger. Okay. So, light of God's
[24:28] messenger. We talk about John being a
[24:29] light. Paul, he says, I appointed, he
[24:31] said he commanded like a commandment
[24:33] deed to be a light to the Gentiles of
[24:35] salvation to them. So, look at this.
[24:38] John the Baptist to give light to them
[24:42] that sit in darkness. Remember we we
[24:44] read about that that people that sat in
[24:46] darkness too and in the shadow of death
[24:49] to guide but this is Luke 1 now we're
[24:51] talking about John to our feet and the
[24:54] way of peace and the child grew and
[24:56] waxed strong. This is speaking about
[24:58] John in spirit and was in the deserts
[25:01] till the day of his showing
[25:04] manifestation reflection unto Israel.
[25:06] Right? So here's about John as well one
[25:09] on John one John the Baptist though this
[25:11] is in the gospel of John 1 6-9 there was
[25:14] a man sent from God whose name was John
[25:16] the same came for a witness to bear
[25:18] witness of the light that all men
[25:21] through him Jesus might believe or
[25:24] through him and it says he was not that
[25:27] light specifically that light but was
[25:29] sent to bear witness to reflect that
[25:31] light that was the true light which
[25:35] lightth every man that cometh into the
[25:38] world. And in here about Paul again, I
[25:40] will read it again in the context of he
[25:43] was the light to the Gentiles. For so
[25:45] hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
[25:47] have set thee to be a light of the
[25:50] Gentiles,
[25:52] that thou shouldest be for salvation
[25:54] unto the end of the earth. So with that,
[25:56] I want to talk about the light of this
[25:58] day. And it says, "And it shall come
[26:01] that there should be light at the
[26:02] evening time." We know that, right? So
[26:03] this is the light of our day. The super
[26:05] sign,
[26:07] it shall be light about the evening
[26:08] time. The super sign will show itself
[26:10] across the evening light. Remember, the
[26:12] same sun that giveth light in the
[26:14] evening is the same sun that giveth
[26:15] light in the morning. It's not a
[26:17] different kind of light. It's the same
[26:20] light. Don't you see it? Well, brother
[26:22] Brandham talks about the different
[26:23] colors of the rainbow and all that. And
[26:25] when he gets to the last one and he
[26:27] says, "Hallelujah. Don't you see it?"
[26:29] And and there's just much there,
[26:31] brother, where he says that it was the
[26:33] same light. Um he was just saying the
[26:35] same light and how the colors blended
[26:37] right next to each other and that violet
[26:39] one being the shortest wavelength. But
[26:42] uh B, it says it's a it's a spiritual
[26:44] thing. It's uh it it represents a
[26:48] spiritual understanding. It says if
[26:50] you're spiritual, you'll catch it.
[26:51] There's a man that can turn on the light
[26:53] and shalom. The light vindicated again.
[26:54] Let me get to the We only got just a
[26:56] minute here to wrap it up. No life
[26:58] outside can come outside of light.
[27:01] Remember in him in he was the light of
[27:02] light. The light of life. The title of
[27:04] this message Jesus the light of life.
[27:08] Amen.
[27:11] There's much more richness here. Thanks.
[27:13] We had to we got that right where that
[27:15] light supernatural will come and
[27:17] reflect. And now we we know we got the
[27:19] word today.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Let's just finish off with this one.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Revelations uh uh chapter 4 part two.
[27:26] Now if you notice seven watch seven
[27:29] rainbows, seven colors I mean seven
[27:32] color rainbow that meant seven bows,
[27:36] seven bows, seven churches
[27:39] reflecting seven lights each light
[27:43] wrapped into the other one. It started
[27:48] with off with red.
[27:51] Red. After red came orange, which is a
[27:53] reflection of red. After orange was
[27:56] after come yellow, which is red and
[28:00] orange mixed together makes yellow. Then
[28:02] green. Green and then blue makes black.
[28:05] Then come indigo and then from indigo
[28:09] come violet which is a part of blue. And
[28:11] then he says hallelujah. Don't you see
[28:12] it? God in his seven color rainbow. his
[28:16] covenant that he made a covenant that
[28:19] remember a rainbow is a covenant that
[28:21] through seven church ages the seven
[28:24] colors he would save the earth.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Much more to go but we're out of
[28:29] time. God bless you brothers.
