[6:04] but keep in the back of your mind really
[6:06] honestly truly being a Christian there's
[6:09] no such thing as a divorce right no such
[6:12] thing as a divorce I mean we're we were
[6:13] always we were chosen in him before the
[6:15] foundation of the world we know all
[6:16] these other things happened down here
[6:18] that he divorced Israel and married well
[6:20] that that happened a long time ago right
[6:23] we were always his bride amen that's
[6:26] right we weren not his bride and then we
[6:28] become his bride yeah down here here in
[6:29] the Gentile age we did but now as far as
[6:32] in his mind he always had a s he that's
[6:35] one he was looking for the whole time
[6:37] all right so just keep that in your mind
[6:39] and as as brother Dale brings the um the
[6:41] series on marriage and divorce let's
[6:43] turn to Ephesians 5

[8:00] the young men and and all the adult men
[8:03] in the church so just keep that in your
[8:05] prayers we'll start planning it and
[8:06] getting it ready I think we kind of know
[8:08] that one kind of comes together pretty
[8:10] good so we we've got that one down path
[8:12] so let's go to the Lord in prayer and
[8:14] ask him to
[8:15] bless Heavenly Father we pray that you'd
[8:18] be with us Lord just one more time Lord
[8:20] you've put us on this Earth Lord to be
[8:23] an example for you father and I know
[8:26] that we fail you every day but Lord
[8:28] there has be a time that we come
[8:31] together under this present day truth
[8:33] that we have that you told us what to do
[8:36] you've you've instructed us on the
[8:38] things that we need to do you've
[8:40] instructed us on things to help our life
[8:42] you've instructed us on things to help
[8:44] our finances you you've given like you
[8:46] did the children of Israel Lord You've
[8:48] give us a lot of things but sometimes we
[8:50] turn them away sometimes we commit
[8:52] iniquity because we were born in sin
[8:56] shaped in iniquity spoused from our
[8:58] mother's womb a liar but Heavenly Father
[9:00] you saw Grace and sent a sent your son
[9:04] Lord to take care of that to put us
[9:07] under that bleach blood that made us
[9:09] Lord Justified made us Sanctified filled
[9:11] us with the Holy Ghost and made us
[9:13] children of God lord we have to look to
[9:15] that Lord the author and finisher of our
[9:17] faith the one that did it all for us
[9:19] Lord so now as we live under your blood
[9:21] father you still give us things that
[9:23] we're supposed to do Lord you gave us
[9:25] Commandments and you gave us promises
[9:27] and things to to go go by and walk
[9:30] thereby you gave us rulers and governors
[9:32] Lord just to teach us and and give us
[9:35] Lord admonition and father we pray today
[9:37] Lord that you would just come and just
[9:39] give us Lord the words to say to the
[9:41] people and may it be said in in the
[9:43] honest of our heart let it be taken in
[9:46] the honest of Heart Lord take it and
[9:49] study it and and live it Lord and and
[9:52] Lord we know we have to be in this body
[9:55] Lord until we're changed or until death
[9:57] will set us free so we have to learn to
[10:00] live in this body we know that it was
[10:02] that it commits sin every day you said
[10:04] through the prophet we'll read it in
[10:06] just a little while Lord that we sin
[10:07] every day but father you gave us an
[10:09] advocate you covered our sins Lord and
[10:12] not just covered them this time you've
[10:14] totally eradicated them Lord but it's
[10:16] got to come through the word of God not
[10:18] just being Lord lip service it's got to
[10:21] come from a knowledge a holy ghost
[10:24] knowledge that you truly have forgive us
[10:26] of our sins Lord today we pray that
[10:28] you'd be with the young people that
[10:30] you'd bless them Lord the ones that are
[10:31] looking for a spouse the ones that's
[10:33] looking for a companion in life Lord may
[10:35] they may they find one that's pleasing
[10:38] to you first and then pleasing to them
[10:40] Father we pray that you'd be with us now
[10:42] take care of us heal the sick the ones
[10:44] that are not with us Lord bless them
[10:46] take care of them Lord be with the
[10:47] missionaries on the foreign field give
[10:49] them fruit for their labor father we
[10:50] pray today Lord if anybody's sick among
[10:52] us you said you sent your word and
[10:54] healed them and deliver them from their
[10:56] destruction so father we pray that as
[10:58] the word goes go forth that we'll be
[11:00] healed and that we'll be Sanctified and
[11:02] filled with the Holy Ghost Lord just
[11:04] give us a refilling this morning we ask
[11:06] these things in Jesus name
[11:09] amen amen all right let's go to
[11:11] Ephesians 5 and that's what we've been
[11:13] reading on so we're still on choosing a
[11:15] spouse we went through two of the three
[11:17] things we went through the planning
[11:19] stage and the looking stage now today
[11:21] we're going to go into the praying stage
[11:23] and then I'm going to give you some
[11:25] things to do not
[11:27] do as you're choosing
[11:30] your spouse all right and if you're not
[11:32] if you've already chosen your spouse
[11:34] maybe it'll help you teach somebody that
[11:35] hadn't chose their spouse you know to be
[11:37] able to uh as parents be able to sit
[11:40] down and be able to talk to the kids and
[11:42] and may it be a Bible talk may it be
[11:45] something that you can go back into the
[11:46] word of God and tell the people tell
[11:49] your sons and daughters that hey this is
[11:51] the way if you'll do this this is the
[11:52] way God said we're going to have
[11:53] troubles and trials and tribulations but
[11:55] if you'll do this it'll surely make your
[11:57] life a lot easier all right so verse 28
[12:00] of Ephesians 5 so ought men to love
[12:03] their wives as their own bodies he that
[12:05] loveth his wife loveth himself amen for
[12:08] no man ever hateth his own flesh but
[12:10] nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as
[12:12] the Lord the church for we are members
[12:15] of his body of his flesh and of his bone
[12:18] for this cause shall a man leave his
[12:20] father and mother and shall be joined
[12:23] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[12:27] flesh you may be seated the Lord add his
[12:29] Blessing to the reading of the
[12:33] word we pray truly today now I'm going
[12:36] to give you a little bit of a warning
[12:37] for this
[12:38] afternoon when we get into the this is
[12:41] the choosing or the courtship part but
[12:43] when we get into the dating part this
[12:45] afternoon uh there's going to be some
[12:47] things said that you may you know you
[12:49] may need to have to explain it to the 10
[12:51] and 11 year old but I'm going to have to
[12:53] say things to help you not to go down a
[12:57] certain Road there certain things that
[12:58] we need to talk about so I I hope we're
[13:01] all adults and like brother R said I
[13:02] hope we're all godm minded all right and
[13:05] we know that we still live in this body
[13:07] and there's lust of the flesh things
[13:09] that we have to keep under control all
[13:11] right Paul you know Paul said I keep
[13:13] under my body under control all right
[13:15] for the glory of the Lord but he was a
[13:18] born again Christian right that's the
[13:20] problem we get people that maybe are not
[13:22] born again they can't control this man
[13:24] cuz there's no man to take to take over
[13:26] to keep control that's why you shouldn't
[13:28] marry unbeliever
[13:29] all right so now let's look at the kind
[13:31] of a background of what we were talking
[13:33] about we were talking about the three
[13:34] stages of choosing a spouse now this is
[13:37] pretty much the courtship part you say
[13:39] the courtship part dating is when you
[13:42] find somebody Ian you've honed it down
[13:44] to one person right all right this
[13:48] praying and looking and planning stage
[13:51] is the stage where you're looking and
[13:53] you're you're plan you're making the
[13:55] plan and you're looking for that person
[13:57] and you're praying about it that's the
[13:59] courtship part we think the courtship
[14:01] part is the dating no the courtship part
[14:03] is trying to find one
[14:06] yeah what's a court out here courtship
[14:11] you're looking around trying to find you
[14:13] a spouse right you're looking remember
[14:16] we talked about planning I hope you
[14:18] didn't uh felt a little resistance from
[14:21] some people that sometimes were too
[14:24] carnal but I tried to bring you some
[14:26] scriptures where Paul and would say look
[14:29] I I I got a Mark that I'm looking toward
[14:32] I've got a place I'm going right he had
[14:35] a plan yeah he didn't just say God don't
[14:38] want us to look God wants us to be led
[14:40] by the Holy Ghost but he don't want us
[14:41] to sit down in our seat at home today
[14:45] and say God I know I got the Holy Ghost
[14:47] you said you'd be my teacher now I'm
[14:49] going to close my eyes and you just
[14:51] teach me and I'm just going to sit right
[14:52] here and you're going to bring me my
[14:54] food and you're going to bring me my
[14:55] cash and you're going to bring me this
[14:57] that's not it
[14:59] exactly we are living breathing human
[15:02] beings amen we have a brain we were made
[15:05] in the image of God even in a fallen
[15:07] condition we were made to be little
[15:10] creators look at all
[15:13] this this come from
[15:17] trees this once was a tree right 90% of
[15:20] this building was once a tree right and
[15:23] then this here was chemicals that come
[15:26] out of the ground right right
[15:29] car and all the things like that what
[15:31] you have on today come from a plant y if
[15:35] it's cotton y there polyester that man
[15:37] put two or three things together and
[15:39] made polyester but cotton come from what
[15:41] the Earth right all right now God give
[15:45] man
[15:47] cotton but then he give man the ability
[15:49] to take that cotton and make it into
[15:51] clothes right am so what am I what am I
[15:53] saying uh you can say what you want to
[15:56] about planning if you don't plan like
[15:58] like I said last Sunday if you fail a
[16:00] plan your plan will always
[16:02] fail in anything you do in life right
[16:05] anything you do in life I I see that
[16:08] that Paul had a plan he had a goal he
[16:10] had a mark he said and I press toward
[16:12] that Mark well he found the Mark didn't
[16:14] he amen well God didn't just pick him up
[16:17] and set him in the
[16:18] mark he said I
[16:21] run that I may run to the end right not
[16:24] run to fail all right play remember we
[16:27] talking about just background for last
[16:29] week set a goal know what you want write
[16:33] it down young man write down on a piece
[16:35] of paper what you want your spouse to be
[16:38] right now
[16:41] look it doesn't start with whether
[16:43] they're skinny or
[16:45] fat
[16:48] amen Little Tim said I want a skinny
[16:53] one well I me you that's a desire that's
[16:56] okay but look for car character amen
[16:59] look for character right amen we might
[17:02] have all started out skinny at one time
[17:05] but things happen amen gravity takes
[17:09] over and pushes what's ever here down
[17:13] there so it once you know like sister
[17:15] Gail said she had this lifeguard that
[17:17] she married it looks more like a beach
[17:20] ball
[17:23] now but that's right but
[17:26] listen we must love look me too I mean
[17:30] he's not much bigger than I
[17:32] am but look what's the first thing we do
[17:36] we start going with looks and is she
[17:38] this and is he that that's not what
[17:40] we're talking about right character is
[17:43] what we're talking about right somebody
[17:46] that has Christian values and character
[17:48] amen how many of us now you know you can
[17:51] hold your hand if you want to but how
[17:52] many of us married somebody that wasn't
[17:55] in the message I did right Terence did
[17:58] we got a lot of people did right well
[18:01] you know that's okay but like I was
[18:03] telling
[18:04] you that was a long time
[18:07] ago 30 years ago for me 32 coming up
[18:12] folks we're closer to the end now than
[18:13] ever yes at least we're 32 years closer
[18:16] to when I was so you better if you're
[18:19] coming up of age you young men you got
[18:22] to not make as many mistakes as we do
[18:25] and I think God has give us people to
[18:27] teach you that right that you don't make
[18:29] those mistake those mistakes that we
[18:31] make all right right exactly so that's
[18:33] why this afternoon we're going to talk
[18:35] about the dating stage but right now
[18:36] we're still in the choosing a spouse
[18:39] we're choosing we're looking we're we're
[18:42] planning we're writing down what we want
[18:46] we want our spouse to stay at home or is
[18:47] it okay for her to work are we going to
[18:49] have children in the first year or we
[18:51] going to have children in the fourth
[18:52] year we're going to have this write
[18:54] those things
[18:56] down write it down and look at it
[18:58] right study it take the Bible take the
[19:02] prophet's message we give you all the
[19:03] quotes you'll have all these all these
[19:07] um messages have got all this attached
[19:09] to it so if you ever want to go back to
[19:11] it make your little book of it I don't
[19:13] care what you do with
[19:14] it brother Joe is going to make a um an
[19:17] MP3 just of that so that if you want to
[19:19] listen back to it you can and refer back
[19:22] to it right uh be good for the young
[19:24] people to do it again but look we were
[19:26] talking about setting a goal but now the
[19:28] goal you set has it reveals your choice
[19:30] reveals your goal so what you choose
[19:33] should reveal what your plan or your
[19:35] goal was right right okay and we're
[19:38] going to talk about some of those things
[19:39] not to look for today now let's go to
[19:42] Philippians 3:13-14 that's where we
[19:45] talking
[19:46] about Paul was planning Brethren I count
[19:48] not myself to have apprehended but
[19:51] there's one thing I do forgetting those
[19:54] things which are behind and reaching
[19:55] forth unto those things which are before
[19:58] I pressed toward the mark right he had a
[20:01] goal he had a plan he had something to
[20:04] do Paul did I press toward the mark for
[20:07] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[20:10] Christ amen so his goal was to what put
[20:14] Christians in the in heaven or whatever
[20:16] you want to say put put Christianity to
[20:19] where that you can have what he has all
[20:22] right same thing with choosing of a
[20:24] spouse you don't want to choose a spouse
[20:26] that's wrong right when you're
[20:30] looking the word look means to turn one
[20:33] eyes towards something when you say look
[20:35] what do you do you're looking you turn
[20:37] your head but remember when you turn
[20:40] your head now you need to turn it toward
[20:41] a real believer not somebody that's said
[20:43] in the message PE for 15 20 years 5
[20:46] years 2 years character loyalty love and
[20:51] where they come from that's what we
[20:52] talked about before amen was very
[20:55] important all right know what you're
[20:56] looking for know what you're looking
[21:00] at right look is to turn one eyes toward
[21:03] something
[21:05] now let's start with the praying
[21:09] part praying means to make an Earnest
[21:12] petition and it's not God I want this
[21:14] woman can you give her to me no don't
[21:17] start your prayer that way right God I'm
[21:21] looking for a Godly woman don't put a
[21:24] name on it I'm looking for this kind of
[21:26] person Amen in goals and my plan I'm
[21:29] looking for this kind of person and
[21:31] after you planned and look for that one
[21:33] person and found her now you have to
[21:35] pray so you're heading toward the dating
[21:37] process all right you're heading toward
[21:40] it there's some things I want to show
[21:42] you when we get into the dating that
[21:43] brother brand says do not
[21:46] do when you take the dating sequence is
[21:49] the very very serious part all right
[21:53] this courtship part is not so very
[21:55] serious because you're looking you know
[21:58] you we always call it testing the water
[22:01] yeah but remember there's sharks in that
[22:03] water yeah so be careful of the sharks
[22:05] in the water so we'll talk about that in
[22:07] just a few seconds we we'll do that and
[22:10] actually the next one coming up but
[22:12] after you've planned and look for that
[22:13] one person and found him or her now you
[22:15] have to pray not just a short prayer
[22:16] thank you Lord you gave her me yeah
[22:18] thank you Lord no you pray pray through
[22:21] on the matter the prophet say trust the
[22:23] Lord but be willing to accept and no or
[22:26] not now because remember what I always
[22:28] say God's knows are the best yeses you
[22:29] can have God tells you no that's the
[22:33] best yes you'll ever get cuz if he tells
[22:34] you no he knows what's going to happen
[22:36] in your in your future you don't and if
[22:40] he says no he knows if he says yes he's
[22:42] not like us as as Earthly parents we
[22:46] might say yes and then wish we' have
[22:48] said no about 2 weeks later or a month
[22:50] later or two months later but God is a
[22:52] perfect parent if he says no he knows if
[22:55] he says yes brother Eddie somewhere down
[22:57] the line you're going to mess up but if
[22:59] he says no he's keeping you from that
[23:02] all right everybody understand that
[23:04] God's know are the best yeses you'll
[23:07] ever have all right let's go to First
[23:10] quote and listen what brother Brown said
[23:11] about
[23:12] this marriage is Honorable but it should
[23:15] be entered
[23:17] prayerfully and reverently and genuine
[23:20] love for that woman will bind you
[23:21] together forever what you bind on Earth
[23:25] I'll bind in heaven amen when you walk
[23:27] down the Street Yonder she may get old
[23:29] and gray and wrinkled but that same love
[23:31] you had for her when she was a young
[23:32] beautiful girl you'll still have it amen
[23:35] you may get stoop shouldered baldheaded
[23:37] wrinkle face and everything else but
[23:38] she'll love you just like you did when
[23:40] you stand with wide shoulders and curly
[23:42] hair if it's really God right for you're
[23:46] looking at the time when you've crossed
[23:47] the river y when you'll spring
[23:51] back again to young men and women to
[23:53] live together forever amen I think we
[23:56] forget that part right I I I told I tell
[23:59] many people when I go out and Minister I
[24:02] say you older
[24:03] people you're closer to being young than
[24:06] we are right
[24:09] right you're closer to being young I
[24:11] know you get up and you ache and you
[24:12] pain and you hurt and all these things
[24:14] are going on but remember that's the
[24:16] part of you that's groaning to get back
[24:18] to that young person that's inside of
[24:20] you right same way with you and I we
[24:23] should be we should not set our lifetime
[24:25] goal that well we're just going to grow
[24:27] old together and that's it no we grow
[24:29] old together so that we can be in heaven
[24:31] together amen so that we can be in
[24:33] eternity together all right it if you
[24:37] pick the right one that's God's Eternal
[24:40] promise what what's his eternal promise
[24:43] that you'll spring back again to young
[24:44] men and women to live together forever
[24:46] that's God's Eternal promise he said he
[24:48] would do it he not only that we get to
[24:51] in a minute he swore he would do it amen
[24:53] so God swore that if you whatever you
[24:55] bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven
[24:59] remember he said that when we are joined
[25:02] together that it's done it's finished
[25:05] right
[25:06] remember the Lord
[25:08] said whatever you bind on Earth I'll
[25:11] bind in heaven let's go to number
[25:15] two H certain sound a man nowadays
[25:18] getting married you young fellas you
[25:19] better pray a long time ask God to give
[25:23] you a companion you young women the same
[25:25] way cuz it's so uncertain number
[25:31] three why it's alarming no wonder the
[25:35] home life is gone see any home life
[25:37] that's not
[25:38] stable what I said told you about
[25:40] marriage about divorces and all this
[25:42] stuff you just don't it's not stable I
[25:44] don't care how good you think it is oh
[25:46] yeah right I don't care how good you
[25:47] think it is well me and my ex-wife we
[25:49] get along just fine no you don't if you
[25:52] did you'd still be married to her yeah
[25:54] and vice versa I mean her problem I mean
[25:56] Ain just her problem now to you you got
[25:58] a problem with her too there always two
[26:00] sides of this thing any woman that's
[26:02] going to marry a
[26:04] man any woman that's going to marry a
[26:07] man and she's not certain of that man
[26:09] she better leave him alone right and any
[26:11] man that's going to marry a woman that's
[26:13] why we go through these stages we go
[26:15] through the courtship and the dating
[26:17] process you better leave her alone you
[26:19] better pray through on it until God
[26:22] gives you the answer right and then what
[26:25] God joins together let no man put us
[26:28] under but we first we must pray through
[26:31] on that yes I think we'll have one
[26:35] more choosing of a bride you need to
[26:38] read that
[26:39] book I think today what's got so many
[26:43] divorce cases now that we lead the world
[26:45] in America in divorce cases yeah we lead
[26:47] the rest of the world I mean we got
[26:50] drive-thru divorces now yeah 299 you go
[26:53] up to the window and tell them you want
[26:54] a divorce and you get a divorce but we
[26:56] made it so easy why because it's just so
[26:58] easy hey me and my spouse don't get
[27:00] along with let's get a divorce yeah
[27:02] there's more divorces here than anywhere
[27:04] else this nation and supposed to be and
[27:06] thought of a Christian Nation what a
[27:08] reproach our divorce court I think the
[27:10] reason of
[27:11] it is because that men got away from God
[27:15] and women got away from God and we find
[27:18] that if a man prayed now look how many
[27:20] times he said pray you ought to look
[27:21] this up how many times brother R talks
[27:22] about a man praying and a woman praying
[27:24] for his spous a man prayed and a woman
[27:26] prayed over the matter not just look at
[27:29] a pretty set of eyes or how big strong
[27:32] shoulders or such as that or some other
[27:34] worldly affection but would look first
[27:36] to God and say God is this your plan
[27:39] amen oh so God's got a plan right I read
[27:42] you that last Sunday Christ mystery God
[27:45] reveal brother BR said God had a plan
[27:47] and a purpose so God's got a plan right
[27:49] amen and if we would
[27:53] study we study about everything
[27:56] else
[27:58] but sometimes it's hard for us to study
[28:00] about getting married yeah and if we
[28:02] would study what we're doing when we're
[28:05] going to get married when we choose our
[28:07] wife our husband if we'd study over it a
[28:10] man should pray earnestly for he could
[28:14] ruin his entire
[28:15] life Remember The Vow is until death do
[28:18] we part that's what I said if a
[28:19] Christian man marries a Christian woman
[28:21] it's so death do you part there's no
[28:23] separation there's I mean you can
[28:24] separate for a time but we brother Dale
[28:27] get into that you know about well you
[28:28] can actually cause cause your wife to
[28:30] commit adulterine right and you're held
[28:32] accountable for it all right right right
[28:34] remember the vows until death do we part
[28:38] and he could ruin his life by making the
[28:40] wrong
[28:41] choice but now look when we get to the
[28:43] end of this this afternoon there's a
[28:45] thing called Grace yeah and we'll cover
[28:47] that also all right cuz a lot of us
[28:49] needed it cuz we're not sitting here and
[28:51] with a perfect marriage condition right
[28:54] right well you can admit it or not you
[28:55] can say Amen but I know you li so but if
[28:58] he knows what he making the wrong choice
[29:01] and is marrying a woman that isn't fit
[29:03] to be his wife and he does it anyway
[29:05] right then it's his fault right you
[29:09] can't blame nobody else right it's your
[29:11] fault but if a woman takes a husband and
[29:14] knows that he's not fit to be a husband
[29:16] to you then that's your own fault after
[29:20] you know what's right and wrong right so
[29:22] you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly
[29:24] pray through amen all right everybody
[29:27] understand that
[29:28] that's pretty that's pretty pretty blunt
[29:30] from a prophet praying all right let's
[29:33] go to the next one the object of praying
[29:36] is to find the will of the Lord not to
[29:38] find your
[29:40] will find the will of the Lord right
[29:44] then say yes Lord that's right see this
[29:46] will help get the fleshly motives and
[29:48] objectives out of the way cuz God's not
[29:50] dealing In the Flesh right when you pray
[29:53] he's not dealing In the Flesh amen
[29:55] you're you're praying spiritually to a
[29:56] spiritual ual God but he knows your
[29:59] fleshly condition so therefore he is
[30:01] he's a perfect father if we'll listen to
[30:03] him all right listen to number five
[30:06] Prophet
[30:07] Elisha now that's what we do sometimes
[30:10] look at this sometimes we go off on a
[30:13] tantrum somewhere and not think about
[30:15] God not pray over it ask the Lord
[30:18] whether we should do it or not and we
[30:21] find out that our supply of
[30:24] blessings is cut off and yeah read that
[30:27] quote our supply of
[30:30] blessing is cut
[30:32] off then we wonder sometimes well wonder
[30:35] why I can't have no more
[30:38] blessings you don't watch you let down
[30:41] in your prayer life you say well I'm a
[30:42] Christian well that's the more sign you
[30:44] should pray more than ever amen read the
[30:48] Bible every day pray every day don't
[30:51] make any
[30:55] decisions too harshly
[30:57] or too quickly without first considering
[31:01] God about it remember what daddy always
[31:03] says you come up and you say Brother D
[31:04] I'm going to buy this brand new car what
[31:06] do you think well Lord bless you you
[31:08] already made your decision you're not
[31:10] asking me my opinion you're telling me
[31:13] what you're going to do you're just
[31:15] asking for a stamp of approval right of
[31:18] what you're fixing to
[31:22] do buy something like that or anything
[31:25] you need to just you need to say hey if
[31:26] I situation comes up it's like brother R
[31:29] said one time he said people believe me
[31:30] while I'm in the pull pit he said but
[31:33] out here in in Family Matters he said
[31:34] they don't listen to me right like that
[31:37] brother that I told you about that
[31:38] brother Arnette that uh Lord Brother
[31:41] Brown the Lord through brother Brown
[31:43] told him said you should never handle
[31:44] your finances well why go see somebody
[31:46] if you're not going to do what he says
[31:48] right exactly he wasting time but I'm
[31:52] sure you know what brother Brown
[31:53] probably knew that I mean he discerned
[31:55] that that man was so stubborn and that's
[31:57] a lot of our problem we're so stubborn
[31:58] we don't we don't consider that if
[32:00] brother Dale is our pastor and he's the
[32:02] one that's supposed to be our leader and
[32:03] we go off and do something off the wall
[32:05] because we feel good about it or or we
[32:08] we get all upset about it and then you
[32:10] say well yeah he's my pastor but yeah we
[32:13] we'll handle this one no I don't know
[32:15] about that that's right ask him shall I
[32:17] do this father ask him is it your will
[32:20] for me to do this then see what the holy
[32:23] spirit will speak to you right he might
[32:25] not give you a vision but he will speak
[32:27] in some way to
[32:30] you could be another human
[32:33] being
[32:36] wow he might not give you a vision but
[32:38] he will speak in some way to you to let
[32:40] you
[32:42] know and look where I underline that if
[32:44] you'll be sincere and ask him right
[32:46] right there's the part be sincere and
[32:49] ask him I need an answer to this
[32:51] question and be sincere all right number
[32:55] six questions an answer
[32:59] see brother talking about waiting on a
[33:00] vision God doesn't deal with in Visions
[33:03] with many people right so therefore I
[33:04] wouldn't advise you to do that see don't
[33:07] sit and wait for a vision if you've
[33:08] never had one okay right you may still
[33:11] be sitting there for a while God may
[33:13] give you a vision that's okay but look
[33:15] at what he says God deals with us
[33:17] different read that so I would if I was
[33:20] in your place and didn't have visions
[33:22] from before the Lord I would just wait
[33:24] upon the Lord and say Lord now you show
[33:27] me what's the decision to make right and
[33:29] then way you feel led to do it then wait
[33:32] B see that Lord now you tell me and then
[33:37] way you feel led to do it then wait just
[33:41] a little bit right then wait a little
[33:43] longer that's right and see which way
[33:47] which side you lean towards which way
[33:49] the spirit say now father in my heart
[33:52] you know it doesn't matter now that's
[33:53] where we should start at right amen it
[33:56] doesn't matter Lord
[33:57] but I want to know what you want me to
[33:59] do about it and then he says that's the
[34:01] way he does in meetings he'll wait and
[34:03] he'll get the feeling of the Lord and
[34:04] then he'll follow that way that's a way
[34:06] to do it cuz it's in prayer then you do
[34:08] the best you can even the best we can we
[34:11] make mistakes we know that but if we'll
[34:13] follow this plan of prayer wait wait a
[34:17] little longer so we're praying waiting
[34:20] wait a little longer all right now let's
[34:24] go to here before we of the dating phase
[34:27] let's look at some clear dos and don'ts
[34:30] now these are going to be wrote down on
[34:31] the paper here so you can see them you
[34:33] don't have to write them down cuz little
[34:34] they're a little lengthy but I brought
[34:36] in some scripture and I also brought in
[34:38] some quotes to back it up of some dos
[34:42] and
[34:43] don'ts and not heeding to These Warnings
[34:46] could lead to disaster in your life so
[34:48] this is very important these should be
[34:50] discussed before a serious relationship
[34:52] begins amen all right let's go to number
[34:55] one do not date a
[34:58] unbeliever now brother Bram said he
[35:00] never told you to date an unbeliever he
[35:02] said do not date an unbeliever right all
[35:05] right second Corinthians says be you not
[35:07] unequally yolked together with
[35:09] unbelievers for what Fellowship has
[35:12] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[35:14] what communion hath light with Darkness
[35:17] oh but she comes to
[35:22] church her actions will prove what she
[35:24] is right or he is all right let's look
[35:27] at number seven quote here be certain of
[35:29] God and then in this wedding instead of
[35:32] marrying among his own people he went
[35:33] over and married a centery talking about
[35:35] AE Jezebel I tell brother Anderson I met
[35:37] a girl yesterday that came to the car
[35:39] lot her name was Jezebel yeah I told she
[35:43] was from Puerto Rico I said you know
[35:45] what they did to Jezebel in the Bible
[35:46] don't you she said yeah I know
[35:47] everybody's told
[35:49] me but my mother named me this I said
[35:51] well okay all right I think I change it
[35:54] but he married Jezebel and she was not a
[35:57] Believer and no believer should ever man
[36:00] unbeliever now look under no
[36:03] circumstance cuz we're going to see in
[36:04] just a few minutes or later on this
[36:06] evening that that here's the famous
[36:09] quote well I'll date them or I'll start
[36:13] seeing them so I'll get them to come to
[36:15] church or get them to become a Christian
[36:17] you watch what brother Brown says about
[36:18] that he says the Hound of Hell's out for
[36:20] you if you do that no believer should
[36:23] ever marry an unbeliever under no
[36:25] circumstance should all always marry
[36:28] Believers but Ahab had done this evil
[36:30] thing and no doubt but what Jezebel was
[36:32] a beautiful woman and he'd fall for what
[36:36] she looked like instead of what she was
[36:39] so many people make that same mistake to
[36:42] this day she brought idolatry in the
[36:45] nation among the people she actually
[36:48] look at that the people the priest their
[36:50] Minister everything fell victim to
[36:52] Jezebel cuz he married an unbeliever all
[36:55] right number eight
[37:01] just like today when a Christian boy
[37:02] marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a
[37:04] Christian boy that starts something
[37:07] right then see don't you get married
[37:11] unless you're equally Yol together with
[37:13] Believers you know to keep
[37:17] trouble
[37:18] down now look read this next one when
[37:21] God made man men and women in the
[37:22] beginning he made their Spirits then
[37:25] there's someone for you just wait yeah
[37:28] see all right now let's go to the next
[37:30] one number
[37:33] nine AIA was the son of Ahab and that's
[37:36] what he's talking about his father had
[37:38] married out of Fellowship married a
[37:40] woman that was not a Believer and that's
[37:41] all that always makes a bad home for any
[37:45] kid to be raised in that when unbelief
[37:48] and Faith tries to mix
[37:51] together now I don't know if some of you
[37:53] have unbelieving husbands and
[37:54] unbelieving wives but they somewhere you
[37:56] going to have have to deal with this
[37:58] with your
[37:59] children because if you're
[38:03] iniquity cuz if your iniquity of knowing
[38:05] to do better not doing it or not praying
[38:07] about it it's passed down to your kids
[38:09] yeah uh brother Bram said that I think I
[38:11] got a quote this afternoon it shows that
[38:14] brother Brown says visited iniquity is
[38:15] from the parents to the children talks
[38:17] about being a a a flapper and then a
[38:20] course or course girl flapper
[38:22] prostitute right on down so it keeps
[38:25] falling all right because of the because
[38:27] of the generations I'm sorry that's just
[38:29] what it is but remember we're n good no
[38:31] not one we're not throwing stones at
[38:32] anybody but there's somewhere you going
[38:33] to have to deal with this cuz any bad
[38:35] home or any kids raised in this home
[38:37] brother said it's a bad home yeah when
[38:39] unbelief and Faith tries to mix together
[38:42] now if the father had been a real strong
[38:44] man in his faith the child might have
[38:45] had a better opportunity but he didn't
[38:47] he didn't have he knew that there was
[38:49] God he knew there was Jehovah then his
[38:51] mother's God and so forth he was all
[38:53] confused and after the death of his
[38:55] father this boy in this condition kind
[38:57] of mixed up one way or the other and if
[38:59] that ain't a picture of the lands today
[39:02] yeah one in the family is this way and
[39:04] one another and one going this way one
[39:06] going that way now you could be married
[39:09] and that happen yeah you better be
[39:11] careful don't be looking at people
[39:12] sitting here with s that are single no
[39:14] you better be looking at your own life
[39:16] right one going this way and one that
[39:18] way no wonder we are producing M we are
[39:22] producing so much juvenile delinquency
[39:26] right and all other kinds of stuff under
[39:28] the name of Christianity right it's
[39:31] because there's no Unity there's no real
[39:34] call out and stand for God Amen that's
[39:37] your Prophet argue with him all right so
[39:42] never
[39:44] never never start a dating relationship
[39:47] with somebody you know you can't have
[39:49] right amen so if you start dating an
[39:52] unbeliever you not supposed to have that
[39:54] person so don't don't get yourself mixed
[39:57] up in it don't let emotions begin to
[39:59] take hold God cannot and will not bless
[40:01] this situation because of that quote
[40:03] that I showed you look in first
[40:07] Corinthians this says be not deceived
[40:10] evil communication corrupts good maners
[40:12] now look in the in the U NIV version
[40:15] then I pull this out NIV version this is
[40:17] what it says about that scripture bad
[40:19] company corrupts good morals yeah
[40:23] right you hang around Bad Company long
[40:25] enough it's going to destroy your
[40:28] morals been
[40:30] there been
[40:32] there thank you be not deceived evil
[40:36] Communications corrupt good
[40:38] manners that's why you don't hang around
[40:40] you know you don't hang around people
[40:41] that tell dirty jokes you don't hang
[40:43] around people that do all the talks
[40:44] about all these things of the world and
[40:46] and these movie stars and all that stuff
[40:48] why it's evil communication and
[40:50] shouldn't be a part of anything you
[40:51] listen to you should walk away from that
[40:53] junk sh your very appearance of evil we
[40:56] we'll get into that a little bit later
[40:58] on all right let's look at a quote on
[41:00] that and see so it is I watched many
[41:03] times the wolf after of the deer now
[41:04] here it is right here yeah if he can
[41:06] catch a little deer out of itself that's
[41:08] the one they work on there's a
[41:10] lesson if he can catch a deer that's why
[41:13] the that's why animals her together yeah
[41:16] there's power in
[41:17] numbers amen but now what happens is
[41:20] there's one will get out over here and
[41:21] think he's doing a little better than
[41:22] the rest of them and he can outrun the
[41:24] cheetah or the leopard
[41:26] well watch this there's a lesson if he
[41:29] can catch a deer away from the
[41:31] herd what let an unbeliever go out with
[41:34] an I mean let a Believer go out with an
[41:35] unbeliever right same scenario that's
[41:39] what the devil wants to do so you young
[41:42] ladies he wants you to go out with a boy
[41:44] that's not a Christian you too young man
[41:47] he wants you to go out with some little
[41:48] paint in Jezebel that's not a Christian
[41:51] right that's where he wants to break you
[41:53] up that's where he wants to he wants to
[41:55] Sock his his teeth into you and this
[41:57] little deer will get out to itself away
[41:59] from the herd that's the one the wolf
[42:02] works on and to you old man or woman
[42:05] when you separate yourself from
[42:07] Believers yeah hello somebody people say
[42:11] I can stay at home
[42:13] hello right I ought hit a bunch of y'all
[42:16] sitting here today cuz going to see you
[42:18] tonight afternoon I can stay at home be
[42:21] just as good Christian as I can what the
[42:24] prophet say right here I want you to
[42:25] read this
[42:27] yeah say it
[42:29] again so you're fooling
[42:31] yourself if you think you can the Bible
[42:34] said not forsake our assemble together
[42:37] that much more as we see the time coming
[42:39] if you're a Christian you long to go
[42:41] where other Christians are amen and
[42:44] fellowship with other Christians so you
[42:46] cannot stay away from church and live
[42:48] the same life that's right you read that
[42:51] can't do it you can smirk and smile all
[42:53] you want to you can't do it you can not
[42:56] do
[42:57] it I I'm I'm Brother Richard Marlo is he
[43:00] here he SI it BL his hard he's been sick
[43:03] this weekend but his son I got a burden
[43:05] on my heart for that boy amen he he just
[43:08] needs to get around some Believers yes
[43:11] so you cannot stay away from church and
[43:13] live the same life you can't do it
[43:16] because it's like I'm hungry but I'll
[43:18] never go to the table I just I'll never
[43:20] eat I just I ain't going to do it see
[43:23] you got to go and feed on the word of
[43:25] God and fellowship one with another we
[43:28] need one a mother another we do need a
[43:32] mother we need one another more now than
[43:35] we ever
[43:36] did am when you get yourself singled out
[43:39] from the rest of them that's making
[43:40] yourself just a little
[43:42] different when you single yourself out
[43:44] from the rest of them making yourself a
[43:47] little different you don't want to
[43:49] associate with them because they believe
[43:50] this and don't want to associate with
[43:52] that you're going on Dangerous
[43:54] Ground right there keeping away from
[43:58] church that's the success of my meetings
[44:00] is because real godly people pray for me
[44:03] right I wanted to put that in there but
[44:05] pretty clear Bad Company corrupts good
[44:09] morals all right let's go to the next
[44:10] one number
[44:13] 11 but now when he comes down and make
[44:15] fellowship with Ahab and he get in
[44:17] trouble now Ahab and when you take the
[44:19] world is trying to find fellowship with
[44:21] you just remember there's a rabbit in
[44:23] the wood pile somewhere right when you
[44:25] take that little cigarette smoking boy
[44:27] that wants to take you out at night time
[44:29] young lady you Chris Pentecostal girls
[44:32] that little Drinker and his hair comb
[44:33] down slick enough to hold his mouth
[44:37] open you reckon he saw that somewhere I
[44:40] think he did let me tell you something
[44:43] now there's something in the making
[44:46] right and he says I'll marry you dear
[44:48] and then I'll join your church right
[44:51] he's a lying to you right if you if you
[44:55] look if you loves you and loves the Lord
[44:58] should be a he I guess he will do it
[45:01] then he don't have to take you right
[45:04] that's right and you men you young boys
[45:06] with some of these little painted up
[45:07] Jezebels the same way you shouldn't do
[45:10] that shame on the pastor that fails to
[45:11] say that in the church so we said it we
[45:14] are called out separated different
[45:16] people Sanctified to the Lord in Israel
[45:20] all right sure the Bible said the devil
[45:22] would do it then in the last days and
[45:24] that's exactly what he's doing doing
[45:26] what he's
[45:28] separating he's taking unbelievers and
[45:30] Believers and putting them together all
[45:32] right let's go to the last one number 12
[45:34] any time evangelism God wants his people
[45:37] to be separated from unbelief and
[45:39] unbelievers so many of you people make a
[45:41] mistake in this sometimes letting your
[45:42] children play out here a little
[45:45] Oswald or you can put whatever name you
[45:47] want to in there I guess Oswald was
[45:49] popular back them see I don't mean to be
[45:51] different now and start you and so forth
[45:53] and be some kind of fanatic I don't mean
[45:55] that that but you let a you be sure your
[45:58] daughter goes out be sure who your
[46:00] daughter goes out with at night time
[46:02] right see maybe you raised her a goded
[46:05] little old girl around the church and
[46:06] the first thing you know she gets out
[46:08] with Oswald or some of them and he's an
[46:10] atheist
[46:12] unbeliever and her life will come up
[46:15] ruined yeah and you don't know what he
[46:17] is right you see then he'll marry her
[46:21] and look for your kids or your grandkids
[46:23] then you see be careful God wants his
[46:26] people to be separated all right number
[46:30] two you cannot marry a divorced person
[46:33] with a living husband now that ought to
[46:34] be self-explanatory Brother D was going
[46:36] to cover this but I thought I'd bring it
[46:37] out in here in the dos and don'ts so
[46:40] don't even don't even yoke yourself up
[46:42] with somebody that's been divorced so
[46:44] cuz you can't marry them amen and he
[46:47] saith unto them in Mark 10 whosoever
[46:49] shall put away his wife and marry
[46:50] another right commit adultery against
[46:53] her and if a woman shall put away her
[46:54] husband and be buried to another she
[46:56] committeth adultery all right let's go
[46:59] to Matthew this is Jesus speaking it has
[47:02] said whosoever shall put away his wife
[47:05] let him give her a writing of
[47:06] divorcement but I say unto you that
[47:08] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[47:10] for the cause of fornication we're going
[47:11] to talk about that this afternoon not
[47:13] this morning but this afternoon causing
[47:15] her to commit adultery causeth her to
[47:18] commit adultery and whosoever shall
[47:20] marry her that is divorced commands
[47:23] adultery amen all right so that's pretty
[47:24] cut and dry we know we got we have Grace
[47:27] but listen to this we wouldn't need
[47:30] Grace if we quit marrying unbelievers
[47:33] right well I mean we know we always
[47:35] going to need Grace but I'm talking
[47:36] about for married and divorce cuz
[47:38] remember two Christians don't divorce
[47:41] right now brother Brown is there any
[47:43] Scripture permitting marriage after
[47:44] divorce this is very important it says
[47:46] important well that's the reason it
[47:47] wasn't pertaining to this cuz that's a
[47:49] question and answers on the seal as far
[47:51] as I can see my brother or sister
[47:53] whoever it may be there isn't unless
[47:55] your companion
[47:56] dead because the Bible said we're bound
[47:58] to them as long as they live so as far
[48:01] as scripture he don't have scripture
[48:03] that's it you've done took an oath over
[48:05] that you see so I don't think there is
[48:07] but as far as myself I don't find any in
[48:10] other words there's no scripture to say
[48:13] that so there's no reason for you to be
[48:14] dating or even looking at somebody
[48:16] that's been divorced sorry you can't do
[48:18] that right okay it's just one of them
[48:21] definite definite know right now if he
[48:25] take you in deception or she takes you
[48:27] in deception there was a a pointing case
[48:29] brother forny was telling me and this
[48:31] this brother was dating this sister and
[48:33] she was like from New York and she had
[48:35] moved down to whatever South Carolina
[48:37] North Carolina I can't remember it
[48:38] wasn't Brother Jules church but he was
[48:40] something he was dealing with and the
[48:42] brother was dating her she said there's
[48:44] nothing in my life everything's okay so
[48:46] they made the vow to get married got
[48:49] married and on the wedding night if you
[48:51] understand what I'm saying he found out
[48:52] she wasn't a virgin she confessed that
[48:55] night
[48:56] that she had been with several men and
[48:58] that she even had a
[48:59] child that night the man immediately got
[49:03] up left wherever they were drove back
[49:07] home and had somebody come and pick that
[49:08] girl up and see what you see what you
[49:11] get into right now he's got a legal
[49:14] right mhm right and a Godly right and a
[49:17] scriptural right to put that woman away
[49:19] and marry somebody else and God never
[49:21] never worry about him being he's not
[49:23] double married though he went through
[49:24] all that cuz it was under a vow and she
[49:27] had committed fornication right but he
[49:29] did it immediately he didn't wait till 3
[49:30] days later after the honeymoon you
[49:32] understand what I'm saying right at that
[49:34] moment immediately he gets up and goes
[49:36] home tells that woman go get your daddy
[49:39] come pick you up and the of course it
[49:41] was all done separated and the the woman
[49:44] left but see you really don't hold
[49:47] things back you need to talk exactly
[49:49] talk about these things she said well I
[49:51] was afraid you wouldn't date me he said
[49:53] well you've already messed yourself up
[49:55] anyway way you were messed up before I
[49:58] found you right and now you put me in a
[50:00] bad situation even though he's clean to
[50:03] do what he wants to do he still got that
[50:05] stuck in his brain right okay so and you
[50:09] can't even man someone that's been
[50:10] engaged right remember the sacredness of
[50:14] The Vow let's go to number
[50:17] 14 brother Brandon what is the meaning
[50:19] of a moment daddy read this one but
[50:20] let's read it again are people free to
[50:22] marry or is it just another word for
[50:24] divorce I'd like some information this
[50:26] sure they're married long as they take
[50:28] that vow they're married just like a boy
[50:30] if a boy promises a girl to marry her
[50:32] under good
[50:33] faith so you should be going through the
[50:36] planning looking praying dating before
[50:40] any of this is discussed as far as hey
[50:42] let's get married yeah okay and the
[50:45] asking part should be right at the very
[50:47] end right amen she's just as good as
[50:50] married her the only thing the law does
[50:51] it gives you a Bill of Rights to live
[50:53] together to keep from being common law
[50:54] husband and wife wife but when a man
[50:56] tells a woman I'll marry you honey I'll
[50:58] take you for my wife will you take he's
[51:00] married your vow is sacred that's what
[51:03] marries you anyhow amen there's not no
[51:05] preacher can marry you magistr or
[51:07] nothing else it's your own vow to God
[51:09] and to this man when you promise you're
[51:11] married and a little lady if you promise
[51:14] to marry that boy you're obligated to do
[51:16] it if you marry another after that
[51:19] obligation you will from now on anyhow
[51:22] you'll be living in adultery right and
[51:24] notice now see she's she's pure as aily
[51:27] as far as her virginity far as her
[51:29] natural virginity right she's just
[51:32] committed to say I'll marry you and then
[51:34] breaks it off brother R said that's is
[51:36] just the same as commit an adultery
[51:38] right amen from now on you'll be living
[51:40] an adultery over she goes and marri
[51:41] somebody else she'll be living in
[51:43] adultery right it's very serious young
[51:45] kids it's very serious I I wish we'd all
[51:48] had somebody sit down and explain this
[51:50] to us before we started doing what we
[51:52] did and notice the same thing to a boy
[51:55] promising to marry a woman don't you
[51:58] make your vow to anyone unless you mean
[51:59] to stick with it remember there's the
[52:00] Bible for it Joseph promised to marry
[52:03] Mary you have to keep your vows when you
[52:05] promise a woman that she's a sacred
[52:07] little vessel and has to bring child
[52:08] life into the world again so when you
[52:10] promise her you must marry her amen so
[52:14] you can't marry somebody that's been
[52:15] engaged right everybody got that amen
[52:18] okay number four here's the one I can
[52:22] change him or her after we're married
[52:25] this is Satan's life dating or marriage
[52:29] is not a witnessing opportunity right
[52:31] amen it's not a witness
[52:33] to do not play with this idea right you
[52:38] will get burned right pray for people
[52:41] witness to them invite them to church
[52:44] but do not use yourself as bait amen
[52:47] right oh if I could just get him to go
[52:49] to church with him
[52:50] yeah I'm just telling you what the
[52:52] prophet said let let's go through number
[52:54] 15
[52:56] vasion of the United States let's read
[52:59] the the quote part just save time you
[53:03] take a man that's a good moral man and
[53:05] let him marry a little woman that ain't
[53:06] worth a dime it isn't long till he ain't
[53:08] worth a dime either right that's what
[53:10] happened to Ahab take the same vice
[53:12] versa let a nice little woman marry an
[53:14] old man that ain't worth a dime first
[53:16] thing you know she's doing the same
[53:18] thing he is how could I go this morning
[53:21] and point my hands on little broken up
[53:22] homes and things like that where lovely
[53:24] little mothers come into a drinking dad
[53:26] and things like that and thought they
[53:28] could do something with them right and
[53:31] now the whole mother and all of them is
[53:33] drinking and going on it's environment
[53:36] right all right next
[53:40] one now but when he come down and made
[53:42] fellowship with Ahab then he got in
[53:44] trouble now Ahab and when you take the
[53:45] world is trying to find fellowship with
[53:47] you just remember there's a rabbit in
[53:49] the wood pile I read this one before but
[53:51] I'm going to read it again cuz there's
[53:52] another emphasis to this when you take
[53:53] the little cigarette smoking boy you
[53:55] want to take you out at night time young
[53:57] lady you Pentecostal girl that little
[53:59] Drinker his hair comb down slicking up
[54:00] to hold his mouth open let me tell you
[54:02] something now there's something in a
[54:04] making see there's something in a making
[54:06] I'll marry you dear then I'll join your
[54:08] church he's lying to you folk right if
[54:12] you loves you and loves the Lord he'll
[54:15] do it then yeah he don't have that's why
[54:17] I said don't use yourself as bait we not
[54:20] bait brothers are sister invite them to
[54:24] church invite witness to them but don't
[54:27] yoke yourself up with them everybody got
[54:30] that amen you sure okay now please don't
[54:34] do that number five you really like this
[54:37] one watch out for spoiled or selfish
[54:47] people I'm going to read you what the
[54:49] prophet said about it
[54:50] okay if you don't
[54:52] mind then we're going to get to the last
[54:54] one and this this one is very serious I
[54:56] see too much of this flirting going on
[54:59] all right this one though is is watch
[55:02] out for spoiled or selfish people
[55:03] sometimes I wonder if we intellectual
[55:06] Americans has enough discernment to
[55:07] discern right from wrong yeah especially
[55:10] Juvenile Courts prove that we haven't
[55:12] got it to discern right and wrong for
[55:14] our
[55:16] children they seem to have a good psych
[55:18] psychologist answer for instance like
[55:21] this if Junior comes up to Popp and
[55:23] Stomps his little feet and screams out
[55:24] and Shakes his head and says Dad I don't
[55:27] care what you say I want a hot ride
[55:29] that's typical America and the father
[55:31] says all right Junior I'll buy it for
[55:33] you you could say to that Dad why did
[55:35] you do it oh I love him yeah you
[55:38] remember dad junior is going to grow up
[55:40] to be a man someday and he'll marry and
[55:42] have a family listen to what the prophet
[55:44] said God help that
[55:47] wife that lives with a boy that's been
[55:50] brought up like that to have his way
[55:52] about everything he wants right can't
[55:55] discern right from wrong y'all didn't
[55:58] know the prophet talked about all this
[55:59] did
[56:00] you can't discern right from wrong
[56:03] that's not love that's pure ignorance
[56:06] right it's Prophet saying this not me
[56:09] okay the Bible's right spare the rod and
[56:12] you spoil your son all right is that all
[56:16] of that
[56:19] one yeah I think that's all that one no
[56:23] yeah you spoil your son
[56:25] same way with the girls flip-flopping
[56:28] same way with the girls all right same
[56:30] way with the girls we don't want no we
[56:32] don't want the people that are spoiled
[56:34] yeah if you'll
[56:37] pray you'll get all these things away
[56:39] from you but I listen to the last one
[56:41] this is the last one on the on the page
[56:43] here flirting brother Brown talks a lot
[56:47] about flirting the Bible talks about
[56:49] flirting yeah people flirting is
[56:53] wrong right amen flirting is wrong amen
[56:56] cuz you know what you're doing flirting
[56:57] means you're coming as close and you as
[56:59] you can to something without crossing
[57:01] the line right that's dangerous right
[57:04] cuz the closer you get to that's what I
[57:06] telling y'all if we know something's
[57:08] wrong and we try to live right on the
[57:10] edge of that
[57:12] yeah you know that man walked up to the
[57:15] devil one time and he was sitting on the
[57:16] fence God was on the other side he walks
[57:20] up the man walks up and start talking to
[57:22] the devil and he tells the devil C or
[57:24] God was over here with with a man well
[57:26] the man walks over close to the devil
[57:27] and says hey why you sitting on the
[57:30] fence he'd been wishy-washy and a lot of
[57:32] things you know you talking about
[57:33] sitting on the fence cuz you don't know
[57:35] which way to go or the other and Satan
[57:36] just looks at him says well I on the
[57:41] fence I own the fence so stay away from
[57:44] the fence right stay away from
[57:47] the line you see where the line is don't
[57:51] get right up close to it if you are
[57:53] flirting with the world you you don't
[57:55] intend on crossing the line but you're
[57:56] trying to get as close as you can yeah
[57:58] and wanting to experience as much of it
[58:01] as you can without getting caught by
[58:03] right flirting hurts both parties
[58:06] involved by giving false hope right
[58:09] think of a young man that you got a
[58:11] flirty little girl and and she flirts
[58:13] with this boy and she don't care no more
[58:15] about him and nothing but she wants to
[58:16] get something out of it that's what you
[58:18] do you get something it's your own
[58:20] emotion when you flirt you're getting
[58:22] something out of it yourself right right
[58:25] it's selfish go back to that selfish
[58:27] person you get false hope all right
[58:31] listen what brother Brown
[58:34] says where's our strength gone Samson
[58:37] now here's here's Samson watch what he
[58:38] do Samson did real well he got a good
[58:43] start and he did all right until he
[58:46] began to flirt right and when he began
[58:49] to flirt he got in trouble that was his
[58:52] first step of back sliding yeah
[58:58] H I believe tonight the first step of
[59:00] backsliding to the church when it begins
[59:02] to flirt with what unbelievers yeah all
[59:06] right listen we're not supposed to be
[59:07] stuffed shirts we're not supposed to be
[59:09] think we're different but we are
[59:11] different right we are different live in
[59:13] this world different we are different
[59:15] we're supposed to present something that
[59:17] that no one else can live but you don't
[59:20] have to go out there and think you're up
[59:22] here and there down here cuz at one time
[59:24] remember you were down here all right
[59:27] first step was backsliding you see that
[59:29] that Philistine woman there was one
[59:31] problem with her she was an unbeliever
[59:33] Delila was flirting also yeah we'll read
[59:37] it in just a minute she was flirting
[59:39] also and what happened was she really
[59:42] didn't want Samson as a
[59:44] husband she didn't want him right she
[59:47] wanted to know where his strength was
[59:49] she didn't care about the man Samson she
[59:51] wanted to know how is he killing so many
[59:54] my people cuz she was Philistine
[59:56] remember and he go kill all the
[59:57] Philistines she wanted to know how she
[1:00:00] was what she was trying to find a way to
[1:00:03] help her Philistines and herself and not
[1:00:05] help Samson all right yeah so you
[1:00:07] remember that Isaiah 3 and 6 more over
[1:00:10] the Lord said because the daughters of
[1:00:12] zine are
[1:00:13] hoty what is the daughters of zine right

[1:00:25] forth neck cuz you got on about a three
[1:00:27] in heel right some of you do it too so
[1:00:30] you need to stop yeah cuz what you're
[1:00:32] doing you're doing this and it's pushing

[1:00:57] walk in a pair of high shoes without
[1:00:59] mincing right twisting
[1:01:02] right making a tinkling with their feet
[1:01:07] amen wow all right let's go to Proverbs
[1:01:09] 6 for the Commandment is a lamp and the
[1:01:12] law is light and the reproofs of
[1:01:14] instruction are the way of life that's
[1:01:15] what we're trying to do today to keep
[1:01:17] thee from the evil woman from the
[1:01:20] flattery of the tongue of a strange
[1:01:22] woman right lust not ask after her
[1:01:24] beauty in thine heart neither let her
[1:01:27] take thee with their eyelids what do you
[1:01:30] do when you flirt yeah
[1:01:34] yeah ain't that
[1:01:36] true quote number 19
[1:01:42] please and it was getting night and
[1:01:44] remember her husband would return now
[1:01:45] this is talking about remember in the
[1:01:46] Bible where where where Jesus tells the
[1:01:49] parable about the woman with the tablets
[1:01:52] yeah the the headdress with the tablets
[1:01:54] hang hanging on it all right very very
[1:01:57] pretty um analogy all right and he found
[1:02:01] her one of those coins out it showed she
[1:02:02] had been marked to harlot and if she had
[1:02:05] if she had defied or defiled herself in
[1:02:07] any way and it was seen by the people
[1:02:09] they brought her before the priest and
[1:02:11] brought witness that she had found she
[1:02:13] had been found such and the priest
[1:02:15] saying that she was a married woman took
[1:02:17] the coin that was coins hanging on the
[1:02:19] head right here right coins H and one
[1:02:21] was for a different item right amen they
[1:02:24] would take that coin look right here
[1:02:27] because look there's one there's there's
[1:02:29] a couple there there's not just one
[1:02:31] there's several coins hanging on a on a
[1:02:34] string off of her
[1:02:35] headdress the priest saying she was a
[1:02:37] married woman took the coin out of her
[1:02:39] tablet that she'd been doing wrong by
[1:02:42] and if she' marred her virtue they took
[1:02:45] that out in other words she would
[1:02:47] committed adultery they pull that one
[1:02:48] out so everybody could see and her
[1:02:50] husband could see when he come home but
[1:02:51] now look here if she had been flirting
[1:02:55] showing that she wasn't true to her
[1:02:57] husband they took that one out so there
[1:03:00] was one for flirting yeah they took that
[1:03:02] one out
[1:03:05] huh and whatever it was they took it out
[1:03:08] and when her husband returned he found
[1:03:09] that she had been marked and he would
[1:03:12] divorce her immediately and have nothing
[1:03:14] to do with such a woman he didn't want
[1:03:17] he did not want such a woman
[1:03:19] yeah so getting along toward dark in
[1:03:22] other words she found you know her
[1:03:24] situation was different from this he
[1:03:26] just making an example the church better
[1:03:28] be examining their themselves by the
[1:03:30] word of God our Purity our loyalty our
[1:03:33] devotion we become
[1:03:35] tiddlers tail bearers cigarette smokers
[1:03:39] backbiters painted up Jezebels
[1:03:41] everything in the calendar that the rest
[1:03:42] of the world does the Christian church
[1:03:44] is associating in those things today so
[1:03:46] you can't hardly tell the one from the
[1:03:48] other it's time we took inventory it's
[1:03:51] getting late amen all right so
[1:03:55] flirting flirting is a lack of
[1:03:57] commitment or to trifle have you ever
[1:03:59] looked up the word trifle trifle means
[1:04:01] to make Trivial or insignificant in
[1:04:03] other words it doesn't matter trivial or
[1:04:06] insignificant flirting is selfish and
[1:04:09] not genuine a put on in a fake yeah so
[1:04:13] there's nothing good you see anything
[1:04:14] good about flirting nothing good about
[1:04:18] flirting all right quote number
[1:04:21] 20 but Delila did you notice she that
[1:04:24] Samson had a power and she didn't know
[1:04:27] where that power lay she couldn't tell
[1:04:28] what that power was but there was some
[1:04:30] great power that Samson possessed and
[1:04:32] she wanted to find it she didn't want to
[1:04:34] get close to Samson cuz she loved him
[1:04:36] and as theila she kept wooing Samson
[1:04:40] after her beauty wooing means to flirt
[1:04:43] yeah oh she dressed herself real sexy
[1:04:46] and she walked before him and she te
[1:04:48] like some of the little teenagers of the
[1:04:49] day and so forth and when you act like
[1:04:51] something another a strip te trying to
[1:04:53] WB woo Samson to her number 21 Samson
[1:04:59] ought to have made his first stop when
[1:05:02] deila flirted her eyes at him he ought
[1:05:05] to have turned his head and walked on
[1:05:08] right Samson stopped and got in trouble
[1:05:11] Eve stopped and got in trouble right
[1:05:13] there Eve stopped just for a moment she
[1:05:14] got in trouble Samson stopped for a
[1:05:15] moment got in trouble amen and when the
[1:05:17] world presents something to the church
[1:05:18] or an individual don't stop keep moving
[1:05:21] amen that's what the church needs
[1:05:22] tonight don't stop for these intellect
[1:05:24] classical Pride keep moving on in the
[1:05:25] Holy Spirit right all right next 23 or
[1:05:30] 22 now if a man goes out here and is
[1:05:32] married to a man she goes out and makes
[1:05:34] love with another man and has an affairs
[1:05:36] with him and comes back to her husband
[1:05:38] he should kick her out is that right
[1:05:39] right she must be true to him cuz she is
[1:05:41] vowed to him and the bride of Christ is
[1:05:43] vowed to Christ and he is the word not
[1:05:46] even wink at the other side amen a woman
[1:05:49] should not even wink at another man
[1:05:51] right amen she shouldn't make no signs
[1:05:54] no emotion at all toward him right for
[1:05:57] she is absolutely a bride to one
[1:05:59] bridegroom amen we don't want none of
[1:06:02] your mix trees your denomination be true
[1:06:03] to Christ the word he'll vindicate it
[1:06:05] true no sir not even any emotion of
[1:06:07] anything toward making love to him not
[1:06:09] join his Reigns or anything else or let
[1:06:12] him get you in his arms or in his care
[1:06:14] right or talk or talk to you over this
[1:06:16] way that way you listen only to One
[1:06:19] Voice amen my sheep know my voice a
[1:06:21] stranger they'll not what is his voice
[1:06:23] any man's voice is his word right and
[1:06:25] this is it the Bible not one word added
[1:06:28] to it or taken from it you stay with
[1:06:29] that voice all right next one number 23
[1:06:32] that's the reason many times today that
[1:06:34] a sinner is still wandering about a
[1:06:37] beautiful young girl will cut off the
[1:06:38] locks of her hair to be popular paint up
[1:06:41] her face to make her look pretty put on
[1:06:44] clothes to show the form of her being
[1:06:47] right watch that
[1:06:50] now watch that here in this church yeah
[1:06:52] you put on Godly cloes looking but if it
[1:06:55] cleans everything you got right what's
[1:06:58] brother Brown trying to say and what am
[1:06:59] I trying to
[1:07:01] say if if it's if it's too close to the
[1:07:03] line it's wrong right just say if it's
[1:07:06] too close to the line it's wrong that's
[1:07:08] all you got to say put Don't Close Your
[1:07:10] form of being cuz it's the only thing
[1:07:11] that she can find finding somewhere to
[1:07:13] try to find something to come back to
[1:07:16] her when she can cause men to whistle at
[1:07:18] her wave at her flirt with her young men
[1:07:21] will do the same thing to a woman try to
[1:07:22] make itself attractive to her
[1:07:24] neighbors will build a house and fix a
[1:07:26] certain way cuz it look a little better
[1:07:27] than the neighbor's placees all the time
[1:07:29] we are seeking for something and
[1:07:30] something keeps going just a little
[1:07:33] above it all
[1:07:34] right number 24 now it's not wrong
[1:07:37] listen it's not wrong to dress up and be
[1:07:39] nice right you need to dress up if you
[1:07:42] go on a date you need to dress up like
[1:07:44] brother Bown said you don't need to stop
[1:07:45] your car in the driveway and blow the
[1:07:47] horn he said you go get that girl if
[1:07:50] you're going to date her you go get her
[1:07:52] all right right amen you you cannot have
[1:07:55] an eternal Foundation upon popularity
[1:07:59] right that's the great sin of America is
[1:08:01] trying to be popular women trying to
[1:08:04] dress popular men trying to act popular
[1:08:07] all these little things going on the way
[1:08:10] it's taking place I don't have to start
[1:08:12] on that the first night but I didn't say
[1:08:14] the third night or the second we'll
[1:08:16] Coast on that tonight but being popular
[1:08:19] popularity usually leads to sin and dis
[1:08:23] Grace right certainly it does three or
[1:08:27] four marriages and all kinds of stuff
[1:08:30] and it has no
[1:08:32] Eternal Foundation right
[1:08:35] flirting flirting is wrong amen

[1:08:45] listen we're going to go on down through
[1:08:47] the to the end of it remember what we
[1:08:50] talking about getting close but not but
[1:08:52] not getting over the line but getting
[1:08:53] close but watch this all right listen

[1:08:56] law is light and reproofs of instruction
[1:08:58] of the way of life to keep thee from the
[1:09:00] evil woman from the flattery of the
[1:09:02] tongue of a strange woman lust not after
[1:09:05] her beauty in thine heart neither let
[1:09:06] her take thee with her eyelids now we
[1:09:08] stop there but listen 26
[1:09:11] 2728 for by means of a horish woman a
[1:09:14] man is brought to a piece of bread yeah
