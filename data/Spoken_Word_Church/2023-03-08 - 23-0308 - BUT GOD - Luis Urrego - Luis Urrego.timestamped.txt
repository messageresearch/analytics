[2:03] that each one of us could could could we
[2:06] could stay here all night just just
[2:09] talking about the times amen that Satan
[2:12] had come in amen and and and tried to uh
[2:15] ruin our lives and and and stepped in
[2:18] and and but God Amen came on the
[2:23] scene and changed the whole thing praise
[2:26] the Lord Jesus amen so I and looking at
[2:30] this here I want to I want to look at um
[2:32] you know in the previous chapter Paul
[2:35] mentions and he's talking about Jesus
[2:37] Christ and how God had raised him up and
[2:40] had sit him and and and and and put him
[2:43] Above All Things amen and then in verse
[2:46] 22 of Ephesians chapter 1 he says and
[2:49] hath put all things under his feet and
[2:53] gave him to be the head over all things
[2:56] to the church amen and watch what he
[3:00] says in the last verse of that chapter
[3:01] it says which is his body the fullness
[3:04] of him that filth all in all so he's
[3:08] calling you and I the church amen his
[3:10] body praise the Lord Jesus he is the
[3:12] head we are the body amen and wherever
[3:14] the head thinks whatever the head thinks
[3:16] that's where the body goes amen my arm
[3:18] cannot move unless my mind my my my my
[3:21] brain thought about it right praise God
[3:24] see my I got a thinking
[3:26] brain right now your body will will not
[3:30] move unless your brain thinks about it
[3:31] first same thing with the word amen if
[3:33] he is the head amen you will not move
[3:36] unless the head says so praise the Lord
[3:39] unless the head tells me so amen that's
[3:42] when I move unless the word tells me so
[3:44] that's when I move praise God I don't
[3:47] have to follow the philos philosophies
[3:48] of man I don't have to go by amen about
[3:51] the the the the the the things of this
[3:53] life amen if the word says so that's
[3:56] where I'll stand praise God I'd rather
[3:58] be in front of God amen dying for his
[4:01] word amen testifying hey Lord I stood
[4:04] for your word and I stood
[4:06] firm amen amen then to be ashamed amen
[4:11] one day because I didn't stand for all
[4:13] of his word amen and then in chapter two
[4:17] it says he says here and you he
[4:19] continues the thought he says and you
[4:22] hath he quickened now he's he makes it
[4:25] personal he makes it and you haveth he
[4:28] quickened amen what is quickened amen
[4:30] Quicken is means to make alive amen he
[4:34] he he hath quickened who were
[4:36] dead in trespasses and sins praise the
[4:40] Lord Jesus who were dead in trespasses
[4:43] and sins amen it reminds me back of
[4:45] Romans chap 6:2 where it says that you
[4:48] were dead to
[4:49] sin dead to sin how can you be dead to
[4:52] sin and still live in it you see now
[4:55] here we were dead in trespasses and sins
[4:58] amen but now as Christians amen we
[5:00] should be dead to sin praise the Lord
[5:04] but here we were dead in trespasses and
[5:06] sins you know uh we we were we were
[5:09] actually walking
[5:11] zombies all right they they're the
[5:13] living dead right it's what the world
[5:15] tells us amen and then they're they're
[5:18] they're dead but with a semblance of
[5:20] life that's what a zombie is and that's
[5:23] what you and I were amen before Christ
[5:25] came and changed our lives amen you were
[5:28] dead and you were but yet you were
[5:29] walking you were following the rudiments
[5:32] of this world you were you you were
[5:34] moving and you think that you were
[5:36] getting somewhere but you were dead
[5:38] while you were yet
[5:40] alive how many can say you were
[5:43] dead I was dead amen I have no I had no
[5:47] life amen we were numb amen insensitive
[5:51] amen callous to sin right amen we they
[5:55] we did things amen and it didn't bother
[5:57] us one bit brother but the way testify
[6:00] he says he'd go and get a beer amen or
[6:02] go drink beer or or or or whatever
[6:04] didn't bother him one bit go out and
[6:08] caral it didn't bother one bit amen go
[6:11] out to the bar it didn't bother you one
[6:13] bit amen you were calloused you were
[6:15] dead amen and that's what Paul is saying
[6:18] here who were dead in trespasses and
[6:21] sins praise the Lord that's why the
[6:24] Bible says that we need to be born
[6:26] again because you were born dead am you
[6:31] there's already you were born dead on
[6:33] arriv
[6:35] Ral you that that's the reason and
[6:38] sometimes sometimes our young people say
[6:39] why do I need to be born again for what
[6:41] what I'm not I'm not steal I'm not
[6:43] robbing banks I'm not killing anybody
[6:46] I'm not doing this but you were the
[6:47] Bible says that you were born
[6:50] dead praise the Lord have you ever told
[6:52] a
[6:55] lie if you can't say that you've never
[6:57] told a lie amen you're you're sinning
[7:00] right
[7:01] there amen we all have sinned the Bible
[7:04] says and come short of the glory of God
[7:07] Amen so Paul's here is saying and you
[7:10] who hath he quickened amen now I like
[7:12] that he brings in first you hath he
[7:15] quickened amen he's made you alive you
[7:19] who were dead he has made you alive
[7:22] verse two wherein in time pass ye walked
[7:26] according to the course of this world
[7:29] according to the prince of the power of
[7:31] the Earth the spirit that now worketh in
[7:33] the children of
[7:34] Disobedience you know Saints we we don't
[7:37] wrestle against flesh and blood but
[7:40] against powers and principalities amen
[7:43] against the spirits amen and this is
[7:45] what Paul is saying here against the
[7:47] prince of the power of the air the
[7:49] spirit that now worketh in the children
[7:51] of Disobedience but thank God Amen that
[7:54] he amen has changed our lives amen we
[7:57] don't have to be children of
[7:58] Disobedience anymore prise praise the
[7:59] Lord Jesus the spirit that now worketh
[8:02] in the children of Disobedience were you
[8:05] a child of
[8:07] Disobedience amen I mean I could just I
[8:11] I remember my my myself you know
[8:14] disobeying my
[8:15] parents and paying for it
[8:19] too you w going to get away with it you
[8:22] thought you'd get get away with it and
[8:25] and if you can't get away with it from
[8:26] your parents how much more God you get
[8:29] older and that's the reason why it's so
[8:31] important us as parents Amen to take
[8:34] care of that right there and then cuz
[8:36] they'll learn hey you disobey am you're
[8:38] going to get you're going to suffer the
[8:40] consequences and that's why people we we
[8:44] got these people growing up later on in
[8:46] life and they feel like there's no
[8:47] consequences of the things that they do
[8:50] cuz they never suffered consequences
[8:52] when they were younger and they get
[8:54] older and they do and and
[8:57] undo and they don't feel con
[8:59] consequences for it because mom and dad
[9:01] is always there to bail them out or her
[9:04] out you see so it's very important amen
[9:09] that uh that that that we do that amen I
[9:12] better stop before I get in
[9:14] trouble
[9:16] but according to the prince of the power
[9:19] of the air the spirit that now worketh
[9:21] in the children of Disobedience amen now
[9:24] verse three it says among whom also we
[9:26] all had our conversation in in times
[9:29] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[9:34] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[9:36] and we by Nature the children of Wrath
[9:40] as others
[9:41] amen amen so we see here from verse one
[9:46] this is what's this is what's being dead
[9:49] in sins and in in and in trespasses amen
[9:52] is what what Paul said this is exactly
[9:55] what what being dead in sins and in
[9:57] trespasses we were all had our
[9:59] conversation in times past in the lust
[10:01] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[10:03] the flesh you weren't thinking of God I
[10:06] wasn't thinking of God Amen but God was
[10:09] thinking of you the whole time go ahead
[10:12] and let him get to a point where I can
[10:14] really really really get a hold of him
[10:16] or her go ahead go ahead I'm just
[10:19] waiting for that right
[10:20] time where he can where where you he can
[10:24] soften you up amen and in in such a way
[10:28] am amen where you can't do nothing but
[10:31] get back to God praise the Lord Jesus so
[10:34] let that's how you and I
[10:36] were amen we have to get to the worst of
[10:39] the worst amen amen in order for us to
[10:44] realize that we needed him amen and so
[10:47] we see our young people we see family
[10:51] members we see people in in in in in in
[10:54] in our day amen people that we live with
[10:56] friends amen even people that we go to
[10:59] church with amen taking these same
[11:01] routes and the best thing that you and I
[11:04] could do is just let go
[11:06] amen let go and let God do the work cuz
[11:12] when God does the work amen it's going
[11:13] to be done perfect amen yes it's going
[11:17] to be done good because you and I were
[11:20] in the same condition and it took us
[11:23] amen it took us to be in that condition
[11:25] for us to realize we needed
[11:27] him
[11:29] amen so we were dead in sins amen
[11:33] lusting amen sinning drinking cursing
[11:36] doing everything amen and it didn't
[11:38] bother us one bit amen praise the Lord
[11:41] Jesus fulfilling the desires of the
[11:43] Flesh and of the mind and where by
[11:45] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[11:47] others now I like it that Paul also he
[11:50] mentions he puts himself in there as
[11:52] well he says we he doesn't say just you
[11:56] he says we he included himself also in
[11:59] there praise the Lord Jesus the pastor
[12:02] and the the the the the the Ley all
[12:06] along they but they need the new birth
[12:09] amen we all need the new birth but verse
[12:12] four says this it says but
[12:14] God but God Amen but God makes it makes
[12:19] a
[12:20] difference amen because whatever was
[12:23] before but amen it's changed after
[12:27] but amen you you could say uh uh I was I
[12:31] was driving down the road uh uh uh and
[12:35] and I was I was going this speed and and
[12:38] and then a car pulled out in front of me
[12:40] but
[12:41] then amen I slammed on the brakes just
[12:46] in time and it changed the whole thing
[12:49] you see and this is what Paul is trying
[12:51] to tell us right here but God Amen he's
[12:54] the one that makes the difference he's
[12:56] the one that makes the change amen he's
[12:58] the one one that that that that makes
[13:01] things amen look good amen when they
[13:04] don't look good amen but God who is rich
[13:07] in Mercy amen for his great love where
[13:10] withth he loved us amen I'm so glad that
[13:13] he uh he is full of Mercy rich in Mercy
[13:17] not just rich in in in in in money amen
[13:20] thisen what look what brother brandham
[13:21] says here and in in and the brothers
[13:23] could bring it up he
[13:26] says he says in the message
[13:29] The God Who is rich in Mercy he says I
[13:32] want you to notice here of the Prophet
[13:34] Apostle rather Paul who how he made
[13:37] mention of this how you hath he
[13:39] quickened who were once dead you hath he
[13:42] quickened who were once dead dead in sin
[13:44] and trespasses walking after the things
[13:47] of the world the desires of Flesh and
[13:50] fulfilling the desires of the mind has
[13:53] what caused this what caused this change
[13:55] see
[13:56] yes what caused this change you see what
[13:59] caused this from one time being dead to
[14:01] quickened am amen what caused that
[14:04] change quickened means Made Alive there
[14:07] was a change from Death unto life
[14:09] there's no other there's no other thing
[14:11] that could happen to any person so great
[14:14] as the changing from Death to
[14:17] life let's read that again there's no
[14:19] greater thing that could happen to any
[14:22] person so great as the changing from
[14:25] Death to life amen remember we were all
[14:29] in sins and trespasses amen but we were
[14:33] saved amen but we came to we I mean but
[14:37] God was seeking us amen praise the Lord
[14:41] to any person so great as the changing
[14:43] from Death To Life a man if he was dying
[14:45] physically and could be healed
[14:47] physically that would be a great thing
[14:50] but nothing so great as when he is
[14:52] spiritually dead and God has quickened
[14:55] him to
[14:57] life amen how many believe that that can
[15:00] happen how many can say that you've
[15:02] experienced that praise the
[15:05] Lord so if if you've experienced it in
[15:08] your life amen then there's a chance
[15:11] amen an opportunity by the mercy of God
[15:14] that it can happen to your family member
[15:16] that it can happen to your children that
[15:18] it can happen to that loved one amen
[15:19] that you've been crying and praying for
[15:21] such a long time amen but God let God do
[15:25] the work amen amen when when I try to do
[15:28] the work amen it it will fail but God
[15:32] Amen that makes the difference
[15:34] spiritually dead and God has qu Quicken
[15:36] him to life you once in times Past Dead
[15:39] you were dead even many here tonight one
[15:42] time can look back and know that you
[15:45] were dead amen but now why aren why
[15:49] aren't you dead tonight as you were then
[15:52] you deserve to be the that way because
[15:54] you was a sinner but God who is rich in
[15:58] Mercy
[15:59] that's the thing right there God who was
[16:01] rich all these things that we were but
[16:05] God that made the change right there God
[16:09] who is rich in Mercy oh I'm so glad for
[16:12] that he being rich in Mercy if he was
[16:15] just rich in money if he was just rich
[16:17] in materials which he is amen but yet
[16:22] the greatest thing is being rich in
[16:24] Mercy oh what a great word that is
[16:28] praise the Lord Jesus how that we were
[16:30] once dead amen amen I like the way
[16:33] brother Brandon put that there praise
[16:35] the Lord am so Paul here amen speaking
[16:39] in verse verses 1 through3 speaking
[16:42] about how dead we
[16:44] were reminding us of where we come from
[16:47] and then in the next several verses the
[16:50] whole thing changes but God praise the
[16:53] Lord Jesus so wonderful Amen to know
[16:56] that God can change the situation who is
[16:58] rich in Mercy for his great love amen it
[17:01] doesn't just say his is he has Mercy but
[17:05] it says rich in Mercy amen and it
[17:08] doesn't say that he just has love amen
[17:10] but great love wherewith he loved us in
[17:15] so much amen that he was willing to die
[17:16] on a cross for you to take your place
[17:19] praise the Lord
[17:21] Jesus and you know Saints you know the
[17:23] the the the the story of the Cross
[17:25] doesn't see seems like it doesn't do
[17:27] anything for us anymore great that's a
[17:29] dangerous ground to be on when the story
[17:32] of the Cross doesn't seem to move you
[17:34] anymore doesn't seem to do anything for
[17:36] you amen that's that's dangerous Crown
[17:40] amen but I'm so I'm so glad because
[17:43] that's where he displayed his great
[17:45] love amen even when we were dead in sins
[17:49] hath quickened us together with Christ
[17:52] by grace are you saved now I want to I
[17:55] want us to go to to John chapter John
[17:58] chapter 2 amen uh is it John Chapter 2
[18:01] the brothers have it up there John chap
[18:03] 11 I'm
[18:06] sorry John chapter
[18:08] 11 because Paul he he's talking about
[18:12] here about a people who were Dead
[18:15] Walking Dead amen but now who are alive
[18:20] now we know that God Amen he he he he he
[18:25] wherever he's at amen there's
[18:27] Resurrection yeah there can't be there
[18:29] can't be death amen wherever he's at
[18:32] there can't be anything dead amen
[18:34] whenever he's around praise the Lord and
[18:36] so we're looking here at the at at at at
[18:38] the story of of uh of Lazarus amen and I
[18:42] just want to point out a few things here
[18:44] we're not going to read the whole
[18:45] chapter we'll just kind of skip through
[18:46] it and it says here now certain man was
[18:49] sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town
[18:51] of Mary and her sister Martha it was
[18:53] that Mary which anointed the Lord with
[18:55] ointment and wiped his feet with her
[18:56] hair whose brother Lazar was sick
[18:59] therefore his sister sent unto him
[19:01] saying Lord Behold Him whom thou lovest
[19:04] is sick when Jesus heard that he said
[19:06] this
[19:07] sickness is not unto death but for the
[19:11] glory of
[19:13] God
[19:14] Amen the sickness is not unto death but
[19:17] for the glory of God that's going to
[19:20] make the difference right there amen
[19:22] that the Son of God watch that the Son
[19:25] of God might be glorified thereby so
[19:29] Jesus wasn't wasn't concerned I mean I'm
[19:31] sure in his human ways he
[19:33] was but he knew that this was the
[19:36] sickness was to glorify him to glorify
[19:39] God now Jesus loved Martha and her
[19:42] sister and Lazarus when he had heard
[19:44] therefore that he was sick he Abode two
[19:46] days still in the same place where he
[19:48] was can you imagine
[19:51] that amen can you imagine Jesus hearing
[19:53] that you're
[19:55] sick and he waits and you ask the lord
[20:00] lord I've been going through this for
[20:03] weeks now been going in and out of of
[20:06] therapy sessions and and chemotherapy
[20:08] and doing all this and and it seems like
[20:11] the Lord doesn't
[20:12] answer that's exactly what was happening
[20:15] here with Lazarus and and and and and
[20:17] and the two sisters I mean Lazarus was
[20:19] dead Lazarus didn't know what was going
[20:21] on right his two sisters were the ones
[20:24] who called for Jesus to come amen and
[20:28] they thought that every time that he
[20:29] would call them that they would call
[20:31] them he could just
[20:33] come but he didn't he
[20:37] didn't he didn't he says then after that
[20:40] let's see he Abode two days still in the
[20:43] same place where he was in other words
[20:46] he waited then after that Seth he to his
[20:49] disciples let us go into Judea again two
[20:53] days he waited while Lazarus was sick
[20:57] yeah
[20:59] yeah you know sometimes we we're asking
[21:03] the Lord day after day after
[21:06] day it doesn't matter when the Lord's
[21:08] going to do things amen just believe
[21:10] that God will do things amen praise God
[21:13] just believe that he will amen because
[21:17] he promised it in his word his disciples
[21:20] say unto him Master the Jews of late Sal
[21:22] to Stone thee and goest thou dither
[21:23] again Jesus answered are there not let's
[21:26] let's just skip down
[21:30] but if a man walk in the night he
[21:32] stumbleth because there is no light in
[21:34] him these things said he verse 11 and
[21:37] after that he said unto them our friend
[21:39] Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may
[21:44] awake him out of
[21:46] sleep but I amen is he the one that's
[21:50] going to make the difference praise the
[21:52] Lord Jesus now you have to believe that
[21:54] amen you have to stand firm on what God
[21:57] Said in in his word amen because he
[21:59] doesn't have to do things exactly right
[22:01] then when you ask him to brother no he
[22:05] has a better he knows exactly what you
[22:08] need it's just like us as parents we
[22:11] can't give our children everything at
[22:13] the right M every time they ask us amen
[22:17] because it doesn't work that way it
[22:20] can't work that way later on they become
[22:23] spoiled and they expect for you to give
[22:26] them everything and they expect it right
[22:29] there and
[22:31] then and God doesn't want us to be
[22:33] spoiled
[22:35] brats so he makes us wait for his time
[22:39] not our time for his time see Jesus
[22:43] could have gone he could he could have
[22:44] heard the the news and said let's go
[22:47] let's go right away let's go take care
[22:49] of this he could have done it but he had
[22:50] to wait up the father first to show him
[22:54] maybe the father already showed him what
[22:56] to do and that's what he needed to to do
[22:58] but that was for the benefit of Martha
[23:00] and and and and Mary but I go that I may
[23:04] awake him out of sleep then said his
[23:06] disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do
[23:08] well let's skip down to verse 14 then
[23:10] said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is
[23:13] dead and I am glad for your sakes that I
[23:17] was not there can you imagine the Lord
[23:19] Jesus saying such a
[23:22] thing I am glad that I wasn't
[23:26] there you real like what kind of Jesus
[23:28] am I serving that would tell me such a
[23:31] thing I'm glad I didn't heal you when
[23:34] you asked me to heal you I'm glad I
[23:37] didn't save your child at the moment
[23:39] when you asked me to I'm glad I didn't
[23:42] do this and that or the other amen cuz
[23:45] I've got I'm working on something right
[23:47] now it's going to be such a it's going
[23:49] to be so great it's going to be much
[23:52] better than just amen your child coming
[23:55] to the Lord amen cuz because everybody's
[23:58] going to be worked
[24:00] on from the mom and the dad to the
[24:02] sisters to the to the family the church
[24:05] house even amen something good is going
[24:07] to come out of this everybody will know
[24:10] amen that God saved my child that God
[24:14] Amen somebody everybody's going to be
[24:16] affected by it praise the Lord everybody
[24:19] is going to be affected by the healing
[24:21] of your body it ain't just going to be
[24:22] for you it ain't just going to be amen
[24:25] for you or your husband amen it's going
[24:27] to be for everybody to give me praise I
[24:30] will get the glory out of this amen from
[24:33] everyone Hallelujah that's how God likes
[24:36] to do things amen he looks at the whole
[24:39] picture and not just at the moment where
[24:42] of what you're asking him at the moment
[24:44] because he knows exactly what you need
[24:47] amen eventually and you know what that
[24:50] makes it that makes it even a greater
[24:52] Miracle then amen the fact that he made
[24:55] you wait yes right not that he couldn't
[24:58] do it he could do it right there and
[24:59] then sure but the fact that he you
[25:02] having to wait amen brings patience amen
[25:07] amen brings faith in his word amen
[25:10] brings calm amen amen and lets you give
[25:15] things over to him that and says Lord
[25:19] I'm done worrying about this you take
[25:21] care of
[25:22] it amen you take care of it and what you
[25:28] know it's when when when you know when
[25:29] when when you're looking for something
[25:32] around your
[25:33] house and you know you're looking for it
[25:35] and and you can't find
[25:37] it you're just looking for it everywhere
[25:40] and you can't find it let's say it's
[25:42] it's it's it's the those who had watch
[25:45] TV at the house amen maybe you're
[25:47] looking for the remote
[25:49] amen and you can't find it so you go and
[25:51] buy a universal remote from the store
[25:53] and when you walk into the door there's
[25:56] your remote right there that's right
[25:58] that you were looking and searching
[26:00] through all your house you sort of pick
[26:02] up the the the the cushion from the
[26:03] couch and there was the remote right
[26:05] there the whole
[26:06] time amen well that's what's God that
[26:09] that's how God does things
[26:11] amen he gives you a double
[26:15] blessing you get two remotes
[26:18] [Laughter]
[26:22] now just just that's my analogy but you
[26:26] shouldn't have TV at your house anyway
[26:31] but speaking of TV amen this is worse
[26:36] all right this is this is worse I mean
[26:38] TV ain't nothing anymore I don't even
[26:40] know who still watches
[26:42] TV it's that's old
[26:45] now who has who still has cable and all
[26:48] that stuff and nobody hardly ever does
[26:50] that anymore cuz it's all here this is
[26:53] more dangerous
[26:54] now We Got the Whole World in Your Hands
[26:57] to you know just a couple limited
[26:59] channels on a TV but anyway let me get
[27:01] off that but you got two remotes
[27:05] now
[27:07] amen see now when you wait God gives you
[27:11] a double
[27:13] blessing because it's not just now amen
[27:16] what you were praying for that's
[27:17] answered but God was working on you the
[27:19] whole time as well amen God was working
[27:23] on others amen and God Amen does things
[27:27] perfect
[27:29] amen amen where we were at here then
[27:33] when Jesus came he found that he had lay
[27:35] in the grave four days
[27:38] already now he wouldn't have been laying
[27:40] in the grave four days
[27:42] already if he had went when Martha and
[27:45] Lazarus had asked for him we wouldn't be
[27:48] reading this in the in the Bible do you
[27:51] I believe that when he would have gotten
[27:52] there Lazarus would have been raised
[27:54] from the dead actually he wouldn't have
[27:57] died he would would have been able to
[27:58] heal him right but it's a greater
[28:01] Miracle after he died it's a better
[28:04] thing amen because he was dead amen
[28:08] but God steps on the scene and it
[28:11] becomes a greater Miracle then praise
[28:13] the Lord
[28:14] Jesus now Bethany was nigh unto
[28:16] Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off I don't
[28:19] know exactly how much is 15 furlongs but
[28:25] um it doesn't seem like maybe he was
[28:27] wasn't too he was he wasn't too far off
[28:29] and many of the Jews came to Martha and
[28:31] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[28:33] brother then Martha as soon as she heard
[28:35] I like this right here then Martha as
[28:37] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[28:41] went and met him she just heard that
[28:44] Jesus was coming and she went to go meet
[28:46] him she didn't know if he was coming or
[28:48] not she just
[28:49] heard I'm going to go meet him amen
[28:53] that's the same thing with you and I
[28:54] Saints amen when the Bible tells us so
[28:57] amen or you just hear it from the word
[28:59] you heard that preacher say it amen you
[29:01] take that upon your heart and you say
[29:03] Lord I believe that with all my heart
[29:04] I'm putting it into action I'm going to
[29:07] meet you right there
[29:10] amen then Martha as soon as she heard
[29:12] that Jesus was com and went and met him
[29:14] but Mary sat still in the house then
[29:18] said Martha unto Jesus Lord what what's
[29:21] the the the the the how how how Martha
[29:24] approaches him if thou had us been here
[29:28] my brother had not
[29:30] died Amen in other words Lord I know
[29:34] that you he would still be alive if you
[29:36] were if you if you were here in other
[29:39] words he's letting him you know he's
[29:40] he's she's praising him amen You Are the
[29:44] Healer you are the Savior you are the
[29:47] one amen but I know watch J says but I
[29:51] know amen that even now who whatsoever
[29:56] thou will ask ask of God God will give
[29:59] it to thee amen I know that my my my my
[30:03] brother he he he wouldn't have died if
[30:07] you were here amen but I know
[30:10] now the fact that you're here I know
[30:13] that whatever you ask him amen God will
[30:16] grant it to him Jesus said unto her thy
[30:20] Brothers not might Rise Again thy
[30:24] brother shall rise again amen what a
[30:27] positive word that God God gave her amen
[30:31] and everywhere you look in the Bible
[30:33] amen it's what Paul was talking to us
[30:35] there in Ephesians amen it was a
[30:37] positive word to you and I amen we were
[30:39] dead but we are alive amen walking in
[30:43] him but I know that even now whatsoever
[30:46] oh Jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[30:48] rise again Martha said unto him I know
[30:51] that he shall rise again in the
[30:52] resurrection at the last day Jesus said
[30:54] unto her I am the resurrection am
[30:57] you got to know that he
[30:59] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[31:03] that diligently seek Him amen not that
[31:06] he was that's wonderful and not that he
[31:08] will amen but that he is right now
[31:11] praise
[31:13] God I am the resurrection and the life
[31:17] he that believeth in me though he were
[31:20] dead right yet shall he live yes and
[31:24] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[31:27] shall never
[31:29] die and the question is believest thou
[31:32] this amen I I was asking the young
[31:36] people there in in Honduras this in one
[31:39] of the services there in at the the
[31:41] Youth Camp believest thou this do you
[31:44] believe that what God Said in his word

[31:52] in your life letting go of of of of
[31:54] these things that that take a hold of
[31:56] you amen that are amen do you believe
[31:58] that God can do
[32:00] it amen cuz they have a custom amen
[32:04] custom time and time again they go up to
[32:07] the front asking the Lord Lord please
[32:10] save me please fill me with the Holy
[32:12] Ghost and and I said why don't you just
[32:14] come and believe that God can do it go
[32:17] to your seat believ it and stay
[32:19] believing believe do you believe what he
[32:22] said in your word about you praise
[32:26] God that's the problem with us amen we
[32:28] we we we feel like there's something
[32:30] more that we have to do there's still
[32:33] little something that some unturned
[32:35] Corner that amen when all he asked
[32:38] Martha is do you believe what I'm
[32:39] telling you is the truth do you believe
[32:42] that I can do
[32:44] this do you believe that God can heal
[32:46] your
[32:47] body amen do you believe that God can
[32:51] touch your your children do you believe
[32:53] that God can do whatever amen it is
[32:55] that's that's the problem the four walls
[32:58] around your life amen do you believe
[33:00] that he
[33:01] can we see many examples in the word
[33:04] where he has amen
[33:06] amen you take a look at uh you take a
[33:09] look at at at at Joseph's life amen
[33:13] Joseph's life let's let's let's read
[33:15] here in in in Acts chapter 7 I didn't
[33:17] give this to the brothers but the the
[33:19] brothers can bring it up Acts
[33:22] 7:7 it says and the nation to whom they
[33:24] shall be in bondage will I judge said
[33:27] God and after that they after that shall
[33:30] they come forth and serve me in this
[33:32] place and he gave him the Covenant of
[33:34] circumcision so Abraham begat Isaac and
[33:36] circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac
[33:39] begat Jacob and Jacob begat the 12
[33:41] Patriarchs and the Patriarchs moved with
[33:44] Envy sold Joseph into
[33:49] Egypt but God was with
[33:54] him amen the situ situation look Grim
[33:59] can you imagine Joseph a teenager going
[34:02] to go he was obeying his dad taking him
[34:04] food they were out in the in out in the
[34:08] fields you know doing their shepherding
[34:11] and and doing what they were doing and
[34:13] here comes Joseph you know just happy
[34:15] you know and he's got food and and and
[34:18] and and
[34:20] thinking that his brothers loved him
[34:23] and and some of them had such a hate for
[34:26] him
[34:27] cuz they were jealous of
[34:30] him I don't know if you have seen the
[34:31] movie that the movie Joseph it's it's
[34:34] it's it's a good one to
[34:36] watch and he's he's happy he's like
[34:39] Brethren my brethren and he he's and
[34:42] there like what does he want now that
[34:44] dreamer that you know they were just
[34:47] they were they were they were they were
[34:49] jealous of him and they sold him you
[34:53] know the story they sold him Amen to to
[34:56] to slavery just imagine a teenage boy
[34:58] about 15 16 years old I don't know just
[35:01] hearing that people crying and saying
[35:03] I'll take I I I'll give you this and
[35:05] this and that and he's he's wondering
[35:07] what's going on what where's my brethren
[35:09] and he's probably crying out right there
[35:11] in the in in and maybe he's still in the
[35:13] pit I don't know maybe they they took
[35:15] him out he's in Chains obviously and
[35:18] he's he's bound he can't do anything and
[35:21] his brothers are right there selling him
[35:25] before him in front of
[35:28] him I don't think we're in that bad of a
[35:33] shape some of us I know some of us were
[35:36] going through some tough
[35:39] things a teenage boy going through that
[35:42] thing and then he goes to the house of
[35:45] Piper so sold to the house of Piper and
[35:47] and and and and then the Lord starts
[35:51] working in his life and using him and
[35:53] and then Here Comes Piper's wife accuses
[35:55] him of of of of of doing something that
[35:58] he didn't do and he gets thrown into a
[36:00] prison amen gets thrown into a prison
[36:03] where he's there with the with the
[36:05] Butler and and and the and the bread the
[36:07] the the the other the baker
[36:12] yes and they have dreams and God Amen if
[36:16] he wasn't in that situation he would not
[36:18] have been able to interpret dreams
[36:20] because it was through that situation
[36:22] that he was able to get out of there
[36:24] amen and and and and and and and come
[36:26] higher amen so he needed to be in that
[36:30] prison he needed to be accused falsely
[36:34] he needed to be sold to Egypt so that he
[36:36] could Ascend to the point where he where
[36:38] he got to amen that's why the Bible said
[36:42] but God was with him the whole time
[36:45] everything that looked grim and looked
[36:47] bad but God was with him it just doesn't
[36:50] seem like it Lord I don't see where you
[36:53] are with me I'm I I I'm still I'm still
[36:56] sick I'm still feeling pain I'm still uh
[36:59] feeling all these things but God
[37:02] promised that he would be with you even
[37:05] in you to the end of the world it didn't
[37:09] matter how much cancer was going through
[37:11] your body it didn't matter how much uh
[37:14] you know your family is not serving the
[37:16] lord it didn't matter it doesn't matter
[37:18] if the whole church backslides
[37:21] amen God promised that he would be with
[37:24] you just as he said he would be with
[37:28] Joseph but God was with him and and
[37:30] watch in verse 10 and delivered him out
[37:33] of all his
[37:34] afflictions and gave him favor and
[37:37] wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of
[37:41] Egypt and he made him Governor over
[37:45] Egypt and all his
[37:51] house it all started with him being sold
[37:54] as a teenager right and
[37:57] being lied about and being hated by his
[38:00] Brethren his own
[38:03] Brethren to being pretty much second in
[38:06] command in Egypt and we know the story
[38:09] later on you know he saves his family
[38:11] because of that through the famine
[38:13] amen what a wonderful thing am amen we
[38:16] could read throughout the Bible amen all
[38:19] the different things the children of
[38:20] Israel crossing the Red Sea amen here it
[38:22] comes oh they were praising the Lord
[38:24] thank God he took us out with a mighty
[38:26] hand and they come to the Red Sea and
[38:29] here comes the Egyptians on behind them
[38:32] there's mountains on the left there's
[38:33] mountains on the right and a big red sea
[38:36] right in front of
[38:38] them but
[38:40] God
[38:42] Amen but God Amen Moses couldn't open
[38:46] the sea neither could the people amen
[38:48] but God was able to open the sea amen
[38:51] and they crossed on dry
[38:53] ground but they had to get to that point
[38:56] yep right if you think that you can
[38:59] become a Christian and not have a bad
[39:01] day in your life you're mistaken you
[39:03] signed up for the wrong
[39:06] thing
[39:08] amen you're going to have bad days
[39:11] you're going to have bad
[39:13] years right you it could be they could
[39:17] be very bad times but he promised but he
[39:21] promised that he would never leave us
[39:24] and he promised that we would our trials
[39:26] we would come out like
[39:29] gold gold is only beautiful when it goes
[39:32] through the fire amen when you find gold
[39:35] out there right next to the river bank
[39:36] and all that stuff it's not as
[39:38] beautiful it's not as pretty and that's
[39:40] how you and me are right when we start
[39:42] serving the lord and we come fresh and
[39:44] all that we're just like gold right
[39:46] there from the bank of the river you
[39:48] know God's taking us out amen maybe
[39:51] setting us aside for a little bit but it
[39:54] takes for him to start amen putting us
[39:56] through the the fire right amen and
[39:58] taking the dross out of our Lives amen
[40:01] and until he sees his own image
[40:04] reflected on that
[40:06] gold he ain't done with you
[40:08] yet and we going to have we're going to
[40:11] have good days and we're going to have
[40:13] bad days we're going to have good days
[40:16] and we're going to have good days and
[40:18] we're going to have good days and we're
[40:20] going to have really bad days and we're
[40:22] and that's probably going to go keep
[40:24] going amen bad bad bad bad maybe a year
[40:27] 2 3 4 5 years amen then a really good
[40:30] day and then immediately the next day
[40:32] another bad day amen but it's how you
[40:36] react to those things is God true or not
[40:40] is his word right or not did he promise
[40:43] that he would be with us did he promise
[40:45] that he would Deliver Us from all our
[40:49] afflictions amen he did amen the fact
[40:53] that you and me are still living and
[40:54] still sucking air that means God's not
[40:57] done with us
[40:58] [Laughter]
[41:00] yet
[41:02] right no matter what we're going
[41:04] through God is not through with you
[41:09] yet
[41:11] let's let's not put our our our our our
[41:15] children or our our case as a lost cause
[41:20] it's
[41:21] not it's not they're still here with us
[41:24] that means there's amen God's going to
[41:26] do that it's going to be even a greater
[41:29] Miracle
[41:31] hallelujah amen I can't I can't do it
[41:33] Lord but I know you
[41:36] can and I'm waiting for that moment amen
[41:39] praise the Lord
[41:42] amen going back to to to Lazarus amen
[41:46] Jesus said unto her I am the
[41:47] resurrection and the life he that
[41:49] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[41:52] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[41:54] believeth in me shall never die believe
[41:56] thou this she said unto him yay Lord I
[41:59] believe that thou art the Christ the son
[42:01] of God which should come into the world
[42:04] Amen and then if we keep keep reading
[42:06] down and I just I just got amazed at
[42:08] this you saw how Martha answered
[42:12] Jesus how he said she said I know that
[42:16] that my my my my brother is dead but I
[42:20] know I know that yet God can still
[42:23] answer your prayer she was positive was
[42:26] being positive but when Jesus actually
[42:29] comes and starts doing the the work
[42:32] tells the people to remove the the the
[42:36] stone I think it's down let's see Jesus
[42:38] therefore again groaning himself come to
[42:40] the Grave verse 38 it was a cave and a
[42:43] stone lay upon it Jesus said take you
[42:45] away the
[42:46] stone look who who comes and and and
[42:50] contradicts
[42:52] him Martha was the one who was telling
[42:54] him Lord I believe I know that you can
[42:57] still do it I know that you're powerful
[42:58] I know I know Lord I know that you could
[43:00] do it but when when when God is there
[43:03] doing the
[43:04] thing look what she says Martha the
[43:07] sister of him that Jesus said take you
[43:09] away the stone Martha the sister of him
[43:11] that was dead sath unto him Lord by this
[43:13] time he
[43:15] stinketh now she's bringing in what she
[43:18] sees her her her situation everything
[43:22] Amen in into the picture when she should
[43:24] have just continued he's doing what he
[43:27] said he would
[43:28] do but when we actually see him doing
[43:32] what what we've been asking him to do no
[43:35] Lord it can't be done that way no but
[43:38] that his ways are his perfect ways our
[43:41] ways stink amen his ways don't amen
[43:46] Jesus said take you away the stone Marth
[43:48] said the sister of him that was dead
[43:50] said unto him Lord by this time he
[43:51] stinketh for he hath been dead 4 days
[43:55] and watch what Jesus said said Jesus
[43:56] said unto her said I not said not unto
[43:59] thee that if thou wouldest believe thou
[44:01] should see the glory of God Amen right
[44:04] what a rebuke
[44:09] yeah what a rebuke because she clearly
[44:12] told him I believe that God but when God
[44:15] sometimes amen we ask him Lord do this
[44:19] for me and he's doing it we're like nah
[44:20] Lord I didn't want it done that
[44:23] way nah y man it's just like it's just
[44:27] like the guy I I can't think of any
[44:29] better another example with this I had a
[44:32] friend in Greenville South Carolina he
[44:35] said there was a man right there next to
[44:37] a Burger King asking for food or asking
[44:40] for food and money or whatever you could
[44:43] give him he was right there in the
[44:44] Burger King parking lot the guy my
[44:47] friend comes up to him and says here
[44:48] I'll buy go in here and buy you a
[44:50] hamburger he said no I don't want that
[44:54] it's too greasy
[44:58] but but but he was he was asking for
[45:00] food he he he wanted he wanted uh
[45:02] something else that was right next door
[45:04] I don't know what it what was next
[45:10] door you were asking that's what you
[45:12] were asking for right you wanted food he
[45:14] said well you know you want the
[45:16] hamburger I ain't going to give you
[45:18] money I don't know what ended up
[45:20] happening God's going to do whatever he
[45:23] wants to in the way he wants to he
[45:26] amen because he knows what's better for
[45:31] you now sometimes God answers things the
[45:34] way you know if it's according to his
[45:37] word amen he'll do things as we ask him
[45:40] amen I'm sure that that's happened many
[45:42] times but most of the time amen we don't
[45:45] we don't know how what's best for
[45:48] us and sometimes he has to do things his
[45:51] way
[45:53] amen and sometimes he has to tell us
[45:55] didn't I can I tell you that if you just
[45:57] believe you're going to see the glory of
[46:00] God if you just stand
[46:02] still stand still let me do it my way
[46:06] don't try to do it your
[46:08] way amen praise the Lord
[46:13] Jesus amen let's um let's continue let's
[46:16] go back to Ephesians and I'm going to
[46:18] get ready to close out here in just a
[46:23] moment and let's continue reading there
[46:26] in Ephesians we'll finish out
[46:31] here but God who is rich in Mercy for
[46:34] his great love wherewith he loved us
[46:37] Ephesians 2 verse4 even when we were
[46:40] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[46:43] with
[46:44] Christ amen by Grace you are
[46:48] saved and hath raised us up together and
[46:52] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[46:57] in Christ Jesus
[46:59] amen and if you look at if you look at
[47:01] Joseph's life amen the things that he
[47:04] went
[47:05] through all that he went through amen he
[47:08] was made to sit amen amen in a high
[47:12] place Amen in a high place but he had to
[47:17] go through all that in order to get to
[47:19] that
[47:19] position amen that's what we got to do
[47:22] amen we are raised together with him
[47:24] amen we're sick getting together in
[47:26] Heavenly places with him amen in Christ
[47:29] Jesus it doesn't feel like
[47:32] it sure doesn't feel like it amen we're
[47:35] Walk we're we're we're we're we get up
[47:38] amen we go to work we we go home we we
[47:42] do what we need to do and sometimes it
[47:43] just doesn't feel like we're sitting in
[47:46] Heavenly places in Christ
[47:48] Jesus but his word says
[47:53] so because you the ones that are sit in
[47:56] Heavenly places with him is the is the
[47:57] church is the bride amen it's you praise
[48:02] God he's got a place ready for you amen
[48:05] amen amen and we're not just standing
[48:08] amen we're sitting with him in Heavenly
[48:10] places in Christ Jesus amen not in your
[48:15] own self not in anything else amen in
[48:17] Christ Jesus that's where you can sit in
[48:19] Heavenly
[48:21] places when you are in Christ when you
[48:24] are in in something else or in your own
[48:26] opinions or in your own thoughts you
[48:28] can't be in Heavenly places but when you
[48:30] are in Christ Jesus amen you can be in
[48:32] Heavenly places that in the ages to come
[48:35] he might show the exceeding Riches of
[48:38] his grace and his kindness towards us
[48:42] through Christ Jesus amen thank God for
[48:46] his grace amen Grace Grace Wonderful
[48:50] Grace for by grace are ye saved through
[48:55] faith and that not of
[48:57] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[49:01] Works lest any man should boast in other
[49:04] words there's nothing that you can do to
[49:07] have deserved the grace of God otherwise
[49:10] you would have been able to boast and
[49:12] say I did this to obtain God's mercy and
[49:14] God's grace but Paul is saying there is
[49:18] nothing that you can do so that you
[49:20] don't glorify yourself so that you don't
[49:22] think high too high of yourself and
[49:25] forget about me it is not of Works lest
[49:27] any man should boast but it's of the
[49:29] grace of God Amen for we for we are his
[49:35] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[49:38] good works which God hath before
[49:42] ordained that we should walk in them
[49:46] praise the Lord Jesus amen what a
[49:49] wonderful thing it is that we are his
[49:52] workmanship amen a person who a Potter
[49:56] or or someone that that that does
[49:58] carpentry or or you know amen that's a
[50:02] continual work amen right he just
[50:06] doesn't do one thing at one time just
[50:08] one day I'm going to think of it and
[50:11] then he just does it right there and
[50:12] then sometimes it it most of the time it
[50:15] takes thorough a working process amen it
[50:19] could be years I remember uh uh I think
[50:22] it was last year we we when we went to
[50:24] Ohio uh we were up in Ohio and we
[50:27] visited the the uh Amish country and we
[50:30] went through this little this little uh
[50:32] display there in one of those uh
[50:34] restaurants or one of those stores there
[50:37] they had the these displays these wooden
[50:40] uh works of this this art that this man
[50:43] the local man would would make and it
[50:45] was like 3D looking but it was all made
[50:47] of of wood it was it was beautiful just
[50:50] beautiful things I don't think that took
[50:53] him two hours to
[50:56] do the things that I that I saw I mean
[50:59] he had one that was like one of the most
[51:00] popular one was was the depiction of the
[51:03] crucifixion of Jesus and it was in such
[51:05] detail I mean carving out every single
[51:09] thing and it wasn't just Jesus on the
[51:10] cross it was the it was like Mary and
[51:13] and and the disciples around him and and
[51:16] and and I think even had Roman soldiers
[51:18] around him with the spear it was so
[51:20] detailed can you imagine just carving
[51:22] all those things out I don't think that
[51:25] took him one hour two hours he probably
[51:28] worked on that maybe for for months or
[51:32] or me years I don't know but you know
[51:34] what it became out it came out to be a
[51:37] beautiful
[51:39] display amen we are his
[51:43] workmanship it might take years some of
[51:46] us might take 40 years it took me is
[51:49] took 42 years and if God still has life
[51:54] here in another 42 2 years amen it's
[51:56] going to be 82 years some of us is 80
[51:58] years now 85 years now amen sister ceter
[52:03] she's not here tonight it's taking her
[52:04] it's taken the Lord 96 years I don't
[52:07] think she can say that she is where she
[52:09] would like to be no I think the Lord
[52:12] she's probably saying Lord you're still
[52:14] working on me amen but until until we
[52:18] leave this life amen that's when God
[52:21] says I'm done right brother I'm done
[52:24] amen and I will eventually you're going
[52:27] to be shown Amen to the world amen amen
[52:30] as a full display as a beautiful thing
[52:33] amen amen but it took it took all that
[52:36] time for God to do that work amen
[52:39] whatever it is that God is doing in your
[52:41] life whatever is happening in your life
[52:43] Saints remember but God am that would
[52:48] make the
[52:49] difference say Satan amen you this might
[52:54] be happening in your life life you might
[52:55] allow you might put sickness in my life
[52:58] but God allowed that
[53:00] amen cuz God can't do anything amen or
[53:03] Satan can't do anything to me unless God
[53:07] allows him to do so am amen job was in
[53:10] that position amen we can all say
[53:12] different things amen sister Peggy you

[53:16] testifying amen how brother Dale was
[53:18] sick and and and and you were in a
[53:21] situation in a where you didn't have any

[54:23] difference he's the one that changes
[54:24] every everything was like this before

[55:05] pull up the uh the screen my phone
[55:17] here amen I'm
[55:22] uh uh a brother from hondura this is
[55:25] Mission related but a brother from
[55:26] Honduras he he he contacted me uh a few
[55:31] weeks ago
[55:33] well that's him and his wife that's
[55:35] brother Robert brother Robert Costco and
[55:38] he he's a pastor there in in in in
[55:40] Honduras and uh I've been to his church
[55:43] several times preached there at his
[55:45] church he's a he's a wonderful
[55:47] trustworthy
[55:48] brother um he has his church doesn't
[55:53] have a u sufficient restrooms uh
[55:56] facilities for the people um there at
[55:59] the church as well as uh they have a a
[56:03] kitchen there they actually have to use
[56:06] his house is right next to the church so
[56:09] they actually have to go inside his
[56:10] house cook and and even the study the P
[56:14] the pastor's study or the or the study
[56:16] is in in his house so everything is done
[56:19] in his house so he was he's asking
[56:21] because they're they're going to be
[56:22] holding some meetings later on this year
[56:25] um there at the church and and and and
[56:27] also have uh the yearly ministerial
[56:30] meeting there at his church and he was
[56:33] wanting to to to see if he could get you
[56:35] know an extra you know extra facilities
[56:38] built at his at his place uh right there
[56:41] for the church as well as a little study
[56:44] for for the for a pastor's study and a
[56:47] and and the church's own little kitchen
[56:49] so that they don't have to use his house
[56:51] and and and so this is uh this is his
[56:54] little little house right there next to
[56:56] the church uh the church would be right
[56:59] over
[57:00] here this is part of the church and this
[57:03] is the only little the only bathroom
[57:05] that they have right
[57:06] there and um
[57:10] so see here that's their little kitchen
[57:13] right there makeshift Kitchen in the
[57:15] back that they
[57:16] have so um so they were wanting to see
[57:21] if they could uh upgrade that uh a
[57:24] little bit and then to be able to
[57:26] accommodate the people so he was asking
[57:29] for a certain amount but I'm I'm I'm I'm
[57:31] asking I'm asking if we could if if if
[57:34] the Lord puts it in your heart I told
[57:35] him that that uh that you know we'll see
[57:38] what we can do I don't make any promises
[57:40] to anybody who asks anything but um if
[57:43] we could maybe uh send him
[57:47] $3,000 now if you can't the if you can't
[57:51] that's fine but if you if the Lord puts
[57:53] it in your heart that you know you want
[57:54] to help out with this with a little
[57:56] portion of of of that and then what I'm
[57:59] going to do is the other portion that he
[58:00] had requested I'm going to try to see if
[58:02] we can if I can request it from the camp
[58:05] meetings in at brother Joe greens this
[58:07] this uh this this coming August so um so
[58:11] I wanted to put that out there for him
[58:13] because I told him that I would so you
[58:15] pray about it and if you if you don't if
[58:17] you can't do it
[58:19] then pray that someone would be able to
[58:21] send some give something towards him and
[58:24] uh towards this
[58:26] need so I put that I put that his name
[58:30] is brother Robert brother Robert
[58:34] so you know we find ourselves in
[58:36] situations like this and maybe brother
[58:39] Robert's in that situation but I know
[58:41] God
[58:42] can change things around for him
[58:45] amen I'll tell you a quick testimony
[58:48] about brother Robert brother Robert had
[58:50] a a man in his church last year when we
[58:53] were there
[58:55] uh two years ago when we were there and
[58:57] that man he was threatening the life of
[59:00] of of of brother Robert and his and his
[59:03] his family and his wife he got upset
[59:06] with him and uh he said that brother had
[59:09] just had a spirit on him and was
[59:11] actually physically threatening his life
[59:13] and stuff and uh for about a year and a
[59:16] half brother Robert had everywhere that
[59:18] he would go he'd have to go out with uh
[59:21] with bodyguards from his church Brothers
[59:24] like two or three brothers had to go out
[59:26] with him because this brother and he's
[59:29] he's such a humble man he's such a a
[59:31] Meek man that he did he didn't want to
[59:33] call the law on him he didn't want to he
[59:36] didn't want to that's just that's just
[59:37] the type of person that brother Robert
[59:39] is um so he was asking prayer about that
[59:44] so this this this brother he started
[59:47] going to another church
[59:49] locally and uh the pastor of that church
[59:53] knew what was going on with with the
[59:55] situation there at brother Robert's
[59:56] church between him and brother Robert
[59:59] and uh he told Brother uh he told that
[1:00:02] man he said listen you're not you you're
[1:00:04] welcome to come and and and and and
[1:00:07] fellowship with us here but don't expect
[1:00:09] for you to be be a deacon or for you to
[1:00:12] preach or anything like that he said for
[1:00:15] ones you need to be born
[1:00:17] again and two you need to go make things
[1:00:20] right with brother Robert and his family
[1:00:22] because you you've tortured their life
[1:00:25] or you you you caused them you know
[1:00:27] problems for a year and a half so that
[1:00:32] you know the brother Robert had asked
[1:00:34] prayer you know a year and a half ago
[1:00:35] about that and seems like the the Lord
[1:00:38] is working on this young man's life on
[1:00:40] this man's life so uh he brother Robert
[1:00:44] according to what he told me last time
[1:00:46] he said that the man isn't threatening
[1:00:48] his life anymore so God is doing
[1:00:51] something and brother Robert didn't have
[1:00:53] to put the law on on him didn't have to
[1:00:56] get him to court they didn't have to do
[1:00:57] anything he just let God do the way and
[1:00:59] God's working on working on that
[1:01:01] brother's heart amen because that's the
[1:01:04] reason why he started visiting the other
[1:01:05] church because he wanted to get back in
[1:01:07] church so you just remember that in
[1:01:10] prayer amen but God Amen God can change
[1:01:13] everything around amen turn things
[1:01:15] around amen let's let's have the brother
[1:01:17] musicians
[1:01:20] come amen let's just bow our heads and
[1:01:24] have a word of prayer and uh brother
[1:01:27] brother boy maybe if we can sing the
[1:01:29] brothers can key up a uh uh that song uh

[1:03:12] the rest of the service into your hands
[1:03:14] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I think

[1:03:20] my own testimony
