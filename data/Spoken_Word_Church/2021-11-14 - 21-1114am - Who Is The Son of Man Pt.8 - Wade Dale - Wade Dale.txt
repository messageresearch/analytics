together to worship father we look at the world and his condition lord knowing us that's the evening time lord we rejoice but father said for us to see loved ones and friends god who are lost and we can't lead them but father we pray that we will live and walk the best that we can and do the things that you would desire for us lord and lead us wherever we go and whatever we do father let us present you unto the world through ourselves in jesus christ and we pray amen second timothy the second chapter i exhort therefore that first of all supplications and prayers intercessions and giving thanks to make for amen for this is good and acceptable in the sight of our god for our sake for god our savior for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus wherefore i am ordained a preacher and then the pastor i speak the truth in christ and not in line not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and for rarity in light manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with same face-ness and severity not with braiding of the hair a gold a pearl or costly array let the woman learn in silence with all subjections for adam first from then ever notwithstanding she be saved to childbearing in the continuous of faith charity and holiness with our severity god bless you may be seated amen what an assurance we have to know that there's one god and there's a god that is uh christ jesus the mediator between god and man amen um brother john would you come and take up the offering this morning precious lord jesus we so thank you lord we can

five months ago um and i never i had i went to the very first camp i ever went to was in 2014 and it wasn't a very good experience so but i really wanted to put myself out there because god has been really working on me the last couple months and um you know i went through a lot two years ago and that kind of closed my heart to the things of god and so the last six months or so i couldn't figure out why i was so sensitive to you know the word and preaching and it's like every time i would really listen i would let's just cry and i couldn't figure out why but um you know i kind of was just trying to be open to it and accepting it and just letting god work for the first time in my life that strong so during the camp i knew like something was going to had to happen and so that first night i was so emotional and i was like you know god i'm not gonna leave this camp the same i knew it but um the saturday night something was just the atmosphere when we walked in was just different and so i knew like i was so determined because i knew i needed the holy ghost i was so determined that i told my i told god i'm not leaving this service without it and so uh like they had a prayer line and i knew i wanted to be that like within the first three people in that prayer line but um you know i i sat there for about an hour just praying and feeling exhausted and by the end of it i knew i had it so i just wanted to give that to that testimony of that falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus was the best thing i've ever ever done [Music]

food at the end of it so good to have them though from ohio it's it's a it's a refreshing pleasure i've told y'all many times before sometimes you know brother keith reed told us many many years ago he said brother wade brother sam he said you're sometimes not preaching to the people in this building but praise god that we've got a a group of people i mean that used to be our cry room back there where they're at you know that was the nursery we didn't have a thing called the internet we didn't have a thing called uh the cameras and the online streaming and then god sent us a group of holy ghost-filled people to get the word out to our brothers in different places in the world in the country so it's all the glory goes to god but you don't know you know many times we don't know who we're touching even out in the regular world but one day god will tell you that that person made it because of you that testimony you had that life you lived that one moment that you shook their hand and said god bless you we're praying for you you'll know that when we get on the other side and we'll be able to really rejoice and then not think we are all so insignificant because all of us if you got the holy ghost today you're not insignificant you're god almighty and human flesh amen and also we have a visitor brother dakota in the back uh i'm not going to tell you why he's here but uh good to have him with us olivia's back there somewhere so good to have him with us make yourself at home as dad always says you're you're a visitor one time when you come back you're not a visitor anymore so uh and also i want you to remember i gained a daughter-in-law friday you know josh got married well she fell at the wedding and and bummed her knee up real bad and had to the emergency room and she's

anything you ought to be saying i i tell you it's so wonderful you look at brother branham he preached one of the most powerful sermons on 11 25 1965 thanksgiving day he preached the invisible union what a thanksgiving message that he told those people that was an invisible union with the bride in christ what a greater time and a greater thing to be thankful for so let's bow our heads we're going to be speaking again here on this who is the son of man that would be part nine not part a part nine all right let's bow our heads remember everybody in prayer and all the traveling that we're everybody's going to do let's just remember we have traveling mercies to heavenly father we thank you lord for the day you give us and this time that you give us lord we know that time's going to run out soon and lord we're going to slip right into eternity but we're going to remember these days lord i believe the wonderful times we had in the atmosphere that we came under lord of the anointing of the holy spirit and the kindred spirit that each one of us brought today lord we'll remember these times and we'll talk about oh how wonderful like the ones that from emmaus but the only good thing about now the ones from emmaus were talking to you lord walking down a road but now lord you're here inside of each one of us talking to us all the time all the way through our walk of life lord i thank you for that and i pray that you would be with each one this here lord the ones that are not here be with the ones that have to travel this holiday season be with the ones from ohio lord as they continue on wherever they are going pray that you'll give them traveling mercies lord just be with us lord for just a moment you'll be the active participant in this service you take over and you lead and guide us by your holy spirit lord you do the revealing and you do the speaking in the name of jesus christ we pray amen who is this son of man john 1 1 we're going to get to something a little bit in the book of luke and something i want to really really touch on in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not that was a man sent from god whose name was john there had to be a messenger bring a message or we wouldn't understood who this person was amen there had to be somebody in the end time bring a message to help us understand this one that came amen that christ is here the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light amen he wasn't the light but he bore witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not made the world and made the people standing in the world and they didn't know who he was he came unto his own he actually then he said i am he and they didn't believe that either they're not going to believe you either amen but as many as received him ask me in you but as many as received him amen because we had to receive him wasn't born special born in sin shaping iniquity dying we received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god so it has nothing to do with your natural birth and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated now i want you to look that word full because remember he was the fullness of the godhead bodily there was no part of him that was not god show me one there wasn't a part of him even his flesh that was rotting or deteriorating or dying that body came from god that body was god amen but it was born in a way that you and i can see that he was born a man a human mortal so he could taste death for me and you he couldn't taste death as the son of god he couldn't taste death as the great elohim or or all the great titles excuse me they gave him in the old testament he had to come as man a baby see even adam as great as adam was adam was called the son of god that's fine because he had the he had the holy ghost in his soul amen but his body's what died amen his spirit realm is where he fell he didn't he didn't fall in his soul he fell in his spirit realm because listen if you're born again you can't fall in your soul impossible for god to fall because that's who it is it's that by the transforming power of god god's in there now that's what i hope we understand is we we've already got what people are looking for hello somebody we've already got what people are looking for and we're not using it we've got it so wrapped up inside of our memories and conscious affection imagination and our flesh and all these different things we got to let it go we got we got us but we got to start somewhere you can't just say well i got it all when i believe you got everything you needed to believe more but you didn't get all you got everything you needed to believe more hey man i was listening to a denominational preacher and actually got some out of his sermon but he was talking on the statue of a perfect man and he made this statement and i thought man how profound he said he's talking about fruits of the spirit everybody talks about fruits to the spirit right where does that fruit come from he said the fruit is in the root think about it it didn't just pop up on the end of a the bud didn't just pop up on the end of the of the stick that goes out there you know because god says i'm the vine where's the vine the vine's what's plugged into the ground i am the vine you are the branches so we start at the bottom of the statue of perfect man the root and whatever that root is that's what we're going to be so that fruit comes from the power of the root all that energy comes from the root you say no it comes from photosynthesis it comes from the leaf well that leaf has to talk to the root and the root has to say i'm going to release the energy to go up to that plant so that's a good thing sometimes you might all listen to a denominational preacher you might get something but the fruit's in the roots that's the same way the fruit where do these fruits of the spirit come from the root cause is because this son of man came on earth and showed us how to live them amen unless he dies see he said unless a grain of wheat die and go into the ground well now what's the first thing it starts growing what attaches that seed to the ground a root the root comes out and that's where the power comes from is when that root starts absorbing the 16 elements the dirt and then what produces itself amen so i thought that was pretty good but that but god had to provide a body let's go to hebrews 10 verse 1. we've read this before let's read this again but for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comer there unto perfect in other words there was no root jesus christ was the root your holy ghost that's where everything comes from that wasn't in the old testament there was no holy ghost in the old testament there was an anointing they got an anointing and that's why that they couldn't fulfill the fruits of the spirit that's why they couldn't fulfill all the word of god like you and i can you know it's great for to see the the two guys that uh that walked in the road to them on the road to emmaus and jesus just absolutely told them he was telling them he went through all the scriptures and but he wasn't in them he was a man talking to him and he said oh did our hearts burn within us well then that man is in your heart today it ought to burn more than that it ought to burn your whole being if it burned in their hearts that a person was telling them what the old testament was and who he was that one person is now inside of you that's why i said the first of the year you need to let out what you got inside i don't care whether it's good or bad if i got something bad in me i want it out let it out but i do want what's good inside of me to be let out also so the world can see who we are amen we can say message believers all we want to we have a holy ghost on our spirit every day of our life and die and go to hell you can say brother byron said it a million times because you know what that's what's going to happen when they come up to him in the end time and they say have i not preached the message of the hour have i not cast out devils in your name he said depart from me i never knew you in other words you never you never got me inside your soul you thought you did you got a good anointing that some preacher told you you were okay we're not okay we're getting okay but we got the one that's okay inside of us if we got that residing inside of us then we can make it [Applause] but not in the old testament it couldn't make them perfect there was nothing there was nothing to there was no power to make man stop doing what they were doing all right for then would they not have ceased to been offered in other words one sacrifice and done because that the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscious of sins now do we have conscious of sins you say yes but you should say no because your soul can't sin if you're born again there's no conscience of sin and if you if you sin brother brown said you send a sin you're going to read pitfall where are you standing from you remember reason conscious affects your imagination your human nature it's where you're doing that from but listen and that guy's inside of you going don't do that don't do that hello don't do that don't do that and if you do do it though who's the one that get that condemns you that one that's inside he's the he's when it condemns you and then you're different from the world because we used to do the things we used to do and we it didn't bother us there was nothing inside except him and he said that's okay right but now that you've got the holy ghost inside of you what's he saying you need to repent you need to repent the devil never while i was out in the world for 20 years the devil never come to me and said you need to repent did he did your devil do the same thing maybe your devil's different than mine maybe you got a different they got one different ohio no same devil okay all right i just want to make sure it wasn't just a georgia thing because remember the devil went down to georgia and um where'd that come from what that's in this fire some other spiral book it ain't this one but look look it's not the bible telling us though that if the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscious of sins paul's telling us they did have a conscience of sin because there was nothing to perfect them but now that perfection has some has the son of man come died left us the statue of a perfect man left us the fruits of the spirit left us a way to walk like he walked had a guy um friday at the wedding they were um they were all there both of them are greeks because lia is a greek and most of them are greek orthodox and i want to know the difference between greek orthodox and roman catholic church because they're close but they're they're totally separate but he kept reverting back to that same thing he said also we can't help it because i told him he said well what do y'all believe i said well i said we teach what's in the bible you know folks and this is way off my subject but we're going to stay on this for a minute you know i was thinking the other day you we're the only people that can take the bible of god now everybody's preaching it today but we can take this word of god and hand it to somebody and say show me where i'm not doing what's in the bible right show me amen we believe in one god we don't believe in eternal hell it's not even in the bible so what am i telling what i told that guy said you build a lot of your religion on tradition and he agreed because that's what the roman catholic church they a lot of theirs is tradition you can't get it out of the bible that that mary was the mother of god and and the even that she was she you know the roman catholics teach that she was immaculately conceived also in other words she was conceived from a virgin which made her a virgin and then god and then i'm like no i ain't buying that i said where'd that come out of the bible and my bible says mary went to the upper room why did she go the upper room if she was god she needed god she bore the seed but she wasn't deceived amen amen so i asked him and he kept saying well we're not perfect well we're not perfect i said that's not what this bible tells me your traditions tell you you can't be perfect your tradition now what did you know i never said this but i thought man didn't jesus stand one day and tell the very religious people of the world that he came to he said your traditions is what's killing you you've made a non-effect by your traditions he was telling them he said you've took the old testament and made it of none of faith because of your tradition so he said so you believe what's in the bible i said look i said whatever we preach we have it in the bible it's not in the catechism it's not enough and he was talking about how they recite the apostles creed and all that i said that's not even in the bible i said let's if we stay with the bible we got to be somewhere close to being perfect all right you can stay out there with your tradition which tells you you can't be perfect but right here he said because that the worshiper once purged now when you receive the new birth does that mean you have been once purged you don't get you don't get the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul as the new birth and then you got to have it again and you lose it tomorrow no one and done amen because you're sealed you're sealed the book is sealed everything's sealed inside of you but if the worshiper wants purge should have no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year so because you've got to take the lamb because you've got to meet the high priest because you got to put the thing on there and they got to kill it and the blood goes everywhere and you say okay i'm fine but when the person turns and walks back out he's going to send the same sin again now folks if we keep sending the same sin again you need the new birth you don't just need to go up the statue a perfect man you need to get you need to get some power in your root you need to get the root inside of you that's the seed i like plant that seed and give it some root amen but what is the seed the word of god really simple really simple but in those sacrifices there's remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins it's not possible there's no way it's a substitute it helped until christ got here it helped until the son of man walked on earth amen but i'm telling you you can't get your sins forgiven without jesus christ never there's nobody powerful enough to do that you know i'm going to i'm going to read you next a couple of sundays from now jesus kept telling them he said i want you to know i want you to know several times in the in the gospels that the son of man is here and can forgive sins and that's why they hated him because here's these priests high priest they're under bulls and goats and they keep doing the same thing everybody else does and this man walks up and he says who can convince me of sin convince me who can convince me of sin i don't do the things you do i don't go by tradition i live by the word of god and then the people are like well you know you're you're a man making yourself god no god made yourself a man now what's the difference in you i know there's a difference in you and in god we were born in sin we have a sinful nature which is our memory reason conscious effects and imagination now jesus did not because he knew no sin he didn't have a carnal mind he couldn't look back and say i know what my mom and daddy did to get me here see that makes the ball rolling right there because you do you do we do the same thing well i do this because my daddy don't you blame your daddy brother license but nobody bless you brother you didn't make these two the way they are they did it theirself he's going to go sure boy but it's not possible that the blood of bulls and ghosts take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world listen he didn't build a soul he didn't build a soul he always was a soul amen the theophany of god but he had to build a body he had to build a 16 element body so he could be our brother so we could look at him and he could look at us and he said unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins well listen you know what they didn't believe who he was so they died in their sins because that's what he told them he said don't you he said i i've come to this earth to forgive your sins and you're turning me down in other words he knew that he was going to kill him somewhere eventually down the road they were going to kill him he's going to have to die for him but a body has to help prepared me a body a flesh body that's what connects the son of man with this whole thing the whole human race is that he came in human flesh and he was born virgin born though but he was born but watch what he did let's read this real quick number one in the masterpiece then come finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets in other words he stepped out on their prophecy didn't miss it by one scripture actually didn't miss it by one word you know if he would have come one word off he couldn't have been our savior he didn't miss it by one word now you say we don't say but you say well we can't be perfected why can't we be perfected when you've got the one that is perfect inside of you we're just not letting that thing out and using it that's the whole problem why because our carnal mind says we can't or i did or i must have that's tradition that's not what the bible says that's a tradition somebody has taught you and it's wrong it's wrong anything outside the word of god is wrong and sure the bible does say you were born and sin shaped and iniquity but i can read you thousands of others that says you're perfect sinless brother brown i'm invisible union he said a sinless bride is going to be presented to god not over yonder right here right here because look the union's not over yonder if you don't get married here you're not gonna get married over there the union happens on earth while you're in human flesh and i know we beat the human flesh a lot we do but and and it is it is it is our problem it's the the spirit and the flesh part but god knew what it would take to get us back and he used human flesh why didn't he just send an angel why didn't he just say all right brother dardy you're going to be an angel and you're not going to have no sin well guess what i believe god created those angels and i believe some of them sinned did they not they believed the devil's lie and now they're his subjects so that ain't gonna protect you even if you come here an angel you still got a choice to make satan made a choice you know what god made a choice too god could have stood up in the in the heavens with his arms folded and said i don't need any of you to exist and he would be telling the truth he doesn't even need air he just doesn't need us but he wants us because we came from here everything came from the what the root amen i am the vine you are the branches but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene when this head piece was put on it we find in him the entire work of god we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now look now again god has the perfect masterpiece again who's he talking about in the masterpiece he's not talking about only jesus christ he's talking about his bride the body that's been prepared for jesus which is not the physical body it's me and you you know why because he chose it that's his choice to be a savior redeemer healer that's his choice he made a choice isaiah 7 13 says behold the virgin shall conceive and bear son shall call his name emmanuel that's how he got here isaiah 9 6 unto us a child is born unto us the son is given tells the government shall be on his shoulder and all these different things all these great like the like the song was talking about crowns i was thinking about that when we were singing that psalm how great is our god we're really not going to know until we get there the fullness we're just going to get enough to get us out of here and then we've got an eternity to learn about this god that we're talking a little bit about today and a little bit about tomorrow and a little bit about when you talk to him you're going just enough to know the the magnitude of what he's going to do for us the bible says i has not seen ear has not heard or entered in the heart of man we can't we can't comprehend because you know what we're all thinking now well i got to go to work tomorrow well i got to do this tomorrow i got to pay bills tomorrow i got to do this but what about a day when that's not going to happen anymore but you know what if you don't get prepared now you're not going to meet that you're going to meet torment that you're not going to be ever able to get relief from that think about it young people i'm not trying to scare you but i'm telling you if you don't know god it's horrible horrible but i know listen when i was at lewis when we was out in the world we didn't think about god every day no so we had to come to a time i'm telling you we all had to come to a time to where god said okay that's enough you got to make a choice today but listen don't miss that choice don't miss that day don't miss that visitation of god coming to you and say hey let me in amen because i want to be in your flesh i came in flesh so i could be in your flesh the only person that can do that isaiah 53 said he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation as we were talking about before he could have been a he could have he was a human mortal man he could have had he could have had a progeny he could have had a line of children but he knew that's what was killed he knew they were they would die they would die because everybody was born a man is full of days or in other words they're dead but he's told nicodemus he said now you've got to be born from above he said if we can get you born from above he said i can give you eternal life and said we can just continue on and on that's what he's saying here he was cut off of the land of the living but the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no violence yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he has put him to grief look when thou shalt make his soul his soul an offering for sin like i said before and don't get me wrong but you have to pull jesus apart and see what the body did for us the spirit did for us and the soul did for us because the soul the body of listen the body of jesus can't come back inside of you it was a perpetuation though according to the old testament it was the sacrifice the flesh sacrifice everybody with me it was the flesh sacrifice behold the lamb of god what's a lamb a lamb and flesh flesh had to be given every sacrifice except for the meat offering in certain ones was flesh amen because they fell in flesh in the garden of eden so now we got to come back in flesh and clean this thing up jesus christ and then he's going to make his soul an offering for sin it was his soul his person is what is before the throne not the body amen his soul he gave his soul a ransom so he what for sin he shall see his seed in other words he shall see his progeny he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the what the travail of his soul again he don't talk about his body the travail of his soul listen he poured out his soul unto death that's what we're talking about right here therefore will i divide him a portion with the grain he shall divide the spoil with a strong because he has poured out his soul unto death you know you look and you see brother brown said one time he said god died and then he said god can't die amen well you can do that you're going to read in between the lines god played the part of death because you can't kill god but jesus died he said that's the same person yes but watch the manifestation when jesus died on the cross that soul came out of jesus which was god amen and it went and preached to the souls in prison we read that last week amen but the body was what was put in the grave and it was d-e-a-d it was dead and if it hadn't been for david saying he'll not leave his soul in hell or suffer his holy one see corruption that body would have corrupted just like lazarus did right because it was a human body but that soul he made an offering with his soul and when that soul came back into that body it quickened his mortal body does that sound like a scripture that we've been talking about it quickened his mortal body and romans 8 says he's going to quicken your body the same way you quicken jesus's body why because it's the same spirit not a second person amen glory not two holy ghosts and the brother was telling me there about the uh catholic churches some they split the holy ghost and it just i said look it's real complicated these traditions are complicated i just read the bible where he said i'll give you the holy ghost well i just believe that i don't it ain't gotta be split up into whatever and make me do this and it don't make me do that and because you know you always go back to what he said ain't nobody perfect well i said that's not what my bible says you say i see you do please please come on if we don't start seeing that we are the sinless bride of jesus christ we'll just continue to stay here start believing don't worry about what you see start believing because it's already been said amen not going to change the bible we just got to start looking at it and saying well that's me devil i like what brother schroeder always said we had an older brother used to come to church here a long long time ago and he said devil if you're gonna look through my eyes and talk to me in my brain he said we're gonna read the bible we going to read the bible devil if you're going to play up here we're going to start reading the bible and he said that old devil just leave him well see the devil can't stand the word of god that's what we'll read here in just a few minutes when jesus went and was tempted the greatest temptation of 40 days and 40 nights jesus by himself the devil quoted him scripture he didn't give him a tradition he quoted in the scripture but he misquoted he actually misrepresented the scripture because he had no revelation all right so let's continue on here just for a few minutes everybody all right it's not even 12 o'clock yet luke 1 verse 30 behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and call the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david he shall reign over the house of jacob forever of his kingdom there shall be no end and then matthew 2 verse 11 we know that the the wise men brought him three gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and why am i bringing this out because look deity they got a revelation there was something different about that child right i mean he was just a two-year-old kid sitting in the lap of the child i like my brother marcus he was almost preaching what we had preached last sunday you know about the two-year-old the baby being two years the baby wasn't a baby it wasn't a baby like this it was sitting in his mother's lap so it was a couple of years old but they brought gold frankincense and myrrh now it was a revelation they had deity brother brown talks about here and god's gift always find their place so now gold in the bible paragraph 52 but fitting it fitting it fits to christ because gold speaks of deity the gold is deity we'll get to it in just a moment frankincense speaks of service and merged death so god deity in service to die and that's what he was the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was now what's the same thing with me and you in our life let's think about this other day because we've got to start seeing that we we take jesus over here and we say well he was and we know there's we weren't virgin born okay but he learned by the things he suffered he was made perfect all these things we read about this god everybody with me everything we read about this god and we say that's just i'm it's unreachable no it's a total example of what you've got to go through because are you not deity if you're born again dedicated unto death unto death now listen there's some going to die but there's deity dedicated unto death they're not going to get all the way to it somebody's going to make a body change somebody is going to see that their god almighty and human flesh call the bride not a second person and they're going to stand up and say death you have no part with me because the one inside of me is greater than the death that you are bringing to me isn't that just real simple brother brown said he'll death will walk crawl up your sleeve and you just now how many of us really believe that you better start you better start it's not just a good thought no that's what i told the the traditions to tr the traditions that they believe in the catholic church and all the other roman that's that's just tradition that's just good thoughts because it's not god it's not it's you know when you can't have a trinity and all these different things and and communion with saints and dead saints and all that stuff you know you can't do that in our i think our sister um back there was come up in the catholic church typically didn't you come up in catholic church yeah some some of the ones here come up in in a little bit of catholicism and and it's uh it's different but it's tradition and it's hard to you know what truthfully if you were a devout catholic it's harder to live a devout catholic life than it is a christian life because you got all the every move you make you got to go to mass you got to go to this you got to do that you got to pray to that saint you got to pray to that saint if you're going to drive somewhere you got to pray today let's just pray to one god and he's my daddy and i feel comfortable talking to him and i don't have to go find a book to find out where he's at but that's but listen billions of people today believe that billions of catholic people believe that they're good people folks but now they're caught up in a bad situation everybody okay just pray for him i like what brother marcus said he said call him brother remember him when he said you call him brother he said you he said don't don't he said they're human beings and i want to take that point we're human beings i'm not talking about that guy i met the other day but look what he's caught up in now listen if he receives that he becomes that and there's nothing i can do about it but see the same way with me and you if we receive what's being preached to us and it's the truth and we become that what are we we're the manifestation of what this bible said amen we're not a tradition we're not a second person we don't need another something to come man think of how privileged we are everything we need has already come here totally available you can actually now put 1100 sermons in in that bottle cap if you had the right kind of little thing to put it in like the chip right right and that right there all 1100 sermons that used to be i didn't tell the brothers but this whole back wall right here when we first had the church this whole wall there was no door there whole wall was shells because this used to be a store building all the shelves had the sermons of the eight inch reel stacked one on top of each other from from bottom to top and people could check them out it was a library but it covered that whole wall and i don't think that that wasn't the whole that wasn't all 1100 of them was it mom no it was about maybe 800 something like that we didn't even have the whole volume and now you got it right here if you had to i mean if you listened to four sermons you had to get a box to put the tapes in and then the tape player was this big because the 8 inch reel that would be 16 inches and it'd be this big and it only came up later on that they had batteries where you could carry it somewhere else you'd have to plug it in and i've seen daddy take and get the the um the belts were rubber and they start wearing out and they start slipping and the tape would get real and daddy would yeah i see sister tabitha i'm funny here too daddy would take a pencil and stick it inside that thing and start turning it to get it caught back up amen that's what we did to hear the message and now we got it on this right here and we don't listen we don't think we got everything we need when we got it right here we put it in our pocket we put a little our little um ipods on that don't have any connection you know they're right here you know wireless communication now and we have problems with them come on people that's right let's not just grow up let's just get oh let's just grow in god more right and man not just grow up and say well quit doing that no let's grow up in god let god do the work for us amen because he did grow up listen let's keep let's continue on um okay let's get number four let's go to number five uh brothers in the back jehovah god became man took on our stock crossed himself from god and became man there's your sign he was god and became man not rich man but poor man this is the super sign let's go on down to the red when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on that first crib first christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went out of his voice that was god crying you say that's impossible only god can do it only god can do that so we know that's god because only god can do that then he sent us a prophet to tell us exactly what he was so let's go to revelations 3 14. we know he grew up we knew we know he grew in grace and knowledge and we'll read that in just a minute you say jesus did yeah he was a human mortal man all right so let's go to revelation 3 14 and to the angel of the church a lot of sins right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now we were talking about this last sunday let's cover it just a little bit more let's read the loudest in church age and then we'll make comments on it the 14th verse to the y'all stuck maybe they need to there we go okay the 14th verse to the third chapter of revelations unto the angel of the lord angel of laodicea write these things which saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god how odd would that sound the beginning of the creation of god oh my we got all if we had all night on that right now how the lord would reveal that to us watch the amen is the last he appears all the way down through the different things but here in the last church age why isn't he saying the first church age it was god the son of god in the church ages but he wasn't the fullness all the word hadn't been opened up yet we're going to look at that in just a minute we're going to see something that jesus did that told us the book was going to close up until he came back all right because it did remember it was closed the book was only open brother brown said revelations 10 7. revelations 5 it was closed revelations 10 it was open something happened in between that now to show that he was the first down at the bottom also as he was he's the beginning of the creation of god oh do you catch it how could god be created if he's a spirit well he couldn't because he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning same way with you you have to separate i see what began from your mama and daddy but remember as brother marcus was talking wednesday night i've never seen the real you that theophany that real you i've never seen i see the manifestation of it but if you're born again that always was it never had a beginning it never will have an end that's right amen but god had to somewhere develop when he was developing his plan and he had to come in human flesh everybody with me he had to come in human flesh he couldn't just be created human flesh though like melchizedek captain of the host right because that couldn't be your boaz boaz had to be a kinsmen in other words lineage jesus became lineage when he became the beginning of the creation of god there's when the lineage began the human lineage began all right with that the spiritual lineage never had a beginning never will have an end and then same thing with you what are we saying i'm a new what creation well brother john you look just the same you did before you got the new birth right but you're a new creation what that new creature that always was now resides in you because you let it in that's your choice but he didn't change this thank god for a prophet on the future home he said god's not going to destroy this earth listen talk to anybody out in the world this world this world so sinful god's going to just destroy it we're going to go live in heaven right we're all going to heaven it's the puffy cloud and it's i don't know what they're talking about i like living right here because i'm part of this and by the transforming power of god as he transforms me he's transformed the earth same power so thank god for a prophet that says oh he's gonna burn it off yes just like he burnt you off because john said i'm going to baptize you with what holy ghost and fire yes sir it's going to take the holy ghost it's going to take the holy ghost in fire to burn that oh you out and then put the new creation in but he had to begin somewhere so he can die for us our near kinsmen had to take our place melchizedek couldn't take our place the captain of the host couldn't take our place jesus was born just like you except for the conception 16 elements of the earth he was tied to his mama by umbilical cord had to eat when he got here had poopy diapers god yeah he decided he was going to be human because you know what then he could walk up and say hey i'm your brother i know what you're going through even the all-knowing god i've always thought the all-knowing god that knows everything every naf that's on the earth and by the sign how much tyler made this great god he decided he decided to understand you all knowing knew what your choice would be before he even got here yet he wanted to talk to you and get down to your level and still be god to me that's the beginning of the creation of god when that develops that we understand that that god yes it's not just a god that stands up in heaven with his arms folded no you ever get him in your heart you'll understand what i'm talking about because you won't if you don't he's just a theory or a thought or or or a ghost or a something that's not tangible but you get him inside of you i'll promise you you'll understand that when he he had to begin like you began but yet he was god but now look you by the new birth what do you become by this new creation you become god in human flesh called the bride amen so see what he done he came to earth and who was somebody read today being a little made a little lower than the angels that was jesus because even an angel couldn't couldn't save you as far as i know an angel can't create we were talking about the other day or yesterday last night you know the angel that came to brother branham said i have come from the presence of god right to bring you this right an angel walks in the room brother bryan said stood there with his arms folded about six foot tall dark complected he explains the whole thing there's no angel i ever seen all the angels we ever sees got the wing thingy and the thing around here and they're all white no no he sent him so that brother adam could understand who was talking to him but remember that angel never gave him a revelation never he never said the angel revealed to me he said the angel told me to look in this scripture the angel told me all these scriptures to put together and then brother branham was the one that had to get to revelation same way with me and you we may not see the guy walk in the room you know but trust me you have an angel sent from god if you're born again and he's with you all the time but he's not going to give you he's not your holy ghost that's right he's a god he's not your holy ghost but he's your guide how many times have you been reading something and you you what we were talking about the other day you read something and and you read it 100 times and all of a sudden it's like somebody wrote a brand new book or they added this chapter in here that you swear you read good grief you swear oh i have a new name now my name is charlie brown their dad because i say good grief all the time good grief charlie brown get it okay anyway so it's funny how people look at you different ways you know so that's all right that's okay with me we all have our little quirks but that but you look at that though what god did for us and then he sent us a guide sure he gave us the holy ghost inside of us but then brother brown said oh you've got an angel and you're reading the bible or you're reading something and and something says read that book again right somebody something says read that scripture again go back over the book of matthew well that may be that angel over there trying to flip the flip the pages for you and you're not wanting to amen but the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest when god lived in him he is god's creation oh my the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body but now remember he didn't just create himself a body from nothing everything god does this has a purpose because remember what was the body built built by the word of god built by even though it came through the womb of a woman even though it came human flesh and he had to eat and he did all the different things that humans had to do god built that body now see that's the difference in me and you are me and you and him your mom and daddy basically formed your body right god formed his body i'm going to tell you something though that body went through stuff that you'll never go through just for you so that you don't have to go through it so he came down and lived in it it's the beginning of the creation of god oh isn't he wonderful he created himself a body oh isn't he wonderful unless luke 2 verse 39 continue on and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him as parents were in jerusalem every year the feast of passover when he was 12 years old they went to jerusalem after the custom of the feast when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they suppose him to be with the rest of the company in the crowd when a day's journey and they started him among their kinfolks and acquaintances and when they found him not they turned back into jerusalem seeking him and he came to pass that after three days always three after three days they found him where in the temple he wasn't building he didn't find him another carpenter shop and start working in it no he started doing his father's work sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said son why is thou dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought these sorrowing we know what brother brown said about that she denied the virgin birth well she didn't have the holy ghost you know how long ago and he said unto them how is it that you sought me i wish not that i must be about my father's business that's the same way with you and i we should be about the father's business and they understood not what a misunderstood guy they understood not the sayings which he spake unto them now here's mary like i said last night here's mary that knows for a fact she didn't have no relations with a man and this baby comes out it had to come from god and she can't understand verse 50 they understood not the sayings which you spoke unto them to me it's a little they just were deceived and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and look here we go again and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favor with god in men amen hebrews 5 verse 8 a few minutes after 12 we're doing good though he were a son okay look though he were a son you though you were a son a child of god not a son of samuel peggy dale this is this is heading towards what we're going to talk about adoption because remember adoption is not your new birth you knew birth is what makes you the son puts you in the family have i got that we've been taught well we know that but then yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect not in his soul in his humanity and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of god and high priest after the order not being melchized but after the order of melchizedek because jesus truly was a high priest he was he fulfilled every bit of it all right now matthew 3 verse 1. we talked about john the baptist and john the baptist we know he said repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is a hand and it's kind of interesting i was thinking about this the other day here john is preaching a message that he's never going to attain to think about it think about it because the least in the kingdom is greater than john john wasn't in the kingdom but he said repent for the kingdom of heaven is the hand the only thing he was then though there was his responsibility was to introduce the one that had the kingdom in him that was his job you see how a prophet has to stand you see how even brother branham was he was wanting so much on the seals and a different one he wanted people to see it he wanted people to enter into what he was preaching and then it finally got revealed to him this ain't the group that's going to get it wow see most of us would have just i'd have quit and went up in the mountains and you've never seen me again right but he just kept right on preaching get right on he knew there was something coming he john knew there was one coming john knew that one day because remember he hadn't met jesus yet but now he's going to meet him and the first thing john's going to say is behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world matthew 3 verse 11 i indeed baptize you with water and to repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat in the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan under john to be baptized but john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh out of me jesus answered the sin unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness in other words then he baptized him what the prophet did god tell us he had to be washed the sacrifice had to be washed and jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water although the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god who saw john saw because he was going to be a witness and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting on him and lower voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased now did not tell us the other day that's the same thing god when you receive the baptism and holy ghost when you receive the new birth sister lily man god is pleased to dwell in you now because god's only going to give the holy ghost to those that will keep it cherish it and develop it right he's not going to give you the holy ghost and then no a year from now not you know a year from now you're going to just leave no you never got the holy ghost to begin with because remember he's not going to give it to you take it away from you and he's going to give it to you because he sees that you're worthy you might not have been worthy 20 minutes before that because remember the unclean spirit goes out god's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel how many of these things are we and that's what gets me with all these people thinks we came here with this some great something in us no i was lost the things i did in the world god was not somehow his eyes was barred from it or i'd be dead yours too hello yours too but i'd be completely dead physically if the things i did god could see but he wasn't looking at that right god was looking at promise he was looking at a promise that one day you're going to be worthy i know you're going to be worthy because you chose me and i saw it before the foundation of the world so by foreknowledge i gave you something not at your birth there was something right here with you the whole time oh and sometimes we didn't listen to that right sometimes we didn't but he was right here he's wanting to give you the new birth more than you ever wanted more than you ever wanted because he's right here he's wanting to give it to you so bad yeah and what what stops us i me i mean me me and his other brother me and the other brother i because that what's stopping god if he wants to give it to you more than you want it who's stopping him you but you have to wait to get to a place now listen jesus had to wait to get to a place yes he did if he was the if he was going to be the priest to begin his ministry because i didn't i don't have it but it's in luke where the bible tells us that jesus becoming 30 he was almost 30 years old you know priests cannot do anything in a in a temple unless he's 30 years old or becoming 30 years old okay so he couldn't at 13 years old go and be baptized he had to wait till 29. why are you saying this well some of you have been waiting around for waiting to quit waiting around but there's a time that you're going to meet god you're either going to say i want you more than life itself i'm done look i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and he's going to give you the desire of your heart that's what he did that night maybe your desire wasn't that six months ago i'm just speaking to you and me because you're fresh that's great good testimony wonderful keeper oh i'm sorry i should have cut my microphone off listen folks if whatever you do marriage or whatever you got to do is hard enough just as human beings but get the holy ghost get the new birth it sure will help you fight nicer if there's such a thing maybe i'll ask sister tabitha i'm not gonna talk to you right maybe fighting nice is okay but i mean really that's what jesus he came to the river jordan and remember what i read you the other day even the scripture says now john i think i got it there we'll read it again john it's not just the one you see the spirit drop on and then leave because remember he doesn't give you the new birth and then leave but now he will give you an anointing you can get that good sanctified feeling and all that unclean stuff's gone out of you and you think well i got it now you better get something cause the devil's coming right back and the bible says he's coming back to his house he's coming back to his house and he's gonna enter back in because you didn't get something sealed and he's going to make you just so religious you're going to love the lord you're going to love brother branham you're going to love brother dale come on but you're not going to have agape love for god you'll have filial love for god and you know what filial love is temporary it's a temporary love you said no it's just so much well but somebody somewhere you sister lily whoever's in this building when you're sealed in god puts a stamp on you he said i am pleased at this point in your life to dwell inside of you you are now my family members i knew you were going to you just didn't i knew you were going to a little voice from heaven saying you say well i've never heard a voice sister lily did you ever you hear a voice no but you heard god talking to you though come on folks if you ever the devil's not going to tell you to get the holy ghost that is something he is he there's no way because it's totally against all of him he can't say oh you need to get the new birth no that's god telling you that no the devil's going to say you're fine don't worry don't worry you're good you had that little feeling didn't you yeah i had a little feeling well you can get a little feeling from other things but when it turns you to the word of god because look what's the first thing jesus did jesus went to the wilderness and he fought the devil don't you think that's what me and you're going to do listen to this john 1 verse 29 the next day john sees jesus coming to him and said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is the he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear records say i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dub and then a boat on him look and i knew him not said that twice and i knew him not but he that sent me now who sent him the same one that was in jesus but he was in another form right the holy ghost was talking to john but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on her man you the same as he was baptized with the holy ghost you say oh that's too close no it's not close enough yet it is not we are not getting close enough yet so let's look in the future home real quick we'll be done just a few minutes the prophet of god said here comes god down upon his earthly tabernacle jesus in the descending out of heaven jesus was baptized and went straightway a watch when he met the prophet the word comes to the prophet and he was the word and the prophet was standing there denying all their denominations and everything and when he seen the word the word came right to him see that you say we were talking about the other day about getting the new birth in the sunday school bible study class when you see the word the word comes right to you see when you when you you make up you made a statement up here sister lily you made a statement we all heard it didn't we so did every demon in hell here and the head demon himself heard it you say he's in church he gets here for you too and leaves after you leave or maybe some of you leaves with you so when he seen the word the word came right to him how you got hey you know you got the new birth because what's inside of you will come right to the word of god it will not go to anything else it will go to the word of god not a catechism not a apostle's creed not a tradition it will come to the word the word will come to the word and the prophet was so shocked he said i need to be baptized of thee why cometh thou to me he said suffer to be so for thus it becometh us we know the message to fulfill all righteousness i am the sacrifice it must be washed so he washed him or suffered him then he went up out of the water i saw heaven open the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open now watch and i was talking about this last sunday and here comes descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying hold on a man brother brown you're misquoting the word because that's not what he said in the bible because i just read you what it said in the bible a form descending like a dove said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell that's all it said but watch a prophet he knew it had to deal with that flesh this was the son of man fixing to start the son of man message and here he come descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed and out of this oh you're getting you're getting too far off brother from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest of it how do you think redemption comes when jesus is not here comes to you the bride the bride you're going to extend eternal life part of redemption so much a part of redemption you are to the world we're redemption amen come on i'm not getting any man out of that we are redemption to this earth how they gonna get it hey there's millions going to get redeemed by you or you or anybody else a cup of water in my name changed my tire on the side of the road open the door for you so who's that coming from we know that's coming from god but whereas yet he's inside but he's coming working through you [Music] that's why that brother branham says the seed life has to come through the body somebody with the seed not that was born with it because remember even paul that's my whole point you take the apostle paul great apostle right wrote 80 of the new testament yeah got it the man got knocked off his horse one day got smoked blind one day wait a minute great man he was going to kill christians actually great man he had to go and wait for three days in a house and god goes and speaks to the seed life that was in the nice why didn't he just say paul you always was open your eyes blind dummy no somebody had to bring him the seed a nice go talk to this guy he's like he'll kill me jesus said all i mean well god said oh oh and nice you're going to find him pretty humble right now he's probably sore from getting knocked off the horse and oh i kind of blinded him a little bit so he wouldn't run off and i put him in a room i want you to go lay hands on him so he can get the holy ghost right here don't tell me that you don't have a connection with redemption why did he say i'm nice you got to go pray for paul to get the holy ghost scales came off his eyes and then god started working with him i mean why didn't he just knock paul off the listen paul was laying on the ground saying lord he knew it was god laying out there in the desert and you know his horse probably on top of him why didn't he just say oh i'm in the message now i'll just start writing the bible you see how god works right i'll just start writing the bible give me some paper i'm going to antioch i'm going to no he was blind for three days when that night's prayed for him the other thing we hear is is paul had to go back to the back side of the desert to listen to some tapes and read some books and listen to a five-fold ministry but when he comes out he meets peter and having the same holy ghost they're preaching the same message what's the problem with us in the message why can't we preach the same message i will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest what are you you're his word made manifest and the whole world i spoke it into existence by my word now why'd he speak it into existence for me and you and satan has held its law this time but i've come to redeem it so much of it was made his body and i'm coming to dwell in it let's go to luke four we got two more points and then we'll be done jesus being full of the holy ghost wow he's ready for his ministry now because there's a part that's being quickened in his life listen jesus didn't need the holy ghost okay like me and you need the holy ghost everybody got that okay just want to explain that jesus didn't walk as some people said in the message that he walked 30 years without the holy ghost no he was born emmanuel god with us and that income encompasses every title he just had to get to a certain age to fulfill that title had to get to a certain age to fulfill that title had to get a certain age and do a certain thing to fulfill this title everybody good with that and man he like said he just didn't wake up and the best of him and go i'm the redeemer no he was going ah i need some milk right because he hadn't come to his position well that was god i just read you the quote crying in a manger that was god but now he's come to a position he's come to the 30 years of age he's come to a place to where god can now use that flesh to do something and being 40 days tempted to the devil in those days he did eat nothing now don't tell me that wasn't god 40 days he didn't eat nothing and in the south nothing means nothing okay nothing or we say nothing they don't mean nothing and people from ohio they're different they're just a little bit different they put all them little vowels in that we don't yeah i don't put them on we don't we don't even play with them vowels we just shove everything together yet being 40 days tempted the devil in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that he that it be made bread now remember jesus brother brown tells us that jesus had three pulls in his journey we talked about the third pull three pulls first pull second pull third pull right well let's look at this this is three times that the devil's going to talk to him and he's going to say it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god okay look it says it is written look in your bible it says it is written all right watch and the devil taking him up into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil sent to him all this power will i give thee and the glory sounds pretty good doesn't it for that is delivered unto me and to whatsoever i will give the you in other words if thou will worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve now in brother brown's first pull and second pull it was the healing campaign right and the hand then the speaking right or the the discernment but now watch this brother richard douglas preached this several years ago here and and i brought this to his attention so he's preaching a little bit different now and he brought him to jerusalem and sent him on the pinnacle of the temple listen satan didn't have a problem going to church he took him to jerusalem and put him on the temple and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus had had enough he was fishing to administer the third pole he didn't say it is written he said i'm talking to you see he was quoting the bible it is written it is written it is written but when he come to that third poll he said it is said talking to you now thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all this temptation he departed him for a season it is written it is written it is sad he said i've had enough he said i'm administering the third pull on you i'm not saying this in the third person or second person i'm telling you what was brother brown's third pull speaking squirrels he didn't say don't don't don't don't no no he said you say where you want them to be well bro well well god you say he said walk out on that limb stop right there i'll shoot that one walk out on that limb i'll shoot that one creative power by the third pool and they hear was god saying all right satan it's sad i've had enough when are we going to do the same thing see we can say it is written we can say it is written in the future home page 24. hello somebody but when are we going to say satan i say unto you you leave my kids alone you leave my family alone you leave this alone and that alone sure it's great to be under the pools where it is written that's okay quote him the word but you know what if it's just a quote satan just stand right there just like he did with him first too he was still right there but when but when that voice came out and jesus answered and said i said i've had enough of this thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god leave me alone and guess what he left now he left for a season so be careful he'll leave forever he's going to come back everybody all right with that let's read this and then we'll close right here uh sisters go ahead and get everything ready well i know they're down there watching and if you need to go help we're gonna sing a couple of songs before we um we got a lot of food down there please eat all you want to eat all right let's go to luke 4 verse 1. jesus well i'm sorry let's go to luke 4 16. it continues on when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to church didn't i just and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for the read he wasn't just a bystander he was a participant but watch this this is what i love and there was delivered unto him now remember you and i know about this book we know it's not just a scroll the book we're talking about is the word all right but now there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and this is the way it happens there they didn't have books right because even if you read it in the original greek or hebrew or whatever it is it says scroll they didn't have books like we did until like the 15th 1500s but it was a scroll like we were talking about the seal you know the seal all right they handed it to him closed because he said he opened it he opened the book he looked down in that book and he saw itself by the way what are the seals christ right we know that christ we know it's got all the symbols and all of it is christ but where where where christ out you under somewhere crossed over in the desert somewhere crossed over into this church and that the bible says christ in you that's where you're going to find him out but look when he opened the book he found a place where he was identified amen the spirit of the lord is upon me wow because he has anointed me to preach the gospel he has sent me look how personal he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and recover sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and what'd he do he closed the book he said you're not going to understand me until the end time but when i come back i'm going to come back with an open book and you're going to not see just me you're going to see yourself you're going to see you are going to do these things see listen god's the only one can open the book why didn't they hand him that scroll open he had to fulfill everything that we believe the denominations handed him a closed book priest people that didn't know who he was the people that really never knew who he was why because the book was closed but he opened that book in their presence and told them who he was me me i me to preach the acceptable year of the lord then he closed the book and what give it back to the church ages right give it back to the church ages and he said i can't reveal myself like that to the church ages because i'm the son of man that was the literal son of man standing there with that book in his hand amen just like in revelations 5 that was the son of man standing there with the book in his hand the lamb took the book and this mighty angel that came down from heaven in revelation 10 with the book open it was in his hand the son of man but he closed the book and gave it back to the minister and sit down the eyes of all of them were in the synagogue were fastened upon him and he began to say unto them this day can you say that this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears every time you hear and something's quickened of this open book this day this scripture has been fulfilled the son of man has spoke to you through the word and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth look all this great mighty man standing there they denied his virgin birth is this just joseph's son is not this joseph's son and he said unto them you are surely saying to me this proverb i'm going to read you this and it's kind of comical under this proverb physician heal thyself no a physician heals other people whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country now here's the sort of man talking even brother brown said that same thing because in jeffersonville he was just brother bill they knew he had a good ministry but they didn't know who he was but i tell you of a truth many widows went to israel in the days of elise when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was a lie sent save that one woman you know what he's telling them this wasn't sent to you because after we get finished reading this they almost threw him off of a cliff he said i'm not sent to you i'm sent to a will now remember what the widow woman was he's talking to jews the widow woman was a syrophoenician woman or a from sarah path and she was a gentile elijah was sent to the gentiles he's telling them this has nothing to do with you when the heaven was shut up three years and six months from great family throughout all land but unto none of them was elise sent saving to saratha a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of elias or elijah the prophet and none of them was clean now naaman is what he's a syrian he's not a jew he's telling them exactly i am not in other words whatever this is i just told you it's not for you because the rest of that i didn't put it on there to save time the rest of that is they perceived that he was talking about them and they run him out of the city and put him on a cliff and was going to push him off that's how mad they got you know what they got just a little bit of revelation they didn't know really who he was they'd have said god forgive me and save me but that wasn't the time for that now what about me and you are we fulfilling the scripture let's stand are we fulfilling the scripture say amen [Music] right or wrong right or wrong we're fulfilling the scripture but there could you imagine there stood jesus and they handed him that scroll i believe if i'd have been there i'd have started crying because i said god that's you and you're opening that book just for me i'm not opening it for you the jews you're opening it for me lord a syrophoenician a syrian a a gentile that's just not worthy to have all this but you know what it won't make us mad it makes us glad that god give us an open book that god give us a time to where we can see him in his fullness now listen this is the time of the fullness this is not part truth this is the fullness time to know exactly who this son of man is and we'll get to it a little bit later we're going to talk about the headstone because that was what was rejected was the full headship of the word was what was rejected right jesus took him back to scripture but remember that headstone didn't get wiped away he just came back down here and became the chief cornerstone which is a little bitty pyramid right here and he started building that foundation by the roots because that's where the fruits are amen let's sing a song god bless you love you with the love of the lord enjoy your food we'll pray over the food before we go let's sing a song so they get everything ready visitors go first and then take the young children paul that's not you the young children sorry and people without red shirts on that takes you all the way out okay and then the rest of you get in line but but just um we thank brother dale for letting us do that for having let us being able to do all this and being able to uh to stand here and preach the word of god and all of our brothers too same thing and to have a good place that we can go to that we don't have to uh worry about uh what the weather is outside it's just nice to be comfortable i like to be
