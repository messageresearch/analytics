of them missing and you know there's a little little girl in Atlanta that you know got barked she's like 11 months old or something like that you know you just read you know you just I go down the road brother de you just pray for people because it just it just reaches up just grab the hold of because you know what I believe Brother Dean that I can touch the Throne of God Amen I I believe I because I'm the representative of Jesus Christ not by what I've done but what he's he's done for me and I don't think people you know there's a reason people will call and ask you to pray they believe in your prayers amen yeah because they believe in your prayers because they they can see there's a difference in Us by what God's done for us and y'all just pray for me tonight I've got a lot of things it's kind of jumbled up but the Lord knows what he's doing so I just kind of put things together and uh hopefully we won't take too long T not don't wear you out and had somebody was talking to me about Terence was kidding me tonight so we'll try not to be too long tonight long winded even though I enjoyed brother Tom Ernest when he was here and you know brother BR did talk about 4our sermons and you won't get 4our sermons from me that it just ain't in me the Lord would have you know really do something for for me to preach 4 hours but we're just going to see what the Lord has for us T not you know as brother R always talked about the the dentist that was at one of the meetings one time and said Lord uh fill my mouth with good things and nudge me when I've said enough and you know that's just the way I feel about it so hopefully we just say something to be a blessing tonight and nudge me when I've said enough amen and uh just want to remember Wade and brother Dale and brother Donnie and Zach and and uh in La you know I've heard I've heard of three LA's in my lifetime uh one of them is the City of Angels one most I guess everybody knows that one and the other one somebody mentioned was lovely Atlanta and I told him I said I've never been to that part um I said the Great thing about Atlanta is it has roads leading out that's right and I've never I've never been in that part but if y'all know y'all let me know because uh growing up I hated to go through Atlanta I hated anytime the mention of Atlanta because it didn't matter what road was was on if it was 2:00 in the morning 2:00 in the afternoon didn't matter what was going on it was either car wrecks or road construction we always sat in Atlanta we always sat on the interstate there was didn't matter what road you went on you took if you went to 285 85 was clear and you were stuck on 285 if you went 85 285 is clear and you're stuck in traffic it always we never could get through Atlanta on time and it just it was just I just hated Atlanta to go through and then uh brother Dale and them are in lower Alabama so there's the other La that everybody talks about but uh I heard they hadn't hadn't seen her killed anything so we just pray the Lord bless them and maybe they'll get something the next couple of days hope they enjoy theirselves amen and uh they may be listening in so we greet them and if not we'll just I know they'll listen to this later and Wade said that if he didn't like what he heard tonight he could always turn it off so I said well that's no different than people sitting here sometimes people turn you off when you're they're sitting here so you get used to it but no I just I just I love all love you and it's just I wouldn't I wouldn't trade you for anything in the world Amen and yall pray for me I have I've had this told the boys have had it and now they're trying to give it to me and I don't want it but uh before we read the scripture Ephesians chapter 2 uh before we read the scripture now let's just all bow our heads and remember each each need and each request dear heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to be in your house again this evening Lord we're so thankful for what you've made us realizing that it's not what we've done it but it's what you've done for us and father we just pray tonight as we come before you we just pray that you have your will and way in the service tonight you just come speak to each heart and each life father for each request that was mentioned Lord each one each need that's on each heart we just pray that you just come tonight minister in a special way touch each one Lord for the ones that are not here with us this evening whatever the need may be we pray that you just be with them and touch them just uh minister to brother Hal in whatever way it is Lord Jesus we know that you can just come down and do something miraculous but Lord if it's the hands of the Physicians and the surgeons Lord we just pray that you'll just anoint each one of them watch over lord just touch them and Lord as we come to speak your word we just pray that you come the Holy Ghost come that touches each one of us Lord as as the scripture says Isaiah was said he was man of unclean lips but the angel came down and took the coal and touched his lips Lord that he could speak your word Lord we're standing here the same way tonight we just pray that you come speak I can't do it in myself we look unto you for all things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one it says and you ha he quickened who were dead in sin in trespasses and sins wherein time passed he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also ye all had our conversations we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you may be seated this evening Lord bless the me of the word and uh just want to speak on a little little thought this evening about going from being the scripture says that we were dead in sin but uh 1 Peter 2:24 says who his own bear our sins in his own body speaking of Jesus on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed right and So speaking of being dead in sins but we are going as the scripture says we are dead to sins and um you know the message thingy man's filter brother random says that he said when you come into this world you were born in sin you didn't even have a Fighting Chance you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies within your own Spirit the desire of sin a lover of sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance but he said but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that be to draw right so there be something to draw and in second in 2 Corinthians 5:14 says for the love of God constrain us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again and so we know that we were dead in sin shaping iniquity a lover of sin separated from God because you I think it's a really really important thing and I know we we all understand this but you know it's a really amazing thing when you talk to people and especially people in this message because they don't realize where they came from because all they can do is talk about how predestinated they are because they oh I'm predestinated I'm predestinated you were separated from God you were lost in and you know because the scripture tells us in Ephesians said we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others we were just like everybody else you know because there was nothing there was nothing good in me right because when I because you realize just how low down and rotten you are because you were just like everybody else you came the same way because we're all born between Satan and Eve so we all had the same nature we had the same desire we all came the same way but the scripture says but it was God who was rich in Mercy to us see it wasn't anything that I done it was God who was rich in Mercy to me oh yeah because I you know I can stand up I can't uh hold anything that I've ever done but I can but I can stand up and Proclaim what he's done what he's done for me because that's the that's the greatest thing in my life is what he's done for me not what I've done for myself because I can't do anything for myself because most of the time when I try to do something for myself because that's one of the things I want to talk about tonight is because when we try to do things for ourselves we get in the way right but see the thing is is we you know uh brother said that uh told he said there were too many live people we bury too many live people see the thing is is God wants us dead because see he said because he says if you die then the his life can be born in you that's right because Paul said it's no longer I that Liv but Christ that lives in me amen so he reckoned that he was dead so he had to come to a place to realize I'm dead yes Lord as brother random said that old nature had to die that old husband had to die there had to be a death there had to be a separation so that's what we come to we have to realize who we are where we came from and what we have had to come to and I believe lots of times what has happened is there's not there's not enough there's not enough dying out there's not been a death see you've got to come to a place that you actually die out come on Roman Romans 6 verse one says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid shall we that are dead in sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also shall walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likess of his resurrection we shall also be we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that hence forth for we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin that if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall live with him amen knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise reckon ye Al your also yourselves to be dead indeed under sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord and I I love that scripture I know brother D you know that's the scripture that he always reads at a baptismal service but you know it it really always stands out to me because if we understand what is taking place because we have died with him because he died right and rose again amen that we in and light in his likeness amen go through the same process showing that that by in the baptism showing that that there is a an out sh outward expression of an inward work that that we go down in in his likeness that we come up that when we come to this place because there because there's a definite infilling of the Holy Ghost when you come to this place he said sin has no more dominion over you that that because he is free you have become free also right so that we should because he said he that is dead is freed from sin right that you have become free so as we've come into this place said therefore we are in verse four we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we shall should walk in newness of life right they see there's there's something should take place should be something new right because you're not the same creature that you were before but you become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen he said knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin that he should have no more dominion over us for he said for that in he died he died into sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but also unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord right so we have so when we die we don't have we're not under Dominion but you know what we allow just as Eve allowed we allow sin to hold us that's right we allow it's not something that's holding it we because we have by he took dominion over sin because the scripture tells us that that he became sin who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of God right but we took on his righteousness because he took on our sin right so when he took on our sin and we and we take on his righteousness and then the scripture tells us that death or sin has no more dominion over us the only the only way that it holds us is that we allow it to hold us we because we allow it to hold us see we we are in this P predicament because of ourselves right and so we we are bound by these things because of what what we allow to happen to us we allow it to ourselves but you know what God has made a way right God has opened up the way for us but you know what we have to accept it right see we have to recognize what's taking place amen that God is speaking to each one of us amen there's a and see because we have to have understanding but you have to have faith which is a revelation because as we were speaking of in the Bible study something brother was talking about faith brings us into a realm to change our situation right Faith brings us into a place because you know we create the atmosphere that we live in you know because it's not because you know I preaching on one time talking about our atmosphere and our environment so we can allow our environment to control everything but you know he said that we are many Creator we create the atmosphere that we live in it has nothing to do with the environment that you're in but it's the atmosphere that you create because the Hebrew children see they said we don't know if God would deliver us or not but he said we still won't bow to your idol we still won't bow we still won't belong to your program because we're going to serve God come on and he said even if we die we're going to die believing standing for what we believe and when they when they heated up the furnace and they were going to throw them in see brother M said that because God saw their faith that he had to come himself he could have sent an angel but he said no he said I'm coming myself that that was in the midst of this fire that was hotter than any other time that they were standing in the midst of that and he came down and stood with them right because here they are they're in this burning furnace you know and all the thing it done was it loosed them right it burned off their the the ropes and things that were holding them walked around in the midst of it because when the king looked in you know he saw four of them walking around and when they when they came out they didn't even have the smell of smoke on them there was nothing that had you know nothing they weren't sins when want a sunburn wasn't nothing come on they come out just as perfectly as whole as they went in and there they were but you know what they created the atmosphere that they lived in right and so you have so you and I have the same opportunity we create the atmosphere that we live in we can we can allow we can allow our environment we can allow our circumstances roll control our life ruin our life oh yeah or you know we can we can do something about it because God has given us the opportunity given us the right to do that right there's a man in the scripture that I I wanted to get to this evening in John chapter 5 Terence said I start at 7:30 keep doing all right I'm going to run out of time my check's going to be worthless tonight but anyway I'll get back to the church but anyway uh um John chapter 5 here and I want to I I don't I don't know if any does anybody know brother Murphy want WR uh he's he's a Chinese brother he's in the message goes brother B Church he's one of the first ones that were in the in the message come through and u i I love to hear him preach it and uh he was preaching on this some time back and and it just and it really stood out to me of of what he what he was saying and um I got to meet him a number of years ago just a precious brother I think he's been here to the church before years ago but um I just I just loved hearing preaching you know for a long time I told Brother Ernie one time brother Murphy he would preaching Chinese but he wouldn't preach in English because he had such a problem with his English and he said he just and he would try to testify and the problem was is the scriptures he could remember when they would come to him they come to him in Chinese and he was sitting there trying to translate and you know it's just a you know a a big difference there when you're used to the Chinese language and trying to speak in English audience and you know he just he just had this problem and and I told him I said you know if if you get to a place and I told Brother one time I said if you watch brother Murphy I said when he just relaxes I said he gets so tightened up he gets so tense he gets so nervous I said if you ever watch brother Murphy when he gets just when he relaxes and the Holy Ghost will come and he just relaxes I said he can preach right but he gets so but he gets so conscious about what he's saying and I a lots of times he'll starts quoting stuff we know the scriptures that he's trying to quote I mean he may not get them right but at least we know what he's trying to say and you know he gets all all bound up with things but anyway uh I just every now then I get to I get to listen to him hear him preach and he just does a wonderful job because after so long you know he just finally was able to get over the the psychological issues of being able you know because you get so nervous at it and he was preaching and I I just love this story and and it's about the uh the man at the pole of Bethesda but um verse uh chapter 5 of John and it says and after this there were a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is a there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five forches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he sa unto him will thou be made whole the infinite man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool for while I am coming another steth down before me Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath right now I know we we've heard this story many times but you know what what struck me about this story was here's this man and he had this he had this condition and this the scripture says there was a great multitude of infinite folk and infinite means weak or powerless there was something that was holding each one of these people there was a great multitude there and they and they knew that at the troubling of the waters because at a certain time that angel would come and Trouble the waters right and they would stay there and he said that you know he kept trying to come for 38 years and brother BR said he probably wouldn't die of his condition you know whatever it was that was was holding him you know he said it just kept binding him and he would try all these years trying to make it to the pool when the water was troubled and he said you know there's somebody always come in front of him always stepped in front of him into that pool of water and received their healing but you know what he had great faith because brother R said other people left people got discouraged but you know he stayed there for 38 years you know Abra you know we talk about Abraham and his great faith that he stayed you know believed in the promise for 25 years well here's a man stayed 38 years holding on to One Promise because he knew that there was an angel that could take care of his problem and he laid there and he continued every single year right there why because he was waiting on something to take place and he kept and he kept standing there and he just waiting and waiting and the angel come but you know Jesus knew how long that man had been there Jesus came walking by that man the man because here was waiting on the angel to trouble the water but here was the one that created the Angels right here was here was almighty God in flesh that's right and come and spoke to him amen he was waiting on an angel But Here Come Oh God Almighty in front of him and said wil thou be made whole right see he was waiting on something to take place but the word of God was right in front of him made flesh right he was holding on to a promise but the promise was made flesh right in front of him standing there speaking W thou be made right oh yeah amen he said I'm trying Lord I'm trying because sir when every time I try to make it into the water but I can't make it I'm trying but see Jesus saw the great faith that he had he said take up your bed right see you don't have to worry about looking at the angel troubling the water because I've come because you have great faith and see sometimes we get our eyes fixed on something sometimes we're looking for God to do something in a certain way come on but you know what here he comes in front of us and speaks right and you know what we miss God right you know the other night I was laying in bed and I was thinking about how God has come by my life and you know you know you look back on things brother dick and you say how can I be so stupid God has been right there in front of you he was speaking to you you know sometimes it's like that little story about the man that was you know they were trying to rescue him from the flood and they kept saying the Lord's going to rescue me I'm waiting on the Lord to rescue me right you know and the boat came by and the helicopter came by and he drowned right right and he got upset with God cuz God didn't rescue him right he said I sent a boat and a helicopter right why you blaming me right see we miss God Amen yeah see was trying to get to the troubling of the water come on see sometimes and it really struck me see people people are so wrapped up in things that are taking place see sometimes people get blinded completely blinded by brother brandom oh M they're blinded by the angel ouch but you know what they missed God because brother Brandon was trying to point us to Jesus Christ he's trying to get us to see God Almighty amen see see it wasn't it wasn't the great ministry that God had the relationship that brother Brenham had with Jesus Christ it's to see you and him together right to see who you are right it's a wonderful thing to know who brother Brandon was but God wants me to know who I am amen that's it we can we can lay beside the pool all day long for years blessing but you know what Jesus will walk right past us and speak to us come are we willing to catch his Voice come on do we see who what's taking place come on see sometimes we we think things are just going to come and and happen a certain way and we'll miss God because you know we don't we don't like the person right we don't like his shirt oh my we don't like his language oh my come on we don't like his hair or the lack thereof heard somebody say that his hair was in Retreat mine's mine's in the what they say that the the rear is advancing one these days we don't have to have haircut anymore BL you see sometimes we miss God and God's right there in front of us God speaks to us right and sometimes it we look back he like you know I've missed God because God was trying to do something for us and sometimes it's we continue to see that he's there speaking to us and it goes on and on right and sometimes we catch it and it's like Lord forgive me because I've been so stupid because you spoke to me and we don't recognize you right we don't recognize sometimes we come to church we don't recognize that he's here come on we get we get wrapped up in other things and that's what Satan is here to do he's here to Blind you right he's here to put things in your mind he's here to he's here to interrupt all that he can so that God can't speak to you right he's he's here to mess it all up but you know that's what that's what the the ministry has been sent for and that's what he's come to do is to help you oh yeah just like when Daniel you know Daniel Prayed for 21 days trying to get an answer yeah but you know what the answer was on its way from the very first day that he put his heart to understand the angel was standing there right the angel came to bring him the understanding and sometimes we think well God's not hearing us sometimes we don't see in that other realm what's taking place come on we don't see what's taking place sometimes we need to just take a step back and think about it because you know what if we have we have set our heart to understand he give us the understanding that's right he's coming to bring you the understanding that's right sometimes but sometimes we have to get ourselves out of the way amen and sometimes it's us and not him it's always me oh my amen this is from the message birth pains speaking on he says not talking about natural normal typing the spiritual now it's talk about bringing a baby because you know that that's what natural typing the spiritual see we got to come to a place that we come to to a new birth right you know and because um W was taking you know he was writing down the names of people of family members and and ones in in this church that have not reached that place yet you know I believe it was Paul you know he said and he ministered in his church and he wanted because he wanted every person in his church to be born again right and I think St Martin was the same way that he that he that that was his desire see because if you've reached this place see it solves so many problems why while people have so many issues and problems they're not born heard heard brother say one time said we wonder why people don't grow up in church how can they grow up they never been born come on Amen there's no growth until you're born that's right but he said and the message this is from in birth pain he says but normal type in the spiritual now we find out that it's fully born when the baby usually now when the water breaks you don't have to do very much about it but when the blood comes you don't have to do much about it but in order to get life in the baby you've got to give him a spanking and make him yell out and now he now education speaking about he just try try to type these thingss and he said says now you take that some kind of a shock maybe you wouldn't have to spank him but just shock him a little the very idea of him being born sometimes will do it grab him Shake him if he don't start breathing spank him a little and then he yells out in unknown tongues to himself I guess but see anyhow he's making a noise and if I yell and if I think if a baby is born just by still birth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see so then to wake them up to bring them to themselves so that God can breathe the breath of life into them and that's what we find that's so true and so he goes on he says he said so no it is a seed's birth the old seed must die before the new one can can be born so therefore death is hard anytime it's so painful it's distressful birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world it's painful amen and this is from um basis of Fellowship brother continue on what constitutes the natural birth constitutes the spiritual birth if a baby's born and he's still born he doesn't cry there's no emotion to him what's the matter with him he's a dead born baby that's what's the matter with the churches today what's wrong with our what's wrong with our Pentecostals we're bringing forth too many dead born babies exactly right yes sir we are that's exactly right why do we what do we do with a baby if he's still born like that you just take him by the heels and raise him up and give him a little posterior protoplasma stimulation just as hard as you can and that fixes him up and if anything the church needs tonight is a good old fashion fashioned gospel spanking with the power of the Holy Ghost so what what is taking place is he saying see that's what what has happened is we have too many people that are uh stillborn because you have to have life life thank you brother there has to be a life there has to be some kind of emotion there has to be some kind of something because you have to display the life come on you know I don't I don't believe everybody has to run in the aisles and speak in tongues because I've seen a lot of that and and believe believe me from the my background blessing I've seen I've seen all kind kind of things and you know you you see people that they can run the aisle speak it in tongues jump jump pews run into things I seen one lady hit a piano so hard I thought it' knock her teeth out just dance in the spirit and up and gone but you know what it doesn't change them they can go through a lot of that but you know what you you have the spirit of of God the life of God it makes itself Dome it makes itself alive you display that life right and he said that's what's wrong when we have so many people that are still born amen see you can you can be all around the message but you know what the life has to be made known you have to have that baby and it has to breathe and it has to function and it has to do the things that babies do right and it's got to come to that place and that's what has happened to a lot of a lot of people they've been around this message but they not come to that place they're not de they're not manifesting the life right the life is not coming on display righten and it's got to come on on display we can see these things we can see who we are because it's got to be made known amen but for that to take place you've got to come to a place where there's a death come on as as brother Bon was speaking he he was speaking and the message hidden life I like told this St all this I started putting things together and then it was like no I'm going to change it and trying to figure out which way to go but you know in the message H life brother R was speaking of um Aaron's Rod when he was bringing Aaron's rod in because he was wanting to show the children of Israel what tribe was going to be chosen and you know he he took each one of those rods and he laid it before the Arc of the Covenant there and and he said that God would make manifest in in the rod that he chose of the tribes he would show who that he had chosen right and he would stood there and he he said you know they they put Aaron's rod in in front of the Ark and then it came forth and he says now when that old dead Rod was brought in there and laid in the presence of God himself what happened it budded it blossomed it yielded fruit showing that we born in that Rod was off an almond tree and when it was cut off it died and when man was cut off from God he died spiritually but once brought into the presence of God before in the place of God before the presence of God it comes to life and he yields life he yields blossoms he yields fruit Jesus come to the tree to look for fruit one on it it had everything but fruit and that's what the matter with our churches today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak in tongues we can argue the scriptures we can teach our theology but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean what is the fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness patience it shows many is still out there under the first altar you're still open to the public you're still listening to to hear what John's got to say about it what the neighbors will think or something for yourself but once inside the veil and the curtain is dropped you're head and God through Christ see amen he says notice what a beautiful picture of The Sinner laying in the presence of God now this Ro laying there it was refreshed it was fragrant brought the uh fragrance of the Blossom and it yielded fruit the buds came forth what a beautiful type of that is given Earthly speaking the first thing that we have to do before we can have a crop we have to have seed and the seed placed in the ground will yield its fruits is that right now the first thing we have to do is receive Christ now the tree had to be an almond tree to start with and Christ you have to receive him before you come into this place and then in the presence of this great God then these things take place right amen so we've got to come to the place because see we realize that even though we were born in sin shapen in iniquity yet we are predestinated we have seed of representation right see we were dead just like that almond tree it was dead that Rod was completely dead cut off but you know what there come a time when that Rod came into the presence of God because it was chosen and it was chosen to show a purpose to show something to the people and when it was late in in front of the Arc of the Covenant and that presence came it brought forth what is exactly what it was supposed to bring forth because inside that that Rod was it was an almond tree so it done exactly what it was supposed to do was supposed to bring forth seed and it was supposed to bring forth Blossom show its fruit and that's exactly what it did and that's what exactly we are supposed to do because he said by their fruit you'll know them right and so if you are because we're dead and sin and trespasses and cut off but when we come back into life when we come back into the presence of God then we bring forth the fruit of God come on we bring forth the fruit of the spirit right Lord see but God wants us dead so that he can bring forth because he can bring forth his fruit when we get in the way right see God is wanting us to get out of the way so that he can do what he wants to do amen bless hope this is all right I have a little I have a little story on you know brother R uh Brother D was speaking about brother R been preaching he said you know he said doesn't God doesn't impute sin to dead dead people that's right right you know who is who is the blessed is the man is the man that's dead he doesn't he doesn't impute sin to him you know you been preaching on on this for a while I was sharing this with Wade and got a little story to tell you actually I got a couple little stories I want to tell you but this one this one was come to mind when when Brother D was preaching the other other day and I don't know is I don't know if youall ever heard the story about the man who wasn't and uh it was this was during World War II and um it was called operation mint meet and it was it was a British operation and um in uh I believe in the 4043 the Allies were in North Africa you know they had the campaign in North Africa and they had taken U that part and they were wanting to go into uh Europe and they were trying to get into into France and everything and uh church here was looking at it looking at the map and the Germans knew where the Allies were trying to get to so they fortified the area they really entrenched theirself in Sicily because that was the place that you would want to go to as you believe trying to cross the Mediterranean there and Church Hill stood there and said only a fool would realize that it you know only a fool would realize that it wasn't Sicily you know because everybody wanted to go to Sicily that's the reason the Germans were entrenched there he said a fool wouldn't pick Sicily and they were sitting over there trying to figure out how they're going to cross into into um into Sicily and trying to advance the the operations and this young man came up with a plan he said what we need to do is get the German to make the Germans think we're going somewhere else and they'll move he said well how are you going to do that this young man come up with an idea they had tried this before and it didn't work because they tried to fool the Germans and Germans didn't bite so they thought well we we'll try it again and uh what what their what their plan was the man came up with was uh they wanted to take a a a man dress him up as an officer they were going to float him in the in the ocean and have uh papers on him that they would think that they the Germans had gotten secrets from the Allies well they found a man that U had had died of pneumonia and his family gave the body to the government to and they made him up as a a royal marine officer and he had these all these papers on him and they stuck him in the ocean and the Spanish picked him out out of the ocean and brought him in well right after they they got him in the Allies started to run around with their spies and they were trying to figure out where this man went because they said there was a plane crash this plane had went down this man had drowned he had secrets on them we need him well then everybody sent all the word went back to the Germans that hey we got this man over here that's got secrets well they took came in they examined the body they took all these papers they made copies of it and the Germans were looking the Allies were wanting the British were wanting their officer back so they made copies of it they sent it back to the Spanish the Spanish gave them back to the British and the British took the papers and realized that they had made copies of all the papers the Germans had the plan and he said no we just got to wait well they asked ger they asked Church Hill they said Church said what are we going to do if this don't work he said we're going to take that man we're going to float him in the ocean again we're going to make this thing work well they went out there and they they got they got the papers in the Germans started looking at them well as soon as Hitler saw the papers he knew it was real they're going to Sardinia in Greece and he said well how do you know that because one of the high ranking officers in the British army had written to another man and he said one of these days I'll meet you and we'll have sardines well obviously that was code that they were going to Sardinia it had to be where they were going Hitler believed it melini said no they argued over Hitler said no were moving the Germans so he moved them and he set them up because they were going to Sardinia well in all of this the the British had piled all their men to go right into Sicily well Hitler believ that was that was just a front they were not going there well as soon as German the Germans packed up and started moving the Allies went right into Sicily and see and it all became because of a dead man they said a dead man don't tell lies he don't tell secrets that don't mean he don't carry them but say that's what they needed they needed a dead man right and that's what God wants God wants somebody that's dead why because the man couldn't tell couldn't mess the plan up all he had to do was floating in the water he was dead and you know there's a great Monument built to this man and you know he's really a highly recognized man that they were talking about for many years they didn't even know who he was but you know what it took a dead man to and it was one of the greatest greatest men in all of World War II history that it took a dead man to win a great campaign see a lot of people think you know we look at Patton and all of these Eisenhower and all this one of the greatest uh movements operations ever took place took of dead man they used the dead man to bring it to pass and they tore up Hitler soad that twice after that one time we had a a uh a beach landing and they had papers they were showing Advanced movements and things that were going to take place and Hitler didn't believe it because he got burnt by this and one time they had uh where they were showing the Allies were doing the paratroopers where the paratroopers were actually coming in and they the Germans had actually had Advanced uh copies of our plans of what we were going to do and and Hitler believed that it was a fake he actually thought that because of he got burned so bad at Sicily that when he actually had real plans he thought they were planted to fall into German hands so to see if they would buy it again and so it took it took a dead man to bring this to pass one of the greatest one of the greatest things that took place was a dead man and see you know God wants wants us to be dead so we think sometimes I can't do anything you just die out to yourself and let God move he'll take care of it he'll do what needs to be done see if we can if we can stand there and realize who who we are if we can just die out to ourselves oh yeah then he can live he can be made manifest right if we die ourselves right I have one other little story I want to share it I'm going stop this is Napoleon said Napoleon's war machine was drafting large numbers into his army and a young father was about to be inducted his wife and children were gathering around him as tearful as scene as Can Be Imagined and in response to their desperate situation on of the young man's neighbors stepped forward one of the uh man's neighbors stepped forward to take his place in response to their desperate s as the laws and customs of the time allowed took his place later on this man who volunteered in place of the young father was killed in battle several years later after his death the draft once again made its way to the same Village and the father P picked out for induction into the army this time however the young father boldly stepped before the draft board and produced a parchment which he displayed tearfully for all to see it read this man perished upon the battlefield of ravoli in the name of his substitute signed Napoleon bonapart there was a man that that took his place and this man instead of being separated from his family and having to die he had someone to come and take his place that he could stand before him and say listen I've already dieden I'm already dead why because somebody took my place you know we can stand and say the same thing it's no longer I that live now come on but it's Christ that lives in me right because he's tooken my place and I can stand and boldly and boldly Proclaim I'm dead come on you see I can still tell the devil why because I I'm dead and my life is hid in Christ I have I have I'm fortified behind the word right and there's a scripture there you know speaking of I'm not going to finish I'm I'm going read this right quick I told him I was going to finish I promise I'll be done here in a minute you want do but I but I love this because I want in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 says it says verse 15 says and that he died for all that they should which live should not henceforth live under themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh y though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature right all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given us to us the ministry of recognition of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world and himself not imputing their trespasses to them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so we know no Christ by the flesh he said and now he said therefore any man being Christ he's a new creature and he's been GI he's given us the word of reconciliation that we that we come to this place to it says to reconciliation to restore relationship or Harmony to cover see we've come to this place where we've received this this ministry and the word has been given to us to bring us to this place and the scripture goes on to tell us there in in chapter 5 he says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon which our house with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we should not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life right so we have received this message of reconciliation we've received this word and because of this word that we have received because we're in this Earthly house Paul Paul speaking of this Earthly house because we have something to clothe us but put to put on his he said that mortality that this Mortal may take on immortality that we may be swallowed up of Life why because that all that is dead because all of this that is enmity will be swallowed up in life right because we are groaning because we should have this groaning in us because if we're born again there's a groaning to be changed there's a groaning to be changed to be carried on to the word into the fullness of the word amen amen and so the scripture tells us there in in end of uh chapter 4 there in he says for verse 15 says for all things are of your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God for which cause we F not but though our outward man perish he said but the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are but at the things which are not seen which are seen but that things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen so we can see that when we have these things see there's a groaning taking place but you know what we're being renewed the inner man is being renewed day by day so even even though when we get older because we're still going through the aches and the pains and the groanings of this old flesh but the inward man is being renewed right see I look at that when I when I read that I read that as a promise why because it's what he said he said the renew he said the inner man is being renewed day by day he's taking place so what is it he said he said what is it he said your glorified body is being born around built around your Born Again experience so that you have received this born again experien because the new man has come in so it's taking over this outer man there's an enmity taking place but you know what he is succumbing to the will and the of the word that is placed on the inside so we are coming to this place thank you Lord but you know what it takes our faith it takes a revelation to see who we are but you know what it's taking place every day we might get a little older a few more aches and pains like brother Mark you can take your vitamins drink your teas nothing wrong with that but you know what we're still getting older right but you know what there's only one thing that's going to take take you through and that's the word amen the inner man being fed just like brother brother ra speaking of the chief there you know he said which one which one of the the black and the white dog he said which one wins he said the one I feed the most right he said see if we feed on if we feed on the things that the inner man can fight that he can feed on that he grows you know what the outer man becomes weaker and weaker amen that we can bring this this flesh this spirit that we have under sub jection that's it bring it under the subjection of the word amen and create the atmosphere that we want to live in that we can be who we say we want to be right who the word says we are and then we can make that manifest amen I'm I'm so glad to know who I am amen but you know what it's a day-to-day fight let's all stand this evening but it's a day-to-day fight but you know what we have to every single day you got to stand up and say I'm a take what's mine I'm I'm going to be what God has made me because he he's given it to us but you know it takes you and I to accept it and then we take what God has given us and then we make it manifest right amen amen amen I'm so glad to know who I am amen 280 in the red
