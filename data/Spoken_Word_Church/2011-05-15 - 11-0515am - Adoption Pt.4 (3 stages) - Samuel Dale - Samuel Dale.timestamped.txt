[35:09] the things we kind of uh closed out a
[35:11] little bit on the
[35:13] predestination and now we're on the uh
[35:16] adoption in three stages and also we're
[35:20] try to make it you know stick with what
[35:23] we've been reading in Ephesians so if
[35:25] you'd like to follow along Ephesians 1
[35:28] one blessed be the God and father of our
[35:31] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[35:33] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[35:35] places in Christ according as he has
[35:38] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[35:40] of the world that we should be holding
[35:43] Without Blame before him in love having
[35:45] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[35:48] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[35:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[35:53] will to the praise of the glory of his
[35:56] Gra Grace wherein he hath made it us
[35:59] accepted in the Beloved amen now we
[36:03] we'll go to Romans
[36:10] 8 reading verse 14 for as many as are
[36:14] led by the spirit of God they are the
[36:16] sons of God for ye have not received the
[36:19] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[36:21] have received the spirit of adoption
[36:23] whereby we cry Abby father the spirit
[36:27] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[36:29] that we are the children of God and if
[36:31] children then ours of God and Joint ours
[36:34] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[36:36] him that we may be also glorified
[36:39] together for I reckon that the
[36:41] sufferings of this present time are not
[36:43] worthy to be compared with the glory
[36:45] which shall be revealed in us for the
[36:47] earnest expectation of the creature
[36:49] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[36:52] sons of God you may be seated Lord add
[36:55] his Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[36:57] of the
[37:00] word now as I said we're trying to speak
[37:04] about
[37:06] adoption and we gave you the quote there
[37:08] the other day and and brother randam
[37:10] says it on the message of position in
[37:13] Christ paragraph uh 163 and I give you
[37:17] the the dates on these adoption because
[37:21] uh the there is a difference between the
[37:25] wording they use in the the what we were
[37:28] using of say one message formality and
[37:32] then the the new version that they came
[37:34] out from from spoken word and uh you
[37:37] know the voice of God recording uh so I
[37:40] give you the date all right that way you
[37:44] can check the date see like brother Joe
[37:46] and I were looking a minute ago on where
[37:48] it says like Ephesians parallels Joshua
[37:51] we see in the new version they don't use
[37:53] that title they use just adoption one
[37:56] adoption 2 adoption three adoption four
[37:59] all right if you got the red composite
[38:01] book that's the way it's put out but I
[38:04] give you the date that way you can check
[38:06] the date of the tape or the the book so
[38:11] the one position in Christ is preached
[38:13] in 19 uh 6522 in the evening service
[38:17] that brother Brown says that ask said Do
[38:20] You Believe In
[38:21] dispensations And I know people say well
[38:24] we don't believe in dispensations well
[38:25] see a dispens
[38:27] is like it it it's a time set or a time
[38:31] for something to take place or the
[38:33] taking place of that during the time in
[38:37] other words it's like setting an order
[38:39] of events and brother R says on that he
[38:41] says now there was a dispensation of
[38:43] Moses there was a dispensation of John
[38:46] the Baptist there was a dispensation uh
[38:49] of the the church ages in other words
[38:51] and he said there was a dispensation of
[38:53] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he
[38:56] said and now is the dispensation of
[38:58] adoption see in the day and the age that
[39:01] we're in so in other words this is a
[39:03] time for
[39:04] it this is the time to come to fulfill a
[39:09] dispensation or or a time period that
[39:13] will make itself you know be made
[39:14] manifest during that part all right and
[39:17] that's what I've been trying to tell you
[39:19] and to talk about it is we we took the
[39:21] life of Jesus Christ and seeing that he
[39:24] came through the the stages of adoption
[39:28] and uh you know and doing that then we
[39:32] must also uh come through that or go
[39:35] through that stages also now it's
[39:37] different in the way that he went but it
[39:40] means the same that's the point I'm
[39:43] trying to get you to see because Paul
[39:45] was not telling the
[39:48] Romans the what we're we would want to
[39:51] read and see uh he was not uh telling
[39:55] them you know that uh hey uh you're
[40:00] already
[40:01] Israelites he wasn't telling them that
[40:04] because adoption pertained to Israel it
[40:07] was an Israeli custom it's good to see
[40:09] our visitors back there with us we
[40:11] always say welcome to you one time two
[40:13] times you're part of us but see
[40:18] it's in other words they Paul wasn't
[40:22] telling them he was telling them that
[40:24] you receive the spirit of adoption
[40:26] he wasn't telling them that you uh know
[40:29] all about adoption so now your adoption
[40:31] that took place in your your life as an
[40:34] Israeli you know as a a Jew uh that's
[40:38] not what we're talking
[40:41] about because see that was their custom
[40:44] and their ways uh see he wouldn't be
[40:46] saying that you you you don't need the
[40:49] new birth because you were already an
[40:51] adopted Jew see that wasn't it that's
[40:54] what I tried to get you to see the the
[40:56] difference between the Old Testament
[40:58] form and the New Testament see no one in
[41:02] the Old Testament could receive eternal
[41:04] life now they have to die go by the
[41:08] grave wait or whatever or be be you know
[41:11] beyond the curtain of time or whatever
[41:12] you want to call it in a position but
[41:15] they never received eternal life until
[41:18] Jesus Christ came and died to release
[41:21] that life all right then they could be
[41:24] taken up to a position to wait you know
[41:27] there and all and they could receive the
[41:30] eternal life there that's fine to give
[41:32] it to them in the in the resurrection
[41:34] but don't give it to them as Old
[41:36] Testament people cuz see that was a
[41:39] dispensation a time that Jesus Christ
[41:42] had not died but then see he comes over
[41:44] and when he dies then it's now we're
[41:46] capable of receiving eternal life and I
[41:48] wanted you to see that about Paul he
[41:50] calls it the spirit of
[41:53] adoption all right see trying to explain
[41:58] to the
[41:59] Romans now these Romans were are not
[42:02] just totally
[42:04] Gentile because all of this was
[42:06] basically to the
[42:07] Jews but he was trying to get them as I
[42:09] said to see that this because that they
[42:12] believed in adoption because they had
[42:14] come to their and I always mispronounced
[42:16] it but Mar barit how you say it of the
[42:19] the thing when they reached a certain
[42:20] age you know that that is uh in the
[42:23] natural of the the people of Israel they
[42:26] still do that today right but that if
[42:30] you went over right now you wouldn't go
[42:31] up to one of them and say you've already
[42:33] been adopted into your family so all you
[42:36] need is a change of the
[42:39] body right you wouldn't say that to them
[42:41] would you tell them they need to be born
[42:43] again Nicodemus had went through those
[42:46] stages right and Jesus didn't say
[42:49] because of you who you are and you've
[42:50] already been adopted no that's only an
[42:54] example right
[42:57] brother brandom as he's using it he's
[42:59] using the Old Testament custom of the
[43:03] people of Israel you know the Jews to to
[43:07] explain adoption to us cuz that's the
[43:11] same thing Paul's doing he's not telling
[43:13] them you're already adopted so that no
[43:16] he he told them that they buy the new
[43:19] birth cuz if you go back and read before
[43:22] then and you know you said if the spirit
[43:24] of him that raised up Jesus Christ be in
[43:26] you verse 11 uh you see if it raise up
[43:29] Christ it'll raise you up so he's
[43:31] talking to people with the new
[43:33] birth and he's telling them what the
[43:36] things that are to take place and by
[43:39] receiving that new birth they have the
[43:42] spirit of
[43:43] adoption whereby they cry out by father
[43:46] in other words they're in the kingdom of
[43:47] God cuz there was no way to get in the
[43:50] Kingdom of God in the Old Testament
[43:52] right you got to be born again to be in
[43:55] the kingdom of God
[43:56] and it could only start on the day of
[43:58] Pentecost cuz it was in Jesus Christ the
[44:01] kingdom was in him but it had to be
[44:03] brought into
[44:04] manifestation all right so I want to
[44:06] make sure you don't misunderstand then
[44:09] as we go
[44:10] along so then there there was a
[44:16] dispensation of the outpouring of the
[44:18] Holy Ghost there was a dispensation of
[44:22] to where that it was down to different
[44:24] stages of the church ages
[44:26] or a time but now we're in the
[44:29] dispensation of coming to understand the
[44:32] full measure of understanding adoption
[44:35] all right then it's taught in three
[44:37] stages all right see Jesus Christ had a
[44:40] a water baptism a recognition an
[44:43] identification a receiving of the Holy
[44:45] Spirit not as a new birth I put that on
[44:48] there because everybody wants to get so
[44:50] confused with it so they won't link me
[44:52] with somebody else's Doctrine I believe
[44:54] he received the new the the baptism of
[44:57] the Holy Ghost yeah we can say that cuz
[44:58] that's the way the prophet used it but
[45:00] as an anointing not as a new
[45:04] birth but as an anointing for his
[45:06] ministry to go forth you know and preach
[45:09] the gospel because that's what he goes
[45:10] right over immediately in the Book of
[45:13] Luke you find him saying that that
[45:14] Spirit came upon him that was Isaiah to
[45:17] fulfill the scripture this day that
[45:18] scriptures fulfilled you know all right
[45:21] see then in
[45:22] that he had a time of identification
[45:27] all right then he had a time of
[45:29] Authority or positionally placing on the
[45:33] amount of
[45:34] transfiguration and to hear ye him came
[45:37] into being see and truly then we'll get
[45:41] to it later you know how that I've
[45:43] already preached it many many years to
[45:45] us to where it says there in Romans it
[45:47] doesn't say that adoption to Redemption
[45:51] of the
[45:52] body it says the adoption to wh
[45:56] the Redemption of the body to
[46:00] understand right and truly Jesus
[46:03] understood the the uh the the Redemption
[46:07] of the body because he said what he said
[46:09] destroy this body and other words
[46:12] destroy this temple in 3 days I'll bring
[46:14] it up he understood he knew what the
[46:17] Redemption was about cuz he knew that
[46:20] that what was said over there at the the
[46:24] time is called the River Jordan
[46:26] position at his baptism to where it says
[46:29] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[46:30] pleased to dwell and brother randam
[46:32] interpreted that in other words or
[46:34] translated that into modern-day language
[46:38] to say this is the part of the earth
[46:40] that I have redeemed and from this part
[46:42] of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it
[46:45] so Jesus had understanding to it to
[46:49] understand he knew about the Redemption
[46:51] of the body all right so I'm not
[46:53] concerned about the body being chained
[46:58] right you know just like years ago I
[47:00] told you I said I quit trying to go to
[47:04] heaven people didn't understand that you
[47:06] know well what do you mean you don't
[47:08] want to go I didn't say I didn't want to
[47:09] go I said I quit trying to go because
[47:12] that was our point we always want to go
[47:14] to heaven go to heaven now I want heaven
[47:16] to come here because if God don't come
[47:19] here I don't go
[47:21] there and that's that's what I've tried
[47:23] to express to you for many years so is
[47:25] it with the I'm not concerned about the
[47:28] Redemption of the body I'm concerned
[47:31] about to Wi to understand right how this
[47:35] body is redeemed that's right all right
[47:38] and I believe that we'll come to that
[47:40] eventually in the the understanding
[47:42] because we must have our
[47:45] baptism not only natural but spiritual
[47:48] we had our water baptism and like I told
[47:50] you if you ref refuse to get baptized in
[47:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then
[47:55] don't worry about the rest of adoption
[47:56] you're not even in the stages yet you're
[47:59] not even in the journey so just forget
[48:00] it cuz you won't follow the word all
[48:03] right but see then we come to this water
[48:06] baptism and the natural then the
[48:08] spiritual and the baptism of the Holy
[48:10] Ghost bringing us into the body of
[48:13] Christ and then we can talk about the
[48:15] hear ye himym the adoption the authority
[48:18] and then go on to understand the
[48:20] Redemption of the body because to me
[48:22] it's that's what it's doing so we're in
[48:24] that dispens ation or
[48:26] time to understand uh let's the
[48:30] Ecclesiastes says it like this says it's
[48:32] a time to all times it doesn't say
[48:35] there's a time for all things there's a
[48:37] time to all things right see this is the
[48:40] time to understand and that's what I'm
[48:43] trying to get us to to to bring to that
[48:46] point but now this past Wednesday I know
[48:49] I would just got down talking to you cuz
[48:52] see I want you to understand so much
[48:54] until it gets on me to the way to try to
[48:58] express it and I'm sorry if I say
[48:59] something hard uh whatever just lay it
[49:02] to my old ways and ignorance and never
[49:04] what else you know and just say well
[49:06] he's just getting
[49:07] old but if I believe I believe if I was
[49:10] you and about to R and probably verify a
[49:12] lot of it that he's redoing the tape
[49:14] system for us and he told me the other
[49:16] day he said you're saying the same thing
[49:18] now you're saying then so I I I wouldn't
[49:21] go along with that too much but I'm just
[49:24] saying that I want you to
[49:27] understand and it doesn't matter to me
[49:29] to take service after service on one
[49:31] point to try to get it to us because the
[49:33] prophet said hold that up until the
[49:35] people gets it well bear with me maybe
[49:37] it's me so you bear with me till I get
[49:39] it all right because I want it too but
[49:43] see I believe you must be born
[49:46] again to be in the body of
[49:50] Christ then that way we come to what
[49:53] Paul is saying to the Romans
[49:57] that if we have the spirit verse 11 that
[50:00] raised up Jesus Christ in US it'll also
[50:04] raise us up he's he's linking the whole
[50:07] thing to the New
[50:09] Birth because the prophet said that's
[50:11] the most important thing in your life is
[50:14] the new birth because we're not even a
[50:17] child of God other than a natural Child
[50:20] by natural creation that everybody in
[50:23] the world is a natural Child by natur
[50:25] creation cuz God's the only one that can
[50:27] give life but see then we must be born
[50:30] again to be in the body of
[50:33] Christ all right then being born again
[50:37] we're just using then the natural story
[50:40] of a child the of the Jews Like The
[50:43] Prophet is using it you know a natural
[50:46] uh Israeli person who would come to the
[50:49] uh natural adoption things and as I said
[50:51] they're still doing that we were we
[50:53] happen to be there and we Act happened
[50:55] to view brother de s Piggy and my wife
[50:58] we actually viewed about a 13-year-old
[51:02] boy that was going through his part and
[51:04] you know we we were interested we we we
[51:07] we didn't run off we wanted to stay and
[51:10] and I'd like to stay there probably
[51:11] instead of going on with the guide but
[51:14] we got in trouble a few times about that
[51:16] anyway but it's all right uh we got we
[51:19] got through but uh see Paul is not
[51:24] telling let me repeat that I want you to
[51:27] understand he's not telling these people
[51:30] here that oh you always was eternal oh
[51:34] you always was this you always was that
[51:37] you already went through all of these
[51:38] stages of your adoptions and things and
[51:41] probably a lot of the people that he was
[51:43] talking to was standing there with the
[51:46] full signant
[51:47] ring of their father's adoption right
[51:52] you know the full Authority was invested
[51:55] in to them but he wasn't telling them
[51:58] that he wasn't saying you're all right
[52:01] he go back and read Romans 8 there down
[52:03] to that see he was telling them by the
[52:08] new birth see brother randam explains he
[52:11] said now the Corinthians had to have it
[52:12] explained to them over and over but he
[52:14] said most of the books they didn't have
[52:16] to explain he said especially like
[52:18] Ephesians or something he said because
[52:20] they understood well see the Romans
[52:22] could understand certain things so he
[52:25] was capable of speaking a greater depth
[52:27] to them of this adoption
[52:30] situation and expressing it to them you
[52:33] know but he was remember the one thing
[52:36] that I like what brother Brown brings
[52:37] out in the book of Hebrews that brother
[52:40] Brown says Paul was trying to get it out
[52:43] of those people's minds see we've been
[52:45] taught all of our life that Paul you
[52:47] know I mean it was back when we was in
[52:49] denomination that that Paul was telling
[52:51] them the Lord's coming just the Lord's
[52:52] coming Lord just now he was trying to
[52:54] get it out of their mind mind that the
[52:56] Lord was coming he said there must be a
[52:58] falling away there must be these things
[53:01] see get it out of your mind he wasn't
[53:03] telling the Romans here that you're
[53:06] okay he was telling them the stages they
[53:10] must go
[53:11] through to come to the position that he
[53:14] was trying to speak of but remember that
[53:17] could not take place back there before
[53:20] all of this could transpire we had the
[53:23] falling away right and then you had to
[53:25] have the restoration coming back in the
[53:27] last days in a zeusa street coming forth
[53:30] with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[53:32] and bringing the people back into the
[53:34] body of Christ in the the correct way
[53:36] not that nobody wasn't in there before
[53:38] but bringing it back to the three stages
[53:40] all right so then we we're we're tying
[53:43] it together so just get that point in
[53:46] mind so what would the child do
[53:50] now in the natural story The Prophet
[53:53] explains and you've read all of it and
[53:54] heard the message and all that he
[53:58] explains that that child is a
[54:01] child when it was born into the
[54:04] family but said it was
[54:07] not didn't have any
[54:11] inheritance in other words it didn't
[54:13] have any Authority it didn't have any
[54:15] recognition of those points but it was
[54:18] in the family all right and it was given
[54:21] a tutor to raise it all right and he
[54:24] said now you choose the best tutor you
[54:26] could get all right see then he goes in
[54:29] explaining that what see when we receive
[54:32] the new birth you remember how Wednesday
[54:34] was talking about it when we receive the
[54:37] new birth we receive that Spirit of
[54:40] adoption which is the holy spirit that's
[54:43] why it's called the spirit of adoption
[54:45] by
[54:46] Paul we receive the New Birth the spirit
[54:49] of
[54:50] adoption cuz it adopts us into the
[54:54] family
[54:56] see we were Gentiles totally gone and no
[54:59] no lineage no connection see and even
[55:02] the natural Jew couldn't get into the
[55:04] kingdom of God because he was born a
[55:06] natural Jew he had to be born again
[55:09] right to get into the kingdom of God
[55:11] you'd be surprised how many people of
[55:12] the message don't understand that cuz
[55:14] you listen to him preach
[55:15] it like one big man said one time and I
[55:18] heard him I wouldn't said he said I
[55:19] don't believe in
[55:21] dispensations well you brother R said
[55:23] you're sure out of the Bible if you
[55:24] don't that's now I mean so you know but
[55:28] of course everybody wants to say what
[55:29] they want to that's their business but
[55:31] now listen see we must have the new
[55:34] birth to bring us into the family of
[55:37] God all right that would be then like
[55:41] that natural baby back there as the
[55:45] example as the natural Israelite would
[55:49] be brought into the family by his
[55:52] natural
[55:53] birth think we're brought into the
[55:56] family by the spiritual Birth by the
[55:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[56:00] prophet said God gave us the best tutor
[56:03] he could get he said he gave us the holy
[56:06] spirit all right now I've tried to say
[56:09] this and most of you know it you know
[56:11] what I'm fixing to say but I've been at
[56:13] this for over 30 years on that 40 years
[56:15] going on it see the way I look at what
[56:18] most people teach of adoption it's the
[56:21] father just going off the scene and he's
[56:23] never seen anymore just disappearing you
[56:26] know and really here comes the son boy
[56:28] he's strutting on you know
[56:31] he I I just don't understand
[56:35] that because I thought that the Holy
[56:40] Spirit and the father was a selfs sign
[56:43] Spirit as I said Wednesday or the
[56:44] prophet said Jesus had two
[56:47] daddies because he said the Holy Ghost
[56:50] was his daddy and he said his father was
[56:51] his daddy till he have two daddies or
[56:54] something's wrong so it have to be the
[56:56] same holy spirit so look what I'm
[56:58] talking about the father picked the best
[57:01] tutor he could get what he came himself
[57:03] to dwell in
[57:05] us now come on that's how much do we
[57:08] need where brother R said he didn't even
[57:10] send a son to die in his place that's
[57:12] right said he came
[57:16] himself all right see then the holy
[57:19] spirit is not another Spirit different
[57:22] from
[57:23] God right right it's God's Own Spirit
[57:26] dwelling in us he's wanting his nature
[57:30] in us so he's coming in us to start the
[57:33] thing maybe forgive me for language like
[57:36] that but God because I don't know have
[57:37] no other way of saying it but it's
[57:39] pretty good point that's the way to get
[57:41] it started bring us into the family by
[57:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[57:46] that is the spirit of the father that's
[57:49] within us right we're talking about
[57:52] adoption is talking about getting the
[57:54] nature of the father right well look
[57:56] behind me at the Statue of a perfect
[58:00] man I thought that was to bring us into
[58:03] the nature of the
[58:05] father I thought faith virt and all temp
[58:07] Pati god brother kind and all the nature
[58:10] of the father being brought into us I
[58:13] thought that's what adoption
[58:16] was that's why it took brother ROM 30
[58:18] something years now this is a quote from
[58:21] statue of perfect man he said 30
[58:23] something years before he could preach
[58:25] the stature of a perfect man amen not
[58:28] that he wasn't preaching it going back
[58:30] in there and get like
[58:32] 1956 and all like that and listen to an
[58:34] inter Veil where he talking about the
[58:36] nature of the father he'd always
[58:38] preached that but this nail that dams he
[58:41] in other words he saw how to bring it
[58:42] into view right all right but you see
[58:46] then he gives us the
[58:48] tutor but the tutor is not another
[58:51] person separate from God that's right
[58:54] right the tutor is the holy spirit amen
[58:57] which is the spirit of almighty God
[59:00] Amen he comes in you and I to bring
[59:03] forth his nature that's right no more as
[59:06] I said than he sent a son to die in his
[59:08] place no he came
[59:10] himself the new birth is not another
[59:13] Spirit separate from God to come and
[59:15] live in you it's God's Own Spirit his
[59:19] own soul his own being the prophet would
[59:22] say in the form of the baptism of the
[59:25] Holy
[59:26] Ghost see to make us a child of
[59:29] God so it's not the father going off the
[59:33] scene adoption is the father coming on
[59:36] the scene in his
[59:39] son whe it would be where he was walking
[59:41] on the shores of Galilee himself in
[59:44] flesh or whether it be in his bride
[59:46] around the world we are his
[59:50] offspring we are God made manifest in
[59:53] another form called a bride or a wife
[59:56] you know see but we're him not another
[1:00:00] person he wasn't I like Brother Richard
[1:00:03] Wilson he's always said it his way said
[1:00:05] he wasn't a second person he wasn't a
[1:00:06] third person said he's quoting brother r
[1:00:08] that he's not even the first person see
[1:00:11] if he is the first person that could
[1:00:12] mean you had another person brother said
[1:00:15] he is the person well that's just old
[1:00:18] one this well I'll just stay with it so
[1:00:20] you go what you want to because I sure
[1:00:23] do really love it like it is all
[1:00:25] right but now
[1:00:30] listen the holy
[1:00:33] spirit is the spirit of
[1:00:35] God coming into you and I to bring a new
[1:00:38] birth and it is
[1:00:41] not another spirit that God is sending
[1:00:46] right because Jesus how long do we need
[1:00:49] to stay on Jesus said I and my father
[1:00:52] come to take up our abat in you right
[1:00:55] right that's right it's expedient that I
[1:00:58] go away cuz if I don't go away the
[1:01:00] comforter won't
[1:01:03] come all right see then we're sticking
[1:01:06] with the point of
[1:01:08] understanding understanding the the true
[1:01:11] revelation of one
[1:01:13] God but now
[1:01:16] watch as I said
[1:01:20] comparing the life of Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ with with the bride of Christ M
[1:01:27] and comparing that with the natural
[1:01:31] adoption that's what I'm trying to do
[1:01:33] cuz in the natural adoption they never
[1:01:35] went on to understand the Redemption of
[1:01:37] the body right they could just go from
[1:01:39] the the baby and the coming in the
[1:01:41] family and then the authority going with
[1:01:43] it it it doesn't go on you understand so
[1:01:46] when you're talking about comparing
[1:01:48] something like brother Brown said
[1:01:51] comparing the church ages with the seals
[1:01:54] M see you can't parallel the church ages
[1:01:57] and the
[1:01:58] seals CU if you do you only got four
[1:02:01] seals and Rapture is gone you you'd have
[1:02:03] to do you can't do it so you compare
[1:02:06] that's right compare means to put them
[1:02:08] side by side and look at this and look
[1:02:11] at that and see how they bringing forth
[1:02:14] you know something in
[1:02:16] similarity because I said Jesus didn't
[1:02:18] need the new
[1:02:21] birth but we must have it that's right
[1:02:25] see so that would be a different
[1:02:27] sentence but we're comparing
[1:02:29] it to understand and bring it down to
[1:02:32] that place that's right all right so
[1:02:35] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost being
[1:02:37] the spirit of
[1:02:38] God that is what brings us into the
[1:02:44] family the spirit of God brings us into
[1:02:46] the family placing into us the tutor the
[1:02:50] Holy Spirit which is the spirit of
[1:02:52] almighty God
[1:02:56] so brother says you have in you by the
[1:02:58] new birth father Son and Holy
[1:03:00] Ghost in the New Birth you said well I
[1:03:03] don't understand that well I don't
[1:03:04] either but I just say what the prophet
[1:03:06] said I do believe that much of it to
[1:03:09] where I can can say all right see then
[1:03:11] the spirit of adoption see as I said he
[1:03:15] saying to the
[1:03:17] Romans that you have the spirit of
[1:03:22] adoption whereby you're crying by father
[1:03:26] see not telling them I keep repeating
[1:03:29] that where you'll remember it not
[1:03:30] telling them because they were Natural
[1:03:33] Born
[1:03:34] Jews that they were already in the
[1:03:36] family of God because the New Testament
[1:03:40] is the family of God the Old Testament
[1:03:42] read your Bible they're always called
[1:03:45] servants you better go back and read
[1:03:47] your Bible a little bit they're always
[1:03:48] called servants they were the servants
[1:03:51] they were not the children of God you
[1:03:53] said they were the family of God well
[1:03:55] that's just as a church as an example as
[1:03:57] a
[1:03:58] type but they wouldn't in the family of
[1:04:00] God like we are
[1:04:02] are see then the spirit of adoption is
[1:04:06] this tutor coming to raise or teach us
[1:04:10] the nature of the father
[1:04:13] amen then the Holy Spirit couldn't be
[1:04:15] another
[1:04:17] person so you can't have the father and
[1:04:19] the Holy Ghost two different
[1:04:21] persons it's got to be the same person
[1:04:24] amen that's what that man told me down
[1:04:26] at work one day he said well I I I like
[1:04:28] the way you talk and everything what he
[1:04:30] was was a Mormon and excuse me Jehovah
[1:04:33] Witness and he uh he said uh I see now
[1:04:36] that really that you understand that
[1:04:38] there's just two of
[1:04:40] them I said
[1:04:42] well that's not exactly the way I see it
[1:04:45] but uh you did get rid of one of
[1:04:49] them yeah I said why don't you just get
[1:04:52] rid of one more and me you be talking
[1:04:54] you know cuz we we have't understand it
[1:04:56] but that was just my point all right
[1:05:00] now I I want to get this into you and
[1:05:04] forgive me for just being blunt and
[1:05:07] talking like I did Wednesday but when it
[1:05:09] bues on you you got to get rid of it so
[1:05:12] forgive me of just being
[1:05:14] plain I tried to explain something this
[1:05:17] past
[1:05:18] Wednesday and explaining that I told you
[1:05:21] to please listen to that tape over and
[1:05:23] over
[1:05:24] and to not make a decision in other
[1:05:26] words until you get to the end of the
[1:05:27] tape because the end of the tape I was
[1:05:30] explaining it that when we're born again
[1:05:34] we're
[1:05:35] babies I don't care how big you are how
[1:05:38] old you are how grown you are how much
[1:05:40] knowledge you got amen I've explained it
[1:05:42] to you I had a very very uh I guess
[1:05:46] decent amount of understanding of the
[1:05:48] Bible before I came into the message
[1:05:50] because that was what I done I read and
[1:05:52] studied it you know and all and and then
[1:05:55] 2 years into the message before I
[1:05:57] received the new birth and all I was
[1:05:59] doing was reading and studying the
[1:06:01] message of the hour but I didn't call
[1:06:03] that the new
[1:06:04] birth just because I left the Baptist
[1:06:07] Church and come into the message and and
[1:06:09] you know and believing brother random
[1:06:11] was a prophet I didn't call that the new
[1:06:13] birth because to me it was not I had I
[1:06:16] knew that that was not right all right
[1:06:19] but then I watched people all the way
[1:06:21] down through in my life and
[1:06:25] the way I see it most people are trying
[1:06:28] to bring and I'll get down in a minute
[1:06:30] to the quote they're trying to make some
[1:06:35] form of rule or doctrine or or what
[1:06:40] would you call it something of this
[1:06:42] message and and and each little group
[1:06:45] has its way of saying it you know and
[1:06:47] you just listen to them and and you'd be
[1:06:50] surprised you'll see that that there's
[1:06:52] people in this message that still
[1:06:53] believe that tongues is the
[1:06:56] evidence and then they'll turn around
[1:06:57] say well I I know brother Bram didn't
[1:06:59] say that now I know he didn't but I
[1:07:02] believe that I believe it you see and
[1:07:04] they still believe that all right
[1:07:07] because it's not been revealed to them
[1:07:10] what's going
[1:07:11] on but there's people that believe in
[1:07:14] the message see that if you just dress
[1:07:16] right live right and do right that
[1:07:18] you're ready to go out of this
[1:07:21] world well now there's people in this
[1:07:24] world that a whole lot better off than
[1:07:25] we are and live better and act better
[1:07:28] that's
[1:07:29] right and you can't argue that
[1:07:32] point all right there's good Catholics
[1:07:36] that live better lives than you and
[1:07:38] I right I don't mind talking that way
[1:07:42] because it's the
[1:07:44] truth well no no no brother well see
[1:07:47] that's where you you don't understand me
[1:07:49] but you see what I think most people
[1:07:51] think that that here we are and and what
[1:07:54] we need to do we need to preach on hir
[1:07:55] and dress and clothes
[1:07:57] and you know men this away and the women
[1:08:00] that away and get rid of this and get
[1:08:02] rid of that and oh we're ready well now
[1:08:05] I admit that that make good
[1:08:07] people I admit that I believe
[1:08:10] that yeah but brother BR said you
[1:08:13] sisters don't think cuz you got long
[1:08:15] hair and
[1:08:16] dresses that makes you
[1:08:20] right come
[1:08:22] on
[1:08:24] see if you're born
[1:08:26] again and then that comes forth that's
[1:08:29] right been
[1:08:32] wonderful wonderful see now you're right
[1:08:36] that's right but babies start off as
[1:08:40] babies looking around to see what other
[1:08:43] people are doing babies don't look at
[1:08:46] their own selves to see what they're
[1:08:47] doing they don't learn looking at
[1:08:49] theirself they don't stand in the mirror
[1:08:51] and flex their muscles as I said you
[1:08:53] know to try to do like uh Arnold swash
[1:08:56] ner orever you pronounce his name you
[1:08:58] know see they look at other
[1:09:01] people and they'll copy other
[1:09:04] people they watch other people but when
[1:09:07] you're born again you're baby in
[1:09:10] Christ and you watch what everybody's
[1:09:13] doing now you don't grow in Grace and
[1:09:16] knowledge and get where you can look
[1:09:17] over what people's doing I didn't teach
[1:09:19] that I Ain never taught
[1:09:22] it I've taught if you and I grow in
[1:09:24] Grace and knowledge we can get to the
[1:09:26] place to look over not to look over it
[1:09:29] cuz it's not right to go out and do
[1:09:32] wrong that's where you get misunderstood
[1:09:34] see somebody cut it off don't listen to
[1:09:36] what you're saying babies look at what
[1:09:39] people do and judge by what they
[1:09:43] do and you know in a way that's a good
[1:09:46] point and you know babies have a right
[1:09:48] to do
[1:09:51] that cuz I've always said it
[1:09:56] if I saw you slap your child for smoking
[1:09:59] a cigarette and you stand there smoking
[1:10:00] one I might just get a little bit my
[1:10:03] rightous indonation might get up a
[1:10:04] little bit and I might kick in the
[1:10:06] shin I'm just
[1:10:08] honest you say you get mad no I wouldn't
[1:10:11] get mad I just get even with you because
[1:10:12] there's no we need of acting like
[1:10:15] that you're supposed to live before your
[1:10:18] children the way you want your children
[1:10:20] to
[1:10:21] live and not whip them for doing
[1:10:24] something you're doing and say you ain't
[1:10:25] going to do what I done we'll quit doing
[1:10:27] what you
[1:10:30] done I never done my children that
[1:10:33] way never have and I never will to whip
[1:10:36] them for something that I'm doing
[1:10:39] myself but I wanted them to live right
[1:10:41] well you start living right yourself cuz
[1:10:44] they're watching you okay but now listen
[1:10:47] see in doing it I I know it gets to the
[1:10:49] point but the way I see most people
[1:10:51] preach about adoption I've listened to
[1:10:53] them what a little bit I could hear
[1:10:55] because most people don't deal with it
[1:10:57] but most of them think that if we could
[1:10:59] preach long enough on dresses and hiring
[1:11:02] clothes that people would get
[1:11:07] adopted but I don't believe that it's
[1:11:09] just like I've always told
[1:11:11] you I believe if there 7 billion people
[1:11:14] in the world today and if every person
[1:11:16] in the world had to baptism of the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost and was where the faith of the
[1:11:21] fathers was at they would still not be a
[1:11:24] change of the body whether you believe
[1:11:26] that or not it would be a good world to
[1:11:28] live in but it still wouldn't be the
[1:11:30] change of the body because it took the
[1:11:32] message or else why did the prophet
[1:11:34] bring it all right well the same way of
[1:11:37] what I'm talking
[1:11:39] about we can preach and we can preach
[1:11:42] about dos and don'ts and things and
[1:11:46] that's good there's people that's that's
[1:11:47] their point of preaching that's their
[1:11:49] doings you know but where will that ever
[1:11:52] bring us to the position
[1:11:55] to understand
[1:12:00] adoption it won't do it it's never done
[1:12:02] it
[1:12:04] yet all right and I wrote it down the
[1:12:06] best that I know how to write and I'm
[1:12:08] sorry see what I saw people do they try
[1:12:10] to beat the people into a place of try
[1:12:13] to beat the nature of the father into
[1:12:16] you now I don't believe in
[1:12:19] that I don't believe in it natural I
[1:12:22] don't believe in beating a nature of a
[1:12:23] father into a child I believe in
[1:12:26] whipping the child yes
[1:12:28] sir and I believe you're wrong if you
[1:12:31] don't see that's just the way I am not
[1:12:35] kill
[1:12:37] them get you good little hick and spank
[1:12:39] them and they they'll understand and
[1:12:41] that tries to help them make their
[1:12:43] nature right but that ain't going to
[1:12:45] beat your nature into
[1:12:47] it you better remember one thing your
[1:12:50] nature is displayed as I kept saying
[1:12:52] over and over daily before them if you
[1:12:54] want your children to act like you act
[1:12:56] like you're supposed to
[1:12:57] act is that plain enough everybody
[1:13:01] understand what I
[1:13:02] mean you live before them the way you
[1:13:04] want them to live then you can say well
[1:13:07] a child is acting just like the father
[1:13:08] or the mother see and that's wonderful
[1:13:11] all right but you can't beat it into and
[1:13:14] you can't beat the nature of God into
[1:13:17] anyone you know if you know I'm not
[1:13:21] talking about a stick beating I'm
[1:13:23] talking about taking doctrines and ideas
[1:13:26] and Concepts about clothes and hiring
[1:13:29] and dresses and stuff like that and just
[1:13:31] preach that preach that just preach that
[1:13:33] just preach that just preach well when
[1:13:34] they get lined up that we'll preach the
[1:13:36] Deep things but we got stay away from
[1:13:37] them deep
[1:13:39] things but see you can't beat the nature
[1:13:43] of the father into the
[1:13:47] children all
[1:13:49] right but why not do what the prophet as
[1:13:52] said had to do took him 30 something
[1:13:54] years to preach the statue of perfect
[1:13:57] man now did he just ever service from
[1:14:00] then on and I'm making a point so listen
[1:14:03] did he ever service from then on just
[1:14:05] preach we need this we need that we got
[1:14:07] to have this we got to have that we got
[1:14:09] to have this we got to have that was
[1:14:11] that his message no he went on to
[1:14:16] preach the doctrines of the Bible
[1:14:21] right the truth
[1:14:23] of the Bible not man's doctrines we've
[1:14:26] done confused it enough like it was I
[1:14:29] ain't talking about that I'm talking
[1:14:31] about he started preaching the word cuz
[1:14:34] he knew that only through the revealed
[1:14:36] word would we be able to ever attain
[1:14:38] unto anything right right that's all I'm
[1:14:42] trying to get you to
[1:14:44] see see why not preach the
[1:14:47] word bless God we preach
[1:14:49] it yeah that's about like that old man
[1:14:52] was that said you know
[1:14:53] said they said something to him saidwell
[1:14:56] why don't you preach on something
[1:14:57] besides acts 238 you know repent every
[1:14:59] want to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:15:00] Christ in wrong he said well give me a
[1:15:02] scripture so man told him okay here it
[1:15:04] is John the Baptist standing down
[1:15:06] there and he had axe in his
[1:15:09] hand he said well that's wonderful a
[1:15:12] brother wants me to preach on that said
[1:15:13] I can do it said because John was
[1:15:15] standing down there with an axe in his
[1:15:17] hand now why did he have that ax in his
[1:15:21] hand only reason I know he had that a in
[1:15:24] his hands where he could cut away out
[1:15:25] into the into the river where he could
[1:15:27] baptize him in the name of the Lord
[1:15:28] Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ see he couldn't get away that's
[1:15:32] all he could preach with acts 238 there
[1:15:34] was a time for that there was a
[1:15:35] dispensation for those things there's a
[1:15:38] dispensation of where you're learning of
[1:15:39] the message there's a dispensation of
[1:15:41] all kind of things and a time for that
[1:15:44] but now listen but see most ministers
[1:15:47] try to make you live up to a certain set
[1:15:50] of codes or doctrines yes instead of
[1:15:52] preaching the word of
[1:15:54] God all right now let's see what the
[1:15:57] prophet said let's see if that's what he
[1:16:00] said
[1:16:01] okay the message called us riseing of
[1:16:04] the sun
[1:16:05] 1965 4:18 the morning
[1:16:09] service page 11 look what he said I'm
[1:16:17] FR okay let's read now the very essence
[1:16:19] of the message that was sent that he is
[1:16:21] risen from the dead we his beneficiaries
[1:16:24] we who share the resurrection with him
[1:16:26] draw benefits from this by proving to
[1:16:28] the world that He Is Alive we cannot do
[1:16:31] it by word only we cannot do it by some
[1:16:34] tradition of man we only reflect exactly
[1:16:37] what we're pointing
[1:16:39] to I'm afraid today that too many of us
[1:16:42] are not getting now he didn't leave his
[1:16:45] out so you do what you want to with it
[1:16:47] oh he was just trying to be humble okay
[1:16:49] he's
[1:16:50] humble I'm afraid today that too many of
[1:16:52] us us are not getting people to Christ
[1:16:55] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:16:57] theory but we must get them to Christ he
[1:17:00] is the only one and the only one that
[1:17:03] has
[1:17:04] life all right so we're not getting the
[1:17:07] people to
[1:17:11] Christ we're getting them to a Doctrine
[1:17:14] an idea or a thought or a concept it
[1:17:16] goes on down to number two power of
[1:17:18] decisions 3 55
[1:17:21] 10:07 and then that one where he's uh
[1:17:25] explaining about to people being just
[1:17:26] hungry licking your lips a different
[1:17:28] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:17:30] today it's anemia I guess I pronounce
[1:17:33] that
[1:17:34] correctly which means you're you know
[1:17:37] you need something to
[1:17:39] eat because they're not getting enough
[1:17:42] spiritual
[1:17:43] food if they got the Bible brother it
[1:17:47] would put the blood of Christ into the
[1:17:49] veins of the believer new life life
[1:17:52] comes from the blood amen the anemia
[1:17:54] condition of the church pitiful pale fa
[1:17:57] pale cheek my mind we need a transfusion
[1:18:00] to start us off amen all right now what
[1:18:05] do we need to work okay going beyond the
[1:18:09] camp 1964 30719 the evening service more
[1:18:13] and more I am made to believe that
[1:18:16] people are not getting to
[1:18:18] Christ now I'm here to try to help in
[1:18:21] every way that I can and make my
[1:18:23] statement as clear as I know how to make
[1:18:26] them and you suffer with me if you will
[1:18:29] as I look and preach Across the Nation
[1:18:31] and watch the
[1:18:33] people I I I'm fully persuaded that the
[1:18:35] people are not getting to Christ I
[1:18:38] believe that it's the enemy that
[1:18:41] stroe this
[1:18:43] hindrance because the reason I believe
[1:18:46] this he is not the object that they had
[1:18:49] been pointed to now that means Christ
[1:18:53] that's Jesus not Satan all right they
[1:18:56] have either been pointed to a Dogma or
[1:18:58] doctrine or a party or experience or
[1:19:00] sensation or something like that instead
[1:19:02] of being pointed to Christ to work
[1:19:04] that's why I think that people are
[1:19:05] resting their Eternal destination upon
[1:19:08] some Dogma or some sensation like some
[1:19:11] say I danced in the spirit or I spoke
[1:19:13] with tongues I I I felt fire run over me
[1:19:17] and do you know that all those things
[1:19:19] can be impersonated by the devil there
[1:19:21] just one thing that he cannot
[1:19:23] impersonate that's the
[1:19:27] word
[1:19:30] now what is he
[1:19:32] saying we're not getting the people to
[1:19:36] Christ Christ is the revealed
[1:19:39] word
[1:19:41] okay Christ is the revealed word amen
[1:19:45] see the letter of the word is not
[1:19:48] Christ Christ is the revealed word all
[1:19:51] right so now keep keep that in mind of
[1:19:53] what he's saying and he's saying we're
[1:19:55] not getting them to Christ we're getting
[1:19:57] them to some sensation some thoughts or
[1:20:00] ideas all right now if your dependence
[1:20:04] this day is upon the fact that you
[1:20:06] shouted spoke in tongues cried whatever
[1:20:09] You' done the prophet read these points
[1:20:10] you read them over if you're dependent
[1:20:13] upon that to say you have the new birth
[1:20:15] Satan can impersonate all of
[1:20:18] it
[1:20:20] okay well you're destroying my own I'm
[1:20:23] not destroying anything cuz I've never
[1:20:24] told you not to believe that I believe a
[1:20:27] lot of people receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:28] they spoke in Tong I believe a lot of
[1:20:30] people receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:31] shouted I believe a lot of them cried I
[1:20:33] believe a lot of them this that and the
[1:20:35] other I believe in that but I don't
[1:20:37] believe that the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:39] Ghost just speaking in tongues shouting
[1:20:41] and whatever you're doing that's like
[1:20:43] the baby get the baby here first and
[1:20:45] then the baby
[1:20:47] cries the birth of the baby is one stage
[1:20:51] the next stage is the cist of effect but
[1:20:54] if your dependence is totally upon some
[1:20:57] sensation Satan can
[1:21:01] impersonate all right see and I wish to
[1:21:04] God I've always told you this you say
[1:21:06] but brother Dale you'll empty the church
[1:21:08] preaching that people needs to be born
[1:21:10] again well if I do then they know what
[1:21:12] it means they're not born again that's
[1:21:14] problem solved stage one but
[1:21:20] listen see I believe the new birth is is
[1:21:22] the birth of the
[1:21:25] word but then the sensations and the
[1:21:28] feelings and the signs the Wonders and
[1:21:29] the things you're doing to what you're
[1:21:31] saying that's what follows after the
[1:21:34] birth of the word
[1:21:36] right but you see a person that's living
[1:21:39] like the devil and then they claim these
[1:21:41] experiences and then they go on living
[1:21:43] like the
[1:21:44] devil there's something
[1:21:47] wrong get the baby changed you know word
[1:21:51] and then start on those
[1:21:54] things but brother I believe the message
[1:21:57] well
[1:22:02] amen but don't you think that the devil
[1:22:04] believes the message yes does that mean
[1:22:07] he's born again no
[1:22:10] see no that's that that that doesn't
[1:22:13] make it see we've got to have more than
[1:22:17] just some sensation or point or thought
[1:22:20] that's right we got to have the birth of
[1:22:22] the word right to be a child of God all
[1:22:25] right he said but I'm fully persuaded
[1:22:28] we're not getting them to
[1:22:31] Christ
[1:22:33] now but what are we getting them
[1:22:36] to I gave you there one on door and door
[1:22:39] is that the world will be judged by
[1:22:42] Christ and he's the
[1:22:46] word now the world won't be
[1:22:49] judged by a strong I mean a a Thompson
[1:22:53] Chain uh uh
[1:22:57] Scofield that's not exactly the way I
[1:23:00] look at
[1:23:01] it it's going to be judged by the word
[1:23:04] and Christ is the
[1:23:05] word I thought we believe that we would
[1:23:08] sit there with him and would judge the
[1:23:10] people that come forth yes I thought the
[1:23:13] bride would be sitting with him in
[1:23:15] judgment and see then a person can't
[1:23:17] deny you know anything because you're
[1:23:20] sitting there right
[1:23:23] and Flash in their mind has to would
[1:23:25] come back to the point to where you
[1:23:26] tried to help them and explain it to
[1:23:29] them all right and then they can't argue
[1:23:32] the point because there is the Living
[1:23:37] Word all right now brother brandom I
[1:23:40] believe is saying
[1:23:41] what we're not getting them to the alive
[1:23:46] person of the word which is
[1:23:51] Christ
[1:23:53] but the letter of the word as I've
[1:23:54] always told you has to be
[1:23:56] correct that was why the prophet had to
[1:24:00] come to bring us to that
[1:24:03] place all right
[1:24:07] see but now see people must be fed the
[1:24:12] word not the ideas of
[1:24:16] mankind because ideas of mankind only
[1:24:19] produce more ideas of mankind that's
[1:24:21] right all I don't like that today you
[1:24:23] know they'll say I know what's meant by
[1:24:25] it I know it but you know they'll say
[1:24:27] what's your input on this well I don't
[1:24:30] have no
[1:24:31] input input means I'm putting something
[1:24:35] in and I didn't think we're supposed to
[1:24:37] put anything in I thought we were
[1:24:38] supposed to draw out the word from God I
[1:24:42] didn't think he needed us to interpret
[1:24:44] or do anything he just needed us to stay
[1:24:46] with what he said that's right and
[1:24:47] believe it all right but you
[1:24:50] see it's going to be judged by Christ
[1:24:53] who is the
[1:24:54] word the alive word is what's going to
[1:24:57] judge
[1:24:58] people so then that's what we are
[1:25:02] here as the children of God we are the
[1:25:04] live word
[1:25:06] see but now see we we try to make some
[1:25:10] idea or some
[1:25:12] thought and and forgive me but I listen
[1:25:16] to people and I hear them you know and I
[1:25:18] I hear them never mention the the
[1:25:20] revelation of the word but oh yes they
[1:25:23] read the word yes they read the quotes
[1:25:25] yes they read the things of the
[1:25:27] Prophet but where are they talking about
[1:25:29] the word Made Alive in you where they're
[1:25:32] talking about God coming down and
[1:25:33] changing your
[1:25:39] nature I thought we supposed to have a
[1:25:41] nature change and I thought then even
[1:25:43] that after the New Birth that that was
[1:25:45] what we would to receive a total nature
[1:25:48] change that there was still something
[1:25:50] from things wrong with us that we needed
[1:25:52] to the statue of a perfect man we need
[1:25:54] the adoption but to do that we must have
[1:25:57] the revealed
[1:25:59] word all right but you
[1:26:06] see you
[1:26:08] take and forgive
[1:26:11] me but you see why in the message that
[1:26:14] you see people constantly changing
[1:26:16] churches and I'm not against you
[1:26:19] changing churches and coming here and
[1:26:21] I'm not not against you changing
[1:26:23] churches if you leave and go somewhere
[1:26:24] else I've explained that to you the only
[1:26:27] thing I ask you to do if you find more
[1:26:29] word somewhere else please come back and
[1:26:31] give us some contact with us you know at
[1:26:32] least make contact where we can can go
[1:26:34] with you or do something you know cuz I
[1:26:37] I I I want the
[1:26:39] word but you see that's why people are
[1:26:41] constantly changing it's just like you
[1:26:43] take a you notice a
[1:26:46] cow and you see a cow out and a pasture
[1:26:50] you know if they Knee Deep Grace you
[1:26:52] know never see around at the side of the
[1:26:53] fence with their head stuck out on the
[1:26:55] side of the road trying to eat the G
[1:26:59] right no am I
[1:27:03] right but if you see the pyer to where
[1:27:05] there's nothing in it old rack weeds and
[1:27:08] stuff growing up and bitter weeds and
[1:27:10] things you see the cows sticking their
[1:27:12] head through the fence
[1:27:16] right all right am I right now but if a
[1:27:19] beautiful P out there it's fertilized
[1:27:21] field and everything you on that's all
[1:27:23] growing they're not around the
[1:27:27] fence now you understand what I
[1:27:30] mean if people are fed the
[1:27:33] word they're not out hunting for the
[1:27:35] word they're not sticking their head
[1:27:37] through the
[1:27:38] fence but if you don't have enough for
[1:27:41] people to
[1:27:45] eat then they're going to stick their
[1:27:47] head to the
[1:27:48] fence and that's what I I kind of
[1:27:51] believe preacher are that they're afraid
[1:27:53] to let somebody else come in and preach
[1:27:54] cuz they might preach two bailes a Hy
[1:27:56] when they ain't never preach one to them
[1:27:58] themselves now you know what those
[1:28:00] carnal illustrations mean don't you they
[1:28:03] just preach little sugar tit things and
[1:28:05] little small thing line up and get your
[1:28:06] clothes right and somebody comes in and
[1:28:08] just takes and man that you know just
[1:28:10] takes and just dumps a whole load on you
[1:28:13] and man you just find out that there all
[1:28:15] kind of grains and wheed and corn and
[1:28:20] all that you can just eat e and just you
[1:28:25] know well no wonder
[1:28:28] the cattle want to leave and go
[1:28:30] somewhere El where they get something to
[1:28:33] eat all right why because you you get a
[1:28:36] little taste of it that's what the
[1:28:37] preachers are afraid
[1:28:39] of they're afraid to let somebody come
[1:28:41] in cuz they're afraid they'll lose a
[1:28:43] bunch of
[1:28:46] people you know that's true so there's
[1:28:48] no need of arguing with it it's not a
[1:28:49] point to argue see but now
[1:28:55] listen as a majority I just wrote it
[1:28:58] this way so I read it as a
[1:29:01] majority around the message most of the
[1:29:04] ministers are not trying to hand out
[1:29:06] spiritual food they're trying to build
[1:29:08] churches they're trying to build
[1:29:10] programs they're trying to do things and
[1:29:12] that's their
[1:29:13] business we don't have nothing to do
[1:29:15] with
[1:29:16] it all right and in doing that see
[1:29:20] they're not feeding their
[1:29:22] people and you see a lot of them running
[1:29:25] about the
[1:29:26] country and become evangelist on the
[1:29:28] field you know and going off and
[1:29:29] preaching and and they lose a lot of
[1:29:31] people because of that well see but then
[1:29:35] some of the one of the people two or
[1:29:36] three of them will come back and they
[1:29:37] really just Rejoice because you know
[1:29:40] they they think well they finally
[1:29:41] learned their lesson you know and I'm
[1:29:42] right anyway but that's nothing to
[1:29:45] me ain't going to help me one bit I'm
[1:29:49] just making a point do you believe you
[1:29:52] know the point's right words you know
[1:29:53] the point right I'm just making the
[1:29:56] point see all
[1:29:59] right but when you see somebody that has
[1:30:02] really tried to
[1:30:03] preach or to keep a you
[1:30:07] know keep the pyer up in real good shape
[1:30:09] to where the cattle can have plenty of
[1:30:11] food plenty of water you
[1:30:14] know you don't have much trouble of
[1:30:16] people running around we've had very
[1:30:17] little problems of people leaving for
[1:30:19] other things and you know
[1:30:22] some have left and and all like that but
[1:30:24] neither one of them will come back and
[1:30:26] say it was because of the word because
[1:30:28] everybody says little ain't nothing but
[1:30:30] word word word word word well that's
[1:30:31] thank God for that that's all I've ever
[1:30:33] believed that it's word word word but I
[1:30:35] want it
[1:30:37] revealed but we got to get it planted in
[1:30:39] the field that's
[1:30:41] right all right
[1:30:45] now but see that's why I've tried my
[1:30:47] best to preach to you the
[1:30:49] message and not just preach every
[1:30:52] service you know in clothes and dress
[1:30:53] and hiring cuz I seen years ago that
[1:30:56] that wouldn't do it I told you I asked
[1:30:57] brother Mo when he preached the statue
[1:30:58] of perfect man I asked him I said okay
[1:31:01] now how do we get these
[1:31:02] things and see the Lord spoke to me
[1:31:04] later and said by the opening of the
[1:31:07] word and I gave it back to you at the
[1:31:09] end of the message the prophet said with
[1:31:11] the restoration of the word will come
[1:31:13] restoration of power all right but I
[1:31:16] believe with that word being
[1:31:17] revealed is what we're to feed on and
[1:31:20] that's what we've been doing for 4
[1:31:22] something
[1:31:23] years all right now think about
[1:31:26] it see we say but we preached one God we
[1:31:30] preach uh serpent seed we preach
[1:31:32] predestination we preached adoption but
[1:31:34] you know if if you're just just think
[1:31:36] with me just a simple illustration
[1:31:40] right I wouldn't ask for a raise of
[1:31:42] hands but how many maybe in adoption the
[1:31:45] series just learn something you didn't
[1:31:47] know
[1:31:49] before you know something was revealed
[1:31:51] to to you of the one God the water
[1:31:55] baptism he realized it couldn't happen
[1:31:57] before
[1:32:00] now come on I thought we believe
[1:32:03] predestination I thought you was
[1:32:05] listening when Brother D was preaching
[1:32:06] when I said the word is what comes
[1:32:08] predestinated eternally and there's a
[1:32:10] word for this age right brother Gary so
[1:32:12] if there's a word for this age and that
[1:32:14] word ain't been reveal to Brother Gary
[1:32:17] then we can't leave that's right amen
[1:32:23] but get the point of what I'm
[1:32:25] saying you do at least say God has
[1:32:27] revealed something to you recently right
[1:32:31] all right see then if he's revealed
[1:32:33] something to you recently not maybe me
[1:32:35] preaching or anybody whatever just God
[1:32:37] revealed you know that the time couldn't
[1:32:39] take place cuz there was a dispensation
[1:32:41] that was waiting for that to take
[1:32:45] place and if there's more to be revealed
[1:32:49] there's more word to be made alive right
[1:32:52] then the change won't come until the
[1:32:54] word is completely finished that's to be
[1:32:55] made alive there's their their
[1:32:59] thing it's the preaching of the word
[1:33:01] that's supposed to bring us up the
[1:33:03] stature of a perfect man it's the
[1:33:04] preaching of the word that's supposed to
[1:33:06] bring the nature of the father because I
[1:33:08] thought I gave you a quote in there were
[1:33:09] that that that Jesus I mean that God was
[1:33:13] his
[1:33:16] word now if he's his
[1:33:18] word then that's what I want reveal amen
[1:33:24] yeah and if there's something to be
[1:33:26] revealed to
[1:33:28] us then it won't take place until that's
[1:33:31] finished being
[1:33:33] revealed is that that
[1:33:36] sensible you you shouldn't need anything
[1:33:39] to help you understand
[1:33:44] that but you know yourself that I
[1:33:46] brought in a people brought in people to
[1:33:48] try to help you understand instead of
[1:33:49] trying to keep them away cuz I want you
[1:33:52] to understand and I know and realize
[1:33:54] sometimes that I I'm one that knows for
[1:33:56] certain that brother Dale's not all of
[1:33:57] the fivefold
[1:34:00] ministry I know that for certainty I
[1:34:02] believe in a fful Ministry and I tried
[1:34:04] to bring men to help
[1:34:06] you and to help me because you know I
[1:34:09] learn and I go listen to the five4
[1:34:11] ministry cuz remember that's that's what
[1:34:13] we're to do all right but not just pound
[1:34:16] people about something but preach the
[1:34:20] gospel
[1:34:22] the scripture says the gospel is
[1:34:24] what the power of God unto
[1:34:31] salvation is that
[1:34:33] scripture the gospel is the power of God
[1:34:36] under
[1:34:37] salvation well then why have we not
[1:34:40] tried to preach the
[1:34:44] gospel of course everybody says they
[1:34:47] have
[1:34:49] right all that those that just still
[1:34:51] preaching 40 years ago they preaching
[1:34:53] high and dress and clothes they still
[1:34:54] preaching high and dress and
[1:35:00] clothes they say they're preaching the
[1:35:03] gospel well why didn't brother Ram was I
[1:35:05] said why didn't he just stop on the
[1:35:06] Statue of perfect man and just stay
[1:35:08] there preaching the statute of perfect
[1:35:10] man over and over for the next three and
[1:35:11] a half
[1:35:12] years or 3 years somewhere the
[1:35:16] life no he went on into the preaching of
[1:35:18] the
[1:35:19] word because he saw and real realiz the
[1:35:22] only
[1:35:25] way that we would be able to come to it
[1:35:28] would be what as he said this messenger
[1:35:31] Malachi Force to do two things what turn
[1:35:33] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:35:34] faith of the fathers number one right he
[1:35:37] said and bring us the Revelation the
[1:35:39] seven the Thunders which is revelation
[1:35:41] containing the Seven Seals and these
[1:35:43] would be the things that would literally
[1:35:45] turn our hearts back so he knew had to
[1:35:47] go on preaching it and bring the message
[1:35:49] to us right see and that's all I've
[1:35:53] tried to do see not pound on you but try
[1:35:56] to preach unto
[1:35:58] you cuz preaching unto you the nature of
[1:36:01] the Father by the revealed word will
[1:36:03] bring the nature of the father in you
[1:36:04] when it's revealed to
[1:36:06] you because it's not going to do it for
[1:36:09] for pounding it's not going to take
[1:36:11] place that
[1:36:12] way all
[1:36:14] right you said well brother D give me
[1:36:16] scripture for that give me scripture for
[1:36:19] the fact that you believe that that
[1:36:21] through the opening of the word will
[1:36:23] bring these things to P well okay then
[1:36:25] if you look over in Romans 10 you'll
[1:36:27] find the scripture says what
[1:36:29] 1017 Faith cometh by
[1:36:33] hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:36:39] God and we know the scripture said that
[1:36:42] is revealed from what faith to
[1:36:45] Faith see all
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:52] then listen then if you believe that we
[1:36:56] become a child of God by the revealing
[1:36:58] of the word which is what brother Bron
[1:37:00] said on number five on your notes there
[1:37:02] a paragraph 71 patus Vision 1960 1204
[1:37:06] the evening says you're saved by
[1:37:08] Revelation and says the only way you can
[1:37:10] be saved is by
[1:37:12] Revelation he said other than that you
[1:37:14] got an intellectual see so if you can't
[1:37:17] be saved only by revelation of the word
[1:37:19] of God then you see why I believe and I
[1:37:23] believe that is true see then you see
[1:37:25] why did I believe that a child can only
[1:37:27] grow into the nature or a character of
[1:37:30] the Father by the revealing of the
[1:37:32] nature of the Father by the revealed
[1:37:36] word I believe that's what's taking
[1:37:39] place I believe the seals the things
[1:37:42] like that is revealing the nature of the
[1:37:45] father
[1:37:48] amen unto us by the revealed word
[1:37:52] we see people are say but brother Dale
[1:37:54] we preach these things well all right
[1:37:57] but is it fully
[1:38:02] revealed Has It produced the nature of
[1:38:04] the father
[1:38:07] right that's just as plain as it can
[1:38:10] be could it be we've tried to preach our
[1:38:12] own ideas about these things and call it
[1:38:20] revelation
[1:38:23] you said but I don't believe I don't
[1:38:24] believe Brother D preaching them deep
[1:38:26] things you get all confused and you
[1:38:28] confused to people
[1:38:31] no the people are already
[1:38:34] confused you're not going to get
[1:38:36] confused reading the word of Goden
[1:38:39] you're not going to get confused
[1:38:40] studying this message you're not going
[1:38:43] to get confused hearing somebody
[1:38:45] preacher the deeper things of the
[1:38:46] message you are already
[1:38:49] confused it's exposed our
[1:38:54] confusion all
[1:38:59] right I gave you some quotes where
[1:39:01] brother Brown said you must be born
[1:39:02] again he said it's not Sensations and
[1:39:05] things like that but you must be borned
[1:39:08] by the
[1:39:12] word born by the
[1:39:14] word
[1:39:16] conflict 1962 3 531 number8 on you know
[1:39:20] you mourn by the word read these real
[1:39:25] good and listen to what your Prophet has
[1:39:27] to
[1:39:34] say do you see what I'm trying to get
[1:39:36] you to see now I'm asking you do you see
[1:39:38] what I'm trying to get you to see I'm
[1:39:39] not asking you to believe me I never
[1:39:40] have asked you to do
[1:39:42] that see if we teach the word of God to
[1:39:45] the people then the Holy Spirit can make
[1:39:48] it alive that's right right now up to
[1:39:51] the 5old ministry now did your Prophet
[1:39:53] make these statements he said I break
[1:39:55] these down as big nuggets he said it's
[1:39:58] up to the 5old ministry to break it down
[1:40:00] to where it can be explained to the
[1:40:02] people now I didn't make them statements
[1:40:03] your Prophet made
[1:40:05] it right but see the Bible says the
[1:40:08] fivefold ministry is for the perfecting
[1:40:09] of the Saints until we all come to the
[1:40:12] unity of the faith right now so then we
[1:40:16] must have a five-fold Ministry well
[1:40:18] brother Dale what about these people see
[1:40:19] everybody wants to make an excuse what
[1:40:21] about these people that where they can't
[1:40:23] get to a preacher
[1:40:26] well you got a problem
[1:40:29] now cuz you can get an
[1:40:34] internet few years ago may have been a
[1:40:39] problem the God just takes them out of
[1:40:43] the way with what's cost you know
[1:40:46] science and and new things and he just
[1:40:49] brings things to where you can just turn
[1:40:51] on a computer and you can just listen to
[1:40:56] people right so there's no excuse
[1:41:01] now well we just can't get together
[1:41:03] where you know it's too far yeah and you
[1:41:06] got $100,000 laying in the bank account
[1:41:08] that that the world's going to fix to
[1:41:10] take away from you but you ain't going
[1:41:11] to spend it going to
[1:41:17] church that's all right no my business I
[1:41:20] ain't never asked for nobody no
[1:41:24] money people are surprised when they do
[1:41:26] on the internet and come back to us and
[1:41:27] we say no
[1:41:30] charge yeah but we want to do no
[1:41:33] charge why cuz we're not trying to get
[1:41:36] rich we're trying to spread the gospel
[1:41:39] and you know the reason why I told you
[1:41:41] here a while back we're trying to spread
[1:41:42] it because these preachers ain't going
[1:41:43] to preach it so I just opened up said
[1:41:45] okay loosen it up Let It Go on the
[1:41:46] internet then who wants to hear can
[1:41:49] hear call me in you want
[1:41:52] to but there's a lot of people listening
[1:41:55] today around the
[1:41:58] world and I hope that it's helping them
[1:42:02] and I've never asked one of them for a
[1:42:03] dime and never have told none of them to
[1:42:05] call me their
[1:42:06] Pastor I always direct them back to
[1:42:09] their
[1:42:10] pastor but you know what brother Brown
[1:42:13] said he said if your pastor won't preach
[1:42:15] the truth what' he say
[1:42:18] do now what' he say do come on somebody
[1:42:21] tell me what brother R said do said get
[1:42:24] away from him thank you so you know he
[1:42:28] said
[1:42:29] it well you're just trying to bust up
[1:42:33] churches I'm trying to get the word
[1:42:36] out all I've ever tried to
[1:42:39] do see because we have the inside
[1:42:43] teacher but brother Ram says that the
[1:42:46] holy spirit is sitting in you waiting on
[1:42:49] you to bring him the
[1:42:53] word well I thought he know the word see
[1:42:56] that's where you don't understand you
[1:42:57] ain't been taught for 40 years of truth
[1:43:00] of understanding you're still thinking
[1:43:02] well I thought he the Holy Ghost knows
[1:43:06] everything we don't need no teachers
[1:43:08] called got teacher inside of
[1:43:10] us the prophet said why did he put
[1:43:12] teachers in the body that's right now I
[1:43:15] wrote it like
[1:43:19] this
[1:43:22] brother brandom
[1:43:24] said on the message Ephesians parallels
[1:43:28] Joshua you've heard that over and over
[1:43:30] and over that's 196 5:15 the evening
[1:43:33] service where you'll know what it
[1:43:37] is number 10 on your
[1:43:43] notes he said preaching catches The
[1:43:46] Sinner now
[1:43:48] listen but he said teaching positionally
[1:43:51] places you in the
[1:43:52] body
[1:43:54] okay of course the teacher he wants to
[1:43:57] strut right there don't
[1:43:59] he but I'm going to just clip the strut
[1:44:01] out and under
[1:44:04] you cuz I don't believe it you call me a
[1:44:08] teacher I don't believe that I'm the
[1:44:10] only one that can teach I believe the
[1:44:12] fivefold
[1:44:13] ministry fivefold Ministry that is
[1:44:15] called of God all right everybody know
[1:44:19] what I'm saying the true fful ministry
[1:44:22] that's called of God each one of them is
[1:44:24] capable of teaching in the capacity of
[1:44:27] their
[1:44:28] office so brother random didn't label
[1:44:31] just the teacher
[1:44:32] here he didn't say just that read what
[1:44:36] he
[1:44:37] saying he said teaching positionally
[1:44:40] placed it he didn't say the teacher
[1:44:41] positionally placed
[1:44:44] you he said
[1:44:47] teaching positionally places you right
[1:44:51] he didn't label it down to hear in one
[1:44:55] person it's a five-fold Ministry and
[1:44:58] each one is supposed to be able to teach
[1:44:59] in the capacity that they're
[1:45:03] in so teaching positionally places you
[1:45:06] whether you're sitting under a pastor
[1:45:07] today and that Pastor is teaching you
[1:45:09] the word then you're exactly right in
[1:45:12] what the prophet said
[1:45:16] amen but then there is a teachers that
[1:45:18] are in the body of Christ that
[1:45:21] you
[1:45:23] know that the prophet said nobody can
[1:45:25] touch the teacher now he did label
[1:45:30] that did he say those things nobody can
[1:45:34] touch the teacher now he put it there he
[1:45:36] didn't say nobody can touch the
[1:45:38] teaching but here he's saying nobody can
[1:45:40] that the the teaching of the word is
[1:45:43] what positionally places you and I so
[1:45:45] the five-fold ministry is called for the
[1:45:47] perfecting of the Saints according to
[1:45:49] the scripture until we come to the UN of
[1:45:50] the faith that's why I believe in the
[1:45:52] five4
[1:45:54] ministry that's why I bring in people to
[1:45:57] try to help you the five4
[1:46:00] ministry because I know as I said I know
[1:46:02] and realize that I can't do it all by
[1:46:04] myself and it can't be
[1:46:08] done so you bring in somebody to try to
[1:46:10] get somebody to
[1:46:13] hell because that'll bring you to the
[1:46:19] place
[1:46:21] and we'll go with one that he did
[1:46:23] say the last one I gave
[1:46:26] you you looked at the last one to gave
[1:46:31] you I didn't say
[1:46:35] this he said you'll never live no higher
[1:46:38] than your
[1:46:43] pastor he said you'll never live no
[1:46:45] higher than your
[1:46:47] pastor well brother D this means we got
[1:46:50] to depend on yeah that's exactly right
[1:46:52] that means we got to depend on somebody
[1:46:54] but you know this is one Pastor that
[1:46:57] knows he's got to depend upon the other
[1:46:59] fivefold
[1:47:02] Ministry I've got to hear Faith don't
[1:47:05] come by
[1:47:06] reading Faith cometh by
[1:47:09] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:47:13] in other words a prophet would say
[1:47:14] hearing then by the revealed word that
[1:47:17] some preacher stands forth and preaches
[1:47:19] unto you
[1:47:23] all right so I believe that was placed
[1:47:24] correctly I don't know what you think
[1:47:26] about it
[1:47:27] but it's teaching that positionally
[1:47:30] places you
[1:47:32] yes not the
[1:47:35] teacher but then to reject the teacher
[1:47:37] is what's wrong with a lot of people
[1:47:39] that they can't teach themselves
[1:47:43] simple that ain't going to get me no
[1:47:45] opportunities to go anywhere and preach
[1:47:47] and I'm not going to do
[1:47:49] it
[1:47:50] I don't worry
[1:47:52] me that's why I opened up the internet
[1:47:55] because I've told you before see I
[1:47:56] thought Wade would be able to go I
[1:47:58] thought these other ministers would be
[1:47:59] able to carry the
[1:48:02] message cuz I realized what they were
[1:48:05] thinking about me
[1:48:06] intellectual all this that and the other
[1:48:09] but that's their business I don't I
[1:48:11] don't get offended at anybody because of
[1:48:15] that I thought W could go and carry the
[1:48:17] message but See's not much popular More
[1:48:20] than I am
[1:48:24] but because I've never taught you
[1:48:26] anything like
[1:48:28] that I've tried my best and you come and
[1:48:30] show me where I've missed
[1:48:33] it you come show me where I've ever
[1:48:35] taught anything to Prophet didn't
[1:48:37] teach that's an open challenge to the
[1:48:41] world that's why we haven't got into all
[1:48:44] these doctrines of Two Souls seventh
[1:48:46] thund virtues perusia the river Jordans
[1:48:49] the no Holy Ghost doctrines of son of
[1:48:52] mans and all of these other
[1:48:54] things because we just simply just tried
[1:48:57] to cluck alone here and the five-fold
[1:48:59] ministry here has been a wonderful help
[1:49:01] to me you know the ministers here to
[1:49:04] help me to understand and help preach to
[1:49:06] me you know and I thank God for
[1:49:10] them you
[1:49:12] know cuz they've been a help to me and
[1:49:14] that's what I depend
[1:49:18] on but see I don't believe that that
[1:49:21] preaching this this little things is
[1:49:24] going to bring the bride to Perfection
[1:49:25] let's stand come on brother mus this
[1:49:28] it's not going to do
[1:49:32] it it's going to take the preaching of
[1:49:34] the
[1:49:38] word that's what I've always believed
[1:49:40] that's what I've always tried to teach
[1:49:43] you because I didn't put it it own need
[1:49:46] in Mage where brother around said with
[1:49:47] the restoration of word comes
[1:49:48] restoration of power what you want want
[1:49:54] Power like I told you I've sat and
[1:49:56] talked with ministers I've listened to
[1:49:57] people over the years there's a group
[1:49:59] goes that way and they say we got
[1:50:01] everything when we believe good Baptist
[1:50:03] Doctrine they said they believe the
[1:50:04] message they got the Holy Ghost they got
[1:50:05] everything the other group goes this way
[1:50:07] and says we ain't got
[1:50:08] nothing well I I want to be somewhere in
[1:50:11] between there you know to hold on to the
[1:50:14] word of God and believe what we've got
[1:50:16] and don't deny what God has done Among
[1:50:18] Us amen
[1:50:21] we have seen the sick heel the dead rais
[1:50:23] we've seen rain come we've seen rain
[1:50:25] leave we've seen storms spoken out of
[1:50:28] existence we've seen all kind of things
[1:50:30] stand here all afternoon talk about
[1:50:36] them this documented to where that like
[1:50:40] we stood and walked right out here when
[1:50:41] they said the war started in
[1:50:43] Kuwait you remember that I walked right
[1:50:46] out here in the back room and I said
[1:50:48] according to what God just revealed to
[1:50:50] me we're not ready
[1:50:52] yet cuz see Kuwait was right there so
[1:50:54] close to Israel cuz that could cause War
[1:50:56] just like that with Israel had Israel
[1:50:58] jumped their bombs on Kuwait we would
[1:51:00] have been in a world war but they would
[1:51:03] frame they got kept them from doing it
[1:51:06] but I said we can pray because God
[1:51:07] showed me we're not where we're supposed
[1:51:09] to be so we can pray and ask God to bind
[1:51:12] all the forces of the enemy and that
[1:51:15] they will not be able to use their
[1:51:18] forces against us
[1:51:21] they were buried in the ground waiting
[1:51:23] on us to pass over them and then they
[1:51:25] were going to just run right up behind
[1:51:27] us and trap us and all kind of
[1:51:30] things but the Russians forgot to tell
[1:51:33] them that to bury those tanks in the
[1:51:36] ground meant the moisture would build up
[1:51:39] and they'd rust it wouldn't
[1:51:41] work
[1:51:43] the we lost more people by our own
[1:51:46] friendly fire in
[1:51:48] Kuwait than we did by the enemy why
[1:51:53] because I believe that the Lord told me
[1:51:54] to come out here and let's do that now I
[1:51:56] didn't just say it I said it I said now
[1:51:58] let's
[1:52:00] pray and that
[1:52:02] happened see those are documented just
[1:52:04] don't have to worry about it we're not
[1:52:06] talking about something that ain't
[1:52:09] documented but you see all I want to do
[1:52:12] is preach the
[1:52:15] word and God he'll have to reveal it cuz
[1:52:18] we can't reveal it anyway go ahead
[1:52:19] brother 597 that's father 597 anybody
