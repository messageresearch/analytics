[7:05] praise the Lord amen I'm gonna gonna
[7:10] just give this quick testimony with
[7:14] brother Wade and the Dells permission
[7:17] just right before he comes out we were
[7:21] at a man's meeting just a few weeks ago
[7:23] there in in Hickory North Carolina and
[7:26] of course you meet a lot of different
[7:27] brothers from around the country who
[7:30] come there they just want to be better
[7:32] man better ministers better that her
[7:34] father's better husbands you know and so
[7:38] and I met this one brother there from
[7:40] his from Lorraine Ohio and his name is
[7:46] brother Isaac he's a Puerto Rican
[7:47] brother and when I told him who I was
[7:51] and and and I told him the church that
[7:53] I've come to he said oh my you're that
[7:57] you're that you go to that church where
[7:59] my dad has been listening to for last
[8:01] four years I said really he said yeah he
[8:05] said my dad my dad um he said he
[8:08] appreciates brother Wade and brother
[8:09] Dale's ministry over there he listens to
[8:12] them all the time he said and so so we
[8:15] just kind of let we kind of talked a
[8:17] little bit more left it at that well
[8:18] when when the meetings were over to
[8:21] Wednesdays ago he called me when I was
[8:22] coming to church and he said hey brother
[8:25] Luis I have my dad here brother brother
[8:27] Rick Richard is his name you want to say
[8:29] hello to him say yes yes so I was
[8:31] talking to him he said brother Luis it's
[8:33] good - it's good to meet you I said I'm
[8:35] gonna tell you brother you guys have
[8:37] such a great ministry over there he said
[8:40] he said for the last few years I've been
[8:43] on a message for the four flight 43
[8:45] years I think he's been in the message
[8:48] but he said uh he said that he's always
[8:53] had that struggle whether he made
[8:57] mistakes outside the body but making
[8:59] that differentiation that you're born
[9:01] again in the soul you see what I'm
[9:03] saying and that he struggled with that
[9:04] for so many years and it wasn't until
[9:06] arted listening to the ministry here
[9:07] that kind of really broke that down to
[9:09] him and really solidified his walk with
[9:12] Christ it's not that he doesn't go to a
[9:14] church over there he does but he also
[9:16] turns in to listen in
[9:18] and he said you know brother Luis one
[9:20] time one time I was uh I was listening
[9:23] and I was falling asleep and I was
[9:26] listening to brother Wade and I was
[9:28] falling asleep and he was talking about
[9:29] the stature of a perfect man he said
[9:33] when I fell asleep brother Louise I
[9:34] heard something say wake up and they
[9:42] were it was brother Wade and he said
[9:46] brother Luis when he said that I woke up
[9:49] and and I just it kept me up and I
[9:51] stayed listening and from then on I had
[9:53] not seen the Statue of perfectman the
[9:55] same since then he said and I said
[9:58] brother I said brother Richard you know
[10:00] for the wait sometimes he says that it
[10:02] may be for the people here but it was
[10:03] that was for you brother Richard all the
[10:05] way in Ohio so he he told me that and I
[10:11] said you know what by the way it'll
[10:12] probably get a kick out of that but uh
[10:15] he wants to come and just visit at some
[10:18] time and I told him I said you brother
[10:19] you're always welcome and so you pray
[10:22] for them pray for brother Richard
[10:23] brother Isaac they also have another son
[10:26] that I spoke with he's younger and just
[10:28] precious brethren so I just wanted to
[10:30] share that because I thought you know
[10:32] sometimes we think that it's just us
[10:33] here they're you know they're being
[10:35] blessed that are there are being
[10:37] receiving you know what God speaks
[10:39] through this pulpit but you know there's
[10:41] others that are listening in as well and
[10:43] you don't know maybe of a service that I
[10:46] believe that statue of a perfect man was
[10:48] supposed it was in 2015 and that was
[10:51] just recently where where he was getting
[10:53] it and you see something from 2015 still
[10:55] has an effect your voice say man
[10:58] whatever you say now a man steal carries
[11:00] has weight to it amen so you're gonna
[11:03] add a file with your words are you gonna
[11:04] not edify with your words amen praise
[11:06] God so let's stand to our feet is where

[14:31] to be in house with Lord if y'all show
[14:33] cans today okay all right let's turn to
[14:37] the Book of Daniel and get started real
[14:40] quick
[14:40] we got communion today does anyone not
[14:43] have the chart some of you have not been
[14:46] here in the afternoon so if you need a
[14:50] chart that we're going to talk about
[14:52] today you can have one for you
[14:54] and also the one of the day of 70 weeks
[14:56] if you want one just raise your hand
[14:58] we'll get you one all right we got a few
[15:04] Thomas brother Thomas can do that Tom
[15:06] book Thomas do that when they raise your
[15:09] hand just hand him one okay and one of
[15:11] these too fair want one of these two he
[15:12] go yeah there you go Oh brother Thomas
[15:16] he likes to do stuff for people all
[15:20] right while he's giving those out our
[15:25] Sunday School class from now on I know
[15:27] you young the young ones get out early
[15:30] but we had been pushing toward like
[15:33] 10:30 and and I think to get more
[15:36] continuity of the service in the morning
[15:38] we're obviously still starting at 9:45
[15:42] so I want to tell you parents make sure
[15:44] you don't kids don't wobble in at 10
[15:46] o'clock in 1005 because it breaks the
[15:50] continuity even of the service
[15:51] downstairs start at nine forty five sons
[15:54] who class will now end at ten fifteen at
[15:57] ten fifteen then we'll all come up here
[15:59] that way we can start having worship a
[16:02] little bit earlier we can worship
[16:04] brother Joe does a real good job I just
[16:06] don't want a lot of at 10:30 there's a
[16:09] lot of in and out in and out so if we
[16:11] will do it at 10:15 I give us 30 minutes
[16:14] to have Sunday school we don't need to
[16:15] have preaching downstairs we just need
[16:17] to have Sundays go
[16:17] alright so now I'm 45 to 10:15 but make
[16:20] sure you get 9:45 when it starts okay
[16:23] and then 10-15 will dismiss and all come
[16:26] upstairs and we can start singing before
[16:28] we bring brother Dale out it just gives
[16:30] a lot less confusion if we're not moving
[16:32] around so much before the service starts
[16:35] we'll remember that ten fifteen I've
[16:36] already talked to Boyd about it so he
[16:38] knows also November 2nd and 3rd I know
[16:41] it you say boss November but you know
[16:43] what it's only about three weeks from
[16:44] now and I'm not gonna say what's that
[16:46] other word in December is so we're not
[16:48] gonna worry about that one for right now
[16:49] November the 2nd the 3rd remember is our
[16:52] youth weekend we will be starting at 2
[16:57] o'clock on Saturday we will have
[17:01] something to eat and we may have a guest
[17:03] speaker for that day just for a little
[17:06] while
[17:06] ok we'll settle
[17:07] just a bit and then brother rush dunkers
[17:10] gonna be here with us that weekend from
[17:11] from Minnesota we menace order you got
[17:15] it you gotta be able I'll say Minnesota
[17:17] he's from Minnesota but also remembers
[17:22] the Fall Festival we're going to meet
[17:23] next Sunday again for those of you that
[17:25] have a responsibility next Sunday at
[17:27] 1:15 110 we're gonna meet downstairs in
[17:30] Sunday school class to kind of solidify
[17:32] all the what people are gonna do and
[17:36] bringing all the stuff and yadda yadda
[17:38] yadda so I don't want to tell you
[17:40] something brother Dale was talking about
[17:42] this morning summit brotherly kindness
[17:44] and the church he's referring to I
[17:47] started preaching that a while back well
[17:50] 10 or 12 so many years ago and they came
[17:55] from that old and I'm gonna name it that
[17:56] came from they came from all came from
[17:58] Arkansas so it was basically the women
[18:01] said on this side and the men said on
[18:03] this side and when he went outside two
[18:04] men went in this court and women went in
[18:06] this court and that's true didn't it
[18:07] so anybody when you walk up to shake
[18:10] their hands I can't fall back far enough
[18:13] they were like hello brother god bless
[18:15] you have you know never said love you so
[18:20] I thought well so dad started coming out
[18:23] and he preached from a couple of times
[18:25] and he's a big guy you know and they
[18:26] don't want to run they can't run from
[18:27] him he's two pastors over the church now
[18:29] the other discharge you know so anyway
[18:31] he grabs them and hugs them and says I
[18:33] love you and God bless you know what
[18:34] that broke that whole church it didn't
[18:37] break their back anymore no now they're
[18:40] just they're just a loving Church and
[18:42] you know what that's showing brotherly
[18:44] kindness that's taking brotherly
[18:45] kindness and giving it to somebody else
[18:46] and you know what they were
[18:48] spirit-filled people they had just had a
[18:51] little problem with saying god bless you
[18:54] and we love you you know it's hard for a
[18:56] man to say if you do that out in the
[18:57] world you're funny
[18:59] they consider you they consider you
[19:01] another word if you tell another man you
[19:04] love them but in godly love we were
[19:06] telling them in godly love and now you
[19:08] go to that church and I mean they're
[19:09] just you know the men and all and then
[19:12] but that's what broke it was a brother
[19:16] Dale going out and just making him I
[19:18] mean he'd pull them you know
[19:21] you'd do that rope pull you know he'd
[19:22] pull them in and and after a while they
[19:25] became I think wasn't if they weren't a
[19:27] loving Church yes I agree they wonder if
[19:29] they weren't a loving Church it's just
[19:31] when when you start and you get talked a
[19:33] little bit deeper and a little bit
[19:35] deeper the Holy Spirit's inside of you
[19:37] says hey we're missing something here
[19:39] we're missing the love of the Brethren
[19:42] where we can hug each other's neck and
[19:44] say I love you and godly love and be
[19:47] right with that so that broke the whole
[19:48] thing out there and they're just a
[19:50] beautiful loving Church so you say well
[19:52] you shouldn't well we did we did do that
[19:55] we did go out there and tell them we
[19:57] loved we invaded their pulpit we but we
[19:59] were invited but they just weren't
[20:01] brought up under that you or not you
[20:03] were not brought up under that you were
[20:05] brought to brought up to be a loving
[20:07] group of people and men being able to
[20:10] hug men and godly you know I have a I
[20:13] have a problem sometimes you know the
[20:14] Bible talks about giving the godly kiss
[20:17] yes I've I know it's in the Bible but a
[20:22] man kissing the man just home but you
[20:26] know if it sent done in godly love then
[20:29] just like the same way with that I'm
[20:31] telling you when you shook those
[20:32] people's hands it was like that's all
[20:35] you're getting just shake my hand but
[20:37] now they're a very loving group of
[20:39] people and they're pastors just doing
[20:41] really well and and he's projecting that
[20:43] love so we you know he lives them a
[20:48] sermon he didn't have to read him in the
[20:51] Bible he didn't go out there and preach
[20:52] 70 weeks of Daniel or I mean a statue of
[20:55] perfect man he just went out lived it
[20:56] just went live the I'd rather live a
[20:59] statue of bourbon man there's somebody
[21:00] preach it all the time coming you know
[21:02] so let's get started in 70 weeks here of
[21:04] Daniel hmm
[21:06] we're gonna go through the six fold
[21:07] purpose again because a lot of you
[21:09] weren't here last weekend but that's
[21:10] okay part four six fold purpose Daniel
[21:13] 9:24 unless the bow our heads and pray
[21:16] dear lord thank you for this day thank
[21:20] you for the people that you put in this
[21:22] building Lord to hear from you father
[21:24] and I pray today that they will hear
[21:26] from you Lord and not a man that you'll
[21:28] come off of those pages and come out of
[21:31] those words and be Lord alive where
[21:34] for each one of us a revelation Lord
[21:37] that we can contain and put in our heart
[21:39] and go from day to day father we pray
[21:42] that you'd be with the ones that are not
[21:44] here be with the ones that are sick the
[21:46] ones that are in the foreign fields Lord
[21:48] we pray that you'd give them fruit for
[21:49] their labor bless each one this here
[21:51] father and just give us grace today as
[21:53] we take communion father I pray that you
[21:55] would just forgive us all of our sins
[21:57] and our shortcomings that we do against
[21:59] you Lord that you'll cleanse us
[22:01] sanctifies for this journey we ask these
[22:05] things in Jesus name Amen
[22:08] Daniel seventy weeks all right because I
[22:12] believe if we get this six fold purpose
[22:14] then as we go on through it'll be easier
[22:16] to understand I I was talking to brother
[22:18] Russ this week and he said he said well
[22:20] just really what what's going on here I
[22:22] said well it's Redemption this is the
[22:24] total full plan of redemption because we
[22:27] worry about our plan of redemption which
[22:29] is the seven church ages but God started
[22:33] redeeming at Calvary and worked all the
[22:38] way from the foundation of the world
[22:40] because it was a lamb slain before the
[22:41] foundation the world's he was gonna have
[22:43] I redeemed the bride he was going to
[22:46] have a Israel to be redeemed and he's
[22:48] going to have a world that's going to be
[22:51] redeemed
[22:51] so Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are
[22:53] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[22:56] holy city so remember always two things
[22:59] people and city the number one finish
[23:02] the transgression number two make an end
[23:04] of sins
[23:04] number three make reconciliation for
[23:06] iniquity number four to bring in
[23:08] everlasting righteousness number five to
[23:10] seal up the vision and prophecy and
[23:11] number six to six to north the most holy
[23:15] that's all of Daniels 70 weeks that's it
[23:19] seventy weeks are determined to do these
[23:21] six things and that's it
[23:22] but this next 25 26 and 27 is going to
[23:26] show you how it's done
[23:27] God's going to explain or through
[23:30] Gabriel to Daniel to us he's going to
[23:33] explain how it's done know therefore and
[23:35] understand that from the going forth of
[23:37] the commandment to restore and to build
[23:38] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[23:41] shall be seven weeks that's one one
[23:43] period and threescore and two weeks
[23:46] that's the second period and I was
[23:47] telling the church downstairs
[23:48] people downstairs listen in all of
[23:50] Daniel 70 weeks in this whole Bible
[23:53] there is no half weeks in this 70 weeks
[23:56] of Daniel read it there's none there all
[24:01] four weeks all right
[24:03] she'll be seven weeks and threescore and
[24:06] two weeks which is 62 and seven is how
[24:11] much 69 the street shall be built again
[24:15] and the wall even in troublous times we
[24:17] will get into all that a little bit
[24:18] later and after threescore in two weeks
[24:21] shall Messiah be cut off who was that
[24:23] Jesus Christ at Calvary but not for
[24:25] himself who was he cut off for you and
[24:27] me and the people of the prince that
[24:29] shall come now this is another press
[24:31] this is not the Messiah this is another
[24:33] Prince shall destroy the city in the
[24:35] sanctuary we know that Titus in AD 70
[24:38] and the end thereof shall be with the
[24:40] flood into the end of the war
[24:41] desolations are determined you know
[24:44] here's the last period and he shall
[24:46] confirm the covenant with many for one
[24:48] week and one week is what seven years
[24:51] one week equals seven years all right
[24:53] according to the Bible we've already
[24:54] read it in the Bible that Jacob
[24:57] fulfilled the week to get Rachel and
[25:01] what was it seven years all right so
[25:03] brother Branham didn't come up with one
[25:04] week equal seven years it's always been
[25:06] in the Bible the the angel of the Lord
[25:09] just showed it to him put light on it
[25:11] and he said hey one week equals seven
[25:14] years that's why we're gonna stay try to
[25:16] stay in the Bible with this for a for
[25:18] more than we did the last time we did
[25:20] this he shall confirm now who is that he
[25:22] that's the Antichrist that's not Jesus
[25:24] Christ because Jesus Christ never breaks
[25:26] the Covenant right God never breaks the
[25:29] Covenant man always breaks the Covenant
[25:32] so this man this he shall confirm the
[25:35] covenant with many for one week that's
[25:38] the week we're going to talk about today
[25:39] and in the midst of the week he shall
[25:42] cause the sacrifice and oblation to
[25:44] cease and for the overspreading of
[25:46] abominations he shall make it desolate
[25:48] even until the consummation and that
[25:51] determined shall be poured upon the
[25:53] desolate you may be seated in the Lord
[25:55] at his blessing to the reading of the
[25:57] word so let's get started real quick I
[26:01] want to just go back
[26:02] a few minutes and recap so let's pull up
[26:06] in chronicles the Bible is already
[26:09] telling us what's going to happen to
[26:11] Israel Israel was God's bride right at
[26:15] first Israel was God's bride he had to
[26:19] divorce her he had to put her away for
[26:22] prostitution are going after what other
[26:25] idols going after other countries going
[26:28] after other things that were not of God
[26:31] so when she went and polluted herself
[26:33] God keep marry her back
[26:37] he gave her a bill of writing of
[26:39] divorcement we've been through that he'd
[26:42] give her a writing of divorcement put
[26:43] her away but he can't forget her though
[26:46] he even says I found married to you I
[26:49] can't in other words I can divorce you
[26:51] but you're still there and I'm not going
[26:54] to forget you because I'm going to
[26:55] redeem you laughter I get my Gentile
[26:57] bride I'm going to bring Redemption to a
[27:00] group of people called 144,000 but in
[27:04] second chronicles God is telling us in
[27:06] the Old Testament therefore he brought
[27:07] upon them the king of the Chaldees who
[27:10] slew their young men with the sword in
[27:11] the house of their sanctuary and had no
[27:14] compassion upon young men our maiden old
[27:17] man or him that stoop for age he gave
[27:19] them all into his hand in other words
[27:21] God fixed and dispersed Israel and all
[27:23] the vessels of the house of God because
[27:25] remember Daniel is two parts to the
[27:29] people and the city they got that same
[27:34] Inn and all the vessels of the house of
[27:37] God great and small and the treasures of
[27:39] the house of the Lord and the treasures
[27:41] of the King and of his princes all these
[27:44] he brought to Babylon so in other words
[27:47] the King comes and just destroys
[27:48] Jerusalem and takes everything back to
[27:50] Babylon all right but now they're gonna
[27:53] return and they burnt the house of God
[27:56] and break down the walls of Jerusalem
[27:58] and burn all the palaces thereof with
[27:59] fire and destroyed all the goodly
[28:01] vessels thereof in other words when
[28:04] Daniel is writing this Daniel 9:24 he's
[28:08] not even in Jerusalem he's in captivity
[28:11] he can't see the temple but he knows
[28:14] that it's
[28:14] been destroyed because jeremiah said it
[28:17] was going to be destroyed Chronicle said
[28:19] it was going to be destroyed so he knows
[28:21] that he's standing in Daniel 9:24 and
[28:25] Gabriel has given this instruction to
[28:27] him and he knows that the city is laying
[28:29] in waste and they burnt the house of God
[28:32] and break down the wall of Jerusalem
[28:33] because they got to build it back
[28:35] according to Daniel 9:24 they got to
[28:36] build a wall back and burn all the
[28:38] palaces there with fire destroyed all
[28:40] the goodly vessels thereof and then that
[28:43] had escaped from the sword carried me
[28:44] away to Babylon where they were servants
[28:46] to him and his sons until the reign of
[28:48] the king of Persia if you remember about
[28:52] the time of Esther remember the that was
[28:54] about that time where the Chaldeans and
[28:56] the Medes and the Persians got together
[28:58] in the book of Esther remember they were
[29:00] dispersed they weren't some people it's
[29:02] time tonight some people the some of the
[29:05] commentaries say a lot of the vagrants
[29:07] for the people that didn't have houses
[29:08] or the people that were homeless stayed
[29:10] in Jerusalem they were just in slums
[29:12] though they were not in houses they were
[29:13] in slums but a lot of the people
[29:15] remember were taken away from Babylon
[29:17] and that's what Esther was trying to do
[29:19] the King Haman or Haman was trying to
[29:21] tell the King hey these people need to
[29:23] be destroyed see the devil that Haman is
[29:27] trying to keep Israel from coming back
[29:28] into their homeland alright and
[29:30] according to what Esther said Esther
[29:32] said well hey the King says I can't take
[29:34] my word back right but Esther said just
[29:38] give them an opportunity to defend
[29:40] themselves and remember when you give
[29:42] Israel an opportunity to defend themself
[29:44] God is going to be with them and that's
[29:48] what same way now you know this little
[29:50] spot according to the world it's just a
[29:53] spot and there's a lot of people hate
[29:57] them but there's a lot of people fear
[29:58] Israel even at this moment because they
[30:01] know that what somewhere underlying in
[30:03] there somewhere God is working for those
[30:06] people he hasn't forgotten and then they
[30:09] had escaped from the sword carried away
[30:10] to Babylon where they were servants to
[30:12] him and his sons until the reign of the
[30:14] king of Persia to fulfill the word of
[30:17] the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until
[30:19] the land
[30:20] remember the land had enjoyed her
[30:22] Sabbath for as long as she lay desolate
[30:25] she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore
[30:27] and
[30:28] ten years which is 70 years three scores
[30:31] two times sixty three times sixty sorry
[30:36] three score three times two sixty and
[30:39] then 10 makes seventy so there's our
[30:41] seventy years in captivity everybody got
[30:43] that
[30:43] that was the 70 years they were
[30:45] determined that they were going to be
[30:46] there but remember what happened now
[30:49] brother Brown said God thought so much
[30:51] of Daniel 2 when he sent Gabriel to
[30:53] visit Daniel he didn't just tell him he
[30:56] was going to get out in two years he
[30:57] told him what was going to happen all
[30:58] the way to the Millennium all right he
[31:02] told him the whole thing the whole
[31:04] redemption of Israel the whole 490 years
[31:06] of Redemption because seventy times
[31:09] seven is 490 all right so those seventy
[31:12] weeks are determined but I want to read
[31:14] you this next one we're going to read
[31:18] these two every time because we're going
[31:20] to remember one thing for sure God's
[31:23] words eternal it cannot be changed it
[31:26] will not be changed never will be
[31:28] changed it is the finality the prophet
[31:32] of God tells us God's final resting
[31:33] places in the Word of God all right not
[31:36] in a quote the first name will wish to
[31:41] draw your attention to is the
[31:42] infallibility of God's Word God keeps
[31:44] his word to the letter and tonight we'll
[31:46] want to fasten our thoughts on that that
[31:48] God keeps his word we can rest assure of
[31:50] one thing that God has said in his word
[31:52] to be that anything God said in his word
[31:54] to be truth and faith does not rest upon
[31:57] the shifting sands of man's idea or
[31:59] man's theology but it has this final
[32:01] resting place on the unmovable rock of
[32:03] God's eternal word the word so anything
[32:07] we hear contrary to the word is wrong
[32:11] okay anything we hear contrary the word
[32:14] is wrong all right that's why I want to
[32:16] make that basis because look in number
[32:18] two God hiding himself in simplicity
[32:21] he's getting ready to preach the seals
[32:22] what is he telling the people if God
[32:24] said there would be rain for faith is
[32:26] the substance of things hoped for the
[32:28] evidence of things not seen
[32:29] and faith takes its final resting place
[32:32] on the Word of God there's where it
[32:34] finds its resting place so we're gonna
[32:37] we're going to put it on the Word of God
[32:39] not man's ideas
[32:43] and William Marion Branham was a prophet
[32:46] from God he was a word prophet I say the
[32:48] word was he still is he didn't lose his
[32:51] prophet ship by being in another
[32:52] dimension and then neither did Samuel or
[32:56] any of them they lose their prophet ship
[32:57] he's still a prophet but while he was
[32:59] here on earth he gave us 1,100 servants
[33:01] he gave us clarity why is there so much
[33:05] confusion in this message he didn't
[33:07] bring confusion he brought clarity our
[33:12] problem is is we don't study enough to
[33:15] make it clarity all right let's go to
[33:20] number three six full purpose we're
[33:22] gonna we've read these before we're
[33:23] gonna read them again seventy weeks are
[33:25] determined upon thy people for what
[33:27] purpose what is the purpose is to
[33:30] restore Israel and the city everything
[33:34] to do with this is all Redemption it's
[33:37] all restoring everything back to
[33:39] fellowship with God like I said before
[33:42] parallel yourself while we're going
[33:44] through this while we're going through
[33:45] the six fold purpose did he not finish
[33:49] your transgression did he not end your
[33:52] sin
[33:53] did he not reconcile you back to God
[33:55] we're going to read that in just a
[33:56] little while and as bride he brings in
[33:59] everlasting righteousness listen our
[34:02] soul is at peace with God it's in
[34:04] another dimension
[34:05] it doesn't hurt or have problems your
[34:08] soul was God seal up the vision and
[34:11] prophecy inside of you and anoint hope
[34:13] Wow North the whole person amen
[34:17] whose people was it determined upon
[34:19] Daniel's people the Jews what was it
[34:21] determined for upon not only Daniel but
[34:23] upon the holy city I'm telling you
[34:26] that's a key if you'll see both of those
[34:28] you'll see what brother Brown was
[34:30] talking about where everybody thinks
[34:31] he's wrong and these first few quotes
[34:33] but we're not gonna get to them now
[34:35] because we know for one thing's for sure
[34:37] I'm not here to prove brother I'm wrong
[34:39] you can't that make you God
[34:43] called the Prophet died National Bible
[34:46] God a man so he ain't gotta answer to me
[34:49] but I'm telling you the people think
[34:51] he's wrong so it got to be the devil cuz
[34:54] thank God all right man the proofs in
[34:59] the Word of God though the final proof
[35:02] is in the Word of God all right
[35:04] because remember brother Brown didn't
[35:06] point us to his self he pointed us to
[35:08] what Christ and Christ is the word amen
[35:10] so let's go to number four six full
[35:14] purpose we'll get started here just a
[35:15] second
[35:16] he says I'm leaving out weeks of
[35:18] teaching what kind of hitting is when
[35:20] the weather cools later we get into the
[35:21] seals vials trumpets and all these
[35:23] things that I can remember refer back to
[35:25] you do you remember on the seventy weeks
[35:27] of Daniel do remember the church ages
[35:29] when it went up and what taking place
[35:30] and the seventy weeks of Daniel covers
[35:33] from the going up of the church until
[35:35] the coming back of the church
[35:38] look right here the going up of the
[35:41] church this is the Gentile Church ages
[35:43] right Revelation is for one we go up in
[35:46] a wrapped room we don't come back to
[35:48] revelations 19 in the Millennium so that
[35:51] that week right here is not to us at all
[35:54] except it explains Redemption all right
[35:58] it explains my Redemption property' God
[36:01] said six seals finishes our Redemption
[36:04] because there's no redemption in the
[36:05] seventh seal the seven seals Christ
[36:07] himself and there so the same thing is
[36:10] going to happen here
[36:10] who's going to show up right here when
[36:12] this happens Christ is gonna show up but
[36:16] he's not gonna be alone he's gonna have
[36:18] a bride actually they're not gonna have
[36:20] a bride's wife because she's made
[36:23] herself ready alright so in these
[36:26] seventy of we that weeks of Daniel
[36:27] covers from the going up for the church
[36:29] until the coming back of the church that
[36:32] space is what it covers now not all
[36:33] seventy weeks of Daniel part of us we
[36:35] understand there's got to be a
[36:37] rebuilding of the temple there's got to
[36:38] be a messiah come but we're going to
[36:41] stay with the six fold purpose and it
[36:43] happens in this last week of the 70
[36:47] weeks of Daniel we're kind of going at
[36:49] it backwards but if you'll understand
[36:51] that week you won't have to worry about
[36:54] the other because it'll all be really
[36:55] clear okay
[36:58] seventy weeks are determined paragraph
[37:00] 36 now there's a six fold purpose to his
[37:02] visit telling him what's going to come
[37:04] to pass now there was a six full purpose
[37:06] of his coming there's a six full purpose
[37:11] and then Christ shows up there's a six
[37:14] fold there's a sixth seal redemption and
[37:16] then what Christ shows up everybody got
[37:19] that same n all right come on say what
[37:23] God and it just goes and go right Louise
[37:32] that's pretty cute and 70 weeks are
[37:37] determined upon thy people now remember
[37:39] that is all the journey of the Israel's
[37:41] have on this earth they are determined
[37:43] seventy weeks is just determined that's
[37:45] all that's lighted to the Jews upon thy
[37:48] people and upon thy holy city therefore
[37:49] this seventy weeks now don't miss it it
[37:51] will reveal from that time to the end of
[37:54] the Jews also to the end of Jerusalem
[37:56] until they've been you city built
[37:58] because remember this is the Battle of
[38:00] Armageddon everything is going to be
[38:02] destroyed and there's a new city to be
[38:04] built now this is not the future home
[38:07] this is the Millennial temple it is
[38:10] temporary the future home is not
[38:13] temporary the future huh and listen this
[38:16] is the Jews house that's not our house
[38:20] our house is coming a thousand years
[38:22] from then amen but it's a future home of
[38:26] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[38:28] bride but there'll be a new city built I
[38:32] hope I hope we get into it real deep so
[38:34] let's go down to revelations now this is
[38:36] how it's going to happen
[38:37] revelations 11:1 and there was given to
[38:39] me a reed like a rod and the angel stood
[38:41] saying rise and measure the temple of
[38:43] God and the altar and then that worship
[38:45] therein but the court which is without
[38:46] the temple leave out and measure it not
[38:48] where's given unto the Gentiles in the
[38:50] Holy City shall they tread under foot
[38:52] forty two months how much is forty two
[38:54] months three and a half years okay
[39:00] twelve months three times twelve thirty
[39:03] six and then add six you got you answer
[39:06] alright forty and two months and I will
[39:09] give power until my two witnesses and
[39:11] the two witnesses they show up after we
[39:14] leave and then they show up after we
[39:17] leave because they have nothing to do
[39:18] with the Gentiles nothing they are
[39:22] Jewish people so they'll only receive
[39:26] that they'll only receive their own
[39:27] people the two prophets have nothing to
[39:29] do with the Gentiles they're not
[39:30] Gentiles they are Jews all right
[39:34] anointed with the spirit of Elijah and
[39:35] Moses we know that and I will give power
[39:37] to my two witnesses and they shall
[39:39] prophesy one thousand two hundred and
[39:42] threescore days that's where I gotta
[39:43] right here twelve hundred and sixty days
[39:45] everybody got that say ma'am twelve
[39:48] hundred and sixty days they will
[39:49] prophesy and then something's going to
[39:51] happen and I'm going to stop right there
[39:53] just for a second because remember when
[39:56] we come to right here when they finish
[39:58] the transgression make an end of sin and
[40:00] reconcile their iniquity they're born
[40:02] again I was telling the church down
[40:06] start of the people downstairs listen
[40:08] they're not there commission is not to
[40:10] preach the statue of a perfect man their
[40:13] commission is not to preach the seals
[40:15] and all these different things that
[40:18] you're born again because they're gonna
[40:20] die and the only got three and a half
[40:22] years and they're gonna be killed for
[40:25] what they believe they don't have time
[40:26] to go up the statue of a perfect man
[40:27] they just they see just like you did
[40:31] when you went through baby form
[40:33] justification baby form sanctification
[40:35] and when God birthed you he birthed you
[40:38] because you had a revelation that Christ
[40:40] died for you on a cross what do you
[40:43] think is gonna happen to them we're
[40:44] gonna read it right here they gonna say
[40:46] where'd you get the scars they say they
[40:48] said in the house of my friends yeah men
[40:51] that okay y'all having a hard time
[40:54] staying awake today is if this bores you
[40:57] you need a new birth you need a new
[41:00] birth y'all sit and watch television all
[41:02] day long just like it somebody start
[41:05] preaching the Word of God to you and you
[41:06] fall asleep you don't even you don't
[41:08] even try to stay awake pinch yourself
[41:12] you know what to do if I get sleepy I'm
[41:14] set on the edge of the bench cuz I know
[41:16] if I fall asleep I'm gonna fall out and
[41:18] make a fiddle on myself try sit right up
[41:20] on the edge of the bench
[41:23] and I have like to fail a few times
[41:25] because we are human but look we're
[41:30] gonna talk about justification
[41:31] sanctification in the baptism of Holy
[41:33] Ghost today if that's all right call
[41:35] this part of the six fold purpose but we
[41:36] got to get the people redeemed first you
[41:39] and I have to come to Redemption first
[41:42] they come to Redemption and then the
[41:45] earth comes to come to a Redemption
[41:47] because when Adam fell in the garden
[41:50] everything fell even the earth
[41:52] everything under us fell so Adam the
[41:56] second Adam comes to redeemed then he
[41:58] brings a bride gets a group out of seven
[42:02] Church ages takes us away to a wedding
[42:05] supper then he comes back and he gets
[42:08] this 144,000 in that 1260 days they
[42:13] preach Redemption all right let's go to
[42:17] number one then to finish the
[42:19] transgression transgression means as
[42:22] recognized by sinners but is as God
[42:25] forgives same way with you you ice
[42:28] telling limit brother Tim hymns listen
[42:30] you've got to have a revelation if I go
[42:34] a little bit long sorry revelation you
[42:37] got to have a revelation that you were
[42:39] justified because you can't just walk up
[42:43] and say well I was a whatever you wanna
[42:48] say I was a drunk well God saved me and
[42:53] then you go back to drinking now you do
[42:55] maybe for a little while but a year
[42:57] later two years later no when you come
[43:01] to a revelation of justification you
[43:04] know for a fact and I know now the devil
[43:08] doesn't but I know my sins were chopped
[43:10] off because God took me on farther and
[43:13] he's not going to dwell in an unclean
[43:14] vessel that was very unclean when he
[43:17] first started the journey with me but he
[43:19] knew that remember brother Browns talks
[43:21] about the glass you picked he said God
[43:23] picks the glass up out of the mud so he
[43:27] had a purpose for that jar even though
[43:30] it's nasty in you and you you wouldn't
[43:33] want to touch it
[43:34] thank God for grace
[43:36] thank God for grace because you can see
[43:38] something on the side of the road and
[43:39] you're like ain't picking that up but
[43:42] God reaches over there and he gets in he
[43:44] fixes up he says hey I'm gonna use this
[43:46] cuz I sold boy right here I'm gonna
[43:48] clean him up well that's what he did
[43:50] with them because man it's across we're
[43:52] gonna read it they just don't even
[43:54] believe Jesus Christ was anything but
[43:56] maybe just a good man not the Messiah
[44:01] definitely not Jehovah in flesh neither
[44:07] did you so what's the difference neither
[44:11] did you
[44:12] so he's going to finish Israel's
[44:14] transgression in this 1260 days the two
[44:18] prophets are going to preach Christ died
[44:22] for your sins and they're going to
[44:25] preach him so real but what they're
[44:27] gonna have attached to it is is they're
[44:29] going to have some signs and wonders to
[44:31] go with it that only Israel is going to
[44:33] be able to accept because all the other
[44:35] world's gonna hate them maybe we read
[44:38] that we're reading it the whole world
[44:39] hates them two prophets but at the
[44:41] 144,000 don't because that's their
[44:44] salvation coming through two men God in
[44:49] human flesh again so as God forgives a
[44:52] nice read where brother where I'm
[44:53] setting the six fold purpose number five
[44:54] now if we get back there's Daniel again
[44:56] we'll find out that in Daniel we find
[44:58] out here the 24th verse to finish the
[45:01] transgression to finish what to finish
[45:04] Israel's transgression what is
[45:05] transgression it is to go against
[45:08] something a transgression against me is
[45:10] to go wrong to me they done they
[45:12] transgressed God they turned him totally
[45:14] down and it wasn't justice it wasn't
[45:17] just the prostitutes and the drunks they
[45:19] loved him but the religious people of
[45:23] the world hated him same as today
[45:29] transgress against you is to do a wrong
[45:31] to you so Israel did it wrong to God and
[45:34] in this 70th week what's going to happen
[45:37] God is going to finish the transgression
[45:40] of Israel finish the transgression will
[45:43] be turn away the ungodliness from Jacob
[45:45] and then all Israel will be born again
[45:48] all of them will receive the Holy Spirit
[45:50] we went to Romans 11 just for a second
[45:53] you don't have to do that Romans 11
[45:55] verse 21 through 27 talks about what the
[45:58] engrafting is said that we were they
[46:00] were the tame olive tree but God had to
[46:02] cut some branches off of the tame olive
[46:04] tree and he grafted in a wild olive tree
[46:08] or seven church ages which is me and you
[46:10] we're the wild child but God loves us
[46:13] he's gonna make a bride out of us but
[46:15] what happens is is then you look in the
[46:17] Romans and it says what more is it
[46:20] though that God can graph them back in
[46:22] again God we lived off the life we live
[46:29] off the life of the Old Testament there
[46:32] are example right then we live through
[46:35] the New Testament then God's going to
[46:36] come back and graph back in that same
[46:39] tame olive tree to make it grow back up
[46:43] again what about Redemption how about
[46:46] that which is truly justification God's
[46:49] going to what finish their sin he's
[46:51] going to finish it and he's going to
[46:52] make an end of sin number two let's do
[46:54] it real quick six full purpose number
[46:56] two make an end of sin now let's read
[46:58] again Daniel to finish transgression I
[47:00] make an end of sin you see all these
[47:02] words finish in and reconcile God and
[47:07] that's the same way done with you
[47:08] because if you have any sin in your soul
[47:11] you're not born again God has done away
[47:13] with the sin in your soul if you're born
[47:15] again he has burned all that out but now
[47:18] you have sin in your middle man memory
[47:22] reasons and conscious effects and
[47:23] imagination remember there's only one
[47:25] sense in the soul in this faith or doubt
[47:27] all right and your skin doesn't sin
[47:31] what's motivates it it's the sinning
[47:34] part alright so make an end of sin
[47:36] number two where did is real sin where
[47:40] did they do their vital sin where did
[47:41] they separate themselves from
[47:43] now we read that if you pull up Matthew
[47:45] 27 just go to the very end of verse 25
[47:48] then I hope y'all are Bible readers and
[47:51] you know where this come from
[47:52] because Pilate was trying to say look
[47:54] this man there's no fault in this man
[47:56] he's not worthy to die and what did they
[48:01] say he washed his hands and he said do
[48:03] with him in other words see you to it
[48:05] then answered all the people now who
[48:07] were they they were all Jews they were
[48:10] all Jews they looked at him and said his
[48:14] blood be on us and on our children his
[48:18] blood be on us and our children all
[48:22] through this he cut them off and through
[48:25] six church seven Church ages he didn't
[48:27] deal with Israel any more because they
[48:30] said let his blood be on us and our
[48:31] children and there like I said before I
[48:33] see it now in a different light that's
[48:35] the only way they could have said it
[48:37] because his blood didn't cover them
[48:39] during that time he's literally blind in
[48:42] his own children but by his shed blood
[48:45] at Calvary he said Father forgive them
[48:48] for they know not what they do so he
[48:52] forgave them at Calvary but it's gonna
[48:53] you know what they're going to do those
[48:55] two prophets are going to tell them
[48:57] exactly what that man said on the cross
[49:00] and they're gonna believe it
[49:02] in 144,000 Zechariah verse 13 verse 1
[49:08] and that day day that she'll be a
[49:11] fountain open to the house of David
[49:12] until the inhabitants of Jerusalem for
[49:15] sin and for uncleanness because remember
[49:17] that's in this 70th week it's not back
[49:20] here now listen God's not dealing with
[49:21] Israel right now
[49:22] no he's dealing with his Gentiles he's
[49:25] guys get us out of the way cuz remember
[49:27] he doesn't deal with two it's the same
[49:28] time he's got to get us out of the way
[49:30] so he can come and deal with them but
[49:32] when he deals with him he's gonna deal
[49:33] with him in the same way you and I come
[49:35] to be Christians because they're gonna
[49:38] be Christian they're gonna be
[49:39] christ-like okay they're just not gonna
[49:43] be bribed because he's already putting
[49:45] them away
[49:45] Zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say
[49:49] unto Him what what are these wounds
[49:52] in thine hands then he shall answer
[49:55] those which I was wounded in the house
[49:57] of my friends those two prophets are
[49:59] gonna preach Jesus Christ so real so
[50:02] they're going to know that those nail
[50:03] prints were for them and they're gonna
[50:05] say where did you get those wounds and
[50:06] he says in the house of my friends all
[50:09] right let's go to number seven the six
[50:11] fold purpose
[50:12] they'll be so ashamed of their self when
[50:15] they stand there and see can't you
[50:17] remember that day weren't you ashamed of
[50:20] yourself
[50:20] I was ashamed of myself when I come to
[50:22] realization that God had forgiven me of
[50:25] my sin when he had what when he had
[50:28] justified me and and made me and started
[50:31] cleaning me up it didn't make me feel
[50:34] real happy I was a little bit sad but I
[50:36] was happy but I was going man he did all
[50:40] that for me amen they'll be so ashamed
[50:44] of their self when they stand there and
[50:46] see that that very one that they
[50:48] crucified in the night standing there
[50:49] their own precious Joseph they'll be
[50:51] such morning they'll say where did you
[50:53] get those scars he said in the house of
[50:55] my friends see what I mean to make an
[50:57] end of sin of unbelief because they are
[51:00] stuck in unbelief right now they do not
[51:02] believe that Jesus Christ died for their
[51:04] sins or they would become Christians and
[51:07] 140 this is this this is 144,000 can't
[51:11] receive that if they did they'd be
[51:14] bribed while we're still here but that's
[51:16] why we got to be out of the way totally
[51:19] out of the way Joseph sent his wife to
[51:21] the palace before he revealed itself to
[51:24] his brothers who were the Jews see what
[51:28] I mean make an end of sin of unbelief
[51:29] that's what he's coming for in this 70th
[51:33] year of Daniel he corrects itself 70th
[51:35] week rather coming to make an end of sin
[51:38] put it away you understand now what's
[51:39] the first finish the transgression
[51:41] number two make an end of sin number
[51:43] three make reconciliation
[51:46] but what sanctifies you the blood the
[51:53] blood sanctifies you Jesus Christ blood
[51:55] on the earth sanctified you the man and
[51:58] the blood keeps you sanctified remember
[52:01] the blood doesn't save you keeps you
[52:03] safe that same way with him so that's
[52:05] why when they said let his blood be on
[52:07] us to me that was God speaking through
[52:10] them you say oh that was horrible no
[52:12] that was covering them let his blood be
[52:15] on us for 2,000 years don't you can't he
[52:20] can't destroy Israel but look how they
[52:23] were persecuted Lord Titus killed them
[52:26] some but still they they stayed in that
[52:28] city Salonga they eat their own children
[52:30] they eat the bark off the tree just cuz
[52:32] they turned their Messiah down but
[52:36] that's why one glorious day there's
[52:37] going to be in this in this last day at
[52:39] this time right here the two prophets
[52:41] are here you talk about a 144,000 they
[52:44] gonna have a Pentecostal meeting they
[52:46] ain't gonna be sitting here dry died and
[52:48] no no it's gonna be that fresh day like
[52:52] when you got born again it's gonna be
[52:53] that day when you first started your
[52:55] Christian journey and that everything
[52:57] was real fresh all right so let's go to
[52:59] number three to make reconciliation for
[53:01] iniquity in the Hebrew lexicon that
[53:05] means to cover purged or make an
[53:06] atonement make reconciliation cover over
[53:10] with pitch to make an atonement for you
[53:13] know what Christ did for you he made an
[53:15] atonement look at number eight to make
[53:19] reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is
[53:22] doing wrong as they did at the cross he
[53:26] made reconciliations but it will not be
[53:28] applied to them see it wasn't applied
[53:30] back 2,000 years ago it's only gonna be
[53:32] applied to the two prophets 144,000 but
[53:36] it will not be applied to them it was
[53:38] not applied to them why because they
[53:40] were blinded and could not see it but
[53:43] God kept them covered number nine
[53:47] now Jesus quoted that scripture smite
[53:49] the Shepherd and scared of the sheep but
[53:51] notice the next paragraph he just quoted
[53:53] that much of it but watch what the next
[53:55] sentence of it says I didn't read a
[53:56] minute ago but here he's reading it the
[53:58] next part of it now will turn my hand to
[54:00] the little ones what the Benjamin group
[54:03] that's coming up now I will turn my hand
[54:05] to the little ones smite the Shepherd
[54:06] Israel first Israel smote the Shepherd
[54:10] Jesus scattered the Sheep to all the
[54:14] world what happened
[54:16] Israel has been dispersed all over the
[54:18] world until just recently then there
[54:20] started kind of what made brother Brown
[54:21] so happy he saw them coming back so God
[54:24] could deal with them in their homeland
[54:26] they got to be in the homeland before
[54:27] them two prophets show up scattered the
[54:30] Sheep to all the world but God said I
[54:32] will turn my hand back to get them
[54:34] little ones that the last day when when
[54:37] reconciliation for iniquity has been
[54:39] made Israel will be saved every one of
[54:43] them now made the point last week that's
[54:45] not everybody that says they're Jews
[54:47] that's the only 144,000 heads of
[54:51] household you what do you ever you won't
[54:52] call that's only 144,000 is going to be
[54:54] saved
[54:55] that's according to what the Bible says
[54:57] then he said let's turn to Isaiah 66
[54:59] chapter read just for a few minutes what
[55:02] God says about Israel being saved let's
[55:05] just read the red part who has heard
[55:06] such a thing who has seen such a thing
[55:08] shall the earth be made and bring forth
[55:10] in one day for as soon as I'm travail
[55:12] she brought forth her children as soon
[55:14] as I saw that their Messiah she was born
[55:16] again in one day make reconciliation for
[55:18] sin make reconciliation for iniquity
[55:20] uncleanness oh my they did that what was
[55:23] evil that which was wrong
[55:25] reconciliation was made for their
[55:28] iniquity alright now look you and I have
[55:32] a reconciliation 2nd Corinthians 5 verse
[55:36] 17 says therefore if any man be in
[55:38] Christ he is a new creature old things
[55:41] are passed away behold all things have
[55:42] become new and all things are of God who
[55:45] has reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[55:47] Christ and hath given to us the Ministry
[55:50] of reconciliation
[55:52] alright to wit that God was in Christ
[55:54] reconciling the world unto himself not
[55:56] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[56:00] committed unto us the word of
[56:03] reconciliation he's committed it to me
[56:05] and you the word of reconciliation are
[56:09] the atonement bring up the next one or
[56:11] the new bird they're gonna receive a
[56:13] birth they're going to be born again in
[56:15] the day they're gonna be born again
[56:17] after during this 1260 day period that's
[56:20] going to redeem the Jews but now we've
[56:25] still got a city and we've still got a
[56:28] world that we got to deal with so and
[56:30] that's what I want to go through right
[56:32] here and we can read zechariah 12 if you
[56:36] want to but remember you would pour out
[56:38] upon the house of David inhabitants of
[56:40] Jerusalem the spirit of grace and
[56:41] supplication and they shall look upon me
[56:43] whom they have pierced and they shall
[56:45] mourn for me as one mourning for his own
[56:47] son don't you think the 144,000 those
[56:50] they get a revelation of Jesus Christ
[56:53] like I said they're gonna be happy but
[56:57] they're gonna mourn because they the one
[56:59] they realize they're the ones that put
[57:00] him on the cross there the end that what
[57:02] what you know what we realize cuz I
[57:05] didn't physically put him on the cross
[57:08] I didn't physically put him on the cross
[57:11] I didn't physically put him on the cross
[57:14] but I put him on the cross they put him
[57:18] on the cross and they said let his blood
[57:20] be on nursing our children and so did
[57:22] you he said no I didn't well you lived
[57:26] in sin for a while then you okay but his
[57:29] blood kept you covered
[57:31] thank God I stuns people the ones
[57:33] downstairs brother brother said God
[57:36] gives us an angel and that angel is
[57:39] given to predict protect the heirs of
[57:41] righteousness what he knows whose
[57:44] predestinate and who's not
[57:45] he knows you got an we know we've got an
[57:48] angel somewhere watching over us so
[57:53] let's go now
[57:54] and see that these three process is
[57:56] complete the birth now what I want to
[57:58] say tell you is this key to the six fold
[58:01] purpose is that number one the seventy
[58:08] weeks of Daniel according to Daniel nine
[58:11] cannot end right here I said according
[58:19] to the Bible because he shall confirm
[58:22] the covenant with many for what one week
[58:26] one week equals seven years so there's a
[58:28] seven one more 7 year period left after
[58:31] we leave according to the Bible now 99%
[58:37] of the people in the church says no
[58:38] there's only three and a half years to
[58:40] complete Daniel seventy weeks that's not
[58:42] true that's not true according the Bible
[58:45] he said I got quotes if that quote
[58:48] doesn't match the Bible the quotes wrong
[58:52] either later we got to change the Bible
[58:54] you can't change the Bible but I'm
[58:58] telling you brother Bryan knew what he
[58:59] was saying God knew what he was saying
[59:01] through that prophet because I think he
[59:04] stood there one day and I believe it he
[59:05] never said it but I think Jesus said it
[59:07] one time he said thank you Father
[59:09] but you've hid these things from the
[59:12] eyes of the wise and prudent I mean
[59:14] Jesus yet pull it out of the Bible Jesus
[59:16] said you got to eat my flesh and drink
[59:17] my blood well today we're gonna have to
[59:19] do that
[59:21] but we got a revelation to know that
[59:23] it's not human flesh and it's not human
[59:25] blood
[59:25] but now the quote says the quote says
[59:30] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[59:33] no part with me and don't know what to
[59:34] quote says you know what's quote says
[59:37] alright that's what the quote says we're
[59:39] gonna have to do what quote says are we
[59:41] going to do what the revelation of the
[59:42] quote says alright so the revelation of
[59:45] this quote is that there's no way that
[59:47] Daniel 7 new weeks can end after the
[59:51] 1260 days of the two prophets according
[59:54] to Daniel 9:24 that says seventy weeks
[59:58] are determined upon thy people in the
[1:00:00] holy city to do six things
[1:00:04] we just covered three all right because
[1:00:08] the Bible says that there that he will
[1:00:10] confirm the covenant with many for one
[1:00:11] week and in the midst of the week he'll
[1:00:13] cut it off and there'll be all kinds of
[1:00:17] desolations and everything determined
[1:00:19] that's what the Bible says so let's read
[1:00:21] revelations 11 let's look at this real
[1:00:25] quick there was given me a reed and like
[1:00:29] a rod the angel stood saying rise and
[1:00:32] measure the temple of God and the altar
[1:00:33] and them that worship therein but the
[1:00:35] court which is without leave measure it
[1:00:37] not for it is given unto the Gentiles in
[1:00:39] the Holy City shall they tread under
[1:00:40] foot forty and two months everybody got
[1:00:43] that forty in two months and I will give
[1:00:46] power to my two witnesses and they shall
[1:00:48] prophesy 1233 scored days which is forty
[1:00:52] two months according to the to the
[1:00:55] prophetic calendar not the calendar we
[1:00:57] live by now clothed in sackcloth these
[1:01:00] are the two olive trees and the two
[1:01:02] candlesticks standing before the god of
[1:01:03] the earth and if any man will hurt them
[1:01:06] fire proceedeth out of their mouth and
[1:01:07] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[1:01:10] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[1:01:12] killed
[1:01:12] these have power to shut heaven that it
[1:01:14] rain not in the days of the prophecy and
[1:01:16] have power over waters to turn them to
[1:01:19] blood and to smite the earth with all
[1:01:21] plagues as often as they will now stop
[1:01:24] right there because we're going to go
[1:01:26] back read Daniel 9:27 because
[1:01:30] revelations 11 1 through 6 is right here
[1:01:37] they're going to prophesy 1260 days
[1:01:39] right read your Bible they're gonna
[1:01:42] prophesy 1260 days then something's
[1:01:45] gonna happen so let's read Daniel 9:27
[1:01:47] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:01:49] many for one week now that's a whole
[1:01:51] seven years and in the midst of the week
[1:01:54] he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:01:57] oblation to cease right here and for the
[1:02:00] overspreading of abominations he shall
[1:02:01] make it desolate even until the
[1:02:03] consummation and that determined shall
[1:02:05] be poured out upon the desolate now
[1:02:07] let's go back read revelations 11
[1:02:08] continue with verse 7 because verse 7 is
[1:02:12] and when they shall have finished their
[1:02:13] testimony now we're on your
[1:02:16] where on your paper has he finished that
[1:02:18] when the two prophets finished their
[1:02:20] testimony after 1260 days okay never got
[1:02:26] that say man that's what the Bible says
[1:02:28] and then when they shall have finished
[1:02:31] their testimony the beast in other words
[1:02:34] the guy that made the covenant with them
[1:02:36] right here we're not here when it's
[1:02:39] signed we're not here when it's made so
[1:02:42] we're going in a rapture he makes a
[1:02:44] covenant for seven years he breaks that
[1:02:47] covenant when those 1260 days are over
[1:02:50] according to the Bible he comes in and
[1:02:52] breaks the covenant and the Beast that
[1:02:55] ascendeth out of the bottomless pit
[1:02:56] shall make war against them and shall
[1:02:58] overcome them and kill them so it's got
[1:03:02] to be after the 1260 days because the
[1:03:05] Bible said they're gonna prophesy 1260
[1:03:06] days that Alright say Amen and their
[1:03:10] dead bodies shall lie in the street of
[1:03:12] the great city which spiritually is
[1:03:13] called Sodom and Egypt where they our
[1:03:15] Lord was crucified and they have the
[1:03:17] people in kindred and tongue and nations
[1:03:19] shall see their dead bodies according to
[1:03:21] seeing the end Fox News and all the
[1:03:23] other news stations amen cuz they're
[1:03:26] gonna see their dead body the whole
[1:03:27] world is only when television is here
[1:03:32] three days and a half and she'll not
[1:03:34] suffer their dead bodies to be put in
[1:03:35] the grave and they that dwell upon the
[1:03:37] earth shall rejoice over them and make
[1:03:39] merry boy they made some people mad
[1:03:40] didn't he and make merry and shall send
[1:03:42] gifts one to the other because these two
[1:03:45] prophets tormented them that dwelt on
[1:03:46] the earth and after three days and a
[1:03:49] half the spirit of life from God entered
[1:03:50] into them and they stood on their feet
[1:03:52] and great fear fell upon them which saw
[1:03:54] them and they heard a great voice from
[1:03:56] heaven saying to them come up hither and
[1:03:58] they ascended up to heaven in a cloud
[1:04:00] and their enemies beheld them now look
[1:04:02] that's not right here
[1:04:06] right that's in the midst of the week
[1:04:10] they're gonna take a rapture hello
[1:04:14] they're gonna take a rapture right here
[1:04:17] it's what it says right here in the
[1:04:19] Bible everybody got that
[1:04:23] in the same hour there was a great
[1:04:25] earthquake in the tenth part of the city
[1:04:27] failed verse 13 and in the earthquake
[1:04:29] were slain of men seven thousand and a
[1:04:31] remnant were frightened and gave glory
[1:04:33] to the God of heaven that's in the midst
[1:04:35] of the week then what's going to happen
[1:04:36] there's going to be a battle of
[1:04:38] Armageddon I'll pull some quotes up and
[1:04:40] I'll bring them the next Sunday or
[1:04:41] Wednesday night maybe we'll do it
[1:04:42] talking about the Balam Armageddon
[1:04:44] because the Battle of Armageddon is
[1:04:45] different from the Battle of Gog and
[1:04:47] Magog the battle Armageddon is totally
[1:04:49] different from the Battle of Gog and
[1:04:50] Magog totally different alright but
[1:04:53] there's a Bala marm again that destroys
[1:04:55] by nuclear explosion and all these other
[1:04:58] things of man cuz that's going to be a
[1:05:00] man battle right here it's not gonna be
[1:05:03] God now God's gonna fight for Israel cuz
[1:05:05] we're gonna read it right here watch go
[1:05:08] to Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time
[1:05:11] Michael stand up shall Michael stand up
[1:05:14] the Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:05:15] children of the people there shall be a
[1:05:17] time of trouble such as never was since
[1:05:18] there was a nation even to that same
[1:05:20] time and at that time thy people shall
[1:05:22] be delivered every one that shall be
[1:05:24] found written in the book so write in
[1:05:26] there somewhere they're gonna take a
[1:05:29] rapture though and then you know what's
[1:05:31] going to happen
[1:05:33] there's not one person on this earth a
[1:05:37] Christian not one person on this earth
[1:05:40] has the Holy Ghost in their soul not one
[1:05:42] person not one there's only 144 and two
[1:05:46] right here 144,000 - there's gonna be
[1:05:49] zero that's why the Battle of Armageddon
[1:05:51] they're just gonna start firing at each
[1:05:53] other because there's nothing left
[1:05:55] there's no grace of God we're looking at
[1:05:59] the Great Tribulation there's gonna be
[1:06:01] tribulation right here I got some quotes
[1:06:04] I'll read it to you where the where the
[1:06:06] tribulation starts this way and works
[1:06:08] its way to Israel then they have that's
[1:06:10] Jacob's trouble and then because they've
[1:06:13] been on your chart brother Brent put the
[1:06:14] Great Tribulation
[1:06:15] this is tribulation but this is going to
[1:06:18] be where there is nobody here there's no
[1:06:20] grace all the grace is gone everything's
[1:06:22] lifted off the earth and that's just
[1:06:26] going to be what Gentile men Jewish men
[1:06:30] without any godliness at all are gonna
[1:06:34] start destroying each other all right
[1:06:37] there by okay with that but then it's
[1:06:42] out to save time let's go to verse 7
[1:06:45] Daniels having this vision and I've
[1:06:48] heard the man clothed in linen which was
[1:06:50] upon the water of the river when he held
[1:06:51] up his right hand and his left hand to
[1:06:53] heaven swear by him that liveth for ever
[1:06:55] the bishop for a time times and a half
[1:06:58] now watch time 1 once time two once a
[1:07:00] half three and a half years when he
[1:07:02] shall have accomplished to scatter the
[1:07:04] power of the holy people people all
[1:07:06] these things shall be finished and I
[1:07:09] heard but I understood not then Daniel
[1:07:13] said oh my lord what she'll be the end
[1:07:15] of these things he said go thy way
[1:07:16] Daniel for the words are closed and
[1:07:18] sealed till the time of the end well you
[1:07:19] know what they're open now he was
[1:07:23] talking about us it's open to us because
[1:07:27] the Prophet came and opened the book for
[1:07:29] us God through the Prophet
[1:07:31] go that way Daniel meaning she'll be
[1:07:34] purified and made white and tried but
[1:07:36] the wicked shall do wicked and none of
[1:07:37] the wicked shall understand but the wise
[1:07:39] shall understand so now
[1:07:43] let's start right here just real quick
[1:07:48] go that was truly a Battle of Armageddon
[1:07:50] everything's dead and to prove by the
[1:07:54] Bible that there's one week left after
[1:07:57] the rapture you can read it in black and
[1:07:58] white but just to make sure you
[1:08:02] understand it you can't bring in
[1:08:04] everything you got to have six things to
[1:08:06] finish the 70 weeks of Daniel that's
[1:08:09] what the Bible says seventy weeks are
[1:08:11] determined to do six things well now
[1:08:13] we've already had a battle of Armageddon
[1:08:14] the world's been wiped off there's got
[1:08:17] to be some time left to do these other
[1:08:21] three because you can't bring in
[1:08:24] everlasting righteousness and build a
[1:08:26] Millennial temple here and then have it
[1:08:28] all destroyed so there's not three and a
[1:08:32] half years left of Daniel 70 weeks after
[1:08:34] the rapture of the church now there is
[1:08:35] three and a half years of Jesus's
[1:08:37] ministry left but you gotta bring the
[1:08:41] city in member it's to Daniel people and
[1:08:46] the city because the Millennial temples
[1:08:49] got to be built because in Revelations
[1:08:51] 1921 we enter into it according to the
[1:08:55] Bible according to the prophets message
[1:08:57] I read it to you last Sunday we read it
[1:09:00] again now so let's go to revelations no
[1:09:04] let's go to number four number four
[1:09:06] bring in everlasting righteousness
[1:09:08] they've already got it up there number
[1:09:11] four to bring in everlasting
[1:09:12] righteousness that's the fourth thing to
[1:09:14] come for the fourth what's he coming to
[1:09:16] do to bring in everlasting righteousness
[1:09:18] he makes an industry in reconciliation
[1:09:20] and to bring in everlasting
[1:09:22] righteousness when Israel's
[1:09:24] transgression has come to an end
[1:09:26] whereas Israel's transgression come to
[1:09:29] an end right here no it's right here
[1:09:30] Israel the people right because remember
[1:09:36] look a city can't transgress it's the
[1:09:41] people in the city but according to
[1:09:44] Daniel that's got to build the people
[1:09:46] back up and the city back up a physical
[1:09:47] city alright
[1:09:51] so now watch now we're going I want you
[1:09:53] to catch this because when we bring that
[1:09:54] woman and the Dragon cast out you're
[1:09:56] going to come right back to this same
[1:09:58] scripture be sure to put it down down
[1:10:00] then read when Israel's transgression
[1:10:02] has come to an end Satan who's their
[1:10:04] accuser an hour accuser Satan will be
[1:10:06] sealed up in the bottomless pit when
[1:10:08] what when bringing in everlasting
[1:10:10] righteousness something that cannot in
[1:10:12] all because unrighteousness will be done
[1:10:15] away with it already has for the people
[1:10:20] they're already gone but they gotta
[1:10:24] somewheres got to come back to bring in
[1:10:26] everlasting righteousness Satan can't be
[1:10:28] running around during this time he's
[1:10:31] sealed in the bottomless pit
[1:10:40] revelations 20 verse 1 and I saw an
[1:10:44] angel come down from heaven having the
[1:10:45] key of the bottomless pit and a great
[1:10:47] chain in his hand he laid hold on the
[1:10:49] dragon that old serpent which is the
[1:10:51] devil and Satan and bound him a thousand
[1:10:53] years and cast him into the bottomless
[1:10:54] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[1:10:57] him that he should deceive that he
[1:10:59] should deceive the nation's No More till
[1:11:02] the thousand years should be fulfilled
[1:11:03] and after that he must be loosed a
[1:11:06] little season
[1:11:08] ibaka 2 verse 12 says woe to them that
[1:11:11] build if the town was blood and
[1:11:12] stablished a city by iniquity remember
[1:11:16] this city is not going to be built by
[1:11:18] blood and by an iniquity the this new
[1:11:23] city this new temple that's going to be
[1:11:25] in this millennium is going to be built
[1:11:27] by 144,000 Jews that are born again
[1:11:31] we're not building a temple no me and
[1:11:37] Jim been made forty years I can remember
[1:11:39] our wedding night oh you can but the
[1:11:42] next morning we didn't get up build a
[1:11:44] house no maybe later on but not for a
[1:11:49] honeymoon and that's what we're on a
[1:11:51] honeymoon we're gonna build houses
[1:11:53] we don't eat listen we don't even know
[1:11:54] how to build a temple we don't need one
[1:11:57] they need one we don't we are the temple
[1:12:00] of God they have to have a temple
[1:12:03] because the Bible says they did woe to
[1:12:07] them that build up the town with blood
[1:12:09] and stablished the city by iniquity
[1:12:10] behold it is not of the Lord of hosts
[1:12:13] that the people shall labor in the very
[1:12:15] fire and the people shall worry
[1:12:17] themselves for very vanity but the earth
[1:12:19] shall be filled with the knowledge of
[1:12:21] the glory of the Lord as the waters
[1:12:23] cover the sea that's going to happen
[1:12:26] when we come to this bringing in
[1:12:28] everlasting righteousness oh my next
[1:12:31] quote whoa in other words number 10 when
[1:12:34] the enemy has been put away the end of
[1:12:36] sin has come the bringing in of
[1:12:39] everlasting righteousness has come Satan
[1:12:42] is sealed up in the bottomless pit and
[1:12:44] the knowledge of the Lord shall cover
[1:12:45] the earth as the waters cover the sea
[1:12:47] amen glory to god it's coming brother
[1:12:49] it's coming women will be ladies and men
[1:12:51] will be gentlemen amen when the dollars
[1:12:53] of the lordship
[1:12:54] fill the earth to see in the sky all my
[1:12:55] heart is groaning crying for that day of
[1:12:57] sweet release when our Jesus shall come
[1:13:00] back to earth again all right now the
[1:13:02] millenniums in his own when the city is
[1:13:04] to be built forth he's dumb about number
[1:13:07] four so when the city is to be built so
[1:13:10] you can't put these over here and have a
[1:13:12] city built and then destroy it you got a
[1:13:14] thing called the Battle of Armageddon
[1:13:15] standing in your face all right I hope
[1:13:18] you get that all right everybody okay
[1:13:23] all of you that are awake oh okay one's
[1:13:26] your sleep didn't hear what I said
[1:13:27] number five seal up the vision and
[1:13:29] prophecy number eleven what is it oh
[1:13:33] hallelujah do you see it class this
[1:13:35] revelation of Jesus crossing of his
[1:13:37] power and his coming of the end time was
[1:13:39] sealed up until this time that's what he
[1:13:43] comes to do is hit from the scholars no
[1:13:45] wonder they want to apply sealing it
[1:13:46] back yonder to those prophets and
[1:13:48] everything way back it won't hold water
[1:13:50] but this vision has been sealed too
[1:13:52] right now here now and there's where I'm
[1:13:54] placing my faith that God will reveal
[1:13:56] them seventy weeks and then seal it up
[1:13:58] till the end time close up the words and
[1:14:00] seal the book until the end time what
[1:14:02] did he do to seal up the vision and
[1:14:04] prophecy Daniel had prophesied these
[1:14:06] things he had saw it in a vision and the
[1:14:08] angel came down to seal the vision and
[1:14:10] seal the prophecy they can read it but
[1:14:12] they can't understand it until the end
[1:14:14] time and I wrote myself a note know
[1:14:16] where you're staying and that's what it
[1:14:18] is you'll know where you stand when you
[1:14:20] come to this seal up words he sealed up
[1:14:22] now and you he sealed up in you the
[1:14:26] world don't know you no more you don't
[1:14:29] know the world anymore but here what you
[1:14:32] say well what's that got to do with the
[1:14:33] look there's something sealed up in this
[1:14:37] group of people right here that we don't
[1:14:39] know anything about that's Ezekiel 40
[1:14:43] through 44
[1:14:45] you and I are not required to know
[1:14:48] Ezekiel 42 44
[1:14:51] read Ezekiel 42 44 it gives you exact
[1:14:54] dimensions but they know what it's
[1:14:57] talking about and it's sealed up until
[1:14:58] they come back and build that temple and
[1:15:00] they keep building over here they got to
[1:15:03] build it over here in that last week
[1:15:06] 1260 days
[1:15:07] here you got 1260 days here pretty
[1:15:10] simple to me you'll know where you stand
[1:15:13] but now look at number six number six is
[1:15:16] the great one because no man listen no
[1:15:18] man people have probed at all these
[1:15:21] different things but it took a prophet
[1:15:22] to tell us what that said because it
[1:15:26] says to what to anoint the most holy
[1:15:28] look at number 12 now to anoint the most
[1:15:31] holy then this may it be a little bit
[1:15:33] strange for just a minute too many of
[1:15:35] you teachers but I just hold on just a
[1:15:37] minute let's see how it comes out this
[1:15:39] is the anointing not of a man Jesus is
[1:15:43] already anointed there right the book of
[1:15:47] I said that God anointed Jesus with the
[1:15:49] Holy Ghost and went around doing good
[1:15:50] and healing the sick and so forth let me
[1:15:53] interject something here
[1:15:54] you were already anointed you're already
[1:15:58] anointed you're anointed for the message
[1:16:01] of your age and is that anointing gonna
[1:16:04] come off of you know oh it's gonna stay
[1:16:06] on you the book of Acts says Jesus was
[1:16:09] anointed with holy ghost went around
[1:16:10] doing good healing and so forth Jesus is
[1:16:12] already he is Messiah and Messiah means
[1:16:15] The Anointed One now this says in North
[1:16:17] among Seoul is that right be here at the
[1:16:19] time he's to anoint but here at the end
[1:16:22] time he's to anoint the most holy
[1:16:24] now look when he talks about end time
[1:16:27] your and my brain goes right back to
[1:16:30] right here that's not the end time right
[1:16:36] that's the consummation that's the end
[1:16:38] time where there's nothing go live on
[1:16:42] the earth but true morning in Holy Ghost
[1:16:46] fill people amen amen
[1:16:52] so the end time to me is right here
[1:16:55] because when that earth gets cleaned off
[1:16:57] and this new temple comes like we'll
[1:16:59] read it next but probably Wednesday
[1:17:01] night about what brother Brian talks
[1:17:02] about the millennium that millennium
[1:17:04] sets in time that's a thousand years of
[1:17:06] just total rest and relaxation for you
[1:17:11] and I and for the Jews amen but there's
[1:17:16] going to be a temple built folks and it
[1:17:18] we're not gonna build it
[1:17:21] you know mama did help daddy build on
[1:17:24] what houses he built that was his bride
[1:17:27] that was natural but God's not gonna
[1:17:28] require us to build houses amen
[1:17:33] in the future home yeah thank you lord
[1:17:36] daddy's built three or four in the
[1:17:38] future home you know what it's already
[1:17:40] built you built it he built it to your
[1:17:44] specifications amen so this is the
[1:17:48] anointing not of a man Jesus is already
[1:17:50] he is Messiah you know what brother
[1:17:52] Graham is doing he's saying okay if this
[1:17:54] isn't north the most holy
[1:17:55] he said take Jesus out of your mind cuz
[1:17:57] he's already anointed you see what he's
[1:18:00] doing he's pulling it apart so there can
[1:18:02] only be one answer at the end of this
[1:18:03] thing because remember the tiber not he
[1:18:06] said oh that's the tavern I know
[1:18:09] Tabernacle was anointed back in in Moses
[1:18:12] this time and Solomon's time I mean and
[1:18:16] it never was unordered again watch I'll
[1:18:19] read it right here Messiah means The
[1:18:21] Anointed One is that right but here at
[1:18:22] the end time he's true anoint the most
[1:18:24] holy what is the most holy to my way of
[1:18:27] seeing in which I believe I can prove by
[1:18:29] the scripture is to anoint the most holy
[1:18:32] which will be the tabernacle that'll be
[1:18:35] used during the Millennium that's right
[1:18:37] here not right here
[1:18:39] that's right here all right now listen
[1:18:43] and see when I get it described in
[1:18:46] Ezekiel the fourth chapter no I mean the
[1:18:48] 43rd chapter 1st through 6th verse then
[1:18:51] he goes back to Ezekiel and talks about
[1:18:52] the Millennium a little bit here now and
[1:18:54] see what's going to do in the Millennium
[1:18:55] anointing then he keeps going if you
[1:18:58] want to read it yourself save time
[1:18:59] afterwards he said paragraph 119 now
[1:19:01] watch
[1:19:02] description of the temple that is to be
[1:19:04] built in the Millennium now anyone any
[1:19:07] reader that knows that from Ezekiel the
[1:19:08] fortieth chapter until the 44th chapter
[1:19:10] there's nothing but in the world but the
[1:19:12] Millennial temple being erected this one
[1:19:16] doesn't come down out of heaven and just
[1:19:19] sits on the earth they built this thing
[1:19:21] you say what are they gonna build it
[1:19:23] with none of my business
[1:19:24] I'm bride remember bride don't build it
[1:19:29] we just come down and enjoy
[1:19:32] they've already bailed I'm telling this
[1:19:35] is the Bible nothing the world but the
[1:19:37] Millennial temple being erected on earth
[1:19:39] anyone knows that see when the glory of
[1:19:42] the Lord fills it and so forth like that
[1:19:44] now we're going to just describe the
[1:19:46] temple in the 43rd chapter 1st through
[1:19:48] 6th verse so let's read it afterwards he
[1:19:50] brought me to the gate even the gate
[1:19:51] that looking toward the east in it funny
[1:19:53] the eastern gate where's Christ gonna
[1:19:57] come through the eastern gate but he's
[1:19:59] not gonna be by himself and behold the
[1:20:03] glory of the God of Israel came from the
[1:20:05] way of the east and his voice was like
[1:20:08] as the noise of many water so it went
[1:20:10] just one person what is waters people
[1:20:13] right noise of many waters in the earth
[1:20:16] shined with his glory and it was
[1:20:18] according to the appearance of the
[1:20:20] vision which I saw even according to the
[1:20:21] vision I saw when I came when I came to
[1:20:24] destroy the city and the visions were
[1:20:26] like the visions that I saw by the river
[1:20:28] Chebar and I fell on my face and the
[1:20:30] glory of the Lord came into the house by
[1:20:32] the way of the gate whose prospect is
[1:20:33] toward the east so the spirit took me up
[1:20:36] and brought me into the inner court and
[1:20:39] behold the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:20:41] house that's what brother bran was
[1:20:43] talking about now let's go to 2nd
[1:20:45] chronicles chronicles watch it came even
[1:20:48] to pass that the trumpet ears and
[1:20:49] singers were as one to make one sound to
[1:20:52] be heard in praising thanking God Lord
[1:20:54] then they lifted up their voice with the
[1:20:56] trumpet and cymbals and instruments of
[1:20:57] music and praise the Lord saying for he
[1:20:59] is good for his mercy and do it forever
[1:21:01] then the house was filled with the cloud
[1:21:03] even the house of the Lord so that the
[1:21:05] priest could not stand to Minister by
[1:21:07] reason of the cloud for the glory of the
[1:21:09] Lord had filled the house of God what's
[1:21:11] brother I'm telling us now he sent out
[1:21:12] the North the most holy it's not Jesus
[1:21:14] he's already anointed this temple
[1:21:19] he's already been anointed so we're
[1:21:22] gonna move it out of the way so what's
[1:21:24] gonna be anointed there's only one thing
[1:21:26] left me and you God came into the
[1:21:32] sanctuary that was to be anointed and
[1:21:34] was given over are you going to go to
[1:21:36] the next one number 13 mmm God came into
[1:21:41] the sanctuary that was to be anointed
[1:21:42] and was given over to him for the people
[1:21:44] to come to worship so to anoint not thy
[1:21:47] holy place but to anoint the most holy
[1:21:50] place and we noticed that New Jerusalem
[1:21:52] is the most holy place and the anointing
[1:21:55] will be upon the New Jerusalem that
[1:21:57] sends from God out of heaven now watch
[1:21:59] he's using this what he comes forward
[1:22:01] and you say well that's got to be the
[1:22:03] future home but watch prepared as a
[1:22:05] bride adorned for her husband the
[1:22:07] anointing will be upon them he's telling
[1:22:09] us about revelations what is it 22 over
[1:22:12] the but watch now he comes back though
[1:22:14] now when zerubabbel dedicated his temple
[1:22:19] after it was rebuilt it was not anointed
[1:22:21] again because it was already been
[1:22:24] anointed and been tore down or it was
[1:22:26] just instructed again the destruction
[1:22:28] had it come to it it had been instructed
[1:22:31] again and put up so there was no
[1:22:33] anointing of it anymore when it was one
[1:22:36] time anointed that carried on through
[1:22:38] and it goes on till this very time but
[1:22:42] when God sets up the Millennial temple
[1:22:44] he will anoint the most holy not the
[1:22:47] holy but the most holy but when the King
[1:22:51] takes his throne for 1,000 years
[1:22:53] remember is he's not gonna be alone
[1:22:56] there's going to be a queen there and
[1:23:00] then there's going to be a queen there
[1:23:01] Gloria she's over now the anointing of
[1:23:03] the most-holy will be the last thing
[1:23:05] take place when the tabernacle is
[1:23:08] erected the resurrection has come the
[1:23:12] Jews has returned Christ and his bride
[1:23:14] has come the Jews 144,000 are sealed the
[1:23:18] Millennium has taken place there will be
[1:23:20] an anointing when the most holy place
[1:23:22] will be anointed the holy holiest of
[1:23:25] Holies and the most holy when the most
[1:23:27] holy place is a sanctuary where God
[1:23:29] lived between the cherubims
[1:23:31] this time Christ will sit in the most
[1:23:33] holy place with the anointing upon him
[1:23:35] now he gonna be by itself crosses never
[1:23:40] myself anymore he's got a bride and they
[1:23:44] don't need no son for the lamb in the
[1:23:45] midst of the city shall be the light the
[1:23:47] Sun will never go down in that city is
[1:23:49] Uncle Jim used to say and it never will

[1:27:59] vision and prophecy of these 144,000 are
[1:28:01] going to come back according to Ezekiel
[1:28:03] 40 build the temple and then the
[1:28:05] anointing to the temple according to
[1:28:07] what brother Branham just said is not
[1:28:08] Jesus
[1:28:09] he's already anointed it's not the
[1:28:11] temple it's already anointed but there's
[1:28:14] an extra person gonna come back into
[1:28:15] this one
[1:28:16] that's being you that's me and you
[1:28:19] riding back in Revelations 1921 to sit
[1:28:22] with him and we're going to walk right
[1:28:24] into that temple and you know what not
[1:28:26] only Jesus Christ is gonna shine no
[1:28:29] you're gonna be shining - you're the
[1:28:32] shining light today aren't you
[1:28:34] then you're gonna be the shining light
[1:28:35] of that temple you ain't kidding what a
[1:28:40] mighty God we serve you're right sister
[1:28:43] but now we'll start Wednesday we'll talk
[1:28:46] about the Battle of Armageddon and maybe
[1:28:47] a little bit about the millennium then
[1:28:48] we're gonna back up and go all the way
[1:28:50] back to Daniel 70 we've but remembering
[1:28:53] we're going in Revelations 401 and don't
[1:28:55] come back to 1921 so all these things is
[1:28:59] going to happen it's going to be a
[1:29:00] Jewish happening doesn't matter you say
[1:29:03] well what about it we come in biting it
[1:29:04] listen just for a second brother Branham
[1:29:09] says we have a wedding supper for three
[1:29:12] and a half years that is not in the
[1:29:13] Bible it says we go to the marriage
[1:29:18] supper of the lamb it didn't say how
[1:29:19] long but we know we're not going to be
[1:29:22] here for 1260 days for sure and we may
[1:29:26] not come back the way over here so it
[1:29:28] really doesn't matter like I said before
[1:29:31] we could listen you and I could come off
[1:29:34] right here a glorified body we could
[1:29:37] come back right here while they're
[1:29:39] dropping the bombs in the middle of
[1:29:41] Israel and it will not hurt us so what
[1:29:45] are you worried about well what do we
[1:29:47] got what does it matter well what we
[1:29:49] gonna get lost during this time and no
[1:29:52] remember Joseph sent the brides of the
[1:29:56] palace he come back down introduced
[1:30:00] itself to his brothers amen
[1:30:04] introduced itself to his brothers they
[1:30:06] mourned they said how did you know he
[1:30:10] said what remember it was seven years
[1:30:13] they had seven years of good in seven
[1:30:15] years of drought and he said it was to
[1:30:17] preserve you what that seven years of
[1:30:20] good he gave them so much provisions he
[1:30:24] gave Joseph a dream to put all this
[1:30:26] store all this food up to last them for
[1:30:28] seven years of
[1:30:29] drought it's a part of the drought
[1:30:32] that's coming amen so everybody got that
[1:30:35] say man so that's the six fold purpose
[1:30:37] that's the whole purpose the nine you
[1:30:39] said many weeks if you don't get
[1:30:40] anything else forget about days and
[1:30:41] times but we'll get into that but one
[1:30:43] week equals seven years he shall what
[1:30:46] confirms them coming up with many for
[1:30:48] one week and we will not be here when
[1:30:50] that covenant is signed so that whole
[1:30:53] week is for them the seven years and
[1:30:55] then we ride back into here
[1:30:59] right with our bride I'm our bridegroom
[1:31:02] the bride and brought them together now
[1:31:05] I want to cover something just for about
[1:31:07] 10 minutes somebody asked a question
[1:31:09] online about and we usually don't answer
[1:31:14] these but I think this one can be
[1:31:15] answered and you're gonna have to you
[1:31:19] gonna have to run it through your filter
[1:31:20] the question was I have said it and
[1:31:24] brother Dale said it many times and even
[1:31:27] brother branham because they got quotes
[1:31:28] here and they're gonna pull them up
[1:31:30] number one the question was is where are
[1:31:32] the seven churches in the Old Testament
[1:31:35] brother Branham says and I'm gonna read
[1:31:37] around here that there's seven churches
[1:31:39] listen that's what the count of states
[1:31:41] come from the camel states for in the
[1:31:43] Old Testament
[1:31:44] alright so kick yourself for a minute
[1:31:46] and pinch yourself for a minute and
[1:31:47] let's go through this the question was
[1:31:50] is where are the seven churches in the
[1:31:53] Old Testament now listen I don't think
[1:31:57] you can put them exactly that Paul
[1:31:59] taught this one I rainiest out this one
[1:32:01] persons but there are things that happen
[1:32:04] remember who was the pattern messenger
[1:32:07] for all seven church ages Paul Paul was
[1:32:10] the pattern messenger for all seven
[1:32:12] Church ages brother Branham took them
[1:32:14] all back to Paul right cuz remember he
[1:32:17] tried Polycarp that one time and
[1:32:19] Polycarp leaned a little more toward
[1:32:20] organization so he chose Irina's who
[1:32:23] stood against that like Paul did all
[1:32:25] right so let's read this right here so
[1:32:26] the question that the brother had was
[1:32:28] where are the seven churches in the Old
[1:32:31] Testament
[1:32:32] alright let's read these quotes and then
[1:32:33] I'm going to make up a couple comments
[1:32:35] and then we'll take communion that all
[1:32:36] right if you've got an ailment god heal
[1:32:39] you in the next ten minutes alright in
[1:32:41] the Old Testament if the Lord allows
[1:32:44] willing maybe in the coming service I'd
[1:32:47] like to show how that the seven church
[1:32:49] ages typed out now see it typed out in
[1:32:52] the Old Testament what an exact like the
[1:32:56] seals topped the church ages but not
[1:32:57] exact remember because the first the
[1:33:00] first three ages top the first seal
[1:33:02] right second seal third seal for seal
[1:33:07] because the rapture takes place in the
[1:33:08] fourth seal so they say it's a parallel
[1:33:12] hi not an exact this person in that
[1:33:14] person so this is you know this is for
[1:33:17] the brother online how that they began
[1:33:20] just exactly like at the beginning of
[1:33:23] the church ages of the Gentile church
[1:33:26] and went right down through a similar
[1:33:28] Dark Age and came out into the glorious
[1:33:31] time of Pentecost at the falling of the
[1:33:33] Holy Spirit in the early church in the
[1:33:35] Jewish dispensation now remember the
[1:33:38] church ages or a Gentile dispensation
[1:33:40] but they parallel themself alright then
[1:33:43] going through another period of the
[1:33:45] Gentile church through a Dark Age and
[1:33:47] then coming out again into the
[1:33:49] millennium at the end
[1:33:51] alright let's read number two the
[1:33:54] prophet Elijah 1954 our text tonight
[1:33:58] deals with an Old Testament character
[1:34:00] and that is the prophet Elijah and then
[1:34:03] the time of our reading was a very dark
[1:34:05] hour in Israel that was a time that a
[1:34:07] great King Ahab right in the Dark Ages
[1:34:11] if I got that same n right in the dark
[1:34:14] ages so right here if you take this is
[1:34:19] Israel here and we're going to do now in
[1:34:24] our seven church ages what was the Dark
[1:34:26] Age it was this one right here right the
[1:34:29] fourth church age the fourth church age
[1:34:31] was the Dark Age will happen church and
[1:34:33] state married each other so what
[1:34:36] happened during the dark ages of the Old
[1:34:38] Testament church ages they have and
[1:34:40] Jezebel married right right here Watch
[1:34:46] right in the dark ages I would say of
[1:34:49] Israel they came to a seizure of
[1:34:52] precision just like the Christian Church
[1:34:55] has so if our church ages like that then
[1:34:57] there's was like the same one there's
[1:34:59] your middle church age all right not
[1:35:01] talking so much of messengers but watch
[1:35:03] how this parallels and I believe about
[1:35:05] the darkest day of Israel was when they
[1:35:07] have was raining and they have been
[1:35:09] married Jezebel and brought our dolla
[1:35:11] tree into the Jewish Church she brought
[1:35:13] in her pagan gods and that was
[1:35:16] duplicated to the Gentiles during the
[1:35:20] Dark Ages when the church married into
[1:35:22] pagan again and brought our dollar tree
[1:35:25] into the church also so everybody we
[1:35:28] would week with let's just let's just
[1:35:30] say now that the Dark Age of the Old
[1:35:33] Testament the the fourth say the fourth
[1:35:36] church age is right there that's a
[1:35:38] happened Jezebel nobody got that saying
[1:35:40] man now we gotta find the one beginning
[1:35:42] and to find the one at the end to watch
[1:35:46] number four or number three went up and
[1:35:50] do number three number three is the
[1:35:52] water of separation 1955 brother Brown
[1:35:55] was talking about this in the fifty no
[1:35:58] that's just speaking of it in the three
[1:35:59] dispensations we would bring it down
[1:36:01] through the Old Testament and through
[1:36:02] the seven church ages for the seven
[1:36:04] strokes and so forth that looking
[1:36:06] through the streets of blood there the
[1:36:08] seven different streaks represented the
[1:36:11] seven church ages Israel natural and the
[1:36:14] Gentile Church in spiritual seven Church
[1:36:18] ages just exactly the same and Israel
[1:36:21] had seven Church ages right in its bloom
[1:36:24] of its best came a having man Jesse but
[1:36:26] American idolatry and brought in
[1:36:28] idolatry and caused idolatry in Israel
[1:36:30] that's their Dark Age so there's the
[1:36:32] same again look we be saying the
[1:36:35] Christian Church did the same thing out
[1:36:36] of the Dark Ages come right in and
[1:36:38] married right into the same thing and
[1:36:40] brought our Dollar Tree into the
[1:36:41] Christian Church just exactly perfectly
[1:36:43] in its middle age everybody got that
[1:36:46] same an all right number four in Shalom
[1:36:49] that Sun is the word of God in the
[1:36:52] beginning God said let there be light
[1:36:53] and when the manifested Word of God when
[1:36:56] the Word of God was manifested there was
[1:36:57] life first God spoke it
[1:37:00] what if it didn't manifest then it
[1:37:02] wasn't light yet but when he's spoken
[1:37:04] and then it was manifested vindicated
[1:37:06] his word was a vindicated light came
[1:37:08] into existence and that's the only way
[1:37:10] it can be done now it's when the word is
[1:37:13] vindicated God's written word vindicated
[1:37:15] and then it shows light
[1:37:17] it's a portion it's a portion is lit are
[1:37:21] put for each age remember I told you
[1:37:24] about brother man said there's a box
[1:37:25] each churches had had a manifestation
[1:37:28] and had an anointing and you couldn't do
[1:37:29] no more than what was in that box
[1:37:31] all right try same way Israel was the
[1:37:33] same way because remember brother mom
[1:37:35] always says Moses is Noah's message and
[1:37:38] Moses is message can't be the same and
[1:37:40] then all right so that's the only way it
[1:37:43] can be done it's when the word is
[1:37:44] vindicated God's written word vindicated
[1:37:46] then it shows like it's a portion is lit
[1:37:49] or put out for each age we find it in
[1:37:52] the church ages we find it in the old
[1:37:55] the Old Testament Church ages each time
[1:37:58] there come a time for a certain
[1:38:00] manifestation of the journey there was a
[1:38:02] prophet came to the earth and when the
[1:38:05] word came to the prophet and he made
[1:38:07] that word live and when that word was
[1:38:09] identified it reflected God and there
[1:38:12] was the the age there was the light
[1:38:14] that's the way light comes today so it
[1:38:18] came under what Paul Iranians Martin
[1:38:21] Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah there
[1:38:24] buddy got that say man all right let's
[1:38:27] read number five now here's where I
[1:38:30] think we're going to see at least the
[1:38:34] beginning and end of the church ages in
[1:38:35] the old testament smyrna church age you
[1:38:41] know what how many times you read church
[1:38:42] days book 25 or 30 40 50 times
[1:38:44] I ain't never read this quote before
[1:38:48] this period Amana Christ is not new this
[1:38:52] is not something that just came in to
[1:38:53] church ages it has been here all along
[1:38:55] to get a clearer understanding of how it
[1:38:57] works how it goes against God and takes
[1:38:59] over the church look at the Old
[1:39:01] Testament and see if there let us
[1:39:03] examine the spirit as it was manifested
[1:39:06] in our Israel as she came out of Egypt
[1:39:08] to be the church and the wilderness
[1:39:11] watch this
[1:39:13] just as the early church now he's
[1:39:16] talking about the early church right
[1:39:18] here just as the early church started
[1:39:24] out under the pure Ministry of the Holy
[1:39:26] Spirit book of Acts that's when the
[1:39:29] church age started right so now we got
[1:39:31] to figure out when the church age
[1:39:32] started for the for the Jewish the Old
[1:39:34] Testament very clear though watch what
[1:39:36] happens he identifies it right here just
[1:39:39] as the early church started out under
[1:39:42] the pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:43] with signs and wonders and
[1:39:45] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[1:39:47] and interpretations wisdom knowledge and
[1:39:49] healing healing so in the days of Israel
[1:39:52] when they left Egypt they were under the
[1:39:57] leadership of the Spirit of God
[1:39:59] manifesting in gifts God was leading the
[1:40:04] people so who was the first church age
[1:40:06] messenger now listen if Paul was the
[1:40:09] pattern messenger for the New Testament
[1:40:12] who in the world pattern the Old
[1:40:14] Testament Moses so here's your first
[1:40:18] church age it started when they left
[1:40:20] Egypt I just read you that quote so
[1:40:23] Moses hey the whole Old Testament
[1:40:26] patterns after Moses so they hold New
[1:40:29] Testament patterns after Paul so to me
[1:40:32] that's the beginning of the church ages
[1:40:34] if brother I'm talking about because
[1:40:35] he's reading it right here look so in
[1:40:38] the days of Israel when they left Egypt
[1:40:40] they were under the leadership of the
[1:40:41] Spirit of God manifesting in gifts God
[1:40:44] was the leader of the people actually he
[1:40:46] was their king he was a father king he
[1:40:48] took care of Israel like a man cares for
[1:40:50] his family he fed them fought their
[1:40:53] battles smoothed away their difficulties
[1:40:55] and settled their problems
[1:40:56] he just busied himself over them they
[1:40:59] were the only nation in which he was
[1:41:00] truly God he was truly God same way in
[1:41:03] the church age remember when you become
[1:41:04] born again in the church age you were
[1:41:05] carrying you were called out of the
[1:41:06] world you called out of the world
[1:41:09] Israel was called out of the world
[1:41:10] Taiping Egypt being called out of Egypt
[1:41:13] and being God's people but look but one
[1:41:16] day they were the only nation in which
[1:41:19] it was truly God but one day they got to
[1:41:22] looking around they saw the Philistines
[1:41:24] and other nations with Kings over them
[1:41:26] that's the same thing happening right
[1:41:27] here
[1:41:29] because they have was the king of Israel
[1:41:32] oh yeah it started back over here as a D
[1:41:35] as a saying as a deed it became a
[1:41:38] doctrine same thing now God was going
[1:41:44] look watch this right here this is neat
[1:41:46] they were the only nation they saw the
[1:41:48] Philistines and other nations were Kings
[1:41:50] over them it caught their eyes and they
[1:41:52] decided that they ought to humanize
[1:41:54] their leadership so they wanted a king
[1:41:58] what did Constantine do he married
[1:42:00] church and state together in that fourth
[1:42:03] Church age now God was going to humanize
[1:42:06] the leadership himself man just wanted
[1:42:12] in a head of God God was going to
[1:42:14] humanize the leadership in the person of
[1:42:16] the Lord Jesus but they got ahead of him
[1:42:20] Satan knew the plan of God so he put it
[1:42:23] in the hearts of the people to get ahead
[1:42:25] of God that's exactly what they did
[1:42:27] right here amen he said okay brother
[1:42:31] wait where's the ending of the church
[1:42:33] age all right let me ask you a question
[1:42:35] in the ending of the Gentile church age
[1:42:37] who shows up Elijah - what
[1:42:46] introduced Christ amen
[1:42:54] who showed up at the end of the Old
[1:42:57] Testament church a to introduce Christ
[1:43:01] Elijah number three so the last church
[1:43:04] age messenger would be John the Baptist
[1:43:09] he said oh nice a New Testament no he
[1:43:12] came in the Old Testament
[1:43:14] - what - introduced Christ
[1:43:18] so there's your church ages now you say
[1:43:21] well well I don't know where the other
[1:43:23] messengers are I just know that Moses
[1:43:25] started it John the Baptist ended it
[1:43:27] Paul started the Gentile church age and
[1:43:30] this part of Elijah that we see now
[1:43:33] ended it because you know what look John
[1:43:36] the Baptist introduced Christ then the
[1:43:38] day of Pentecost come which the day of
[1:43:40] Pentecost then is right here amen
[1:43:44] ties them right together that day seven
[1:43:47] churches in the Old Testament and then
[1:43:48] what happened seven Church ages started
[1:43:50] right on the end of the New Testament
[1:43:54] so there's yo to me that to me I don't
[1:43:57] have a quote but I got one for Moses but
[1:43:59] brother Brian said Moses when they came
[1:44:00] out of Egypt there was your there was
[1:44:02] your first church beginning to start
[1:44:04] then it went the same way if you'll look
[1:44:07] through there and look all the God sent
[1:44:09] a prophet though at all these different
[1:44:11] times
[1:44:13] right I don't know what their names are
[1:44:16] but he put Isaiah Jeremiah all these
[1:44:19] different ones he sent prophets same way
[1:44:22] with here he sent what Paul Iranians
[1:44:24] Martin Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah
[1:44:28] sent the same thing so for the brother
[1:44:31] at just from what I see and my
[1:44:34] understanding that the seven churches in
[1:44:37] the Old Testament began with Moses the
[1:44:40] middle Dark Ages will they have and the
[1:44:42] last church age messenger to the Old
[1:44:43] Testament was John the Baptist because
[1:44:45] he introduced Christ you saw no he
[1:44:48] wasn't in it when did the New Testament
[1:44:51] begin in the book of Acts not in Matthew
[1:44:55] not in mark not in Luke not in John they
[1:44:59] were still under the law now listen they
[1:45:02] wrote it may be after the book of Acts
[1:45:04] because they had to have the Holy Ghost
[1:45:05] erotic but what were they writing they
[1:45:08] were writing a commentary on when Jesus
[1:45:10] was on earth because remember the Bible
[1:45:12] says Christ was born what under the law
[1:45:15] so the law continued all the way to John
[1:45:21] but then the law became Paul and rhiness
[1:45:25] Martin clung all the ones grace the Old
[1:45:28] Testament there's your seven church ages
[1:45:32] now where they are I don't know but I
[1:45:34] know I believe Moses was a pattern
[1:45:36] messenger for it and John the Baptist is
[1:45:38] the one that ended it because he
[1:45:39] introduced Christ just like brother
[1:45:41] Branham came on earth this Elijah what
[1:45:43] do you do he came to what introduce
[1:45:45] Jesus Christ to you and I so let's stand
[1:45:49] our feet maybe that'll help the brother
[1:45:52] answer the question you see I'm not the
[1:45:56] pastor I can answer some questions
[1:45:58] brother Dale's got a target on his back
[1:46:01] to leave the path of the Jerrod's but I
[1:46:02] can I know I really felt he was sincere
[1:46:04] he wanted to know because we quoted all
[1:46:06] the time and even brother Branham quotes
[1:46:08] it likes 9 quotes where he verbatim
[1:46:11] quotes the Old Testament church ages in
[1:46:14] the Old Testament so there had to been
[1:46:16] there had to be 7 for him to say that so
[1:46:21] I just wanted to kind of see if you
[1:46:22] understood that that and that's the
[1:46:25] total continuity of
[1:46:29] he sent prophets to who reveal Christ
[1:46:33] them prophets didn't reveal their self
[1:46:36] all the prophets in the Old Testament
[1:46:38] didn't come to reveal their self they
[1:46:39] pointed to Christ
[1:46:43] all right well okey-dokey listen I got
[1:46:47] to find it now ones in you got it I've
[1:46:53] got it written here but here we go all
[1:46:56] right brother Devils been coughing a
[1:46:57] little bit so we're gonna do this thing
[1:46:58] if you want to turn 2 Corinthians
[1:47:06] Corinthians 11 verse 23 Lord how do you
[1:47:11] read that not mine
[1:47:14] mine are bigger than his you know I got
[1:47:18] my contacts in and I still can't read it
[1:47:20] what a shame that is all right here we
[1:47:22] go oh the order of the Lord's the table
[1:47:27] everybody ready all mines clear we you
[1:47:30] know we love the Lord we love the Lord
[1:47:31] that he can give us these things that we
[1:47:32] can yeah give him a handclaps of praise
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:36] you know we can stand here forever and
[1:47:38] ever and talk about it but unless God
[1:47:40] reveals it to you but you know what it's
[1:47:43] like brother Darrell now we were talking
[1:47:44] not well not long ago we just got it
[1:47:47] we're trying to make this so simple it's
[1:47:49] like you said we're not trying to
[1:47:50] confuse people if you if you're confused
[1:47:52] and you don't study how can the Holy
[1:47:55] Ghost be confused the Holy Ghost can't
[1:47:58] be confused so either you don't have it
[1:48:00] are you not feeding him enough one of
[1:48:03] the two cuz he said he'd lead you and
[1:48:05] guide you into some truth no he said
[1:48:09] I'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:48:10] truth
[1:48:11] all right so if somebody tells you truth
[1:48:14] God order to be able to give you an
[1:48:17] answer and it's a Bible answer not one
[1:48:20] that we just kind of you know that's why
[1:48:22] I said about brother Branham he
[1:48:24] everything he said was scriptural had to
[1:48:27] be where'd he get it from he had to get
[1:48:29] it from the Bible because he's a word
[1:48:31] prophet alright first corinthians verse
[1:48:34] 11 I mean 11 verse 23 for I've received
[1:48:38] of the Lord that was all all
[1:48:40] I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:48:41] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:48:43] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:48:45] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:48:47] body which is broken for you this doing
[1:48:50] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:48:52] also he took the cup and when he had
[1:48:54] supped saying this cup is the New
[1:48:56] Testament in my blood see that's what
[1:48:58] did you test them I started when the
[1:48:59] shed when the blood was shed when the
[1:49:01] teto
[1:49:01] when the test testator died that's when
[1:49:04] the New Testament started right the Old
[1:49:07] Testament was under bulls and goats
[1:49:08] blood they didn't take communion but now
[1:49:12] when the Lamb of God comes he says you
[1:49:16] got to take of me now because I'm the
[1:49:19] one that's going to save you those goats
[1:49:21] and bulls and all that that was fine it
[1:49:23] covers you but it will not save you and
[1:49:26] look this won't save you either but it's
[1:49:27] a symbol that God died for you in human
[1:49:31] flesh like that like that quote I love
[1:49:33] that quote where brother Adam said said
[1:49:35] God was gonna come and humanize himself
[1:49:36] it's just that man wanted to do it you
[1:49:39] know before God was gonna do it because
[1:49:41] he listened Christ was coming on this
[1:49:42] earth regardless of what was going on
[1:49:44] all right he's always wanted to live in
[1:49:47] human flesh always and when he had given
[1:49:51] thanks he breakings to take eat this is
[1:49:53] my body which is broken for you that's
[1:49:54] doing remembers from me and after the
[1:49:56] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:49:58] had supped saying this cup is the New
[1:50:00] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:50:03] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[1:50:05] do we really remember that that night he
[1:50:11] was getting ready to shed his physical
[1:50:13] blood and they were gonna rip his body
[1:50:15] apart before that next morning and
[1:50:17] that's what we're symbolizing that he
[1:50:20] went through that and he's giving it to
[1:50:22] us to partake of it not for taking their
[1:50:26] physical body no where is body now but
[1:50:31] in symbol we can take this and say God
[1:50:33] thank you for doing what you did
[1:50:36] everything we do should be giving the
[1:50:38] thanks to God
[1:50:38] we're as often as you eat this bread and
[1:50:40] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:50:42] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:50:45] shall eat of this bread and drink of
[1:50:47] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:50:49] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:50:51] but let a man examine
[1:50:53] himself and so let him eat a see you can
[1:50:56] examine yourself you so I had this
[1:50:57] problem with soldier brother Bram said
[1:51:00] go ahead and take communion he said but
[1:51:01] you better get it done he said get it
[1:51:03] right get it right because right here
[1:51:05] here is the here's des I say this is the
[1:51:08] out but let a man examine himself and so
[1:51:11] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:51:14] that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:51:16] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:51:18] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:51:21] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:51:24] sickly among you many sleep for if we
[1:51:26] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:51:28] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:51:30] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:51:32] be condemned with the world
[1:51:34] I had a preacher one time tell me so we
[1:51:36] don't take communion till all my people
[1:51:37] think they're ready I said well we would
[1:51:39] never take it we take it the first
[1:51:43] Sunday of every month and I you know
[1:51:45] what I started getting ready lord
[1:51:46] cleaned me out make me wear these hate
[1:51:49] this don't don't wait anyway when we are
[1:51:57] judged we are chastened of the Lord the
[1:51:59] Lord's one who condemned this enemy will
[1:52:01] but we should not be content that we
[1:52:03] should not be condemned with the world
[1:52:04] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:52:06] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:52:09] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:52:11] home and that you come not together into
[1:52:13] condemnation and the rest well I said in
[1:52:14] order when I come let's just have a mole
