[4:36] back where we read this morning and
[4:38] we'll try to have them comments and
[4:40] questions so you get everything ready
[4:43] and just remember
[4:46] to pray one for another and we keep
[4:48] praying for our wife in this time of a
[4:50] problems with the working that knee and
[4:53] things because it's got to be done to be
[4:55] able to make it better for later on you
[4:57] know so it's a hard thing to do but
[5:01] we thank everybody for praying and all
[5:03] that's been done amen Hebrews 11. now
[5:06] remember the announcements remember the
[5:09] ministers meeting will be this coming
[5:11] Saturday to the Ministers of it brother
[5:14] Bill yountz and then remember the
[5:17] fellowship meeting will be at brother
[5:19] Christian's on the 20th
[5:22] so remember that and keep these in mind
[5:26] you know of these meetings and the
[5:28] different things I think that's the main
[5:31] announcements but just keep them all
[5:34] right
[5:35] father we thank you for your love and
[5:37] your grace and kindness we thank you for
[5:39] everything
[5:40] we know and realize that without you
[5:43] there's no hope whatsoever for any of us
[5:47] we just pray that you would help us and
[5:49] guide us now and forgive our sins
[5:52] the thoughts of our minds the things
[5:54] that we think about that are contrary to
[5:57] you and
[5:58] things Lord of life it is not according
[6:01] to you and Walking In Your Love in Your
[6:04] Grace
[6:05] we just ask you father to help us and
[6:07] keep us fill us with love and
[6:10] understanding forgive our sins lead us
[6:13] by thy Grace
[6:15] Lord Just Have Your Way in Jesus name
[6:17] amen
[6:20] okay Hebrews 11.
[6:28] now Faith is the substance to things
[6:29] hoped for
[6:31] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[6:34] it what by faith the elders obtained a
[6:36] good report all right
[6:39] now but then Paul would get on over and
[6:41] he'd say
[6:43] verse 13 of Hebrews what did he say
[6:46] these all died in faith
[6:49] having not received the promises
[6:52] right
[6:54] then he drops over to
[7:00] the 39th verse
[7:03] and he says
[7:04] in all these having obtained a good
[7:07] report
[7:08] through faith
[7:11] receive not the promise
[7:13] that you may be seated the Lord had his
[7:15] Blessing to the reading of the word
[7:18] now I pray that this
[7:21] part has been
[7:23] at least an eye-opener to you to
[7:26] help you to understand and
[7:29] you know
[7:30] that we spent a lot of time and doings
[7:34] in it but uh I pray that it would help
[7:37] you
[7:38] but my point was in this morning you
[7:40] know we had some company different
[7:41] things and
[7:43] so you kind of change things a little
[7:45] bit
[7:46] but so you get ready for your comments
[7:49] and your questions
[7:50] about what we're talking about
[7:54] but what has been the theme of what
[7:57] we've been speaking of
[8:00] is for you and I
[8:05] not to
[8:08] necessarily look back and recognize
[8:13] you know everything and see everything
[8:15] and that's well and good you know
[8:17] because that's the background
[8:20] but to recognize and see who we are
[8:24] and what we're doing here
[8:27] because our Point has been what that
[8:31] uh no one in the Bible or no one of
[8:33] anything has ever amounted anything
[8:35] without a positive attitude
[8:38] you know to be positive about it be you
[8:41] know be certain about it
[8:44] and uh you know it will turn out
[8:47] in the correct way if we put the right
[8:49] mind to it because the prophet would say
[8:51] write me in latitude
[8:54] toward any promise so bring it to pies
[8:57] well but recognizing all of those and
[9:01] seeing all of those down through the
[9:03] Bible
[9:04] and then coming down to the end time to
[9:07] talk about the prophet and the the signs
[9:11] and the Wonders and the things that that
[9:14] you know has taken place
[9:17] or did through the ministry
[9:19] and then uh you know if that's all we
[9:23] can talk about
[9:26] then uh
[9:29] you know
[9:30] I believe we're missing the theme of the
[9:32] whole thing
[9:34] I thought all of that
[9:37] was to build up
[9:40] our faith
[9:44] into realizing Who We Are
[9:47] all right
[9:48] and then as I've emphasized now a couple
[9:51] of messages
[9:52] that Paul talks about
[9:55] these obtaining
[9:58] you know the position
[10:00] but then turned around and says they
[10:02] didn't Attain
[10:04] well that's
[10:06] you know that sounds kind of a little
[10:08] contradictory
[10:10] but it's true
[10:12] they did attain unto what God promised
[10:15] them
[10:17] for the day they were living in the time
[10:20] all right
[10:21] and then in doing that
[10:26] see that's a great faith Builder
[10:30] for you and I
[10:32] that we can look back and see they did a
[10:34] Time
[10:35] but then also to realize that
[10:38] there was something they didn't attain
[10:40] them to
[10:42] you know
[10:43] and to see that
[10:46] we would have something to do with
[10:49] the ending up or bringing them to a
[10:52] completion or Perfection not as we try
[10:56] to make them perfect
[10:57] but as a completion or a finish
[11:00] of what they should have done
[11:04] but to see and I hope you follow that
[11:06] line
[11:07] that as we ended up at the end this
[11:10] morning
[11:12] through their unbelief
[11:16] the mercy of God was extended to you and
[11:19] I
[11:20] know all right
[11:22] then and the point was that
[11:27] if that brings Mercy to you and I why
[11:30] wouldn't we have mercy for others
[11:33] all right and in doing it
[11:37] that we would have a
[11:41] a park to do with this
[11:44] you know by them turning down did you
[11:47] follow the thought whether you believe
[11:49] it or not just let you just have to pray
[11:52] anyway because I can't reveal it
[11:54] but to know that
[11:58] they turned down the gospel Israel
[12:02] all right
[12:04] and we accepted it
[12:07] right
[12:08] what if we had not have accepted it
[12:13] where would we be
[12:15] all right
[12:16] but what if they have accepted it
[12:21] where would we be
[12:24] all right
[12:25] so then it's a wonderful opportunity for
[12:28] you and I to
[12:30] be able to understand the whole layout
[12:33] of the Bible
[12:35] and to see doing it but see then
[12:38] everything points to you and I
[12:45] because
[12:46] all before us
[12:50] could not be made perfect
[12:52] Without You and I
[12:55] now could not be made complete could not
[12:58] be brought to a end of what they were
[13:01] supposed to have been brought
[13:05] all right and I don't have that wording
[13:08] I don't know how the education to
[13:10] express it just my own thoughts
[13:14] but when they turned down the gospel
[13:17] and the Gentiles received it
[13:20] it put Israel in a blinded state
[13:25] all right
[13:27] and when it did
[13:30] you and I would be able to run that into
[13:33] the prophet's message and study it just
[13:35] look so you say no no no Israel God
[13:39] didn't blind Israel brother Ryan said
[13:40] God put his hand over Israel's eyes
[13:45] he blinded them
[13:48] why
[13:50] because he knew we would come in
[13:55] now don't you think
[13:58] don't you think
[14:00] that God would have the ability
[14:03] to enter into
[14:08] um
[14:08] a person
[14:11] and explain what he wanted to
[14:16] come on now don't you believe God would
[14:17] have that ability
[14:19] I believe he could take a dog and make
[14:21] it do what he wanted it to do
[14:23] all right you know
[14:26] but see if you'll study on it you'll
[14:28] find the prophet saying
[14:31] that when Jesus kept saying son of man
[14:37] I was just looking at it a moment ago
[14:39] you know
[14:40] he said Israel couldn't understand that
[14:46] because they they couldn't comprehend
[14:49] you know why he would say son of man
[14:54] all right and that was the secret that
[14:57] was hidden down through
[14:59] all of the ages
[15:01] and came out in the end time with this
[15:03] prophet
[15:07] in probably 1947 when he first started
[15:11] you know that we out of the records of
[15:12] the tapes that recorded that he probably
[15:16] mentioned son of man then
[15:19] you know
[15:21] but do we understand it
[15:26] because he said that Israel was blinded
[15:28] because of him coming
[15:33] exactly the way the word City would come
[15:40] all right
[15:41] so now sure there was a lot of people
[15:43] that blinded their own selves
[15:48] this agent where we're at the Gentiles
[15:52] the biggest portion of the people are
[15:54] blinded to the truth
[15:56] right
[16:00] because it came the way
[16:02] that he came
[16:05] right
[16:06] we were talking about it last night in
[16:08] the Bible study
[16:10] I know maybe my mind is all
[16:13] I don't know maybe I'm just gone wacky
[16:15] studying the word of God but leave me
[16:18] alone I'm happy
[16:19] I may be wacky but I'm happy
[16:22] all right
[16:23] we were talking about last night
[16:25] what do you think about the 300
[16:27] ministers
[16:29] who questioned brother random about
[16:33] the water baptism
[16:35] you remember
[16:37] when he got to explaining it
[16:40] they said we want the tapes
[16:44] we are going to get baptized
[16:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:50] and we want those tapes for the people
[16:53] he said not one
[16:57] minister
[17:00] now
[17:04] I was expressing it to him last night
[17:08] do you think those 300 preachers went
[17:11] home and taught their people
[17:14] about water baptism
[17:18] I don't think they did you know
[17:21] I don't think the water baptism was
[17:24] mentioned that away if it was it was
[17:27] mentioned in the point that
[17:29] we proved him wrong
[17:33] we're going to stay with father-son Holy
[17:35] Ghost
[17:37] see they were blinded
[17:42] blinded to the truth
[17:44] well you know what that done to the
[17:46] people
[17:47] blinded to people
[17:50] right all right
[17:52] and like us telling them
[17:56] it took a a man with
[17:59] like brother Brandon with no education
[18:01] of things
[18:03] and I know you've heard me say this
[18:05] hundreds of times
[18:08] but when brother moat said why do you
[18:10] believe about the godhead
[18:12] I said God in three persons Blessed
[18:14] Trinity
[18:16] he said you're a trinity like everybody
[18:18] else I said explain yourself sir
[18:22] he said you're a father you're a son
[18:24] you're a human
[18:26] but there's not three people of you
[18:29] there's only one
[18:31] we're talking about dire in the
[18:33] scriptures where it says even the
[18:35] Eternal godhead could be understood by
[18:37] the things that you see
[18:40] what about how simple brother random
[18:42] could make it
[18:47] explaining a father a son
[18:50] and the Holy Ghost as
[18:52] a father a human being a person a
[18:55] and you being one
[19:01] but because of our educated mind
[19:05] you know what that done that blinded
[19:07] people
[19:09] right
[19:11] to the truth
[19:14] what we've been taught is what's
[19:15] blinding us
[19:17] right
[19:20] Israel had it figured out as I said this
[19:23] morning
[19:23] this group had it that way this group
[19:25] had it done with that group had one and
[19:27] because he didn't come that way
[19:30] they were blinded
[19:34] to the truth
[19:37] but you know what he came exactly
[19:40] the way the word
[19:42] said he would come
[19:47] now is it true
[19:52] that according to Malachi 4
[19:57] that we were promised in the last days
[20:01] a prophet would come
[20:04] is that true
[20:06] you know
[20:09] and you know what by coming the way he
[20:10] come
[20:12] people wouldn't have it
[20:15] but if he'd come as a great Billy Graham
[20:17] or Robert's great
[20:21] compromiser
[20:24] they would have accepted it
[20:28] but because of him being the way he was
[20:31] it blinded the people
[20:35] and they wouldn't have it
[20:42] but you think about it Church
[20:45] I got this message
[20:47] I was going to preach it this evening
[20:49] but
[20:50] I had
[20:51] we better stay with the comments and
[20:52] questions a little bit
[20:56] but I wish you would think about it
[20:58] until next weekend
[21:00] Lord willing to fail
[21:06] what's the greatest thing of sin
[21:10] what's the greatest sin you could think
[21:11] of
[21:17] I wish you would just put that down and
[21:19] think about it for a week
[21:22] what is the greatest sin you could think
[21:25] of
[21:26] when we know it's not drinking gambling
[21:28] smoke and run around with women
[21:30] homosexuality perverts
[21:33] it's not that
[21:38] brother Dale I've not sinned in 40 years
[21:41] you know
[21:46] but I just don't believe that
[21:48] you're talking about that one God I just
[21:50] don't believe it when you're the biggest
[21:52] sinner there is to think on those things
[21:59] but think about
[22:03] what happened
[22:06] to Israel
[22:09] and it blinded them
[22:11] by him coming the way he said he would
[22:13] come
[22:15] then wouldn't it end up in the same way
[22:17] to the Gentiles
[22:20] by him saying the way he'd come
[22:24] and he came that away
[22:26] that it would blind again
[22:29] some are blinded willingly
[22:34] all right
[22:36] and some of natural Israel back there
[22:39] were blinded willingly
[22:44] because even gamelion
[22:46] in Nicodemus you know gamaya would say
[22:50] you better leave this alone
[22:53] if it be of God you're fighting God
[22:57] if not it'll come to all you know not
[23:01] it'll come no good
[23:04] and you know what
[23:08] what if we are that blind today
[23:13] but what do you mean brother Dale we
[23:14] studied the message we do
[23:17] why are there so many different
[23:19] doctrines
[23:22] from the one message
[23:27] what don't you think that brother
[23:29] so-and-so had the right to believe what
[23:30] he wants to sure that's the Constitution
[23:33] says it
[23:34] but the Bible don't
[23:37] there's no scripture in the Bible it
[23:39] says
[23:40] it's one Faith one Lord one baptism one
[23:44] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[23:46] right
[23:50] but that's just the way he sees it
[23:56] all right
[23:58] I believe in
[24:00] was asked the question about it I
[24:02] believe in
[24:04] everybody I I don't believe everybody
[24:06] believes you know is identical
[24:09] no we sat down and talked we're going to
[24:12] find a place that we don't agree
[24:16] you know
[24:17] what are we going to split
[24:20] and refuse to
[24:23] listen to the other person
[24:26] if we do we made a denomination
[24:29] because we denominated we die
[24:32] all right
[24:34] if you see
[24:36] blindness then is covered in a lot of
[24:39] ways
[24:42] some are willingly blind willingly
[24:44] ignorant the Bible says
[24:47] but some are blinded because God done
[24:50] that
[24:53] but get to point that it's not that God
[24:56] just
[24:57] oh this blinds you
[25:01] that's not
[25:03] I mean I don't I don't look at that away
[25:06] he said I'm going to come the way the
[25:08] word says I'm going to come you're going
[25:10] to have it figured out your way and
[25:13] that's going to Blind you
[25:15] but said the Gentiles will accept it
[25:19] and that will preserve you
[25:22] to a time that
[25:24] I'll come back to you
[25:27] but he'll never marry Israel back as
[25:29] bride
[25:31] I want any word you can show that in the
[25:34] Bible the prophet's message
[25:37] he won't marry him back his bride
[25:39] because they rejected that
[25:43] and by not being bride they won't be
[25:45] sonship
[25:46] you know they rejected sonship
[25:51] but he gives them a place
[25:55] I've studied the message for all these
[25:57] years and even like the fifth sealed Jew
[25:59] the only thing I can find is one thing
[26:02] where brother around and said they are
[26:04] given white robes under the seventh seal
[26:08] you remember the scripture where they're
[26:09] giving white robes and told to wait a
[26:10] while
[26:11] you know and uh
[26:14] he said under the seventh seal we'll see
[26:16] I don't I don't know what that means
[26:19] do you
[26:22] you know
[26:23] but they are given
[26:27] you and I are not given white robes
[26:32] our white robe is the baptism of the
[26:35] Holy Ghost that's given unto us as a new
[26:38] birth
[26:39] but it's not there later foolish virgins
[26:42] are given eternal life
[26:45] one day
[26:47] but they don't have it now
[26:49] yet they confess it
[26:52] and they die believing it
[26:55] right
[26:58] so then we're in a vast time and a vast
[27:00] doing but I want to make this these few
[27:02] comments and then
[27:06] but have you ever thought about the
[27:07] promises made for this age
[27:13] do you realize if we are the end of all
[27:16] things
[27:17] you know
[27:20] we don't worry about time do we
[27:24] we're not concerned about when
[27:27] we're concerned about what's taking
[27:29] place
[27:32] you realize then that we're promised in
[27:35] this day
[27:38] this is the greatest day
[27:41] that has ever been
[27:44] running around and said if I stood
[27:46] Before Time and God asked me where would
[27:49] you like to live
[27:53] it should have been good in certain ways
[27:55] and certain times
[27:56] but he said let me live down here
[28:01] look but brother there just ain't
[28:03] nothing going on
[28:07] you know
[28:08] I mean nothing's going on
[28:11] we don't see no signs and wonders
[28:16] no wonder
[28:17] I'd run around and said it wouldn't
[28:18] wasn't meant for you
[28:21] well not the way he said it
[28:23] it wasn't meant for you
[28:25] all right
[28:26] but you see we look at things in our own
[28:29] way
[28:31] but yet the promise is made for this age
[28:36] if it was no more
[28:38] than to read Hebrews 11 40.
[28:43] according to my understanding of the
[28:45] English language
[28:48] when you would read that you'd say
[28:50] God having provided some better thing
[28:56] for us
[29:00] that they
[29:02] without us
[29:04] should not be made perfect
[29:08] well you know what that means everybody
[29:10] from here back
[29:15] is that English
[29:17] is that just reading
[29:20] well no it meant for so long here and
[29:25] our salvation
[29:27] is tied to everybody in the world
[29:34] right
[29:37] then
[29:39] everybody's waiting on us
[29:44] well the promises is down here then
[29:49] I would love to live there when Jesus
[29:51] walked on the shores of Galilee wouldn't
[29:53] you sure
[29:55] but you know what I'd have been just
[29:56] like everybody else I'd have been blind
[29:58] as a bat
[29:59] so would have you oh no I would have
[30:02] understood it
[30:04] oh yeah
[30:06] no you'd have been blind
[30:09] it's been on the wrong side
[30:12] we would have been choosing Judas as the
[30:15] great guy
[30:16] right
[30:18] is that the way the prophet said he
[30:20] would have been chosen over the other
[30:24] but what about the promises of this day
[30:26] I'm going to say that
[30:28] and I want to read a couple of quotes
[30:29] and then you get your your uh
[30:32] your questions or comments or whatever
[30:36] go ahead brother if you will pull up
[30:38] number three
[30:39] but I told him I didn't know which way
[30:40] it's going this evening so
[30:42] we'll go this way
[30:44] look at number three on you
[30:48] notes there which is taken from
[30:50] paragraph 367 through 371 of the stature
[30:55] of a perfect man
[30:56] and that's number three now that we're
[30:58] still on the conduct I mean the comments
[31:00] and questions brother like I said I got
[31:03] both Stacks here okay you want to go all
[31:06] evening we'll just stay here and
[31:08] we'll see the Sun go down
[31:10] uh
[31:12] I wouldn't do it would it well look what
[31:14] brought around says now you get it
[31:17] these who these people who died in here
[31:21] are depending and waiting on us
[31:24] so this church has got to come to
[31:27] perfection
[31:28] in order to bring the resurrection
[31:32] now that kind of looks like it's
[31:34] dependent upon
[31:36] somebody reaching perfection
[31:38] right
[31:41] and look at you goes back and and
[31:44] they're sold under the altar waiting for
[31:47] this church to come to its perfection
[31:50] that when Christ does come
[31:53] he explains it getting smaller doing how
[31:56] it works and how that it comes
[31:59] but I'm just interested in the promises
[32:01] go to the next one number four this has
[32:04] taken what was the Holy Ghost given for
[32:06] paragraph 51.
[32:09] they didn't underline it I didn't
[32:11] underline this for them so I'll have to
[32:12] pick the spot
[32:15] but when
[32:17] we need it we're at
[32:20] what's he doing he's pouring in his
[32:22] spirit and those who are resting out
[32:24] under in the grave are under the altar
[32:27] of God as the scripture said or crying
[32:30] how long how long how much longer God's
[32:34] waiting on me in you the church is
[32:38] waiting on me and you adoption time when
[32:42] God can pour into us his fullness
[32:45] his power his resurrection that when the
[32:48] church in Christ becomes so close
[32:50] together till Christ becomes visible
[32:52] Among Us
[32:53] and raises the Dead
[32:56] and we're going to rapture
[32:59] the promises
[33:00] for this hour
[33:03] promises to you and I
[33:07] look at number five which assured we
[33:09] would see Jesus
[33:14] e 13.
[33:16] we're living in the day that the Gospel
[33:19] made many great promises for this day
[33:22] now is those promises true
[33:26] and if they are then we should live by
[33:28] them if they're not true we should get
[33:31] away from them and find out what is true
[33:35] now for me to walk out here today and
[33:37] tell you look how close it could be I'm
[33:40] expecting in the last days of worldwide
[33:43] sweeping Revival
[33:50] that's part truth
[33:53] but yet it's wrong
[33:57] it's not true
[33:58] why because we're not promised a
[34:01] worldwide sweeping Revival
[34:05] said that's where people miss it looking
[34:08] at that seeing the two witnesses to
[34:11] Israel
[34:14] and thanking it's for us
[34:16] no
[34:18] but what if the promises for this day I
[34:21] got a little message I'll probably
[34:22] preach on that note get a little time
[34:25] what about a Revival
[34:29] oh yeah you could say
[34:32] Revival's over brother Dale
[34:35] wrote around and said that
[34:38] he said the United States turned down
[34:40] the gospel in 56.
[34:43] Revival's over
[34:47] but then he'll turn around and say
[34:52] that the people that failed to see The
[34:53] Awakening of the Bride
[34:59] see then they can be a Revival to the
[35:01] bride
[35:03] which would be individuals
[35:06] but no Revival to the world
[35:09] right
[35:12] and like I've told you ever since I came
[35:13] in this message I've been in a Revival
[35:18] I told you the other day you ought to
[35:19] think about it wrote around the one that
[35:21] said this he said every time a Revival
[35:23] went forth he said insane asylum is
[35:26] filled up
[35:28] that's what he says you're checking
[35:32] well you know they're kind of full right
[35:34] now
[35:37] so there must be something going on
[35:43] right right
[35:46] let it begin in me
[35:49] all right
[35:51] so let's find out whether it's true or
[35:53] not
[35:54] we're to have a Revival for ourselves in
[35:57] the message and the continuing that's
[36:00] true what a worldwide sweeping Revival
[36:02] is not to the Gentiles
[36:04] now we know what truth is
[36:07] okay
[36:08] going to the next one just the promises
[36:11] the presence of God unrecognized
[36:16] and look what he says paragraph 118. so
[36:20] many things look at this days what he
[36:22] said would take place look at the
[36:24] promises that he made would take place
[36:26] this day and then examine it
[36:29] of what is going on
[36:31] and see where we're at
[36:33] and you see whether he's still in his
[36:35] word or not
[36:37] they wanted to see the sign of Moses son
[36:40] of David and all of them
[36:43] but those things showed clearly
[36:46] right
[36:48] wrote on up just a little bit
[36:50] what day they were living in
[36:55] what day each one Moses
[36:58] David whatever
[37:00] was written in the Bible right
[37:03] and they've seen their declare day
[37:05] because they've seen it manifest and
[37:07] they wrote it what about you and I he's
[37:10] doing the same thing right now search
[37:12] the scripture you who believe the Bible
[37:14] what is supposed to take place right
[37:16] here before his coming
[37:22] it was promised that the word for each
[37:24] age
[37:26] well then we must have a word for this
[37:28] age
[37:29] but have we recognized
[37:37] that the world is waiting on us
[37:41] God is waiting on you and I
[37:47] right
[37:49] God is waiting on somebody
[37:51] to realize who they are
[37:59] now we'll never do that by trying to
[38:01] find out how goody goody we can be
[38:08] I love the way God talks
[38:11] so wonderful
[38:13] when you really understand the way he's
[38:15] saying it
[38:18] you know that Moses had a lot of
[38:20] failures
[38:21] smiting the rocks and the different
[38:23] things
[38:24] have you ever read when he called Josh
[38:26] you would have started his ministry
[38:32] you ever read that
[38:35] as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee
[38:43] I read that one day and I thought
[38:46] what a God
[38:50] he was simply saying Joshua I'm going to
[38:53] take you through
[38:55] the failures of Moses never hindered the
[38:58] promise
[39:01] neither will your failures hinder the
[39:04] promise
[39:07] come on
[39:09] that's where we're at
[39:11] you know you go out there right now and
[39:13] say son
[39:15] go down
[39:16] it will
[39:18] it's going to take a few hours
[39:21] Sean Sam Steele no
[39:26] those are not for the day that we're
[39:28] living
[39:29] those were for the day that God used
[39:32] them
[39:36] you and I have a promise in this day
[39:39] to take this message
[39:41] and bring forth the Dead from the grave
[39:47] of course now they've got it figured out
[39:51] they got this about brother Branham to
[39:53] do this they got this about other
[39:55] ministers to come and do this they got
[39:57] this about waiting on so-and-so to do
[39:59] this they're waiting on this out of the
[40:00] other everybody's got it figured out
[40:04] I'm not going to argue with you about
[40:06] you figuring out
[40:08] I'm just going to say one thing for sure
[40:13] the Bible doesn't say
[40:16] that we're waiting on brother random to
[40:18] come back
[40:21] I believe you will
[40:24] thank God for it I've explained that
[40:26] over and over to you
[40:27] he's got a 30 40 days he can preach all
[40:30] he wants to
[40:32] from the time of the Resurrection
[40:34] I have no problems with anybody that
[40:36] believes in all kind of doctrines like
[40:38] that my problem is is when you won't
[40:40] open your eyes
[40:42] and look at what's taking place that's
[40:44] what we just read
[40:45] to see what's going on
[40:49] the Bible says
[40:51] without us they cannot be made perfect
[40:54] the prophet said
[40:56] God is waiting on you and I
[41:02] right
[41:05] we said it on one thing of event to take
[41:07] place
[41:09] we have narrowed that down to the wrong
[41:11] place I think
[41:13] when we put it to the word of God
[41:18] and believe
[41:21] that the world is waiting on you and I
[41:27] to realize Who We Are
[41:32] all right
[41:34] let me give me one more that I didn't
[41:35] give them
[41:37] because I've quoted this a lot to you
[41:40] but it's taken from if they pick it up
[41:42] and put it up they can get it
[41:44] uh page 15 of the church age book The
[41:46] revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:49] you started by now remember this so
[41:51] they're running in dark
[41:55] you can run it in today what hey they
[41:57] beat me to it don't they
[42:00] and remember this Christ in his true
[42:03] church is a continuation of the book of
[42:05] Acts
[42:07] but the Book of Revelation shows that
[42:08] the Antichrist Spirit would come into
[42:10] the church and defile it making it
[42:12] lukewarm formal
[42:14] lukewarm formal and Powerless
[42:18] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[42:21] what's his Works attempted destruction
[42:23] of God's people and the discrediting of
[42:26] God's word right down to the time he's
[42:28] cast into the Lake of Fire he fights
[42:30] that he cannot stand it
[42:33] he knows that if the people get the true
[42:35] revelation of the true church
[42:39] and what she is
[42:42] what she stands for
[42:45] and that she can do the Greater Works
[42:50] she will be an invincible Army
[42:52] if they get a true revelation of the two
[42:55] spirits
[42:57] within the framework of the Christian
[42:59] church and by God's spirit Discerning
[43:03] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[43:05] will be powerless before her
[43:07] it's like he was with the Lord Jesus
[43:12] by him knowing who he was
[43:17] but I just can't see that brother Dale
[43:21] of how that
[43:23] we can be what we are
[43:27] and we can do the Greater Works
[43:34] now there's messages all over the land
[43:36] on what the Greater Works are
[43:42] but think about it
[43:48] I thought
[43:50] that we believed
[43:53] then as I've brought out in the last two
[43:55] or three messages
[43:57] or a little maybe for a long time
[44:01] that when God wrote about Abraham he
[44:04] never wrote about any of his problems
[44:09] when you wrote about Sarah he didn't
[44:10] write about any of his problems I'm
[44:12] talking about in the New Testament
[44:13] through Paul
[44:16] he said he's staggered not
[44:22] well then you say we can never attain
[44:25] unto
[44:27] this statement here
[44:30] well
[44:32] that means you can't Attain
[44:40] but if that statement's true
[44:44] they may not be but one person
[44:46] but somebody is going to stand in that
[44:49] place
[44:50] and why can't I contend that I am that
[44:54] person
[44:58] right
[45:00] so then everything is dependent upon
[45:02] whether or not
[45:04] somebody can take this word
[45:08] and walk right up to death and life at
[45:11] it
[45:13] and say move on
[45:17] I'm going on
[45:21] we look no we can't do the Greater Works
[45:23] then you get hung up trying to figure
[45:26] out what Greater Works are
[45:30] we know we can't do nothing greater I
[45:32] need to see
[45:36] come on Church
[45:38] there's the 500 preachers a 300
[45:42] preachers that went home and taught
[45:45] their church not the correct form of
[45:49] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[45:51] Jesus Christ but taught them that
[45:53] brother random was a false prophet
[45:58] and they wind up to be blinded
[46:04] you'll find
[46:07] there's the greatest sin
[46:10] is to say I can't do it
[46:15] but you know what most people justify
[46:16] that
[46:17] you can't do it
[46:21] right
[46:23] I don't see that in you
[46:30] do you ever see it in yourself
[46:36] if you don't see it in somebody else
[46:38] you've got to have a way
[46:41] of saying that ain't right
[46:44] you got to have some standard to judge
[46:46] by
[46:49] right
[46:51] when you say I don't see it you got a
[46:54] standard to judge by
[46:56] so you must be the standard
[46:58] like I've always said there's no such
[47:00] thing as an atheist that don't believe
[47:02] in God
[47:03] there's idiots
[47:07] because they believe they're greater
[47:08] than he is because if I say there's no
[47:10] God I've got to be greater than he is
[47:15] or I wouldn't say there is no God
[47:20] what about it
[47:24] what are you expecting brother Dale
[47:28] just what the prophet said
[47:31] in one of the quotes
[47:33] that Jesus Christ would become visible
[47:35] Among Us
[47:37] and raise the dead and we'd go into
[47:40] rapture
[47:43] I don't see it
[47:45] well
[47:47] do you mean it's not true
[47:53] I've never been up in a spaceship went
[47:55] into them
[47:56] Mars and things or anywhere else and you
[48:00] who was it
[48:02] talking about that the other day
[48:06] but Joe I guess
[48:08] you were talking about that they say
[48:09] that there's a son out there on one of
[48:12] those solar systems out in there
[48:14] that you know
[48:17] I forgot how many years it would take a
[48:19] jet airplane
[48:21] the thing is so big
[48:23] till it would take a jet airplane flying
[48:25] at top speed
[48:28] he told how much it was
[48:31] was like years to be able to fly around
[48:33] a sucker
[48:35] and we think we're big
[48:39] well I've never seen it
[48:42] I don't believe it's out there
[48:50] I've never been healed
[48:52] so I don't believe healing is for us
[48:59] you'll lay on your bed one of these days
[49:01] and you'll beg for somebody to try to
[49:03] convince you that there is a healing
[49:07] I just pray it's not too late
[49:13] my whole point of this whole series
[49:17] was aiming at this life part
[49:20] all those great warriors of faith
[49:23] and what they've done
[49:25] and then Paul says they didn't receive
[49:28] the promise
[49:29] so there's something greater for you and
[49:31] I
[49:32] to bring them to their promise
[49:38] and it's a simple matter
[49:42] we just become what God said we would be
[49:48] is that hard
[49:52] to become what he says we would become
[49:56] because if he said we would become it
[49:58] somewhere he's going to make a way
[50:03] is that true
[50:06] it's up to him
[50:09] to save us because we can't save
[50:11] ourselves right
[50:13] then it's up to him to keep his promise
[50:18] what's your problem is see we can hinder
[50:21] the promise
[50:23] we can't stop it
[50:25] we can hinder it and then by doing that
[50:28] we can prove we're not a part of it
[50:33] right
[50:34] all right questions and answers comments
[50:36] take on these things
[50:40] Brother Gary hang on a minute we got to
[50:42] get to
[50:46] things we will
[50:49] we want you on the
[50:50] thing too we're
[50:52] people can hear you
[50:57] maybe they got the same question
[50:59] go ahead brother you've uh mentioned
[51:02] many times in the past several sermons
[51:04] and today uh about they without us
[51:07] cannot be made perfect well as you know
[51:10] there is a teaching that believes that
[51:13] there is Those Old Testament Patriarchs
[51:17] that raised in that Resurrection when
[51:20] Jesus resurrected there that they did go
[51:23] on and receive the end of their promise
[51:25] which was an eternal body and there's
[51:28] even quotes about Brenna made sure that
[51:31] sound that that's what's being said and
[51:34] could you spend just maybe a minute or
[51:36] two just going over those the other side
[51:39] quotes and kind of bringing the the
[51:41] truth of what you believe down through
[51:43] the middle of all of it
[51:45] like I said this morning it's easy to
[51:49] think about the New Testament Saints and
[51:50] kind of see how they're depended upon us
[51:52] because we're all in a body
[51:55] but then the things before
[51:58] you know the ones in the Old Testament
[52:02] I heard a man just recently
[52:04] in a meeting that he was expressing just
[52:07] that point
[52:09] he said that the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:11] made those Old Testament Saints so
[52:13] perfect until he went right in the
[52:15] presence of God
[52:18] well
[52:20] what is the presence of God
[52:31] see is it then that
[52:34] Those Old Testament Saints
[52:38] have totally gone on into immortality
[52:42] if it is you better rip out Hebrews 11
[52:45] 40. because
[52:48] they wouldn't be waiting on us
[52:52] and we wouldn't be waiting on them so
[52:55] there wouldn't be nobody waiting on
[52:56] nothing
[52:58] right
[53:02] I believe Those Old Testament Saints
[53:04] raised I believe that
[53:07] the ones that was in Paradise I believe
[53:09] Paradise was taken up I believe that but
[53:11] where did they go that's all I've ever
[53:13] asked
[53:16] you can get a quote from Brother Branham
[53:17] he went right into the presence of God I
[53:19] believe that you can get a quote where
[53:21] he said open up your left Everlasting
[53:23] Gates the kingdom of Glory come in and
[53:26] he goes right in and takes them right in
[53:29] I believe that
[53:32] all right
[53:34] but where did it go
[53:37] and how did they get to immortality
[53:43] because if they raised in glorified
[53:44] bodies literal physical glorified bodies
[53:47] they went into immortality into
[53:49] Resurrection
[53:51] that's sensible
[53:54] all right
[53:55] where did it go
[53:57] when the Bible says that
[53:59] Jesus is the only one that has
[54:01] immortality
[54:02] which no man can
[54:05] attaining to
[54:08] all right so the thought is the Old
[54:10] Testament Saints was waiting on Jesus to
[54:13] make them perfect
[54:15] good
[54:19] and one brother had it this way and he
[54:21] said that in the church ages they're
[54:23] waiting on us
[54:26] and that sounds real good
[54:29] you know
[54:31] but the only question I've asked is were
[54:33] did those Old Testament Saints Go
[54:40] and run around them
[54:42] went beyond the curtain of time
[54:45] where did he go
[54:47] six dementia
[54:50] right
[54:52] all right
[54:53] he said they were there in their souls
[54:56] theophany
[54:58] sixth dimension
[55:03] I forgot the wording he actually used it
[55:05] something like where's Jesus
[55:10] he said you can't go where he's at
[55:13] he said because he's higher
[55:18] well
[55:21] that's why I don't see that the Old
[55:23] Testament Saints
[55:25] achieved a position
[55:28] that they could go to
[55:32] when even
[55:35] the people who had died in Christ
[55:38] were not allowed to go to that position
[55:42] that there are their bodies here
[55:45] all right
[55:47] I know that I'm facing a lot of
[55:53] questionable things
[55:56] but I've been asked to State it and I
[55:59] will
[56:00] and if I'm wrong then I can be helped
[56:04] because I will tell you what I believe
[56:05] but you'll sit there and sire up and
[56:08] won't tell me what you believe
[56:10] but go tell everybody if I don't agree
[56:12] with brother Dale About That Old
[56:15] Testament Saints
[56:18] well why didn't you come tell me eat it
[56:22] okay
[56:25] but listen
[56:27] when they came up did they come up in
[56:29] glorified bodies right around says they
[56:31] did
[56:34] hmm well we'll say what he said
[56:38] well okay keep on saying what he said
[56:42] you don't never hear of the ones I gave
[56:44] the other day where they brought around
[56:46] and said one day
[56:50] Adam will reach over and get Eve he will
[56:53] reach over and gets
[56:54] Abel able to reaching it saith brought
[56:57] it all the way down to Abraham and said
[57:00] they'll raise up and go up
[57:04] and then you won't go to the Future home
[57:06] where brother random says
[57:09] Those Old Testament Saints will raise
[57:16] in the resurrection
[57:17] and we will fall right in line
[57:22] and go up
[57:25] now
[57:27] to keep you from going too far
[57:30] don't try to Bumble jumble that up and
[57:32] try to get it straightened out
[57:35] I know what I'm talking about on this I
[57:38] never preached it to you
[57:39] but I do know one thing that has to be
[57:42] put in the correct order
[57:45] because remember
[57:46] his secret was fall right in line
[57:52] it doesn't say what order it comes
[57:57] you say yeah he said they raise all
[57:59] right you got Old Testament Saints
[58:03] what are you going to do will you feel
[58:04] sealed you
[58:07] where do they come up
[58:13] and 144 000 are not raised until after
[58:17] we're done in glory
[58:19] right three and a half years later
[58:22] it's the key is fall right in line
[58:26] there will be a resurrection
[58:30] and wrote around and says those in
[58:32] Christ you know what he's talking about
[58:34] Old Testament Saints
[58:37] but they weren't born again no they
[58:38] wouldn't
[58:40] but they were the Christ of their day
[58:45] put all the quotes together
[58:48] put all the message together
[58:52] I've asked this simple question
[58:55] is Revelations 5
[58:58] a literal group of people
[59:03] or is it a Heavenly scene
[59:08] of not more people
[59:12] but in Revelations 5 you've got
[59:15] 24 elders
[59:18] 12 Apostles
[59:20] to have Patriarchs
[59:22] at the time that was written John was
[59:24] one of the Patriarchs hadn't died yet
[59:27] right
[59:32] so there have been
[59:34] 23 elders
[59:37] right
[59:39] and John would have said and I get there
[59:40] we'll make 24. he didn't say that
[59:45] but I don't believe Revelations 5 is a
[59:48] Corporal mortal people
[59:52] I'm going to give you the quote in a
[59:54] minute worth it
[59:55] it goes to and then maybe it'll open
[59:57] their eyes Revelations 5 is the Lamb
[1:00:00] that climbs upon the throne and sets
[1:00:02] down
[1:00:04] is that Revelation 5 Revelation 4
[1:00:06] receives the throne he sees this
[1:00:08] Revelations 5 he sees one Cloud upon the
[1:00:10] throne and sit down
[1:00:13] you know that brother random said
[1:00:15] when those Old Testament Saints entered
[1:00:17] into that City
[1:00:19] now what city is he talking about
[1:00:24] that's the quote that entered into the
[1:00:26] city open up your Everlasting Gates that
[1:00:28] the king of glory may go in may come in
[1:00:31] he said he went right down through the
[1:00:33] city
[1:00:35] he said he went Jesus
[1:00:38] right up to the father
[1:00:40] stopped and said father it's finished
[1:00:44] I have completed this run the quote and
[1:00:46] say
[1:00:49] he says
[1:00:51] climb up on the throne
[1:00:54] and sit down
[1:00:56] and I'll make your enemies your
[1:00:59] footstool
[1:01:04] where does he come upon the throne and
[1:01:06] sit down
[1:01:07] chapter 5.
[1:01:12] chapter 5.
[1:01:16] chapter 5 is where he went to the throne
[1:01:18] he's the lamb that takes the book
[1:01:22] it wouldn't allow him
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] you know physical
[1:01:28] it was Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] I'm not going to argue with anybody
[1:01:33] about it but I'm just going to State
[1:01:35] what I believe I'm the pastor I'm
[1:01:37] responsible for stating it
[1:01:40] I believe Those Old Testament Saints
[1:01:42] I have preached it to you
[1:01:45] not to try to argue with nobody I
[1:01:48] believe Those Old Testament Saints when
[1:01:49] they died their soul was not eternal
[1:01:54] and that Soul was put in Paradise
[1:02:00] Paradise would be called the Muslim of
[1:02:02] Abraham which is the faith of Abraham
[1:02:04] provided by the faith of Abraham that's
[1:02:06] Bible right
[1:02:08] we're the place it was it's just
[1:02:10] you know
[1:02:12] and Jesus had to go there and bring
[1:02:14] those people out
[1:02:17] but he also went to hell to the souls
[1:02:19] that were in prison
[1:02:22] but he didn't bring them out
[1:02:24] when he brought the Old Testament Saints
[1:02:26] out
[1:02:29] I'll let you question it could it be
[1:02:32] that when they raised
[1:02:34] that they raised in theophany
[1:02:37] raised to a
[1:02:40] Eternal Soul
[1:02:43] making them capable of going to chapter
[1:02:46] five
[1:02:47] and be in the Twelve Apostles
[1:02:50] and pale 12-page Rock
[1:02:54] and then it would be that they achieved
[1:02:57] a place
[1:03:00] but yet their body's still in the ground
[1:03:04] and one day
[1:03:06] there'll be a resurrection
[1:03:10] and they'll come up
[1:03:13] that way I don't have to backpedal
[1:03:17] jump around and bypass quotes
[1:03:19] I can take every one
[1:03:22] that is put there run around and said
[1:03:24] they raised in Mortal bodies
[1:03:28] I will remind you
[1:03:31] that he will call a theophany
[1:03:33] a mortal body
[1:03:37] he will call it theophany
[1:03:39] a glorified body
[1:03:42] keep reading
[1:03:45] he'll call those by those names
[1:03:50] but the only thing I've asked you simple
[1:03:52] question if they raised back there
[1:03:56] why did Paul
[1:03:59] spend Hebrews 11.
[1:04:02] 39 verses
[1:04:04] talking of the Old Testament Saints
[1:04:07] and cons I mean finishing it up in the
[1:04:10] 39th verse as the saying they never
[1:04:13] received a promise
[1:04:16] in the 40th verse said because they
[1:04:19] without us
[1:04:21] cannot be brought back
[1:04:23] to a completed stage of mortality
[1:04:29] because that's totally what he's talking
[1:04:31] about
[1:04:32] he's not talking about the New Testament
[1:04:34] I searched it and searched it brother
[1:04:37] random and I gave it to you on the
[1:04:39] Statue of a perfect man that we read
[1:04:44] is the only time he connects the New
[1:04:47] Testament saints that I can find
[1:04:52] you know to that point
[1:04:54] of anywhere connected in Hebrews 11.
[1:05:00] because Hebrews 11 was all Old Testament
[1:05:03] people
[1:05:06] right
[1:05:09] well then why would he say that why
[1:05:11] wouldn't Paul say that they've done been
[1:05:13] made perfect
[1:05:16] and a brother explained that like I said
[1:05:18] the Old Testament Saints was made
[1:05:20] perfect by Jesus Christ
[1:05:21] but now the New Testament people are
[1:05:24] waiting to be made perfect complete
[1:05:26] finished because of a bride
[1:05:30] I believe one thing
[1:05:32] I don't believe Those Old Testament
[1:05:34] Saints raised in a mortal body to go to
[1:05:37] immortality
[1:05:41] because
[1:05:43] immortality is the position Jesus
[1:05:47] reached
[1:05:48] when he was raised from the dead
[1:05:53] when he was raised in the dead he
[1:05:55] stepped from Mortal to the immortality
[1:06:00] and the Bible then is right that no man
[1:06:02] hath reproached unto that
[1:06:09] but Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] if I'm wrong I want you to show me but I
[1:06:14] want you to show me the message not
[1:06:17] well this is what I believe
[1:06:19] well brother Dale you're just too dumb
[1:06:21] to read
[1:06:22] well that may be true
[1:06:24] but bring the quotes and let's read them
[1:06:29] I've told you when I believe
[1:06:32] sure they moved out of that place
[1:06:35] into another place which would qualify
[1:06:37] him to be in Revelations 5.
[1:06:41] there's a 24 elders
[1:06:45] because the New Testament Saints at that
[1:06:47] time
[1:06:48] could be represented there
[1:06:52] as apostles
[1:06:54] the Old Testament was represented as the
[1:06:56] Patriarchs
[1:06:58] and the lamb had a book in his hand
[1:07:01] he climbed up on the throne and sat down
[1:07:04] waiting until the life the enemy to be
[1:07:07] destroyed which is Mortal dying
[1:07:12] that's the promise for you and I
[1:07:15] somebody is going to be made Immortal
[1:07:19] Immortal if I mispronounce it
[1:07:22] they're going to be made eternal
[1:07:26] Body Spirit and soul
[1:07:31] and everybody else
[1:07:34] will fall right in line
[1:07:37] because we have achieved it
[1:07:41] that's what I believe
[1:07:43] anybody else you come in more comments
[1:07:45] brother
[1:07:49] anybody else will say hey I don't agree
[1:07:51] with you
[1:07:54] well explain it
[1:07:58] but the problem is like we were talking
[1:08:00] about last night like the five of the
[1:08:02] 300 preachers oh yeah we believe that
[1:08:06] and I was relating to when Wade and I
[1:08:09] spoke in a Minister's meeting about the
[1:08:11] Daniel 70 weeks
[1:08:15] and for preachers
[1:08:17] and we had
[1:08:18] proof
[1:08:20] of the drawings as being correct we had
[1:08:23] two
[1:08:24] one of them was a hand drawed drawing
[1:08:27] signed by Brother Branham
[1:08:30] and we had the one that I picked up in
[1:08:32] 68 in Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:08:35] as a drawing from what a randomly drawed
[1:08:38] and he said seven six or seven times
[1:08:42] in the message referred by Iran is to
[1:08:45] refer back to the draw and if you got
[1:08:47] any question you know what a big man in
[1:08:49] this message you know what he does he
[1:08:51] made his own drawing
[1:08:55] and totally changed everything around
[1:08:58] him said
[1:09:05] I'm at least not going to be that far
[1:09:07] off
[1:09:10] anybody else
[1:09:12] and they call me as questions talks
[1:09:15] be glad to
[1:09:17] answer any question or tell you I don't
[1:09:19] uh sister Trudy
[1:09:23] croissant
[1:09:29] okay my question is for you to explain
[1:09:32] again
[1:09:33] um acts 9
[1:09:36] 7
[1:09:40] together with acts 22
[1:09:45] 9.
[1:09:47] 97.
[1:09:49] yeah and 22.9
[1:09:51] and 22 9 that was one brother Bob was on
[1:09:55] Wednesday
[1:09:56] yes you gotta answer that one
[1:10:02] ask him
[1:10:06] I'm not
[1:10:09] it's a it looks like a total
[1:10:11] contradictory form
[1:10:13] because it says in the seventh verse of
[1:10:16] the
[1:10:17] nine
[1:10:18] that they stood speechless hearing a
[1:10:21] voice
[1:10:22] but seeing no man
[1:10:24] all right then they come over
[1:10:27] and what is it 22
[1:10:30] 9.
[1:10:33] and we're afraid but they heard not the
[1:10:35] voice of him that Spate to me
[1:10:45] okay
[1:10:47] sound like it's contradictory don't it
[1:10:53] sounds contradictory
[1:10:56] I wouldn't stand here at all if he had
[1:10:58] or showed me that
[1:11:01] I tell you I don't know
[1:11:06] see
[1:11:08] so let's read it
[1:11:14] stood speechless
[1:11:16] hearing a voice
[1:11:19] but seeing no man
[1:11:26] and over here it says
[1:11:28] they heard not the voice of him that
[1:11:31] spoke to me
[1:11:37] that's the key
[1:11:43] they heard
[1:11:45] of thunder
[1:11:47] you're in a voice
[1:11:51] they heard a thunder they heard
[1:11:52] something happen seeing no man so he
[1:11:55] gets on over and he don't talk about the
[1:11:56] man because they uh
[1:11:59] they couldn't see the one I remember
[1:12:01] with the man standing there
[1:12:04] right it was a pillar of Fire
[1:12:06] standing there
[1:12:08] and they didn't see it remember Moses
[1:12:10] saw the pillar of fire but the children
[1:12:12] of Israel didn't see it
[1:12:15] right right
[1:12:18] see they with a voice
[1:12:21] one was a thunder
[1:12:23] you know something happened
[1:12:27] that would have took you remember into
[1:12:29] Jesus over there
[1:12:30] said some said it thundered
[1:12:33] but the voice spoke to him
[1:12:35] see those people never heard who's
[1:12:37] talking to Paul
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:42] they never heard who was talking to ball
[1:12:46] they heard of little blue Bloom some
[1:12:48] kind of a form
[1:12:50] of Paul
[1:12:53] knew who was talking
[1:12:55] right
[1:12:58] so the key is you're not looking for the
[1:13:00] man
[1:13:01] because they say they didn't see no man
[1:13:03] no here they don't mention it
[1:13:06] but it's just talking about a voice
[1:13:12] well see you can sit here today the
[1:13:14] whole congregation can hear my voice
[1:13:17] right
[1:13:21] but what if there's only one person
[1:13:23] knows what I'm saying
[1:13:26] yeah
[1:13:29] Danny's the only one that knows what to
[1:13:31] say it you know what he's on one heard
[1:13:33] my voice
[1:13:35] the others heard jangling words or
[1:13:38] sounds or symbols
[1:13:41] because the key over there is what
[1:13:44] that what happened
[1:13:49] but they heard not the voice of him that
[1:13:52] spake
[1:13:53] they saw the light that's part of it
[1:13:55] we'd like to back up to that they were
[1:13:58] with me so indeed Delight
[1:14:00] and we're afraid to don't mention a lot
[1:14:02] in the other so we'll go back to pick up
[1:14:04] that little point that
[1:14:07] they thought it was the sun shining down
[1:14:12] Paul that light spoke to Paul
[1:14:17] they couldn't understand that
[1:14:20] but they seeing no man verse 9. what was
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:27] what was the other one
[1:14:29] nine and seven and nine
[1:14:33] seven
[1:14:40] speaks this you're in a voice and seeing
[1:14:43] no man
[1:14:44] this is over here says they saw a light
[1:14:48] see they saw no man
[1:14:50] but it wasn't a man standing there
[1:14:52] was the Lord Jesus
[1:14:56] he said I am Jesus
[1:14:59] whom thou persecuted
[1:15:01] none of the others heard that
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:09] you can hear the voice of God as brother
[1:15:11] Bob said there
[1:15:14] I enjoyed it you can hear it every day
[1:15:16] of your life and not know what's been
[1:15:17] said
[1:15:19] you know the Bible never did teach water
[1:15:21] baptism in Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:15:25] you know the Bible never taught a
[1:15:27] trinity
[1:15:30] the voice of God is correct
[1:15:37] but have we seen God
[1:15:40] or are we looking for a man
[1:15:45] to try to help us
[1:15:47] or look into God
[1:15:49] you understand Sis one says they
[1:15:53] draw a light the other doesn't mention
[1:15:56] the light
[1:15:57] because it means to see no man well
[1:15:59] there was no man there
[1:16:01] one says hearing a voice the other one's
[1:16:03] talking they didn't hear what was
[1:16:05] speaking to me all right so it's correct
[1:16:08] they never heard what Paul heard they
[1:16:12] heard a room
[1:16:13] they heard that on the day when Jesus
[1:16:15] was standing there
[1:16:19] but it had to be interpreted
[1:16:21] won't say it
[1:16:23] okay
[1:16:25] that confused you
[1:16:27] sometimes I talk enough to confuse
[1:16:29] people
[1:16:30] okay
[1:16:31] okay brother
[1:16:33] Bob
[1:16:35] brother dick
[1:16:40] Oh Me Oh my I do things
[1:16:43] and I talk to preachers and what have
[1:16:46] you and I hope they bring things back to
[1:16:48] me the reason why I talk to them and
[1:16:49] like
[1:16:51] sharing with something with brother
[1:16:53] brothers the other day and he jumped up
[1:16:55] I said and he said he's never seen that
[1:16:57] that way
[1:16:59] my question is about this scripture
[1:17:02] it seems contrary
[1:17:05] one to the other and what Abel I can't
[1:17:07] but is that all you see
[1:17:10] yeah I was
[1:17:12] I don't know I've been here since 84 or
[1:17:15] something like that I was around Atlanta
[1:17:17] and this happened sometime before then I
[1:17:20] was sitting in a warehouse rack it's
[1:17:22] almost reading
[1:17:24] and I was reading that scripture there
[1:17:27] and I realized that to me personal to me
[1:17:32] that that was the second G Jesus was
[1:17:36] showing Paul the second coming
[1:17:39] of himself
[1:17:42] and I believe if we if in this is
[1:17:46] personal to me me seeing that I know who
[1:17:50] I am today
[1:17:51] yeah I believe that people don't know
[1:17:54] who they are today
[1:17:56] they're just a quote or something like
[1:17:58] that
[1:18:00] but
[1:18:03] you know Paul held held the clothes
[1:18:07] of the men that stoned
[1:18:09] uh Stephen yeah he had no big experience
[1:18:14] there right
[1:18:16] but when that happened when that Pillar
[1:18:18] of Fire said I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:18:20] persecuted
[1:18:21] I believe he realized who Stephen was
[1:18:24] and I didn't catch that to about three
[1:18:27] or four five months ago or something
[1:18:28] like that
[1:18:29] but I realized that Paul on the road of
[1:18:33] Damascus with papers in his pocket
[1:18:36] to persecute those that was preaching
[1:18:38] Jesus Christ
[1:18:39] and I believe that pillar for I told him
[1:18:42] right there
[1:18:44] those people that you're Prosecuting
[1:18:46] that's me that's it and it's the baptism
[1:18:49] of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:51] that's what I become right
[1:18:55] and you say this and people say you're
[1:18:57] making yourself God and all that put
[1:19:00] that far as out as your mind as you can
[1:19:02] get
[1:19:04] but
[1:19:05] a Christian today is a manifestation
[1:19:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ in human flesh
[1:19:12] exactly and I explained you know when
[1:19:13] they had that band right now what would
[1:19:15] Jesus do that really means more to me
[1:19:18] today yeah
[1:19:20] and people were putting it down and what
[1:19:23] have you but that means more to me today
[1:19:28] but on that Pillar of Fire
[1:19:30] when I realized what that's the baptism
[1:19:33] of the Holy Ghost the second coming of
[1:19:36] Christ the lord Jesus said in you the
[1:19:39] hope of glory right
[1:19:42] I hope I hope and pray everybody sees
[1:19:44] that and if they don't see it I hope it
[1:19:47] comes to them you know
[1:19:50] but I've been sitting here all this time
[1:19:53] thinking about that I said I say when I
[1:19:56] hear preachers preach it they'll say I'm
[1:19:58] Jesus whom I'm Jesus
[1:20:01] Lord who aren't I I'm Jesus all right
[1:20:04] I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted right got
[1:20:07] the papers in the pocket for the people
[1:20:09] of that day right
[1:20:12] someone you in that song We Sing it's no
[1:20:15] longer I that live now that Christ that
[1:20:17] liveth in me I thought when we started
[1:20:19] that I thought that'd be the next
[1:20:21] national anthem
[1:20:24] people don't know who they are right
[1:20:28] you know I I just won't say that I hope
[1:20:30] it helps somebody yeah uh you know
[1:20:32] because I I believe that right I mean
[1:20:38] to make me disbelieve that there's some
[1:20:41] kind of catastrophe you'd have to have
[1:20:43] right
[1:20:44] yeah yeah
[1:20:46] it would take away everything I believe
[1:20:48] right
[1:20:49] because I believe and I've taught it I
[1:20:52] believe the second coming of Jesus
[1:20:53] Christ started on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:57] in his bride
[1:20:59] he come first to redeem his bride he
[1:21:02] comes a second time to catch her away
[1:21:04] third time with her
[1:21:07] so we are the part of his coming
[1:21:10] and why can't we believe it
[1:21:13] who's next
[1:21:19] anybody else
[1:21:21] yeah
[1:21:21] comments questions thoughts
[1:21:27] sister Freda
[1:21:31] um
[1:21:33] you have told us that we will be I mean
[1:21:37] maybe not literally me I mean but that
[1:21:40] we the bride will take this it'll be
[1:21:43] this message that goes to Israel okay
[1:21:47] um won't be us to take it says Moses
[1:21:50] well you know brother Adam told us it
[1:21:51] was Moses and Elijah right well well
[1:21:55] or do you know will the the people Moses
[1:21:58] and Elijah that takes this back to the
[1:22:01] Jews will it be a present day person to
[1:22:03] people with a spirit of Moses and Elijah
[1:22:06] like brother Branham had the spirit of
[1:22:07] Elijah
[1:22:08] so that person could possibly be alive
[1:22:12] I mean could already be born and yeah
[1:22:16] wrote a Brandon will mentioned one time
[1:22:18] as we go up they come down but that's
[1:22:20] still terminologies and words you use
[1:22:25] um I personally believe that it will not
[1:22:27] be a resurrection of Moses and Elijah
[1:22:30] you know in the form of that way it will
[1:22:33] be the spirit of Moses and Elijah in the
[1:22:36] two witnesses and they will take this
[1:22:38] message because this message is the
[1:22:40] Bible
[1:22:42] and brother Branham in the seal book
[1:22:43] Seventh seal I'm pretty sure it's a
[1:22:46] little close to the end he says there he
[1:22:48] said they'll tell them look you missed
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:52] you turned it down but said these people
[1:22:54] have become
[1:22:56] that
[1:22:58] see so it'll be they got to tell them
[1:23:00] about us
[1:23:02] because of how they're going to how
[1:23:04] they're going to tell them they rejected
[1:23:06] it they got to tell them about a bride
[1:23:08] that becomes one you know so it'll be
[1:23:11] the Bible that goes to Israel through
[1:23:13] two witnesses but I personally believe
[1:23:15] that it will be the spirit of Moses and
[1:23:18] Elijah
[1:23:20] through to men and I have no problems
[1:23:23] with the statements you said could they
[1:23:25] be here now
[1:23:27] uh if they don't just drop down out of
[1:23:29] the sky they evidently supposed to be
[1:23:30] here
[1:23:32] but
[1:23:34] they will not be working not saying they
[1:23:37] wouldn't be prophets not saying they
[1:23:39] wouldn't have the ministry of prophets
[1:23:41] but they're not in the Limelight today
[1:23:44] they're waiting on us to leave because
[1:23:45] you can't have
[1:23:47] them here preaching about the Jews with
[1:23:51] us here preaching about the Jesus
[1:23:54] right
[1:23:56] you you can't have a tear together
[1:23:59] so we got to get out of here and brother
[1:24:01] random says
[1:24:03] that Israel
[1:24:05] we'll see God coming for his bride and
[1:24:08] think
[1:24:10] he's coming after them that's a direct
[1:24:12] quote
[1:24:14] they will see a bride walk off of this
[1:24:18] Earth one day
[1:24:20] how much of that will be seen I don't
[1:24:22] know physically
[1:24:24] I ain't concerned about it
[1:24:26] I just believe somebody is going to
[1:24:29] become the word
[1:24:31] and that'll be seeing it
[1:24:34] what would be the difference in them
[1:24:36] literally seeing us on a TV screen are
[1:24:38] the two witnesses walk out and say
[1:24:42] the Gentiles has accepted this and
[1:24:44] they've gone into rapture
[1:24:46] now's your day
[1:24:49] you're going to have to be killed
[1:24:51] as your brethren I feel sealed Jew
[1:24:53] people they're gonna are killed
[1:24:56] he said let me over with pretty quick
[1:25:01] they got a short time right anybody else
[1:25:06] foreign
[1:25:09] they got to beat two Prophets
[1:25:12] and one brother in this message believed
[1:25:14] that it was a gentile bride and a
[1:25:16] gentile prophet
[1:25:19] of course he believed he was the prophet
[1:25:23] what else would he say it that way
[1:25:26] right I looked at him I said no way
[1:25:29] don't take gentiles
[1:25:33] he said you don't believe it could be
[1:25:35] that way I said no sir I've got the
[1:25:37] quotes from The Prophet that Israel
[1:25:39] won't exceed receive a gentile Prophet
[1:25:42] They will receive Jews
[1:25:46] not gentiles
[1:25:49] let's cut it off now because he's done
[1:25:50] the end of the tape okay
[1:25:52] let's go right on the end to the
[1:25:54] communion you got any more let me know
[1:25:56] and we'll we'll try to cover it but
[1:26:00] I pray and hope that you see what I'm
[1:26:01] talking about
[1:26:03] and uh
[1:26:05] you know
[1:26:07] and like I said if I'm wrong come and
[1:26:09] tell me I'm wrong don't tell everybody
[1:26:11] else I'm wrong

[1:26:17] because that's
[1:26:19] the way it's supposed to be
[1:26:21] I tell you
[1:26:23] what I believe
[1:26:25] why won't you tell me what you believe

[1:28:02] read
[1:28:03] history father we thank you for this day
[1:28:07] and the time and we pray that what we've
[1:28:09] been said is worthy of being said and we
[1:28:12] just done the best we could do
[1:28:15] and just help us Lord God is as we go on
[1:28:18] into this communion part
[1:28:19] Lord as we partake of this we ask you to
[1:28:23] make us all worthy because we're not
[1:28:26] worthy in ourselves to do anything
[1:28:28] which you can make us Worthy
[1:28:31] you wrote about Abraham that he's the
[1:28:33] tiger not so you could write about
[1:28:36] the little bride did she become your
[1:28:38] word
[1:28:39] we love you and we thank you we just ask
[1:28:42] you to forgive our sins
[1:28:44] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:28:46] May the thoughts of our mind the
[1:28:48] meditations of our heart
[1:28:50] come to a place to be acceptable in thy
[1:28:52] sight
[1:28:53] but until that time would maybe come may
[1:28:55] they be wiped out by the blood of Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ
[1:28:58] that they be not in your presence
[1:29:01] that we may be perfect in you
[1:29:03] as we read your word and take the
[1:29:05] communion we pray
[1:29:06] you would bless and got each one
[1:29:09] in Jesus name
[1:29:14] Paul said for I have received of the
[1:29:16] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:29:18] you
[1:29:20] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:29:22] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:29:24] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:29:26] it and said take he this is my body
[1:29:29] which is broken for you
[1:29:31] do this in remembrance of me
[1:29:34] after the same manner all so we took the
[1:29:36] cup when he had Subs saying this cup is
[1:29:39] the New Testament in my blood this New
[1:29:42] Year's office you drink it in
[1:29:44] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:29:46] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:29:48] shoes the Lord's death till he come or
[1:29:51] for whosoever shall eat this bread and
[1:29:53] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:29:56] shall be guilty of the body
[1:29:58] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:30:01] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:30:03] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:30:06] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:30:07] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:30:10] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:30:12] but it's called many are weak and sickly
[1:30:14] among you in many sleep
[1:30:16] for we would judge ourselves we should
[1:30:18] not be judged I love this
[1:30:20] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:30:22] to the Lord
[1:30:23] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:30:25] world
[1:30:26] wherever my brother wherefore my
[1:30:28] brethren when you come together
[1:30:30] to eat Terry one for another and if any
[1:30:33] man hunger that he meet at home that you
[1:30:36] come not together under condemnation and
[1:30:38] the rest of us said in order when I come
[1:30:40] let's just have a few moments of Silent
[1:30:43] prayer
[1:30:45] praying for one another
[1:31:06] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:31:08] name
[1:31:09] two
[1:31:13] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:31:15] it
[1:31:16] father we thank you for this bread and
[1:31:18] we pray that you would just sanctify to
[1:31:20] each one of our bodies that as we're
[1:31:23] partakers of it
[1:31:25] that we would remember that it's a
[1:31:27] symbol of the body of our Lord and
[1:31:29] savior
[1:31:30] not to physical but assemble it's also a
[1:31:33] symbol of Thy word Lord
[1:31:35] there was there that bled for each one
[1:31:37] of us sanctify the bread and the
[1:31:40] partakers that we may all be together as
[1:31:43] one in you in Jesus name
[1:31:57] laughs
[1:32:00] but we always think about
[1:32:02] Israel
[1:32:04] in their Journey coming out
[1:32:07] the last thing they done was
[1:32:10] had
[1:32:11] communion
[1:32:13] they got together
[1:32:15] they ate together
[1:32:18] and then everything was said in order
[1:32:21] and they left for the Promised Land
[1:32:24] it would be a good thing I believe
[1:32:27] to be taken to communion
[1:32:30] and see the Dead Walk Among Us
[1:32:33] wonderful opportunity
[1:32:41] father we thank you for this wine it
[1:32:43] represents your blood
[1:32:45] and Lord we pray that you would just
[1:32:47] sanctify the wine and the partakers and
[1:32:50] as we eat a little piece of bread and we
[1:32:52] drank the little bit of wine that
[1:32:54] tomorrow it would be blood cells in our
[1:32:56] body
[1:32:57] because it's a natural thing
[1:32:59] and we know this is a natural thing but
[1:33:02] it has a spiritual application
[1:33:04] that you shed your blood for each one of
[1:33:06] us that your word could be revealed into
[1:33:09] our hearts
[1:33:10] bless us all together in you in Jesus
[1:33:13] name
[1:33:25] come morning

[1:34:03] and rejected
[1:34:06] and I question
[1:34:09] oh Father
[1:34:12] how long
[1:34:15] then I'll take one
[1:34:18] more look

[1:34:54] through the midnight
[1:34:58] come morning
[1:35:03] for me

[1:35:11] of really sincere
[1:35:15] if we realize what this is and what's
[1:35:18] taking place
[1:35:20] it is not then no more symbol
[1:35:24] you know
[1:35:26] it's a reality in our hearts and lives

[1:36:48] you can be seated for a moment well
[1:36:52] we're preparing getting ready
[1:37:00] reading in John the 13th chapter verse
[1:37:03] 2.
[1:37:05] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:37:07] now put into the heart of Judas is Care
[1:37:09] at Simon's son to betray him
[1:37:11] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:37:13] all things into his hands
[1:37:15] that he was come from God and went to
[1:37:16] God
[1:37:17] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:37:19] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:37:21] himself after that he poured water into
[1:37:23] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:37:25] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:37:27] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:37:30] to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him
[1:37:32] Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus
[1:37:34] answered and said unto him what I do
[1:37:37] that I know it's not now
[1:37:40] but Thou shalt no Hereafter Peter saith
[1:37:42] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[1:37:44] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[1:37:47] thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter
[1:37:50] saith unto him Lord not my feet only but
[1:37:52] also my hands in my head
[1:37:54] Jesus saith unto him he that is worse
[1:37:56] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[1:37:59] it's clean never wit and you are clean
[1:38:02] but not all
[1:38:04] for he knew who should betray him
[1:38:06] therefore said he you're not all clean
[1:38:09] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:38:13] had taken his garments and was set down
[1:38:14] again he said unto them know you what
[1:38:17] I've done to you
[1:38:18] you call me master and Lord and you say
