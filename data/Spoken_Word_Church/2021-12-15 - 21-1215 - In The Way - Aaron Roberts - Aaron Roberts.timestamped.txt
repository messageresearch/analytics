[0:00] i don't know who loves going back to
[0:01] make things right with people but i know
[0:04] for me it's hard sometimes
[0:05] [Laughter]
[0:07] so um anyway i had a situation with my
[0:10] um
[0:11] my son have two friends to go to school
[0:13] with
[0:14] and uh
[0:17] he hangs out with them often because
[0:19] they play sports together
[0:20] so um i didn't get a chance to meet the
[0:22] mother yet so one day um isaac calls me
[0:27] um
[0:28] a little bit later than he should have
[0:29] been and asked me if he could spend the
[0:31] night
[0:32] so my thing is like i've been trying to
[0:34] school him isaac do not call me at the
[0:36] last minute let me meet the parents
[0:38] first let me you know get things in
[0:40] order and this is something i
[0:42] try to drill in his head since he was
[0:44] little but obviously that didn't work
[0:46] that day he just felt like i'm gonna
[0:48] call mom at the last minute to see if i
[0:50] can stay the night okay so he caught me
[0:51] off guard and um
[0:54] and i was like isaac i told you
[0:57] don't call me at the last minute and
[0:59] exit me something like that when you
[1:00] already know what i'm going to say i
[1:01] don't know these people so i didn't know
[1:03] that this lady heard me saying that you
[1:05] know i didn't know she could hear me
[1:07] having that conversation with him
[1:09] so uh
[1:10] you know as it gets home or whatever i
[1:13] get a phone call i think maybe the next
[1:14] day and uh didn't go too well you know i
[1:17] i she had some things to say and um
[1:20] and
[1:22] i felt
[1:23] uncomfortable and i didn't say all the
[1:24] right things either i was trying to stay
[1:26] calm but you know when you get all your
[1:27] adrenaline going and you kind of like
[1:29] you know
[1:30] so um anyway long story short
[1:32] i felt bad i started feeling bad later
[1:35] and it started bothering me
[1:37] um
[1:38] but i kind of gave all kind of reasoning
[1:40] and justified well she called me she
[1:42] started it and you know god i i you know
[1:46] i gave all the reasons why i shouldn't
[1:47] have to go back but yet the little voice
[1:49] like no go back and make it right i'm
[1:50] like ah
[1:51] every time i pass her house you get a
[1:53] little funny feeling of you know i think
[1:55] i even seen her in the grocery store
[1:56] because we stayed in a small town and
[1:58] i'm trying to dodge and go to the next
[1:59] aisle and everything you know so it
[2:00] started getting a little bit out of hand
[2:02] so
[2:04] so i'm wrestling with god like oh my god
[2:06] i don't want to i don't want to be the
[2:07] one going back you know so um
[2:10] it came to a point where god you know no
[2:12] matter how i try to flush it out you
[2:13] that little voice still there
[2:15] still there won't go away and i'm
[2:17] feeling tormented and everything and
[2:18] satan tried to add more to that as time
[2:21] goes on you know with other people or
[2:23] other things he's like man i got four
[2:24] things to go back and make right man
[2:26] so um anyway i mean it started it
[2:29] started to really like cause panics
[2:31] attacks and everything stress all kind
[2:33] of stuff start happening over these few
[2:35] little things
[2:36] i was like i gotta get this right i mean
[2:37] and satan try to make it huger than what
[2:39] it is right just make it huger than what
[2:42] it really is
[2:43] i'm reasoning what's she gonna think
[2:44] what's she gonna say what if she don't
[2:45] accept my apology what is this what is
[2:47] that you know all kind of stuff so um i
[2:50] reached out and got prayer from um some
[2:52] of the sisters that i keep in touch with
[2:54] i'm like look pray for me i got to make
[2:56] things right so i can be able to
[2:58] continue my journey you know so um
[3:01] anyway i got prayed for and everything
[3:02] and um this is probably like maybe a
[3:04] month or month and a half later so
[3:06] finally i realized i got to go back and
[3:08] make it right because they might can get
[3:10] away with whatever they do or say but
[3:11] god holds us accountable more
[3:13] we're not we can't do like everybody
[3:15] else it just he deals with you as
[3:18] his child
[3:19] so i'm like okay all right i'm looking
[3:21] up all kinds of scriptures to encourage
[3:22] me and everything and um so finally
[3:24] i prayed up prayed i prayed up um
[3:27] still feeling that wrestling
[3:29] moment in my head like oh you know so
[3:31] finally i sit on my couch one day
[3:34] and i felt a small little subtle feeling
[3:36] come over me so peaceful so calm and it
[3:39] was like make that phone call right now
[3:42] to her
[3:43] and it was like i felt the other all the
[3:45] other emotions was kind of like at a
[3:47] standstill i don't know how i don't know
[3:48] how i'm feeling it but i'm feeling it it
[3:50] was like everything else was like at a
[3:51] standstill as if it had to stop
[3:55] and this small set of voice was the one
[3:58] that was in forefront of all these other
[4:00] emotions and i knew my spirit oh my god
[4:02] now's the time to call her so i called
[4:04] her
[4:05] she didn't pick up so i left a message
[4:07] and um i explained to her how i
[4:09] apologize and
[4:10] you know i said i would love to talk to
[4:12] you and everything and just clear make
[4:14] some things clear to you so you can
[4:15] understand clearly on
[4:17] um you know i know what you heard
[4:18] probably sound very bad and i it wasn't
[4:20] an attack on your family at all but i
[4:22] would love to talk to you just to
[4:23] clarify everything
[4:24] so um i get a text back from her later
[4:26] and she said oh thank you so much you
[4:28] know i would love to talk to you i'll
[4:29] call you you know at the end of the week
[4:30] whatever so anyway long story short um
[4:33] she calls me we talk
[4:35] it went so peaceful i learned so much
[4:37] about her and she was so sorry how she
[4:39] handled it because she was going through
[4:41] a lot and everything and she explained
[4:43] everything she went through even as a
[4:44] child and i was like wow you know
[4:46] and um i mean just to get everything out
[4:48] and get everything right i felt so good
[4:51] and you almost
[4:52] you know just you feel that extension of
[4:54] hope and peace and joy and all the
[4:56] fruits of the spirits that you should be
[4:58] feeling you know and even extending it
[5:00] to somebody else and giving her hope and
[5:02] everything and you know just
[5:04] it was so it felt so good and it just
[5:06] kind of broke down the barriers to do
[5:07] that to
[5:08] um everybody else that i was dealing
[5:11] with too that i had to go back and make
[5:12] a few things right so i just want to
[5:13] encourage everybody if something going
[5:15] on it might even be like the right thing
[5:17] to do but it might be the right time god
[5:19] will give you to do it so you can
[5:21] actually do the right thing but at the
[5:22] wrong time because you don't know what's
[5:23] going on on their side so god can give
[5:25] you that little piece to let you know
[5:26] when it's time and when it's when it's
[5:28] good to do it you know
[5:30] that's it
[5:34] hey man
[5:46] i just want to encourage men and women
[5:48] men and women over 50 get this shingle
[5:51] shot
[5:53] no one wants to experience what i just
[5:55] went through
[5:56] and even if you've had them before you
[5:58] can get them again
[6:00] get the shot i'm not an advocate for
[6:03] vaccines and stuff
[6:04] but as soon as this is cleared up with
[6:07] me
[6:08] susan's getting the shot
[6:09] because i don't ever want to experience
[6:12] this again
[6:13] and
[6:14] really for it was hard for me
[6:16] but for really elderly people
[6:19] it could be detrimental it really could
[6:22] so i encourage everybody if you're they
[6:24] won't give you the shot to your 50
[6:27] if you're 50 and above
[6:29] man or woman get the shot
[6:35] i mean it's good

[26:58] ceasing
[26:59] and that man asked general jackson he
[27:01] said well how can you pray without
[27:02] ceasing
[27:04] he said i can't do anything without
[27:06] praying
[27:07] he said i didn't he said i don't open a
[27:09] letter unless i pray about before or
[27:11] read it
[27:13] he said i don't drop a letter in the
[27:14] mailbox until i pray for the person
[27:18] he said i don't take a drink of water
[27:19] without
[27:20] he said it it's just as natural to pray
[27:23] for that water it is as to open my mouth
[27:26] to receive it
[27:28] it's so and then he was talking about
[27:31] he said i prayed for my students when he
[27:33] was he was an instructor at virginia

[30:35] chapter 9
[30:37] verse 1 says
[30:38] now there was a man of benjamin who
[30:40] whose name was kish
[30:43] the son of abial the son of zeor
[30:46] the son of becoreth
[30:49] the son of apha
[30:52] a benjamin knight
[30:54] a mighty man of power and he had a son
[30:57] whose name was saul a choice young man
[31:00] and a goodly
[31:02] and there was not among the children of
[31:04] israel a goodlier person than he
[31:08] from his shoulders and upward he was
[31:10] higher
[31:11] than any of the people
[31:16] just just imagine that
[31:19] that's what you think about where saul
[31:22] started
[31:23] and the asses of kish saul's father were
[31:26] lost and kish said to saul his son now
[31:28] take one of the servants with thee and
[31:31] arise go seek the asses
[31:34] and he passed through the mountain
[31:36] ephraim and passed through the land
[31:38] of shalitia
[31:41] but they found them not and they passed
[31:43] through the land of shalom
[31:44] and there they were not
[31:47] and he passed through the land of the
[31:49] benjaminites
[31:50] and they found them not
[31:52] and when they were come to the land of
[31:55] zeus
[31:56] saul said to his servant that was with
[31:58] him come and let us return lest my
[32:00] father leave caring for the asses and
[32:03] take thought for us
[32:04] and he said unto him behold now there is
[32:07] in this city a man of god and he is an
[32:10] honorable man all that he saith
[32:13] cometh surely to pass and now let us go
[32:16] thither pre-adventure he can show us our
[32:19] way that we should go
[32:22] then said saul to his servant behold if
[32:25] we go
[32:26] what shall we bring them in for the man
[32:29] for the bread is spent in our vessels
[32:30] and there is not a present to bring to
[32:33] the man of god
[32:35] what have we
[32:37] and the servant answered so
[32:39] again and said behold i have
[32:42] here a man the fourth part of a shackle
[32:44] of silver that will i give to the man of
[32:46] god to tell us our way
[32:49] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[32:50] seated
[32:52] and
[32:59] just want to
[33:01] look here in the scripture
[33:03] on the
[33:05] looking at
[33:06] part of saul's life
[33:08] and you know
[33:11] it's a it's amazing when you
[33:13] think about
[33:14] saul and
[33:16] what the scripture said about him was a
[33:17] was a a great young man
[33:20] he had a had a good upbringing
[33:25] and
[33:26] and you know he went out to do the work
[33:27] of his father and
[33:29] and we know that as the scripture tells
[33:31] us here you know they went looking for
[33:33] the
[33:34] for the
[33:35] animals the donkeys and you know
[33:38] and many times in our lives we look at
[33:40] things that come our way and
[33:42] just just as as saul no doubt thought
[33:45] this was hey this is just
[33:47] doing the father's work and you know
[33:49] just the day-to-day type thing that
[33:51] we're going through but you know
[33:53] when he come to that place
[33:56] he come into that
[33:57] area
[33:59] after they've done all of
[34:00] the journeying through and trying to
[34:02] find
[34:03] the donkeys they come to that place but
[34:06] you know it's a servant just happened to
[34:08] mention it's like you know there's a man
[34:10] of god in this area right here
[34:12] we've reached this place and you know we
[34:14] ought to go see him because the things
[34:17] that he says of god surely come to pass
[34:20] he said you know and we've looked for
[34:22] these animals and no doubt
[34:24] he can tell us where these animals are
[34:26] and we don't we don't have to keep
[34:27] looking for them
[34:30] but you know
[34:31] saul
[34:32] knowing and as a scripture tells us saul
[34:35] was like well we don't have anything to
[34:37] bring to him
[34:40] because
[34:41] that when the when they would go to see
[34:42] the seers or the prophets you know they
[34:45] had respect unto them to bring them
[34:47] something
[34:48] and it showed it showed respect under
[34:50] the office of the prophet
[34:52] and so when you know when they come and
[34:54] had just that little bit to bring to him
[34:57] he's like well we'll go and see
[35:00] but you know we read later on in in the
[35:02] chapter if you read the chapter and
[35:05] you know we know that as
[35:08] saul and the servant they bego to try to
[35:11] find samuel
[35:13] god has already spoken to samuel and
[35:16] told him
[35:18] that there's a benjamite coming
[35:21] that i've called
[35:24] and so he's looking at this as just as a
[35:26] happenstance kind of situation but he
[35:28] don't realize that he is in the way that
[35:31] god has called him in
[35:33] and so you know he's like well we are in
[35:35] this way because this is this is my what
[35:37] my father's asked me to do
[35:40] and then the
[35:41] the servant says we need to go see the
[35:43] prophet
[35:44] and so here's in the way well let's go
[35:46] find the prophet
[35:48] and he just thinks we're just doing this
[35:50] because we're trying to find my father's
[35:53] animals we're just doing what the father
[35:55] said
[35:57] and saul don't realize that god has
[35:58] called him
[36:00] because because the scripture tells us
[36:02] beforehand
[36:04] that samuel is told of the lord
[36:07] that that saul is coming and he said i'm
[36:09] going to make him king that i'm going to
[36:12] make him a leader in israel
[36:14] and it and that we know that samuel had
[36:16] already set aside a portion of meat
[36:19] for samuel and saul to eat
[36:23] he'd already prepared prepared all these
[36:25] things that planned these things to take
[36:26] place and what was going to take place
[36:28] and here's saul going into this
[36:30] situation and and he's just there and
[36:33] you know kind of
[36:35] taken aback by the things that when saw
[36:37] when because they go and they look for
[36:39] him and they don't even know who samuel
[36:40] is and when they come out there and they
[36:42] start looking for him and the first
[36:43] thing that samuel tells him he says i'm
[36:45] the seer saul
[36:48] and then no doubt catches you know saul
[36:50] off guard because you know i'm looking
[36:52] for this man i don't know who he is but
[36:53] i know he's a seer and they you know he
[36:55] asked about him and everything but
[36:57] when he walks into the presence of
[36:59] samuel then samuel begins to explain to
[37:01] him what his job is what god has
[37:04] has called him to
[37:06] you found favor in the eyes of god
[37:08] because you are to be anointed to be a
[37:11] leader
[37:12] god has called you to something
[37:15] and the first thing that we see that
[37:17] saul says
[37:18] it talks about you know i i come from a
[37:21] small tribe
[37:22] you know how am i going to be called up
[37:24] to do anything
[37:26] because he sees that he sees himself
[37:28] because when samuel begins to prophesy
[37:30] to him saul
[37:33] saul begins to see
[37:34] hey i'm inadequate at doing this
[37:38] he has he because he has humility at the
[37:40] fact that god is calling him and
[37:42] realizing i can't do this
[37:44] why would god call me and he sees that
[37:46] he sees he steps in to a realm of
[37:47] humility understanding the
[37:50] vastness of the job that's been laid
[37:52] before him
[37:54] but samuel was telling me listen
[37:56] god has called you
[37:58] and not only has he called you to this
[38:01] but i'm but i'm gonna but you know he
[38:03] sat him before the people and he fed him
[38:04] but he said listen you're going to be on
[38:06] this journey and you're going to see
[38:07] these landmarks along the way that you
[38:10] know that you're heading in the right
[38:11] direction
[38:13] you know when he when he leaves from
[38:16] samuel as as he begins to travel you
[38:19] know he goes on this journey you know as
[38:20] he begins to leave he tells him he said
[38:22] listen you know you're going to meet men
[38:23] that have bread and they have kids and
[38:25] he said they're going to give you
[38:26] portions and then you're going to
[38:27] continue on and he said then when you
[38:29] get into the land of the uh the i
[38:31] believe the philistines you know when
[38:32] you go on he said then you get into this
[38:34] place he said then you're going to run
[38:36] into the school of the prophets
[38:38] and he said you know he said when you
[38:39] reach this place he said the anointing
[38:41] is going to fall upon you and you're
[38:43] going to begin to prophesy
[38:46] and the scripture tells us that when he
[38:47] began to do these things he said then
[38:50] all of a sudden exactly what samuel had
[38:52] told him happened
[38:54] and then and not only had had saul god
[38:57] had spoken to saul
[38:59] but then all of a sudden the people
[39:01] began to see because when he began to
[39:04] prophesy he's like
[39:06] saul's with the prophets
[39:08] why because he began to so people began
[39:11] to see that the anointing had landed on
[39:13] saul god had called him and people began
[39:16] to see so you know it's the same way
[39:18] with you and i you know we you don't
[39:19] have to work yourself into something
[39:22] you don't why because if you're anointed
[39:24] of god and god has called you then he's
[39:26] going to anoint you for the job
[39:28] and you know what you don't have to you
[39:30] don't have to fight
[39:31] you don't have to struggle
[39:34] why because if you're in the way
[39:37] as jesus said i am the way the truth and
[39:39] the life so if we're in christ
[39:42] then you know we don't fight we don't
[39:43] have to fuss we don't why because god
[39:45] makes a way
[39:48] but you know it's just like it's just
[39:49] like saul he was standing there and
[39:50] don't well how am i supposed to do these
[39:53] things
[39:54] what samuel wanted him to understand to
[39:56] be encouraged
[39:59] listen you're not doing this because god
[40:01] has anointed you to do it
[40:04] and if he's anointed you to do it then
[40:06] it's not you're going to have to do it
[40:07] by yourself
[40:09] it's not it's not you doing this it's
[40:11] god leading you
[40:14] and so you know that that's the way it
[40:16] is to start out is to know how god's
[40:18] gonna lead you
[40:20] i don't i don't try to lean in my own
[40:23] intellect
[40:25] or my own understanding the scripture
[40:27] tells us you know not not to lean on our
[40:29] own understanding
[40:32] you know because if if god has called us
[40:34] and he's and he's gifted us well then
[40:36] you know what god is the one that
[40:37] operates the gift
[40:40] as brother roman said when when it come
[40:42] to preaching you know god placed a gift
[40:44] in a man he said but you operate the
[40:46] gift
[40:47] amen
[40:48] so when we come up here it's it's not us
[40:51] having to do anything right right
[40:55] but it's but it's it's a
[40:57] it's a harmony
[41:00] it it it is it is a
[41:02] a synchronous
[41:04] operation amen
[41:06] because you know what they you know it
[41:08] would it's it's really hard to preach to
[41:10] the walls
[41:15] if you if you're if you ever tried to do
[41:17] it
[41:19] you know because you know
[41:21] it because that's not the way it was
[41:23] designed
[41:26] and and so when you when you get into a
[41:27] situation you know and it's and you know
[41:30] we just don't come to church you know so
[41:32] somebody we're just going to sit here
[41:34] and we're going to listen to the
[41:35] preacher
[41:36] right
[41:37] well you know what then then you're not
[41:39] in you're not in the in the right
[41:40] atmosphere in the right way then then
[41:42] the preacher you know i i was listening
[41:46] to uh i went back and listened to
[41:49] when uh
[41:51] brother daryl ward was here
[41:54] you know and he got up here and he said
[41:56] he said who's gonna help me preach this
[41:57] morning all right
[41:59] and he said what the rest of you going
[42:01] to do
[42:03] because you know he only got a few hands
[42:04] raised he was like well you know because
[42:06] you know it works that way
[42:08] you know you know everybody everybody
[42:09] likes free even if you just smile at the
[42:11] preacher it's nice
[42:15] if you even if you naught off for a
[42:16] while if you wake up just smile
[42:19] it's a benefit
[42:22] as brother donny reagan always said not
[42:24] a little louder
[42:27] but i mean at least at least you know
[42:29] you don't look like you know people are
[42:30] mad at you
[42:33] i mean you know
[42:35] it's it's really hard when you know and
[42:36] and it's in it and i know it bothers
[42:39] other people but let me tell you it does
[42:41] not bother me whatsoever if you go to
[42:43] sleep
[42:44] if you nod off it don't bother me
[42:47] because you know what i'm just going to
[42:48] continue to preach to the people that
[42:50] are watching
[42:52] amen
[42:53] and if you nod off and you only get part
[42:55] of it that's okay we'll be here when you
[42:56] wake up
[42:59] because you know what i've i i honestly
[43:01] i've been there
[43:04] you know i have i've come to church on
[43:06] wednesday nights and and it's it's
[43:08] everything you can do you put everything
[43:09] into it just to stay awake
[43:13] we're human beings i understand that
[43:17] and you know but it's it's okay i
[43:19] understand
[43:20] but you know i mean it but it's it's a
[43:22] it's a working together
[43:26] you know i've never seen a if you've
[43:28] never had to stand behind a pulpit even
[43:30] if you just have to get up here and read
[43:32] the announcements or read prayer
[43:34] requests
[43:35] it's nice to have somebody smile at you
[43:39] or nod or something
[43:42] you know because you know when you when
[43:44] you get up here i mean it's
[43:45] even when you do public speaking if
[43:47] you're not just preaching but i mean if
[43:49] just in public having to get up before
[43:51] people you know it's nice to have
[43:52] somebody if you feel like they're on
[43:54] your side
[43:59] and so
[44:01] that was free
[44:05] yes
[44:06] but you know it's it's all of us working
[44:08] together we all have to be in the same
[44:10] in the same because you know as we get
[44:13] here it's not just that you know we're
[44:15] just here to warm up you but it's us to
[44:18] be in the same atmosphere to create the
[44:20] atmosphere to be in the same be in the
[44:23] spirit
[44:25] because you know as as you know
[44:28] you you go to a ball game or or a movie
[44:30] or anything like that everybody gets
[44:32] engrossed in it
[44:35] you know i've never seen anybody walk in
[44:37] to a ball game and you know they go into
[44:39] this ball game and it's like well i'm
[44:41] just here
[44:45] you know because somebody comes if
[44:46] because they've went someplace and
[44:48] they've done something
[44:51] most of the time when you go to a
[44:52] ballgame you've had to pay money
[44:55] it's cost you something well because
[44:57] you've had to put something in well you
[44:58] know what i expect something in return
[45:01] but you didn't come there was like well
[45:02] you know what i don't like either one of
[45:04] these teams and i'm just here
[45:07] i've never seen anybody do that have you
[45:13] know if i'm gonna if i'm gonna watch a
[45:15] ball game i want somebody on you know
[45:18] and and adam adam you know he he's a big
[45:21] football fan
[45:23] and adam he has he has this thing it's
[45:25] like you can't you can't watch football
[45:27] unless you have somebody
[45:28] do you who you pulling for
[45:30] well i just like i'm just enjoying the
[45:32] game
[45:34] i'm just enjoying the game i don't have
[45:36] to have a dog in the fight as they say
[45:38] i'm just enjoying it
[45:41] but you know it's like no you got to
[45:43] have somebody to root for
[45:44] but you know you don't see people going
[45:46] there's like
[45:47] you know i i'm just here
[45:49] i wish i was at home
[45:51] i wish i was somewhere else
[45:54] but i paid good money to be here
[45:58] had said no one ever i've never met
[46:00] anybody have you
[46:02] so if we come to church then we should
[46:05] have an expectation
[46:08] if we come to church then you know
[46:10] because you know when i when i come to
[46:12] here tonight i didn't i didn't come just
[46:14] to see all of you
[46:16] oh that's that's nice
[46:19] but you know what it would be an utter
[46:21] failure if christ didn't come if god
[46:23] didn't come and speak to us tonight here
[46:25] then you know what we gathered in vain
[46:27] then it's worth it it's worthless to be
[46:29] here we wasted our time
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:32] but you know we come with an expectation
[46:35] to be here
[46:36] we set aside this time to be here
[46:39] tonight
[46:40] so when we come in the door then when we
[46:43] made an expectation to because he said
[46:46] that wherever two or three are gathered
[46:47] in my name he said i'm there in the
[46:49] midst
[46:50] so if he's here tonight then what did he
[46:52] come here to
[46:54] do you know god didn't come here tonight
[46:57] just to run a
[46:58] tangle up and down your spine
[47:01] [Music]
[47:03] because you know what if he doesn't
[47:04] speak to you from the word then what's
[47:06] the gathering about
[47:08] because you know we can stand in the
[47:09] presence of god but you know what if he
[47:11] doesn't speak to us from the word then
[47:13] we've missed it
[47:15] well because we stand in the presence of
[47:16] god to commune with him it's to speak to
[47:19] him and have him speak to us then it's
[47:21] lord what are you trying to say to me
[47:25] what have you said to me lord i just
[47:27] want i just want to sit here tonight and
[47:29] open up
[47:31] and lay aside everything else i want to
[47:33] push the world outside that i can talk
[47:35] to you that you can talk to me that when
[47:37] i leave here tonight then i've heard
[47:38] something
[47:39] that's changed my life
[47:43] and i just said say well we've had it
[47:44] we've had a good uh social gathering
[47:47] we've had our religious duty
[47:50] well if it if we've not heard it if not
[47:53] change somebody's life because brother
[47:55] branham said you either leave here
[47:57] better or worse than you got here
[47:59] right
[48:00] and sometimes well i didn't get nothing
[48:02] out of that service
[48:04] well you know
[48:06] it's time to check up
[48:08] lord what what was i supposed to get out
[48:11] of this service
[48:13] and lots of times you know what it's a
[48:15] so it's a seed being sown
[48:18] i walked out i walked out of services
[48:20] and i had no idea what was said
[48:24] i was more confused when i got when i
[48:26] got out and it's like you know but you
[48:27] know what
[48:29] it's like well that was a waste of time
[48:31] well sometimes it's not a waste of time
[48:34] you know why because the lord put
[48:36] something in your way
[48:38] and you know what now it's time for you
[48:40] to do something about it
[48:42] what are you going to do about it
[48:44] why no because how many times have you
[48:46] heard i've heard preachers preach things
[48:49] and it just and it just i mean it just
[48:51] something just grabs a hold of me
[48:54] and i let me tell you
[48:55] i don't know what it is but it's just
[48:57] like this doesn't this is not what right
[48:59] with the word there's just i mean it
[49:01] just it sticks as they say it sticks in
[49:03] your crawl there's just something
[49:05] i mean it just i mean yeah the the
[49:08] spirit just
[49:09] it it just i mean you know it locks up i
[49:12] mean it's just like you get this warning
[49:14] it's like and then you're trying to
[49:15] figure out what the problem is but you
[49:17] don't know
[49:20] you know i think about when brother
[49:21] branham was reading the questions in in
[49:23] uh the
[49:25] seals when he's doing questions and
[49:27] answers you know he read the question
[49:28] wrong and then all of a sudden you know
[49:30] he stops
[49:32] in the middle of all that and he's like
[49:33] well who's sick what's going on
[49:36] you know because something called just
[49:38] like that was wrong but you know he
[49:39] didn't understand what was going on and
[49:41] then the brother tells him said read the
[49:42] question again
[49:44] and then he realizes oh i've read i've
[49:45] misread that he said then i spoke and
[49:47] realized oh i've answered the question
[49:49] wrong the holy ghost called him
[49:52] well you know sometimes i've had i've
[49:54] held on to questions for years
[49:58] and i could and it's just like i i you
[50:00] you see things but you
[50:02] you see things that brother branham said
[50:04] and things that are said people what
[50:06] people believe it's like
[50:08] but i don't see that
[50:10] and you just struggle with it
[50:13] and he and so you know god gives you
[50:14] those things and and
[50:16] not to not
[50:18] hate to say this but you know it's not
[50:20] like you're wrestling with it but you
[50:22] know it's something like mary you it's
[50:24] something you hold on to
[50:27] it say it said she heard the things that
[50:28] gabriel had said and the scripture said
[50:30] she pondered them in her heart
[50:33] and so you take the things that you've
[50:35] heard and you begin to work with those
[50:37] things and you know and because you know
[50:39] that's the i tell everybody i told
[50:42] brother dale many times i said the two
[50:44] best preach you know the two kinds of
[50:45] preachers that i like the good ones and
[50:46] the bad ones
[50:49] the good ones because they'll help you
[50:51] but sometimes the bad ones will put
[50:53] stuff out there and it's like
[50:55] what
[50:59] then all of a sudden it's like well you
[51:01] know what i'm going to study up on that
[51:03] they say you know when you hear
[51:05] something wrong it's like you go and ask
[51:07] somebody questions like
[51:09] well what do you think explain this show
[51:11] me
[51:13] and then you then you have you know
[51:15] some brother or something or even when
[51:17] you have a question how many times have
[51:18] you ever had a question about something
[51:20] you're reading and you're and you're
[51:21] looking at something and just like
[51:23] philip in the in the eunuch you know
[51:24] he's sitting there reading all this
[51:25] stuff and philip shows up and says hey
[51:27] do you understand what you're reading
[51:29] no i don't
[51:31] is he speaking to someone else or he's
[51:32] speaking of himself and then all of a
[51:34] sudden philip begins to speak the word
[51:36] to him it begins to open up
[51:39] how many times have you heard you know
[51:40] you're sitting there reading something
[51:42] you don't understand and all of a sudden
[51:43] brother brown said that god was
[51:45] obligated to put a man behind the pulpit
[51:47] to answer the question
[51:49] how many times have you ever read
[51:50] something or you heard something and
[51:52] it's like you're dwelling on that and
[51:55] the person sitting behind the pulpit
[51:56] opens up and begins to speak on that
[51:58] very subject
[52:01] and all of a sudden it's like oh i see
[52:02] that now
[52:04] and sometimes it's so simple but you
[52:06] know what it takes god to open it up
[52:09] it's not it's not us
[52:12] but it's god's leading us
[52:14] begin to speak
[52:15] the word to us
[52:19] so it's us
[52:21] let him be in the way
[52:25] be
[52:28] if we're in christ
[52:30] let him lead that's right
[52:34] see there's only
[52:35] one place
[52:37] is to be in christ
[52:40] if you're in christ
[52:45] it's not it it's it's not just
[52:47] our own
[52:48] way of going
[52:50] right
[52:51] but he said i am the way the truth and
[52:53] the life there's a he has he has a wife
[52:55] for us
[52:58] and many times we look back over our
[53:00] lives and we wonder why things happen
[53:01] the way that they do and the things that
[53:04] have happened and we question things and
[53:06] just like you know all things work
[53:07] together for the good
[53:09] and it's like well lord i'm trying to
[53:11] find the good in it
[53:14] and you know it takes minutes sometimes
[53:16] it takes many many years for us to get
[53:18] to the point where we can look back and
[53:19] say well thank the lord for all those
[53:21] problems
[53:23] why because we've been on we've been on
[53:25] this journey for a long time we've been
[53:27] on this road
[53:29] on this journey we've been in the way
[53:32] but many times you know people can get
[53:34] discouraged along the way
[53:37] but as brother brown said you know god's
[53:39] made the promise it's god's promise to
[53:42] you to lead you and so
[53:44] this is from um
[53:51] this is from melchizedek
[53:53] the great
[53:54] prince and king
[53:58] in 1955 brother says and now we've found
[54:01] salvation that will save us from sin
[54:03] that would take the vilest woman or man
[54:05] drunkard prostitute and make them a
[54:07] child of god well that same faith that
[54:09] same power
[54:10] that will lift up a fallen man or woman
[54:12] like that it'll work for us
[54:15] in many different ways
[54:17] it'll heal our bodies if you can just
[54:19] find the right approach
[54:22] you've got to find how to do it
[54:25] like if i had a farm over on this hill
[54:27] full of good grain
[54:29] and excuse me it's just about death on a
[54:31] count of water
[54:32] and i've got an artesian well on this
[54:34] side of the hill well i can't make that
[54:37] artesian well throw the water
[54:39] down here
[54:40] and up this side of the hill to water it
[54:43] but i've got to survey that land and
[54:46] find out how that water will take its
[54:48] own current and course and come around
[54:50] and water that crop it'll do it if we
[54:52] just let it run its own channel
[54:55] he said and that's the same thing the
[54:57] holy ghost is in god's promise he said
[55:00] if we'll just let it run its way and not
[55:03] us get in the way
[55:05] not us throw our doubts there because
[55:08] this didn't or that didn't
[55:10] just let god's holy spirit working in
[55:13] you rest upon that promise it'll do it
[55:16] just exactly what god said
[55:21] so if we if we have a way then we just
[55:23] don't let
[55:24] let ourselves get in the way
[55:26] but knowing that he's got the way he is
[55:29] the way and his and and so he said all
[55:31] we got to do is have the right approach
[55:35] to find the way that god wants to work
[55:39] so we understand that i i you know then
[55:42] we know
[55:43] to find out what god wants us to do
[55:48] many times we have problems in our lives
[55:50] and and the biggest problem that we have
[55:52] is we kind of mess with it
[55:55] that's right
[55:57] you know
[55:58] i i think it's donnie's got a sign at
[56:00] the shop and you know it's mechanic fees
[56:02] and
[56:03] you know one of them is so many dollars
[56:05] if if you want the mechanic to fix it
[56:07] but you know it's more if you want it if
[56:09] you want it done fast
[56:11] if you want it done correct
[56:14] but you know one of the highest fees
[56:16] that you have to pay one of the highest
[56:17] mechanics one is you if you've worked on
[56:19] it before you have to pay more than
[56:21] anybody else
[56:26] it's not it's the highest bill why
[56:27] because you've messed with it
[56:32] and many times we want we want god to
[56:34] fix our problems and the problem is is
[56:35] we've muddled with it
[56:37] and we won't get our hands out of it
[56:40] you know the little story about the
[56:41] little boy that had the toy and he
[56:42] wanted his daddy to fix it and he said
[56:44] son he said i'm never going to be able
[56:46] to fix it if you don't turn it loose
[56:50] but the problem is is we want to model
[56:51] with it we wanted well i got i got you
[56:54] know you know
[56:55] it's like it's like people when you when
[56:56] you try to tell them the right way to go
[56:59] when they when there's a right way to
[57:01] the right way to approach something and
[57:03] you've got people and it's like no i can
[57:06] do it this way
[57:09] you know one of the worst things if
[57:10] you're in the if you're in a trade
[57:13] if you're a carpenter
[57:15] or you're a plumber or anything else
[57:17] brother gary can tell you and then
[57:18] somebody's like oh i got a cheaper way i
[57:20] got a guy that can do it cheaper
[57:27] and you got somebody that read something
[57:29] on the internet and they're gonna be a
[57:31] diyer and they're gonna they're gonna
[57:33] try to do something
[57:34] [Music]
[57:39] but you know what if you don't follow
[57:41] the principles
[57:44] there's people that's had pictures and
[57:46] you see receptacles standing in the wall
[57:49] and water shooting out the receptacle
[57:50] and they said do i need a plumber or an
[57:52] electrician
[57:58] why because somebody don't know what
[57:59] they're doing amen
[58:03] but somebody thinks oh i'm going to do
[58:04] this and i'm going to do that
[58:07] the problem is is the same way you know
[58:09] god wants us to realize you know what
[58:11] we're not capable of doing everything
[58:15] you know the problem is is we need to
[58:17] step back and say lord i'm going to turn
[58:19] this over to you
[58:22] people have battled things for years and
[58:23] years and years and they go going around
[58:25] the same mountain facing the same
[58:26] problem and you know what the problem is
[58:28] is they're still holding on to it
[58:30] they're still waiting on god to do it
[58:31] and it's like well you know what you've
[58:32] never let go of it
[58:36] you've never put it in god's hands and
[58:37] wall and just
[58:41] and many times the problem is is when we
[58:43] when we get to the place where we put it
[58:44] in god's hands and we take a step back
[58:46] it's like well
[58:48] lord you ain't touched it yet
[58:52] lord jain touched it yet
[58:56] well you know what you put in god's
[58:58] hands and you know what you don't worry
[58:59] about it
[59:02] when you go out and plant a field
[59:05] fill a you know a great crop
[59:08] you know
[59:09] waden them you want to done all that
[59:10] planting out there you don't run out the
[59:12] next day and after
[59:15] see if it no see if them seeds are still
[59:17] there
[59:20] no you know what you prepare the ground
[59:24] that's right you've prepared the ground
[59:28] so you know what we're gonna go through
[59:29] there we're gonna get all the rocks out
[59:31] we're gonna get all the weeds out we're
[59:33] gonna get everything that's not
[59:35] conducive to what we're trying to get
[59:37] done
[59:38] as soon as we get all of that scraped up
[59:40] and thrown out
[59:43] then what we do we need to find out what
[59:44] what's in the soil
[59:48] so when we check the soil what kind of
[59:50] fertilizer it need what fertilizer needs
[59:53] to be added into it
[59:55] so when we figure out exactly what we're
[59:57] trying to grow
[59:58] and what's because you know the worst
[1:00:00] kind of crops you can get is when you're
[1:00:02] out there playing and the soul is is
[1:00:05] absolutely devoid of whatever your
[1:00:07] whatever the needs
[1:00:09] so if it needs nitrogen or whatever else
[1:00:11] and then you know and in there you know
[1:00:12] what
[1:00:13] you're wasting your time
[1:00:17] so what do you do you go down there and
[1:00:18] you can test and find out what needs to
[1:00:20] be done well then you got to get the
[1:00:21] right fertilizer
[1:00:24] well that's the same thing with you and
[1:00:25] i when when we have a problem
[1:00:28] then you know it's like well i'm going
[1:00:30] to figure this out on my own
[1:00:32] no i need to go back to the word of god
[1:00:35] i need to get into the word because you
[1:00:36] know what if if i'm sick
[1:00:40] then you know what the scriptures that
[1:00:42] talk about god's healing
[1:00:44] that god's healing power then you know
[1:00:45] that is what i'm claiming
[1:00:49] by the scripture first peter 2 24 tells
[1:00:52] us he said by his stripes we were healed
[1:00:57] past tense
[1:00:59] so you know what if i need healing then
[1:01:01] you know what it's already a finished
[1:01:03] work of calvary
[1:01:05] he took the stripes on his back
[1:01:09] and you know what it's it it's a it's a
[1:01:11] great dishonor and it's it's a it is a
[1:01:14] great disservice to god
[1:01:16] when when we come and he took those
[1:01:19] stripes on his back
[1:01:22] when he went through all of that for us
[1:01:25] to stand there and doubt what he said he
[1:01:26] would do
[1:01:31] when he came
[1:01:33] here he come all the way through
[1:01:36] he was scorched rejected
[1:01:40] mocked all the things that he suffered
[1:01:42] in this life
[1:01:44] to bring you eternal life
[1:01:48] when we look and see what what he done
[1:01:50] for us and he took those stripes on his
[1:01:52] back
[1:01:53] all the things that he went through in
[1:01:55] this life that he had to struggle and
[1:01:56] pay for all the no human man could go
[1:01:59] through the suffering that he went
[1:02:01] through
[1:02:03] but you know when he went through all of
[1:02:05] that then he rose from the dead and
[1:02:07] conquered and took the the keys of death
[1:02:10] hell in the grave
[1:02:12] he took the keys
[1:02:15] and he gave us overcoming power
[1:02:18] that the scripture tells us he said that
[1:02:20] we're joined we're heirs of god and
[1:02:22] joint heirs with christ
[1:02:24] that he's an overcomer that you and i
[1:02:26] are more than conquerors through him
[1:02:27] that loved us
[1:02:29] then if he's overcome these things then
[1:02:31] you know what it's a dishonor and it's a
[1:02:33] disservice to god to stand up lord will
[1:02:36] you heal me
[1:02:37] well i don't know if the lord's going to
[1:02:38] heal me or not
[1:02:40] that's right
[1:02:41] you know it's it's a you know because
[1:02:43] but that's that's the human nature
[1:02:46] that's the way the devil wants to bring
[1:02:48] it and i want you to approach it as you
[1:02:50] know god's not going to do something why
[1:02:52] it's already done
[1:02:55] it's just like people you know people
[1:02:56] seeking the holy ghost
[1:02:59] he said he wanted to give it to you more
[1:03:01] than you wanted
[1:03:05] well if well if it's a finished work
[1:03:07] that he's that he's given it
[1:03:09] and he sent his word to us
[1:03:14] what is the problem
[1:03:18] it's with us
[1:03:21] as brother brown said one of the
[1:03:22] problems that we have he said because
[1:03:24] people are not taught the new birth
[1:03:28] he said many people just sympathize with
[1:03:30] it but he said they've not been taught
[1:03:32] the truth
[1:03:34] and many people they get to this place
[1:03:36] where the holy ghost is some kind of
[1:03:37] hocus pocus something
[1:03:40] but you know what there's a there's a
[1:03:42] sure way a sure foundation to be built
[1:03:45] upon that will lead you and guide you
[1:03:46] that way
[1:03:49] just one just when you when god calls
[1:03:51] you wherever you were out in the world
[1:03:54] out in sin
[1:03:56] wherever you was
[1:03:59] on a loading dock or you know wherever
[1:04:01] that god comes and speaks to you
[1:04:03] wherever you were at then when god comes
[1:04:05] and speaks to you then you know what you
[1:04:06] had to do is you had to accept him
[1:04:09] when you were in church and and you were
[1:04:11] just sitting in there and maybe you were
[1:04:13] maybe you were there because you wanted
[1:04:15] to see some girl or some guy or mom and
[1:04:17] daddy made you
[1:04:19] but somewhere along the way god called
[1:04:21] your heart spoke to you and called you
[1:04:24] and you answered that call
[1:04:27] well you know what you didn't have to do
[1:04:28] anything to do that
[1:04:31] you had to take god at his word
[1:04:34] well because he began to call to you and
[1:04:36] when he began to call to you then you
[1:04:38] answered that call and said yes lord
[1:04:41] i realize i'm lost
[1:04:45] i'm lost and i need a savior
[1:04:47] and i heard your call
[1:04:50] and i want to answer that call lord i
[1:04:52] want you to be the lord of my life
[1:04:55] and then you know what there's the
[1:04:57] foundation that you lay that you
[1:04:58] understand and say lord i understand
[1:05:00] that i need to be baptized
[1:05:03] and when you come and he said when you
[1:05:05] repent he said and then you be baptized
[1:05:07] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:05:09] remission of sins
[1:05:11] then you understand this is this is my
[1:05:14] act upon your word
[1:05:17] because i've taken you because you've
[1:05:19] spoke to me that i need to that i need
[1:05:21] that i understand the condition that i'm
[1:05:24] in
[1:05:26] and i understand that you've called to
[1:05:28] me to bring me to this place
[1:05:31] and so i'm stepping forward and then
[1:05:32] when you understand that i need to be
[1:05:34] baptized
[1:05:36] well lord i'm going to the water
[1:05:39] why because i'm going to fulfill your
[1:05:41] word
[1:05:42] lord i'm going to do what you asked me
[1:05:43] to do
[1:05:45] well then you know what when you lay
[1:05:46] that foundation he said and you shall
[1:05:48] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:05:51] well then you know what when you've done
[1:05:53] your part then you know what he's
[1:05:54] obligated to do his part
[1:05:57] then we understand that through the
[1:05:59] opening of the word when you walk with
[1:06:00] him in the word
[1:06:02] then you know then hey you still fight
[1:06:04] you still fight the same flesh
[1:06:07] you still got the same desires you go
[1:06:09] through the same struggles
[1:06:12] one because it's still a battle but you
[1:06:13] know what you're still holding on to the
[1:06:15] word
[1:06:16] one because one of the one day as you
[1:06:18] begin to understand
[1:06:20] you become taking on the word then you
[1:06:22] start to understand hey when i get
[1:06:24] closer to god then you know what the
[1:06:25] things of the world lose their
[1:06:27] attraction
[1:06:29] but you know what the devil is trying to
[1:06:31] pull you that way
[1:06:33] he's like well lord you know what i
[1:06:34] still got a temper and i still got all
[1:06:36] these things that keep pulling me back
[1:06:38] but you know what we got to understand
[1:06:39] there's grace there why because he
[1:06:41] called you to begin with then he's going
[1:06:43] to cover you but you got to keep coming
[1:06:44] back
[1:06:47] that's right
[1:06:48] you know i i think about oh uh jim brown
[1:06:52] i was like brother carol always used to
[1:06:54] talk about jim brown you know the great
[1:06:56] big uh running back for fullback for
[1:06:59] cleveland
[1:07:00] you know
[1:07:01] jim brown you know he played and people
[1:07:03] just and the first thing all they wanted
[1:07:05] to do as soon as they got on the field
[1:07:07] with jim brown they said man we're going
[1:07:09] we're going to knock him out today we're
[1:07:10] going to hurt him and that was all they
[1:07:12] done and they would run at gym with
[1:07:14] everything they had and they knocked him
[1:07:16] down and he'd get up and he just
[1:07:18] dusted himself off get right back in the
[1:07:20] huddle and it was like and the guys that
[1:07:22] were hitting him and just about knocked
[1:07:23] himself out and it's like i don't
[1:07:25] understand why he's like that
[1:07:28] and you know what and jim always told
[1:07:30] him he said i'm not ever going to let
[1:07:32] the enemy the other opposing team let
[1:07:34] i'm never going to let them know that
[1:07:35] they hurt me
[1:07:37] he said i get up every single time he
[1:07:39] said i dust myself off he said i get
[1:07:40] back in the huddle he said i do it again
[1:07:42] and again amen and so it's the same way
[1:07:45] you know we don't allow the devil to get
[1:07:47] in the way and try to hold us back
[1:07:50] what do we do you know hey we're going
[1:07:52] to fall you're going to sin you're going
[1:07:54] to have these problems but what do you
[1:07:55] do you go back and you get back under
[1:07:57] the blood and you put it all under the
[1:07:59] blood and you know what then you move on
[1:08:02] we don't we don't have to harp on the
[1:08:04] things that we've done in the past why
[1:08:05] because if god is faithful if he's
[1:08:07] called us to this journey if he's called
[1:08:10] us to this way then brothers and sisters
[1:08:11] then you know what he's putting it under
[1:08:13] the blood and he's forgot about it
[1:08:15] then you know what he's called you into
[1:08:17] this journey to continue on
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:21] but if he's called you that way then you
[1:08:23] know what it's our job we're obligated
[1:08:27] pardon me for a second
[1:08:30] choosing dad
[1:08:31] amen thank you
[1:08:33] i was stepping on some i kept trying to
[1:08:34] figure out where i was going
[1:08:36] standing on my shoestring
[1:08:41] yeah me too
[1:08:43] that would be a bad thing but anyway but
[1:08:46] you know what when we get on this on in
[1:08:48] the way
[1:08:49] then he's made a way
[1:08:51] then you know what god don't want you to
[1:08:53] stop
[1:08:56] god don't want you get tied up in the
[1:08:57] things of the past
[1:09:01] but you know we spend more time dwelling
[1:09:03] on the things of the past
[1:09:07] and you know somebody will say something
[1:09:08] to us and you know we get we get so we
[1:09:11] we we'll spend all day worried about
[1:09:14] things of the past
[1:09:23] and you know many times we get to the
[1:09:24] place you know we've got to come to have
[1:09:27] confidence in god and understand those
[1:09:29] things are past
[1:09:32] you know when it's under the blood then
[1:09:34] then you know what then we don't we need
[1:09:36] to just work on purging our mind getting
[1:09:39] these things out why because the way to
[1:09:40] do that
[1:09:42] is we need to get into the word
[1:09:45] and get into the place because the
[1:09:47] scripture tells me there isn't therefore
[1:09:49] now no condemnation amen
[1:09:55] those that are in christ jesus who walk
[1:09:56] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:09:59] well then you know what if i'm in the
[1:10:00] spirit if i'm walking after him then you
[1:10:03] know this is the way that he wants me to
[1:10:04] go then you know what i don't need to
[1:10:06] worry about the past
[1:10:10] but you know what there comes a day
[1:10:11] because you know as the more we walk in
[1:10:13] the word and the more we walk in the
[1:10:14] word and the more we meditate on the
[1:10:16] word then you know what it does is it
[1:10:18] pushes the old man out
[1:10:20] it pushes that unclean spirit out it's
[1:10:22] got it's got to come out why because the
[1:10:24] word is coming forth
[1:10:27] and there's a process in that
[1:10:30] but you know what you know if you fall
[1:10:32] within time to get back up and continue
[1:10:35] on
[1:10:36] and don't dwell on the past
[1:10:40] and then just keep going forward
[1:10:43] but you know as we see in the word as we
[1:10:44] begin to walk in that and dwell in that
[1:10:47] and meditate in that then you know what
[1:10:48] that unclean spirit's got to be driven
[1:10:50] out
[1:10:51] and then you know because it's it's a
[1:10:53] promise of god for that to take place
[1:10:55] then the same token as you live in the
[1:10:58] word and you dwell in the word and you
[1:10:59] meditate in the word then you know what
[1:11:01] you have faith in god that the the holy
[1:11:03] ghost will come and take up residence
[1:11:06] why because he promised it but it's the
[1:11:08] same it's the same faith you just
[1:11:10] continue to walk day by day by day and
[1:11:12] meditate in the word and he's obligated
[1:11:15] to come to you and you know what you do
[1:11:17] is you stand there and you bring the
[1:11:18] word to god because he said that he
[1:11:20] wants you to bring him the word
[1:11:23] brother branham said he said you become
[1:11:25] the word as you feed on the word and he
[1:11:27] said he'll quicken the word as you bring
[1:11:28] the word to him so what do we do we
[1:11:30] continue to hold the word
[1:11:34] then i'm not giving up i want because i
[1:11:36] have i have this great promise
[1:11:40] have this great promises laid out before
[1:11:41] me that you know i can just keep walking
[1:11:44] i'm walking in the way that god has
[1:11:45] called me to
[1:11:50] but you know many times the problem that
[1:11:52] we get into in our in our walk brother
[1:11:55] bran was talking about and he was
[1:11:56] talking about
[1:11:57] talking about the way
[1:11:58] of holiness
[1:12:00] in a highway of holiness and he talks
[1:12:02] about and there's a way
[1:12:04] and brother bram talks about when you
[1:12:05] get into this way you know he said you
[1:12:07] can be in the he said you can be in the
[1:12:09] highway and be in the gutter
[1:12:13] but he said he said but where you need
[1:12:15] to be is in the middle
[1:12:17] he said because there's this highway
[1:12:20] and he said there's a post on one side
[1:12:21] the post on other you see this great
[1:12:23] road to be that's laid out in front of
[1:12:25] you and he said when you're walking he
[1:12:27] said you need to get up on the highway
[1:12:29] the way up in the in the middle he said
[1:12:31] that because that's where the main he
[1:12:33] said that's where the smooth
[1:12:37] so when we get in there see many times
[1:12:39] we get over on one side we get over here
[1:12:41] too far this way and we get too far over
[1:12:44] here on this side and you know we get we
[1:12:46] get distracted
[1:12:52] you know i got to
[1:12:53] you know leave i was learning how to
[1:12:54] drive
[1:12:57] and let me tell you something
[1:13:00] it's like listen
[1:13:02] and i know he i know he's not going to
[1:13:03] like this but
[1:13:05] you know but you know when you drive you
[1:13:08] you got to follow the the rules
[1:13:11] of the road
[1:13:13] and one of the things i told him i said
[1:13:15] what's the what is the what's the proper
[1:13:17] speed for you to be driving
[1:13:21] and he just gives you this blank look
[1:13:22] the proper speed for you to be driving a
[1:13:25] vehicle that we insure is a speed that
[1:13:28] you can properly handle that vehicle
[1:13:32] it's not what's posted on that black and
[1:13:33] white sign out there
[1:13:37] because if it's 45 and you think you're
[1:13:39] gonna drive more than that and you can't
[1:13:40] handle it no you need to be about 35.
[1:13:46] you need you need to know how fast you
[1:13:48] can handle this car
[1:13:51] you know many times he gets he gets
[1:13:53] distracted with things and and you know
[1:13:55] then all of a sudden he's trying to he's
[1:13:57] trying to make turns on two whales like
[1:13:59] he's driving in the dukes of hazard or
[1:14:01] something and it's like listen listen
[1:14:03] listen you slow this thing down
[1:14:07] one day we were out driving and he was
[1:14:09] all he was all over the place we was
[1:14:10] going we were i think it was
[1:14:12] thanksgiving was going up nicole's my
[1:14:14] sister's house he's out on the road next
[1:14:16] thing i know pull this truck over
[1:14:19] over
[1:14:21] over
[1:14:23] he looked at me like i was what
[1:14:25] over right here
[1:14:27] side of the road
[1:14:28] this paved area right here you see this
[1:14:30] paved area right here we're gonna park
[1:14:31] the truck right there
[1:14:33] out of everybody's way
[1:14:36] and let me tell you something
[1:14:38] let me explain something to you
[1:14:42] when the roads get narrow
[1:14:45] and there's there's a ditch on this side
[1:14:47] and you're weaving across the double
[1:14:48] yellow yellow line going this way
[1:14:50] because you're trying to weave you're
[1:14:51] going too fast
[1:14:55] you're going the wrong way
[1:14:58] because if you can't handle and when you
[1:14:59] get four or five cars behind you
[1:15:02] on a two-lane road
[1:15:04] you find a spot on the side of the road
[1:15:06] and pull a truck over and let everybody
[1:15:09] pass you
[1:15:13] if you're a sunday driver
[1:15:17] on wednesday or any other day of the
[1:15:19] week
[1:15:21] but if you're a sunday driver and you're
[1:15:22] out on the side of the road you're going
[1:15:24] down the road and this posted speed
[1:15:26] limit and you think there's a parade
[1:15:28] going on it's time for you to be
[1:15:30] courteous and pull the vehicle over and
[1:15:32] let everybody else pass
[1:15:36] and they don't cost you nothing either
[1:15:40] but you know when you do this but i
[1:15:42] pulled him over and i want to talk to
[1:15:43] him listen
[1:15:48] we need to have we need to have a little
[1:15:49] conversation
[1:15:52] because when you get back on the road
[1:15:56] then you need to straighten up
[1:15:58] and many times that's what god wants us
[1:16:00] to do god wants us to have his little
[1:16:01] side roadside chat
[1:16:05] got to pull you over to the side and he
[1:16:07] won't have talk with you
[1:16:10] he pulled you over and said listen
[1:16:12] you're going the wrong way
[1:16:14] you're going to look too much this way a
[1:16:16] little bit too much that way you got
[1:16:17] your eyes in the rearview mirror and you
[1:16:19] ain't going in the right direction
[1:16:22] that's right and all of a sudden you
[1:16:23] know we got to slow it down so we can
[1:16:25] get in the right direction
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:29] so you know many times god wants us
[1:16:30] wants us to be mindful of what we're
[1:16:32] doing
[1:16:34] god has a has a way for us to go and we
[1:16:37] need to be mindful of that
[1:16:39] that god has called us and we need to
[1:16:41] follow that path
[1:16:46] when we get wrapped up in things of the
[1:16:48] world or things of of this life and we
[1:16:50] get so wrapped up in things you know
[1:16:51] what then we as as mary
[1:16:54] when when gabriel had come and spoke to
[1:16:57] her and told her
[1:16:59] gabriel had come and told now they set
[1:17:01] up joseph and mary sat out there and
[1:17:04] read the scrolls and talked about that
[1:17:06] god was going to sin the messiah
[1:17:10] that they knew that that that was what
[1:17:12] isaiah said they read the scriptures
[1:17:14] this is what was going
[1:17:15] that he was gonna fulfill these
[1:17:16] scriptures the old testament prophets
[1:17:18] talked about it david talked about it in
[1:17:20] the psalms all these things were going
[1:17:21] to take place
[1:17:23] and they talked about it but when mary
[1:17:25] come when gabriel come to tell mary
[1:17:27] about it
[1:17:29] and then she's like well how can these
[1:17:31] things be
[1:17:35] well you know what
[1:17:36] all god wants you to do is believe
[1:17:40] how how can these things be sin i know
[1:17:42] not a man
[1:17:44] what would gabriel tell her
[1:17:46] the holy ghost is going to overshadow
[1:17:48] you
[1:17:51] amen oh and so all you need to do is
[1:17:53] believe
[1:17:55] just trust in what he said
[1:17:58] and then she said be it unto me
[1:18:00] according to thy word
[1:18:01] so she took exactly what he said and she
[1:18:04] held on to that
[1:18:07] even even when she went lived in a world
[1:18:10] of ridicule and all these things that
[1:18:12] even even when joseph didn't understand
[1:18:14] what was going on
[1:18:18] but you know what joseph had to come to
[1:18:20] his place and he had to have a
[1:18:21] revelation whether the lord could speak
[1:18:23] to him and tell him this is what's going
[1:18:25] to take place this is what's taking
[1:18:27] place
[1:18:29] but then years later after after he was
[1:18:32] born and she had raised and uh you know
[1:18:34] we've seen we've seen the
[1:18:37] the shepherds and and the wise men and
[1:18:39] all these things that happened
[1:18:43] and then simeon prophesy and a
[1:18:46] prophesying all these things that took
[1:18:48] place all the way through the journey
[1:18:51] and then and then one day she's like
[1:18:52] your father and i
[1:18:54] yeah
[1:18:55] salt you with tears
[1:19:00] after all that time god's speaking to
[1:19:02] and then we we deny the the testimony
[1:19:05] deny the word
[1:19:08] and so it's the same thing we can we
[1:19:10] after all the things that we've been
[1:19:11] through and then we stand and deny the
[1:19:12] word
[1:19:14] and it's like well i i don't i don't
[1:19:17] i don't doubt the word
[1:19:19] brother wait i don't it's just like i
[1:19:21] don't see how this is going to take
[1:19:23] place
[1:19:25] and it's like well you know i don't i
[1:19:27] don't want to doubt the word but you
[1:19:28] know the words that come out of my mouth
[1:19:30] is doubting the word
[1:19:32] man
[1:19:34] it's like we're going to what i'm not
[1:19:35] going to say nothing
[1:19:38] as they say you know we energize our our
[1:19:40] mouth before our brains engage
[1:19:44] and we begin to speak things and you
[1:19:46] know it's just like we speak things one
[1:19:47] because the devil tells us that amen
[1:19:51] well you know
[1:19:52] you know just whatever comes
[1:19:56] but you know that's what the holy ghost
[1:19:57] wants us to do is stop no
[1:20:00] i'm not listening to that
[1:20:03] god made a way
[1:20:06] and so when when he when he brought me
[1:20:08] this far and he's done all these things
[1:20:10] when you when you look at the things
[1:20:12] that god has done for you in the past
[1:20:13] and you say well i don't know if god's
[1:20:15] gonna you know it's it's it's a total
[1:20:18] it's a total disrespect to god
[1:20:21] dishonoring god when you look back and
[1:20:23] you sit down
[1:20:24] and just write down and think about all
[1:20:25] the things god's done for you up to this
[1:20:27] point in your life
[1:20:30] when you when you when you've got when
[1:20:32] you've gotten jobs when nobody else has
[1:20:35] gotten jobs

[1:22:10] and when you've got people walking past
[1:22:12] that door in and out all the time
[1:22:15] somebody would see an orange tag
[1:22:18] standing on top of a solid black
[1:22:19] barbecue grill
[1:22:22] but you know we no we nobody saw that
[1:22:24] but the next morning when we got there
[1:22:25] those van keys were sitting on top of
[1:22:28] that barbecue grill
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:35] it's like you know what because i have a
[1:22:37] heavenly father that is interested in

[1:23:32] and i went to the fellowship meeting
[1:23:33] that day and i was sitting there i was
[1:23:34] talking to brother ron
[1:23:36] i think the first time brother ron was

[1:23:55] sitting there eating i was telling
[1:23:56] brother ron about this job
[1:23:59] and i told him i said you

[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:35] but see the thing is we don't get don't
[1:26:37] get worried don't get worried up or
[1:26:39] worked up about it don't worry about it
[1:26:42] why because he's made a way for you
[1:26:46] just follow what god wants you to do
[1:26:49] just go the way that he wants you to go
[1:26:54] i just want to i just want to cover this
[1:26:56] one little part right here
[1:27:01] before we
[1:27:02] finish
[1:27:04] but this is first samuel chapter 15 and
[1:27:08] we know that as saul
[1:27:12] and saul became
[1:27:15] the
[1:27:16] king you know
[1:27:18] he left
[1:27:20] the way that he started
[1:27:22] he left that humility
[1:27:25] he got away
[1:27:28] because he wanted to be
[1:27:30] himself
[1:27:32] and he didn't want to follow
[1:27:34] and be a
[1:27:35] to be led of god
[1:27:39] you know
[1:27:40] and you know
[1:27:41] this the scripture tells us
[1:27:43] there
[1:27:44] you know the it says and then the the
[1:27:47] came the word of the lord unto samuel
[1:27:49] saying
[1:27:51] it repenteth me that i have set up saul
[1:27:54] to be king
[1:27:55] for he has turned back from following me
[1:27:57] and have not performed my commandments
[1:27:59] and it grieves samuel and he cried unto
[1:28:01] the lord all night
[1:28:03] and when samuel rose early to beat saul
[1:28:06] in the morning
[1:28:07] it was told samuel saying saul
[1:28:10] came to carmel
[1:28:12] and behold he set him up a place and has
[1:28:14] gone about and passed on and gone down
[1:28:16] to gilgal
[1:28:17] and samuel came to saul and saul said
[1:28:20] unto him blessed be thou of the lord i
[1:28:22] have performed the commandment of the
[1:28:25] lord
[1:28:26] and samuel said what meaneth then this
[1:28:29] bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and
[1:28:30] the lowing of the oxen which i heard
[1:28:34] and saul said they have brought them
[1:28:37] from the amalekites for the people
[1:28:40] spared the best of the sheep and of the
[1:28:42] oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god
[1:28:45] and the rest we have utterly destroyed
[1:28:49] then samuel said unto saul stay and i
[1:28:52] will tell thee what the lord hath said
[1:28:54] to me this night and he said unto him
[1:28:57] say on and samuel said when thou was
[1:29:00] little
[1:29:01] and thine on sight
[1:29:04] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:29:06] of israel and the lord anointed thee
[1:29:09] king over israel
[1:29:13] when he was little in his own sight
[1:29:17] when he was humble to what god had said
[1:29:19] and the lord sent thee on a journey
[1:29:22] and said go and utterly destroy the
[1:29:24] sinners the amalekites and fight against
[1:29:27] them until they be consumed
[1:29:31] therefore then this thou not obey the
[1:29:33] voice of the lord but did fly upon the
[1:29:36] spool and it's evil in the sight of the
[1:29:39] lord
[1:29:40] and samuel said unto saul yeah i have
[1:29:43] obeyed the voice of the lord and have
[1:29:45] gone the way which the lord sent me
[1:29:50] and have brought a gag the king of
[1:29:52] amalek and have utterly destroyed the
[1:29:54] malachites
[1:29:56] but the people took of the spool
[1:29:58] sheep and oxen
[1:29:59] the chief things which should have been
[1:30:02] utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the
[1:30:04] lord thy god and gilgal and samuel said
[1:30:08] hath the lord as great delight and burnt
[1:30:11] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[1:30:14] the voice of the lord behold to obey is
[1:30:16] better than sacrifice and to hearken
[1:30:18] than the fat of rams
[1:30:21] so when he begins to speak there then
[1:30:23] the lord had spoke to
[1:30:25] samuel and told him listen you need to
[1:30:28] go talk to saul
[1:30:30] and this is where saul is and you go and
[1:30:32] talk to him and you tell him
[1:30:36] but hearing all of this when the prophet
[1:30:38] stands before saul and tells him you've
[1:30:41] not obeyed the voice of the lord
[1:30:44] oh no i follow i've done what the lord
[1:30:45] wanted me to do
[1:30:48] well i followed it no you didn't
[1:30:52] and that's the reason i'm here saul
[1:30:55] the lord told me i'm gonna tell you what
[1:30:56] the lord told me last night
[1:31:01] don't don't argue with me
[1:31:03] saul
[1:31:05] because the lord told me this and the
[1:31:06] lord i'm not saying this this ain't
[1:31:08] coming from samuel
[1:31:10] this ain't coming from the pastor this
[1:31:13] ain't coming from some preacher
[1:31:16] but it's coming from god
[1:31:20] they listen you've not followed
[1:31:22] what you were told to do
[1:31:26] but listen we're gonna we're gonna take
[1:31:28] these great things that
[1:31:30] that that we have fallen upon that the
[1:31:32] lord has blessed us with these things
[1:31:34] and we're going to sacrifice them to the
[1:31:35] lord
[1:31:38] see
[1:31:39] well this is this is the way we want it
[1:31:41] to work out
[1:31:43] well the lord's blessed me with these
[1:31:45] things
[1:31:47] no you need to get rid of them
[1:31:50] people want to hold on to things and the
[1:31:52] devil and and the devil wants you to
[1:31:54] hold on to him that's what the devil is
[1:31:55] trying to tell you and the lord's trying
[1:31:56] to tell you you need to get rid of this
[1:31:57] stuff
[1:31:59] well
[1:32:00] you know it's going to work out great
[1:32:01] don't worry no
[1:32:04] god told him said listen all this stuff
[1:32:06] that's in your way these enemies
[1:32:09] don't leave nothing and utterly destroy
[1:32:12] it
[1:32:14] so when the things of the world are in
[1:32:16] the way and all these things they when
[1:32:18] all these things the old man and all
[1:32:20] these things that we fight you know
[1:32:22] we're not supposed to pet it
[1:32:24] it's to be utterly destroyed
[1:32:27] to flee from it
[1:32:30] right
[1:32:31] right
[1:32:35] he said
[1:32:37] hath the lord as great delight and burn
[1:32:39] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[1:32:41] the voice of the lord
[1:32:43] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:32:46] and to hearken the fat of rams
[1:32:50] so god didn't want all their sacrifices
[1:32:52] anyway god wanted somebody to be honest
[1:32:54] and follow the word amen
[1:32:57] is what he's told in the in the new
[1:32:59] testament you know he was not he was not
[1:33:01] in into sacrifices and offerings
[1:33:05] was not what he was wanting
[1:33:08] but he said a honest and contrite heart
[1:33:10] he wanted somebody to believe him
[1:33:12] somebody to follow the word
[1:33:16] not to offer a bunch of sacrifices
[1:33:20] he said for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:33:22] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:33:24] iniquity and idolatry because thou hast
[1:33:28] rejected the word of the lord he hath
[1:33:30] also rejected thee from being king
[1:33:32] and saul said unto samuel i have sinned
[1:33:35] for i have transgressed the commandment
[1:33:37] of the lord
[1:33:38] and thy words because i feared the
[1:33:40] people and obeyed their voice
[1:33:44] because you know what he listened to
[1:33:45] ever he listened to the people
[1:33:48] well
[1:33:49] well that okay we'll we'll just we'll
[1:33:51] just we'll just do it this way
[1:33:55] we you know one of the toughest jobs
[1:33:59] that you ever have
[1:34:01] is being a boss
[1:34:05] it's being a leader
[1:34:07] being a leader being in a leadership
[1:34:08] position
[1:34:11] because you know what some of the things
[1:34:12] that you have to do in life
[1:34:16] is not fun
[1:34:20] just like being a parent not everything
[1:34:22] about being a parent is always fun but
[1:34:23] you know what you're obligated to do it
[1:34:28] and everybody's like well
[1:34:30] we'll just let it slide this time
[1:34:34] well we'll just let it slide it'll be
[1:34:36] okay
[1:34:39] people people wonder why you know if you
[1:34:41] just pa pet the devil in your kids and
[1:34:43] you let them get by with everything and
[1:34:45] then you wonder why they turn out the
[1:34:46] way they do
[1:34:51] you know when when you when you have
[1:34:53] when you're in a a pastor when you when
[1:34:56] you're
[1:34:57] the shepherd of the flock
[1:35:01] you know i've never i've never seen i've
[1:35:04] never seen a church and i and i've i've
[1:35:06] said this
[1:35:08] times before
[1:35:10] but you you watch it you watch a church
[1:35:12] when when when they get when things
[1:35:15] happen
[1:35:17] and you may and you make a place for the
[1:35:19] devil
[1:35:22] why why is that why is it so important
[1:35:24] when sin come into camp
[1:35:28] because when when uh aiken committed his
[1:35:31] sin and joshua they stopped everything
[1:35:34] why because god told them listen they're
[1:35:35] sin in the camp
[1:35:38] there was a time listen now's the time
[1:35:39] we're going to stop all this
[1:35:42] and he started weeding it out
[1:35:45] until he figured out who the problem was
[1:35:49] so you know and you see churches when
[1:35:52] you allow things to take place
[1:35:55] and and things and nobody corrects these
[1:35:57] things then you know what all of a
[1:35:59] sudden then when when those things take
[1:36:01] place and somebody turns a blind eye and
[1:36:04] they don't listen to it and they don't
[1:36:05] correct it
[1:36:07] you start watching
[1:36:08] because the next thing you know the
[1:36:11] things that they start preaching out of
[1:36:12] the pulpit is an error
[1:36:17] why because when you allow the devil to
[1:36:19] come in when he gets his foot holding
[1:36:21] you watch and see if it don't start
[1:36:22] affecting the ministry
[1:36:26] i've never i've never seen it once where
[1:36:27] when they start getting in next thing
[1:36:29] you know it's going to affect everything
[1:36:32] why because you what what so it's so
[1:36:34] important
[1:36:37] it is it's such an important part to lay
[1:36:39] a hold of all that and and and people
[1:36:42] say well i don't understand why why why
[1:36:44] the preacher don't get a hold of don't
[1:36:46] do this or that well you know what
[1:36:50] you're not the pastor
[1:36:52] i'm not the pastor
[1:36:55] and you know what it takes it takes the
[1:36:56] holy ghost to work
[1:36:59] and you know there's people saying well
[1:37:00] you know what if it was me
[1:37:02] i would i would just kick them people oh
[1:37:05] yo you know i would just
[1:37:07] it's like you know what
[1:37:10] you wait on the lord
[1:37:13] and many times people people say well
[1:37:15] you know if i do i want to do it this
[1:37:16] way or whatever then you'd find out what
[1:37:18] if we'd have done it the way that you
[1:37:19] wanted it done it'd be an utter mess
[1:37:22] it'd be chaos
[1:37:24] but you know what he takes the pastor
[1:37:26] and he has to deal with some of those
[1:37:28] things
[1:37:30] and you know he has to bear those
[1:37:31] burdens and but you know what there's a
[1:37:33] time when when if you keep holding it
[1:37:35] before the lord then you know what then
[1:37:36] all of a sudden then it'll take place
[1:37:40] there's something that the lord will
[1:37:41] speak and something will take place and
[1:37:43] then the word will come forth and it'll
[1:37:45] address that a situation
[1:37:49] but sometimes you know if we try to if
[1:37:51] we try to do it in our own selves
[1:37:54] then the problem is is you know
[1:37:57] we make a mess out of it
[1:38:00] and everybody's like well i don't
[1:38:01] understand why they don't do this why
[1:38:02] they don't under why they don't do that
[1:38:05] well how do you know that the lord ain't
[1:38:06] spoke to
[1:38:07] brother dale or brother wade or
[1:38:10] whoever about those situations
[1:38:13] people act like you know well if he you
[1:38:15] know just like when jesus was there and
[1:38:16] now that prostitute was down there
[1:38:18] washing his feet
[1:38:20] well if he knew what kind of woman that
[1:38:22] was he wouldn't let her wash his feet
[1:38:26] but you know what here's this ill-famed
[1:38:28] woman but she had more respect for the
[1:38:29] son of god than all those pharisees and
[1:38:32] all those religious leaders who thought
[1:38:34] they were so holy and pious and so great
[1:38:36] and this woman who knew who she was but
[1:38:38] she knew who he was and that she would
[1:38:40] honor him by taking and washing the feet
[1:38:44] washing his feet with her tears and
[1:38:46] drawing them with her hair why because
[1:38:47] they wouldn't do that
[1:38:50] one they had put him in a place to
[1:38:52] really kill and mock him
[1:38:55] but she saw who he was
[1:38:57] she didn't take into consideration who
[1:38:59] she was
[1:39:02] yeah she knew who she was but you know
[1:39:04] what she she saw the dishonor that was
[1:39:07] done to him
[1:39:09] and it was something that was inside of
[1:39:11] her to do that
[1:39:20] and it's all said unto samuel i have
[1:39:22] sinned
[1:39:25] for i have transgressed the commandment
[1:39:26] of the lord and thy words because i
[1:39:28] feared the people and obeyed their voice
[1:39:30] and therefore i pray thee pardon my sin
[1:39:32] and turn again with me that i may
[1:39:35] worship the lord and samuel said unto
[1:39:37] saul i will not return with thee for
[1:39:40] thou hast rejected the word of the lord
[1:39:43] and the lord hath rejected thee from
[1:39:45] being king over israel
[1:39:46] and as samuel turned about to go away he
[1:39:48] laid upon the skirt of his mantle and it
[1:39:50] rent and samuel said unto him the lord
[1:39:53] hath rent the kingdom of israel from
[1:39:55] thee this day and hath given it to a
[1:39:57] neighbor of thine that is better than
[1:39:59] thou
[1:40:00] and also the strength of israel will not
[1:40:02] lie nor repent for he is not a man that
[1:40:05] he should repent
[1:40:07] then he said i have sinned yet honor me
[1:40:09] now i pray thee before the elders of my
[1:40:11] people and before israel and turn again
[1:40:13] with me that i may worship the lord thy
[1:40:15] god so samuel turned again after saul
[1:40:18] and saul worshiped the lord
[1:40:20] then said samuel bring me hither to me
[1:40:23] again the king of the malachites and i
[1:40:25] got a guy
[1:40:26] came unto him delicately and again said
[1:40:29] surely the bitterness of death is passed
[1:40:31] and samuel said as thy sword hath made
[1:40:34] women childless
[1:40:35] so shall thy mother be childless among
[1:40:37] women
[1:40:38] and samuel cute again pieces before the
[1:40:40] lord and gilgal
[1:40:42] then samuel went to rama and saul went
[1:40:45] to his house and gibba of saul
[1:40:48] and samuel came no more to see samuel
[1:40:50] until the day of his death nevertheless
[1:40:52] samuel mourned for saul and the lord
[1:40:54] repented that he had made saul king over
[1:40:57] israel
[1:41:02] so and sisters it's a
[1:41:06] it's a serious thing
[1:41:08] to follow in the way that god has called
[1:41:10] us
[1:41:12] god's made us made a way
[1:41:15] but you know
[1:41:18] god's not
[1:41:20] god's not always going to be

[1:41:37] the place and if and if you've sinned
[1:41:40] then you know what god is calling you
[1:41:43] god will speak to you and you know what
[1:41:45] god is calling you back into fellowship

[1:42:19] stay humble before the lord
[1:42:24] that we all that if we are
[1:42:27] a child of god you know then the holy
