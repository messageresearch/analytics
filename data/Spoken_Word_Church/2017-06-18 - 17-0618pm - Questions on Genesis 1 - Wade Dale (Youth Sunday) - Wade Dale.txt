this here's a life besides with her and she's three that's right you're right there with me amen it was a sister sister Holloway out in just a Holloway out in Arizona she was her husband was just he was I sitting behind the pulpit right here and he was so nervous his hands just shaking and he said I don't know which one is more nervous me or my wife and I thought man if your wife's that nervous she's in trouble so I told her afterwards I said you did a good job today she looked at me and she said my husband priest I said no I said you had to be doing the preaching because he was nervous and he said you were nervous I said y'all were a good team y'all work good together so that's behind every good man is a good one hey ma'am didn't the property God say if he caught he called the man he called his wife - right ma'am so gales been doing a good job song leading for over here amen they're good support but good to be in the house the Lord good to have our visitors with us from brother Wallace Church there in Virginia believe it is and good to have them with us and they're one of us so we don't have to hide anything kaitlin's with us today so everything's got good I finally remembered your name sterling bringing this girlfriend of Turks that's good so good to be in the house the Lord now what we're going to do today is is I told you a couple of weeks ago before we went to New Mexico that we would answer some questions so there's a couple of questions that I got and we're just going to go back through and cover this Genesis 1:26 man one of the questions was explain what the Genesis 1:26 man is exactly what it is with not all the other stuff around around it and number two was this one was Rhines in Genesis 1:26 men could not fall so when Adam fell what part or parts of the Genesis 1:26 man left Adam so we're going to try today to explain that maybe draw it on the board and I want to tell you something before we get started you can't draw these things I'm going to read your quote we're brother Ramsay you've got to you've got to see this with a supernatural eye so we can draw all we want to and you can't explain God with it and then because how can you draw eternity how can you draw something that was nothing and then it became something yet it always was something you can't do that but I'm going to try and like I said involving him coming down the road yesterday i daddy slapped I couldn't sleep so I got up Friday night I went and setting my car and her my truck and and did some studying out the only thing you can get in that place where we were at was if you what's on your phone so I had the tablet or the word on my phone so I was looking up the often in things like that so I got a little thought that we will try to continue I know that most of you here know that the Genesis 1:26 men is a favorite subject of mine but we're going to try to by the Lord's help I want to where it will be plain and easy for you to understand that's our job that's our job our jobs not for us to figure out how it is it's to give it to you and present it to you and let God speak to you and through that filter of the Holy Ghost you get it for yourself and that's what we was talking about this morning like brother Dale those seven sons of sceva they said we're jury in the name the poll priests and the demon said we know Paul we know Jesus but we all know you are so we're going to we're going to try to to not preach this than a what Paul preached we're going to try to bring it to you in the love of the Lord and some quotes in Scripture so if you would pull up Genesis 1:26 and if I do draw something that you don't see or understand or just hold your hand up because today we're just going to answer questions we're just going to have a sunday-school class and if you got a you got a question just raise your hand up and we'll stop and try to answer it so if we don't get finished with it maybe we'll finish it next Sunday I got a call in to brother Tim Humes he wants me to preach for him that Sunday but he hasn't called me back yet so we'll let you know though probably before Wednesday night but let's bow our heads before we get started just pray for us that we will bring it so simple to you can understand it Amen let's bow our heads there Heavenly Father we pray today Lord this truly we need you to be the active participant the one Lord that moves our thoughts and ideas out of the way and you come and be the one that draws and the one that gives a revelation be the here be the speaker you take total control Lord because we pray that something will be said today that will help each one property God said it was good to have questions but I believe it's good to have questions an answer amen answers to the questions that the people have they're good questions they're questions that are all in our hearts and minds we pray to door today Lord that you will settle that for each one of us forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are not here the ones that are sick bless our visitors that are among us Lord we they're not visitors they're just family members coming to see a a new part of the family of God and father we pray that you'd be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor let's each one bless brother dick and sister Gail Lord is a 62 years of life together father they're they're just a wonderful couple a great example of Christian experience changing somebody's life father we pray that should be with us take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen and happy Father's Day to all you fathers and hey happy Father's Day to all you mothers because without your mothers we wouldn't be fathers and without you fathers we wouldn't be mothers so we got to do this all together so anyway amen and God said let us make man this is Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in our image after our likeness so it's not a you're going to hear brother Branham he's going to bring out in illustration purposes only halo of light sacred light remember if we were made in the image of God we were not sacred lights and we were not halos we were human people all right after I likeness and let them plural have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them I like that because he blessed them before they even put them in flesh brother a bless them for even put it on the earth so we're blessed people a man and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it in other words have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated in the war that is blessing to the reading of the word and we're just going to like say we're going to try to take our time but what I want to we didn't bring out some of these words the last time I want to make this where we can Donny can you see all that board daddy you can't sell it okay this board can you see it okay can everybody see that board this is a board okay can everybody see the board can everybody see the board and we'll get it in a minute all right so let's get let's let's get a few of these words don't go to sleep yet okay thank you and the Greek lexicon we look up the there's going to be two words we're going to bring in today and I'm going to let the prophet of God tell us from the quotes and then from the quotes I'm going to attempt to because they always say that you know what is it listening you get so much a percent reading you get so much a percent reading and listening you get a better percentage but visual you get a much better percent of of understanding so today we want to look at it was kind of funny brother um Holloway was preaching on justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost brother temperature and he said he said I wished I was a teacher like so-and-so that was in their church and and he said the brothers said well now brothers is some people teach college and some people teach elementary school some people teach kindergarten so you can have teachers that teach at these different levels so I want to be I want to be where we can see what God's already given this is this is not something new all right but I want to explain it for those that has a question about it all right so now the Greek lexicon brings the word logos in which low gods means word saying an account speech are the word or Christ everybody got that same am all right so we got one word here we got what we got two words actually but I'm gonna list them right here you got low gaan and you got Christ yes I'm left-handed and yes this is how I write so so that works out good I can step over here all right so we got low gosh we've got Christ now I want to go to number one and let's read three four quote the deity of Jesus Christ 1949 this is 1949 alright so we're going to bring this word in like someone was speaking the other day God what was he when he was back yonder millions and millions of years ago when he was no just like this space here now what we're going to do is today this is God no boundaries this whole white part of this board is God is that okay that's eternity there's no that's what I said you can't draw this but for but for illustration purposes this whole white is just like what brother Dale will talk about this morning every attribute of God I can't lift them all I Omega all the way all the way through this is all God something we can't understand because we're finite people how can you understand a God that ten billion maybe maybe maybe billion years ago he hadn't aged a day when he said this right here in Genesis 1:26 to this stay standing here God is not one second older we can't fathom that because we're finite people we all are in time and time continues on and we said well God's got to get older I was telling you a long time ago you know the denominational world they all think God is some grey-headed stoop-shouldered who's one of the eternal God that look like that I don't want an old God I believe God is eighteen to twenty years old I believe he's in the prime of his life amen Melchizedek didn't meet Abraham and tell him he's going to get a body change and have to walk up to Abraham like this no he was a young man that's why Abraham could even look at him and say Lord God you're young you're just a child Abraham was 99 close to citrulline Aziz I said close but she's she's closer to being young than we are a man yeah I think eyes that way that was just space that was your space all right and then he gathered up into the logos and then he came from the logos down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the earth then going right back into God again that alright say Amen all right don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together now listen let me tell you something I've always told you this before for the sake of the visitors this is not for God understanding right God had never had a different thought he's never had a new thought all this is for us and if there was any better way for God to explain it he would have already give it to us so this is the way God wants to be explained on this side of eternity and then because that's what he said right hey watch coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the low goes the low GOx down into the man then returning right back again for one purpose to redeem that man that had fallen right all right to redeem the man that had fallen I go to 46 let's go back up to here and God in the beginning made his first man he made him out of spirit and the Spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see now God made man in his own image are you listening to me congregation says why a man that was weak your favorite team just scored a touchdown ok now what hey man one day we'll get all this together alright God made man in his own image the god of the Spirit says the Bible the first man that was made had the government overall the creation that's what we were just talking about in Genesis 1:26 and the first man was made had the government overall the creation just like the Holy Spirit has government over the church today alright he led the creation he led the animals so now we got another one here we got and I I'm not afraid to go so I'm gonna say holy go okay a lot of people in the denominational world they're full of ghosts they call the Holy Spirit but I say go I like the Holy Ghost amen amen thank you better but there was no man he he led the animals but there was no man to till the soil so god made man out of the dust of the earth now this is the flesh part of man that you see alright and that man he might have give him a hand like a monkey a mighty give him a foot like feet like a bear whatever he did he just throwed it together and made a man but this man he put this immortal spirit that never dies into this man alright and he became more than a brute he became a man that all right say man I like that quote there number two the red of Lazarus 1951 brother Brown said and then after he got all this creation made he said let us plural make man in our image in our plural own image now if God is unseen if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking so now it's a drama okay so I said you can't draw this and make it look right right but in the form of a halo then it's supernatural then he had to make a man in his own image John Force's that God is a spirit and he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now there's deity cannot be seen deity is the supernatural then he brings it down from a sacred halo to a little white cloud something that's more visible that's man now man is not a white cloud not all right this is for illustration purposes only we were made in the image of God Glide never was a cloud but for illustration purposes what got what brother branham showing us if I may remember brother Branham saw that what that halo of light right remember the halo that was over his head he said what that's you angel the Covenant that's Christ right amen that wasn't just some different angel that was Christ amen and then the pillar of fire the burning bush run the burning bush if Moses would have had a true revelation like Paul did Paul saw a light but he saw Jesus Amen because of the revelation he had Moses in Revelation was not at the moment that God was a human man at that moment you understand me so God sends a pillar of fire - what - hide himself but God Himself Jesus Christ was standing in that pillar of fire in that burning bush but Moses is revelation had not progressed to that point yet because remember it will because finally Moses is going to say God I want to see who you really are right and what did he show him he showed in that theophany he showed him the back part of a human mortal man that was coming now that he wasn't mortal at that time but he was coming to be mortal he was coming to be Jesus Christ right all right so out of this halo of light step two one I'm sorry banane I'm not an artist but look but out of that halo out of that revelation that God is this big board ten billion miles that way and ten billion miles that way and don't even cover his fingernail all right but for illustration purposes how many times am I gonna say that illustration purposes this is God eternal that you can't see don't know no man has seen the father but something has declared him there is something that is making him manifest and what is it it's just low Gauss that comes out he comes out of this halo but remember he always loves back near the same person he is right here that all right but for me and you now prophet is trying to explain it to us so we have to go by brother Branham I believe he saw this by supernatural life he had to see it first and then we see it because he gets what the prophet catches a revelation from God then what he delivers it to the people amen so he delivers it to the people that's why we needed a prophet in the end time no one know Billy Graham as great as he was no Laurel Roberts as great as he was no hey Allen and all the great ones of the ones that were back in the 50s and 40s and even Smith Wigglesworth people that had a wonderful revelation of God they weren't a prophet so God couldn't speak to them the way he spoke to that prophet William Branham that conduit that comes straight from God right to brother Branham no one in between there's no other prophet there's no other somebody can stand here and go you were wrong God you only one that can correct the Prophet and then so a prophet gets it straight from God but what's his job his job is then to what put it out to the people through apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to bring that and break it down to the people okay he just he give us the big I guess and then we take and break them into little nuggets so the logos is what what we say the logos was it was the speech our let me draw this a little different right here this is what I like I don't looking see it in the back was that side that's the word I'm going to read it right here brother mom says that was the word the logos was the word because what is the word the word has to be spoken the word can lay on the pages for an eternity but once it's in somebody and they're able to speak it because this man is going to start creating that all right this man is going to start creating so he's got to what speak all right so listen let's just keep going right here he brought it down now there's dead he cannot be seen deity just supernatural then he brings it down from a sacred halo to a little white cloud something that's more visible that's man he give him the rulership over the kingdom all right so now he governs the Beast just like the Holy Spirit leads the church today let's keep and there's where science gets mixed up let's finish he might give him a face like a chimpanzee you might give him a foot like a bear but God put a soul in a man I was telling you this morning I heard a minister the other day which did a real good job and he said the love of God the true love of God was giving you a choice think about that you think of that so profound you think the love of God will be I'm going to save everybody and I don't care what you think and you're just going to do this all your life I'm a child of God I'm a child of God move I'm a child of God move what love is that what love is in that no that's not love that's more of a demanding no but what greater love for God to say I'm going to put you on the earth and you got a choice love me or hate me to me that's the greatest letter there was is that he gave us a choice what and the only reason we have a choice the animals don't have a choice because they don't have a soul man has a soul to make a choice between right and wrong and then so that soul of God you see where I'm going so that soul of God comes out and what he begins to speak all right now watch and there's where science gets all mixed up what was I know if they're tough we're good God put a soul in a man this white cloud deity came down not in the animal in the man and now if you want to go back and dig up some old bones let them dig as many thing one two all the fossils that doesn't have a thing to do on the burying of the word of God there is there's no Bigfoot we had an experience this weekend we'll tell you about it later maybe or this week didn't know that Bigfoot was in Georgia I didn't know we had a Georgia Bigfoot but daddy told them where it was at then the second accession snake but here's this man and now man sinned now watch how they said this is what I've been looking for for awhile and when he sinned and fell then that little cloud in there became marred in blackness Iran he didn't take the cloud out here there's no way once God gave Adam eternal life there's no way God could take it back now I like what one brother said he God cannot God cannot break your relationship but he can break those Adam did not lose his relationship the Bible says in the Book of Luke that Adam was a son of God he did not become a son of God when he failed no he didn't lose his relationship he lost his fellowship hey man that's the same way with you and I we lost fellowship we lost the closeness of God come down and brought us back into that what fellowship but look that little cloud in there became marred and black then the logos came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the Father and he came in by what the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm going to get to this a little bit later and chase sin out of the human amen chase sin out of the human and brings men back again again in fellowship with God you believe that a man but he became marred and black what there was something that was without the Adam had total control over everything total control amen but once he sinned there was a mark or a Mar that was that was covering that and like I said before you you know we were born in sin shaping an iniquity sponsored my mother's womb the liar what the Bible says right but there was a representation in heaven that covered us a man and God came down remember brother I'm saying Jesus didn't come to bring you what he had come to bring you that he come to make a way to get back to that and then good Jesus didn't bring you in inheritance no brother Brown said no no is an adoption series he said no no Jesus didn't come to bring you inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world a man preserved in him I like that word preserved remember if you preserve a pickle get I mean a cucumber remember it turns into a pickle right but the pickle can never go back to being a cucumber yet it looks like one yet it looks you're like one but it can go back it's been what it's been preserved all right same way with you and I you believe that say ma'am number three number three cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid sin from our lives jeffersonville everybody all right say man so he couldn't just leave it in that state he had to leave something with it in other words he's talking about the animal so he said let us plural make man plural in our image let us make man in our image so when then when God made his first man alright watch this when God made his first man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man now remember what was glow God slow gotcha is a word its speech for those of you can't see that it says let there be right that's your Creator the word created everything that's why the Bible says Jesus Christ not Jesus the flash Jesus Christ was the creator god he was the one that created the word was before the foundation of the world if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world then the book was already written and then in the mind of God but what to develop this picture so that you and I can understand God so we can understand God this eternal thing that we can't understand because he doesn't know he just can't be understood but thank God he's brought us a part that we can't understand that we can see by the eye of faith that he steps out of this this great all the attributes like brother they was talking this morning all those attributes all those titles he comes down and you can bring it down to one word and it's word you can bring it down to word word it's where you begin and word is there's no end but word is where the logos comes out and he's right here now remember this is still your Genesis one sustainer good money this is still that Genesis 1:26 man she's back there somewhere this Genesis 1:26 man is the Word of God it's the logos its Christ it's the Holy Ghost we're going to put a few more in there just a minute which is the titles memory has one name see this is kind of connecting in what brother Dale he's got one name but now it's name what in Jesus right here but now in the mind of God it was in the mind of God he never developed the name Jesus four thousand years after this only all watched Jesus he always what Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ what the same yesterday today and forever amen general writes Amen let us make man in our image so then when God made his first man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man now remember let me finish reading this and let me come in then he gave the men jurisdiction over to lead all animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads to believer today now look watch what he says right here I didn't read it but I should have now if we were perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit now God would lead us by the Holy Spirit just like Adam led the animals up that day that's what we're going back to and in the property God we saw it when here we've seen it we're nature it's what controlled by what a man says a man right here nature was controlled by what man says amen number four we've read this for many many times questions and answers on Genesis now God created man in his own image in his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice now I want you to notice right here I haven't made another person there's only one person in this Godhead okay I haven't made another person but we don't have to bring him out and show how he condescends down to not another person but himself in another form so I'm going to leave that one man standing right there hey man oh okay amen because we're not going to do away with it we're not going to do away with this blackboard I mean just whiteboard collapse the Eternal Father God that's one you can't see you can't understand now we're going to try to develop them to where we can see them and understand it that Alright now God created man is own image no like this what kind of man is he created spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now is the one that asks the question will find this that God gave the million of the cattle and fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beasts of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads to believer today so Adam in other words Adam the first man in the Lord creation of God I'm not going to draw another man I'm not going to draw another man because when a for Adam wasn't dead now we got to put a flesh man in here now we got to do that because the Adam went into the offering he went into a flesh man right but we're not going to it right now because Adam had no limitation does the Holy Spirit have limitation because the Holy Spirit can be speaking to me today it can be speaking to somebody in Africans at the same time he's in another dimension and it's way faster than this one and I am so thankful you know brother Chris long is right memory preached here and he's going to do our wax night service he has been studying on dimension so me and him we had we were beating the tables we thought we got mad at each other but we wasn't we were just shouting at the things that he saw in the things I saw we kind of put them together you know some so God is in a faster dimension we're in the slowest dimension of all 1 2 & 3 we think we'd travel fast forget it this is the slowest God will ever get when he walks in this dimension I believe when Melchizedek came down he said man this is slow whoo but he's so fast he can talk to me and he can talk to you and he can talk to somebody in Africa in the same instant why he has no time he has no tribal limitations we have a life light and matter limitation and man even though how fast we want to go and like Einstein like brother Dale said well it's already been proven because look radio waves are coming through this building right now without a hole being made sorry folks but are travelling through this through this place right to the wall going right out that wall going up here with no limitation why they're in a faster dimension hey man so maybe we need to start thinking more in a faster dimension hey man that alright say man because when Jesus I believe when he came back he was in that seventh dimension he had a glorified body he had a he had a body that was as solid as this wood and he just steps to the wall now how fast is that we think well something that's the spirit can just flow right through the wall what about a man that stepped through the wall and walks in and says give me a piece of fish and he puts it in his mouth and they don't hit the floor it goes somewhere there's some substance after he walks through there why he was in another dimension hey man we'll get into that not today but it didn't help how that God you know puts people together he was in other words Adam the first man in the Lord creations of God the first creation was God Himself was random God Himself a creation anything is created has to have an end brother no no we just did it right here we just did it right here that's the beginning of the creation of God that's the part of God that we have to understand in this dimension that God is now showing himself ascend remember the word creation God created man in his own image listen if we were created in at the beginning then we got to have an end so that word creation is not exactly like we're talking about that creation word that we're looking at it's just like a car a car was created but what's in the car rubber from the ground or iron or from the ground hello plastic from the ground everything what brother Brown said what TV cars written or in the Garden of Eden wife substance that it was made from will hey the substance that we were made from hello somebody the substance that we were made from always was here and then it just developed so that we could see because the words eternal the Bible wasn't written thousand years ago the Bible was before there ever was the Bible was Word was with God and the Word was God and then the Word was made flesh so that word was already in place before anything so the word is eternal hey man it just developed so we can understand God a little bit faster amen why do you think we're going to have a message of cheer Lord we can't understand this what about what about when we get into an unlimited unlimited dimension to where it's not going to bother us for time and we get to sitting around talking about God Wow the first creation was God Himself then out of God came to logano we're looking here the logos is what the speech right there by all right which was the son of God then out of the logos watch out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word wherewith garden word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we know where it went out of the logos came forth the man now we got to bring another word in here because that's the body the word theophany we'll look at it DeMint Theo is always God vanian is actually the Latin word and it means to show so to show God is that theophany amen so what we're doing we're taking something that you can't see and you can't understand and we're showing God to who me and you we're showing God we're bringing now the word is in body form that alright you don't believe it I'm gonna read it because right here brother Graham said so not my reasoning a lot of the logos came forth the man let's-- treating this read number five questions and answers still in Genesis next one there you go and no one has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see roll it up to the top this is where I caught my eyes of supernatural looking so now we got two supernaturally look at all this mess that I've made here on the board all right we see a little white light forming out there one is it that was called by Bible readers the logos are what they were anointed which is Christ a lot of titles to this person huh the anointed are the anointing or the as I was going to say the part of God begins to develop into something so he can see who he was know something so humans so his children in other words his children can see where we come from what we're doing here where we're going and then something so human beings could have some type of an idea now he didn't say we know all of God he said we just have some little idea of who God is it was a little a little light moving that was the work dot number six the great mighty conquer in 1957 now if you'll if you'll understand where I'm going in 1957 brother Ram doesn't used to work the until 1957 so some part of his revelation had come to a spot to where he he understood more all a prophet yeah a prophet the Bible said Jesus learned by the things he suffered and was made perfect and then so brother Branham had progressive his revelation progressed he went 1957 he starts talking about a theophany but right here let's see in 1957 in 421 then we'll continue on then he came he came down because he was in the beginning the Bible said he was to work he was the logos that went out of God and the logos in the beginning was the word so we're establishing now that this is the word of God the logos is the Word of God if some big words if they use logos is really not a big word it's only four letters pablor but it's a big word if you don't have revelation but in the speech part it's just a word to go it's the Word of God if when God steps out and begins to speak let there be that's the Creator God he had to have a speech remember brother Branham said Moses he had a thought then when he spoke it it was that thought expressed that's the same thing what God God had these thoughts and playing in his mind before there ever was anything but it didn't come to fruition until he was spoken amen there's the beginning of the creation of God that's when God was created was when he comes in speech we know it was created in the womb of a woman we know that but the God that we know don't have a beginning but there is a time of creation or a forming where we can see him now remember not for his sake Crower all right and lifts and brothers and sisters if there was a different way to bring it he would have made it but when he brought it through brother Branham he brought it through the Prophet to show us who God was and to show us remember the property God said when the seals break it what it shows you what where you come from what you're doing here and where you're going and Mansell if you're showing us where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going that all right say Amen the logos in the beginning was the word now number seven thirsting for life the logos that went out of God is no disregard to calculate people and I wanted one is kind of just paraphrase this for you talking about the Father Son and Holy Ghost brother Brown was telling them that a son had a beginning now you can get real messed up with that because remember this is the son of God he just said that this is the son of God but not the Son of God second person of the Trinity okay that all right that's not eternal sonship eternal sonship would be that that son that they're talking about no no this son of God is eternal a man but right here brother Brown says ah now wait a man had a beginning or has no end son means how the beginning so that ain't the same son he's talking about that all right it could be an eternal god ship but never an eternal sonship a son is one that lets be got enough so it had a beginning art goes o'clock and tool oh gosh which was the son of God went out created by these great fountains of purity excuse me God is those spirits went out and it created the low God listen it formed remember it didn't create this was not a created being this always was or it did have a beginning but to develop into what we want to see to what you and I want to see this Genesis 1:26 minutes it had to come in a form that week that we could that me and you can look at each other and we can see God Amen alright and it was a body it was in the form of what we are now which is called in the clergy way of speaking at the oppening now the theophany is what I just told you it was see often in the Oh means God and banan means to show show it's to show God the way to show God is through the theophany okay and not that gods over here and he's got a theophany God isn't the offer man God is not part of the word God is the word in the beginning with the word we're because that's why Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bottle he was all these things and then that all right now where was I oh here we go 813 lets going down to here it's a body that doesn't let's read this for him it was a body that does it easy it was a bunny that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a body that's waiting for you Christians as soon as the life leaves this you go into that body and when this earthly time and I could be dissolved we have an already waiting a theophany know we'll touch on that in just a minute now raise it up now when God was in theophany which was Christ in the making we got he still we got our words here all right we got theophany over here we got the logo same person Christ same person Holy Ghost same person that all right but now remember Adam wasn't the fullness of the Godhead bodily he was part of it but he wasn't the person of God if he was he could have saved even saved the human race but he could not right he could not save the human race in other words he couldn't give his life and it go back into a believer and make them right God Almighty on the one who can do that but we'll get to that myth when God was in theophany which was Christ in the making then that theophany became flesh and dwelt among us that was to redeem he came from there down through this to redeem this creature give it life and take it back up into the turtle one amen jesus said I come from God and I go back to God he was the creator right he came down in this dimension for one purpose and that was to redeem that had failed that that had failed all right that all right say man alright now let's read this now right here now when these great lights went out or great rays of spirit love peace that's all there was there wasn't no suffering there wasn't no hate no malice it couldn't come from this fountain that was Jehovah that was your hope of God now hold on a minute we can put Jehovah God in this hey man that was Jehovah God and now as the theologians call it a theophany went from that which was called in the scriptural tool Oh God so the logos is the speech that he often is the body that Alright that the often is the body the logos is the speech so he says right here and now that the oldest call that theophany went from that which was called in the scriptural the logos the logos that went out of God it's hard to explain but it was a part of God I'm just telling you what prophet said it's hard to explain but I believe with the Holy Ghost you can understand so now let's go to the next let's go to where I was just telling you the word origin and history of theophany the operating come from a Latin word field fornia from Greek Stephanie from cos God and finanza show so that's that's what we said to show God is the theophany body all right if I got that same man all right to show God let's get some of this I hate erasing God but we're going to erase a little bit of it because we get to get the the essence of what we're doing is everybody all right this Genesis 1:26 man is not just some something that we we talk about and I guess I've done it too we just kind of throw it to the side and said well everybody ought to understand what that is but but maybe by some of these questions that that we have is that we see that that truly that that this Genesis 1:26 man was the part of God we know that a man the characteristic of God this Genesis 1:26 man's the Word of God amen it's in the Word of God and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and found their that's what we're heading toward in eternity amen if they would have stayed in that state it would have been any Turnitin there would never been a fall but we know that's not going to happen because inside this word is a healer inside this word is a savior inside this word is the Redeemer the Rose of Sharon lily of the valley we can call him lily of the valley planta been lost those are redemptive nays all those names are names it that let's just put it this way God we know look down through time by foreknowledge he saw all this happen I do not believe that God put us through a tube and shot us through and that's the way we're supposed to be I just told you that God give us a choice amen but being what being this eternal God that knows the end from the beginning look down through time and for knew by foreknowledge he knew what the end would be knew what choice look he knew Adam would make this choice not this one he knew one hour would make this choice he comes down here and he knows what choice you would make so he could predestined predestination if the destiny determined beforehand why can he do it before him because of foreknowledge I like that word because of foreknowledge not that God made us do this he did not make Adam fall but he knew if he put that 1:26 man which was purity the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost can fall but when you put that man into a human flesh and the mole if all this is all white right we fell but Adam didn't follow him so he couldn't there's no way he could I just told you in the quote brother Ram said he put that immortal being inside of that man that's enough for me that's enough for me whatever you want believe your your business but in Seoul Adam was the Sun bright the Bible calls Adam son of God I don't have to get to find a quote I'll get who's read the Bible and lose and listen he was the only Son of God in the Old Testament that all right we're going to get to that in just a second cuz we're going to draw that a little bit further but I want you to see this where was I number eight let's go to number eight I want to read a few of these we will stop we will see Jesus 1957 like I said 1957 brother Evan start talking about logo I mean talks about theophany he brings the off in the end talks about logos in 1949 but he comes up and sees that that logos being the speech that there was a body there God's got a body God's not got a body God hears the body ma'am Thank You Jeanne I need it so when she smiled I knew that's what I should have said start with thank you and the low guys that went out of God in the beginning became become what we would call a theophany are a supernatural body God is not like the air y'all heard that somewhere before this morning a couple hours ago but he's in a body Moses seen in past and said it looked like the back part of a man and so forth and when that same theophany was made flesh that same theophany and dwelt among us and we beheld him the only begotten of the Father Christ amen that all right that was him that was demand alright let's go to what number was that eight let's go to nine and then we'll stop right here real quick number nine hebrews chapter one now if you want to if you want to really read about the oppening in the hebrew series brother groundcovers theophany more in that one group of sermons then he covers the whole time he bring he in this Hebrew series now here's what happened oh excuse me I just get on this this just gets me right where I love it me too the logos in this great fountain this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of God we've already told you that right right it was the only visible form that the Spirit had so he must be bringing something visible that we can see and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man just like what we're talking about right here all right now the only problem we have with this in drawing is that that one Fiat any man covers all of Christendom and I can't draw that because you can have you know you can you can have 10 billion little little born-again believers but it comes from at one body and it is that one body so you can't really draw that you can't you can't draw a multiple of God you just can't because brother Ram say the oneness with God he said he said true oneness is God and Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden well now if you and I look at that and walk up to that situation we're going to see three people but in God's eyes true oneness was God able to walk right up to Adam and Eve and feel the oneness and nothing between no fear just like what we're going back to you think we're going to go to the you think we're going to go to the Millennium and when jesus walks up we're gonna go no no no no no you're going to want to never leave exciting you're going to want to never leave that man hey man so let's don't be scared that's the first thing item said Adam said I was afraid he'd never said that before he'd never been fear that feared that God would walk why something had changed something had changed he knew he had done something wrong and then I look Moses saw it when it passed by the rock looked at it it looked like a hind part of a man it's the same type of body that we received when we got here it deserves time and I could be dissolved we have one already waiting that was it that was the theophany which was the son of God that son that logos became flesh so all this right here that's why like I said he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily Father Son and Holy Ghost the word the logos the speaks the Holy Ghost anointing the Creator all was in Jesus Christ amen that's why he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily it's a certain time when I could be dissolved we have one already waiting that was it and that was the theophany which was the son of God that son that logos became flesh because we were put in flesh the only reason Jesus came in flash is because we were put in place pretty simple amen and the theophany the logos became flesh here among us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place for that entire fountain dwelt in him all right let's go to number 10 and now the low guys that went out of God nothing finished still in Hebrew series that was the logos all this began to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholars teaching low God the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it now he see his devout he sees something developing in other words a better word for it was what we call a theophany now watch this real close watch this wake up jocks turn this one oh I'm just couldn't don't do this don't do that I'm not that mean not yet the operon is a human body that's glorified now hold on a minute yeah you got a hold on we gotta watch this write it but look he corrects it not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in its glorified stage got it the option is a human body that's glorified now I agree there's not a the glorification of the body is de flesh why do you need a theophany glorified it is the glorification and then the theophany this listen this never fell this this theophany is the reason we can go back to the eternal so there's no way it can fall that Genesis 1:26 man cannot fall it is the Word of God but I'm just telling you what brother M said remember I told you you got to read through your filter not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in his glorified stage but it is of a form of human body now watch him correctly because remember when he went across the curtain of time this is three years before he went across the curtain of time he always thought here that you could pass through each other there was nothing solid right brother Neville how you doing you a cloud that was the old lifestyle we always had him grandma always told us if we're going to go up on heaven go to heaven set on the cloud and play a heart and we're going to just float buying gold hey brother did my that's not fellowship that's not God but when he was going across the curtain time what'd he say he said those people were real they had what they had something solid remember he hugged women and he must have been able to hug them to know that they were so there was solid right but it is over a form of a human body that doesn't eat remember they told brother Branham when he went across the curtain time they said we don't eat here right hey listen they're human they're in the sixth dimension those are human beings those are not angels they're human people that what it's desiring to come back and get their human body hello get their human body so they can eat because we ate when we were here brother Brown said death only changes your dwelling place I like mountains and a mountain stream and I'm not going to change when I get over there I'll go visit Lisa on her little island that's okay with the ocean all the way around it but I'm going to go back up to the mountain cuz that's what I like a man that all right listen I'm gonna tell you something he built this because you he built all this desire you have he built that city didn't the Prophet tell us in the future only built that city because of what you like right I'm telling you people we're not going to walk down the streets of gold and there'd be a little block and there's a house and the same little block that's all the thing I didn't like about New Mexico Rachel where's Rachel they have an ordinance every house has lutes ain't it looks just like they stamped them they all had to be basically the same color they couldn't have a roof like this some of them did you know long time ago but what they're building now it's just so mundane that you drive down the street you go I like that house you drunk I like that house well if you like the first one you're gonna like the last one cuz it looks the same it's not gonna look the same in the future home I promise you amen like I said Mama's not gonna have to walk by and go why did it pace at that color but ends up a form of a history body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now we understand and no one thinks for sure that we're not going to get something it's here hey man we're not going to get there's not a body for me hanging up in a closet in heaven my theophany is who you're looking at now inside of me the eternal part of me and we'll explain that in just a minute Mego over an hour today that's all right say Amen okay it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now obviously we know for sure that if we die we're going to have to change them right something's got changed this is not going to another dimension and then let that pull from that dimension is going to pull what that soul into that six dimension that's what the pull is because remember I believe the pull from the six dimension is going have to come this way because all them in that six dimensions got to come into this dimension why are they still over there and don't want to come back why was brother Brent I'm looking back and said do I have to go back into that why it was dying death has to be destroyed here folk when death is destroyed here that'll make that six dimension come in here then we'll see the people that are dead and going on why does why do they want to come back here they never said one time we want to go back brother branham no he was the only one that said I want to go back because his body was still laying in this dimension and then a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now ends there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was but we're not little dots on the paper we're what we are the word we're born by the word our new birth comes by the Word of God the preaching of the gospel Bree said let us make man in our own image and in our likeness now when man became in that body talking about Genesis 1:26 men had control the fish and the fowl of the beasts of the field then there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2 he done made male and female but there's no man to till the soil then God made man out of the dust of the earth he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee gave him a foot like a bear made him on the image and this earthly body is in the image of animal life we know that and it's made out of the same kind of material your body now he's talking about a human body this body your human body is made or sorry I don't want to interject your body is made just the same kind of material as a horse a dog or anything like that it's made out of calcium potash petroleum cosmic light you're just know all flecks like that is not the same flesh now you watch it because remember we can't give a animal a blood transfusion so so we are separated from that all right but we do have the same calcium potash that makes their flesh makes ours how can they put a pig valve in your heart okay that's flesh that has nothing to do with the spirit there's nothing to it so that's just a flesh body they can take a pig biome and put it in your heart and it what won't reject it okay so we're close Bigfoot oh I'm still giggling about them they're just enough left anyhow all flesh like that is people gotta have something to do that's all I knew about them they just needed something to do if a guy drove down from Minnesota to look for Bigfoot in Georgia he didn't have a lot to do I wonder why I said when he someone do it for Bigfoot for a couple of days where you going Georgia can you go cut the grass home before you leave it's a different flash but it's made out of the dust of the earth where we came from where it came from but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany all right so your soul is your theophany all right I just wanted to get to that right there now you know put it back together okay we'll stop pretending just for a second now now let's read one more I had it separated on my notes but they put it back together so that's okay questions and answers on Hebrews they kind of play with my notes every once in a while but it's good now he's speaking of the souls of spirit while we pack our bodies over the grave of the sainted ones for this body and the body in the first place when God the logos that went out of God or as I went through it the Catholic caught in comedy ternal sonship go with not eternal sonship but the son that was with the father in the beginning with the logos that went out of God not to different people now I didn't draw two different people over there one person all right what here's God all eternal if I can understand him he just steps over and starts speech but he's in a body because he's that Genesis 1:26 man was in the body all right and it was the theophany of God that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see thank God a better eye it didn't have ears like you hear but a far more hearing see it was at the often he said all this rainbow condescended into a theophany Moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back parts and said it looked like a man right all right so everybody okay with this Genesis 1:26 man it's what a part of God not a separate person but a part of God and man collection if we're a separate person then we must be the third person no no there's only one person of God and there's only one person that's manifested itself into a bride that all right and man bear with me just for a few minutes there by alright my boring your stiff the man let's go around here I want to get to something what I've done was I separated the quote I'll be okay I handle it I handle this booth devil I can't live here we go thank you brother come on up here and talk to me so hit so now what happened here we go now we're going to develop this I'm not going to use any quotes but you can go through Scripture and there's no way I could write them all down but remember you and I are the children of God we were born by the Word of God there was a there was a place in the Word of God that God saw that you would respond to is that Alright that you would respond to and then that would connect you to this word okay because all God's children were right here listen like I was telling Bob brother branham said you were in your great-great-grandfather now let's not be vulgar but you weren't there in sperm because sperm dies sperm goes away farming goes out you understand what was going on so you weren't just a little sperm running in your great-grandfather and then he happened to give it to the and then he happened no it's the DNA it's the just of what may as to what part that makes you your blood the blood still life right your DNA was in your great-great-grandfather they can trace you back further than that so you were not in there as a person but you were identified by the DNA of the dáil family I was identified by that and I can go back so far because grandpa great-grandpa had relations with Grand mine broke grandpa didn't broke paw and then brought me there by all right with that but now remember glide does not multiply by sexual reproduction never has never will sex has nothing to do with God that was permitted because why because Satan blocked us off property guard said brother branham brother branham said that Satan in the Garden of Eden cut any no other sons of God could be born the one was polluted Eve's mind and natural womb was polluted so there was no way you and I could come we were absolutely alienated the Bible says cut off from the Commonwealth of God even though the word is here it's eternal it's already spoke what's going to happen why brother Brown said sin is so bad to disbelieve God's Word will that cut us off genesis 3:15 says I'll put enmity what there was a division there was a gap that Adam couldn't fill back up amen but there was one man that could the Creator the Christ the anointing the Holy Ghost all these things that great fountain he could but now remember when Abel was born remember what this is right here Genesis 1:26 is the book of Redemption hello think about it the Genesis 1:26 man didn't fall but what was identified with that Genesis 1:26 man fell okay remember we didn't break relationship remember I'm going to read you the last quote you didn't become sons that the rebirth you always were son but by the rebirth you could be brought back amen not that we had to eternal life when we got here no no we had representation that the foreknowledge of God saw where we would go and had it waiting for us when we got here Tamizh are so simple because I know one thing's for sure I'll promise you I was a vile kid when I was 18 to about 30 and there was no Holy Ghost in myself because the things I did he wouldn't have done so there was no Holy Ghost there was no eternal life in my soul as a possession now that's just really stupid for somebody to say I was just great eternal something when I was born but the people in the message preacher they do now I can see my part of the representation that I had that in 1998 God would meet me at a place had it already waiting for me already paid the price because we gotta get over here and pay a price had already paid the price and wrote my name in the book but did you know it knew you didn't know it till you realize what greater to me that's a greater Redemption than to just say I always was eternal the guy you looking at right now is getting old he ain't eternal the guy inside is but we'll talk about saying just the same if you'll bear with me I've been trying to keep in an hour I've been doing pretty good but today we're going to go over a little bit that alright brother branham said your soup will not ball over remember he said that one time he said sisters he said you said don't worry about you and I believe he you know what I believe if that man said that he said look sister your suit won't bowl over I don't believe her suit bowled over he was telling them something supernatural and he wanted them to listen alright so don't worry about you about your suit we're about your suit all right look if this is the Shogun I'm okay if I confuse anybody yet nobody's raises their hand okay but this Genesis 1:26 man that's why I love it because it encompasses everything we are because in Genesis 1:26 is not the Old Testament now they're a part of Redemption Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all those but they are not part of that Genesis 1:26 men because the Genesis 1:26 man is sons and daughters of God Abraham was never called a son of God he's called a friend of God David would not have done what he did because you say all know prove it alright I'll prove it was there any redemption in the Old Testament that's all going to ask you correct there was no born-again experience in the Old Testament no David would not have had his best friend killed committed adultery now that really sounds like a Christian doesn't it to me it's like I told him downstairs I'm glad God created grace and not me because nobody'd make it but by god being grace he's the one only one that could ever develop the word grace which is unmerited favor David you're the Alpha my but God he killed his best friend so he could get his wife pregnant or he had his wife pregnant already he was trying to cover it up had his best friend killed on purpose that was premeditated murder because he said you would draw yourself from the battle and just let that got that far but yet he was yet he's going to be one of the people there you know that God city was out for mine well he must have liked something about it but it but he didn't have this Genesis 1:26 man so the Old Testament all right you got it the Old Testament the Bible talks about in the book Luke it gives you all the generation and it calls back to where this one man Adam was the son of God and man that's Adam back here all right all the way down in the Old Testament there was no way that this could develop inside of a human being there was no way that the soul of men you said prove it okay I'll prove it the blood of bulls and goats only cupboard scenes now tell me about this person right here that ain't covering sin that's sinless but the blood of bulls and goats only covered sin if put a covering over the people as long as they made a sacrifice God did not destroy them but now they are going to be judged and man David paid for what he did remember David paid God said there's too much bloodshed you gonna have a problem no look at his kids look at his whole family within turmoil after all this happened but the blood of bulls and goats only covered sins so this right here Genesis 1:26 man this Christ come to do what not to just cover since he came to eradicate sin and man he came to do away with sin and put it back in fellowship with God amen so the blood of bulls and goats only covered sin so there was no born-again believer in the Old Testament no no that was an anointing sure Christ is all look if you can't see Christ in every verse read it again so Christ was in every verse because look Christ was in Moses God should have killed Moses Moses of the murderer look at all these people in the Old Testament the one little things that they did show that they didn't have this in their soul because you and I love you know sometimes we are pretty pretty we're Rascals but how can the Holy Ghost let you kill somebody how can the Holy Ghost let you let you let your best friend get killed on purpose - I'm saying all the characteristics isn't in the Old Testament was that God covered that sin there was no way to do away with it they still had that cloud member brother Aaron said that cloud of darkness was still over them in the Old Testament and I like what one brother said he said you know remember the little dove that was in the ark remember Noah sends the Dove out he comes back then he goes out with a leaf no one knows that the world is getting green again and then remember he sends it out and they don't come back anymore he said that I love this Bob Ford Bob Bob take notes that does tried to find a place to land and it did on the river Jordan the Dove came down and found a place to land hey man he couldn't land in the Old Testament he couldn't find a place to land but that does found a lamb he found a place that he could reside a man so that dove falls what descends from heaven like a dove on a man named Jesus Christ which was this man right here we just read that right this man right here comes down I don't want to reach there which was the fullness of all this now we go to Genesis 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God this was this in other words this righted the ship it brought the Dove it brought the lamb and it brought the Lamb of God together and he died and when he died on the day of Pentecost that same man came back in a mini member body not just one body it's not just in one person that whole of Genesis 1:26 Christ opened the book he opened the seals broke the seal what there's one seal brother I'm sitting out with the seal of death he broke the seal of death and brought us what back into fellowship with God now let's read a few quotes now make a comment all right tell you man all right number two number 12 in just a few minutes so just bear with me just a minute God which was a part of God God seen what the end would be we just said that from the beginning and the logos came to the earth this person not another person he didn't send another person this one guy came himself a man the logos came to earth which was Christ the word spoken word of God now let's stop right there but what did he do as this person was going to speak and create sons and daughters of God what happened to this man he was the son of man he was the store of the what sort of the seed what is the seed the seeds a word where'd he saw it me and you that's why we're born by the spoken word of God not by sexual desire I'll get to that just a second I want to show you something Lord show me I hope it's right it was good right to me poka Word of God part of God and was made flesh and dwelt among us and then we come out of Christ Oh which makes the same life that was in God in Christ in you and just as sure as God raised this up we've got to come with the same thing it's the same spirits in us because it's the Spirit of God making us sons and daughters of God oh isn't that marvelous how do we get it by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that's what and accepting it and then God in return give us the Holy Spirit crying in our hearts Abba Father my God my God and then we were resurrected in the last days to be caught up and he said that day you shall know that I am in the father the father may iron you and you and me there's the spirit coming out of God manifested as the logos come down and made flesh dwelt among us revs revs died taking on the penalty of sin raised up again setting up the Majesty on high the right hand of God and the Holy Spirit coming back bringing in the same spirit in the individuals now to bring them back into relationship with their creator is it that marvelous and man brings us back it's kinda like tell like Daniel seventy weeks you know you take Daniel seven weeks you got sixty nine weeks and then you got to gap and you got one week left right and what is in here Gentiles right but now if they had been no Gentile bride it would have been this all Jews the seventy weeks would have started and ended and they'd been no gap amen same way with the Old Testament if sons and daughters would have been born here Satan had had done what he did Adam doing what he did then it was just the bend we would have been born into Eden and we would just kept on living the eternity but that didn't happen we fell and when we fell we came down here into sin and then he came all the way down through all that came down here where we are Jesus Christ to do what take it back there I come from God and oh boy I go back to God amen and that's a revelation you can't you say that oh they're your life and don't go to hell but if you say I can't if you get a revelation if that's where you came from then you've got to go back to it you got to go back remember Satan can't give you a revelation like God can give you revelation is eternal so you've got to know where you come from know what you're doing down here what to fulfill the plan and purpose of God and then we're going right back in the Garden of Eden and man alright what number was that trying to hurry number thirteen the Holy Spirit is nothing in the world but the Spirit of Christ back working in the church it's a Spirit of Christ worked in Jesus the low gosh works in Jesus he gave his blood and he might cleanse us and God by foreknowledge where he heard that before godbye for knowledge set orders in the Church of different things that same logos work in us we'll do the same thing got to all right let's go to number 14 life 1957 but close our eyes to our imagination for a few minutes and go we're back in the for there was anything the great fountain of all eternity that was spirit of love joy spirit of honesty that spirit of prudence in this perfection then out of the existence of the father went to logos which was the son which was the theophany which was the body of a great Jehovah God went forth in a celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany now he's not finished then that the oppan he was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the Trinity running through your filter all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that and that's the very way we go plumb back to the original beginning of God which was what back over here there we are born again not of flesh born again not of blood but born again by the Spirit and then then that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us and then when we die from this life we go into the body which of this earthly body because all we have a theophany to go into a body celestial then that's the coming of the Lord Jesus this body this body is picked up from the earth again we're not going to get a new one folks it's this one redeemed mmm and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever then all the perversion all the things that sin in perversion we'll all go out of existence number 15 Jehovah Jireh 1964 God tearing loose I like this one oh yeah cutting apart separating himself dividing himself he did the same thing on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down that pillar of fire came down that followed Israel he's talked about different that pillar of fire came down that followed Israel we all know that that was the logo that was Christ and when it came down onto their Pentecost what did it do it divided itself and tongues of fire set upon each one of them God dividing himself among the people old brother you can be undivided with that same spirit with the same spirit that was in Christ hey man I Street number 16 paradox 1964 he was God we are not God okay you gotta have a revelation there too because we are God all right but we're not the God look remember remember there's one man that's a big G that's why always there we got BG and you got little G's we the little G he to be G don't get them separated I mean don't get them mixed up okay but we are this big G made manifest in the little G Laird's you get that with BG okay this he was God we're not God what we're not we can't look I can't buy my soul save anybody but I remember though let me go back and let's just bring something out right here real quick that's real close because what I said in Sunday School class you take somebody like Gabby she's back with the kids she don't talk wait a minute let's take sister Jean she never talked I always told her to be quiet but you take sister Jean I believe she's a born-again christian chance for a long time she explains she displays that but she doesn't she sings a special if we make her we may make you do it again you and your brother over here but we are but you know look at this Jean though she doesn't say anything she's not like me she's not you know talking all the timing and she she prays she reads her Bible she studies so we go now to the white zone judgment she thinks man I am I'm not anything I haven't done anything for God but one day while she was on earth now I want you to get this one day while she was on earth she don't drive anymore think but if you did Drive if she was on the highway and she had a flat tire okay this man stops by he's just an old greedy got tattoos all up his arm living with three women kick some beer cans out of his car when he gets out - I'm coming changes our tire and she says wonder oh you and he said nothing he's just fine you'd wanna talk about it our life talking about imparting eternal life we get to the white throne judgment this man walks up in front of the white throne with his head down he knows he's in for it he knows he's not live the Christian life he know you don't have to tell you if in judgment you don't have to tell at that moment you won't have to tell him what he did he knows what he did and he's getting ready and God's fixing the way judgment on this man because remember in this life he was quite a whoremonger he was all these different things he had to go to hell he had to go to hell he says I I pass and he hears this boy's way back in the back and I don't know jinkin of course we're going to be eternal so you can hear this regime from anywhere that would be great you know she can be shouting hallelujah and I'm gonna go I told you you could do that but we get up to the day of judgment though and she seems like she's never done anything for God and all of a sudden God's fixing to pass judgment on this guy that has no chance and she says hold on a minute remember God brother Brown said God loves for you to remind him of his promises right so shifter gene says hold on a minute said that man changed my tire one one day and said you told us in the Bible that a cup of water or anything that you do to the least of my little ones it will not be forgotten in this earth are in the world to come and not that God's going to be surprised he knows that's what's going to happen but for sister Jean to impart eternal life to a man that never needed it never wanted it on his way to hell so don't tell me we are gods we are gods but we're not the God like this man so you got running through your filter because what if you notice it's beautiful Illustrated when great pillar fire that followed the children of Israel through the wilderness it appeared to st. Paul when it come down under their Pentecost it broke up in tongues of fire set upon each of them that was God in this pillar fire the logo separating himself among his people showing that Christ and the bride see God and His Church are becoming one why it's just the most beautiful thing you ever seen amen this Garden of Eden great wonderful thing absolutely but sin marred and broke us off but what happened though is God that didn't stop him he just kept on coming he's coming to get his kids he's coming to get his kids it's what he's doing he's coming to get his kids because his kids are in the Word of God he comes down here and he sews the seed Word of God he goes back up and comes back what so he can get into me and you so he can get into me and you when Jesus was here by yourself he didn't save one person he didn't give nobody the baptism of the Holy Ghost while he was there but when he went back what when he went back to where he came from the full purpose of God comes now to where I can now go back and get into the people how by the word by the word by the word we are sons and daughters by the Word of God and then the Word of God that was right here it's now right here and then right here he's going to take us out and take us back here at Genesis 1:26 man is the Holy Ghost you got in your soul if you're born again that's just to me as simple as you can get it but it started right here and it comes all the way through this big long journey and then finally it rested where it rested on you God dividing himself so now let's look at number 18 or finish 18 which kept 17 number 18 Smyrna church a brother Evan said now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus what all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh not a second person and thereby gained the title of son even so we look at me eternal in his thoughts we were eternally in estill we were part listen we were not just part of the mind of God we were the eternal part we were not just there's a book there's different books there's a book of life there's a part you never named never wasn't they depart that your name was in it and took out Judas then there's a part that the eternal station the eternal section of God's mind is his children his progeny the ones that watch even eternal in his thoughts in our turn now what if he would have kept them as a thought we'd have never developed but the logos had to speak our name had to speak our name way over here what does it matter if it took 10 million years for God to get to you wanted to matter to him that wasn't even a millisecond for him to get to you and tell you hey you're my son you're my daughter so even as we turtle in his thoughts in our turn see in our turn not forever not we always was but in our turn my turn was December the 17th 1998 that was my turn amen that was when God came and filled me where the Holy Ghost that I should have had before the foundation of the world but got trapped into all this the prophet of God told us right by Adam and Eve sending it trapped us into what below the fall line that all right we got trapped down here so even as we eternal in these thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken-word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we our seed we were always in the Word of God we just didn't know it we were blackened the cloud was over us we had spin that we listened I don't know if it bothers you or not but sin is what bothers me oh it doesn't bother you okay it bothers me what bothers me is what like the brother said my stinking thinking is what bothers me and most of it it's the devil God gets in there just about that much we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed we had representation the woman at the well had representation Christ looked all the way by hey if he was Christ here he knew he had her already hey man hey how are we gonna ever fail if you know you're in God you can't fail we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we're reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were in that Genesis 1:26 man may I may I say without you know somebody will kill you if you if you misinterpret the quote so let's just read it like this and then I'm gonna coming because we were seed is the reason we can be quickened and non seed there is nothing to quicken if you weren't here if you weren't part of that low God if you weren't part of that Word of God you never will be so God by foreknowledge putting another quote together by foreknowledge knew you would want it here so he had it already waiting on you here that is it for you he didn't write a new word of god so that mark action Rob could come in he wrote that before the foundation of the world knowing that one day he would think God moved from Massachusetts and learn how to talk well some he still can't say car okay with the care but he shot lunch at the journey though he he waited all those years mark didn't he you were just like me we were born in sin we did things wrong but God waited for the patient God because he had already spoke it right here because he had already looked down here and saw where mark was so he already had it for him had it waiting on him and then what happened he comes down to Massachusetts I don't you didn't get morning up there he got morning down here okay so he come he had a journey and he met God here he heard a word that was not a 23rd chapter of Revelation that's why my brother brown told him he said don't you make me Antichrist he said I can't get outside the word so everything you have is got to be inside that 66 books of the Bible because it was wrote for you let me give you let me sound the trumpet that was written just for his children that was written just for you so that you can respond somebody preaches the Word of God and you respond to that what that's that Sheen word coming alive that God saw before the foundation of the world that that would meet right here see I believe that more than I believe always was eternal when I was drinking and doing all the things I was doing I had God in me no no no no no one more time no God will not dwell in an unclean vessel he will not dwell in something that he can't have control over and the things I did remember those songs the things I used to do I do them no more why because the seed word was quickened the Bible was where I was born from I wasn't born sure I was born from Samuel Peggy Dale yeah but I was reborn I've been reborn I've been changed why because of my second birth hey man let me give you a little information here this is what I driving down the road for whee I'm sorry it took so long anybody got more questions let me tell you something when I was looking up those quotes Friday night because I couldn't sleep probably too much that case that antimony give us but I was reading about the offing brother Branham was talking about going across the curtain of time and that nine year old woman he said why is this woman so happy the angel of the Lord what does he say he said she was ninety years old when she in your in your service received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it changed her to an eighteen to twenty year old woman let me ask you a question and this helped me put some things together but I'm 57 years old I know I don't look it I look older I know go ahead but I'm 57 years old if I wasn't born again now see God gives you us God gives you a soul right better everybody got one God had to give you one Satan can't give you a soul everybody everybody I sold that come from God but that's where your choice is to be made and then now that nine year old woman let me tell you how because the Bible says were a new one creation reborn we become a newborn baby in Christ amen so that woman was 90 years old she lived in sin for come on people she lived in sin for 90 years her theophany looked just like her she wasn't a young woman brother Graham said a sinner will be judged in the body they send in and am I like brother Dale I don't think they get when they go to the fifth dimension they got this new body this 18 to 20 no it's exactly because we look to be reborn that's the whole thing you may not get this it may take you years I got it I got it I got it I got it so fresh when I was turned when I became born again in 1998 I was 38 years old my soul went to 18 my soul went to 18 to 20 because that's what's growing me back that's what's going to change my body you're not going I'm not 57 years old in my soul but when I was reborn God didn't kill my soul he created a new one not new as then killed me no remember the Bible says that the earth is to be destroyed remember annihilated no brother ever said nope that's not what that means he said it's just going to be burnt over and made new I didn't get a new soul that's why let you see if you watch these doctrines if you don't preach them right you can follow one side of the other I didn't get a new soul but my soul was made new that's exactly right my soul became new by the new birth new birth that's why it's called new birth your first birth is making you this my first birth is 57 years but my second birth my new birth put me back right here and then my body has got to obey and go back to that that's where the change is coming people when we realize which they all worry I got this new body we got this meal it's your soul it's a whole new remember you have new thoughts you have new ideas you act different the same hand that me and Mark used to drink beer with I think that's okay we all right now God didn't cut this and I'll get me a new one he cleaned the desire inside and then this obeys this so now our problem is is we got that gap in between called the spirit memory reason conscious fiction imagination we remember all the old things we used to do we remember that we were centers we remember all right but we've been changed our thoughts have got to come back to this the word that's why thoughts must be that's why we're being born again the Bible has 66 books but it's eternal in 66 books every born-again believer has got their soul reborn you really don't know the property God said he said if you knew really what happened to the new birth because it didn't just it did it took that old person I was and it burnt that nature off there used to be and I became new I'm at that point to where God saw us right here and that Genesis 1:26 I swine I love that Genesis 1:26 he shows me where I came from and it actually shows me where I'm going what I'm doing here and where I'm going back to God did not give me a new tongue it's the same the same old flesh tongue that used to curse like a sailor but I hope by the grace of God by the rebirth the word has changed it to where it brings life and not death see that's the whole thing when Jesus came he had all this ending he didn't need a new birth he didn't need a rebirth no he didn't need a rebirth he always was that he had to come down and human flesh to be a sacrifice so that we can have something to look to and call him a redeemer and then sure he was a redeemer but my when I got redeemed listen when it brother got redeemed like his deal but when I got redeemed that made it personal that made it me not the seven sons of sceva Paul we know see I want to be considered in that group that he was talking about not the seventh son Paul I know Jesus we know wait they all we know but you you haven't had a personal experience with God yet if you'll go and get a personal experience and talk about Paul yeah we'll talk but you got to have the God that Paul had and man you got to have the glad that Paul had because listen the devil doesn't bother them the devil that devil called Legion he sure he gave the human people fit but all it took was one son when Jesus put his foot on that Shore Legion come running and said son of God what are you doing here what are you doing here to torment me before my time it took one man to walk up in front of him and change the whole thing Legion we are many many demons jesus said when I can't cast out but about 100 I find me some help no they said can't we leave this man and Jesus said go until he said go look at the power that was behind it though go and thousands of demons left that man thousands of demons why the Word of God that word of God is forever it will not change let's stand our feet it will take us in a rapture but we got to realize that when we were born again it didn't just make us different it made us eternal god bless you thank you for putting up with me for a few hours geez I'm sorry I am I am I hope that Ryan did that help you wake up run okay and helping thank you for paying attention for a little while anyway nobody block this door okay and walk you in let's try you love the Lord I love it when God can show you something and you know what it may be elementary to you I mean look some people have told me things and honestly in my human and my human nature I'm white you should have seen that a long time ago but you don't say that but but really you look at people you go well now somebody look at me and go you really didn't know that yeah my soul is 18 to 20 years old now right now when I become born-again it went to that condition so now all it's got to do is I've got to realize it and head right back toward it head right back to that condition that we had before the foundation of the world we weren't there's people come on now we weren't there as souls we weren't there as anything what we had representation in that one man that one man represented all of Christendom that Genesis 1:26 man the Word of God I think so I would not be I would not be denied if you ever need what what page number 6 6 3 6 63 in the spiral book I would not be tonight let's thing up if you have a need if you don't we'll just sing one verse and then we'll be dismissed if you need have a need please come but if not then I'm sorry I've kept you
