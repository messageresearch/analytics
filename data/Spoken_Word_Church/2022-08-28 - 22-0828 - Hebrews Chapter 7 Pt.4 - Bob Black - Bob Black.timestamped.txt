[0:02] i'm certainly looking forward to what
[0:03] the lord has in store for us this
[0:05] morning
[0:06] or today
[0:07] and uh y'all just just pull on the gift
[0:10] um and and you'll get what you have need
[0:12] of
[0:14] because there's a promise that if we
[0:15] have a question he'll put somebody in
[0:16] the poop of a dancer
[0:20] so this morning um i just wanted to kind
[0:22] of run through uh
[0:24] we'll just pull up hebrews chapter seven
[0:26] and we'll just kind of continue studying
[0:28] that um maybe without so much slides and
[0:31] and whatnot but i'll just kind of talk
[0:33] through some things
[0:35] but um let's let's just go to the lord
[0:36] in prayer before we get into this
[0:38] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[0:40] together lord god and i pray lord that
[0:41] you'll just bless our study as we unpack
[0:43] these scriptures lord jesus and you'll
[0:45] open it up lord that it'll be profitable
[0:46] to us lord it will you'll give us
[0:48] understanding lord and just bless
[0:49] brother william as he's back there
[0:51] studying and preparing lord and prepare
[0:53] our hearts lord as we step through the
[0:54] scriptures lord that will be
[0:56] that that the ground will be good and
[0:58] tilled up and ready lord to receive what
[0:59] you have in store for us today granted
[1:01] lord in your name amen
[1:04] so so just to kind of you know the theme
[1:06] of hebrews is is that really what paul's
[1:09] trying to set for us to understand is
[1:11] that perfection perfection could not
[1:13] come by the law so he's trying to set
[1:15] set the stage for us that perfection
[1:18] perfect perfection
[1:20] in other words uh where where you match
[1:22] up with what god thought of you before
[1:24] the foundation of the world and you're
[1:26] you're living the life because the life
[1:27] of christ is in you that kind of
[1:29] perfection
[1:30] comes by this man melchizedek that came
[1:32] and visited abraham and the old
[1:34] testament was a law it was the old
[1:36] testament was a shadow of all these
[1:38] things that now you can see come to in
[1:40] fruition in reality in the new testament
[1:42] which is what paul says in hebrews
[1:44] chapter 10 he says for the law having a
[1:46] shadow of good things to come and not
[1:48] the very image of the things can never
[1:50] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:53] year by year continually make the the
[1:55] comers there unto perfect
[1:57] so the law
[1:59] is something that you could look at
[2:01] and compare your life with and but yet
[2:03] to be to achieve perfection requires a
[2:06] sacrifice to be made and the life of
[2:08] christ to come and live in you and so
[2:11] if we just take a little background to
[2:13] as paul is leading up to this point and
[2:15] that we get to in hebrews chapter seven
[2:17] let's just let's just do a little
[2:18] background and remember what he said in
[2:20] hebrews one and two and three and four
[2:23] on and on so i'm just going to run
[2:24] quickly through those uh some some
[2:26] points so in hebrews chapter one he said
[2:29] god hath in these last days spoken unto
[2:31] us by his son
[2:33] and in verse three he said who bring the
[2:35] brightness of his glory and the express
[2:37] image of his person and upholding all
[2:39] things by the word of his power when he
[2:40] had by himself purged our sins set down
[2:42] on the right hand of the majesty on high
[2:44] see he's building up his case
[2:47] to this this one this melchizedek this
[2:50] one this logos that talk to abraham is
[2:52] the is the very image the brightness of
[2:55] his glory and he's building building up
[2:56] this case so that he can present it to
[2:58] us that you ain't going to get
[2:59] perfection perfection by the law you're
[3:01] not going to get perfected by your works
[3:03] but only by this man
[3:05] that came and visited abraham
[3:07] but we see jesus who was made a little
[3:09] lower than the angels for the suffering
[3:10] of death crowned with glory and honor
[3:12] that he by the grace of god should takes
[3:14] death for every man
[3:16] he's the one that's going to perfect us
[3:18] because he can he he paid the price for
[3:20] us that we look to what he did not to
[3:22] our own works
[3:23] for it became him for whom are all
[3:25] things and by whom are all things and
[3:27] bringing many sons into glory to make
[3:29] the captain of their salvation perfect
[3:31] through sufferings the captain of their
[3:33] salvation i i love that story that
[3:35] brother brown was just telling talking
[3:36] about about the the captain is the one
[3:38] that shows you how it's done that
[3:41] paul talked about how he's the
[3:42] forerunner that that came down and lived
[3:44] the life and went through all the things
[3:47] went beyond the veil and did all these
[3:48] things first just like that man that ran
[3:51] up the ladder in that store that run
[3:52] around was telling about that for the
[3:54] captain runs up the ladder and sprays
[3:56] out the fire and says come on boys you
[3:58] can do it and jesus did all this he's
[4:00] the captain of our salvation he he's the
[4:02] one that went first and showed us how to
[4:04] do it and then you follow behind him
[4:06] with that same power and that same life
[4:08] in you
[4:10] because he he was our forerunner in
[4:12] hebrews chapter 3 says wherefore holy
[4:14] brethren partakers of the heavenly call
[4:16] and consider the apostle and high priest
[4:18] of our profession christ jesus
[4:21] so paul's starting he's starting to lay
[4:23] in that foundation that he's our high
[4:25] priest who was faithful to them that
[4:27] appointed him as also moses with faith
[4:30] was faithful in all his house harden not
[4:32] your hearts as in the provocation and
[4:34] the day of temptation in the wilderness
[4:36] don't harden your heart against this
[4:37] this against this fact that christ is
[4:39] the one that makes you perfect you're
[4:41] not perfect perfected by by by doing
[4:43] trying trying to do something in your
[4:45] own self but when you when you when
[4:47] christ is in your living then that's
[4:50] that's the evidence of your perfection
[4:52] so in hebrews chapter four he said there
[4:54] remaineth there for a rest there's a
[4:56] rest when christ comes and steps in and
[4:58] lives in you and you're you're not
[5:00] resting on what you're doing and resting
[5:02] upon your own interpretation but you're
[5:04] resting upon the word and on the
[5:05] finished work that christ did for you
[5:07] for he that has entered into his wrist
[5:09] he has uh he also has ceased from his
[5:12] own works as god did from his you're not
[5:14] doing something on your own works
[5:16] anymore but now is christ living in you
[5:19] christ is the one that's changing your
[5:20] thinking and making you want to come to
[5:22] church and making you want to read the
[5:23] bible
[5:24] because you're thinking and your
[5:25] thoughts everything your whole being has
[5:27] changed because now christ is living in
[5:29] you
[5:30] let us labor therefore to enter into
[5:32] that rest going through sanctification
[5:34] going through that all those stages
[5:36] laboring
[5:37] to enter into that rest lest any man
[5:38] fall after the same example of unbelief
[5:41] for the word of god how are you gonna
[5:43] how are you gonna come to that rest for
[5:44] the word the word of god is quick and
[5:46] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[5:48] sword piercing even to the dividing
[5:50] asunder of soul and spirit so in verse
[5:52] 14 of hebrews 4 paul says seeing then
[5:55] that we have a great high priest
[5:57] we got i see he's laying that foundation
[5:59] bringing it up to melchizedek
[6:01] who is who is a king and a priest
[6:04] combining those two aspects together see
[6:07] and then we've got a great high priest
[6:08] that is passed into the heavens jesus
[6:10] the son of god let us hold fast our
[6:13] profession for we have not in high
[6:15] priests which cannot be touched with the
[6:16] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[6:18] all points tempted like as we are yet
[6:20] without sin let us therefore come boldly
[6:22] under the throne of grace so we got
[6:24] something to be bold about we got
[6:25] something to have confidence in that
[6:27] we've got an advocate that went through
[6:29] the same things that we're going through
[6:30] that was tempted like we are but yet
[6:32] overcame he was the captain that went
[6:34] first to prove that it could be done
[6:37] let us therefore come boldly under the
[6:38] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[6:41] and find grace to help in time of need
[6:43] and in hebrews chapter five for every
[6:45] high priest taken from among men is what
[6:48] is ordained for men a high priest is to
[6:50] help you is ordained for men and things
[6:53] pertaining to god that he may offer both
[6:55] gifts and sacrifices for sins
[6:58] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[6:59] and on them that are out of the way for
[7:01] that he himself also is compassed with
[7:04] infirmity though he were a son yet
[7:06] learned he obedience by the things which
[7:08] he suffered and being made perfect
[7:11] let's let's pause on that for a second
[7:13] being made perfect
[7:14] what what does that mean you think about
[7:16] jesus
[7:17] going through all the the uh being born
[7:20] in a manger and growing up and coming to
[7:22] a place until finally he was there at
[7:23] the river jordan
[7:25] and and god could look down on him and
[7:27] say well now he's matched up
[7:29] with the thought where i thought of
[7:31] before the foundation of the world where
[7:33] he would be when he's ready to enter
[7:35] into his ministry so see god when when
[7:37] your per god wants to bring you to a
[7:39] place where you're matching up with his
[7:41] thought of you
[7:42] being made perfect perfection comes from
[7:45] where where god can finally positionally
[7:48] place you that matches up with god's
[7:50] thought of you before the foundation of
[7:52] the world and then you're then you're
[7:53] then you're perfect you're in a place
[7:55] where you're you're matching up with his
[7:57] thoughts
[7:58] being made perfect he became the author
[8:01] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[8:03] obey him because he was made perfect
[8:05] because he came to that place that
[8:06] matched up with god's thought of him
[8:08] then you can come to that place where
[8:10] you match up with god's thought of you
[8:12] he was called of god and high priest
[8:15] after the order of melchizedek and paul
[8:17] said of whom we have many things to say
[8:19] and hard to be uttered seeing ye are
[8:20] dull of hearing they need to go on to
[8:22] kind of give them a a a rough up about
[8:25] how you you're supposed to be able to
[8:27] teach others and you're supposed to be
[8:28] able to eat meat and all these kind of
[8:30] things i've got a lot more things to say
[8:31] about melchizedek but i can't quite do
[8:34] it yet
[8:34] but then you get over in hebrews 7
[8:37] and he starts laying it out melchizedek
[8:41] really i think what he's saying there in
[8:43] hebrews chapter 5 is that melchizedek is
[8:46] is kind of a deep subject matter because
[8:48] it's getting into the foreknowledge of
[8:49] god it's getting into the
[8:51] the godhead it's getting into that god
[8:53] thought that you were part of god that
[8:55] life that's in you now by the new birth
[8:58] is part of you now that that the same
[9:00] way that that levi paid tithing or
[9:02] abraham
[9:04] because he was in abraham waiting to be
[9:05] manifested abraham could one day
[9:07] fellowship with him well well same way
[9:09] you were in christ and god wanted to
[9:11] fellowship with you and and wanted a way
[9:13] to express himself to you so so
[9:16] let's go back to the theme the theme of
[9:18] the whole book of hebrews
[9:20] is that the law
[9:21] having a shadow of good things to come
[9:23] the law is a shadow of something and
[9:26] you've got to be perfected that the only
[9:27] way that you can be perfected by
[9:30] is by christ
[9:32] colossians chapter 2 verse 16 says let
[9:35] no man therefore judge you in meter and
[9:36] drink or in a respective and holy day or
[9:38] of the new boon or the sabbath days
[9:40] which are a shadow of things to come but
[9:42] the body is of christ so christ is the
[9:45] central theme of everything jesus is
[9:47] everything he's our high priest
[9:50] he's our king
[9:51] he's our rest
[9:53] that's what paul is talking about he's
[9:54] our arrest he's our atonement he's our
[9:57] god
[9:58] he's that melchizedek that came to talk
[10:00] to abraham he's the logos if you're part
[10:03] of him he's that one body that we're all
[10:06] part of
[10:07] that one theophany that you're part of
[10:09] that you're baptized into that one body
[10:10] by one spirit by one by one faith one
[10:13] baptism all those things that's what
[10:15] colossians is saying here in verse 17
[10:18] which are a shadow of things to come but
[10:19] the body is of christ
[10:21] and the body is talking about is
[10:24] you see when you when you when you hold
[10:26] your hand up to a light
[10:27] you cast a shadow but if you bring it
[10:30] closer and closer then eventually you'll
[10:32] see the body
[10:33] the body is the thing that's cast in the
[10:36] shadow so in the new testament we see
[10:38] the body
[10:40] so let's go in hebrews chapter six just
[10:42] continue along with a little background
[10:45] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[10:46] of christ let us go on unto perfection
[10:50] unto go on unto that life
[10:52] go on unto where you receive that same
[10:54] logos that was back there before the
[10:56] foundation of the world
[10:58] and then verse 9 but beloved we are
[11:00] persuaded better things of you and
[11:01] things that accompany salvation though
[11:03] we though speak in verse 17 god willing
[11:06] more abundantly to show unto the heirs
[11:08] of promise the immutability of his cow
[11:10] what what promise the promise of the
[11:12] holy ghost the promise of life the
[11:14] promise in psalms that i'm going to give
[11:17] i'm going to send a pre a high priest
[11:19] after the order of melchizedek
[11:22] the immutability of his council
[11:23] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[11:25] immutable things in which it was
[11:27] impossible for god to lie we might have
[11:29] a strong consolation who have fled for
[11:31] refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[11:33] before us which hope we have as an
[11:35] anchor of the soul both sure and
[11:37] steadfast and which entereth into that
[11:39] within the veil what what kind of veil
[11:41] the veil of your flesh that he had
[11:43] entered in on the day of pentecost into
[11:45] your into your flesh to sit down on the
[11:48] throne of your heart
[11:49] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[11:51] in verse 20 even jesus made a high
[11:53] priest forever
[11:55] after the order of melchizedek
[11:58] and paul will go on at the end of this
[11:59] chapter in verse seven if you could pull
[12:01] that back up there and just just leave
[12:02] that up there as we meditate on these
[12:04] scriptures
[12:06] paul paul paul's making a case
[12:08] that that the law is going to be
[12:10] the covenant is going to be changed and
[12:13] when you change when you change the
[12:14] priesthood the the covenant is going to
[12:16] be changed
[12:18] and so we get into all those things and
[12:19] what those things mean there's going to
[12:21] be a new covenant made a new covenant
[12:24] not not a covenant where you're trying
[12:25] to do something by works but a covenant
[12:27] where god is living in you that his life
[12:31] is living in you and he's going to do it
[12:33] an unconditional covenant that when
[12:35] you've got god sit it down seated on
[12:37] your the throne of your heart he's going
[12:39] to make it he's going to take you to the
[12:40] end
[12:41] regardless of of all the other
[12:44] circumstances regardless of everything
[12:46] else
[12:47] so so let's let's let's do a little bit
[12:49] more background let's just just to think
[12:50] about the setting of melchizedek coming
[12:53] to sit and talk to abraham now you go
[12:55] all the way back to the garden of eden
[12:56] god created a garden
[12:58] where heaven and earth heaven and earth
[13:00] could be one you've got a perfect little
[13:02] situation there and he plays man in the
[13:04] garden so that man and god
[13:06] could work together as one
[13:08] and we'll say
[13:09] almost like adam and eve were like were
[13:11] like priests because they knew they knew
[13:13] what god wanted and they were in harmony
[13:15] with god and everything was working
[13:17] together and evil is the seed if an adam
[13:19] and eve were expelled from the garden
[13:21] but god promised he promised that there
[13:23] was going to be a comet coming a seed
[13:25] that was going to patch things back
[13:27] together that was going to restore that
[13:29] harmony and and all down through the
[13:31] scripture you can see that that promise
[13:33] was of a combination priest and a king a
[13:36] king
[13:37] and a priest that was going to come
[13:40] and so you're looking all that as you
[13:41] read the scripture you're looking for
[13:43] this man that's going to be a priest and
[13:44] a king coming
[13:46] and he's gonna this priest king is gonna
[13:48] restore humanity back to the to the f
[13:50] from their fallen position to where at
[13:52] the back where they're they're priests
[13:54] again
[13:55] and even the bible you got that promise
[13:56] in the bible that you're you're you're
[13:58] you're we're priests and we're kings
[14:00] because he's restoring us back to
[14:02] because we're part of that same body we
[14:04] also
[14:05] have a role to play in that right so
[14:08] after the after the wreckage of the
[14:09] flood god chose a couple he chose a
[14:12] abraham and sarah out of the land of
[14:14] canaan and he promised them he made a
[14:15] promise
[14:16] that it's like a shadow of the new birth
[14:18] he promised them a huge family that that
[14:21] they a and he promised them all these
[14:23] blessings that they had lost in eden he
[14:26] promised them that land he promised him
[14:27] the covenant blessing and abraham didn't
[14:30] see all those promises but one day
[14:32] there's going to be a people that will
[14:33] see the restoration of everything that
[14:35] was promised to abraham and sarah so
[14:37] from from abraham and sarah all these
[14:39] all the blessings of god from this one
[14:41] little group this this one little cup
[14:43] all these blessings
[14:44] would flow out to every nation on earth
[14:47] and you think see how that's a shadow
[14:49] that that promise of the blessing that
[14:50] from one that one little family the
[14:52] blessings of god would flow from every
[14:54] to every nation on earth that's a
[14:57] shadow of how the new birth the promise
[14:59] of the new birth would flow out to every
[15:02] nation on earth and you can see that
[15:04] from from that just that one little
[15:05] event on the day of pentecost the gospel
[15:07] went all around the world and it's
[15:09] flowing like a like a river i'll give
[15:11] you wellsprings of everlasting life and
[15:12] it flows from one person to another all
[15:15] around the world
[15:16] so so now we've got this picture in mind
[15:19] that we're looking for a priest and a
[15:21] king and that priest king shows up
[15:25] there when he walks up to abraham when
[15:27] abraham is returning from the slaughter
[15:28] of the kings
[15:30] how how was a little man with with 318
[15:34] guerilla fighters how are they going to
[15:35] go up against imperial soldiers from
[15:37] like four or five different kingdoms so
[15:40] that's what melchizedek says he says
[15:42] uh i i i'm gonna we're gonna eat bread
[15:44] and wine together and and and we're
[15:46] gonna worship this god that that
[15:48] delivered you
[15:49] your little 318 guerrilla fighters
[15:52] from from all of these all these kings
[15:55] that you were fighting right
[15:56] and so mel abraham met abraham
[15:59] melchizedek passing by passing by this
[16:01] little city named salem and and of
[16:04] course we know that's jerusalem and he
[16:06] meets this figure melchizedek who
[16:07] reminds us of this promised
[16:10] royal
[16:11] royal priest and a king
[16:14] both of these things together
[16:16] isn't that odd
[16:18] so in genesis 14 we'll read it says and
[16:21] the king of sodom went out to meet him
[16:22] after his return from the slaughter of
[16:24] cheddar leomar and of the kings that
[16:26] were with him at the valley of chavez
[16:27] which is the kings dale and melchizedek
[16:30] king of salem brought forth bread and
[16:32] wine and he was the priest of the most
[16:34] high god he brought forth bread and wine
[16:36] now now you know one thing the holy
[16:38] ghost does it connects the dots so i
[16:41] want to connect the dots
[16:42] if i don't i'm not going to get to it
[16:44] today because my time is running out but
[16:47] what we're trying to do is connect the
[16:48] dots between melchizedek coming down and
[16:50] offering bread and wine to abraham
[16:52] connect the dots to the covenant being
[16:54] changed and jesus sitting there in the
[16:56] upper room with that cup that he says
[16:59] this is the cup of the new testament in
[17:01] my blood
[17:03] and he's offering them bread and wine
[17:05] that's that same man that offered offer
[17:08] bread and wine to abraham there and now
[17:10] he's sitting in that upper room offering
[17:12] bread and wine to them as a type that on
[17:14] the day of pentecost they're going to
[17:16] receive that bread and wine they're
[17:18] going to they're going to receive the
[17:19] spirit quickening that word
[17:21] you see what is what is that bread and
[17:23] white bread and wine is communion and so
[17:25] when we come to the house of the lord
[17:26] we're communing with god and when you
[17:28] get in your prayer chamber at home and
[17:30] the word begins to be quicken to you
[17:32] you're in communion with god that's what
[17:34] god wants us to be in a communion with
[17:36] him so we understand him so that we have
[17:38] a relationship with him
[17:40] and he was the priest
[17:42] of the most high god
[17:46] see now it says melchizedek king of
[17:49] salem
[17:50] was the priest of the most high god
[17:52] there you got that king priest
[17:54] a king and a priest together
[17:56] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[17:59] abraham of the most high god
[18:01] possessor of heaven and earth
[18:04] and blessed be the most high god we
[18:06] shall deliver thine enemies into thy
[18:08] hand
[18:09] see abraham knew abraham knew that he
[18:11] couldn't have defeated all those men and
[18:13] you can't defeat whatever your obstacle
[18:15] this is this morning you can't do it of
[18:17] your own power
[18:18] but when god is on your side
[18:23] if your god is on your side
[18:26] that's all that matters
[18:30] and he gave him
[18:31] tithes of all and that's what every one
[18:34] of us
[18:35] when you realize that you're not coming
[18:37] to church just to hear some man then the
[18:39] tithe pagan will be different abraham
[18:41] realized that it wasn't just some man
[18:43] that he was talking to that he was
[18:44] receiving communion with but he was
[18:46] sitting down with a god
[18:48] that logos that came out of the father
[18:50] that manifested that actual the the
[18:52] attribute of the fullness of god was
[18:54] sitting there talking to him
[18:56] and so in verse 7 of hebrews chapter 7
[18:59] of verse 1 of hebrews chapter 7 we get
[19:01] to finally get around to the to the main
[19:03] point is paul's saying for this
[19:05] melchizedek king of salem priest of the
[19:08] most high god who met abraham returning
[19:10] from the slaughter of the kings and
[19:11] blessed him to whom also abraham gave a
[19:14] tenth part of all first being by
[19:16] interpretation king of righteousness
[19:19] and after that also king of salem which
[19:22] is king of peace and brother brown would
[19:24] explain that and who is melchizedek
[19:25] everything coming together just like
[19:27] soul and body and spirit he's the king
[19:29] of everything without father
[19:31] this man didn't have any kind of natural
[19:33] genealogy that you could look at
[19:35] to say your natural genealogy doesn't
[19:37] matter this man takes care of everything
[19:39] without father without mother without
[19:41] descent having neither beginning of days
[19:43] nor end of life but made like unto the
[19:46] son of god abideth the priest
[19:48] continually now consider how great this
[19:51] man was
[19:52] unto whom even the patriarch abraham
[19:55] gave the tenth of the spoils let's
[19:57] consider how great this man was this man
[20:00] was god come down to talk to abraham
[20:02] yes sir and you know brother brahman
[20:04] said and who's this melchizedek that
[20:05] every sin of us every seed of the
[20:07] promise is going to have to go through
[20:09] that same journey every single promise
[20:11] is going to have to meet melchizedek and
[20:13] how are you going to meet melchizedek
[20:14] you met melchizedek when god comes down
[20:17] in flesh and talks to you you meet
[20:18] melchizedek when god comes down and
[20:20] communes with you and you have a
[20:21] personal relationship with you and you
[20:23] see him and recognize him just like
[20:26] abraham did amen
[20:28] you know all down through the scripture
[20:30] they were looking looking for somebody
[20:32] to come that would meet that description
[20:35] of a royal high priest
[20:37] you know abraham there was a lot of good
[20:38] qualities about him but he he didn't he
[20:40] didn't meet up with the he had a lot of
[20:42] mistakes and isaac and brother brown
[20:44] would and a lot of his messages he was
[20:46] bring it on down all the way down to
[20:48] joseph how joseph looked like a perfect
[20:50] man that can could meet the the
[20:53] characteristics of somebody that would
[20:54] be able to open the book and meet the
[20:56] chara the qualifications but then he'd
[20:59] mess up with a few
[21:00] little things in his life that that that
[21:03] didn't quite tally up and and and moses
[21:05] and air and all the way down to to levi
[21:08] you see
[21:09] finally there come somebody that was
[21:12] removed from the genealogy see we get we
[21:15] get so often we look at the genie i'm
[21:17] trying to find
[21:20] you can't you can't qualify your new
[21:23] birth by looking at your natural birth
[21:25] your natural birth has nothing to do
[21:27] with your new birth
[21:29] your natural birth is a thing that you
[21:31] got to overcome and
[21:32] it's like it's like a problem that you
[21:34] it has there's nothing good in your
[21:36] natural birth
[21:38] like paul paul said in titus 3 9 avoid
[21:41] foolish questions and genealogies and
[21:43] contentions and strivings about the law
[21:45] for they are unprofitable in vain
[21:47] there's nothing good in your genealogy
[21:51] that's why
[21:53] that's why he says in verse 3 without
[21:55] father without mother without descent
[21:58] that's why god actually removed
[22:00] a priest was supposed to come from the
[22:02] tribe of levi
[22:03] but he just removed that entirely from
[22:05] the equation and and in in genesis 49
[22:08] the promises somebody that's going to
[22:10] come out of judah judah because but why
[22:13] because god's just flipping everything
[22:15] on its head it looks like
[22:17] i don't care what tribe you come from i
[22:19] don't care what your genealogy is this
[22:21] man is somebody that does not have a
[22:23] genealogy he's without father or mother
[22:26] after the power
[22:28] as paul explained further on this
[22:29] chapter after the power
[22:31] of an endless life
[22:33] the power of an endless life
[22:35] not the power of your natural genealogy
[22:41] i'm trying not to preach up here but you
[22:43] know that's that's a that's a promise it
[22:44] don't matter whether you're a bastard
[22:46] born whether you've got problems in your
[22:47] genealogy whether you go all the way
[22:49] back and you can find somebody that your
[22:51] mama and your daddy wasn't married
[22:53] all all sorts of things polygamy
[22:55] don't look at that because there's some
[22:57] there's a god that was without father or
[23:00] mother that's got the power of an
[23:02] endless life that can come and overcome
[23:04] all of that stuff
[23:05] all of that stuff
[23:07] we placed no confidence in our genealogy
[23:09] or whether we had something in our
[23:10] natural birth because the new birth
[23:13] takes care of all of that stuff
[23:17] and i got two more minutes so we'll
[23:18] we'll just stop on that and the
[23:19] musicians should go ahead and come
[23:21] forward but he said think brother brown
[23:22] said think of this great person of how
[23:25] great this man must be
[23:27] and now the question is who is this man
[23:30] it was a person
[23:32] a man a personality
[23:34] he said an eternal person
[23:37] he was god
[23:38] because he's the only person that can be
[23:41] immortal and now god changing himself
[23:44] into person now see there you get into
[23:46] the godhead
[23:47] that we don't believe in a trinity of
[23:50] three different people but we believe in
[23:52] one god changing his mass in morphy
[23:55] coming down condescending until finally
[23:57] he dwells in your flesh
[23:59] you see that's why brother brown said
[24:01] it's not god one god like your finger
[24:03] not like your finger because god can
[24:06] dwell in the man christ jesus and then
[24:09] he can put that same life and you
[24:12] and me on the day of pentecost he put
[24:14] that life and all the ones that were up
[24:16] there in that upper room
[24:18] god masking himself veiled behind flesh
[24:22] we'll stop right there god bless you
[24:25] [Applause]
