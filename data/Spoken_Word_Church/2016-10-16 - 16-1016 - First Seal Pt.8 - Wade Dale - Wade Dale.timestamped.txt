[3:28] turn to Revelation 6 now we're talking
[3:30] on this first
[3:31] seal last Sunday we were heading toward
[3:34] something and I kind of want to finish
[3:36] it
[3:38] up because the second seal is going to
[3:41] open in the same form listen in the same
[3:45] form but a different
[3:49] scene same form it's going to open the
[3:52] what do they say right here when the
[3:55] lamb open one the seals I heard the
[3:56] noise of Thunder one of the four Beast
[3:58] now this is going to be important when
[4:00] we get to number four and five and
[4:02] six seven
[4:04] I'll one of the four beasts which we
[4:07] know according to the prophet's message
[4:09] was the lion l i o n the lion remember
[4:13] you got lion ox man and Eagle all right
[4:17] so that was the first church age and the
[4:19] lion in that church age went out roaring
[4:22] the message of the hour the pure message
[4:25] that Jesus preached for the three and A2
[4:28] years he was there on Earth the apostles
[4:31] took the part that they could understand
[4:33] cuz remember there's a mystery that they
[4:34] did not understand they didn't
[4:36] understand the complete mystery of the
[4:38] son of man when we get to the seventh
[4:40] seal we we have we are going to have to
[4:42] see the full revelation of the son of
[4:45] man not the Son of God the Son of God
[4:47] remember we we spoke on that we as we as
[4:49] this church believe one thing for sure
[4:52] that God has dispensation God is a
[4:55] dispensationalist there was a time when
[4:57] he told Peter he said I'll build my
[4:59] church on the Son of God Thou Art the
[5:00] Son of God Son of the Living God and
[5:03] Jesus said upon that rock or that
[5:05] Revelation I'll build my church so he
[5:06] built a revelation that Christ the son
[5:10] of God come from God went to God come
[5:13] back down on the day of Pentecost in a
[5:15] form called the Holy Ghost into the
[5:20] Believers right right in in the
[5:24] soul but now you got to see down through
[5:27] time though that there was you take
[5:29] Martin Luther when you come out of the
[5:30] Dark Ages he was smoking the pipe and
[5:32] drinking the beer and we was German we
[5:35] say you think well he was a drunk no
[5:37] listen Germans if you ever been to
[5:38] Germany I've never been but I've got
[5:40] friends that's been to Germany they
[5:41] drink beer like we drank water and Coke
[5:43] and tea okay so it's just a it's
[5:46] something that you don't sit down and go
[5:47] well I want to beer and Martin Luther
[5:49] got drunk we don't make that assumption
[5:51] at all it's just that he didn't see
[5:54] anything wrong with it in the age that
[5:56] he was living in everybody got that all
[5:58] right we don't do that because we know
[6:01] that there's something motivating that
[6:04] and it will take you to something
[6:05] further just like brother brand was
[6:07] talking about television and it's a
[6:09] little it's a little comical that
[6:10] brother Rand watched television and
[6:12] remember during his time they showed no
[6:14] bedroom scen they showed nothing nothing
[6:17] sexual as as of much but what did he see
[6:19] when they went into the bedroom there
[6:21] was um you had Aussie and Harriet which
[6:23] you had Lucy and Ricky in full pajamas
[6:26] sleeping in separate beds well that tell
[6:29] me that's harmless but when a prophet
[6:32] sees it he sees the end result he knew
[6:34] that what was going to happen is once
[6:35] they open that up yeah that the devil's
[6:38] going to come in and say well it's all
[6:39] right to get in the bedroom now so they
[6:40] go and they have the um you know as the
[6:43] stomach turns and all that stuff I mean
[6:45] has a world term and all that other
[6:48] stuff
[6:50] yeah you never heard a call
[6:55] that are in another world and all that
[6:57] other stuff you know all that
[7:00] and then the garbage that we've come up
[7:01] to now that's what innocent television
[7:03] has took us to and brother knew that he
[7:06] knew it would be the little things that
[7:07] would develop into big things so let's
[7:09] cut it off you know
[7:13] right so now we're going to read the
[7:15] first seal comment just a few minutes
[7:17] we're going to read the second seal and
[7:19] then drop back a little bit and I saw
[7:22] when lamb open one of the seals and I
[7:23] heard it was the noise of Thunder one of
[7:25] the four Beast saying come and see right
[7:29] and I saw him beheld a white horse and
[7:31] he that s on him had a bow and a crown
[7:32] was given unto him he went forth
[7:34] conquering and to conquer
[7:37] now this is developing and actually when
[7:40] the crown was given to him is is when is
[7:43] you're going into the next seal cuz
[7:45] remember the first doctrine that went
[7:46] out was a
[7:48] saying right a saying in other words a
[7:52] spirit like the prophet of God said if
[7:54] you read in the seal book he said you
[7:55] cannot Crown
[7:57] Spirit okay Crown has to go on a
[7:59] physical person right so he comes out
[8:03] though he had a bow but no arrows he was
[8:06] a
[8:07] bluff then a crown was given unto him in
[8:10] the latter
[8:11] stages of his
[8:14] ride because you're going to go from
[8:17] sayings to a deed yes
[8:21] Doctrine full manifestation
[8:24] right devil remember he he works in four
[8:27] stages the uh caterpillar
[8:30] Palmer worm caterpillar Locust and all
[8:32] the other I can't remember
[8:33] for but
[8:35] remember then God has to have four to
[8:37] bring it
[8:39] back brother Brown says you know he
[8:42] talks about three and we know it's
[8:44] justification sanctification baptism of
[8:45] the Holy Ghost but then he talks about
[8:47] the word see in this end time it has to
[8:49] be the word fulfillment in a man that's
[8:52] why I said the Son of God Revelation is
[8:55] justification sanctification baptism the
[8:57] Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you're
[8:58] a son and daughter of God you have the
[9:00] Son of God living in your soul right but
[9:03] he wants us but remember he there's a
[9:05] revelation of a son of man yes which is
[9:08] God in human flesh that's right I was
[9:11] listening to last Sundays and you get a
[9:14] little bit of a backlash when you say we
[9:16] got to be incarnate god well I didn't
[9:19] say that he did right okay so go argue
[9:23] with God and go argue with the prophet
[9:25] all right if a son of man's going to be
[9:27] fully revealed and God's going to be so
[9:29] visible Among Us well now he's not going
[9:31] to be visible in a person one person
[9:34] he's going to be visible in his bride so
[9:36] we must be God incarnate because Jesus
[9:39] was God incarnate right he took a body
[9:42] chain no one else has took a body chain
[9:44] in that form you hear what I'm saying in
[9:46] that form except the Bride of Jesus
[9:48] Christ which must be the son of man in
[9:51] the end time which is what God made
[9:53] flesh so it it it sometimes it is hard
[9:56] for people to say well we can't be well
[9:59] I'm just telling you what God said if
[10:01] you can't be that's your business that's
[10:02] your free moral agency but he knows
[10:04] there somebody going to take this full
[10:07] word take it in their heart and not just
[10:10] be Soul the Son of God in your soul but
[10:13] it's going to be the son of man it's
[10:14] going to be Jesus Christ standing on the
[10:15] Earth
[10:16] again just like he was 2,000 years ago
[10:19] only in a many membered body he has
[10:22] imorph from that one son of man mhm to
[10:27] the Bible says many sons that's right
[10:30] right Paul is talking about many sons
[10:33] coming so that's you and I that's us and
[10:36] and obviously it's real obvious that
[10:38] we're the only ones that can take a body
[10:40] chain cu the the the ones that's passed
[10:42] on and deceased cannot that's right
[10:45] without us bringing them now I know that
[10:46] when they come up they're going to get a
[10:47] body chain but we we as the bride have
[10:50] going to have to have enough word to
[10:53] where we stand like Jesus told Lazarus
[10:55] come forth but not be so limited even
[10:58] the prophet of God said there stood you
[11:00] know Jesus Christ in at the tomb of
[11:02] Lazarus and said if he would have called
[11:04] everybody's name they'd all come forth
[11:06] what a power what a power but he said
[11:10] Lazarus come forth so that called
[11:12] Lazarus
[11:13] name and I believe you and I will call
[11:16] all the dead saints name not Luther and
[11:18] Wesley and all the ones cuz we don't
[11:19] know those people right Luther had
[11:21] probably say he had a million converts I
[11:23] don't know one of them name personally
[11:26] but the word does cuz that's where they
[11:28] got their birth from so if we become the
[11:30] word Jesus was a word made flesh he knew
[11:32] all of his children I believe he knew
[11:35] who they were right
[11:37] okay what a father that wouldn't know
[11:39] who his kids are right okay and know
[11:43] where they are that's right okay
[11:46] so let's continue on so now and a crown
[11:49] was given unto him so now he comes and
[11:52] he's Crown whatever this Doctrine is who
[11:55] crowns
[11:57] him we do God doesn't crown
[12:00] him we do now I say we the denom I don't
[12:04] say denominational world let's just say
[12:06] that the the uh world that has cabbaged
[12:10] down on certain doctrines they crown him
[12:13] and give him his power okay um sitting
[12:17] in the temple of God showing himself to
[12:18] be as God he doesn't just brother K he's
[12:20] not just able to just go do that he has
[12:23] to be allowed to do it and as he is
[12:25] allowed to do it it's allowed through me
[12:26] and you that's true and I say me and you
[12:29] in our spirit realm and our flesh realm
[12:31] not in our soul that's why if you're
[12:34] born again you're in rapturing condition
[12:36] your soul as Eternal as God is you're
[12:38] going to take a a Rapture you're going
[12:41] to take a body change you're going to
[12:42] take a
[12:43] Rapture but somebody's got to stand here
[12:46] and and and be the we which are alive
[12:48] and
[12:50] remain and I don't believe that's I
[12:52] believe it's physically alive but I
[12:53] believe it's alive in Christ you got to
[12:56] be alive in Christ cuz they're dead in
[12:57] Christ okay
[13:00] yes you got to read that you got to read
[13:01] it and you got to read you read the
[13:03] Bible in different levels that's true
[13:05] you got to read it in different levels
[13:07] cuz you can you can look at this and you
[13:08] can read it in one level and say well
[13:10] that's like brother Brown did that white
[13:12] horse is looks like a white righteous
[13:14] church and he had a bow and he went
[13:15] conquering and he had a crown man that
[13:16] looks like
[13:17] Jesus no it's
[13:21] not the Antichrist but remember the in
[13:24] between in between the lines we have to
[13:28] see okay one true and living God and we
[13:31] have to see this person destroyed yes
[13:34] right
[13:35] here that he's the devil we got to see
[13:39] him
[13:40] destroyed in that level to move up to
[13:44] the next
[13:45] level you understand what I'm talk if
[13:47] you don't I'm going to explain it to you
[13:48] in just a second because what's got to
[13:50] happen look behind me I added something
[13:52] brother R said the seventh SE this is
[13:54] coming
[13:57] right now we know that that's going to
[13:59] culminate in a physical coming right but
[14:02] he's got to come in the bride
[14:04] first before the physical coming so what
[14:07] is this seventh seal is his coming on
[14:09] Earth in a bride I'm sorry in Bride
[14:13] form okay cuz remember we're
[14:17] not Eve was literally Adam in another
[14:21] body that's right and that was Adam's
[14:23] Body that she was
[14:25] in hello yeah that's right can say Jun
[14:29] and I can say she's bone my bone flesh
[14:31] and my flesh all you want
[14:33] to not in the physical
[14:36] form but Adam could literally look at
[14:39] Eve and say that come from me that's my
[14:42] body yes made manifest in another form
[14:45] that's what we got to see we see a
[14:48] separation God just saw an expanding or
[14:50] more of him to be
[14:53] revealed okay even messed up she should
[14:56] have been the bride The Perfect Bride
[14:59] right but God to have that kind of bride
[15:02] you're going to have to have a perfect
[15:04] bride same way with this that's what I'm
[15:06] saying this is a carbon
[15:08] copy this is a negative picture of a
[15:12] positive that's already there okay
[15:15] everybody got that one more time this is
[15:16] a negative
[15:18] picture cuz this is the Antichrist and
[15:21] what he's doing so you must have Jesus
[15:24] Christ on the scene doing his work
[15:28] before any of this can come to pass and
[15:31] it only comes to pass in our free moral
[15:32] agency is what we let him do and what we
[15:34] let him not do right correct and I saw
[15:38] and behold a white horse and he s him
[15:39] had a bow and the crown was given unto
[15:41] him went forth conquering and to conquer
[15:44] and then remember last Sunday I'm going
[15:46] to read it we're going to read that
[15:47] quote
[15:49] again a that beautiful little baby right
[15:53] there we're going to read the quote that
[15:56] we we read that white horse has been in
[15:59] the land all the
[16:01] time this is the second seal he didn't
[16:04] just develop no he was made known when
[16:07] the seals open been riding the whole
[16:10] time when Michael and and Satan fought
[16:14] in heaven that's when Satan came down
[16:18] and started riding cuz remember he has
[16:20] no power in heaven
[16:23] anymore he had power he had power
[16:26] remember but he took a third or whatever
[16:28] you want want to say of the Angel and he
[16:30] brought them down here brother said they
[16:32] came here to influence you and me cuz
[16:37] look Satan's not an idiot right he knows
[16:41] that God is using human beings to get
[16:43] his work done that's right why do you
[16:45] think Satan went right to the human race
[16:47] to get his work done but since he
[16:49] couldn't create he had to take from the
[16:51] animal
[16:52] race one that could compare with the
[16:55] human race and inject itself into of the
[16:59] human race to cause us to have a carnal
[17:02] mind the carnal mind is enmity and then
[17:05] you take Genesis 3:15 he said I'll put
[17:07] enity Satan didn't put enity between God
[17:09] and man God put enity between God and
[17:11] man a division like I told you last
[17:14] Sunday before I believe that Adam spoke
[17:17] to God just like me and Lis are talking
[17:20] to each
[17:21] other and then when that happened God
[17:23] had to withdraw himself he could why
[17:27] they were Sinners right even though Adam
[17:29] was a Son of God he had sin in his life
[17:32] that he now couldn't get rid of because
[17:34] remember he's the one that committed
[17:35] iniquity not Eve he thought she was
[17:37] doing right Adam knew what he was doing
[17:40] that's
[17:41] right I've always said Adam had a had a
[17:44] hard time after the fall yeah it's like
[17:48] having superpowers and then having
[17:49] superpowers taken away from you yeah you
[17:52] know he used to could move the trees and
[17:54] stop the wind and all that stuff well I
[17:56] believe when all that happened when they
[17:57] were driven out of the garden of Eden
[17:59] that a lot of that was taken away from
[18:01] him now I don't believe he lost the mind
[18:03] of God cuz he had he had the Holy Ghost
[18:05] Inside of him he had the teacher why do
[18:08] you think Hey listen there was Adam and
[18:10] Eve the Beast was gone so you had Adam
[18:13] and Eve and Cain and Abel and Seth and
[18:17] then Cain killed Abel so he only had
[18:19] Cain and Seth and then all the other
[18:21] there was nobody else there who was
[18:22] their
[18:23] Doctor Who was the one that was a
[18:25] mediator who was the one that that
[18:27] developed using and building and all
[18:28] that stuff it was all the different ones
[18:30] that come from Adam and I believe Adam
[18:31] was the teacher cuz you see God didn't
[18:34] just withdraw himself and leave and go
[18:36] off and say well go fend for yourself
[18:37] like Daddy's always said no no Daddy not
[18:42] told you that God never left him it's
[18:43] just that he couldn't have a personal
[18:45] relationship like he used to why do you
[18:47] think he's longing to get back to us cuz
[18:50] he lost that Fellowship you said no that
[18:53] can't listen the blood of bulls and
[18:55] goats could only cover sin
[18:59] it couldn't eradicate sin so God could
[19:01] come down into a human flesh and talk to
[19:05] um
[19:06] Abraham but he had to go back that's
[19:08] right he' come down and let Moses see
[19:10] the back part of a man but he had to go
[19:12] back he couldn't he couldn't reside with
[19:14] man the way he wants to now right but as
[19:19] he came in human flesh he came through a
[19:21] flesh that he
[19:23] created to me the Plan of Redemption is
[19:25] so simple so simple if we fail in human
[19:30] flesh God's got to come down in human
[19:32] flesh to redeem
[19:34] that got
[19:36] to and then what does he do he takes
[19:39] that human flesh puts it at Calvary
[19:41] kills it puts it in a
[19:45] grave this is our this is our sacrifice
[19:48] this part of Jesus was our sacrifice but
[19:50] his soul he took to hell for a ransom
[19:53] all right to me that's very simple and
[19:56] then that soul that paid the ransom came
[19:57] back on the day of P cost and ran them
[20:00] 120 yes then
[20:02] 3,000 then
[20:04] Millions okay but the body has yet to be
[20:07] redeemed that's right why because we've
[20:10] not had enough word this has all been so
[20:12] sealed up till we've had what we've had
[20:16] well when brother rown was alive there
[20:18] was 969 different denominations now
[20:20] there's 13,000 and some OD different
[20:22] denomination
[20:24] 13,000 different ideas on one man that's
[20:28] right that's not including Buddha and
[20:30] Muhammad and and like brother um prash
[20:35] said there millions of gods and
[20:36] goddesses in India that ain't even got
[20:39] nothing to do with God
[20:42] right so what a mess we've got ourself
[20:44] into in just 2,000 years right 2,000
[20:47] years we got oursel in a mess right but
[20:51] it's coming back that what that was the
[20:53] prophet of God's message was to bring it
[20:55] and restore it right back to the Garden
[20:57] of Eden that's right right his message
[20:59] takes us right Back to the Future home
[21:01] which is the Garden of Eden condition
[21:03] that Adam and Eve were in before the
[21:06] fall amen so that's what we're heading
[21:09] back to but we got to see these White
[21:11] Horse this White Horse then we got to
[21:12] see the red and the black and the pale
[21:15] we must see these to identify what they
[21:18] are all right we've got to identify them
[21:20] now we identified the first one is a
[21:23] saying some little something you know
[21:24] somebody come in and preach a little
[21:26] something and and it don't get correct
[21:28] and that's kind of what happened down in
[21:30] these
[21:31] ages the apostles we we were talking
[21:33] about sthus sthus had this
[21:37] idea idea that Jesus wasn't God cuz
[21:41] remember you got to remember the first
[21:43] three ages they had no written
[21:44] documentation they had no
[21:48] Bible they had no Bible the Bible was
[21:51] written during this time but it never
[21:53] was printed until the time of the man
[21:55] Lon ox man an eagle man the man age
[21:59] the Bible's only been in print since
[22:01] what
[22:02] 1500 wasn't it like 1500 so it's only
[22:05] been what 600 years
[22:09] maybe that that we've had a printed
[22:12] Bible so it had to be that these
[22:15] Brethren were so strong in the faith
[22:16] they're preaching you had to listen you
[22:18] couldn't stay out of church and go back
[22:20] and listen to their
[22:25] tap sit with your slippers on it
[22:30] listen to the T but we can now
[22:33] yes but so they had to depend on what
[22:36] they heard you know what I'm saying so
[22:38] then somebody like sthus Satan can get
[22:41] on his
[22:42] horse ride into a man that just had a
[22:45] thought now listen it's just a
[22:48] thought but serenus starts bringing that
[22:51] thought and developing it
[22:55] right and then he starts what said it's
[22:59] got to be a thought first remember God
[23:00] does the same thing got to be a thought
[23:03] then a thought is what when it's spoken
[23:04] it's a thought expressed right so Satan
[23:07] throws that little thought how many
[23:08] thoughts has he throw in your brain in
[23:09] the past few
[23:13] days but you have something to fight it
[23:15] with corinthus didn't have anything to
[23:18] fight it with that we know of he
[23:20] couldn't have been he couldn't have been
[23:21] a holy ghost filled man but what he was
[23:22] he was spiritual he was
[23:24] religious right but irenius the prophet
[23:28] of the AG the one that had the holy
[23:29] ghost caught what he was saying and said
[23:32] get away from that it's worthless get
[23:35] away from it right that's what these
[23:37] seals do these seals show you to me they
[23:40] show Christ already here doing a work in
[23:44] somebody it ain't going to be a whole
[23:46] bunch this is where the whole bunch is
[23:49] going to be is is get caught up in this
[23:51] right the whole bunch is you know 99% of
[23:54] the people in the world is going to get
[23:55] caught up in these doctrines
[23:59] look at your me look at the message
[24:00] people they're getting caught up in
[24:02] these doctrines right and left or
[24:04] leaving the message now who is that is
[24:05] that God no that's that white horse
[24:08] rider that's now manifesting
[24:11] himself as a as a saying but what they
[24:14] do as as that developed in sthus it
[24:17] became a Doctrine yes something he
[24:20] practiced which is a deed it became a
[24:22] deed he practiced it I'm sure he
[24:24] probably asked different commentary oh
[24:26] that sounds good you know he no sthus on
[24:29] the back you that's what the devil does
[24:30] he gets three or four people together
[24:31] get them Pat them on their back and uh
[24:33] gets feeling good W I felt that you know
[24:37] I feel that it must be right no you
[24:40] either just got cold or the devil blowed
[24:42] on your neck one of the two that's about
[24:48] crazy Jesus didn't never have to have an
[24:51] emotion to prove who he
[24:53] was right he never needed an emotion to
[24:57] prove who he was
[24:58] you never saw Jesus dancing the only
[25:00] time I believe he ever run was in the
[25:02] temple when he was beating them people
[25:03] out with r the only time he ever run is
[25:07] when he was running people out of the
[25:08] temple right all right so and I believe
[25:11] in all
[25:13] that but I don't believe you got to I
[25:15] believe you don't build and base your
[25:19] experience on that right okay because
[25:22] look this white horse rider is still
[25:23] here right he's riding in a white
[25:25] righteous church but now to you and I
[25:28] here's my point to you and I we must see
[25:31] and then we'll I'm going to read the
[25:32] second seal and we'll drop
[25:34] back we have to see all these
[25:39] changes first he's a devil to begin with
[25:41] the spirit of the devil then he become
[25:43] the false prophet went into
[25:46] the started preaching his Doctrine
[25:49] through um and that just happen doesn't
[25:52] have to be one false prophet right okay
[25:57] because what happened was if it if it
[25:59] was just one pope then he couldn't get
[26:01] anybody else to see it but that false
[26:04] prophet got in a lot of
[26:07] people got in a bunch of
[26:09] people that's what I've always said if
[26:11] you can get a bunch of people to agree
[26:13] with you you got to think you're right
[26:14] exactly right ain't that right but when
[26:17] you got one thought and 50 people say no
[26:20] that ain't it it makes you wonder a
[26:22] little bit but when you bring it right
[26:24] back to the word like with the Daniel 7
[26:25] we you know we kind of stand alone on
[26:27] that and all the other preachers kind of
[26:29] stand against it but hey I really don't
[26:31] care because I can prove it in the Bible
[26:33] and prove it by the prophet's message
[26:34] all right so I don't have to worry about
[26:36] it there you can stand as one Jesus
[26:39] stood by himself he stood alone right so
[26:42] we're going to stand alone in the end
[26:43] time we're not going to be real popular
[26:45] that's I promise you that that's okay
[26:47] became a false prophet teacher of a
[26:50] false Doctrine see if a false doct just
[26:52] goes out among people in the spirit it
[26:54] really it's looking for something to
[26:56] land on is what it's looking for to take
[26:59] root in sorry to take root in yes that's
[27:02] right and that's what this ISS cuz when
[27:04] it goes in and people starts breaking it
[27:06] down and teaching it see then it becomes
[27:09] a Doctrine that's right and that person
[27:11] becomes that Doctrine and then you
[27:12] become that Doctrine if you accept it
[27:14] that's why you have to watch false
[27:15] teaching because it's seed planting
[27:18] plant a little seed here a little seed
[27:20] here well if you let that seed grow and
[27:21] don't pluck it up like Jesus said you
[27:24] got to pluck it up by the roots and
[27:25] throw it away you can't just trim it
[27:27] right
[27:29] that's what we do in the message a lot
[27:30] of times we trim what brother Bram says
[27:32] you know we trim what the Bible says and
[27:34] we keep that same old root well you you
[27:36] throw that thing out that's right and I
[27:38] believe that's what this is this this
[27:40] seal this seals to me is a final
[27:43] cleaning out of your whole body spirit
[27:46] and
[27:47] soul body spirit and
[27:49] soul your Soul's clean that's right but
[27:53] your body is nothing really that's right
[27:56] so it's your spirit that where all these
[27:57] reside
[27:59] right you don't have faith in your body
[28:02] no right cuz your body is really
[28:05] contrary to any kind of Faith that's
[28:07] right you don't have virtue knowledge
[28:08] look all these all these have to work
[28:10] out through your in your uh spirit
[28:13] realm I've always said that's our
[28:15] biggest trouble it's not our body right
[28:17] not our soul if you're born again that's
[28:19] right it's in that Spirit realm that's
[28:22] right amen cuz Satan's got his five
[28:24] fingers coming down through it and God's
[28:27] got his five fingers coming up out of
[28:28] the St and they meet and that's the
[28:30] greatest battle ever fought my brother
[28:32] preach the greatest battle ever fought
[28:34] it was not in your
[28:36] brain brain matter
[28:39] brain it's in your brain but it's not
[28:43] your brain
[28:44] that's cuz your brain's nothing but what
[28:46] goes this way and this way what you let
[28:48] in like we were talking the other day
[28:51] when brother Brandon would he knew that
[28:53] epileptic devil would go through your
[28:55] eyes cuz remember the eyes is the
[28:57] Gateway in the soul he told them he said
[28:59] close your eyes and bow your head and
[29:01] God forbid if you open your eyes cuz
[29:03] when this demon leaves he's going to
[29:05] find a place to go where's the first
[29:07] place when you look
[29:11] up this is the gateway to the soul I
[29:14] wish I could get rid of the things I see
[29:17] yeah or saw right I don't know if y'all
[29:20] that way but I am I wished I could get R
[29:23] I asked God the other day I said God
[29:25] please erase that from my brain but at
[29:27] the moment he can't because that's the
[29:29] part of the sin curse that that stays in
[29:32] there cuz I saw it with my natural
[29:34] eyeballs you understand what I'm
[29:37] saying but still through those same set
[29:40] of eyeballs and through that same brain
[29:43] God's got to
[29:44] work that's right what I
[29:46] see but remember what you see physically
[29:50] see can be
[29:53] false yes it can be twisted but what you
[29:57] see in in your soul what you understand
[29:59] from the
[30:01] heart Satan can't take that away from
[30:03] you because what's inside of you that
[30:04] teacher which is doing what is casting
[30:06] out all these
[30:08] things on a daily basis it should be
[30:11] casting out the thing you see why this
[30:14] first seal is so important to me the
[30:15] first seal is the most important seal
[30:17] cuz if you don't see one true and living
[30:19] God and that God is either working in
[30:21] your life or
[30:22] not and for those of you that don't have
[30:25] the Holy Ghost he's not working as he
[30:28] should amen you need to let him in so he
[30:31] can work that's right all
[30:34] right ask him
[30:37] to ask him to come in and do and see we
[30:39] try to fight her own battle that's the
[30:41] problem we try to figure things out let
[30:43] him come in he's the
[30:46] teacher
[30:49] yes but this guy's still riding he gets
[30:52] off of one horse well that power that
[30:55] horse continues to ride he's still here
[30:57] now
[30:59] now I mean you can't get you can't get
[31:03] to people that are in the denomination
[31:05] the world you can't get them to see that
[31:07] they're wrong everything's okay to them
[31:10] you know so Satan has so ingrained that
[31:12] into them till they're just brother
[31:15] Brown said they're false people in a
[31:17] false system that's right okay but they
[31:21] can be anointed by the true Holy Ghost
[31:23] that's right thinking that it's in their
[31:26] soul but it's just on their Spirit see
[31:28] where that Spirit realm is so tricky
[31:31] that's right boy I mean real tricky
[31:33] memory reason oh boy conscious
[31:38] affection and
[31:40] Imagination boy you can just imagine
[31:42] that yeah
[31:46] yeah pretty rough isn't it but when we
[31:49] see this seal come down we see one true
[31:51] and living God and we see that there's a
[31:53] separation like we said last week there
[31:56] was twins come down and every in every
[31:58] work of God that was twins God came on
[32:01] the earth Satan right came on the Earth
[32:04] right God come down with signs and
[32:06] wonders in the end time through brother
[32:07] Ram the prophet of God in the first part
[32:10] of his ministry Satan comes right down
[32:12] with impersonating right right that's
[32:15] what brother was talking about the three
[32:16] pulls cuz cuz what did what did the
[32:19] angel tell him first pull can be
[32:22] imitated right all right second pull can
[32:26] be imitated
[32:29] third pole can't be imitated why can a
[32:31] third pole not be imitated third pole is
[32:34] the revealing of the word of God Satan
[32:36] cannot get a revelation of the word of
[32:38] God if he did he'd know that he was
[32:39] false and he could be saved that's right
[32:42] that's right cuz that's what our we did
[32:44] right we opened the word of God we found
[32:45] out we were lost and God could save
[32:48] us we laugh but and we shouldn't but
[32:51] still it's so everything we think is the
[32:55] devil so way out you under you know he's
[32:57] in the bars and the prostitutes and the
[33:00] this no he never wanted to be there but
[33:04] because of what he done he's a destroyer
[33:06] everything he touches turns against God
[33:08] so everything he tries to do turns
[33:10] against God but he's coming he's right
[33:11] here riding trying to get this church he
[33:15] knows I'm not saying just lul church
[33:17] this church Church of the Living God
[33:18] he's trying to get her to go in his
[33:21] Direction and he knows if he can do that
[33:24] then he can defeat God he cannot defeat
[33:26] God Head to Head that's right
[33:29] but he thinks if he gets enough you know
[33:31] if he
[33:32] gets you think if he was standing there
[33:34] with Goliath that day he' know that
[33:36] there was you know he ain't got he ain't
[33:38] got a leg to stand on but anyway but
[33:41] he's a deceiver so I believe he's
[33:43] deceived and being in deception he's
[33:45] deceived and he's also deceiving other
[33:47] people deceiving and he deceives us yes
[33:51] mhm how many times you thought you right
[33:53] and you wrong how many times you don't
[33:55] have to raise your hand cuz I know you
[33:56] all will
[33:59] but let's look at this real quick then
[34:00] we'll read the second seal the first
[34:02] seal was you see all these symbols but
[34:04] now what's got to
[34:07] happen now let me make two points number
[34:11] one is the seal has an
[34:14] opening and it has an
[34:16] ending because Satan gets off of this
[34:19] horse and he goes over and he completely
[34:21] gets on something not different as far
[34:24] as we say totally different it's just a
[34:26] little more deceptive
[34:30] okay red horse oh I know it was the
[34:34] blood I know see so Satan gets over and
[34:37] he gets in the same thing see what I'm
[34:38] talking about but the first seal doesn't
[34:40] end as far as being destroyed except in
[34:44] one group of people
[34:46] right we've got to see that first seal
[34:49] destroyed in Me and You by
[34:55] what by he's coming
[34:58] the only way that this can be destroyed
[35:00] is he comes in you gives you a
[35:03] revelation of that seal and that white
[35:06] horse rider has to
[35:08] leave the
[35:10] scene but Satan's not done he brings
[35:13] another
[35:14] one
[35:16] see this white horse rider rides all the
[35:19] way to the end right right but not in me
[35:22] and you if we get a revelation it ends
[35:27] at the revelation of Jesus Christ I
[35:29] think that's what the Bible says at the
[35:31] revelation of Jesus Christ all these
[35:33] things what his coming is the revealing
[35:36] it's revealing what's going on right
[35:38] right so as the first seal ends to the
[35:41] believer to the True Believer the true
[35:42] one with the Holy Ghost that believes
[35:45] and and takes it in and studies
[35:47] it his coming ends that first
[35:52] seal but now if you're not sealed in if
[35:55] you're not born again and receiving the
[35:57] message of the the hour he just
[35:58] continues to ride right
[36:01] on okay everybody got that yes so you
[36:05] got to see his coming not his physical
[36:07] coming because remember the coming of
[36:09] the Lord is revealing of his word what's
[36:11] the third pull revealing of his word
[36:13] everything at the culmination of this is
[36:15] the revealing of the word amen that's
[36:17] right right all right that's where you
[36:18] get you four because see brother Brown's
[36:20] going to as he goes through this he's
[36:22] going to notice that there's four horse
[36:25] riders right right now he does doesn't
[36:27] have that Revelation yet I'll prove it
[36:30] to you
[36:31] later but he says first stage devil
[36:34] Spirit false prophet next the very Devil
[36:38] Himself he's got three if you watch
[36:40] later on he develops and brings in four
[36:42] because if you got four horse riders you
[36:44] got to bring in four things to combat
[36:47] that okay so you see he developed and
[36:51] and like I said before even on the
[36:52] second seal he said totally contrary to
[36:56] what I was thinking he was looking it
[36:57] over again it wasn't just the first seal
[36:59] every day he came up with something that
[37:02] was different than what he had had saw
[37:04] before all right that's why he knew he
[37:06] was working in a realm then that was
[37:08] exact Perfection perfect work was being
[37:12] was being made known right there not
[37:14] that it wasn't before but there was some
[37:16] flaws in it just like the first seal
[37:18] thinking that the white horse rider was
[37:20] the Holy Ghost well that's what Satan
[37:22] wants he wants to be revealed as the
[37:24] Holy Ghost God had to reveal it back to
[37:26] the prophet and walk in that room and
[37:29] say no no no that that's not
[37:32] me that's the
[37:34] Antichrist and oh my see then then then
[37:36] scripture started to opening up to
[37:37] brother brown maybe that he hadn't seen
[37:39] before that's why he worked in the realm
[37:41] but what happened was he came on the
[37:43] scene at the end of that seal and
[37:46] revealed himself to brother
[37:48] Brown so that he could preach this to me
[37:52] and you so that God could come and do
[37:54] the same thing okay so at the end of
[37:56] every
[37:58] there is a coming of the Lord to you to
[38:01] reveal to
[38:02] you something more about God same thing
[38:08] you got the Devil he's going to still be
[38:09] there okay but he's going to he's so
[38:12] deceptive he's going to turn and get off
[38:14] of that horse and he's going to get on
[38:16] another one all right so let's read
[38:19] that Revelation 6
[38:28] verse
[38:29] two when he had opened the second seal I
[38:32] heard the second beast say come and see
[38:34] now who's the second
[38:35] beast Ox see your first Beast was in the
[38:39] first three ages lion
[38:42] ox
[38:44] man and at the end the eagle have I got
[38:48] that you should know that it's just
[38:50] simple teaching that's been taught for
[38:52] years and years and years first three
[38:53] Church ages the lion the lion of the
[38:56] tribe of Judah roaring out out the
[38:57] message of the hour in these first three
[39:00] ages not a lot of false Doctrine but
[39:03] when you come to the end of this church
[39:04] age right here going into that the Dark
[39:07] Ages this is when the Catholics ruled
[39:10] right right that was the O labor all
[39:13] they had to do was say I believe in
[39:14] Jesus Christ and they were killed but

[39:39] time God communicated wirelessly to
[39:42] people for a long time he's never had to
[39:43] be
[39:44] connected right to a phone line or any
[39:47] kind of line he's but I was thinking
[39:49] this morning I thought well you know the
[39:52] the animals have been connected to GPS
[39:55] forever how can a duck fly to
[39:59] Canada in the spring have her babies
[40:03] them babies hatch grow to about three or
[40:06] four five months old turn around and
[40:08] never been to Georgia or
[40:11] Louisiana except in their
[40:14] mother how are they going to know to fly
[40:16] straight right down to the same ground
[40:19] salmon go back to the same spawning
[40:22] ground every year how they know that
[40:26] God's positioning system
[40:28] that's
[40:32] right Google Google is old hat to God
[40:36] yeah that's
[40:38] right and how does he Lead You by a
[40:41] wire no no he leads you by an in
[40:45] dwelling but what we hear from God Amen

[41:06] color that's another horse that white
[41:09] horse rider that white righteous church
[41:11] is still riding still riding
[41:12] today and it's making people believe the
[41:15] lie of the devil father son Holy Ghost
[41:17] all the baptism see and and there went
[41:20] out another horse that was red brother R
[41:22] said in the seal book he gets off one
[41:24] and gets on another
[41:27] he doesn't just keep riding and that one
[41:28] turns from white to red right that one
[41:31] got to keep going cuz this already got
[41:33] power people are giving it the power and
[41:36] there went out another horse that was
[41:38] red and power was given same thing power
[41:42] was given to him that sat their own to
[41:44] take peace from the earth and they
[41:45] should kill one another and there was
[41:47] given unto him a great sword everybody
[41:50] got that yes now you got to remember

[42:09] still you have to build one upon the
[42:13] other got it that's right it's got to
[42:16] build one on top of the other all
[42:19] right the people that were influenced
[42:22] under the white hor they're the ones
[42:24] that come under the influence of the
[42:27] that's correct that's
[42:30] correct that's correct as Satan goes
[42:32] higher but remember God's got to go
[42:36] higher and the blood of Jesus Christ is
[42:39] what we need to talk about first then
