collinses let her do that I know you've already prayed for Sister Sarah to be the operation tomorrow afternoon so we pray that the Lord would take care of that all right I think that's all of the announcements You' like turning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 and we will try to go into have we missed anything okay Revelations one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel to his unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you in peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from remember there's not seven different Spirits it's the holy spirit in manifesting through seven Church ages and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed our us from our sins in his own blood and ha made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and never I shall see him they also which pierced him all that pierced all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayth the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty and I John also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto samna and unto pergamus and unto Tara and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto lady oia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and be in turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to his foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as of a flame of fire and his feet like undefined Bry as if they burn in a furnace and his voice as a sound of many Waters remember waters are people right and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as where the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he said he laid his hand right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first in the LI I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death we'll stop right there Lord Jesus we ask you to just bless us as we lord try to read your word and talk about you and we ask you that you'd come on the scene now speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your grace and love in Jesus name amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we be going through this is the reason I read over to this part uh we we'll be picking up this and bringing a few messages and and trying to connect it together you know because we've you remember how we're trying to do we're trying to start on paral realization and C cover Through the message out into perfect realization uh to understand where it is and trying to see our day and its hour now I've always told you if you want to find yourself we can't read in this part or that part you can say well this pertains to me that's fine but if you want to find yourself just read the book of Revelations the very book that we were told to stay out of is the very book that will carry us to the place if we'll read it and you'll see that the point I've tried to make to you for many many years probably 40 is one thing you don't see Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelations by himself he's always being revealed in another form another way or with the people or whatever you don't see him by himself you see him there uh speaking through the to the bride and even to the foolish virgins uh the Jews you find all of those things but you never find him by yourself that's an amazing thing to think of all of the things of the Bible that would turn out to be is the book they told us not to read you know the Book of Revelations and he said we couldn't understand it we see they were trying their best to keep us from reading it all right well when the prophet came and brought the message then you know you know now we can read it and understand what it's talking about and we can find ourselves remember that's what we're trying to do because the prophet you know he said it like this he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for she would be an invincible Army nothing can stand in her way a Rapture will come right why because the bride will realize who she is and that's the way that I've tried to preach it that that Martin Luther realized that just shall live by faith and it became a reality Hallelujah and it converted the world all right you know because it was the word of the hour well each ages had the word of their day and their hour like in the church ages The Seven Ages and it's each one name coming down and each one has a part all right see but then in the end time we're to come down to the end of it all all right like we we covered you know the partial to the perfect we talked about the uh the the grain of wheat as as being the one that went into the ground and would be restored in the last days and it doesn't make it us any different because the age we're in it doesn't make us special it makes him special all right cuz he's in the midst of the seven golden and candlesticks which means he's just as much in one as in as he in is in the other now he might not be able to manifest himself but that doesn't have anything to do with it because he's there doing doing it in in the day all right then as we brought it up from the grain of wheat that went into the ground is to come back to the original grain again in the end time before Rapture could come amen all right then we went through the uh talking about the the new birth and or bringing us to a a birth and bringing us to the Sons and Daughters of a living God and and then brought it down and tried to cover the things the prophet said about the bride and how that she would be the fullness of the godhead bodily am all right now remember you leave Luther out of it it's not the fullness right you leave Wesley out of it you leave isusa street right you leave any age out and you're not in fullness amen all right the fullness of the godhead bodily would be the entire bride right all right now as that would be being brought out see it would be coming further and further over to show it as the bride in the end time yes because the bride in the end time is to make that manifest right just like John you know was chosen to go to patmas right and going to patmas to write the Book of Revelations to bring it unto us then he was also chosen or taken up all right being one man he represented the entire bride amen all right so now that's what we're trying to get to showing the grain of wheat you know it's not going to be no good you can't go out when you say we're in the wheat we're we're back to the original so we don't need anything else underneath us you go cut your wheat down at that stage and when it's green and or your corn or whatever you want to you got to leave it and it's got its purpose until the time comes that it can return to the original grain that could be planted into the ground we never raised much wheat in our life but we raised a lot of corn and that corn was left on the stalk even though we would cut the the top off of it and the silk things part you know getting it down we' we do all of it but yet it stayed there remained in the field until it was time to gather it because if you went out and gathered it too quick put it in the barn it's going to mold M you right so you got to wait see we talk about a harvest well you don't put the the combine in to harvest green wheat right it's got to be dried ready another words plantable wheat right plantable corn all right see because you don't you go out there and you go to town you buy you a goodie or corn you take it home you boil it you say man that's good that's good it is but you can't plant it wrong stage wrong part now what did we cover then in the last part talking about dispensations all right but brother brandom says I'm a dispensationalist he said God's a dispensationalist all right and then he turns around and other messages and he said I'm not much on being a dispensationalist well as I told you you won't find the word dispensationalist in Webster's Dictionary you might find it on this modern day stuff because it's not there but the point I believe he's getting at is what it means by dispensations that's why he would say he believed in a dispensation but then say he didn't believe in dispensation that's right all now you take the word dispensation and it'll turn out to be stewardship right and stuff like that all right now that would not be what you would want to bring in into view as to understanding the corn of wheat or those things or the fullness of the godhead bodily Etc you you wouldn't get the right understanding even though you would be right in the stewardship the great that's wonderful but if you're dealing with dispensation just as stewardship see it wouldn't come out but if you're dealing with dispensations as manifestations or as times it doesn't say the dispensation of the Gentile it says the when the fullness of the Gentiles has come all right see then the prophet said see there's a dispensation of the Gentiles all right see then that way we we come to that place to to have an understanding of even like something that would look contrary from here to there you know and and doing those things then if you'll give a little time it'll come together and make a beautiful picture because he was a prophet you know and God was using him to bring the message all right so then the dispensations you know he came in three as we were last covered in the last message he came in three sons names Son of God Son of Man son of David all right and then in doing that then we can see that you pull a put a dispensation with each part of it you know and it'll come out to right because like there's a dispensation of the Old Testament there's a dispensation of the New Testament all right there's a time of the Old Testament a time of the New Testament all right see then he was on Earth he was son of man he never declared himself to be the Son of God but yet that's who he was right you know he was born that all right but he didn't declare it in public announcement of himself because he was manifesting or in the dispensation or time of the son of man which was the prophet all right son of man then we covered over how in that like I ask you to read the intervail or excuse me the unveil that's a good one too intervail but all of them is good but I ask you to read the unveiling of God and and the Mighty God unveiled and and to study that and listen listen to what the prophet had to say and he said he came as son of man and they crucified him all right cuz see you couldn't kill Son of God all right and we know for sure You' never tried to in any way kill the son of David because he's going to be ruler over there and there's no death to the son of David amen there's death to the son of man there's rejection to the Son of God right but there you don't have anything whatsoever when you come to son of David you don't have rejections you don't have now sure Israel turned him down but he wasn't coming to them as son of David you remember th son of David well he he wouldn't even right he wouldn't talk to the lady you know not only because it that she was a gentile but because that was not the dispensation or the time all right so came as son of man and he died as son of man then he came back the prophet says on the unveiling of God paragraph 68-71 that he came then as Son of God down through the seven Church ages see that would be a dispensation right or a times right all right see then he died son of man remember we gave him he rose Son of God he come down to the church ages as Son of God but then in the last age we see that a a little man as I said Paul and him didn't speak of Son of Man Peter and John and those writings uh you know now Matthew Mark Luke and John but that was the writing of the time that Christ was here and what he was doing but they didn't Paul didn't go into the revelation of son of man maybe he understood but he never dealt with those things but isn't it odd that here come brother brandom immediately there in the 40s he begin to talk about son of man son of man well it it was something was transpiring amen all right a dispensation was changing that's right from Son of God to Son of Man you know like I told you you know it took me listening about seven times to the unveiling of God to really get it years ago to get the real layout because see you go from son of man Son of God Son of David and you you you you can't control that and keep it in the right place so you go from son of man died for our sins Son of God on the day of Pentecost seven Church ages but he's to come back in the last days as the son of man again then he goes as son of David because you can't go from from Son of God to son of David you know I know you don't think the way I do and I'm glad of it but God would all be messed up but so you can't go from that dispensation you got to go with the dispensations are the times the Revelation or whatever you want to bring you got to to go that way so then you got to go from son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David and like I said people oh they're quick you know oh that's four brother Dale that's an antichrist number you don't read but it's also restoration number amen you got four you got the K War pal war and Locus caterpillar that's right you got your white horse red horse Pale Horse you know black horse Pale Horse and all you got four yeah that's good but keep reading you got to have the combat to go with that canor pal worm Locust caterpillar Luther Wesley Pentecost and the word what was it lion ox man Eagle so we think we're so smart when we can quot see but it doesn't keep you lined up all right but you have to listen see because the prophet won't say the order of say son of God Son of Man Son of God Son of Man son of David it's just in one paragraph it's in the message of the way it comes because it's got to come that way all right but he Son of God down to the ages that was the dispensation right all right then what does he turn out to do he uses the word dispensation on paragraph 65 so he could not call himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation he was the son of man prophesying to fulfill you know and to reveal all right reveal what a trial paragraph 235 he was revealed in the church ages right but the church has put him out okay then he would be revealed as son of man God manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man Prophet all right wonderful Here Comes what here come a prophet in our day to stand there and have the ministry of Elijah of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to manifest in life in reality the son of man but he was not the son of man he was a son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ a son of man was the prophet all right but he to return back in this day as son of man then he can go as son of David all right he would be revealed where the unveiling of God paragraph 184 the Son of God see that's where he come through the ages he's put out of the church how he is revealed as son of man how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the nice days no Creed nor denomination absolutely the word living in the individual am all right so where's it going to just reminding you of these things that that we used all right paragraph 3:18 of the unveiling of God he says that seed has got to be gerti none outside of that outside of them messages will ever come to life and outside of the this message of the hour the messages he brought will come to life none of it won't and then you can say messages you can even say Luther Wesley Pentecost they will come to life in the last days but what would it be the son of man the grain that went into the ground he said get the message it would come back to the son of man the grain of wheat that went into the ground all right so we use the grain of wheat come up with it and we use the fullness of the godhead bodily coming up with that then now we use dispensations coming up that way now we're going to go into the son of man we won't get very much of it today but we'll get there eventually but just think about it in the seal book paragraph 354 the four seal said we could just give you scripture after scripture see that the last age is to be a prophetic message to the church calling them back to the original word right see the son of man was the grain that went into the ground all right so now it had to be son of man again proving his word who is this son of man is the word I've got another one on that's the rising of the sun where he said in the beginning was the word word was with God he quotes it you know all right but now get to the point and then we'll get on to the message proving his word he says who is this son of man the word the word where's that word to be made manifest right where's that word word to be made manifest am in the bride right where else can it be made manifest in this day all right because Son of God can't do it that was what he was through the church ages right he going to come back as son of man the original grain that went into the ground is to come back to the original which in other words put it in plain language the word that was ate down in the Dark Ages is going to come back in its Purity and even in this day will surpass the revelation of the Apostles amen because they dealt with Son of God but not with son of man because they were not a dispensation to deal with you never noticed that in the days of Wesley when he come along with preaching sanctification all the songs was about the blood right why because he believed and it was taught that the blood saved you all right but we're not saved by the blood we're kept saved by it but his message of sanctification was right right because he taught it correctly all right but what is to happen then then we come up to a little word the prophet would call on the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled who is this mesic many many messages did he would speak of a little thing called imorph and that IM morphe would mean change in form they're in Colossians right in the form of God thought it not rather to be equal with God in morphe all right but now I said a moment ago who is to make manifest in this last days Jesus Christ is not to come back to earth in a physical body right right we meet him in the air if he came back to a physical body then he have two bodies CU he'd have that body and then we'd be his body so it would mess up everything and that won't work so he's not coming physically so then who's going to be the last IM morphe of God because that's why we're not Trinity and we don't believe in God in three persons neither are we Oneness to try to say that Jesus was the life form of God cuz that's one that's Doctrine that's why it's one like a finger all right but he's to be IM morphe where in the bride right IM morphe in the bride okay now see then what is he doing he's just changing his form I gave them these but we don't have to read it because everybody knows it who is this mesic God in morphe mask in the pillar of fire god in morphe in a man called Jesus God IM morphe in his church right amen God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God he says all right so when then we are to be the life for form of God to the Gentile dispensation then he'll go to Israel and manifest himself to them and I believe too that when he goes there he'll have to manifest himself as Son of God because he brings him salvation then he'll manifest himself through two prophets which would deal with son of man then he'll deal with son of David right amen because he's going to the Millennium and see but in the Gentiles we are the last form of God the last IM morphe all right and if it's the last in morphe would be correct then according to the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 221 can't you see where we're standing he's talking about everything left to shook left a hus left this left that can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again but where's it at life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Lord Jesus in The Bride form the same power same church same thing same word amen now but here's what we get tied up in I don't believe it's here I don't believe it's here like it was go ahead that's your choice but somebody is going to confess it and it's going to happen but yet we think it's not happening like I said you let the dead raised you let the sick healed let things happen well that could have been you know probably didn't die right brother Gary guy told him just the other day that when he said the Lord touched him delivered him from that well you know I mean you know I mean these things happen but you see what I've always said too if you let that blabber mouth that's talking like that and forgive me just plain the one that's talking about that God's not here like he used to be to me it's a blabber mouth because according to my Bible he's the same yesterday today and forever that's right am he was the same in Luther's age that's right but nobody couldn't believe it right that's it he was the same in Wesley's age nobody couldn't believe it why can't we believe it somebody is going to have to before it can be made manifest as I said about Martin Luther even though he preached a great message that didn't make the Catholic Church upset that's right it was when the people begin to believe what he said and they begin to bring it back and live it just shall live by faith the Catholic Church got it set in you see what I'm talking about but see who are we to judge what is to be you see we we're looking for things to happen when the prophet will say it's here well brother Dale that was only to him I agree with you at that time it was only to him that's I agree with you but now I believe that's got to be made manifest somewhere amen am but you see we've heard so much false until you talk about the bride be in the fullness of the godhead body I don't see it you're blind you're lady oia right amen that's my that's your choice to make I'm not just preaching out there I'm talking in Lula too so all right but you see church then it's got to come back he said can't you see where we're standing well yeah you know what biggest portion of us wouldn't even standing when he made the statement I mean a lot wouldn't right but does that change it no see they're talking about now about this Blood Moon and all I don't understand all of it I just know one thing the Bible talks about the Moon turning to blood right right you know what brother rown said he said I can show you where that happened well ain't nobody ever seen the moon turn to blood well who's the liar you or brother brandom cuz he said I can show you where it's already taken place now I can't find that I've never been able to find it if you can I'd love to have it you know but I know what he said but see we're looking for things to happen he said I I have heard but now I see that's what I was telling you in that message I was bringing about the grain of wheat the corn study the message from 65 64 and 65 all the way through and every message just about it he's talking about the grain of wheat and the return to the original right all right watch what he says on I have heard but now I see paragraph 186 go ahead and run that one brother number one B I've had to put a lot of B's ones and B's and A's and C's in this today but the grain comes out of that shook weak coming down they organize they kill themselves there's where they die there are stalks but the wheat has come up through there and now it's be to form in the bride form right but see he says the one that fell into the ground but you see we want to talk about and you can talk to the people and they'll agree with you in a hurry that son of man was brother randam you know oh yeah we saw it back there but we don't see it no more now I've told you I've preached this 40 something years and I'm still saying it I believe the ministry that was in brother brandham is in the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world whether you believe it or not I don't care I believe that the ministry that was in the Lord Jesus Christ is in the bride around the world but it's not in no one individual person no more it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ so let's just make manifest our part bride form that's what we're talking about tonight bride form God's last IM Mory and when he does he gets into the church ages that's why we read from one up and he covers seven Church ages and he covers how that Christ is in the midst of that all right then he comes up to about verse 11 and starts making an outstanding statement go ahead and pull that brother so what does he say he is already covered down through time and when he gets to the aisle of patmas he speaks to John to let him know who he is that's why we read verse one down to know who it is this is red letter if you got a red letter bible you know it's red letter of him talking that was Jesus personally all right now look what he says verse 11 says I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us write in a book and send it send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus under SM of per and I turned to see the voice that spake with me now you know we've been through that he didn't say he turned to see the person but that's what he was trying to do he knew the voice this voice spoke to John John knew that voice that's right it's the hardest thing in the world world for me to disguise this old voice I got 99% of the people that's ever talked to me on the phone the next time they do it oh hey Brother D I guess there's not a lot of them got an old voice like I've got good or bad but he didn't turn to see the person he knew who the person was right he knew the person he had ate and slept with him for three and 1/2 years in his ministry he knew that was Jesus right so he turned to see The Voice the prophet says the voice and the person is the same so there stood the Lord Jesus Christ that down through there as we went from verse one on over a good bit of it is red letter which means the person of God is speaking right and when he comes to this he's saying I'm the alpha and omega well it could not be anything else who would you be expecting if you heard the voice that could say that I can't say I'm Alpha and Omega you can't say you're Alpha and Omega John knew there was only one person that could say I am Alpha and Omega the same one that stood on the earth and said I am the word I am the son of man but I said now they didn't talk too much about son of man down Through the Ages so now we're going to see a picture of the last IM morphic of God and the surprise to John was where he seen it at like to Paul on the road to Damascus I am Jesus whom th persecuted Paul never persecuted Jesus there's no record he ever went against him where he was at I don't know what he was doing I don't know but he was persecuting the Christians and the Christians with Jesus amen all right so now watching and I turned to see the voice that spake with me in being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks that was no problem CU he just got through being explained to him he had just got through being explained of seven golden candlesticks right right but the beautiful part is what he said then and in the midst of seven candlesticks one one likee unto the son of man now John probably begin to calculate and he said I know the voice I know this is Jesus and I know he kept referring to himself a son of man then it all begins to tie together as he begins to see it and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks seven candles one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle all right he's giving the description of himself but look where he's at right this one that says the son of man he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks but it's beautiful now we'll get to it more Sunday because it says one like one like the son of man which means that you're referring to that this is not the person of Jesus that is being shown it's Jesus in his next form so it's one like where do we get there Sunday way the other day was on the Genesis he likes that likeness and things way do we get there we'll maybe pick up a few points one like unto the son of man then he's given a description of himself his head and his hairs were white like wool white as snow eyes we as a flame of fire his feet like a Define brce if they were burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters you go a little further in the Book of Revelation you find out Waters means people that's right right this is not a a point of seeing just Jesus standing it's a description of Jesus but where he's at right and what he's doing it's his IM morphe it's him changing form right and he had his right hand Seven Stars out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword count us like the sun shineth and strength when I saw him I fell his feet feet is dead he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last now this was not a prophet go ahead and pull up we already A 1 C 1 D all right one D I added these in to where I wouldn't have to repr preach the last service I preached two weeks ago all right but I didn't finish my notes so I just added them in and picked up the point so roll it on up to where we can see because this is the main thing to the last of it of what we're getting to is I'm know alpha and omega beginning and end sayith the Lord which is which was and which is to come Hebrews 138 right who is he what's this revelation of Jesus Christ and here he's not a prophet now here he is the almighty God now now here he's not a prophet now I don't have time to preach on it so I'll just say it and go on and then forget it you've heard it many many times one day the sunship in our words of using is to terminate that God may be all in all the son is to become subject exactly what the scripture say see here he's not dealing with what we thought think he's not a prophet that would be automatic son of man right but he says he's not a prophet beautiful story see he's not a prophet who is he here he is the almighty God manifested Alpha to Omega um from A to Z you know there goes that computer running a brother Dale you don't understand brother R said he's Alpha and Omega and nothing in between I've heard Services preached on that and then they said Luther and Wesley and them didn't have nothing cuz well he says he's Alpha and Omega and all this in between what's he meaning when he says and nothing between he's only referencing to the the ministry that would be in the fullness in Alpha and the ministry to be in the fullness of Omega that's right he's not saying that he's not down here the Bible declares he is amen but you see we like to get those little pet peeves and we run a Doctrine an idea and and the people poor people just sat there and holler amen right because they don't know what the truth is that's right all right but you see he's not a prophet he's not a prophet at this form that's why it says one like unto the son of man one liken to the son of man what form is that that he sees go ahead with 3B oh wait a minute Church a let me let me make sure I'm getting on the right okay they're right two all right seven Church ages look what it says speaking of this what we just read and in the midst of seven golden candles S one liken the son of man what one like him who was this his bride now do you need any more who is that it's in Revelations 1 11 12 13 Etc who is this the prophet said his bride one like him what does it say or mean one like him we'll get to that likeness more later clothed and all the different dipped and but G about the PS not a man a woman right what a golden girdle the gospel what is this golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ Oh what a beautiful picture we got here under consideration right and what does it do go to 2A cuz I did add this then I didn't remember using it which is paragraph 4 49 Church age book patmas Vision turned to see the voice that spake unto me he turned to see The Voice John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard he knew who it was but he turned to see the voice oh I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word what who is this you're seeing one liken the son of man in bright form the son of man all right go on to the next one number three why we're not a denomination paragraph 180 now if you notice in Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing in the seven Church ages seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one like the son of man standing clothed with a how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks draw out now how much more do you need it was a bride how much more would we need to try to understand go to the next Israel and the church 53 paragraph 1 58 Revelations the first chapter and John when John saw him standing one like unto the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which was the seven Church ages just to make sure we don't lose that point right now before you get too far in your thinking and run ahead of me just hold on a little bit we'll try to get there you know what you're thinking about because this is a beautiful picture that we have into view the last IM morphe of God the last form of God is in his bride before the G that's the ending of the Gentiles we go to meet him in the a all right so there should be no argument of chapter one of who this is but remember who it is it's not now watch my wording it's not the bride oh we just read it was listen it's God in his church the bride right he's revealing himself and where he's at he's glad to do that to show himself as to where he's at where he's manifesting himself in the book that were we were told not to read because we couldn't understand it can't you see that was a devil so it's the same old devil in this message well we can't understand this oh it looks like something over here and look like something over here and we don't know what this is and we don't know what I mean I'd just say the prophet was wrong the way I'd say it but of course they're not going to do that how many preachers are going to get up for well they are now far sorry they are now getting up and saying he's wrong you know what but they're still quoting sure I don't get that I mean I go say brother K is wrong I ain't going to quote him if I do I'm going to say this part is right but that other part ain't right no but you see that quote quote quote quote quote quote quote but it done said the prophet was wrong well he made the statement you can prove me wrong in one point then I'm wrong so evidently all of these things about proving him to be wrong must not be right you know and that's like we're talking about here because we're going to get into something on this reason I read this one in the middle to pause and give you a thought he described in the bride he's given a description of himself in his church one like unto the son of man heard about the paps he said see that's that's a woman that's not a man it's a woman but now let's cover a few more things that he shows while we're at this point let's talk about this paps and things a little deeper okay go ahead with 3C which is the patmas vision the message the patmas vision 1960 124e paragraph 183 come to the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wool this is what going back in Daniel TR together right and John turned and he saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven gold candlesticks with a Snow White hair am the judge watch him not gered around the waist but gered around the paps up here a judge a judge with the sight of the judge over his shoulder he stood with a golden pure holy refined girdle that held his righteousness his cover he was covered all the way to the feet watch the Sevenfold manifestation of his person and Glory so it's not just dealing with PS says it does to describe feminist or women you know or woman the bride the church but where is the judge at let's go a little deeper into this son of man lik un to you know that the world is going to be judged by you that's why it's good about the paps not to just show feminis alone but yet it does show feminis but it shows that the you've heard the prophet and if I got out of thinking here but he's not around the waste cuz that was time of service we said it's about his shoulders I thought we believe that the government was upon his shoulders talking of the church or bride see we're going to judge the world folks thought we're going to sit with him all right G to br around the PS up here a judge with the S over his shoulders showing his righteousness and pure Holiness going to the next one seal of God 1954 514 paragraph 45 describing the situation the standing where we at how that was seeing Jesus standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks to look upon as Jasper and arst Stone the B Benjamin the beginning and the ending Ruben and Benjamin see the seven candlesticks or seven lamp stand Standing There rainbow over it is a covenant and that is appeared and his voice was the voice of many Waters both Christ and the church speaking together with a golden girdle around about the breast part of the church covered over holding the gospel holding the righteousness of Christ over the church standing on the Bri Foundation right are you listening the point I'm getting at is not to just argue paps and other people would come up and say well you know paps is this and we can go to that because it's a golden girdle and it's body short all right that's what I'm reading we'll come to that point look at the next when patas Vision paragraph 167 tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top with a SC over his shoulder gted about the PS the breast with a golden girdle gted up high what is it an attorney a judge a judge with his sash over his shoulders GED up here not down as a priest see that shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John went all the way into the Lord's day and saw him coming as the judge now do you believe what I said while ago that the Bible said that one day the son will be subject himself that God may be all in all it will not do away with sunship as we think right we will always know him as God made manifest in flesh we'll always know him as the Son of God but what does it mean it means he changes dispensations he keeps moving that God may be all in all so whatever the sunship being subject will have come to dealing with the bride of Jesus Christ being the judge think about it the next one spoken words Original Seed number two paragraph 373 and of his kingdom there shall be no end and the government shall be upon his what what you know what he said the congregation says shoulders that's part of his body my that's his body is it amen his shoulders is his body where is the government on the earth at in his body Saints shall judge the Earth right that's why you don't go to court with one another you know you don't argue about that you let the government take care of it now I'm I'm honest I've always just tried to be straight just without being so blunt and but that doesn't mean that you can't sue somebody well that's my brother well if it could be solved it's a good thing to solve it without going to court but you know what might wind up showing that neither one of us is Brothers right cuz naturally me on one side I'd say he ain't my brother so I take him to court of course on the other side he see he ain't my brother that's just best thing to do is try to solve something the Bible says age with your adversary quickly it didn't say compromise with him it didn't say do those things he said agree with him if you can settle something settle it you already said with juning us in that time in Richard nna when we to get a license to drive the van and we had to go to this uh thing of you know where it's really the kids go to because they lose their license and things well that was ours that we had to go through well the guy in there said or woman I think was made a good point said if you can keep that judge from being too strict you know you got this case and it means you go to this but if you can talk him into lowering it down just try the best you can to keep it going on record but once it's on record it's there so if the cop catches you be nice to him and you say I was running 72 in a 55 and he says well buddy you know what was you doing One S you could say well bless God I wasn't doing that you going to court it's on record talk to him and say listen sir is any way you can help me a little bit I'm just sorry I apologize for driving and you know if he lowers it down to about 65 you don't have to go to court that's just plain language all right it's just plain language the Saints are going to judge the Earth the government is upon the shoulders his body the government upon his shoulder that's part of the body and what is his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth bringing to vce amen think about it think about it of what it is one more to just lay the foundation go to the last one number seven and we'll just lay it with the foundation we'll stop on this pick it up Sunday because if we continue any further we're going to progress into some things that I don't want to do without continuing it all right look at this one patas Vision page 52 Church age book patas Vision he's on Revelations 113 uh one in the midst of seven golden K like son of man there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the Lord's Day John sees him standing not as a priest but as a coming judge as a coming judge you know what we're going to sit on the throne with him amen and we're going to judge but you know what I love about that it's not going to be us that's being judged amen there is a judgment of Deeds Done in the body that out to be straightened up one of these days but there's no judgment of whether we decide eternal life or not that's decided by your new birth and if you have the new birth no matter if you're just a born again and go to Rapture that Split Second whatever you're not going to be we found out a baby you're not going to be this you're not going to be old we're all going to be young and we're all going to sit on the throne with him amen that's why in The Book of Revelations it's showing you a beautiful picture not a prophet we read it not a prophet but God in his church and what he thinks of her you get over to the end of the book of Revelation you'll find John his Wade was in the other day there 21 right in there or somebody was preaching on it just recently John is describing the bride and look like he's describing the city and John is describing the city and look like he's describing the bride you know what when we get tired there won't be no argument about Revelations 1 and what it means it won't be no fussing that this could be this way or this could be that away I emphasize brother Dale it's more the Judgment than I do the feminist the other one I I emphasize the feminist and not the Judgment well why can't we put it all together you know see the queen is going to sit there on the throne with the King and your judgment is going to be the decision of what takes place in Cas you just see it as you're sitting there and someone walks up because it won't be we won't be judging Paul's age and arenus and no no it's going to be down here where we're at okay but you're sitting there someone walks up before you and the whatever what you call them in the court the proclaimer as we'll call it what is the case and they'll say so and so and so and so and they done so and so done this and they never accepted Jesus Christ and he'll be ready to pass judgment right and say guilty but that little wife if you say but hubby honey darling sweetie whatever you want to call him and that person helped me change the tire one day that person helped me when I needed some gas money or I needed a a job or a point and that person helped me said could there be any Mercy well you you know I believe he loves his little wife and I believe he listened to her because she's not trying to finagle anything or her judgment would be judgment in other words you ask her sitting there you say what he says the judgment is death what is the judgment to why say death because they did not accept Jesus Christ but said you know they did help me the Bible says a cup of water in my name won't be forgotten in this world or the world to come right so somebody could receive eternal life because of your pleading the case cuz you know why I love the prophet would bring it he said what if you were going to court and he said you're going into court with a case and said the judge is on your side said even the prosecuting attorney on your side he said you feel pretty good I remember a sister told a young girl told one time she got called for speeding and when she had to go to court you know she was just a young kid she had to go to court said said she's so nervous and everything and going didn't know what was going to be and but her daddy he picked her up you know and he took her over and walked in and said he walked in there and said there set that judge up on her oh Lord he's going to get me he's going to find me he's going to do said the judge looked on I won't call the names because of I said the judge looked over there and said well hello there dick Addison how you doing she said I felt pretty good because I figured well Daddy knows the judge well you know we do know the judge do you know we can plead each mother's case now why wait till Judgment Day to think about judging and whatever we can plead one another's case did your Prophet say it I didn't he said a pastor is an intercessor I didn't make that statement he did you know I want somebody to plead my case don't you I can holler and scream all that I'm not guilty you know best thing to do is throw yourself on the mercy of the Court whatever case we got and I thought that we were supposed to be dealing with getting rid of ourselves here and our problems and troubles are supposed to be solved here before we get there because he's our judge and as a prosecuting attorney he can't override the judge cuz he's the final Authority but what about about her sitting there he's the final Authority she's the final Authority under him be a wonderful day Church to see what he thinks of you and I he declares we are the grain that went into the ground he declares that we are in the dispensation of the time to be the ending of all things he says we as the bride are the fullness of the godhead bodily but of course we Dre a quote brother so and so that I heard him say it he said you say that briide the fullness of the godhead bodily he don't believe it I won't say what he said because everybody know for certain he said I don't believe it well you know that didn't change me from believing it you know what that made me believe it more you know when he said he didn't believe it may me believe it more right and made me Rejoice to think of this trained person that had been in the message all of his life yeah but yet he couldn't see a simple little thing of believing what the prophet said he still wanted his ideas to go with it bride form come on Brothers bride form the last IM morphe of God in the last days we are to make manifest all that was spoke of and that's why it says they without us cannot be made perfect the word there is not dealing with a Perfection of trying to raise them up out out of the ground and preach something to them that would make them saved it means complete our fullness a full age a full dispensation that's what God thinks of his little bride what do we think about ourselves well I know I done this know I done that know done that yeah I know that but he said he put it in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more right let's stand what we got 288 the red bat anybody have a need the altar is open troubles and times are here filling men's hearts with we all heart to God Ching Rock seek the way Fus morning night many will me will sound again about him it is he the Bible said and that made us and not we ourselves we are his people you know that's an Old Testament scripture come to an old test man they were tied up in all kind of ways but he made that atonement he said black will not sin that was a man that didn't have the new birth if he could do that under the anointing why can't we believe who he has said we are up world do you live with your wife your husband because she's real good now we say oh yeah all of our wives are hting real good that's what we say right but you understand what I'm saying do you live with them because they're good or you live with them because you love them oh you love them love covers a what multitude of sin Love is Blind my wife thinks I'm the best looking guy in the world I keep telling her she need to get some glasses but see it's looking through her eyes that's the way God is he looks through wonderful eyes and don't see our problems he hears our Voice through the blood think about it Church he has come down to the last that's right we're not talking about dates and times and Seasons I've preaching this 40 40 years ago but somebody is going to say I and my father are one the prophet says the shook will pull away that's right of course now if you always just people well in a way I think maybe we could be we maybe maybe we are Brother G may may maybe we're the children of well why don't you be like us Baptist come on us Baptist you could ask them say you say I think I am I hope I am I believe I am and one day when I get over the other side I know what I am that's why when this Prophet away he started talking I said God what this man is I don't know but he's positive about what he's saying let us get away from that negativism you know oh I'm down and out brother you ain't never had problems I got is your problems deteriorate I mean taking you down or is it like the prophet said he said our problems was given to us to bring us to Perfection is that the way he said it can I paraphrase a quote and say it that a way but you see we don't want it that way we want it lined up straight down the highway well I mean if we're thinking about that they've got this place up in Alaska to send us to and they got them all over the country to send us to and and they they're doing away with every bit of our money they're doing away with all of our doings we're going to be hungry we're going to be this and oh it's going to be lovey-dovey you know it's going oh it's wonderful it's lovey doy I don't think it' be lovey doy when they take all your money away from you take your cars away take your home away may I quote brother brandom he said keep your homes and take the mark of the beast oh I don't believe he said that I'll find it for you and I'll put it on the next message so remind me to see that's where we just got our own ways and our own thoughts well you know what we're about as valuable as brother Ren says we are he says you want to know how valuable you are he said you take a glass of water and you stick your finger in the glass of water and you pull it back out and you try to find a hole well that's how valuable we are but you know what God has took us and made us his bride what greater thing could be than for him to declare that's my bride I'm going to stand in the middle of her think about it father we love you and we just ask you to go with us now as we go home and may we think about these things that have been said and I know I don't have the ability to speak eloquently and sometimes I'm just hard and arrogant and hateful but yet you just take the words and you put it together because I don't know how to do it I know a lot of times it sound like I get upset and I do but you know what my upset is my upsetness is us not you you say that I'm perfect why can't I say what you say you say the bride is the son of man why can't we say that you say that the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily why can't we say that you say the bride is the grain that went into the ground to come forth in multiple form why can't we say that just help us Lord and guide us bless everybody on the way home give a safe journey we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen your dismissed as I travel through this saely through the S it is a of this be do the best I can
