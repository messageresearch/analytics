[0:02] and I'm also teaching the Sunday School
[0:03] lesson here again uh it was going to be
[0:05] brother
[0:07] Aaron filling in for brother Bob up here
[0:09] and then he got caught on last minute to
[0:11] go to brother Dutch Scots to minister
[0:14] while I was going to be teaching the
[0:16] teenage class so uh they're joining us
[0:19] this morning the teenagers are joining
[0:21] us up here so I want to kind of cater
[0:25] this lesson partially to the teenagers
[0:28] and then to the adults and kind of
[0:31] make it um appropriate for them as well
[0:34] so just be patient with me but it's kind
[0:36] of all the same thought that I'm going
[0:38] down here I've been thinking about
[0:40] thinking if that makes any sense y'all
[0:43] know I drive a truck and I think a lot
[0:44] meditate a lot and I've been thinking
[0:47] about thinking and how important it is
[0:48] to meditate on the word of God and
[0:50] meditate on your decisions in life and
[0:53] the way you go in life so I kind of had
[0:55] a lesson geared towards the young people
[0:58] for that and and also that was what I
[1:00] was going to be teaching here next in
[1:03] the adult class so I thought I'd just
[1:05] kind of join them all together and just
[1:06] make a few comments toward the young
[1:08] people and for the young at heart so
[1:12] let's all go to the Lord in prayer
[1:13] Heavenly Father pray you bless this
[1:15] little lesson Lord let it be a blessing
[1:16] to your people father you know I've
[1:17] studied and prayed and tried to prepare
[1:18] myself for this I pray you just uh use
[1:21] my lips to speak and let it be a help to
[1:22] them I pray and their walk with you in
[1:24] Jesus name
[1:26] amen so I made the comment last time on
[1:29] my last lesson we're on uh that was love
[1:31] lesson I was teaching number four uh
[1:33] about first love and I made the comment
[1:36] that uh good oldfashioned thought goes a
[1:38] long way you know we kind of go through
[1:40] life and stumble along and think I guess
[1:42] because we're Christians that God just
[1:43] going to make make everything just
[1:45] happen just exactly right and we don't
[1:47] really have to think about what we do
[1:48] and we just kind of stumble around and
[1:50] but really he gave us a mind to think
[1:52] and he wants us to have his mind the
[1:54] mind of Christ so it really pays to
[1:56] think and you young people um I don't
[2:00] see that all that many here but Harmony
[2:02] anyway I don't know I can't young at
[2:05] heart anyway maybe they'll hear it later
[2:08] but um to the young people in that age
[2:10] bracket of you know 10 to 20 years old
[2:13] in that era in that part of life it's a
[2:16] very hard time of life because you're
[2:17] transitioning from childhood to
[2:19] adulthood there's yeah Thomas and Abby
[2:21] too so and these two all right now
[2:23] they're all appearing for me all right I
[2:24] see everybody so all right y'all are in
[2:27] this a really hard time in life and this
[2:29] one part of life I would never want to
[2:30] relive okay so uh I want to encourage
[2:33] y'all to just keep on going cuz it's not
[2:35] always going to be that way you're just
[2:36] in a transition from childhood to
[2:38] adulthood and you're you're no longer
[2:40] children you'll never be children again
[2:42] you know um so that that time is gone
[2:44] but yet you're not a full fledged adult
[2:46] per se and you're in this time of life
[2:48] where you have to make all these
[2:49] decisions that will affect the rest of
[2:51] your life and here you you don't have
[2:54] all that much wisdom from life because
[2:56] you haven't lived that much life yet so
[2:57] you're having to make all of these
[2:58] decisions whether without necessarily a
[3:00] whole lot of good life wisdom and so it
[3:04] means you really have to pray and you
[3:07] really have to think and you really have
[3:09] to meditate on your way in what you're
[3:10] doing and why you're doing it and seek
[3:12] Godly counsel there's a lot of people
[3:15] here older that have been there that you
[3:17] can seek counsel from your pastor
[3:19] ministers your parents and so on before
[3:23] you make these life decisions because as
[3:25] brother T how Thomas told me years ago
[3:27] he said after one of my gradu ation high
[3:30] school or college I don't remember it
[3:31] was a perfect time for him to tell me
[3:34] Ryan think about your decisions today
[3:36] how they'll affect you in 10 years from
[3:37] now in 20 years from now not just for
[3:39] the moment and that affected my
[3:42] decisions and I won't go into detail
[3:44] about that but it really changed my
[3:45] course and and I I started thinking Lord
[3:47] I really want you first I want to
[3:49] prioritize so that left off piloting as
[3:52] a career I said I don't want to be
[3:53] missing Church to fly people to Britain
[3:55] or whatever I don't want to be an Aina
[3:56] pilot anymore so I kept flying as a
[3:59] hobby and said I'm going to go with
[4:01] truck driving well I don't want to be an
[4:02] over the road driver it'll take me away
[4:03] from church away from family so I'll be
[4:05] a local truck driver and so it kind of
[4:08] molded me down to where I'm at now and
[4:09] I'm happy with what I'm doing being at
[4:12] church every service seeing my family
[4:13] every day driving a truck which I enjoy
[4:15] and flying for fun so you really have to
[4:18] just think about what you're doing and
[4:20] why you're doing it as far as College I
[4:23] know it's been it was kind of really
[4:25] pressed on my generation you have to
[4:27] have an education to make it well well
[4:30] yes in some sense but make it make sense
[4:33] if you're going to be a truck driver you
[4:34] don't have to have a bachelor's degree
[4:36] and and whatever you know and I got an
[4:38] associates degree but then I I I stopped
[4:40] with that because I didn't need any
[4:42] further degree to drive a truck I said
[4:44] Mom and Dad this is what I want to do I
[4:45] want to drive a trucks what do I want to
[4:46] do with my life and they said okay so I
[4:48] don't have any regrets about that but at
[4:50] least you know I didn't go $100,000 in a
[4:52] student loan debt to drive a truck you
[4:55] know so really think about what you're
[4:56] doing if you're going to college make it
[4:58] applicable to what you're going to do
[5:00] and don't waste a lot of money and time
[5:02] pursuing something that's just not going
[5:04] to magically give you a degree the
[5:06] history factories are closed you know if
[5:08] you're going for a history degree you're
[5:10] going to have to do something in like
[5:11] teaching history I mean something that
[5:12] makes that make sense you know you're
[5:15] not going to go work at a chicken plant
[5:16] with a history degree doesn't make any
[5:18] sense so good oldfashioned thought goes
[5:22] a long
[5:24] way and don't be so super spiritual to
[5:26] think that God's going to put a big old
[5:28] flashy billboard in front of for every
[5:30] decision and and just tell you exactly
[5:31] what to do as M as much as I would have
[5:33] liked him to do that he doesn't do that
[5:36] sometimes he lets us decide he wants to
[5:38] see what we'll choose he gave us free
[5:39] moral agency he wants us to choose him
[5:41] first put you know our priorities in
[5:43] order like brother John said write
[5:45] something down make a plan if you fail
[5:47] to plan your plan will fail every time
[5:51] so he wants us to think and make choices
[5:53] Philippians 4:8 you know the scripture
[5:55] think on these things choose you this
[5:57] day who you serve the scripture says and
[6:00] um set your affections on things above
[6:02] Colossians 3 set your affections on
[6:04] things above means there's a a choice it
[6:06] means there's some thought involved and
[6:08] some intention there not just it just
[6:10] automatically happen
[6:13] so brother Michael is doing a tremendous
[6:16] job teaching young people and I want
[6:17] y'all to really listen to what he's
[6:19] saying because at at 15 when I was about
[6:22] y'all's age in the Baptist Church I had
[6:24] a youth pastor much like him that was
[6:26] teaching me to seek ye first the kingdom
[6:28] of God and that stuck with me my whole
[6:29] life that's a lot of reason I started
[6:30] reading the Bible every day at that age
[6:32] it's a lot of reason that I chose to put
[6:34] Christ in marriage because of him
[6:37] brother Michael is teaching youall to
[6:38] inquire in the temple of the Lord as
[6:40] David said in Psalm 27 inquire in his
[6:43] Temple don't just come to church and sit
[6:45] and listen and then go home ask
[6:47] questions think while you're here and
[6:50] think about what was preached when you
[6:51] go home okay it'll take you a long ways
[6:53] in life to do that do the homework you
[6:56] know a minister stands up here and says
[6:57] read or listen to XYZ write it down and
[7:00] go do that brother Michael is impressing
[7:02] on y'all on that doors indoor sermon
[7:05] brother bham preached and he had y'all
[7:07] do that quiz and it was a tough quiz uh
[7:10] we helped our girls reviewing and
[7:11] preparing for that and they made a
[7:14] passing grade but it wasn't as great as
[7:15] I thought and I was thought wow that was
[7:16] a really hard quiz but he's trying to
[7:19] impress on you all that you need to let
[7:21] God into your heart but then let him
[7:23] into every door of your heart so that
[7:25] goes beyond just salvation that means
[7:27] opening the door of pride in my private
[7:29] life life and all those things like
[7:30] brother bam taught so he's really
[7:32] teaching you to seek first the kingdom
[7:33] of God so really listen to
[7:36] that all
[7:40] right so choice is obviously connected
[7:43] to thinking and that's why I'm
[7:45] impressing that's why I'm trying to
[7:47] stress the fact of thinking about what
[7:49] you're
[7:50] doing look at things and people and
[7:52] decisions through this love lens and
[7:54] that through that I'm going to try to
[7:55] transition into the adult lesson I'll
[7:57] have more kids comment or no not you're
[8:00] not kids more comments toward the young
[8:02] adults and throughout the lesson but
[8:04] that was the majority of it so Ephesians
[8:06] 5 Paul says husbands love your wies even
[8:08] as Christ loved the church and gave
[8:10] himself for
[8:13] it also um kind of teaching on uh don't
[8:17] um don't act out of bitterness and
[8:19] hatred and Malice and strife you know
[8:21] let love be the ruling factor in your
[8:23] life and the way you interact with
[8:24] people and situations and your words and
[8:28] your deeds and everything you do right
[8:29] through this love filter as I'm fixing
[8:31] to get into the filter of love the Holy
[8:34] Ghost the word of God so choosing of her
[8:37] bride brother B I'm talking here about
[8:38] decisions um if y'all remember back 2006
[8:40] the last Alabama Camp a lot of y'all
[8:43] were there we had that play and I
[8:45] believe we had brother banham quoting
[8:47] this and it never left my mind since
[8:49] then it really really heavily set in
[8:51] with me at that time as I was in that
[8:54] phase of making all these decisions
[8:55] about college career and especially
[8:57] marriage your Eternal Destin ation is a
[9:00] choice and maybe tonight some of you
[9:01] will make that choice of where you'll
[9:03] spend eternity before the service Ends
[9:05] Tonight there'll be one time that if you
[9:07] turn down God many times there'll be one
[9:09] time you'll turn him down the last time
[9:11] there is a line between mercy and
[9:13] judgment and it's a dangerous thing for
[9:15] man woman boy girl to step across that
[9:17] line but there's no turn return when you
[9:20] step across that dead
[9:21] line so tonight it might be the last
[9:24] time that many of you will make their
[9:25] decision where they will spend the
[9:27] endless eternity there's another choice
[9:29] that we have in life and that's the
[9:31] life's companion a young man young woman
[9:34] stepping out on life has been given a
[9:36] right to make a choice young man chooses
[9:39] the young woman has a right to accept or
[9:41] reject it but it's still a choice on
[9:42] both sides both man and woman have a
[9:44] right to choose and he goes on talk
[9:45] about a lot of other things you can
[9:46] choose but those are a couple of the
[9:48] main things especially eternal life
[9:50] please give your heart to Christ at a
[9:52] young age you will spare yourself
[9:53] yourself so much trouble and he will
[9:56] guide you in all these decisions about
[9:58] marriage and so forth forth so this is
[10:00] about love as a choice Psalm 91 because
[10:04] thou Hast made the Lord which is my
[10:05] refuge even the most high thy habitation
[10:07] you put God first there shall no evil
[10:10] befall thee neither shall any plague
[10:11] come not th dwelling for he shall give
[10:13] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[10:15] and all thy ways they shall bear thee up
[10:16] in their hands lest any time thou Dash
[10:18] thy foot against the stone Thou shalt
[10:20] tread upon the lion and adder and the
[10:22] Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou
[10:23] trample under feet because he hath set
[10:27] his love upon me therefore will I
[10:28] deliver him he set his love upon me
[10:30] that's a choice that takes some thinking
[10:33] and some int intention set your love
[10:35] upon
[10:36] him therefore will I deliver him I will
[10:39] set him on high because he hath known my
[10:41] name he shall call upon me and I will
[10:43] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[10:46] I will deliver him and honor him with
[10:48] long life will I satisfy him and show
[10:51] him my salvation so the love lesson
[10:53] today part five is on love filter and
[10:56] you may realize that I'm I'm making
[10:57] reference kind of to the uh thinking
[11:00] man's filter brother benon preached the
[11:01] sermon
[11:03] about and I believe he quoted that
[11:05] sermon from Ephesians
[11:07] 5 so this is about conforming our
[11:09] desires to the will of the Lord if you
[11:12] will want what God wants you to want
[11:15] you'll get what you want it's kind of
[11:18] like that I know that's kind of a tongue
[11:19] twister but set your affections say Lord
[11:22] let just conform my desires to your will
[11:25] cuz there was a time when I wanted a
[11:26] certain way and God said that's not what
[11:29] I want for you for you and brother Gary
[11:31] Atkins said Ryan if God don't want you
[11:34] to have it trust me you don't want it no
[11:36] matter how bad you think you want it
[11:37] certain things in life you young people
[11:39] may think you want now but if God don't
[11:41] want you to have it he knows best wies
[11:44] submit yourself to your own husbands as
[11:45] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[11:47] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[11:49] head of the church and he's a savior of
[11:51] the body therefore as the church is
[11:52] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[11:54] subject their own husband everything
[11:56] this is about marriage as well as Christ
[11:58] and the bride we as the bride submit our
[12:01] ways our choices everything we do to our
[12:05] husband Christ husband love your wives
[12:07] even as Christ also love the church so
[12:09] that's kind of a Selfless Love okay put
[12:12] a lot of emphasis in this lesson on
[12:15] selflessness in marriage and in every
[12:17] other interaction we have with people in
[12:19] life don't think about yourself so much
[12:21] and gave himself for it that he might
[12:23] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[12:25] of Water by the word so there is that
[12:27] renewing of your mind there is that
[12:29] filter thanking man's filter there is
[12:30] that love
[12:32] filter sanctify and cleanse us with the
[12:34] washing Water by the
[12:35] word and that gives us that Holy man's
[12:38] taste brother Banner said a holy man's
[12:39] taste is like our appetite is no longer
[12:41] for the
[12:42] world as a this kind of a slow
[12:45] transition it doesn't happen overnight
[12:47] but as a slow transition as you go
[12:49] through this journey reading the word
[12:50] and praying and seeking God and coming
[12:52] to church then you start to lose your
[12:54] desires for the things of the world you
[12:56] know for a while you might just have to
[12:58] abstain from it and and make a lot of
[13:00] effort even though you still desire it
[13:02] just try to resist the devil and he will
[13:04] flee from you but then at some point in
[13:06] time you won't have that taste anymore
[13:08] you won't desire those things anymore
[13:10] that he might present it to himself a
[13:12] glorious church not having spot or
[13:14] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[13:16] should be holy and without blemish so
[13:18] ought men to love their wives as their
[13:20] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[13:22] loveth himself for no man ever yet
[13:24] hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and
[13:26] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[13:28] church for we are members of of his body
[13:29] and of his flesh and of his bone for
[13:31] this cause shall a man leave his father
[13:32] mother be joined to his wife and they
[13:34] two shall be one
[13:37] flesh
[13:39] so looking at everybody and everything
[13:42] in life through that love
[13:45] lens did I read that one yet this is a
[13:47] great mystery of speak concerning Christ
[13:48] and the church yeah okay let's go on so
[13:51] the thanking man's filter brother B said
[13:53] oh yes the word of God is the thinking
[13:55] man's filter anyone knows that that's
[13:57] what your soul is filtered through the
[13:59] word of God and it makes when you come
[14:02] through God when a thinking man comes
[14:04] through God's filter it gives him a holy
[14:06] man's taste okay that's right when you
[14:10] come through God's filter then your
[14:11] taste is a holy man's taste it makes a
[14:14] righteous man's taste the slogan
[14:16] certainly is
[14:18] okay all right thanking man's filter but
[14:22] down inside of you somewhere here you
[14:24] come there was something in there that
[14:27] began to draw if you note it was
[14:28] something that told you there was a god
[14:30] somewhere and you read his word then you
[14:32] took the church you took the their ideas
[14:36] and you was told better then you never
[14:37] Ed to think uh use to thanking man's
[14:39] filter but when you use God's filter
[14:41] which is a thanking man's filter because
[14:43] all of the filter will pass away but
[14:44] mine shall
[14:45] not and when you take God's filter and
[14:48] draw your life your desires if you draw
[14:51] your desires through God's filter
[14:53] thinking man's filter there is nothing
[14:55] left but the Holy Ghost now if you want
[14:57] the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it
[14:58] is
[14:59] when that soul of yours will align with
[15:01] the word of God in every respect it
[15:03] shows you draw your life through the
[15:04] thing of man's filter God's filter
[15:06] notice is that God's filter he said he
[15:09] was Washed by the Water of the
[15:11] word so I quoted this last time I wanted
[15:15] to leave I want to go ahead and I took a
[15:17] lot of things out that I don't need to
[15:18] repeat but I really want to repeat this
[15:19] little quote here uh it came from the
[15:22] the Life Bible app it's a devotional
[15:25] that you know they quote a lot of
[15:26] devotionals and there from different
[15:28] sources so
[15:30] Western culture has shaped our minds to
[15:32] believe that the purpose of the
[15:33] institution of marriage is to make
[15:35] individuals happy
[15:37] selfish people tend to believe that
[15:39] marriage is about finding the right
[15:40] person a person whose likes and dislikes
[15:42] hobbies and interests match own The
[15:45] Dating Game try this one try that one
[15:47] till you find the right one you know
[15:49] that's not God's way that's that's the
[15:50] world's way trying one trying another
[15:53] and we tend to believe it's about
[15:55] finding a person who completes us and
[15:57] makes us whole this results in a me
[16:01] mindset in marriage we can foolishly
[16:03] enter into a marriage relationship
[16:04] focused on what we think we will get out
[16:06] of it in Ephesians 5 the Apostle Paul
[16:08] tells us that marriage isn't about
[16:09] making ourselves happy it's about making
[16:12] us holy marriage is a picture of how
[16:14] Jesus loves the church and gave himself
[16:15] a sacrifice we quoted uh Ephesians
[16:19] 5 remember too when talking about
[16:21] selfishness about brother Bob's lesson
[16:23] last Sunday about all the eye Wills I
[16:25] think he said that was five eye Wills of
[16:28] Lucifer I will be like the most high I
[16:30] will send to the heaven and so forth he
[16:33] has his will that he wants done and
[16:36] every time someone Falls away from the
[16:38] lord it's always something to do with
[16:39] your own will getting in the way and
[16:41] thinking God's not capable and thinking
[16:42] well I need to help him out I need to
[16:44] help him find me a spouse so I'm going
[16:46] to try this one and try that one and I
[16:47] need to help him find me a job so I'm
[16:49] going to do this and do that and just
[16:51] sit back wait on God pray read your
[16:54] Bible seek you first the kingdom of God
[16:56] and watch what he does
[16:59] marriage isn't about finding the right
[17:00] person it's about being the right person
[17:01] both husband and wife are called to be
[17:03] the type of people who love
[17:04] unconditionally forgive continually
[17:06] serve sacrificially just like
[17:08] Jesus Paul calls us to enter into
[17:10] marriage with the ministry mindset
[17:12] marriage isn't about what you can get
[17:14] out of the relationship about what you
[17:15] can give to the relationship for God's
[17:18] glory when you seek to demonstrate love
[17:20] in your marriage when you're willing to
[17:22] lay down your life for your spouse and
[17:24] serve sacrificially the gospel is
[17:25] rehearsed daily in your household bottom
[17:27] line marriage is about having a Ministry
[17:30] mindset of loving service rather than a
[17:33] selfish mindset that was from a moment
[17:36] of uh from the book um strength
[17:38] inspiration for
[17:39] men so here's an illustration that I
[17:42] thought of the other day and I think
[17:43] it's a beautiful thing and um I hope
[17:45] it's hope there's nothing wrong with it
[17:47] but just imagine what this looks like to
[17:49] the Lord so you young
[17:52] people um you grow up and you come to
[17:55] the age of accountability and you give
[17:56] your heart to the Lord and that's the
[17:57] best thing you could possibly do
[17:59] at a young age 12 years old or so you
[18:02] give your heart to the Lord and
[18:03] metaphorically speaking you've now put
[18:05] yourself up in the lap of Jesus in his
[18:07] arms and you're saying Lord I want you
[18:10] to guide me I want you to lead me
[18:11] through every path that I take in life
[18:14] and have your way thy kingdom come thy
[18:17] will be
[18:18] done and he'll lead you and he'll guide
[18:20] you into all truth and he'll lead you to
[18:22] a spouse and his time and he'll lead you
[18:24] to the right career and college if
[18:27] necessary whatever else you need to do
[18:28] in life life he'll lead
[18:31] you and suppose this is a boy and a girl
[18:33] I can't tell from the picture but let's
[18:35] just suppose this is a boy and a girl
[18:36] living two separate lives and now
[18:38] they've both committed their lives to
[18:39] Christ and they've grown up in the Lord
[18:41] and they're serving the
[18:42] lord what must that look like to him he
[18:44] loves that and they come let back up
[18:46] read that at the bottom first walk with
[18:48] the Lord as a child that's number one
[18:49] establish that as a as young as you can
[18:51] give your heart to Christ and serve him
[18:53] all of your days and determine in
[18:55] yourself I'm never never going to stop
[18:57] seeking God I'm never going to not serve
[19:00] the Lord for the rest of my life now
[19:02] that's thing number one thing number two
[19:03] then when he brings that special someone
[19:06] to you then as a couple you walk with
[19:08] them always so like on the right here uh
[19:12] that picture of me and Gabby there
[19:13] brother Luther's Church there that was
[19:15] me putting the ring on her finger on her
[19:17] wedding day and you know when you come
[19:19] to this wedding ceremony it's so
[19:21] sanctimonious there's so much symbology
[19:25] of Eternity you know when our Rings you
[19:27] know meaning that marriage is until
[19:29] death to your part is not a temporary
[19:31] thing and and the Bible they're
[19:34] representing you know the word of God of
[19:35] course of of the Lord there and then in
[19:38] the church among a cloud of witnesses
[19:40] and at the altar where your life is
[19:42] changed here at the altar and you're
[19:44] taking a new Direction in life in so
[19:46] many ways so many new things opening up
[19:48] to you and from day one suppose that
[19:51] those two kids that grew up in the arms
[19:54] of the Lord have now committed theel to
[19:56] Christ and they both sat there before
[20:00] the Lord every day for their marriage
[20:01] can you imagine what that must do to the
[20:03] Lord what that must what he must think
[20:05] of that that these two people have
[20:07] served him their whole life now have
[20:08] consecrated themselves to each other and
[20:10] together they're going to reestablish
[20:12] what was in the Garden of Eden the
[20:13] original marriage holy matrimony not
[20:15] just a joint venture holy matrimony not
[20:18] just husband and wife husband and wife
[20:20] and the Lord walking together in Christ
[20:23] every day reading the Bible together
[20:25] praying together coming to church
[20:26] together listening to sermons together
[20:28] and what must he think of
[20:30] that I think it's a great thing I think
[20:33] it's one of the best things you can do
[20:35] the best thing you do in life is give
[20:36] your heart to Christ I'd say the second
[20:38] best thing is determined to read your
[20:40] Bible every day and pray but then
[20:44] somewhere down the list for sure is
[20:46] establish a marriage for Christ that you
[20:48] put him in it beyond the wedding day you
[20:51] come to the altar sure and you have all
[20:52] this symbology here for the wedding
[20:54] ceremony but what about day number two
[20:57] what if the very night of your wedding
[20:58] weding you open the Bible and pray
[21:00] together and read the Bible together and
[21:01] then the first day of your the very next
[21:04] opportunity the doors are open at the
[21:05] church you go to church together and
[21:07] from there on you just serve them
[21:08] together walk close with the Lord IND
[21:10] individually and with your spouse remove
[21:12] self from
[21:14] Marriage Paul's saying here in 1
[21:16] Corinthians 7 but I would have you
[21:17] without carefulness he that is unmarried
[21:19] care for the things that belong to the
[21:20] Lord how he may please the Lord so you
[21:22] can be more committed to Christ without
[21:24] distraction if you don't get married but
[21:25] if you're going to get married he that's
[21:27] married you know has other things uh he
[21:31] cares for the things of the world how he
[21:32] may please his wife he's not say
[21:33] anything wrong about that it's just that
[21:35] you can't fully uh attend on the Lord
[21:38] now you've got to attend to your spouse
[21:40] but he you should be thinking about how
[21:42] you can please your spouse too okay not
[21:46] yourself and then likewise the wife uh
[21:49] the unmarried woman care for the things
[21:50] of the Lord has she may be holy both in
[21:51] body and spirit she that is married
[21:53] careth for the things of the world how
[21:55] she may please her husband this I speak
[21:57] for your own Prophet not that May cast a
[21:59] snare upon you but that for that which
[22:01] is calmly and that you may attend upon
[22:02] the Lord without distraction the point
[22:04] of quoting that was to say that Paul's
[22:07] pointing out that you know husband and
[22:09] wife are committed to each other and not
[22:11] thinking of their own
[22:12] self so God keeps his word brother B
[22:15] said so children back to your God
[22:16] quickly just for time sake I'm going to
[22:18] skip down just read the yellow read your
[22:19] Bible and pray all the
[22:21] time and the yellow part in here too uh
[22:25] from the message of Abraham and he will
[22:27] reveal to babes such as will believe if
[22:29] you want to get anything from God just
[22:31] be a baby like those pictures I showed
[22:33] you be a baby open up the Bible fall in
[22:36] love with Jesus sit there in his lap and
[22:38] just say Lord tell me about
[22:41] you for the message identification then
[22:44] will we let his character be in us if we
[22:46] have become Sons by having the mind of
[22:48] Christ which is his character your mind
[22:50] takes your character let the Mind Paul
[22:53] said of Christ this mind that was in
[22:55] Christ be in you let the mind of Christ
[22:57] be in you it mold the character of a Son
[23:00] of
[23:00] God so that's where we get his mind from
[23:03] I'm going to have to save this for later
[23:05] this is uh that love D book I quoted a
[23:07] time or two before well actually I will
[23:09] just quote one of them I guess while the
[23:10] musicians come y'all go ahead and
[23:12] musicians make your way up this is a
[23:14] devotional that Gab and I reading
[23:15] together um from the scripture Romans 13
[23:18] don't owe any man anything except to
[23:19] love one another for who uh the one who
[23:22] loves another has fulfilled the law love
[23:25] ultimately fulfills every law of God it
[23:27] persuades us to live out all all that is
[23:29] good and forbids us from doing all that
[23:31] is evil Every Act of hatred subtle
[23:33] deception appla of unfaithfulness is
[23:35] vetoed when the love command is in our
[23:38] hearts love toward God leads us to obey
[23:40] him uphold his rightful place of honor
[23:42] in our lives if we do so we will by
[23:45] default not sin against his name love
[23:48] toward others transforms our behavior
[23:51] for the better and defend diffuses evil
[23:53] intentions like that like light dispels
[23:55] Darkness so put on those love glasses
[23:57] look at everything through these that
[23:59] love lens of the Holy Ghost men who lead
[24:02] by love won't deceive or degrade their
[24:03] wives or their neighbors When Love fills
[24:05] a woman's mouth she encourages her
[24:07] family instead of tearing them down when
[24:08] you're focused on love you will
[24:09] naturally demonstrate patience
[24:11] tenderness and kindness rather than
[24:13] trying to manufacture right actions and
[24:14] attitudes let love become your first
[24:16] response and your default position and
[24:19] you're set to launch in any circumstance
[24:21] graciously and to land with no
[24:23] regrets that's it for today God bless
[24:25] you thank you
[24:31] thank you
[24:38] [Music]
