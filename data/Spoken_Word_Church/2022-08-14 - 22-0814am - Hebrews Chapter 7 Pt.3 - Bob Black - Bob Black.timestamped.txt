[0:00] come expecting to receive
[0:12] we're on hebrews chapter 7 talking about
[0:14] looking at melchizedek let's just carry
[0:16] the lord in prayer lord we're so
[0:17] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:18] around your word and we just ask your
[0:20] blessing
[0:21] as we as we study these things out and
[0:23] unpack the scripture lord jesus i pray
[0:25] god that you'll just open it to us lord
[0:27] in a way this goes beyond just teaching
[0:29] and laying things out lord that you'll
[0:31] speak to hearts lord and granted lord
[0:33] that you are just blessed by the way it
[0:34] is he's studying and preparing lord god
[0:36] and prepare our hearts lord to receive
[0:38] what you have in store for us today amen
[0:43] so hebrews chapter 7 says
[0:46] for this melchizedek king of salem
[0:50] priest of the most high god who met
[0:52] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[0:53] the kings and blessed him
[0:55] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[0:57] of all first being by interpretation
[0:59] king of righteousness and after that
[1:01] also king of salem which is king of
[1:03] peace without father without mother
[1:04] without descent
[1:06] having neither beginning of days nor end
[1:08] of life but made like unto the son of
[1:10] god abideth a priest continuously
[1:12] continually
[1:14] now consider how great this man was and
[1:16] to whom even the patriarch abraham gave
[1:18] the tenth of the spoils
[1:21] so as we study these things out that's
[1:23] what we want we want to understand is
[1:24] how greek this man was if we can get an
[1:26] understanding of who this man is will
[1:29] realize why while melchizedek paid ties
[1:32] to him and all of these things that paul
[1:34] is laying out well how is how could it
[1:36] be that levi would pay ties
[1:38] to
[1:38] to melchizedek while he was in abraham
[1:41] and and all of all of these things so we
[1:43] want to unpack this this scripture
[1:45] that abraham uh last time we were kind
[1:47] of looking at how that uh the journey of
[1:50] of abraham that he met melchizedek first
[1:52] in genesis chapter 14 when
[1:55] after the slaughter of the kings of
[1:56] cheddar armor and all the different
[1:58] kings that abraham went out to rescue
[2:01] lot
[2:02] and after after that battle was over
[2:04] then he sat down with melchizedek and
[2:06] and and melchizedek gave him communion
[2:09] you know it's always it's always after
[2:10] the after the battle's over when you
[2:12] when you have communion after you battle
[2:15] at battle things out and sanctification
[2:17] then god can begin to commune with you
[2:19] and and uh you can begin to understand
[2:22] that the word begins to open up to you
[2:25] so it says here brother brahman said and
[2:26] who is this melchizedek he said when
[2:28] abraham met him he was melchizedek he
[2:31] unfolds here what all the attributes
[2:33] will do in the final end every son of
[2:35] abraham
[2:36] every son of the faith will absolutely
[2:39] do the same thing
[2:40] so that journey that if we go back to
[2:42] that previous slide that
[2:44] the journey that abraham was on when he
[2:46] met melchizedek and then met him again
[2:48] later in genesis 18 that every every son
[2:51] of the faith is going to do that go
[2:52] through that same journey
[2:54] and every son of the faith is going to
[2:56] meet melchizedek how are you going to me
[2:58] what's the effect of meeting melchizedek
[3:00] you pay ties you recognize you recognize
[3:03] who you're meeting something begins to
[3:05] happen
[3:06] so so if we can understand how how great
[3:08] this man was and who this man is that
[3:11] will understand that
[3:13] our own story and the life that's
[3:15] unfolding here
[3:18] you know in genesis chapter 14 we looked
[3:20] at last time how how abraham uh communed
[3:24] with with melchizedek and you know
[3:26] communion is communion as a relationship
[3:28] and
[3:29] unfolding
[3:30] unfolding the revelation of who this man
[3:32] is
[3:33] and brother brahman said and who is this
[3:35] melchizedek when we start to look at who
[3:37] uh
[3:38] who exactly this this the nature of this
[3:40] of this person he said notice now his
[3:42] attribute
[3:44] the attribute was first god the thought
[3:46] the attribute itself all in one without
[3:49] being expressed
[3:50] then when he expressed secondarily he
[3:52] became then the word and then the word
[3:54] was made flesh and dwelt among us and if
[3:57] you skip down to the bottom he said this
[3:59] then is the state he was in when he met
[4:01] abraham
[4:02] was called melchizedek
[4:05] so let's go back up to the top he said
[4:06] when when time began it was a word but
[4:08] before it was word it was attribute a
[4:11] thought
[4:12] now we're getting where melchizedek is
[4:14] that's this mysterious person
[4:16] his first being was
[4:18] spirit god supernatural all right the
[4:21] great eternal second he began to form
[4:23] himself towards flesh
[4:25] in a theophany it's called the word a
[4:28] body
[4:29] this then is the state he was in when he
[4:32] met abraham was called melchizedek he
[4:34] was in the form of theophany now we'll
[4:37] get to that and prove it in a few
[4:38] minutes the lord willing he was the word
[4:41] so now you've got this story you've got
[4:43] this picture of god unfolding himself so
[4:45] that we can understand him so that god
[4:47] can have fellowship with us
[4:48] unfolding himself in morphe revealing
[4:51] himself as he changes his mask down to
[4:53] where he's actually revealing himself in
[4:55] man
[4:56] so you take it and like john did all the
[4:58] way back to the beginning in the
[4:59] beginning was the word
[5:01] the expression the attribute of the
[5:03] fullness of god
[5:05] and the word was with god and the word
[5:07] was god the same was in the beginning
[5:08] with god all things were made by him and
[5:10] without him was not anything made that
[5:12] was made in him was life
[5:14] and the life was the light of men
[5:16] that was the true light which lighteth
[5:18] every man that cometh into the world he
[5:21] was in the world and the world was made
[5:22] by him and the world knew him not he
[5:24] came unto his own and his own received
[5:26] him not
[5:28] so we've got that that picture i i did
[5:30] my best at trying to express something
[5:31] that really can only be picked it can
[5:33] only be understood by revelation but
[5:35] brother around like we explained last
[5:37] time that brother brown explained the
[5:39] the office of the father
[5:41] it's like a diamond or a a
[5:43] rainbow and a fountain all of those
[5:46] things that he tried to express that
[5:48] that within him were attributes and
[5:49] brother brown would explain what what's
[5:51] an attribute an attribute as a nature so
[5:53] in god was a nature of of redeemer or
[5:57] the nature of healer and when an
[5:59] attribute is expressed let's think that
[6:01] now if any of those attributes are
[6:03] expressed in you
[6:04] then you will have the same nature that
[6:07] that
[6:08] god wanted to express the same nature of
[6:10] god
[6:11] so it uh from god he wanted to express
[6:14] the nature that that attribute of a
[6:16] redeemer so he began to
[6:19] he began to to condescend to come down
[6:21] and express to express in something that
[6:24] we could understand
[6:25] that the word is called the word the
[6:27] logos
[6:29] now isn't it interesting that that
[6:31] expression of those attributes is called
[6:32] the word and we hear the word we're
[6:34] receiving the word you're actually as
[6:36] the as the gospel being preached that's
[6:38] what kind of the unfolding my point here
[6:41] as as we get to it
[6:43] as the word is being preached what's
[6:44] being preached is actually as you
[6:46] receive it you're actually receiving
[6:48] that thought that was in god before the
[6:50] foundation of the world you are becoming
[6:52] the word as you hear the word because
[6:54] you're receiving you're receiving that
[6:56] word that was in god before the
[6:57] foundation
[6:59] so brother ram said in the pillar of
[7:01] fire he said and now the bible teaches
[7:03] us that the logos went out of god or i
[7:05] might say all of the god becoming his
[7:08] first body form when the logos went out
[7:10] of god
[7:13] let's look at what it looked like no one
[7:16] has seen the father at any time no one
[7:19] nowhere never did
[7:21] and never will
[7:23] you're never going to see the father
[7:24] like like that like looking at it any
[7:27] time nowhere never did never will but
[7:29] then the logos that went out of him
[7:30] become like a little halo of light
[7:33] playing yonder like a little child
[7:35] before the doorstep of the father and
[7:36] now i can see him as he moves over here
[7:38] and he draws into his memory or his mind
[7:40] a picture of what the world should be
[7:43] now there's not a star or nothing i hear
[7:45] him say let there be
[7:47] and an atom broke beyond her and when it
[7:49] did the sun came into existence that
[7:51] began to whirl she burned for millions
[7:53] of years and millions and millions of
[7:54] years
[7:56] the first star that flew from the sun he
[7:57] watches it fall for a few million years
[7:59] and he stops it and then another one
[8:01] flies off and he lets it fall a few
[8:03] million years what's he doing writing
[8:05] his first bible
[8:06] the zodiac so you know i i got a picture
[8:09] if you if you haven't seen any of those
[8:11] pictures of the james webb telescope
[8:12] that just this
[8:14] they just this is one of those pictures
[8:16] that you can look way back into the eons
[8:18] and see see stars being formed and you
[8:21] know you think about that
[8:23] they start they didn't just come about
[8:24] just just happenstance but there was a
[8:27] god that spoke these things into
[8:28] existence
[8:29] so that's that that what i'm talking
[8:31] about is that that the logos the word
[8:34] the expression of the father is the one
[8:36] that
[8:37] came down and visited melchizedek he's
[8:39] the one that spoke these things into his
[8:41] existence and one day was manifested
[8:44] in the flesh of a little baby crying in
[8:46] a manger so that he could be manifest in
[8:48] your flesh
[8:50] brotherham said he said the logos
[8:53] this great fountain of spirit which had
[8:55] no beginning or no end this great spirit
[8:57] began to form in the creation and the
[8:59] logos that went out from it was the son
[9:01] of god it was the only visible form
[9:03] that the spirit had and it was a
[9:05] theophany which means a body and the
[9:07] body was like a man
[9:10] and it was the theophany of god that
[9:11] went out the human form that didn't have
[9:13] eyes like you see a better eye it didn't
[9:16] have ears like you hear but a far more
[9:18] hearing see it was a theophany that all
[9:21] this rainbow condescended into a
[9:23] theophany moses saw it when he passed
[9:25] through the rock like that he saw the
[9:27] back part said it looked like a man so
[9:29] what does a theophany look like it looks
[9:30] like a man with ten fingers and ten toes
[9:33] and a mouth that he could speak through
[9:34] and eyes but far better eyes far better
[9:36] seeing because it's a supernatural
[9:39] something supernatural not
[9:41] constrained by flesh so
[9:43] out of out of god
[9:45] no man has seen god at any time as john
[9:48] 1 1 says but the only begotten son which
[9:50] is in the bosom of the father he hath
[9:51] declared him so god began to express
[9:54] himself by unfolding himself down
[9:56] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[9:58] and the word was with god and the word
[10:00] was god down down into genesis 1 26 that
[10:04] says god let us god said let us make man
[10:06] in our image after our likeness and let
[10:08] them have dominion over the fish of the
[10:10] sea now what's god doing he's he's got
[10:12] these attributes that he wants to
[10:13] express and so that he expresses himself
[10:16] in the attribute of the full the
[10:17] attribute of the fullness of the father
[10:19] was was the word and but yet in the word
[10:22] was all of these attributes the
[10:24] attributes of you and i that he wanted
[10:26] to express
[10:28] down through every church age he wanted
[10:29] to express some in ephesians at the
[10:31] ephesians age and smurling all down
[10:34] and so
[10:35] god knew each one that that would be
[10:37] manifest in every age so he had like uh
[10:40] it's like almost you say a scroll
[10:43] or or a book or as as brother keith reed
[10:46] was preaching uh last
[10:48] last weekend
[10:50] we'll say the abstract title d that you
[10:53] can go back if you can tie tie
[10:55] everything back to that original the
[10:58] original book the original abstract deed
[11:01] the thing that god wanted to express
[11:04] from the from the beginning
[11:06] then that makes everything
[11:08] right
[11:10] so brother ram said in in the believer's
[11:12] position in christ he said when god said
[11:14] man let
[11:15] when god made man
[11:18] said when god made man said let us make
[11:19] man in our own image let us give them
[11:24] plural let us get make man in our own
[11:27] image spirit man and give them dominion
[11:29] over the fishes of the sea and the
[11:30] cattles and so forth now back there
[11:33] before the foundation of the world god
[11:35] chose you and christ jesus to appear
[11:37] holy at the end time
[11:39] all the way from the foundation of the
[11:41] world
[11:44] and in hebrews chapter four he said was
[11:46] god a man certainly let us make man in
[11:49] our own image what was god a theophany
[11:52] a body
[11:53] and there man was made like that and put
[11:55] over the garden
[11:57] and god the theophany come down
[11:59] and was made flesh and dwelt among us to
[12:02] redeem the man
[12:04] and questions and answers on hebrews
[12:05] number three he said
[12:07] when god created you in his image or
[12:09] created the man in his image and created
[12:11] the woman in the image of the man for
[12:12] the glory of the man he made you a
[12:14] theophany just like himself when he said
[12:16] let us to the creatures that he had made
[12:19] let us make man in our own image and our
[12:21] likeness of theophany
[12:23] what god is like unfurling himself
[12:26] unfolding himself is the words that
[12:28] brother ram used to explain that god's
[12:30] condescending moving moving
[12:33] down from from uh
[12:35] attribute from thought all the way down
[12:38] to where we could hold him and hug him
[12:40] and talk to him
[12:42] and fellowship with him
[12:44] which is what john chapter 17 is talking
[12:46] about when he says when jesus began to
[12:48] pray and he said as thou has given him
[12:50] power over all flesh that he should give
[12:52] eternal life to as many as thou has
[12:53] given him and this is life eternal that
[12:56] they might know thee the only true god
[12:58] and jesus christ whom thou has sent
[13:01] i have glorified thee on the earth i
[13:03] have finished the work which thou us me
[13:05] to do and now father glorify thou me
[13:09] with thine own self with the glory which
[13:11] i had with thee before the world was
[13:13] i have manifested thy name unto the men
[13:15] which thou gavest me out of the world
[13:17] thine they were and thou gavest me them
[13:20] me and they have kept thy word
[13:24] with god in morphing what's in morph and
[13:26] morphine is god changing his mask
[13:29] like like an actor in a play that he's
[13:30] got a mask going he's coming
[13:33] there's different acts in a play and
[13:35] he's and he's coming down to show
[13:37] to to to fulfill to play all the
[13:40] different parts
[13:41] now you look at this and you you
[13:44] we can see god coming down from thought
[13:46] attribute that great fountain to
[13:48] manifesting in a and a body at the logos
[13:51] the theophany when in those were
[13:53] attributes that he wanted to express so
[13:54] he expressed himself in flesh
[13:57] but now let's just let's just compare
[13:59] compare this now brother adam said we're
[14:01] not oneness and we're not trinitarian
[14:04] so somewhere in the middle of those you
[14:06] gotta have the right kind of truth so
[14:08] now let's just let's just kind of
[14:09] compare what does a oneness belief
[14:12] now now we believe that you know god
[14:14] unfolded from that attribute to logos
[14:18] to be manifested in flesh
[14:20] but now if you look at oneness theology
[14:22] they take take that picture that we just
[14:24] took and and and swipe away all of the
[14:26] the the logos part and the genesis 1 26
[14:31] 27 god unfurl unfolding himself into
[14:34] expression of of the the the attributes
[14:37] of you and i that would one day be
[14:38] manifest
[14:40] and
[14:42] and you're left with with this kind of
[14:43] picture
[14:45] i was looking at a a a website that was
[14:48] kind of outlining the one that's
[14:49] pentecostal viewpoint this is what they
[14:51] said you understand son to refer to both
[14:53] pre and post incarnation
[14:56] while we understand the term to only
[14:58] apply after the incarnation
[15:00] so the way they're looking at it is is
[15:03] is that god would take
[15:05] take the the look at the father is like
[15:07] the pillar of fire
[15:08] and you cannot use the word son until
[15:11] you get to jesus crying in a manger
[15:14] you understand son to refer to both pre
[15:16] and post incarnation while we understand
[15:19] the term to only apply after the
[15:20] incarnation
[15:22] coming into existence only because of
[15:24] the addition of humanity to god's
[15:26] previously unmitigated deity to
[15:28] describes the relationship between god
[15:30] transcendent between humanity and god
[15:32] limited in a human existence so what are
[15:35] the what are they missing they're
[15:36] missing the part of god unfolding
[15:37] himself which is what brother branham
[15:39] explained he said
[15:41] he said uh and the message lord show us
[15:44] the father and it suffices us he said
[15:46] they believed in the eternal sonship
[15:48] or there's three the the catholics the
[15:51] trinitarian viewpoint there's three
[15:52] actual individual being god the father
[15:55] an old man with a long white beard god
[15:57] the son a middle aged man and the holy
[15:59] ghost was a mascot boy light
[16:01] there's no such things there's only one
[16:03] god
[16:04] and i different agree with the
[16:05] organization of pentecost that calls the
[16:07] oneness like your finger is one that's
[16:10] wrong absolutely it's wrong
[16:12] jesus couldn't have been his own father
[16:14] and if god is a man then jesus was born
[16:16] sexual desire and not virgin birth that
[16:18] settles the whole thing so what are they
[16:19] struggling with you can't see the
[16:21] manifestation of god unfolding himself
[16:25] a loving father coming right down from
[16:27] the heavens unfolding himself
[16:29] coming down to live among human beings
[16:32] here on earth
[16:34] there you are god was in his son and now
[16:36] i've been unfolded to you also
[16:38] god is in his people
[16:40] so
[16:41] and you compare that with the
[16:42] trinitarian view and
[16:44] i'm i'm just trying to outline some of
[16:46] these things because i know some have
[16:47] asked to just kind of lead a basic
[16:49] framework for kind of what we believe
[16:52] and the trinitarian view is this picture
[16:54] is kind of what
[16:55] what the trinitarians all our websites
[16:58] and things show is that you know they've
[17:00] got the
[17:01] the diagram that shows the father is god
[17:04] and the son is god and the spirit is god
[17:06] but they're not they're not the same
[17:08] thing it's not the same but the father
[17:10] is not the son the father is not the
[17:12] spirit the father the spirit is not the
[17:14] son and it is
[17:17] looking at it
[17:18] not under failing to understand that
[17:20] it's one person all the time one
[17:22] personality
[17:24] you can see off the uh the website the
[17:26] catholic encyclopedia says the trinity
[17:28] is the term employed to signify the
[17:30] central doctrine of the christian
[17:32] religion the truth that in the unity of
[17:34] the godhead there are three persons
[17:36] the father the son and the holy spirit
[17:38] these three persons
[17:40] being truly distinct from one another
[17:43] but if you've got three persons then you
[17:45] got three per people arguing one another
[17:47] you got three opinions and you can never
[17:49] be you can never uh
[17:51] it would just be chaos if you got three
[17:53] different three different people and and
[17:55] then the scriptures are all
[17:57] all messed up how and what name would we
[18:00] be baptized in how do you how are you
[18:02] how would you be baptized in who do you
[18:03] pray to
[18:04] uh who are we talking to when we get on
[18:06] our knees which which one of these
[18:08] people
[18:09] so you see there's a there's a there's a
[18:11] a middle of the road to all things
[18:13] there's a balance between those two
[18:15] two two understandings between the
[18:17] oneness that
[18:18] that god is just is is just one like
[18:21] your finger and throwing away the
[18:22] unfolding of himself and on the other
[18:25] side that god is three different people
[18:27] so there's a balance right there in the
[18:29] middle if we can understand so brother
[18:31] adam said in the kinsmen redeemer he
[18:33] said i differ with billy graham on three
[18:35] individual persons in the godhead or any
[18:37] other trinitarian teacher on that i
[18:39] believe in a trinity of course
[18:41] now that shouldn't make us
[18:43] make our heads swim
[18:45] but not in that manner them being three
[18:47] persons not in that manner not like that
[18:50] that there's three different people
[18:52] they're one
[18:54] so there you've got the true
[18:56] understanding of matthew 28 19 it says
[18:58] go you therefore and teach all nations
[19:00] baptizing them in the name of the father
[19:02] and of the son of the holy ghost what's
[19:04] his name was answered in acts 2 38 his
[19:07] name is jesus christ because it's one
[19:10] person unfolding himself one per if it's
[19:13] because it's one person
[19:15] then the characteristics and the nature
[19:18] of the father manifested in the son
[19:21] manifested in you are all are all
[19:23] identical because the an attribute is
[19:26] the nature and his characteristics and
[19:28] his personality his personality
[19:30] manifested in brother branham and the
[19:32] life of irenaeus and martin and columba
[19:34] and all those and manifested in you will
[19:36] be exactly the same if you become the
[19:39] word
[19:40] if you become that word then it will be
[19:42] it will demonstrate exactly the same
[19:44] fruits exactly the same characteristics
[19:47] that was in christ
[19:54] brother brown said in the message of
[19:55] trial he said
[19:57] jesus come with three titles son of man
[19:59] son of david son of god all the same
[20:01] person that's just like the trinity
[20:03] father son holy ghost not three gods one
[20:06] person the three attributes of god
[20:08] now see just like i am three persons i
[20:10] am to my father a husband i'm to my
[20:12] daughter sitting here daddy
[20:14] and my grandson is sitting here at
[20:16] grandpa
[20:17] now my wife only has claims on me as her
[20:19] husband and my daughter here can't say
[20:21] husband because she's my child my
[20:23] grandson can't call me daddy he has no
[20:26] no claims on me as daddy he might call
[20:28] me that but it isn't so he is my
[20:30] grandson yet i'm the same person
[20:33] it's god unveiling himself
[20:36] bringing himself down so he can be he
[20:38] was above and a pillar of fire then he
[20:40] was manifested in his son jesus christ
[20:43] and now revealed to us by the holy ghost
[20:46] watch when he come now now don't forget
[20:49] though
[20:49] the question we're trying to answer is
[20:52] who how great was this man that came to
[20:54] abraham that this melchizedek how great
[20:57] who was this man it was god revealing
[21:00] himself
[21:02] and brother brown will say it and in
[21:04] morphy the difference between jesus and
[21:06] melchizedek was that jesus was the
[21:08] tabernacle that god dwelled in the flesh
[21:10] man and this man had no father no mother
[21:12] no beginning of days or ending of life
[21:15] but it was the self-same person it was
[21:17] melchizedek melchizedek and jesus and
[21:20] was one but jesus was the earthly body
[21:23] born and fashioned after sin
[21:27] what was that god and morphing himself
[21:29] coming down and brother bible said we
[21:30] find the word in morphe in greek which
[21:32] means the unseen was made visible
[21:35] he changed itself he come down
[21:38] and morphy means something that cannot
[21:40] be seen yet
[21:42] it's there and then it's changed
[21:46] and the eye can catch it
[21:48] that god is actually unfolding himself
[21:51] like i got a picture of a leaf unfolding
[21:53] himself and you know once it's finally
[21:55] unfolded you can see it
[21:57] it like
[21:58] unfurls to reveal itself and bill graham
[22:01] said in the testimony of jesus christ he
[22:03] said he's just unfolding himself
[22:06] from a sacred light above the people
[22:09] down into a holy body to redeem people
[22:13] then out into born-again believers
[22:16] the same god
[22:18] now that's the revelation of the godhead
[22:20] it's the same god all the time unfolding
[22:23] himself revealing himself
[22:26] god changed himself changed his changes
[22:29] his form brother said in the unveiling
[22:30] of god
[22:32] when the in morphe that means he changed
[22:34] himself he come down
[22:36] from something that could not be seen
[22:38] then it's changed and the eye can catch
[22:40] it like in brother and and who was this
[22:42] melchizedek he said when you got a
[22:44] sculpture you know somebody makes a
[22:46] sculpture they they they hide it with a
[22:48] mask over it when they they're slowly
[22:50] revealing it they take it they take the
[22:52] mask off and then they reveal what's
[22:54] underneath the
[22:55] the thing covering it and god promised
[22:58] in this day at the end of this laodicean
[23:00] church he would take the mask off the
[23:02] whole thing
[23:04] like what's happening with that little
[23:06] that leaf that's unfolding to reveal
[23:09] what was in god's thought before the
[23:11] foundation of the world god and morphe
[23:13] masked in the pillar of fire
[23:15] masked in a man called jesus
[23:18] in morphy in his church
[23:20] god above us god with us god in us the
[23:23] condescending of god
[23:25] so he said again and we would see jesus
[23:27] he said in the beginning god was a
[23:29] spirit and all the fountain of goodness
[23:31] and mercy and power and all the good
[23:33] things of love
[23:35] god was the center of that fountain
[23:38] and then the logos that went out of god
[23:39] in the beginning become what we call a
[23:41] theophany
[23:43] or supernatural body
[23:45] god is just not like the heir but he's
[23:48] in a body and in hebrews chapter four he
[23:51] said in the beginning was the same he
[23:52] was that great spirit found where all
[23:55] the trueness all the love all the peace
[23:58] everything that was pure was in this
[24:00] fountain
[24:01] it began to form a body a theophany the
[24:04] kind of body that we go to
[24:07] so we start talking about a theophany
[24:09] a body
[24:10] a word body
[24:12] a word body is actually what christ is
[24:14] sowing that's why the son of man is the
[24:16] only sower of the word is because the
[24:18] word the word is god is unfolding
[24:21] himself
[24:22] and as he's as he's so in the word
[24:24] you're becoming you you see you bypass
[24:26] that theophany you come here without
[24:29] that theophany but but the word is
[24:31] actually what's
[24:32] what's bringing you back to that
[24:35] but the board says in ephesians 2 12 at
[24:37] that time you were without christ
[24:40] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[24:42] israel and strangers from the covenants
[24:44] of promise when you come into the world
[24:45] you are without christ but now in christ
[24:48] jesus you you who sometimes were far off
[24:52] are made nigh by the blood of christ
[24:54] connected back to the word that the word
[24:56] is is made manifest in your members
[25:04] now the musicians can go ahead and come
[25:06] forward we're going to stop here and
[25:08] continue on that on that note on the
[25:09] next time
[25:10] and talk about
[25:12] how you what a theophany is and that
[25:15] there's one body
[25:17] one body
[25:19] that see in galatians 3 16 it says now
[25:21] to abraham and his seed where the
[25:23] promise is made he saith not into seeds
[25:26] as a meanie but as of one unto thy seed
[25:29] to thy seed
[25:30] which is christ
[25:32] and there you get into what that
[25:33] predestinated seed is the seed is christ
[25:36] the seed is always christ the seed the
[25:39] seed that you hear the the word that
[25:41] we're hearing is christ and we'll just
[25:43] stop right there god bless you
[25:46] [Applause]
