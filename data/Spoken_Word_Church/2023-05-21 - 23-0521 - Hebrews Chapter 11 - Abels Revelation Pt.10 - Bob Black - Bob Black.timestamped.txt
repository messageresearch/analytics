[0:00] Luke 17 6. says Jesus said the Lord the
[0:04] Lord said if he had Faith as a grain of
[0:06] mustard seed you might say unto this
[0:08] sycam entry be thou plucked up by the
[0:11] root and beat our planet and the sea
[0:13] and it should obey you now to think
[0:16] about that this morning that that really
[0:17] God's looking for some good ground to
[0:20] plant his word in somebody to just take
[0:21] his take the word and believe it just
[0:23] like planting a little small something
[0:25] as small as a mustard seed that's just
[0:28] pure
[0:29] nothing mixed with it won't mix with
[0:31] anything else but if you just have some
[0:32] Faith something's going to happen as we
[0:35] as we've been studying out looking at
[0:36] Abel how he brought his faith and
[0:39] brought a sacrifice and God God came on
[0:41] the scene with us in a supernatural way
[0:42] and proved that his faith was correct
[0:45] and and as we study these things out
[0:47] going through the book of the the
[0:49] chapter chapter 11.
[0:51] that's really you you you come to God
[0:54] with faith believing what he said
[0:55] believing what he promised and God will
[0:57] come behind and vindicate it and prove
[1:00] I'm in the message expectation brother
[1:02] Brown said you know some people has
[1:03] great big Faith like that they can be
[1:05] healed in a moment
[1:07] some has faith that much can be healed
[1:09] in a week some has Mustard Seed Faith
[1:12] takes them a long time
[1:13] but just follow it it's genuine it'll
[1:17] bring you to the light just hold on to
[1:20] it and keep moving
[1:21] and it'll bring you out you just keep
[1:23] holding on to that Faith it'll bring you
[1:25] through if it's real mustard seed you
[1:28] know mustard don't mix with nothing it's
[1:30] genuine you can mix kale with spinach
[1:32] and so forth but you can't mix mustard
[1:34] with nothing mustard stays mustard I
[1:39] ought to think that this morning that if
[1:40] you have faith you just stay with it
[1:42] don't mix it with any doubt or anything
[1:44] and it's going to produce
[1:46] and to think that we've got promises
[1:48] like that we can grab a hold too and you
[1:50] if you need healing or salvation or
[1:52] that's refilling this morning you come
[1:54] believing and God will give it to you
[1:57] Lord Jesus we're so grateful this
[1:59] morning to be able to gather around your
[2:00] word and we just ask the Lord that
[2:01] you'll just bless our little study this
[2:03] morning as we prepare our hearts Lord to
[2:05] receive the main course we ask the Lord
[2:08] that you'll just be with Brother Willie
[2:09] as he's studying and preparing Lord God
[2:11] prepare our hearts Lord prepare the
[2:13] ministry prepare everything this morning
[2:15] Lord Jesus you'll just feel at Liberty
[2:17] to help us this morning we ask it in
[2:18] your name amen
[2:20] so we got to Hebrews 11 verse 4 that
[2:23] says by faith Abel offered unto God a
[2:26] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[2:28] which he obtained witness that he was
[2:30] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[2:33] and by he being dead yes speaketh now
[2:37] brother Brown would say in the message
[2:39] presuming he'd say you know we've been
[2:41] kind of looking at the comparison
[2:42] between Cain and Abel and he said how
[2:45] did Cain when he made an altar just as
[2:46] pretty or prettier than Abel's he
[2:48] offered fruits he gave his tithes he
[2:50] brought his income into the house of the
[2:51] Lord he knelt on the altar he bowed
[2:54] himself he prayed he worshiped just as
[2:56] sincere as any man
[2:58] but God Vindicated Abel by consuming his
[3:01] sacrifice oh you look at it can't just
[3:04] come with an intellectual understanding
[3:06] but Abel brought something based on a
[3:08] revelation you see when you come to God
[3:09] with faith with a revelation with with a
[3:13] real genuine faith God will come behind
[3:16] it and vindicate it supernaturally God
[3:18] will vindicate real super real genuine
[3:21] Faith by changing your life by filling
[3:23] you with the Holy Ghost by healing Your
[3:24] Body by he's going to vindicate our
[3:27] faith in a body change by changing her
[3:29] body because we believe in a
[3:30] supernatural God that will come behind
[3:32] Supernatural Faith that's given by a
[3:35] supernatural God and do something
[3:38] and the angel of God message brother
[3:41] around said now if I make these
[3:42] statements and there I just make them
[3:43] myself there's nothing of that happen
[3:45] then don't believe it because my words
[3:46] will be untrue anybody can make a
[3:48] statement but when it's a real genuine
[3:50] Faith something's going to happen but if
[3:52] I make up those statements and God backs
[3:54] that up then that's God's testimony to
[3:56] it is that right that's God's testimony
[3:58] only saying that it is true well then if
[4:01] God says it's true and confirming the
[4:03] word with signs and wonders following
[4:05] isn't that what you prayed for for years
[4:06] see we're comparing that with what what
[4:09] happened with Abel's with Abel because
[4:10] we read the quote last time about how
[4:12] brother Brown said that God confirmed
[4:14] Abel's faith is Sacrifice by consuming
[4:17] the sacrifice with fire
[4:19] compare that with the new birth that
[4:21] when you believe God will give you the
[4:22] Holy Ghost and Fire
[4:24] that which you can run it all the way
[4:26] down through the scriptures how all the
[4:28] times that God Vindicated Faith by
[4:30] consuming it Gideon sacrificed Solomon's
[4:33] sacrifice Moses sacrificed all the way
[4:35] down to the scripture because he's the
[4:36] same yesterday today and forever he
[4:38] comes and vindicates it supernaturally
[4:41] so that is that is God's testimony
[4:45] backing up God when we will come we'll
[4:48] come with our confession saying well
[4:49] Lord I believe your word but then God
[4:51] comes and when God speaks he'll speak
[4:54] through your life
[4:55] lived voices God God uh given you a
[4:59] testimony that speaks louder than any
[5:01] any sermon that could be preached but
[5:03] God speaks it's a testimony a
[5:05] supernatural testimony of vindication of
[5:07] your faith and brother man will say you
[5:10] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ accept
[5:12] him as your personal Savior and then
[5:13] receive the Holy Ghost and until you
[5:15] receive the Holy Ghost God has never
[5:16] recognized your faith and another place
[5:19] he said now you're a Believer but God
[5:20] doesn't recognize your faith until he
[5:22] proves it to you it might be recognized
[5:24] in your own thoughts but when it comes
[5:26] into God's thoughts God seals that Faith
[5:28] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:30] and another place he said that's the
[5:32] same thing it is when God recognizes
[5:34] your faith and he cuts the world off of
[5:37] you and give you the Holy Ghost and you
[5:38] really believe God then for whatever he
[5:40] says oh you see when God comes and
[5:43] testifies that your faith is real then
[5:45] something Supernatural is taking place
[5:47] and I will restore brother and said now
[5:50] look what Cain done when he's seen his
[5:52] brother was accepted his brother had
[5:54] this Supernatural Revelation that's what
[5:56] we're believing here this morning for
[5:58] isn't it something Supernatural a
[6:00] supernatural testimony from God a
[6:01] supernatural God speaking back in a
[6:03] supernatural way and then that made Cain
[6:06] jealous then he was jealous over him and
[6:08] sought away to kill him
[6:10] and what is Supernatural Supernatural is
[6:12] a manifestation or event attributed to
[6:15] some Force Beyond scientific
[6:17] understanding of the laws of nature it's
[6:19] something Supernatural happened when God
[6:21] gets a hold of a man that's stubborn and
[6:23] and uh got a hard heart and can soften
[6:26] them up to where they want to come to
[6:27] the Altar and give their hearts to God
[6:29] is something Supernatural when God
[6:30] begins to change your life so he ain't
[6:33] the way that you used to be something
[6:34] Supernatural when God can take a
[6:36] somebody that's sick and got problems
[6:38] with their bones and problem ailments
[6:40] and and God can raise that person up and
[6:42] cast out the cancer something
[6:44] Supernatural when God comes behind your
[6:46] faith and proves that you really believe
[6:48] God
[6:49] I got to read and the faith is the
[6:51] substance uh last night just kind of
[6:53] preparing that you think about what
[6:55] faith will do brother Brown said if you
[6:57] he said I I know I got my pocket knife
[6:59] in my pocket but if it ain't there faith
[7:02] will put it there you think about the
[7:04] power that's behind Faith a real
[7:05] Revelation from God faith will change
[7:08] things
[7:09] right my brother around was like he said
[7:12] some more things that I got written down
[7:13] he said he'd give always His prophets
[7:15] the supernatural sign to vindicate that
[7:17] it was God and them for there cannot be
[7:19] the presence of God without Supernatural
[7:21] things happening never did Jehovah ever
[7:24] appear without the supernatural
[7:26] following him it has to be so he had
[7:28] always Vindicated himself that he was
[7:31] with these prophets by confirming what
[7:33] they were prophesying of if it was
[7:35] according to his word and another place
[7:37] he said there's always been signs and
[7:40] wonders that vindicate his presence no
[7:41] matter what you think about that this
[7:43] morning why do signs and wonders follow
[7:45] them that believe because if the word is
[7:48] planted all these promises that are
[7:50] laying here in the Bible where if he
[7:52] said he'd he'd he'd cover over your your
[7:54] sin and he'd said he'd heal you and he
[7:56] said he'd change you and all these
[7:58] things when when that word is planted in
[8:00] your heart and it comes up it's a
[8:02] supernatural sign that the things that
[8:05] God promised are true that he's going to
[8:07] keep his word that he's going to back it
[8:08] up you believe leave God's word and see
[8:11] if he don't come and back it up
[8:13] and God have indicated Jesus Christ by
[8:15] signs and wonders there's another
[8:16] another thing that brother Brown said he
[8:18] said he have Vindicated Israel by
[8:20] Supernatural signs and wonders he have
[8:22] Vindicated his church all the way
[8:24] through by signs and wonders watch here
[8:27] now in this last day
[8:28] and another place he said brother God
[8:30] has always Vindicated his church with
[8:33] signs and wonders from Genesis to going
[8:34] out of Revelation no matter what their
[8:36] teachings being God has always hung that
[8:38] Pillar of Fire over the Israelites he
[8:41] was with Jesus Christ he with the church
[8:43] here he was with the disciples God
[8:46] proven his word all the way
[8:48] and does God ever change his mind about
[8:51] his word he said notice it's always
[8:53] caused the natural to hate the spiritual
[8:55] it caused Cain to hate Abel it caused
[8:58] Coral to hate Moses it caused Judas to
[9:01] hate Jesus and on and on it goes It
[9:04] causes the naturals to hate the
[9:06] spiritual Justice Cain at the beginning
[9:08] hated Abel the one that God received the
[9:10] Sacrifice from and tries to destroy them
[9:13] even they try to destroy the influence
[9:15] they try to destroy everything because
[9:17] it's nothing but jealousy it started in
[9:20] Cain and proved that it was jealousy and
[9:22] is still the same today when the natural
[9:24] the carnal and the spiritual meet
[9:26] together it proves it's Satan no other
[9:28] way because jealousy comes from Satan
[9:31] and then causes an impersonation of the
[9:33] truth somebody to try to impersonate
[9:36] something that isn't they are not
[9:37] ordained to do how much of that have we
[9:39] seen in the last days oh my how much of
[9:43] it
[9:44] so if we're going to study study just
[9:46] kind of briefly the the little story of
[9:48] Abel that we've been kind of looking
[9:49] through Cain in Genesis chapter 4 verse
[9:52] 8 to 11 and Cain talked with Abel his
[9:54] brother
[9:55] and it came to pass oh you think about
[9:57] what they must have talked about many
[9:59] times we'll talk to somebody and when
[10:01] somebody when somebody begins to hear
[10:03] you unfold the the things about the
[10:06] serpent seed and so forth that's it'll
[10:07] stir somebody up
[10:09] Cain talked with Abel his brother and it
[10:12] came to pass when they were in the field
[10:13] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[10:15] brother and slew him and and the Lord
[10:17] said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother
[10:20] and he said I know not am I My Brother's
[10:23] Keeper
[10:24] and he said what has thou done the voice
[10:27] of thy brother's blood crieth under me
[10:29] from the ground
[10:31] and then in verse 4 of Hebrews 11 by it
[10:34] being dead yes speak you think about
[10:35] that in Genesis 4 10 it says what has
[10:38] thou done the voice of thy brother's
[10:40] blood crieth unto me from the ground
[10:43] and brother Brown in the message the
[10:45] token he said see Abel he was a
[10:47] righteous man
[10:48] he died he died innocent because he was
[10:51] in the way
[10:53] he was in the way standing for the real
[10:56] Revelation he had
[10:57] he spoke he cried out the Justice blood
[11:02] of Abel cried out against Cain
[11:05] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[11:07] cried out it redeemed a man that
[11:10] speaketh better things it makes you Sons
[11:13] and Daughters it hides you from the
[11:16] wrath of God
[11:17] see the blood of Abel cannot hide can
[11:19] see but the blood of Jesus Christ can
[11:22] no you think you think about what Abel's
[11:24] blood was speaking that we all we all
[11:27] need to say we need somebody to cover us
[11:29] up we're all born wrong and then Cain
[11:32] rose up and and killed Abel
[11:35] and his blood was was speaking back that
[11:37] that what he stood for was correct you
[11:40] think the blood of Abel still speaks
[11:41] that sin is serious that we all we all
[11:44] must answer to God
[11:45] the blood of Abel still speaks that God
[11:47] is just and that he will punish those
[11:49] who sin
[11:50] brother Brown said the Justice blood of
[11:52] Abel cried out against Cain
[11:55] and the message the token he said blood
[11:57] speaks did we say does the blood speak
[11:59] can it speak the token speak yes sir
[12:03] if we'd look in Genesis 4 10 the voice
[12:05] of the blood of Abel cried out against
[12:07] King we find out in Hebrews 12 24 that
[12:10] the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better
[12:12] things
[12:13] the blood speaks how can the chemistry
[12:15] speak it's the life
[12:17] that's in the blood that does the
[12:19] speaking
[12:20] the soul that was in Abel it was the
[12:23] life that was in Christ that cries out
[12:25] better things than any he said it speaks
[12:27] and it speaks loud it's the Holy Spirit
[12:29] it speaks plain it tells us that the
[12:31] time is here when we see it where it
[12:33] said it was said and then we see it come
[12:35] back and identify what it said there's
[12:38] nothing else left but believe it that's
[12:41] right
[12:42] to receive it
[12:44] another another quote around said in the
[12:46] message token he said but the blood of
[12:47] Jesus Christ not only cried out it
[12:50] redeemed it speaketh better things it
[12:52] makes you Sons and Daughters it hides
[12:55] you from the wrath of God see the blood
[12:57] of Abel could not hide can see but the
[12:59] blood of Jesus can
[13:01] so o Cain come out today if you've been
[13:04] a persecutor against the word and say
[13:06] days of Miracles has passed this thing
[13:09] is all nonsense and things it's crying
[13:11] out you see the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:14] cries out but there's forgiveness in it
[13:16] if you'll just accept it I wish we could
[13:18] stay a little while on that see blood
[13:20] speaks a better thing aren't you glad
[13:23] this morning that we've got a covering
[13:24] that we can have faith in that we have
[13:25] confidence in that or to think that he's
[13:28] saying that the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:30] now could cover Cain
[13:32] if there's any canes here this morning
[13:34] you've got a covering if you just
[13:37] accepted
[13:38] rolled around and said look then we
[13:39] realize and present the token the life
[13:41] it took for the token the blood speaks
[13:43] for us remember the Covenant blood was
[13:46] recognized with the token and the word
[13:47] assures us of the promise the token is
[13:50] the sign that the purchase is made for
[13:52] us now if you're not included in that
[13:55] well of course you'll never get nothing
[13:59] you're just walking through a prayer
[14:01] line walking back out walking up to the
[14:03] Altar and looking back walking back out
[14:04] but oh brother when that token is once
[14:07] placed in your heart and you know it's
[14:09] the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you
[14:12] something is happening
[14:15] he said again in the token he said sure
[14:17] the blood speaks it speaks a better
[14:19] thing the Old Testament the blood spoke
[14:21] of guilt and the New Testament it speaks
[14:24] of redemption and the Old Testament it
[14:26] spoke of death and sorrow and the New
[14:29] Testament it speaks of resurrection and
[14:31] life it speaks of healing it speaks of
[14:34] Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life
[14:37] it speaks of heaven and that same blood
[14:40] that was shed upon the ground that
[14:41] called out after his dead brother or
[14:43] call out after his brother that killed
[14:45] him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all
[14:48] our sins and speaks peace and
[14:50] resurrection and power and life and
[14:52] healing
[14:53] and all the Redemptive blessings that
[14:55] the blood was shed for it speaks for us
[14:58] certainly the blood speaks
[15:02] oh my let's let's keep going and then in
[15:05] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 by faith Abel
[15:08] offered unto God a more excellent
[15:09] sacrifice than came by which he obtained
[15:11] witness that he was righteous God
[15:14] testifying of his gifts and by it being
[15:16] dead yet speak it Faith but brother
[15:19] Brown said what is faith faith is
[15:20] something that's revealed to you that is
[15:23] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[15:26] is a revelation of the will of God and
[15:29] that's how Faith Abel knew how to
[15:31] sacrifice what to sacrifice how to get
[15:33] back into fellowship with God Is by a
[15:35] revelation that showed him the will of
[15:37] God and sitting here this morning Faith
[15:39] a revelation from God will show you the
[15:41] trajectory of a life he'll show you your
[15:43] what your purpose of being here is for
[15:45] show you it'll show you faith will show
[15:48] you what where to where to get a job
[15:49] what church to go to who to marry faith
[15:52] will show you where where you need to go
[15:54] and the statue of perfect man he said
[15:56] all Christianity all you are all you'll
[15:59] ever be is based upon faith in the word
[16:03] that's the reason I believe the word oh
[16:05] my you see think about how important the
[16:07] Bible is to us and how important going
[16:09] to church is because our whole our whole
[16:12] existence is based upon Faith all you'll
[16:15] ever be is based upon faith in the word
[16:21] and that's how all these great soldiers
[16:23] of faith overcame by faith
[16:27] by faith anything was translated that he
[16:30] should not see death and was not found
[16:31] because God had translated him for
[16:33] before his translation he had this
[16:36] testimony that he pleased God how did he
[16:38] please God because of his faith because
[16:40] without faith you can't you can't please
[16:42] God now you think about this Monument I
[16:44] got a nice little picture here looking
[16:46] down for at the Capstone that that
[16:47] wasn't put on you think about that Enoch
[16:51] built this thing as a monument of of
[16:54] Faith how to get out of here that as you
[16:56] hear the word your faith is built up to
[16:58] the point where you can begin to believe
[17:00] that all things are possible
[17:03] and the ten virgins at 104 44 000
[17:05] brother Brian said oh God May someday
[17:07] the church which is a type of Enoch 500
[17:10] years he walked before God walking
[17:11] walking in the light with a testimony
[17:13] that everything that God said he did it
[17:17] he didn't displease him what the Lord
[17:19] said Enoch done it
[17:22] in the Easter seal he said that was a
[17:24] man weighed Long Ago by the name of
[17:26] Enoch when a new thing come along when
[17:28] something come along and said well now
[17:29] we have to go back to the old school or
[17:31] this that or the other Enoch walked with
[17:34] God whatever God said do Enoch never
[17:37] missed one word
[17:38] a walk with god what was he he was a Son
[17:42] of God he was an eagle that had been
[17:43] called to that day and when come time he
[17:46] was so full of that quickening power
[17:48] remember he had walked 500 years or more
[17:50] before God and not one time had he
[17:54] missed his word
[17:55] oh that's that's what God is calling to
[17:57] us as brother boy he's been preaching on
[17:59] the Statue of a perfect man and coming
[18:01] to a revelation of the son of man God's
[18:03] calling us to a place where you don't
[18:05] miss the word that you believe every
[18:06] word of God not one time did he
[18:09] misbehave himself he's calling us to a
[18:11] place where we've got the same patience
[18:13] and the same Temperance of God not one
[18:15] time did he do but kept the testimony
[18:18] everything that God told him to do he
[18:21] went and done it oh we've got to have
[18:24] that same testimony that when God's God
[18:26] calls you to repentance you do it when
[18:28] God calls you to baptism you do it when
[18:30] God says you've got to be born again you
[18:32] do it when God says you gotta you gotta
[18:34] have these virtues you do it and then
[18:36] you can have that same testimony that
[18:37] Ena can no argument about it he just
[18:40] went and done it no matter what anybody
[18:42] else thought he went and done it
[18:45] because he believed God
[18:46] he was full of that quickening power and
[18:49] when it come time for the old man to die
[18:51] God just sent down the ladder and he
[18:52] walked up home
[18:55] and the true Easter seal he said that
[18:57] talking about those those stones that
[18:59] Enoch erected they weighed tons and tons
[19:01] up there how they ever got them up
[19:03] that's still a mystery to man but they
[19:05] take this razor blade and can run run
[19:07] along and it's so honed out so perfect
[19:09] until you can't even put a razor blade
[19:12] where mortar should be now that's what
[19:14] God is doing to his church he's holding
[19:17] off the people
[19:18] and making it in such a perfect way that
[19:21] when The Headstone Christ comes it fits
[19:25] the building together and then a
[19:26] resurrection of the whole thing the
[19:29] church has gone up that's how Enoch went
[19:32] up and if Enoch went up by faith and
[19:33] we'll go up by faith believe in what God
[19:36] promised that's what brother Randall
[19:38] said and why I'm against organized
[19:40] religion he said that's the way God does
[19:41] the church he beats every Creed every
[19:44] denomination every man-made Dogma until
[19:47] he sees his own life reflecting in you
[19:51] if I don't do the works of my father
[19:52] believe me not see well if what is
[19:54] purpose to the church the life that was
[19:57] in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't
[20:00] you stand still until you haven't got if
[20:02] you haven't got patience virtue all
[20:05] these things and Temperance and things
[20:07] and godliness and brotherly kindness and
[20:10] all these things that's required of you
[20:14] ought to think about this morning that
[20:15] those things are required of us and
[20:17] Enoch had that testimony that he had
[20:19] done everything that God required of him
[20:21] no matter what you've done no matter how
[20:24] much you've shouted how many churches
[20:25] you joined how many feathers you've
[20:27] pinned into yourself don't do it wait
[20:29] till genuinely from your heart
[20:33] what's he saying you can act just like
[20:35] Jesus you can forgive till in your heart
[20:38] you have brotherly kindness no matter if
[20:41] they pull a handful of beard from one
[20:43] side you can turn the other cheek with
[20:45] sweetness see until those virtues no
[20:49] matter what they say to you right that's
[20:52] that that's that Monument out in the
[20:53] desert that Enoch built a monument of
[20:55] faith that he believed God and did
[20:58] everything that God required until he
[20:59] just walked off the Earth by faith in it
[21:02] this is what Paul said Enoch was
[21:04] translated that he should not see death
[21:06] and was not found because God had
[21:08] translated him for for before his
[21:10] translation he had this testimony that
[21:13] he pleased God how do you please God
[21:15] this morning without faith it is
[21:18] impossible to please him for he that
[21:21] cometh to God must believe that he is
[21:22] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[21:24] diligently seek him
[21:27] you know even even when you tell your
[21:30] kids something if they have confidence
[21:31] it's such a such a blessing to see them
[21:34] believe what you tell them if you
[21:36] promise them that I'm gonna pay for your
[21:39] schooling and they believe you they're
[21:41] they're believing what you say when you
[21:43] tell them I'm going to do something for
[21:44] you and they believe that's how we
[21:46] please God when he said when he gives us
[21:48] a promise and says I'm going to give you
[21:50] the Holy Ghost and you battle through it
[21:51] like Brother Willie was was preaching
[21:53] about yesterday no matter no matter what
[21:55] the circumstances look like you believe
[21:57] you believe God no matter what that's
[22:00] pleasing to God because if if you come
[22:03] to God you've got to believe that he is
[22:05] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[22:07] diligently seek him you got to believe
[22:09] that if you come with faith that he's
[22:11] going to back up his word you got to
[22:13] believe he'll reward you if you believe
[22:15] him
[22:17] oh to think about this morning if you
[22:19] have a need if you have a need as we
[22:21] prepare our hearts for the for the song
[22:23] service and for the word if you have a
[22:25] need this morning you come with faith he
[22:27] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[22:29] seek him and not not just seek him
[22:31] half-heartedly but if you'll just put
[22:33] everything into it like like we were
[22:35] preaching Wednesday night about get in
[22:37] the spirit if you really want something
[22:39] from God you begin to enter in and and
[22:42] think about what God promised and think
[22:44] about that these promises are laying
[22:45] there for somebody somebody's going to
[22:48] get these promises so it might as well
[22:49] be you because he is a rewarder of them
[22:52] that diligently seek him
[22:55] brother Brown said and believe in God he
[22:58] said now if we are born of our Heavenly
[22:59] Father God who calls those things which
[23:01] are not as though they were there's got
[23:03] to be something in us like that see
[23:04] that's the reason that a real
[23:07] consecrated Christian that's all out for
[23:09] God looks to what God Said instead of
[23:12] what you see or feel that's the Earthly
[23:15] man there if we walk in the flesh we
[23:17] can't please God but we're not walking
[23:19] by the flesh this morning all we walk
[23:21] we're walking by the spirit we're not
[23:23] looking at the things that we can see
[23:24] with our natural eyes but we're looking
[23:26] by at what we can see by faith and we'll
[23:30] stop with as the musicians come forward
[23:31] he said you can't have anything from God
[23:33] Only By Faith by faith the walls of
[23:36] Jericho fell by faith Moses refused to
[23:39] be called the son of Pharaoh's Daughter
[23:41] by faith Gideon and so and so by faith
[23:44] only way and without faith it's
[23:46] impossible to please God and if you want
[23:49] to please him you must come to him with
[23:51] faith believing his word is true so
[23:54] let's believe God and you'll see
[23:56] something happen God bless you this
[23:58] morning
