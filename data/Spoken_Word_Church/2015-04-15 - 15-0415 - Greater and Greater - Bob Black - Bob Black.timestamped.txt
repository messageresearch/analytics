[3:44] chapter
[3:45] 21 verse
[3:47] 19 and also 1 Peter chapter 2 veres 1-
[3:57] 2 set up
[4:03] thank
[4:07] you I I just count it such a great
[4:10] privilege to get to speak to y'all CU
[4:15] I what I've been kind of meditating on
[4:18] um you know as as brother Dale kind of
[4:20] mentioned last Sunday that we we got a
[4:22] little opportunity to go to speak to
[4:24] some brothers from Guatemala down in
[4:26] Mobile last time and um I told Brother
[4:29] Matthew I was just tagging along the
[4:30] support but he he got all the ministers
[4:32] up there to say a few remarks and and um
[4:36] what I shared with them I I I want to
[4:38] share with you
[4:40] tonight but I you know I when when I
[4:44] look I I I read about how brother
[4:45] Brandon would in his early Ministry he
[4:48] would take a picture of the congregation
[4:49] and he said I take this picture and I go
[4:51] and pray for you and you know you just
[4:54] looking out you see people from all
[4:56] different walks of life that have come
[4:57] together and and from all different
[5:00] scenarios and things and and I wonder if
[5:03] we realize what a great group of people
[5:07] because of what has God God has done for
[5:11] us y'all bear with me a second when I
[5:15] when I get fool I get
[5:22] leaky but let's uh before we go get into
[5:25] the word let's just go to the Lord in
[5:26] prayer real
[5:28] quick Lord Jesus we just thank you God
[5:30] for your grace and mercy to us thank you
[5:33] God for the hour that we live in for the
[5:36] word that you've given to us
[5:38] Lord and I pray God that you will be
[5:41] with us tonight Lord because Lord we
[5:43] haven't come together to fellowship with
[5:45] one another to see me or or those things
[5:48] but we come to fellowship with you to
[5:51] Fellowship around your word to hear from
[5:54] you Lord Jesus and I pray oh God that
[5:56] you'll Lord this time that we've come
[5:59] come together from Far places Lord Jesus
[6:01] that this time won't be wasted Lord that
[6:03] you'll open our eyes to see more of you
[6:06] and see more of our position in you Lord
[6:08] Jesus and where we've come from and what
[6:10] you've done for us Lord grant it you'll
[6:13] bless everyone here Lord Jesus we ask in
[6:15] the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:20] Christ I came
[6:23] prepared Matthew 21:
[6:28] 19 and when he saw a fig tree in the
[6:31] way he came to it and found nothing
[6:34] their own but leaves
[6:36] only and said unto it let no let no
[6:40] fruit grow on thee henceforward
[6:42] forever and presently the Fig Tree
[6:44] withered
[6:46] away in 1 Peter chapter
[6:48] 2 verses 1-
[6:51] 2 wherefore laying aside all
[6:54] malice and all G and hypocrisies and
[6:58] envies and all evil speakings as newborn
[7:01] babies desire the sincere milk of the
[7:04] word that ye may grow thereby you may be
[7:09] seated the Lord out his Blessing to the
[7:10] reading of the
[7:15] word now down there in in that little
[7:17] Guam Bon group they were we just had a
[7:20] wonderful time of Fellowship they they
[7:21] were so humble and um and you know that
[7:25] is a little group that had came from
[7:27] from the ends of the Earth really
[7:29] and they many of them came to America
[7:32] and and then discovered the message
[7:34] after they came and we talked to one
[7:37] brother that had walked all the way to
[7:40] the United States from Guatemala they
[7:43] got on trains and different things but
[7:45] he came that way you know not not by
[7:48] plane or anything and they ended up um
[7:52] you know maybe maybe tonight many of us
[7:55] are tired and weary but you know we all
[7:57] got together at midnight and that's when
[7:59] Church
[8:01] started because of the of the situation
[8:03] down there but just remember that little
[8:05] group in prayer when you think about it
[8:08] but I wondered when I when I was
[8:10] speaking to them I I the Lord just kind
[8:12] of laid it on my heart this little
[8:13] scripture wherefore laying aside all
[8:15] malice and all G and hypocrisies and
[8:17] envies and all evil speakings as newborn
[8:21] babes desire the sincere milk of the
[8:23] word that you may grow thereby because
[8:26] first of all we've got to lay aside
[8:28] everything every weight of this world
[8:31] that so easily possess us just like Abel
[8:34] when he came and brought his
[8:38] offering he he didn't just lay his
[8:40] offering on this altar but he laid
[8:41] himself up there as well and that's how
[8:44] we do we've got to lay every everything
[8:46] down
[8:47] everything y'all bear with
[8:51] me
[8:55] Hallelujah lay aside all malice and all
[8:58] G and oces and envies and all evil
[9:00] speakings all hypocrisies you know when
[9:03] when Jesus looked and he saw Nathaniel
[9:05] coming he said behold here is the
[9:06] Israelite and whom is no G somebody that
[9:09] there's nothing nothing in this man that
[9:11] that's contrary he just he's he's what
[9:13] you see is what you get and that's the
[9:15] kind of person that that that can do
[9:18] something with God can do something with
[9:20] you lay aside all malice and all G and
[9:23] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[9:26] speakings I was telling some of the
[9:28] brothers that this week at work I went
[9:30] through the kind of the review process
[9:32] and and I I kind of started thinking
[9:34] what isn't it a paradox that in the just
[9:37] the natural not even talking about the
[9:39] stature of perfect man or anything but
[9:41] in the natural you can have a grown man
[9:43] that act still acts like a child or a
[9:45] grown woman that still acts like a child
[9:48] and what a strange thing that is now
[9:52] spiritually speaking God doesn't want us
[9:54] to be babies he wants us to grow up into
[9:57] maturity so that we can we'll know what
[9:59] we're talking about so we know what what
[10:01] who he is and who we are so we know
[10:04] God's plan for us amen and the way that
[10:07] we grow is is starting off by the
[10:09] sincere milk of the word and we grow up
[10:11] and we eat and and take in God's word
[10:14] and until we're eating steak until we're
[10:16] coming to a place where we're like like
[10:19] Jeremiah and David said like a tree
[10:21] that's planted by the rivers of water
[10:22] where it's roots go down anchor deep
[10:25] into the earth into the into the word of
[10:28] into God's word and when we grow up
[10:31] straight and strong and knowing like
[10:33] like brother Bram said that what we
[10:35] should be is giants in the gospel we
[10:38] shouldn't just be adults we should be
[10:39] Giants and and he you know to to my
[10:43] shame we we I should know more about the
[10:46] message I should know more about the
[10:48] Bible we should all know more
[10:53] than because we should think about where
[10:56] where we are today and what's going on
[10:58] in the world and and
[11:02] and do you know what I'm what I'm kind
[11:05] of thinking on is do we know who we are
[11:09] that's
[11:10] it so over in
[11:14] Matthew let me stay on hold on let me
[11:16] stay on First Peter a second
[11:18] more as newborn babes desire the sincere
[11:21] milk of the word that you may grow
[11:23] thereby and you just keep reading on
[11:24] down if so be you have tasted that the
[11:26] Lord is
[11:27] gracious and we got a little bit on this
[11:30] in in the Sunday school class to whom
[11:32] coming is unto a living Stone disallowed
[11:34] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[11:36] precious you also as Lively stones are
[11:39] built up a spiritual house and holy
[11:42] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[11:45] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[11:48] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[11:50] the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[11:53] Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[11:55] that believeth on him shall not be
[11:57] confounded he shall not be confounded by
[12:01] who he is and and what's going on you
[12:03] you see many people look upon the bride
[12:05] of Christ today and and just see
[12:07] something maybe wrapped in Badger skin
[12:09] something something just common and and
[12:12] can't understand don't get a revelation
[12:14] of what's going on but we should be so
[12:17] thankful that we see we have the
[12:19] revelation of God's word for this day
[12:22] and see uh what he's given to us all
[12:25] right let me jump over to
[12:27] Matthew Matthew 21 19 and and and this
[12:30] is story is also told in Mark
[12:34] 11:13 when he saw a fig tree in the
[12:37] way he came to it and found nothing
[12:40] there on but leaves only and said unto
[12:43] it let no fruit grow on the hence
[12:45] Forward Forever and presently the Fig
[12:48] Tree withered away right you know here's
[12:51] a
[12:52] man that God is both God and man and he
[12:58] he came came he he's walking down the
[13:00] road and he gets hungry and he goes
[13:04] looking for food now this is the man
[13:06] that that took fishes and bread and
[13:09] pulled them apart in his hand and began
[13:10] to Dole them out to people and that
[13:12] creative act is what identified him when
[13:15] he was walking on the road to amas with
[13:17] the with the disciples that on that
[13:18] Resurrection morning what identified
[13:21] with him was when he went into the
[13:23] secret place and shut the door and they
[13:24] entered in with him and he did something
[13:26] that identified him he began to break
[13:29] the bread in the way that was known to
[13:31] them and then identified him them him
[13:34] and now now this man this God man that
[13:36] could speak and raise Lazarus from the
[13:38] grave he he walks up to this fig tree
[13:41] and such a strange story that even
[13:43] brother brandham said it it always kind
[13:45] of always had a question about it until
[13:48] the Lord answered uh his question what
[13:51] was going on with this fig tree how is
[13:53] it that he can speak and the Fig Tree
[13:55] would W in The Roots would wither up and
[13:58] die away
[13:59] so I I I began to look at there there's
[14:02] so many interesting things about a fig
[14:05] tree down through the uh all these Pagan
[14:07] religions and things they they take the
[14:09] Fig Tree and they turn it into twist it
[14:11] and turn it into uh these Cults and
[14:13] things that were around with when uh the
[14:15] first church
[14:17] was during that time period And there's
[14:20] all different kinds of things that you
[14:22] can look at
[14:23] but what I kind of want to look at is is
[14:26] is two
[14:27] pieces because when you come to a fig
[14:30] tree there there's there's different
[14:32] kinds of fig trees there's 900 different
[14:35] I believe 900 different kinds and and
[14:37] one of them is the sycamore tree that
[14:39] zakus climbed up on that trash can and
[14:41] climbed up in the bowels of it and to to
[14:43] get it another a good look at Jesus and
[14:46] when Jesus came by he was hiding up in
[14:48] that the syamore trees grow huge not a
[14:50] North American sycamore tree but a a
[14:52] syamore fig tree that grows in Israel
[14:55] but now there's a there's this other
[14:57] kind of fig tree that it has two fruits
[15:00] and it starts off with a little it's
[15:02] called a Brea fruit I believe that's
[15:04] Spanish for first fruit and if I'm
[15:07] pronouncing that wrong brother Lis
[15:08] forgive me but uh Brea fruit is a is a
[15:13] small little fruit that begins around
[15:16] the springtime spring and early summer
[15:20] and then later on in the August in the
[15:22] fall there's the main crop the a big
[15:25] Bounty the what what what every body's
[15:29] really interested in it seems like
[15:30] almost more people are not as much
[15:32] interested in that first fruit the Brea
[15:35] fuit
[15:37] fruit now I was kind
[15:41] of just about I I I I I've been uh
[15:45] looking at this for a while but about an
[15:48] hour before church service I was reading
[15:51] through some some uh notes and things
[15:54] and I found this one by this man named
[15:56] Alfred edin that he was one wondering
[15:58] about this fruit tree this fig tree and
[16:01] he he ended up going over to Israel
[16:04] because it concerned him about how that
[16:06] there could be no fruit on the Fig Tree
[16:08] and so he went over there and he he he
[16:11] found the place where they beli that
[16:13] Jesus had died and and the the right
[16:16] location everything he got into the
[16:17] right spot and he plunged his hand into
[16:20] the Fig Tree and grabbed a big old clump
[16:21] of leaves and he and he pulled out this
[16:25] little like a little
[16:27] fruit
[16:30] and he wondered about
[16:32] it so he had somebody there said unless
[16:36] you find those on the tree branches in
[16:38] the spring he was told the tree will not
[16:42] bear fruit in the
[16:45] summer cuz first you got to have that
[16:47] first fruit and then you can
[16:51] have the main
[16:53] crop amen now now look at what all all
[16:57] through the scripture it a lot of times
[17:00] it seems like things seem real
[17:02] complicated but this same pattern is rep
[17:04] repeated all through the scripture the
[17:06] seed goes into the ground it goes
[17:07] through a process it gets greater and
[17:08] greater and greater till it comes out
[17:11] with the original life and the Original
[17:12] Seed and you can look at that braa fruit
[17:15] or you can look at one of those
[17:16] individual figs from the main crop and
[17:19] both of those reflect the original life
[17:21] and the original seed right if you want
[17:24] to see what the original life and the
[17:26] Original Seed looks like then you look
[17:28] at the bra or you look at the the main
[17:31] crop because both reflect both
[17:35] identify I hope y'all can see where I'm
[17:40] going so
[17:43] now in Mark 4:
[17:46] 26:28 he said so is the kingdom of God
[17:49] as if a man should cast seed into the
[17:52] ground and should sleep and Rise night
[17:55] and day and the seed should spring and
[17:57] grow up he knoweth not how for the Earth
[18:00] bringeth for forth fruit of
[18:02] herself first the
[18:05] blade then the ear yeah after that the
[18:08] full corn in the ear right and Mark
[18:11] 43-33 he said where unto shall we like
[18:14] in the kingdom of God or with what
[18:16] comparison shall We compare it it is
[18:18] like a grain of mustard
[18:20] seed right which when it is swn in the
[18:24] earth is less than all the seeds that be
[18:27] in the Earth
[18:30] by appearance and all the things that we
[18:32] evaluate
[18:34] right but think about the true Worth
[18:37] right but when it is sown it groweth up
[18:41] and becometh greater than all herbs amen
[18:44] and shooteth out great branches so that
[18:48] the fowls of the air May Lodge under the
[18:50] shadow of it right so as you as I kind
[18:54] of read through these quotes keep in
[18:55] mind I I want to kind of speak on a on
[18:58] maybe a topic of of greater and greater
[19:02] because that's how God works from the
[19:04] from the very beginning he's moving down
[19:06] greater and greater even in your own
[19:09] life you can examine your new birth and
[19:10] if things are not becoming greater and
[19:13] greater then there's a problem somewhere
[19:15] you look at a a little child and if
[19:17] they're not growing if their growth is
[19:19] stunning then there's a problem
[19:21] somewhere move on up into the teenage
[19:23] years if if if they start getting real
[19:25] skinny or whatever there might be a
[19:27] little a little
[19:29] a demon of anarasia or something that's
[19:31] that's getting in the way yeah you need
[19:34] to Be watchful for for a lack of growth
[19:38] a stunning of growth and a growth in a
[19:40] Christian is caused by not feasting on
[19:42] the word and not spending time with God
[19:45] can you it takes both now it takes both
[19:49] you got to read the word and spend time
[19:53] with
[19:53] God communion is what we've been talking
[19:56] about in communion and Sunday school
[19:58] because God the the whole purpose of the
[20:01] Bible is to bring us back into
[20:03] fellowship with him to bring us back in
[20:05] line with him into perfect communion so
[20:08] that well I'm going to read some quotes
[20:10] in a minute so that we are one amen
[20:14] flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[20:17] bone so what God's doing is down through
[20:21] the the Bible he's magnifying himself
[20:24] he's making
[20:26] himself how could God how could Christ
[20:29] be greater than the bride because it
[20:30] takes something greater to redeem us but
[20:33] he's magnifying himself through a work
[20:35] coming down through the seven Church
[20:37] ages coming down through the Bible
[20:39] making himself greater coming down
[20:41] through the apostles and prophets in the
[20:42] Old Testament until the word was
[20:44] standing there made flesh among them and
[20:47] they could they could talk to him and
[20:48] walk with him and shake hands with him
[20:50] and fish with him and eat bread with him
[20:52] and take advantage of him being in their
[20:54] in their presence but so many of them
[20:56] fail to realize who he was and what he
[20:58] was doing there and now down through the
[21:01] seven Church ages he's repeating that
[21:02] process through a growth process he's
[21:05] magnifying himself until he's full the
[21:08] fullness of the godhead bodily is in the
[21:10] bride and if you want to see God you you
[21:13] you got to see him through the
[21:18] bride so look what look what Jesus did
[21:21] when that when he came and and stood
[21:22] there on the shores of Galilee and
[21:24] walked and talked with the men he he
[21:26] began to take that he took that Old
[21:28] Testament law and magnified it right now
[21:32] he because uh now the full word was
[21:35] there and unto whom much is given much
[21:38] is
[21:40] required you say well well how would you
[21:43] meet that requirement how would you meet
[21:46] this requirement of the the magnified
[21:48] word let me go over to Matthew 5 real
[21:51] quick and read some of these new
[21:54] requirements of the magnified
[21:57] law
[22:02] cuz that was a I got to looking at
[22:05] Martin Luther and his main antagonist
[22:08] you know every every time brother brand
[22:10] I'm T that every time the word begins to
[22:12] come forth the seed is sewn and it
[22:14] begins to grow then the devil will come
[22:18] along and try to rip it up he'll try to
[22:20] and you can watch that in church in your
[22:22] own life when something is fixing to
[22:25] happen spiritually Here Comes The Devil
[22:27] oh yeah so uh down through history uh
[22:30] John had serenus uh Martin Luther had
[22:34] this man named arasmus and and they they
[22:36] were constantly at Battle and arasmus
[22:39] would say he his main thing that he said
[22:41] was that uh there's a little bit of
[22:44] light inside of you even without the new
[22:46] birth and and that calls out to uh you
[22:51] know there's something good in you even
[22:53] without the new birth which
[22:56] uh
[23:00] which is I'm going read some things that
[23:03] he said in a little bit I'm kind of
[23:04] jumping ahead uh but when Jesus came and
[23:08] magnified the law in Matthew 5:
[23:16] 211 he said for I say unto you that ex
[23:19] except your righteousness shall exceed
[23:20] the righteousness of the scribes and
[23:22] Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into
[23:25] the kingdom of heaven and that's how he
[23:27] starts off the magnification process my
[23:30] what a what a requirement to exceed the
[23:33] righteousness of the scribes and
[23:35] Pharisees they look like they're living
[23:37] according to every requirement that's ye
[23:39] have heard that it was said by them of
[23:41] old time Thou shalt not kill and
[23:42] whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
[23:44] of the Judgment but I say unto you that
[23:46] whosoever is angry with his brother
[23:47] without a call shall be in danger of the
[23:49] judgment and whosoever shall say to his
[23:51] brother Rea shall be in danger of the
[23:53] counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[23:54] fool shall be in danger of
[23:56] Hellfire
[24:00] let me skip
[24:04] down ye have heard that it hath been
[24:06] said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[24:08] tooth but I say unto you that you resist
[24:09] not evil but whosoever shall smite thee
[24:12] on thy right cheek turn to him the other
[24:14] also at verse
[24:16] 39 and if any man will sue thee at the
[24:18] GLW and take away thy coat let him have
[24:20] thy cloak also and whosoever shall
[24:22] compel thee to go a mile go with him
[24:24] Twain give to him that asketh thee and
[24:27] from him that borrow of thee turn not
[24:29] thou away ye have heard that it hath
[24:31] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[24:32] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[24:34] love your enemies bless them that curse
[24:36] you do good to them that hate you and
[24:38] pray for them which despitefully use you
[24:39] and persecute you that ye may be the
[24:41] children of your father which is in
[24:43] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[24:45] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[24:46] rain on the just and on the unjust and
[24:49] and and so forth and so on then he
[24:50] finishes with be therefore perfect even
[24:52] as your father which is in heaven is
[24:54] perfect and these requirements that he
[24:56] laid down magnifying the law or
[24:58] requirements that nobody can keep
[25:01] outside of the new
[25:03] birth and uh that's that's what Martin
[25:06] Luther and arasmus differed on arasmus
[25:08] said that in myself I have a quality
[25:11] that that can save myself and Martin
[25:13] Luther said there's the Bible says
[25:15] there's nothing good in my flesh and and
[25:18] nothing doesn't mean a little something
[25:20] is the words that he
[25:22] used and and Jesus said he he he Thou
[25:25] shalt not commit adultery to look he
[25:27] magnified even to look upon a woman uh
[25:30] in the Old Testament you could just
[25:31] write write a writing of divorcement but
[25:34] now uh you cause her to commit adultery
[25:37] if you put away and if you marry one
[25:39] that's been put away you commit adultery
[25:40] and the Sabbath day magnifying it the
[25:42] Sabbath day uh in the Old Testament was
[25:44] on the on that Saturday but now that you
[25:47] enter into a day of rest through the new
[25:50] birth and all these things he's
[25:52] magnifying it growing it through down
[25:54] through the Bible magnifying and growing
[25:56] because he's manifesting his attributes
[25:59] she's putting them on
[26:01] display and now look in the Old
[26:03] Testament Moses took his rod and he he
[26:06] he he took that rod and he threw it on
[26:08] the ground something that he had in his
[26:10] hand he threw it on the ground and it
[26:11] turned into a serpent he took up
[26:13] something off the ground and he he took
[26:15] sand and he threw it up in the air and
[26:16] it turned into
[26:18] fleas Jesus Took fish in his hand and he
[26:21] broke it right and gave it out but now
[26:26] you don't have to have anything in your
[26:27] hand that's right that's what that's
[26:30] what brother brand
[26:31] said he spoke the squirrels into
[26:35] existence he spoke uh the storm out of
[26:38] existence he gave salvation to had
[26:41] Rice's uh children
[26:44] sons and Romans 8
[26:47] 1-8 because what what God is doing he is
[26:50] he's restoring he's bringing us back
[26:53] he's destroying the eny that was put
[26:55] between us in the Garden of Eden when
[26:57] Adam and Eve Eve fail because through
[27:00] disbelief because Romans 818 says that
[27:03] there is therefore now no condemnation
[27:05] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[27:07] walk not after the flesh but after the
[27:09] spirit now that's how you meet all those
[27:11] requirements for the law of the spirit
[27:13] of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
[27:15] free from the law of sin and death for
[27:17] what the law could not do and that it
[27:19] was weak through the flesh God sending
[27:20] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[27:22] flesh and for sin condemn sin in the
[27:24] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[27:27] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[27:29] after the flesh but after the spirit
[27:31] right and verse 7 because the carnal
[27:34] mind is imity against God and skip it on
[27:37] down to verse 7 but ye are not in the
[27:39] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[27:42] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[27:44] any man have not the spirit of Christ he
[27:47] is none of his I'm getting behind with
[27:49] my quote reading let me read some quotes
[27:51] let's go to number
[27:56] one have faith faith in
[28:00] God I wonder why he didn't wait to find
[28:02] out whether that tree was going to
[28:04] wither away or not what did Jesus do to
[28:07] that tree right he merely called the
[28:09] life out of it he didn't wait to see if
[28:11] it withered away or not he knew it w
[28:13] would wither away he had said so and the
[28:16] word of God was in him and whatever he
[28:18] said it had to come to pass because it
[28:20] was God speaking out of a man and
[28:23] everything that God was God ented his
[28:26] entire being into Jesus Christ and
[28:29] everything Jesus Christ was exactly he
[28:31] emptied into the church
[28:34] Glory now here's the
[28:37] problem that's what's the matter with
[28:39] the Pentecostal church tonight the Full
[28:41] Gospel people right they just don't
[28:44] realize who they
[28:46] are you don't realize the power that's
[28:49] right in this building tonight but it's
[28:50] harnessed down by unbelief that's the
[28:53] only thing if God could ever get an
[28:55] Avenue to work through you it would be
[28:57] marvelous what he could do but is
[28:59] harnessed You Won't Let it Loose you
[29:02] keep it with your unbelief amen
[29:06] right now that's why it's so important
[29:09] to eat that sincere milk of the word
[29:12] because it's blasting out all of our
[29:14] unbelief amen he's he's got us on the
[29:16] threshing floor like Boaz where he's
[29:18] threshing out all the stuff that's not
[29:19] supposed to be in our life moving us at
[29:22] the Statue of a perfect man moving us
[29:24] into perfect harmony with
[29:26] him let's go to number two there is a
[29:29] man here that can turn on the
[29:32] light it was Moses even picked up say
[29:35] and said let there be fleas and so forth
[29:37] like that upon the Earth but in this
[29:38] last day he doesn't take anything see
[29:40] just the word let it be and it is what
[29:43] is said that's the way it'll be amen I
[29:46] want to testify of some of those things
[29:48] tonight see see what's happened that you
[29:50] can see he is still God his words cannot
[29:53] these works that I do shall you also and
[29:56] greater than this shall you do I took a
[29:58] fish to make a fish you don't even have
[30:00] to have a
[30:02] fish he is still God is still the same
[30:05] son the same Son of God that took a fish
[30:08] off of a fish it's the same Son of God
[30:10] today these works that I do shall you
[30:12] also even greater than this will you do
[30:14] it'll be magnified greater than this
[30:16] shall you do that you know we sing that
[30:18] song only believe all things are
[30:20] possible but do we still believe it
[30:23] that's right
[30:24] it that's it brother that's right
[30:26] exactly right
[30:29] because you know that was that that fig
[30:31] tree had two fruits a first fruit and
[30:33] then the main crop and you can pour
[30:35] everything to say well brother brandham
[30:37] it's all for brother brandham but
[30:38] there's a main crop too that he was
[30:40] pointing he was building us
[30:43] to all things are possible to him that
[30:45] believe doesn't mean that all things are
[30:47] possible just to somebody else it means
[30:49] that all things are possible to whoever
[30:51] needs it whenever you have a
[30:54] need we're getting into some good stuff
[30:56] here because now now go back to
[31:01] Genesis Genesis chapter
[31:04] 2 verse
[31:15] 20 see look God when God grows is
[31:19] different than the way when when think
[31:21] when God is moving something along in a
[31:23] growth pattern it looks different than
[31:25] the way we think we think it's got to
[31:28] get bigger and bigger look when when
[31:30] Noah got off that Arc and he looked and
[31:31] he saw that rainbow he could look and
[31:33] follow the curve of that rainbow up up
[31:35] up but it reached his sepex and it began
[31:37] a downward journey and then it went into
[31:39] the earth look what God's doing he's
[31:42] putting that rainbow into your Earth
[31:45] he's putting that seven colored rainbow
[31:47] down inside of you so that you're
[31:49] manifesting his attributes and he he
[31:51] brought that rainbow around and it got
[31:54] up to the top and it came on down down
[31:56] and look look what God's doing in
[31:58] Genesis he's coming down down but he's
[32:01] making he's magnifying himself and he
[32:03] got down and it looked like he's
[32:05] finished and he spoke Adam in existence
[32:07] brother Rand said it took years and
[32:09] years and years until finally Eve came
[32:11] out from his side and then it looks like
[32:13] he's done brother BR said he stopped he
[32:15] stopped speaking look he stopped
[32:17] speaking and now the voice is in the
[32:20] prophets God's not speaking so much he
[32:22] said you know let there be light let
[32:24] there rolling the worlds off of his
[32:26] finger tips and now he's putting his
[32:29] voice inside of
[32:31] people and in Genesis
[32:33] 2:20 through 22 let
[32:38] me let me let me stop and read
[32:46] that the Lord verse 21 through 22 and
[32:49] the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall
[32:51] upon Adam God likes to put people in
[32:54] sleep in the scriptures when he takes
[32:56] them out of the equation he put Adam
[32:58] into a deep sleep you don't have nothing
[33:00] to do with the sanctification that I'm
[33:02] going to give you he put Adam into a
[33:04] deep sleep just like he went down the
[33:07] second Adam went down into death to
[33:10] bring out that to bring out his bride
[33:14] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[33:16] fall upon Adam and he slept and he and
[33:18] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[33:20] the Flesh and stay thereof he took out a
[33:22] rib from from Brother brand described it
[33:25] under his NE right next to his heart it
[33:27] was close close to him now why didn't
[33:30] God just speak Eve into existence why
[33:33] did he have to come that way out of his
[33:36] out of his side because she would mean
[33:40] something because she would mean
[33:42] something special to Adam she would be
[33:44] so important to him something that he
[33:47] would he would be willing to do whatever
[33:49] it took to get back and he tried to go
[33:51] out and get her but it just wasn't part
[33:53] of him it wasn't an attribute of him to
[33:55] go out and get her and come back but it
[33:57] is an attribute of Jesus Christ that he
[33:59] can go out and bring his bride back
[34:02] because his bride came from his side and
[34:05] he that's why you you look at that and
[34:09] see well she's nothing because she's
[34:11] just a byproduct but that byproduct
[34:14] meant more to him than she's part of him
[34:18] she's flesh of his flesh bone of his
[34:20] bone and the way brother Ram described
[34:22] that flesh flesh of God's flesh is word
[34:27] and if we have the same Spirit and the
[34:29] same flesh built upon the word the
[34:31] spirit and truth uniting then we're a
[34:34] word born bride and that's what God's
[34:36] coming back
[34:37] for a masterpiece that he's
[34:41] made built upon his
[34:43] word and look why did he do it this way
[34:48] what what is God do trying to do he's
[34:51] trying to take that breb of fruit and
[34:54] manifest that main crop amen right he's
[34:57] trying to reproduce himself he's trying
[34:59] to take all the attributes that were in
[35:01] the book and show them to the world you
[35:05] can't that that scripture says if you if
[35:08] you've got a light don't you you don't
[35:10] want to hide it you don't want to put it
[35:11] under a bushel it's going to be manifest
[35:13] to the things that are done in secret
[35:14] are going to be shown to the world and
[35:16] now what's God doing now all around the
[35:19] world he's got a bride that's gathering
[35:21] together and and you walk on the street
[35:23] he said the people won't read the Bible
[35:25] but you are the Bible you are the Bible
[35:28] to them because your written Epistles
[35:29] known and read of all men and what was
[35:31] written in that book before the
[35:32] foundation of the world now is written
[35:34] in you and it's been quickened by the
[35:35] spirit to bring to life it's not just
[35:37] written on the pages anymore it's not
[35:40] just written in heaven anymore but now
[35:41] it's written in
[35:45] youl so each had a
[35:48] purpose Adam to bring life and Eve to
[35:51] bring life to reproduce she was part of
[35:55] Adam flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[35:58] and then the devil got in there see
[36:01] right as soon as something begins to
[36:03] happen go soon as God begins to do
[36:05] something soon as Martin Luther began
[36:08] the Reformation started here comes
[36:09] arasmus soon as as as John soon every
[36:13] soon as Jesus Judas all down through the
[36:16] Old Testament all down through the new
[36:18] there's always a
[36:21] combatant and that started enity
[36:25] now now think about going down through
[36:29] some Old Testament
[36:31] types you got Elijah and
[36:33] Elisha Elisha said if I'm going to stay
[36:37] with you no matter
[36:38] what you now we're thinking about
[36:41] greater and greater Move Along greater
[36:45] and greater through the Old Testament
[36:47] greater and greater through your
[36:48] individual life am your individual
[36:51] walk and Elisha got called and he was
[36:54] following the prophet and he said I'll
[36:57] stay with
[36:58] you and he and he watched as Elijah
[37:01] spoke and and the and the water parted
[37:04] over Jordan and they crossed over and
[37:06] Elijah went up in the fiery Chariot and
[37:08] Elisha said my God my God and the the
[37:11] Chariots of Israel and the horsemen
[37:13] thereof and Elijah's mantel fell back on
[37:19] him typing a spiritual Manel that would
[37:23] fall on the Believers amen that that we
[37:25] would do greater works and we know that
[37:27] Elisha did the 16 uh Miracles soon as he
[37:32] soon as that manle fell he he went right
[37:33] back and he got to the Jordan River and
[37:35] he said I wonder if that promise has
[37:38] been fulfilled he took that mantle and
[37:40] he slapped the river and said where is
[37:42] the god of Elijah and the and the river
[37:44] parted and he walked
[37:46] across I remember hearing about this
[37:48] this uh little missionary this was years
[37:50] ago uh right after I was born again and
[37:54] he said he was somebody was tell telling
[37:56] about they were they were overseas and
[37:58] this little missionary came to a
[37:59] situation like that and he said Lord
[38:01] I've got these books that I'm trying to
[38:03] get across this River where is the god
[38:06] of
[38:06] Elijah and all things are possible to
[38:09] them that believe and the water parted
[38:12] and he crossed over and got the tapes to
[38:14] the other
[38:16] side not not to clown around or anything
[38:19] but when go you have a need when you
[38:21] have a need God is God is able he's
[38:24] still the same you say well brother Bob
[38:26] I don't see it in your life well I'm
[38:28] talking about all of us I'm talking
[38:30] about we we're all growing we're
[38:34] all Elijah 16 Miracles The Same
[38:39] Spirit look go growing down through the
[38:41] Old Testament when it got to John and
[38:45] John said Jesus said about John that
[38:48] there's nobody none great as great as
[38:50] this as this Prophet that's ever been
[38:53] but he said there's coming one after me
[38:56] that's even greater that I'm not even
[38:57] worthy to loose the latches of his
[39:01] chws cuz look how the five comings
[39:03] Elijah goes greater and greater and
[39:07] greater Elijah then Elisha doubled and
[39:10] then John the Baptist the greatest and
[39:14] then in this
[39:17] day a prophet with the baptism of the
[39:20] Holy
[39:21] Ghost that's right that can bring us the
[39:23] word
[39:25] am and then take it on
[39:32] down make sure I didn't miss any quotes
[39:34] I'm trying to keep up with
[39:41] quotes and the Old
[39:44] Testament as they journeyed through the
[39:47] Wilderness the Tabernacle was the
[39:50] place where you had to come to worship
[39:53] yep because God put his name there amen
[39:57] yeah and it had it had trellis sides not
[40:02] solid but the little beams on the sides
[40:05] of
[40:06] it and you know uh the the word in the
[40:10] in the Hebrew for those TR size is is
[40:13] the same as as as it was used for Adam's
[40:17] Rib those that that that uh Tabernacle
[40:21] in the wilderness was made to type Jesus
[40:25] Christ that's that's of course it it was
[40:29] covered in Badger skins and it had those
[40:31] three
[40:32] compartments outer cord inner Court holy
[40:35] of
[40:36] holies and you know what's really
[40:39] striking is all scripture was given for
[40:42] by inspiration it just it's amazing how
[40:45] everything just ties together so
[40:46] perfectly in Exodus 26 when you start
[40:49] looking at the description of the
[40:51] Tabernacle the description of that Old
[40:53] Testament Tabernacle is starts from the
[40:55] inside and works out because it begins
[40:59] with the Ark of the Covenant and works
[41:01] out out out because God's coming down
[41:04] but as he's coming down he's magnifying
[41:07] himself he's trying to manifest his
[41:09] attributes to the people now this is a
[41:11] little bit different from Solomon's
[41:13] Temple because Solomon's Temple the
[41:15] description of that in I believe First
[41:17] Kings chapter 6 is from the outside in
[41:21] they start going from the Tabernacle out
[41:24] inward inward see even the description
[41:27] that that all these little details are
[41:29] just so perfect in the Bible because
[41:31] they're showing something they're
[41:32] showing God's great plan that he's
[41:35] coming he came down with that Tabernacle
[41:39] typing Christ so that we could come into
[41:42] to
[41:43] him now that Tabernacle took went on a
[41:46] little journey through the Wilderness
[41:48] and when it got to the end of his
[41:49] journey it David's Tabernacle went
[41:52] through a little journey through the the
[41:54] ark was captured by the Philistines and
[41:56] all those different little things but
[41:58] when it came to its end D the Lord laid
[42:01] upon David's heart to build a tabernacle
[42:04] where the Lord could dwell in right and
[42:07] and of course David couldn't do it but
[42:09] Solomon began to build this Tabernacle
[42:11] this Temple that the stones were
[42:15] gathered from all around the
[42:16] world and if you wanted to worship God
[42:20] remember Solomon's Prayer was after that
[42:22] Tabernacle was built he said let let
[42:25] your believers wherever they are in the
[42:27] world turn toward this Temple and
[42:29] remember Jonah when he was down in the
[42:30] belly of that well he he said Lord his
[42:33] prayer was I remember what Solomon's
[42:36] Prayer was because I'm praying that
[42:38] you'll deliver me from this situation he
[42:40] was turning toward that Temple because
[42:42] the temple was a a type of the believer
[42:45] in Christ all the Believers from around
[42:47] the world just like all those stones
[42:49] that were gathered from all different
[42:50] parts of the world remember that when
[42:52] Noah when God told Noah to build the ark
[42:54] he he went out and he got wood chatim
[42:57] wood from all the different places all
[42:59] around in the countryside and he pitched
[43:01] them within and without pitched him
[43:03] within and without just like all the
[43:04] Believers and he put them together into
[43:06] an ark where he could be safe that
[43:09] Solomon's Temple he brought stones from
[43:12] all around the world all s brought them
[43:14] in on boats and things and it was built
[43:16] without the sound of a hammer now you
[43:19] see how God moves things silently he's
[43:22] he's he's building his church silently
[43:24] on his word just like how you know
[43:27] brother brandham explained how God can
[43:28] move water out of the ocean and make a
[43:31] CL a storm cloud and different things
[43:33] without without just one sound right
[43:36] that's what he's doing
[43:38] true that pillar that
[43:41] Temple was God God manifesting his work
[43:46] for the whole world to see the Queen of
[43:49] Sheba the kings of the earth tire and S
[43:51] and they all came right to worship God
[43:53] at that Temple amen
[43:56] now
[43:58] look let me read some quotes real quick
[44:00] let's look at number
[44:05] three I'm going I'm kind of going back
[44:07] in the timeline of my sermon a little
[44:10] bit and questions and answers on
[44:16] Hebrews she become a byproduct of a man
[44:18] because she's part of him there're the
[44:20] angels and God and the spirit that's
[44:21] joined with God is one Spirit that's
[44:23] right now the spirit of God that dwells
[44:25] in the church
[44:26] is the spirit that come from Heaven that
[44:29] God knew before the foundation of the
[44:31] world that rejected the devil's lie and
[44:34] that Spirit had to take a body of Flesh
[44:37] to take his testings right he had to
[44:39] come flesh like these others did and all
[44:41] of them put on the equal yoke and God by
[44:44] the beginning know the spirits that
[44:45] would and which would not there you are
[44:47] that devil is so wise he has deceived
[44:49] the very elect if possible right so
[44:52] we're coming up to Jesus the greatest
[44:55] the word made Ben flesh the full the
[44:57] full fullness of the godhead
[45:03] bodily let's look at number quote number
[45:08] six an
[45:13] identification brother randam said
[45:14] sinless nature expressed the word of God
[45:16] so much that he and the Word was one
[45:19] amen he said so I and my father are
[45:22] one I do always that what pleases
[45:26] I and my father are just one he was so
[45:28] perfect in the image of God until he and
[45:30] God was the expressed same thing amen he
[45:33] was the flesh the son that expressed the
[45:37] deity of God so that made him deity in a
[45:40] man glory in order to redeem a man amen
[45:44] see he and the Word was one in the
[45:47] beginning was the word and the Word was
[45:49] God and the Word was made flesh so he
[45:53] and the word became one that the word
[45:54] could express
[45:56] that could show to the
[45:58] world that example of what man should be
[46:03] amen exactly right I don't forget about
[46:06] that breba fruit that first fruit so
[46:11] what that first fruit is that last that
[46:14] main crop's got to be too and it it is
[46:17] let's go to number 11 it is the rising
[46:18] of the Sun and as he being the
[46:22] groom number 11 second paragraph
[46:27] or paragraph
[46:30] 111 as he being the groom the bride has
[46:33] to come forth because it's part of him
[46:37] and it can only be the manifestation of
[46:39] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[46:41] any others has spoke of the Bride it can
[46:44] only manifest if it does something
[46:46] different from the groom it isn't the
[46:49] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[46:52] bone of his bone life of his life power
[46:55] power of his power she is him as man and
[46:59] woman are one and woman taken from his
[47:01] side she had taken a spirit the feminine
[47:03] Spirit from him the flesh from his side
[47:05] made both mechanics and Dynamics the
[47:09] wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of
[47:13] him and put it together and made
[47:16] mechanics and
[47:18] Dynamics until the church or the people
[47:21] and then he goes on to
[47:23] describe greater and greater
[47:26] amen and what confused all the Pharisees
[47:29] and the Sadducees of that day is when he
[47:31] said I and my father are one right and
[47:34] that uh when he started saying things
[47:36] like that declared himself to be one
[47:37] with God declaring himself to be the
[47:40] manifestation of the father that if you
[47:42] wanted to see what the father was that
[47:44] you would had had to come to him and
[47:46] that's when they began to separate from
[47:49] him now go back to that that fig tree if
[47:53] you want to see what that that Original
[47:55] Seed is is that original life you've got
[47:57] to look at what what's being born by
[48:00] that fig tree now Jesus came walking
[48:02] down the road and he looked under that
[48:04] that breb the breb of fruit hides up
[48:06] under the leaves in the spring of the
[48:07] year and he looked and he he he was
[48:10] looking at those leaves uh and he walked
[48:12] up to it and he reached up under there
[48:13] and there was nothing there now John the
[48:17] Baptist even he he preached that the ax
[48:20] is laid to the root of the tree what
[48:21] kind of tree if there's no fruit if
[48:23] there's no good fruit right and fruit is
[48:25] the teaching made
[48:27] manifest the the growth process
[48:30] completed the word of God made manifest
[48:32] and when there's no fruit how how do you
[48:35] know what the original life is if
[48:37] there's no fruit made manifest how do
[48:39] you know what's in the root of the tree
[48:41] and when he saw that there was no fruit
[48:43] on the tree he cursed the root of the
[48:45] tree because the root was not bearing
[48:48] forth fruit if the Root's not
[48:51] right I I've got a scripture in here
[48:54] somewhere
[48:58] but if the Root's not right it it it
[49:00] won't bear
[49:04] fruit let me read Luke 8 verse uh 11-1
[49:09] 17 now Parable is this the seed is the
[49:12] word of God those by the wayside are
[49:15] they that hear then cometh the devil
[49:17] that's what we're talking about as soon
[49:18] as God sews the seed Here Comes somebody
[49:21] to combat that then cometh the devil and
[49:24] taketh away the word out of their hearts
[49:26] lest they should believe and be saved
[49:28] they on the Rock are they which when
[49:30] they hear receive the word with joy and
[49:31] these have no root which for a while
[49:33] believe and in time of Temptation fall
[49:35] away and that which fell among Thorns
[49:37] are they which when they have heard go
[49:38] forth and are choked with cares and
[49:40] riches and pleasures of this life and
[49:42] bring no fruit to Perfection but that
[49:44] that that on the good ground are they
[49:46] which in an honest and good heart having
[49:48] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[49:50] fruit with patience no man when he hath
[49:54] lighted a candle
[49:56] cover with coverthe with a vessel or
[49:59] putteth it under a bed but Seth it on a
[50:02] Candlestick that they which enter in may
[50:04] see the light for nothing is secret that
[50:07] shall not be made manifest neither
[50:09] anything hi that shall not be known and
[50:12] come abroad which is what God did with
[50:15] Jesus Christ he made him known to the
[50:17] world he lifted him up on that cross so
[50:18] that the world could see and the world
[50:21] has seen down through 2,000 years that
[50:23] that what God has done they've heard
[50:25] about it right and now God is making
[50:28] manifest his bride through all the world
[50:31] when the gospel goes through all the
[50:33] world is what the promise is right for
[50:37] nothing is secret that shall not be made
[50:40] manifest cuz God's doing something in
[50:42] his
[50:44] bride let's look at quote number
[50:47] three oh we already read that quote
[50:49] number
[50:53] four and I have no int ention of keeping
[50:56] everybody late tonight so don't be
[51:04] alarmed show us the father and it'll
[51:07] suffice
[51:09] us and see in the same results by human
[51:13] being so submitted to God until the Holy
[51:15] Spirit can work through those human
[51:16] beings just like the Holy Spirit worked
[51:18] through Jesus who just has confessed
[51:21] that I and my father are one my father
[51:25] dwelleth in me he doeth the works it's
[51:28] not my words it's his words see he was
[51:30] so submitted to God and he died and
[51:32] Sanctified a church that he might live
[51:34] in to continue his works until the
[51:37] second Advent of his coming right he
[51:40] comes the second
[51:41] time so it's going to grow and grow and
[51:44] grow until when until the coming of the
[51:47] Lord it it should be growing the word
[51:49] should be made magnifying in your life
[51:52] magnifying in the bride right up until
[51:55] the coming of the Lord and it looks like
[51:58] maybe to the to the uh I'll say the
[52:01] untrained eye that things are getting
[52:03] are getting uh look look what happened
[52:05] in Jesus's life as it became greater and
[52:09] greater and greater and his life's work
[52:11] was about to be achieved it looked like
[52:13] things were getting worse and worse and
[52:16] worse he was Dripping drops of blood in
[52:20] the Garden of Gethsemane they tore his
[52:23] flesh off and lifted up on on cross
[52:25] naked and that was the defining moment
[52:27] in his life right and now maybe as the
[52:31] the sun is Rip in the bride and and and
[52:34] we're bowing over like wheat because
[52:36] we've come to full maturity maybe it
[52:38] looks a little
[52:40] bit like things are not going well but
[52:43] oh yeah but it
[52:44] is I believe it that's right amen let's
[52:49] look at number five why then why don't
[52:51] God make it live again in them men if
[52:53] it's God's word I am my father father
[52:55] are one not three we are one God is in
[52:58] him God speaks through him he's no more
[53:00] his own but he's God's Voice through
[53:02] human lips amen and every believer in
[53:05] him tonight is likewise possessed so
[53:08] possessed so completely given over till
[53:10] his words become like the words of
[53:13] Christ he speaks and the word is made
[53:17] flesh Glory he speaks and the word is
[53:21] manifested
[53:23] right let's look at
[53:25] let's look at number
[53:27] seven is the bride of Christ and the
[53:30] body of Christ the same is what somebody
[53:32] said yes sir when God give Christ his
[53:34] bride the spirit gave the flesh the
[53:35] bride he was pierced in the side under
[53:37] his heart and water blood and Spirit
[53:39] came forth that become flesh of his
[53:42] flesh and bone of his bone we are the
[53:45] Flesh and Bones the bride will be the
[53:47] Flesh and Bones of Christ exactly they
[53:50] are that is his bride GL let's look at
[53:53] number eight now
[53:56] and when you see the word made
[53:59] manifest you see the father amen God
[54:04] because the word is the
[54:06] Father the word is God and the word made
[54:10] manifest is God himself taking his own
[54:12] word and manifesting it among
[54:15] Believers nothing can make it live but
[54:19] Believers just Believers right right now
[54:22] there's that question that brother
[54:23] Brandon preached on so many times show
[54:25] us the father and it will suffice of us
[54:28] and there was the father made manifest
[54:30] them that bra fruit right but now God is
[54:34] the father is making himself manifest in
[54:36] his bride to show himself to the world
[54:39] in that main crop
[54:42] right amen let's look at number
[54:45] nine I'm just running through some
[54:47] quotes real quick now the smiting of
[54:50] Christ was for a cause that he might
[54:51] take from him one to be a family the
[54:53] bride amen he might take him a bride so
[54:56] when his Masterpiece was perfected then
[54:58] he had to Smite it to take it from him
[55:00] not another piece not another creation
[55:02] but the same creation right my brother
[55:04] don't think bad at this but think a
[55:06] minute if he took from him the original
[55:07] creation to make the bride for him he
[55:09] never made another creation he took a
[55:12] part of the original creation and then
[55:14] if he was the word what must the bride
[55:16] be it's got to be the original word
[55:19] Living God in the word
[55:22] am and that confounds the unbeliever
[55:26] y remember in Sunday school we were
[55:28] looking through Jeremiah 52 that baale
[55:30] is
[55:31] confounded he tried to build that that
[55:34] that uh Tower of Babel and you know you
[55:37] can follow it all down through the
[55:38] through uh the Old Testament things and
[55:41] uh the one that was trying to confuse
[55:44] the real believer now ends up
[55:53] confused and I'm I'm I'm I'm going just
[55:55] kind of wrap it up here in just a minute
[56:00] but because I want to look real quick at
[56:03] at some of these things that Aras was
[56:05] said about
[56:07] Luther because you can see that the same
[56:09] thing kind of repeated today as people
[56:12] look upon the bride of Christ and fail
[56:14] to see what's going on even sometimes
[56:17] sitting in amongst the
[56:19] churches because arasmus he he had this
[56:22] this idea that everything was supposed
[56:24] to be peaceful and lovey-dovey and you
[56:26] know Luther was one of my favorite
[56:29] characters because he was he was almost
[56:31] bombastic and he would he would he would
[56:33] just call it like it was he'd say um
[56:37] arasmus is is just another Caiaphas he's
[56:40] uh he's a he's a serpent and and vile
[56:43] and all this kind of all that kind of
[56:45] stuff and so arasmus was begin he began
[56:48] to look upon what Luther was doing and
[56:50] you know as as Luther and arasmus
[56:53] started off Luther he did everything
[56:54] everything he could to arasmus was his
[56:57] friend and he he did everything he could
[56:59] to get him over out of the Catholic
[57:01] church over to the Reformation side and
[57:03] and try to get him saved and everything
[57:07] you know when arasmus died um Luther had
[57:11] some harsh things to say about about him
[57:13] but at the very beginning he just he did
[57:16] everything he could to save his soul and
[57:18] arasa said the Reformation seemed to
[57:21] have had no other purpose than to turn
[57:24] monks and nuns into bridegrooms and
[57:27] Brides he was he was looking at what
[57:30] Luther was
[57:34] doing he
[57:36] said this new gospel is producing a new
[57:39] set of men so
[57:41] impudent hypocritical and abusive such
[57:45] as liars and Psychopaths who agree
[57:47] neither with one another nor with
[57:49] anybody else so universally offensive
[57:52] and seditious such mad men and ranters
[57:55] and in short so utterly dis tasteful to
[57:57] me that if I knew of any City in which I
[57:59] should be free from them I would remove
[58:01] there at
[58:04] once but now look you can look upon the
[58:07] bride today with critical eyes and say
[58:10] well nobody agrees with one another one
[58:12] another and and things like you look
[58:14] that that's that Temple that Solomon
[58:16] built was each Stone was hued out in
[58:19] this way and that because each one of us
[58:21] need to be sliced and diced a little bit
[58:23] differently so that we'll fit into the
[58:24] building
[58:25] but after it's all said and done we're
[58:27] all cohesive like that not Noah Arc
[58:29] we're we're pitched within and without
[58:31] and we're God's drawing us together not
[58:34] just in fellowship with him but
[58:35] fellowship with one another because how
[58:37] can we fellowship with one another
[58:38] outside of the new birth we well argue
[58:41] and fight and fuss but God's bringing us
[58:44] into communion through the
[58:47] word he said wherever Lutheranism
[58:51] prevails see how carnal Whenever
[58:54] Wherever Lutheranism prevails learning
[58:57] and liberal culture go to the
[59:00] ground can you
[59:02] believe he he he embraced so much the
[59:05] the learning and the Theology and things
[59:07] that he failed to see what God was doing
[59:09] in that
[59:10] day he said the study of tongues like
[59:13] languages and the love of fine
[59:15] literature is everywhere growing
[59:17] cold Luther has heaped insufferable
[59:20] odium on it because he loved the study
[59:23] of languages and fine literature more
[59:26] than the word of
[59:29] God he said what can be more ruinous
[59:32] than to let such words as The Following
[59:34] come to the people's ears the pope is
[59:37] Antichrist Bishops and Priests are mere
[59:39] grubs man-made laws are heretical
[59:43] confession is pernicious Works merits
[59:45] and Endeavors are heretical words there
[59:48] is no free will now that sounds a little
[59:51] bit strange that he would say that about
[59:52] Martin Luther that there's no free will
[59:55] you remember that was one of the big
[59:56] debates that Martin Luther and and
[59:58] arasmus had and the issue was not so
[1:00:00] much free will but it was that there's
[1:00:01] something within you that that can save
[1:00:04] you which was what arasmus was arguing
[1:00:06] about everything happens my necessity I
[1:00:10] see under the pretext of the Gospel a
[1:00:13] new bold Shameless and ungovernable race
[1:00:16] growing up in a world in a word such a
[1:00:18] one as will be unendurable to Luther
[1:00:22] himself I'm sharing these because it
[1:00:24] this the same thing is repeating itself
[1:00:26] today it repeated itself through through
[1:00:29] John Wesley's Age and and now today
[1:00:31] where you you look if you look upon the
[1:00:33] bride with carnal eyes it looks like
[1:00:36] things are are not going well but God's
[1:00:39] doing something he's moving in an
[1:00:41] individual
[1:00:44] life what else has been accomplished
[1:00:46] therefore I ask by so many harsh little
[1:00:49] books by so many harsh little books Yeah
[1:00:54] by so so much foolish
[1:00:55] talk by so many formidable threats and
[1:00:59] by so much
[1:01:01] bombast Luther could have taught the
[1:01:03] Evangelical philosophy with great profit
[1:01:05] to the Christian
[1:01:06] flock he could have benefited the World
[1:01:09] by bringing forth books if he had
[1:01:10] restrained from those things which could
[1:01:13] only end in
[1:01:15] disturbance cuz he's concerned about
[1:01:17] disturbance are we concerned about
[1:01:19] hurting somebody's feelings today are we
[1:01:22] concerned about creating a disturbance
[1:01:25] a disturbance at work a disturbance in
[1:01:26] your
[1:01:27] neighborhood yeah is isn't that what
[1:01:30] Jesus said that he came yep to bring the
[1:01:33] sword to to put at variance father and
[1:01:36] and and uh son and and so forth
[1:01:40] amen when the word comes and and is
[1:01:43] manifested in your life sometimes it it
[1:01:45] causes Discord
[1:01:48] right above all I am of the opinion now
[1:01:52] this is this is what arasmus is saying
[1:01:54] above all I am of the opinion that
[1:01:56] Discord ruinous for all must be
[1:02:01] avoided and that thus by what I might
[1:02:03] call a holy artfulness the needs of the
[1:02:05] time must be served that by no means the
[1:02:09] treasury of the Gospel truth be betrayed
[1:02:11] whence can come the Reformation of
[1:02:12] corrupt public morals perhaps someone
[1:02:15] will ask whether I have another mind
[1:02:17] regarding Luther than I had formerly no
[1:02:18] indeed I have the same mind I have
[1:02:20] always wished that with changes made of
[1:02:22] certain things which were displeasing to
[1:02:24] to me he discussed purely the gospel
[1:02:28] Philosophy from which the morals of our
[1:02:30] age have departed Al last too far I have
[1:02:34] always preferred that he be corrected
[1:02:36] rather than
[1:02:37] suppressed you know Luther had
[1:02:40] some again he's one of my favorite
[1:02:43] characters he said about arasmus arasmus
[1:02:46] of roddam is the viest miscreant that
[1:02:48] ever disgraced the Earth he is a very
[1:02:53] caiaphus and he said shame upon the our
[1:02:57] csed wret whenever I pray I pray a curse
[1:02:59] upon
[1:03:01] arasmus he said this I do leave behind
[1:03:04] me as my will and
[1:03:06] testament I hold arasmus of rodam to be
[1:03:09] Christ's most bitter enemy the enemy to
[1:03:12] True Religion the open adversary of
[1:03:15] Christ the complete and faithful picture
[1:03:18] and image of Epicurious and of
[1:03:21] Lucian cuz what he failed to see was
[1:03:23] what he failed to see the original life
[1:03:27] made manifest in that fig tree the fig
[1:03:31] tree that had grown up through a growth
[1:03:33] process down
[1:03:35] through up until that point
[1:03:42] because like like John let's
[1:03:45] see like John Wesley said brother
[1:03:47] Brandon like to quote him he said May
[1:03:49] there not leave in our bosom that
[1:03:50] burning may it never lead may it swell
[1:03:53] greater and greater
[1:03:54] until it throws us to our knees to beg
[1:03:57] and persuade and John Wesley said catch
[1:03:59] on fire and others will love to come
[1:04:01] watch you burn
[1:04:03] Amen in Matthew 24
[1:04:06] 32-33 now learn a parable of the Fig
[1:04:08] Tree when his branch is yet tender and
[1:04:12] putteth forth leaves ye know that summer
[1:04:13] is nigh so likewise ye when you shall
[1:04:16] see all these things know that it is
[1:04:19] near even at the
[1:04:22] doors so look God's God manifesting
[1:04:24] himself in his
[1:04:26] bride so that you know the world wants
[1:04:28] to see show us the father and it'll
[1:04:30] suffice us they want to see God they
[1:04:32] want to know him the only way that you
[1:04:35] can know God is through his bride right
[1:04:38] the only way that you can get to him
[1:04:40] that's why you know people today say
[1:04:42] well that we don't need the fivefold
[1:04:44] ministry and things but if you don't
[1:04:46] hear the word how will you know the
[1:04:48] father if you don't have somebody that
[1:04:50] can instruct you and show you and teach
[1:04:52] you these things and make it manifest
[1:04:54] amen like Philip Philip Philip was one
[1:04:57] of those characters in the Bible that
[1:04:59] that he ran around calling people he he
[1:05:01] went Nathaniel and brought him to Jesus
[1:05:04] he went to the Ethiopian unic and showed
[1:05:05] him what was written in the word now
[1:05:08] what would we do without Phillip right
[1:05:10] Amen to show us what's written in the
[1:05:12] word and and so that we can be built up
[1:05:15] on the word and come into close
[1:05:17] communion with god so let's uh let's

[1:13:41] our brother was
[1:13:43] preaching you know communication
[1:13:47] is a wonderful
[1:13:49] thing but the point I was thinking about
[1:13:52] that you know God can speak in every
[1:13:54] language in the world and understand
[1:13:56] every
[1:13:57] language right and in every language
[1:14:00] it's a little bit different the way the
[1:14:03] wording is the way the things are if I
[1:14:06] miss this don't worry about it but like
[1:14:09] we say uh let's go to town or something
[1:14:11] well maybe in the the Spanish is the
[1:14:13] town we
[1:14:14] go it turns a little bit in a way of to
[1:14:20] where it has a little different
[1:14:21] expression but you know to the people it
[1:14:24] means the
[1:14:26] same well you know when we get over
[1:14:28] there one of these days it won't be but
[1:14:29] one language what will it be it be a
[1:14:32] Heavenly language but and but we'll all
[1:14:35] be able to have that
[1:14:39] communication you know amen an
[1:14:42] expression well what should be then the
[1:14:45] the expression of every Christian faith
[1:14:48] around the world that no matter what the
[1:14:51] language is or the wording they use
[1:14:54] whether it it's goooo Gaga or whatever
[1:14:57] it is you know it's a
[1:14:59] language the thought is the god of the
[1:15:04] word and you know that everybody as our
[1:15:06] brother was bringing about Luther you
[1:15:08] know that all born again Christians no
[1:15:10] matter what world part of the world they
[1:15:12] were in or what language they were using
[1:15:15] you know what they could understand what
[1:15:17] the man was talking about that the just
[1:15:20] shall live by faith amen that's one ful
[1:15:23] isn't
[1:15:24] it to just think about God's word make
[1:15:27] sure you tell her brother how much you
