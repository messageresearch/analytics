[0:01] thingy. And oops, that ain't going to
[0:04] work.
[0:09] Yeah, me too.
[0:21] [Music]
[0:22] All
[0:24] right.
[0:25] Help. Genesis 3:15.
[0:31] Look at that.
[0:38] [Music]
[0:44] Ma'am, I hold it this way. I can't see
[0:46] it.
[0:50] All right. Genesis 3:15. Thanks again to
[0:52] Brother Joe for taking over last Sunday
[0:54] while we
[0:56] were recuperating from our long journey.
[0:59] [Music]
[1:03] But in Genesis 3:15,
[1:10] Genesis
[1:17] 3:15, we're just going to kind of run
[1:19] through what we've been doing
[1:21] and and then uh bring it to the season
[1:25] because last time we talked, we were
[1:27] talking about Nimrod in Genesis 10 set
[1:30] up
[1:31] kingdom. But we don't want an earthly
[1:34] kingdom. We need a heavenly kingdom. The
[1:35] earthly kingdoms will all pass away, but
[1:38] this one will
[1:39] not. And that kingdom that was marred in
[1:44] Genesis, God came down in Genesis 3:15
[1:47] and he didn't say, "I'm going to send
[1:49] soand so to do it." Which we know he did
[1:52] through Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
[1:54] right down to Jesus, right down to the
[1:56] pro prophets, and right down to you and
[1:58] I. But in Genesis 3:15, God stood
[2:02] alone and said, "I will put
[2:05] enmity between thee and the woman, who?"
[2:07] The serpent, and between thy seed, which
[2:10] was what? The serpent
[2:12] seed, and her
[2:15] seed, and it shall bruise thy head, and
[2:17] thou shalt
[2:19] bruise his heel.
[2:21] All right? Now what happened was God
[2:24] knew that the womb that he wanted to
[2:26] come through had become polluted. Eve
[2:29] Eve had had the relationship with the
[2:33] the the beast which was not a snake. He
[2:36] was an upright creature between man and
[2:39] the animals. And uh it was a
[2:43] uh it was a happening that did
[2:46] not it did not scare God.
[2:50] God knew it was going to happen and God
[2:53] alone was the only one because remember
[2:55] over in
[2:56] Genesis it was on condition. If you'll
[2:59] eat this tree everything will be fine.
[3:02] If you don't eat of this tree I mean if
[3:05] you eat of this tree which is the wrong
[3:07] tree then you're going to suffer these
[3:09] consequences. So it was if you will I
[3:11] will. But now in Genesis 3:15 it says
[3:15] look it says and I will put enmity.
[3:19] Satan didn't do anything to the human
[3:22] race except mar the womb of Eve to keep
[3:27] God from coming the way he wanted to
[3:30] come did not stop the plan of God
[3:34] actually unfolded more the plan of God
[3:37] because God right here was God Elohim
[3:42] Lord
[3:43] God right here he wasn't a savior
[3:47] right Right. That's right. That's right.
[3:50] He was. But right here, he wasn't.
[3:53] That's right. You know, the day before
[3:56] this happened,
[3:59] he was not. He was Jehovah, God, God
[4:01] with a family, Adam and Eve, and getting
[4:03] ready to bring all of us forth through
[4:05] spiritual multiplication. Right? He
[4:09] wasn't a healer cuz nobody needed to be
[4:10] healed, right? He wasn't alpha and
[4:14] omega.
[4:18] You take that wrong. I guess maybe
[4:20] somebody on the internet maybe, but but
[4:21] that's the truth. Right. There was no
[4:24] way for him to bring those attributes
[4:26] forth the day before this happened.
[4:29] That's right. Right. The day before
[4:31] Satan done what he did through the beast
[4:34] with Eve. And then Eve took it to her
[4:37] husband and said, "This is the way we're
[4:38] supposed to do it." And he didn't kick
[4:41] her out because she was part of him.
[4:43] Right? So he said, "Well, I'll," In
[4:45] other words, I'll take on your what you
[4:47] did. All right? Not to save her because
[4:50] Adam's not a savior. Right?
[4:53] Now, God has now become a savior. I will
[4:57] put enmity between thy
[5:00] seed and her seed. In other words, I'm
[5:03] going to allow you to come through the
[5:06] womb of a woman born of your
[5:10] parents and between thy seed and her
[5:13] seed. Now, a woman doesn't have a seed.
[5:16] Woman has to be given a seed. Right?
[5:19] Everybody understand that? A woman does
[5:21] not a woman cannot conceive and give
[5:23] birth by herself. Now, in this modern
[5:26] technology, you say, "Yeah, they can."
[5:28] Still takes a man's seed. That's right.
[5:31] Right. Right. She cannot get pregnant by
[5:33] herself. There has to seed come from
[5:35] somewhere in the world that a man has
[5:37] produced to put in that womb. So, so it
[5:40] is not woman alone. There is a man
[5:42] involved. All right. But says between
[5:45] thy seed and her seed. So what's he
[5:49] going to have to do? He's going to have
[5:50] to come down and put something in this
[5:53] person to bring forth himself. Because
[5:56] when he says, "I will put enmity," which
[5:59] is a division. But what's he going to do
[6:01] between thy seed and her seed? It shall
[6:04] bruise thy head. In other words, he's
[6:05] telling the
[6:07] serpent, "And thou shalt bruise his
[6:09] heel." Thou, the serpent is going to
[6:11] bruise the heel of
[6:14] man. But this seed of the woman is going
[6:16] to bruise his head. In other words,
[6:19] Satan, take away sin, take away death,
[6:22] and all those things at the Calvary.
[6:23] That's what he did. All right. So that's
[6:26] the first promise of grace, right?
[6:30] In other words, he didn't say, "I'm
[6:31] going to come down and this will happen
[6:34] if Abraham will just believe." No, he
[6:36] told Abraham, he said, "I'm going to do
[6:37] it." Right?
[6:40] I'm going to do it. Now, God, that's
[6:41] what I said about predestination. Maybe
[6:43] one day we'll preach predestination and
[6:45] turn all the tapes off because actually
[6:47] predestination is there's nothing you
[6:50] can do about it. Right. That's right.
[6:54] Absolutely. There's nothing you could do
[6:56] about it. Tell me how you going to birth
[6:58] yourself. That's right. Right. Tell me
[7:00] how you going to make your way back to
[7:02] God.
[7:05] No way.
[7:06] No
[7:07] way. So God had this whole thing planned
[7:11] out and this is the way it's going to
[7:13] happen. But by fornowledge, knowing what
[7:16] we would do, that's why he could plan it
[7:18] that way. So we do have a choice. But we
[7:22] didn't make a choice getting here. Did
[7:23] you have a choice getting here? No.
[7:26] Uh-uh. It was God bringing you here.
[7:30] You couldn't say, "Well, well, now I'm
[7:32] bride, so my mom and daddy got together
[7:34] and had mem."
[7:36] Come on, people. Millions of sperm and
[7:39] millions of egg during conception comes
[7:41] down. How in the world is that one germ
[7:46] and that one egg going to find itself
[7:48] and bring you?
[7:50] God had to do it. There's no other way.
[7:53] That's why brother Ram said
[7:54] predestination in a in a shallow group
[7:56] of people. Then you would go home today
[7:58] and say, "Well, I ain't got no choice. I
[8:01] can just smoke, drink, do what I want
[8:02] to, and God's just if he saved me, he
[8:04] saved me." No, he knew you'd say that
[8:06] when you got here. Therefore, he could
[8:08] do that.
[8:10] So, predestination is really
[8:12] predestined. It's destiny determined
[8:15] before you even walk in the door. But to
[8:17] an untrained group, that's what you'd
[8:19] say in your mind. Well, brother, you're
[8:20] telling me I just go smoke, drink, cuss,
[8:22] and do what I want. No. If you smoke,
[8:23] drink, and cuss now, you're not born
[8:25] again. God ain't nowhere in your body.
[8:27] Amen. Nowhere.
[8:30] Cuz he will not dwell in an unclean
[8:32] vessel. You come to church all your
[8:33] life. That's right. And die and go to
[8:36] hell. You can actually quit smoking,
[8:38] drinking, and cussing and still die and
[8:39] go to hell. All right. But God has
[8:42] placed a part of himself. He set a part
[8:46] of himself aside right here. I will put
[8:49] enmity and I am going to come down into
[8:52] this woman called Mary and I'm going to
[8:55] create me a body that I'm going to come
[8:58] down and live in. Now folks, that's
[9:01] predestination. That's right. Set, done,
[9:05] finished. Because remember, in God's
[9:07] mind, it's done anyway, right? We're the
[9:09] ones that have a problem. So see that's
[9:11] why brother Brown couldn't in a very
[9:13] untrained group of people he could not
[9:16] say well it's just predestination and
[9:17] that's it. No he have to bring in
[9:20] fornowledge of what you chose to do.
[9:22] Therefore God saw what you choose. So he
[9:24] comes back remember it looks back
[9:28] looks back right to what you were what
[9:32] you had done. And then God looking back
[9:33] to that or to that forward and then
[9:36] coming back and living a life through.
[9:38] He put everything right where he could
[9:39] bring Sister Johnny. He knew she'd want
[9:41] it. So he took this man that probably
[9:44] never knew this woman from California or
[9:46] wherever. It doesn't matter. And one
[9:48] day, guess
[9:50] what? But don't you think God had that
[9:52] in his hand the whole time? The seed and
[9:56] the and the egg he had in his hand the
[9:59] whole time. Now, he didn't place it in
[10:00] there because remember right here it
[10:02] says between thy seed serpent. So we got
[10:06] to be born by sex. We got to be born
[10:08] this way. Amen. God didn't place an egg
[10:10] and a sperm in your mama and you came
[10:11] forth to make you no some special
[10:14] something. No, don't think you some
[10:15] special something. We was all still born
[10:17] in sin, shaping an iniquity, spouse from
[10:19] our mother's womb, a liar. Except for
[10:21] this one man we're talking about. That's
[10:23] right. And that's Jesus Christ. That the
[10:25] world thinks, you know, was born next
[10:27] week sometime. That's right. That's why
[10:30] I kind of brought this in a little bit.
[10:31] But Genesis 3:15. Now, let's go to
[10:33] Isaiah 7.
[10:37] cuz we're still talking about son of
[10:38] God, son of man. Because he's the son of
[10:40] God right here in Genesis 3:15, that's
[10:42] the son of God, right? Because he's not
[10:43] son of man. Son of man is God in human
[10:46] flesh. But now the son of man attribute
[10:48] is in him. The healer attribute, the
[10:51] savior, the redeemer, all that attribute
[10:53] is in this man right here. But he has
[10:55] not displayed them yet. Just like when
[10:56] you and I were born, we were born with
[10:58] the capability of fathering and
[11:01] mothering children. But now at 7 years
[11:03] old, you couldn't do that. Why? your
[11:05] body wasn't ready for it, right? Well,
[11:06] see, Jesus's body wasn't ready yet.
[11:11] We have to look at it that way because
[11:13] remember the Bible says the Godhead can
[11:14] be explained by the simple things we
[11:18] say. We were born withever capacity to
[11:21] bring forth children. But we had to
[11:23] mature to a place to our body could
[11:25] handle it. That's right. Right. Jesus
[11:28] the same way. Jesus could come couldn't
[11:30] come forth right here in the garden. He
[11:32] had to wait all down through these
[11:34] prophets so they could prophesy and say
[11:36] this is going to happen and this is
[11:37] going to happen because brother Brandham
[11:38] said what? The prophets in the Old
[11:40] Testament built the body of Jesus
[11:41] Christ. That's right. Right. Because of
[11:43] what? The word. Not because any sex or
[11:45] any seed or this. No, it was the seed
[11:47] word of God coming down through time.
[11:49] And then he said right here in Genesis
[11:51] 3:15. So all of a sudden way down about
[11:53] 4,000 years later, there was a little
[11:55] girl named Mary. All right. So now
[11:59] Isaiah
[12:00] 7 and
[12:08] 14. Here's the here's the
[12:14] promise. Therefore, the Lord himself
[12:16] shall give you a sign. Now, the Lord
[12:19] himself shall give you a sign.
[12:22] Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear
[12:25] a son, and shall call his name,
[12:29] Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat,
[12:32] that he may know to refuse the evil and
[12:34] choose the good. See, Jesus had a
[12:36] choice. Excuse me. For before the child
[12:38] shall know to refuse the evil, and
[12:40] choose the good, the land that thou
[12:41] haveest shall be forsaken of both her
[12:44] kings. So, remember God uh Jesus came
[12:48] while they were under rule of uh of
[12:50] Rome. All right?
[12:52] But behold, a virgin shall conceive and
[12:54] bear a son. Now, who is that? That's the
[12:58] son of
[12:59] man,
[13:01] right? The son of God is before he
[13:03] turned. The son of God is where we were
[13:04] just talking about in Genesis 3. So,
[13:06] we're not off our subject. Genesis 3:15,
[13:08] the son of God, that was spirit God.
[13:10] That man did not have flesh on him yet.
[13:13] Not the flesh of Jesus. He wasn't the
[13:14] flesh. He wasn't the flesh man, son of
[13:16] man that come down to die to save the
[13:18] world. All right? He may have come down
[13:21] and spoke to Adam and Eve in a body of
[13:22] flesh, but that wasn't the body that
[13:25] died. They had to be a literal body come
[13:27] and die. I was reading brother Brandham
[13:28] yesterday morning at work and
[13:31] um he said he said that
[13:34] body with our sacrifice just like I've
[13:37] always preached. The body was the
[13:38] sacrifice. That's what came and paid the
[13:40] price. He he said there had to be a
[13:42] sacrifice and he came and that body was
[13:45] the sacrifice. But now that body is the
[13:47] body of God, right? Okay. Now we know it
[13:50] was the body of God from the beginning
[13:52] but it had to develop. See my dad
[13:54] carried me inside of him for for 19
[13:59] years till one day in holy wedlock I was
[14:03] produced but I was in his body couldn't
[14:06] see me couldn't talk to me but there was
[14:09] a desire for me to be here. That's
[14:11] right. So what did God do? He put them
[14:12] together. He put the man and the woman
[14:14] together. And guess what? Here I am
[14:16] right here.
[14:17] Okay. Then now I've got to make a
[14:20] choice. See, that's the part you got.
[14:21] You got to make a choice once you get
[14:22] here. But God saw the choice you'd made
[14:24] when you got here. So he predestined the
[14:26] whole thing.
[14:28] It's really simple, but it's very
[14:30] complicated if you really don't listen.
[14:32] That's true. Cuz you'd really think you
[14:33] have no choice at all. But no, it all
[14:35] comes from your choice. Right. You got
[14:38] to remember God knew everything and then
[14:40] he backed up and went through it. Right.
[14:44] All right.
[14:46] So it is destiny determined before you
[14:50] get here. But that destiny is determined
[14:53] by what he all what he saw you do once
[14:55] you got here. And there's no way to
[14:58] change that. No way. That's
[15:01] predestination. That's where people say,
[15:03] "Well, okay then. If I always were
[15:05] drunk, I guess I'll No. God, if you say
[15:08] that, then that's what God saw you say.
[15:10] So he didn't have you there to start
[15:11] with."
[15:12] When I look back, I can see my dad died
[15:15] at 14, which put me in another city,
[15:18] which had me the husband I met, which
[15:21] allows me to come to this church. Excuse
[15:23] me. Absolutely. And this is the most
[15:25] important time in my life aspect of what
[15:29] happened in your whole life. Absolutely.
[15:31] That's why it's hard. But the Bible says
[15:33] you got to forsake father, mother,
[15:35] sister, brother. That doesn't mean you
[15:37] deny them. It didn't say deny. Jesus
[15:39] said forsake. In other words, if mama
[15:41] don't come, that don't mean I can't.
[15:44] That's right. If husband don't come,
[15:47] that don't mean I can't. Jesus didn't
[15:49] say do away with them. He said forsake.
[15:52] In other words, you don't have to cling
[15:53] to them if they don't cling to the word
[15:56] of God. Cuz the word of God is the most
[15:57] important thing in your life. I believe
[15:58] if you'll live the word of God, God will
[16:00] give you your children and give you your
[16:02] husband, give you your wife. I truly
[16:03] believe that. Right. Okay. I just got
[16:05] enough grace for that. All right. Isaiah
[16:10] 9. Oh, let's go back to 14 just for a
[16:13] second. Cuz that word Emmanuel, that was
[16:16] God coming down in a
[16:19] baby because it happened through the
[16:21] womb. God had to come through the womb,
[16:25] right? Because the pollution was in the
[16:26] womb, right? Of Eve, right? Mind first
[16:29] and then the womb. So, what does God do?
[16:31] He comes through the womb. But he had to
[16:34] get it in Mary's mind first because
[16:36] remember Gabriel come to her and told
[16:37] her all these things. She had to in her
[16:40] mind she had to accept that. Right? And
[16:42] when she accepted it, it was done.
[16:46] Finish. All right. For unto us 9:6, for
[16:49] unto us a child is born. Unto us a son
[16:52] is
[16:54] given. This is not the son of God. He's
[16:56] given us the son of man because this
[16:58] man's got to die for us. This man's got
[17:00] to be our savior. This man's got to be
[17:02] our healer. You say a different man. No,
[17:03] not a different man. Same man.
[17:06] Different aspect or attribute is being
[17:08] displayed. Just like I told you before,
[17:10] those of you that's never met me before,
[17:12] you say, "Well, I know you're human.
[17:15] But now, when I identify this as my
[17:17] wife, you'll say he's a husband also."
[17:21] Then when my grandchild, so you don't
[17:23] know me as a grandpa, but when my
[17:25] grandchild comes walking through the
[17:26] door, you're obviously going to know
[17:27] that I'm a grandpa. So what did I do? I
[17:30] didn't change who I was. That's right.
[17:32] He just changed your way of thinking
[17:35] about me. That's the way God is. God
[17:38] don't change. We have to change our
[17:41] thinking. That's why the denominations
[17:43] believe father, son, holy ghost. They
[17:44] believe in three separate person, three
[17:46] personalities, three gods. There's a God
[17:48] here, there's a son here, and there's a
[17:49] Holy Ghost. There's a little floating
[17:50] cloud over here. No, it's the same man,
[17:54] right? Just like me. I'm the same man.
[17:56] And I just told you three of my
[17:57] attributes. And that doesn't matter all
[17:58] the other things you know hunter,
[18:01] fisherman, all the see you display your
[18:03] attributes by what you do. So now he can
[18:06] display these attributes by becoming a
[18:08] son. Unto us a child is born. So he's
[18:10] got to be born in human flesh, born
[18:13] through a woman. Unto us a son is given
[18:15] and the government shall be upon his
[18:17] shoulders and the name shall be called
[18:18] wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the
[18:20] everlasting father, the prince of peace
[18:23] of the increase of his government. Now,
[18:25] in my Bible, his is it
[18:27] atalicized his government, right?
[18:30] Because Jesus is going to tell Pilate
[18:33] over at the crucifixion, he's going to
[18:35] say, Pilot's going to say, "They say
[18:38] you're a king and you're setting up this
[18:39] kingdom, right?" Jesus said, "If my
[18:42] kingdom were here, right, my subjects
[18:44] would fight." He said, "But my kingdom's
[18:47] not here." Right? In other words, my
[18:49] kingdom's from above. Right? Okay. So
[18:52] that's what we'll we'll stop right there
[18:53] and kind of cut a little short. But in
[18:54] Matthew, that's what we do. We express
[18:57] our attributes because if you drunk or
[19:00] whatever, you're expressing your
[19:01] attribute. But if you're a Christian,
[19:03] you're expressing your attitude.
[19:06] Everybody is going to express who they
[19:09] are. Whether you want to or not.
[19:10] Somewhere along in life, even
[19:13] Christians, even going up the statue of
[19:15] a perfect man, something's going to
[19:17] happen that's going to show you, well,
[19:20] maybe I don't have enough knowledge yet.
[19:23] That's true. And and truly up the statue
[19:25] of a perfect man, I don't believe it's
[19:26] like faith and then you put it in a box.
[19:29] Virtue and then you put it in a box. In
[19:31] other words, I've already got that. You
[19:32] know, I need three I need seven pairs of
[19:35] of of u seven
[19:38] shirts. Well, I got a white shirt. Well,
[19:40] I don't need a white shirt in the
[19:41] morning. No, you going to need a white
[19:42] shirt the rest of your life. Like faith.
[19:45] A lot of people say, "Well, you know, I
[19:47] got faith. I don't need more faith.
[19:48] Let's work on virtue." I think you work
[19:50] on all seven at the same time. That's
[19:52] true. I believe that. And then God
[19:54] somewhere down the line is going to let
[19:56] you realize, click. All right. You got
[19:58] that one. Click. All right. You passed
[20:00] that test. It's like somebody said one
[20:02] time or say, "Whoops. I got to take that
[20:05] test all over again." Because you know
[20:06] that you're you you know you goofed up.
[20:09] But
[20:10] uh let's remember that God didn't wasn't
[20:12] born on December the
[20:14] 25th. I was talking to a girl the other
[20:16] day. She was my auditor and we went out
[20:18] to eat and she said, "What do you think
[20:21] about uh Christmas?" I said, "Well," I
[20:24] said, "We know Jesus wasn't born on
[20:27] Christmas day." And she proceeded to
[20:29] tell me the whole
[20:30] story. She had just went back into
[20:33] history. She's just a rank. She's just a
[20:34] center girl. She don't go she don't go
[20:36] to church anywhere. She said it come
[20:38] from a pagan
[20:41] uh holiday that the Roman Catholic
[20:43] Church set up. And she told me whatever
[20:44] day it was, she'd went back in history.
[20:46] She said it's plain as day that it's the
[20:49] sun god's birthday, the shortest day of
[20:50] the year.
[20:53] And they bring the shortest day of the
[20:54] year in. Well, they wanted when see
[20:56] after December the 22nd, I think it is,
[20:59] the um the next solstice starts, which
[21:02] is I guess the win, but it's going your
[21:04] days are getting longer. See your days
[21:06] get shorter till December the 22nd,
[21:07] right? That what? That's going down,
[21:10] right? Then what? Resurrects. The sun
[21:12] comes up on December 23rd and starts a
[21:15] new time of more hours and minutes in
[21:19] the day. Well, what they done is took
[21:21] the sun god's birthday, which is the
[21:23] round disc, that wafer that they give
[21:25] the people on their toes. She went
[21:27] through that whole thing. And I said,
[21:28] "Sister," I said, "You know
[21:30] more Baptist, right, than all the
[21:33] denominational religions in the world.
[21:35] You know more just by reading history
[21:40] than they'll ever know." She said, "It's
[21:42] just," she said, "Just put in just put
[21:44] in son God and put in son of God. Put in
[21:46] Christmas origin of, man. It'll just
[21:50] it'll just" And she said, "It's a pagan
[21:51] holiday." I said, "I know." I said, "But
[21:53] we do it." I said because you know we I
[21:55] just like this time of the year just the
[21:58] way I am but I like to give things and
[21:59] get things. So um well it says blessed
[22:02] he that gives. So y'all just give all
[22:05] you
[22:05] [Laughter]
[22:08] want. Now I want you to be blessed.
[22:14] Amen. I want you to be blessed.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] Hello sister. You better get started.
[22:22] But now that brought the son god see to
[22:25] the son of god which has nothing to do
[22:27] with it. Okay. So we know Jesus wasn't
[22:30] born on December the 25th or whatever
[22:32] they 24th whatever say it was but we
[22:34] know that something did happen when that
[22:37] person was born. He became the son of
[22:39] man. A man that could be God in human
[22:42] flesh and live like a man, die like a
[22:45] man, but be almighty God in human flesh.
[22:47] And that's exactly what he wants this
[22:49] new kingdom to be. He wants a man in
[22:51] human flesh to walk in human flesh to be
[22:54] a human being but to be God made
[22:56] manifest. All right. Okay. Let's turn
[23:00] this off so we don't
