harsh harsher than even than it used to be and we know what that is that's the Earth groaning and waiting for the manifestation of me and you whether we can speak to a storm and it'll go away where we can can divert a tornado where it doesn't hit your house because Satan would love to kill every one of us and if he get one little one little crack but we're not gonna let him get in that crack hey man we're going to keep our Shield up and keep everything going well now April the first which is this coming Saturday will be Bible study all right I haven't found a place to have it yet besides here

brother Bob and him in prayer they'll all be all of them will be traveling back this afternoon so we want to keep them in prayer so let's go to the Lord in prayer and then we'll begin continue with the son of man dear Lord thank you for this day you give us thank you for the time that we have here to spend Lord around your word father I pray that you would give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our trespasses Lord as we forgive those who trespass against us Lord I pray that you should be with us father and just bless the time that we have Lord just bless our ears that we may hear from you father in our ears that we may see you Lord in the manifestation of the word be with the ones that are sick Lord sister Freedom different ones Lord and brother Colin brother darling one the ones that are getting older father and harder to travel sister Regina different ones Lord I pray that you'd help them because I know for a fact they want to be here Lord but the spirit is willing as Jesus said but the flesh is weak well father we pray that you should strengthen our flesh that you would strengthen us like Caleb being 80 something years old he said give me my mountain so it didn't bother him he was looking at a promise he wasn't looking at his flesh if we looked at our flesh every day we'd never go to work we'd never go to church but father we as our brother said we got to overcome we got to fight our way through this this is a birth and then this is life that we got to live through we got to fight our way out of the womb and fight our way into heaven so father I pray that you'd help us in that battle you said you would and as we're going to talk about you today Lord you anoint the word that we're about to speak in Jesus name we pray amen still on the son of man part 96 in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what you brought here today you brought your flesh but if you have the Holy Ghost today you brought God in your flesh into this building all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory now when uh speaking just for a few minutes about beheld is Glory how are you going to behold his glory in a book no oh a picture no person behold his glory in a person all right so we're going to be whole that's what we're doing now we're beholding the glory of the stature of a perfect man or the stature of Jesus Christ all right and the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we'll go through II Peter 1 5 and I told you since June this morning I'm going to take a little bit uh we're trying to get through these virtues but God's kind of taken us on little rabbit trails and and that's okay as long as we get back to the regular Trail all right and besides this giving all diligence act to your faith virtue and divert you knowledge and acknowledge Temperance and Temperance patience and patience godliness and we're going to get the godliness Maybe next week the Bible tells us because you need to be patient with me as brother Jack was talking about that's really wonderful that he he kind of put the little exclamation point on on what we've been talking about patience but that's the way God works listen how many times you've been sitting in a in a service and and you swear that the pr the preacher that comes from from Arizona comes out here and preaches a sermon and y'all swear that I sit there and talked about you all the whole time all weekend no we don't that was the Holy Ghost doing his job through a man he yielded himself in the Holy Ghost knows what you need I don't know everything you need today but the Holy Ghost knows everything you need and he can bring it through the foolishness as the Bible says of preaching the Bible says in in your patience possess ye your soul First Timothy 3 16. that's what we might get to today may not says and without controversy now that's without anybody sitting down debating that's without anybody sitting wanting to know what your opinion is and your opinion is in your opinion it's without controversy now I wish we could stay on that for a while without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached into the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into the glory now guess what that's your same Journey that's your same Journey that's you so now let's look here just for a minute this is where I was we were looking and sometimes people look at you when you say well God had a plan well you know we sat down like brother John said we have a plan we we do a budget that's the way we do it with Dave Ramsey you do a budget you sit down and you make a plan you plan out what you're going to do uh you can tell people it's just wandered through life and not had a plan all right amen and then you've seen people that had a plan and purpose of what they're doing so God had a plan and a purpose and brother Brown said we'll see it a little bit that he foreign knew who would want to be saved so let's look at the plan just for a minute because I want to make a point here in just a second Jesus died for one purpose and that was to save those who God foreknew would be saved now we're going to talk a minute about predestination but remember that as I was talking to a brother um Saturday or Friday and uh we were talking about you know you look at a you look at a a crowd of people and you go to these meetings and camps and different things and you see 300 400 500 people and they come under the message Under the Umbrella of the message of the hour now listen we're all anointed for a purpose but some are anointed for this some are anointed for that I can't play an instrument I pray that God's anointed me to be able to preach instead of playing an instrument so we have each have a place like brother Brown was talking about each each joint the Bible says each joint supplies you need these hands if I have hands man you wouldn't be able I wouldn't be able to carry something out it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to do your job maybe so God brings us together under this umbrella of the message but then you have to do what brother Brown says you have to go all right there's mate believers True Believers unbelievers make Believers True Believers so you got to separate them out God does God sits there and he looks at and he separates them out we don't but buy your fruits you'll be known then there's a group that's going to be a foolish virgin and they're gonna they're gonna separate their self out because this is a if not you know you know God to do remember what brother Brown said if I was God I tell you one time I tell you one time and that'd be it I wouldn't stand there and preached 75 or a thousand years or 200 years or 120 years he said I tell if I've got I tell you one time if you didn't do what I said then out you go but God's a good god he's a patient God and he's patient with each one of us he knows our needs and he knows the things to give us that's right here God foreknew who would be saved so by foreknowledge he foreign knew that you would want it so here you are sitting in the message Church and you've got all these different groups inside of that then you got foolish version then like one brother said he said you got the sleeping version some of y'all need to wake up but y'all are not asleep yet so I said yeah wait till this afternoon but remember the five wise virgins this late fall asleep okay right right it was ten and all 10 of them fell asleep they all ten woke up but they were some that had what a plant God had a plan for these people and he also had a plan to fulfill with these people even the 144 000 brother Branham he tells us he said that's the remnant now he said it's the same material as they would with my shirt or my jacket or my vest they started with this big piece of material and they cut out well they didn't throw that piece away they maybe used it for something else to make this that make a pair of socks or make a a handkerchief or something out of it that's the remnant that God's Gonna Save the Jews the 144 000 and and where with the plan of God in the plan of God everybody with me on this and we'll try to make it where you got to figure out where you are today right when we realize who we are and what we're doing here right right we'll be in Invincible Army some people said well I don't know if I'm this I don't know if that you better just put your estate down somewhere and say this is it right because you're going to be a part of some group right right True Believers night Believers and unbelievers one of the three all right so then you take that and you take okay we've got a group now that's predestinated to be saved all right believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved there's our group and by with me then that group then stops to be the foolish virgin does it go on to receive the Holy Ghost then you've got a bride you got a bride that that La ghost receives the message of the hour and begins to live a good Christian Life then you've got another group that's predestinated they're predestinated brother Brown said to adoption because not everybody is predestinated to adoption that's why I'm telling you you got to get yourself into the plan somewhere find out where you are find out where you're not and that's by the foolishness of preaching brother John what he preached today to me that just that helps you place your mind not just so much on dollars and cents but since s-e-n-s-a not c-e-n-t-s the sense that you have that same sense that you apply to that plan he's talking about you need to apply to the plan of God amen right amen figure out where you're at figure out what you're doing here why am I here Lord you ever just sit down and said why me Lord why am I here what what am I doing here so there's that group that's adopt this predestinated to adoption we'll read it here in just a few minutes I'll let brother random lay the plan down for us a little bit but I want you to understand so that the plan is adoption so there's a group of people that's going to go all the way up the statue of perfect man to there where it says Holy Spirit and they're going to be a Powerhouse of God but then there's another group of people oh don't get quiet that group's gonna take a body change that group's gonna be the Abraham group the Enoch group we'll talk about it in just a few minutes but that's a group that's a as it goes more and more to the Head it gets narrower and narrower and narrower brother Branham said one time a knife blade Edge now it don't look too much but you take that knife blade and you put it under a microscope it goes to nothing if it's a very sharp blade it just goes to nothing that's how fine it's going to be and God didn't decide which one you got in you did that's your perfect man he would that all would have a desire in their heart to be headstone people which would be the son of man the part of God knows that we can understand now excuse me ticker flea one got the back of my head we don't have to laugh so hard so Jesus look Jesus died then for one purpose but but he knew who would or who what he didn't own a cross I don't think he was a human dying the father knew Joel that's the same person yeah it is but that remember he moved over in another form called a son and remember brother Brown said he didn't know all things as a son come on somebody remember he didn't know about what was going to happen to to what to Elijah and Moses showed up and told him about the resurrection right right so there are certain things to me and you that that we've got to hang on and hang on and hang on and hang on to and then if you let go then whose problem is it our problem your problem my problem when I let go of God because he said he'd never let go of us but he knows who who is going to be saved and who not somebody asked brother Brown said did Brother Brown God knows who exactly will be saved he said correct but we don't as ministers we don't we don't put people in classes we put our own self in class amen so let's continue on so now that there is a plan remember the the definition of a plan is a method of achieving an end that's what a plan is when you're going to build a house you start with plans and when you get finished with that plan you walk into the house so it has an end to it like like I've always said sin has an expiration date sin has an end to it but God doesn't have an end to it the blessings of God doesn't have an end to it but there's a detailed plan that God had and a purpose for everybody to be on the face of the Earth you got to figure out which one you are why are you saying that I don't want anybody to get lost in the well we got to be this Great Mighty get born again get born again know that you're in that group then say Lord help me through these virtues so that I can understand more about you than I did when I became a Christian ever how many years ago two three four ten fifteen twenty fifty ever how many are ten minutes that's right God knew there was going to be somebody saved and there had to be a preparation so see he knew somebody's going to be safe so he had to make a way for him to get back he knew somebody was gonna what just take these say Lord give me these virtues so he had them there he displayed them well I don't know about that so you cut yourself off there had to be a preparation or a way made for them to be saved if there wasn't salvation wasn't possible so God for knowing that people would be saved knowing who they were he had to lay a plan down now you say brother Brown then God knows exactly who would be saved correctly why does he say he's not willing that then he should perish he isn't God is not willing than any he actually went to the Cross to save everybody what that wanted to be saved he isn't willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance but the or in order to be God he has to know who will do it or he wasn't God because he's omnipotent he's I'm the president he's omniscient he knows everything he's at every place and all-powerful so for knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this what he foresaw this today he first saw this right here today and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning what time are we in in time right we're not in the beginning time we're at the end time so I don't say forget about the beginning but don't worry about the beginning you worry about the end time and therefore knowing that all these marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things that we now see God had to make a preparation for it what the Holy Ghost was given for cool the evening he'd come down and commune with him and he lost that Fellowship because sin would not let him do it and then he was made flesh and walked Among Us in order that he could come back again to man and live in man look and restore man to a state of communion with him again I know this is simple but you're gonna have to get this Plan of Redemption down before we can go and rise on up into these virtues know that you want them and his brother John said listen I'ma read you a quote because I want us to understand when they went in the promise they went into the Promised Land right they were promised people in a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of ground once they got there so it's not picnic it's a battle he can give us forks and spoons to fight with that's to eat with restore man to a state of communion with him again and give him back his god-given right that's what he did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you look working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him heirs and join heirs with Christ giving you a place giving you a part for your Fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt to lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman look when it strikes your heart and takes us Abode there's a thirst and hunger for lost souls he's out here no it's me for no more no I won't everybody say when I walk in the store and I look at people and I go van if you just knew just give your heart to God and you see people like say bro John you see people it's just you know just debt Laden and they can't make ends meet and and they're in their grocery carts that you know that full of junk yeah junk and you're like Lord of Mercy anyway that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough Spirit touch in it to go for the souls of the Lost and the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul-winning program how pitiful today as we meet today is it not that you want I I don't want to come in here and want me saved I want you safe I do I want you to say I'm a servant servants are wanting people I get up and I look in the mirror and I make sure as as mama always tells us check your tire check your uh coattail or your shirt tail and your zipper and your hair to make sure everything's good before you walk outside she always told Daddy to do that check this check this check this and I say Lord God whether you throw me out in the ditch help somebody today help one person I don't care if it's a whole group because some of y'all already asleep it's not helping you at all now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind see folks this is where we're going brothers and sisters if you're not in the mind of God you'll never get in the mind of God so you got to know and realize if you're born again today you are not just and the mind of God you are the mind of God all right and he got a plan and a purpose and there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and look he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first it wasn't even a moon star out of molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God's an object of worship there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and thank God that he sent us a prophet that could go into the mind of God he says in the Christ the mission Garden let's go back into the back part of God's mind and let's see what God's thinking about because remember if it's a false doctrine that ain't the mind of God that's the mind of the devil there's only two powers and then him was love and him was Father and Son Savior and him was to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God so we need to know then that we need to add as our new birth we need to add to that if we're going to be in that group that wants more of God right all right amen some don't but you should you know why some people don't want more God they don't have any God in them well don't get quiet think about it but what's more important than anything else the word of God the word of God is more important anything else brother Brown will tell you the Bible tells you seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these other things will be added to you we put everything in the world in front of the word of God and I'm included we we don't we insert things between us and God God does it except him we insert well I can't because I because I when we're going to start saying brother like brother said we're gonna start saying what God Said not what we said her not what your neighbor said or not what the other guy said or this guy said I'm worried about what God Said all right what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being home so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back now remember brother Brown I'm standing here let's see what is I can't remember where that where I got that quote from but he's standing in he's preaching this probably in the 60s because he's talking about holding a group of people that has the same kind of ministry he's standing there knowing that he has brought that Ministry on Earth he's brought the ministry of Jesus Christ the son of man message he's brought back to this earth and he's now trying to get a people to see it but he knows they're only a small group that honed group is going to be able to see it listen folks I don't want us to say well I've been in the message and I don't I don't why do we stamp dates well I've been in Memphis 40 years I've been in the next 20 years I've been here at this church 40 years well why you still act like you do if you've been in church 40 years praise the Lord anyhow but the same kind of ministry listen this this is your changer right Jesus Christ will change you and make your soul perfect but that's not all there's another group that's going to let the message of the hour dig deeper and get into the virtues of God and not have the virtue of your mama and your daddy and your brother and your sister you have the virtue of God yeah I want the traits and characteristics of him now a man's gonna fail every man that ever come out alone and said why they failed right you failed right then because you're going to die if God don't change your body but there's something inside his brother Louise your Soul's worth ten thousand worlds and you sit here and just fall asleep and you don't even say man some of y'all said man it'd crack your face open why you need if you don't what are you here for right right what do you hear go find you a ball game somewhere go find you something that stimulates your soul if there's no stimulate your soul you got an issue not with me you got an issue with God you're to walk in that door supercharged amen not just charged up supercharged and he's back to not hear from me and brother John or bro her brother Louise to hear from God that God's gonna talk to you I'm sorry we are so dilatory this church and every other Church we ought to be on fire this is it this is the end time this is the last this is the fourth quarter manage I said it to him um soccer game the other day matters born as golf but to somebody else it was pretty exciting and I'm telling you guys they they go for an hour and score one point yeah it's the way you run this away and kick and kick around this way and kick kick kicking and stop run this away and kick kick run this one kick kick but that was two or three people sitting down below us and I'm over there going oh man when will this thing end but there's mamas and daddies down there they're like go down Johnny wasn't him on the field he just looked like Johnny the mama but they were happy yeah because their kid was kicking a ball no and it wasn't gonna be but one to nothing but they were excited about it you know you're not going to go to a soccer game and it'd be 52-54 our 54 to 52. now football you do basketball you do baseball in a hard time you might get that but soccer is going to be one zero zero zero zero but what the two though they played 60 minutes and I mean they're like one Mill game was over it goes to screaming get that one point and then kids is running it one minute why they knew the game was fixing to be over upside down and upside though that's back and forth but they knew they had one minute somebody needed the score and it was a frenzy that's what it should be here [Music] and that's not working anything up that's coming from here out yes amen amen look that pyramid will stand again the house of God what is the house of God it's not bricks and mortars you will live again the Tree of Life is growing again listen to this Genesis 5 verse 22 now here is Enoch now what does Enoch type he types the rapturing or the translated Saints is that right he was translated without seeing death and what was his confession what was the Bible's commentary of Enoch he walked with God he didn't sit down with his finger stuck on his he walked with God even after he begotten Methuselah 300 years you think he was bored he lived 300 he lived 900 something years of self or 500 something years I'm sorry then he had a kid that lived 900 years and all the days I mean it was 365 years and here is the last commentary of Enoch and Enoch walk with God and he was not for God took him he was a great stonemason one of the greatest that ever lived because you know why his pyramids made it through the flood oh don't get quiet his pyramids made it through the flood they're still standing like they were seven thousand years ago 8 000 years ago he was a matter of why we had a master Stone Mason that came 2 000 years ago and he built the church and that church the gates of hell is going to try but it will not Prevail against it come on people we're letting it Prevail we're letting it happen it happened you know it's coming as we get older we know death is coming but do you know one thing for sure we're sitting here today I was thinking about coming to church I don't know the statistics I was going to look it up but I got caught up in the singing with y'all didn't look it up you know by the time this Church's service is over and we go out to eat that five or six thousand people in the United States have died over the world it's probably 10 15 000. I don't know you can Google it 50 people in in Georgia May die of a car wreck before in a car wreck before we get out of church service we're not guaranteed anything at all think about a group of people over there that was in Turkey not too long ago they were sitting comfortable in their homes their high rises and all that and within one minute seven or eight thousand of them died by that earthquake just like that what are you saying brother Wade we better get serious you are not guaranteed your next breath and as the song says do you want your lord to be satisfied with you there was another man Noah these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God what is this this is a walk yeah now watch what brother Brown said in an adoption series you ready for this wake up because here it comes the land was provided and divvied up by Inspirations talking about the children of Israel going into the promised land everybody with me and each one I could take the scripture and show it to exactly that he put them into place where he was supposed to be now positionally that's what we're talking about now come on they got into the land and then they were placed where they're supposed to be how did the two and a half tribes was to stay across the river how did their mothers cried at their birth and each one had their place was supposed to be and after you're in that don't mean that you're free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see Canaan did not represent Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fighting and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk and there's where the church is failing today on that walk right we should believe brother man was a Prophet this is not my idea I'm just reading it right straight off of you well you're reading this when I'm reading it and I got a big old Red Bull letters do you know even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed so I Tell You Folks when you don't see me up here praying for nobody you'll know my hands up and the first thing I say is God do not let anything in my life hinder them from being healed oh brother you need to be over there praying with a machine no if I have something and if I stop it I'm gonna have to give an account for it right but if I can say God if they don't get their healing it's not because something that I'm doing or not doing do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You believers they didn't say unbelievers so let's take the make-believers and unbelievers out let's just talk to you Believers right now your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you said now wait a minute brother well that's the truth think of it so think about that that's why that's why I'm telling you that everything that we do is not do's and don'ts if you'll really think about it I know it's on paper that that you should do this and shouldn't do that you got your Ten Commandments you got all these things you know you got all that you know dressing in there and we got all these things that we and then brother Brown comes up and in church order and I've got the book back there finally I found one that I could read um Church order and Doctrine and brother man said one time he says you can't wait for the doors to open to get in here to worship God next time he says 20 to 30 minutes before the service you need to be in here praying some of y'all get here two minutes before the service you know what you're doing you're dragging all them demons you got in here you talking about me yep you're two or three feet come in two or three minutes before the service starts yeah I'm talking about you but you get quiet all you want to but it's time for us if we don't get in this plan the plan is going to move on so there's a purpose for us to come don't come in here because brother wasted you got to be here 20 minutes full of service you you'll be a desire to get here early and to get up bro Graham even talks about coming to the altar he said if you want to quietly slip down here and pray he said you come down here and pray he even says one time if you want to be prayed for let them pray for you for the service Stars hmm we wait till the end when all the anointing well if you need help at first I'd really get that demon off of you now and then I preach a lot better and you can listen a lot better unconfessed sin because the church to fail help me God help me God I know we're human I know we make mistakes I know we have things in our mind that running through right now like wanting me to shut up and and shoot shoot that man hey brother I'll tell you he's honest he go to work with brother brother we plant tapes and this before Daddy got in the message he'd be playing tapes and the devil said just reach and grab that steering wheel and push push him off the road kill him just kill that guy get him but thank God he did he did see what he overcame that demon that was trying to tell him that so you would have to do the same thing how do you overcome resist the death and he will flee from you not just move over but flee listen if he can tip tempt Jesus himself he's so gonna attempt you but how did Jesus he didn't come and do some magic he didn't do some miraculous healing to prove to the devil he said devil it is written this devil it is written devil or Satan it is written it's all he said that's all then when the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's what the Bible says you know what we do when body men to sit down and have coffee tea meal I'm talking about all of us today if we're going to be a honed group to get up into this statue of perfect man we've got to start living walking different of us why has God give us 60 years since a prophet left 60 years for us to get this message right because remember he didn't come preach no other no more sermons he got all the sermons done so in 1965 in December then he passed on he has no more sermons to deliver to us he and I'll promise you one things for sure if you think he's coming back then you are a lazy bum because that's what it makes you well we're waiting on brother round to come back you know why because you can sit down and sit in your couch with your legs folded and listen to tapes that's not what the Bible said I'm worried about more Jesus coming than I am brother Brown coming I better get Jesus in here so I can see him when he comes what are the prophets coming back we know but he's not going to come back on his own he's bringing all those with him but it's going to be because somebody some group of people took their self and said God use me I don't want to see brother Gary Atkins I want to see brother Ray all the different ones brother Richmond [Music] I want to see him in their youth I want to see him come get screaming through the door and not even have to open it and you can hug them what a mystery that's what we're looking at that's what the word is going to do it'll change you it will not cause you to get worse if you get worse you get worse for your own accord the word of God as brotherdale's always said those of you don't pay your tithes pay your tires for one year every service or not every service but pay your time you know how to do that pay your tires pay often if you're not better in a year he said he'd give you everybody'll be back he has never had to give a dime back if you'll do what God Said and I promise you if you'll come to church that's why y'all fighting y'all fight each other not each other between you'd fight your other your other your other person one of your personalities no you fight yourself you fight yourself you're not fighting God you fight yourself go like I said before you take all the what brother Brown said about coming to church the reason he said 20 minutes early or 30 minutes early he knows we're human he knows we got to get all that cleaned out he knows that he looks back in the Old Testament and he sees Saul Saul is trouble with evil spirits the Bible says come on somebody troubled relieval spirits and what happens somebody come in and shout and scream and lay hands on him no he called he said man I feel good when David comes and plays that harp Spirits left him amen that's why we sing to begin a service with that's why we worship to begin a service with not because it's in an order is to get all those demons at least get a mask up against the wall if you can't get them out of here what's maximum up against the wall Brothers you keep them up there but look I'm not going to get anywhere but we're going to get to this we are made Protectors of his Holiness we in his damage [Music] I am now listen listen to this his word made flesh again in us oh brother never look what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the word in you making yourself real listen it's scary to see a a a a a a foggy anointing or or something come over and you can see it but Satan can do the exact same thing but when you get it right in here when that light shines from here out Satan can't impersonate that he cannot oh I know you think I'm thinking of my hand but oh brother do you see it triumph over every denomination God made manifest in a living Temple and the word of God which is God is made flesh where in you why you're seated in Heavenly places triumphed over all things in Christ Jesus amen Psalms 42 says deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water spouse all thy ways and abilities are gone over me his brother Brown talks about this is what he said in the film deep calls to the Deep now before when the Deep calls to the Deep before they can be a deep call there has to be a deep to respond to it that's why you can't sit still in the Church of a living God and have a deep call inside it's got to come out or you don't have it at all I'm just reading this listen people get happy with coupons now you're talking about coupons get happy when I get coupons in the mail tell me I'm a postal to every person they come up to the post office I didn't get my coupons today well they'll be in your mailbox tomorrow I'll get okay I get it I gotta go to Kroger I gotta go to this place I gotta go Church before they can be a deep call there has to be a deed to respond listen there's something in there called out for more of God you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it now the very reason that there is a Holy Ghost is because you were hungering for it you would never hunger for it unless there was something in here to call for it out of there see what I mean what would God call the people out of this evil age for his name the reason of it is is to try her his bride oh and picnic folks you know that the reason is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to who Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end I wrote myself a note I want God to be proud of me I want my Lord to be satisfied with me right I want my life to be what it has to be and when I come to the great eternity I want him to say come on in I'm satisfied with him but those of us that want more of God we want virtue the strength of God the knowledge of God to know right from wrong not right from wrong out there it's it's nice to know that that you know people like brother John are teaching these courses but of uh sorry but a devil possessed person can can get their finances right you know but a Christian a devil can't get a Christian right a devil always make you wrong but something inside of us the knowledge that we need God and then yes we need to work on our finances right you can call her all you want to it's good to have money in your pocket I thought I got a lot more a man without laughing than the whole sermon it's nice to have a little jingle in the pocket right if you get it the right way and you paid your tithe then God pours out a blessing then praise the Lord Temperance self-control tempers doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol no temperature doesn't mean alcoholic cure it's Bible Temperance Holy Spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh how to control your temper and we all have an issue with that okay fly off every time anybody speaks crossed to you boy a lot of us is going to fall off before we get started aren't we remember brother Branham I guarantee you when he's sitting here standing here preaching this sermon he's remembering in his mind that he almost killed a group of kids because of his temper he almost killed a man because of his temper that went right through his head and that listen that went right through Peter's head too Peter cut a man's ear off before he got the Holy Ghost so he could say add to your faith virtue I like what the brother said not too long ago he said Peter was the one that could he he lived it that's why he could say add to your faith but then Paul comes and tells you how to do it because really just Peter says add your faith virtue and all his temper's patience and he kind of gives you a little commentary but the whole everything uh that Paul has to say is putting these virtues in line so that we'll know how to do it know why boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started then we wonder why God is not in his church doing miracles and things that they used to do yes sir Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath just spoke to you somebody say you bunch of Holy Rollers don't jump out roll up your sleeves now but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says when you're riled up round up back let him be your example if you still blow up and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't got enough Temperance you can't add that because it won't add it won't vulcanize then we're talking about vulcanization the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it and remember we know what vulcanization was it is a process that puts something together that can't be pulled back apart so what he's saying by the way the impact of this is this is that you're not going God's not going to give you Temperance and then take it away from you you're not going to take take temperatures away from me once you get it and you get it solidified in there he's not going to take it away from you it can't be reversed vulcanization white brother I'm use that word vulcanization he only used it inside your perfect man because he knows that when we get right here look it's a scripture says in Ephesians 4 talks about compacted that's what that Holy Spirit does what do we do when we build houses and when we build things and brother Gary was here to tell you that Foundation has got to be good so we had a uh we used to a long time ago we'd had a tamping rod this whole thing or remember ozani and you Tamp that thing down and you Tamp it down and Tamp it down then you put your concrete over it but if you didn't if it was just something you just throwed a bunch of loose sand out there and then you tried to build the foundation well guess what's going to happen it's going to fall off one side or the other same way with us that's why we've listened to brother Dale for 40 50 years that's why now you're listening to all these ministers Louise Friday I appreciate the ministers we have in this church absolutely appreciate them and I'm telling you too the Bible talks about exercising your gift I told him I said y'all need to get out if anybody invites you to preach don't say no go because you get better the more you practice the Bible says exercise your gift and that's what we want to do we want to let them yeah let preach it Wednesday nights and preach different time I want to exercise her gift I want them to be able to bring something to us that we can take in it's not just me and brother Dale and that's it it's a five-fold Ministry that we listen to all that we benefit from Brother Jack Duff coming in and bringing what he brought last weekend and bring in a different angle of sanctification I mean uh patience battles well that's what the whole thing is I just never said it and I never looked at it that way but this is all a battle patience is the battle right somebody tell me they've whipped patience we pray for liars right right so guess what we need patience from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that's why we come to church that's why we listen to the prophet's message that's why we that's why we gather together what to bring us together you know what Satan is he divides and conquers listen to this let me give you something that'll help you remember Satan divides and conquers that's why the the pope you know he's always that's not Victory he's dividing and conquering everywhere he's going he's separating you from God now listen when Satan separates you from God I promise you he's got somebody that he's going to hook you up with he's just not going to separate you and let you just go out into the woods no he's got somebody in mind when he was there in Nicea Satan knew if he got the church away from the true believers he could have a pope amen he can have a denomination so he was divine and conquering but remember he's got his own plan he's got his own agenda if he separates you from the church he's got something where he's going to send you to and it ain't good think about that yeah he's a divider but guess what he he's got something else he's got in mind that he's going to bring you in his way what do you do with Adam and Eve he didn't just separate them he knew what he would do if he could get him separated he knew what he could do with Eve everybody with me so let's compact it by that whichever joint Supply according to the factual working as a measure of every part make its increase of the body into the edifying itself in love in other words that word means knit together to cause a person to unite with one in a conclusion or come to the same opinion prove demonstrate teaching struck that's what we need is the compacting of this message of the hour instead of having all these different doctrines Bob and I were talking um Friday and and uh brother Whidbey made a comment years ago this before he passed away we were at a um Minister's breakfast up in Ruth and there was probably 100 preachers in the in the building and probably whippy looked around he said how many different doctrines you think's in this room right now supposed to be just one the message but Satan what dividing and conquering he's trying in the message to divide and conquerors close he's wanting to send you to another person he's wanting to send you to a tape Ministry he's wanting to send you to Jeffersonville I'm sorry folks he's wanting to send you to somewhere that's off the word of God all right let's have patience just for a second we'll close right here Old Testament because to have real God depending birth because we read many there's more scripture about patience and it's in the Old Testament but now there's many scriptures that talks about being patient but it doesn't say that word it talks about long-suffering and talks about all these different things so let's read them here in the New Testament it's the characteristic of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and party so you can't just say well I'm just patient no there's something you got to be patient with and what wrote around tell us to be patient with God listen to this just for a second and we'll close Hebrews 6 verse 10 said for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope until the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through look through faith and patience inherit the promise for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he lifted his hand and he said Adam let's go back Adam I'm gonna do it Abraham I'm gonna do it Jesus come to the earth I am the I am I am the one that's going to do it you just need to plug yourself into me for when God made promise to Abraham because he couldn't wear nobody else he swear by himself James 1 verse two my brother encountered all joy when you fall into many Temptations what Joy when you fall into one Temptation no that word diverse means many Temptations there's not a person in here that's not going through some kind of Temptation knowing this all right James is he's giving us the mind of God knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her isn't she whoops it's a bride but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect an entire warning nothing well John you paid way too much for that house but with your but with your patience in your patience possess you your wallet in your back pocket that feels good doesn't it amen feels good I think when we first took the Dave Ramsey course that was back in my goodness to the 2000s we had 6 500 in in um credit card debt which is not much compared to the average now everybody's got it's like twenty thousand dollars but we paid that off in about two months we just found things it was just things laying everywhere we sold stuff all right he said sell so much stuff that you kids get nervous you wake up with a price tag on your thumb you get twice as much for me but that's the same way with the gospel that was things John did that was things Alicia give up to have what they have so why saying why don't we and we know that we that's okay like I said it's okay to have money it's okay to build certain things here you gotta have money to survive and it does make you feel good when you got a little bit left over and you paycheck but if you put everything on that you become a rich young ruler where you believe the message you don't cut your hair you don't smoke you don't drink everybody with me sell it all at all and follow me he couldn't do it and where do you lift up his eyes in hell he had missed it because of his riches he had missed it because of his job he'd missed it because he built a bunch of Barns and he needed to get more stuff in it we don't have stuff do we okay bless your heart that's why they're building these that's why they're building these storage units like hundreds at a time Maysville George Georgia's got 150 pictures they ain't that many people in the whole town but you know what they'll fill them up why because stuff let's get rid of my stuff the weight of sand is so easy besides us and let us run with patience even by the walk with God but today brother George we gotta run and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the Son of God now we're supposed to do his work he said he that believeth on me John 14 7 he didn't believe it's gonna be the worst that I do shall he do also you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in US now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know I know it I read the scripture along both Dale preached on this long time ago about your brother Ram said running preach running without a message or running ahead of God's program God's got a program and a plan and we got to be right there with it we can't run ahead of it that's what he's saying right here look you know I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of ministers Christians now he ain't talking about unbelievers he talked about Sinners prostitutes he's talking about us ministers Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right because we trying to go ahead of God's program that's why I'm here is to try to teach them teach the church and my and my The Dwelling Place of the Living God how many like that congregation says amen second Peter 3 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slightness but it's what long-suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish as brother Brown was telling us but that all should come to repentance James 5 verse 7 says be patient musicians come on be patient therefore Brethren to the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth and half long patience for it folks if you ever realize this we talk about Genesis 1 and we talk about going back into eternity and there's only God himself right but he had attribution he wanted to have these things he wanted to have all these children he wanted to have these people that were a walking living breathing instrumentality of God Amen but remember for him to be and have a plan and purpose he would he will save you a Healer a redeemer and all these different things he had to not make man get lost he had to allow us to make a choice and in our choice we got lost so he could become a savior he could become a redeemer he could become a Healer not be coming he always was it but you and I are the recipients of that so the husbandman Christ waited for the precious fruit of the earth us and hath long patience for it remember he had to drop down into time for me and you and right now we're separated from God we can't see God face to face hey man we can't see Jesus face to face we see him through the attributes we see him through pillow fire we see him through all these but we don't see the body of Jesus and we won't see him until we go to the marriage supper that's how much sin has pulled us apart from God but he made a way for us to get back in the spiritual realm and in that spiritual realm come on people that spiritual realm one day is going to take over this guy and it's gonna be God let's stand her feet come on Brian amen get in the plan come on but he's got so much patience until he received the former or early in the letter Reign be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord drawth now that was written 2 000 years ago then fourthly we want to add patience to your faith if you got faith the Bible says it worketh patience let's go on down brother Brown says we have Glory we have shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall slide off he can't build his church I read you this a long time when we first got started there's many examples even Paul looks at I believe it was the Galatians or somewhere somebody you all know who the scripture is where he looks and he said though I have all faith to move mountains right and the way he said though I have all Faith to move move them out have you ever done that before he said though I have all faith and though I know all the Mysteries but I have not charity I have not that love that he's talking about right there I'm a sounding brass a tinkling symbol just making noise so brother Brown Tate picks it up and he says right here in the Statue of perfect man paragraph 146 he says faith alone won't do it I bet you the theologians were having a fit because he was talking about faith he's talking about faith faith Foundation Faith this faith that and then he stops he says faith alone won't do it then Abraham we find out didn't obey God just right now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still have faith in the promise and then not obey still it'll hinder us that's where we want to get to still have faith in the promise and then not obey what do we read the scripture where where Samuel tell Saul kill them all get rid of the kings make sure that country does not ever rise up again even kill the goats and the animals and kill the kids I want them all destroyed that's what God Said through Samuel and then Saul takes it upon himself to save a few Sammy walks up he said do I hear some sheep blating out in your backyard and I hear two kings hollering and screaming in the jail though he had him in jail what do you tell them he said to obey is better than sacrifice because I'm sure Saul said well hey we're gonna bring them here we're gonna make we got all these all kind of uh sacrifices to God now with all these you know what Samuel done he took his sword y'all think we mean sometimes Samuel took his sword and he said bring him two kings out here he can just stab him cut their heads off right and you know what he'd done he had I believe he took that sword in the ground and he told Saul he said you have been rented from the house of God because you didn't obey because to obey what I said was greater than the sacrifice of you bringing all these people in here and bringing all this stuff and listen let me tell you and putting up with the demons we put up with all right hmm well that got all that was didn't it just faith alone won't work because faith without works is dead if you've got faith folks if we've got real true faith it will produce itself and people will be able to see it just like the borderline Believers let me get this and then we'll finish got people today you find in the Bible it said for it is impossible for those which are once enlightened and made partakers of the Holy Ghost wow pretty good believer message believer our message person and fall away to renew themselves again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh encounter below the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing I don't have to do that that's just old preacher telling me something and done despite to the works of Grace now in Hebrews 10 It also says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God and those people you've seen them come to church they'll come and they'll say oh yes I believe yes sir I but they'll they believe it but they'll never look lay their hands to it to turn one will to help it go on I'm just reading what prophet says don't be mad at me if you like brothers don't be mad cause I found this quote they believe it but they'll never lay their hands what they'll never want to go up that statue of perfect man they'll hinder they'll hinder Services they'll hinder off I'm just telling you what he says to turn one wheel to help it go on see now that's just like it was in the Bible like Caleb and Joshua come back with the evidence that they've been over in the promised land but those other believers well they weren't believers they were unbelievers oh it's too great we can't do it but they hung all along just the same remember Joshua and Caleb said we can take it the other 10 said like I preached one time ten line preachers they lied they lied but they you know what happened them 10 lying preachers they just kept right on going kept them all you know what they kept them all in the wilderness and then one day they all died except Joshua and Caleb because they did what God said they had that burning in their heart they had patience to wait 40 more years knowing that that promised land was only about 10 miles across the desert and they walked brother Dales walked with us 50 some years through all of our crying through all of our this and that and the other and all of our fussing and fighting Joshua takes him promptly Tyson promptly they never got to enter the promised land just those who came back with faith that we could now what if that group would have looked they said all the amorites grasshoppers well but you see Caleb and Joshua still to people because they wasn't looking at the amorites how big they were how big the cities were how big your sin is I give you the lambers now God give you your healing it's one of your assures well now God just didn't go over there and take a broom and sweep out the Canaanites and all the amorites and the hitters and all them and sweep them out say come on Ezra this is yours they've been planting crops for you no sir they had to fight for every inch of the way that's right but they had the promise of Victory God told Joshua wherever the soul of your foot dreads I'll give it to you so Footprints means possession remember that sister in a wheelchair remember that today any of you that needs healing Footprints means possession every time the sole of your feet touches that's it take that much ground take that much ground away from the
