TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen good morning Saints it's happy to be in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles let's turn to James 4 amen just enter into that Sabbath rest when you come in the house of the Lord and whatsoever things are of good report amen we could just bow our heads dear father Lord we thank you for this day thank you for allowing your people to gather here Lord just pray that whatever said Lord would be for the edification of the Saints Lord just to embolden us Lord in your spirit Lord just to give us guidance as we walk here on this Earth Lord and get ready for your coming just pray for those who wen't able to make it Lord and pray for forgive us of all our sins Lord and just get ourselves out the way just to focus on you this morning just lead us and guide us in all things Lord in your PR name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen James 4:1 from Once come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your own lusts that war in your members so we see this is the James's we know this is the state of the world where these fightings and wars that come from our lust our desires these wrongful desires and people are the reason people have so much trouble getting together is that they're they're too focused on themselves it's a selfish Spirit but James is even talking to the Christians in the church not just the world he's talking to the church saying why why are we even having these conflicts in the church you we're supposed to be set apart from the world you know we know that church is a a called out group as brother brandham says so why are there fightings even amongst the church and it comes from our lust our own selfish desires and uh something brother Ryan's really good at pointing out G does a great job in his uh love lesson series but he really talks about um how how he really points out how marriage is a a a service it's it's a selfless Endeavor you know and if you can't you can't have selfish people in a marriage because then you're going to butt heads all the time but you really you should be trying to give and give and give and then you're both looking out for each other and that's how it works but if one even one of you is selfish you know it's going to mess things up but if we can all be selfless if we can all look out for our brother and sister and look out for the other person you know then then that's going to create Harmony in the church even brother brandom said that your first love is is really Your Love First Love first and foremost priority should be God then it's your fellow man and then yourself so that's the order and we always need to remember that order so there won't be fightings and Wars among us as James is talking about in verse two ye lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not so even with with our our selfish desires even with and all the work that we put into doing these things and he's saying that people are killing and people are are are are doing going to Great Lengths to obtain what they want but they still are not obtaining what they want and no matter how much you try to pursue something you know if God's not behind it you're going to be left feeling empty so but but you the reason you have not is because you ask not and you ask a miss so those those are the reasons that you have not is because you're first of all you're not you're not going to the right source but also when you ask you're asking a Miss you're asking to uh consume it upon your lust as it says in verse three you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lust so even when you do ask there is a there's a way that you should have you should ask and and as the scripture says you know we're it's it's it's the idea of our lust and and and it's and it's our own personal desires our own personal what we want out of life what we want out of a conversation what we want out of something and if those desires don't align with God's desires there's going to be a lot of turmoil but we have to overcome those desires on oursel to be perfected and it'll it'll even be better for ourselves but also for our brothers and sisters in the church and and if you fail to do those things you're going to start asking God for things that are selfish and lustful and what we must do is conform our desire to God's desire and that's why Jesus prayed you know not my will but thy will be done and it's an example of of dismissing our own will and lust and submitting yourself to God no matter the sacrifice you know whether you want money or a new car and and God may not give you those things because you you probably don't need them you know we live in a uh we're we're blessed to live in a very rich country and there's many things that we don't really need but we might want certain things and God's not going to give you according to your wants all the time you might you might want uh a new car you might oh I have a nice car but Lord uh can I get it in red like no that's not that shouldn't be I desire that's that's asking a Miss that's asking a Miss is that you don't need that new car in red you don't need uh leather seats or whatever your preference may be but but sometimes God gives according to your want your needs and not your wants so sometimes when you ask something think do I really need this or is this just something that you know there's a there's a culture of consumerism here in America where you whatever the new thing is you got to get you got to get it it's on sale it's on sale it's on sale now it's not going to be on sale next week but it'll be on sale the whole year so it's just it's that that consumerism and trying to get you to get stuff all the time and and sometimes you get more focused on those things but when someone's in need you see how God shows up you you can see the the testimonies of Believers when they said they had a need and a desire and there was something they really needed and God showed up for them you know maybe they needed someone to go to and a brother or sister just called them and that was something they needed in that moment just a talk or a conversation or or a question to be to be asked and answered across the pulpit so those different things are the things that we should ask for ask for Revelation ask for a a healing we know that in the word God wants you to be healed he died for that he took those stripes to to to forgive you of your sins and cleanse you of those things to heal you of those you know those those those diseases and all those different things you may go through God wants to heal you so we know that by those desires that we cannot ask a miss and we're asking for healing because we know God wants to heal us God wants to see us uh in a better place and healed so those those are the things that he came and died for that's why he set activity captive so we know he wants us to be healed and so not not not that we ask things to fulfill our lustful desires but we ask things according to his will uh verse seven submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now resisting the devil requires submission to God you cannot resist the devil on your own merits know because there's no salvation in that but as it says uh in ation you must walk in the spirit to overcome the flesh that's how you resist the flesh so it's not just um it's not just you resisting but but your resistance is submission because there's only two Spirits as we know there's only two Spirits you can go to there there's you can submit to God or you can live how you want which is really what the devil wants you to do is live how you want live according to your own desires and not according to the moral principles laid out in the Bible so that that's what you need to submit yourself to and that's how you resist the devil you don't just resist the devil by saying I'm not going to do that or I just really don't want to and I'm going to get on this 30-day you know program or whatever it is but really you you resist the devil by submitting yourself to God you know you you resist those evil spirits by opening your Bible or listening to a tape or getting in the word reading reading a book that's how you resist the devil it's not just well I'm going to think really hard and try really hard not to do this but it's really you need to you need to surround yourself more so with good things it's not just get away from the bad things but you get away from the bad things by moving towards the good things you know that's why in verse eight he says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh unto you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded now that's an interesting uh I guess metaphor expression he uses there to say cleanse your hands ye Sinners and and and the and and purify your hearts you double minded so there there's a prescription there for uh perhaps two conditions that are one and the same but also a there there's some differentiation between them so cleanse your hands you Sinners hands are a represent representation of your actions and the things that you do everything you do with your hands you know I'm talking with my hands we drive with our hands we we we shake hands we everything we do we're writing down we're typing up you know if we work with our hands if we're plumbers if we're if we're in an office no matter what we're doing we're doing with our hands so everything that we do that's what the hands are the hands are our actions are our life the the the works that we do so that's what our hands are so if you're sinning if you're a sinner you need to clean your hands clean up your actions clean up your life clean up the way you talk to people the way you operate at work the way the way you you know handled uh disagreements or disputes with your brother or sister th those are your actions and then your whole life should be changed by that and then it says uh purify your hearts you double- minded now the heart is a um perhaps a more delicate matter but the heart is is that that's truly what your desires are your hands are your actions but your hearts are your desires so so you may be able to clean up uh maybe your actions but your if if your heart isn't clean you know you're still going to struggle to to to live these live live the right life because you're still kind of fighting in between your desires and those different things so both your desires and your actions have to line up that's why Paul even talks about a lot about you know how he he his desires are one way but his actions are another way and he's trying to fix that and he's trying to you know get through that as as a human being but we need to be make sure that we clean up both of those things so that they match up you know our desires might be in the right place but if our actions are in the wrong place then then as brother brandom said we have a we have a heart issue said when someone is not living right or not doing right according to the scriptures it's really a heart issue it's an issue of the heart and and someone needs to be converted so then that they'll be committed to the to or get a new birth experience and be committed to the word and be committed to those things in verse 9 be afflicted and mourn and weep and let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness now we we know earlier that we've talked about uh how how Jesus wants us to be healed he wants us to be in a better place you know we know the scriptures like uh we need peace that passes understanding but but here James is saying actually no be afflicted and mourn and weep and your laughter should be turned to mourning and your joy should be heavy you shouldn't be happy so and he he's not and and it's just kind of a strange thing to almost kind of wish that upon someone but he he he's saying this because he he's addressing he's addressing The Sinner and he's addressing uh he's he's he's addressing that sinful nature and he's saying know if your life if you're not living right your uh your life also shouldn't just you know be okay he he wants you to suffer through those things and part of that is is what's read in verse 10 in verse 10 says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up so sometimes God will allow hardships to come upon you to Humble you even in the Bible there are situations like uh Samson and David where God you know blessed them and but then they start to become prideful they start to take they have to start to take credit for for you know what what God has done in their life and then they get to these positions and they start doing things that they shouldn't be doing and that's why you know Samuel has to come and correct David and Samson has to pay you know a price for for his arrogance getting out out of control and trusting the wrong people and string off of you know you know what God called him to do so so when these things are James is really wishing Affliction on these people so that they they would humble themselves and that the Lord can lift them up you know but but sometimes God will send those afflictions to Humble you and there's many many testimonies where Believers will say oh well I wasn't living right and I just thought everything was okay and then something happened in their life something really struck them something something that was really dear to their heart you know in event something happened where where they had to turn to God and they got so desperate that they had nowhere else to turn so so God will put those things in your life to to Humble you so that you know cuz when you're when you're on top and when you think everything's good and it's very easy to do that especially and say in America or in other First World countries where there's a lot of uh prosperity it's very easy to feel like well your life is okay and you don't need God and and what's the point of that but but when something happens in your life and it brings you to a point of desperation you know and you get desperate enough that you'll seek out anything you know you James is is saying that you should seek out the Lord in those moments you know you should when you're Afflicted when your joy does turn to heaviness that's when you humble yourself before the Lord and then he lifts you up as the scripture says in verse 11 speak not evil of one another Brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge so why why was it someone that someone who why is it that someone who judges their brother or sister also speaks evil of the law because we know that Paul said in Corinthians that we we we need discernment we need to be able to judge things and we need to um we we we're going to be have to judge angels and and judge you know much higher things so we should be able to judge these lower things and that we that's why we shouldn't take our brothers and sisters to court because we should be able to to figure that out ourselves because we both have uh you know if we if we're both rooted in the scriptures and rooted in in Christ we should be able to to settle disputes among us in the church and not have to take it to a a federal or state level or whatever the case may be but then so so so Paul is saying that we need to be capable of judging and James is kind of saying that we shouldn't judge our brothers and sisters and actually when we judge we speak evil of the law so so what what is going on here do uh Paul and Paul and James need to have a ministers meeting or what what do we need to do what what is the uh reconciliation of the scriptures but if we read verse 12 it'll it'll be seen more clearly as it says there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another so so the issue here of judging the law is it's not that it's not the Judgment itself but it's rather the standard by which someone is judged so as James said there's one lawgiver and if you're judging someone based on your own standards you know that's wrong because the only correct standard to judge by is the Bible and God's word word you know and and we might look around and we might have disagreements and we might think that certain people should act a certain way or we might think that uh some people you know there might be uh preferences like oh maybe someone's not dressed nice enough or if you don't come to church dressed a certain way or or if you don't do things this way or the Pio needs to be played this way or the drums or or whatever the case may be or maybe know just different things that that that come between the brothers and sisters or just different judgments or how people handle things in their own life and their how they handle things with their family or maybe how they speak and and different things where we judge and we we have our own judgments and our own beliefs about how things should be done but all those things need to be brought back to a scriptural basis and that's why if we speak evil of each other we speak evil of the law because now we have made ourselves the lawgiver in that sense if there's if there's not a Biblical standard for it we have now superseded the biblical law with our own law in our own judgments that's why we've made ourselves uh We've made ourselves judge in that sense and that's not what we're to do we're suppos to judge by a Biblical standard so it's not the Judgment itself but it is the standard by which you judge and if the standard is your own standard then you have spoke evil of the law by putting your own law in there where it should not be and let's turn to Matthew chapter 7 if you have your Bibles Matthew 7 7 vers1 but even if there is a Biblical standard there is a way to that it even if there you are judging by biblical standard there's still there's still guidance for how you should judge even then so verse one says judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to to you again so even when you do judge I think the core of the scripture here is that you have to leave room for Mercy CU When when God judges there's room for Mercy because if we were to judge all of us by biblical standard no one's making it so we there has to be room for Mercy there has to be room for grace and even if you can point out something a brother or sister did and and it and it is in line with the scriptures you must also allow for Grace because that if you if you don't allow for grace that same measure will be brought upon you right we know that Christ in the in the law and he came to sacrifice himself and all those things so that there could be grace for us so when you judge by biblical standard you must leave room for grace even if you are correct you cannot be you not cannot let allow yourself to become arrogant or or high- minded but you must allow for the the same Grace that Christ allows for all of us and even if you maybe decide to uh uh what would I say like like full ful lay down the law on someone you know remember that that standard will be brought back upon you and verse three and why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye or how Willl thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye so part of that is is once you become too critical you end up becoming hypocritical because there's there's there's things in your own life that you need to confront first you know before you judge your brother you know you need to look what's in your own eye and get and get your own problems out the way so those standards will be imposed upon you and that's why you have to leave room for mercy and you have to make sure that you're also living righteously or or else your judgment really is misplaced and you need to First judge yourself by that standard before you judge your brother or sister so don't don't be so critical that you become hypocritical let's go back to uh James verse 13 James 4:13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now you rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin so that that's part of touching on uh that's why we say Lord willing because we know we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow we don't know what the future holds and we we don't know those things so we shouldn't speak so uh I guess confidently or or or solidly as as if we we have we have the answers you know and it's the same with judgment we can't we can't even judge what's going to happen tomorrow how are we going to judge our brothers and sisters and these things you know without without a standard you know without by making up our own standard we can't do that we have to judge by God's standard because even our life is a vapor we don't even know we don't know what could happen the next five minutes so there's nothing there's no standard there's nothing that we have within ourselves that that is worthy to bestow judgment and without the guidance of the Holy Spirit without the guidance of the Bible and without the scriptures and without all of these things so God bless you you're dismissed [Applause]
