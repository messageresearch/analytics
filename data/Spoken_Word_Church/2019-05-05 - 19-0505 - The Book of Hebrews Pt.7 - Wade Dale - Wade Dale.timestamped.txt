[0:00] someday as he says also in another place
[0:02] thou art a priest forever after the
[0:05] order of Melchizedek
[0:07] what was Melchizedek Melchizedek was a
[0:11] priest but Melchizedek the order of
[0:14] Melchizedek remember a lot of people
[0:17] think it was a priestly order which went
[0:19] down through the generations but it's
[0:20] not easy without father mother brother
[0:24] Graham said now wait a man without
[0:25] father mother how could this be a
[0:28] perpetual you know human guy how can
[0:31] this be a human man right now if he had
[0:33] on human closed and a head on a human
[0:35] flesh puppy on a flesh bag you just hit
[0:38] the bag up and step it out step 10
[0:40] addicted back up alright cuz look who in
[0:44] the days of his flesh
[0:45] we had offered up prayers and
[0:47] supplications with strong crying and
[0:49] tears under him that was able to save
[0:50] him from death and was hurt this time I
[0:52] Christ now
[0:54] now remember Melchizedek in the human
[0:57] flesh form was not Jesus Christ hear
[1:02] what I said in the human flesh form he
[1:06] was not Jesus Christ man but he became
[1:09] Jesus Christ when he became a baby and
[1:11] was born like me in you because milk
[1:13] acid it wasn't born in you okay that was
[1:16] just a body step he just created a body
[1:18] stepped into it that theophany of God
[1:20] stepped into that body talked to Abraham
[1:22] and then what happened is if you were
[1:24] able to see it then you see a man
[1:25] walking away from Abraham and he just he
[1:27] does take the ground he goes over into
[1:30] another dimension so that was not Jesus
[1:32] Christ the person
[1:36] this is the same because male calves are
[1:39] they didn't down for our sin Jesus
[1:42] Christ died for our sins now brother
[1:44] Brown said no because it didn't became
[1:45] Jesus Christ so you gotta be careful
[1:48] with that Mel Cassidy became Jesus
[1:50] Christ because the theophany that was in
[1:52] bill Cassidy that was talking to Abraham
[1:54] is the same theophany that was in that
[1:56] man called Jesus Christ not too
[1:59] different the Alpha needs not to differ
[2:00] God's right but the order of melchizedek
[2:04] being a priesthood it's not true today
[2:08] it's not a apostolic succession
[2:12] explained to you many times before even
[2:15] though being the assistant pastor this
[2:16] church if God forbid something wants to
[2:18] happen to that I don't immediately take
[2:20] over no way that's apostolic succession
[2:23] that's that's the old order back in the
[2:26] Old Testament where Aaron and his sons
[2:28] and his son son son son that ain't true
[2:31] in the New Testament what would happen
[2:35] is you would give me a list of preachers
[2:36] you wanted to hear we'd bring them in
[2:38] for two or three months and we'd see
[2:39] what you think about them then you could
[2:41] vote okay so it's not just um and thank
[2:46] god that's not that way yeah you don't
[2:49] want to be we've seen it
[2:51] preachers place they're signed in this
[2:54] position and it just it don't work
[2:57] haven't we seen them who in the days of
[3:00] his flesh wind offer a prayer and
[3:02] supplication with strong cries and tears
[3:03] when him was able to save him from death
[3:05] and was hurting that he feared though he
[3:07] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[3:10] the things which he suffered and being
[3:13] made perfect you said Jesus Christ
[3:15] mm-hmm I'm jumps reading what the Bible
[3:17] says not or complete he was perfect in
[3:23] himself he's got almighty but he never
[3:26] lived in a human body before like that
[3:31] which came from a baby all the way up so
[3:34] he could be our brother because remember
[3:35] he's our brother
[3:38] he felt everything we felt and being
[3:41] made perfect or complete he became the
[3:44] doctor of eternal salvation unto all
[3:47] them that obey he went to Calvary died
[3:51] that same person came back on the day of
[3:55] Pentecost in the Holy Ghost and come
[3:57] inside the believer to make you and us
[4:00] you and him eternal same people same
[4:03] person remember that's our problem we
[4:07] think there's like two three different
[4:08] eternal life that's going to one
[4:10] that's God so if you have eternal life
[4:13] you have God Amen that's right my
[4:18] question is going to be later on this
[4:20] brother Brown preach Christ is the
[4:21] mystery of God revealed right words
[4:26] cross today a second person
[4:33] oh we're little Christ steps no it's not
[4:37] when you say these that Messiah that's a
[4:39] big difference
[4:39] we do know if crisis didn't use a hope
[4:43] of glory and you got to have the mind of
[4:44] Christ in your crush will even sell this
[4:48] you better believe it or you're a second
[4:51] person that's the whole thing is we we
[4:55] say oh that's great what God did no I
[4:56] you need to put yourself except for the
[4:59] virgin birth you need to insert your
[5:01] life right into Jesus Christ life
[5:03] because we get exactly what he gets in
[5:06] man Romans 8 he said for Ayers and Dohrn
[5:09] heirs now with the Bible lied if we
[5:11] don't get everything Jesus done it okay
[5:15] let's go one step further
[5:17] he never created anything while he was
[5:19] here what you a napkin
[5:23] squirrel we've seen things come you
[5:28] think things go hmm even creators that's
[5:33] why I say it hates us so much remember
[5:36] brother Brown said God I'm that Satan
[5:39] and God are equal except for one thing
[5:43] Satan cannot create Satan has no seed to
[5:47] multiply sell because you can't create
[5:49] anything that's why he hates us because
[5:51] here he sees the little prophet walk
[5:52] here one day and say let there be a
[5:54] squirrel there one there one there one
[5:55] there that all this happened all these
[5:57] things come from nothing into something
[5:59] oil in a car brother Harris had gas come
[6:03] into his vehicle that was bringing
[6:06] something from nothing
[6:07] that's the creation you know what God
[6:15] loved me so much you just change there
[6:16] while he's in there just keeps it going
[6:20] sometimes I wish that happen but on
[6:22] before my daughter's need to have all
[6:23] changes like 40 bucks a base but he
[6:27] don't have money to do it so that's why
[6:28] God give him that excess but we have
[6:31] access to be able to go change our own a
[6:33] man gotta give you your needs not you
[6:37] won't we always would want that to
[6:40] happen but our needs are we can go
[6:41] having done that he sure could and thank
[6:44] God for that so that old truck probably
[6:46] used oil well it had to to be empty the
[6:49] mechanic told them they said if there
[6:51] was no the oil light came on that means
[6:54] the oil was dripped right it went out
[6:56] somewhere he went out somewhere right
[6:57] but the mechanic said there's no there's
[6:59] no leak anyway
[7:01] so anyway yeah now it's full you got
[7:08] four minutes okay short version we were
[7:11] Church Mandy my niece Maggie was there
[7:15] was her baby William he was like a
[7:17] toddler and he the dad jumped up and ran
[7:21] outside us into the vestibule and he I
[7:26] was in the back I jumped up and ran out
[7:28] there and that baby was dead somebody
[7:32] Casca pee and turn purple and they they
[7:35] call I don't want but he was getting
[7:37] cool and he was just stiff right and
[7:42] we'd be in to pray and he
[7:45] I believe that yes and out before killed
[7:52] a dead man in my arms before felt life
[7:54] come back in episode we are living way
[7:59] below our privilege there I think
[8:00] somebody said though in a message 50
[8:03] something years ago that we're living
[8:06] privileges all right so here we go
[8:10] called on hot bricks after the order of
[8:11] melchizedek let's get down to verse 14
[8:15] in one quick call of God in high priest
[8:17] after the order of melchizedek of whom
[8:18] we have many things to say and hard to
[8:20] be uttered seeing your dough of hearing
[8:22] now we're not done here we're good for a
[8:24] win for the time ye ought to be teachers
[8:26] you have neat one teach you again which
[8:28] be the first principles of the Oracles
[8:30] we've done and our become such as have
[8:33] need of milk and not of strong meat in
[8:35] other words you see that and I'm sorry
[8:37] you see that in the message everybody's
[8:39] wanting to go back and drink milk you
[8:41] know why cuz it's easy it's easy to pour
[8:45] some milk that's telling them the other
[8:46] day we round with that last two weeks
[8:48] but you know you pour milk in a glass
[8:50] it's really easy you can go getting a
[8:54] refrigerator pour the milk glass and
[8:56] drinking but to eat meat unless you go
[8:59] to Walmart and get it instant they had
[9:02] to kill the cow clean the cow clean the
[9:05] chicken prepare it kinda put it in the
[9:10] oven see what I mean it takes a little
[9:13] more effort be meat than it does just to
[9:14] drink milk alright so we need to put
[9:17] forth a little more effort and not love
[9:21] he said that we teach you again and I
[9:24] know we need my brother nails going back
[9:25] to salvation but it's to bring is to
[9:27] pick everybody up and bring everybody
[9:29] forward it's not for everybody we
[9:32] rejoice in that but we need to see the
[9:34] higher form of justification if we've
[9:36] already been justified we don't need to
[9:38] go back to do it again in baby form we
[9:40] need to see the next step of justice
[9:42] we've been teaching in the seal that's
[9:44] it and then now when we got into the
[9:46] highest form of justification which is
[9:48] the fifth seal the real you didn't do it
[9:50] so we got to come to that realization
[9:52] for every one that you just milk is
[9:55] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[9:57] that's why you see people babbling
[9:59] around in the message don't have a clue
[10:01] what's going on right they'll have
[10:02] included by any kind of revelation all
[10:04] they know brother ground with the
[10:05] Prophet and then will believe that what
[10:10] do you say what he said is what we got
[10:12] to get it and not verbatim quotes will
[10:19] kill you there's gonna be quotes and
[10:21] people to help but a living quote will
[10:26] never send anybody no never go to hell
[10:28] if you're living whatever those quotes
[10:29] are I'm talking like my will and for if
[10:31] you're living in a you can't go to hell
[10:33] we come back this message this message
[10:36] and the prophets message came from
[10:38] Almighty God it came from eternity from
[10:40] Indonesia
[10:40] that's what we'll talk about with the
[10:42] Seventh Seal because that's what
[10:43] happened eternity actually come right
[10:45] here that's right and told us the love
[10:49] letter but strong meat belongs to them
[10:51] that are a full age even those who by
[10:54] reason of use have their senses
[10:59] exercised to discern both good and evil
[11:06] that's the statue of a perfect man right
[11:08] thing to exercise means to open your
[11:12] Bible
[11:17] yes you had it boy I mean your babe but
[11:21] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[11:23] of full age in other words you have
[11:25] grown up the statue of a perfect man or
[11:29] that word is mature and that's exactly
[11:32] what it is listen Latour baby Christians
[11:35] are not going in a rapture right I'm
[11:38] sorry

[13:15] and away and you don't even buy from
[13:16] Newfoundland I said no he said well out
[13:21] from Newfoundland and his brother
[13:23] Newfoundland called me and told me to
[13:24] watch one of your video that's well I'm
[13:26] sorry about that
[13:27] he said really enjoyed it so man you
[13:30] never know who's you never know who's
[13:31] watching in so chapter four papers he
[13:36] was just talking about the minister I'm
[13:39] bad my ear except they don't know he
[13:41] didn't mean somebody
[13:44] I knew that this brother ate a piece
[13:48] from beautiful and he has there's
[13:49] another brother then some massive Church
[13:51] over there in this one that everyone
[13:52] must watch us I don't know so anyway let
[13:56] us therefore fear lest a promise being
[13:58] left us of inter endurance rest any of
[14:00] you should seem to come short of them
[14:02] now remember the promise was not of that
[14:07] day but when we're born again we enter
[14:10] into the rest of God all right and we
[14:12] rest we should be still rest in your
[14:15] soul as resting the parent is just a
[14:17] rest of the rest of you that's got fight
[14:20] crying to us was the gospel preached as
[14:23] well as unto them but the word preached
[14:25] did not profit them what's he talking
[14:28] about he's talking about going back to
[14:29] Israel and Israel says Sabbath day
[14:31] seventh day that's the day we're gonna
[14:34] rest and that's gonna be it the seventh
[14:36] day tell me something yes when you see a
[14:40] little red dot
[14:41] kill the red dot it's on okay okay let's
[14:45] try again okay all right take the bus
[14:49] and the driving us we're on to us the
[14:53] gospel preachers well until then maybe
[14:54] somebody's talking about Israel that
[14:56] takes a day it'll take some day and says
[15:00] like our seventh-day Adventists I mean
[15:02] you talked to several day Adventists if
[15:03] you go to church on Sunday that's the
[15:05] anti-crime right I mean Alan you'll see
[15:08] it on the billboard do you want to learn
[15:10] about the Antichrist come and kind of
[15:12] look talk to us then with day Adventist
[15:13] because if you celebrate of course we
[15:17] don't celebrate of Sabbath this is not a
[15:20] Sabbath this is Sunday this is the day
[15:24] the resurrection happen the first day of
[15:26] the week so we really don't celebrate as
[15:29] there was not a Sabbath except for them
[15:32] which Sabbath means survival you take a
[15:37] sabbatical you take a one-day sabbatical
[15:39] that you let everything rafting you I
[15:41] mean you let your six days a restaurant
[15:43] seven just like Christ did I mean
[15:46] when you said that I had this guy come
[15:50] through my air conditioning in well then
[15:53] he started talking about the changes and
[15:55] all that and the state blossom you are
[15:57] interested when we're not you know that
[15:58] kind of thing I'm telling you they're
[16:11] hard light on that that's their that's
[16:13] their doctrine is that everyone else
[16:17] it's Antichrist if you celebrate your
[16:20] Sabbath but I told my said it's not
[16:23] Sonny's not Sabbath to me there's not a
[16:26] day of rest
[16:27] sure yeah one day ain't no more now you
[16:29] used to be right I can remember not
[16:33] almost you can too but there was nothing
[16:35] open on Sunday nothing except maybe a
[16:38] few restaurants and maybe some even
[16:40] grocery stores all right but but other
[16:43] than that you got your you filled your
[16:45] vehicle up on Saturday night this mate
[16:47] and you got your sandwiches and you
[16:49] bought your stuff and y'all did the
[16:51] cooking and we didn't go out me and we
[16:53] went home because there wasn't none over
[16:54] right they call it the blue law that's
[17:00] correct right so all right so here we
[17:04] here we are now that God rested the
[17:08] seventh day and now remember you got to
[17:12] be real about this god never rested he
[17:15] wasn't tired he was just taking a
[17:18] interval of time to lay everything
[17:21] develop so he already knew what was
[17:24] going on in his mind he just need to let
[17:26] it develop here he needed to let this to
[17:29] develop and that's what's doing now
[17:30] we're developing into a vision we're
[17:32] gonna get in that with a Seventh Seal
[17:33] maybe in a few more leads about being in
[17:36] division because remember this is all
[17:38] not so we were talking last night about
[17:41] the dimensions and it's just why I feel
[17:44] that
[17:47] Adam and Eve were in a complete rest in
[17:50] the garden before the fall they were
[17:53] they were both eternal and souls they
[17:55] think just one about their day no pain
[17:56] no sorrow no heartache they they would
[17:59] if they wanted to tell my soul they
[18:00] could if they didn't they didn't have to
[18:02] they they just did things cuz they were
[18:04] happy and because they wanted to but
[18:06] wants to Paul happen what happened in
[18:09] that is there was no dimension I don't
[18:10] believe it was any dimension not even
[18:12] talked about last night about angels
[18:13] I believe Adam could see all the angles
[18:18] Adam was not limited I was a son of God
[18:24] he wanted to control this whole earth
[18:25] now this whole earth is pretty big if
[18:28] one man standing hearing what's going on
[18:30] under the bottom of the earth so I
[18:32] believe he just moved away anyway with
[18:34] not just what I believe about that you
[18:37] said while he was in a flesh body so
[18:39] it's to you
[18:40] and he walked through walls and
[18:42] everything else oh no the glorified but
[18:44] you understand what I'm saying before
[18:45] the fall there was no there was no
[18:47] dimensional limitation but as they were
[18:49] going out of that Garden of Eden
[18:51] remember brother I said they got out and
[18:52] they couldn't get back in listen the
[18:56] Garden of Eden is not in this dimension
[18:58] that's right this is Satan Z this is why
[19:03] it's like matter is what we're stuck in
[19:06] because that's matter and our life stays
[19:09] in this dimension until we pass this
[19:11] thing passes the way of they goes over
[19:13] into another dimension that's the oldest
[19:14] in this dimension so I just believe
[19:16] that's when God set the dimensions or
[19:18] separated he said I'll put enmity in
[19:20] which he means division so he putting
[19:23] the enmity between God and man so God
[19:25] can't talk to man like he did with Adam
[19:27] but now he's going to he's going to talk
[19:29] face-to-face back just like he did me or
[19:32] do but there's dimensional changes come
[19:34] leaving brother branham in linen in the
[19:36] sixth dimension and said I wanted to see
[19:38] Jesus and the angel said he's a little
[19:40] higher what he's in the seventh
[19:42] dimension he's already got a glorified
[19:44] body he's standing in a place that no
[19:46] one's ever stood before no one's ever
[19:48] had any mortality but one man he said
[19:51] what about inna I'm not just going to
[19:53] tell you what the Bible said the Bible
[19:55] says no one had reached him
[19:57] calavius F Jesus Christ all right which
[19:59] means he was mortal now he is immortal
[20:02] whatever happened to all them other
[20:03] people that disappeared
[20:04] Elijah who died just say he not them
[20:10] then you know whatever happened to them
[20:12] that has no it has a type to me but it
[20:15] has I'm not gonna delve in and try to
[20:16] figure out what happened I'm just gonna
[20:18] tell you what the Bible said Bible says
[20:20] only one man has reached immortality
[20:21] there's only one empty tomb which means
[20:23] someone died come back to life and has
[20:26] not went back into Tim again because
[20:27] many people been resurrected and they're
[20:30] back in the tomb Lazarus isn't maybe the
[20:32] baby language didn't go back in the same
[20:34] tomb that he got resurrected out of it
[20:35] but he went back into a tomb one day
[20:37] because he got a hold knife right all
[20:39] right now Jesus Christ didn't he didn't
[20:40] get old and died he died for us and it
[20:43] came back horrified that Bobby had
[20:45] stepped over into another dimension
[20:46] that's why he can't come back into this
[20:48] dimension but he send the whole sent the
[20:51] Holy Ghost into this dimension to work
[20:53] through you and I that's what we were
[20:55] talking about last night with with
[20:56] angels there are angels ministering
[20:59] spirits that help us did help us do
[21:02] things and you know keeps us safe yes
[21:07] Saint would look kill all in one stack
[21:11] if he'd love to destroy the whole
[21:13] Briarcliff you know that's the last
[21:14] thing he's got to get right so then we
[21:16] now have the angels of God around us if
[21:21] we could see them under an open eyes
[21:22] they'd be like a haze and Elijah
[21:25] pirogues I didn't see the two people
[21:27] standing there him and Elijah and this
[21:29] whole Syrian army and Elijah hood like
[21:32] there's more four of us they are Liam
[21:34] and he said one to ten thousand one but
[21:40] when he opened his eyes they what the
[21:42] angels had to come they were already
[21:43] there the angels were already there so
[21:46] the Angels now are in camp come out of
[21:48] the angels and camped about us that love
[21:51] the Lord cuz watch a friend to us was
[21:55] the gospel preached as low as to them so
[21:57] to Israel the gospel was preached but
[21:59] the word preached did not profit them
[22:01] not being mixed with faith in them the
[22:04] hurting so what it was the people heard
[22:05] and said Oh bless you did think but I'm
[22:07] going by
[22:08] to my Sabbath day the Torah the besides
[22:11] not come yet
[22:12] that's what Paul had to deal with point
[22:15] a deal with a group of people that
[22:17] thought the Messiah was coming
[22:19] and Paul's trying to tell them he's
[22:20] already come he died rose again ascended
[22:25] now he's come back inside of us but we
[22:29] mix it with faith and believe that
[22:31] that's what happened they didn't mix it
[22:33] with faith they be in the old Orthodox
[22:37] Jew but you know what
[22:39] they're going to get faith through two
[22:40] prophets and they're going to get the
[22:44] 144,000 call them out and give them to
[22:47] their rest all right for we which have
[22:50] believed do enter into rest once you
[22:54] believe once you're born again you enter
[22:55] into a rest your soul is done it's
[22:57] finished it's not it's not one of them
[23:00] in mouth things you're as we were
[23:04] talking about last night if you have a
[23:05] definite experience you only if you
[23:08] don't then you didn't that's just the
[23:11] way that when we teach here as much of
[23:14] justification st. you catch the baptism
[23:16] Holy Ghost
[23:16] if you don't know what three then three
[23:18] steps are you've been asleep for about
[23:20] 25 or 30 years a man man we know in this
[23:25] church that we believe in three definite
[23:27] acts of grace and I can take you to all
[23:32] three of mine just and pity right in the
[23:33] Bible you should be able to do the same
[23:35] thing naturally mm-hmm if you had this
[23:38] star at their starting point you know
[23:40] you know like the guy laid me down to
[23:43] sleep you know regular my soul to keep
[23:45] me because soldiers dying priesthood
[23:47] where'd you lose him at where do you
[23:49] love where you lost him free me to find
[23:50] him and he said well now I lay me down
[23:52] to sleep in other words he left him in
[23:54] the cradle Reed's mama saying now I lay
[23:57] me down to sleep so and you know what he
[23:59] went back to that place that's not hard
[24:02] it's not bad being ignorant
[24:05] because ignorant goes into stupid when
[24:09] you when you continue on in that
[24:11] ignorant continuous it's not bad but you
[24:14] stay in ignorance and that's what the
[24:17] it'll did they shut their mind off and
[24:20] stayed in ignorance that the Messiah had
[24:21] come because man they was that was Peter
[24:25] not look think about all the people that
[24:27] were preaching in Jerusalem and
[24:28] preaching him preaching that the Messiah
[24:30] had come and now he's back into them by
[24:32] the new birth and then won't strong
[24:34] snoozer like he didn't come to other
[24:39] well they were telling the truth he
[24:41] didn't come to them first now he didn't
[24:43] come to his own but his own received him
[24:44] not
[24:45] so he goes context of Gentile bride but
[24:47] he's going to go back to them according
[24:49] to the sixth seal because I'm going to
[24:52] feel like pull out 144,000 for we which
[24:55] have believed do enter into rest as he
[24:57] said as I have sworn in my wrath if they
[25:00] shall enter into my rest although the
[25:02] works were finished from the foundation
[25:03] of the world if I got that because what
[25:08] happened is we were talking about this
[25:09] last night when you see brother Brown
[25:13] make statements when you see God in the
[25:15] Bible make statements you got to
[25:17] remember one thing in the mind of God
[25:20] everybody that born-again now he already
[25:24] knew that
[25:24] right but we did we did so if we ever
[25:31] was this seed from the beginning is that
[25:33] Steve that came to you the new birth
[25:34] that birthed you into the back to where
[25:38] you realize that you were in the mind of
[25:39] God and it comes to you have to be
[25:41] careful because it's a fine line to left
[25:43] all right
[25:44] but the fine line is go back to
[25:46] justification saying why do you need
[25:48] them three works of grace if you always
[25:49] love you terminal why do you need to
[25:52] education why brother ground preach
[25:54] justification ain't catching bouncing ho
[25:55] goes all the way up to the future home
[25:57] he creeps them that that's three
[26:00] definite works of grace but most people
[26:02] unless you just say well I was born with
[26:03] this seed in me and I believe the
[26:05] message and
[26:06] decided well that might get you good for
[26:09] this burger but not mr. ching-kuo like
[26:13] that is that not Nestor geelong you
[26:14] can't hide behind that so they're really
[26:18] the works were finished before the
[26:19] foundation well your name was written in
[26:21] the book for the foundation where we
[26:22] were talking about Jesus's name being
[26:23] put into London weren't they about uses
[26:25] name put in taking out and all that but
[26:27] listen that's just that's an allegory
[26:30] there's not an angel sitting up there
[26:32] that's right and Jesus's name in the
[26:34] book and then another angel go that says
[26:36] hi he's not wearing helmet or it's just
[26:39] an allegory to tell you that you can
[26:41] come to a certain place Judas came to a
[26:44] place of sanctification and his name in
[26:47] the book of life in the book of life but
[26:49] not though not the section of the
[26:51] eternal devel K because you can do that
[26:55] because brother Brown says you come to
[26:57] sanctification your name goes on the
[26:59] book as a believable mountain but then
[27:01] you get sanctified there's not somebody
[27:03] up there to write your name remember
[27:05] this like we were coming that was stages
[27:08] in a play like we were talking about the
[27:13] interval you know there's an interval
[27:14] between each play that between each set
[27:18] there's different sets and then you have
[27:20] to take that set off and put a new one
[27:21] on then the actors could portray well
[27:24] that's the same we've been happened
[27:25] there's seven acts of a play first act
[27:29] of the play was called when Iranians
[27:30] from Martin Luther Coleman then now
[27:32] we've got this this ending of the play
[27:35] everything ending up in this church a
[27:39] although the works were finished from
[27:40] the foundation of the world remember
[27:42] somebody asked brother round one times
[27:44] by the remnant if God knows all this and
[27:45] everything's already done in co2 why are
[27:47] you preaching remember remember he said
[27:50] he said hey I gotta throw the net he
[27:52] said I don't know who saved us who's not
[27:54] God does but I gotta throw the net I've
[27:56] got to do the work so sorry but listen
[28:00] if if Jesus were slain before the
[28:01] foundation of the world in the mind of
[28:03] God why'd he have to come down here
[28:06] he had come down here to portray our act
[28:09] brother Graham said the part of that
[28:11] because remember he didn't die
[28:12] Christians don't die God didn't die the
[28:14] dying them can't die Jesus
[28:16] didn't die his body died because his
[28:20] soul went out somewhere and come back
[28:22] alright so he acted the part of death
[28:25] that's the same way with a Christian
[28:27] they're just acting toward death
[28:28] that's why Jesus always said they're
[28:29] sleeping the sleep in earth they just
[28:34] couldn't understand anything he was
[28:35] telling them they were just the body's
[28:37] asleep and then they're over in another
[28:38] dimension like we're gonna talk about
[28:41] maybe a little bit this afternoon where
[28:45] Jesus said it is finished on the cross
[28:46] well now it was finished in this
[28:49] dimension
[28:50] it went finished in another dimension
[28:52] cuz he didn't just stay there the whole
[28:54] town no he went straight to hell free he
[28:57] was preaching the whole time he had a
[28:58] job to do he was still doing a job while
[29:00] even though he said it's finished cuz
[29:05] remember the seven seals silence nothing
[29:09] going on brother I'm saying but now that
[29:12] doesn't mean nothing's going on
[29:14] Jesus looked pretty dead like nothing
[29:16] going on if you were able to look in the
[29:18] tomb but that wasn't there was a lot
[29:20] going on while he was in his silent time
[29:22] [Music]
[29:25] maybe we're going to review the sales
[29:28] and then with a little bit we'll talk
[29:29] about it before he spoke at a certain
[29:33] place of the seventh day on this life
[29:34] and God did rest the seventh day from
[29:36] all his work now remember truth like I
[29:38] said before that's an allegory that's
[29:40] that showing that God what he was
[29:43] finished doing he's creating at that
[29:44] time and he was resting he had stopped
[29:47] collect things developed all right same
[29:51] thing with the six six seals finishes
[29:53] Redemption that's one there's an
[29:54] interval because they stopped and let
[29:56] everybody come in it elects everybody
[29:59] come in so that revelation is five God
[30:01] can take the earth the lamb can take the
[30:03] book there's an interval in there that
[30:06] brother Brown said God was behind the
[30:08] throne or in the church age is doing his
[30:10] immediate or work or his work of
[30:12] redemption and he's still doing it
[30:14] because there's people we love that are
[30:16] not warning in so listen the
[30:19] she seeks still there that's right but
[30:23] now the mercy seat for you Dover if
[30:25] you're mourning it you have no mercy you
[30:28] are the mercy seat when you get morning
[30:29] you know you know I'll go to the mercy
[30:31] say you are the mercy no oh no no doubt
[30:41] yes but that was our sacrifice remember
[30:45] when I was at 53 it says he gave his
[30:47] soul the ransom the soul is what saved
[30:50] you not his body but his body was
[30:52] hanging on the cross for your stripes
[30:55] and my stripes and for your healing in
[30:57] my healing Jesus didn't need a healing
[30:59] in his soul he was the healing so but
[31:04] but you need healing in your body so and
[31:06] when we see that Christ died on the
[31:09] cross and took hold of what he took man
[31:10] nobody could go through that's why he
[31:13] was in complete control even the darkest
[31:15] hour every was that we think about Jesus
[31:17] cross was in control because when he
[31:18] said it's finished he's the one that
[31:20] said it's finished
[31:22] then Roman people didn't say he was
[31:23] finished nobody on earth said it's
[31:25] finished Jesus said it is finished into
[31:28] my hands I commend my spirit even in
[31:30] total control the whole time yeah look
[31:33] like he was in total chaos but he was in
[31:35] complete control
[31:36] alright for a spanking in certain places
[31:39] the sympathy on this was and God did
[31:40] raise the seventh day from all his work
[31:42] and in this place again if they shall
[31:44] enter into my rest in other words
[31:46] another rest coming but the rest is
[31:48] coming on the Sabbath day it's the rest
[31:49] that you and I come to in our soul like
[31:53] I'm staying last night we got a steam
[31:54] down as far up the road as we are we've
[31:57] got to realize that you're born again or
[31:59] not boring in one of the time you've got
[32:00] a real light you got enough it's not got
[32:02] a beam I hope I hope I got the church
[32:07] today
[32:07] well that hope is done I'm here so you
[32:12] got to realize you're here once you
[32:13] realize you have arrived
[32:15] then there's your rest now the problem
[32:20] we have is the memory reason constant
[32:21] space
[32:22] I'm talking about no rest your memory
[32:24] yes your reasoning concert specs and
[32:27] imagination all that does arrest because
[32:29] that's the human part that God is trying
[32:31] to come from the inside out and Satan's
[32:34] going from the outside trying to get by
[32:36] hand so there's your Bible you can't you
[32:40] can't battle in your soul if you're born
[32:42] again there is no level there is no
[32:46] battle in your soul be born again the
[32:48] black dog white dog that the old Indian
[32:49] said was is when he got born again with
[32:51] the white dog with the black dog was
[32:53] that old nature still whirling around
[32:54] inside
[32:55] in that spirit realm you know going
[32:56] around and around he said which will not
[32:58] fade the most hey cuz until you're born
[33:02] again you're not black dog white dog
[33:03] you're blind up your one dog
[33:06] right but when you get born again that
[33:08] moves that black dog out to the middle
[33:10] realm puts the white dog in the center
[33:12] realm and then it just you know there's
[33:14] whacking on each other all the time and
[33:17] it displace against that you see
[33:19] therefore it remaineth that some must
[33:22] enter therein and they to whom it was
[33:24] first preached entered not in because of
[33:26] unbelief just like what we were talking
[33:28] about they did not believe that Christ
[33:30] had already come they're still looking
[33:31] at a Sabbath day that Christ is gonna
[33:35] cut the Messiah is going to come on a
[33:37] certain time again he limited a certain
[33:43] day Santa David today after so long the
[33:46] time it is said today if you will hear
[33:47] my voice harden not your hearts for if
[33:51] Jesus had given them rest and then
[33:53] twenty not half would have spoken over
[33:54] then in other words Jesus when he came
[33:56] he never said all right now he did honor
[33:59] the Sabbath let me taste that he did
[34:01] honor the Sabbath okay but it wasn't a
[34:06] Sabbath like they were talking about
[34:07] Samuel he was in the temple all the time
[34:10] doing things but remember he never spoke
[34:12] of a certain day
[34:13] he said come to me you let him labor and
[34:16] heavy-laden and I'll give you not a day
[34:18] I'll give you a rest that's what he's
[34:21] saying right here he would have spoke of
[34:22] another day if it would have been
[34:24] another 24-hour day they
[34:26] but didn't there remaineth therefore a
[34:29] rest to the people of God which is us
[34:32] for he that has entered into his rest he
[34:34] also has ceased this from its own words
[34:37] thereby get it because you're not judged
[34:42] by your works if you're mourning in your
[34:46] works is now his work you ceased from
[34:48] his own works but we cease from our own
[34:51] work as did God from his alright because
[34:56] remember in Revelations when you come to
[34:59] the white throne judgment you're judged
[35:00] by your works it will be your news and
[35:02] don't a list you did this you didn't do
[35:06] that you did this you didn't do that now
[35:09] if you're standing in judgment you're
[35:13] not judged you already judged we're dead
[35:15] so now this is the end this is the only
[35:16] judgment we'll go through I'll have to
[35:18] write let us labor therefore to enter
[35:23] into that rest no words you're born
[35:25] again lest any man fall after the same
[35:27] example of unbelief little words those
[35:30] people believe so much and that Sabbath
[35:32] to remember and now even listen even
[35:35] they set that day in the Old Testament
[35:37] and remember the guy went out and picked
[35:38] up sticks he picked up sticks on the
[35:41] Sabbath and they stoned him and killed
[35:43] me because God told him to do it because
[35:44] that was part of what the Old Testament
[35:46] was was days and times and rituals and
[35:51] seasons but when Christ come they don't
[35:53] do that no more that's right
[35:55] that's why Jesus would you know Walter
[35:57] neat corner on the Sabbath or you go do
[35:59] this on the Sabbath he's not calling
[36:04] people we can't talk about labor and
[36:08] physical labor you know lest any man
[36:11] fall after the same example unbelief for
[36:14] the work of God is quick and powerful
[36:15] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[36:18] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[36:21] soul spirit joint mouth so there's soul
[36:24] dust of area the next round and watch
[36:28] this outside rim that's your joy
[36:30] America's you don't have doing Maryland
[36:31] you saw it this time right
[36:34] European theophany right and is a
[36:37] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[36:39] the heart
[36:39] right that's what God give us if we have
[36:43] the word it divides us under and thank
[36:47] God for a prophet that that just grew a
[36:49] little a little simple example of three
[36:51] little like a bold life sent around sold
[36:55] out around the spirit and next realms
[36:57] see take spills melon here I mean hear
[36:58] me but you know why he did it because of
[37:00] the work because of the word he brought
[37:02] that's what he brought to us now we can
[37:05] look back to that now how many times the
[37:07] people read that my brother Dale from
[37:09] that last night how many how many people
[37:11] outside of the message realm if you were
[37:15] to go over and say hey let me tell you
[37:16] about justification st. kicking back
[37:19] then ago most people in denomination
[37:22] will have no clue what you're growing
[37:24] them this way but yet is something of us
[37:26] that's just is settled in our heart and
[37:28] it's exactly because of the what the
[37:30] word exactly because of the word coming
[37:33] to us cutting away all that junk and
[37:37] showing us faith or doubt memory reason
[37:41] constant affection imagination and seat
[37:44] a smell smell in here that's what we see
[37:46] so we see ourselves there and the worst
[37:51] of discerner folks not one man it's the
[37:54] words the discerner of the thoughts and
[37:56] intents of the hearts right all right
[37:58] neither is there any creature that is
[38:01] not manifest in this sight but all
[38:02] things are naked and open to the eyes of
[38:04] him whom we have to do in other words
[38:06] nothing is hidden from God we know that
[38:08] seeing them that we have a great high
[38:10] priest that is passed into the heavens
[38:13] what he's in another dimension Jesus the
[38:17] Son of God let us hold fast our
[38:19] profession for we have not an High
[38:21] Priest which cannot be touched with the
[38:23] feelings of our infirmities but was in
[38:25] all points tempted like as we are yet
[38:27] without sin why because his memories and
[38:30] conscience patient imagination
[38:32] that's not from a fallen nature even
[38:36] though now you're born again your
[38:38] memories and constant spatial
[38:39] imagination has they fallen nature park
[38:42] to it right it has a human part to it
[38:44] everybody got that right that's actually
[38:48] is your human part your body just holds
[38:50] all this stuff together like I said
[38:52] before you know this just in case is
[38:54] what's inside this just keeps you from
[38:56] falling apart all right so so God don't
[38:59] deal with the flesh he'll tell you many
[39:00] times he said I'm not dealing with a
[39:01] play-doh only at the inside yeah that's
[39:04] why Nicodemus said do I have to go back
[39:06] and get in my mother's womb flat you
[39:09] know Jesus said not only you know you
[39:13] got to be born from above you can't be
[39:14] born from you're not anymore for mom and
[39:16] daddy that was your problem that could
[39:17] be with you or bringing up and your dad
[39:20] all right but he's still working on us
[39:25] because that's what the statute perfect
[39:26] man does it brings the nature of Christ
[39:30] into us and don't have a handle things
[39:32] just like he handled all right cuz he
[39:35] walked through the world a human being
[39:36] that was the whole mystery was is that
[39:40] they didn't realize he was God because
[39:42] he was so human he cried he laughed you
[39:46] had to eat him to the bathroom he did
[39:49] probably have a lot of heartaches that
[39:51] we don't know anything about because of
[39:53] the weight of the world was on him but
[39:56] they were saying all you man make
[39:59] yourself done well that's what he's
[40:01] that's what we're saying in the end time
[40:03] that God has made us into God and then
[40:07] you see all these people ran instead
[40:08] ain't perfect you ain't perfect you God
[40:10] you think you're God no I don't think
[40:13] I'm glad I know I'm God if I got to do
[40:14] birds I'm not saying personal Trinity
[40:16] right let us therefore come boldly into
[40:20] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[40:22] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[40:25] need which is just our normal natural
[40:27] everyday life
[40:31] or you know I got plenty of time it's
[40:35] 4:30 in the morning we got a I'm
[40:39] about I put a human you know putting
[40:41] your battery in there 13 yeah I got it
[40:44] right here got my phone all right for
[40:49] every high priest taken from among men
[40:51] is ordained from men and things
[40:53] pertaining to God now he's talking about
[40:55] us that he may offer both gifts and
[40:59] sacrifices for sin who can have
[41:02] compassion on the ignorant and on them
[41:05] that are out of the way colonel over
[41:07] dinosaurs are not in the way for that he
[41:10] himself also is compassed with infirmity
[41:13] and by reason thereof he ought as for
[41:18] the people so also for himself to offer
[41:21] for since we talk about priests and no
[41:23] man taketh dishonor into himself but he
[41:26] that is called of God as was there in
[41:28] other words Aaron was the only one to go
[41:31] back into the Holy of Holies they went
[41:33] 15 doing a lot of confusion in other
[41:36] words you don't have four pastors in
[41:38] this church we have one one pastor right
[41:41] same way with Aaron we had 100 okay he
[41:44] was a high priest and he wasn't one who
[41:45] did the business and not somebody else
[41:50] so also Christ glorified not himself to
[41:54] be made in high priest but he that said
[41:56] unto Him thou art my son then I have
[41:59] today I have begotten thee wasto not
[42:03] come at the father which is the same
[42:05] person but it's a manifestation Christ
[42:07] never glorified himself he never said
[42:09] look at me of course he said I am the
[42:11] way the truth and the life all that but
[42:12] he always said the father whatever the
[42:14] father says well there's a lot of things
[42:17] all right but he that sent him there are
[42:20] my son today have I begun
