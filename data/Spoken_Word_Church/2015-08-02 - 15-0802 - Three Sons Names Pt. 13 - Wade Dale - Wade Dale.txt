TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you your job um it was too interesting it'll close up do we need to rewind now you're by far over not restart that anointing brother well yes big everything yet so I watched son of man stand upon a fee and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered me i have got it the spirit entered me to watch but now watch this let's go to the Ezekiel three more over said to me son of man eat that now fight now what is this this is God speaking alright but now watch he's he kill 26 look at 26 and thou oh man he's talking specifically right there to Ezekiel yeah you got it little s yeah that's you and I the big s 0 n is Almighty God he's fixing to speak himself sure he's got to speaking to Ezekiel but right here he's saying and thou son of man be not afraid of them he'll look this son of man I ain't afraid of it paints the word this son of man isn't afraid of it but this son of man down here is what the one that was born from his ego his mom and dad you got that so you and I are sons and daughters of God right but we are a son of Matt we're all sons of men in flesh but we're son of a man and we're in flesh but now the son of man was God inhabiting this flesh not having to come in as my people didn't think so much about the River Jordan doctrine but the River Jordan doctrine actually separated the tube and made him just a little s uh-huh jesus never was a little is he was the son of man so what is decent man God in human flesh even as a baby he didn't need and the person he was Jesus Christ didn't need Redemption he came down here took on our sin to make us redeemable the man do you just blow money God get it near he got near Seoul cleaning out he didn't need his spirit cleaned out right but he didn't need a body change that's what we're working to he didn't need a body chain so the Son of Man is complete God but it's complete gone in a human mortal body alright same way with Ezekiel but now watch what he says here let's go back this the second what was the Ezekiel set to do Ezekiel was said to prophesy to Israel to tell Israel you have rejected me but I'm coming I'm coming as the son of man on earth to redeem Israel may you read all the Zika because remember Ezekiel 43 44 is the restoration of the Millennial temple so I think you'll really takes us right through into the Millennium so is he kill had to be not the Son of man but a son of man that capital son of man is going to speed through the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and send me upon my feet that I heard him then I heard them to spoken to me and he said to me son of man I send thee to the children of Israel now who'd east and the children of Israel the son of man with children of Israel Jesus Christ Ezekiel couldn't save Israel that's why he was little ass right down there number six be not afraid of them they would be afraid of the words in other words what's he doing he's talking to the human man Ezekiel because listen remember they're just remember brother random would even when brought when God would speak to brother enemy he would question it is that you lord he's at you why he was a little songd ever did one day get up and go today did that man some my l know it was him that was the man you know I said ever seen me and him sure Jesus could receive thought like we did but he never questioned how many times a week listen how many times do we say was the Lord had told us to do something we did it it was just a complete failure I believe or I think I have this feeling that the Lord wants men do this and it's to go get all them you know people move off over in this direction and the Lord sent me up there well he ain't send you up here to starve to death didn't send you a pleasure to get involved doctrine you know what like these people that say well the Lord gave me this job but I got work on Sundays the Lord never give you a job work on Sunday you took a job that you needed to work on sunday you took yes that's just laugh-in so so what end so but jesus never I don't think Jesus ever walked up and went well should I knew that person or not I hear this voice telling me that no he was so in tune with the father he was the father made manifest in this flesh plane was decent man I swine and said I said to you jesus never said to us after work Ezekiel had to say thus said the Lord God is he too had to say that the mouthpiece of God had to say that until God Himself came in human flesh yeah Jesus was not only the mouthpiece of God he was gone to man seq was a mouthpiece of God that God used that vessel entered into that vessel spoke to who Israel the son of man cuz who's the one that condemned Israel when he was on earth the son of man he was always condemned he said o Israel if I if you you know i would have gathered you up as a in what I mean he only went to Israel so he went to Israel first though in a form of Ezekiel but that wasn't be some and that was a son of man with the son of man being in tight ship here to talk some man stand up on my feet to me when I started reading the zekiel after that I saw Jesus standing there because watch in Ezekiel one watch this right here memory had a vision right you had a vision of what the likeness of four creatures and the verse 5 and these was their appearance now remember we look at it and go live ops man and eagle right members lot and brother hamza within the box at liveops man mingle right that's the poor that's what he's talking about but what and these was their appearance they had the likeness of men so with a man hope now you wonder why I do what a while I'm walking out there he'll just beer God in the characterization of a lion the lion anointing flying LOL men that went what in a man in men God's always work through man he's never work to animals sure why he spoke to one with Balaam but he never used an animal for redemption except in the Old Testament that's what we're going to get into when we see what happened when Jesus said in Matthew 9 he talks about the Son of Man able to forgive sins and then if you say something against the Holy go why what seen this many right here what and everyone had four faces and for win now this is your for beef because look at verse 10 as for the lights our faces day for had the face of a man face of a lion face of an office face of an eagle but it was the appearance of a man Ezekiel saw a man standing everybody saw these spirits not spirits and evil spirits as the spirits of God characterizing their self as a line and brother branham explain that thank God for profit that would explain them the bolus of the line the sacrifice of the odds for the pulley and the eagle and demand okay but they all were characterized in one person right there verse 5 who what is that that was son of man Jesus Christ had all four of those combat beast because when it brother Brown take say that the combat beast was the only go the man so this man was the Holy go okay so what you say well it's characters I was characterizing the bride down to the church ages that's right but go to revelations where daddy's been reading her six months one lock into the Son of Man while all that was envelope right there in those seven sure changes in that Sun man characterization you don't say I want to because it was the characterization because because remember the son of man down through seven church ages was the true revelation was lost right the son of man started but writing the first church AZ said you lost your first love but what they lose they lost the revelation the son of man to me call the son of magnus the one who loves you God sure God loves you but this man right here said he I don't give my lap I love you so much I'm or die I don't have to I stay this man right here and just be just but you can't say he can't stay this man and how the characterization that he had the father healer redeemer saber they had to come out into this man right here alright son of man don't mate okay with that alright so here's his ETO talking but watch in first trying to get mold Bible out until they got all this stuff underline talks about their faces nice don't like the living creatures now we know the living creatures were lineups men illegal but they all were characterized Ezekiel turn look-sees man John turns to see the bride sees a man huh John turn see the bride you see there you know in that picture of the cloud anybody see the eagle wings oh yeah okay yep that's should have all been able to see that maybe we'll get a picture one day little shortening the ice on that back on the first and the sixties when we first started thing when you see that cloud manages to me it visualizes everything how they do away with it if they want to but I think was very important that's true so important that i don't think the seal going to open had it not been that labor of that come biblical fanfare jesus said the two angles said the way you see this man leave is the way you won't see him come and it within a cloud same way he went up the same way you come back down right in a cloud and probably if the two if the people would have a revelation they look so Jesus going up I believe you my seen the same formation of that cloud as he went up through the middle of it because he's the one that he's you wanted to get over those seals brother brendan o'neill Jesus eyes open sea alright alright so now watch this stuff so they got to get my old bottle here if I can read it with no 24 a watch verse 24 and when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of Greg waters what is water people has the voice of the all money not a different voice as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of a hoax remember when join when john turned to see the boy SAT spoke to him he thought he was going to turn and see Jesus himself right because he remembered that boys from being on earth because remember Jesus boys didn't change samples so when you turn to see the boys the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of a mini not one when they stood they let down the wing so there was a voice from the firmament what is that cloud that was over their heads when they stood in let down the wings and above the firmament over the head was the lights of a throne hold on a minute as he parents of a semi was going upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man that's him that's man sitting on throne today and I saw as the color of amber parents of fire round about within from the appearance of his loins up and from the parents of his loins down and I salt with the parents of fire and he had brought this round about his appearance of the bow that is in the cloud of the day of rain want rainbow so was the appearance of the bride is right about that's revelation that's right that's revelations 4 5 10 all of it revelation 1 okay this was the appearance of the lightness of the glory of the Lord am I so I fell on my face and heard a voice of Wonders face and what's he going to do you watch this and watch it in verse 2 and 3 we're not going to go do it all because this is I just want to give you a little example because he said what so I'm asking on your feet back over here son of man I send thee to the children of the air filter a rebellious nice and verse 3 all right now Hoodie sent Jesus to same place right all right since the son of man this is the Son of Man going to the house of Israel verse 6 Ezekiel don't be afraid of them ok Ezekiel not the big son of man Ezekiel need to be afraid of their words listen the son of man wasn't afraid this person right here even in human flesh was not afraid of anything did he ever say I fear this er I fear that or I don't want to go here I don't want to go back he said fear not I and with you that was the problem with that first thing I said I'm afraid well he never been afraid before why he had that enmity ending them need to be afraid of the words in other words what the snot what what God's telling is equal is look don't be afraid of these people i'm with you i'm going to do the speaking because look verse 7 and thou shalt speak my words joisey kill is not going to go up there for centuries and just start talking I don't think brother branham come and just talk presumptuously he spoke the words of these automatic m.a.a.d words of these out of man ok and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they were here are whether they will forbear for there are most rebellious but now son of man is he you'll hear what i say unto thee right look what happened first verse 9 and when I look behold a handle ascend unto me and a little role of a book was there in for that book come from we're that revelation 10 by eight come from and he spread it before me and it was written with in and out revelations 5 and there was written lamentations morning and low he's not finished more obese enemy son of man heat heat the book gone eat the books out of my son of man eat that belt I just eat this rolling go speak until the house of Israel so I open my mouth and he calls me to eat grow now look Ezekiel was not morning in right he was an anointed prophet run look what that word says he caused me to eat the rope now when you go over to John a born-again believer John goes over and he says gives me the book to the Denver in the Old Testament he had to be giving something to eat he had no words yet of course on the table but John being born again Christian he knew he needed that book so John if you'll revel in some ten John says give me the book and the angel says take it he's kidding okay it's mine in other words what it was a possession John had the new birth for 60 something years he knew that was a possession Ezekiel is not understanding everything that's going on you understand what I'm saying them telling prophets in the Old Testament sometimes did not understand what they were doing because they were born again they didn't have something inside of them to click on what they were saying they were literally just a mouse people God but now they'll be given eternal life yourself you know they're not something to throw away all right but they were not even in your situation not as great as you the least in the kingdom is greater than John and John was the greatest of the prophets yeah hello one more time jesus said that's what the man said the big ass told us one day he said the least in the kingdom what about to the home the police in the kingdom is greater than John and John was the greatest of all prophets hey man what he said so that's why all these prophets are prophesying and God would open up something for them to see like I believe as eco saw Jesus Christ when he saw all the way to mill the wheel and all that coming down with the four creatures had two pairs of man he went look at it Joe you know John Henry he was looking at Jesus right but Jesus was not manifested in the flesh yet one prominent we get what was talking about anyway I watched look at this absolutely go with revelations 10 verse 3 and he said to me son of man cause my belly to eat and fill their bowels with this role that I give thee then I didn't did I eat it and it was in my mouth honey sweet right what John say John said his head my mouth sweet as honey sweet you know but in my belly it was better what John had a living all right let's see if you did cuz Eagle doesn't say anything about it being better John had to go live it and he said unto me son of man go get the end of the house of Israel and speak with my words unto them all right so everybody that this is prefigure of the son of man be Son of Man prefigured with Ezekiel going to the Israel and his rules going to do what what Israel do does equal turns him down and he pronounces judgment same thing when Jesus did Jesus went to one he went to his own in his own received him not right but many that did they became what sons of God which isn't what the Gentiles us want to receive him in our soul but the house of Israel turned him down for thou art sent to a people of strange speech and hard language but are not sent to people with strange feature partly know where he went sent people that didn't know who's eat you up he was sent to the house of Israel alright and then it goes on through and we can go through a lot of that but let's go to Ezekiel 12 and we go this is the same thing come back look somebody first two fishes they said in the main son of man these are the men that divides miss you can give week account from this city which I say is not near let us build houses cities to kill them you deflect there for a prophesy against them prophets also immensely the son of man is talking to the Ezekiel look at the Capitol and then look at the little ever the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me every time that you see that capitalist on a man and you see the little son of man you'll see as eq late to come in in other words the Spirit came into me or the Spirit fell upon me and send to me watch speak thus after or now look these on a man doesn't have saved us therefore is or but he's telling Ezekiel you say what I'm telling you to say thus saith the Lord this is what's going to happen to you right that's why bit that we got to be real careful when we start saying the staff the Lord 90 brother Ram Singh will have thus says the Lord and be still but remember the bride's don't have to be able to speak in the first person not the set the Lord yes when you come up to this adoption stage okay this adoption stage it's not crying daddy daddy where are now now this is the day doing the speaking because this was the son of man right bring it back what we've been talking about this is the son of man this whole section / command is decent man sorry the headstone that's why that's why they didn't realize what the Sun man was cuz man took this away creeds and dogmas took what the son of man out of the picture but it was the son of God down to seven church ages they put people in the body yeah the son of man got to come back in the same powers when you alone here the first part on our first time okay so are we so I want to ask you a question right now are we the little som or the biggest hope when we give is a body chain remember the little xon was Ezekiel the person the big somn is Jesus Christ we're little adèle that's correct that's why brother Brown said I am a son of man revealing be sentimental when be some amends reveal what is it he dropped back in yet he never left you it's a revelation he's revealing to you than had I've been this big guy it was you know ever since the beginning of time you know our beginning of the church ages but you have made yourself the little som you made yourself that right but he wants us to realize because remember little xon never goodbye Kane is he killing everything buddy tonight okay that's right this man did this is where the body changes gotta come from this man's got to be back in power not the little X 0 ends that's my whole point now you give me about five minutes let's go to 99 and we'll see what this stuff question is that Jesus is talking about the one we're going to get back and talk more on the son of man because it's very important they might understand this whole pretense he is that the son of God the Son of God is the new birth in your soul put you in the kingdom push you in the body of Christ make sure you creature a new creation makes you part of a bride makes you part of the family of God but that's no guarantee that your body is going to be changed without dead you're one saying them because it will be change but change without death the only time you're gonna have change without death is this right here okay sons of God have died since the first church age right all right but when I son of man resurrected ain't never saw a man died but that big ass right thing no way because remember he said I'm alive forevermore when he stood down on earth he was the son of man when he come out of that grave that flesh was made eternal all right yes miss Reed if I skip Daniel 7 will go back to Daniel next Sunday Matthew 96 but then you may know now what'd he do he forgave this person of his sins sick of palsy lying on a bed seeing their faith said of the sink and Paul this son be able to cheer thy sins be forgiven thee right certainly the scribe says this man blessing Jesus knowing their thoughts should wear for think he evil in your heart for weather is easier to say thy sins be forgiven they are say rise along but that you may know that the Son of Man calculus always jump the west wing talks about him hath power on earth to forgive sin then he said to the sick of Paul do you rise take up the bed I'm going to the house all right so now let's go to now Matthew chapter 12 the brutal get back to Matthew 17 in a little while Matthew 12 verse 32 right then we're going to read the quote work why that's 31 wherefore I say in the old matter of sin if blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto man and one whosoever speaketh the word against the son of man he shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven neither in this world of the world to come now look he'll make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupting his fruit crud when the tree is known by a scrutiny talks about the people generation about it what in this scenario what is Jesus saying he said alright I have the one inside of me that forgive right you can speak against me but come on flesh man does the flesh was given remembering will try to break it down when I finish with some my number getting started and Isaiah says he gave his soul ransom he didn't give his flesh of his flesh was the sacrifice just like the flesh of a lamb the flesh was a sacrifice the soul was real offering that was what was encased inside this flesh a man but you won't you can't separate them to have guns in their use some bad that's the son of man all right now but what he says the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiving of the men that what they do some men were talking to Jesus to person some called him a wine-bibber they say you'd run around with prostitutes and publicans and all that you said wash blasphemy no that was talking my command Jesus right he said but you speak against the Holy Ghost now what does he do he goes on further and what did they say they said this man makes himself God now what they're doing what they're saying is they here have this anything but that was the works of what this man was right so what brother Brown say let's turn to go to the barrel in a second we would find it real quick I left this new format here they'll have their kind of tag again I will eventually i will write here jesus said while they're going to earth they brought him one day a bunch of men they said he cast out devils new bells above the pencil devils jesus said you can speak a word against the son of man will be forgiven but this rebel speaking at the word against the Holy Ghost will not be forgiven him in this world of the world come whosoever speaketh against the holy gospel they were calling see the atonement the blood cell as I'll get to after a bit was not burst yet so it could be forgiven then it was forgiven under the blood of bulls and goats right she just was still standing there under the law they were still making sacrifices he was telling them to go max hyperposite so their sins could be forgiven under the blood of bulls and goats but so it could be forgiven them the Holy Ghost had not yet pierced itself from this blood cell but after once coming from there it's the unpardonable so when Jesus came back going to bed Pentecost and that Holy Ghost entered entered into the peter paul james and all over nepal the peter james and john hall them you speak against that you'll not be forgiven I stopped strong that is look at the bride of Jesus Christ that's why that's why that if you say it's the brother Brown City you say off for gave Sam remember him that lady acting said you forgive them people their sins he said there's not far from the truth in other words what he was saying inside yourself was yeah that's what happened but he wasn't gonna give it a war ii to itself he wasn't gonna do that but that's what he did but why did he do it though he had the Holy Ghost inning the Holy Ghost was one getting people way around couldn't forgive me anybody but the Holy Ghost through the filter of a problem is a new testament prophet could tell those people your sins are forgiven but now look he didn't forgive them of their sins and then let him do whatever they want to do remember when he told him he said don't you ever whatever you've done don't ever duplicate that in other words don't ever do that again if your step what out the reason I look at this as managing divorce if you're sitting there and you're single I mean I'm single but divorced and you're separated from your wife you can reconcile with your wife but you can't go back somebody else just go she said you're free there's a lot of stipulations in Bobby's a lot of things involved with marriage and divorce there honey you're going to get into maybe later i will get into but we won't get into it now but that's the reason that the son of man you speak against him because that holy ghost was inside that man but it had not been burst yeah so they were covered under the blood will windows but now when the day pet coughs come I was it went bulls and goats anymore it was that holy ghost in those people those remember Peter cold and I since the fire he said you have what spoken against not Peter he said you've spoken against the Holy go so they were forgiven well they were they were killed let's go home was I got some more next ended Lord will you
