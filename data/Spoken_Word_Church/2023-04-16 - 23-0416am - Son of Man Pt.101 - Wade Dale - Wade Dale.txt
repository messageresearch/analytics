would this chip be amen let's give him a hand I know the rainy day everybody wants to sleep in and I woke up this morning at 7:00 and I said well I better get ready we're going to go do battle today and uh I was sitting in there having my coffee and brother collie called me and uh we had a wonderful conversation and he told me it was something kind of funny he only brother collie can say to kind of lighten things up with everybody he said you know it's funny he said I'm calling your brother Don and I'm telling you my back is hurting me and it's really bothered me and he says I always feel better when I talk with you he said but I know as soon as I do this and we go ahead with a day my my pain just goes away and I said well you know who's causing that he said yes so I tell you we all uh one of us getting older I'm not I'm sure a lot of you out there are feeling your little ache and pains at at 50 and 60 but I look at papa out there and I wonder he just keep shuffling One Foot In

example right there amen help me Lord I love you you brought me to Christ God sent me to him I don't know where this is coming from folks I just simply want to come up this morning and and read my scripture and uh I didn't understand the scripture God gave me to read but once brother Bob started talking I said this is it and all the way here he was showing me how the flame is not to hurt us

Earth Lord that we can only walk in you and your word Lord because it's the only truth we know is your word you sent your word and I love that scripture you sent your word to heal us and that's

so let's just remember him in prayer the family's there remember brother Bob will be speaking for us Wednesday night good job again today with the with the um the Bible study I I just can't steal and you count me whatever you want to count me but false Doctrine is false Doctrine if you believe that you came here without a free moral agency then that is false Doctrine they nobody teaches that well there are some that teach it but it's not true you came here with a free will or God is not a just God see it takes him away from being the righteous judge what's he going to judge if this group over here just came this way stamped and ready to go as brother brandham said God didn't put you in a tube and pull you through and make you a Christian you made a choice and then when at the white Throne judgment we won because we're bride but the choice is they made in life the ones that didn't receive the New Birth the choices are going to determine their Eternal destination but today I hope and pray that you've already made yours if you make it on this side I don't want to stand on the other side and have to be judged by my works I want to be judged by his Works amen also remember today

again so you're just a part of us now so you're not a visor anymore you may be M fleeman next time you come but that's okay but good to have them with us in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made what that word was made flesh God does not have a problem being in human flesh we think we have a problem being in human flesh cuz you say oh you know if I wasn't in that well get the new birth as Bob said get the fire of God to burn out what that old part's inside of you and you will absolutely have the word made flesh inside of you all right and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can have your seats and I'll finish reading we're going to try to get to through with godliness and get to a little bit of Brotherly kindness this afternoon second Peter 1 verse 5 is where we've been for those of you that have uh that um kind of getting in right in the middle of this we're talking on the Statue of perfect man we believe that the prophet of God told us that these things are required because the Bible tells us these things are required so it's not just something that we we picked up and and well you know second Peter sounds good I think I'll read it he says besides this giving all diligence so there must be something that you got something urgent or something that you need to be what diligent about add to your faith as we'll read in just a few minutes well we've read this quote over and over but I want you to see oh I got all Faith I've got faith for this and Faith for that brother R said faith alone won't do it faith alone will not do it you got to go on further with God sure you can get born again Again by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved but remember I want to tell you something this morning you only really believe what you obey right CU I'm going to read you quote here in a little while brother Brown said I've been here 30 years and you women still cut your hair you know why they didn't believe the Bible said anything about women cutting hair exactly same way with all not all y'all but a lot of people does about church you don't obey it because you don't believe it and you know what that makes you an unbeliever all right second Peter 1 verse5 say besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue this is an addition to and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and to patience godliness and the Bible tells us in 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy in other words we don't have to get a brother George we don't have to get a round table discussion going on on godliness no cuz without controversy great is the mystery of godliness now what was the mystery God was manifested in the flesh that's good enough for me right there all right justified in the spirit seen of angels preach into the Gentiles believe on in the world received up into glory and I'm not adding to the word of God came back and went into you that's the mystery that's the controversy that even maybe um people in the message have about how you get born born again there's 17 different ways no there's one way amen and we're not some special people now that we're born again yeah we are but you got to get born again first that's right most important thing and brother V said the most ill taught subject as I've told you many times before you might get saved listening to a tape somewhere but you will not go on with God you will fall somewhere without a five-fold Ministry all right it takes somebody to stand here and look you in the face and say hey we got issues we got things we have to do because that's what the Bible told us that is as we look right there in that little red it says plan God had a plan and a purpose he planned it this way but you know why he planned it cuz he saw it he saw that we would need today that we would need Wednesday that we would need a Bible study that we would need watching uh you know on YouTube different ministers and listening to tapes and reading the books that's the plan so he made it all available to us so now we have a free choice somebody ought to preach on that a free choice to either take it or reject it all right so that word controversy is without Strife or dispute without quarreling we're not going to quarrel we know where God is today God's not in a building God's not in a car God's not in a tree he's in human beings all right and we're going to talk about this afternoon Minister said one time I can't remember he was he was here preaching not too long ago but I can't remember which one said it he said he U first time he come in the message said he got the book anointed ones he said it scared him to death it should scare all of us to death anointed ones at the end time was a hard message for the prophet to preach cuz he had people sitting in his congregation that was a recipient of that they were anointed on their Spirit realm but it didn't get into the soul see that didn't didn't get into the new birth it got into the spirit realm of man and you know what anoints your memory reason conscious effects and Imagination make you shout jump up and down and preach the gospel right Judas did Sir cuz he was anointed to do that but he didn't have the new birth he actually was black in his soul so that's what we're looking at at the end time even Jesus stood up one day and said they'll be false Christ false anointed ones he said it himself he didn't say false Jesus is he said false Christ who are anointed one so we'll get to that this afternoon cuz I want to bring that in in godliness because Bible tells us they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof all right so brother R say so for know knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning like I said before brother B he bring he he he brings a message to a group of people and he tells the people he says oh now for knowledge is not a good uh word to use he in other words in a mixed crowd Methodist Baptist Presbyterians and all that mixed crowd all right wouldn't talk about women or men or black or white he's talking about mixed denominations mixed mixed ideas uh controversy all right so that's what but he was telling he said look he said for knowledge is a better word to use so for knowledge takes it all the way back to the mind of God where everybody wants to go get in the mind of God and that's fine Brother R told us to get in the mind of God but he could tell the end from the beginning so he looked down and he saw Danny fountain's life from the time he was a baby till the time that he goes into Rapture knew what his choices were and therefore set together a plan to meet him one day and come and and and cross his path amen amen not that he was this great something he was eternal as he was a baby and he comes up and he's got eternal life and then all of a sudden oh I just realized it all the things I did eternal life wasn't nowhere around and I don't know about you but I think I'm I'm a member of that club all right but God cleaned me up God burned that old nature out of me and put his nature inside that's the new birth all right not just attaching his nature to us but giving us his nature burning the old you out so he could tell the from the beginning therefore knowing all things he could just do what he could just put everything out there all right knowing all these marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things have you ever done that just stand and witness the things that even when brother Bron was in this was in 1962 from 62 now here it's to 2023 the things has transpired that brother Brown said it's like brother Ernie always said he said we've got Tom Mar's news today we know what's going to happen we know where the mark of the beast is we know that what communism is and not to fear it we know it's denominations and how to fear that and where Satan's seed is now yeah that's right all right but we also know the seals are open we also know there's a way to get out of here we also know we don't depend on death and to stand and witness and see the things that we've seen now God had to make a preparation for it now listen so he made a choice don't get quiet on me God made a choice he made a choice to save you he didn't have to God's God remember before all this he was self-existing didn't need air to breathe didn't need me and you to tell him what to do hello somebody but you know what he decided that he's going to have a plan he decided that he would put Adam and Eve in human flesh to work on the earth and be the god of the Earth but he knew when they were put in human flesh they were going to fall but he had attributes of Savior healer Redeemer all that was inside of him that needed and he wanted to express them all right so he expressed them by letting them fall not making them fall see there we go again with free choice Adam and Eve had free choice Eve could have just said no there wasn't some great something going on it just Eve could have just said no let me go get Adam and I'll no Satan being who he was knew he could work on her emotions right that's why sisters should not be preaching our Ur in any Authority in the church now that's Bible and the prophet's message so if you get mad at that go talk to them but that's just the way it is cu that's the plan am that's the plan of God Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother R said now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind know there's what for knowledge he fornew those who he forew he did predestinate if he didn't know you it's really simple you you look at brother Chris just explained it so well Sunday I know some of you thought he may have been a little bit off but no it's a masterpiece that was a way to tell it right there there's not a spot there's not a tangible something that you've got that somebody else don't have it's just a representation that you had from predestination as the woman at the well had representation see the the the the cus and all them they didn't have representation cuz God knew by Foreign knowledge he knew they would hate him they knew he would they would never accept him but he knew she would by her choice but it's not something tangible but you can't do away with the quotes you got brother Ram said he said you come here baby you come here with something in you that's a quote you got to do something with it though then he said eternal life started at the altar you got to do something with that too but you bring it all together and realize that brother Brandon was looking in the mind of God telling you what God's saying about you right and then you're over here seeing the sinner giving their heart to God that's the flesh part that's somebody trying to get right remember God can't change his mind right if he loves you in a beginning he always will love you can't change his mind so that way yeah I'll go with predestination or predetermine if you go that way but not that you come here and you didn't have a choice I just ain't going with that amen it's not according to the Bible not according to Prophet message right so if it's according to yours do you have a controversy and I'm really not even going to talk to you about that controversy that's just so off the word that we don't have any choice now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve in other words to make it unfold he had a motive in doing it what to let himself be expressed then he talks about neither moon or star let's just keep going 2 Peter 3:14 says wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found in him in peace without spotting blameless the question was we can't be perfect no not in oursel we can't we fail every day we have failed by getting up this morning all right some of you could have had an argument with your spouse or even yourself Donnie's got his finger up bless your heart buddy I'm sorry you be all right I hope s Susan watching in you'll have a nugl when you get home sometimes it's good to just keep that just hold your hands down you know just maybe stick a finger up every once in a while but be diligent take notes you two be be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spotting blameless the question was I you know you hear the people in the world I can't be perfect you're not perfect and I'm not perfect when you start talking about these different things that God's done in in your life and no you're not by yourself but God said in the Bible second Peter 3:14 says you could be found in him without spot and blameless the Bible says spot or Wrinkle in a certain place and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord there's your patience is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you now God's waited 2,000 years he he's no I'm sorry he's waited 6,000 years he walked with Adam and Eve and tool of the garden talking just like me and Michael are looking at each other right now nothing in between that's what he wanted or he'd have made it different right we got to remember that if God if that's the way God wrote it that's the way he wanted it and it's not going to change we've got to adhere to it his plan not ours but he was he would go down and talk to Adam say hey man how you doing good I'm fine yeah man we're good all right everything's fine I'm going to go back in this other dimension you take care of this round ball we call the Earth all right he can't do that now sin broke the picture up sin broke the chain everybody with me so now instead of being born with the nature of God the two Natures you're not born with two Natures folks you're not born with two Natures in your soul I'm sorry I am so sorry about that that's old two Soul Doctrine and then Satan be gives you a soul he's not a Creator there only one Creator and that's God but though he want God wanted you to have his nature the whole time yeah but when we when when um what happened in the garden it separated he had to take this back I hope this is for somebody maybe it's for me but he takes back the book of redemption he takes back that book and and coming down through time now he allows you to come like this you you come as a fallen nature right right so now where's this other nature at where's this Genesis 126 man is everybody with me where's this Genesis 126 man it didn't come with you hello we got them in the front amen let's get them in the back amen you don't have those two Natures you lost that one that Genesis 1:26 man never sinned never had a bad day never never even went to sleep amen but it stayed with God because sin was so hidious he said I'm going to put enmity or a division now Adam I can only talk talk to you through blood that's right you got to go kill an animal and he said I think I'll do the first one and then you do it afterwards so God killed an animal throw the skins in and said put these on everybody with me so that is the way you came you came with a fallen nature a soul given to you by God not Eternal but perfect and it became imperfect you can hear what the Bible tells us cuz the Bible say says being made perfect so if we were being made perfect that means we were imperfect to start with 1 Corinthians 1:7 so that you come behind and no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm what you confirm you until the end yeah you you know what our problem is we it's like I said about the laundry list our problem is is well I had a bad thought I need to get re-baptized well I I had a bad this I need to get this done and then I need to go get this done no just repent just repent and go on the best thing to do repent and go on he didn't say repent he said repent everyone you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you've done that you don't have to do that again but it's not that you're not going to sin either everybody with me who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be what blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called huh many are called few are chosen you were called listen everybody got the call of God to me that's the free moral agent everybody got called some will say yes some will say no pretty simple no in between no gray area amen you either was in the ark and lived or you was outside the ark and died righten there wasn't any that made it by the Skin of Their Teeth God is fa by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you wow we haven't got there yet but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same what judgment 1 Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceive neither fornicators idolators adulterers effeminate abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners pretty bad group amen oh yeah that's the that's them people's in jail let's read what Paul said in verse 11 and such for some of you that kind of knocks him in the teeth right and such were some of you he was looking at a congregation and such for some of you but you are washed in other words you made a choice you were this before now you're this to me folks that's a choice and you made the right one but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Philippians 2:15 says that you may be how many times have we read this blameless blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in this world so it takes Grace though it takes Grace it takes Amazing Grace to get us through that period and to get us born again it takes Grace that's why people that are not born again they're the most critical people in the world they don't know what they're talking about because they don't have didn't get Grace their self oh they didn't condemn people they can absolutely just run people down and ain't got enough of God in them to come to church well I said it anyway but we all need Grace everybody know Miss Grace some of y'all are in trouble Grace Grace Amazing Grace is for what you did in the past but it takes these virtues to keep us clean it takes these virtues cuz you're in your soul today if you're born again in your soul as brother B was talking about this morning in your soul the real you the real being that we're talking to today it's either born again or not there's not a gray area now you could be in justification and sanctification your walk could be as you're progressing but you got to start progressing do as the turtle start the race let the tortoise go out there a little bit further the hair is going to jump past him but he's going to be slow and steady that's the way we need to be slow and steady all right let's get to patience we talked about Temperance Temperance is having what power it's having control all right let's have patience now it is not in the new in Old Testament it's in the New Testament because without uh you look at Moses he didn't have a lot of patience you saw he was patient well it got him in trouble by not being patient he smoked the rock instead of spoke to it so he didn't have enough patience but in the New Testament a man who is not SW from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials those are um plural and sufferings patiently and steadfast brother Brown now this is kind of long but I'm going to read it anyway does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all un mindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wondered if God really loved them how could God be just and loveing if he stands by and watches his people suffer that's what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayeth the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau now if we stop right there we're going to make God then picking and choosing but the reason he hated Esau was what he saw Esau give away his Birthright four new he had four knowledge that that was going to happen therefore he could love Jacob and not love Esau and listen before you were born he either loved you or didn't right but you didn't know that we're down here now we're in time we're in Redemption time we're in Grace we're not going to need Grace when we get to heaven we're not going to need faith when we get to heaven we're going to be faith and hallelujah we're going to be Grace you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election now what is an election election is not you don't have a choice what is an election you have a choice you go to the poll and you vote cuz you have a choice chice to vote who you want in or who you want out regardless of all this other stuff that the Electoral College and all that stuff let's just go simple this God voted for you Satan voted against you you swing the vote all right it's going to be two to one one way or the other but God knows what you did or did but you don't all right look now watch keep going down through here but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us what virtue all these are tied together job 23 says you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 5:9 says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the auor of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him now here's brother Brown in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering or what patience and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so we can't get perfected without some suffering we can't get perfected on a flowery bed of e why did he want this James 1 my Breen counted all joy when you fall into how many of y'all just get up and start calling people said I'm just so happy I'm in this trial post it on Facebook I'm just so happy and big old stars going off and you know big heart bouncing up and down like some of y'all saying no when you're going through a trial you send that emoji that's are them other kind of emojis going through an issue or problem but it says right here in the Bible count it all joy let you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire what wanting nothing don't we want that then eat that scripture right there right amen why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8 ver1 17 and if children that HS HS of God and join ours with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that may we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him we have to suffer to reain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character it's satanic in other words the power that we've been talking about the virtue without the new birth you'll use it wrong that's right it's satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and sat down on his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him a little temporary suffering we go through temporary suffering now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing who are willing oh choice just made a choice there who are willing Free Will that's why I call it free will who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation that's your perfect man says and we're heading on up we still impatience for a little bit you're beginning to reflect the works of of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us now everybody listen let me stop for Mee everybody wants to be zealous we got we you should have a little bit of not jealousy zealous you should be zealous about coming to church you should be zealous about studying the Bible you should be zealous about somebody that is sitting beside of you that's worshiping God that that feels the power of God maybe it's not your turn yet but you know what maybe the next time is yours but you're doing one thing you're you're you're looking and you're seeing that these things are happening and you're not being fanatical about it all right that's why we've seen people as brother R says right here he's talking about really some of them are the Pentecostals who he was preaching to during that time they got fanatical they run out on the limb and say this is it speaking tongues you get the Holy Ghost well you know that's not the truth we find these things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of ministers Christians Christians not not a scrap heap of of of unregenerated people scrap heaps of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right in other words they weren't given the plan right ain't that what it is they weren't given the plan correctly you need to find somewhere where they do preach the plan correctly and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many would like to do that say Amen I'm not worthy well you just cut yourself off second Peter 3:9 say the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but longsuffering to us we're not willing see God got free will too he wasn't willing that any should perish because because listen there's no way God can stand and be God and just say well this is it I'm taking this group of people right here and I ain't taking no more and he sees billions upon billions upon billions that Grace will cover the kids that are under the age of accountability put them in heaven come on somebody uh cup of water in my name the people are good to the bride all these different ones that's going to be given eternal life the foolish virgin the Jews that stood for him all those different ones brother R said you know K I mean not Kus but U see that was the difference in cus and Nicodemus and and Gia Gia and Nicodemus kind of held their their stand and said okay if it be of God we can't stop it if it's not of God it'll stop itself but caias wanted to kill him so you see the difference in the two but but Nicodemus and and Gia will be given eternal life so there's that other group standing there that's going to be given eternal life by their what choice am because CIA and Nicodemus were two I mean they were the highest ranking besides the high priest they were the highest ranking uh what whatever you want to call them priest popes whatever or Bishops or whatever you know they looked to Gia and Nicodemus and then there was kyus the high priest what was the difference they made a choice but so did Kus make a choice so what's longsuffering bear long suffer long be longsuffering patiently enduring to be of a long Spirit not to lose heart please let's don't lose heart we've seen people we were just um discussing some things me and Chris the other day of all the people that we've seen come through the message and then they just disappear I'm talking about disappear well what happened they lost heart they didn't get born again number one but had somebody tell them see they had somebody sit there and tell them well just believe the message that's all you got to do just believe the message and and you're saved no the devil believes it more than you do cuz he comes to church when y'all don't quiet if you want to but it's a truth to persevere patiently and bravely in enduring what Misfortune and troubles to be patient and bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish got you a perfect man brother R says virtue must be in us and until we get virtue when we get true virtue then we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith look faith alone won't do it Paul gets to he says you can have all Faith you can have charity you can have all that stuff not charity you have you can have the Mysteries and you know all these things but have not charity which is right right there on top of the headstone you're sounding brass and a tinkling symbol faith alone won't do it now watch eled 1960 Abraham we find out didn't obey God just right now what wait a minute wait a minute Abraham's the father of our faith the foundation of our faith and brother R said he didn't obey God just right now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still have faith in the promise and then not obey still it hinders us let me go back to my quote you only really believe what you obey and think about that it's true in everything everything even out in the world you know things you the choices the all the things you only really believe what you obey cuz if you don't believe it you're not going to obey it all right it'll hinder us faith alone won't work because faith without works is dead that's right brother said what patience with what not with your neighbor not with your brother not at first he said patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience now how many of us have been through trials that we've had to do that we've had to hold on and then hold on I'm talking about when you get to the into your rope the old saying is tie not and hang on all right but somewhere God came through somewhere somehow God came through why because you persevered CU you didn't let go of the Rope at the top Isaiah 40: 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Feth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength thank God for a god like that even the you I I jury in the name of the Lord if you don't know that God today you need him cuz it's not going to get better it's going to get worse even the youth shall Fain and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary you ought to write a song about this they shall walk and not faint teach me Lord teach me Lord to what wait oh no we want we and we do we want them all saved their time though not our time right all right that's why you give them over to the Lord but now you but now you give them over the Lord sister Regina not with a little bit string attached to it either that if something gets wrong or gets bad you start pulling no give them to God lay them on that Altar and say God whatever save my children and don't pray for it to get any better that's hard to swallow but but I believe what brother Claud said and I got to think about that I at first I thought no come on man you need to pray for your kids but if your kids if you're praying that your kids come to God and then you start praying that off of them cuz you can't remember brother Ram said he even said you could pray something off somebody be careful give them over to God if they're having trouble then you just let God handle it all right mothers remember this let God handle it I mean the men sometimes were like hey I told you and the moms are going like can't we just call them and let them come to the house one time no cut the cord let God do his work how many of you would like to save your children you just wasted your time I just wasted my time telling you that too but you sure can't pray for them you sure can say God stir their water don't let them sleep that's right Joshua would always tell us a long time ago you know and we' praying for him and he get in a car W he'd be one of the guys that'd be four guys you know at standing around and one guy throw a rock through a window and they blame Josh sometimes maybe it was him sometimes maybe it wasn't but he always got to blame and um he told us one day he said would y'all quit praying for me he said I'm having trouble at every turn in every corner I said y'all he said y'all just quit I know what you're doing that's what I want it to be I want it to be where they don't have any wiggle room they have no way out they got to come back to God not Mama and Daddy they got to come back to God amen let God take care of them and it might look bad listen if we have to go through suffering if we have to go through trials if we have to go through Temptation being child of God what about somebody that's coming to God just lay your hands off of it turn your head and say God you save me save them the trouble of it we people were in too much of a hurry yeah I want them all save it's just got to be done right now now can't come back no more and when you get that in your mind you're going to lose right there as I've always told you this is not a microwave religion this is not a microwave Christianity this is a Crockpot right turn it on low and leave it alone and come back several hours later and you got something to eat we did that not too long ago Jim did man it was good pot roast too you're on losing ground right there you don't have nothing to stand on you you must be patient he's not asking you he said you must be patient we should have now here we go you got to have patience with God first but we should have patience with one another too and I wrote myself a note but I'm going to leave it for right now I'll not read it like I've tried to get this message over look at the Tabernacle now this is a prophet of God I'm nothing all right I'm just a minister he was a church aged messenger a prophet that brought the word he was the conduit of God Amen he was someone that you thought well he's just going to stand there and everything he says the people just going to do what he says right right right wouldn't that be the way yeah they wasn't one denomination sto because brother brandom came right there wasn't one woman quit bobing her hair that didn't want to it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years years see have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same you know why cuz you believe what you obey wait have you have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience that's why I said it was it took him 33 years to come to the place to preach this to where he could give his people instruction on how to stop doing this and how to quit doing this or that or the other have patience wherefore seeing also we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us let us run with what patience the race that is set before us uh that's what I was trying to explain to you the other day when you say patience Lauren everybody says patience well just you know just go sit in your easy chair I've always told you if you're looking for a job don't pray to God find you a job and then go sit down in a lounge chair God is not going to come knocking on your door and say hey I got you a job now you going to have to get your sorry high in out love for one and then God will open the door for the choices you make if you put God first all these other things the Bible says will fill what fall into place problem is is we don't start we start by our what we want not my will but thy will be done then let God if you're asking for a job or or getting married or whatever more ask God but listen don't just never visit her again if you're talking about marrying somebody or you know you still got you know what I'm saying don't don't pull your door up shut in your closet I mean in your bedroom and say I ain't coming out till God gives me you'll die you'll be lonely and you'll die God wants you to what run with patience run with patience the race it so that set before us looking onto Jesus what the alter and finish of our faith in other words look this way how many of you new drivers the problem with the new driving with me was I was looking at the at the hood of the car and trying to judge the white line and the yellow line I don't know if I'm the only one but maybe I am you can't do that you'll be off like this you got to what pick you a spot from here to the door 50 ft away or somewhat and when you do that it's like brother r talks about the guy little kid with a bicycle and he rode that little th thing and everybody was falling off why they was falling off cuz they was watching their wheels and he get close to the edge and they just fall over but he said how did you win Johnny Johnny said I just looked at the prize and took off and that's what we got to do we got to look at the prize take off and listen make sure it's the right prize looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him and endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Matthew 10:22 says you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that what endureth to the end shall be saved that word endureth means what to remain abide not recede or flee that's our problem we get a little bit of something going on in our life and you disappear don't do that don't do that not recede or flee to preserve under misfortunes and trials to hold fast to one's faith in Christ to endure bear bravely and calmly this ill treatment the word end means the end to which all things relate the aim or the purpose you know what the end of God's plan is eternal life the end of his plan is eternal life we don't need Redemption when we get over there Redemption will be over listen Redemption is over for the Gentiles when we're down here right amen it continues on to the white Throne of judgment but after that the end is just the beginning of your eternity the end of all things has come upon man well if the end of all things then we're just going to die and we're just going to evaporate no the end of all things is is if you pass away from this world you're going to step over into another one and you're going to be Eternal that don't that a end like this all right Hebrews 6:12 says that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and P look followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself because he knew then see the promise that he made Adam and Eve he made it with condition but he made it before the fall right eat that tree you're good don't eat that tree you're bad right right but then now that we're down here in the sin or in the fall the Fallen stage the first three dimensions God comes down and he says I know you can't do it I know you're going to have problems cuz I've already seen you have problems but I'm going to make a way I'm going to give you a provision it's called and it's called an unconditional Covenant most every Covenant has a condition to it do this don't do that I'm going to do this for you you got to do this for me back and forth God raised his hand up and he said because I could swear by no other I swore by myself I'm going to do this thing I am is his name I am he's still The Great I Am CU who's going to do this plan I am for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee multiplying I look at those words I Brother D preached on this long time ago uh you go to Hebrews but if you'll go over to Genesis about 12 there's about 20 times God said I will he didn't tell Abraham now Abraham you you no he said I will shed right here too surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured for 25 years he obtained the promise Luke 21:19 says in your patience possess ye your soul let's look at godliness just for a minute and we'll close pick that up this afternoon godliness means holiness there's something we'll get to later on I want to see I want you to see but it's reverence respect piety towards God are the word godliness 2 Timothy 3:2 if you'll look in your Bible and look up the word godliness Timothy covers it about 20 times almost in his chapters in those little chapters of Timothy so read the whole chapters of Timothy every one of them two one two and three I think maybe there's four I can't remember I don't have to remember it's in my Bible second Timothy 3: all the old people said amen for men shall be lovers of their own selves Here We Go Again Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents have I hit anybody yet I'm fixing to if you didn't unthankful Unholy without natural affection tell that to the government truth Breakers false accusers incontinent somebody stand stand up that I ain't hit them yet didn't think so Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors he High minded lovers of pleasure than going to church having a form then of godliness that we're talking about our piety but denying the power you only really believe what you obey and that's where the power lies but you can have a form of that power and it be wrong many a woman preachers got up and preached messages that probably could out preach anybody in this building but they're wrong right because that's what the Bible says they're wrong so go back to the beginning to the Bible if it's wrong I don't care what they preach they're not supposed to all right having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sord are they which creep into houses churches and Lead silly women churches Laden with sins LED away with many lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth 1 Timothy 3:16 and without controversy we read this the beginning great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preach of the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory and as I said before came back down and gave us every bit of that everybody with me so now brother Brown's getting into godliness and we'll read this and get musicians come on but if you got genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to it then genuine knowledge then genuine patience then genu I mean genuine Temperance then genuine patience you're moving right on up the line all right you're you're working the plan fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean now remember you got a part of godliness when you got born again cuz you got part of God but you really got to go way up here to the top almost before he asked you to be that right and not just be that on Sunday I didn't get an amen from that what does godliness mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeff there and found in a dictionary godliness means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue knowledge temper patience then be like God you say I can't do that brother brandom yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures and he talks about Matthew 5:48 be you therefore what Perfect all all the virtue see this is now let's stand to our feet you only really believe what you obey all right I'm going to believe that the virtue of God Temperance patience of God as a portion was put in me at my new birth amen that's what I believe but I don't I can't obey all of it because I don't have that kind of godliness way up there in the pyramid when I get born again because you start down here right but as my faith rise R es so does my virtues rise everybody with me all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you now if I believe that then I got to obey it be therefore p r f e c what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you got way up here now before you're asked to do that in other words the part of God's plan was that he's not going to have you act like God at the beginning he wants you to have virtue he wants you have have knowledge Temperance patience then he asked you to be like God you get way up here before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things I can say along that line he talks about going to Ephesians 4 oh wait a minute let's read that is that in the Bible Ephesians 4:12 oh he gave some Apostles and some prophets now how we going to get perfect how we going to grow in the statute of perfect man he's telling us how remember last night don't try to take the other man's office and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of God do they read like that congregation says Nope the Perfection of what and they said Saints that's us who are the Saints the Sanctified ones amen the one started look the one started from down here down where right there at Faith amen perfecting of the Saints for the work in the ministry Ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ building it up till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God to the perfect man and to the Assurance to the measure of the stature the fullness of Christ let's read this right here real quick if this Union 1965 and a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God arst a requirement he has to be like God he honors God he is part of the word of God part of that Genesis one man same as that John one man he is part of the word of God and in this last days of this bride taking form just exactly the same power that he was in at the beginning
