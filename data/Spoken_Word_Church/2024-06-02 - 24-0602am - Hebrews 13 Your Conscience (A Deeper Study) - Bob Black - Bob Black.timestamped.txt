[1:05] well um to exercise the gift um
[1:11] so if all is well nothing will change if
[1:14] we need to we'll we'll adapt as needed
[1:17] um we've been uh we wrapped up uh the
[1:19] book of Hebrews last Sunday um and Paul
[1:22] was just kind of talking about
[1:23] conscience there in that last chapter um
[1:26] but before we get on to another topic
[1:28] let's just circle back and just talk
[1:29] talk about conscience some more and uh
[1:32] maybe maybe nail it down a little bit
[1:34] further get a little bit deeper let's go
[1:36] to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[1:38] grateful for your word in this hour Lord
[1:40] God to guide us and give us something
[1:41] Lord to know how we should act and how
[1:43] we should do Lord God how we should
[1:45] conduct ourselves I thank you God for
[1:47] that conscience that still Small Voice
[1:48] in our heart that gives us that little
[1:50] pride in which direction we should go
[1:52] and how to how to how to guide Our Lives
[1:54] Lord we ask Lord that you'll just be
[1:56] with the services this morning Lord and
[1:58] that you'll be with Brother Richard
[1:59] preparing back there Lord God and be
[2:02] with our hearts Lord Jesus to prepare us
[2:03] for what you have in store for us today
[2:05] Lord bless us now we pray in your
[2:08] name now one illustration I'm just going
[2:11] to read this little scripture and and
[2:13] we're just kind of going to go do a
[2:14] little study and First Peter chapter 2:6
[2:17] we know that this is a scripture we're
[2:19] familiar with wherefore also is
[2:20] contained in the scripture behold iay
[2:22] and Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[2:25] precious and he that believeth on him
[2:26] shall not be confounded and you know one
[2:29] place brother R use as an example of
[2:31] your conscience that it's like a little
[2:33] a four corner cornered stone that you
[2:35] know it's in your heart and it's it
[2:37] it'll rub and PR away and if you don't
[2:39] listen to it it will just kind of smooth
[2:41] out in there until it's not having any
[2:44] effect anymore that you just kind of
[2:46] push it away but God has given us uh I I
[2:49] think something in there to kind of poke
[2:50] at us when we're when we're doing wrong
[2:53] and George Washington I put this quote
[2:54] in there real good that he said labor to
[2:56] keep alive in your breast that little
[2:58] spark of celestial fire
[3:00] called conscience that when when when
[3:02] you feel that little proud of something
[3:04] that you you need to listen to it now
[3:07] you know we might ask the question why
[3:09] why what's so important to listen to the
[3:11] con to your conscience what's so
[3:13] important to listen to it it as long as
[3:15] I get what I want as long as I achieve
[3:17] my goals and this those kind of things
[3:19] and what does it matter uh so let's just
[3:21] kind of Labor that point a little bit
[3:23] it's a sign listening to your conscience
[3:26] is a sign of genuine faith in 1 Timothy
[3:30] 1:5 it says now the end of the
[3:32] Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[3:35] heart and have a good conscience and of
[3:39] faith
[3:39] unfeigned and we well as we study this
[3:42] out and go through the scriptures you'll
[3:43] find out that your conscience listening
[3:45] to your conscience actually actually has
[3:47] something to do with your testimony and
[3:49] maybe I maybe I should have uh named
[3:51] this the title of this sermon this
[3:53] morning uh it's it's about the journey
[3:56] not not about the goal the the details
[3:58] are so much in it's about the journey uh
[4:01] and and your conscience is about your
[4:03] journey how do you react to situations
[4:05] and how you react to things in life and
[4:08] how you as you're going toward your goal
[4:10] how you how how you approach things are
[4:14] you willing to steal and light lie and
[4:16] cheat are you willing to to uh kick
[4:19] somebody to the curve to achieve your
[4:21] goal or are you willing to to do it in a
[4:24] way that matches what God's word says it
[4:28] allows for confidence before before God
[4:30] when you don't have anything in your
[4:31] heart that condemns you then you can you
[4:33] can bring your petition before God
[4:35] boldly and you can come at that's what 1
[4:38] John 3:21 says behold if our heart
[4:40] condemn us not then have we confidence
[4:43] toward God and I can have confidence
[4:46] when I'm bringing my prayer before God
[4:48] because there's nothing between me and
[4:50] my savior nothing between me I've made
[4:51] it all right if there's it is anything
[4:54] then lay it before God and say God
[4:56] forgive me forgive me of what I've done
[4:59] and and and oh you then then you can
[5:02] really have confidence to approach
[5:03] things in the right way and it's
[5:06] necessary for Effective service 1
[5:09] Timothy 1:19 says holding Faith holding
[5:12] your faith and a good conscience I I'm
[5:15] doing everything right everything that I
[5:17] know how to do right I'm doing
[5:18] everything according to what God's word
[5:20] says if God's word says I need to be
[5:22] baptized and in the name of the Lord
[5:24] Jesus Christ I'm going to do that if God
[5:26] says I need to be born again I'm going
[5:27] to struggle and and what you go through
[5:29] the process read my Bible and pray and
[5:32] and and and uh until something happens
[5:35] until God's word becomes a reality to me
[5:37] I I've done everything that I know how
[5:39] to do have a good conscience what which
[5:42] some having put away concerning Faith
[5:44] have made shipwreck and we know that's
[5:46] the case people preach for 20 30 years
[5:49] and holding out down in their heart that
[5:52] they don't even believe the message
[5:54] we've seen examples of that where you
[5:56] they're not preaching from a good
[5:57] conscience they don't even believe with
[5:59] what they're preaching and how can you
[6:01] have have faith and effective service
[6:04] and really lead people in the way that
[6:05] they should go if you don't have a good
[6:07] conscience it's a witness to others when
[6:09] you have a good conscience and you know
[6:11] that you've done everything right and
[6:13] you know you've done everything by the
[6:14] book following the rules then it's a
[6:17] witness to others in 1 Peter 3:16 Says
[6:20] having a good conscience that whereas
[6:23] they speak evil of you as of
[6:25] evildoers they may be ashamed that
[6:28] falsely accuse your good conversation in
[6:31] Christ and when you have a good
[6:33] conscience and you're walking according
[6:35] to the word and you're you're uh you got
[6:38] something against your brother you asked
[6:39] them to forgive you and you come with
[6:40] humility and your whole life is about
[6:43] trying to trying to do things right and
[6:45] and and and and those kind of things
[6:47] then it becomes it becomes a witness to
[6:49] others and now you can kind of see how
[6:51] it builds up to where your conscience is
[6:54] related to your testimony because if you
[6:56] have a good conscience and you're a
[6:58] witness to others and others can see
[7:00] your life and the way that you're
[7:02] concerned about doing things the right
[7:04] way then it becomes a witness to others
[7:08] and it's a matter of obedience and
[7:10] pleasing God in Hebrews 13:18 says pray
[7:13] for us for We Trust we have a good
[7:14] conscience and all things willing to
[7:17] live honestly now that's the scripture
[7:19] that we finished in Hebrews 13 last uh
[7:22] Sunday that Paul is is talking about how
[7:25] that we should pray pray for the the
[7:27] leaders of the church and so forth
[7:29] because that that we want to have we
[7:31] want to do things in the right way and
[7:34] conscience what it means is the English
[7:36] translation of that Greek word I I don't
[7:38] even I have have a clue how to pronounce
[7:40] that U that that looks like a puzzle to
[7:44] work out but it what means a a word in
[7:46] classical Greek referred to knowledge
[7:49] now now look out conscience has these
[7:51] two meanings knowledge you know what
[7:54] you're supposed to do but then it's got
[7:58] something else your self judgment you
[8:01] know what you're supposed to do but then
[8:03] you look back and you're judging
[8:05] yourself did I do the right thing how
[8:07] how am I going to move
[8:08] forward knowledge especially the
[8:11] knowledge derived from reflection on
[8:13] one's past deeds and so again this is
[8:17] about your journey your journey is the
[8:20] important thing where how how you go
[8:23] about things how you go about life that
[8:25] that uh promotion you want to get at
[8:26] work how are you going to do it how how
[8:29] you going how how are you going to go
[8:31] about the thing the appraisal of these
[8:34] Deeds determine whether the conscience
[8:38] is good or
[8:40] bad Hebrews 9:14 says how much more
[8:43] shall the blood of Christ who through
[8:46] the eternal spirit offered himself
[8:48] without spot to God Purge your
[8:50] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[8:52] Living God and Hebrews 1022 says let us
[8:56] draw near with a true heart and full
[8:59] Assurance of
[9:01] Faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[9:03] an evil conscience and our bodies washed
[9:07] with pure water now there ought think
[9:11] that God can take your your perverted
[9:13] conscience that you were born with that
[9:14] you don't even know how to do things
[9:16] right and everything that can that can
[9:18] wash it and cleanse it and change it so
[9:21] that you start living by a different
[9:24] standard not the world standard where
[9:27] the goalpost matters more but a
[9:29] different standard where the journey
[9:31] matters more and what I mean by the
[9:33] journey matters more is because when the
[9:35] Bible says Thou shalt not lie that
[9:38] matters more than where you're getting
[9:40] to that matters more than that cookie
[9:43] you're trying to eat as a little kid
[9:45] that when the Bible says Thou shalt not
[9:47] steal that matters more than than
[9:50] getting that cookie you're it's the
[9:51] journey the journey matters more than
[9:53] the
[9:54] goalpost and conscience if if we really
[9:58] dive down into those two me meanings it
[10:00] means that moral knowledge the inner
[10:03] voice that t helps you to distinguish
[10:05] between right and wrong and your
[10:08] self-judgment conscience also involves
[10:11] the act of self-reflection and
[10:13] self-evaluation based on our
[10:15] understanding of right and wrong and
[10:17] then we got the the illustration that
[10:19] brother Randon would use he'd say consci
[10:20] your conscience is like a stoplight when
[10:22] you see the stoplight you know you're
[10:24] not supposed to go but if you run the
[10:26] stoplight then you can look back I I
[10:29] shouldn't have done
[10:31] that and it's that that that
[10:33] condemnation there and Hebrews 8:10 says
[10:35] for this is the Covenant that I will
[10:37] make with the house of Israel after
[10:38] those days sayith the Lord now there's a
[10:41] stoplight I'll put my laws into their
[10:44] mind and write them in their
[10:47] hearts and I will be to them a God and
[10:50] they shall be to me a people he'll
[10:53] actually put his laws in Your Heart by
[10:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that
[10:57] you know what you're supposed to do
[10:59] right 1 Corinthians 4:4 says for I know
[11:02] nothing by
[11:03] myself yet him yet am I not hereby
[11:07] Justified but he that judges me is the
[11:09] Lord and 1 Corinthians 10:23 says all
[11:13] things are lawful for me but all things
[11:15] are not expedient but thing all things
[11:18] are lawful for me but all things edify
[11:22] not so there's some things in life that
[11:26] we've got Liberty as a Christian but
[11:28] there's boundaries about the thing the
[11:30] choices and the things that we can
[11:32] make that as we as we do things we
[11:35] realize I I shouldn't have done that
[11:36] that's your conscience speaking back
[11:38] what what is your conscience is your
[11:40] journey matters and there's these two
[11:41] views of of of of of uh of conscience
[11:45] that using big words here but really
[11:48] what it is there's just two views one is
[11:50] that the journey
[11:52] matters someone with a deontological
[11:55] focused conscience might feel a strong
[11:57] sense of Duty to follow certain moral Ru
[12:00] rules like always telling the truth now
[12:04] this is the I believe the Bible Way the
[12:06] Bible says always tell the truth don't
[12:09] ever steal don't lie just stay with what
[12:12] the Bible says and the other one is a
[12:15] consequentialist view which says I as
[12:18] long as I get my way that's the main
[12:21] thing it's focused on the
[12:24] outcome conscience in the Old Testament
[12:27] in Genesis 42:21 says Jose Brothers
[12:29] acknowledge their guilt for PR treating
[12:31] him saying we are verily guilty
[12:33] concerning our
[12:35] brother in 1st Samuel
[12:38] 245 you know there's two places where
[12:41] David Came Upon Saul and he had a chance
[12:43] to kill him and one place he took the
[12:46] water jug and he took the um U something
[12:49] else from him and he and he ran away and
[12:51] in the other place he had a chance to
[12:53] cut off a piece of his robe and it said
[12:56] now you think after all the things that
[12:58] Saul had done to David Saul had uh uh
[13:02] put him on the front lines you going to
[13:04] marry my daughter I'm going to put you
[13:05] on the front lines and and I'm going to
[13:06] try to kill you you got to bring me back
[13:09] aund
[13:11] uh proof that you killed 100 Philistines
[13:13] and and
[13:15] uh Saul Saul was just terrible to David
[13:19] but there Saul there in that little cave
[13:22] David had a chance to kill Saul but he
[13:25] withh withheld but but he did cut off a
[13:28] little bit of his robe
[13:29] but even that even that poked him in in
[13:34] his conscience he was like it says here
[13:36] in first Samuel 24:5 his heart smoted
[13:39] him indicating a sense of guilt and
[13:42] moral or moral discomfort now you read
[13:44] even you you heard even in that sermon
[13:46] that that brother R was just preaching
[13:47] brother R was saying don't don't do you
[13:50] got you got to watch your life that you
[13:51] don't do things that make you regret
[13:54] like he was he that little thing he did
[13:56] when he was a little kid uh against
[13:58] somebody
[13:59] against one of his his uh Little Buddies
[14:03] there you got to watch to to make sure
[14:06] that you have a pure conscience so that
[14:08] you have confidence with God so that
[14:10] your petition will be answered so that
[14:11] you have boldness with him in Proverbs
[14:14] 20:27 it says the spirit of man is the
[14:16] candle of the Lord searching all the
[14:20] inward parts of the
[14:23] belly in Romans 14:22 says hast thou
[14:27] Faith have it to thy self before
[14:30] God happy is he that condemneth not
[14:34] himself in that thing which he
[14:38] alloweth and he's qu talking about
[14:40] eating meat offered to idols and so
[14:42] forth he said he that douth is damned if
[14:43] he eat because he eateth not of faith
[14:46] for whatsoever is not of faith is sin so
[14:51] in other words listen to your conscience
[14:54] if your conscience is telling you that
[14:55] it's like we were using an example if
[14:57] your conscience is telling you that's
[14:58] wrong to put up a Christmas tree you
[15:00] don't put up a Christmas tree if your
[15:02] conscience is telling you that it's it's
[15:04] wrong to do something you stay as far
[15:06] away from that as you can because to do
[15:07] otherwise you're you're not listening to
[15:10] your
[15:11] heart and Daniel chapter 3 just another
[15:14] example you think about uh how it's the
[15:16] journey the journey that that really is
[15:18] the main thing and there they had an
[15:20] opportunity they were the whole other
[15:22] Nation the whole nation was we going to
[15:24] bow down to the prophet to the image of
[15:27] the Prophet but they because were
[15:29] listening to their conscience refused to
[15:31] bow
[15:32] down they said if not be it known unto
[15:35] thee Oh King that we will not serve thy
[15:37] Gods nor worship the golden image which
[15:39] thou has set up and they you know you're
[15:43] when you really feel strongly about
[15:45] something when when when something comes
[15:48] up before you you're like I I'm I'm
[15:50] standing with what I believe that's how
[15:53] these three Hebrew children were they
[15:54] they didn't know what was going to
[15:55] happen next but they were if I get
[15:57] thrown into the fire no no matter what
[15:59] happens I'm standing right with what I
[16:01] believe because I cannot violate my
[16:04] conscience I cannot go against it it's
[16:07] and there there it becomes it's your
[16:09] testimony because your conscience begins
[16:12] that that still Small Voice in your
[16:13] heart begins to guide you through your
[16:15] life to know how to do and how to act
[16:17] and how to how where to go where to go
[16:19] to church where how how to behave
[16:21] yourself at work it's guiding every
[16:24] aspect of your
[16:25] life that why Cliff Bible dictionary
[16:28] said conscience is an innate
[16:30] characteristic found universally in men
[16:32] that becomes active when one reaches the
[16:34] age of accountability when you can make
[16:36] a choice in Deuteronomy 1 139 it says
[16:39] the little ones that you said will be
[16:41] taken captive your children who do not
[16:43] yet know good from bad they will enter
[16:46] the
[16:47] land in Isaiah 7:16 before before the
[16:50] boy knows enough to reject the wrong and
[16:52] choose the right speaking of speaking of
[16:55] the Messiah before he gets old enough to
[16:57] know what's right and wrong the land of
[17:01] the two kings you dread will be laid
[17:03] waste talking about Syria and Judah so
[17:06] another words you you come to a place
[17:08] where you know what's wrong and right
[17:11] because God has given us a conscience to
[17:13] lead and guide us and to direct our
[17:16] paths you think about Daniel when they
[17:18] they made that declaration nobody can
[17:20] pray you can't make any prep uh any any
[17:24] any prayer any petition to anybody
[17:26] outside of the king but Daniel was he
[17:29] felt so strongly in his heart I cannot
[17:31] violate my conscience I'm not going to
[17:32] listen to man I I'm I'm staying right
[17:35] with what I believe I'm not deviating to
[17:38] the right or to the left and he threw
[17:40] open his windows and he and he got down
[17:41] on his knees and three times a day he
[17:43] began to pray because he was bound by
[17:46] his conscience and his conscience
[17:48] actually guided him into his testimony
[17:51] his testimony was I'm listening to
[17:54] God and Martin Luther we used that
[17:57] example last time that Martin Luther
[17:59] standing there in front of the Catholic
[18:00] church and he said I am Bound by the
[18:04] scriptures I have quoted and my
[18:06] conscience is captive to the word of God
[18:10] I cannot and will not recant anything
[18:13] since it is neither safe nor right to go
[18:17] against
[18:19] conscience in 1st Samuel 26 there's the
[18:22] other example of David coming into Saul
[18:25] uh that him and abishai abashi was his
[18:28] is uh standing there counseling him
[18:31] won't you go ahead and just kill Saul
[18:33] but David's response was my conscience
[18:36] won't let me now you think about that
[18:39] that that David God had told David that
[18:42] he was going to be king but he's like
[18:45] not like this and David said furthermore
[18:48] as the Lord liveth the Lord shall Smite
[18:50] him or his day shall come to die or he
[18:51] shall descend into battle and perish the
[18:54] Lord forbid that I should stretch forth
[18:56] my hand against the Lord's anointed but
[18:58] I pray thee take thou now the spear that
[19:01] is at his bolster and the cruise of
[19:03] water and let us go so there your
[19:07] conscience becomes your testimony right
[19:10] in 1 Peter 2:19-20 it says for this is
[19:12] thankworthy if a man for conscience
[19:16] toward God endure grief suffering
[19:19] wrongfully now if you got a real strong
[19:21] conscience it doesn't matter what
[19:23] befalls you in life doesn't matter what
[19:25] somebody does to you at work or maybe
[19:27] even at church sometimes but you're
[19:29] you're held captive to that that you
[19:31] cannot go against conscience if the word
[19:34] of God says that you can't lie or steal
[19:37] or you know act UNT or all the other
[19:40] requirements all the other standards
[19:42] that are laid out in the word then
[19:44] you're held captive to that and you
[19:46] cannot go against it for what glory is
[19:48] it if when you be buffeted for your
[19:50] faults you shall take it patiently but
[19:52] if when you do well and suffer for it
[19:54] you take it patiently this is acceptable
[19:57] with God and Hebrews 9:9 says which was
[20:00] a figure for the time present in which
[20:03] were offered both gifts and sacrifices
[20:05] that could not make him that did the
[20:07] service perfect as pertaining to the
[20:12] conscience that's what the word of God
[20:14] the effect that the word of God has on
[20:16] the believer's conscience their heart to
[20:18] make them be in subjection to the word
[20:22] and there was nothing under the law that
[20:24] could do that that could perfect
[20:26] you as free from guilt
[20:29] that could take away your guilt there
[20:32] now there's a there's a pure conscience
[20:34] a conscience that is free from guilt you
[20:37] know that Christ Jesus has taken all
[20:39] your guilt and shame on the cross and
[20:41] died and his blood has cleansed you
[20:43] because you believed in in what he did
[20:45] and you can come and and boldly take the
[20:48] communion because you're you're free
[20:51] from guilt and there's nothing between
[20:53] you and your savior and nothing between
[20:55] you and your brother and you're free
[20:58] there's a pure
[21:00] conscience our conscience was originally
[21:02] perverted in John 16:2 it says they
[21:05] shall put you out of the
[21:06] synagogues ye the time
[21:09] cometh that whosoever kth you will think
[21:12] that he doeth God's service now there's
[21:14] a perverted conscience somebody that
[21:16] thinks they're doing right but they're
[21:18] doing wrong what a that's a strange
[21:21] thing isn't it in Acts 26:9 even Paul
[21:24] himself said I thought with myself that
[21:27] I ought to do do many things contrary to
[21:29] the name of Jesus of Nazareth he was
[21:32] thinking that way he needed his
[21:34] conscience to be cleaned up and and
[21:36] purged in Titus 1:15 says unto the pure
[21:40] all things are pure but unto them that
[21:42] are defiled and unbelieving is nothing
[21:45] pure but even their mind and conscience
[21:49] is
[21:50] defiled but it can be
[21:52] clean and Hebrews 9:14 says how much
[21:56] more shall the blood of Christ be
[21:57] through the eternal Spirit offered
[21:59] himself without spot to God Purge your
[22:02] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[22:06] Living God and in 1 John 1:9 if we
[22:10] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[22:15] to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[22:18] cleanse us from all
[22:20] unrighteousness oh you ever felt that
[22:22] way when you when you get down and you
[22:24] just lay all your problems and all the
[22:26] things you've done wrong that day before
[22:28] the Lord and and you come up you feel
[22:29] you're cleaned out scoured out washed
[22:33] out and Psalm 199 says where with us
[22:36] shall a young man cleanse his way how
[22:39] you going to clean your way how can you
[22:40] have a clean
[22:42] conscience by taking heed there too
[22:46] according to Thy
[22:48] word and you take hold to God's word and
[22:52] that will purify your
[22:54] conscience we read all the scriptures
[22:56] last time where Jesus said sanctify them
[22:59] by Thy word Thy word is truth you want
[23:02] your conscience cleaned up Let the word
[23:04] get a hold of your life and get a hold
[23:05] of your heart it'll clean you up so you
[23:08] think about things differently so you
[23:09] begin to be bound like Martin Luther to
[23:13] the word that you begin to be bound like
[23:16] like David was to the word where you
[23:19] maybe you want to do something different
[23:21] but you're bound to the word and the
[23:23] word's got your life and it's what's
[23:26] guiding you in Matthew 5 232 24 it says
[23:30] therefore if thou bring thy gift to The
[23:32] Altar and there rememberest that thy
[23:35] brother hath ought against thee leave
[23:37] there thy gift before the altar so if
[23:39] you're bringing something before to God
[23:41] but you got something against your
[23:42] brother go make sure that your
[23:44] conscience is clear first and go thy way
[23:48] first be reconciled to the brother to
[23:50] thy brother and then come and offer thy
[23:52] gift and Acts 24:16 says herein do I
[23:56] exercise myself to have all always a
[23:59] conscience void of offense toward God
[24:02] and toward men now that's quite a
[24:04] statement isn't it that Paul always was
[24:06] working to have was trying to have a
[24:08] clear conscience toward God and toward
[24:11] men to not have any impediments with his
[24:14] anything that would prevent him from
[24:16] having full confidence in the calling of
[24:18] God in his life and what he was here to
[24:20] do and and and to be able to lay
[24:22] anything before God and have God respond
[24:24] to him because he wanted to have full
[24:27] confidence and Romans 12:2 says be not
[24:30] conformed to this world but be
[24:32] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[24:35] that you may prove what is that good and
[24:38] acceptable and perfect will of
[24:41] God so cultivate a pure conscience and
[24:45] we'll be closing here on on on this in
[24:48] Acts chap 24:16 if the musicians want to
[24:50] go ahead and come forward it says herein
[24:52] do I exercise myself we just read that
[24:55] to have always a conscience vo of
[24:57] offense and Romans 9:1 says I say the
[25:00] truth in Christ I lie not my conscience
[25:03] also bearing me witness in the Holy
[25:06] Ghost that your conscience is bearing
[25:08] witness and 2 Corinthians 1:12 says for
[25:12] our rejoicing is this the testimony of
[25:15] our conscience that in Simplicity and
[25:18] godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom
[25:22] but by the grace of God we have had our
[25:25] conversation in the world and more
[25:27] abundantly abundantly to you word and
[25:30] there's a scripture that says the
[25:32] testimony of our conscience that your
[25:34] conscience a clear conscience becomes a
[25:36] witness it becomes a witness to others
[25:38] and a witness to you that you can look
[25:40] back on and say well my conscience is
[25:43] clear and it becomes a testimony to you
[25:47] God bless you Saints
[25:51] [Applause]
