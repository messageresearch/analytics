[0:00] Those who take joy my

[0:12] hear. Make me a
[0:15] sweet
[0:17] sweet
[0:19] sound in your
[0:25] ear. Amen. God bless you. Happy to be
[0:29] here with you all again. Amen. Just pray
[0:32] the Lord bless it. The scriptures that
[0:35] I'm going to read this morning. I
[0:38] thought of it
[0:39] when after
[0:41] this little guy that
[0:44] uh left his gun out and killed
[0:47] his baby brother.
[0:50] and he went
[0:52] to court this past
[0:55] Monday and they gave him
[1:00] um 10 years
[1:03] probation. But I talk to him all the
[1:05] time praying with him, but I haven't
[1:08] heard a voice from
[1:10] him to say, "I thank you,
[1:13] Lord." And this scripture I read is kind
[1:17] of remind me of him. We're going to read
[1:20] from St.
[1:22] Luke
[1:24] 17 1- 21. Let us let us pray. Heavenly
[1:29] Father, we are grateful and thankful for
[1:31] this opportunity that you have given us
[1:33] to come together to worship. Father, we
[1:35] pray and thank you for all that you have
[1:37] done for us, Lord. How you let us be
[1:40] strong and continue on with love in our
[1:43] hearts for you and Lord for one another.
[1:46] We ask you Lord whatever we do God let
[1:48] us thank you for it and ask you to bless
[1:50] us and bless our hearts there be any
[1:53] sick among us this morning father take
[1:55] the sickness away if there be any lost
[1:57] Lord that need you to deliver them God
[2:00] we pray that you will in Jesus name we
[2:02] pray amen
[2:15] in St. Luke 17:20
[2:19] 11-21. And it came to pass as he went
[2:25] as he went to Jerusalem and passed
[2:27] through the midst of Samaria and
[2:29] Galilee.
[2:31] And as he entered into village, there
[2:37] came stood a far off. And they lift up
[2:41] their voices and said, "Jesus, master,
[2:44] have mercy on us."
[2:47] And when he saw them, he said unto them,
[2:50] "Go show yourselves unto the priests.
[2:53] And it came to pass that as they went,
[2:56] they were cleansed." And one of them
[2:59] when he saw that he was healed turned
[3:02] back and with a loud voice glorified
[3:06] God down his face and his
[3:10] feet and he was a Samaritan.
[3:14] And Jesus answered and said, "Were there
[3:16] not 10 cleansed? But where are the nine?
[3:22] They are not found that return to give
[3:24] glory to God. said this stranger.
[3:28] And he said unto him, arise, go thy way,
[3:33] thy faith has made beehole.
[3:37] And when he was commanded of the
[3:39] Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
[3:41] should come, he answered them and said,
[3:44] "The kingdom of God come not with
[3:47] observation."
[3:49] Neither shall they say lo here or lo
[3:53] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[3:57] within you. Amen. God bless you. May be
[4:00] seated. Amen.

[17:21] Words of
[17:22] life, words of
[17:25] hope, give us
[17:28] strength. Help us
[17:30] cope in this world where we roam. The
[17:36] word of God will guide us
[17:40] home. Word of
[17:43] God ever true.
[17:47] changing meaning and changing
[17:50] you. Oh, we have come with open hearts.
[17:56] Oh, let the word of God.
[18:02] Holy
[18:06] words handed
[18:08] down to this
[18:11] age came to us through
[18:15] sacrifice. Oh he the faithful words of
[18:21] Christ. Holy
[18:23] words long
[18:26] preserved for I
[18:28] walk in this world. Sing it to him. They
[18:33] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[18:37] the word of God. You going to get your
[18:40] portion today? Word of
[18:43] God ever
[18:45] true. It'll change
[18:47] me and change you. And we have come with
[18:54] holy hearts.
[18:56] The word of God is impart.
[19:02] Word of God is the most important thing
[19:03] we'll ever have. It'll sustain us. Man
[19:07] will fail
[19:09] you. I'll fail you. But the word of God
[19:12] will never fail you. It will always be
[19:15] the same. It's been the same for
[19:18] eternity. And it will not change. So we
[19:21] can put our faith in that. not a man
[19:24] that tells us three or four different
[19:25] interpretations of what the word says.
[19:27] We have the direct interpretation from
[19:30] God of what he actually was talking
[19:32] about. My what a what a hope. It's not a
[19:35] hope. It should make us be faithful
[19:38] in everything that we do that this
[19:40] message is correct.
[19:43] And that we are
[19:45] in that final voice for the final age.
[19:50] Amen. God bless you. Good to see you.
[19:52] Today we're going to have a um a time of
[19:55] graduation downstairs and a little party
[19:57] down there. Don't anybody leave. Um

[21:10] always. So good to have uh Sister Isel.
[21:15] Isel is Yeah, that's Yeah, brother
[21:19] Donado's daughter. Not that brother
[21:21] Donado. That's not Junior, but Senior's
[21:24] the one that preached for us a couple
[21:26] weeks ago. That's her his daughter
[21:28] there. So good to see them. Also good to
[21:30] see Daniel back. Where's Daniel at?
[21:32] Father D. He's back. Good to have you
[21:34] back, man.
[21:37] I'd come back from San Diego, too,
[21:39] wouldn't you? Especially at uh H Esther.
[21:42] That's what I
[21:46] said. Boy, y'all got hard hearing. Bless
[21:49] your heart. Okay, so that's what I
[21:52] heard. So
[21:53] anyway, but good to have you with us
[21:55] today, Sister Astra. And uh we sure
[21:58] appreciate your family and u wish you
[22:01] well while you're here. And then when
[22:02] you take off back home, tell them all we
[22:04] said hello. We sure do appreciate your
[22:06] mom and dad and your whole family. All
[22:08] these brothers scattered around here
[22:09] somewhere. We appreciate them, too. So,
[22:12] uh, let's turn our Bibles in the book of
[22:15] Romans. And we'll start today a little
[22:16] bit a little bit different. Not
[22:19] different, but maybe going a little um
[22:21] background a little bit and then going
[22:23] to a little bit of a uh something that
[22:26] we had skipped, but now I'm going to
[22:28] come back and bring it in.
[22:30] Just remember all these uh meetings
[22:33] coming up uh July I think we pretty much
[22:36] got everybody um situated for that
[22:39] weekend at brother uh Andre's. So um we
[22:43] are uh confident that uh we're going to
[22:46] have a good time. There's 68 people
[22:47] signed up to go. So there won't be
[22:49] hardly anybody here. So we're not going
[22:50] to have a service that weekend. It will
[22:52] be live streamed from there just like it
[22:55] was last year. All right. But um if you
[22:59] haven't signed up, you still got a
[23:00] little bit of time, but I think pretty
[23:01] much everybody signed up that's that's
[23:03] wanting to go. So uh and we have rooms
[23:05] for each one that has asked for them. So
[23:09] uh we will uh take care of that for you.
[23:12] Uh you get there and we'll take care of
[23:13] them. We'll have food there. Pretty much
[23:16] all the foods covered except for your
[23:18] Sunday meal after service. We usually go
[23:20] to a place called the Farmer's Daughter,
[23:22] which is a an Amish restaurant, and
[23:25] you'll have to uh you'll pay for that
[23:28] for yourself, but just like we did last
[23:30] year. So, let's bow our hands. I know we
[23:33] all have needs. We all come here today,
[23:34] so we got a need. Dear heavenly father,
[23:37] thank you for the blood of Jesus
[23:39] Christ. Thank you for the word of God.
[23:43] Thank you for sending us a prophet.
[23:45] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for so much
[23:48] that we are privileged to see. And now
[23:52] we're seeing prophecy unfold in front of
[23:54] our very eyes. It's not something in the
[23:57] future that that some prophet saw. We
[23:59] know that happen, but we're living the
[24:01] reality of it today. Father, I pray
[24:04] today, Lord, before we leave this
[24:05] building that something will strike our
[24:07] heart to dig deeper, to want more of
[24:10] you, to want more of this precious,
[24:13] bleeding word of God, and that we'll
[24:16] take it, Lord, and and it'll sustain us
[24:19] even when we go out, Lord, into the
[24:21] world and not do the things of the
[24:23] world, but we have to work and we have
[24:25] to do the different things, Lord. I pray
[24:27] that you would be with each one. Be with
[24:29] these new graduates, Lord, as they step
[24:31] out into a new era of their life, a new
[24:34] season, Lord, that if they want to
[24:36] further their education, that's
[24:37] wonderful. If not, Lord, I pray that
[24:39] they'll put you first and then ask for a
[24:42] job, Lord. And I believe, Lord, that
[24:44] you're faithful. If they're if we're
[24:47] faithful, you said you'd be faithful for
[24:48] us. Father, just be with each one.
[24:50] Forgive us of our sins and many
[24:51] mistakes. Bless the ones that are sick,
[24:53] ones that are not here. Lord, I pray
[24:55] that you'd give them a touch in Jesus
[24:57] name we pray. Amen. Remember Sister
[25:00] Regina, she's recovering good. So, she's
[25:02] watching in, I'm sure. So, Romans 8:15,
[25:06] for you have not received the spirit of
[25:07] bondage again to fear, but you have
[25:09] received the spirit of adoption. That's
[25:11] what we'll be talking about. We're
[25:12] talking about adoption time. All right.
[25:14] But you have received the spirit of
[25:16] adoption whereby we cry aba father. What
[25:20] is the spirit of adoption? We'll talk
[25:22] about that but a little bit. The spirit
[25:24] of adoption is growth.
[25:26] The whole spirit of adoption is is
[25:28] you're in the family now. We're going to
[25:30] grow. All right. So, that's the spirit
[25:33] of adoption. If you have the spirit of
[25:34] the devil in you, you can't be adopted
[25:36] by God.
[25:38] Everybody with me? All right. Brother,
[25:40] brother Dale said many, many times, God
[25:42] does not adopt the devil's kids. Okay?
[25:45] He adopts his own children. But there is
[25:48] a method and a way to do that whereby we
[25:51] cry aba father the spirit itself
[25:54] witnessing with our spirit that we are
[25:57] the children of god not we're going to
[25:59] be but we are the children of god and if
[26:01] children then hes of god and joint hes
[26:04] with
[26:06] Christ everything he gets we get. He
[26:09] went on the mountain he got adopted we
[26:11] go on our own mountain and we get
[26:12] adopted. All right. God puts us in a
[26:14] place, puts us up on a not a pedestal,
[26:16] but he puts us up on a place that it's
[26:19] not that we know more than you. It's not
[26:21] that the person that's going to get it.
[26:22] No, when you get to that spot, then
[26:24] you're more humble than you've ever been
[26:26] in your whole life. Okay. Brother Brown
[26:29] said one time Jesus went on the top of
[26:32] the mountain, got the adopted, and six
[26:34] months later he was in he was at on
[26:35] Calvary. So, it's really not going to be
[26:37] a um as we were talking Wednesday night,
[26:40] it's going to be a separation time. It's
[26:43] going to be uniting for the bride, but a
[26:44] separation time even from maybe your own
[26:46] friends.
[26:48] Amen. If so be that we suffer with him,
[26:51] what we've been on, that we may be also
[26:54] glorified together. You may be seated in
[26:57] Lord of the blessings of the reading of
[26:58] the word. And that we may be glorified
[27:01] together. For now, here's Paul's
[27:02] summation. For I reckon that the
[27:04] sufferings of this present
[27:07] time, everybody's going through a season
[27:09] of time. Everybody's going through some
[27:11] kind of issue sitting in the building
[27:13] today. We're going through a period of
[27:15] time that maybe was different than
[27:16] before. But as I said before, the
[27:20] tragedy that happens in your life will
[27:22] define who you are. It will build your
[27:24] faith. It will never destroy you if
[27:26] you're a child of God. How many of you
[27:28] today want to have ill will against all
[27:31] these graduates, especially the ones or
[27:34] of your own children? You don't want to
[27:36] have ill will. You want to give them
[27:37] everything they need to get started
[27:40] right with. So God wants to give
[27:43] everything he's got. And he's perfect.
[27:46] So what he gives, he don't have to say,
[27:48] "Well, now we can do the same thing. We
[27:50] can say, well, man, I wish you were, you
[27:52] know, the kids would do this." You try
[27:53] to push him over this way and and boy,
[27:55] don't we mess up sometimes. Oh yeah. I
[27:58] mean, we mess up sometimes. So God
[28:00] doesn't mess up. When he's nudging you
[28:02] or pulling you into one direction, you
[28:05] need to what? Yield yourself to that and
[28:07] let him pull you on in into what?
[28:10] Himself. All right. For I reckon that
[28:12] the sufferings of this present time,
[28:14] that's why I'm got it written. Present
[28:16] time, it's not you're going to suffer
[28:18] your whole life.
[28:20] Come on. What's suffering? As we've been
[28:22] talking about, we've never suffered like
[28:23] Job. We've never suffered like Isaiah.
[28:26] We've never suffered like the twel
[28:28] apostles. We've never suffered like
[28:30] that. But we have our own suffering.
[28:34] See, even when you get born again,
[28:36] there's a suffering. As we were talking
[28:37] the other day, there's a there's a a
[28:40] separation time where where your
[28:41] friends, if they're not born again,
[28:43] they're not going to understand you, and
[28:45] you're not going to want to be in their
[28:46] circle anymore. They don't understand
[28:48] why, but you what? There's a separation
[28:50] there. All right. When you come on up to
[28:56] adoption again, when we come up to the
[28:59] opening of the seventh seal, when that
[29:01] seventh seal opens, what did brother
[29:03] Brandham tell us? He said, "Hundreds of
[29:07] my friends will leave me." Because they
[29:10] all had the idea of the of the Jews.
[29:12] That wasn't the Jews under the altar.
[29:14] That was the Christian ones. Like
[29:15] brother Ram said, same thing. He said
[29:17] the same thing. Come on. And that the
[29:19] white horse rider was the Holy Ghost and
[29:21] all these different things. But when
[29:22] when the seals opened and all that got
[29:25] pushed away, then he lost a group of
[29:27] people. He lost another group of people
[29:29] when he continued on to being and
[29:31] preaching that the seventh seal was the
[29:34] experience that he had. Amen. That's
[29:37] what that seventh seal is. It's your
[29:38] experience with God and God putting you
[29:41] on display. So if he's going to put us
[29:43] on display at that time, we're going to
[29:45] lose even more friends. We're going to
[29:47] be misunderstood by more people.
[29:49] Everybody with me? Not everybody's going
[29:51] to see the opening of the seals. Yes,
[29:53] they did open in 1963. But if you
[29:55] haven't come to a place of adoption
[29:57] where God cuz remember that seventh seal
[29:59] is who? It's Christ. Seventh seal is
[30:02] Christ on the earth in a group of people
[30:05] having headship.
[30:08] Having complete Christ the mission of
[30:10] God reveal complete preeminence in a
[30:13] group of people. Amen.
[30:16] There's your power. Amen. But without
[30:19] character is satanic. I'm going to read
[30:22] a quote here in just a little bit.
[30:23] Brother Bob was reading a scripture
[30:25] about stumbling block.
[30:27] Brother Brown told us he said a even a
[30:30] Christian without these virtues working
[30:33] in their life is a stumbling block or a
[30:36] stumble block. He said took me a long
[30:37] time to find that one in the quotes
[30:39] because he didn't say stumbling block.
[30:41] He said stumble block. And if you don't
[30:43] do it correctly then you got to it takes
[30:44] you a while to find it. But he did say
[30:46] what? You're a stumbling block to the
[30:48] world. You're even a stumbling block to
[30:50] believers.
[30:53] I don't understand why some of you do
[30:54] what you do. You don't understand why I
[30:56] do what things that I do. You got to you
[30:59] got to take that individual person and
[31:02] person by
[31:03] person. Look at each one. You got to
[31:05] look at yourself. You got to examine
[31:07] yourself. Quit examining brother Carlos.
[31:12] He got it now. You have to wait a second
[31:14] when you get the interpretation
[31:16] here. He was on my roof yesterday um
[31:20] pressure washing my roof and he looked
[31:22] like somebody from Arabia. He had all
[31:24] kind of stuff hanging down to get the
[31:25] keep the sun off of him. So, but we
[31:28] appreciate you doing that. But, but
[31:29] we're all
[31:30] individuals. We all go through our own
[31:32] time. We all go through our own We have
[31:34] our own purpose. Now, you got to find
[31:36] that though in the journey that you're
[31:38] taking. You got to find what your
[31:41] purpose is. Right. Right. Well, I don't
[31:44] know what my See, like high school
[31:46] graduates in some college, you're asking
[31:48] yourself maybe the same thing. I'm going
[31:50] to read you some some scripture here at
[31:52] the very end to admonish the graduate to
[31:55] do the right thing. Put God first,
[31:58] though. If you don't put God first, you
[32:01] will never ever You might think you're
[32:04] successful here. Listen, the rich young
[32:06] ruler thought he was successful up to a
[32:08] point. Right.
[32:10] He told Jesus himself, "I've done all
[32:13] that." But there was one thing he
[32:15] lacked.
[32:17] And we'll look at a little bit later.
[32:18] It's not part of this, but it is part
[32:20] throwing in here that that we do have to
[32:23] even as we graduate from justification
[32:26] to sanctification. And then we graduate
[32:28] through the virtues and all the way up
[32:30] and then the what is the total
[32:31] graduation is? Is we get our degree and
[32:35] it's not in theology, it's in neology.
[32:37] Yeah. Amen. We get our we the more we
[32:40] brother said what the greater man gets,
[32:42] the more he gets on his knees.
[32:45] The way up is what? Down.
[32:48] So everybody remember that. We all need
[32:50] to remember that. That's why we get
[32:51] caught up. That's why I was thinking the
[32:52] other day this world is caught up with
[32:56] what can I
[32:59] accomplish? Because now it means more
[33:02] money. It means more
[33:05] stuff. It means more
[33:08] prestige. It means more more likes on
[33:11] Facebook.
[33:15] Come on. Right. This is trending. Why is
[33:19] this trending? Cuz it's what the world
[33:22] wants to know.
[33:24] What are we trending? If we had a faith
[33:27] book, would our faith book show that
[33:29] we're trending toward Jesus Christ or
[33:30] we're trending or we're letting the
[33:31] world in?
[33:34] You better think about that.
[33:36] Are you reading your Bible more than you
[33:37] are your Facebook?
[33:43] I think some of you cannot answer that.
[33:46] And I'm not going to ask cuz it'll
[33:47] embarrass you.
[33:49] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[33:51] present time are not worthy to be
[33:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[33:54] revealed in us. So look, you and I,
[33:56] whatever, whatever effort you're putting
[33:58] in, it's going to be made known. We are
[34:02] going to manifest what we are inside. We
[34:05] may sit today and be a peacock. I mean a
[34:08] um a a blackbird and we got peacock
[34:11] feathers stuffed in us, but there's
[34:13] going to be a time when you're going to
[34:15] have to display who you are inside. And
[34:18] listen, if it's to be revealed in us,
[34:20] then listen, the discernment has to come
[34:23] from
[34:24] here. It won't come from the Baptist.
[34:27] What are they discerning? He's three.
[34:30] Baptism. He's this. He's that. You and I
[34:34] have the perfect word of God to go by.
[34:37] When we open that Bible, we have
[34:39] confidence that that's what God said.
[34:42] Amen. Not that's what he meant, but
[34:45] that's what he said. Now listen, he may
[34:47] not verbatim say it cuz that's a
[34:49] revelation. He said, "I thank you,
[34:51] Father, that you've hid this." Why
[34:54] didn't Jesus say it? Why didn't Jesus
[34:56] just not say parables and just tell them
[34:58] exactly what to He was hiding it. Right.
[35:02] But he said, "Remember, the mysteries
[35:04] are are held for you to understand."
[35:06] Yes. You're the only people that will
[35:09] understand the kingdom of God. Amen.
[35:11] Because remember that kingdom is come.
[35:14] It's not coming that over there. It's
[35:16] coming this here.
[35:19] Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in
[35:22] earth as it is in heaven. So this glory
[35:25] is going to be re revealed in us after
[35:27] we go through our time of whatever you
[35:30] want to say suffering. Some people's
[35:32] suffering are different than other
[35:33] people's suffering. Amen. Some
[35:36] sufferings you don't need a meal. It
[35:39] shows. You can laugh if you want to.
[35:43] But we manifest what we are and who we
[35:44] are. I mean come on. We do.
[35:48] You know you're not you're not going to
[35:49] see me um eating uh what is it? Josh,
[35:53] where Josh
[36:00] Hummus stomach intros? Where's Where's
[36:03] Where's sister? We were at brother
[36:05] Anderson's house one time and we had
[36:08] some goat belly there and I I said,
[36:10] "There's a way more around on the
[36:11] outside of that goat that I can eat
[36:13] besides getting to eat on what's on the
[36:15] inside." But see, that's my revelation.
[36:18] Your revelation may be different than
[36:19] that, but my revelation is let's stay on
[36:22] the outside. Don't worry about the
[36:25] inside. So, we have a promise though in
[36:28] Ephesians. Now, what was Ephesians?
[36:30] Ephesians, brother Ram said, Ephesians
[36:32] parallels Joshua. And Ephesians was
[36:35] what? A setting of order. It was a it
[36:38] was the showing the Ephesian church was
[36:39] the strongest church there was. Paul
[36:41] could talk about all kind of doctrine
[36:43] and they didn't get all hung up like
[36:44] Corinthians. Every time that he every
[36:46] time he'd send a letter to the
[36:47] Corinthians, there'd be something
[36:49] happened. He'd send him another, there'd
[36:50] be something happen. He'd send him
[36:52] another, there'd be something happen.
[36:53] First Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, he
[36:55] kept writing letters and telling them,
[36:57] "You're doing this wrong." But the
[36:58] Ephesian church, he set everything in
[37:00] order. So, let's read this right here.
[37:03] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[37:04] Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[37:06] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[37:08] places in Christ. Now remember that's
[37:10] the believer's position according as he
[37:13] has chosen us in
[37:16] him. Us in him. As I said Wednesday
[37:20] night, you couldn't find me in him
[37:22] before the world began. I was there. You
[37:25] were there. Every born again believer
[37:27] was there in the DNA of God. Amen. But
[37:31] you couldn't pull me out as a little
[37:33] soul and say, "I'm running around in
[37:35] heaven and I knew you." No, you didn't
[37:37] know me. I didn't know you. Amen.
[37:39] Listen, you didn't know God till you got
[37:40] born again.
[37:42] You didn't know God till that peace that
[37:44] he had, that peace, that part, that word
[37:46] of God that he was came and dwelt in
[37:48] your soul. You didn't understand God.
[37:51] That's the only way you can understand
[37:53] God. But according he has chosen us in
[37:56] him before the foundation of the world.
[37:58] That look that we should be holy and
[38:00] without blame before him in love. Now
[38:03] watch this journey. according as he hath
[38:05] chosen us in him. We know why he chose
[38:07] us and how he chose us. Right? Everybody
[38:10] with me? He chose us by fornowledge. Cuz
[38:13] every person that came out of the
[38:17] womb, every person that comes out of the
[38:20] womb of a woman is and has a choice.
[38:28] It's a free moral agency or a free will
[38:33] to decide what you want to do and what
[38:35] you don't want to do. And listen, God's
[38:37] not going to cross that line.
[38:40] Now, God's purpose will always happen,
[38:43] but God's purpose is he saw what he had
[38:45] to do before the foundation of the world
[38:46] to get you here, to get you somewhere to
[38:49] cross paths with the word of God. Amen.
[38:52] All right. So it didn't it didn't that
[38:53] God God just said, "Well, he's got free
[38:54] will. I'm just going to go sit up here
[38:56] and let him do what you want to do." No.
[38:57] Listen, his hand is in everything.
[38:59] That's right. Like I said before, his
[39:01] nos are the best yeses you'll ever get.
[39:04] If God says no, or if a door shuts here,
[39:06] if you're a Christian, if one door
[39:07] shuts, one's going to open. How many of
[39:09] you sitting in this building that's
[39:10] happened to? Brother Boy, I know with
[39:13] experience with him, you sit there and
[39:15] you go, I don't know what in the world
[39:17] I'm going to do next.
[39:20] That's the way I wanted to go.
[39:23] That's the way I felt led to go. Well,
[39:24] you might have led yourself.
[39:27] But what did God do? He give you
[39:28] something better. Didn't he not always
[39:30] give you something better? If he didn't
[39:32] give you something better, then you
[39:33] remember you got to go back to put him
[39:35] first.
[39:36] Everybody with me? That's why I said
[39:38] before, if you got a if you got a job,
[39:41] but you have to work on Sunday. I'm
[39:43] sorry. God didn't give you that job. You
[39:46] say, "Well, I can't survive." You ain't
[39:48] trusting in God. Amen. That's right.
[39:51] Right. If God gives you a job, he will
[39:54] give you a job to work around your
[39:56] church time. If not, then he's what?
[39:58] He's wrong and he's not wrong.
[40:01] Maybe you got caught up in it.
[40:05] Come on. We had a brother in another
[40:06] church long time ago. He said God spoke
[40:08] to him and told him,
[40:12] right? Some of you do what I'm talking
[40:14] about.
[40:15] for him to work overtime on Sunday so he
[40:18] can send the money to the missionary
[40:21] field.
[40:23] That brother wound up having all kind of
[40:25] health
[40:27] issues. He stopped couldn't didn't go to
[40:29] church on Sunday, so he backslid.
[40:34] Now, was God in any of that?
[40:36] God was in one
[40:38] thing standing at the very end of it
[40:40] saying, "I told you not to do that and
[40:43] you did it anyway."
[40:45] It sounded good. Did it not sound good?
[40:47] Oh, I'm going to take it. I'm going to
[40:48] make three times on Sunday what I make
[40:50] usually and I'm going to take every bit
[40:51] of that and give it to missionary. That
[40:53] sounded good. But it wasn't the will of
[40:55] God. It wasn't the purpose of God and it
[40:57] was not in the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[41:00] But we'll talk about that later on with
[41:02] the with the u graduation.
[41:06] Because let me give you a little pointer
[41:09] here and I'll read we've read this quote
[41:12] many many times. I got it right here in
[41:13] front of me in questions and answers.
[41:14] Brother Bram said if you if you're
[41:16] planning on getting planning to get
[41:17] married, get married. If you're planning
[41:20] on planting potatoes, plant potatoes.
[41:22] You can't decide that tomorrow the
[41:24] rapture is going to take place.
[41:27] But if you don't put God first, you may
[41:30] stay here after the rapture takes place.
[41:33] Right? But if you put God first,
[41:36] seek ye first the kingdom of God. Amen.
[41:39] Children, take everything. Young adults
[41:41] now, not children, take it and lay that
[41:44] thing out. But put G O D. Put God first.
[41:49] God first. And then what's going to
[41:52] happen? You know what? If you're a child
[41:53] of God, like like I said, if you're a
[41:55] child of God, he's got his hand on you
[41:56] already. Amen. You may not know he's got
[41:59] his hand on you, but he's got his hand
[42:01] on you,
[42:03] helping you,
[42:05] through life. Listen, folks, when I was
[42:06] growing up, and no, no disrespect to
[42:08] anybody in the message, but when we were
[42:10] growing up, it was nothing but dos and
[42:12] don'ts. It was I'm sorry.
[42:18] And I didn't know what I mean, that was
[42:19] nothing for the youth. You youth, you've
[42:21] got all kind of things to to uh to
[42:24] support you with. Can I get an amen?
[42:26] Amen. To support you with if you'll take
[42:30] it. But we just got thrown out in the
[42:32] world. And I'm sorry. It just became our
[42:34] time that that when we got finished with
[42:36] with our 18year-old or got finished
[42:39] eating out of under mom and daddy's
[42:40] table, we left.
[42:44] Cuz daddy told me, he said, "As long as
[42:46] you eat under you put your legs under my
[42:48] table, you're going to do what I ask you
[42:49] to do." That's right. You going to
[42:51] church. And we did until my legs got out
[42:54] from under his table. But I had a hard
[42:59] life because of that.
[43:02] A hard life because of that. And for
[43:05] those of you that don't that that are
[43:07] getting started, listen to try one time.
[43:10] My kids asked me one
[43:12] time, they said,
[43:16] "Dad, why can't we do what we want
[43:20] to?" Josh ain't in the building, so he
[43:22] Oh, he's right there. He's okay. What
[43:24] can we what why do we have to do what
[43:26] you
[43:28] say? I said,
[43:31] "Okay, this is a
[43:35] house. It's my
[43:37] house." I said, "But now if you want me
[43:39] to transfer it over into your name, but
[43:41] oh, you got to make the
[43:44] mortgage." Oh. Oh, and I need a pair of
[43:46] tennis shoes about every two months. Uh,
[43:49] you're going to have to give that to me.
[43:51] Um, I want something to eat. I don't
[43:53] want no cereal ramen noodles.
[43:56] Praise the Lord.
[43:59] Right. Come on, girls.
[44:03] If you can, I said if you Oh, light
[44:05] bills do.
[44:07] Phone bill's due. I Josh, I need gas in
[44:11] my car today.
[44:14] If you can do all that, you can do
[44:16] whatever you want to because it becomes
[44:18] your house then, right? I said, "But as
[44:20] long as you in my house and I'm paying
[44:21] the bills and I'm buying you something
[44:23] beside ramen noodles and and I and water
[44:26] to drink, then you going to do what I
[44:28] ask you to do." But now, you know what?
[44:30] God's a good God. But God told us that
[44:32] what? Amen. He said, "This is my house."
[44:37] This is my house. This is this is God's
[44:40] domain right here. Yes, sir. And that
[44:42] domain has decid he has decided to make
[44:44] that domain inside of me and you. Yes,
[44:46] sir. Amen. So this is the house of God.
[44:49] We can't do what we want to do. You
[44:51] know, that's what I said about suffering
[44:53] just for a minute here. Suffering to
[44:55] suffer to rain is not having to be, you
[44:59] know, they're not going to pull your
[45:00] nails out. They're not going to stick,
[45:02] you know, nails through your eyes or,
[45:05] you know, that
[45:07] suffering. Right. But when you go to the
[45:10] store, you don't go over in the aisle
[45:14] that's three sizes smaller than you're
[45:16] supposed to have on.
[45:21] I hope that sinks in. There's two aisles
[45:24] I've never been down in my
[45:26] life. Well, well, no. Small and
[45:30] medium. Never. I don't even know where
[45:31] they're at. I know where the large and
[45:34] extra large is. And there's there's a
[45:36] few two X's. I've been down that aisle.
[45:40] Is everybody with me?
[45:42] But when you're when
[45:46] you're anyway, when you're the head of
[45:49] the household, listen, you got to watch
[45:52] your clothes. Watch your kids. Remember,
[45:55] you're their Holy Ghost until they get
[45:57] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[46:00] So wives you or sisters, you say, "Well,
[46:03] I could Jim sometimes she'll get her
[46:05] hair and she'll get it all fixed up and
[46:07] and it'll fall over on this side. It
[46:10] fall over on this side." That's
[46:12] suffering to me. I mean, we just cut our
[46:15] hair and go on.
[46:17] But sisters have to take time
[46:21] to get their yourself at least
[46:22] presentable. Well, to me, that's
[46:24] suffering because what does the world
[46:26] do? They open up the Max Factor cabinet.
[46:30] I got a bump or two or three right here.
[46:33] Young teenagers. I just think I'll cover
[46:35] it up a little bit. Now, who told you to
[46:37] do that?
[46:40] That's putting on makeup.
[46:43] That's putting on
[46:44] makeup. But I'd rather see a sister walk
[46:47] in here and sit down that's got bumps
[46:48] all over her face and be a Christian
[46:50] than to try to hide it
[46:53] with pottery. PL. That's all that stuff
[46:56] is is just
[46:58] pottery. You smile and it just cracks.
[47:02] And you've seen that, Brother John. I
[47:03] know we've seen it. You looked at the
[47:05] girls and you go, "How'd you get out of
[47:06] the house like
[47:08] that?" That's the same thing with you
[47:10] brothers and sisters here. I want you to
[47:12] look at your kids and look at your
[47:14] family when they walk out that door. And
[47:16] if they don't look presentable, you turn
[47:18] them around and send them back in the
[47:19] house. Everybody with me? Amen.
[47:23] The shape of a woman is only to be seen
[47:26] by her husband, not by the world. That's
[47:28] right. Everybody with me? You say,
[47:30] "You're getting you're getting
[47:31] legalistic."
[47:32] Well, I'm trying to save your soul.
[47:36] We can talk about seals and vows and
[47:37] plagues, but Brother Brown said, "How am
[47:40] I going to teach them algebra if they
[47:42] can't put the right dress on or can't do
[47:44] the right thing?" Amen. All of us, we we
[47:47] all got things that we need to sharpen
[47:49] our sharpen our sword on.
[47:53] Hallelujah. Jun Jun will ask me, she'll
[47:56] say, "Hey, does this look good? This
[47:58] look
[47:59] presentable?" And I have had to tell
[48:02] her, "Probably need to put some on up
[48:04] here." Right? She don't mind telling
[48:06] you, "Put some on here." She'll sew
[48:09] something in. Well, see, to me, that's
[48:11] you're suffering for for the cause of
[48:13] Jesus Christ. The world just wears off.
[48:15] You drive by drive by all these drive by
[48:18] drive by all these Methodist fab. We
[48:20] just drove by one a little bit ago down
[48:22] on Caroline Road. Woman came out of the
[48:25] sanctuary with pair of blue jeans on and
[48:27] they were turned up in the at the
[48:29] bottom. You know, like pedal pushers or
[48:32] whatever you might call it. That's the
[48:33] way she went to church. Right. Now, God
[48:36] don't like that. Right. Right. You say
[48:39] you're getting Well, I'm going to be a
[48:40] little bit legalist cuz some of you
[48:42] people in this church right now sitting
[48:43] here today, you need to put on a dress
[48:45] about three sizes larger than the ones
[48:48] you got on. Now, listen. I told June, I
[48:50] said, "Look, you put this, you've been
[48:52] putting my pants too long, too long.
[48:55] You've been putting them in the dryer
[48:56] cuz they're
[49:01] shrinking." And you know what my sweet
[49:03] wife will say, right? I haven't even put
[49:06] them in the dryer one
[49:08] time. She's just a good
[49:13] cook. But we want to clean. We want to
[49:16] be a clean. We want to have our clean
[49:17] mind. We want to have a clean heart.
[49:19] When we come to church, we ought to be
[49:22] able to sit and worship God and not have
[49:24] to worry about that devil anyway.
[49:28] So, let's grow up with God. Clean oursel
[49:30] up.
[49:33] Hallelujah. cuz he's going to have a
[49:35] bride without spot or wrinkle. All
[49:38] right. Amen.
[49:40] And the suffering of this time.
[49:41] Sometimes we have to suffer through
[49:43] those things. Those
[49:45] things. And And I always go back to a
[49:48] lot of you don't know sister Cindy,
[49:50] which is your cousin, right? Brother
[49:52] Donny's cousin. Um, you know, brother
[49:54] Dad. Brother Dad. He was my daddy, so I
[49:57] can call him brother Dad.
[49:59] Brother Dell, you know, you sometimes
[50:02] you wonder, did he even have eyes to
[50:04] see? No. You know what he had eyes of?
[50:06] He had eyes of grace.
[50:09] He had eyes of grace. Cuz Cindy would
[50:11] come in, she's had all black on, black
[50:14] lipstick, black lips, black that, black
[50:17] hair, black pants. And she sat right
[50:20] there where Janine sitting, right behind
[50:21] where brother Collie's at. She sat right
[50:23] there. She come in and kept sitting
[50:25] right there. She come in, kept sitting
[50:26] right there. About a month later, she
[50:28] asked you, didn't she? She said, "Where
[50:30] can I get a
[50:32] dress?" Well, Brother Dale hadn't been
[50:34] sitting there going, "Now, bless
[50:36] God. I ain't talking about you, but
[50:42] she
[50:44] asked and then the lipstick come off,
[50:47] then the earrings come out."
[50:50] I'd rather see somebody come in like
[50:51] that,
[50:53] folks, that it takes a little bit of
[50:55] time to get a revelation, not a do and
[50:58] don't, but to get a revelation because
[51:02] you know what? If you, this is this is
[51:04] what I'm telling you. If you sisters
[51:05] that was in the church at that time,
[51:06] some of you were not. Some of you
[51:08] sisters that was in the church at that
[51:09] time, if you come in with the same thing
[51:10] she had on all the time, she'd feel
[51:12] comfortable,
[51:14] right? But she didn't feel comfortable
[51:16] because everybody wore a dress and
[51:18] nobody wore makeup and nobody had on
[51:20] earrings. So, so she was she conformed
[51:23] to the spirit that you emanate.
[51:27] Every one of us has got a spirit
[51:30] and it emanates from us and it may not
[51:32] be holy sometimes. Everybody with me?
[51:35] Amen.
[51:37] I didn't know you had to do this being a
[51:38] pastor, but sometimes it hurts me too.
[51:40] But but but
[51:43] Cindy wore dresses. She quit dying her
[51:46] hair.
[51:48] That was how much she come up here one
[51:50] day and she said, "I want the Holy
[51:51] Ghost." Now, daddy didn't say, "Well,
[51:54] now bless God. Quit cutting your hair.
[51:55] Go back there and sit down
[51:58] and and and get you a
[52:00] dress, right?" No. He prayed for her to
[52:04] get the Holy Ghost. And I believe in her
[52:06] simple way, she got it. Right. She's not
[52:10] a scholar. She's not a Sunday school
[52:12] teacher. But I believe she's a born
[52:14] again Christian because her life totally
[52:16] transformed right here in front of all
[52:18] of us that were here.
[52:21] And she didn't get preached on every
[52:22] service.
[52:24] Right. According as he has chosen us in
[52:27] I'm never going to get anywhere. Before
[52:29] the foundation of the world that we
[52:30] should be well, here we go. That we
[52:32] should be what? Holy and without blame
[52:35] before him in love. That's right. Having
[52:38] predestinated or listen, having
[52:40] predetermined, come on, listen to
[52:43] me, what we're going to be
[52:47] when we get here and live our life
[52:50] because
[52:52] predetermined is your destination is
[52:56] determined beforehand. And that what's
[52:57] predestination mean? You're pre you're
[52:59] predestined to do this. But it's not
[53:02] because God stamped it to happen. God
[53:06] didn't pull you through a tube and say
[53:07] this is the way you're going to act.
[53:10] Everybody with me? But by his
[53:12] fornowledge, he knew what when when you
[53:15] would come up to a situation or or even
[53:17] now some of you that are sitting here
[53:18] that I am talking about today, if you
[53:20] don't change your dress style, then you
[53:22] didn't get the Holy Ghost for one. I'm
[53:24] sorry. You need the Holy Ghost to change
[53:27] you.
[53:29] Amen.
[53:31] Having predestinated us and unto what?
[53:34] So, we're all predetermined to come to
[53:36] adoption,
[53:40] but not everybody gets it,
[53:44] cuz it's tough,
[53:48] right? Power without character is
[53:52] satanic. Listen, we have the most
[53:54] powerful message on the face of this
[53:56] earth today. It has
[53:59] bodychanging virtue in it.
[54:02] No one else has that. It has body
[54:05] changing virtue in it. Amen.
[54:10] So when we come to this
[54:14] place that we're adoption of children by
[54:18] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[54:21] good pleasure of his will. And what is
[54:22] his will? His will is his word. All
[54:25] right. To the praise of the glory of his
[54:28] grace. So you got to put grace in there
[54:31] wherein he hath made us accepted in
[54:34] Jesus Christ. May I not may I
[54:37] interpolate? That's who the beloved is.
[54:40] That we may be accepted in Jesus
[54:44] Christ. All right, everybody with me?
[54:47] Now this is a quote and I'll read I'm
[54:48] gonna read it again. Unless we suffer
[54:50] with him, we cannot reign with him. We
[54:52] have to suffer to reign. Amen. Amen. The
[54:56] reason for this is that character simply
[54:58] never is made without suffering.
[55:01] Character is a victory, not a gift.
[55:06] A man without character can't reign.
[55:08] Well, what you got to reign over first?
[55:10] Yourself.
[55:13] Oh, now brother Bob, if he'll get his
[55:15] self straight, then I probably
[55:17] would. Monica says, but anyway, praise
[55:21] the Lord.
[55:24] No, I got to worry about my character
[55:27] and the power that goes behind my
[55:29] character and the power goes behind your
[55:32] character because adoption is placing
[55:34] it's putting you somewhere where you
[55:36] need to be.
[55:39] Amen.
[55:41] And listen folks, God foresaw that that
[55:44] would be your place
[55:50] and he can't change his mind.
[55:52] So he foresaw you at a place
[55:56] and that was the place that you were the
[55:58] most happy. Hallelujah. That was the
[56:00] place where he could talk to you more
[56:03] than he did when you were in another
[56:05] place.
[56:08] Amen. A man without character or a
[56:10] sister. Now we got to put the sisters in
[56:12] here too. A man without character cuz
[56:15] you know why the sisters can look at us.
[56:16] Sure. We're supposed to give. We're
[56:17] we're responsible for you. We know that.
[56:20] Why? because we're the head and you're
[56:22] the you're the
[56:24] body. But you still have to come you
[56:26] have to have your own character. You
[56:29] can't say I'm going to heaven because of
[56:30] my husband's character.
[56:34] Well, if my husband get in line, I would
[56:38] foolish. Amen. Foolish
[56:42] characters of victory. I mean, listen,
[56:44] how many of y'all have had victories in
[56:45] your life? I know you have. You come to
[56:47] church today. Remember how many demons
[56:48] you already destroyed since you walked
[56:50] in this door. I don't want to come
[56:52] demon. I don't like my pastor demon. I
[56:54] don't
[56:57] I don't like Sunday school teacher
[56:58] either.
[57:00] Demon, we conquered all those just to
[57:03] get here
[57:05] today. So a man without character can't
[57:07] reign because power apart from character
[57:10] is
[57:11] satanic. But power with character is fit
[57:15] to rule. Rule what? rule this first.
[57:19] Amen. And since he wants us to share
[57:21] even his throne on the same basis that
[57:24] he
[57:25] overcome and is sit down in on in his
[57:28] father's throne in not on in. Amen. Then
[57:31] we have to overcome to sit with him.
[57:34] Yes. All right. So So if you want to sit
[57:37] with Jesus Christ, do what? Overcome.
[57:40] He that overcometh. Every age had to
[57:42] overcome something and they did because
[57:45] God wouldn't have put it in the Bible.
[57:47] He that overcometh will get this. So you
[57:50] and I our overcoming is is we get this
[57:52] right here. We get to sit what in
[57:54] authority
[57:56] on the throne with in the throne with
[57:58] him in the throne
[58:01] room. Cuz
[58:04] what? And the little temporary
[58:06] sufferings that we go through now is not
[58:08] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[58:09] glory. Let's stop here just a minute
[58:11] because I know some of the some of the
[58:13] uh younger people, the graduates and all
[58:15] that, you're
[58:16] you're you're like, "Man, I'm going to
[58:19] be X and I'm going to make all the money
[58:23] I can because X, whatever your X is. But
[58:29] if you don't put God
[58:31] first, we're going to read about a guy
[58:33] here in just a little while that he did
[58:35] get all the riches in that he wanted,
[58:39] but it was one thing he
[58:41] lacked. One thing kept him, it even
[58:44] actually put him in hell.
[58:47] Everybody understand? It put him in
[58:49] hell.
[58:52] So let's don't do let's don't our career
[58:55] our career should not affect our
[58:57] Christian life.
[58:58] You can have a career
[59:01] and it not affect your Christian life.
[59:04] You say, "Well, I can't make any money."
[59:06] If God said he would take care of your
[59:09] needs, not your wants, not four cars in
[59:12] a garage, maybe one and a half or two. I
[59:14] don't know how you get one and a half
[59:16] car. Well, that's what the statistics
[59:18] say. That in America, we every family
[59:20] has one and a half cars. Well, how do
[59:22] you do that? That means some only have
[59:25] one and some have two. You know what I'm
[59:26] talking about. on average. But that's
[59:28] what he gave
[59:29] us. And he gave us a way to get what we
[59:32] needed through our Christianity. Yes,
[59:35] sir. Amen. Everybody with me? And you
[59:38] say, "Well, what about listen Bill Dao?"
[59:42] Everybody know who I'm talking about.
[59:43] Bill Dao, brother Bill Dao, Dao that
[59:46] Brother Brandham, he he he's done a lot
[59:48] of things for brother Brandham and he
[59:49] even still has a or his wife has a
[59:51] school in India that still funded by the
[59:54] millions that he made in the 60s, 50s,
[59:58] right? He was an older gentleman,
[59:59] millionaire back then. Well, he funded a
[1:00:02] lot of brother Brandham stuff. I'm sure
[1:00:03] he funded because remember they built
[1:00:05] him a parsonage and paid for it.
[1:00:11] Right. built the church, added on to it,
[1:00:14] zero money. That money had to come from
[1:00:16] somewhere, right? But God put Bill Dao
[1:00:19] in a place to where he could use what he
[1:00:22] had. And I think he had something to do
[1:00:23] with corrugated paper or or corrugated
[1:00:26] boxes or something is how he made his
[1:00:28] fortune. But what I'm saying is he he
[1:00:31] you see these people that make a fortune
[1:00:33] and they go off into whatever
[1:00:35] debauchery,
[1:00:38] all kind of stuff that they because they
[1:00:39] have money, they have power. But then
[1:00:41] you see God taking somebody like Bill
[1:00:43] Dao. Even somebody like the guy that
[1:00:45] owns the um Hobby Lobby, he's a
[1:00:49] Christian man to be a nominal Christian.
[1:00:51] Look at look at Steuart Kathy. He's
[1:00:53] passed on, but his kids are they don't
[1:00:55] open on
[1:00:56] Sunday. They stand for Jesus Christ as
[1:00:59] much as they know. They're Christians as
[1:01:00] much as they know.
[1:01:03] Right. And they can be closed on Sunday
[1:01:05] and do more volume per store than
[1:01:08] McDonald's staying open 24 hours a day.
[1:01:11] Seven days a week, right? I've never
[1:01:14] seen a Chick-fil-A that wasn't full.
[1:01:16] Have you? If it was, it was right before
[1:01:18] it opened. That was about it. Or right
[1:01:20] when it
[1:01:22] closed. Why you say, "Oh, those are the
[1:01:24] little things. It's the little foxes
[1:01:27] that spoil our vine. So why not it be
[1:01:29] the little things that add us that keeps
[1:01:31] adding the little things to get us where
[1:01:34] we're supposed to be?"
[1:01:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:37] Well, it's turned into a life lesson
[1:01:39] today, but that's okay. Amen.
[1:01:42] But a little temporary suffering we go
[1:01:44] through. I know some of you that
[1:01:45] graduating now, you had 12 years of
[1:01:47] suffering. Bless your poor little
[1:01:51] heart. If time goes on another 12 years,
[1:01:53] you'll say, "That was
[1:01:56] nothing. That was not that was what?
[1:01:59] Suffering? No. This is life.
[1:02:03] Where's my mom and daddy?
[1:02:06] We're there if you need us. You know
[1:02:07] that. But we have a heavenly heavenly
[1:02:10] father that we don't have to call on the
[1:02:11] phone and try to find
[1:02:15] we can pray to him right then and tell
[1:02:18] him our needs. But a little temporary
[1:02:20] suffering that we go through is not
[1:02:22] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:02:24] glor tremendous glory. Brother Ram keeps
[1:02:26] telling us to be revealed in us. to be
[1:02:29] revealed in us. To be revealed in
[1:02:34] us. I mean, listen, how many of you
[1:02:36] would love to have a uh, you know, I've
[1:02:38] been owner. We have several people that
[1:02:40] had ownership and and have several
[1:02:42] people working under you. What if they
[1:02:45] were all born again
[1:02:47] Christians? I'm talking about born
[1:02:49] again, full of the Holy Ghost. Amen. You
[1:02:51] might still have a few problems, but you
[1:02:53] sure won't have as many as you have with
[1:02:54] a bunch of whatever is working for you
[1:02:55] now.
[1:02:59] Oh, what treasures are laid up for those
[1:03:01] who are willing to enter into his king.
[1:03:02] I'm sorry. Just something went across my
[1:03:04] mind. Your ne you're not going to hate
[1:03:06] your neighbor when you get to heaven.
[1:03:09] Your neighbor's not going to be your
[1:03:10] father.
[1:03:12] Why? Because we're all going to be in
[1:03:13] the same spirit.
[1:03:15] We're all going to have the same thing.
[1:03:16] We're all going to have eternal life.
[1:03:17] We're going to be so happy.
[1:03:21] Oh, what treasures are laid up for those
[1:03:23] who are willing, now watch, willing, to
[1:03:26] enter his kingdom through a little
[1:03:30] tribulation. No, it says much
[1:03:32] tribulation.
[1:03:34] You say, "Well, why fight?" Well, I'm
[1:03:36] going to tell you one more time, kids,
[1:03:37] and even us adults, eternity is
[1:03:40] eternity.
[1:03:42] I know we can't fathom that in our brain
[1:03:45] at the moment. I mean, really, there was
[1:03:48] no end and there's no beginning and no
[1:03:50] end and and we're never going to get old
[1:03:52] and we're going to like everything and
[1:03:54] like everybody.
[1:03:56] That's a hard Sue. Be careful. That's a
[1:03:59] hard thing to fathom.
[1:04:06] That's why we got to be believers. We
[1:04:08] got to believe in something that we
[1:04:09] can't see at the pro at the moment and
[1:04:11] what we're going to be. Yes, sir. We
[1:04:13] can't fully see every bit of it. Amen.
[1:04:15] Amen. But through much tribulation will
[1:04:18] enter into the kingdom. And whatever,
[1:04:20] anything here that gives you
[1:04:22] satisfaction, listen to me just for a
[1:04:23] minute. Anything on this earth that
[1:04:25] gives you satisfaction besides God is
[1:04:29] temporary.
[1:04:31] Everything.
[1:04:33] It will fade away. It will not go into
[1:04:35] this new city. It'll stay right here and
[1:04:38] it'll be burned
[1:04:39] up. Listen, it's not bad to have a
[1:04:42] little have a little jingle in the
[1:04:43] pocket. Not bad to have a fat bill fold.
[1:04:45] Unless it's all the bills
[1:04:48] or receipts,
[1:04:50] but why? But you got to decide whether
[1:04:52] that's what you want to do or not.
[1:04:55] Cuz this world will let you have what
[1:04:57] you
[1:04:58] want. Listen, y'all can even work from
[1:05:00] home now.
[1:05:02] Man, we've had to fight and
[1:05:03] commute. I mean, I drive at least a
[1:05:06] quarter of a mile to to the post office.
[1:05:12] I tell them I said, "Man, the traffic
[1:05:14] was bad." There was two dogs and three
[1:05:15] cats got run across the road in front of
[1:05:17] me. One girl drives from Cleveland and
[1:05:19] she said, "I had to drive through
[1:05:20] Gainesville." I said, "Well, that's your
[1:05:21] problem."
[1:05:25] Well, what am I trying to
[1:05:27] say? You have something to do with all
[1:05:29] of this, right? Amen. And I'll promise
[1:05:33] you one thing. You cannot go sit at your
[1:05:35] house, go inside of your home and sit
[1:05:38] down, play video games or whatever. You
[1:05:41] listen, even read your Bible and say,
[1:05:44] "God, give me a job." And somebody walks
[1:05:47] on, I'm giving you a job. No, there's a
[1:05:50] little effort got to be made.
[1:05:53] Get off and on. Get off the and get on
[1:05:56] the
[1:05:57] put out your resume.
[1:06:05] Is that all right?
[1:06:10] Because
[1:06:12] listen, unless God comes in the next 15
[1:06:15] minutes, you have a future.
[1:06:19] You have a future. When you walk out of
[1:06:21] this door today, you still you've got a
[1:06:23] future. And you and I have a future. We
[1:06:25] have to grow to get to it. Right? It's
[1:06:28] not Listen, God's not going to dump
[1:06:30] everything on us at one time. He knows
[1:06:32] we can't handle it.
[1:06:34] He know Listen, what if you had all from
[1:06:37] like you're you're in the first
[1:06:40] grade. Anybody ever even remember being
[1:06:42] in the first grade?
[1:06:44] Except you look at the picture and go,
[1:06:46] "That wasn't me." Yeah, it was. Big
[1:06:50] ears, fat. Yeah.
[1:06:51] Anyway, that was Terren. That wasn't me.
[1:06:54] Y'all thought he was talking about me,
[1:06:55] didn't you? Sorry about
[1:06:59] that. But you may not you can remember
[1:07:01] the night you got born again. You may
[1:07:04] not remember all the problems you had
[1:07:06] when you first got born
[1:07:08] again. But that's here. We're living in
[1:07:12] the present.
[1:07:14] If you're still a baby, it's okay.
[1:07:16] Listen, it's okay. God said your
[1:07:19] children, but he wants somebody that he
[1:07:22] can depend on when they open their
[1:07:25] mouth. Amen. And a lot of us, me
[1:07:28] included, God can't depend on every time
[1:07:30] I open my mouth that something's going
[1:07:32] to come out of it good.
[1:07:34] Well, then everybody said, "Well, pray
[1:07:35] for me then, y'all. Bunch of saints."
[1:07:42] But child training, though, remember,
[1:07:44] God's perfect. He's a perfect teacher.
[1:07:46] Amen. He has the perfect curriculum.
[1:07:48] Yes, sir. His textbook have not had to
[1:07:51] be rewritten and updated.
[1:07:56] His message didn't have to be changed.
[1:08:00] Who changed?
[1:08:02] We did. That's right. We changed to
[1:08:05] conform to his image.
[1:08:10] You got that right. We have to,
[1:08:12] brother. So, we had to get back to that.
[1:08:15] We had to get back, brother's telling
[1:08:16] us, we had to get back to the same
[1:08:17] teaching, everything exactly with the
[1:08:19] vindication of the same pillar of fire
[1:08:21] that struck Paul. So what happens is
[1:08:23] we've we've come now to this place to
[1:08:26] where we have by the new birth, we've
[1:08:29] we've come to our Canaan land and we've
[1:08:31] crossed over. Everybody with me? Yes,
[1:08:33] sir. We've crossed over into our
[1:08:36] placing. A lot of people didn't get to
[1:08:37] that placing part. Everybody with me?
[1:08:39] Right. We are at that place that we're
[1:08:42] crossed over Jordan and we're here with
[1:08:44] our Joshua which is the Holy Ghost which
[1:08:46] is leading and guiding us through our
[1:08:48] ministry ministry not minister ministry
[1:08:51] right and the Bible prophets message.
[1:08:54] Amen. I believe in press and play.
[1:08:56] That's right. But press and play ain't
[1:08:58] going to get you in the promised land.
[1:09:00] It ain't gonna positionally place you.
[1:09:01] It'll get you in there. It will not
[1:09:03] positionally place you only through a
[1:09:05] five-fold ministry. Because why would he
[1:09:07] say at the very end of that five-fold
[1:09:08] ministry, for the
[1:09:11] perfecting of the saints, for the
[1:09:14] edifying of the body of Christ until we
[1:09:17] all come to what? The full stature of a
[1:09:20] perfect man.
[1:09:22] So the same teaching had to be back then
[1:09:26] is now. Yes. All the scruples and all
[1:09:28] the things that were messed
[1:09:32] up. Now, brother Ram tells us the word
[1:09:34] becomes you and you become the word.
[1:09:36] Yes. Continue on a little bit faster.
[1:09:38] You become Listen. You become the word
[1:09:40] as you receive the word. Listen. You
[1:09:43] become the world as you receive the
[1:09:45] world.
[1:09:47] Come on, somebody.
[1:09:49] Yes, sir. You receive what the world
[1:09:51] has.
[1:09:53] But you have a filter
[1:09:56] that you can kick it out. That's right.
[1:09:58] Praise God. You have the ability. Yes.
[1:10:01] Some people don't have that ability,
[1:10:03] right? Drugs, alcohol, sex, whatever you
[1:10:06] want to call it, they can carry right on
[1:10:07] through and it doesn't bother them
[1:10:09] because their conscience is not
[1:10:10] absolutely the conscious of the Holy
[1:10:12] Ghost.
[1:10:14] But if you got the conscious of the Holy
[1:10:16] Ghost, it'll put the brakes on. Oh, yes.
[1:10:19] Right. Same thing with you brothers and
[1:10:21] sisters looking for a job.
[1:10:25] If you got the Holy Ghost, he said he
[1:10:27] leads you, guide you into all truth. You
[1:10:29] say, "Well, he ain't got nothing to do
[1:10:30] with my with my personal life." Well,
[1:10:32] yeah, he does.
[1:10:35] He better have something to do with your
[1:10:36] personal life.
[1:10:39] You become the word as you receive the
[1:10:41] word.
[1:10:43] Now, we were talking about this
[1:10:45] um Wednesday, and it's just a little
[1:10:48] something to help
[1:10:50] you. Remember, we did not come here on
[1:10:54] the
[1:10:55] earth with us in him. I mean with him
[1:10:58] and us, right?
[1:11:02] We came here born in sin, shaped in
[1:11:03] iniquity, sponsored from my mother's
[1:11:04] womb, a liar on our way to hell. Now,
[1:11:07] brother Barham said that he was a sinner
[1:11:09] and he was going to hell. Okay, is
[1:11:11] everybody with me? But there was a
[1:11:13] theophony, the great king theophony, the
[1:11:15] word theophony or an immorphy body that
[1:11:18] we talked about which came into the
[1:11:20] person of Melazdc and then he came into
[1:11:22] the person of Jesus Christ. The reason
[1:11:23] I'm telling you this is is because that
[1:11:26] theophony is what's going to give you
[1:11:28] your adoption. You can't have get
[1:11:29] adopted without that theophony. Part of
[1:11:31] that theophony being inside of you. He
[1:11:34] knows what to do. Brother B said she'll
[1:11:35] know what to do with the word. She who
[1:11:38] she the bride will know what to do when
[1:11:41] a situation comes up will not have no
[1:11:45] answer.
[1:11:48] We'll have an answer
[1:11:50] when you come to that adoption. You will
[1:11:52] have an answer and it will be correct.
[1:11:55] Yes. That's why brother Brandham had to
[1:11:58] come to his adoption on that mountain
[1:12:00] when the sword fit his hand. And then
[1:12:03] you see that he was identified here when
[1:12:05] the cloud came. Everybody with me?
[1:12:09] Then what did God do? He put the sword
[1:12:11] in brother Ram's hand and said,
[1:12:13] "Hey, the
[1:12:15] seals now need to be open." Yeah. And
[1:12:19] when those seals opened, it was contrary
[1:12:21] to he you I'm going to read it to you
[1:12:22] later in the in the series. Brother Bram
[1:12:25] said, "Contrary to what I believed,
[1:12:30] right?"
[1:12:32] Because of his progression of ministry,
[1:12:35] he had to come to a place where God
[1:12:36] adopted him. Because what did he want to
[1:12:38] do then? As soon as he opened his
[1:12:42] mouth on those seals, that was the
[1:12:46] lamb preaching those messages.
[1:12:50] That was God himself. Now, now it was
[1:12:53] back here. It is for other brothers. But
[1:12:54] I'm telling you that special time was
[1:12:56] when that seal those seals opened. It
[1:12:59] wasn't a man filtered through a man's
[1:13:01] idea. That's right. Amen. Come on. It
[1:13:04] was God himself. He had took over the
[1:13:06] mind and said, "This is it." Brother
[1:13:08] Brown said, "I've I've I've never worked
[1:13:10] in this realm." He's had healing
[1:13:12] ministries, people raised from the dead,
[1:13:14] healed the sick by the hundreds of
[1:13:15] thousands. He said, "I've never worked
[1:13:18] in a in a way, my ministries never
[1:13:22] worked in a, in other words, I'm going
[1:13:23] to say it, in a power,
[1:13:25] amen, that has ever worked before." Even
[1:13:28] though there was a power of healing,
[1:13:29] there was manifestation of of all these
[1:13:32] different things, but this right here,
[1:13:34] he said, "I've never worked in this
[1:13:35] realm." Why? Because brother Ram knew it
[1:13:37] wasn't him.
[1:13:39] Amen. It wasn't him at all. None. That's
[1:13:44] right. Apart from man's ideas. He said,
[1:13:47] you say, "Well, that was for him." I
[1:13:48] believe you. We all have to have a sword
[1:13:50] in the hand experience. If you're going
[1:13:52] to be born
[1:13:53] again and come to adoption, you got to
[1:13:56] have the word in your hand experience.
[1:13:58] And it's got to be able to fit your
[1:14:00] hand. Amen. Sisters,
[1:14:03] it's got to fit your hand. That's right.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:10] Let's continue
[1:14:11] on. Oh, I want to read this right here
[1:14:13] because I I come across this glorified
[1:14:15] Jesus 1955. We were talking about that
[1:14:20] theophony thousand years maybe from
[1:14:22] tonight. The wind are blowing howling
[1:14:24] across the barren world. Your tombstone
[1:14:26] may come out of the dust. Your name's on
[1:14:27] it. But where's your soul? Remember,
[1:14:30] you're going to be somewhere.
[1:14:34] There was a time when you was nothing or
[1:14:38] nowhere. Everybody with me? There was a
[1:14:41] time when you was something, you was
[1:14:44] nothing or nowhere. But there never will
[1:14:47] be a time but what you'll be something
[1:14:51] are
[1:14:52] somewhere. That's pretty
[1:14:55] profound. We were nothing. We come to
[1:14:58] this world to develop our
[1:15:01] person, our individuality. Yes. And it's
[1:15:05] either going to be for the devil or for
[1:15:07] Christ. One of the two. Yes. No in
[1:15:09] between. But once you come here and
[1:15:12] start developing, you're going to be
[1:15:14] something cuz that something's going to
[1:15:15] the white throne judgment or that
[1:15:17] something's going in the rapture. One of
[1:15:18] the two.
[1:15:20] And you're going to be somewhere.
[1:15:23] You're either going to be in a burning
[1:15:24] hell or you're going to be in heaven.
[1:15:25] There's no two. There's not a purgatory.
[1:15:27] There's not a there's not a place of
[1:15:28] ease that maybe I can live over here a
[1:15:30] little bit and I'll live over here a
[1:15:31] little bit. That's what we do in our in
[1:15:33] our human life. We want to live over
[1:15:35] here a little bit and then when not when
[1:15:37] we can't just really, you know, we
[1:15:38] really can't live over here. So, we just
[1:15:39] live over here a little bit. Nope. Can't
[1:15:42] do that. Everybody with me? So, Brother
[1:15:45] Brown tells us he said, "Your adoption
[1:15:48] is not your birth." I think we've come
[1:15:50] through all that. You receive the new
[1:15:53] birth which is the theophony of God in
[1:15:55] portion of what you have. Everybody with
[1:15:58] me? And it is God. It's not something
[1:16:01] else. It's God.
[1:16:03] He can do that. He can multiply and
[1:16:06] never get weaker. We can't do that. We
[1:16:11] call it watering down. God don't water
[1:16:13] down. The more people he gives a new
[1:16:15] birth, the stronger he is.
[1:16:18] So he gives us a new birth. He gives us
[1:16:20] part of that
[1:16:21] theophony. Now, that theophony is your
[1:16:24] new birth and it can stay there in your
[1:16:26] soul and will never come out of it. If
[1:16:28] you're truly born again, it will carry
[1:16:31] you to your future home. Right? But now,
[1:16:36] if that's all it was, then God, and I
[1:16:38] don't mean this sacrilegiously, God
[1:16:40] spent a lot of time writing a Bible that
[1:16:42] he really didn't need to write.
[1:16:46] Now look, if you all right, if you were
[1:16:47] in the first grade, you sat there in the
[1:16:49] first grade, you learned everything you
[1:16:50] needed to know. Why is there a second
[1:16:52] and a third and a fourth and a fifth?
[1:16:54] Why is there books you got to read? Why
[1:16:56] is there a college you got to go to? Why
[1:16:57] is all that? Cuz it's called
[1:16:59] development, right? It's your human
[1:17:02] development. Listen, it's your human
[1:17:04] development once you get born again.
[1:17:06] It's your human development intertwined
[1:17:08] with eternity. Amen. Or intertwined with
[1:17:12] what? the spirit of God. Yes. Right. And
[1:17:15] then you still got your natural thing
[1:17:17] you got to live.
[1:17:19] That's why God listen, God, that's why I
[1:17:21] said God spend a lot of time writing the
[1:17:23] Bible when all we had to do is go, "Oh,
[1:17:26] all I got to do is believe on the Lord
[1:17:28] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved."
[1:17:30] Okay? No. He wants you to grow just like
[1:17:33] you're growing as a human being. Amen.
[1:17:35] He wants you. He's happy to see you take
[1:17:38] the word of God and grow. Amen. He's a
[1:17:41] He's a a gloating parent.
[1:17:44] Cuz that's what it says when we read
[1:17:46] where brother R says that the Holy
[1:17:48] Spirit is your tutor. And he goes back
[1:17:50] to the father says, "Man, he's just like
[1:17:53] you." Or he goes to him and says, "He
[1:17:56] ain't acting very good today.
[1:17:59] You probably need to go sit in there and
[1:18:00] close the door and let me take care of
[1:18:02] him
[1:18:04] cuz he probably failed today." You know,
[1:18:07] I'm sure y'all are not none of y'all's
[1:18:09] going through that. So, just pray for
[1:18:11] me. So, but your adoption is not your
[1:18:14] birth. Your adoption is your placing.
[1:18:16] Now, that's what we want. We want to be
[1:18:18] placed where God saw us before the
[1:18:22] foundation of the world. And listen, if
[1:18:23] he saw us before the foundation of the
[1:18:25] world, in a place in a
[1:18:27] position, we're going to get there.
[1:18:29] Amen. That's right. So what? Do I put my
[1:18:32] dependency on me or do I put my
[1:18:34] dependency on God already seeing that?
[1:18:36] And what? Feel the pull that's pulling
[1:18:38] me toward it. Amen.
[1:18:42] Your adoption is your placing. When you
[1:18:44] were born again, John 1:17, when you're
[1:18:46] born of the spirit of God, you are sons
[1:18:49] of God. But we were predestinated. What?
[1:18:52] He predetermined your destiny by what he
[1:18:57] saw you do before you were even born.
[1:19:01] For there was a world.
[1:19:04] Amen. That's why you can't fail if your
[1:19:05] name's in the lamb's book of life, the
[1:19:07] eternal section. You cannot fail.
[1:19:08] There's no way you can fail.
[1:19:12] But he wants us to come to adoption. If
[1:19:14] we don't if we don't come to a place to
[1:19:17] where God can use us
[1:19:20] exclusively, you with me, that he can't
[1:19:23] fulfill all the scripture, right?
[1:19:27] Speak to this mountain.
[1:19:30] All these different things. Brother Bram
[1:19:32] says, "Come into speaking condition."
[1:19:36] Some of y'all need to come into You're
[1:19:37] already in sleeping condition.
[1:19:42] So adoption is what?
[1:19:44] Placing you're a child with God. Now
[1:19:46] he's talking to the Pentecostals. And
[1:19:48] they did. Listen, the Pentecostals in
[1:19:50] 1906 Street and the ones that Brother
[1:19:52] Ram saw and and and dealt with, a lot of
[1:19:55] them were born again.
[1:20:00] Come on. A lot of them were born again,
[1:20:02] but not under his era, not under his
[1:20:04] time or his time of placing. They lost
[1:20:07] their placing. right? Says, "Oh, you're
[1:20:10] a child of God." I say, "This is what
[1:20:11] hurts Pentecostal a little." They say,
[1:20:13] "I got born again. Praise the Lord. Got
[1:20:15] the Holy Ghost." Fine. You're a child of
[1:20:17] God. That's right. But yet, that ain't
[1:20:19] what I'm talking
[1:20:21] about. See, you were predestinated unto
[1:20:24] adoption. Adoption is placing or
[1:20:28] establishing or to set forth. I like
[1:20:31] that word there, to
[1:20:33] ordain. Right?
[1:20:36] So remember what the
[1:20:38] fall Adam was in a position of
[1:20:41] authority.
[1:20:42] Are with me? Adam was in a position of
[1:20:45] authority. Complete authority. What he
[1:20:48] said happened.
[1:20:50] All right. Now to get us back into the
[1:20:53] condition, an e an Edenlike condition.
[1:20:56] What do we got to do? There's got to be
[1:20:58] an Adam. There was the second Adam, but
[1:21:00] now where is that second Adam? He said,
[1:21:02] "Okay, I'm going to adopt a group of
[1:21:04] kids. I'm going to adopt a group of
[1:21:06] people that's going to take us back to
[1:21:08] the garden." Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:21:12] Before the fall, that's what's going to
[1:21:14] come down, folks. That's what we're
[1:21:16] going to live in. We're going to live in
[1:21:18] another Garden of Eden. Brother Brian,
[1:21:20] read future home. He said, "Another
[1:21:22] garden of Eden has begun." Amen. That's
[1:21:25] right. But you got to have a part of
[1:21:26] that inside of you right now, today, or
[1:21:29] you'll never get there. That's right.
[1:21:31] Amen.
[1:21:35] Let's skip through this. Get to a point
[1:21:38] and then we'll
[1:21:40] stop. Oh, here. Romans. Here's Ephesians
[1:21:43] 4. Now, this is Paul. There will
[1:21:45] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:21:47] and fro carried about with everyone to
[1:21:49] doctrine. Now, God is telling you there
[1:21:52] are going to
[1:21:53] be a tossing time.
[1:21:56] There's going to be winds of false
[1:21:59] doctrine. Amen.
[1:22:01] There's men that will slight you or that
[1:22:05] are cunning.
[1:22:07] Amen. And they're going to lie and wait
[1:22:09] to deceive you. Right? They're coming
[1:22:13] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:22:16] though tossed to and fro with all this
[1:22:18] stuff, but speaking the truth in love
[1:22:21] may grow up into him look in all things
[1:22:24] which is the head. Amen. Even Christ.
[1:22:27] Romans 8 29. for whom he did forno. He
[1:22:30] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:22:33] the image of a son. He saw a group of
[1:22:35] people.
[1:22:37] He saw a group of people come to
[1:22:39] adoption.
[1:22:42] Now, we can, you know, we can sleep our
[1:22:44] way through it or we can we can say,
[1:22:46] "Well, it denied and say it ain't
[1:22:47] coming." Remember the scripture says,
[1:22:49] "Oh, they've been saying this since the
[1:22:50] dawn of time."
[1:22:52] You know, granny told us that Jesus was
[1:22:54] coming and
[1:22:56] and granny's granny's told him the same
[1:22:59] thing and granny's granny's granny's
[1:23:00] told him the same thing.
[1:23:04] Well, there's going to be a time, folks,
[1:23:06] when this thing's going to be over. And
[1:23:08] because of the signpost that we're
[1:23:09] seeing,
[1:23:11] remember, we're seeing the signpost.
[1:23:13] I believe we're in the right vehicle. I
[1:23:15] believe we're on the right road. But
[1:23:17] there is signpost to tell us, hey,
[1:23:19] you're almost there. Amen. Hey, you're
[1:23:22] almost there.
[1:23:24] You've got a prophecy that's being
[1:23:26] fulfilled. Now you're going to see
[1:23:27] another prophecy fulfilled. Now you're
[1:23:29] going to see another prophecy fulfilled.
[1:23:30] And we just keep what? We just keep
[1:23:32] driving down the road. Don't look right
[1:23:34] or left except look at the sign. And
[1:23:36] that sign is going to take us out of
[1:23:38] here. Now remember
[1:23:40] though, remember a wicked and adulterous
[1:23:43] generation seeketh for a sign. But
[1:23:46] remember, seeketh for a sign only.
[1:23:49] It's like I said before the other day
[1:23:52] when the pope came out of the United
[1:23:53] States, man, it was just all over.
[1:23:54] Blowed up the internet, all the
[1:23:56] believers, you know, and and uh I told
[1:23:59] him I didn't tell them. I was wanting to
[1:24:00] tell him that this is tomorrow's
[1:24:02] Mother's Day. Can y'all let's preach a
[1:24:04] Mother's Day sermon. Let's don't preach
[1:24:05] about the Pope coming out of the United
[1:24:07] States. I mean, they were, you know,
[1:24:08] they were telling you his his onesie
[1:24:12] size. Brother Bob, you laughing. I know
[1:24:15] that they were talking about the day he
[1:24:17] was
[1:24:18] concepted, his conception. They went
[1:24:20] back nine months when brother Ram said
[1:24:22] that what he said and he said something
[1:24:24] else and that's just it ain't garbage.
[1:24:26] It's good. But let's don't major on a
[1:24:29] minor.
[1:24:31] The pope coming out of the United States
[1:24:33] is not going to adopt you.
[1:24:36] But your adoption is going to carry you
[1:24:38] through that.
[1:24:40] Not turn right or not turn left, but
[1:24:42] keep going straight ahead. Amen. Because
[1:24:45] we're what? We're mature Christians.
[1:24:49] And many people, I'm telling you, many
[1:24:51] people waited for that to happen cuz
[1:24:53] like I said before, I got a couple phone
[1:24:54] calls from people that hadn't been back
[1:24:56] to church in years. Oh, what about this
[1:24:58] pope coming out of the United States? I
[1:24:59] started say, you get in church. I don't
[1:25:02] want to talk to you about the pope. You
[1:25:04] get back in church because that's not
[1:25:06] going to put you nowhere except in hell.
[1:25:09] That's right. Cuz remember those
[1:25:11] signposts are there for us to see them.
[1:25:15] Don't pass them by.
[1:25:17] But remember, we can't we can't major on
[1:25:21] a minor. Brother Ram told us that in the
[1:25:24] healing campaign, you can't major on a
[1:25:26] minor.
[1:25:28] We can't major and say, "Well, this is
[1:25:30] it, boy, because the pope and I've got
[1:25:31] this figured out and I'm going to and
[1:25:33] the gold and this is coming and that's
[1:25:35] coming." Quit wasting your time. Amen.
[1:25:38] Amen. The world's going to do what God
[1:25:41] saw him do. But he's als you're going to
[1:25:43] also do what God saw you do. What you
[1:25:46] did about it.
[1:25:48] Everybody with me. For whom he did
[1:25:50] forno, he also did predestinate to be
[1:25:52] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:25:55] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:25:56] brethren. In other words, he is our
[1:25:58] first fruits. He's the one that we look
[1:25:59] at. He come to adoption. Brother Ram
[1:26:01] come to adoption. We can come to
[1:26:03] adoption. Amen.
[1:26:06] Cuz he said, "But when what?" For we
[1:26:08] know in part, we prophesy in part. Those
[1:26:09] have been the years, the years of
[1:26:11] preparation. But when that which is
[1:26:12] perfect, it's come. That which is in
[1:26:15] part shall be done away with. When I was
[1:26:17] a child, I spake as a child. I
[1:26:18] understood as a child. Didn't matter.
[1:26:20] Didn't matter to God you was a child. 30
[1:26:22] years later, it didn't matter that you
[1:26:24] were a child. I thought as a child, but
[1:26:26] when I became a man, I put those
[1:26:29] thoughts and ideas away.
[1:26:33] Away. I didn't build on them anymore. I
[1:26:36] put them away. For everyone that uses
[1:26:39] milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:26:42] righteousness, for he's a baby. But
[1:26:44] strong meat belongth to them that are of
[1:26:45] full age. Even those, now watch, even
[1:26:48] those who by reason of
[1:26:55] use. Even those who by reason of use,
[1:26:59] that means you read, that means you
[1:27:01] study, that means you pray, right? That
[1:27:05] means you come to church.
[1:27:08] If we have to keep preaching on people
[1:27:09] coming to church, then it's horrible.
[1:27:10] You're just lost. I mean, just
[1:27:12] absolutely lost.
[1:27:15] Amen. Or you just don't believe
[1:27:17] everything brother said. I guess we get
[1:27:19] to pick and choose now. That's what the
[1:27:20] people out there are doing. They're
[1:27:21] picking and choosing what they like. Oh,
[1:27:23] brother. That seven said, "Boy, the pope
[1:27:24] come out of the United States. Where
[1:27:25] have you been?" "Oh, I don't think we
[1:27:27] need to go to church every Sunday now."
[1:27:28] Well, that's your
[1:27:30] problem. That's not brother Ram said.
[1:27:32] That's right.
[1:27:34] Strong meat belongs to them that are of
[1:27:36] full age, even those who by reason of
[1:27:38] use have their senses exercised to
[1:27:41] discern both good and evil. So how you
[1:27:43] going to discern good and evil? You are
[1:27:45] exercising your faith. You are
[1:27:48] exercising, listen, garbage in, garbage
[1:27:51] out. Holy Ghost in, Holy Ghost out. Pure
[1:27:56] word of God in, pure word of God is
[1:27:57] going to come out. All
[1:28:01] right. the
[1:28:04] harmony. God wants us all to come to
[1:28:06] adoption. Every one of
[1:28:09] us. And he laid it out there. Even
[1:28:12] listen, if he laid it out there for Cain
[1:28:13] to even get saved,
[1:28:16] he sure will lay it out there for his
[1:28:18] children to further their education
[1:28:23] through the gospel.
[1:28:26] But the harmony he wants is where him
[1:28:28] and his wife are one. Amen.
[1:28:32] Listen, he is not one with the
[1:28:34] denominations.
[1:28:36] Can't be.
[1:28:38] They won't receive headship. That's the
[1:28:41] whole problem.
[1:28:43] They won't receive
[1:28:45] headship. Well, you got to do this. No,
[1:28:47] I don't have to do
[1:28:49] that. Now, watch. This harmony is now to
[1:28:52] exist between the groom and his
[1:28:54] bride. He shows her his word of life.
[1:28:58] She receives it. She never doubts
[1:29:01] it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[1:29:05] even death.
[1:29:06] For if the seed be planted, the water
[1:29:09] will raise it up again. Here is the
[1:29:12] secret of this. Everybody likes secrets.
[1:29:16] You'll perk up when somebody says, "I
[1:29:17] got a secret for
[1:29:18] you." Here's the secret. The word is in
[1:29:21] the bride as it was in Mary. Now, who
[1:29:25] are you talking
[1:29:26] about? Jesus Christ
[1:29:30] in the womb of Mary. All right. By an
[1:29:32] immaculate conception. Okay. How do you
[1:29:34] and I get born again? By an immaculate
[1:29:36] conception. Everybody with me?
[1:29:39] Not natural. The word is in the bride as
[1:29:42] it was in Mary. The bride has the mind
[1:29:45] of Christ. For she knows what he wants.
[1:29:47] Done with the word. Now, that was Adam's
[1:29:49] position. Adam knew what God wanted to
[1:29:52] do. Adam knew what God wanted. And he
[1:29:55] didn't even have a Bible. Right. He had
[1:29:58] so much the mind of God. Is that not
[1:30:00] true? He's the God of the earth. Brother
[1:30:03] Ram said he could say, "Move over there,
[1:30:05] tree, move." You know, mountain, go over
[1:30:06] that way, wind, quit blowing.
[1:30:10] The bride has the mind of Christ, for
[1:30:12] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:30:14] word. She performs the command of the
[1:30:17] word in his name, for she has thus
[1:30:21] sayeth the Lord. Then the word is
[1:30:23] quickened by watch. Then the word is
[1:30:27] quickened by the spirit. Now, where's
[1:30:29] where is the spirit? If you have the new
[1:30:31] birth, it's inside you. All right? So,
[1:30:34] the word's got to be quickened where?
[1:30:36] Inside of you.
[1:30:38] Then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:30:40] and it comes to pass. Like a seed that's
[1:30:44] planted and watered, it comes to full
[1:30:46] harvest. Look, full harvest, adoption,
[1:30:48] full harvest, right? You're not going to
[1:30:51] go out there and cut your corn down
[1:30:53] right now. They got neighbor of mine's
[1:30:55] got corn up and I would have too about
[1:30:57] this high. We'll go out there and cut it
[1:31:00] down as corn. Damn, brother. How many
[1:31:03] years will we get off that? None. That's
[1:31:06] right. Yet it is corn.
[1:31:09] Right. It has the characteristics of
[1:31:11] corn. It has the DNA of corn. It's corn.
[1:31:14] Amen. But if you cut it down before it
[1:31:17] matures,
[1:31:19] you have nothing to eat.
[1:31:23] Then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:31:24] and it comes to pass. Like a seed that's
[1:31:26] planted and watered, it comes to full
[1:31:29] harvest serving its purpose. You know,
[1:31:31] Jesus said one time, he said, "Hey, let
[1:31:33] them
[1:31:34] alone. Let them both grow, the wheat and
[1:31:36] the let them grow together cuz they look
[1:31:38] just alike right when you first get
[1:31:40] started." But remember, like I said
[1:31:42] before, everybody's going to manifest
[1:31:44] whatever the seed was that was in the
[1:31:46] ground is going to come out on the vine
[1:31:48] somewhere, right? Okay.
[1:31:52] Because corn and grass in a in a when
[1:31:54] it's about that big, corn and grass look
[1:31:55] the
[1:31:56] same. That's right. But now when it
[1:31:59] matures, the grass don't look nothing
[1:32:02] like the corn. When you mature, you're
[1:32:04] going to look nothing like this world.
[1:32:06] Right.
[1:32:09] All
[1:32:10] right. The church is waiting on me and
[1:32:12] you adoption time. When God can pour
[1:32:14] into his into us his fullness, his
[1:32:17] power, his resurrection, that when the
[1:32:19] church and Christ become so close
[1:32:21] together, till Christ becomes visible
[1:32:24] among us, how is he going to be visible
[1:32:27] among us? Cuz we going to act like him.
[1:32:31] He will not be here in his physical
[1:32:33] form, flesh. Amen. But he's going to
[1:32:36] come here in your flesh.
[1:32:39] Amen. And just for a moment, I'll bring
[1:32:42] that quote a little bit later on. Just
[1:32:44] for a moment, God's going to present
[1:32:45] this bride to the world. You just wait
[1:32:47] and see. There's going to be power and
[1:32:49] it's going to have character. That's
[1:32:51] right. Cuz that's the only way we're
[1:32:52] going to get out of here. Amen. That's
[1:32:54] the only way we're going to leave with
[1:32:55] the body changes. Have power and
[1:32:57] character. Amen.
[1:32:59] his power, his resurrection, that when
[1:33:01] the church and Christ become so close
[1:33:03] together till Christ becomes visible
[1:33:05] among us, raises the dead, and we go in
[1:33:09] the rapture. That's what I'm looking
[1:33:11] for, folks. I'm not looking for anything
[1:33:13] else. If you're looking for something
[1:33:15] else, then you're sitting in the wrong
[1:33:16] place.
[1:33:19] Now, let's continue. I'm going to skip
[1:33:21] all that and uh we'll get to it next
[1:33:24] week sometime.
[1:33:32] Yeah, I'm way behind. I I got enough,
[1:33:34] brother Emanuel. I got enough to for
[1:33:37] another sermon. But here's the one I
[1:33:40] wanted to to
[1:33:45] uh read you right
[1:33:49] here. Brother Ram said blasphemous
[1:33:51] names. Now, blasphemous names, if you
[1:33:53] don't know it, blasphemous names is
[1:33:54] preached right after the statue of
[1:33:55] perfect man. Remember he preached Statue
[1:33:58] of Perfect Man, preached the guy, my
[1:34:00] guide. Then the next Sunday he preached
[1:34:02] over in Jeffersonville. He preached
[1:34:03] blasphemous names. And he went right
[1:34:05] back and almost preached the same sermon
[1:34:07] again of the statue of a perfect man. So
[1:34:10] now you say, "Brother Brandom, do we
[1:34:12] should we speak with tongues?"
[1:34:13] Absolutely. That's gifts of God. But
[1:34:17] those gifts of God without these virtues
[1:34:19] in them makes a stumble block to the
[1:34:23] unbeliever.
[1:34:26] It's not accepted by God. That's pretty
[1:34:30] powerful. It's not accepted by God. This
[1:34:35] has to be first. And when you have
[1:34:36] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:34:38] patience, godliness, brotherly love.
[1:34:40] Then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:34:41] seals you as a unit. What? Adopts you.
[1:34:45] Doesn't give you the Holy Ghost again.
[1:34:46] You got the Holy Ghost when you got born
[1:34:48] again. You get an extra Philly. You get
[1:34:50] a you get uh God takes out of the
[1:34:53] reserve and just pours it into you,
[1:34:54] right? Amen.
[1:34:57] Seals the church ages as a unit. The way
[1:34:59] he makes his bride is the way he makes
[1:35:02] his individual.
[1:35:04] All right, you with me? Give me another
[1:35:06] minute. Made out of same material.
[1:35:11] Like Eve was made out of Adam, a rib
[1:35:13] from his side. Here is the thing that
[1:35:16] you have to have first is what? The
[1:35:18] virtues. You can't impersonate them. You
[1:35:22] can't imitate them. They've got to be
[1:35:24] God- sent and God born. Imitation only
[1:35:28] causes confusion.
[1:35:32] I get finished preaching today and I
[1:35:34] hope y'all feel that I'm born again. And
[1:35:36] if you go and and I hope you nobody goes
[1:35:38] to a bar, but if you go go to buy a bar
[1:35:40] and you say, "Well, brother, where's the
[1:35:41] car sitting right
[1:35:44] there?" I ain't got it to begin with
[1:35:46] like that. But that's what he's talking
[1:35:48] about. We become a stumble block when we
[1:35:50] say we're here.
[1:35:52] We say we have this. We say we have
[1:35:55] this. We say we have love. We say we
[1:35:57] have this and then we don't display it.
[1:36:02] Right? We don't display it. That's what
[1:36:04] brother R was talking about. It's a
[1:36:05] stumbling block. What is a stumbling
[1:36:06] block? Something you trip over.
[1:36:09] Listen, this is
[1:36:11] the you know what that word stumbling
[1:36:13] block, brother Boba, it it does say
[1:36:15] stumbling block in certain places cuz he
[1:36:17] read it. But if you look at the Greek,
[1:36:21] it's where the word scandal comes
[1:36:25] from. That's the Greek word scandalon.
[1:36:28] But it's where the word scandal comes
[1:36:31] from. You have created a scandal by
[1:36:33] what? You've created a story. That is
[1:36:36] not
[1:36:38] true. It's an offense, occasion to fall,
[1:36:41] things that offend. The movable stick or
[1:36:44] trigger of a trap. And that's what it
[1:36:46] is. It's a trap.
[1:36:49] snare, any impediment placed in the way
[1:36:51] and causing one to stumble or fall. A
[1:36:54] stumbling block, occasion of stumbling,
[1:36:56] a rock which is a cause of stumbling
[1:36:58] applied to Jesus Christ whose person and
[1:37:00] career were so contrary to the
[1:37:03] expectations of the Jews concerning the
[1:37:05] Messiah, they rejected him by by their
[1:37:08] own
[1:37:09] obstinacy made shipwreck of their
[1:37:13] salvation. Wow.
[1:37:17] Because remember, he talk a stone of
[1:37:19] stubbling, a rock of offense, and all
[1:37:20] that. They stumbled at the very person
[1:37:24] that was supposed to give them eternal
[1:37:25] life. Amen. They stumbled at
[1:37:28] him. All right, we're going to skip
[1:37:31] through. All right, God bless you. For
[1:37:33] all you graduates, listen just a
[1:37:36] second. Let's go to Proverbs 3:9.
[1:37:41] Now, there's two ways that they talked
[1:37:43] about
[1:37:44] barns in the Bible. One's good, one's
[1:37:48] bad, but they're barns. Everybody with
[1:37:51] me? They're barns. Talking about barns
[1:37:54] here in Proverbs 3:9. So shall thy barns
[1:37:57] be filled with plenty, and thy presses
[1:38:00] shall burst out with new wine. My son,
[1:38:04] despise not the chastening of the Lord.
[1:38:06] We've been talking about that. Despise
[1:38:08] not the chastening of the Lord, neither
[1:38:10] be weary of his
[1:38:13] correction. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:38:16] correctth, even as a father the son in
[1:38:19] whom he
[1:38:20] delightth. Happy is the man that findeth
[1:38:23] wisdom, and the man that getth
[1:38:26] understanding. Amen. For the merchandise
[1:38:29] of it is better than the merchandise of
[1:38:33] silver, and the gain thereof find gold.
[1:38:37] Amen. Your character sir, what you have
[1:38:41] inside of you is going to manifest
[1:38:44] itself. Happy is a man that find it
[1:38:46] what. And that's not wisdom of the
[1:38:47] world. But you do need wisdom. You do
[1:38:50] need an education. Amen. Got to have it
[1:38:53] in this world. But you can pick and
[1:38:55] choose what your education will take you
[1:38:57] to. Everybody with me? Amen. For the
[1:39:01] merchandise of it is better than the
[1:39:03] merchandise of silver and the gain
[1:39:04] thereof of fine gold. You know, you got
[1:39:06] people now like Jeff Bezos and different
[1:39:08] ones that are into almost into the
[1:39:09] trillion dollars of wealth. If they're
[1:39:13] not born again, they ain't got no more
[1:39:15] money than you do. I think I do have $2
[1:39:17] in my
[1:39:19] pocket, but not
[1:39:22] really. So, there's a fine line between
[1:39:26] building a barn to put up stores for God
[1:39:29] and building a barn to put up stores for
[1:39:32] the world. Because we're going to meet a
[1:39:35] man that built bigger barns
[1:39:38] and he went to hell. That's right.
[1:39:41] Anybody with me? Matthew 19:16. And
[1:39:44] behold, one came and said unto him,
[1:39:46] "Good master, what good thing shall I do
[1:39:49] that I may have? eternal life." Now, we
[1:39:52] know this is about who? The rich young
[1:39:54] ruler. And we were talking back in the
[1:39:56] back. There is no place in the Bible it
[1:39:58] calls him a rich young ruler.
[1:40:01] You have to go to different places to
[1:40:03] find out he was rich and young and and
[1:40:05] I'm saying he was very spiritual.
[1:40:09] He kept every commandment. That's right.
[1:40:11] So listen, what good thing? So this is
[1:40:13] he's talking to the rich young ruler.
[1:40:15] Everybody with me? Rich young
[1:40:19] ruler, good master, what good thing
[1:40:21] shall I do that I may have eternal life?
[1:40:25] And he said unto him, why callst thou me
[1:40:28] good? There's none good but one and
[1:40:30] that's God. But if thou will enter into
[1:40:33] life, what keep if you were if you're
[1:40:36] going to enter into life, keep the
[1:40:38] commandments. Amen.
[1:40:41] He said unto him, which Jesus said, thou
[1:40:45] shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not
[1:40:46] commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
[1:40:48] Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor
[1:40:51] thy father and thy
[1:40:53] mother. Honor thy father and thy mother.
[1:40:57] Okay. Good place to start. Am I right,
[1:41:00] Kaylee? She's standing real close to her
[1:41:02] mama, so she had to say yes. Honor thy
[1:41:05] father, thy mother, and thou sh and
[1:41:06] look, and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:41:08] as thyself. It gets pretty
[1:41:10] rough. But the young man, here's where
[1:41:12] we get the young part. The young man
[1:41:15] saith unto him, all these things have I
[1:41:17] kept in a come to the message church
[1:41:19] since I was a little kid.
[1:41:23] Preach, believe. Well,
[1:41:27] I've done all them all them message
[1:41:30] commandments. Thou shalt not do this and
[1:41:32] thou shalt not have a TV and thou shalt
[1:41:34] not have Well, anyway, I'm just telling
[1:41:37] you that's what we were we were grown up
[1:41:38] with. It wasn't so much the Ten
[1:41:40] Commandments. It was so much to 10 don't
[1:41:42] wear dress. I mean, don't don't wear
[1:41:44] pants, don't cut your hair, don't wear
[1:41:46] this, don't have jewelry, do that's the
[1:41:48] ten commandments. I guess it was when we
[1:41:50] grew up, but there was the ten
[1:41:51] commandments in the Bible. Then they
[1:41:53] would not do the ten commandments that
[1:41:54] were in the Bible. Honor thy father and
[1:41:56] thy mother and thou shalt love thy
[1:41:58] neighbor as thyself. The young man, he
[1:42:00] had no hesitation. So he was a good
[1:42:02] church member. Everybody with me? He was
[1:42:04] a good church
[1:42:07] member. Went to church every
[1:42:15] Sunday. The young man saith unto him.
[1:42:17] Now he's talking to
[1:42:19] Jesus. Let me back up. He's talking to
[1:42:21] the good master. You're talking to
[1:42:22] Jesus. Anybody with me? He's talking to
[1:42:25] the Lord
[1:42:27] himself. All these things have I kept
[1:42:29] from my youth up. What lack I yet? He
[1:42:33] still didn't have the big revelation he
[1:42:37] needed. Jesus said unto him, if thou
[1:42:39] will be
[1:42:40] perfect and go and sell that thou hast
[1:42:43] and give to the poor, thou shalt have
[1:42:46] treasures in heaven, and come and follow
[1:42:50] me.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:54] Now listen, that does, let me
[1:42:56] interpretate that for you just for a
[1:42:57] minute. That doesn't mean we all got to
[1:42:59] go sell everything. Everybody with me?
[1:43:03] It says to sell out.
[1:43:06] That's right. Yourself. Amen. Sell
[1:43:09] yourself. Get out. Get out of the pawn
[1:43:12] shop. Amen. But you got to sell yourself
[1:43:16] to
[1:43:17] God. Read and study. That's when when
[1:43:20] somebody says, "Well, man, you could be
[1:43:21] making money on Sunday. You need to
[1:43:24] work." No, brother. I want to read my
[1:43:26] Bible and study. I want to go to church
[1:43:28] like the Bible tells me to do. Amen. So,
[1:43:32] when you take the two people, who you
[1:43:34] going to see? Now, remember, the story
[1:43:35] continues on a little bit later. You got
[1:43:37] Lazarus and you got that rich young
[1:43:39] ruler in hell.
[1:43:41] Right.
[1:43:44] And you know what happened? Lazarus over
[1:43:47] here was the beggar. He didn't have no
[1:43:49] money. He didn't have a place to lay his
[1:43:50] head. But this man over here had riches.
[1:43:53] Actually, he's come up here and he's
[1:43:54] going to build a bigger
[1:43:56] barn. But remember, he built the barn.
[1:44:01] That scripture before that, God said,
[1:44:02] "I'll give you barn."
[1:44:05] I'll give you stores to put in the barn.
[1:44:07] Now, if he gives you stores to put in
[1:44:08] the barn, he'll expand your barn as much
[1:44:11] as you want it expanded. But if you do
[1:44:13] it for your own self and for your own
[1:44:15] glory and for uh you know I'm going to
[1:44:17] be higher than this one because mine's
[1:44:18] bigger.
[1:44:22] Jesus said if thou will be perfect go
[1:44:23] and sell that thou hast give to the poor
[1:44:26] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:44:29] and come and follow me. In other words,
[1:44:31] what he's what he's saying just like I
[1:44:32] told you. Seek ye first. Everything's
[1:44:35] got to be scriptural. Seek ye first me.
[1:44:38] Me the kingdom of heaven. Me. Seek ye
[1:44:40] first me. follow me first.
[1:44:44] But when the young man heard that
[1:44:46] saying, he went away sorrowful, for he
[1:44:49] had great possessions. But remember,
[1:44:52] they were possessions that he got.
[1:44:56] Amen. That's the difference. Listen,
[1:44:57] that was possessions he got. If you let
[1:45:00] the possessions, brothers and sisters
[1:45:02] and kids and ones, if you let your
[1:45:05] possessions get in the way of his
[1:45:07] possessions, you're going to lose every
[1:45:10] time. Amen.
[1:45:12] Every time. That's right.
[1:45:14] The only way you want your barn bigger
[1:45:18] is that God give you something to put in
[1:45:20] it.
[1:45:22] Not what you put in. I did this. I me I
[1:45:26] I went away
[1:45:29] sorrowful. You know what he
[1:45:31] lost? You know what he lost in that one
[1:45:34] swift moment? He lost eternal life.
[1:45:37] Amen. He said, "What must I do to
[1:45:39] inherit eternal life?" Jesus said,
[1:45:42] "Amen."
[1:45:43] Right? Jesus
[1:45:45] said, "Sell everything and follow me."
[1:45:48] That was the last thing he said. Sell
[1:45:50] everything, follow me.
[1:45:52] He couldn't do that cuz he had built his
[1:45:55] own riches.
[1:45:57] He had built himself
[1:46:01] up. He went away sorrowful, for he had
[1:46:04] great possessions. Then Jesus said unto
[1:46:06] the disciples, "Verily I say unto you,
[1:46:08] that a rich man shall hardly enter in to
[1:46:10] the kingdom of heaven." Why? Because a
[1:46:12] rich man without the new birth, he leans
[1:46:15] to his riches and money every single
[1:46:19] time. Amen.
[1:46:22] Look at what I did. Look at what I
[1:46:26] done. But if you'll start and say,
[1:46:28] "Look, this is what God gave me." Amen.
[1:46:31] This is what God gave me. He gave me
[1:46:33] this college to go to. He gave me this
[1:46:35] job to go to.
[1:46:38] Luke 12:16 and then we'll
[1:46:43] finish. He spake a parable unto them,
[1:46:45] saying, "The ground of a certain rich
[1:46:47] man brought forth
[1:46:49] plentifully." And he thought, now watch,
[1:46:52] he thought within
[1:46:54] himself. He didn't ask God to help him.
[1:46:57] He's doing this all by himself.
[1:47:00] And listen, you can you can navigate
[1:47:02] yourself through life and you can get
[1:47:03] the right degree and you can get the
[1:47:05] right work, the right job, and you can
[1:47:06] make a fortune. Amen. This is a land of
[1:47:09] plenty.
[1:47:11] I wish every one of you, especially you
[1:47:13] kids, would go to a foreign country and
[1:47:16] spend a week. Amen. I mean, a
[1:47:20] impoverished foreign country. Amen.
[1:47:25] They don't have expendable money like we
[1:47:27] do. They don't get three pairs of shoes
[1:47:29] unless their brother and sister wore
[1:47:31] them first, right? Then they get them.
[1:47:36] That's why it's going to hit us hard cuz
[1:47:38] we're we're we're Americans. We have so
[1:47:40] much expendable income. I mean,
[1:47:43] wow. They do it to survive. We do it to
[1:47:46] play. And listen, it's okay. But if you
[1:47:49] let God do it, yes, it's all right.
[1:47:51] He'll make your barns bigger. Just like
[1:47:53] he did with Steuart Kathy and the
[1:47:54] different ones. I believe God led
[1:47:57] men. God's got a way to make his economy
[1:48:00] work.
[1:48:03] And he's going to use the people to get
[1:48:05] it.
[1:48:08] And he thought within himself, saying,
[1:48:09] "What shall I do? Cuz I have no room
[1:48:12] where to bestow my fruits. My my I I my
[1:48:16] my." And he said, "This will
[1:48:20] I
[1:48:21] do. I will pull down my barns and build
[1:48:24] greater, and there will I bestow all my
[1:48:28] fruits and my
[1:48:29] goods. And I will say to my soul, I I He
[1:48:34] ain't asked God for
[1:48:36] nothing. And I will say to my soul,
[1:48:39] soul, thou hast much good laid up for
[1:48:42] many years. Take thine ease, eat, drink,
[1:48:46] and be merry.
[1:48:49] But God steps in. That's right. But God
[1:48:52] said unto him, "Thou fool,
[1:48:55] this night thy soul shall be required of
[1:48:59] thee. Then whose shall those things be
[1:49:03] which thou hast
[1:49:06] provided?" So is he that layeth up
[1:49:08] treasure for himself and is not rich
[1:49:12] toward God.
[1:49:20] Young
[1:49:22] adults, seek God first.
[1:49:25] I know sometimes it's hard to do. Some
[1:49:28] of us wouldn't have made the mistakes we
[1:49:29] made. Let's stand to our feet. Some of
[1:49:30] us wouldn't have made the mistakes we
[1:49:32] made if we had not if we would have
[1:49:33] asked God first. Amen. Can everybody say
[1:49:35] amen? Amen.
[1:49:38] I mean, really.
[1:49:41] And I've ventured into things I knew,
[1:49:43] Brother Josie. I knew it was right. Oh,
[1:49:46] this is right. It might have been right
[1:49:48] to me, but it wasn't right for God cuz I
[1:49:50] didn't seek him
[1:49:52] first. I know some of you are going to
[1:49:54] go to college. Some of you going to get
[1:49:56] a
[1:49:57] job. That's fine. That's what you should
[1:49:59] do. And all the parents say, "Oh,
[1:50:03] see.
[1:50:06] Amen. We want you to be dependent on
[1:50:09] God."
[1:50:11] Listen, there's not a parent in here
[1:50:12] that wouldn't help all of our kids. And
[1:50:14] I'd help. I'll help you. I'd help your
[1:50:16] kids if I could do it. But all your
[1:50:18] parents. So, what about a a a father
[1:50:20] that makes no mistakes? A father that
[1:50:22] that has children that he's wanting to
[1:50:24] see develop. Children he's wanting to
[1:50:26] see mature. Children he's want to not
[1:50:28] have to just pet them all the
[1:50:32] time. Why you have to You don't have to
[1:50:34] pet a mature
[1:50:36] Christian. Babies, you still have to pet
[1:50:38] them, but not a mature Christian. That's
[1:50:40] what God wants. He wants his word to be
[1:50:43] in power in a group of people. The
[1:50:45] virtues working in a what? A body of
[1:50:49] believers that will take this thing and
[1:50:52] sweep it to a body change.
[1:50:55] Babies can't take body changes.
[1:51:00] I'm telling you. Nope.
[1:51:03] Jesus was a full grown adult before he
[1:51:04] had his body changed.
[1:51:07] Abraham was a full grown adult before he
[1:51:09] had his body changed. Everybody with me?
[1:51:13] You got to be the same way. You got to
[1:51:16] be grown. Grown up. Brother U Anderson
[1:51:20] and I were talking and I you may not
[1:51:24] agree with this, but
[1:51:26] um my dad was not one to chase people
[1:51:30] around and call you. If you were out of
[1:51:31] church two or three Sundays, he didn't
[1:51:32] call you and ask you where you were.
[1:51:35] And you say, "Well, sometimes you say,
[1:51:37] well, you know, he just didn't care."
[1:51:39] No, it wasn't that. If I've seen other
[1:51:42] pastors, I mean, if you didn't show up
[1:51:44] Wednesday night, they were they sent the
[1:51:46] police after you. And I'm not kidding. I
[1:51:49] mean, they would dog you and find out
[1:51:51] where you're at. What you doing? Why
[1:51:52] weren't you why weren't you at
[1:51:54] church? Why didn't you pay your tithe?
[1:51:56] Why didn't you know, just why didn't you
[1:51:58] do this? Well, if shame gets them back
[1:52:00] into church,
[1:52:04] something else will get them back out.
[1:52:05] Right. But if the word of God ever gets
[1:52:08] them back in and they get satisfied by
[1:52:10] the word of God and satisfied and be an
[1:52:12] adult and not have to be called every 15
[1:52:15] minutes, where you at? Where you been?
[1:52:16] What are you doing?
[1:52:18] You build good Christian people from
[1:52:20] that. You don't build babies.
[1:52:24] So, let's quit being
[1:52:27] babies. Do what the word of God said.
[1:52:30] You brothers and sisters that are going
[1:52:32] to college and are trying to get a job,
[1:52:34] seek God first.
[1:52:37] Seek the counsel of your parents. Don't
[1:52:39] seek the counsel of your
[1:52:40] neighbor. Cuz I hope you got Holy Ghost
[1:52:42] fil parents. And if you do, they'll help
[1:52:44] you way more than any psychologist will
[1:52:46] help you. I'm going to say it. They
[1:52:49] will.
[1:52:51] Psychologist just knows a book that
[1:52:53] ain't this one.
[1:52:55] Your parents know a book that's this
[1:52:57] one.
[1:52:59] Amen. God bless you. Now, we're going to
[1:53:01] go downstairs in a little bit and and um
[1:53:04] and we're going to celebrate with them,
[1:53:06] but listen, put God first in everything
[1:53:09] you do. It may be hard. Life is hard,
[1:53:15] but life is okay. We've made it through.
[1:53:18] We've had our ups and downs and ins and
[1:53:20] outs, but if you'll trust God, he'll
[1:53:23] show you the end. He'll show you what
[1:53:25] you're doing and why you're there. I
[1:53:27] promise you, he will. He's done it for
[1:53:29] many of us in this building today. Let's
[1:53:32] sing a song
[1:53:34] of
[1:53:36] heaven. Oh, feed me till I
[1:53:41] want no
[1:53:45] more. Here's my
[1:53:48] cup. Fill it up.
[1:53:54] Sing it to
[1:53:55] him.
[1:53:57] Oh, fill my cup up,
[1:54:02] Lord. I lift it up,
[1:54:09] Lord. Come and quench
[1:54:13] it. This
[1:54:15] thirst of my soul, soul.
[1:54:23] Bread of heaven,
[1:54:27] feed me till I will fill us up, Lord.
[1:54:31] Fill our barge. You fill our barns. Fill
[1:54:35] our You fill it with you. Fill it up and
[1:54:41] make me whole. Sing it to him.
[1:54:45] Lord, here's my cup. Fill my
[1:54:49] cup, Lord.
[1:54:52] I lift it up
[1:54:58] Lord.
[1:55:02] Come this
[1:55:04] thirsty of my
[1:55:10] soul. Pray of heaven.
[1:55:14] Oh, feed me care. I want no
[1:55:22] more. Here's my
[1:55:25] cup. Fill it
[1:55:28] up and make me.
[1:55:31] You know it says, "Come and quench this
[1:55:35] thirsting of my soul."
[1:55:37] God of the devil one is going to quench
[1:55:40] the thirst you have.
[1:55:43] Just pray that
[1:55:45] God fills that.
[1:55:48] And how do you get it? More of him.
[1:55:53] Fill me up, Lord.
[1:55:56] You know, I've got an eternal father. So
[1:55:57] do you.
[1:55:59] And having an eternal father, we can
[1:56:01] draw eternity from that father. I had a
[1:56:03] natural father. You have a natural
[1:56:05] father. They passed on. They're gone.
[1:56:08] Some are still here. But we're getting
[1:56:10] weaker and weaker and weaker. But
[1:56:11] there's a heavenly father that never has
[1:56:13] been one second
[1:56:15] older than when he said, "Let there be
[1:56:17] light."
[1:56:19] So he's here. Let us have what we need.
[1:56:22] Fill my
[1:56:24] cup,
[1:56:27] Lord. I lift it up, Lord.
[1:56:34] Come and quench
[1:56:37] it this
[1:56:39] thirsty of my
[1:56:45] soul. Bread of
[1:56:49] heaven. Feed me till I want no
[1:56:56] more. Take my cup.
[1:57:00] fill it up and make me whole.
[1:57:08] You know, I was talking to somebody the
[1:57:09] other day. The old saying is time and
[1:57:12] sight is man's worst enemy. And that's
[1:57:15] right. We've been here now 70 years
[1:57:17] since the prophets's been here, 60 years
[1:57:19] since the seal has been open. all these
[1:57:21] different times that we've been
[1:57:23] years years away from from you know
[1:57:27] there's probably not even many people
[1:57:28] alive that was with brother Brandham
[1:57:30] because they all passed
[1:57:32] away but he didn't say in the days of
[1:57:34] the body of the seventh
[1:57:37] angel he said in the days of the voice I
[1:57:40] was reading brother Brown the other day
[1:57:41] he said if they could devise something
[1:57:43] to to pick up your voice he said it just
[1:57:47] continues he said it's continuing all
[1:57:49] the time because what's going to happen
[1:57:51] is if you don't get that voice clean,
[1:57:53] then what's going to happen on the day
[1:57:54] of judgment? That's what's going to
[1:57:55] condemn you is your voice. That's what's
[1:57:59] going to condemn condemn you is your
[1:58:01] voice. But let's hear the voice of God
[1:58:02] now. The voice of God in the end time is
[1:58:05] his bride. The prophet messenger gone
[1:58:09] on. He's waiting on us. We have many
[1:58:11] that even in this church that are
[1:58:13] waiting on others. They're waiting on
[1:58:16] us. And
[1:58:18] my if we don't start feeling the pull,
[1:58:21] then we're just going to be here and be
[1:58:23] here. That's why I said, believe me if I
[1:58:26] tell you this, there's going to be
[1:58:28] somebody that every Sunday is going to
[1:58:30] walk up that statue of perfect man. It
[1:58:32] may be little bitty steps. It may be
[1:58:34] tiptoes, but somebody is going to make
[1:58:37] it to that full stature.
[1:58:40] And you just you say, "Well, how?"
[1:58:42] You've got everything you need. Amen.
[1:58:44] You got the road map.
[1:58:47] You got the prophet's message. You got a
[1:58:49] good five-fold ministry that can help
[1:58:50] you. You have no excuse. You have no
[1:58:53] excuse to do some of the things that we
[1:58:56] do. And that will what as me and brother
[1:58:58] Anderson were talking about iniquity.
[1:59:00] The Bible says iniquity will abound. You
[1:59:03] know what iniquity
[1:59:05] is? It's actually a hideous sin because
[1:59:09] it's a sin that you know you shouldn't
[1:59:11] do it and you do it
[1:59:14] anyway, right?
[1:59:16] or you don't do something and you know
[1:59:18] you should do it. That's iniquity.
[1:59:22] And he said it would abound.
[1:59:26] It'll be a barn full. Why? Because we're
[1:59:29] sometimes we think we're right in our
[1:59:30] own eyes. The only eyes we are right in
[1:59:33] is in God's
[1:59:34] eyes. And to the ones that are
[1:59:36] graduating, God bless you. We love you
[1:59:39] all. Go downstairs and enjoy yourself.
[1:59:40] There's some things down there for you.
[1:59:42] And there's cake and ice cream. Uh we
[1:59:45] appreciate all of you. Thank you all
[1:59:47] that are attending that have done
[1:59:48] something for them and and give them
[1:59:50] gifts to they'll cherish them and and um
[1:59:54] you may never know. It may just be you
[1:59:57] shaking their hand and say, "God bless
[1:59:58] you. We praying for you." That's worth
[2:00:00] way more than any money that's
[2:00:02] downstairs in a in a
[2:00:04] bag. And truthfully, do pray for them
[2:00:09] because it's hard. Every generation is
[2:00:12] hard. I went to a Where's Abby? I went
[2:00:15] to Aby's graduation. Not graduation, but
[2:00:18] it's a awards awards
[2:00:20] ceremony. And oh my folks, I'm telling
[2:00:22] you, I hate to say
[2:00:25] this, there was not enough cloth to
[2:00:28] cover some of them women plus
[2:00:31] two young kids, 17 and 18 years old,
[2:00:34] showing their yourself. Hundreds of
[2:00:37] them. And there said little Abby with a
[2:00:39] long
[2:00:40] hair, beautiful dress. walk up to get
[2:00:44] her award and you don't have to look up.
[2:00:48] Y'all seen
[2:00:50] it. And I'm ashamed. Do you see all
[2:00:52] these pe girls in the prom dresses? I
[2:00:54] hope I never see any of you like that
[2:00:56] cuz me and your parents going to have a
[2:00:57] problem, not
[2:00:59] you. Everybody with me? But that's what
[2:01:02] the world that's normal.
[2:01:04] That was a gymnasium or an auditorium
[2:01:07] full of people
[2:01:09] that didn't mind what them girls were
[2:01:11] wearing.
[2:01:13] I mean, some of them you just hoped wind
[2:01:15] didn't come by to blow the dress up. It
[2:01:18] was so short. Wasn't that right,
[2:01:20] Abby? Show their back, show their front.
[2:01:23] They don't
[2:01:25] care. But there was an example sitting
[2:01:27] there.
[2:01:29] There was an example sitting there. You
[2:01:30] sisters, you brothers, there was an
[2:01:32] example sitting there that's going to
[2:01:33] condemn that whole auditorium.
[2:01:39] That's why we need to walk careful.
[2:01:42] walk carefully around the world. Be a
[2:01:44] Christian. Don't do like a lot used to
[2:01:47] do.
[2:01:48] Um, even here a long time ago, they're
[2:01:52] not here anymore. But, Brother John,
[2:01:54] they carry a pair of pants with them in
[2:01:56] the in the car, girls. And soon as they
[2:02:00] got away from home, they'd stop and
[2:02:02] change their clothes to pants and then
[2:02:03] go to school. Well, see, that's a
[2:02:06] hypocrite. Don't do that.
[2:02:09] be the be be a be a an example all the
[2:02:12] time because what you were then is is
[2:02:14] you were a stumbling
[2:02:16] block to say I'm a Christian and I go to
[2:02:18] this church and then to be caught with
[2:02:21] this on. And that goes for all of us.
[2:02:24] Every one of us the same way. Not just
[2:02:26] one person, but all of us. And who's
[2:02:28] watching us more than even the world is?
[2:02:32] God. He watches you 24/7. That's why the
[2:02:36] Holy Ghost is there. It's to go back to
[2:02:38] the father and say, "Hey, they're doing
[2:02:40] good." Or, "Oh, you just really don't
[2:02:41] need to look this way right now. We got
[2:02:43] some work to do." And that's
[2:02:45] okay. If you realize you need
[2:02:48] work, but if you don't realize you need
[2:02:51] work, you're in a deception. Those
[2:02:52] people were in a deception in that
[2:02:54] auditorium letting those girls parade up
[2:02:58] there across the stage in the dress that
[2:03:00] they were
[2:03:01] in. It was horrible. It wasn't even just
[2:03:04] bad. It was horrible what those young
[2:03:07] young good-looking nice girls look like.
[2:03:11] It just looked like a a row of
[2:03:12] prostitutes. I'm sorry, but it did. Some
[2:03:16] were dressed decent. Some were not. But
[2:03:19] you know what? That's normal. They
[2:03:21] looked at Abby and thought, "Well, she's
[2:03:24] why is she doing that?" Well, because
[2:03:26] you know why? She's been raised right
[2:03:29] and she's been told and she believes
[2:03:32] what she believes and she didn't have to
[2:03:35] go change clothes after mama and daddy
[2:03:38] left to change into something else. I
[2:03:40] Anyway, God bless you. Love you.
[2:03:42] Appreciate you all. Parents, hang in
[2:03:46] there. You were a teenager one time
[2:03:49] before. Okay. So, let's just remember
[2:03:51] what we put our parents
[2:03:53] through, right? and just remember that.
[2:03:57] But God be with you. Thank you all for
[2:03:58] coming again. We'll uh pray and then
[2:04:00] we'll go downstairs. Dear heavenly
[2:04:02] father,
[2:04:03] Lord, thank you for giving us people to
[2:04:06] speak to. Thank you for the word of God
[2:04:08] that you give us in this hour, Lord,
[2:04:09] that we know the right road, we know the
[2:04:11] right vehicle, and we're looking at the
[2:04:13] signs, Father, and we're heading towards
[2:04:15] something that's a victory. It may look
[2:04:17] like a defeat, but we're not ever going
[2:04:19] to go down in defeat. The bride of Jesus
[2:04:21] Christ will never be defeated. Father, I
[2:04:24] pray that you'd be with each one here
[2:04:25] today, Lord, that has children and young
[2:04:28] adults that are going into their second
[2:04:30] phase of of study, Father, that you
[2:04:32] would uh as many would say that that um
[2:04:37] I know some here in this building does
[2:04:39] the the children and the parents pray
[2:04:41] before even they take a test. Just pray
[2:04:44] about it. Brother Brown did the same
[2:04:45] thing. pray about it and pray about all
[2:04:49] these things coming up. All these things
[2:04:50] that are that are so easily besetting
[2:04:53] like I said there Lord you know you you
[2:04:56] how do you look at this world and not
[2:04:58] destroy it as brother Ram said that time
[2:05:00] and then you took him behind a
[2:05:02] door and you showed him his
[2:05:05] sins. Lord, let us not condemn them so
[2:05:07] much to
[2:05:09] say that we're condemning them to hell,
[2:05:11] but we're condemning the thing the
[2:05:13] system that they're under. This worldly
[2:05:15] system is not of
[2:05:17] you. This word of God that that they've
[2:05:20] uh adopted out in the denominations
[2:05:23] that's just not you, Lord. And I pray,
[2:05:26] Lord, that they would see the light,
[2:05:28] that they would love you
[2:05:30] more. that they would ask you
[2:05:33] more of questions of what to do in
[2:05:36] life. And Lord, I pray that you'll give
[2:05:38] them gifts. Give them, Lord, you build
[2:05:40] the barns for
[2:05:41] them. And you fill them up, Father. As
[2:05:45] the song says, fill my cup. Well, fill
[2:05:46] us up, Lord. Fill their barns with good
[2:05:50] stuff, with good
[2:05:51] store. And Lord, may we give you the
[2:05:53] praise and honor and glory. and let the
[2:05:55] let the young adults, Lord, look up to
[2:05:58] you, Father, the author and finisher of
[2:06:00] their faith, Lord. We believe that
[2:06:02] you've given us these children, Lord.
[2:06:05] Even the ones that are weward that are
[2:06:06] not even here today, Lord. I know we all
[2:06:09] have them,
[2:06:10] family that's not serving the Lord.
[2:06:12] Well, Father, I pray that you would,
[2:06:14] Lord, stir them up, Lord. Let them see
[2:06:17] so much Christ in us that it'll go over
[2:06:19] to them. Lord, I pray that you'd be with
[2:06:21] the ones, Lord, that are sick and the
[2:06:24] ones that have to travel. Father, I pray
[2:06:25] that you'd be with them. Bless this day,
[2:06:28] Lord. Give us this day our daily bread.
[2:06:30] Forgive us of our trespasses. Father, we
[2:06:33] ask these things in Jesus name. Sanctify
[2:06:35] the food that's downstairs, Lord. May we
[2:06:37] have a good time in you. In Jesus name
[2:06:38] we pray. Amen. God bless you. You're
[2:06:40] dismissed.
