[8:02] March so you just remember
[8:05] her and I have no IDE I don't know what
[8:08] time it's supposed to be
[8:10] but I guess we'll be there in the
[8:12] morning
[8:13] but so
[8:15] uh Luke 12 starting with verse
[8:19] 35 and it says let your loins be GED
[8:22] about and your lights
[8:25] burning and you yourselves like unto men
[8:28] that wait for their lord when he will
[8:31] return from the wedding that when he
[8:33] cometh and knocketh he may they may open
[8:36] unto him immediately blessed are those
[8:39] servants whom the Lord when he cometh
[8:41] shall find watching verily I say unto
[8:43] you that he shall gir himself and make
[8:47] them to sit to meet and will come forth
[8:49] and serve them and if he shall come in
[8:53] in the second watch or in the Third
[8:55] Watch and find them so blessed are those
[8:58] ser servants and this know that if the
[9:01] Goodman of the house had known what hour
[9:04] the thief would have come he would have
[9:06] watched and not have suffered his house
[9:08] to be broken through be ye therefore
[9:10] ready also for the son of man cometh at
[9:13] an hour when you think not right then
[9:16] Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou
[9:18] this Parable unto us or even to all and
[9:22] the Lord said who then is that faithful
[9:24] and wise Steward who his Lord shall make
[9:28] ruler over his household to give them
[9:31] their portion of meat in due season
[9:33] blessed is that servant whom is Lord
[9:36] when he cometh shall find so doing of a
[9:40] truth I say unto you that he will make
[9:42] him ruler over all that he ha amen amen
[9:45] Lord bless the word you may be
[9:49] seated and uh yes sir appreciate
[9:54] it I'm like Bob I start talking and I
[9:58] get
[10:00] feels like I got a bunch of cotton in my
[10:02] mouth get to the point where I can't
[10:05] can't hardly don't feel like I can
[10:08] spit uh tonight I want to speak on a
[10:10] little thought called return
[10:13] Ministry
[10:16] and you know
[10:19] um you know a lot of people in the in
[10:21] the in the message ranks
[10:24] today you know there's a debate on on
[10:28] what's going to take place later
[10:30] on and you know many people have said
[10:32] well you know they're expecting brother
[10:34] brandom to come
[10:35] back you know they expect him to come
[10:38] back and and and do all these wonderful
[10:40] things that and you know uh we're going
[10:43] to put up a tent and you know he's going
[10:45] to speak our our body you know our body
[10:48] change into existence and you know he's
[10:50] going to speak some great word that's
[10:51] not been given to us yet that we've not
[10:54] received and that you know we're going
[10:55] to be able to go in the
[10:57] Rapture but you know
[10:59] you know it but but if you look in the
[11:02] scripture and everybody tries to take a
[11:05] a a type of and and look in the Bible
[11:08] and they try to pull some type out of
[11:10] the out of the scripture and try to PO
[11:12] you know propose a way that brother
[11:15] Bam's coming back but they break every
[11:17] type in the scripture by
[11:19] that you know John John
[11:23] came John the Baptist came and you know
[11:26] the and the the spirit of the Lord you
[11:28] know come upon him and you know he was
[11:30] told that you know upon whom he saw the
[11:33] Spirit descend like a dove and remain he
[11:36] said that would be the one that he was
[11:37] to introduce and you know you know John
[11:41] was standing there walking in the midst
[11:42] of them and you know he said right among
[11:44] you right now he said he said there's
[11:46] one who shoes I'm unworthy to unloose
[11:49] amen and you know you know as he was
[11:51] going on he said I baptize you with
[11:53] water but he said he'll come and baptize
[11:55] you with fire you know and and you know
[11:58] as as as time progressed and he saw the
[12:00] Spirit descend and when he saw the when
[12:03] he saw the Spirit descend Upon Jesus and
[12:06] when when this took place then he he you
[12:08] know introduced the people to the
[12:12] Messiah right but you know John still
[12:17] had
[12:18] followers the scripture talks about you
[12:20] know he still had followers that that he
[12:22] said I come to introduce you to this one
[12:25] and when he introduced them they still
[12:27] had their eyes on John still follow John
[12:30] because even brother bam talked about
[12:31] later on John had his eyes filmed over
[12:35] you know his Eagle Eye was kind of
[12:37] filmed over you know he couldn't see and
[12:39] you know he sent disciples to Jesus and
[12:41] asked them said are you the one or do we
[12:42] seek for another and brother said there
[12:45] in the scripture you talks about said
[12:46] you know he told him said you stay and
[12:48] wait and you see what takes place why
[12:51] because if the scripture doesn't speak
[12:53] of of what I was supposed to do you tell
[12:56] John what you see and he tells he said
[12:59] if it's not the if it's not the
[13:00] Fulfillment of the word then you look
[13:02] for for another one but if it is the
[13:05] Fulfillment of the word then you tell
[13:06] him what you seen because he knew by
[13:08] what the word said if the word come to
[13:10] pass then it was the right one and you
[13:13] know and then and in time as you know he
[13:15] come along you know John said he said I
[13:17] must decrease that he might increase why
[13:20] because he kept pointing them to the one
[13:22] with then when Jesus came along then he
[13:24] had great things to say about John he
[13:26] stood there and said there was none born
[13:28] of woman as great as John was why
[13:30] because John came to introduce the one
[13:33] that was to to fulfill God's great plan
[13:37] and so here he comes to to do this and
[13:40] you know and there was a a great
[13:43] move but you know that wasn't what God
[13:46] had en
[13:47] envisioned John done his part he left
[13:50] the scene yes sir and you know and then
[13:54] Jesus was to carry on and you know even
[13:57] today we see you know we had we've had a
[13:59] great ministry you know we we've had
[14:02] we've had the probably the greatest
[14:03] Ministry of of all is going through the
[14:06] scripture other than the Lord Jesus I
[14:08] believe because you know all the things
[14:10] that went through because as we've heard
[14:13] the brother Dale
[14:14] preaching you know speaking speaking of
[14:17] all the things that took place in the
[14:18] scripture when he speaking of the son of
[14:21] man you know nobody nobody else preached
[14:23] about the son of man except for Jesus
[14:25] identifying himself but then you know it
[14:27] came to a Time
[14:29] now you know he wasn't he wasn't
[14:31] revealed as as son of son of man but you
[14:35] know you know it really stood out
[14:37] because you know he he was always the
[14:39] son of
[14:41] man why because you know he never lost
[14:44] he never lost any of his uh attributes
[14:47] he never gained any attributes he always
[14:49] was the son of man and when he was all
[14:51] way he was the son of man all the way
[14:53] down through the church ages but you
[14:55] know what he could only be revealed as
[14:57] the son of God but you know it came back
[15:00] that he had to come back at some point
[15:01] in time and reveal himself as the son of
[15:04] man in the in this in the message the
[15:06] masterpieces brother R was speaking you
[15:08] know he was talking about in the
[15:09] beginning you know he was Alpha and
[15:11] Omega see in the beginning he was the
[15:13] fullness because he was he was the
[15:15] fullness of the word made manifest
[15:19] bodily and so there he was he was the
[15:22] fullness of the godhead bodily he was
[15:24] the alpha he was that he was that seed
[15:27] that came forth that was to go into the
[15:29] ground and and then he was wanting it to
[15:31] become in a multiplied form and if it
[15:34] was supposed to come in a multiplied
[15:36] form then then he came forth and then he
[15:38] had then it came into
[15:40] reproduction and then as as it came into
[15:43] uh reproduction then then he then he had
[15:46] more of that seed but you know as as
[15:49] Wade brought out so wonderfully you know
[15:50] he was going down through the through
[15:52] the church ages but you know what it
[15:54] became in a multiplied form and it could
[15:56] only become in the last day that could
[15:59] be the fullness of godhead bodily
[16:01] because without them we cannot be made
[16:03] perfect and without us they can't be
[16:05] made perfect as the scripture
[16:08] says see we can't you know people people
[16:11] you know it really bugs me but you know
[16:13] a lot of people you know they they want
[16:14] to put everybody else
[16:16] down you know what you would never we
[16:19] wouldn't be where we are today if we
[16:20] didn't have Martin Luther if we didn't
[16:22] have John Wesley if we didn't have
[16:24] Columba and all the other ones and they
[16:26] stood up for what portion of light they
[16:28] but you know that was that was their
[16:33] job and you many times you know they say
[16:35] well this one's false and that one's
[16:37] false no the truth they had truth right
[16:40] and it became manifest right
[16:43] Amen Brother D was speaking of speaking
[16:46] of uh Revelation chapter one and he said
[16:50] you know he said in the you see he said
[16:52] John
[16:53] looked and you know he turned and he
[16:55] looked and he said he saw the golden
[16:57] candlesticks there said and he said he
[16:59] saw one standing in the midst of the
[17:00] golden candlesticks he said like unto
[17:03] the son of man and he said you know he
[17:05] saw that one he said and then brother
[17:06] Dev was bringing out how he stood in the
[17:08] midst of it you know and everybody's
[17:10] like well he should have been you know
[17:11] caral should have been more in the
[17:12] beginning than he was in the end or in
[17:14] the beginning or what but you know if
[17:16] you go to Revelation Chapter 2 the one
[17:18] thing that really stucked out to me was
[17:19] where he went to I went to in my mind he
[17:22] went to Revelation Chapter 2 because in
[17:24] Revelation Chapter 2 when it speaks of
[17:26] the Church of Ephesus it says that the
[17:29] son of he said he that walketh in the
[17:31] midst of the golden candlesticks so he's
[17:33] not just standing in the midst of the
[17:34] golden candlesticks but he's walking in
[17:36] the midst of the Gog why because the
[17:38] church was moving on and so he wasn't
[17:40] just standing there but he was walking
[17:42] with them he was in them and so he was
[17:44] moving through the church ages and so
[17:47] you know he was always there but he only
[17:50] brought forth the portion of word that
[17:52] he was supposed that he had for that day
[17:56] right and it wasn't and so so they
[17:58] didn't have a a they had the fullness of
[18:01] the word for their day and as it
[18:03] continued
[18:04] on they made it manifest amen right just
[18:08] as as just as as we' they've been
[18:10] covering the
[18:12] seed you know each part of that each
[18:15] part of that life that even even when it
[18:18] goes into the ground and dies you know
[18:20] that's a process that's part of that
[18:22] same life right
[18:25] amen it's got to go there and it's got
[18:28] to it's got to be buried it's got to be
[18:29] watered it's got to be
[18:31] hid amen and then it can start to come
[18:35] forth
[18:36] amen see we you know it's each one of
[18:39] those little pieces as it come along and
[18:41] and developed see that was that was the
[18:44] that was the life that was the word
[18:46] right and then it came to the
[18:50] fullness but that's what God had in his
[18:53] mind and many people have missed that
[18:56] right amen
[18:59] Y and theyve they've put it
[19:02] aside but I'm so glad that you know we
[19:05] we've had the truth in our day that we
[19:06] can see right I and I appreciate that
[19:10] because you know I I I we couldn't be
[19:12] where we are today if we didn't have
[19:14] those the forefathers that have come
[19:17] along and brought the word to us in in
[19:19] our
[19:20] day and you just pray for
[19:23] me as
[19:26] a I got a lot of see in a lot of
[19:29] different lot of different ways to go
[19:31] but I'm just trying
[19:32] to just follow the follow the lord as as
[19:37] we come through here
[19:38] but you know
[19:42] there I just want to
[19:46] see that in in our day from the from our
[19:50] scripture reading and and understanding
[19:52] what what we've seen that you know we
[19:57] have a
[19:58] brother brandham done his
[20:01] part and then it come time for us to do
[20:03] our part just as each one of each one
[20:06] them all down through time has done
[20:07] their part you know brother brandom
[20:10] speaks in uh in the in the church age
[20:13] book and you know he he says that uh the
[20:16] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10
[20:19] he said he come to do two things right
[20:22] and you know those two things he said
[20:23] you know to turn the children the heart
[20:26] of the children back to the fathers and
[20:28] he said he said then he be he come to
[20:31] reveal the word he said he said through
[20:33] the revealing of the word he said
[20:35] through these Divine mystery truths he
[20:38] said he' literally turn their hearts
[20:39] back to the Pentecostal fathers so
[20:42] there's a there's a Time see he came and
[20:45] you know brother brandham said and I
[20:47] think it's the SE does not air with the
[20:49] Shu I may be wrong about that but you
[20:51] know brother brandom is where he said
[20:52] brother brother Ram said the bride would
[20:55] vindicate Malachi 4
[20:58] Luke 17:30 re Revelation 10:7 all these
[21:02] scriptures that are in the scripture he
[21:03] said the bride would vindicate that see
[21:06] brother Brenham came and done his part
[21:08] just like the rest of them done their
[21:10] part and you know brother Brenham came
[21:12] to a certain came to his part his
[21:14] portion of the word but you know what
[21:16] that seed has not come to maturity right
[21:20] there's seed but you know what it's
[21:22] still got to come to maturity because
[21:23] that's what he's waiting on brother
[21:25] brandom says many times he said he's
[21:27] waiting on you and me he's waiting on us
[21:31] he said he said all of creation is
[21:33] waiting on
[21:35] usen he said you know brother R said the
[21:38] only thing that he could see that was
[21:39] holding off the Rapture was the
[21:41] Readiness of the Bride on brother so you
[21:44] know brother we we've we've had our part
[21:47] come on but you know what you can't find
[21:49] you can't find a type in the scripture
[21:52] where you you've got brother brandham
[21:54] coming back come on right he done his
[21:58] heart you know the and I maybe we'll get
[22:01] to some quotes later on but you know and
[22:03] and even when you get into U Christ the
[22:06] mystery you know he talks about the
[22:08] fullness of the word he said he come to
[22:11] make it plain to reveal the word to make
[22:13] it plain he said the word has been made
[22:15] known
[22:17] right you know he said he said he he
[22:19] come to equip the bride on you know in
[22:22] his early Ministry and I have and I have
[22:24] that
[22:25] quote brother Bram speaking of uh
[22:28] here it is is number three present stage
[22:30] of my
[22:32] Ministry he says because he he's
[22:35] speaking he said well you know all men
[22:36] have forsaken me he said but you know
[22:39] there's one thing he said I wasn't
[22:40] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[22:43] that's happened down there on the river
[22:44] I've stayed true to it it's been true to
[22:46] me I'm trusting in Him someday I don't
[22:48] know when for a crowning of my Ministry
[22:51] I'll stay just as true as I could be I
[22:52] don't
[22:54] know what it'll be I don't know when
[22:57] it'll be but when he's ready I am now
[23:00] look here I hope he'll Crown my Ministry
[23:02] with this of letting me take the cloves
[23:05] of the word and dress his bride in the
[23:07] clothes of the word for his
[23:09] righteousness he said I hope he'll Crown
[23:11] me and let me stand there on that day
[23:14] and say Behold the Lamb of God that
[23:16] takes away the sin of the world and you
[23:18] know one of the things and you know and
[23:20] I read things and and things stand out
[23:22] to me and it may stand it may stand out
[23:24] to you differently and that's all right
[23:27] I'm just I'm just going to what I what I
[23:28] see and what I feel what I believe and
[23:30] and if y'all don't like it I'm I'm sorry
[23:32] but you know it's just what I feel but
[23:33] you know what what struck me when I read
[23:35] this is because he says he said I come
[23:38] to take the bride and he said I'm taking
[23:39] the clothes of the word and I'm going to
[23:41] dress her in his righteousness and then
[23:43] he doesn't say that I come to see the
[23:46] bride on he said Behold the Lamb of God
[23:51] why because when she gets clothed in his
[23:52] righteousness and his word it's no
[23:54] longer looking at a bride but we're
[23:56] going to see him all
[23:58] right
[24:00] Hallelujah that's what we're going to
[24:01] see we're going to see because see it's
[24:03] going to be us amen him made manifest
[24:07] it's not going to be looking we're not
[24:09] be looking for a
[24:11] bride just as John stood there and he
[24:14] said you know he tried to describe the
[24:15] bride and he described the city and he
[24:17] tried to describe the city and he
[24:19] described the bride how many times is
[24:21] brother they was you know been coming
[24:23] back and telling us you know we are him
[24:26] right and what speaks of him speaks of
[24:28] us and here he come he said he comeing
[24:30] this last day and you know this is 1962
[24:33] and then you know he says I'm hoping to
[24:35] wrap the bride dress the bride well then
[24:37] later on you know he speaks of he tells
[24:39] us that you know he the bride has
[24:42] received the word we received the word
[24:45] the the seals have been open so we've
[24:47] received the fullness right that's right
[24:50] he said he said I'm not saying that he's
[24:52] coming he said I'm saying that he's here
[24:55] am so there so there's nothing left left
[24:58] to be done
[25:00] right but he said he said that the bride
[25:03] would do something
[25:11] amen and questions and answers on the SE
[25:13] that's brother number five brother
[25:16] Joe I say I started out in a certain
[25:19] order and I'm bouncing around
[25:21] but I may get back to him I don't know
[25:25] question answerers on the SE I said
[25:26] would the would the Bride of Christ
[25:28] would the bride of Christ have a
[25:30] Ministry before the
[25:33] Rapture he said sure he said that's
[25:36] what's going on right now see the bride
[25:38] of Christ it is the message of the hour
[25:43] see see somebody would the would the
[25:46] bride have a ministry right he said the
[25:49] ministry is going on right
[25:52] now he said it's the message of the hour
[25:54] the bride of Christ sure see she
[25:56] consists of Apostles prophets teachers
[25:58] evangelists and pastors that's right
[26:00] that's the bride of Christ sure she's
[26:01] got a Ministry great ministry it's the
[26:03] ministry of the hour it'll be so humble
[26:07] right he says now remember how many was
[26:10] here it goes last Sunday he said
[26:13] remember we skip down right here it says
[26:15] hum remember what I preached on humility
[26:17] remember when God predicts anything
[26:19] great to happen the people are looking
[26:21] so far away by their wisdom that they
[26:24] miss what happens when God says anything
[26:28] is great the world laughs at it that
[26:30] bunch of ignoramuses that's right but
[26:32] when the great world and the great High
[26:35] Church said boy that's marvelous God
[26:37] said a bunch of ignoramuses so say you
[26:39] have to watch I don't mean it maybe of
[26:42] that way exactly that way but that's the
[26:44] way it
[26:46] is so when it was when it's
[26:50] great it's
[26:53] humble
[26:55] exactly it'll be so humble right and
[26:58] that's what'll be great you know he goes
[27:00] on he speaks of
[27:03] John you know and you know everybody
[27:06] thought it was going to be some some
[27:07] great wondrous happening yeah and they
[27:10] thought it was some lunatic come out of
[27:11] the woods right and they missed him and
[27:14] yet he fulfilled the scripture right and
[27:17] they had missed
[27:18] him and so we see it's going to be it
[27:22] it's taking place right now but it'll be
[27:24] so humble right and you know many people
[27:27] people will miss it they walk right past
[27:30] it right as he said he said they'll just
[27:33] turn it
[27:36] downen this is uh this is a quote from
[27:39] works as Faith
[27:43] expressed this is number one brother
[27:47] Joe he said just seeds has have to the
[27:51] ground prepared first therefore he said
[27:53] all he for knew he called all he called
[27:56] he for knew he predestinated
[27:58] if you want to read that Ro it's Romans
[28:00] 82834 also Ephesians 1-5 see all he
[28:04] forew he did call all he called he
[28:06] justified and all he justified he is
[28:09] already
[28:09] glorified he said there's nothing out of
[28:12] order we went there we think there is
[28:15] but look in the scripture it's just
[28:18] hitting exactly the way God's word said
[28:20] it would that's right we see the message
[28:22] is rejected today isn't that just what
[28:25] the scriptures said they would do sure
[28:27] all these things are ordained of God he
[28:30] said oh it should make you walk happy
[28:33] that's the trouble with we today so much
[28:36] differ than the Christians of old when
[28:38] the real true revelation of Jesus Christ
[28:41] being Emanuel dwell in the hearts of
[28:43] those men they were rugged people but
[28:46] today we're patted by denominations with
[28:48] oh I tell you they ain't got the
[28:50] Revelation come over here you come over
[28:54] here and you know that's the way it is
[28:56] today
[28:59] right right
[29:02] and I was listening listening the way
[29:05] other
[29:08] Wednesday and you know he said something
[29:10] that was very
[29:12] striking and you know he said he said
[29:14] you wait he said Satan will put somebody
[29:16] in this message he said the people are
[29:18] going to flock after
[29:22] oh and you
[29:24] know you know just to tell you wait and
[29:26] now we're Somewhere listening to someone
[29:29] speak and you know they told
[29:31] us they told us said if somebody come
[29:35] and started doing the had a Ministry
[29:36] like brother BR they'd have to follow
[29:40] it they would be following that and they
[29:43] would
[29:46] just but what but it's not it's not the
[29:49] great signs and wonders and
[29:52] miracles I said you know because Satan
[29:55] Satan can impersonate all of that but
[29:58] what but what is he what is he saying
[30:00] what is he bringing forth what is what
[30:01] is the
[30:03] message because that's what that's what
[30:05] is the most important because people
[30:08] have missed that right
[30:11] amen and you know you you see all the
[30:13] way through the through the minist
[30:15] through the message today through the
[30:17] ministry right right all around all
[30:20] around the message and you know I was
[30:24] thinking today that you know there was a
[30:26] there was a
[30:28] time there was a time in this message
[30:31] that the things that the things that
[30:33] have that have taken place the things
[30:35] that people do and the things that
[30:36] people say around this message said you
[30:39] know they they would prefer you to have
[30:41] their their tongue cut out than for them
[30:44] to say these things right and now they
[30:47] say them without with Reckless
[30:49] abandon they don't even they don't even
[30:53] care you know it it struck me you know
[30:56] white was speaking of of the you know
[30:58] the man said I wish brother venam hadn't
[31:00] said that yeah you
[31:03] know I mean it's
[31:07] mindboggling right I mean there was
[31:09] there was a time that that if you come
[31:11] up there and and said anything contrary
[31:13] sometimes even halfway contrary to what
[31:15] brother Bram said they don't want to
[31:16] fight
[31:18] you excuse
[31:20] me right and now and now they say well I
[31:23] don't
[31:24] know and then they've come along and you
[31:26] know you you wonder if people even
[31:28] believe even believe the message anymore
[31:32] right you know because we've seen in in
[31:35] the ministers
[31:37] meetings when you know you you have
[31:39] these people and you know they bring up
[31:41] they bring up topics and it's like is is
[31:44] there really any need to bring these
[31:45] things up and discuss
[31:49] them you know the things the way the the
[31:52] way a Christian should should conduct
[31:55] their life should you know it let lays
[31:57] in black and white right amen and if it
[32:00] and if it lays in black and white you
[32:02] know that's all you have to do is read
[32:04] it it doesn't it doesn't need to be
[32:06] discussed it doesn't need but see that
[32:08] that's you know that's the way they do
[32:10] it they come in and then they're going
[32:11] to cut away here and cut away there you
[32:15] know people people have taken the
[32:16] message and then you know they they say
[32:18] well you know this part of it was
[32:20] brother R was speaking to the
[32:21] Pentecostals and this this was for this
[32:23] group over here and this is for this
[32:25] group over here and by the time they
[32:27] putting putting portions of the message
[32:29] out over the pl all over the place guess
[32:31] what there's no message for
[32:33] them why because they' done away with it
[32:37] that's
[32:39] right and you know because if if you
[32:42] know the only person that I know of that
[32:44] was Vindicated was the prophet there was
[32:47] nobody else Vindicated right I I sure I
[32:50] certainly wasn't
[32:52] Vindicated and you know how can I take
[32:54] take my and put my own try to put my own
[32:56] interpret ation to
[32:58] it but I mean if it's in black and white
[33:01] then then why is it that you know you
[33:03] come up with these you know these silly
[33:06] doctrines and you you go through the
[33:09] message and you know they just pile up
[33:11] oh yeah
[33:13] yeah and and it's and it's very sad to
[33:16] see but you know people you know they
[33:18] want to know what you
[33:21] believe well if if I can find it in
[33:23] black and
[33:25] white and and that's all I have to do is
[33:29] take what he said why because you know
[33:32] he's obligated to reveal the word to
[33:35] us I can say well Lord you you've said
[33:38] it and I'm just going to hold on to it
[33:39] because you said a real true Eagle would
[33:41] understand right come on so I'm just
[33:43] going to hold
[33:45] on but see the thing is is if we try to
[33:48] put our own interpretation to it and we
[33:50] find some portion of the word over here
[33:52] that says one thing and this portion
[33:53] over here says something different and
[33:55] it looks totally different and it looks
[33:57] like it's you know conflicting each
[33:59] other and you know it's it's cont
[34:01] contradicting each other and it's like
[34:03] well you know we're just going to decide
[34:04] which part that we want to deal with we
[34:06] want to take this one over here we want
[34:08] to take that one over there or you know
[34:10] we want to take what brother bandom said
[34:11] after the seals and everything else was
[34:13] just you know goes by the wayside
[34:17] yeah and you know they've laid it all
[34:19] aside but you know I think you can take
[34:21] what he said all the way back to 1947
[34:24] and it dovet tales with what he said in
[34:26] 6 five It lines up perfectly but the
[34:29] thing is it takes the Holy Ghost to do
[34:31] that and it doesn't it doesn't take me
[34:33] it doesn't take anybody else but the
[34:36] thing is is you know we need to sit and
[34:38] wait on him to come and speak the word
[34:40] to us and then he'll make it
[34:42] known but see the thing is is we' we've
[34:45] tried to put as he says you know they
[34:48] rejected the message they've put him on
[34:50] the outside right and it's supposed to
[34:53] be it's supposed to be the
[34:55] message
[34:57] but you know what we've got more
[34:58] denominations in the
[35:01] message and you know as he sat here and
[35:03] work in this in this quote you know he
[35:06] said you know he said but we're padded
[35:07] by
[35:08] denominations oh I tell you they ain't
[35:10] got the Revelation you come over here
[35:14] yeah oh yeah you know they they've got
[35:17] all kinds of
[35:20] groups and you know they they lay this
[35:22] aside and lay that
[35:24] aside and you know that's the reason
[35:27] that's the reason that the things that
[35:30] take place and you know I was speaking
[35:32] to a brother years ago
[35:35] and you know he he told me something he
[35:37] said he said you watch a a
[35:41] church he said when When sin takes place
[35:44] in the congregation and he said it's not
[35:46] called out right and he said it's not
[35:49] dealt
[35:50] with he said when the pastor Gets behind
[35:53] the pull pit and he and he just goes
[35:55] condones it
[35:57] and he doesn't say anything he said you
[35:59] watch what that preacher starts
[36:00] preaching he said the next thing you
[36:02] know it's false Doctrine yeah he said
[36:05] why because when you give when you give
[36:07] Satan a foothold then he'll take
[36:10] over amen and see that's the reason
[36:12] that's the reason that brother random
[36:13] said you know it was it's so important
[36:16] see a pastor job is such a serious
[36:19] position why because he's got to call
[36:21] this out he's got to come in and and
[36:23] straighten these things out and don't
[36:26] wonder brother said you know people
[36:27] people don't want the gifts
[36:31] yeah because you know if if the gifts
[36:33] were put in the body to keep it
[36:35] clean they sure don't want to do that
[36:38] because they sure don't want to deal
[36:39] with
[36:41] it because they just want to they just
[36:43] want to play Church they just want to
[36:45] pet these little their little Devils
[36:47] these little doctrines that's right and
[36:50] you know and then we got other people
[36:51] that you know they don't even study
[36:53] enough to
[36:55] know they've not even they don't even
[36:57] stay and they just sink they just
[36:58] swallow everything hookline and
[37:04] sinker you know and I understand where
[37:07] Brother
[37:08] D was coming from you know he said you
[37:10] know he just he didn't he didn't want to
[37:13] go out there and try to preach to
[37:14] anybody he didn't want to go out and try
[37:16] to try to tell anybody he said just
[37:19] going to be right here he preach if they
[37:21] want to see it then they're welcome to
[37:25] it but you know then then they they can
[37:28] make their own choice right but the word
[37:31] has been made known amen the word has
[37:33] been revealed
[37:35] yes see we've received the word
[37:40] right that's the reason that's the
[37:41] reason I say that I'm so blessed because
[37:43] what we've received here and at this
[37:46] church what we've received here because
[37:48] you know it is so it's so wonderful
[37:52] righta because that's that's that's what
[37:55] is I have a desire for to see more of
[37:59] God to see what God has brought to us
[38:02] that we can see these
[38:10] things this is
[38:13] from try to get through is your life
[38:15] worthy of the Gospel brother R was
[38:19] speaking this is number two brother Joe
[38:22] said now Jesus here is saying he said
[38:24] man has always tried to make excuses not
[38:26] to receive God's word of his invitation
[38:29] he said though it be firmly proven to
[38:32] them that it's his supper and his
[38:35] invitation but man is constantly making
[38:38] excuses he said and if you read St
[38:40] Matthew 22 you'll find out the excuses
[38:42] were made there also he said it went
[38:45] back into all ages went back into the
[38:47] age and he said a man bid them and had a
[38:51] Vineyard we find that ver that Parable
[38:54] and how he sent his servants to collect
[38:56] from his his Vineyard he said first
[38:58] servant come what they do they run him
[39:01] off the next servant come they also
[39:04] stoned him and they run servant after
[39:08] servant the cruel man the king sent
[39:11] finally his son and when his son come he
[39:13] found we found out that they said this
[39:16] is an heir we'll kill him then we'll
[39:19] have all things Jesus said unto them the
[39:21] king sent forth and slew those murderers
[39:24] and burnt their City he said now we see
[39:27] when God gives a man an invitation and
[39:29] to do something to receive the
[39:31] invitation that he's given and he turns
[39:34] it down there's nothing left after Mercy
[39:36] right is spurn but judgment if you step
[39:39] over the boundaries of Mercy then
[39:40] there's only one thing left and that is
[39:42] Judgment we find out that man has done
[39:44] that in all ages as happened in most
[39:47] every age in the
[39:49] Bible so that's what has
[39:55] happened he's made made he's made the
[39:58] invitation man has received this
[40:04] invitation but as he
[40:07] said they've not wanted to receive it
[40:10] but it's been made known
[40:16] am
[40:18] so you know as as brother Brandon was
[40:22] saying you know God has made it known
[40:25] and he's given everybody this
[40:27] opportunity right and you know all you
[40:30] have to do is turn down one portion of
[40:32] the word it's not it's not the ones that
[40:35] have not heard it's not the ones that
[40:37] have been bound by false Doctrine but
[40:40] it's the ones that have heard the real
[40:42] truth right and they've turned it down
[40:45] he said then they've received judgment
[40:48] that's that's that's where they've come
[40:50] to but you know we have received the
[40:53] word and it is up to us whether what
[40:56] we're going to do with it we have to
[40:58] make that decision that's right but you
[41:00] know I thank God that we've received
[41:02] this word it's been taught to us we it's
[41:06] it's come in its fullness and you know
[41:08] there's there's many things that as
[41:10] brother Dale was
[41:12] speaking you know it it's com into this
[41:17] fullness and you know to see who we are
[41:20] and to see what God has
[41:22] done you know because if if we can see
[41:26] what what we've received brother brandom
[41:29] said and I can't see if I can find the
[41:32] quote but you know he said you have to
[41:36] know you has to know you have to know
[41:39] who you are and what you're
[41:41] doing
[41:43] exactly I was going to see I can't
[41:47] find but you know he said you you've got
[41:50] to know who you are and what you're
[41:51] doing you've got to you've got to know
[41:53] the word and if you don't know the word
[41:55] you don't know what you're going to be
[41:56] doing but you know we received this
[41:59] word and you know brother Rand was
[42:01] speaking in in in Christ the mystery and
[42:05] you know he's speaking of this message
[42:07] coming and you know the the fullness
[42:09] coming to the bride the fullness coming
[42:13] and then you know he said as as we see
[42:16] through the scripture he said all that
[42:17] God was he poured into
[42:20] Christ and you you know then we see that
[42:23] he said all that that Christ was he
[42:25] poured into the church he said he poured
[42:27] into the bride but you know brother goes
[42:30] on to say there in Christ the mystery
[42:32] and and a couple other quotes he goes on
[42:35] and you know he says all that God was he
[42:37] poured into the believer right and and
[42:40] proof of his
[42:42] resurrection he said all that God was he
[42:45] poured it's number eight brother Joe all
[42:47] that God all that was in God was poured
[42:51] out in Christ and all that was in Christ
[42:53] was emptied out into the believer the
[42:55] church God is with you Lord I'm with
[42:57] thee always even to the end of the world
[43:00] that's the direct Declaration of God's
[43:02] word that's what the Bible says that's
[43:04] what I believe and in number nine
[43:07] Jehovah Gyra 1964 I love this one
[43:10] everything that was in God God poured
[43:12] into Christ everything that was in
[43:13] Christ he poured into the to the
[43:15] believer God above us God With Us and
[43:17] God in us everything every promise in
[43:20] the book is yours if you believe it if
[43:22] you have faith enough to accept it and
[43:25] believe it amen exactly because you know
[43:27] he's he's poured it out to
[43:30] us and you
[43:32] know I've been working on I've been
[43:34] working on air compressors at work and
[43:36] trying to trying to do some trying to
[43:39] put some valves and everything in it and
[43:41] you know air one there's giant air
[43:43] compressors you know they have automatic
[43:45] U blow down valves that the when uh you
[43:48] know when you compress air you build up
[43:50] moisture build up water yeah the valves
[43:53] in it you know they dump all the water
[43:54] out of them well I'm I'm the one dumping
[43:56] all the water out of them and you know
[43:59] you just and and so you know when you
[44:01] get to a part A P uh when you start
[44:04] emptying those compressors out you know
[44:05] they get to a a a place that when
[44:08] they're dumping all the water out you
[44:09] just get water and you get water and you
[44:12] get water and then the P there's a at
[44:14] get toward the end when you get you get
[44:16] no more water you get a
[44:19] bath because the air blows out and it
[44:21] blows all the water all over you but you
[44:24] know that's what you know I was thinking
[44:26] that you know he's pouring it out right
[44:28] you know he said all that God was he
[44:30] poured out he's poured out he's poured
[44:32] into us and you know you see when you
[44:35] think of water as as being poured out
[44:38] and you know you just think well that
[44:40] can't be anymore and it just it just
[44:42] goes and goes and goes and when you're
[44:46] filling up five gallon buckets you don't
[44:47] think it's ever going to end but it's
[44:49] just more and more and more and you know
[44:52] that's the way God is because you think
[44:54] well you've reached the end and there's
[44:55] no there's more and there's more and
[44:58] there's more exactly see you you know as
[45:01] as Brother D was speaking of one time
[45:03] and you know he was speaking on uh
[45:05] multiplying and and dividing of God you
[45:08] know as reproducing and and dividing of
[45:11] God you know when you when you get one
[45:13] portion of God you know it it's infinite
[45:16] in it's in its ability and and because
[45:18] it has everything that is of god in that
[45:21] one portion because in that in you know
[45:23] because you received it by measure but
[45:26] that one part that you've received has
[45:28] has everything that of God in it that's
[45:31] right and so you know you received it
[45:32] but you know what it's infinite it's
[45:35] infinitees in its power and all that it
[45:37] can
[45:39] do you know because you know brother
[45:41] Dale was speaking of you know and the
[45:44] only way I I see it is you know I see
[45:45] numbers and you know when you get in
[45:48] when you get in you start talking about
[45:49] Infinity yeah and you know when you see
[45:52] that one part you can take you can say
[45:55] you know you just take you know always
[45:57] ask people how many numbers are there
[45:58] between the numbers of one and
[46:01] two and some people say
[46:06] none like well one and a half don't
[46:08] exist one and a quarter don't
[46:12] exist well how many numbers are
[46:15] there there's an infinite set of numbers
[46:18] there yeah see we don't we don't
[46:21] recognize the numbers that are there
[46:23] because we just look at because we limit
[46:25] those that
[46:26] said we limit that well we say there's
[46:29] nothing
[46:30] there but see brother Bon was trying to
[46:32] get us to see that there's unlimited
[46:35] amount there
[46:38] right you know brother Bram said if if
[46:41] we could we could see what what uh
[46:43] Einstein you know if Einstein take the
[46:46] word and what Einstein could see and put
[46:48] it together you know he could really
[46:50] told us something you know and and you
[46:52] know brother V was standing there and he
[46:54] said he said God he said feels all time
[46:56] and space he feels
[47:00] everything and we look out there in the
[47:02] night sky and we s we say we don't see
[47:04] anything we just see
[47:05] nothingness we see galaxies and stars
[47:08] and all these things we see
[47:10] nothing but you know here come Einstein
[47:13] to tell us you know he's you know all
[47:15] there's something out
[47:17] there he said you know we we were
[47:19] looking and we thought that light the
[47:21] light that was bending and you know we
[47:23] thought all that was taking place
[47:24] because of gravitational pull and then
[47:27] Einstein proved that it wasn't pull it
[47:29] was pushing he said something was out
[47:31] there pushing what was it there's an
[47:34] unknown Force that's out there that's
[47:36] causing these things to take
[47:39] place see we didn't see that but he said
[47:42] you know that's what he was trying to
[47:43] get us to see he said he said if you
[47:46] could see tonight the angels in the
[47:48] building
[47:51] right you know brother BR said one time
[47:53] he said they're standing all around the
[47:54] walls he said said if you could see in
[47:56] that other
[47:58] dimension he said he said because the
[48:00] angel of God encampeth about those that
[48:02] fear him so he's always there but if you
[48:05] could see that amen see we look and we
[48:08] think there's nothing
[48:10] there but you know as as Elisha said to
[48:14] Gesa he said you know there's more with
[48:15] us than there are with them but you know
[48:17] what he had to be able to S into that
[48:19] other dimension that other realm to see
[48:21] what was taking
[48:23] place and there's more opening up to us
[48:26] it's it's greater here than
[48:29] anywhere than any time in history
[48:35] right why because brother mam said it
[48:37] would be
[48:39] humble and people would just walk right
[48:41] over walk right past it they would miss
[48:46] it but it's here yes
[48:51] right that's what God has wanted us to
[48:54] see if we can
[48:56] see this unseen unseen realm that's
[49:01] facing
[49:06] us I'm GNA get to we'll get to a few
[49:09] other things and I'm GNA
[49:16] finish but you know we were reading the
[49:18] quote here
[49:20] and I I put this this the scripture in
[49:25] it's Matthew
[49:27] 21 and I was going to going to read this
[49:34] but you know it's where he was talking
[49:36] of the of the vineyard and he was
[49:38] talking of the
[49:41] husbandman and you know they they came
[49:44] and you know he said he he lent out his
[49:48] Vineyard to the to the husbandman and
[49:52] you know brother bandham said that the
[49:53] husbandman in the in the in the the
[49:55] message brother R always talks about the
[49:56] husbandman being the ministry being the
[49:58] ministers being the preachers and he
[50:00] said you know he landed out this
[50:02] Vineyard for them to bring forth
[50:04] seed to cultivate this he had it all set
[50:08] up for him but you know what when it
[50:11] came time for it to produce seed in the
[50:14] time of the fruit right it come time for
[50:18] the fruit to come forth he said then you
[50:20] saw what they were doing right he said
[50:22] brother R said they were fighting and
[50:24] backbiting against each
[50:26] other he said he said they were going
[50:29] against it and he said he sent his
[50:31] servants to
[50:33] them and he said they killed one and
[50:36] they killed
[50:37] another threw them out right but you
[50:41] know the but the but
[50:44] the the master said well this is my son
[50:47] I'm going to send my son to him he said
[50:49] they'll reference my son oh
[50:53] yeah you know what
[50:57] he got the worst end of the
[51:00] deal because they said this is the
[51:03] air we're really going to get him
[51:07] amen and what did he say he said what
[51:10] what will happen to these he said it'
[51:13] utterly destroy
[51:16] them and see that's that's what I've
[51:18] seen that's what I see in happened in
[51:21] the message
[51:24] right see it's it's a glorious time but
[51:27] I've seen where where theyve take
[51:29] they've taken this
[51:32] message that's
[51:34] right and they've
[51:36] taken each one of the and you look at
[51:39] these servants you know I see I
[51:42] see Martin Luther Martin Luther's
[51:48] faults we don't we don't need the
[51:50] message of justification
[51:53] anymore he changed brother ad changed
[51:56] the doctrine of the new
[51:58] birth we don't need sanctification
[52:02] anymore all we got to do is get the Holy
[52:05] Ghost we thrown them
[52:08] out and then when Christ the word
[52:11] came see they thrown out each one of the
[52:14] servants sure and then all of a sudden
[52:16] brother bam didn't know what he was
[52:17] talking
[52:19] about you think you'd think you'd get
[52:21] that from the Pentecostals or from the
[52:24] denominations or what whatever but you
[52:25] know what you get more Skeptics and more
[52:28] unbelievers and more critics that people
[52:31] that claim to believe this
[52:34] message and those are those are the ones
[52:36] that have fought against all
[52:39] this and you know we we thought it was
[52:42] an amazing thing when people started
[52:44] saying the things against brother
[52:46] brandham that was the tip of the iceberg
[52:50] absolutely because now they've gotten to
[52:52] the place where they're destroying the
[52:54] word right right just just as the
[52:58] this the master sent his sent his son he
[53:02] said surely they'll reverence him no it
[53:05] was
[53:05] worse and it's exactly what they've done
[53:08] today they they've attacked they've
[53:10] attacked the word
[53:12] right and destroyed and destroyed the
[53:15] the effect of the
[53:19] word and you know I'm amazed that that
[53:22] that people can go to play you know
[53:25] certain churches and and you know I
[53:27] don't I don't mean to be critical but
[53:29] you know I I you just got to call things
[53:31] what they are
[53:35] right and you know because people are
[53:38] going to going to do their own thing and
[53:40] you know whatever it is it's it's you
[53:41] know because of of money or because of
[53:44] of of popular you know popularity or
[53:46] whatever it is that you know that they
[53:48] have decided to
[53:50] do but you know you know brother random
[53:52] said he said I indict this generation
[53:55] for for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[53:59] Christ you know what that indictment
[54:01] still
[54:03] stands and you know what that indictment
[54:05] is still upon the people and it's even
[54:07] worse today upon the people of this
[54:09] message because they've turned it down
[54:11] right
[54:13] right and you know I I I stand here
[54:16] today and I tell you and I'll be the
[54:17] first one to admit it I'm not I'm not
[54:19] I'm not the most perfect I'm not the
[54:22] right you know there's a lot of things
[54:23] in me that aren't right
[54:28] but God help me stand to stand and and
[54:32] and defend this amen whether I die and
[54:35] go to hell there's one thing about it
[54:37] this word's
[54:41] right I may not I may not be I may not
[54:44] be right in all the things that I
[54:49] do and that's all
[54:53] right there ain't nobody there nobody in
[54:55] this building is going to have to answer
[54:57] for me but
[55:02] me and yeah I know I'm I know I'm not
[55:05] where I ought to
[55:06] be but you know what I want to say one
[55:09] thing I believe I'm not where I used to
[55:15] be and that that's one thing that I can
[55:18] that I can
[55:20] say but you know you you've seen what
[55:22] what the word has come forth
[55:26] we've received the we' received the word
[55:27] in its
[55:29] fullness and you know what it's been
[55:30] trampled
[55:33] underfoot and all the things that has
[55:35] happened to it but you may tell you I'm
[55:39] so glad that it's been shown to me
[55:42] amen if I you know I I told people if I
[55:46] die and go to hell at least I stand up
[55:47] and say thank God I've seen what I
[55:50] saw God has shown me
[55:54] this I may not I may not be able to
[55:56] explain it and I may not be able to
[55:58] expound on it as well as other people
[56:00] but you know there's one thing about it
[56:01] I believe I got faith in
[56:04] it I believe it'll do what it says it'll
[56:08] do and God will do what he says he'll do
[56:13] amen why because when when you don't see
[56:16] a way out
[56:18] sometimes and you wonder how things are
[56:20] going to take place God comes on the
[56:23] scene amen you know when you when you
[56:27] take a when you take an inventory of
[56:28] your life sometimes and you look where
[56:30] you are and where you used to be you
[56:32] know what you can stand up and say thank
[56:33] God I'm not
[56:36] there I may have a long way to go but
[56:38] you know what I think I've come
[56:40] somewhere
[56:42] amen I've come I've and and I know I'm
[56:45] not where I need to be but I thank God
[56:47] I'm not where I used to
[56:50] be but see the thing is as long as as
[56:53] long as you're not
[56:55] as Wade said you know as long as you're
[56:56] not standing still or going
[57:00] backwards because that's what we need to
[57:02] do we need to go
[57:04] forward
[57:06] glory and so I thank God for what he's
[57:08] shown me
[57:11] amen and I just want to share a few
[57:14] other things and I'm I'm GNA finish up
[57:15] here but I was reading the other day in
[57:19] the mess of deep call to the Deep
[57:21] brother R was speaking
[57:23] of
[57:26] he was speaking of uh Benjamin
[57:28] Franklin and he was talking about
[57:30] Benjamin Franklin understanding about
[57:32] light and
[57:34] electricity and you know he said he went
[57:35] out there and he flew that kite and he
[57:36] had the key on the end of it you know
[57:38] and he and he realized he had there was
[57:40] power there and you know he he found out
[57:43] there was power he said you know
[57:45] electricity lightning was actually
[57:47] electricity was able to find out
[57:49] understand that you know brother R said
[57:51] he stood there and he said I got it I
[57:54] got it
[57:55] it yeah he had he had that but you know
[57:58] what he didn't go any further with it
[58:01] but you know you had somebody that was
[58:04] uh moving further beyond that and he
[58:06] said his name was Thomas Edison and
[58:08] Edison came along and he said you know
[58:10] Edison got in a in a lab and he sat down
[58:13] and you know he said he wanted to
[58:14] harness that he wanted to be able to use
[58:16] that he wanted to understand more about
[58:18] it then then Ben Franklin just standing
[58:20] there saying I got
[58:21] it and you know he got in there and he
[58:23] wanted to build a life
[58:25] bulb and you know he wanted to stand
[58:27] there and you know and he got in a lab
[58:29] and and if you if you ever read anything
[58:31] about Edison Edison hated Edison hated
[58:35] doing uh book work he had you know and
[58:39] you know lots of times when you go to do
[58:41] lab work you're doing experiments you
[58:43] know you do a lot of studying and
[58:44] writing and all this type stuff you know
[58:47] they said you know he made 10,000
[58:48] experiments trying to build a light bulb
[58:50] well you know you know he he didn't want
[58:52] to sit down and try to write it out
[58:55] and know there was one of the things
[58:56] that he detested was people come and
[58:58] tell him said well this won't work and
[59:00] they had it on paper he said well have
[59:02] you proved it you know that was that was
[59:05] Edison's way of doing it don't tell me
[59:07] what what it says can you prove it has
[59:10] it been
[59:11] proven and you know you know because so
[59:13] he got in there and that's what he done
[59:14] he kept trying something else and that
[59:16] didn't work but you know he never got
[59:18] deterred by what what took place he
[59:20] tried something else he tried something
[59:22] else but you know what he was able to
[59:24] come a place and develop something that
[59:26] actually worked exactly because nobody
[59:29] had to tell him well that won't work he
[59:32] figured out woodw right and you know
[59:35] there was a there was a man that and
[59:37] some of y'all may may have never heard
[59:39] of him
[59:41] before and I don't think brother V ever
[59:43] mentions him but I don't think you some
[59:46] of you may have never heard of Nicola
[59:48] Tesla was his name some of you probably
[59:53] have yeah
[59:55] that's right you know Tesla worked he
[59:58] was from uh I think he was from Hungary
[1:00:02] and uh he come he come and worked under
[1:00:05] Edison for a while you know Tesla said
[1:00:08] you know he said I could have he said I
[1:00:09] could have sto 90% of the lab work that
[1:00:12] Edison done because I could have proved
[1:00:15] it but Edison wasn't that way don't tell
[1:00:18] me what you can write down tell me what
[1:00:19] you can prove
[1:00:21] right but you know Tesla took the things
[1:00:24] the same things that Edison had you know
[1:00:28] Edison spent all his time building a
[1:00:29] light
[1:00:30] bulb well that was good but I tell you
[1:00:34] what we wouldn't be where we are today
[1:00:36] if it wasn't from
[1:00:41] Tesla you know Tesla said I think it was
[1:00:43] in the early 1900s Tesla said that told
[1:00:47] us at one of these
[1:00:49] days he said a person will be holding an
[1:00:53] object a device of some sort and he said
[1:00:55] they'll be communicating with someone
[1:00:57] else over
[1:00:58] here you can send your message to this
[1:01:01] person over there they'll receive it and
[1:01:03] send it back to
[1:01:05] you he had a he had a light B he had a
[1:01:08] light fixture a street light out in
[1:01:11] front of his
[1:01:12] laboratory there were no wires connected
[1:01:15] to that
[1:01:16] light it came on was powered turned on
[1:01:19] and off by the source that was in his
[1:01:22] lab amen he dealt with he understood
[1:01:26] Wireless you know he he told us that
[1:01:28] that everything we could communicate by
[1:01:30] without wires and you know he developed
[1:01:33] all kinds of things today there was a
[1:01:35] lot of things that that we we have seen
[1:01:36] because you know he stepped in and
[1:01:38] Edison could talk about building a light
[1:01:40] bulb and having electricity but you know
[1:01:42] Ed Tesla come along like he said he
[1:01:44] built AC showed us how how this would
[1:01:47] develop in and you know how we could
[1:01:48] communicate
[1:01:49] wirelessly and someone come along and
[1:01:52] and showed us today and you know all of
[1:01:53] us have cell phones you know he he went
[1:01:56] beyond that but you know people thought
[1:01:59] this man was a
[1:02:00] lunatic do you know do you know because
[1:02:02] of of the the ideas and the thoughts
[1:02:05] that Tesla had and the and the things
[1:02:07] that he wrote about and talked about do
[1:02:09] you know that's where we get the
[1:02:11] stereotype of the mad scientist yeah
[1:02:15] right why because here you know you know
[1:02:18] people people don't have lights and you
[1:02:20] know all these type things and here he
[1:02:22] is talking about things that just
[1:02:23] blowing people
[1:02:26] mind and you know what we walked right
[1:02:28] into
[1:02:29] it you know brother said he said
[1:02:32] Electric's been here this whole time
[1:02:34] right but you know what they've been
[1:02:35] able to find people that that have
[1:02:37] looked into that realm and been able to
[1:02:38] harness it that we can that we can see
[1:02:43] it and it's the same thing with the word
[1:02:46] of God it's been here the whole time but
[1:02:49] you know what now you can harness the
[1:02:50] power of it now you can reach into that
[1:02:54] you can see the things that are there
[1:02:57] and you can you know you can walk along
[1:02:58] and say well this doesn't this doesn't
[1:03:00] exist like brother talking about the man
[1:03:02] you know climb down in the basement and
[1:03:04] say well the sun doesn't come
[1:03:06] up that's not going to change God's
[1:03:09] plan you can either receive it or you
[1:03:11] can turn it down but you know what it's
[1:03:13] still going to be
[1:03:16] there and many people have turned it
[1:03:18] down they've walked away many people are
[1:03:21] scared of
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:25] that's true but you know what we need to
[1:03:27] come back to an oldfashioned altar amen
[1:03:31] come back to the beginning right and
[1:03:34] like like many many of people have said
[1:03:37] the reason people don't grow is because
[1:03:39] they never got born again that's right
[1:03:41] and if you never if you never got born
[1:03:43] again then you can't ever grow things
[1:03:45] don't ever
[1:03:47] change but you know what God is still in
[1:03:49] the saving business he's still here to
[1:03:52] meet each need and and make hisself
[1:03:55] known
[1:03:56] right let's all
[1:04:01] stand but I'm so glad that he has made
[1:04:03] himself known to
[1:04:10] us there is a there is a a Ministry I'm
[1:04:13] not I'm not looking for brother brandham
[1:04:15] to come back right I'm not looking for
[1:04:17] brother brandom to come back and and
[1:04:18] bring me anything I believe he's done
[1:04:20] his part am sir I believe I believe
[1:04:24] we've seen the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:26] Christ in our
[1:04:31] midst this bride has a
[1:04:36] Ministry and I believe we've heard from
[1:04:38] that five-fold
[1:04:42] Ministry and
[1:04:46] now the word is made known to us and
[1:04:49] then it's our our decision what we're
[1:04:51] going to do with it whether we accept or
[1:04:54] rejected
[1:04:56] right how far because you know he said
[1:04:59] it go it's for whosoever
[1:05:03] will well then you can say well is that
[1:05:06] me or
[1:05:10] not so I'm so thankful
[1:05:14] amen God help me
