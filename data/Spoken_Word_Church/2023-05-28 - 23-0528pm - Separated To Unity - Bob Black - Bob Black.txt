was a little road went into a subdivision and this gentleman come and he said he was a pastor of a Baptist Church and he saw it set laying in the road and laying in the driveway there and he said the thought just come to his mind but what if your wife had lost her beautiful what would you do so he brought it back to me and I thought that had to be the hand of the Lord I would have thought that way or fell off this way because when I went looking for it I was looking for it this way and it slid over that way and fell just to the right place thanks so many things that maybe would kind of take you

well I sure enjoy those testimonies that's just 30 Souls it's good to hear that God's doing something isn't it [Music] you know uh sometimes you can get a little bit afraid to give a testimony you know there's that the devil put in your mind you better not give a testimony because I'm gonna get upset you know you know there's some things that you got to be careful about you give a testimony on the arm of man like boy my kids are perfect kids are perfect you better you better watch out you are in for some trouble then but now don't be afraid to give a testimony on what God has done because you know there's a promise that the devil can't do nothing to you if that God don't allow you remember job had a hedge around him that the devil couldn't do one thing unless God pulled that hedge back so don't be afraid to give a testimony on that account don't be afraid to give a testimony on any account we should if you do if you take any Step In Fear then you're you're uh off balance we should perfect love cast out all fear don't be afraid well that this afternoon I want to speak uh you know you know the pattern we we have a lot of people here on on Sunday morning so we do evangelizing in the morning and teaching in the afternoon so the afternoons where you got more more of the the ones that kind of want some uh you know well just big and plainly maybe want some more word or whatever so we'll we'll do that so we're trying to trying to meet that need so we're going to turn to Hebrews chapter one and we'll read from Genesis chapter one as well so let's just go to the author Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word Lord and look into these things look into your promises the Lord once more and I pray God that you'll just Lord let the words that are said be edifying to your people Lord that it'll give them strength Lord and certainly we won't strengthen this hour we want our faith to be built up Lord God to a place where we don't have any trouble receiving and believing the things that you promised Lord and help us Lord Jesus tonight help us this afternoon Lord Lord you'll you'll give us access into these promises and into these Mysteries we ask in your name bless your people we pray in your name thank you so I want to speak on a little topic of kind of strange separator to Unity that those seem like opposed opposing uh things ideas but um you know before God can unite us together he calls us to be separated separated from the world and and a lot of times separated from from your friends and your family and so that he can deal with you alone and as he's dealing with you alone then he's he's bringing us all back together uh to to his word so let's just read in in chapter Hebrews chapter 1 verses one to three it says God who has sundry times and is dying in diverse manner speaking time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person now we're going to tie that together with Genesis 1 26 27 and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin and sat down on the right hand Majesty on high now Genesis 1 26 27 says when God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the face of the sea going over the foul over the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man and what image in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word now just kind of meditate on these on these scriptures that we just read that in Hebrews 1 Paul is telling us that Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God and then in Genesis 1 26 27 he's talking about that man was made in his own image in the image of God oh to think about now and I'll get him back up as like that that uh the Sunday School lesson that brother Ryan was bringing out this morning that this whole uh in this whole uh the statue of perfect man is an image of of Christ it's actually to express the the deity and the attributes and all of those things in that make up the character of God Express that in a bride and you think about how Hebrews 1 is looking at at Christ and Genesis 1 26 is looking at that pattern that God wanted to take that everything that is in God and put it and through the Holy Ghost into the bride into a people so that so that now just to speak plain so that you and I are actually the the entire bride body together all around the world are the express image of God and you just think now oh if we could just look at the promises that we have sitting here before us that God wants us to be completely United with him that God will want us to be so United with him that that we would have the same characteristics that we would we would think the same to say now to think the same means means you're not going to be one word off there's going to come a bride that won't be one word off she would be so in line with the word that when the Devil comes and tells her it ain't possible it ain't possible to speak squirrels into existence it ain't possible for you to be healed it ain't possible for that little fishy to come back for life it ain't possible for your children to be to come back to to Salvation it ain't possible that that you cast down reason uh and sometimes it maybe seems a little bit Out Of Reach for us but but as we as we eat more and more word you see it begins to take place shape you're uniting with Christ as you're partaking of the word you're with him and he's changing us he's changing us back to the pattern that that Adam and Eve represented there in the garden that situation where the Masterpiece family God and Adam and his bride there in complete Harmony and fellowship where he could come down and talk with them and fellowship with them all together that's why in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 13 and 14 it says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off we've been we were separated from God separated by sin separated by what happened in the garden that we were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ now we're coming back together again we're being nigh the fellowship that we lost now is coming back together for he is our peace who hath what who hath made both one who and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us oh thank God that through Christ Jesus that middle wall the Gap that was between us now has been torn down so that we have a blood covering that can bring us back together that God is not looking at our sin anymore that he's able to he's able to come and dwell himself in our and Tabernacle himself in us to bring us back into fellowship with God and the way he does that through the pattern of well first he starts off with your soul and then he begins to align your spirit with your soul so that your spirit's in alignment and your cast down reasonings and then then you get into a place where he can work on your body and reveal to you the full complete Plan of Redemption has been accomplished in you and you're going to take a body change now and and the message um brother I'm kind of preached two messages about Oneness and unity and one was called the Oneness of unity and the other was called just Oneness and then the message is the Oneness of unity he starts talking about talking about the Tower of Babel where they built in Genesis 11 it says the Lord said behold the people is one God looked down to that situation where they they had all got together with their their denominational ideas or intellectual understanding and so forth and they they thought well I'm gonna we're gonna build this big Tower of Babel what do you think that was trying to imitate it was a copy of this and they they started out there we're going to build up a tower that goes real high into the heavens and we'll be able to climb up and get closer to God you're trying to trying to cop you see brother out of the city of God flows the River of Life well out of Babylon out of this Tower of Babel flowed the river Euphrates and see the devil's got a copy of everything and so the Lord said behold the people is one and they all have one language as he looked down and they were all woman but see that's the devil's got his way to get you all won but we don't want that way we don't want to be see maybe sometimes you see people in even in church kind of get confused about how we're supposed to be one that well if we if we can just fellowship or do have a lot of Fellowship then that'll make us all one if we could just get around people that don't believe anything now I'm not against I'm not against witnessing and helping people and encouraging and people that are Sinners Like Jesus would sit down with the Pharisees and and the people that the drunkards and so forth and try to win them to win them to the gospel but I'm not I'm not talking about that but I'm talking about the Oneness that that that that brother Branham and one this that Jesus was trying to get us to is different than that it's different than the Oneness that the devil tries to get you to well we'll just we'll just throw our arms around everything and and and and and it doesn't matter if you're like a transvestite or homosexual or whatever we just we're just saying well we're all you not know you how can two walk together except you be agreed you can't now I see I'm not opposed to witnessing now I'm not I'm not what I'm not talking about but but you you got to be you can't walk together with somebody that don't agree the way that you do and see now the devil has a plan to bring Oneness that I don't want one that's to unite together outside of the word that's to unite us together outside of the world you gotta the plan that God has for us is to be United by the word that each as each individual each oh you look out at this congregation here and each there's all these individuals that are going through their own journey and their own problems and their own problems at work and their own strife and their own family problems and spousal problems and children all the all kind of things everybody as an individual but you see God's working on each individual by themselves and then that as he grows you up in this in stature then he's gonna that's gonna collectively bring us all together because then as a as an individual that's grown up in stature the end you can you really be able to have fellowship with one another where you you really be able to put up with one another and have patience with one another and Temperance says we're kind of we're being honed together and joined together by the word not by man's ideas but by the way word of God having an effect in our lives individually now that's God's perfect plan for Oneness now brother around said now the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much oh you think about this now so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve any time God wanted to talk to them they were ready to listen and they were willing to lend their ear to what God had to say is could we say that if if God tells us to turn aside and witness to this person stop stop go over here do you know are we in that same kind of condition that's what God wants us to do he wants us to be like like brother Brown said the early disciples were one whisper from God and they would they would stop they would pull back they would pull over to the side go talk to this like like Philip was told to go talk to the Ethiopian eunuch and he didn't say well he's a Ethiopian you know he's sitting there in a gold cover chair I can't stare at I can't go talk to him no he just listened to what God told him to do you see that's being in unity with God God wants us to be willing to listen to him willing to be uh subject to the spirit moving on the scene willing to willing to know what's right and wrong and all those kind of things that go in with unity now brother Adam said now that that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one so now now think about now what is Oneness one this kind of unity that we're talking about here is we study these things out Unity is is communication you know you know really if you just kind of look at look at problems in a church or problems in your home a lot of a lot of most most of the problems happen from communication just somebody I don't understand what the other person's saying or or they don't communicate clearly but if you just stop and communicate and you see that's that's what a lot of the problems in the in the church happen because we just don't want to understand what God's trying to get across to us we don't understand when we read the Bible the disciples they they hear Jesus tell a parable and they didn't understand it what are you talking about but when they begin to understand you see that's that's when Unity comes in when you begin to understand what's being preached across the pulpit and we all know when you started off with your in your Christian Journey when when you first started off you didn't understand it and it caused a lot of confusion does he mean this does he mean that what what does he mean that you come all this way in the Statue of perfect man and you still don't have the Holy Ghost what is it what does it mean that this and that and you have all these questions but then when you when the when it begins to be revealed to you did you begin to have a common understanding a common heart now that's that's the situation that Adam and Eve were there in the garden that they they had a they had a common purpose that they wanted to hear what God had to say they they weren't they weren't we'll say skip it out on Church they wanted to be there when God come down in the cool of the evening they were ready to hear him when he come and had a message for them they were waiting they were they they they were they were ready for Fellowship they were ready for fellowship and and uh I I sure appreciated that conversation I had with brother Aaron in the parking lot about uh what some of the preachers are preaching in a message about Oneness because that certainly ties in good with this and I might borrow some of them things because we were talking about we were talking about that that uh a real Christian Home has got to be has got to be situated on Oneness that that you how would you want to why would you want to be married to a woman that you don't really like that you know that's not Oneness I know that sometimes that happens I'm not talking about that sometimes that happens when you get in a situation and you you know all sorts of things happen but one Oneness is when you you have harmony with one another you you you you won't being around your spouse you want to be around your spouse and and like what we're talking about there I really appreciate that that why would you want to be married why would you want if a man is married to a woman why would you want to spend more time around other people than your wife your wife should be the person that you collaborate with that you fellowship with that you love really more than anybody else I I and I I can say that as my own testimony that I love my wife I want to be around my wife when I in in the evening after work I talk to my wife about my day I talk to my I talked to my wife about my children I talked to my wife about family because she's my buddy she's my friend and that's what we're talking about in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were buddies they were best friends it wasn't like well I don't even want to hang out with her I'd rather go fishing with my buddies now you see that's that's the kind of situation really in life if if you'd rather go fishing with your buddies or go out to the bar or something than be with your wife then that's a problem that's a problem and you're going to have a lot of marital problems if you don't want to be with your wife because your wife or your husband will flip it around both ways your wife your husband should be should be your buddy your best friend above everybody else except God of course God your spouse and then then the rest of the world you're because what is it your your spouse is somebody that you're yoked up to that God has given you that help to go through life together and and and uh face the world together and and and and and just look at things look at challenges of life together oh thank God that God give you somebody like that to go through life with that when you got money problems you can sit down and talk about it you have somebody to talk about it and you're not just there all alone that you got somebody with to go through life with and that's that's what Unity is supposed to be now brother Adam said to any man and his family are correct good Noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere now listen to what he said they should all be one the whole family father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture now now remember going back to Unity comes comes back down to communication you see let me tell you if you can have an open line of communication with your children oh you have one as a parent oh you have you have accomplished such a great thing if you have if you have an open life if there if they will come and share frankly with you they're false and failings and I know that's a really hard thing to say you know we all know that kids lie to their parents and you got to be real careful what you say is the truth and what is false and everything but I'ma tell you if you have an open line if you can ever establish a communication with your kids so that there come to you when they have a problem and that you they want you to pray over their tests and pray with them before they go to school and and it's a real open line of communication you have accomplished a great thing you have done a great thing if your children respect you respect the father and respect the mother and we'll come and talk to you about things that you have accomplished a great thing and you see this is I'm brother Madam is panning for us this ain't my picture that I'm painting this is Brother Brown I'm painting this picture for us of what a perfect what a what a what perfect unity and the Garden of Eden perfect unity in your home perfect Unity between you and God should look like this is what no see God God wants you to have a peaceful home if we're sitting here this this afternoon and you're thinking well I don't want to go home I like it hearing this quiet with the air conditioner running and the the quiet drone of the preacher so I can finally get a little nap and it's it's nice and nice and peaceful in here but you see God wants you to have the same peace the same peace at home he wants you to he wants you to have a peaceful home how do I know that because the Bible says in Psalms 128 thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the size of thine house thy children like Olive plants round about thy table now we were talking this morning about promises if there's a promise laying in the Bible you can have access if you just claim it by faith and act on it step on step out on it Proverbs 15 says better as a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred there with a stalled Ox is Ox that's been put in a stalled until it's nice and fat so he's saying it better as a dinner of Love herbs where love is than a then a fattened up ox and hatred there with better is a dry morsel in Proverbs 17 and quietness there with in a house full of sacrifices with strife in Proverbs 24 says through wisdom is in house builted and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches now if your house is going to be built with wisdom and by understanding it's established then let me give you this wisdom and an understanding that God wants you to have a peaceful home God don't want you to have a home where the the soap operas are running on the TV constantly and and you'd rather talk on the phone with all your friends and go fishing all the time instead of being there with your wife and you don't want to have a relationship with your kids and you don't want to listen to their problems and don't want to help them out and don't want to have a Bible study with them you see that's not the kind of peace and unity that God wants you to have God wants you to have a script scriptural joy and scriptural peace God can give you a home filled with contentment and peace oh if we could compare I think this is a problem we have a lot of times too we'll compare our life with other people and say well there there in this situation so I'm I'm good but let's not compare one another with ourselves let's let's compare it with the word God can give you a home where you can communicate where you can really communicate now brother remember said that's God's purpose that's God's purpose now see this ain't my purpose if it was my purpose you could get upset with me for preaching like this but this is God's purpose and brother Brian said what a prayer what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people yes and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made one oh oh you these things are not Out Of Reach of us it's not Out Of Reach to have the character of God to have the patience of God and the love of God so we can love one another and forgive one another and all those kind of things to think well this picture that was that's being portrayed they desired they wanted to hear what God Said when you come down in the in this cool and Eve of the evening because they had the same nature the same mind and the same thoughts now there's a picture of unity that's what God is trying to get us back to that will have the same nature the same nature as God that we would be the express image of God that God that Jesus Christ would be so Tabernacle in us until we could get all of our flus unblocked and get all the reason cast out until we can just look straight on at God's promises at his word and say I believe it I don't care what what comes I don't care what the circumstances are I don't care what uh Susie Q from work or anybody says contrary to the word I don't care I'm just looking straight at what God's promise is and this is what Jesus prayed for if you go back and read John chapter 17. I know you've heard a lot of times ministers talk about how that Jesus prayed for you think about what a great fact that is to know that Jesus prayed for you if you want to read what Jesus prayed for you I'm talking about you right there sitting in that Pew then you can turn over to John chapter 17 in your own time and read the prayer that he prayed but what he was praying for was that we'd be one and Jesus prayed in John the 17th chapter in the 11th verse that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one what a union a Oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God and that's why brother bam said or or Jesus said in John chapter 14 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I and you you'll be so wrapped up together you'll be so wrapped up until what's the difference the bride will be him you'll be so wrapped up in it you're in him and he's in you yes and he's in the he's in the father and it's just all one see not there's the there's the revelation of the godhead not three different people if you can see that Jesus Christ was God in another form and the bride is God in another form and it's all God the same character the same person the same attributes and that makes that makes you God that's why in the Old Testament they had that scripture ye are Gods ye are Gods them that the word come to are Gods that's why as the word comes it unites you with God until you are God now that's a that's a big Throat full to say isn't it that's a big that's that'll choke us a lot of times but that's the church brother said that's the church that Jesus is coming for that's who he's coming back for and it is a requirement it is a requirement that we come to that kind of unity because God's not coming back for a little immature bride he's coming back for a bride that has come to a place where she and God are the same the same thoughts nothing different nothing different nothing separated but the same thoughts in other words if God said it you believe it amen you believe it and you will speak it because you believe it you'll come to a place we're coming to a place where we're saying the same thing and brother Adam said that's what his prayer will be answered in John 17 that we will be one the Oneness of himself and the people brother Adam said is the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in his church that's the only grounds of fellowship and that and the only way that he can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever we're talking about eternal life to be United with Christ to have the life of almighty God oh you see how these things come in layers oh you you gotta you as as the word is being preached it comes in layers first first first he he unites you in your soul and then your spirit and so you know honestly it it you hear you hear differently depending on kind of where you're at to be United with him in the spirit of his power his eternal life you're eternally United with god brother Ram said and he said if you're separated from God God don't uh well this is this is my note if you're separated from God God doesn't want you to stay in that tradition condition you think about Eve was United with Adam that she become part of him in Genesis 1 27 God created man male and female created he them now brother Brian said the body part the body was a byproduct now all you think that God God gave them both the same on the inside that same Spirit the same source of their life the same nature the same characteristics but the body come out of Adam's Rib so it will separate the body was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished I'm gonna take this off so I can be at Liberty no now y'all don't draw back on me now y'all help me out stay alert but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and Finnish feminist and then God took that one feminist part of him out and put it in Eve oh you so now now they're they're different on the outside but the same on the inside now isn't that just like what Christ on the bride we're different on the outside on the outside are we got you know our we're in this flesh in this flesh that causes us all this problem and the spirit realm and everything but down on the inside we're the same now that's what brother Brown said he said now don't you see the great picture we and flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness and his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to the Eternal see how God planned it that we should not be different but him oh if you think about that statement that he just made that we should not be different but him so what are we where God made flesh where God in Tabernacle and individuals and first John 4 13 it says this is how we know that we live in him and he and us that he has given us of his Spirit yes this is how we know that we're in him that he's given us up his spirit and that's how we know because it's the same it's the same life it's the same characteristics that took us out of the world that changed us that makes us act different and think different in Romans 8 11 it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell and you hit it raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by what by his spirit that dwelleth in you at the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwells in you so we are living by The Same Spirit separated out into his bride that brings us into Unity yes oh now think about that think about that God God took that same spirit and put it in individuals separated so he could deal with us each individually as we go about our day-to-day Life as we go to work and go to jobs people all around the world going to different churches individuals but that same spirit is working in all of us and it's going to bring us back to Unity with him so that we act the same way and and talk the same way oh you go back and read what brother Brown said in Revelation 4 as he was preaching those sermons about how that he saw John saw John saw that image of the emerald rainbow and out of that out of that Emerald rainbow is like a crystal that reflected light into all the seven Church ages that rainbow light now that light was an emerald green the life of God reflecting in all the seven Church ages because it's the same life and you and I and individuals and it's bringing us all back together with Oneness with the with him and brother Brown said and today if we don't live the Christian Life well then what people can say we're not Christians but if Christ is in you he lives his life in you and Jesus said brother Brown said again he said Jesus said if I don't do the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works of my father believe the works there you are we ought to be reflecting the life of God in our life and I'm not talking about just being good people I'm talking about signs and wonders following I'm talking about you lay your hand on your wife in her bed when she's feeling sick and you see people being healed because we're expecting we're expecting the word of God that we believe will have an effect in our lives that we won't act the same we won't talk the same but it'll change us changes and changes and changes until that final change when we step out of here like brother said what's the Rapture going to be just to change the Rapture will be just to change so I'm expecting changes I'm expecting God's word to be effectual in our lives to changes thank you and what did he say it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you and another place he said remember it's still him it's his life in you thank God for the Holy Ghost God gave us the Holy Ghost for more than just to cheer us up he gave it he gave us something to live with he gave us something to power us up the statue of a perfect man to unite us with him to be one with him and he said on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together now don't think of separating like God chopping himself up God is still one but he's taken part of himself and putting himself in you and I so that my and my own self I'm not the fullness of God and you're not the fullness of God but all together all together we are all together all around the world the bride together is the fullness of God made bodily and he said then with that group of people together what does it do brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together now there you got the son of man back on Earth again there you've got the revelation of the son of man not like the Son of God in Revelation down through the seven Church ages where they just had partial word a partial understanding but the son of man will be God manifesting himself back in the bride again in fullness without any deviation from the word without any denominational ideas without any man-made ideas she will be God made manifest in flesh again so that's that's where you can stand and say if you don't believe what I preach you can say like Paul did if you don't believe what I preach you you'll be judged by my gospel if an angel from heaven come and say anything contrary to whatever I say Let It Be accursed that's the son of man coming to speak in John chapter 16 27 28 it says for the father himself in love with you because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and had him come into the world again I leave the world and go to the father and John 14 3 says if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also so God that's the whole purpose that God came into the Earth that Jesus Christ came into the Earth to prepare a place for you to to bring you back to himself to Oneness with himself now brother round said in flesh I become Branham because of my father Branham you become part of your father and mother but in spirit in spirit we become a union with God it's part of God that's the reason that the spirit cannot die oh thank God that by the Holy Ghost I'm connected to a different family tree the family tree that I come born from my mama and daddy from I had all kind of problems and and things that you could trace back as stubbornness and every every problem in the natural of natural life but in my spirit in my spirit it connects me back to a different genealogy that takes over my natural genealogy and will correct the problems that I was born with it'll correct The Temper it'll correct that the judgmental nature and the stubbornness it'll correct all that and take it out bit by bit until I'm like Jesus Christ and you're like Jesus Christ it is what is it it's his own life tabernacling himself in you and Romans chapter 8 verse 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus how are you going to condemn that Holy Ghost that lives on the inside of you there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that there there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're not walking after the flesh when we're born again we're walking after the spirit this on the inside this quickening our outside body to behave like the spirit on the inside wants us to as we yield to it as we let it as we Feast on the word it's correcting our natural carnal nature in Romans 8 verse 5 says for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit oh that that ought to inform you know when you see somebody that just can't can't live that Christian Life the flesh the flesh will mind the spirit when you're born again it's going to there's a battle going on but you've got to give way to that thing that's on the inside the spirit in you wants to be in control in Galatians 3 16 he says this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk in this Spirit like we were preaching that Wednesday night get in the spirit sometime if you if you're struggling with things get in the spirit a little bit and find out what God how God wants you to live your life Jesus laid out the formula to eternal life to Martha when he said Jesus he said I am the resurrection of the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never lie never die you're believing on him until you receive eternal life then eternal life is God's life in you then you're believing in him you're believing on him and then you're believing in him and that's why he said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die brother Brown said so we can be in God United because Adam and Eve I think this is such a wonderful quote when you get discouraged you start thinking about this kind of thing and you look at that that picture of Adam and Eve there in the garden that they were United in the picture of of Union with God and so that is a picture to us that we too can be in that kind of a union with God that's what brother Brown said he said so we can be in God United because Adam and Eve before the fall for the disbelieving of the word was an example of what we could be in him they were an example to us of what we can be what you and I can be to be United with him his life to be separated from him as death if we'll just follow his Commandments now now think about this now I know it's 30 minutes and right after 30 minutes is when everybody starts taking a nap so I'm trying to be I'm gonna slow down that turkey starts settling in that sandwich that you ate for lunch my brother Brian said we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that see on the outside our flesh it's going to make mistakes or think about it think about it when you were in sin it's like having a a dark garment on and how you're going to get it white but when you're when when God fills you with his life now you're clothed in righteousness and you're you're but going through life you're going to get black spots on it so uh you know you're going when you you're going to you're going to make mistakes you're going to fall that's what he's saying he said it's it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them as long as you go through life you're always going to get little spots on your on your on your wedding dress on your garment you got to keep cleaning it off you gotta but you see when you fall get back up when you make a mistake now now we're going to get in here somewhere for a minute oh it's always to think now what a blessing it is to recognize our mistakes yes yes oh you think now which which is which is greater to to not have any mistakes or to recognize when you mistake make mistakes so see so many people are just blind to their predicament that the Bible says in Proverbs chapter 26 do you see a person wise in their own eyes there's more hope for a fool than for them somebody that just won't recognize that they made a mistake it's such a blessing to recognize when you make a mistake and can can get up and apologize for it that I think I think to me that's almost a greater thing than somebody that's just just wallowing around in filth and don't know nothing it's a greater thing that somebody can can recognize that they made a mistake and pick up their head and go to somebody and apologize for it or get on their knees at night and say God forgive me I made a mistake you see you see the problem really is when when you look at when you when you look at yourself or look at others and they just they just can't see the state that they're in there's where you really got a problem the pig Walling around in the mire that that's uh just doesn't even know that he's in a pickle that's a problem but oh when you make a mistake just get up just get up and keep going just don't don't stay down but just get up again now brother Ryan said it's not your mistakes he said we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have him but you see is following his rules following what he said do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty oh that's where if you got the right motives and the right objectives and you're you want to be you want to be better and you you get in a fix and you just stumble I shouldn't have told that brother that I shouldn't have reacted like that then just apologize and go on just tell them you're sorry pick up the phone and say I'm sorry now there's when you can see a real Christian at work not not being all goody two shoes and walking through life all perfect and everything not making any mistakes but real Christianity is apologizing real Christianity is repentance real Christianity is I I know I know I'm going to make mistakes in my life but there's something down on the inside that's going to make me love my brother going to make me forgive my brother gonna make me ask for forgiveness and want to make me reconcile with somebody when I do wrong oh what a blessing of the Holy Ghost I want to reconcile with somebody when you've got something between you and another brother it makes you want to go to them and did you did you really mean that what you said no brother listen you took it the wrong way or you know maybe I did mean it that way but I'm sorry I'm sorry about what I said now there's Christianity at work right there because something on the inside is taking over something and let me tell you something that's a supernatural at work somebody that can apologize you look out in the world and the world ain't gonna apologize the world ain't gonna admit fault the world won't admit wrong it's so hard for people to admit when they are wrong I I even you know think about the story of Noah trying to get people to just get on the ark and nobody would get on the ark after 120 years preaching preaching preaching preaching and think about today in this situation that we're living in today you can preach and preach and preach and seems like the people that you want to get kind of shook a little bit they just they just it's so hard to get people to admit that they need God that they need a savior or to give somebody to admit that they're wrong takes a supernatural life of God almost that's why in Proverbs chapter 26 it says to you see a person wise in their own eyes well I know what's right and wrong I know what I need to be doing I know I I don't make any mistakes there is more hope for a fool and for them is what the Bible says in Proverbs 12 15 the way of fool seems right to them but the why eyes listen to advice the wives want somebody to give them counsel and Luke chapter 18 9-14 it says this is the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector in the story The Pharisee was self-righteous and didn't recognize his own need for forgiveness while a tax collector humbly acknowledged his sinfulness and salt God's mercy now there's there's somebody that'll really get something from God somebody that realizes that they need something that they need some not not to stand there staunchly and say well I I'll tell you what I know I know I'm not going to go down and talk to that brother and sit it sit across from him at McDonald's and make everything right or what I'm just making I'm just making up McDonald it don't matter what I'm not trying to paint a scene where somebody didn't go to McDonald's or something like that I'm just talking I'm just talking about reconciliation and to First John 1 to 8 it says if we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves if we if we get to a place where we're like there's nothing I'm doing everything exactly by the book oh you're deceive yourselves oh we need to conduct ourselves with humility and and just because brother Brown said as soon as you dries above the dust you rise above God because you're elevating yourself to a place where you don't need to get down and repent or ask for forgiveness anymore it is worse it is worse to stubbornly refuse to admit your failure failure than to stumble and fall I I really believe that it is worse to stubbornly refuse I I ain't apologizing for nothing that's worse than just stumbling fall to begin with because you stumble and fall get back up and keep on going dust yourself off get a little Rag and clean that spot off and get get that white on there again get the rag of faith in what Jesus Christ has already done and let his blood and wash it off of you I just get up and just keep right on going keep on moving instead of relying on our own righteousness and our own good works because our own righteousness is those filthy rags to God there's nothing good about our own works there's nothing good about the way that we conduct ourselves without Christ where would any of us be we need we need a blood covering we need we need God to cover us over thank you I'll tell you what God look I'll tell you something else God loves besides this morning that we were preaching on faith God loves to see faith and God loves to see an humble heart that just wants God Psalm 51 says My Sacrifice o God is a broken Spirit David knew about broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart you God will not despise somebody that's willing to Humble themselves down to the plate place to ask oh God I need something from you and Matthew 5 3 4 Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for that's the kind of person that's going to have the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted and James 4 6 he said God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble God opposes the proud but shows favor to the home I think the pride is one of the worst Spirits you can get on you because Pride if you go look up the dictionary definition of it Pride's got all this all this stuff accumulated around it of arrogance and stubbornness and defensiveness you can't tell me I I used to live next to we used to live the next to this guy it he got his whole family turned against him and and his son actually disowned him and and every time I talked to him I used to think this this fella is just so stubborn he got to a place where he they were going to kick him out and I tried everything I could to help him out try to find a place for him to move into and everything I did he just said well I I don't want to listen to it that's the worst thing kind of situation you can be is prideful and just stubborn where you can't even be helped by nobody entitlement a disdain for feedback all to be like to be somebody like that that don't want any kind of a feedback I I'll tell you what I'm gonna be honest I want all the help I can get whether it's mean-spirited or good spirited yeah I I will feedback when I'm preaching sometimes I'll ask my wife anything I can do better about my sermon she'll tell me sometimes well you need to slow down or whatever and I'll take that feedback I'll take feedback from anybody because I want feedback anything I can do to better myself but you see what Pride does it just cabbages you down and says well I don't want to listen to nobody I'm gonna do it my way or I'm gonna do it like like that's that sounds a lot like Kane doesn't it you're either gonna come my way or not at all and Proverbs 16 5 says the Lord detests all the proud of heart it says be sure of this they will not go unpunished we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have him but you see it's following his rules following what he said to you for we can just humble our heart down to the place where God said we need to go be baptized we go get baptized the right way if God said we need the Holy Ghost and we just we lay aside everything else until we get the Holy Ghost until we're sure we got the Holy Ghost none of this babying around well I think I got it I hope but let's let's be sure let's get in the word and find out scripturally whether we got the holy ghost or not so we don't have to keep keep asking somebody do you think I got it or maybe maybe I do maybe I don't but let's find out let's find out scripturally whether we got it or not if we could just be humble enough to get in the word and find out things yes but around said that's why he said this great thing I would this great statement that we battled with for over the years I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart why because it's your heart's condition I would rather be with a humble spirit that can be corrected that somebody can talk to me and straighten out my path than to be right in my Doctrine but I have a horrible hateful attitude there won't be no good in this life that won't help nobody that every time somebody wants to talk to you just push back I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart because the heart's condition is more important even than you being right could we say that I think we battle that out long enough around here the heart's condition is the most important thing it matters more than you being right it matters more than you being right well bless God I know I'm right I don't want to listen to somebody like that I know I'm right oh let's get away from the culture of trying to be perfect in ourselves a good way how life is full of mistakes life is full of mistakes you know God don't want a shaky scared Church afraid to make mistakes you you if you're afraid to make mistakes you'll never be good at nothing even at my work where I work you'll people make mistakes all the time oops I deleted the whole database well we'll we'll fix it you made a mistake now we know how to recover we'll fix it the people at church you're going to make a mistake I I shouldn't have you know use that microphone or whatever and maybe somebody'll fuss on you you get it all straightened up but let's don't be afraid of mistakes because if you want to be if you want to be a blessing in anything in life then you're going to make mistakes life is full of mistake if you make a mistake at least you tried at least you got up there let's let's just get up get up and give it your all because we're in position for Unity and Oneness with God we're in position to come into Unity where there's no difference no difference between our our thinking and our acting and the way we talk and The Way We Walk between us and God that is what we are in position for that brother said now look Adam and Eve in a position to never die in a position to never be old to never be sick to never have a worry you say I sure wish I could be like that and he said I got news for you you are in the same position oh you think about that a position to never die position to never be old position to never be sick position to never have a worry you can have that you're in that kind of position he said God places that to every creature on the earth in the same position what was the agreement if you keep my word now if you keep your word if you keep his word you don't have to worry you don't have to worry about tomorrow you can be like Jesus down at the bottom of that boat when the storm came up and it was tossing the boat back and forth you don't have to worry the doctor tell you you got some kind of horrible disease but you just you put that on God cast your cares upon Him is what the Bible says cast it on him and you don't have to worry because God's got it all in control remember that promise that the devil can't do not one thing to you unless God pulls back the Hedge unless it happen so if God's in control of everything and you know you're in the word then just that should give you confidence you just stay stay the course and don't worry you can have you got a prompt now he's he's the one that said you're in position to never be sick you're in position to never be old you're in position for a body change you're in position for that you're in position to to for our bodies to be changed and take us home up to the wedding supper and on into the Millennium and reign with him for a thousand years and on into the New Jerusalem if you'll just keep my words yes that's that's what he's asking us to do keep my words keep my words what be born again if God said be born again you got to be born again amen you got to be born again now if God said you got to be dressed right if God said you got to be dressed right say you're not some kind of a lustology for men and dressed right men so that you look like a real man you got to be dressed right if God said if God said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together come to church because you you recognize the importance of that because God's word says it then you you got to go to church because you're going to keep his words if the Bible says do unto others you got to do that because his word says that and that nature on the inside is going to make you make that outside conform to that if if God said if his word says to put God first in everything put God for put God put coming to church instead of going to the birthday parties and all the family reunions and stuff on Sunday can put God first in everything then I got to keep his word because you oh you see you see I was telling Monica the other day I read this quote where blood around said me and brother Neville are not your bosses we don't have bosses in a church we don't have bosses where I'm going to come into your house and put my thumb on you and say you better you know like that that's not what Christianity is but we are subject to the word you see I don't have any authority to tell you nothing outside of the word I don't have any authority to tell you to do to do what I I think is right or wrong but I certainly do have authority to preach God's word and we've all got to be subject to the word so when the word says you've got to come to church and you got to dress right and you got to live right you got to act right and treat one another right then I have authority to tell you these things because the world gives me Authority like the policemen that don't have any Authority in himself but he stands out on the corner and holds his hand up and you got to stop or go because he's got Authority that was given to him you got to keep your words you got to keep his words Satan is so deceiving to keep you off track though Satan will make you all kinds of promises and I'm starting to struggle here the clock's going around I'm trying to on the other hand I did give y'all some time back this morning everybody gets worried everybody gets nervous Satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you because he don't have nothing he don't have no salvation what is Satan anything contrary to the word oh no now there's where you're getting into something deep what is the devil he's anything of course he's a being of course but now just just categorizing the devil the influence of the devil anything contrary to the word now now you get into some deep water here a little bit because you think about now that in your soul you can be born again but you can still be influenced by the devil in your spirit in your soul you can be born again but you go out in the parking lot and and somebody will say something contrary to the word and yet they're born again but it'll cause maybe a doubt or put a complex in somebody's mind like like maybe a born-again Christian will say I I think you gotta I think you got a problem with pride or I got I think you've got a problem with uh you just say put put a complex on you now you've got to battle that out and and it ain't it ain't coming from a good place it's not coming from it's not coming from anything scriptural but but you see oh you see how the devil will put something in in in your mind your mind your mind right here now where's this scriptural I'm talking about you go back into the Bible and read read where Jesus asked who do you say that I the son of man am and Peter said by our Revelation die or the Christ the son of the Living God and they're just a few few verses later Jesus has turned around and saying him get behind me Satan it's right there in the same chapter just a few verses later he had just identified Jesus as the Thou Art the Christ the son of living God but then just turned right around and he's Jesus is calling him Satan because why because Satan is anything contrary to the word of God that's that's what this whole growth is is the word of God pushing the devil out pushing him out just like when you were being born again he pushed him out of your soul and that's the process of sanctification so that God could come and live in your soul now he's pushing him out of your spirit so through your memory or Reason Consciousness affection imagination you're not letting you're not listening to nothing the devil tells you that Satan is anything contrary to the word now think about that the next next time you're so quick to just listen to some gossip or listen to something false or fake that that that's I say that's that's that's how you discern that's the devil and brother Brown said he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have light his kingdom is Darkness the end there of his death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom yes yes that's why one word off brings death one word off one word off comes from the devil it's not something God God told you it's one word see how one word off can be so close I don't think it's for you I don't think you can get it I I think you're just gonna have to go to the doctor I think and want one word off one word off will cause doubt and fear to settle in because this of the devil the devil's the Satan's whole economy is based upon false conception brother Brown was even uh talking about he he he went uh he saw this advertisement about somebody washing dishes that this thing you could just you could just get and you just put your dishes in it and it would wash them and you wouldn't have to push them in the dishwasher or anything and he believed that ad that he saw uh in the newspaper or whatever and and he when he got it he thought boy I'm going to really be something but he found out that they were they were they were lying to him the whole time that it was all deception he said there was just as much egg on them as it was when I put in there my wife would have lost confidence in me by that time but the whole thing is based on on Deception he said why does the nation why does this nation let the people be deceived there's death in the drinking of whiskey rape murder Insanity in the bottle but yet we're allowed to put it on our programs and advertise it as the kind that grandfather drank more joy out of life certain kind of beverages a beer and alcohol was it what is it it's deceiving uh the only place you can go to get some truth is the word of God that's something that you can hang everything on you can hang your soul you can hang your life on it the word of God is truth even to the point where truth was standing there in front of pilate and he asked pilate said well what is truth and truth was standing right there in front of him truth oh brother Adam said no church will clean your soul no Creed can clean your soul only the blood of Jesus Christ can cleans your soul that's God's remedy the only way to stay in Divine Fellowship was keep that word that's why in John chapter 15 it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what we will what you will and it shall be done unto you that's the only way you can have Divine Fellowship is to keep God's word and did you know brother Raymond said that there is no better class of people in the world than those who keep God's word that's the best so sitting here this afternoon as our eyes are starting to look in different directions I just want to declare to you that this is the best class of people there is you are the best [Applause] if you keep God's word you are the best class of people that there is period the best class of people you are the best the better than better than anything else that the world can offer better than all the millionaire clubs better than all the secret societies better than better than the president you are the best you're the better you're the better than all of it Psalm 119 it says blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart that's where it comes from in the scripture blessed are they undefiled in the way you are our blessed people brother Ram said we all know there's a God and if God is so correct with his word and so determined that he'll judge the people by his word that he's got to preserve a word somewhere to judge the people by and the Bible the Bible is it don't you forget that the Bible was it don't you forget that so you young ladies as you're reading your romance novels and your young man is you're watching Marvel comic movies and things don't you forget the Bible is where you're going to be judged by the Bible is it the Box somebody needs to make a t-shirt with that on it the Bible is it don't you forget that the Bible is it because Psalm 119 says forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven forever o word Thy word is settled in heaven Thy word is the thing that settles everything you can build your whole foundation on that that Oneness in Fellowship the Oneness and fellowship in the Garden of Eden was broke between God and his children the minute she disbelieved one little paragraph one little word of God oh you see how it comes across I can't be healed I can't have peace he won't back up his promises he's not the same as today as he was yesterday God don't care about me I know a better way one word off one word what's one word off to take away a promise from a believer or to add some kind of something else they got to do on top of it add some additional requirement take take one word away or add one word to it and now you've got the whole situation mixed up now you've got death thrown in to take one word a or you can't be healed you can't have peace but God said you can if we'll just believe God let me skip through some of this now and I'm gonna I'm not gonna go through my whole note shell so be at ease have peace now look look where brother I just really want we got to get this in to meditate on what happened when Eve disbelieved got one word and compare that what happens when you believe God's word he said what what happened when he said disbelieving God's word caused everything to fall apart what happened her thinking changed oh yeah her thinking changed now how did it change her fellowship with her husband wasn't right now see God's got this picture of what a perfect perfect Fellowship should look like how everything should look and then one word off breaks breaks it all as soon as you break one word off off what happened or thinking wasn't right so she started passing the book and what's she doing Pride starts coming in that ain't my fault it's his fault oh you see you'll see that Here Comes The Devil as soon as she took one word off here comes pride in that's how you get that family situation messed up that's how you get your home your church messed up is you one word off and then Here Comes pride in to say well there ain't nothing wrong with the way I'm doing it and then a few chapters later see I got a man from God didn't I I got a man from God and of course we know brother Brown said every child comes from God but look at look at the Spirit which we see she's saying that she's saying that with this prideful I know I'm right nobody's gonna tell me wrong and she began to pass the book her thinking was actually changed now that's what happens when you get one word off now think about what happens when you get all the word restored then your thinking is repaired your thinking comes back you start thinking right now now the brother Brown said why why was your thinking wrong she had the life of the Devil in Her exactly as soon as she disbelieved God's word she accepted the life of the devil because she accepted his teaching she disbelieved God's word and it disassociated her from God because in her right then was the life of the devil she had believed his lie said the fruits is good and she'd partake them with him that's right oh there's the answer to the question why does one word off bring death why how did they die because as soon as you take one word off then Here Comes The Devil in to just take things over and now down into the grave you go that is how we're going to take a Rapture is by not being one word off but you see that's sometimes we just kind of cabbage down and say well I don't really see the benefit of of sitting through maybe a long service of listening and really really hanging on to every word because it's going to take the full word of God to bring you back into full Unity with God so that you can take a body change you're you're going to go by the grave if there's one word off one word off brings death because why you're doubting God and you're you're accepting the LIE of the devil and you're accepting the life of his devil to to move around your memory reason Consciousness affection to to mess around with your spirit Realm instead of loving her husband and telling the truth she lied she should have said brother Brown said she should have said he's innocent I gave it to him because what pride pride is failing to admit you're wrong the Oneness with her and her husband was gone the Oneness of them and God was gone and every church that doesn't take the whole of God's word the same thing happens oh to think now to think now that you a born-again Christian can still be influenced by the devil in your spirit Realm now that might be hard to swallow but think about a little bit and battle it out think about what the greatest battle ever fought was that God will come God will come and tell you tell you the truth and the devil will come and tell you a lie and in your spirit realm you can still battle it out whether to accept it or reject it or not but God gave us his spirit and his truth to overcome to that God promised to bring us back into Fellowship back into Unity back into Oneness that was the promise that he made in the garden in Genesis 3 15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel that's the reason that it takes it takes a union I'm trying to find a closing spot y'all y'all make y'all make the clock makes me nervous y'all make me nervous and you'll never you'll never be oh let me skip through that very good I'll go ahead with that and do more clothes you'll never be United with God's word until you separate from the word that's where my topic separation to Unity that you've got to be separated before you can Unite and in second Corinthians it says wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you now if you go study this out the message one this brother bam explains that he said that was God's purpose from the very beginning that he told Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the Earth and his purpose was for them to go and spread out all through the Earth and then he would deal with each one individually and then he would bring them back to himself so that's what he's doing he's actually fulfilling that same purpose now through the preaching of the Gospel as we've spread out from the day of Pentecost when the the life of God was separated into all the individuals and now it's spread out through all the world separated and God is dealing with people as individuals individually to bring them back to himself but you see you got to be separate you got to be separated from the world before you can be United it's Ephesians 5 11 it says have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them and James 4 4 it says ye adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God you you got to be separate you can't you see if you're hanging around friends that are taking you farther away from God they're not really your friends if you're hanging around somebody that's if you've got a girlfriend or a boyfriend that's not bringing you closer to God and they're just taking you into the depths of Satan they're not they're not a good candidate for a good spouse you want somebody that's going to draw you closer to God so you got to be separated God's calling us to be separated and first Peter it says as obedient children not fashioning ourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance you've got to be separate you can't be going back to the way that you used to be you've got to be living a separate life in first John 2 15 and 16 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not even in him so that just shows that if your heart's not in the right place if you're not if you don't love God there's something wrong there's something wrong brother Brian said here you are a pit Brethren you Pentecost the weaklings so God separated you and sent you out to be an inner denomination you can't denominate Pentecost sent you out to be his people God see God doesn't want you to unite around man's ideas he doesn't might want you to unite just around Fellowship that's not God's plan and purpose but the way that he's going to unite us with himself is by his word and that is the only way by his spirit and by his truth and that's the only way we can throw our arms around somebody that don't believe like us and say I love you we're United but that don't make you United what's going to make us United together is like on the day of Pentecost then when they got together in one Accord they started thinking together about the promise of God that God had given them and they began to get in one Accord because they were sick in the Holy Ghost the spirit and the truth is what is going to bring us together in Union Unite with God through what a separated individual experience a separated individual experience you and God alone and then we can join together and have Fellowship that's what's going to unite us together as the musicians come brother around and said you took the Pentecostal church and United it into an organization God never did want it United he wanted it separated never United with the world because God don't want another Babylon he don't want another Babel he wants somebody that'll just stay right with his word and like we were saying this morning you stay right with God's word as we stand to our feet stay right with God's word and you'll see God will back it up God will bring it to pass the Bible says man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so you've got to live by every word it takes every word every word not just one word not just part word because the word is what's going to bring us to Oneness with him you love the Lord this afternoon let's worship Him down from his glory [Music] ever the living story my God and savior

not just wonder about it and struggle with it but you really believe it believe for a toothache belief or healing salvation your family belief or body change that's what God wants us to do believe him and that's the best way that's the only way that you can please God just believe what he said you love the Lord this afternoon let's pray and then we'll be dismissed Lord God we're so grateful to you
