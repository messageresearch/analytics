TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we are we are going to you gonna do the audio to do this why did that I guess good morning everybody it started god bless you all don't you all have it had a good weekend blessed to see another day of life o Lord we appreciate his business to us a mint a new man so we're not going to do bible reading and this morning I mean we are we're just not going to do what's that called responsive read so I just have a have quite a few material to cover and you want to try to make sure we get it covered in an onrushing type of way as much as possible because we stop here with 1025 around that time Terry sometimes people are really okay all right okay great all right so let's start with a word of prayer this morning and nice brother Bob of human open very prime well Jesus we're so grateful to be able to come together and gather around your own afraid order to just be with us this morning and open art would you bless the service this morning or juniors and bless this little less aboard God afraid you'll be with us in nature any that we have all that Marcus one that you'll be there to answer give us the things that we have you yes go pray and ask these things in your name appreciate machine counting all right um you should continue remember brother wait and sister June is they're traveling Lord just watch over them he should be ministering at brother Joe greens this morning stuff you remember him for Lord or just use him for his own in his court Amen let's all turn to Matthew chapter 13 Matthew 13 we know another brother brother Dale he's been speaking lately about the German not dermot eyes see germination and all those different types of things the seat on the fill in the rock and so in this I wanted to kind of still continue with that thought that brother Dale's been bringing we're just kind of in a different little angle and kind of taking somewhat over the weight if you were here Wednesday night talked about the anointing of you know anointed in the word Norton for a purpose right and finding yourself in the scripture which is very important in this hour because you know if you don't know where you are in the scripture if you don't know if you are not rooted and grounded in the word in any way shape or form you can't continue in this Christian life you have to be rooted and so that's why I want to talk about this morning it's about being routed into the Kingdom of Heaven being rooted in the kingdom of heaven and a while back I haven't preached this message here but a presa mess is called with no root no fruit and I'm this truth no root no fruit now priestess back oh I can brother Gene Williams church a couple of years ago in them and uh and maybe brother Dale he might touch he might touch on this later on because you know I go slowly and it kind of leaves you a question and doing your own study to which I love you know and I really appreciate brother Dale so much just pay your blessed woman they may have a husband like that that that shyt puts me to shame you know that I don't get into word like he does and so I god help us all right man because that's that takes you know getting into the word and studying and things like that it's also mentally it mentally uh you know even Paul said you know when you when you a lot of studying can be weirdness to you as well but that's a sacrifice that you're taking your persevering amen and there's going to be a blessing to come out of it whether it's for yourself or for somebody else a blessing won't come out of it because it's just work amen yeah excited that's good Amen because that's eight you ain't taking what you buy a walmart with you to heaven with thing this word with your anything I said you know a lot of printers discipline I've let them walk through walmart all day and i discern oh yeah some people some people then sometimes you look at billboards or things like that and get you a sermon you know and but it's good to be in the word Amen it's not just further pasture not just for the preachers for all of us to be in the word they meant good so Matthew chapter 13 we're just read here we'll start at verse verse 3 and it says and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to soap and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up verse 5 some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and for with they sprung up because they had no deepness of birth and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away if you go down to verse 20 all the way to verse 20 of that same chapter it says and he ceases starting to explain that that parable he says but and he goes to the part where the one that fell on stony places he says but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that feareth the word and anon with joy receives it yet has he no root in himself but do earth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended now Jesus here is speaking he's talking about this see it started to grow but it didn't have root to be able to make a foundation or two or to pull water and nutrients in order to continue grown amen and then if you read in mark chapter four you'll see that this Jesus speaks the same parable in mark chapter four you can read that now if you turn on me to Luke chapter eight Luke chapter eight in Luke chapter 8 in verse verse 6 we'll start at verse father says I saw her went out to sow his seed and he and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture so here on one on one animasi he says it then grow because it didn't have any route but then here in Luke he says it didn't grow because it didn't have any moisture so it didn't grow because of two different things no it grew do the same problem because roof is what grape is what grabs moisture in order for it to grow and if it doesn't have any route it's not gonna it's not gonna not going to grow its going to wither away so so brother but they'll have been speaking about dermot eyes see and there's also what's called germination of the sea now it kind of if you listen to brother Brennan speak and he speaks about the germ of life when he talks about dermot i seed and all in these types of things now Jaret I see you have to understand that when a seed when you're going to plant it on the ground first of all it has had to have gone through a process of pollination and all that basically a see what a seat is is kind of like what when the egg and a sperm joint together and we're all adults here some of us I'm gonna get out hard yeah there's nothing wrong with that it's good to love you know the Bible says you know love is a time for laughter time for sadness some people just stopped at the top for sadness and that's it it's good to laugh down Bob Vogel says laughter is like the mess you know we need left I mean we need to have a good time as well but sow a seed is kind of like a when a sperm and an egg join together it's a fertile fertilization starts to take place right there's an embryo that starts to you know starts to form but that is permanent that egg needs to be placed inside the proper environment right in the womb of a woman right in order for it to grow same thing with a seat now you have a seed that seed has life even though it's not showing it has life and that's what dermatitis means I'll see all life comes from God right we all know that so that scene even though it looks like it's dead and it's all hard and then it's got life within but you're not going to see the life coming forth until it is placed in the fray in the end the right of the right up in the atmosphere right in the ground now and so that's what dramatized means is that it has life already in it if you if you take a look at and I was kind of looking at this if you take a look inside a seated out it actually has a stem already inside of a little small stem little small stem with actually kind of like looks like little leaves already coming out from the sides but it's all inside its got some common units got endosperm and all these different little parts that are just dormant and they're just waiting to get into the right environment bringing in moisture as well in order for it to grow correct now when they when they are placed in the right environment and then little shoot starts to come up it's coming out of the sea that's what's called germination that's the germination process not on some of us some of us to get confused with there is a germination process but then that germ there that Dermot I see is the life that's already inside that seat that obviously our life comes from God right now when that seed is Dermot eyes that's why it's hard because it builds an outer and outer shell that it's protecting everything that's inside that outer shell that show us what that's why it's hard it protects everything inside and then when that germination process starts taking place that that little what's inside starts coming out and it breaks that outer shell and then if you continue to tune orchard nurture it it's going to grow any man let them watch your dad that's what the moisture does that's right one of the things that happens is that when it's in the right environment with moisture coming in because some people can take those seeds that are German ties to have life and they can actually grow them in a petri dish they can start the germination process without it being on Iran and they in the soil so you can take for example and I watch the video of a guy he was growing corn on a white plate and all he did was just put some put it in some water a little bit of water and put paper towel right over it to keep kind of keep the seed inside the water and it started growing its little sheets and that's where you get sprouts so germination is the same thing as sprouting if you'll feel to know that and and so you don't really necessarily need the soil in order for it to go now after the germination process then you can put it in the soil and that it can continue doing its thing so that's one of what Jesus is speaking here some of it fell on a rock there was a little bit of soul according to the scriptures that we worried here in Matthew there was a little bit of soil there but because it then have a root in order to continue grabbing that water it started the process of germination but it couldn't continue because it could didn't have the right environment in order to start start growing that route because once you put that German that German taught that germinated seed that's in that process of German ization in the ground what's one of the first things that starts coming up is starts growing that route in order for it to start pulling minerals and start pulling water amen so what am I getting with the Saints is that we need to be anchored we need to be rooted in the Word of God amen we need to know where we are in the scriptures because uh if you can know where you are in the word a man then you're not you're not going to be moved here you're going to be unmovable and you can be shaken a tree can be shaken maybe a little lamb here and there will fall other body forces of nature and things like that but i'ma tell you window when a tree is really rooted there's nothing that's going to be able to knock it down it's got to take a lot they made a lot of force to knock something like that now but that's what in the Bible you see David it says those that just trees that are planted by the water that's why the reason why a man we went we want to be where the moisture is always amen and I just moisture book by the rivers of water hey man you're gone when we've gone camping the guys and go to hell and George up in the river and you notice that all those trees up there they just seem like they have more life than the trees out here in this vicinity in these areas it seem like they're more green there even the bart is wet and then the leaves are when everything seems to be more most moisturized it's because it's right there right next to that water constantly feeding constantly p same thing with a christian that is constantly not just not just feeding when he comes through he or she comes to church but you're feeding outside of church you're constantly feeling while you're always near that stream you're always near that source of water and Jesus is that life may Jesus is the water of life they meant when you touch and they're going to be moisturized when you look at them they're gonna be moisturized they're going to look like they've they've got some life in them you know and some people you can kind of tell when some people look a little dry in the physical some people that look dry or they start pulling out something artificial trying to moisturize I saw artificially amen that's what people do sometimes with uh well as long as I get to come to church maybe once a month you know so that way people will say that I don't come to church you know but what's your purpose that come to churches is that purpose or is a purpose for you to be in tune with the word in Android and if you just come to church once a month I just kind of shows what's going on at home I'm sorry to say what's going on that's what I'm saying going on into heart at home if you and so you have to be constantly not just at church but also you have you have your personal time with the word right because that's a very important it's the way we're going to be moisturized then where we don't have to go and moisturize artificially a man with a different lotions and things it smells good that moisturization only last for a while amen praise God let it cost you all anything Amen now i wanna i wanna mmm now in if we go to Matthew chapter 11 in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus is talking about Jesus is talking about John the Baptist hmm and he says here in verse verse 2 it says here that when John had heard I'm sorry I'm happy chapter alone yeah this is it but I wanted to wanted to talk about okay well we know the-the-the is the scripture where John the Baptist one day and when they're asking him who are you and he said they asking him are you one of the prophets that no are you are you that Elias no not are you that Christ no nothing said who are you said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord without a doubt he knew that that was him now he was anointed at that time amen to know that that was him a man that scripture was anointed to him amy was was was revealed to him it and that did that he could place himself in description right dislike went bro wait was talking about when Jesus open the scroll and there the temple and he said he said talked about in Isaiah there he said I'm I'm the one the other spirit of Lord is upon me and you know what Scripture i'm talking about and and he could he could place himself in the scripture internet at a certain point he closed the book because it wasn't time for him to fulfill that that scripture right and he knew exactly where he was at into work yes and so John and so here in Matthew chapter 11 look what look what he says John the Baptist starting at verse 2 says now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto Him art thou he that should come or do we look for another now here is John the Baptist who knew where he was at in the scriptures he knew his position and he also had seen and was confirmed to him that Jesus was that Messiah that Christ and yet he's here doubting because the Bible says that now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ doubting if this was the Christ or not now remember there was also just like Jesus was praised for the wonderful things that he did your honor there was also criticism of his works as well that's right like just like all of us are going to be criticized at one point in time and whether we do good or whether we do bad we're going to be criticized right right and so probably some of those criticism that he was he look at Jesus he sits and eats with sinners and eats and fellowships with with prostitutes and talks to Republicans and thing like that and John probably thinking is there really a massage now maybe all this doubt was coming and he started thinking you know how her mind reason I was right same thing how they're doing now with the with the prophet of art of art day and he is not even here to defend himself but the Word of God will defend amen you better believe it and so he's doubting and then Jesus what Jesus says to his disciples Jesus go and show John again those things which ye do here and see the blind receive their site and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the Deaf hear the death that are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached today and blessed is he who ever shall not be offended in me and managers and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John now here's John he's got doubt in his heart but look how Lord praises John he says what went ye out to sea in the wilderness a reef shaken with the wind in other words he was John was a steadfast he knew himself in the word he knew where he was standing in other words he had root he knew where he was thin a reach shaken with the wind but what went yet for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold a that were saw floating on Kings houses but what went ye out for to see a profit yea I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold you see how Jesus now ties that scripture he says more than a prophet I say unto you in more than a prophet for this is he whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face was shall prepare that way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there had not risen of greater than John the Baptist now Jesus calls him greater than even of the prophets of the Old Testament because the prophets of the Old Testament all they could see was visions and all they could see Tech is tapping to to what God would give them but as far as I know there was no we're we're either one of them could place themselves in the scripture John the Baptist was the first prophet to place himself in the scripture with that Elias anointing he was a third that'll Iseman or that he was no he was one of the first ones that could say yeah I'm he it is now I correct me if I'm wrong but I don't know of any other prophet in the Old Testament that could say yeah I'm he or I'm Island they just knew that they were called but John could go back to the word and say I the word says this about me therefore this is the words that I'm producing hmmm he says barely i sensing among them that are born of women verse 11 they were born of women there have not risen up greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding what's this now I'm not what not what standard means nevertheless or but nevertheless he that is least in the king heaven is greater than he now that is talking about you and me saying we may not be prophets although the that that that that is one of the part part of the 50 minister night but in order for you because remember John the Baptist and I will read it will read this quote here actually let's read it now I'll read you this quote I thought this was really good when the brown says here in the message in 1962 perseverance he says Jesus didn't tell the nine want to give you ok he says now John the greatest of all the prophets he was the one that introduced jesus jesus said he was greater than any man had been born did you ever think why that was says all the rest of them speaking of the prophets both the spoke of him spoke of of Jesus Christ the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet that's the Bible said so and then all the other prophets it come to them in visions but when the word come to John it was flesh Jesus was the word he is the word he always was the word but there is where the fullness of God was made flesh and dwelt among us when he come to him in the water he was a prophet and if the word is made flesh it's got to come to the Prophet the word wherever it is it must come to a profit because a prophet is the one the word comes to and jon was the prophet of the day so the Word made flesh came 22 to John and so how does the word come to us now that think about what you're saying and the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John because now we can't just we don't have to just have the Word made flesh now to come to us we can have the word come in us a manner we can have the word come in us and full and fully reveal to us and make sure we may not it may be take time you know it may take time just like when when you put that seed into the into the ground it takes time for that route turn to to come out into and to grow and to do what the process that it needs to do but in time if you stay by next to the river the river of life it's going to grow and you're going to find out where you are in this word this word is going to be manifested not just on you but in You amen produce and others will see amen so that so that's one of the reasons I believe Jesus was talking about the least in the kingdom is greater than John because John could see Duncan see the word coming to him and flesh but remember what Jesus said he said blessed are those that have not seen but yet believe I've never seen I've never been I've never been I never went to one of brother brands meetings but i believe i believe the things that took place i believe though his word amen i believe what the Word of God says about me and you should and so I'm blessed you're blessed a meant to be able to have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us that can reveal the word Amen and become a new book to us Amen sister hurry i'm sorry i was just thinking because i've always wondered how could you be greater than John but the least in the king absolutely right and your bride is more important than your cousin and the thing is is that John could not be born never born again because Jesus had not died I'm not resurrected he didn't have the new birth like we can happen amantha there for you narrator than John ran that sense what that may amen so you are you can have even even more deepness of room then even what John had a mint so um and of course here's another screen other closer brother brother Brennan said he says here here was John on earth making that written word live in his time he was making that written word live because he could place himself in that's worthy man he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and and he always also was preparing the way before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his life because he was that life bright and shining light amen so you and me Saints at this hour we can be rooted deep into the kingdom of heaven amen but we must feed on his word amen now you go back to some notes here it's precious time goes by fast now now what is a root and the basic functions of roots I'll read this here says root is the principal organ for the absorption of water and dissolved nutrients in most sea plants and in firms the room also anchors the plant body and can store reserve foods roots usually grow beneath the surface of the soil and extend from the base of the stem some roots however grow above the ground from branches or leaves these roots either penetrate the soil or become attached to another plant or object as they grow a single root that develops from the scene or from the base of a stem in this case the firm is called a primary route that single main route that starts growing out because after after that other routes will start spreading out but that main one that's the primary route that's Jesus Christ they meant they should be the foundation amen now that's the reason why in some places he's called the root of Jesse the root of David and others it ring on different routes amen he is the main route he's the principal root praise the Lord right now spring root and offspring amen um and so some some of these seeds that fell on the stony ground they withered away because they did not have this root system to in order to continue growing you know and when you put I kind of think of the soil as of you know it's dark its moist its looks dirty doesn't look attractive right but yet that's where growth process takes place and that dark and and moist environment yet there's rich nutrients and things like that in that soil c to the world it looks like something something disgusting but when you're in that soil lenient in the environment in that environment a man an environment of a Christian should a Christian should be sitting in heavenly places right that's heavenly places to us to those that are rooted but to the world looks like something dark and mysterious it looks nasty it looks ugly amen soil doesn't look pretty at all but that's where it growing takes place amen that's where that route can can can can continue to anchor itself even more praise God so look at all the people looking for all this and all the beautiful thing well the beautiful thing the fruits and all these things that come out even though it's in the middle in the midst of that ugly dark looking soil alright beautiful things come out of it yes yeah absolutely absolutely lilies and all that and so because they had no root they withered away we know saying that this is the hour that people are withering away their fallen away even people that you thought that that were they were rooted falling away because there that that little seed it starts to shoot up that germination process takes place and it gets excited about the word for a while it's excited about the message for a while God sent a prophet and the hoe that seven church age is looking at into the seals and this this and that but there's nothing to anchor them inside Amen because why when trials and tribulations come and things of this world and persecution comes that can't take it I can't take it so they wither away amen now so obviously we know that there is no way for us as Christians to avoid trials and tribulations it's going to happen yes you're going to be tried you're going to be tempted but if you're have rooted Amen if you're rooted into the kingdom of heaven and know where you're standing in the scriptures there is no way for you to to fall amen you may make mistakes yes the tree the bark off a tree may fall sometimes little branch here and there may may may may fall but that doesn't mean the actual root of the tree the main stem of the tree is going to fall no why because it's feeding on the proper things it's rooted it's grounded Amen now skipping down a skipping a bunch of stuff when a seed starts to grow we say it germinates the katil Adon's store food for the baby plant inside the scene when the seat starts to germinate the first thing to come out is the main room the skin starts to split in the tiny shoot straighten carrying the cotyledons with it the main room gets bigger sad roots appear and so do leaves to grow the seeds growing conditions usually have to be damned warm and dark like springtime soil a dry seat will stay dormant unless it soaks in some water then it will start to germinate all right now there are different types of roots but 11 something that caught my attention I was reading the other day there was a man who who apparently there was there was a dry a dry spell to have taken place in these up and some fruit groves i think it was orange groups that he was talking about and he had some orange trees are some trees that i was producing some sort of fruit and people were coming to him and never seen water yew trees not drying up I mean that why are they thriving even though that there's this dry spell taking place my fruit trees they're not thriving and what he explained to them was that you know these these roots are these trees my trees could probably go another two or three more weeks without even watered and why is that and he said the reason why is because there's been times where I have not give them water in other words i have not that they have now had water I've not given them water so what did they do after they they shot the main route so what happens with when a tree starts with when the stock doesn't receive water the roots start looking for water and they get longer and longer and longer and start looking for water in under the ground and so and so that's the main reason why the mother he was saying that my fruit trees these aren't trees they're not going to wither away you know because they have their roots all the way down in there and they're getting their water from under the ground and so this is same thing with us as a Christian a man you get your naughty of you if you're rooted down the ground things can happen on the outside people can be fallen away back and forth dry spells can be taking place you don't feel the glory of God you know with your branches up but yeah you're rooted and you're feeding from from from the abundant source of water which is his word the Lord Jesus Christ they meant so let's all be rooted in the kingdom of heaven this one sense unless know where we are in the scriptures and I know this was kind of this wasn't a little was it look was a little bit rocky but you know as far as time he's gonna be looking at that clock i hate time amen but understand what I'm talking about like John the Baptist he knew where he was in the scripture yes right he could place himself in the word he was rooted there was no way to move him amen same thing with us Saints we may have times where we're doubt can come in like John the Baptist had that those times you know but then you go back we're like brother waits in our last sunday is what brother Brown said he said faiths rest is on the Word of God things can be taking place on the outside brothers and sisters who you thought maybe oh they would never never never follow leave the message or whatever my faith rests on his word amen that's where it rests and if i can find myself in that work like that scripture that those scriptures that brother Dale is saying a specific scripture that speaks to you amen yes not just that the whole word speaks to me amen the whole work speaks but there's a certain scripture that just draws you even closer to him men and if you could just if you can just grab that word and just be rooted it these feed more that route is gonna be it's gonna get you know even when there's a dry spell that room still going to get looking for that word it's not going to say oh I'm dying you know I'm dying and just give up you know oh there's a dry spell you know and everybody else is falling away what I'm gonna fall away nobody's going into church anymore i'm not going to come to church anymore you know no you that route amen something secretly has taken place underground and all that ugliness that soil something secrets taking place amen praise God let's be rooted in the kingdom of heaven anybody have any questions or any comments sister transit to think of it when these storms and really take the truck and loosen the rest it causes them today oh yes so there's little battles we have strengthening metal roof amen I like that they have the battles and true and traveled into relationships jesus said in his word and I was telling my mother in law of this scripture the other day I really love the scripture he jesus said in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world amen so let's have that overcoming us a man let's go ahead and go up thank you
