[0:00] good morning my time
[0:03] everybody okay now today we're still on
[0:06] the first seal now have you notice
[0:09] anything that we have not been
[0:12] doing the whole time not the
[0:16] message been
[0:24] doing mom got it and also what did Mom
[0:29] say we've been using the Bible and N I
[0:33] have we have we've only quoted quotes
[0:35] but we've never even looked in the book
[0:37] I would say you know but not to pull up
[0:41] quote after quote after because listen
[0:43] it's got to be your Revelation that that
[0:46] that has been here forever you got that
[0:49] that has been here forever and ever for
[0:52] 60 well what is it 63 to now yeah 53
[0:58] years good wow
[1:00] and and and it's
[1:02] quote and there's nothing wrong with
[1:04] that true but where did the prophet of
[1:06] God get it that's why you should you
[1:08] should never have to go to a quo to
[1:11] explain a Doctrine right that's right
[1:15] true that's right cuz brother Ram didn't
[1:16] he didn't sure but now watch what he
[1:18] done he went back and looked at some of
[1:20] the scholars quoted some of them and was
[1:24] wrong
[1:26] yeah right right even Clarence warin
[1:29] could get it right but he didn't have
[1:31] the full
[1:32] Revelation I believe the man had a
[1:34] revelation if he had a revelation of
[1:35] Daniel 70 weeks and and uh U that the
[1:40] white horse rider was the Antichrist
[1:42] that didn't come from the devil right
[1:44] that came from God but he only had a
[1:47] partial piece of it what's happening is
[1:50] now is we're going to I hope you're
[1:52] seeing that that as this Antichrist
[1:55] comes he is destroying everything that
[1:58] is of god yes conquering and Conquer
[2:01] who's he
[2:02] Conquering the people us the Ley he's
[2:07] conquering by a Doctrine he's tearing
[2:11] from the from the naing council he he
[2:15] has he has declared war against
[2:19] God okay to me you ought to see that cuz
[2:24] the revelation of the first seal if it's
[2:25] one true and living God what's the first
[2:27] thing Satan started on in the n coun
[2:31] Jesus is a separate person Jesus is
[2:33] another identity and then that same old
[2:36] Doctrine comes right over here and comes
[2:37] in the message like brother procast is
[2:40] talking I think he was more talking
[2:41] about two Lords instead of two Gods uh
[2:44] the doctrine is over in the Phil in the
[2:46] India now in the message well we've had
[2:48] it here Jesus wasn't god of the River
[2:50] Jordan we had lale with the two Lords
[2:52] and all that and I called his name but
[2:54] sorry not way it is where it came from
[2:58] and where did that get them where did
[3:02] they get the people that were following
[3:03] them confusion that's oh true Revelation
[3:08] true Revelation is supposed to simplify
[3:11] everything not confuse everything right
[3:14] I like what brother clar said he said if
[3:15] you come and preach a mystery and
[3:17] confuse the people he said that's not
[3:20] God God is not the author of confusion
[3:22] that's what the Bible says you know
[3:24] God's not the author of confusion so
[3:26] he's not going to um he's not going
[3:31] to by Design he he's not going to make
[3:35] you be
[3:38] deceived but now remember the Bible says
[3:40] that that they believed a lie and God
[3:42] let them believe it well they believed
[3:44] it first yeah right and he turned them
[3:48] over you know to a strong delusion well
[3:50] what who's a delusion is God a
[3:53] delusion but God knew what they were
[3:55] going to he knew that that rider was
[3:58] going to continue to ride on on through
[4:01] there cuz you got to remember where does
[4:03] that horse rider
[4:05] ride in the people right that's right
[4:09] listen you you got to get
[4:12] the God showed that's just like Moses I
[4:15] love what brother said Moses was caught
[4:17] up on the mount to write the Ten
[4:19] Commandments while he was up there
[4:21] though God showed him the temple that
[4:24] was to come the future
[4:26] home Jesus Christ and said Moses here is
[4:30] the type that you take to the people now
[4:32] it wasn't a person but it was but it was
[4:34] hidden in the outer Court the inner
[4:37] Court the holy of holies all the killing
[4:39] of the sacrifices that was all what
[4:42] Moses saw in heaven was what he saw the
[4:46] future home he saw Jesus Christ sitting
[4:48] on the right hand of the father he saw
[4:49] all these things but when he came to
[4:52] write it he didn't have the Holy Ghost
[4:55] hello right he was anointed but he
[4:57] didn't have the Holy Ghost when John
[4:58] goes to pass atas he's got the Holy
[5:01] Ghost and the Holy Ghost agrees with the
[5:04] Holy Ghost and he goes back and writes
[5:07] but then he goes into the Johns and says
[5:08] hey what I saw was the Antichrist
[5:10] remember he's the first one that said
[5:12] Antichrist even Paul didn't say
[5:13] Antichrist he said Grievious wolves he
[5:15] didn't know what to call it but when
[5:18] John goes to patmas sees all this that
[5:21] we're that we've read in Revelation 6 he
[5:24] goes back in John's and he says Beware
[5:28] of the Antichrist
[5:30] right so he had a revelation it wasn't a
[5:32] full Revelation but he had a
[5:35] revelation like brother Dale was talking
[5:37] now how many of you caught that
[5:38] Wednesday
[5:39] night the
[5:42] Capstone Revelation is the seal
[5:45] obviously The Headstone all right what
[5:47] does the stone mean Revelation
[5:49] Revelation so it's the head Revelation
[5:52] that's right it's the capping revelation
[5:54] we won't need anything else past the I'm
[5:57] talking full revelation of the seals cuz
[5:59] when our body is changed that's the full
[6:01] revelation of the Bible to us to
[6:04] us see your mind to go well he's going
[6:07] to go that's not to Israel no we get
[6:09] here that's right they don't they don't
[6:12] get it till we're gone so we got to get
[6:13] it first okay so we get to full
[6:17] Revelation that is the capping Stone and
[6:20] even though he may be here Jesus was
[6:23] here for 30 years and a lot of people
[6:25] didn't know he was here he's even his
[6:28] his own disciples
[6:30] at times didn't know who he really was
[6:32] so there's a there's a development of
[6:35] time that has to come in
[6:37] here and the Antichrist let's go back to
[6:39] them just for a second cuz remember take
[6:42] heed that no man deceive you now this is
[6:44] Jesus talking to the disciples all right
[6:47] so this is the Capstone Revelation but
[6:49] now
[6:50] remember you got to remember he was also
[6:53] the Cornerstone like Brother D was
[6:55] talking about Wednesday night now what
[6:57] is the
[6:58] Cornerstone
[7:05] Peter who do thou say that I
[7:08] am Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[7:11] Living God and upon this Revelation I'll
[7:16] build got to have Foundation before you
[7:18] can build I'll build my church so the
[7:22] Cornerstone sure he be he had he was The
[7:24] Headstone The Headstone came walked on
[7:26] the earth for 30 some odd years right
[7:29] that was him right he walked for that
[7:32] many years okay okay then he
[7:35] left and sent
[7:38] back he the head became the
[7:41] corner which was down here the corner is
[7:44] down right here and he and he said Peter
[7:47] upon that rock I'll build my church so
[7:51] he built it on the revelation of the Son
[7:52] of God remember me preaching Son of God
[7:54] the son of man yes we got to see the Son
[7:56] of God Revelation is fine to see it is
[7:59] it is is eternal life in your soul you
[8:00] going into heaven you have eternal life
[8:02] your bride Jesus Christ right that's
[8:04] right but that's not the full Revelation
[8:06] that's right full Revelation is a
[8:08] headstone the son of man God in human
[8:10] flesh walking on the earth not a second
[8:14] person that's what Satan want he Satan
[8:17] knows something is going to happen to
[8:20] put God and man back together again
[8:22] that's right he just knows that I mean
[8:24] he's he's a spiritual being amen because
[8:27] remember brother R said when when Satan
[8:29] feels God come toward you right what
[8:31] does he do he tries to jump in he tries
[8:33] to jump in
[8:34] between that's just what he is is that
[8:37] why he's distorted the word because it's
[8:39] Revelation the word sure it had to be he
[8:42] had to go to the word first yeah all
[8:44] right he had to distort the word take
[8:47] heed that no man deceive you now what
[8:49] are you talking about deceiving me in
[8:50] money and houses and cars and land and
[8:52] buildings
[8:54] and take he that no man deceive you by
[8:57] the
[8:58] word I'm not adding two but that's
[9:00] exactly what Jesus said for many shall
[9:03] come in my name right right now the ones
[9:06] in the prostitute ranks is not coming in
[9:08] the name of Jesus okay so the religious
[9:10] world is going to come in my name Jesus
[9:13] Christ amen but now remember if they
[9:15] they're coming in his name but they're
[9:16] denying it that's
[9:18] right when you deny the Lord Jesus
[9:21] Christ as the name of God yes and he's
[9:24] this what
[9:25] see denominational mentality okay
[9:29] shall come in my name second person of
[9:31] the Trinity that's right just like that
[9:34] brother was talking about with with with
[9:36] that up there you know he wrote that he
[9:37] said Jesus was the third of it see
[9:39] that's so ingrant was
[9:42] that um that was so in said I believe in
[9:45] one God right but then said brandom says
[9:49] one God then he said but I believe he's
[9:51] the third well next time I see him I'll
[9:54] I'll ask him about that I'll ask him why
[9:56] he didn't send me
[9:58] that we got a local guy that that that's
[10:01] he's a good guy but he he writes little
[10:03] commentaries and he quit sending them to
[10:05] me because I never responded to
[10:07] him he said he wanted to debate that
[10:10] that Cain would come from the
[10:12] devil or from the Beast I said okay I'll
[10:16] take it but he never say anymore take
[10:18] heed that no man deceive you for many
[10:20] shall come in my name so see if you take
[10:22] a father son Holy Ghost baptism what are
[10:24] you doing you're denying that's right my
[10:27] name you're denying it you denied the
[10:29] faith that's right one Faith one Lord
[10:32] one baptism that's what the Bible says
[10:34] that doesn't come out of a brandom
[10:36] commentary you know you understand what
[10:37] I'm saying everybody said brandom said
[10:39] brandom said whatever brother BR said he
[10:41] got to tie back to the word of God or a
[10:42] false prophet there's a place in the
[10:44] Bible talks about seven women take hold
[10:47] of one man right take hold of one man
[10:49] yep and how does that go but they don't
[10:52] want they what it is they want to keep
[10:54] their name and don't want to take on his
[10:55] name well that's that's the denomination
[10:57] right but now let's take it to the to
[11:00] the message of the hour listen how
[11:01] deceptive it is now the message of the
[11:04] hour teaches water baptism and the Lord
[11:06] Jesus Christ right I mean if you're in
[11:07] the message of the hour and you're not
[11:08] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:11] Christ I'm not going to say what daddy
[11:13] says
[11:16] stupid I mean really if you can't see it
[11:18] then and you're sitting in a message
[11:19] church then you you you're being
[11:21] deceived worse than anybody else that's
[11:23] right all right but what happens is now
[11:25] is see Satan he's got all that but he
[11:28] comes in message and he makes that the
[11:32] second
[11:33] Lord cuz there two Lords say the two
[11:36] Lord Doctrine or they make him not god
[11:41] Till The River Jordan well now his name
[11:44] was Jesus when he was born yeah he was
[11:47] born Lord the Christ and given the name
[11:49] Jesus does that say Lord Jesus Christ to
[11:51] you right so you see what he's done he's
[11:55] not out there now he's in here amen he's
[11:57] tearing the one go and but now hold on a
[11:59] minute it's like that
[12:02] brother I believe in one true Living God
[12:04] everybody in the message believes in one
[12:06] God but my heavenly days is look at all
[12:09] the two
[12:11] Lords all the other doct Jesus was God
[12:13] of the River Jordan you came here with a
[12:16] seed in you you didn't need this you
[12:17] didn't need that what's that doing
[12:19] that's tearing down the one God
[12:21] Revelation this whole message is based
[12:24] on one true and living God cuz remember
[12:26] they had it right down here amen when
[12:28] Paul says blessed be the God and father
[12:30] of our Lord Jesus Christ or May the God
[12:33] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:34] bless you all that's right there's no
[12:36] way in his mind and even in his human
[12:38] mind he he was talking about three or
[12:40] two or he knew that Jesus was almighty
[12:44] God you know why when that man was
[12:46] struck down and road to
[12:48] Damascus he said who art thou Lord so he
[12:52] knew there was a higher power remember
[12:53] he studied all the Scrolls he was a
[12:55] scholar yes who art thou Lord
[12:59] and when that man spoke and said I am
[13:02] Jesus whom you persecute Paul wasn't an
[13:05] idiot that's right Paul knew he never
[13:08] persecuted the man Jesus that's right
[13:11] that's right it struck him so hard that
[13:14] God had moved into another form called a
[13:16] bride and that he was persecuting the
[13:19] very thing that he should be grabbing
[13:22] hold of that's why I'm asking this
[13:24] question if the seventh seal is is
[13:26] coming and it has to come who's coming
[13:32] who is
[13:33] it can't be
[13:36] physical through us huh can't be
[13:42] physical we are going to read a quote
[13:49] but as Christ was the first one to raise
[13:52] rising of the Sun from all the prophets
[13:54] and so forth although typed in many
[13:56] places he was the first fruits of those
[13:58] that slep left and the bride coming of
[14:00] Christ coming out of the church they'll
[14:02] have to be a sheep wav again in the last
[14:04] day the bride coming of
[14:09] Christ so who's got to see this
[14:11] revelation of his coming only the bride
[14:14] will see this revelation of his coming
[14:16] see Jesus Jesus said and it's hard for
[14:20] it's hard for you to explain it to to
[14:22] someone that doesn't have a good
[14:24] knowledge of the Bible when Jesus said
[14:27] the world will see me no more but now he
[14:31] didn't stop there he said but you shall
[14:33] see me now how in the world are we going
[14:35] to see him and the world
[14:38] not now that word see means understand
[14:42] physically we're not going to see Jesus
[14:44] on this Earth until we come back with
[14:46] him in the
[14:49] Millennium right that's right brother BR
[14:51] said his holy feet cannot touch this
[14:53] Earth until it's burn over right so what
[14:56] is the seventh Cal it's his coming but
[14:58] it's not not just his
[15:01] coming it's the bride coming right so at
[15:04] the end of the seal you got to see
[15:06] yourself that's right you got to see the
[15:09] coming in you we will said in the Bri
[15:13] yes no one else will see it CU Jesus
[15:16] said You shall see me the world won't
[15:18] see me no more but you'll see me see
[15:19] what understand me you'll understand who
[15:22] I am more than the world will because
[15:23] the world is barred off cannot
[15:26] understand look at all the different
[15:27] doctrines all right even in the minute
[15:28] don't even want to no so the bride
[15:31] coming of Christ is what we're looking
[15:32] at I want to bring that in because watch
[15:35] we always we're humans amen we always
[15:38] put God way out you under we really do
[15:42] yes we do right yes I was thinking
[15:45] yesterday I um while I was
[15:48] delivering the mail truck is now my new
[15:50] lawnmower so I don't preach the lawn
[15:52] more anymore I preach to the ma to the
[15:54] mail yeah hey that mail's going to be
[15:56] anointed anyway I mean I SLI that mail
[15:58] in there
[15:59] bright light come on but now what did
[16:02] Jesus say Jesus
[16:03] said I'll go
[16:06] away oh you know what I was thinking
[16:08] about you know you seen those stickers
[16:09] that says um there was only one man who
[16:12] walked on water you know we're not
[16:14] perfect that's a
[16:16] lie that's a lie the Bible says Peter
[16:20] walked on the
[16:22] water and he didn't even have the Holy
[16:24] Ghost that's right he just believed that
[16:26] Jesus could do it I can do it that's
[16:28] right
[16:29] but now what did Jesus say though before
[16:30] he left he said the things I do shall
[16:35] you do also now do we believe
[16:38] that come on now do we believe
[16:41] that we tried he got up every day and
[16:44] you and he would come from God and he
[16:45] was going back to
[16:47] God that's true right he got up every
[16:49] day and as the Lord led him he did
[16:51] things I'm sure we're not the fullness
[16:53] of the godhead B we are not
[16:56] God as Jesus is is God Amen we never
[17:00] will be okay I'm sorry we but he's the
[17:03] fullness but whatever the fullness he is
[17:05] we get a part of which a part of is as
[17:08] much as
[17:10] the
[17:12] okay but that's what struck me I thought
[17:14] you know you don't we don't you we quote
[17:16] that all the time but do we really
[17:17] believe Jesus said the things I do so
[17:20] read Matthew Mark Luke and John and the
[17:23] book of Acts the things I do shall ye do
[17:26] also right and greater or more because
[17:30] he was one man in one
[17:33] place you know he didn't he didn't he
[17:35] didn't fly to India or to America or to
[17:39] Ireland or to Jamaica Philippines no he
[17:42] was one man but now we get in an
[17:45] airplane we fly to Jamaica Philippines
[17:48] Ireland India and we preach the gospel
[17:51] of God and we see signs Miracles and
[17:53] wonders that's the Greater Works is that
[17:56] we can go out and multiply what God did
[17:59] in one man standing on Earth in Israel
[18:02] and he was the seal
[18:05] yes so as he was the seventh seal the
[18:09] things that I do shall who do
[18:14] also who are you who are not r a r e who
[18:19] are you you got to know that that who is
[18:22] you that's right can we say that one
[18:23] more time that who is
[18:26] you but that struck me that yesterday
[18:28] thinking about that that that that's
[18:31] what this to me that's what the seal
[18:33] does as the Antichrist is destroying the
[18:37] revelation of one God then that first
[18:40] seal under the Lord Jesus Christ coming
[18:43] the bride coming of Christ it ought to
[18:45] take us to see us more like God
[18:48] okay cuz remember we're talking about
[18:50] justification here those who he has
[18:53] Justified he has
[18:55] already gled glorified
[18:59] okay but now there's many people going
[19:01] to be justified in the world Listen the
[19:03] Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus
[19:05] Christ and thou shalt be saved there's
[19:06] no stipulation to that you don't have to
[19:08] be a message believer to believe that
[19:10] that's right right right but now what
[19:13] about see remember though if they stay
[19:14] right there and keep
[19:17] sinning God has to account that sin to
[19:20] them and they have to be judged for
[19:22] that but once you're truly Justified
[19:25] then you go to sanctification then
[19:26] that's why brother had to come back and
[19:28] preach justification sanctification Bap
[19:30] of the Holy Ghost in the correct way
[19:32] that if you're truly Justified listen if
[19:34] you're truly Justified God's the only
[19:35] one that knows you're going to be
[19:36] glorified amen millions and billions of
[19:38] people have been Justified and going to
[19:40] go to hell
[19:42] okay yeah they are many people going to
[19:45] be Sanctified and they going to die and
[19:47] go to hell okay
[19:48] Judas that's right Judas was under the
[19:52] preaching of sanctification the prophet
[19:54] of God said and he was the son of
[19:56] predition that's why brother br said he
[19:58] said this seventh seal cannot be
[20:03] duplicated or copied the third pull
[20:05] can't be duplicated or copy why it's
[20:07] Christ
[20:07] himself in who form of a bride
[20:12] amen but the the the whole world we're
[20:15] not perfect just forgive them we're not
[20:17] you know we can't walk on water who do
[20:18] you think you
[20:19] are they asked Jesus the same
[20:22] thing they just didn't have a bumper
[20:24] sticker in the car to put it
[20:27] on remember the Pharisees and Sadducees
[20:29] I'll guarantee you they stood over in a
[20:31] corner and they talked about Jesus a lot
[20:34] yes and it wasn't good right who does he
[20:37] think he is no one perfect not this he
[20:40] can't be the Son of God he does this he
[20:42] does
[20:43] that the things I do so you do also okay
[20:48] he said I was despised and you'll be
[20:50] despised
[20:51] too and you'll be killed for my sake if
[20:53] you keep reading in Matthew it keeps
[20:55] telling you that you'll be killed for my
[20:57] sake because he was killed he was killed
[21:00] because he told the world he was the son
[21:02] of
[21:03] God right or he proved to the world
[21:06] really but they turned him
[21:09] down so under the first
[21:12] seal justifica I see
[21:15] justification but it's not the
[21:17] justification to chop off your past sins
[21:18] you should already done that back that's
[21:21] the Son of God Revelation that's right
[21:23] got it that's the
[21:25] Cornerstone the Cornerstone revelation
[21:27] of
[21:28] this um bride as a whole I'm taking the
[21:32] bride from here all the way through the
[21:35] Cornerstone the foundation of your
[21:37] Revelation should be one true and living
[21:39] God the Lord Jesus Christ is his name
[21:41] and that's the baptism you should that
[21:43] we must go by right and one true and
[21:46] living God now once you see that that's
[21:49] like what brother Dale was talking to
[21:51] brother dick he talking about one God
[21:52] well I believe in one God then first
[21:54] name day said what about your
[21:56] baptism if you believe in one true and
[21:57] living God you got to be married to him
[21:59] he's got to you're got to be his bride
[22:01] you can't be Miss Father Son and Holy
[22:04] Ghost you can't be Miss father son Holy
[22:06] Ghost right you got to be Miss Jesus
[22:09] Christ yeah Jim didn't stay you know she
[22:12] she's now she's a
[22:13] Dale why because we marri and then in
[22:16] the Christ coming of coming of Christ
[22:18] coming out of the church what
[22:20] marrying we're married to Christ now
[22:23] amen then we should lose our name and
[22:25] take on his amen right so the seals tell
[22:28] me though in this justification is that
[22:30] if his coming is
[22:32] us then we stand just as just as Jesus
[22:35] did on the earth yes well is that too
[22:39] hard yeah it must be we've been here 50
[22:42] 50 something years since the prophet
[22:44] preached the message and I'm not
[22:45] laughing I'm just I'm just saying we we
[22:48] sometimes we're silly when we say yeah I
[22:50] believe
[22:51] that but do we really believe that we
[22:55] believe it for somebody else well that's
[22:57] what I'm saying saying we believe it
[22:58] that Jesus can walk on
[23:00] water and I don't believe that if I go
[23:03] out there I'm just going to walk out and
[23:04] walk on water but I'm going to tell you
[23:05] something if God comes on the scene like
[23:08] he did to Peter and me with the Holy
[23:10] Ghost and I have a need of it see that's
[23:12] why that's why you have to be careful
[23:14] cuz the devil can throw these signs and
[23:16] wonders out frivolously frivolously you
[23:20] say that prly prly you know why wait I'm
[23:23] going to go walk on water cuz I'm godone
[23:25] no You'll Never Walk you know you might
[23:27] get an anointing and might try it but
[23:29] you're going to do like Peter you're
[23:30] going to start
[23:31] sinking some kind of circumstance is
[23:34] going to happen around you you'll know
[23:36] then that's not
[23:38] God show that was Peter or show off
[23:40] that's exactly what Satan is he's a he's
[23:42] a flashy show
[23:45] off but I'll promise
[23:47] you Paul stood one day and he said the
[23:50] angel that Stood Beside of me remember
[23:52] now what happened was that boat was was
[23:55] in a storm they were getting ready to
[23:57] get in a boat and leave now you would
[24:00] think in your mind that that would be
[24:01] the most safe thing to do is get in a
[24:03] boat and try to make it to
[24:06] shore Paul so convinced those 200 people
[24:10] I think it was he said hold it I can see
[24:13] old Paul standing up on the boat he said
[24:15] hold on that he said the angel that
[24:17] Stood Beside Me last
[24:20] night I believe Paul had an angel come
[24:22] in just like brother R got an angel any
[24:24] prophet's got an angel that takes care
[24:26] of him that they can see I believe he
[24:28] said the angel that stood by him stood
[24:30] he wasn't up in the air flying around he
[24:32] stood by him brother Brown didn't see
[24:34] Angels flying around in the air he saw
[24:35] people walking on the
[24:37] ground so as we see Paul said the angel
[24:41] stood by me said don't leave the boat
[24:43] but everybody will be saved now you
[24:45] think listen you got to think them old
[24:47] fishermen thought man this guy's crazy
[24:50] and we need to get off this boat but he
[24:53] so convinced them he said if you'll stay
[24:55] on this boat not one of you will lose
[24:57] your life and you know what the boat got
[25:00] tore to Smither rings and they had to
[25:01] Flo in on they were holding some of them
[25:04] they talking about were holding on to
[25:05] the to the slap of the old ship that was
[25:07] gone that's right but they were saved
[25:10] that's that's why I said you know
[25:11] sometimes we look at it we think well
[25:12] this is the best
[25:14] way and you get somebody come along say
[25:16] hold on a minute or you get to one
[25:18] inside of you say hold on a minute
[25:20] yes be still and know that I am God am I
[25:26] calling me
[25:33] I don't know who that is probably tell
[25:37] Market many minutes he's telling me to
[25:40] shut up he's probably watching online
[25:42] that brother trying to call you that
[25:43] brother trying to call me oh okay all
[25:45] right no he's don't live in Atlanta he
[25:47] lives a lot closer than
[25:51] that but do you see what I'm talking
[25:54] about yes when Jesus said the things
[25:56] that I do shall you do also we quote
[25:57] that and quote that but look go back and
[25:59] look at the things he done you got to be
[26:02] able to do the same
[26:03] thing Jesus wasn't to show
[26:06] off right he didn't show off he he he
[26:09] always um gave the credit to the father
[26:13] right which was in him right right Jesus
[26:17] answered take heed that no man deceive
[26:20] you now the deception especially the the
[26:23] deception in this end time is is that
[26:25] you were born with this seed in you and
[26:27] you don't need to struggle you don't
[26:29] need to fight you don't I mean I don't
[26:31] know what in the world I'd like to
[26:32] really sit with about 10 or 15 of them
[26:34] and ask them what they what the new
[26:36] birth in the Holy Ghost is for right
[26:38] yeah you can't be born with a holy ghost
[26:40] right I mean Heavenly days there's only
[26:42] one person ever been born with the Holy
[26:43] gohost and that was God himself amen we
[26:47] were born in sin so there has to be a
[26:49] separation there is no way I'm going to
[26:51] tell you this right now there is no way
[26:53] that I can walk up at the day of
[26:56] judgment if I'm a sinner
[26:59] knowing what I know now if I walked up
[27:03] first thing I'd do is I'd say you said
[27:06] they had something I didn't
[27:08] have talking about the bride standing in
[27:10] judgment that's the first thing I'd
[27:12] asked I'd say you said you gave them
[27:14] something that I didn't
[27:16] have then you respected them and not me
[27:19] how you going to judge
[27:20] me right honestly that's right that's
[27:24] but for us to know that we were just
[27:26] like that man stand in there and for God
[27:29] to look down and say Hey you had a
[27:31] chance here's the day here's the hour
[27:33] he's got to tell him that to me that's a
[27:35] just judge here's the day here's the
[27:38] hour I came to you and the difference in
[27:39] you and this guy right here our sister
[27:41] right here they accepted it and you did
[27:44] that's right settled the whole ball game
[27:47] to me that there's no way then that that
[27:49] person can argue that's right cuz it's
[27:51] going to come right back to him hey is
[27:55] right cuz you know they sear their
[27:56] conscience where they don't think about
[27:57] no
[27:58] more but see to me that's a righteous
[28:01] judge to be able to judge he's going to
[28:04] have to put everybody on the same
[28:06] playing field and say okay these will
[28:08] accept and these won't sure he knows
[28:10] that but we don't we've got to you know
[28:14] like the the quote where brother Brown
[28:15] says that in the upper room that the
[28:17] Holy Ghost fell on Sons well see that's
[28:19] where they go to is that we were born
[28:21] sons of
[28:22] God now it fell on Sons because God knew
[28:25] that was God's mind knowing that they
[28:27] were Sons not them they didn't know they
[28:29] were Sons amen my heaven that's the
[28:32] furthest thing from their mind they were
[28:33] scared to death they wer sitting up
[28:36] there and saying well bless God when the
[28:37] Holy Ghost come just going to quick and
[28:38] everything I got already in me we're
[28:40] going to be just fine no they were up
[28:43] there brother R said with the door shut
[28:44] windows locked scared to
[28:47] death then when the Holy Ghost quickened
[28:50] what they had in their
[28:51] soul they run out the door and said hey
[28:53] we really don't care that's right we got
[28:56] what that man told us we was going to
[28:57] get get okay so that's the difference
[28:59] but see there's another doctrine that
[29:00] will take you away from a true
[29:04] Revelation see that doesn't to me simple
[29:07] simply is we were all born in sin we all
[29:09] had to either accept or reject Christ to
[29:11] me that just the simplest but now to say
[29:14] well I was this seed and I it was
[29:16] already in me and as a baby and I did
[29:18] this and I did that to me that's more
[29:21] confusing we're all born in sin amen
[29:24] everybody but Jesus Christ was born the
[29:25] same way that's right mhm right so that
[29:29] way he's a righteous judge right see to
[29:33] me that's a
[29:34] revelation it's not a revelation to say
[29:37] that you had the eternal life in your
[29:38] soul that when you were born a
[29:43] baby the things I did I knew I knew I
[29:46] didn't have God in Me that's that's what
[29:48] the people ought to see right sister the
[29:50] people ought to go back in their mind
[29:52] and in their I don't care if you want
[29:54] squeaky clean you still had things that
[29:56] you shouldn't have done that's right
[29:58] when you were younger that the Holy
[29:59] Ghost ain't got nothing to do with
[30:01] that's right right wasn't nowhere around
[30:05] oh yeah he was watching over you but he
[30:06] was not in your residing in your person
[30:08] when you were doing the things you were
[30:10] doing you're believing you're not
[30:12] believing right either no you don't
[30:14] believe none of
[30:16] that I come to church a couple of times
[30:19] a year just so M just make Mama
[30:22] happy honestly what I I sat there and
[30:25] thought about work and about playing
[30:27] ball and about this and wonder what the
[30:30] Falcons are doing and
[30:32] you
[30:33] why oh but brother you had that se if
[30:36] that listen if that seed was in Paul Why
[30:38] didn't it Quicken on the road to
[30:42] Damascus why did he have to go to
[30:44] another body of Christ to the body to
[30:47] get that seed Made Alive that's right
[30:49] right why didn't when Jesus said receive
[30:51] ye the Holy Ghost to all the
[30:54] disciples they were all there receive ye
[30:56] the holy go why didn't they just receive
[30:59] it right there that was God Almighty
[31:00] himself that was the that was the very
[31:02] tube that they needed they needed that
[31:05] why didn't they receive it right them
[31:06] cuz they had the word inside he he had
[31:09] talked to them for three and A2 years
[31:11] yes sir why didn't he say receive you
[31:13] the Holy Ghost and they just boom we
[31:15] don't need to go in the upper room we
[31:16] got it now no why don't God condemn them
[31:20] if they was born with it right like he
[31:23] condemns us now when we do have it well
[31:25] they told Peter he said get behind Satan
[31:27] so I don't know where in the world Satan
[31:29] was at at the time but I know where God
[31:31] wasn't that's right he wasn't in Peter
[31:33] at that moment that's right that's why
[31:35] if you read Oneness with God I love that
[31:37] quote I keep it in my
[31:38] house he's talking about the disciples
[31:41] denying him like Peter denying him he
[31:42] said God wasn't in those disciples yet
[31:45] well
[31:46] okay if he wasn't in them he wasn't in
[31:52] them thank you brother I was wondering
[31:54] when you going to
[31:56] startop take heed that no man deceive
[31:58] you boy right off the bat you're going
[31:59] to be try to be deceived Satan's going
[32:02] to try to deceive you right for many not
[32:05] to a three many shall come in my name
[32:07] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[32:10] many what telling them they're Christ
[32:12] because they'll have signs and wonders
[32:13] and the great things and the great
[32:14] Miracles I've always said and I'll stay
[32:17] with it till we get out of here
[32:19] somebody's going to raise up that's
[32:21] right in this messag amen with signs and
[32:24] wonders and miracles that you will not
[32:26] be able to deny that it's God and he'll
[32:29] be false in the word and the people will
[32:32] flock to
[32:33] him flock to him not care what he's
[32:35] preaching but they'll flock to those
[32:37] signs and
[32:38] wonders cuz that's what Satan's into
[32:40] he's into the signs and the Wonders and
[32:41] the feelings Now you listen what is
[32:43] false unowned one it's the true Holy
[32:46] Ghost healing the people raising the
[32:49] dead Satan can't do that that's true the
[32:52] brother I'm said the person's fault
[32:54] inside
[32:56] okay
[32:57] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[32:59] wars see that you not be troubled for
[33:01] all these things must come to pass but
[33:04] the end is not yet we're going on toward
[33:06] the second seal so I'm going to go and
[33:08] read it for nation shall rise against
[33:09] nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and
[33:11] there shall be famines and pestilence
[33:12] and earthquake diverse places all these
[33:15] are the beginning of Sorrows did y'all
[33:18] see the other day I look read it a
[33:20] little more this morning Bob sent me a
[33:21] link Russia is headed towards Syria with
[33:25] the biggest war Fleet since to World War
[33:27] III with the biggest Fleet they're
[33:29] coming now they not going they're not
[33:30] sending one boat no they got a fleet
[33:33] heading toward Syria cuz they want that
[33:35] Syrian president to stay in power and
[33:38] then he sent the quote link where
[33:39] brother Brown said watch Russia when
[33:40] they come after the oil where's Syria
[33:43] right right in the oil District listen
[33:45] I'm going to tell you something I think
[33:46] about this morning we're not going to be
[33:48] just able to read what's
[33:51] happening we are going to be in high
[33:54] defin color right in the middle midle of
[33:58] it and that's what God
[34:01] knew he knew we'd be right in the middle
[34:03] of it that's why he said be careful
[34:06] watch but see if you're truly Justified
[34:08] then your sins are forgiven then you go
[34:10] through sanctification and baptism Holy
[34:12] Ghost well if you see that that's fine
[34:15] but to me I've always call that baby
[34:16] form justification but the justification
[34:18] that we see in the seals is not that you
[34:21] that you that you were not even part of
[34:23] that sure your flesh did all the things
[34:25] that you did I'm sorry hold on a minute
[34:28] your spirit did all those things the
[34:30] Inside Man right remember your flesh
[34:33] don't do anything except what's inside
[34:35] man motivat all right
[34:38] so we look and see that that happens
[34:41] then we see that we see that we're born
[34:44] again in our soul but we need more work
[34:47] that's perfect man this works on our
[34:49] spirit realm it does yes yes cuz
[34:55] remember bear with me just a second
[34:58] we're not getting anywhere but we'll get
[34:59] to it next Sunday now this is Brother R
[35:02] Drew these right here right uh Soul
[35:06] spirit and body right now if you cut you
[35:09] in in half you wouldn't see that right
[35:12] but that's a illustration of this being
[35:16] the outside of man body spirit and soul
[35:19] now this is either Faith or doubt it's
[35:21] not like
[35:22] this
[35:25] right right
[35:29] this can
[35:31] be this can be like that that's right
[35:35] yes right yes but that can right it's
[35:40] either white or
[35:42] black so really what are we working on
[35:46] this there's your
[35:49] filter there's your filter cuz listen if
[35:53] Jesus comes
[35:54] back this is what I think we believe
[35:56] this is what I think we believe we get
[35:58] the Holy Ghost and we get about that
[36:01] much I mean the new birth I'm talking
[36:03] about old man cleaned out God comeing
[36:05] and reside in your soul then all of a
[36:07] sudden a few more years later it does
[36:08] like
[36:12] this that's not it right that Soul come
[36:16] from God it's Eternal perfect never sin
[36:19] a day in its life never had a bad
[36:21] thought never did those things never had
[36:24] a beginning and never had an
[36:25] end yeah so where's our
[36:38] problem God and the
[36:41] devil half of it here but now this right
[36:43] here if you're born again it's all what
[36:46] right so he's still working on me but
[36:49] it's not in the soul that thing's
[36:52] perfect what you know what he's trying
[36:53] to do if God gets in here and starts
[36:55] going this way
[36:58] that's where we have a
[37:01] problem if we don't see one true and
[37:03] living God guess what filter gets
[37:06] stopped up okay listen you're not
[37:10] training your soul
[37:14] right everybody see that so you you we
[37:16] don't really see what we the new birth
[37:18] that we have we don't see what it is
[37:20] it's the fullness of God in your part
[37:23] not half God part god 2/3 thir
[37:28] 10 if you got the new birth you've got
[37:31] the soul of almighty God in your soul
[37:37] right that's true justification those
[37:39] who is Justified he's already got that
[37:42] whole
[37:45] thing but that's our problem we think
[37:48] that when we get the Holy Ghost and sure
[37:49] brother B says we get the Holy Ghost is
[37:51] like a little
[37:53] button well it's like a teaspoon of the
[37:55] ocean right that's the whole it's the
[37:58] whole ocean right it's just part your
[38:00] part that's right so our problem is it's
[38:03] got to be in the spirit realm because if
[38:04] your soul is eternal
[38:07] listen if your soul is eternal what's
[38:10] wrong with it nothing
[38:13] nothing it don't can't even be
[38:16] judged now the Deeds that we do here yes
[38:19] we're going to be judged but that Soul
[38:21] cannot be judged if he said I'm coming
[38:24] back and the things I do you do a
[38:27] comforter I'm going to reside in
[38:29] you not on you that's anointed ones the
[38:33] anointed ones this guy right here this
[38:36] is still
[38:37] black huh yes but God will have to go by
[38:41] his word if they meet a certain
[38:43] requirement and in this realm here
[38:46] they're falely
[38:48] anointed okay can't be falely anointed
[38:50] in their
[38:52] soul they're either born again or not
[38:56] that's
[38:57] right so that Spirit realm is where this
[39:00] works that's right now do you have faith
[39:04] in your soul if you're born again it is
[39:06] Faith don't that you have it it is
[39:08] Faith it is virtue where did Jesus get
[39:10] his virtue from in person inside of
[39:13] knowledge Temperance what our problem is
[39:15] is we take the knowledge of the Holy
[39:17] Ghost knowledge and it's got to come
[39:20] through this junky filter called memory
[39:24] reasoning there's no memory reason
[39:26] conscious affection in that Soul that's
[39:28] right see that mean when that seal broke
[39:31] to brother R him he saw something go
[39:34] away from him that wasn't in his soul it
[39:37] was bothering him and it didn't it
[39:39] didn't quit bothering him you understand
[39:40] what I'm saying but he was he identified
[39:44] because the scripture says there in
[39:45] Hebrews that the word is a two-edged
[39:48] sword that what does it do it discerns
[39:52] the soul from the spirit and we stopped
[39:55] there but I read it the other day what's
[39:57] joint and
[39:58] Marrow does your spirit have joint and
[40:00] Marrow does your soul have joint and
[40:02] Marrow your body has joint and Mar so he
[40:05] covered all three cuz see we always stop
[40:08] and say Well it divides the soul and the
[40:10] spirit it says and the joint in the
[40:12] mouth it it tells you what your flesh
[40:15] does your spirit and your soul we got to
[40:17] go we'll pick this up next Sunday sorry
[40:21] for getting off the line a little
[40:25] bit
