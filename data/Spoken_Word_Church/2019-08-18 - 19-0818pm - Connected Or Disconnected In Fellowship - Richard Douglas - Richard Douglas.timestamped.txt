[35:13] life of God but you're not hooked up
[35:15] right amen I believe that and I believe
[35:18] God is able to put this together and if
[35:20] we we could wire this light up even you
[35:22] can cross the wires and their work but
[35:24] they'll burn up that's what's happening
[35:26] around the message love people are
[35:27] burning up they're burning out the
[35:29] others say it that way they're burning
[35:31] me out because they've not been
[35:33] connected right they've not been
[35:34] connected right to Jesus Christ and
[35:36] let's look up into the book of Genesis
[35:37] turn with me to Genesis chapter 3 and
[35:39] let's look at how Satan had a design but
[35:42] God already had a plan Satan had wanted
[35:45] to design broad-breasted he did he said
[35:48] he offered to design the woman but God
[35:51] and God knew that he was going to do it
[35:53] but he God had a plan God was not caught
[35:55] off guard
[35:56] he didn't just walk into this and say oh
[35:59] man I wonder wait a minute let me like
[36:01] we do sometimes what am I gonna do he's
[36:02] off already no that's why in the Bible
[36:04] said he's slaying the lamb of God before
[36:06] the foundation of the world he already
[36:08] had a connection that he was going he
[36:10] was going straight
[36:10] is back up in our wiring because he knew
[36:13] Satan will try to come in and mix those
[36:15] bloodlines and when he mixed those
[36:17] bloodlines
[36:18] he created the positive and negative
[36:20] together instead of being separate where
[36:23] they could free flow through and receive
[36:24] the right power would they didn't get
[36:26] sick they didn't have hard hates they
[36:29] didn't have troubles they wasn't no sin
[36:32] there was none of that that was fugly
[36:34] speak the word and it happened they said
[36:36] I got to mix this bloodline Jesus said I
[36:39] got a royal bloodline coming I've
[36:41] already paid for it I got redemptive
[36:43] power I've been wanting to illustrate
[36:46] those I've got one to heal I can't do it
[36:48] this is gonna happen but it's not it's
[36:51] gonna be for my glory
[36:52] it might Rory alone and as we look at
[36:55] this scripture here it says in in
[36:57] Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 it says now
[36:59] the serpent was more subtil
[37:01] he was hey he was smarter than a lot of
[37:05] people are it's smart and a lot of
[37:08] people he had a septum means he had
[37:10] knowledge of all things he was smart
[37:14] enough to know that if he Satan is that
[37:16] he was the smartest one he could use he
[37:17] couldn't use a monkey he couldn't use a
[37:19] gorilla he couldn't use any of those
[37:21] things he's gonna use the beast cuz he
[37:23] was that he was the only wasting he was
[37:25] to want they could mix the blood line
[37:27] with they could inject his perversion in
[37:30] there but God said I got that covered
[37:32] I'm already ahead of you see he says
[37:34] more subtle than any beast of the field
[37:37] which the Lord had made and he said unto
[37:40] the woman yea hath God said he didn't
[37:44] just come out and tell her hey wait a
[37:46] minute now
[37:46] God don't know what he's talking about
[37:47] let me take something that wouldn't work
[37:49] that what they don't work on me and you
[37:51] if you tell me God don't know what he's
[37:53] telling me I already then turns you off
[37:54] this is a ok and the brother bran didn't
[37:58] know what he's talking about I just get
[37:59] y'all you know the man of God don't know
[38:01] he's talking about the real man ago I
[38:02] cut you off and that's what problem is
[38:05] we got some mini parking lot of
[38:06] preachers around the message you know
[38:07] the man who got this up here you know
[38:09] the Word of God is that the word is
[38:11] still good safe it's still good to say
[38:13] but the Bible said he got choked out
[38:15] what we get choked out is because we let
[38:17] the cares of life choke the word out
[38:19] that brought breaks the connection the
[38:21] fellowship that's what Eve did she let
[38:23] that see
[38:23] that that the care of her life more than
[38:27] taking it over the faith that God had
[38:29] her hid she took wisdom she said I'll
[38:31] take this I'll take this I'll take this
[38:33] as a substitute he said you shall not
[38:35] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[38:37] woman said and then she began to preach
[38:39] back to him and the woman said unto the
[38:41] serpent we may eat of the tree of the
[38:43] fruit of the trees of the garden but of
[38:46] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[38:48] midst of the garden God has said you
[38:50] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[38:52] touch it lest you die and the surface
[38:55] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[38:56] die just takes one oh let's just take
[38:59] the cross you get two wires getting the
[39:01] burn the thing up it all it takes just
[39:03] one cross and wire when you doubt one
[39:05] word of God the end your wires crossed
[39:07] no matter what you say no matter how
[39:09] your trial didn't what you do if you've
[39:10] got a problem with the whole truth of
[39:12] God something's wrong with your wine
[39:13] you've got a connection somewhere it's
[39:15] messed up
[39:16] you're not gonna be able to live to the
[39:17] fullness that you're supposed to until
[39:18] God comes down and connects you the way
[39:20] you should be I said and for God does
[39:24] know listen at him now he says for God
[39:26] does nothing in the day you eat thereof
[39:28] then your eyes shall be open their eyes
[39:30] is already open he was offering for
[39:32] something he was I never seen the
[39:33] serpent command name the animals I never
[39:35] tell never heard the servant tell north
[39:38] wind stopped blowing south wind blow
[39:39] listen what he tells me he says and you
[39:43] shall be as gods he wasn't no God mmm he
[39:48] was trying to take it her to believe
[39:50] that she could take something but it was
[39:52] a lower level they already was in that
[39:54] position they they obeyed had the
[39:59] serpent he never named one animal he was
[40:02] saying look he's gonna be like me go mr.
[40:03] Perry who's gonna know good and see what
[40:05] the problem was
[40:06] it wasn't that that the tree was bad it
[40:08] was was it was give you the knowledge of
[40:10] good and evil
[40:12] how to commit evil not only is it good
[40:15] just like the cell phone let's look at
[40:17] that I believe there's sometimes that's
[40:18] been a trick to us it's been a trick to
[40:20] us that's not I come off the tree of
[40:22] knowledge it can be used for good always
[40:24] been used for great good but you got to
[40:26] watch that cause it's good and evil
[40:28] that's what was wrong with the treated
[40:30] treat was good and evil mmm people
[40:33] misunderstand that then within the
[40:34] answer kids have a cell phone and they
[40:36] don't wash them down
[40:37] and see the Holy Ghost and they wonder
[40:39] why their kids are in the shape they're
[40:40] in or wondering why their wife's into
[40:42] shaping and then wonder why this because
[40:43] hey right now even when you look I don't
[40:46] care what if you look at something good
[40:47] there'll always be something pop up a
[40:48] little thing on there say says just stop
[40:51] for a minute here
[40:52] that's the way you always tries to do us
[40:54] so we've got to be careful let's put it
[40:56] all of our attention on him instead of
[40:57] on that knowledge knowledge shall
[41:00] increase its increasing but as people
[41:03] get closer to God then what's our
[41:06] problem it but what's gonna happen to
[41:07] ask for attention is if we don't wash it
[41:09] from what we've received in this hour
[41:11] we're gonna be in trouble cause little
[41:13] known little required but much snow
[41:17] months require we require a great deal
[41:19] more than they are you're required more
[41:21] than a Methodist
[41:22] you're required more of using the
[41:24] Baptist's you know that's the best thing
[41:26] they can do for you the Baptist of the
[41:28] Memphis they can bring own thing they
[41:29] can do you is bring you to the white
[41:31] throne judgment that's the best place
[41:34] they can bring but this message this
[41:36] truth can bring us to a body change
[41:40] bring us to a rapture branch the
[41:43] perfection in Jesus Christ and this is
[41:45] the only place that you can get it is in
[41:50] this message for the proper set in this
[41:53] message
[41:54] it's rapturing faith then why do you
[41:58] want to connect to anything besides that
[42:01] oh I have something for the grace of God
[42:07] ain't you should you be God's knowing
[42:10] good and evil
[42:12] why do they need to know evil when they
[42:14] was livin good there was no sin not to
[42:17] tempt them there's never seen until you
[42:21] yield yourself to the lusts there you
[42:25] can't say well God tempted me he didn't
[42:27] for God's not tainted by sin neither can
[42:29] he be tempted even when the devil come
[42:33] to tempt him he was come to try he was
[42:36] no champion he didn't have any champion
[42:39] where he was the word you can't tempt
[42:42] God neither's he tempted but he was sure
[42:47] look is good and evil
[42:49] listen what she did he says that when
[42:52] the woman saw that the tree was good for
[42:53] food and that it was pleasant to the
[42:57] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[43:00] one wise she took of the fruit thereof
[43:03] and did eat and gave her her husband
[43:06] with her and he did eat listen what
[43:10] happens if it was so good then why did
[43:12] it open there's why did it open a veil
[43:14] of lust then he was such a great thing
[43:17] God would have given some rose to back
[43:21] but he said and their eye and the eyes
[43:24] are both of them were opened and they
[43:28] knew that they were naked they never
[43:31] knew that before they never lost it to
[43:33] one another than until the end then
[43:36] their eyes open they seemed wow we're
[43:41] naked
[43:41] you've always been naked I mean you're
[43:48] not writing the right apparel it's not
[43:52] only just naked naked this is brother
[43:54] Aaron was telling about this the wrong
[43:56] apparel naked you're not wearing what
[43:59] God is supplied for you so guess what
[44:02] they got a substitute in this what they
[44:05] learned how to sew they never said it
[44:09] before but there so Dan said they sewed
[44:12] fig leaves together and then if it was
[44:14] just by the income of an apple why
[44:17] didn't they sew something on their mouth
[44:19] why did they sew and everywhere else
[44:24] simple things so I can't believe that
[44:27] said what can't see the word said it is
[44:30] because they don't have understanding
[44:31] they don't have the tree hmm said they
[44:34] was naked and then they started hiding
[44:37] from God the fellowship was broken when
[44:39] they disbelieved the Word of God when
[44:41] the idea was already committed in their
[44:43] mind before she ever did act the first
[44:46] thing was she listened they told me this
[44:49] morning we listen and then he began to
[44:52] reason his revelation - because there
[44:59] won't be nothing no kind of God like you
[45:00] false God
[45:02] seyton get a recognition of being a god
[45:04] he said he's the god of this evil age
[45:06] he's not the true and living God
[45:09] he gets the bane you know what he got to
[45:11] the place to work he stays a conference
[45:13] what he said he would do because he's
[45:16] even feeling what he had in his mind to
[45:17] do then why are we not fulfilling what
[45:19] we're supposed to do then if he's
[45:22] received the power to do that by Louise
[45:24] then how come we've not received apart
[45:26] we have we've just not got enough faith
[45:29] to operate it we're not exercising mmm
[45:33] we're not exercising that faith he gave
[45:35] us a measure each and every one who us a
[45:37] measure of faith to fulfill the Word of
[45:39] God he gave you can't even you can't
[45:42] even rejoice in your own faith because
[45:44] he gave it to you it's his faith to
[45:47] believe in his word so the equation just
[45:51] puts you out and wires you right back to
[45:52] him and we got to be connected to Jesus
[45:56] Christ this message didn't come - turns
[46:00] away this message kind of turns back
[46:04] this message it kind of made me walk
[46:06] away to get this groan after several
[46:09] years real chance to say oh well I'm
[46:11] giving it up I guess then what I thought
[46:13] they'd go problem is what you thought
[46:14] that's the same thing with happening
[46:16] with the Israel they thought he was
[46:18] going to be something then he wasn't
[46:20] time for him to be he was time for him
[46:22] to be a savior it was time for him to
[46:25] kill the stand of sin for me in you they
[46:28] thought he's gonna be a great general
[46:30] but they didn't rise he is a great
[46:32] general he is a great warrior that's the
[46:35] only reason he defeated sin that's the
[46:37] only reason he defeated Satan that's the
[46:40] only reason he took the keys of death he
[46:41] loved it because he was a general he was
[46:45] God Almighty and if you notice she lost
[46:51] her respect for him at first even the
[46:55] circle was saying Lord God and after
[46:58] wife said she began to say God
[47:01] anything's a god brother Donny but
[47:05] there's only one Lord God by the town
[47:08] and that's Jesus Christ she would give
[47:11] us a guard just like him that disrespect
[47:13] that's what happens people fail to
[47:15] receive the lordship of this message he
[47:21] said everybody wants him to be their
[47:23] healer everybody wants to be their
[47:25] Savior but very few will any be Lord and
[47:28] until we get to the place they be Lord
[47:30] we ain't connected right we're messed up
[47:32] she even begin to say God
[47:34] so you could say neighbor before that if
[47:36] you read the whole that it was Lord God
[47:38] Lord God Lord God Lord God not once when
[47:41] this happened God see that's Rudy is he
[47:50] said well I believe he's God but is he
[47:53] Lord God that's why they don't care if
[47:59] you say oh don't miss the name of Jesus
[48:01] you can pray you can say God just don't
[48:04] don't put a name on him I said what's
[48:07] wrong with the Lord Jesus Christ God now
[48:10] I say he's got a name he's got a name
[48:15] oh yeah father son hope he's got a name
[48:19] you got a name I got a name if you just
[48:24] sign the check down our Father they're
[48:26] not going to catch it if I sign it sign
[48:29] they're not going to catch it but you
[48:33] put your name down that Lord Jesus
[48:34] Christ or Richard Dale Douglas they'll
[48:36] cash it if I got the sufficient funds
[48:38] that's what Jesus did he come and wrote
[48:40] his name on the check and gave it to
[48:43] brother Louise he said you catch it I
[48:47] got sufficient funds now after the blood
[48:50] of Jesus Christ to the through Calvary
[48:53] I'll give you the pile áfourá t over the
[48:56] devil hallelujah oh that kid and then
[49:05] guess what the fellowship they walked
[49:08] with him really done oh how wonderful it
[49:11] is what would it come down every evening
[49:15] just like this afternoon
[49:18] everything walk
[49:20] are you doing having a good day
[49:24] oh it's your presence they never hid
[49:27] from him before brother Donny
[49:29] boy this God did he give him you'll
[49:32] become gods they become gods all right
[49:34] not that God warning this is what he
[49:39] said this is his the house number and
[49:41] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[49:42] themselves aprons and they heard the
[49:44] voice of the Lord walking in the garden
[49:47] who's ever heard who's never seen a
[49:49] voice walk he was walking they heard his
[49:55] voice he was talking to him where are
[49:59] you I've never run he's here now Eve Wow
[50:06] it's and they see him but rush never

[50:13] you did he sought you he sought you he
[50:18] just woke you up said look you're mine I
[50:21] got claims on you and they heard the
[50:26] voice of the Lord walking in the garden
[50:28] in the cool of the day and had him and
[50:30] his wife hid themselves from the
[50:32] presence of the Lord
[50:33] amongst the trees of the garden you know
[50:37] sometimes we can't see therefore horse
[50:38] we can't see the forest because of the
[50:41] trees just because you're standing
[50:43] before you said couple trees rubbish you
[50:45] ain't seen the whole forest yet he
[50:47] thought it was nothing was hid from him
[50:49] he knew he didn't see what this that's
[50:52] the question
[50:53] who told you he knows nothing he was
[50:56] wanting to confess see that's the way it
[50:58] is that's what's hard for a man to do
[50:59] brother Anees admit he's wrong and
[51:01] confess it he was he had the atonement
[51:05] he had the price paid
[51:06] he was show her yeah oh you got to do is
[51:08] just say I messed up Lord but he said
[51:11] you know that ha ha ha ha boy you give
[51:16] me a boo-boo when you give her to me

[52:25] nature to bite you hmm and then they
[52:29] will pass it on down but let's let's
[52:31] look over here let's turn over to the
[52:33] book of the first John let's look at
[52:36] this just for a minute first John
[52:38] chapter 3 let's turn over here look at
[52:41] these things let's look at what happened
[52:43] watch al other scriptures don't you he
[52:51] said listen he said Behold what manner
[52:57] verse one first John chapter 3 but what
[53:00] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[53:01] upon us that we should be called the
[53:04] sons of God putting us back in our
[53:06] position sons not service sons hmm that
[53:13] we should be called the sons of God
[53:15] we're of the world knoweth us not
[53:17] because it knew him not they knew him
[53:21] they wouldn't kill him he said beloved
[53:23] now we are now we are you know what
[53:26] people have problems that brother Louise
[53:28] well when I get there I'm Oh son
[53:30] you already son you ain't going there if
[53:32] you ain't a son now you ain't going here
[53:33] go be one people say old words he's
[53:36] didn't become content in the war he was
[53:38] already gone
[53:39] that didn't make him God don't want your
[53:42] baptism makes you a son of God
[53:44] hmm that's just outward confession of an
[53:47] inward work the lamb had to be washed to
[53:50] be sacrificed just like us if it
[53:52] receives a sacrifice of God always was
[53:59] well now are the sons of God and it does
[54:03] not yet appear what we shall be but we
[54:07] know that when he shall appear we shall
[54:09] be like him for we shall see him as he
[54:13] is won't be no blinders then won't be
[54:18] hold it will see him for what he really
[54:19] is we're seeing that's what this message
[54:22] come to do to see Jesus for who he
[54:24] really is
[54:26] it says an every man that hath this hope
[54:29] in him purifies himself even as his pure
[54:34] without that hope you're not purified
[54:37] within yourself that has to be there
[54:40] everyone has to be connected he said who
[54:46] said we commit a sin transgresses also
[54:48] the law for sin is the transgression of
[54:52] the law and you know that he was
[54:55] manifested to take away our sin and in
[54:59] him is no sin the Bible said he became
[55:03] sin that didn't say he's saying said he
[55:06] became our sins that we might become the
[55:08] residence of God he says whosoever
[55:11] abideth in him sin it's not he said
[55:14] whosoever sinneth have not seen him
[55:16] neither known him you've not been
[55:19] connected you've not been born again hmm
[55:22] he said little children let no man

[56:20] this is righteous even as he is
[56:24] righteous he that committeth sin is of
[56:27] the devil for the devil sinneth from the
[56:31] beginning and then his son Cain did the
[56:34] same thing and it ain't stopped the
[56:38] nature the wiring hmm

[56:44] reboot that's a repelling of the Holy
[56:48] Spirit we need a we need a new hard
[56:51] drive because we had the wrong hope we
[56:53] started out with the wrong hard drive
[56:55] the wrong nature
[56:59] he said he that committeth sin is of the
[57:02] devil for the devil sinneth from the
[57:03] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[57:05] God was manifested that he might destroy
[57:08] the works of the devil whomsoever is
[57:10] born of God does not commit sin that me

[1:03:16] look at these things and he tells us
[1:03:17] over let's turn back to st. John chapter
[1:03:20] 2 first John chapter let me say let's
[1:03:23] look at this right here let's see what
[1:03:24] calls the problem here let's started
[1:03:29] let's look at verse 15 you read 15 down
[1:03:33] through 4 17 here's John speaking to us
[1:03:36] again he said love not the world neither
[1:03:39] the things that are in the world
[1:03:41] If any man love the world the love of
[1:03:44] the father's not in it you said well I
[1:03:46] still love such as this I don't know no
[1:03:51] war near I still got things down but
[1:03:53] Louise still playing he's dying I'm
[1:03:55] dying daily
[1:03:56] but I don't love it like I used to know
[1:03:59] what it was easy for me to quit loving
[1:04:00] the world if it ain't easy for you quit
[1:04:03] loving the world my goodness you got a
[1:04:05] huge birth it was easy I meant I look
[1:04:09] murder killing you can't love this this
[1:04:12] place does not not mine your home
[1:04:14] he said we're big rooms of strangers
[1:04:17] seeking for a city whose builder makers
[1:04:18] God we're not this is not my house I may
[1:04:22] have a nice place to live we might have
[1:04:23] a nice car drop his name my home I'm
[1:04:25] just traveling through we would get that
[1:04:28] kind of answer you don't we're traveling
[1:04:29] through and we want to bring others with
[1:04:31] us he's been he said love not the world
[1:04:35] neither love to the things of the world
[1:04:38] it sees you for paper quit loving the
[1:04:39] world but the things of the world buzzed
[1:04:41] on him
[1:04:41] that's why we have problems so I quit
[1:04:44] nothing but the things of the world
[1:04:46] things of the world what's that things
[1:04:48] that keep you from fellowship and God is
[1:04:51] to eat it Paul said it's not two great
[1:04:53] big things it's the little bitty things
[1:04:56] it's the little things but chance we
[1:04:58] leave undone it's the small foxes pause
[1:05:02] and survive it's that little bug that
[1:05:05] little parasite that bites on it mmm
[1:05:08] he said lot the world listen what he
[1:05:10] tells you these three attacks that he
[1:05:12] did on her list of this he said let me
[1:05:16] sit before all that is in the world the
[1:05:20] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:05:22] and the pride of life it is not of the
[1:05:25] Father but of the world he said in the
[1:05:28] world passes away and the lust thereof
[1:05:30] but he did abide that he that doeth the
[1:05:33] will of God abideth for ever
[1:05:36] what's the will of God his word let's
[1:05:38] look at what he did right here look at
[1:05:40] this see she fell right forward he don't
[1:05:42] Satan don't ever change they've got the
[1:05:44] same old tack what you gotta do study
[1:05:46] him you've got a steady meat on that
[1:05:49] he's not in you he don't brain your
[1:05:51] brain in a different way but it's the
[1:05:53] same old tactics same old desire to do
[1:05:56] what he did look at this let's look in
[1:05:58] back in Genesis right here listen to
[1:06:02] this verse 6 when you know that talk
[1:06:05] about man woman flesh like this he says
[1:06:11] that when the woman saw that the tree
[1:06:14] was good it was good for food
[1:06:19] it was the lust of the flesh she failed
[1:06:23] listen ideas and then it said and that
[1:06:29] it was pleasant to the eyes my point God
[1:06:36] beautiful ain't that beautiful
[1:06:37] mmm lust of the eyes and look at that
[1:06:41] the pride of life and to make one wise
[1:06:46] ever learning never come in man's been
[1:06:49] learned ever since knee ain't never come
[1:06:50] to God if it had been they've got him
[1:06:53] don't come to him he don't ever come to
[1:06:54] go what did this an Asian
[1:06:58] do this age was said under miserable
[1:07:02] wretched blind and naked and North it
[1:07:05] not so we have needed nothing we're rich
[1:07:07] and increasing goods you don't have
[1:07:10] Jesus if a man gain the whole world
[1:07:11] loses so what's the game nothing
[1:07:15] listen to such terrible to the Luke
[1:07:17] let's look at let's look at the one that
[1:07:19] can wire us right back
[1:07:21] he went they hey he said he was tempting
[1:07:23] all like manner still attempted no like
[1:07:25] man I won't hold you too much long let's
[1:07:27] just look at these things just sometimes
[1:07:29] to pinch our conscience and you go back
[1:07:30] and look at him instead him and Luke
[1:07:33] chapter 4 verse 1 they said well I'm
[1:07:38] gonna cross him if I cross to everybody
[1:07:40] else up Saints I'm gonna cross him up
[1:07:42] I've made every one of them fall by one
[1:07:45] of these three tactics and they did it
[1:07:47] brother Han they did it and Jesus being
[1:07:50] full of the Holy Ghost he'd never got it
[1:07:53] connected to that he was in for a treat
[1:07:55] brother Louie's full full of the Holy
[1:07:59] Ghost we returned from Jordan and was
[1:08:02] led by the spirit in the wilderness you
[1:08:04] would think well God wouldn't lead him
[1:08:05] to that why would God do that he was
[1:08:07] gonna prove something then it's not by
[1:08:09] might not by power but by my spirit
[1:08:12] sister long he said being forty days
[1:08:16] tempted of the devil when the amp like
[1:08:18] we said this morning
[1:08:19] Satan kind a the tenth of all tempters
[1:08:23] he come there bass had failed to him
[1:08:27] everybody main state look like judgments
[1:08:28] won't be so perfect but he lied he said
[1:08:30] don't tell him Scheepers to me herd
[1:08:33] cattle
[1:08:33] what's the palm nation to the chip chest
[1:08:36] and judges looked smallest and he looked
[1:08:38] that was all but that one thing but
[1:08:40] disconnected one thing disconnection
[1:08:45] hallelujah it says being forty days
[1:08:49] tempted to their can imagine that forty
[1:08:51] days we can't longer came last thirty
[1:08:53] minutes
[1:08:54] Oh preacher they can help me he'll show
[1:09:02] you how it's not by my not my party's
[1:09:05] gonna show you what to do you can say
[1:09:06] don't even waste us don't even waste of
[1:09:08] power on this coward
[1:09:10] hmm he says in those days she did eat
[1:09:13] nothing and when they were ended he
[1:09:16] afterward hungered but brent said when a
[1:09:19] man's hungry he'll kill you get food
[1:09:21] he'll do anything to feel that section
[1:09:23] of the flesh look at right here he comes
[1:09:24] to attack him with the lust of the flesh
[1:09:27] he's waiting I got him he's hungry oh
[1:09:30] yeah just worked on all of them they got
[1:09:33] hungry wasn't this it said and the devil
[1:09:38] said unto him if thou be the Son of God
[1:09:41] command this stone that it be made bread
[1:09:45] he could have couldn't make the whole
[1:09:47] mountain of bread if he wanted to he
[1:09:49] could turn Satan into a dough ball if he
[1:09:51] wanted to
[1:09:52] gobble him up I mean I wouldn't want to
[1:09:54] eat him but the foul was a BT few buzzes
[1:09:57] were the probably feasted on him you
[1:09:59] know it says in jesus answered him
[1:10:02] saying it is written that man shall not
[1:10:05] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:10:07] God he defeated him when he tried to
[1:10:10] attack him with the lust of the flesh he
[1:10:12] to feed him with the word Rosalie's he
[1:10:15] said all right mother said you'll see
[1:10:16] where a man's that getting the word test
[1:10:18] is that pretty good quotes a second of
[1:10:20] giving us a quick quote to us brother oh
[1:10:26] Jesus pretty good didn't work cuz I Know
[1:10:30] Who I am
[1:10:31] see that's the problem a lot of us don't
[1:10:32] realize who we are then what Satan gives
[1:10:34] us a quote like it Oh

[1:10:40] bread alone ever words to proceed on the
[1:10:42] month ago they didn't stop don't think

[1:10:45] time he's coming he's coming what the
[1:10:48] lust of the eyes look at this
[1:10:50] and the devil taking him up into a high
[1:10:52] mountain showed him unto him all the
[1:10:56] kingdoms of the world in the moment of a
[1:10:58] time while he was running that film when

[1:20:23] us right he sent the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:25] dissolve that negative wire that we have
[1:20:28] all the time always negative that's what
[1:20:32] was wrong with his apostles it was
[1:20:34] negative that was negative they couldn't
[1:20:37] get along this is the process of what
[1:20:39] would Jesus but they didn't have the
[1:20:41] Holy Ghost so show us Lord who in here
[1:20:45] comes James and John's my lord which
[1:20:48] one's gonna be the greatest left who is
[1:20:49] one which one that one Centon wants that
[1:20:51] long the other here's the Apostles that
[1:20:55] we looked up to and all that with how to
[1:20:57] converge you look at the powerful and
[1:21:00] this is Lord and they wouldn't receive
[1:21:01] us shall we go find out I said you ain't
[1:21:04] know what spiritual what's wrong with
[1:21:06] you profess it as long as there's breath
[1:21:08] in the man's body there's a potential so
[1:21:11] we're really disagreed and put them on
[1:21:13] hapless tears I'm cool
[1:21:14] hey we got hey hey God have mercy on me
[1:21:17] I'm gravy and say hey you dropped it
[1:21:19] this time razor this over with you get
[1:21:22] your stinking higher and he could have
[1:21:24] he could he could do us anyway we hate
[1:21:27] we can't do without him he can put me in
[1:21:30] your way anytime he wants to him be just
[1:21:33] but he's patient with us
[1:21:35] he's long-suffering he's kind and then
[1:21:39] look when the spirit did fall on the
[1:21:41] pastas and it fell upon a man called
[1:21:44] Stephen he was connected he was hooked
[1:21:48] up he never backed down he never
[1:21:51] compromised he pressed the truth and it
[1:21:53] cost him his life he said gee stiff neck
[1:21:56] and circumcised are hard in the ears
[1:21:58] he always resist the Holy Ohr they loved
[1:22:00] it when he's talking about Abraham but

[1:28:33] won't answer it but I answered by God's
[1:28:35] grace he'll give me the by the Bible

[1:28:39] Branson they wouldn't live what that was
[1:28:40] but you know what if they're really
[1:28:42] believers they should believe the Bible
[1:28:43] we were pleased we believed them I was
[1:28:45] lonely so take the Bible
[1:28:48] take the balanced short-term that's what
[1:28:50] brother showed us the port was in the
[1:28:51] Bible so I said okay I'll do the best I
[1:28:56] can God give me grace
[1:28:57] and so God took me in I said where you
[1:28:59] know live Capri sitting there was a
[1:29:01] woman she said what about Deborah said
[1:29:03] she's a judge and said transcript boy

[1:29:14] preach to go tell my disciples I said
[1:29:17] before and the Lord was just open these
[1:29:19] things as soon as this young minute
[1:29:21] scriptures just flowing he said how did
[1:29:23] your belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:29:24] water
[1:29:25] they've just description I wouldn't he
[1:29:26] it is like I turned the Bible blood on
[1:29:28] it fall right on the scripture that's
[1:29:30] like you know yeah I know it's not me
[1:29:32] but we can't do that when God wants to
[1:29:35] talk he talks and where he speaks it's
[1:29:37] through his word and so I told her I
[1:29:39] said well you know Paul said oak learn
[1:29:42] tempted when I won't teach to have
[1:29:44] thought of them happy silent Church I
[1:29:45] can hear a growling on the end she said

[1:29:54] well that Curt him once she said that
[1:29:56] you know next thing she told me you're a
[1:29:57] male chauvinist pig she told me I was a
[1:30:00] pig oh I said that dress I'd rather be a

[1:30:27] love brother Brett said as we stand
