[0:00] just kind of meditate on these as we
[0:01] prepare for the service
[0:04] in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 says for
[0:06] the law having a shadow of good things
[0:08] to come
[0:09] and not the very image of the things can
[0:11] never with those sacrifices which they
[0:13] offered year by year continually make
[0:15] the comers there and to perfect
[0:17] and uh like we've kind of been talking
[0:19] about thank God that we've got not just
[0:21] a shadow we've got the thing that was
[0:22] promised today we've got access to
[0:26] to the promises of the Holy Ghost and
[0:29] the everything that was part of the
[0:30] atonement that Christ died that was
[0:32] foreshadowed in the Old Testament
[0:34] but then would they not have ceased to
[0:36] be offered because that the worshipers
[0:37] once purged should have had no more
[0:39] conscience of sins I want you to maybe
[0:42] pay close attention to the way Paul
[0:43] words this that he's talking about being
[0:45] purged and your conscience that your
[0:49] soul is purged of your of of of the
[0:52] desire to do wrong
[0:55] by the new birth
[0:57] but in those sacrifices there is a
[0:59] remembrance again made of sin every year
[1:01] for it is not possible that the blood of
[1:03] bulls and a goat should take away sins
[1:05] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:07] he saith sacrifice and offering that
[1:09] what is not but a body has thou prepared
[1:11] me and burnt offerings and sacrifices
[1:14] for seeing thou Hast had no pleasure
[1:16] then said I love I come in the volume of
[1:18] the book that is written of me to do thy
[1:20] will o God
[1:22] so in verse two if we kind of back up
[1:24] and go through this it says for then
[1:25] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:28] because that the worshipers once purged
[1:30] should have had no more conscious of
[1:31] sins
[1:32] so if if the sacrifice is in the Old
[1:35] Testament were sufficient enough then
[1:37] then they would have been ceased to be
[1:38] offered but because the the goal here is
[1:42] for your conscience to be purged
[1:44] but in those sacrifices there were there
[1:47] is a remembrance again made of sins
[1:49] every year now you think about what
[1:51] purge mean purge means to take out all
[1:54] the impurities to take out all of the
[1:56] things that are wrong to think out the
[1:58] wrong thoughts to take out the wrong
[2:00] well really what we're talking about is
[2:02] to take out the wrong desire
[2:04] as we'll see here in a second when you
[2:06] what what the new birth does through the
[2:08] promise of the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:09] is that takes out the desire to do wrong
[2:12] we're used to you you didn't you didn't
[2:14] mind so much uh drinking alcohol or
[2:16] doing all you know do or you didn't mind
[2:19] the wrong Doctrine you didn't mind uh
[2:21] the the things that you were doing
[2:22] living in sin but but when the Holy
[2:25] Ghost comes when Christ is revealed to
[2:26] you then it purges you it takes out all
[2:29] the impurities so your desire has
[2:32] changed now I've got a little example
[2:34] there a little picture of the um a metal
[2:37] being purged and what you know we I
[2:39] can't if you know the process you you
[2:42] once you get metal hot enough then the
[2:45] impurities will rise to the top and you
[2:47] can take a little label there and just
[2:48] start skimming it off so it's the fire
[2:50] of the Holy Ghost that cleanses all the
[2:52] impure it takes all the impurities out
[2:54] it just it bakes it out of us
[2:57] Psalm chapter 51 says behold I was
[2:59] shaping in iniquity and in sin did my
[3:02] mother conceive me behold thou desires
[3:04] truth in the inward parts and in the
[3:06] hidden part Thou shalt make me to know
[3:08] wisdom Purge me with hissel and I shall
[3:12] be clean wash me and I shall be wider
[3:14] than snow now brother around in one
[3:16] place said hyssop represents the cross
[3:17] and another place that represents the
[3:20] Simplicity of your faith it just says
[3:22] that this hiccup is just some common
[3:24] weed that you can grab off the side of
[3:26] the road you can find anywhere and
[3:28] that's how common it is so if you have
[3:29] just simple faith in Christ and the
[3:33] Cross of Christ what he did then that's
[3:35] sufficient enough to allow him to come
[3:37] in and do a work of purging you purging
[3:40] your inward parts and begin to take out
[3:41] all the impurities
[3:44] and the message job he said brother Adam
[3:47] said putting your hand one time upon the
[3:49] head of him and confessing your sins and
[3:51] feeling the things of Calvary when he
[3:53] died of sinners in your stead you'll
[3:55] have no more conscience of sins after
[3:58] that no more conscience of sins
[4:00] well that's a that's a big thing to say
[4:02] no more conscious of sins the worshiper
[4:05] once purged by the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:07] has no more desire to sin don't say you
[4:11] won't sin don't say you won't make a
[4:14] mistake you won't slip up and fall and
[4:16] get you know maybe trip up and fall on
[4:18] your face but you're going to get back
[4:19] up again why but you're going to go
[4:21] repent you're maybe maybe going to cry
[4:24] at the altar a little bit because you
[4:25] have no desire to do it God takes the
[4:28] desire out of you no more desire to sin
[4:32] all goes throughout through the washing
[4:34] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:36] cleanses us from all unrighteousness so
[4:39] that's what Paul is talking about when
[4:41] he says that worshiper once purged
[4:43] should have had no more conscience of
[4:44] sins if if the Old Testament sacrifice
[4:48] was sufficient but what we needed was a
[4:49] we needed a new testament sacrifice the
[4:52] sacrifice of Christ's blood his life to
[4:54] die for us on the cross so that his life
[4:56] could come back and live in us and those
[4:59] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[5:01] made of sins every year
[5:02] so what what's what's the the gift of
[5:05] the Holy Ghost is to create you a clean
[5:06] heart to clean you out to make change
[5:09] your desires to change your nature so
[5:11] that you're a different to change you so
[5:12] that you want to come to church to
[5:14] change you so that you want your
[5:16] appetize changed you want to serve God
[5:19] now in those sacrifices there is a
[5:22] remembrance again made of sins every
[5:23] year now remember it says you know every
[5:25] every year they come together all the
[5:27] all the Israelites and they'd come
[5:28] together and the high priest would offer
[5:30] on the day of atonement and so forth all
[5:32] the sacrifices and it would remind them
[5:33] you're still a sinner every year they'd
[5:36] come back together and it was a
[5:37] continual reminder that you something's
[5:40] wrong in your heart you you you keep
[5:43] after coming to come back and you see
[5:45] God don't want you to have to keep
[5:46] coming back to the place over you know
[5:48] where you keep going to youth meetings
[5:50] and keep going to special meetings and
[5:52] over and over again but the sacrifice
[5:54] that cried the Christ made on the cross
[5:56] was once for all to to change your heart
[5:59] and change your nature once for all now
[6:04] he said and the message mother Mother's
[6:06] Day he said as the people used to go up
[6:08] to Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and
[6:10] for the cleansing of the Tabernacle and
[6:12] the sanctuary and the offering of the
[6:14] sin offering each year they was reminded
[6:16] when that lamb died out there that there
[6:18] had come a time that the Lamb of God
[6:20] would die to divorce sin
[6:22] each time that little fellow bleeded and
[6:25] the blood sprinkled over their hands
[6:27] they was reminded that there'd be a time
[6:28] when there would be the Lamb of God that
[6:31] would cry Eli Lama Eli Llama at the
[6:34] cross
[6:35] foreign
[6:37] Gilead he said the spirit of that lamb
[6:40] could not come back into the believer
[6:42] therefore there was a remembrance of sin
[6:44] continually
[6:45] but when a man goes up puts his hands by
[6:48] faith upon the head of Jesus Christ and
[6:51] feels the Pains of sins that he died for
[6:53] him at Calvary and the tearing and the
[6:56] gobs of spit upon his face and the
[6:58] Thorns over his brow and can see what
[7:01] Jesus Christ did for him and accepted
[7:03] upon those bases the spirit of God comes
[7:06] back into the Believers it kills the
[7:09] very nature of sin in him it makes him a
[7:12] new creature he cannot go on like he was
[7:15] because he is a new creature Now isn't
[7:18] that a beautiful story that they're on
[7:20] the cross Christ died for us so that he
[7:22] could arise so that you could die you
[7:25] could die to the to your old nature you
[7:27] could die to the way that you used to
[7:29] think your old desires and be
[7:31] resurrected inwardly to a new life in
[7:33] Christ and that's what the gospel is
[7:35] that you you think different you you
[7:37] walk different you have a different your
[7:40] Nature has been changed
[7:42] I I just I I just feel sometimes
[7:45] inspired just keep stressing that but
[7:46] this the gospel is more than just
[7:48] learning about things but it's a changed
[7:50] life it's God Christ revealed to you to
[7:53] to make you different to make you
[7:54] something different I want to change I
[7:57] want to be like Jesus from where you can
[7:59] okay maybe maybe this morning I think
[8:01] back to how you used to be and what uh
[8:03] because I don't think anybody of any of
[8:06] us or where we want to be but there's
[8:08] some there's been a change in our life
[8:10] if you're born again this morning you
[8:12] you look back and you can see where you
[8:14] used to be
[8:15] um like this picture I've got here your
[8:17] life used to be all torn apart and dark
[8:19] clouds and a tree that didn't bear any
[8:22] fruit but then when Christ revealed
[8:24] himself to you it changed everything
[8:26] that's right
[8:28] and so in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 it
[8:31] says wherefore when he cometh into the
[8:32] world he saith sacrifice an offering
[8:34] thou what is not but a body has thou
[8:37] prepared me so now now all those Old
[8:41] Testament sacrifices and things he
[8:44] we today in the New Testament God
[8:46] doesn't want you to go grab a lamb and
[8:48] and take it up and sacrifice it he he
[8:50] made a he prepared a body to be the
[8:53] sacrifice he made a he made he prepared
[8:56] a body that he could come and live in
[8:58] and Tabernacle himself in that would be
[9:00] sufficient for all the sacrifices more
[9:03] sufficient than all the sacrifices that
[9:05] they did in the Old Testament
[9:06] more sufficient than anything that you
[9:09] could do more sufficient than than any
[9:11] of your works so he don't want you to uh
[9:14] he didn't want you to go grab a lamb and
[9:16] do anything like that but he prepared a
[9:17] body so that he could he could come and
[9:19] die now let's look at this that in Psalm
[9:22] chapter 40 verse 6 it says sacrifice and
[9:24] offering that is not desire mine ears
[9:27] has thou opened burnt offering and sin
[9:30] offering hast thou not required
[9:32] now
[9:34] if you've got to examine that in the
[9:36] original Hebrew mind ears hast thou open
[9:38] that scripture in Psalms it's it's kind
[9:41] of a a
[9:42] um a Hebrew saying that means digging
[9:45] ears in other words God has taken like
[9:47] like clay and dug your ears out so that
[9:50] you could hear the word Doug taking a
[9:54] clay body taking your ears and kind of
[9:55] moved moved them with Clay like this
[9:58] picture I've got of somebody of God in
[10:00] other words like God forming the body
[10:03] such that you have the privilege of
[10:05] hearing from God
[10:07] in first Samuel 15 it says and Samuel
[10:09] said hath the Lord has great delight and
[10:11] burn offerings and sacrifices as an
[10:13] obeying the voice of the Lord
[10:15] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[10:18] and to hearken than the fat of rams so
[10:21] what what does God want you to do this
[10:23] morning make make do a lot of things he
[10:26] just wants you to listen he just wants
[10:28] you you're not saved by all the works
[10:30] that you do although faith will produce
[10:32] Works faith will produce a Life of
[10:34] Christ in you but he don't want you to
[10:36] do anything to be saved just listen I
[10:39] think one of the most profound
[10:40] scriptures in the Bible is that if
[10:42] you'll just come as a little child like
[10:44] Jesus said in Mark chapter 10 that
[10:46] suffer the little children that come
[10:48] unto me and forbid them not for such as
[10:50] the kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[10:52] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[10:53] of God as a little child he shall not
[10:55] enter therein so if you can just listen
[10:57] to the gospel like a little child and
[10:59] receive it in your heart
[11:01] then these promises will be made
[11:03] manifest to you amen wherefore when he
[11:06] cometh into the world he saith sacrifice
[11:08] and offering that would us not but a
[11:10] body has thou prepared me so if we look
[11:13] at the New Living Translation version it
[11:14] says that is why when Christ came into
[11:17] the world
[11:18] he said to God you do not want animal
[11:20] sacrifices or sin offerings but you have
[11:23] given me a body to offer amen you've
[11:25] given me a body to offer and that's
[11:27] Christ's body yeah what a wonderful
[11:30] pattern that they in the Old Testament
[11:32] they built they built their Tabernacle
[11:35] after according to the pattern that
[11:36] Moses saw on the mount and um
[11:39] at you know the anointing men were God
[11:42] anointed to prepare it and and so that
[11:45] it would it would just match exactly
[11:46] that pattern all the all the ornaments
[11:49] and all the tapestries and everything
[11:50] that went into that so that God could
[11:52] come down and dwell in that Tabernacle
[11:55] but what is what his objective was to
[11:57] actually come down and robe himself in
[11:59] flesh so that's the body that Paul is
[12:02] speaking of here
[12:03] and then and the message Oneness he said
[12:07] didn't have to borrow any Timbers
[12:09] anywhere Hebrews the 11th chapter I
[12:11] believe in the second or third verse
[12:12] says that the world was framed by the
[12:14] word of God the things were made out of
[12:17] things that don't appear God just said
[12:19] let there be and there was he didn't
[12:20] have to go over and say Mr Moon would
[12:22] you loan me a little Timber Mr Starr
[12:24] would you let me have some calcium God
[12:26] don't do that he didn't have to say Mary
[12:28] you loan me an egg I want to make a body
[12:30] so I can dwell in God the Creator spoke
[12:33] and she was a mother right then
[12:36] she wasn't a mother she was just a woman
[12:38] bearing his seed that's right I remember
[12:40] she was not Jesus's mother the world
[12:43] said word said so find me one place in
[12:45] scripture ever he called her mother now
[12:48] come back to the word mother of God
[12:49] shame on you see that that body that God
[12:52] prepared was a spoken word body that God
[12:54] spoke and there it was and Zacchaeus the
[12:57] businessman he said then when Emmanuel's
[13:00] vein was broke Jesus was neither Jew nor
[13:02] Gentile
[13:04] the male sex puts out the germ through
[13:06] the hemoglobin and the blood cells from
[13:07] the male the female and you Catholic
[13:10] people not disagree with you but call
[13:11] and Mary Mother of God and how could God
[13:13] have a mother
[13:15] she was an incubator you say well the
[13:17] egg come from the woman but the egg
[13:19] didn't come from Mary if the egg come
[13:21] from Mary then there had to be a
[13:23] sensation look where you put God God
[13:24] created both egg and blood cell he was
[13:27] neither Jew nor Gentile he was God
[13:29] nothing less he was God manifested in
[13:32] flesh
[13:34] did not he say we read in the scriptures
[13:36] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[13:38] world to himself he was Emmanuel
[13:41] so that that little flesh body if you
[13:43] think about that that that uh that we've
[13:45] got a I got a little scripture of the
[13:47] body growing in the womb but that the
[13:50] very beginning of that body was formed
[13:51] by because God spoken into existence he
[13:54] made it and of course now from then from
[13:57] that point on it began to absorb
[13:58] nutrients from the mother and the mama
[14:00] eating some some scrambled eggs for
[14:02] breakfast breakfast or whatever and
[14:04] sales were building one on top of the
[14:05] other but that starting point of that
[14:07] that initial uh uh God God spoke that it
[14:10] didn't come no part of that came from
[14:12] Mary
[14:12] and certainly no part of it came from
[14:14] Joseph
[14:16] Luke chapter 22 we're familiar with this
[14:19] where Jesus was sitting there a little
[14:20] boy teaching in the temple and and he
[14:23] said um and his mama his mama went and
[14:26] it makes you wonder how could they lose
[14:28] it we think about sometimes well our
[14:31] parenting mistakes how could they lose
[14:32] him for
[14:33] several days in that Caravan going back
[14:36] to to where they came from and they
[14:39] found him in the temple teaching and he
[14:41] said and when they saw him they were
[14:43] amazed and his mother said unto him son
[14:45] wise thou thus dealt with us Behold thy
[14:48] father and I have sought thee Sorrowing
[14:50] and he said unto them how is how is it
[14:52] that you sought me wished you not that I
[14:54] must be about my father's business so he
[14:55] was correcting her there I didn't I
[14:57] didn't come from you I came from my
[14:58] father and I'm doing what my fault I'm
[15:00] not I'm not building houses and doing
[15:02] carpentry work but I'm doing what my
[15:04] Father in Heaven would want me to do
[15:06] because he's about his his his business
[15:10] in First Peter chapter 2 it says who his
[15:12] own self bear our sins and his own body
[15:14] on the truth on the tree that we being
[15:18] dead to sins should live unto
[15:20] righteousness
[15:21] by whose Stripes ye were healed
[15:24] and beholding a greater than Solomon is
[15:27] here brother Adam said God is not an
[15:28] idol
[15:29] God is a spirit and we prostrate
[15:32] ourselves before that and the spirit
[15:34] don't come into some Idol of some
[15:36] so-called Christians would have us to
[15:37] believe but the spirit comes into you
[15:40] and you are God's house living walking
[15:43] around manifesting the Living God
[15:46] for God dwells not in temples made with
[15:48] hands but a body has thou prepared me
[15:51] you are God's letter
[15:53] a written epistle God is in you
[15:55] manifesting himself through if you could
[15:58] prostrate yourself before God and say
[16:00] God I'm a sinner God could come into me
[16:02] and then the Holy Spirit comes in and
[16:04] then you're a living Idol of God living
[16:06] representative of God walking around
[16:09] with God speaking through your lips to
[16:12] others
[16:13] and now I think after you're reading
[16:15] that quote maybe we can read what Paul's
[16:17] saying here a little bit differently
[16:18] sacrifice and offering now what it's not
[16:20] but a body I thou prepared me and burnt
[16:22] offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
[16:24] has had no pleasure the inside out of
[16:26] low I come in the volume of the book it
[16:28] is written of me to do thy will o God so
[16:31] then we can see that there's things that
[16:33] are written about Jesus also applies to
[16:35] us
[16:36] the the things that were written about
[16:37] him that a body is thou prepared for me
[16:39] that he wanted to dwell in that body but
[16:41] he wants to dwell in your body and he
[16:44] wanted he wrote that he wrote about
[16:46] Jesus in the book in his book that that
[16:49] he would do his will and also he wrote
[16:51] about you in his book that he you would
[16:53] do his will so the things that are
[16:55] written about Christ are also written
[16:58] about you that the same works that
[17:00] Christ would do the same those same
[17:01] works though the Greater Works that you
[17:03] would do
[17:04] that then maybe we can read this the
[17:06] scripture in a different way a body has
[17:08] thou prepared me and the statue of a
[17:10] perfect man brother around him said now
[17:12] Tabernacle is of course a place where we
[17:14] go to rest now get freshness and so
[17:16] forth we're like resting from sleep or
[17:18] so forth now Hebrews 10 and the fifth
[17:21] verse Paul brings it in wherefore when
[17:23] he cometh into the world he said
[17:25] sacrifice that's Christ sacrifice and
[17:28] offering thou what is not but a body has
[17:30] thou prepared me what is the Tabernacle
[17:32] now a body God tabernacling in a body
[17:36] God wants up high when he come down on
[17:39] the mountain even if a bullock or a cow
[17:40] touched the mountain he must be killed
[17:42] God is Holy last evening
[17:45] last evening when those angels cover
[17:47] their faces holy seraphims with holy
[17:50] faces don't even know what sin means and
[17:52] they have to cover their face in the
[17:53] presence of God cover their feet in
[17:55] humility now holy God could not condone
[17:58] sin so nothing could touch the mountain
[18:00] where God was then God was made flesh
[18:03] and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus
[18:05] Christ his son his creation then that
[18:07] son gave his life and the blood cell of
[18:10] God was broken that the life might come
[18:12] out of the blood to us through that
[18:14] blood we are cleansed and now our blood
[18:16] our life which came by living through
[18:20] sexual desire brought our life in the
[18:22] world
[18:23] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[18:26] changes our Nature by sinning upon us
[18:29] the Holy Spirit then we become into the
[18:32] divine nature of God then we became a
[18:35] dwelling place for God Jesus said at
[18:38] that day you'll know that I am in the
[18:40] father and the father and me I and you
[18:43] and you and me what does that scripture
[18:45] mean that God is in flesh that God's
[18:48] dwelling and manifesting himself in
[18:50] flesh
[18:51] I see see how the scripture has layers
[18:53] and we read but a body has thou prepared
[18:55] me applying to Christ but a body has
[18:57] thou prepared me applying to you as well
[18:59] that God would change your nature to
[19:02] what to what to be like his nature that
[19:04] his virtues and his his knowledge and
[19:07] his patience and all of these all the
[19:09] attributes of Christ will be made real
[19:11] in your life and your nature would be
[19:14] changed so that you don't act like a
[19:16] sinner anymore but you act like Jesus
[19:18] Christ
[19:19] and not act in the sense of an actor but
[19:22] his nature is represented in you
[19:25] and the message expectation he said and
[19:27] now father when he was here on Earth you
[19:30] sent him you told him that he was to do
[19:31] your will I come in the volume of the
[19:34] book to do thy will o God and now he
[19:37] returned back to you after making the
[19:39] sacrifice that of his own self that he
[19:41] could bring many sons unto God and now
[19:43] tonight Lord I as your servant along
[19:46] with these other servants are here to do
[19:48] thy will o God as it is written by him
[19:52] which said the things I do shall you
[19:55] also oh can't you see how the things
[19:58] that are written of Christ are written
[19:59] of you also that Christ was sent to do
[20:01] his the father's will and you are sent
[20:03] to do the father's will but how will you
[20:05] know what the father's will is unless
[20:07] you read his will which is written down
[20:09] in the pages of the Bible
[20:11] you know unless you read the will you
[20:13] don't know you didn't even know how to
[20:15] act before you read the will you didn't
[20:16] know how to dress you didn't know what
[20:18] you were supposed to do you didn't know
[20:20] that you're supposed to assemble
[20:21] yourselves together uh you didn't you
[20:23] don't know you don't know what you're
[20:25] you don't know what you have access to
[20:26] without the will but when you read the
[20:28] will then you begin to realize that
[20:30] you've got promises you've got benefits
[20:32] you've got a benefit package you have
[20:34] you have a healing plan you have access
[20:37] to Salvation you've got promises for
[20:39] your children and all of those things
[20:41] are written in the will so so how do you
[20:43] know what the will of God is the only
[20:45] way to know the will of God is his word
[20:48] to know his word so if you don't know
[20:50] his word then then you won't know his
[20:52] will sometimes we get we get kind of
[20:54] caught up in saying well we I I know
[20:56] what the will of God is because we saw a
[20:58] dream or something like that but if it
[20:59] doesn't match up with the will with the
[21:01] word of God
[21:02] you cannot you don't have anything to
[21:04] base your faith on faith is Faith's
[21:06] final resting place is the word of God
[21:09] so in Matthew Chapter 5 Jesus said let
[21:12] your light so shine before men that they
[21:14] may see your good works and for glorify
[21:15] your father which is in heaven think not
[21:17] that I am come to destroy the law or the
[21:19] prophets I've not come to destroy but to
[21:21] fulfill isn't that what we think
[21:23] sometimes that God came to do away with
[21:24] the Old Testament no he didn't come to
[21:26] do away with it but to take those Old
[21:28] Testament tablets and put them in your
[21:31] heart so that the essence of the law was
[21:33] fulfilled in your members so that your
[21:35] love you love your neighbor you love the
[21:37] Lord thy God with all your heart and all
[21:38] your soul you love your neighbor as
[21:40] yourself
[21:41] and all of those Commandments that are
[21:43] written down that they're actually
[21:44] essence of those things are fulfilled in
[21:46] you
[21:47] prevailing I say unto you till Heaven
[21:49] and Earth past one jot and one Tittle
[21:51] shall in no wise pass from the law
[21:53] to all be fulfilled everything that was
[21:56] written down in the scripture has to be
[21:58] fulfilled in other words in the season
[22:00] that it was meant to be manifested it's
[22:02] going to be manifested and the season
[22:04] that it was meant to be manifested
[22:06] Christ came and walked on the earth and
[22:08] now in the season that that layout of
[22:10] somebody's going to believe in this
[22:11] layout of seeing Church age here you are
[22:13] to manifest the word for your age to
[22:16] fulfill the things that were written of
[22:17] you in the scripture
[22:20] and Hebrews chapter 10 if we keep
[22:22] reading verse 10 it says by the which
[22:24] will by that will we are Sanctified
[22:26] through the offering of the body of
[22:28] Jesus Christ once for all
[22:30] and every priest stands daily
[22:32] ministering and offering some oftentimes
[22:34] the same sacrifices which can never take
[22:37] away sins but this man after he had
[22:40] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[22:42] set down on the right hand of God
[22:45] from his forth expect until his enemies
[22:47] be made his footstool for by one
[22:50] offering he hath perfected forever then
[22:52] that are Sanctified whereof the Holy
[22:54] Ghost also was a witness to us for after
[22:56] that he had said before this is the
[22:59] Covenant that I will make with them
[23:00] after those days saith the Lord I will
[23:03] put my laws all those Old Testament laws
[23:06] that we think that we just do away with
[23:07] into their hearts and in their minds
[23:11] will I write them
[23:12] and their sins and iniquities will I
[23:15] remember no more so what's God doing
[23:17] again he's changing you changing you to
[23:21] think by the renewing of our mind like
[23:23] brother brother Wade's been preaching on
[23:24] and what what is your mind being renewed
[23:26] to to think to brother Brown there's a
[23:29] quote where he said the mind of God is
[23:31] his word so if your mind is being
[23:34] renewed it's being renewed to match up
[23:36] with his word which what he wrote now in
[23:38] the scripture
[23:39] he says I will put my laws into their
[23:42] minds and write them in their hearts so
[23:44] they're no more written just on tables
[23:45] of stone that you can look at but it
[23:47] comes off of the page into a living
[23:49] reality of you where he's using your
[23:50] hands and using your feet and thinking
[23:52] through your mind to think different to
[23:54] molding you into a place where you can
[23:55] believe that all things are possible to
[23:57] them that believe because you're not
[23:59] looking by your eyesight anymore but
[24:01] you're looking looking to the Unseen by
[24:04] eyes of faith and Eyes Of Love where you
[24:07] see things different because the word
[24:09] has transformed you
[24:10] brother Brown said in one in a million
[24:12] he said let me give you a shocking
[24:14] something see not all that saith unto me
[24:16] Lord Lord will enter in but the one that
[24:19] doeth the will of my father his will is
[24:22] his word
[24:24] we can be ever so religious have great
[24:26] times shouting jumping in these meetings
[24:28] which I don't I don't want to be
[24:30] critical but I have a duty to God and
[24:32] that duty is to be sincere and to say
[24:34] what he wants me to say
[24:37] see what he's saying you can get you can
[24:38] get real excited in church the evidence
[24:40] the evidence is never the manifestation
[24:42] the Manifest the evidence is faith faith
[24:46] is the evidence faith will produce
[24:48] manifestation but we don't look at the
[24:50] manifestation as the evidence you see
[24:52] Faith the faith of the revealed Christ
[24:55] in you down in your soul is the evidence
[24:58] the revelation of his word his will is
[25:02] his word so that's what we base
[25:04] everything on that we can see his word
[25:06] not that we jump as the musicians come
[25:08] not that we jump or shout or those
[25:10] things which are great we love
[25:12] manifestation but everything must go
[25:14] back to Faith in his word and I'll just
[25:17] stop right there God bless you
[25:19] foreign
[25:20] [Applause]
