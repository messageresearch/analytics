[0:00] something drift in a little
[0:01] bit
[0:04] but I want to ask everybody a question
[0:08] and I'll ask it again toward the end I
[0:10] want to ask you a
[0:12] question if brother
[0:15] brand if the opening of the seals if the
[0:18] opening of the seals was a
[0:22] revelation if the opening of the
[0:25] field s and it's open remember it's open
[0:32] why haven't we went around why is it
[0:33] still 50 years
[0:36] later
[0:39] everybody not exactly but yeah it opens
[0:45] individually I don't no wait a minute
[0:47] hold
[0:48] on this my question the dispensation of
[0:52] the book is now
[0:54] open we know what brother Ram said about
[0:59] the first SE you should have been read
[1:01] it already we're starting on the first
[1:02] seal next Sunday but I want to get this
[1:04] out of the way I going to start today
[1:06] but thought this morning I thought take
[1:08] this
[1:09] angle why I mean he told us the white
[1:12] horse rider was Antichrist
[1:14] right that cleared up a doctrinal issue
[1:17] that had been hidden for a thousand
[1:19] years since the Bible was written
[1:24] right right since the Bible's been
[1:28] written since they wrote the Book of
[1:32] Revelation man has read Revelation
[1:36] 61 proad it stabbed at
[1:39] it like we were talking about last night
[1:42] about adoption I believe when brother
[1:44] randam went out to to Arizona remember
[1:48] he did not get the revelation of the
[1:49] seals in Arizona a lot of people think
[1:52] he did they want to give you all these
[1:53] little trinkets of things that he no
[1:55] forget
[1:56] it he was told if you read the book he
[2:00] was told to go back to Jeffersonville
[2:01] because the angel told him everything
[2:04] that he would get doctrinal wise would
[2:06] come from Jeffersonville right right
[2:09] remember brother ra said any kind of
[2:10] Doctrine I feel I I can come here and
[2:12] teach this at the
[2:15] Tabernacle so the angel come to him at
[2:17] the tabernac I me not the Tabernacle but
[2:19] at Mrs Woods house there in the their
[2:22] study but what happened out on Sunset
[2:24] Mount or or out there in Arizona West
[2:27] State where he was at remember he was
[2:29] caught up
[2:30] in a constellation of a pyramid of
[2:34] angels right and what happened out there
[2:37] I believe was his adoption that's when
[2:39] God come down and told him that you're
[2:42] fixing to start your message go back to
[2:45] Jeffersonville and these seals are going
[2:47] to be revealed the whole thing that you
[2:49] probed at thought about uh I was
[2:52] thinking this morning you know even
[2:53] brother rham in the in the 50s and I
[2:55] know brother Dale's going to cover this
[2:58] excuse me but Jes Jesus's Ministry was
[3:00] in stages like he talk Wednesday night
[3:02] brother R's Ministry was in stages the
[3:04] angel told him there were going to be
[3:06] three
[3:08] stages take the People by the hand right
[3:12] tell the very thoughts and intents of
[3:13] the heart and what in other words let me
[3:16] put it in my in my word restoration of
[3:19] all
[3:20] things all right cu the first pull and
[3:22] the second pull was
[3:25] to the world he went to the world with
[3:29] this gift but now when he comes to that
[3:31] third one or the third stage of his
[3:33] ministry CU a lot of times he say my
[3:35] Ministry is going to change 1959 he says
[3:37] my CH Ministry is going to
[3:39] change it didn't change really till 1963
[3:42] but there was a platform being built the
[3:46] building was being built the Pyramid was
[3:48] being built so that brother randam could
[3:50] go to
[3:51] Arizona have the seven angels come down
[3:53] didn't tell him a
[3:55] thing you know everybody think well
[3:57] there's the doctrine in the message that
[3:58] thinks that all seven angels
[4:00] U Paul irenius Martin Luther Columba oh
[4:04] yeah and brother brandham was the
[4:06] seventh one and that's why brother Bram
[4:07] says that seventh angel was a striking
[4:10] Angel they say he saw himself I don't
[4:13] believe that I just don't believe that I
[4:16] just believe that brother brandham as a
[4:19] prophet sure he could see who those
[4:21] seven Messengers were I believe he could
[4:23] but those were seven angels but they
[4:25] didn't start as
[4:28] Angels bird
[4:31] birds doves
[4:34] Angels right stages Birds they fly right
[4:40] doves they fly but you come up to Angels
[4:43] so you come up to Angels they didn't
[4:45] tell him anything but they were caught
[4:47] up but I believe God told him
[4:50] something this is now your message go
[4:53] back to jonville and it'll be told to
[4:55] you so what happened then was is he
[4:58] preached those seven Messengers
[5:00] mes
[5:01] messages of the seals okay God in
[5:05] Simplicity was a excuse me was a
[5:08] foundation um Revelations 5 or the
[5:10] breach was the foundation right but when
[5:13] he preached those seals he said that it
[5:17] was one of the most Supernatural times
[5:19] of his life right and all the years of
[5:22] the Healing Ministry of Willam brandham
[5:24] millions of people healed hundreds of
[5:26] thousand seriously healed come off a cot
[5:29] thing several dead being raised uh he
[5:33] had already went through the squirrels
[5:35] being see to me that's where you coming
[5:38] up he he was coming up to that point to
[5:40] where you know healing by the hand
[5:43] grabbing the hand knowing the thoughts
[5:45] and intents of the heart and then to me
[5:47] number three is creation spoken word or
[5:50] the word the spoken word because that's
[5:53] what he was coming to right right just
[5:55] like Moses same thing I mean when I read
[5:58] and I do read that Moes Moes said God
[6:00] raise up a prophet like unto me we know
[6:02] that talking about Jesus Christ but
[6:04] guess who that was all also speaking of
[6:06] you
[6:07] [Music]
[6:09] know cuz remember Jesus's Ministry there
[6:11] was no there was no documentation of
[6:14] Jesus taking him by the hand see going
[6:16] through stages like that he
[6:19] preached his ministry was in stages in
[6:22] preaching he didn't start out I don't
[6:24] think by grabbing about no he was God
[6:25] Almighty he didn't have that limitation
[6:27] he didn't have that limitation
[6:30] on his ministry but he did have a
[6:33] limitation on the word that he brought
[6:34] because he brought it in stages the
[6:36] Bible said he grew in Grace and
[6:37] knowledge the Bible says he became
[6:40] perfected by the things that he suffered
[6:42] God had to take him upon that mountain
[6:44] uh brother R me said and said and this
[6:46] is something that I don't understand
[6:49] that might help me I don't understand
[6:52] how he can be God Almighty and human
[6:53] flesh walk up to a mountain and Moses
[6:56] and Elijah have to tell him about him
[6:57] coming back yeah that to me that's hard
[7:02] something you know Paul Peter said Paul
[7:05] says things hard to understand sometimes
[7:06] brother say thing hard to understand cuz
[7:08] you think if Jesus went up a mountain
[7:10] there's Moses and Elijah well he knew
[7:11] who they were the theophany and Jesus
[7:14] knew who that the Moses and Elijah was
[7:16] cuz he's the one that created them he's
[7:18] the one to put them on the earth start
[7:19] with right but brother Bown said Moses
[7:22] and Elijah come to tell Jesus about his
[7:25] second coming about his death Bill and
[7:26] resurrection and second second coming so
[7:29] there was some things that was withheld
[7:30] from
[7:31] Jesus that he needed at the time they
[7:33] needed
[7:36] it I'm like Brother D I don't think at 5
[7:39] years old he knew he was a messiah that
[7:40] was going to die no he would become
[7:44] neurotic that's right so God in stages
[7:47] brought it to himself the word cuz at 13
[7:51] remember he goes in and starts reading
[7:52] the scroll well he starts to identify
[7:54] himself then you look in Luke where
[7:56] Jesus comes on up further goes to the
[7:59] church opens the Scrolls and says this
[8:02] day this scripture fulfilled what he do
[8:04] he identified who he was standing there
[8:07] greatest anointing that ever struck the
[8:09] Earth brother r s outside of all the
[8:12] healings and all the things Jesus done
[8:14] the greatest thing that he done was
[8:16] walked in that Temple open scroll and
[8:17] identifi who he was that's what we were
[8:20] talking about last
[8:21] night the the thing we've got to get to
[8:25] and to me it's what the seals does it
[8:28] shows you and and it helps you to
[8:30] realize that you're perfect right that's
[8:33] right there's not one day that Jesus got
[8:36] up out of his bed from sleeping that he
[8:39] didn't know who he was when he come to
[8:42] that point when when when the angel came
[8:44] or the Dove came down of the Holy Ghost
[8:46] on the day that of the baptism of Jesus
[8:49] not making him God but giving him the
[8:51] anointing for his ministry knowing where
[8:53] he was going knowing what he was doing
[8:55] right he knew what he was doing now
[8:58] there was not a time in his his life
[8:59] that he doubted who he
[9:01] was that's our
[9:04] problem we doubt we fear Jesus said fear
[9:07] not fear not everywhere he went fear not
[9:10] fear not fear not fear not fear not fear
[9:12] not you had no fear how can you walk on
[9:14] water with fear how can you stop a a
[9:18] storm can't have fear we always you know
[9:22] you be honest both the lightning hits
[9:24] the ground what's the first thing we do
[9:26] oh my Lord what that hit is coming this
[9:28] way we're going to have a storm
[9:30] right hello
[9:32] everybody oh some of you are already in
[9:34] the Perfection no you just down in your
[9:38] bunker denying it but remember that's
[9:41] the whole key to me that's the headstone
[9:43] if Jesus was The Headstone he knew who
[9:46] he was every day of his life he knew who
[9:49] he was he had no doubt who he was now
[9:52] there was times that I'm telling you
[9:53] there was times he probably had bad days
[9:55] that's right humanly right okay
[10:01] but he never never come to a point that
[10:05] he did not know who he was right and
[10:08] that's what we have to come to like
[10:09] Brother Don was preaching Friday night
[10:11] he he he said I come you got to say I
[10:13] come from God well how many times have I
[10:14] been saying that already you got to be
[10:17] able to say that I came from God and I
[10:19] go back to God you said now wait a
[10:21] minute no what's inside what came to me
[10:24] at the new birth was with God before the
[10:26] foundation of the world it actually
[10:27] wasn't with God it was God
[10:29] right in the beginning was the word and
[10:31] the Word was with God and the Word was
[10:34] God Amen so if we have a word birth then
[10:36] what's our
[10:38] problem what we got to realize we got to
[10:40] start realizing like brother Dev saying
[10:42] who we are now that's right cuz we can't
[10:44] listen because that old denominational
[10:46] idea you hear it all the time you
[10:48] talking about people now are talking
[10:50] about the end time more than ever but
[10:51] they're putting it way out under right
[10:52] mm Jesus is coming but now I don't know
[10:55] if it'll be in my time or not you
[10:58] know we'll
[11:00] see it's going to
[11:07] happen everybody got that yes so brother
[11:10] brandham comes and he comes up to a
[11:11] place and he brings his message brother
[11:12] brandham comes to the place where God
[11:14] says this is what I sent this man to
[11:18] do remember we've been reading it you
[11:21] know even back when we all preached you
[11:22] know brother Dale myself all of us Aaron
[11:24] all of we've all preached and know for a
[11:27] fact that that there stages of ministry
[11:30] but what happens is you come to a place
[11:32] to where you hear your H where God's
[11:33] going to speak through you amen and
[11:35] that's the way it's going to be it's not
[11:37] going to be a doubt or a fear that's
[11:39] right see I believe that's why the angel
[11:41] come to brother Bram right at his in 47
[11:44] right remember 1947 when he was at the
[11:47] Cave the angel comes walking in and he
[11:49] says fear not he said you're going to be
[11:52] sent to the world you're going to pray
[11:54] for the sick you're going to pray for
[11:55] Kings you're going to pray for monarchs
[11:57] and he's sitting in a Dusty old
[11:59] cave at 30 something years old had never
[12:02] probably been out of Kentucky much all
[12:04] his life or Indiana you know traveled
[12:07] around a little bit and preached I'm
[12:08] sure cuz he was pastoring at the time
[12:10] but this Angel walks in and says your
[12:12] message is going to go around the
[12:15] world he said even cancer won't stand in
[12:17] your way when I buddy that to me and and
[12:19] brother brand saw that he placed it in
[12:21] the word see because an angel can come
[12:23] and talk to you and it be the devil
[12:25] that's
[12:26] right but I believe he he gave brother
[12:28] around keys to scripture and keys to to
[12:31] what he was doing you say why you
[12:33] telling me this it's got to happen to
[12:34] you maybe not an Angelic form come in
[12:37] and tell you what but you got to know
[12:39] your position and when you do know your
[12:40] position at that moment brother Brandon
[12:43] was probably a little bit scared right
[12:45] he was a little bit apprehensive but I
[12:47] don't know that he doubted it the only
[12:49] thing he said was is he said how can how
[12:52] can this happen you know he was
[12:54] questioning he said I'm a old he said
[12:56] he's almost see Moses same thing Angel
[12:59] come to Moses Moses said I can't talk
[13:02] good brother says I I'm an old Southern
[13:05] Kentucky and I can't talk good he said
[13:08] don't worry about that in other words
[13:10] this is your message so brother R took
[13:12] that message and believed it so that's
[13:13] what we and then what did you do he took
[13:14] it to the world that's right he did
[13:16] exactly what the angel said to me that's
[13:18] the Vindication that that angel did I
[13:21] wasn't
[13:22] there you weren't there none of you were
[13:25] there in that cave he was the only one
[13:26] in that cave but by the Vindication of
[13:28] what he
[13:29] said amen by the Vindication of what
[13:33] that angel said it came to pass exactly
[13:35] like he said it he said I'm an angel
[13:38] sent from God Almighty that's right or
[13:40] sent from the presence of the Lord I
[13:42] believe is the is the exact quote so
[13:45] brother Bram knew that an it was an
[13:46] angel because what happened the Holy
[13:49] Ghost Inside of brother brandham agreed
[13:51] with what the man said the angel said
[13:53] not a man but what the angel said right
[13:55] so there was an agreement there so you
[13:56] and I have to do the same thing well the
[13:58] Holy Ghost that we have because remember
[14:00] the Holy Ghost is a seal right right
[14:03] that's what SEALs us to the day of our
[14:05] Redemption I was reading some of that
[14:06] this
[14:07] morning on the Seal of God cuz
[14:11] listen there's only one seal and that's
[14:14] the Holy Ghost right but everything else
[14:18] is outside that
[14:20] okay let me read that for you right here
[14:23] cuz I want you to I want you to get the
[14:25] now brother
[14:27] Rand
[14:34] you're either sealed by the holy ghost
[14:38] or you have the mark of the beast
[14:40] there's no gray area there's no in
[14:43] between see I I had
[14:48] it all right right here here's one
[14:50] questions and
[14:52] ANW the mark of the beast is on today
[14:54] and the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit
[14:56] to reject it is the mark of the the
[15:00] Beast even who sees the holy ghost that
[15:03] you're supposed to receive it and don't
[15:05] do it automatically you take the mark of
[15:07] the beast because there's only two
[15:09] classes to
[15:12] exist all that didn't have the Seal of
[15:14] God had the mark of the beast so to
[15:17] receive the Seal of God is to receive
[15:18] the Holy Ghost to reject it is to have
[15:21] the mark of the beast there's the whole
[15:22] thing that's Christianity in a
[15:26] nutshell you're either sealed in or
[15:28] sealed out
[15:29] on the two sealed in or sealed out all
[15:32] right so that the Seal of God then
[15:34] brother Brown didn't come to bring us
[15:36] another seal or another Holy Ghost right
[15:40] amen he came to bring the fullness to
[15:43] show everything that's right but I still
[15:46] want to ask you a question go back to
[15:47] the same question I
[15:49] asked go back to the very same question
[15:52] that I asked what I ask when we first
[15:55] started we got it in book
[15:57] form he broke the seals to
[16:01] us told us the white horse rider was
[16:04] Antichrist showed the four
[16:07] stages right showed the four stages put
[16:10] it back in Matthew 24 took it back in
[16:12] the Bible where nobody had figured out
[16:14] that's where that Jesus had already
[16:16] preached s right went to Matthew 24 and
[16:19] brought it right back in Matthew 24 told
[16:22] us about that the fifth seal Jew brother
[16:26] rand's idea on that was that the souls
[16:28] all the that that was talking about the
[16:29] souls on the altar he thought was a
[16:31] Christian right which was not right so
[16:35] that mystery was taken care of that
[16:36] mystery was
[16:38] revealed all right The Sixth Seal
[16:41] showing that the two prophets coming to
[16:43] Israel now there
[16:45] nobody pulled out out of the Bible that
[16:47] had to come from the prophet of God he
[16:49] had he opened that six sale to us in its
[16:53] form of letter you hear me in its form
[16:55] of letter cuz like I told you before all
[16:58] all these seals open after we
[17:03] leave brother Brown said the bride goes
[17:06] up in Revelations
[17:08] 4:1 nothing to her between 4:1 and
[17:12] 1921 that's what he says nothing to her
[17:16] nothing this is all gentille now sure we
[17:19] get the spiritual application of it but
[17:22] we go up and come down so the Revelation
[17:24] 61 Falls in between that so that's the
[17:27] SE amen you said what about Revelations
[17:30] 10 well the mighty Angel is going to
[17:31] come to them you don't think Christ is
[17:34] going to preach through two prophets to
[17:36] them right yes right yes but in the days
[17:39] of the voice we know what that voice
[17:41] where that voice came from and you know
[17:43] what two prophets are going to know
[17:44] where that Bo came from they're going to
[17:46] know that that Elijah number
[17:49] four you don't think Elijah 5 is going
[17:51] to know who four
[17:54] Was Elijah for sure knew who one two and
[17:56] three was right so number five is going
[17:59] to know who four was
[18:01] so and and I was sitting there yes
[18:05] Wednesday when Daddy was preaching and
[18:06] he started to read that scripture and I
[18:08] had never really seen it that clear and
[18:11] the very thing he said came to my brain
[18:13] before he said it because he said behold
[18:15] I send you Elijah a prophet for the
[18:16] great day of the
[18:19] Lord right right they said oh that's to
[18:24] us is it all to us that's the Israel
[18:30] hello Israel is looking that's why they
[18:33] know that that Elijah is got to show up
[18:36] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[18:38] Lord cuz it's in the Old Testament you
[18:41] you'll get it in a minute okay you think
[18:43] let it run around in your head for minut
[18:44] you'll get it we know that who that was
[18:46] to us but you see how scriptures know I
[18:48] want to prove to you how scriptures have
[18:50] layers behold I will send you Elijah the
[18:53] prophet now that's the last book of the
[18:54] Old Testament of course now remember to
[18:57] the Jews there original Old and New
[18:59] Testament that's right right it's the
[19:01] Bible that's right the Torah and all the
[19:03] things that go with the Torah that's
[19:05] right I was thinking other day you know
[19:07] um you you talk to people about your
[19:08] hair and your dress and stuff and they
[19:09] say oh that was Old Testament that's in
[19:11] the Old Testament I said well the Ten
[19:12] Commandments were too why are you still
[19:14] using my point exactly I mean if
[19:17] you if you're not if you're not going to
[19:19] use this let's just take and and tithing
[19:22] is not in the New Testament tthing is in
[19:23] the Old Testament thank you if you take
[19:25] all these things in the Old Testament
[19:27] you say well well hair and dress that's
[19:29] in the you you know well hair is not but
[19:31] dress is you know you say in Deuteronomy
[19:32] and the preachers still preach out of
[19:34] the Old Testament oh yeah and that's
[19:35] what I told some I said what do you mean
[19:38] that's in the Old Testament so is The
[19:41] Ten
[19:42] Commandments our constitution was
[19:44] written according to the Old Testament
[19:49] right so you know if somebody ever tells
[19:51] you that say okay you need to take those
[19:53] Ten Commandments out of your off you out
[19:56] of your yard or wherever you know cuz
[19:57] they're no good they that's Old
[19:59] Testament that's old
[20:03] stuff but behold I will send you Elijah
[20:06] the prophet he's sending that Elijah to
[20:09] Israel before the great and Dreadful day
[20:11] of the Lord that's why they know that
[20:13] Elijah that's why when they have their
[20:15] Sedar they open the door and they look
[20:17] for they listen they are literally
[20:19] looking for Elijah we weren't looking
[20:20] for
[20:21] Elijah right right we weren't looking
[20:25] for
[20:26] Elijah in in the B and whatever else you
[20:29] were they never preached that there had
[20:30] to be a a prophet coming in the end time
[20:34] and but Israel that's the last book of
[20:37] that's that's their last book they read
[20:39] right cuz they don't have a new
[20:40] testament they read that and they say
[20:42] okay the ending up of this
[20:44] Testament there's Elijah got to come
[20:47] back before the great and Dreadful day
[20:49] of the Lord so that's what they're
[20:51] looking for so that Elijah to them
[20:54] that's right but we get the spiritual
[20:56] application that they missed the coming
[20:58] of Elijah that the Gentiles get or the
[21:01] world get because he continues on and he
[21:04] shall turn the
[21:06] heart but remember I was thinking I said
[21:09] that's that's Elijah 3:4 and
[21:12] 5ly not just Elijah 3 and 4 that's
[21:16] Elijah 5 4 and 3 or 5 3 and 4 right
[21:21] behold I will send you Elijah the
[21:22] prophet to that's Israel that's right
[21:24] all right to the two prophets right
[21:26] that's why they going to accept that
[21:28] anointing of Elijah soon as that
[21:30] anointing of Elijah comes in them
[21:31] 144,000 they going to turn right
[21:33] straight to that message I mean that
[21:36] they know he's got to come back and they
[21:38] know the end times come you see what I'm
[21:40] saying yes so behold I will send you
[21:43] live of the Prophet number five for the
[21:46] great gra for the of the Lord and he
[21:48] shall turn the heart of the what the
[21:50] fathers to the children that was
[21:52] John and the hearts of the children to
[21:55] the fathers prophet in the end time amen
[21:58] so there you got all your Elijah now you
[21:59] got one and two they were alive in the
[22:01] Old Testament John 3 John was the third
[22:05] not John 3 but John was thei and he
[22:08] Bridges from the Old Testament to the
[22:10] new right okay and I want to let's see
[22:14] who was that who was at camp meeting
[22:17] some of y'all were at camp meeting and
[22:19] brother Ryan brother Donnie made a
[22:21] statement said the Old Testament the
[22:23] first book of the Old Testament was
[22:24] James you got to remember he was talking
[22:28] about Written
[22:30] Letter cuz you know we know for a fact
[22:32] that and he brought out the death of the
[22:34] testator because the first
[22:37] book is the book of
[22:39] Acts but that wasn't the first book
[22:42] written the Book of James is the first
[22:44] book written it was written before the
[22:46] book of Acts but it didn't take place
[22:48] before the book of Acts you understand
[22:50] what I'm saying Jun had a little
[22:52] confusion on that that brother Dy was
[22:53] saying that the first book of the New
[22:54] Testament was James the first book
[22:56] written commentary written James was the
[23:00] first one to write it because remember
[23:01] he was the first one to die so he he
[23:03] wrote his first remember Herod killed
[23:06] him in the book of Acts right but the
[23:09] book of Acts was started more you say
[23:11] the book of Acts wasn't the book he was
[23:15] the book that's right right it was not a
[23:18] book Luke wrote the book of Acts and
[23:20] that's what darn was he did marvelous
[23:22] job Friday night the book of Acts was
[23:25] written by Luke and Luke was nowhere
[23:27] around Jesus
[23:28] [Music]
[23:30] nowhere around him never knew him
[23:33] personally but he wrote with perfect
[23:36] understanding and he wrote about the
[23:37] book of Acts so it had to be the Holy
[23:39] Ghost write it right and Matthew Mark
[23:42] Luke and Matthew Mark Luke and John was
[23:43] not written till like ad60 30 something
[23:47] years after Jesus had already left the
[23:48] scene well they had to recall in their
[23:50] mind they didn't have all timer
[23:53] in God looked through every bidle of
[23:55] that really cuz John was old when he
[23:57] went to pmas I mean he lived to be 90
[23:59] something years old when he went to
[24:01] patmas he was in his 70s and he comes
[24:04] back and he you know writes so it had to
[24:06] be God write these things what I'm
[24:07] saying about this God wrote this through
[24:10] a prophet but you take that Bible that
[24:14] you got in front of you and there's
[24:16] 13,000 you know brother R said it was
[24:18] 969 different denominations well that
[24:21] was back in the 50s and the early 60s I
[24:23] looked up the other day there's 13,000
[24:26] known denominations in the world now
[24:29] 13,000 known
[24:32] denominations 90% of them besides the
[24:35] ones that preach that that preach out of
[24:37] a different Bible they all preach out of
[24:39] the Bible Well the Bible on this
[24:43] right so what is it about The Written
[24:46] Letter unless it's revealed it's just
[24:47] Written Letter that's right same thing
[24:49] with this right there is a supernatural
[24:51] element hidden in these seals that
[24:53] brother brandham did not right write
[24:58] down okay you hear what I said did not
[25:01] write down did not have written or a
[25:03] sermon but now
[25:05] remember this
[25:07] quote a mystery of scripture previously
[25:11] hidden truth now divinely
[25:13] revealed okay Ryan was saying in Bible
[25:15] Study last night that he's seeing more
[25:17] and more God's revealing more and more
[25:19] of the of it right after he just reads
[25:21] the same scripture we've read like just
[25:24] like hey how many times you read Malachi
[25:26] 4
[25:29] maybe even thousands I hope but how many
[25:32] of you CAU that that Elijah was going to
[25:33] Israel and then that was Elijah was was
[25:35] John the Baptist and that Elijah was
[25:37] brother bandam you got them all right
[25:40] there to me that's a hidden Mystery
[25:43] that's a supernatural element that was
[25:45] brought to my attention and it should
[25:47] have been yours cuz Daddy two minutes
[25:49] after I thought about it cuz I looked on
[25:51] the screen and it just was like it was
[25:54] almost highlighted and then brother Dale
[25:56] prayed and then he read the script need
[25:57] to start talking about it and that's
[25:58] what he said so it it's God showing
[26:02] us but he's got to show it to us in
[26:05] stages how many times you read seal book
[26:08] how many times you took a body
[26:12] chain I thought the seals was for the
[26:14] Redemption of the body hello I thought
[26:17] the seals were for the redemp how many
[26:19] times you read it many times I wore one
[26:21] book out and I'm starting on another
[26:26] one I got 18 pains I didn't have when I
[26:28] started reading the first one right you
[26:31] understand what I'm saying yes what I'm
[26:33] saying is it's written down it is open
[26:38] amen but it's got to be a supernatural
[26:41] element it's got to be made known to us
[26:44] in this writing yes same thing with the
[26:47] Bible brother Bown did not come to bring
[26:48] us a new
[26:50] Bible
[26:52] right but he brought Clarity to what the
[26:55] Bible said amen he brought Clarity not
[26:58] to what man said amen that's right cuz
[27:02] that's what Donnie was saying he said
[27:03] you know brother R didn't come to bring
[27:04] a new Bible and then there you know the
[27:07] people now are saying that he was wrong
[27:08] here and wrong
[27:09] there no he was if he's wrong the
[27:12] Bible's wrong am then they need to just
[27:15] throw Christianity all the way out right
[27:18] they need to just throw Christianity all
[27:19] the way out that's right if they say he
[27:21] was wrong because he took everything he
[27:22] had out of the Bible but there is a
[27:24] supernatural element Still Remains
[27:26] despite the
[27:28] Revelation so despite
[27:31] 1963 that brother Brown preached these
[27:33] seals we've read them since
[27:36] 1965 51 years now bless you 51 years now
[27:40] we've read this
[27:42] right 65 to
[27:45] 2016 wow most of the people that heard
[27:48] this literally is dead honestly except
[27:51] the they were little children they weren
[27:52] but they didn't get the revelation of it
[27:54] but even brother R said it's gone from
[27:56] you we read we talked about that last
[27:58] Sunday but that Supernatural
[28:02] element this is what happened in
[28:05] 1963 in
[28:08] 1963 a voice came and thundered out in
[28:13] Jeffersonville
[28:16] Indiana to loose those SE to break those
[28:19] seals because the Thunder is what when
[28:21] the seal for of God when the seal break
[28:24] all right they were just like those
[28:28] people sitting in there and that's not
[28:29] listen they were Christians they bride
[28:31] they're going to heaven so I'm not I'm
[28:32] not putting them anywhere I'm putting
[28:33] them in their place it wasn't for them
[28:35] he said in the book questions and
[28:37] answers it's not for
[28:38] you but yet he had to break those to a
[28:41] group of people so that somebody could
[28:44] catch it do the air wve somebody could
[28:47] catch it and carry it on to the coming
[28:48] of the
[28:49] Lord but Paul comes down to the road of
[28:54] Damascus
[28:56] right God knocks him off a horse with a
[28:59] light and a thunder and all these things
[29:02] that
[29:03] happen What Paul
[29:05] say he heard Jesus speak directly to him
[29:09] sa all why pers persecutes down me now
[29:12] the people around him didn't hear it now
[29:13] they heard the Thunder the Bible say
[29:14] they heard the noise right they saw the
[29:17] light right but they never got the
[29:20] supernatural
[29:23] element right and even when God
[29:25] thundered from heaven when Jesus was
[29:26] standing there and he said I'll both
[29:29] glorify it and glorify it again in other
[29:31] words glorify me Father you hear what
[29:33] when Jesus said think it's John 17
[29:35] glorify me father with the glory we have
[29:37] before the foundation of the world and a
[29:38] voice Came From Heaven what the Bible
[29:40] say people around it heard the
[29:42] Thunder didn't hear voice that's right
[29:45] brother Brandon goes down to SAA Canyon
[29:47] he gets upon a rock he tells the
[29:49] Brethren he said go hide remember they
[29:51] said they were scattering going under
[29:53] underneath cars cuz this big old
[29:54] Whirlwind and it was throwing rocks
[29:56] everywhere he said you know the Rocks
[29:58] was cut out will it come right down over
[30:00] a prophet and did he
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] run now they
[30:05] saw the
[30:08] action right they heard the noise of the
[30:11] Whirlwind they saw the Rocks getting
[30:13] thrown around everywhere but brother
[30:16] Bram heard a voice that said judgment
[30:18] will strike the West Coast so remember
[30:21] he throw rock up in the air and he said
[30:22] thus sayth the Lord judgment was well
[30:24] God was talking to him that's the super
[30:27] natural element of that happening those
[30:30] people around him he was God wasn't
[30:32] talking to them God wasn't talking to
[30:35] Paul's people that was with him on the
[30:38] road to Damascus that's right right
[30:40] right they just heard a
[30:46] noise they just heard a
[30:49] noise they didn't get the supernatural
[30:51] element even though the noise that
[30:53] listen in every situation they knew
[30:56] something happened
[30:58] in every situation everybody even all
[31:01] those Brethren brother R what what
[31:03] happened what was it what was it they
[31:05] knew something happened but they didn't
[31:08] get the supernatural element God was
[31:10] revealing something to his
[31:13] prophet and all they saw was lights and
[31:15] thunder and
[31:16] noise amen so the Thunder is the voice
[31:19] of God when the seals broke so the seals
[31:21] broke in 1963 by the voice of a prophet
[31:24] bringing a
[31:26] message
[31:27] right the people you you hear them on
[31:29] the tape they're shouting they're
[31:31] they're praising God they're they're
[31:32] raising their hands they're they're
[31:33] worshiping that this great message has
[31:36] come to an Apex of breaking those Seven
[31:41] Seals
[31:44] right 51 years later we're still
[31:51] here this has been printed in hundreds
[31:53] of different languages and it's been
[31:55] preached on and spoke about
[31:58] but there's a supernatural element that
[32:00] we're not getting and you say brother
[32:02] way do you know it no I don't know you
[32:05] got to know it for yourself I'm standing
[32:07] up here and thunder all day long that's
[32:09] right I believe when a minister goes to
[32:11] the pull pit he's thundering out the
[32:13] voice of God if he's telling the truth
[32:16] that's right right but we've got to
[32:19] catch I mean how much of a sermon do you
[32:22] catch be real 10% be real how much of a
[32:25] sermon do you catch well that was a good
[32:27] message Brother D what did I say 15
[32:29] minutes after my sermon started you just
[32:32] have to shoot me cuz I wouldn't know
[32:35] right but I got an element that come
[32:38] through that yes I got an element that
[32:42] will connect to me that I can go study
[32:44] or an element that could is one of those
[32:46] aha moments you know yeah like the other
[32:48] day you
[32:49] know I've been reading that all my life
[32:51] and you know it was one of those moments
[32:54] to where God spoke to you that's right
[32:58] he called me an eagle that day and he
[32:59] might have called you a buzzard that day
[33:02] but he might have called me a buzzard
[33:03] one day cuz sometimes you satep there
[33:04] and go this must not be for me cuz I
[33:07] ain't getting nothing out of it you know
[33:10] but God I hope it's for somebody else
[33:11] you know I mean really let's be honest
[33:14] we don't get everything but to me here's
[33:16] my whole point that super Supernatural
[33:20] element is not words on the paper that's
[33:23] why brother brandham said the seven
[33:25] Thunders are not written
[33:28] right they're not written
[33:31] anywhere Thunder one you see what I'm
[33:34] saying yeah Thunder too right cuz
[33:37] remember John was getting ready to ride
[33:38] them in the Book of Revelations and God
[33:40] said don't ride them that's right John
[33:43] saw he must have saw something of a
[33:47] symbol or some element and God said
[33:49] don't write that down but remember John
[33:52] didn't get the supernatural element of
[33:54] it or he took a Rapture so he died and
[33:57] went by the grave so it wasn't for him
[33:58] it was for a group of people I believe
[34:00] now on on the on the on the ground at
[34:03] this moment that's
[34:05] right it says Supernatural element Still
[34:08] Remains despite the Revelation I thought
[34:11] the supernatural element was a
[34:13] revelation no this is the
[34:15] Revelation brother B revealed the Seven
[34:17] Seals to
[34:20] us white horse rider
[34:22] handc there's a revelation that
[34:24] Revelation had never been seen before
[34:28] but that Supernatural element how are
[34:30] you going to get how you going to get a
[34:31] body change out of realizing the Devil
[34:33] is a white
[34:34] horse right you're not that's not that's
[34:38] the supernatural
[34:43] element how many of you read in the name
[34:45] of the father and of the son and of the
[34:48] Holy Ghost that's Bible that's black and
[34:51] white that brother told me one time he
[34:52] said that's black and white plane in the
[34:54] Bible absolutely that's a Revelation
[34:57] that you got to be
[34:59] baptized in the name of the father and
[35:01] of the son and of the Holy Ghost that's
[35:03] what Jesus said that's the Revelation he
[35:05] gave to the
[35:07] people but they turned it into literal
[35:10] father son Holy Ghost baptism but now
[35:12] the supernatural element
[35:14] never
[35:16] ever revealed Father Son and Holy Ghost
[35:19] was the correct baptism listen God went
[35:23] at the ignorance of people that baptized
[35:25] in the name of fathers and the Holy
[35:26] Ghost
[35:27] right because their Revelation was that
[35:31] it was the father Son and Holy Ghost
[35:32] Martin Luther's Revelation was to
[35:35] baptize in the name of Father Son and
[35:36] Holy Ghost and God winked at that
[35:38] revelation of ignorance you say well
[35:40] that was totally
[35:41] wrong
[35:43] absolutely but that Supernatural element
[35:45] had not broke coming up to this age to
[35:49] where we can understand cuz listen get
[35:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:54] Christ ain't going to save you right so
[35:57] there's even a supernatural element past
[35:59] that you see what I mean that how do
[36:00] y'all think that we got it all no we
[36:02] just got enough to get us into heaven
[36:05] just enough that's why I told you about
[36:07] the 10 virgins why did the five foolish
[36:11] go to the wise cuz they knew they had it
[36:13] but why didn't the wise say we've got an
[36:15] abundance we can just pour it out all
[36:17] over you they didn't say that they said
[36:20] we've only got enough for ourself you go
[36:24] get
[36:25] yours
[36:27] mhm cuz the foolish version gets a
[36:31] revelation yes sir yes listen they're
[36:34] white they're Justified and Sanctified
[36:37] truly Justified and
[36:41] Sanctified they think they got the Holy
[36:44] Ghost right until they find out that
[36:47] they don't
[36:48] yeah that's your story see you just keep
[36:51] digging into the five wise and five fols
[36:52] bur you just keep digging in a little
[36:54] bit F five wise say look we just got
[36:57] just enough you know what I'm this let
[36:59] me put it in 2016 version We preached
[37:02] this for 51 years we don't have time to
[37:05] preach at 51
[37:08] more that's what the five wise is going
[37:10] to tell the five foolish the five
[37:12] foolish vergins like brother Donnie said
[37:14] it's not that they were virgins they
[37:16] were both
[37:17] virgins the key is that one set was wise
[37:22] and one set was foolish I really like
[37:25] that I I'm going to use that in in a
[37:27] sermon because it's not that they were
[37:29] virgins they were both
[37:31] virgins and one had a whale in their
[37:33] lamp and the other was that's correct
[37:36] wise and foolish is the only two words
[37:39] you need to use that's the key words in
[37:40] that whole cuz remember there was five
[37:45] take the word wise out there was five
[37:47] virgins and then there was five more
[37:49] virgins Bible said it was 10 virgins
[37:53] right five were wise put them in the
[37:56] category and five were foolish put them
[37:59] in the
[38:00] category amen that's right you see what
[38:04] I'm saying yeah they were all 10 virgins
[38:08] brother Brown preached 10 virgins there
[38:10] was 10 of them they looked just
[38:14] alike they were
[38:16] virgin but five were
[38:19] wise they caught a supernatural element
[38:21] that these five didn't right amen right
[38:26] listen there's a supernatural element
[38:28] that's going to be revealed right on
[38:29] down through time even when we we're
[38:32] just going to get enough of the seals to
[38:34] change our body because to me like
[38:36] Brother D says the seals is a revelation
[38:37] of the entire Bible entire Bible and you
[38:41] think we can get everything out here I
[38:43] don't think so yes sure um you're saying
[38:48] that um the supernatural power and uh to
[38:51] get a body change you have to be able to
[38:54] say but we somebody here have to be able
[38:56] to say my father and I are one I come
[39:00] from God I went back to God God my
[39:02] father and I are one with other said
[39:05] until you can say that it's not possible
[39:07] to get about
[39:10] J

[39:14] going to be that that you're going to
[39:16] not believe that you can do
[39:18] it you say that's too simple you find me

[39:41] five is foolish that to me that clears
[39:43] up a lot you going to have to talk loud
[39:46] all right hello she can do it uh I just
[39:49] wanted to say without the baptism of the
[39:52] Holy Ghost there's no way that you can
[39:54] see who you are that's correct no way
[39:55] you get that
[39:57] that's right that's exactly right you
[39:59] got to have the baptism of the Holy
[40:01] Ghost or you will not you might you
[40:03] might get Justified and Sanctified
[40:05] that's why I believe a lot of people in
[40:06] the message are just Justified and
[40:07] Sanctified cuz they think they got it
[40:09] they got a revelation listen when I was
[40:11] 14 years old I had a
[40:13] revelation of what happened in the
[40:16] garden I had a revelation of water
[40:20] baptism but I didn't have a supernatural
[40:22] element cuz I wasn't born
[40:23] again but I did get a revelation you
[40:26] said how did that happen well Judas got
[40:28] a revelation didn't he brother Brown
[40:30] said he was justified and
[40:33] Sint that's why brother D's been
[40:35] bringing that out
[40:37] strong so close they don't dece the very
[40:42] La the five foolish virgins were so
[40:44] close to the wise they knew where to go
[40:46] to get all that's right they weren't
[40:49] just way out you under somewhere living
[40:50] off in on an island somewhere do you

[40:54] right around
[40:57] because they were virgins they were
[40:58] right
