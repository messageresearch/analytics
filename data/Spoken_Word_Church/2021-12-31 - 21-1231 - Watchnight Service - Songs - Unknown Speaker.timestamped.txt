[1:27] even the
[1:29] waters they obeyed his will
[1:35] and he calmed their storms
[1:38] just like he
[1:40] will mine
[1:42] if i'll just remember
[1:46] that he lives deep inside

[3:03] when trials come
[3:06] and death is so nice
[3:10] i'll just search for the master

[33:12] people that just put their talent before
[33:13] god and god will use it and he'll bless

[51:42] and as you know i had headaches i've
[51:44] never had headaches like that but it
[51:46] wasn't just a headache
[51:47] it was a daily headache for about a
[51:50] month and a half i mean i woke up with a
[51:52] headache i stayed with a headache
[51:54] no medicine would take it away
[51:57] until we got a neurologist out in texas
[52:00] that gave me some relief medication but
[52:02] it wasn't it was just to relieve it but
[52:05] it didn't go away and um
[52:07] and then uh finally i went to a doctor
[52:10] another neurologist i think i went to
[52:12] about eight specialists
[52:14] i started feeling like that woman in the
[52:15] bible where she spent all her money on
[52:17] doctors
[52:18] and
[52:19] he started talking to me about giving me
[52:21] seizure medicine
[52:23] and the medicine was going to give me
[52:25] glaucoma it was going to give me the
[52:27] kidney stones
[52:29] and i just sat there i said this is no
[52:31] way i want to go
[52:32] and i'd even talk to sister julia about
[52:34] it she's like sister milka don't sign up
[52:36] for those rattlesnakes
[52:38] so i said lord you're gonna have to move
[52:40] because i'm not getting sick because the
[52:42] lord has really kept me in good health
[52:44] and he really moved for me i finally was
[52:46] able to go to somebody that actually did
[52:48] physio physical therapy
[52:50] uh which really helped but i really also
[52:52] want to thank the lord because he was

[1:48:42] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:48:44] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:48:47] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:48:49] of me
[1:48:50] after the same manner also he took the
[1:48:52] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[1:48:53] cup is the new testament in my blood
[1:48:56] that had to be the death of a testator
[1:48:58] for a new testament to come into force
[1:49:00] amen he knew he was getting ready to die
[1:49:02] and the new testament was coming in
[1:49:04] the cup is
[1:49:05] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:49:07] blood this do you as often as you drink
[1:49:09] it in remembrance of me
[1:49:11] for as often as you eat this dr bread
[1:49:13] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:49:14] lord's death
[1:49:16] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:49:19] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:49:20] lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:49:23] body and blood of the lord
[1:49:25] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:49:27] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:49:28] cup
[1:49:29] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:49:31] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:49:33] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:49:35] body
[1:49:36] what is the lord's body me and you
[1:49:39] amen
[1:49:40] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:49:42] among you in many sleep for if we would
[1:49:44] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:49:47] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:49:49] to the lord that we should not be
[1:49:50] condemned with the world thank god
[1:49:53] amen we're in the world but not of the
[1:49:55] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:49:57] come together to eat terry
[1:49:59] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:50:00] lady meet at home
[1:50:02] that you come not together in the
[1:50:03] condemnation and rest well i'll set an
[1:50:05] order
[1:50:06] when i come let's have a moment of
[1:50:08] silence the prophet of god said pray for
[1:50:10] your pastor
[1:50:12] and let's pray for our brothers
[1:50:22] lord as we come into a new year
[1:50:26] let this not be
[1:50:28] a ritual
[1:50:30] but let this be a revelation as our
[1:50:31] brother said
[1:50:34] as we eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:50:38] lord you made us worthy
[1:50:41] and you told us to do this in
[1:50:42] remembrance of you lord so what greater
[1:50:45] thing can we do the first thing of the
[1:50:46] year is to remember you and how you
[1:50:48] suffered and died
[1:50:50] and how you shed your blood
[1:50:52] you took stripes on your back and you
[1:50:54] took a crown of thorns on your head
[1:50:56] just for me
[1:50:58] father we pray that the world will see
[1:51:00] you but we know that you said the world
[1:51:01] will not see you anymore
[1:51:03] only the bride
[1:51:05] the ones that you dwell in father
[1:51:08] i pray that you'd be with us now and
[1:51:10] bless us in jesus name
[1:51:12] amen
[1:51:14] the bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:51:15] it dear heavenly father this bread lord
[1:51:17] was made with holy hands it was made
[1:51:20] without anything lord to make it rise
[1:51:22] lord it's unleavened
[1:51:25] now we pray lord as we partake of this
[1:51:27] lord that it'll be a blessing to each
[1:51:29] and every one of us in jesus name
[1:51:32] amen i know a lot of us
[1:51:35] we take communion different ways and
[1:51:37] we've done this for so many years and
[1:51:40] some
[1:51:41] some use one cup
[1:51:44] but
[1:51:45] i don't think it matters
[1:51:50] brown used many cups and
[1:51:53] that's not an excuse but
[1:51:54] or anything but i just think one cup's
[1:51:56] fine
[1:51:57] i mean
[1:51:58] fine and also mini cups is fine so just
[1:52:00] whatever you think you know
[1:52:02] your church is sovereign
[1:52:05] your church is sovereign
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:09] but if you'll do it to the lord i
[1:52:11] promise you you'll get something out of
[1:52:12] it
[1:52:14] you do it unto yourself you won't but
[1:52:15] you do it unto the lord you'll get
[1:52:17] something out of it
[1:52:18] amen
[1:52:19] yeah
[1:52:22] we take this bread i was talking to
[1:52:26] a judge over in in bates county good
[1:52:30] friend of mine
[1:52:32] tim harper
[1:52:34] and he asked me he said you said you
[1:52:35] were going to take communion i said yeah
[1:52:36] we're going to take him in
[1:52:38] he said what do y'all use for bread and
[1:52:40] you know for the
[1:52:42] i said we need real wine he just kind of
[1:52:44] looked at me strange
[1:52:46] he said you use real wine i said yeah i
[1:52:48] think that's what they drank in the
[1:52:49] upper room
[1:52:50] it wasn't a substitute
[1:52:52] it wasn't grape juice but i remember
[1:52:53] when dad used to do it in the in the uh
[1:52:57] in the uh
[1:52:58] baptist church
[1:53:00] they'd take welch's grape juice and i
[1:53:02] told brother tim i said and we even they
[1:53:04] even cut it for the older one so it
[1:53:05] wouldn't burn their throat
[1:53:07] so he just kind of giggled a little bit
[1:53:09] and also we uh
[1:53:10] i remember him taking the bread and
[1:53:12] brother
[1:53:13] chris they would buy it in a box
[1:53:15] it's a little bitty wafer about like
[1:53:16] this and they freeze it and hold it over
[1:53:19] now tonight when we're finished taking
[1:53:20] this bread
[1:53:22] i'm gonna burn it
[1:53:23] beyond
[1:53:25] edible
[1:53:26] because we don't want to hold it over
[1:53:28] see that's a revelation we've got and
[1:53:30] this is a revelation that we take and he
[1:53:32] he about had a fit he said you mean
[1:53:34] y'all drink wine
[1:53:36] i said yes we drink wine he said now
[1:53:39] he said now when i asked my pastor about
[1:53:41] drinking wine and he said that we've got
[1:53:43] some alcoholics in our in our
[1:53:45] congregation and and we don't think it
[1:53:47] would be good to do that and and i
[1:53:48] looked at tim and he looked to me and
[1:53:50] he's just a nominal christian guy real
[1:53:52] good guy
[1:53:53] and i said well
[1:53:54] i said i look at it like this
[1:53:58] if you're shouting and running the
[1:54:00] aisles and you fall and break your leg
[1:54:02] that's you
[1:54:03] that ain't gone
[1:54:04] so if you want if you believe that this
[1:54:06] wine is what you're supposed to take it
[1:54:09] ain't going to bother your alcohol it's
[1:54:10] anonymous right right god it's not that
[1:54:13] way god instituted us to take it like
[1:54:15] this and this is the way we're going to
[1:54:17] take it right heavenly father lord
[1:54:20] this wine was also made and prepared
[1:54:22] with holy hands
[1:54:24] and father i pray now as we partake of
[1:54:26] this lord it will remember you lord of
[1:54:28] what you did for us
[1:54:29] and this wine lord it won't sour it gets
[1:54:31] better with age
[1:54:33] and lord that's your word father just
[1:54:35] gets better and better with age
[1:54:37] we pray now that you'd be with us as we
[1:54:38] partake of this communion
[1:54:40] and be with us in the name of the lord
[1:54:42] jesus christ amen
