sick save us when we're lost his name is Jesus Christ and we appreciate him what he done for us dying for us on the cross never forget Calvary folks I don't care what we can get all up in the the Great Heights and all of of the message but don't ever forget what God did for you don't ever forget Calvary don't ever forget that Jesus that died for me and you something you can't do you can't die and give me eternal life but he did so we thank God for that that we know that person and um for for your information if anybody and you should only um be downstairs if you're sick but the monitors are turned off all over the church except these because the thing's flickering in the back and some way it takes up all the juice and then now the uh um for us to have it here there won't be any downstairs or in the in any of the rooms so we'll try to get that fixed it's some little box some little devil that's um trying to stop service but but uh like Anderson said y'all ought to be in up here anyway I like Anderson I love him he's so nice they ought to be right here everybody love Brother Anderson he does a good job did a good job last night hooking us up to the uh to the questions and answers and we really had a good time and it's good to have I feel really safe today cuz we have an active Marine in the building right brother Elijah good to have you with us today that's brother Anderson's uh nephew and he's here with us for for today at least and we sure appreciate you brother and appreciate your service to this country we sure do we always appreciate the freedom that we have because somebody else gave their life or gave their time for us to be able to do that amen so we always honor our our veterans and our active servicemen so uh brother Aaron will be preaching for us Wednesday night um like I said the questions and answers are Bible Study last night was was wonderful we really enjoyed it and uh we'll be touching a little bit on it today usually sometimes we weave into uh into what uh what we talked about because the anointing still there of what we were talking about but but um one of the things that really come out of the the first question that brother John dured asked was about his children and we all have children we all were children so we had a good discussion cry about our kids and uh they're part of you we love them all I love your kids but I'm not connected to them right you are connected to them by DNA they came forth from you they're yours you claim them I claim them but you claim them cu the Bible said you'll be there with your offsprings you claim them yes sir don't look at the circumstances we are children of Abraham If Abraham would have wrote down every circumstance he' have never had that child Isa would have never come into being if he would have wrote down I'm too old can't do this Sarah can't do that I'm this I'm too old right he didn't write any of that down he he he looked and brother R said it just like he had the baby right he just had to go through the 25 year journe 25 years we can't wait 15 minutes 20 minutes Hour 2 days 3 weeks 2 years 25 years for one promise to come to pass but you know what it came to pass that's the faith of Abraham that we have so we appreciate the Bible Study last night we had a really good time um now um let me see oh between Services um they have uh Sister Mary kamani was um gracious enough to uh slave over the stove and make us some not some um lasagna so there's pans of La lasagna downstairs that we didn't eat last night there's stuff for y'all to eat if you didn't bring anything thing or if you did bring something feel free to eat whatever's down there cuz there's my mama's corn and my mama's green beans down there that we brought from home so we got all that downstairs please eat between services but remember do brother Bob it's the middle room where the bathroom's at and the other one right both rooms those two rooms will be closed so if you need to use the bathroom you'll have to come up here if you want to eat you need to go outside all of us eat in the middle room and the we need to get out in the common room or go outside I don't know what it is out there now but you can get underneath the shed and sit down and eat but you can't be there because of the voting part going on between Services all right and that will be done at the second service will be before it starts that'll be it right that's the cut off all right so if you hadn't voted please do you've got till 2:00 and but stay out of those two rooms unless you are going to vote and we appreciate everyone coming today and participating uh next Sunday we're talking about communion let's have communion on the first after the first service because the second service is going to be a worship service some may not want to stay and some don't come back second service anyway but uh we're going to have communion after the first service next Sunday all right communion and foot washing after the first service next Sunday and um it'll help to uh to facilitate you know the afternoon service where we may sing a little longer or we may may sing a little shorter we don't know we're going to practice for those of you that don't know we're going to practice songs we're going to worship we're going to um have the song leaders work on new songs we're going to have the musicians work on notes and and all that so um just enjoy yourself but we will have communion first service next Sunday and we may run it just a little bit till we don't start till 2:30 if it runs over I'll try to to shorten it down some and U and we get the communion in on the first service so remember that also like um brother um Ryan was talking about brother um Andrew Glover will be here on the 16th and we're going to have a hot dog social that weekend we got so many hot dogs till Oscar Meyer's out of business so we are going to have hot dogs and hamburgers I mean hot dogs and and chili and and the trimmings all that whole weekend till we get rid of that stuff everybody say amen amen it's just round Stak I love round State I love that stuff that and baloney don't don't talk about what's in it but it's just good I told them many times before I said if CH if the Chinese food they say it's all cat I said if they make cat taste that good I'll eat it I don't mind one bit so we're going to have a hot dog social that weekend so if you're wondering what we're going to have we're going to have hot dogs all right if you don't like hot dogs you better bring you something else cuz we're going to have hot dogs we'll have a hot dog social that not this coming week Kim but the next one my brother Andrew Glover's here with us if brother Homer longor was here with us he used to live on weenie sandwiches he' tell us he'd cut them weenies up put them in a sandwich with some bread and that's what he ate well you can tell it so let's turn your Bibles to Revelations 1 like I like I said again thank you all for coming thank you for yesterday for for participating in that service last night we we got some I think we got some questions answered and uh we learned a little bit from the Lord thank you all for being there and I want to re reiterate one more time for any of you that have a office song leader musician is iffy but if you got a spiritual part of this church you need to be at Bible study every time we have it because 99% of us are thank you thank you for somebody saying that right so and we're not singling nobody out but it's like I said last night you don't have to tell Holy Ghost Phill people to go to church you're talking to the unbeliever and the mate believer when you tell people they need to go to church cuz a True Believer will always go to church regardless if your cat's got diarrhea as we talked about last night so Revelations 1 verse1 I sounds so silly but that's kind of the mistakes we make and then you know Monday and Tuesday next week we look on Facebook and you hauled it all up to Pigeon Forge and boy you can't sit in church for never mind I'm sorry for an hour and a half and you drive four hours up there and it just it's what's in your heart come on somebody it's what's in your heart if it's not in your heart you're not going to do it God's going to have to get in touch get in touch with you just like your kids you God's got to get in touch with your kids I wish my mom would have saved me 20 years ago or 30 40 years ago now but it wasn't time and she can't save me I got one that can though I got one that can there a heavenly father that can save any person on the face of the Earth that hadn't blasphemed the Holy Ghost amen that's a promise that we have that he'll save our kids just like brother Brown said whatever Faith you got for you you apply it to your kids if you don't have faith enough for yourself you don't have faith enough for your kids so you have faith enough that you're sitting here today under the under the anointing of the Lord and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost send that thing to your children send that thing out to them all right and let's get this thing started and get it out of here get us out of here so we're going to talk about the messenger part two today Revelations 1 Let's bow our heads Lord we' had the people standing a long time I pray that you'd anoint the word anoint the people the hearers and the speakers father I pray that you'd be with ones that are sick be the ones that are not with us today bless the ones that are online Lord that are watching in we pray that you'd touch their bodies Lord if they're sick father and I pray that you'd be with the bride around the world Lord just give us an anointing today father that we can't even stand that it'll be so overflowing till we'll lift our hands and and and tell you how much we love you Lord thank you so much for giving us a a a a congregation and a church to go to and and family and friends Lord we appreciate it all father just bless again all of our children that are wavered Lord I pray that right now that it'll stir their water so much till they'll be so aggravated till they'll be so Restless till they'll have to cry out to you Lord and we we believe that with all our heart cuz you're in the business of still saving people amen Lord save the ones that need saving you know who they are in Jesus name we pray amen Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice of of a ET saying I am Alpha we're still talking about the Alpha and Omega bride the first and the last what thou seest right in the book and send it to the seven churches we don't have to name them and I turned to see the voice and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks oh sorry about that all the old people are squinting amen okay sorry sorry I was hey y'all go ahead and sit down I don't I don't want you to be standing up so much just amen says the older people amen amen see there told you and they identifi theirself very quickly all right can I can we read it now I'm sorry I was reading it just fine right where I was at all right so I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and we understand all that and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle Revelations 1:16 he had an right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword now the mystery of those seven stars and as I've been saying before the connection God has with these people see I don't have a problem with with brother RMA always tells us he said it's hard for one man to believe another man right CU there's always that question there's always that well what angle there no there's not an angle he had seven men that he brought the message to gave it to them and they gave it to the people and listen God had a group of people there that would receive it all right he didn't have a group of people there that just said well I don't think I'll that's not for me it's for somebody else there was a group of people that when they heard Luther preach they said as had he right said that ain't nothing but the truth amen do we say that do we have that same Revelation that this is nothing but the truth there is no false Doctrine there is no error in this message now there's error in people there's error in people but there's not an error in this message amen cuz it came straight from God it came through the logos and we got 1,00 sermons of the voice of God speaking to us in our generation and then as we were talking about last night the five-fold ministry then breaks it down and carries it and gives it to the people even even though the messengers already laid away all right that's the way God said he was going to do it we'll look at it here in just a minute but the Seven Stars are the Angels and the Seven candlesticks are the seven churches all right Amos 5:8 says seek him that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion and we'll talk about that way later on because there is Seven Stars and then we know there's eight manifestations of God so the seven Church ages is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentile Nation now you hear what I said to the Gentiles yes not to the not to the whole world to the Gentile us Nations our dispensation is soon to be over yes sir whether you like it or not amen then he goes to the Jews he's not coming back and getting you again that's right no this is it when he shuts the door it's closed all right and then he goes and and uh takes three and A2 years of a message to the Jews same message you're hearing today amen and and they and they realized the 144,000 realize what happened they missed the whole thing that's right they missed it all but now through two prophets as we're standing here today telling that the Messiah is here to save our children the Messiah is here to save us it's the same Messiah that's going to go over there that they missed back 2,000 years ago and he's going to what he's going to save their soul he's not going to do like we said last night God will never when you come to the Lord God will never say what took you so long right he knows exactly how long it took you came at your time yes sir cuz God's perfect I don't know if y'all knew that or not but there's a new dispensation then we we saw the old dispensation which was the Old Testament and I kind of I think I may have said it before but I kind of threw him a curve at work the other day they was talking about Jesus and being in the New Testament and I said no Jesus wasn't in the New Testament oh Lord well he wasn't the Bible said he was born under the law what was the law the Old Testament he was born under the law to redeem them what that are under the law he came to bring them out to bring a new as we're going to read next Sunday a new testament someone had to die so the testator that gave this will had to pass away all right then there become a New and Living Way which was now through the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was not in the Old Testament I mean Jesus would even tell them he would heal them he' say hey go do the law of Moses what do you know what I'm saying when a leper was healed he would have to go to the temple show itself to the priest and the priest would declare him clean now why did Jesus just say well bless God you ain't got to go tell them nothing you're healed no soon as he healed him he said go do the law of Moses why cuz he was still in the Old Testament there was not a New and Living Way yet it was coming yes it was introduced by John and he was standing there but he saved no one while he was here that's right the bride dispensation was inside of that man but it was not fulfilled on the outside until the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on a group of people 120 in the Upper Room everybody good but Paul picks it up and says a New and Living Way that's what you and I are living under right now A New and Living Way yes sir not some new do no remember what Paul did and we'll get to it in a little bit Paul took the Old Testament listen there was no New Testament written like this when Paul was here he was writing it himself parts of it so he took that Old Testament and wrote 80% of the New Testament off of that Old Testament scroll now what a prophet though because Caiaphas and all the other ones even G milon of different ones they didn't see that why they weren't supposed to because they weren't a mouthpiece of God they didn't come straight from God they didn't have the will of God they didn't have the logos of God but Paul did CU he was a messenger he was one of those Stars so a new testament is a new is a covenant or a will a new testament that the testator had to die so we had to have someone to die before we could live that's right so each age had his message and its messenger all through the times every age has packed his message with a messenger god in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time all right just coming back through now brother R explained this in the seals but I kind of broke it down where we can understand it there was an announcement in heaven so out of the mind of God comes the logos words a sealed up message that that that Columba had a message but it wasn't the Just sh Faith all right but when Luther stepped forward God said this is what I want you to tell the people that the just not not penants not not uh novenas not laying out on a board not dragging yourself through the through the through the briers no the just shall live by faith God was happy with Luther during that time even though Luther had some false ideas I said Luther did God don't but then he took that man off the s and here it just kept rolling to Wesley and then John Wesley stands up and says hey you can't do like Luther you can't go in a pub and drink a beer and smoke a pipe all right you got to come and be Sanctified and God said that's exactly what I'm saying that's exactly what I'm telling you yes sir books were being printed at that time Bibles were being printed so people were able to read it but what happened though the Catholic Church took all that back and started reading it in Latin and nobody understood anything so Luther comes out puts his th that's on the wall and says hey the just shall live by faith that's in the Bible listen the just shall live by faith in the Old Testament am there is we don't we don't discount the Old Testament we know that those of you that are that that don't come here we don't discount the Old Testament it's all a building block but we don't live where we sacrifice animals and and have to go the priest goes one time a year and and oh that'd be so easy that'd be so easy to come to church once a year like some of y'all do anyway praise the Lord anyhow let one high priest go in and he's got it he did it all brother Kylie so see you next year about Christmas I'm not talking to you you know that but God gives us an announcement and then a it's all right he said a messenger when you get when you get older they like whatever but a sealed up message is open and listen Luther may have read in the Bible as the Bible was being written Luther may have read hey you need to be Sanctified the unclean Spirit goes out he may have read some of that because it was coming together but he didn't have a revelation of that part the revelation of his part was is if you believe you live by faith you're Justified God justifies those that live by him and his and your faith through him which is his faith anyway then John Wesley he comes and reads the same Bible that's right and he sees though that the unclean Spirit goes out he sees that there are there's a sanctifying in the blood and all Paul talks about it all well he picks that up what is it it's an announcement from God the logos the speech of God a sealed up message is opened and a mystery is unfolded to the star of that age which is the messenger that picks up the L God from God one person one person to every every Church age not two not three one all right now there are many other ministers in between that but as we were talking about last night there's Major Prophets Minor Prophets prophets in the five-fold ministry there's different levels of prophets all right so a trumpet then sounds what happens Luther finally stepped out one day nailed o thus and said I ain't going back to Catholic Church no more right amen the just shall live by faith abolutely this is what I'm living by he made a stand brother Rand stands up he says I ain't going back to that Pentecostal I'm going forward I'm not going to that Baptist I'm not going to that Methodist I'm going forward all right so the message is proclaimed but now as we see the message being proclaimed and we'll see in brother bram's day and parallel in Jesus cuz everybody loved Jesus everybody Lov Jes Jesus when he was taking Five Loaves and and giving you a social program you know feeding 5,000 people and everybody's like right turned the water into wine well he was doing good everybody lik that but when he stood up one day and said my daddy ain't your daddy right hall when he told the religious group of the day my father is not your father amen I'm the Son of God he never proclaimed that but they told him and they they knew enough he said we're not going to kill you for your good work we're killing you because you said you were God cuz he told him he said hey you read in your Old Testament that you are Gods who the word comes to so the Bible didn't have any problem with that but the religious people did because remember as as God sends his people to hear the message so does Satan send his people to destroy it sir right all right so so we can't say well this is just a flower bed of ease like we were talking about last night I wish that when we got saved everybody got saved around me a happening Satan turns every gun on you and he's shooting at you then so we just are going to have issues as Christians because the world hates us Satan hates us more than anything Satan hates us so he'll send everything in the world yes sir to make us not believe or not come to church or or or as they're doing now brother R them down they just need to get born again a trumpet sounds a message is proclaimed a church age begins a distinct and declared message all right so we understand the just shall live by faith sanctification Pentecostals with the gifts and then brother randam bringing the pure unadulterated word restoring us back to the faith of the fathers that we're talking about now the first church age because Alpha and Omega has to be the same or mirror image of each other other but it starts a spiritual war as we were saying last night it starts a war I told him I said all y'all sitting in here tonight it's a war it's a battle yes it is and the reason you're here crying your eyes out for your kids it's because of that battle but it's because you're on The Winning Side you on the Victorious side you said I'm going to make a stand right here I'm not going to right you can XYZ wherever some of y'all were that weren't here last night they were here crying for their kids where were you save my kids start living in front of them right I said that we said that last night right brother D's always said a lot of your kids are not here because of you now he said that I'm you get mad at him don't get mad at me because of the life you live in front of I will I'm going to continue preaching starts a spiritual war the true word of God versus false Doctrine all right everybody with me so there's going to be false Doctrine okay we've got to watch for it that's why I said last night we were talking about uh the five-fold ministry and how uh when I started coming back to church I had some of the younger ministers that were my age or or that I associated with that dad never associated with well I would say hey we need to listen to brother Andrew GL of course he was a you by then back then but you know we need to can can we bring this one in and he says where they go to church and I wonder why he asked me that three or four times said where' they go to church I said well they go and they all did but he said there'll nobody ever preach in this church they doesn't have a church amen now think about that you won't preach in this church if you don't have a church cuz there was too many Fly by Night people that came through here back in the 70s and ' 80s and and and flew in and and flew out and you never heard from them or they were over here and they never had you got to have listen you got to have a place to go to church listen je forny those whole the whole time he was an evangelist he proclaimed that Tim Humes was his pastor and that that was the church that he went to now whether he preached 80 something uh days a year somewhere else that was still his home Church yes sir so you got to have a home Church you got to have some kind of stability to be able to as I'm saying here false Doctrine can come in but if you're sitting under a real true good pastor I don't care if you're an evangelist or whatever teacher you got to listen faith comes by hearing not by preaching all right so then when the messenger listen when his voice is finished the messenger is laid away remember Joshua stood there and he was um tutored with by Moses all that period of time but Moses went off the scene right amen he even was real plain he looked at Joshua and he looked at the people through Joshua and said Moses thy servant is dead that's right brother brandom's gone sure we give honor but why go backwards why go backwards there's a lot of people and I'm going to say it one time and I'm not going to ever say it again some people people's Holy Ghost is what's standing in the pull pit I've seen it in many many churches something happened to the pastor and he die or or leave and go somewhere else two or three people go with him or don't even go back to church again why that person was their Holy Ghost don't you ever make anybody in this pull pit your Holy Ghost not a man nobody you make the God of this universe be your Holy Ghost and then you know what he'll lead you and guide you into all truth you'll know what you do and then you not dependent on one person to make it everybody all right with that because God keeps moving he'll use somebody for Hey Brother Ram told us he said God can use a minister One Time One sermon right one of the greatest preachers was John the Baptist six months yes sir he didn't have a worldwide campaign either he stayed in the Jordan River most of the time right but it was powerful God needed that if God uses you for one sermon and not anymore praise God if God uses you for that absolutely amen amen so that messenger is laid away or taken off the Earth and then we have to decide the people accept it or reject it bringing a temporary judgment or a plague in other words spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger we'll look here in just a few minutes where Paul said Grievous wolves are going to come in but he didn't say he he he continued on he said um it's going to happen in here it's not just going to be out there it's going to happen right here among you all right so the next day same thing announcement out of the mind of God comes a logos a sealed up message is open a Mysteries unfolded to the star of that age and then he proclaims his message and then God puts him away takes him off the Earth and leaves the anointing on the earth oh yes sir all right he leaves that prophetic that's why brother R kept telling us he he sure he was the listen he was the funnel the trumpet that God used to trumpet out but you and I have to hear it and if it's an uncertain sound you're not born again but if it rings in your heart and you say that ain't nothing but the truth that's what rings in your heart yes sir it's a a heart thing not a head thing seen a lot of people a lot of head knowledge but no heart what God choose the heart right man chooses the Mind Satan choose the mind right every time that's right to Revelations 1 ver8 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty so the day of Pentecost started on 0 in 830 some 50 days after Jesus left the Earth and that was the alpha church but now the real first church age began in ad 53 so that was from 30 to 53 you got 23 some odd years because remember listen Peter there was no spokesman on the day there was a spokesman on the day of Pentecost called Peter right but he wasn't the messenger to the church age right he wasn't the star he had a message he had a part but he wasn't a star so if that happened in the alpha church that's got to happen in the Omega Church so how did our Prophet come on the scene I've said many times before if brother Brandon would have just come right straight out of uh remember he was a Baptist right heet had come straight out of the Baptist and started preaching the Baptist Doctrine or even come out of Wesley or or Luther or somewhere but he came out of the move of the day right Paul came out of the move of the day which was the Pentecostal blessing that was there in ad30 so brother random comes on the scene after that Pentecostal blessing of 1906 isza Street which is the Omega Church he got to start like the alpha Church did and then the seventh Church age begins somewhat after that all right everybody with me this is going to help you in the end when we get down to the to the end of this thing because the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation had to begin the same way as it end end or it's not Alpha and Omega it's not your book ends all right so the age of Pentecost was ad30 the messenger was the Holy Ghost himself Acts 2 verse1 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting God for an experience like that and they appeared under them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the what not as the spokesman gave them utterance as the spirit capital S gave them utterance all right everybody with me so the age of Pentecost 1906 zza Street they had a spokesperson daddy Seymour and all the different ones param and all the ones that were the spokesman but brother R tells us right here in CR questions and answers he said then the next Age come the Lutheran the reform age there went the wives with the cunningness of man if you notice man went forth with that and when he did he added his own shrewdness that's what married him into the other part see if he just stayed with God's wisdom just reforming and pulling out but what did he do after that man that had the message Luther after the death of Luther they had a Lutheran organization Luther didn't organize it the people after him did after the death of Wesley they had a Methodist organization which started afterwards and if Wesley would come back to now and see what the Methodist Church has become he' tear it all to pieces amen now I want you to notice this now someone might ask about the Pentecostal which was the third age now brother R's not confused is everybody with me the third age is pergamus but he's talking about Luther's justification Wesley was sanctification and the third age or stage the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a messenger sent all right you see each one of these ages on only took a dip in the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age so there was no Messenger to the age of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came himself because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age as it was always ends up the other ones where Paul Come Paul didn't come at the end of the Ephesian age or he would have he missed his message and his people right he came at the end of the Pentecostal age met up with Peter and all the different ones you come over here to this side at the end of the Pentecostal age brother brandham comes on the scene or Elijah comes on the scene and brings a message all right he's the messenger to Lea not to the Pentecostal I'll prove it to you here in just a minute so look and we find there then that the messenger sent all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their place like that then the Rapture comes for the church so Peter was a spokesperson as was param and as was the oneeyed black man um daddy Seymour and they had the key to open the door to the Gentiles until Paul came on the scene the Pentecostals brought the gifts back into the church so then see brother Ram could step out on that platform cuz he was a he was restoring the gifts yes they had already started but they were still trying to Arians they were still um um baptized in father son Holy Ghost they still had their Scruples all right well see they might have had that in the first age too because they read him just a little bit but when Paul comes on the scene Paul says hey you know quit that stuff you can't be say it's ain't lawful for you to be married to your mother-in-law that's in the Bible if y'all didn't know that Peter was a spokesperson and had the key to open the door to the Gentiles until Paul came on the scene so did the Pentecostal age until brother brandham comes on the scene 1947 the first message he preaches is Faith so God comes on the scene in a powerful powerful way preaching Faith all right everybody with me he was Alpha and Omega and of course all in between now see we can't discount the Holy Ghost was in every age but they had a dip into the Holy Ghost it wasn't all of it you they had the Holy Ghost opened that part back there and it also opened this part up here right Alpha and Omega but then it took a prophet to come at the end of that Pentecostal age and declare Pentecost loved him when he was doing the signs and the Wonders come on some of you were sitting there wanted to see them signs and wonders wanted to see that calling out and telling people and and you know cancer falling off and all that but when brother R stood and said you Pentecostals are wrong the initial evidence is not speaking in tongues out the door he went but he couldn't say anything different than what God told him to say neither could Paul they were yielded Paul was a prisoner to Christ brother Brandon was a prisoner to Christ oh he could have been a millionaire he could have had the biggest church ever was if he' had compromised just a little bit oh yeah but praise God he didn't praise God he stood out yes and got away from all that he came out of her my people that's right and be not be partakers of her plagued but he specifically said Alpha and Omega had a rainbow over his head which is Covenant now if you notice the light of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out right so when Paul comes on the scene the Pentecost was gradually smothering out they were and I'll read it here in just a minute what Paul talks about it then you say brother Brown the same way right what do he tell them he said Stay Together stay one yeah stay one no he said now now you're Church of God Church of God of Jesus Christ uh you know Jehovah's Witness you're you're now Church of Christ and Church of God and church of this and Church of that and First United Pentecostal they just start splitting up that's not God God don't split up Satan splits and divides right so let's read this to the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayth he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand I want listen I don't go by feelings but that gives me culture to know that God's going to get this and he's got it handled he brought the people it's not for us to question who brother Brandon was he was the messenger that God used to bring himself to you yes sir I said himself not William brand himself Christ yes sir to you and what to get it right right they didn't have it right we have it right yes sir we have information amen that nobody else had and what do we do with it sometimes we use it in the wrong way Amen to the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand he's going to have it he's going to have a church yes whether we want one or not who walketh in the midst of the seven golden counter sticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience he's giving them some some admonition and how they can't not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and have found them Liars people like sthus and different ones the discernment even Anan and Safar we were talking about last night that was a discernment and brother Brown said if that discernment was in that age it's going to be in our age where you sit in a congregation you got sin in your life God called it out if you don't repent you'll die I'm just telling you what brother L said I read it to you last night at ananas and Safar is coming right back into the church to do what clean up the church praise God God can't move in an unclean church we either get it right remember scripture tells us that there'll be a time when the sinner can't sit in the congregation of the righteous it's hard to do it now you see them fetting like crazy but what about when your sin's called out from the pull pit oh you'll hate somebody then we'll look at Paul Paul turns around he looked at that that person followed Paul around who was it some one of them followed him around the whole time finally after about 10 days he said thou vile Spirit get out of here right has borne and has patience and for my name has labored and hasth not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love that was a question last night someone asked what does it mean by left your First Love well you become cold indifferent formal lovers are pleasure more than lovers of God even under the power of the Holy Ghost we can backslide hello somebody even under the power of the Holy Ghost you can backslide cuz we do all the time I hate to announce that but if I need to it again we backslide remember therefore from when thou art Fallen so remember what the prophet said and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto the quickly and will remove that Candlestick out of its place you see how horrible that is if God pulls that Candlestick up he's cut the Holy Ghost off from you that's right cuz that's what that oil means is the holy ghost coming up into each Candlestick and he said if you don't repent I'm pulling your Candlestick out H except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate and we know Deeds are undertaking or an act and letin niik means Victory or conquer that's where the word Nike comes from on your shoes and lean means members are Ley so Satan come in to conquer the leoty God was trying to free the leoty so God comes in and conquers the Ley brings in an idea contrary to God right and that's where you get denominations or you get hirings like balam was bam was a hiring prophet he got paid to do what he did that's right against God right Peter left it alone he'd have been all right but what do you do he said I can only say What God Says but I know how to get them oh he got them to mingling what do you do he got to mingling in the world just like just like the just like people in the pull pits brother R said what's the problem weak pull pits amen we pull pets I mean the Baptist don't tell you you need to dress right like you all are sitting here today they a I don't think there's a Baptist Church that that preaches holding this anymore Methodist sure don't lutherans don't care if you're woman male or female or whatever preaching you see how it went that's why this age is the darkest age because God said I've give you everything you need and you turn it down yes sir amen right you have more than just this for Access absolutely you have 1100 Ser well not my this watch but the other you got 1100 sermons on your arm right now if you got an Apple Watch you can you can got a quote for that but what have we done with it where's the life where's the consecrated life that we we need to get back to that why we've lost our first love we come to we come to the church and and we get all revelated and we don't have to live it no that's not true they seem to have held that it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to Idols in other words they brought a Doctrine in that was different than what God had said and then what they done was is they said oh you can't understand this okay Catholics did I see all the different they said you can't understand this so we'll just read it to you in Latin and you just do this and we'll do the incense and we'll do the what no Venus and then we'll do the confession box we'll come to find out that you were confessing to a priest that was a pedophile that's exactly right it's what you get when you turn away from the word of God listen they say Peter was the first pope right ain't that right they say Peter he had a wife he had a wife but the Catholic Church going to be so holy till they told the priest no you don't don't have no wife well you see what it turned out to be right so praise God for the truth praise God for the truth right till the alpha church is born Jesus tells them said it's not for you to know the times or seasons in other words they said when you going to restore this when you going to do that see that's the same way with brother brandom cuz even brother randam I don't say he got caught up in anything but he did get he did get caught up in there there's a Rapture coming I know I'm preaching something that's going to bring the Rapture all right right any day now then when the seals open he thought he had preached everything but he had just started his ministry so he comes into a New and Living Way called the seals ybody with me on that but he thought he preached everything spoke words we seed he said God I've got my own the Lim I preached everything you told me to preach he said oh don't worry God said no don't worry Malachi 4 has not been even fulfilled yet Malachi 4 all you've done is the first part you restored them back to the alpha bride but now you got to take this group of people and take them to a body change what one of the questions last night was what is rapturing faith we didn't get to that but maybe get to it next time maybe let Bob explain it for him two months I I want y'all to start helping me a little bit so we'll talk about it but but I I don't like talking all the time I know that's hard for y'all to understand gosh we do make mistakes up here I got a little quote here says you will learn nothing from life if you think you're right all the time please help me with that that's right please help me with that you will learn nothing from life if you think you're right all the time I am not right all the time but I know one it is God's right and all we got to do is put our let the sufficiency be on him bringing it to us through the fivefold ministry not just one person we're a team we're we're we're we don't we have different like Matthew Mark Luke and John was a different view of the same thing but yet it was the Eternal Word of God even though Mark or one of them left out one man right one saw two Blind Men one saw one blind man it was the same scenario right but it was the same what Essence our ministers here in this church I believe we have the same essence of this message that we can bring it in a way that that this one can help more than this one can and I praise God for that yes sir amen Lord I'll give the Lord cuz it takes a fivefold Ministry it's not one person and I'll promise you I really really don't like to talk that much at night while I'm asleep Michael's going bless you buddy love you acts 1 ver7 Jesus is telling them said look it's not for you to know all that times and seasons and stuff just hang on Amen the father's going to bring you power amen but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you in other words there's going to be a transition period here there's going to be a dispensational change from the Old Testament cuz right here he's fixing to go home he's already conquered death he's already in a glorified body he's already part of the New Testament yes he is right then but still they didn't none of them get saved while he was going up right right but they sure got saved when he came down 120 of them amen but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria uttermost parts of the earth then we know a cloud received him up out of sight and we know that the cloud he came back in a cloud to get us this same Jesus which you see is taken into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven the only problem man has is they're looking for the physical Jesus man right all when we see him in the cloud of Glory when the Skies open up Bible tells us that the Eastern Sky opens up and he's coming down you know what that's what they were looking for the Messiah because they were listen they were persecuted by Romans the Jews in Jerusalem were not free people right they had to do what Rome said and they were expecting the Messiah to come in and just go and there goes all the Romans right the only time that's going to happen is when we go into the new city a won't be no Romans falling us into that new city I promise you that but even in the Millennium the devil's still alive when he's dead I'll be real happy ecstatic right well some of y'all must like him CU don't I wouldn't go if I was y'all I wouldn't go to his funeral I promise you that I'm just glad when he dies and goes into that Lake of Fire cuz he's tormented all of us too long but we have a promise with our children that we'll be there with them all right Luke 24:46 says thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tar you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and then we know the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and that was the father's throne coming into being where you and I now that there we are we are there heirs and Joint HS with Christ but remember he's not sitting on his throne now this is important right he's sitting on the father's Throne which is the Holy Ghost which is the intercessor for me and you we need an intercessor yes sir even though we are Christians we still need an intercessor we still need to say God forgive me of what I just did and think listen thank God he gave you the attitude to do that most don't the word I'm sorry doesn't connect to people in the world anymore it's all your fault but when the day of Pentecost come listen they knew that there was a power that came to them that even with Jesus there and even with I was watching um or listening no watching brother bis was telling his um testimony years ago like in the '90s at some camp meeting and it came up on YouTube and I was watching it and and you know he's talking about that picture that's in there that where brother brandham they took a picture and of him at the campfire he said brother brandham was set up against a tree and go to sleep take like brother Bisal said I'll take the first you know four or five hours you sleep rest and then you get up and I'll sleep he said when brother R got up wasn't there wasn't no shouting there wasn't no praising God there wasn't even he said probably wasn't even Bible around nowhere but when brother random comes up and you see that picture in there where he's he's you know stoking the fire brother bisco said he went over and sat down against the same tree and he said there was a power came upon him he'd never felt in his life just the presence of that man just the presence to be sitting there in the same place he sat you know what that man's gone now but that presence is not that's right listen let me tell you something about the prophet of God you you give me about two minutes to tell you what's going on here he always listen the Shak Glory was never seen because remember in the Old Testament if you saw the Shak glory and you weren't right you died no if hands or buts no intercessor you passed away right now where is that light now we have a prophet in the end time and listen that Shak kind of Glory didn't wasn't in one wasn't in wasn't in Jeffersonville it was with the prophet he' go to Derman South Africa and he say don't you see that light come on he go to Italy don't you see that light he go to Germany don't you see that light that was a shic the glory of God following the prophet making sure that he preached the right doctrine that he serve the people like he's supposed to God listen when you got God when God got you in his hand Satan can't pull you out amen but that thing followed him everywhere he went he said can't you see that light 1950 they took a picture of that light that was the same listen if we believe in one God that's the same Angel The Covenant brother R said the same one that was in the pillar of fire the same one that was in the Shak Glory was now following a prophet around well you know what that your kind of Glory is not in the grave in Jeffersonville it's right here today if you'll accept it and believe it when you walk in the door you say can't you see that light oh I don't believe that I I don't I believe that just that went away with brother Brandon well you're lost amen you're lost that didn't go away you can't diminish God to me now it's in Ministry all over the country it said ministers all over the world that same Shak kind of Glory even being photographed from different places around but it's the same one same one Moses dealt with same one brother Brown dealt with same one me and you going to deal with and I pray this is kind of glories over all of us to keep this thing right to keep us Sanctified and and to keep us preaching the message of the hour the way it's supposed to be and make brother Brandon proud now you know what make God proud but I'd like to make brother R proud he give his heart and life for this and died for this sorry about [Music] that so the way that Pentecost came then is the way it's come now we had an isua Street Pentecost I'll get to it in just a minute I got to flip through some of this stuff that day of Pentecost there was a sound of a a mighty Russian wind and and they spoke in other tongues and and remember they it was the hearing they heard him in other languages well now when you come over to the zeusa street it brought that GI those gifts back all right but it didn't take them all the way as brother Ram says many times he said it didn't bring them all the way out it didn't take them completely out they was still a piece left because listen God's not going to bring and and anoint a father Holy Ghost Doctrine he can't he can't anoint a false Doctrine so when he comes out that false Doctrine got to stay there that's why the Bible says come out of her my people this is kind of the some of the things that happened on the de on on through Pentecost if you would read the book of Acts that is the Acts of the Apostles is how they acted and they contined steadfast in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship ship see they didn't have a problem with Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists all right you know all the there there's a lot of people that don't take communion anymore in the message because they said Jesus said do this till I come so in 1963 they say he came well it's real strange that brother randam last night I read a quote from what the message communion he took communion in 1965 if he would have thought it was done in' 63 he'd have said no we ain't got to do this no more no them ordinances we still got do I love doing them if you're scared of them then get the Holy Ghost but they continue steadfast in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayer and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together and had all things common sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continually daily with one ACC corn in the temple and breaking bread they went to church breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such you should be saved act 3:4 it says Peter fast his eyes upon him talking about the man that gate beautiful says look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them in other words he was expecting Peter to bring him a little little gift you know well he brought him a gift all right but it wasn't one this man i' had ever seen in his life then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength we saw that even in brother bram's Ministry remember the little boy that came on the platform I can't remember what country he's from but his feet were bowed in and and all that and club fooot and then all of a sudden he prayed for them and they were straight right well miracles must not excite y'all I tell you if you're not getting used to them you'll be scared of them am he said they had all things common is it common for us to see Miracles or are we scared of God we are we scared of somebody to discern my life your life right do we not show up for church one day if we have a prophet in bring a prophet in here well anyway see that's what I mean though we got to keep Church clean cuz one unconfessed sin right can cause the whole church to bitterly fail bitterly fail brother R said we still believe it was a prophet right okay all right but listen he put gifts in the church to do what keep the church clean right and when brother Bob gets on to y'all about certain things when I do it when brother Lis and with brother Aaron it's God trying to get us straight now right absolutely you remember one time who was it one of the prophets he said God have turned me down God said no they're not turning you down they're turning me down if they preach the word of God if this vessel up here preaches the word of God you're not turning me down you're turning God down that's what happened ananas and Safar they didn't believe that those men were so full of the Holy Ghost that if they lied made a little bit of they could get by with it right they messed up bad they lost their life because of it all right now watch this and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servant that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and fake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believe were of one heart and one Soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with power great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all now if that was the alpha Church were the Omega Church acts 5 and by the hand of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch That's the temple if y'all didn't know that and of the rest D no man join himself to them there some scared people but the people magnified them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the street and laid them in beds and couches that it least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them they came also a multitude out of the city round about to Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they they were healed everyone see brother Brown started that way healing campaign but when Peter and him got up and started preaching the word what happened to Steven Steven told them who they were and he died first martyr he stood up in church and preached him a sermon and they were the Bible say they were cut at their heart in other words they were going to kill that guy and they did am then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses he right here Steven and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul this is f Saul Paul's first appearance in the scripture he was persecuting or or he was consenting that they persecute Christians I've said many times before we would not have picked all the people in the Bible that God picked we would not look at all of them and you're like no if I want to pick that one or not David all the different ones acts 8 verse4 therefore they all scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word of God then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto him now remember the Bible said brother R calls Philip a deacon and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voices came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with py that were lame they were healed and there was great joy in that city is there great joy in your city of what you're doing God help us all acts 8 ver9 but there was a certain man called Simon who beforehand in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God now this was a sorcerer right but he was fixing to meet the real God through a group of people and to him they had regard because that of long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries but when they believe philli preaching the things concer listen they didn't have a Bible they have an MP3 they believe what Philip told them cuz there was a connection there but when they believe Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and he was baptized he just didn't go on he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which they were done now when the apostles were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost Now look for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they that were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost ghost and when Simon saw that through laying on the apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered him money he wanted to buy his way in don't ever try to buy your way in if he had just stayed with the move of God he'd got the Holy Ghost I believe acts 8 ver 26 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip say arise go toward the South into a way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza which is Desert now we know what this was we know this is an Ethiopian unic that was sitting on his Carriage reading the Bible reading the Old Testament and sitting in his Chariot read Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip go near reason I'm reading this is I'm telling you this is the Acts of the Apostles in the alpha Church age this should be the Acts of the Apostles in the Omega Church age then the spirit said unto Philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understandeth thou what thou readest and he said how can I except son man guide me now he didn't read that he needed to listen to Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher and evangelist God was revealing through him to him that he needed somebody to tell him what was going on and he sent Philip to tell him and he desired Philip that he would come and sit with him the place of the scripture which you read was he was in other words Isaiah 53 right so the unic answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh this prophet of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus listen if Philip had not known Jesus right he couldn't have preached that message do you know Jesus today do you know Jesus enough you could tell somebody about him and they want to be baptized we all short and as they went on their way they came into a certain water and the unit said see here is water what does hinder me to be baptized and and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down in the water and Philip and the unic and he baptized him and when they came up something happened Phillip got put in the transport room and got transferred a couple hundred miles to the next meeting Alpha Church Omega Church we get in the car and go now Philip was needed somewhere else so God sent him just teleported him over to another place talk about a body change that was temporary but he took one and he went on his way rejoicing but Philip was found in aotus aotus which was several hundred miles away and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to cesaria so now we know one thing for sure Paul was the messenger to the Ephesian Church age it started in ad 53 after that Pentecostal age started Paul comes on the scene rebukes the previous people from Pentecost all right then he brings his message and his message began in 853 when he set up Ephesus the church at Ephesus and then he brought his message now remember Paul died in ad. 65 or 66 so he didn't live hardly any part through that church age but the message was so powerful are we getting this the message was so powerful that a group of people picked that message up and they swept it on to the next Church age we're going to sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Hall so Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date 8 8 53 is what brother BR says let's continue let me skip through here just for a second now watch this nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love this is God telling John the Revelator to write this down and send it to the church this is what's going to happen to you Matthew 7:15 Jesus had already told him he said look beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves Matthew 10 verse 16 Jesus said behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves the key given un to me to the Lord this is Brother Ry we'll we'll stop here and pick it up this afternoon had got to Paul yet but we'll get to him it's the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is here it is an unchangeable god with unchangeable ways what he did at the first he'll have to keep keep doing until it's done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Ghost how Holy Spirit how the first original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her the word can't change or be changed because it's the word of God thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard all right there's your that's standard over there on the side of the picture we showed you all right that is the pattern there's no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age closes that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern now what happened after that though they got away from the original word pattern that's why that the messenger over here of Elijah had to what restore the faith of the fathers restore what was in the first church age now don't get LED astray here when I said that God and his ways never changeed I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't God so she can change but what I said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that is how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and The Messengers to the church having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do you have to work from the original as like begs like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first messenger of the first church age it's that simple and that wonderful why brother Brown when he got occur of time he didn't say did irenius make it he didn't say did Luther make it he said Paul make it angel said yeah Paul made it he said well if Paul made it then I'll make it cuz I preached exactly what Paul preached remember all the whole host of Heaven said we're resting on that and today we're resting on that that we are not just a church we're the bride we have the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and let me let me let you in on a little secret as your bride is your bride and you share secrets and you share things that that you don't share with anybody else you you love each other more than anybody else everybody with me God does the same thing he's going to take care of his wife he gave his life for us why don't we just give a piece of it back to him just a piece of it back to him let's stand our feet let's just give a piece to him all right listen he knows we have to work he knows we get tired he knows that he knew it before the foundation of the world but I'll promise you he made Provisions for all that right he left no one wanting anything if the want is toward him amen but if we decide to interject our own feelings into it or or whatever then that's not God this his first church age messenger look how he started out as for Saul he made Havoc of the church entered in every house and hailing men and women committing them to prison he hated this move of God called Christianity hated it but God said oh wait a minute I there's something in you there's something in you I'm going to use I say to each and every one of you I hope God finds something in each and every one of you to use whether you feel insignificant or you feel like you're not this or not that if you're here today God's got something for you God's got something for you but you know what he's not going to shove it down your throat that's one thing God won't do he will not shove it down your throat he will give it to you hand it to you and say here it is and you got to accept it I pray that we all accept all the parts of life if you're already Born Again accept the other part the manifestation of gifts and wisdom and knowledge and all those different things are are even speaking in tongues and the different things I would to God that we have that in order because it's part of the church all right it's not some fanaticism if it's done right is everybody with Meen okay let's sing a song
