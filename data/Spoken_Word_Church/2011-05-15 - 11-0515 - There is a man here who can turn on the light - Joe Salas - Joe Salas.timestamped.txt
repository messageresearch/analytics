[0:05] today we want to talk about lies uh last
[0:08] two nursing homes we went we talked
[0:11] about life but today I'm just going to
[0:13] turn it up a little bit
[0:15] more
[0:19] uh one one time this this brother went
[0:21] with us and he told
[0:24] them he said uh each Christian that's
[0:27] born in Christ is born in b and God's
[0:30] house our house fores everybody that
[0:34] mean we go there to not try to confuse
[0:38] them or TR try to bring them into the
[0:40] message we try
[0:42] to just lead them to the Lord so I think
[0:46] what he said went about
[0:54] the see the first letter that was ever
[0:57] given on Earth was God God spoken word
[0:59] he he said let there be light and there
[1:01] was light that turned the darkness into
[1:03] light okay let's do uh Genesis
[1:08] 1 1 through
[1:16] 5 in the beginning God created the
[1:19] heavens and the Earth and the Earth was
[1:21] without form and void and darkness was
[1:25] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:28] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:31] and God said there God said let there be
[1:34] light and there was light and God saw
[1:37] that the light that it was good and God
[1:40] divided the light from the darkness and
[1:43] God called the light day and the
[1:45] Darkness he called night and the evening
[1:48] and the morning were the first day
[1:50] Genesis
[1:53] 1116 and God made two great lights the
[1:56] greater light to Rule the Day and the
[1:58] Lesser light to rule the night he made
[2:02] the Stars
[2:03] also 1 John 1 1
[2:09] 15-7 this then is the message we have
[2:12] heard of him and declare unto you that
[2:14] God is
[2:18] light remember that part God
[2:21] is and in him is not Darkness at
[2:25] all if we say that we have fellowship
[2:28] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[2:31] do not the truth do not and do not the
[2:35] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[2:38] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[2:40] with another and the blood of Jesus
[2:42] Christ his son cleans us from all
[2:46] sin John
[2:49] 12:35 and Jesus said unto them yet a
[2:51] little while as the light leave you walk
[2:54] while you have the light that darkness
[2:56] comes upon you for he that walk walth in
[3:00] the darkness knoweth not whether he
[3:03] goes John 8:12 then Jesus again unto
[3:08] them saying I am the light of the world
[3:12] he that follow me shall not walk in
[3:14] darkness but shall have the light of
[3:28] life
[3:36] the message uh rising of the sun brother
[3:39] said now the Sun at the rising of the
[3:42] sun well there was a time when the world
[3:44] was laying in utter Darkness it was
[3:47] without form and it was void and it was
[3:50] all covered with water and was there and
[3:52] there in the dark this one gloomy
[3:55] atmosphere and the spirit of God moved
[3:57] upon the water and said let there be
[4:01] life he said God had a reason to do that
[4:04] for down beneath that water there was
[4:06] seeds that he had planted and he had to
[4:08] add the sunlight to make it l just like
[4:11] when you plant your tomato in it light
[4:14] so nothing grows onless we had
[4:20] light and the first light was ever given
[4:22] to Earth with God's spoken word the
[4:25] first light that ever struck the Earth
[4:27] was God's spoken word he said let let
[4:29] there be light and there was light that
[4:31] turned Darkness into light in order to
[4:34] bring forth that creation of joy and
[4:37] life upon the earth and the spirit of
[4:40] God as he moved with love and compassion
[4:42] at that great day the first day of the
[4:45] dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun
[4:48] Rose and swept the cross this raised and
[4:51] dried up the water from the earth and
[4:54] made an atmosphere above and for its
[4:57] first time it was to bring joy and life
[4:59] to the Earth by a seed that was a great
[5:03] power but all it wasn't nothing that
[5:06] Sunrise like the sunrise on the Easter
[5:09] morning this time with the sun leaping
[5:11] into the skies it brought forth the
[5:13] greater Sunrise than ever because it
[5:17] came greater news with the sunrise than
[5:19] it did with the sunrise at the beginning
[5:22] this Sunrise brought a news that he is
[5:24] risen he is quickened from the dead ahe
[5:27] he promised he has risen from the dead
[5:30] the first time the sun rose in Genesis
[5:32] it was bringing a message that there
[5:34] will be life upon the Earth Immortal
[5:36] Life but this time when the sun rose
[5:39] there was a du Sunrise another sunrising
[5:43] it was not only the
[5:45] Su Rising but it was the s o n had risen
[5:48] to bring eternal life to All God's
[5:51] promise see that for knowledge he had
[5:55] seen laying upon the Earth no more could
[5:58] the B live back there at the beginning
[6:01] without the sun to bring it to life no
[6:04] more than today when sons of God is upon
[6:07] the Earth it takes the S so life to
[6:09] bring them to eternal life his chosen
[6:12] ones that he knew before the foundation
[6:15] of the world he had chosen them in
[6:17] himself before the foundation of the
[6:28] world
[6:47] you can read Jeremiah
[6:51] 3135 think
[6:54] fast might need to give us a minute to
[6:56] look
[6:58] up yeah let read before I forget
[7:02] Jeremiah Jeremiah
[7:17] 31:35 there's
[7:23] man it's Jeremiah
[7:25] 31:35 thus say the Lord which giveth the
[7:28] son for light by day and the ordinance
[7:31] of the moon and the stars for our light
[7:34] by night which divided the sea when the
[7:37] waves thereof Roar the Lord of The Lord
[7:41] of host is his
[7:58] name read
[8:02] psalms you don't have to go through if
[8:04] you want Psalms 119 105 Thy word is a
[8:08] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[8:10] path Psalms
[8:13] 271 the Lord is my light of my salvation
[8:16] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[8:18] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[8:20] afraid
[8:28] of
[8:34] now some men like Darkness better than
[8:36] they do light but I like what Joshua
[8:38] said
[8:41] Joshua
[8:47] 24:15 and if it seem evil unto you to
[8:50] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[8:52] you will serve whether the
[8:55] gods give you guys enough
[8:58] time
[9:01] like the guy preach over here
[9:03] last just rattle it on choose you this
[9:08] day who we will serve whether the gods
[9:10] with your father serve that were on the
[9:12] other side of the flood or the gods of
[9:14] the amorites in whose land you dwell but
[9:17] as for me and my house we will serve the
[9:28] Lord
[9:33] a tile okay in the message uh there's a
[9:37] man here that can turn on the light if
[9:39] if you want to Le about light has a lot
[9:41] of stuff about light
[9:45] this now when you see his word being
[9:48] Vindicated other words may known prove
[9:51] that that is a light the light of his
[9:54] spoken word and without light light
[9:57] nothing can live without light there is
[10:00] no life upon the Earth today but what
[10:03] has to come but the light of the Sun in
[10:06] B life and so forth and there's no
[10:09] eternal life outside of the sign of God
[10:12] see he is the
[10:23] light same message and that's the way
[10:26] God has today his seed is already here
[10:28] his word
[10:29] the only thing you need is light on
[10:32] it he is that light for he is the word
[10:35] the word and the light is the same thing
[10:38] the light in there is the light of the
[10:41] of the word is the light The Germ of
[10:45] Life lays within the Grain and the grain
[10:47] is the life is what breaks forth and
[10:49] brings forth the light of the grain
[10:52] that's the way that that's the way that
[10:55] Christ and the world makes the world do
[10:57] what it's supposed to do
[10:59] just like the life and the grain of
[11:02] wheat or whatever it is it makes it we
[11:05] do what it's supposed to do because it
[11:07] is the life that's in
[11:13] it and spiritual life eternal life can
[11:16] only come by God's Spoken Word of Life
[11:18] Light was the es this time in him is
[11:22] light and in him is not darkness and he
[11:26] is God spoken spoken light
[11:30] th God spoken a word for in the
[11:32] beginning was the word and the Word was
[11:34] with God and the Word was God and it's
[11:37] forever God see it takes the light of
[11:39] God to strike the work to make it live
[11:42] here's what he spoke now let the light
[11:45] shine that the Light Shine the Light
[11:48] will bring every word to his
[11:50] right right position in It
[11:57] season
[12:04] now in all ages has set forth so much of
[12:06] his word for each age God always sends
[12:09] somebody that can that their word can
[12:12] get into and show the light of it that
[12:14] in every age it does the same thing it
[12:17] always does
[12:22] that John John the Baptist came to
[12:25] introduce the
[12:26] light that's why uh told Brother
[12:30] brma as John the Baptist came to
[12:33] introduce the first coming of the light
[12:35] your your message will pour on the
[12:37] second coming of the
[12:44] light not only did he say I'm the light
[12:47] but he say you are the light if his word
[12:50] is in you bearing record of itself then
[12:53] you are the light you are the light of
[12:55] the
[12:56] world that at the end we going to be
[12:59] down light that this world will ever
[13:27] see no no Noah Noah was the light for
[13:31] his day he light so was Noah the light
[13:34] in his day he was the light Noah was
[13:37] that light he was a light to what to
[13:40] make God's word I will destroy man upon
[13:44] the Earth that I created build an ark
[13:47] and all desires to come into it will be
[13:51] saved Noah walked out there and said
[13:53] there's one there's one way and that's
[13:56] an ark they said that old crazy fanatic
[13:59] he was a word made manifest Noah was the
[14:02] light of the hour sure was in his day
[14:06] his AG his age he sprung forth light and
[14:11] Moses was the light of his of his
[14:13] hour I'll surely visit you God said to
[14:16] Abraham I'll come down and I'll take out
[14:18] of the people with a strong hand and
[14:22] I'll show my power in Egypt and when
[14:24] Moses up there met that burning bush up
[14:27] there and found out that I am was in the
[14:29] Bush Moses went down there and he was a
[14:32] light no wonder he could take some dust
[14:35] and blow it up out up and say Let There
[14:38] come fleas upon the Earth he had the
[14:41] word of God what happened the dust began
[14:44] to blow and flee began to come into
[14:47] existence why he was manifestation he
[14:50] was the manifestation of the light of
[14:52] God's word of plag Egypt he was a
[14:55] prophet what he said had had to come
[14:59] he was a light of that day he was God's
[15:02] light now Pharaoh might had everything
[15:04] he wanted to have and the rest of them
[15:07] all the priests had what they wanted but
[15:09] Moses was the
[15:11] light while he was shown from forth

[15:16] bring them out under a strong hand I'll
[15:19] get myself Glory that's what that's what
[15:23] he was doing that's the reason Moses
[15:25] proved that he could create not because
[15:27] he wanted to create
[15:29] because God told him
[15:30] to now go to the congregation
[15:34] tomorrow the Lord God has just spoke to
[15:36] me take a handful of dust and throw it
[15:39] up in the sky like this and call for it

[22:09] happening uh in in the world this year
[22:12] whatever you know tsunamis earthquakes
[22:15] uh tornadoes
[22:17] floods uh I think when the tornado
[22:21] tornadoes hit it was like 250 tornadoes
[22:24] and uh 350 people died or more
[22:30] so and the floods kind of reminds me of
[22:33] that that's brother talk about the in
[22:36] storm you know I've seen pictures of the
[22:39] floods where the water on the on the top
[22:42] of the top of the houses you know and he
[22:45] preached that uh message on the incoming
[22:47] Stone where he talks about that chicken
[22:50] farmer that they came and gave him a
[22:53] warning he said there's a big storm
[22:55] coming six shelter and he said nonsense
[22:59] they always talk about that but it never
[23:00] happened so he said well at least let
[23:02] your wife go and he said no he said I'm
[23:06] the head of the house no you know she's
[23:11] not when that storm came the water got
[23:14] top of the buildings and they when they
[23:17] came back they found the the lady and
[23:19] the kids all bidden by snakes because
[23:22] the water Rose and the snakes everybody
[23:25] went up there too and that man they
[23:26] never been find I guess they didn't find
[23:28] these chickens either I don't
[23:38] know now what what is Darkness an
[23:40] absence of light you
[23:56] know have you ever been in an area that
[23:59] flooded like that and actually seen seen
[24:03] no but uh when they hit them tornadoes I
[24:06] went towards naan and there's this
[24:09] tornado came in down on 75 right we saw
[24:12] that and they cut the trees look like
[24:15] tcks and then went across the road and
[24:17] they Bend all that railing and stuff and
[24:19] then went across the other side and did
[24:21] the same thing to the trees it look like
[24:23] toothpicks it's like a c just come down
[24:25] and takes everything and like I said
[24:28] they flip tractor trailers over and all
[24:30] kinds of stuff I lived in south Georgia
[24:33] when in '94 when they had the flood down
[24:36] there what you see on TV is nothing yeah
[24:40] compared to really actually witnessing
[24:42] it it is
[24:44] unbelievable I got up early in the
[24:46] morning that day and uh G it was little
[24:49] drizzly stuff drizzling a little bit
[24:51] when I got to Atlanta already had like
[24:53] toward towards a that way so they L
[24:56] always
[24:58] me
[25:06] right we also must be careful as the
[25:09] devil can transform himself into an
[25:11] angel of Light uh Second Corinthians
[25:15] 113
[25:23] 15 I wish I could just talk by way there
[25:26] I he just don't
[25:35] say
[25:37] I'm what was the
[25:39] scure uh 2 Corinthians 11 13-
[25:51] 15 for such are FAL Apostles deceivers
[25:55] workers transforming s and
[25:58] themselves into Apostles of Christ and
[26:00] no Marvel for Satan himself is
[26:03] transformed into an angel of Light there
[26:07] is no great thing if his Minister also
[26:09] be transformed as the Ministers of
[26:11] righteousness whose end shall be
[26:13] according to their
[26:24] works here in Acts 2618 to open their
[26:28] eyes and to turn them from Darkness to
[26:30] light and to from the power of Satan
[26:33] unto God that they may receive
[26:35] forgiveness of sins inherit among them
[26:38] which are Sanctified by faith that is in
[26:46] me Revelations uh 21
[26:56] 23-25
[27:11] and the the the moon to shine in it for
[27:15] the glory of God did lighten it and the
[27:17] lamb is the light thereof and the nation
[27:20] of them which are saved shall walk in
[27:23] the light of it and the kings of Earth
