[4:01] remember also the fellowship meeting
[4:02] will be the third saturday of march it
[4:06] will be at brother longorus
[4:08] then the fellowship meeting as far as we
[4:10] know now

[4:17] uh also brother uh vernon from the
[4:20] philippines

[4:53] dwight hall he lost his whole uh
[4:56] the church and everything got washed out
[4:57] in a a flooded area
[5:00] and he didn't have any insurance to
[5:02] replace it because of the water area
[5:05] where he was at
[5:06] so he lost everything on it lost a
[5:09] vehicle lost a lot of other things so
[5:12] you know just pray for him that the lord
[5:14] would would bless him and we'll send him
[5:16] a little offering to try to help him
[5:19] you know get him a place where they can
[5:20] do something

[5:28] remember him he said he had a busy day
[5:31] on wednesday it might be a little late i
[5:33] said okay we'll wait but not after 12.
[5:36] we'll wait on you but not after 12. okay
[5:40] but uh i reckon that's all the
[5:42] announcements anything else
[5:44] i generally miss a few somewhere down
[5:46] the road but colossians
[5:49] one and then colossians 2.
[5:53] the lord jesus we thank you for your
[5:55] grace and your love and to us we we know
[5:58] for surety that you give it to us freely
[6:00] because there's nothing in any of us
[6:02] that would be worthy of it not any
[6:05] special people as we tried to explain
[6:07] this morning there's nothing no
[6:09] different about us than anyone that's
[6:10] ever been
[6:12] but we are just the people that believe
[6:15] that your promise
[6:16] for this day
[6:18] is here being made manifest among us and
[6:21] we believe you and we love you and we
[6:23] thank you we pray that you'd bless all
[6:24] the people that are sick because you
[6:27] said you sent your word and healed us
[6:29] and delivered us from destruction so we
[6:31] believe your promises and we know for
[6:33] surety that you say your promises are
[6:35] yea and amen so how much more could it
[6:38] be that we would believe them we love
[6:40] you father and we thank you and just
[6:41] have you away with each one of us and
[6:43] keep us in thy grace and love
[6:46] in jesus name amen
[6:49] romans
[6:51] excuse me colossians one
[6:54] we'll just start with verse 15 because
[6:56] that's we know who is coming down
[6:58] talking about the
[6:59] the the kingdom the translating into the
[7:01] kingdom of his dear son
[7:03] and then we go down to verse 15 who is
[7:05] the image of the invisible god the
[7:07] firstborn of every creature for by him
[7:09] were all things created that are in
[7:11] heaven that are in earth
[7:13] visible and invisible whether they be
[7:15] thrones or dominions or principalities
[7:18] or powers
[7:19] all things were created by him and for
[7:22] him
[7:23] and he is before all things watch now
[7:26] and by him all things
[7:28] consist in other words there's nothing
[7:31] because in hebrews he's the creator john
[7:33] he's the creator
[7:34] of
[7:36] ephesians he's the creator nothing is
[7:38] created without him
[7:40] doing it because he's the creator and
[7:42] whatever we are he created us and he is
[7:45] the head of the body the church which is
[7:47] to be
[7:48] getting the firstborn from the dead
[7:50] that in all things he might have the
[7:52] preeminence for it please the father
[7:55] that in him
[7:56] should all fullness dwell now just drop
[8:00] over
[8:01] the next page and you'll notice
[8:03] we start with verse
[8:06] 2 and verse 9.
[8:10] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[8:13] the godhead bodily
[8:15] and you are complete in him
[8:18] the verse 10 which is the head of all
[8:20] principality and power you may be seated
[8:24] lord at his blessing to the reading of
[8:26] the word
[8:28] now remember this morning trying to
[8:32] get a point to us
[8:35] and as we start reading on these things
[8:37] in a minute and
[8:38] referencing to the end time
[8:41] just remember
[8:44] that
[8:45] we are trying our best to express one
[8:48] thought
[8:49] and that one thought is
[8:52] the fact that
[8:54] there is no different in each church age
[8:59] it's been the same god
[9:02] now there is a difference in
[9:04] maybe manifestation
[9:06] uh different things we will try to cover
[9:09] some things later on it because there
[9:11] are dispensations of this and
[9:13] dispensations of that you know in the
[9:15] bible and uh
[9:17] but yet remember that we're talking
[9:19] about it so when we come down to reading
[9:21] and we're talking about the fullness of
[9:23] the godhead bodily remember
[9:26] that
[9:27] the
[9:28] is in the entire
[9:31] body of christ now not just speaking of
[9:34] the end time
[9:35] it is the end time people
[9:38] who will make that manifest
[9:41] are you following me
[9:43] somebody's got to make it manifest
[9:45] jesus christ was almighty god right
[9:49] he made manifest the word
[9:52] and things of his time
[9:54] all right now he's left it for you and i
[9:57] to make it manifest and each church age
[9:59] made manifest
[10:01] what was in that age but they couldn't
[10:05] one make manifest the other age see
[10:08] backwards before but it's the same god
[10:12] so then when you talk about the fullness
[10:14] of the godhead bodily never have i
[10:16] pointed to solely the end of all things
[10:20] as us being the fullness and the rest of
[10:22] not you know
[10:23] that when you try to drive things down
[10:26] people will get the wrong idea about
[10:28] what you're trying to say
[10:30] and you know make you say something that
[10:32] you're not because uh as we'll read in a
[10:35] minute and you've
[10:36] i've read it before a prophet said
[10:39] he's not complete without you right well
[10:43] we're not complete without all the ages
[10:45] to hold us up
[10:47] that's right
[10:48] and we definitely went through the the
[10:50] uh
[10:51] uh
[10:52] carriers
[10:53] were in their place and doing what they
[10:56] needed to do
[10:57] but then we're in the age when it's not
[10:59] called carriers
[11:02] it's called the seed
[11:04] all right because it returns to the
[11:06] original
[11:08] jesus christ was not a carrier
[11:12] right he was the seed
[11:15] well see then that's what's left for the
[11:17] end time to be
[11:20] is the seed of god made manifest the
[11:22] word of god
[11:24] to finish it all up all right see then
[11:26] that way we can we can follow that point
[11:28] but remember that i put it on this
[11:30] morning put it on here i'll put it on
[11:31] the next two or three services
[11:33] because i want you to think about it
[11:37] oh you that use your internet a lot to
[11:39] study the message
[11:41] i only chose just a few
[11:44] but i wish you would run in uh you know
[11:46] the quote that is a favorite
[11:48] part a lot of times that we say
[11:51] that all god was he poured into christ
[11:53] all christ poured into the you know all
[11:56] god poured into christ all christ in the
[11:58] church
[12:00] and take her back to the garden of eden
[12:01] all right i wish you'd run that in just
[12:04] run it into your computer just read the
[12:06] things we will read some of it
[12:10] and then you know be uh moving on so
[12:13] just think about it now
[12:16] because
[12:18] we read the scriptures and we know and
[12:20] we talked about this morning as a
[12:22] background to where that we would think
[12:25] about
[12:26] what speaks of the bridegroom
[12:29] speaks of the bride
[12:31] all right you say well i just can't find
[12:33] myself
[12:34] we'll read about him and see what he's
[12:36] doing
[12:37] because it's him doing it
[12:40] justification was not martin luther
[12:45] right
[12:46] it was god revealing himself in that day
[12:50] and that hour for the word of that hour
[12:54] all right now so is it whatever ages so
[12:57] is it throughout the old testament and
[12:59] coming down see that everything is very
[13:01] vital
[13:04] to not just come down to making us
[13:06] special something
[13:09] the bride of jesus christ is the special
[13:11] something
[13:12] the entire bride
[13:14] all right see then we have dispensations
[13:17] of this and thoughts and ideas that
[13:20] we'll get back to but we we covered that
[13:22] this morning that the what spoke of the
[13:26] bridegroom spoke of the bride
[13:29] and how that she would
[13:31] she is smitten from the church
[13:33] and how that
[13:35] that is the way that he is on the
[13:37] outside of the church knocking at the
[13:40] door trying to get back in is because he
[13:42] has been driven out of the church
[13:45] the people
[13:47] the real true bride of christ is smitten
[13:50] this day from the church of of
[13:52] denominationalism
[13:55] because of her stand on the word
[13:58] and the denominationalism then whether
[14:00] or not it be
[14:01] baptist methodist presbyterian
[14:03] pentecostals catholic or
[14:05] or
[14:06] brahmites
[14:08] you know or lulaites
[14:10] see whatever it is
[14:12] you know because he is smitten from the
[14:15] church he's rejected
[14:17] by
[14:19] the majority of the people in this last
[14:22] days right
[14:23] now they want him as healer they want
[14:25] him as savior
[14:28] but they don't want him as lord and god
[14:30] of all right
[14:32] all right
[14:33] let's see then that way if he can't be
[14:34] one all
[14:36] he can't be just one
[14:38] yet he can be over there healing the
[14:40] sick he can be doing but there'll come a
[14:42] time that'll stop
[14:45] and you know when it stops then uh you
[14:48] don't want to be just in that category
[14:50] the prophet then said what
[14:52] being in the wrong ranks at the rapture
[14:56] would be no excuse
[14:59] all right
[15:00] so then what is our purpose and what did
[15:02] we end up the other day talking about
[15:04] that the seed must do what
[15:07] it must lay in the presence of the sun
[15:10] to ripen
[15:12] what if no
[15:14] what if it had been that when the
[15:16] prophet was here
[15:18] that
[15:19] even while he was here
[15:21] or shortly after he was gone that
[15:24] this was all finished up
[15:26] well the basis of what i'm looking at
[15:28] today would not be around us you a few
[15:31] people would be
[15:33] but
[15:34] you know
[15:35] we would be
[15:36] not counted into this but he's given all
[15:41] of these years
[15:43] for us to lay in the presence of the sun
[15:46] i'm not
[15:47] um down-hearted because of
[15:50] of the time
[15:52] that has come you know and that we're
[15:55] way past what it looked like
[15:57] that it should have been
[15:59] and i'm not disheartened at that and i'm
[16:01] glad god spoke to me years ago i believe
[16:03] it and reveal it because it happened
[16:05] you know and i preached that we could
[16:06] pass the year 2026 which i say now we
[16:09] could pass a year 5 000 that wouldn't
[16:12] happen because once you entered what
[16:13] happened in 1977
[16:16] then there is no limit to a time element
[16:19] it is not that it is into the opening of
[16:21] the word all right
[16:24] now
[16:25] but what i want us to do today is think
[16:27] about it
[16:29] and if we'll put everything into him
[16:31] then we can understand
[16:33] and we can still use our thought
[16:36] of what spoke of the bridegroom
[16:40] will speak of the bride
[16:42] because somebody has to make
[16:45] that manifest because the bridegroom
[16:49] is not here
[16:51] now you know what i mean by that right
[16:53] he's not physically here when he went
[16:55] away 2 000 years ago see he hasn't been
[16:59] back here physically
[17:02] since that time and we don't
[17:05] expect him to be here physically and
[17:07] brother branham said you know people
[17:08] that say they got oil on their hands and
[17:11] blood on their foreheads and all these
[17:12] different he said they're saying the
[17:14] corporal body is here
[17:18] and he says that's incorrect
[17:21] because it's not here
[17:22] see we meet him in the air
[17:25] all right he doesn't need to be here
[17:27] because he has a body
[17:29] so it would be contrary to scripture if
[17:31] he came physically
[17:33] to meet us here now it could be visions
[17:36] it could be dreams it can be uh all
[17:38] kinds of things happen
[17:41] and you say well what about brother
[17:43] branham when he was up at schoolhouse
[17:45] well just remember what he said
[17:48] and you'll still see he's right
[17:50] when he saw the lord jesus out in that
[17:52] field where he preached marriage and
[17:53] divorce you know in that schoolhouse and
[17:55] thing he said that was the very field
[17:57] that he saw him in back as a young man
[18:01] but remember he said he was standing up
[18:03] in the air
[18:06] you know
[18:07] he didn't say he was on earth he said he
[18:09] was standing up in the air
[18:10] all right so we meet the lord jesus
[18:12] physically all right
[18:15] then we're we are in the time and we
[18:18] have been
[18:19] since
[18:20] pentecost all right i keep emphasizing
[18:23] that
[18:23] we have been in the time that the body
[18:26] of jesus christ
[18:30] the bride church
[18:34] has been in his place upon the earth
[18:39] right
[18:41] and it's him making himself manifest
[18:45] in each age
[18:47] right the spirit was not eat away
[18:51] because the prophet preached a message
[18:53] there the spirit seven spirits of god he
[18:55] said it was the holy spirit never church
[18:57] age but the holy spirit can only work
[19:00] according to the amount of word
[19:02] the word was what was eaten away right
[19:06] all right and the word was what would
[19:08] have was to is now still being restored
[19:12] unto us all right
[19:14] and then that brings it down to a
[19:15] beautiful time
[19:17] see then now think about that as we talk
[19:19] about where we read that in him dwelt
[19:22] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[19:25] well now if i can read you some quotes
[19:27] from the prophet
[19:30] that that fullness
[19:32] now dwells in the bride right
[19:35] the church the bride would you believe
[19:37] it
[19:38] me
[19:40] would you accept it that way or keep
[19:41] your ideas of like one brother said no
[19:44] quote it the way he said it he said you
[19:46] you say the bride is to be the fullness
[19:48] of the god he had bodily said hogwash
[19:51] yeah
[19:52] because he didn't believe it
[19:55] well
[19:57] no i don't care what he believed
[20:00] that's his business
[20:02] but now when a prophet says things why
[20:06] can't we believe it
[20:09] if we can't believe that what he said
[20:11] about us being the fullness of the
[20:12] godhead bodily then
[20:14] we can't believe about us being the
[20:16] people of god
[20:20] remember the emphasis i've always placed
[20:21] upon it is what
[20:24] 99 god one percent human
[20:27] because all we are is a vessel
[20:30] that the god dwells in
[20:33] i've made it so strong until maybe some
[20:35] people didn't understand me whether that
[20:37] i would make it so strong as saying that
[20:40] you are god
[20:42] by having the new birth you are deity is
[20:46] that the way he'd say it you are god
[20:48] made manifest in flesh
[20:52] called a son
[20:55] all right
[20:57] is that any problem
[20:58] is that the bible is that the prophet's
[21:00] message well then why can't we believe
[21:03] that
[21:04] then it would speak of the end time of
[21:06] things to take place why cannot we
[21:09] believe that we are the people
[21:12] see we are the ones that are keeping it
[21:14] from taking place
[21:17] so don't blame nobody else
[21:19] well if we could get brother dale
[21:21] straightened up we'd be ready to go
[21:23] well that might be true
[21:26] but remember you have to get yourself
[21:28] straight first too you know so work on
[21:31] yourself
[21:32] and i'll work on myself
[21:35] and god will work on all of us
[21:36] all right
[21:37] but see in him now dwells the fullness
[21:40] of the godhead bodily
[21:42] all right so the the godhead is what
[21:44] father son and holy ghost
[21:47] all right then
[21:49] we believe in one true and living god
[21:52] we don't believe in a god in three
[21:54] persons or things like that we believe
[21:56] in one true and living god
[22:00] and we believe that oh god was
[22:06] he poured that into christ
[22:09] all
[22:10] right now
[22:13] a quick
[22:16] explanation
[22:21] when the bible speaks of saying all god
[22:24] was he poured into christ
[22:26] does that do away with god
[22:29] and you only have a christ
[22:32] because if if that's the way you're
[22:34] going then the next quote you're going
[22:35] to have to deny totally that all christ
[22:38] would be in the church then you wouldn't
[22:39] now know christ
[22:41] but we know for surety that the church
[22:44] is christ made manifest we know that
[22:46] jesus was god made manifest in human
[22:49] flesh
[22:50] all right so we don't hold that point as
[22:53] oh brother now all means all
[22:56] well then you ain't got nothing left
[22:59] well then what about the prophet would
[23:00] say
[23:01] that there'll be a message of cheer down
[23:04] to the endless ages after we leave here
[23:10] so evidently all of god
[23:13] that there is is not revealed to mankind
[23:18] evidently you know or there wouldn't be
[23:21] anything left over
[23:23] that should be a sensible statement
[23:27] no need of clarification
[23:30] that it just simply means that
[23:32] what all that is needed here
[23:36] will be might manifest here
[23:39] to give you an understanding brother
[23:41] gary
[23:42] atkins and i used to talk about this a
[23:44] lot
[23:45] you know that really when jesus said all
[23:48] power is given unto me in heaven and
[23:50] earth
[23:51] you know that was after his resurrection
[23:58] it was after his resurrection he
[24:00] read your bible
[24:02] he said no he had it all the time
[24:05] well there was certain things there that
[24:08] would give you a little problem
[24:10] like him saying that he didn't know when
[24:12] he's coming
[24:14] you know
[24:15] so i'm i'm trying to make a point
[24:20] of how that we try to make our by our
[24:22] own concept of thoughts
[24:25] we try to make something in a line that
[24:28] we can look at it
[24:30] and that's well and good but sometimes
[24:33] it'll run your ground too
[24:35] you know
[24:36] i mean it'll just run you off and you
[24:38] have to believe what god says
[24:41] you know when he says you're perfect
[24:43] we want to spend all of our life trying
[24:45] to figure out what perfect means
[24:48] right well it means is it means complete
[24:50] it means that you know
[24:53] why not just say what he said
[24:57] ever what it is that we try to clarify
[25:00] as far as he's concerned it's perfect
[25:03] right
[25:04] and as far as god is concerned using the
[25:06] word perfect wouldn't need no
[25:07] interpretation
[25:10] it would have to mean
[25:12] just as perfect as he is and that's what
[25:14] brother brown said
[25:16] he said you by the new birth
[25:19] are just as perfect as god is yes
[25:23] why
[25:24] because it's god made manifest
[25:26] is that a simple explanation
[25:30] it's god made benefit and he don't see
[25:32] our faults and failures
[25:35] he only sees our sacrifice and the
[25:37] prophet said he hears our voice through
[25:38] the blood
[25:41] well i'll just go do what i want to see
[25:42] now you prove you're lost
[25:45] come on get off the junk
[25:48] you try to make little trips and traps
[25:49] or something that you're saying and it
[25:51] shows your stupidity
[25:54] see if you think you can get by with it
[25:56] you're lost
[25:59] that's as plain as can be
[26:02] brother dale you told me it's lost
[26:05] you take your choice
[26:07] but church do you see what i'm trying to
[26:09] drive at
[26:11] he said in him
[26:12] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[26:16] so that whatever god was to be on earth
[26:21] whatever he was to manifest on earth not
[26:23] after the future we get on into the
[26:26] eternities but all that he is to make
[26:28] manifest here
[26:31] was manifest in jesus christ
[26:34] all right then if we wasn't in christ
[26:39] now how long do we need to preach on
[26:40] that if we wasn't in christ and we'll
[26:42] never make it anyway if we wouldn't part
[26:44] of that word we'd never be part of that
[26:46] word if we wouldn't die with him in the
[26:47] beginning we'll never be there
[26:50] all right we've been through all of that
[26:52] without any problems right yes
[26:55] but just remember
[26:57] it's all in him and paul sums it up in
[27:01] verse 10 of the second chapter and you
[27:04] are complete in him the word complete is
[27:06] perfect
[27:09] are finished
[27:11] and brought into completion
[27:13] and he
[27:15] is the head
[27:16] of all
[27:18] principalities and powers
[27:21] so no matter what it is he's ahead of it
[27:23] brother randomly said one day said do
[27:25] you mean he's the head of the center he
[27:26] said yes because he can destroy him
[27:29] he's not the head of him like headship
[27:33] he just can destroy him
[27:36] all right trying to get a few thoughts
[27:38] and get into the notes
[27:43] but
[27:44] compound meaning compound revelation
[27:48] so then if we can look at the bible
[27:50] through way of the prophet's message
[27:53] and see
[27:55] that that fullness
[27:58] that there's a capability of it being
[28:01] made manifest
[28:03] upon earth
[28:05] now i'm doing number six or seven again
[28:08] it's got to be in the entire body
[28:12] it's just like we do
[28:14] talking oh
[28:16] i believe the ministry of jesus christ
[28:19] is here
[28:20] today
[28:21] that's what your prophet said now you
[28:23] can argue with him
[28:24] well it was only in him well you know
[28:28] he said it was in the church so that's
[28:30] now you're arguing with him not me
[28:33] all right
[28:35] but then
[28:36] if it's here
[28:40] then why can't we confess that it's here
[28:46] she'll do us no good do not confess his
[28:48] word
[28:49] because you're not going to be saved
[28:50] unless you confess his word right
[28:52] you've got to confess your mouth believe
[28:54] in your heart or you're not going to be
[28:55] saved so then somebody start we need to
[28:58] start confessing
[29:01] what god has said about us
[29:05] but we want to look at our faults and
[29:06] our failures
[29:08] well if god was here that away
[29:11] look what we would be doing
[29:14] and like i illustrated the other day is
[29:16] you know there's getting ready to come
[29:18] out of egypt
[29:19] and moses came down there well that was
[29:21] their deliverer
[29:23] and because he came down there to
[29:25] deliver them
[29:27] the taskmasters started getting a whole
[29:29] lot worse
[29:30] it didn't get better because moses was
[29:32] there
[29:33] it got worse well then when they went
[29:36] into and moses run off 40 years
[29:39] i don't think that they said
[29:41] when he went out oh well you know they
[29:43] started making them get they wasn't
[29:44] getting their up they were supplying
[29:46] them straw et cetera to make brick and
[29:48] all and they were just stepping in the
[29:50] mud maybe or something you know and
[29:52] so he started making them go out and get
[29:53] their own straw
[29:54] well do you think when moses left the
[29:56] first time and they run him off
[29:58] hey moses is gone we'll give you straw
[30:02] i don't think so
[30:04] i think it got worse
[30:07] i think they had 40 years of the most
[30:09] horrible
[30:10] times
[30:12] until probably they said we resent the
[30:15] fact that moses even mentioned that he
[30:19] come to deliver you know
[30:23] and then they were crying out for a
[30:24] deliverer
[30:27] don't you think church it's about time
[30:29] after all that we've seen and heard to
[30:30] be crying out for an end time a
[30:32] deliverer
[30:34] i think it is
[30:36] we should have been doing that all along
[30:40] but remember obama
[30:42] is not going to take care of you
[30:45] and i don't care who comes in either him
[30:49] they're not going to take care of you
[30:51] right i i hope we're finding that out
[30:54] until we get to where we're depending
[30:56] upon god and standing up on on the
[30:59] social security check that we get you
[31:02] know and thank god for the check
[31:05] but uh what if we don't get it next
[31:08] month
[31:09] you know
[31:10] that's
[31:11] can be done away quickly
[31:13] but now so who's worried
[31:16] all right
[31:17] it may be right what the prophet said
[31:19] that
[31:20] we would be physically bereft
[31:23] it may be right where he said that we'd
[31:25] be at the mercy of the elements
[31:27] it may be right where he said we could
[31:29] be shot on the spot for praying for the
[31:30] sick
[31:32] it uh may be coming down
[31:36] what but who worries
[31:39] well it scared me to death brother if
[31:41] you talk about well that means you're
[31:43] not ready
[31:45] okay
[31:46] we got that soft
[31:48] now do something about it
[31:50] okay forgive me
[31:52] all right now let's get started
[31:54] do you believe in compound revelation
[31:58] and compound meaning
[32:00] you know that what speaks of the
[32:02] bridegroom speaks of the bride
[32:05] all right
[32:06] then
[32:07] let's go into some thoughts on something
[32:10] and i may not
[32:11] uh get but just a little bit into this
[32:14] and what i've done is i've i've had
[32:17] these this morning i didn't make enough
[32:18] for everybody but anybody that wants a
[32:21] copy of the notes today
[32:23] on the uh where you can read or where
[32:26] the prophet says the things about the
[32:28] bride being the fullness of the godhead
[32:29] bodily you're perfectly welcome for
[32:32] uh to come up here and get them at the
[32:33] end of the service and uh then we
[32:36] if we need to we'll make you some more
[32:38] all right
[32:40] but i want to just think about it
[32:44] i titled this in him
[32:49] in him
[32:51] or all fullness dwelled
[32:56] in him
[32:58] then the emphasis is made upon him
[33:01] and not upon
[33:02] where it's at
[33:06] if he's the head of the church then it
[33:07] emphasizes it upon him being the head of
[33:10] the church
[33:11] all right
[33:12] and him being in charge
[33:14] all right so if we believe in compound
[33:17] meaning
[33:19] and knowing that what speaks to the
[33:21] bridegroom speaks to the bride and even
[33:23] compound revelation
[33:25] now remember that's quote this morning
[33:28] compound revelation
[33:31] okay i mean
[33:34] that's uh paragraph 56 and through 58 of
[33:37] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[33:40] and that's not just the one there's
[33:42] plenty of them compound meaning but that
[33:44] one has compound meaning and compound
[33:46] revelation
[33:48] so then if
[33:49] that's true
[33:51] then
[33:54] we believe that
[33:56] god was revealed in christ
[33:59] all right
[34:02] well see then that means the bride
[34:05] the prophet said
[34:08] it's part of the revelation
[34:10] and she's to be revealed
[34:15] but now do we believe that
[34:22] and see what i mean by revelation and
[34:24] being revealed is just like the old
[34:26] testament people as i said those
[34:28] prophets are there where god made
[34:30] manifest for the time yeah
[34:33] in each church age it's been god made
[34:34] manifest for the time
[34:38] all right
[34:40] that doesn't make us any different it
[34:41] makes us just being what it is that
[34:43] we're to finishing up for the gentile
[34:45] dispensation
[34:47] and as i've always said to you i was
[34:49] listening the other day somebody wrote
[34:50] me a note about it
[34:53] that
[34:54] if
[34:57] it was necessary to
[35:01] oh go to israel or send to israel
[35:04] would your revelation be enough to
[35:06] convert the jews
[35:09] would your revelation of god be enough
[35:11] to
[35:12] bring them to a
[35:14] understanding of one true and living god
[35:16] in the correct way
[35:19] well we better consider that because you
[35:21] know that's what's going to happen
[35:25] the two prophets the prophet said will
[35:27] take this message
[35:29] and go to israel
[35:32] all right
[35:34] now he didn't say they'd be over passing
[35:35] out quotes and things because they're
[35:38] already doing that
[35:40] they know about this
[35:42] message right and they know what brother
[35:45] branham believes because it's been over
[35:46] the internet over there you know
[35:51] we'll see would it would it convert them
[35:56] just think about it now as we consider a
[35:58] point
[36:00] then if we can show
[36:02] and i'm going to do this kind of an odd
[36:04] way so i said it may take just a little
[36:06] bit and then cut it off
[36:08] uh
[36:09] if we can show by the prophet that the
[36:11] bride is to be the fullness of the
[36:13] godhead bodily
[36:15] i repeat again the entire bride
[36:19] not just the end time people
[36:22] because if he's not complete without us
[36:24] then the church ages is not complete
[36:26] without us but we're not complete
[36:27] without them
[36:30] all right
[36:32] but think about it
[36:34] let's see if we believe it
[36:36] let's see if we can just read
[36:39] and believe what he says go ahead
[36:41] brother
[36:42] and pull up number
[36:44] six and let's start there
[36:48] right above there you remember what we
[36:50] were covering was
[36:51] that the word made flesh is the light of
[36:53] the age
[36:55] all right so now look what he says on
[36:57] sirs we would see jesus 57 804 the
[36:59] evening service
[37:01] e3
[37:05] there's many different gifts he's
[37:07] talking about his ministry and
[37:10] the things you know the anointing right
[37:12] many different gifts that god has to his
[37:15] church
[37:17] but they're all for the perfecting of
[37:19] the church to bring together in unity
[37:22] the great body of the lord jesus christ
[37:25] and the powers that was in christ now
[37:28] listen
[37:30] has
[37:32] now has is a past tense form right so
[37:35] read it
[37:36] has been given to his church
[37:42] do we believe that
[37:45] in the worst conditions that life could
[37:47] exist until i evenly openly admit it
[37:50] they may have more healings right over
[37:51] there in that service today than we'll
[37:53] have over here
[37:56] but can we still believe it
[38:00] i mean how would you like to been on
[38:02] israelite being beat and stomped and
[38:04] kicked and
[38:05] torn to pieces
[38:07] i'm the people of god
[38:09] it's been kind of hard to confess
[38:14] right
[38:16] but yeah we want it yeah we want the
[38:17] flower blood of evil yeah we want the
[38:19] great the great things are taking place
[38:22] it's no problem to believe when great
[38:23] things are taking place
[38:26] the problem is when not much is taking
[38:28] place and you have to stand on god's
[38:29] word
[38:33] well look what he says
[38:34] the gifts therefore the perfecting of
[38:36] the church to bring together in unity
[38:38] the great body of the lord jesus christ
[38:40] and the powers that was in christ
[38:43] has been given to his church
[38:45] now i started explaining that while ago
[38:47] i believe the ministry of jesus christ
[38:49] is in the bride of christ around the
[38:52] world
[38:53] it is in no place one time but no one is
[38:56] that ministry
[38:59] right now brother branham that ministry
[39:01] was in brother branham
[39:03] but
[39:03] um
[39:05] it takes a collective now to be the body
[39:08] right
[39:10] and i mean collective around the world
[39:12] see
[39:14] all right so then that way god can be
[39:15] doing a little bit here and a little bit
[39:17] there and god looking down at it and
[39:19] says man there's a great revival going
[39:20] on
[39:24] and we look at it and says ain't nothing
[39:25] taking place
[39:28] according to his eyes we look through
[39:31] he says the powers that was in christ
[39:33] has been given to his church
[39:35] all that god was he poured into christ
[39:38] and christ was god manifested on earth
[39:42] and all that christ was he poured into
[39:44] his church
[39:46] and all the powers that god had
[39:49] rested in christ
[39:51] and the fullness of christ
[39:54] rest in his church
[39:57] so what a people
[39:59] this should be
[40:03] look what you and i should be right
[40:08] but can we stand up and say you know
[40:10] somebody comes along and say
[40:12] well i heard your prophet said all the
[40:14] powers of god rest in the church
[40:18] well
[40:19] i i i don't know
[40:23] i don't want to i don't want to confess
[40:25] something that ain't true
[40:28] why
[40:29] you're already lying
[40:32] when you don't say what he say
[40:35] born that away die that away
[40:39] without christ converting us
[40:42] so what good is it to us to play in our
[40:44] little pity patties
[40:46] and think i'm so great at what he did
[40:48] well i don't know he said what a group
[40:50] what a people that should be
[40:53] now i have a funny way of doing things
[40:56] so
[40:57] you bear with me
[41:01] let's go to a statement brother random
[41:02] made
[41:04] because if you can believe
[41:06] that all the powers
[41:09] that christ has has been given to his
[41:11] church
[41:13] then
[41:15] let's think about this statement go
[41:18] ahead with number seven
[41:20] thinking from christ the mr god revealed
[41:24] 63 7 28 paragraph 143 and 144
[41:32] but what he wanted to do
[41:36] now listen he's talking about god
[41:38] himself right
[41:41] what he wanted to do
[41:43] he loved fatherhood
[41:47] for he was a father
[41:52] now watch the next statement
[41:55] the only way he could express it
[41:59] was to become
[42:01] a son of man right
[42:09] that's an odd sounding statement in it
[42:13] when we know he could create and he did
[42:15] create
[42:18] and he he created adam and eve
[42:22] and that made him a father
[42:25] right
[42:26] he created angels that made him god he
[42:30] created adam and eve and that made him
[42:31] father
[42:34] now why is your prophet taking it
[42:38] from seemingly
[42:40] there
[42:41] and bringing it seemingly over 4 000
[42:44] years
[42:49] to express a thought that
[42:51] the only way
[42:56] that he could express it
[43:01] was to become a son of man
[43:03] see he was a father because he created
[43:07] right
[43:10] but how could he express that may i add
[43:12] a word without you tangling me up
[43:18] the only way that he could express
[43:22] what he really had
[43:24] that he really wanted to do and the way
[43:26] he wanted to do it
[43:29] was to become the son of man
[43:31] is that mistranslating anything that he
[43:33] said there
[43:37] the way he wanted it
[43:40] you know
[43:43] the way he wanted to be a father
[43:46] was not in the garden
[43:52] no
[43:56] i went in the garden just to make him
[43:57] the father he wanted to be
[44:03] he had other things in mind that he
[44:05] would have to come through and come down
[44:07] and be
[44:11] now let's read it
[44:13] he loved fatherhood for he was a father
[44:15] and the only way that he could express
[44:17] it was to become a son of man
[44:19] that's the reason jesus kept saying
[44:22] the son of man
[44:24] see they didn't know what he was talking
[44:26] about many of them
[44:28] but now you get it in the congregation
[44:29] of holiday men
[44:32] he wanted to express himself
[44:36] connecting to thought
[44:39] that was his one of his great threefold
[44:42] purposes
[44:44] was to express himself
[44:47] identify himself
[44:49] with human beings
[44:53] to reveal himself
[44:55] in christ
[44:58] well now you've done move 4 thousand
[45:00] years right
[45:02] are you with me yes
[45:05] your thought is moved 4 000 years from
[45:07] father creator
[45:11] down to the way he wanted to be it
[45:14] and he could only do that by being the
[45:16] son of man
[45:23] you see why that it's been so joyous to
[45:26] see things in
[45:28] for over
[45:29] almost 50 years now still try to preach
[45:31] it
[45:33] and preach about the bride of jesus
[45:34] christ being the son of man
[45:40] we'll give them quotes too
[45:45] but it's a joy in my heart to look back
[45:47] at it and see it
[45:50] and think about it
[45:52] brother harris used to preach
[45:54] along on this line years ago
[45:57] about the
[45:58] the only way he could be a father the
[46:00] way he wanted to be a father was to be
[46:01] the son of man
[46:03] all right
[46:07] but think about
[46:12] it do we believe that the son of man
[46:18] is the only sower of the seed
[46:24] do we believe that
[46:30] you had the man in black sowing but that
[46:32] doesn't count because that's
[46:35] wrong seed
[46:38] the only sower of the seed is the son of
[46:40] man do you need those quotes in the
[46:41] prophet we will get to them the next few
[46:43] services
[46:45] why choose to move over
[46:48] and not preach wednesday because some of
[46:49] you are not capable of being here and
[46:51] i'm trying to put all this together on
[46:53] the sunday services all right
[46:58] now if the son of man is the only sower
[47:01] of the seed
[47:04] then that means that he had the seed of
[47:06] his entire
[47:09] right
[47:14] if he's the only sower now
[47:17] now we know that we're not talking about
[47:21] sexual seeds to just be blunt
[47:25] or some
[47:26] gene genetics sexually
[47:29] parts that's not even
[47:31] no
[47:35] the son of man spent a lot of time
[47:37] talking about sowing a seed
[47:40] have you read your bible lately if you
[47:42] happen you need to read it
[47:44] a lot of parables
[47:46] was placed in the scriptures
[47:48] about sowing seed
[47:51] the son of man was the sword of seed
[47:54] in one of those parables
[47:58] it emphatically states that
[48:00] the good seed
[48:02] is who
[48:04] the children of the kingdom
[48:10] the tares are satan in his ways and
[48:13] doings
[48:14] but the good seed
[48:16] is the children of the kingdom
[48:18] well see then it wasn't never right
[48:21] god never got a rightful position as
[48:24] wanting to be father
[48:26] the way he wanted to be father
[48:28] throughout the old testament
[48:33] that's why none of those in the old
[48:34] testament had the new birth
[48:38] you showed me where they did
[48:40] and how they got it
[48:44] when my bible says
[48:48] ghost had not been given because
[48:50] jesus christ had not been crucified
[48:54] now
[48:57] so the son of man
[49:01] he sowed his own
[49:03] body bride
[49:07] that's what he was doing while he was
[49:08] preaching
[49:10] and there was a handful of them walking
[49:11] with him
[49:14] and he sowed into their hearts
[49:18] the word of god
[49:23] and then one day he came and made a way
[49:26] that
[49:27] he came to the place that he could make
[49:28] a way
[49:29] and he could only do that as son of man
[49:35] the holy ghost could not get into
[49:37] mankind in the old testament
[49:39] and
[49:41] give him a new birth
[49:43] it could give him an anointing right
[49:48] but a man like david could be on his way
[49:51] home from the bed with bathsheba
[49:54] and singing out and praying
[49:56] return unto me the joy of thy salvation
[50:01] doesn't sound too much like a
[50:04] born-again christian
[50:06] right
[50:09] but you see that son of man then was god
[50:13] made manifest in flesh
[50:18] and he had the soul if you go back to
[50:20] spoken words original seed
[50:21] and listen to that message over and over
[50:26] the wonderful message
[50:30] a little more but something's very
[50:32] special to me
[50:35] because he speaks in there is that
[50:36] quoted i'm talking about about the word
[50:38] born bride
[50:40] and he tells about eve and her two wombs
[50:45] naturally and you know naturally and
[50:48] spiritually
[50:51] for the body that would come forth
[50:55] see he sowed
[50:57] the new testament bride
[51:04] not into the heart of the earth but into
[51:05] the heart of mankind
[51:10] and that's why there can't be you can't
[51:11] make one greater than the other one
[51:13] because we're all just children of the
[51:14] kingdom
[51:17] no matter what age or what we are or
[51:19] whatever we are in it
[51:21] prophets
[51:22] ministries whatever
[51:26] there's nothing no nobody's no
[51:28] bigger than you are and nobody's no
[51:30] smaller than you are
[51:33] the least in the kingdom
[51:35] is greater than john the baptist now the
[51:37] bible says that
[51:41] but you see what i'm talking about there
[51:43] was no way for him to be the father that
[51:45] he wanted to be
[51:48] unless he would come forth as
[51:51] son of man
[51:56] and as in the natural the only way that
[51:58] you can be a father
[52:01] is for you to have a seed to sow
[52:04] right
[52:06] we're not talking about adoptions or
[52:08] just any other we're talking about
[52:10] natural
[52:13] all right
[52:14] the only way you can have a family is to
[52:16] have a seed
[52:19] because it is not your dna family unless
[52:22] it comes from you
[52:25] right
[52:27] so is it with god the way he wanted a
[52:29] family
[52:30] he wanted a family of children
[52:34] that would love him
[52:36] now quote brother branham that no matter
[52:39] how
[52:41] hard it gets or bad it looks
[52:48] that we would realize that we were his
[52:50] children
[52:54] see those ages as they came down
[53:01] and luther realized he was a child of
[53:03] god
[53:07] and we'll get to it later i know the
[53:08] quotes and you know that could have been
[53:10] at it too long you do not think that i
[53:12] know a little bit he died son of man
[53:16] he wrote son of god to be through the
[53:18] church ages
[53:23] but that's explaining the dispensation
[53:26] because now i'm not correcting brother
[53:28] branham i'm just stating it the way i
[53:30] said it that is explaining dispensation
[53:33] because he died son of man it was the
[53:35] same son of man it raised out of that
[53:37] grave
[53:38] the body
[53:40] raised out of that grave
[53:43] but to be a dispensation
[53:46] he could not come back on the church on
[53:48] the day of pentecost as the son of man
[53:51] he had it would all been finished
[53:57] you and i wouldn't be part of it
[54:02] so he doubts on a man to release that
[54:04] life that was within him
[54:08] which was the son of god
[54:11] who was he when he walked the shores of
[54:12] galilee the bible said he had fullness
[54:14] of the godhead bodily
[54:16] then he was father son and holy ghost he
[54:18] was son of man son of god and son of
[54:21] david
[54:23] now he he couldn't manifest son of david
[54:25] right
[54:29] come on he couldn't manifest son of
[54:30] david that's that's all right
[54:32] but he was still that
[54:35] who's going to
[54:37] well son of david is going to be the son
[54:39] of man and the son of god the son of
[54:41] david's going to israel because that's
[54:43] not three people
[54:47] that's the same god in different
[54:49] manifestations and when he goes over
[54:51] there he'll have to be the son of man
[54:54] the word
[54:56] then he'll have to be the son of god to
[54:58] give them the holy ghost then he'll be
[55:00] the son of david to take them on into
[55:02] the millennium
[55:05] but i hope you're following me
[55:07] how could he be the father he wanted to
[55:09] be
[55:10] by being the son of man
[55:12] how can you be the father you want to be
[55:15] by being a man
[55:16] by choosing a wife
[55:19] right
[55:21] can't do it without y'all girls
[55:27] but you see he didn't have to have a
[55:28] wife to bring forth a dna
[55:31] in a sexual point
[55:36] he created
[55:41] how many people have you've been around
[55:43] here 30 years
[55:46] how many times over 20 30 years have you
[55:49] heard me preach on
[55:51] new creation
[55:56] and brother mo preached that in 1971
[56:01] i guess
[56:02] 77 we started in 71
[56:06] and he preached on new creation new race
[56:11] and on the day of pentecost it was a new
[56:12] race of people started
[56:17] now quote the prophet no longer was he
[56:19] dealing by ways of the flesh as he dealt
[56:21] in the old testament
[56:26] a new creation
[56:29] he spoke his bride
[56:31] into being
[56:33] as he was preaching the word
[56:37] and then telling about her
[56:41] what about when he gets over there you
[56:42] know
[56:43] look how let's see uh
[56:46] when the son of man is revealed
[56:48] you know in the scripture
[56:50] glorify thy my name you know glory how
[56:53] glorified will glorified again
[56:55] where's he going glorified again in his
[56:57] bride
[57:00] see all of that pertains to you and i
[57:02] speaking of you and i compound meaning
[57:04] come about in revelation
[57:07] coming down to where we're at
[57:12] are you following me
[57:15] see by doing it and being the fullness
[57:18] of the godhead bodily
[57:21] then he could put that in the church
[57:32] we'd have to start it off
[57:34] i didn't mean to go this way so it's all
[57:36] right
[57:39] we've got plenty of time anyway
[57:42] he started off on the death pentecost
[57:44] with the baptism of the holy ghost in
[57:46] the hearts of the bride
[57:47] right
[57:49] the new birth
[57:52] all right
[57:53] he wasn't spoke of in the ages as son of
[57:56] man
[57:59] paul didn't even write about it the son
[58:01] of man
[58:04] no doubt he knew because he'd talk to
[58:06] the others
[58:07] and even john and and and the ones who
[58:10] wrote in the you know the the writings
[58:13] of matthew mark luke and john
[58:15] you know i know all of them wouldn't
[58:16] original luke and mark were looking
[58:18] which one luke and mark
[58:22] but the others never wrote of him in any
[58:24] of their writings
[58:26] peter never spoke of
[58:29] son of man
[58:32] why because it was not the
[58:34] dispensational time or the doings for
[58:36] that to be done
[58:39] it was the holy ghost dispensation to
[58:41] build his church and upon this rock i'll
[58:43] build my church
[58:45] is that what jesus said in the gates of
[58:47] hell shall not prevail against it
[58:50] really was against it wouldn't it but it
[58:52] couldn't prevail it's still come forth
[58:54] because he promised i will restore
[58:56] so he's building a church
[59:00] none of that through the church ages
[59:02] would call him son of man
[59:06] but yet immediately when this prophet
[59:08] appears on the scene back in the 40s
[59:11] 49
[59:14] 50
[59:15] he started talking about son of man
[59:19] now we just read that
[59:23] jesus kept saying son of man
[59:26] and said
[59:27] they didn't understand
[59:30] right
[59:32] now you think the people understood when
[59:34] brother randall started talking about
[59:35] the son of man
[59:39] now the best a lot of them could do was
[59:41] try to make him that
[59:43] and he had to clarify i am not the son
[59:46] of man i am a son of man
[59:52] you had to make it clear
[59:54] why
[59:57] because the capability of the people was
[59:59] not at the place to believe it
[1:00:02] and i wonder is our capability there
[1:00:07] because i've been preaching this for
[1:00:08] over 40 years
[1:00:10] trying to get somebody to believe it
[1:00:17] believe what the word says
[1:00:20] believe what the prophet says
[1:00:24] you know
[1:00:26] well brother so-and-so said he didn't
[1:00:28] believe with his gut fullness
[1:00:32] well the same brother said that the
[1:00:34] third pull was only for brother branham
[1:00:37] and brother and the lord jesus
[1:00:40] well i don't agree with that
[1:00:43] because the prophet said the third pool
[1:00:46] was for the bride
[1:00:49] and the church
[1:00:54] oh
[1:00:57] and to the totally lost
[1:01:00] even the church today is getting the
[1:01:02] benefits out of
[1:01:04] the third pool the opening of the word
[1:01:06] you turn on the radio today and listen
[1:01:07] to them preach
[1:01:10] man they preach beautiful messages you
[1:01:12] know why they've heard the tapes
[1:01:15] they've read the books
[1:01:17] it's helping them
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] one day some of them will say hey
[1:01:22] you remember that man said them
[1:01:24] denominations is wrong
[1:01:28] and they're going to give their life
[1:01:32] because of what they believe
[1:01:36] but do you see it the only way to be
[1:01:40] the father he wanted to be
[1:01:42] was to be the son of man
[1:01:45] and he would speak
[1:01:47] into existence
[1:01:50] the very word
[1:01:54] seed
[1:01:56] some took the seed is that the parable
[1:01:59] and hell the seed
[1:02:02] and then the rain would come what was it
[1:02:03] that pentecost right
[1:02:07] what about creating your own bridegroom
[1:02:11] is that a quote
[1:02:14] the bridegroom created his own
[1:02:15] bridegroom
[1:02:18] that's why we're called a new creation a
[1:02:20] new race
[1:02:23] but the whole bride of christ is that
[1:02:24] new race
[1:02:27] not just the end time that's just a
[1:02:29] message to the end times
[1:02:35] do we believe it
[1:02:38] do we believe the promises that god has
[1:02:40] made
[1:02:44] right
[1:02:47] but i'm not asking you to believe what
[1:02:49] i'm saying i'm asking you do you
[1:02:52] understand what i'm saying yes
[1:02:57] that he created his own bride ride
[1:03:02] by speaking the word
[1:03:07] and you know by doing it
[1:03:09] he gets into matthew 24
[1:03:11] and he covers what will happen
[1:03:14] if you don't believe he spoke the ages
[1:03:16] et cetera et cetera
[1:03:18] in matthew 24 he tells what will take
[1:03:21] place in the church ages right
[1:03:25] read matthew 24 because he tells what
[1:03:27] will happen that's where the seals is
[1:03:28] taken where it's at right in the seals
[1:03:31] in matthew 24 and he tells what's going
[1:03:33] to happen through the ages and so just
[1:03:36] don't think well he spoke that back
[1:03:37] there and then he's going to speak this
[1:03:38] over here
[1:03:39] no
[1:03:40] the brother branham never come to speak
[1:03:42] a bride
[1:03:46] god already had one
[1:03:49] you don't need nobody to speak abroad he
[1:03:51] needed somebody to get the bride to
[1:03:53] realize who she was
[1:03:57] and what we're doing here is that what
[1:03:58] he said
[1:04:00] then satan will be powerless before that
[1:04:02] group of people
[1:04:04] that finally believes it
[1:04:08] but if we don't believe it then there's
[1:04:09] no need of fooling with it anyway
[1:04:12] all right
[1:04:14] but look what he's saying
[1:04:18] they didn't know what he was talking
[1:04:20] about many of them
[1:04:21] now do you get it amen
[1:04:24] i'm not making light of anybody
[1:04:27] i'm just saying sometimes we say amen
[1:04:29] when we don't know what in the world is
[1:04:31] going on then we should have been saying
[1:04:33] oh me explain that to me amen
[1:04:36] right
[1:04:38] i've said amen when a brother would be
[1:04:40] preaching
[1:04:41] and he would be right and be bringing it
[1:04:44] along and everything would be running
[1:04:46] right and i say amen in the next words
[1:04:48] he goes
[1:04:50] and i've had people come to me and said
[1:04:52] will you amend what he said i said i am
[1:04:54] end up to that one point
[1:04:59] wasn't there on
[1:05:01] i wouldn't amen and then i'd hold me in
[1:05:03] it
[1:05:07] but look how he deals so much that's why
[1:05:10] i asked you if you would to go home and
[1:05:11] read the things where all god was he
[1:05:14] poured into christ all christ in the
[1:05:16] church take her back to the garden of
[1:05:17] eden just give a little time sometimes
[1:05:19] and run that in your computer
[1:05:21] and see all the times that he spoke
[1:05:23] about that
[1:05:25] that all god was he poured into christ
[1:05:27] saw christ in the church
[1:05:30] and that's the only way he's going to
[1:05:31] take us back to the garden of eden right
[1:05:36] well see what he needs is what we're
[1:05:37] reading here in the doing so pull the
[1:05:40] quote back up brother
[1:05:44] on where he was on christ and mr god
[1:05:46] revealed paragraph 143
[1:05:49] and he's talking about
[1:05:53] one of his threefold purposes was to
[1:05:55] express himself
[1:05:58] identify himself with human beings
[1:06:01] to reveal himself in christ
[1:06:04] all right so that's not
[1:06:07] the
[1:06:08] old testament dealings see then secondly
[1:06:11] to have the preeminence
[1:06:15] that means first place right
[1:06:17] in his body of believers
[1:06:20] that is his bride
[1:06:22] that he might live in people
[1:06:26] all right drop on to the next one
[1:06:29] jumps over a couple of paragraphs and it
[1:06:30] goes to paragraph 153
[1:06:33] across the mystery oh if god can get him
[1:06:36] prisoners like that
[1:06:37] now that's when he can express the
[1:06:39] preeminence you see he he's got the man
[1:06:42] or the person so that he knows nothing
[1:06:45] but christ
[1:06:48] you get what i mean congregation said
[1:06:50] amen all right that's second first to
[1:06:52] express himself completely
[1:06:55] god in christ
[1:06:56] second to have the preeminence by this
[1:06:59] by what
[1:07:01] by all that was in god
[1:07:04] to be poured into christ
[1:07:07] by this in his church
[1:07:09] which is his body the bride
[1:07:12] till he could have the preeminence to
[1:07:14] express himself through them
[1:07:16] and all right thirdly to restore the
[1:07:18] kingdom to his rightly position that
[1:07:20] fell by sin by the first adam back to
[1:07:22] where he walked in the cool of the
[1:07:23] evening with his people and talked with
[1:07:25] them fellowshipped with them
[1:07:28] now if you want to walk in the cool of
[1:07:30] the evening you're going to be with god
[1:07:31] then what do we need to do preeminence
[1:07:34] we will read one when we get into where
[1:07:37] brother ryan says
[1:07:38] he talks about the fullness of the
[1:07:40] godhead bodily dwelling in the bride he
[1:07:42] says
[1:07:43] when there is no leaven
[1:07:47] among you
[1:07:49] it will bring he said the fullness now
[1:07:52] we're not going there this evening but
[1:07:54] that's what he said it'll be
[1:07:56] but you see what it was
[1:08:01] partly
[1:08:03] he was in moses
[1:08:05] david had him
[1:08:09] but here he is manifested in the
[1:08:11] fullness deity himself standing on earth
[1:08:15] god in his fullness to die for the sin
[1:08:17] of the people is progress 372
[1:08:20] that he might bring to his church a
[1:08:23] sanctified life
[1:08:25] that he might have the preeminence
[1:08:27] in fullness in his church to manifest
[1:08:30] every promise
[1:08:31] in these days that he promised for the
[1:08:33] last days see
[1:08:38] promised it
[1:08:43] let's just bring up 374 for your number
[1:08:46] eight
[1:08:48] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[1:08:53] are you following that then we'll go on
[1:08:54] down to paragraph
[1:08:56] 375
[1:08:58] and through that purpose he achieved a
[1:09:00] church
[1:09:01] that he the fullness of god might bring
[1:09:03] to pass ever promised word
[1:09:06] of god in these last days
[1:09:09] when he gets the preeminence
[1:09:11] the earth to catch
[1:09:14] preeminence in the church the position
[1:09:17] his place in the church
[1:09:20] now what would be the greatest place
[1:09:22] that jesus christ could have in the
[1:09:23] church
[1:09:25] is be headstone wouldn't it
[1:09:28] because the head the body don't operate
[1:09:29] without the head
[1:09:32] we'll get to those things
[1:09:34] jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:09:36] works that i do shall he do also even
[1:09:38] more than this shall he
[1:09:41] do for i go to my father see that was
[1:09:44] his purpose there was the manifestation
[1:09:48] and now today he wants to get somebody
[1:09:50] that can so see it
[1:09:53] that they can let the word what
[1:09:57] just go through them
[1:10:01] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:10:05] can we ever believe it
[1:10:10] let me get this one and then we'll quit
[1:10:13] but it won't go on into the lights going
[1:10:14] to number number eight and let's do that
[1:10:17] we would see jesus but i'm doing this
[1:10:19] for the purpose of you understanding
[1:10:20] that it's in every church age or the
[1:10:22] purpose of bringing this one we would
[1:10:24] see jesus 62 7 12
[1:10:26] uh
[1:10:28] e 53
[1:10:30] same thing tonight by the holy ghost god
[1:10:32] on the day of pentecost that pillar of
[1:10:34] fire broke into many tongues of fire
[1:10:38] four tongues and set god was separating
[1:10:41] himself among the people
[1:10:43] that day god was in one person christ
[1:10:46] now he's in
[1:10:48] the entire church universal
[1:10:52] amen he said
[1:10:55] now he's in the entire church
[1:10:58] around the world
[1:11:00] today
[1:11:02] he's been in the entire church all the
[1:11:03] way down to the ages
[1:11:08] because she's him made manifest
[1:11:12] but can we believe it
[1:11:14] can we believe that we are
[1:11:16] not just a special people in the end
[1:11:18] time but it's been a special people all
[1:11:20] the time
[1:11:22] because it's a new creation
[1:11:24] a new race not of the old
[1:11:27] that new birth put us to a position
[1:11:32] brought us into a dispensation of grace
[1:11:38] all right
[1:11:39] brought us to a place to believe who we
[1:11:40] are
[1:11:43] wasn't it uh luther that they said you
[1:11:46] know
[1:11:47] luther said don't you know that the
[1:11:48] whole world is against you he said i
[1:11:50] want them to know i'm against them
[1:11:55] well
[1:11:58] you think there's one man
[1:12:01] well that one man
[1:12:03] started a reformation that you and i
[1:12:05] still believe in
[1:12:10] because he brought the word of god he
[1:12:12] proved he was the bride he proved what
[1:12:15] age he was of
[1:12:19] now we've got to prove what age we're of
[1:12:22] i hope you get it with the illustration
[1:12:24] of what i'm talking about
[1:12:28] in him
[1:12:30] the prophet said he's not complete
[1:12:32] without you
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:39] why because he imparted
[1:12:42] his own life
[1:12:44] he was not happy to be just the old
[1:12:46] testament people in what they were doing
[1:12:48] that was never his goal his achievement
[1:12:53] he looked down upon jesus christ and can
[1:12:56] i say this if you'll go to the future
[1:12:58] home you'll get the whole thing
[1:13:01] he looked right down to that body that
[1:13:03] was standing there
[1:13:05] and said in him dwelt the fullness of
[1:13:07] the godhead bodily
[1:13:12] dwelling in
[1:13:14] jesus christ
[1:13:16] was god's whole purpose
[1:13:20] what he was going to do
[1:13:23] oh was done in him
[1:13:26] he saw him in him a finished product
[1:13:31] and he said the statement that we use
[1:13:32] what is page 49 i think
[1:13:39] that
[1:13:40] there in that body
[1:13:42] our bodies
[1:13:44] were redeemed
[1:13:49] in that body sister gail
[1:13:51] that stood on calvary and died and went
[1:13:54] down to the grave and rose again
[1:13:56] my body
[1:13:59] not speaking of a physical
[1:14:01] because it's not a
[1:14:04] point
[1:14:05] but it was a point that my body will
[1:14:08] come back to the place it's supposed to
[1:14:10] be
[1:14:11] and that's the point
[1:14:14] but in him was all things
[1:14:17] made manifest
[1:14:19] he's the head of all things
[1:14:21] and by him all things consist
[1:14:26] you and i are anything
[1:14:28] we better put the glory in him
[1:14:32] and say thank you lord for what you've
[1:14:34] made me
[1:14:35] that's what he said he that hath made us
[1:14:37] and not we ourselves we are his people
[1:14:39] the sheep of his
[1:14:40] pastor right
[1:14:44] but do you see what i'm talking about
[1:14:48] if there's anything any good about you
[1:14:50] and i it had to be in him amen
[1:14:56] and then brought out of him by death
[1:14:59] that he could see his family
[1:15:03] right
[1:15:04] he had spoke the word
[1:15:07] right
[1:15:08] he spoke it
[1:15:10] matthew mark luke and john read it over
[1:15:12] and over he spoke it
[1:15:14] but then he had to go to calvary
[1:15:17] and die
[1:15:18] to where that could come
[1:15:20] and make any effect because that was his
[1:15:23] word
[1:15:25] and he couldn't put it in them people
[1:15:28] they had it into them as much as a human
[1:15:31] being could have
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] and they even said one day now we know
[1:15:35] nobody don't have to teach you
[1:15:38] but remember nicodemus said that we know
[1:15:41] that no man can do these things
[1:15:45] well see we want all of this about a
[1:15:47] seed
[1:15:49] oh brother dale i heard brother show and
[1:15:51] show set years ago and i just believe
[1:15:53] that i'm a seed
[1:15:57] of what
[1:16:02] you've got a seed of unbelief you've got
[1:16:05] you've got all kinds of seeds
[1:16:10] but he spoke us into existence
[1:16:13] from his own mouth
[1:16:15] in that body
[1:16:17] called lord jesus christ the son of man
[1:16:21] and then he began to make a way he went
[1:16:23] on to calvary that you and i could
[1:16:25] believe that
[1:16:28] and it could only be coming into the
[1:16:30] church as son of god we realize that
[1:16:32] because those disciples did not have the
[1:16:36] end time message
[1:16:37] they would bring about the change of the
[1:16:39] body
[1:16:40] and i believe that i believe this
[1:16:42] message brings us to the fullness of the
[1:16:44] change and that was not present back
[1:16:46] there it was present in jesus christ
[1:16:48] matthew 24 because he was talking about
[1:16:50] but nobody understood it
[1:16:52] just like he said nobody understood the
[1:16:54] son of man
[1:16:56] but do we understand the son of man
[1:16:58] by being son of man he's my daddy
[1:17:02] that has more to do with it than just a
[1:17:04] spiritual
[1:17:06] baptism
[1:17:10] i'm ending with a lifestyle a little bit
[1:17:13] it's more to do than just his life
[1:17:16] released
[1:17:19] because
[1:17:22] he's going to have to make this thing
[1:17:24] like him
[1:17:27] and that's why you'll see when we get to
[1:17:29] it
[1:17:31] it'll be about four messages i guess
[1:17:33] where he says the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:35] is the son of man
[1:17:43] just run it in your computers if you
[1:17:44] want these notes on
[1:17:47] we'll get around to it next weekend the
[1:17:48] lord willing about the fullness of the
[1:17:50] godhead bodily being in the bride
[1:17:53] i believe that i believed it so well
[1:17:56] years ago i wrote it in my bible
[1:17:59] and i just keep adding to it
[1:18:02] because it keeps unfolding
[1:18:05] to what i
[1:18:06] tried to preach the bride of christ is
[1:18:08] the son of man
[1:18:10] and i still believe that amen
[1:18:13] no matter if there ain't but one
[1:18:15] person
[1:18:16] right it's going to take place
[1:18:22] i don't look for a big majority and i
[1:18:24] don't say that wrong about the people
[1:18:26] coming in the message
[1:18:28] because what would be a majority
[1:18:30] counting 7 billion people
[1:18:33] and if there was
[1:18:34] 1 billion bride i'm talking about alive
[1:18:37] right now and there was one billion
[1:18:39] people bride right now that would still
[1:18:42] be a minority
[1:18:44] as compared to seven billion
[1:18:49] but it says fear not little flock
[1:18:56] because only the bride's going to know
[1:18:59] they that know their god
[1:19:01] shall do what exploits come on brothers
[1:19:06] let's end it right there before we're
[1:19:08] going up a little bit into it but if you
[1:19:10] want these quotes come and get them out
[1:19:11] of the service
[1:19:12] and read them if don't then just run in
[1:19:15] fullness of the godhead it'll give you a
[1:19:16] good time to just read all of them
[1:19:19] and you can just read off your computer
[1:19:21] and study it all day long fullness of
[1:19:23] the godhead
[1:19:27] we just remember and find where he's
[1:19:29] talking about
[1:19:30] in his church
[1:19:33] not in one person
[1:19:37] phyllis the godhead was not in brother
[1:19:39] branham
[1:19:42] that would make him the wrong way of
[1:19:44] being god
[1:19:47] brother ranum is in the body of christ
[1:19:51] so
[1:19:52] he could as john
[1:19:54] type
[1:19:55] the church on patmos
[1:19:58] in the rapture
[1:19:59] brother branham could
[1:20:01] walk into the opening of the word
[1:20:06] but now he's got to wait until somebody
[1:20:09] gets it
[1:20:11] and becomes what
[1:20:13] he said
[1:20:15] and it's not an extra message or
[1:20:17] something what we got brother let's
[1:20:18] stand together
[1:20:25] red book yes sir
[1:20:28] 167.
[1:20:30] anybody have a needle
[1:20:42] jesus came and made me
[1:20:46] oh i would not be
[1:20:50] till jesus came and revealed it
[1:20:55] till he came and revealed it unto me
[1:20:58] i won't stop
[1:21:03] things start going wrong
[1:21:09] things start going wrong i don't
[1:21:11] remember let's go everything's going
[1:21:13] wrong i'm about to be a christian
[1:21:16] i start searching
[1:21:20] i start reading and praying
[1:21:22] because i know
[1:21:24] that devil trying to cut me off on
[1:21:26] something
[1:21:29] if he can cut you off
[1:21:32] he's done his job
[1:21:40] just stay right there so you can't
[1:21:42] figure out the word of god
[1:21:44] i don't mean that
[1:21:47] you say you study too much brother dale
[1:21:50] you can't study enough
[1:21:52] but you can't study it anyway
[1:21:56] you can get familiar with the message
[1:22:00] the layout
[1:22:02] but it's got to be revealed
[1:22:09] how do you think i felt in 69 when i
[1:22:12] said the bride of jesus christ is
[1:22:15] the son of man
[1:22:20] when i knew i was standing
[1:22:24] hello
[1:22:27] hello people didn't believe it
[1:22:31] oh we believe the prophet
[1:22:35] what about
[1:22:36] this we don't know about that
[1:22:41] you don't know about what
[1:22:46] either it's right or wrong
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:52] either it's right or wrong
