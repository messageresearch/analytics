[0:00] recording before we start this is
[0:05] something that kind of excites me Gabi
[0:08] talked to me this past Monday and said
[0:10] Ron I want to know how I know I'm born
[0:13] again and more or less the same thing
[0:16] sister Sheppard said in the dream you
[0:17] know is it in blessed blessed be his
[0:19] name that sermon brother Dale said first
[0:21] of us to over and over again and sister
[0:24] Shepherds wondering she's born again or
[0:26] how she know she has a new verse and
[0:28] Gabby had asked me Monday because of
[0:30] something brother Dale said Sunday
[0:32] morning in the service that caught her
[0:34] attention kind of put a question in her
[0:36] mind and so that's what he's trying to
[0:40] do if you remember he's always saying
[0:41] like every service I wish I could preach
[0:43] so much to where you fill out your loss
[0:45] so that you would start seeking God
[0:47] because a lot of people have come to a
[0:49] position where to be a justification and
[0:51] sanctification and stopped short of get
[0:53] the Holy Ghost and to me if you ever
[0:55] stopped at any time in your journey then
[0:59] you know you have really made any
[1:00] progress you haven't really started in
[1:02] my mind if you just come to any place
[1:04] and stop you're not waiting to be even
[1:07] if you believe you have the Holy Ghost
[1:08] you still keep going on still keep
[1:10] seeking more God so it thrilled my heart
[1:12] that Gabby would ask me that I know
[1:14] she'll hear this on the tape later so
[1:15] she said I can I asked her if I could
[1:17] talk about this for an illustration all
[1:20] right so she said how do I know I'm worn
[1:23] again I said well this is how I know I'm
[1:24] worn again and I based it on an
[1:26] experience I had 2015 and actually since
[1:29] that time I haven't sat down and stopped
[1:31] and so you know I'm born again I'm
[1:33] waiting on you to catch up wife it's not
[1:35] like that a few years ago if something
[1:37] happened to me where a simple verse of
[1:39] scripture was quickened to me one that
[1:41] I've read many times and if this came to
[1:42] life and I have never seen it in that
[1:45] line before and since that time has been
[1:46] a continual unfolding of the Word of God
[1:48] to me that's a new birth that hasn't
[1:49] stopped and I haven't stopped in my
[1:51] fervent desire to keep going on with God
[1:53] so but I had actually already been a
[1:56] Christian for 18 years by that time so
[1:59] it was you know I gave more for when I
[2:02] was 12 and since
[2:04] tom has been a continual growth well
[2:06] anyway I said just don't stop seeking
[2:08] you know just never stop seeking more of
[2:10] God and he'll fill you with all the
[2:11] ghosts and his time you just keep going
[2:14] but anyway a lot of brothers I got to
[2:18] thinking a lot of husbands if their wife
[2:20] said I don't know if I'm born again a
[2:22] lot of brothers might say well no don't
[2:23] don't say that you know you shouldn't
[2:25] say that because you spoke in tongue you
[2:26] shouted around the house you danced in
[2:28] the spirit you and I might say to her
[2:30] you set up three hours or two hours
[2:32] every single night and listen to sermons
[2:33] you know she comes into her sleep time
[2:36] to do that because that's all the time
[2:38] she can do it that's sometimes she can
[2:39] make time for the Lord is after she puts
[2:42] the kids down for bed at ten o'clock I
[2:44] go to work and she's cutting into her
[2:47] sleep time to step and listen to sermons
[2:48] of these ministers seeking God and I
[2:52] might say well Gabby you can look to
[2:54] that Lester in your birth but it's not
[2:55] that's not a new birth that's seeking
[2:56] for their first but you know you can't
[2:58] base it on some kind of experience like
[3:00] that it's got to be a person or that's
[3:02] what the new birthday has birth of the
[3:04] word it's exactly what it is and that's
[3:06] all it is it's not speaking in tongues
[3:08] shouting and you know who was it John or
[3:11] Charles Wesley I think it was John
[3:12] Wesley but anyone that came over here
[3:14] and said I came to America to hurt the
[3:16] hey
[3:17] were made and well I guess it was his
[3:19] brother that was appalled at this
[3:21] madness and lived so holding so how can
[3:23] you say that look at all that you've
[3:24] done
[3:25] you know everything done for the Lord
[3:26] but I'm thrilled to death that she's
[3:28] still sneaking back to the hallways
[3:29] period you're thrilled to know it and
[3:31] I'm sure she's glad to let it be more
[3:33] and not ashamed of there's nothing
[3:34] ashamed about that for me to be a
[3:37] Christian for eighteen years before I
[3:38] count my new birth to have actually
[3:40] started is it's not I'm not embarrassed
[3:43] to say it I'm just still sticking for
[3:44] more God though okay
[3:49] so we'll go ahead and pray that was just
[3:51] a little testimony I want to share with
[3:52] you all
[3:54] they're going to father with the cradle
[3:56] of the chill blessed us in the service
[3:57] today and in the Sunday school the
[3:58] services afternoon orders I'm not my
[4:01] master will just be an Irish to here
[4:02] father is your work comes forth just get
[4:04] over to yourself and everything that's
[4:06] done father and help us to just to dwell
[4:07] on new keep our hearts focused on the
[4:09] Lord and touch all the sick and all
[4:12] those who are out stable of Thomas and
[4:13] all the many others for just manifest
[4:15] your children and offer our bodies and
[4:18] just give us what we have enough today
[4:19] father today I had a few little slides
[4:25] touch up some stuff in this report but
[4:28] what we're gonna do is review a little
[4:30] bit from the last lesson about moment
[4:31] strength and then we're gonna pick up
[4:34] where he left off alright and I'm ever
[4:38] to think to put this name last time so I
[4:40] thought about this though is the song 23
[4:42] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[4:44] he maketh me to lie down in green
[4:47] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[4:49] waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[4:52] me in paths of righteousness for his
[4:54] name's sake yea though I walk through
[4:56] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[4:58] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[5:01] rod enough to comfort me now prepares a
[5:04] table before me in the presence of mine
[5:06] enemies
[5:06] now notice my head with all of my cup
[5:08] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[5:11] shall follow me all the days of my life
[5:12] and I will dwell in the house of the
[5:14] Lord forever
[5:18] so like last time we were talking about
[5:21] sheep all we like sheep have gone astray
[5:23] the table has gone astray this time are
[5:26] too
[5:29] title isaiah 53:6 all we like sheep have
[5:34] gone astray we have turned every one to
[5:36] his own way and the LORD hath laid on
[5:38] him the iniquity of us all
[5:42] psalm 119 176 I have gone astray like a
[5:47] lost sheep seek thy servant for I do not
[5:50] forget my Commandments so the objective
[5:54] today is to better understand the Sheep
[5:56] life nature that we have as humans and
[5:58] to recognize the rabbit tendency to go
[6:00] astray and most important to recognize
[6:02] that we need a foul administration to
[6:05] follow all right there is no such thing
[6:13] as being too dumb to understand the
[6:15] mysteries of God I use this slide last
[6:17] time I want to just reiterate okay very
[6:18] important there's no such thing being
[6:20] too dumb to understand the mysteries of
[6:21] God he reveals them to babes
[6:23] the uneducated the unsophisticated the
[6:26] simple and the humble it's not too hard
[6:29] or too complex to understand we simply
[6:31] need to read listen and pray and trust
[6:34] God to bring the understanding through
[6:37] the most Revelator men that I know of
[6:38] that I listen to is the right kind of
[6:40] regular basis it's our pastor who has
[6:43] like a ninth grade education is that
[6:44] right maybe a genius yeah they started
[6:48] into the den got a limited education and
[6:50] then brother branham about a seventh
[6:52] grader thanked education and these godly
[6:54] men have come to a place of Revelation
[6:57] and where I want to be and so you know
[7:00] that underlines emphasizes that we don't
[7:03] have to have education or be
[7:04] sophisticated really you're in a better
[7:06] position right the opposite of that
[7:09] just get real little real humble before
[7:11] the Lord sheep instinctively followed
[7:14] the late sheep and their flock similar
[7:15] to our instinct the event major
[7:17] sometimes that later can be just the
[7:20] first sheep that moves to another
[7:21] location
[7:22] however sheep often following the oldest
[7:24] mother the you and the floor find you
[7:27] humans do the same as I am talk about
[7:30] that last time got higher simplicity
[7:33] because man not made up in the beginning
[7:36] was better not to try to shift for
[7:39] himself for mammals
[7:40] had to rely completely upon God
[7:43] that's three my liking in the lamb's
[7:44] wool sheep the Sheep cannot lead it set
[7:46] himself he has to have a leader and the
[7:49] Holy Spirit's supposed to lead us so a
[7:51] man has made that way it was not a flaw
[7:52] it was not unintentional God made us
[7:54] that way so we seek Him as sheep we
[7:58] haven't has a tendency to go straight
[8:00] from common sense he sound doctrine last
[8:02] time I gave you all these examples
[8:04] naturally most of them just natural
[8:06] things above and how they go astray and
[8:08] all those things are bias is parenting
[8:10] driving and so forth I'm just going to
[8:12] talk about the Christian life this time
[8:21] we're not careful we can go straight
[8:24] even on our Christian experience 2nd
[8:25] Peter 3:17 ye therefore beloved seeing
[8:28] you know these things before beware lest
[8:30] ye also being led away with the error of
[8:33] the wicked fall from your own
[8:34] steadfastness all right
[8:45] I kind of goofed up on this little game
[8:47] I told there last time we're going to
[8:49] start doing a name that creature that's
[8:50] my little game for the purpose of giving
[8:53] you to realize how much God is speaking
[8:57] to us through these men because you know
[8:59] as quoted to you last time the scripture
[9:01] a prophet is not without honor saving
[9:02] his own country among his own kin maybe
[9:04] you can to the preachers here or at
[9:07] least we all know them on a personal
[9:09] basis so it's kind of hard to look past
[9:11] that veil of the flesh and see that God
[9:12] behind that speaking to us but it's
[9:14] there okay and if you just look at this
[9:17] statement or any of these statements
[9:19] that I've come out to you and focus on
[9:20] that you might see that this is a very
[9:23] profound thing that's really happening
[9:25] and I gave this one away last time I
[9:27] said I'm a pastor said this now which
[9:29] one five minutes brother Dale what about
[9:35] the hospice into the work and letting
[9:37] them the word clean you out other day
[9:42] Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful
[9:45] but followers of them who through faith
[9:46] and patience inherit the promises I have
[9:49] witnessed our fivefold ministers and
[9:51] heard the promises of the promise of the
[9:52] new birth to us to follow them follow
[9:54] them as they follow Christ
[10:01] God keeps us warm little kind of speed
[10:03] through some of these I'm eating that
[10:05] pastor for a while I'm skipping I'm
[10:07] yellow but you go into a place where a
[10:09] pastor of the solid gospel teacher and
[10:11] all hell when they promote that church
[10:14] Jesus Christ the minister headbang
[10:16] forever
[10:18] so many times we fail to get the real
[10:21] power out of the gospel because we try
[10:23] to make it so complicated and the self
[10:25] simple it is we miss it by that way and
[10:29] now having some simplicity to expect to
[10:31] be something great something that we
[10:33] miss the simple thing we stumble over
[10:35] simplicity that's how we miss God is by
[10:37] stumbling over simplicity God is so
[10:39] simple until the scholars of these days
[10:42] and all days miss him a million miles
[10:45] because in their intellect they know
[10:46] there's nothing like him so great but in
[10:49] his revelation who makes it so simple
[10:51] they go fall over the top of it or miss
[10:53] it so did you find yourself lacking in
[10:58] revelation those God not there with you
[10:59] as much as you would lie
[11:01] this is not his fault he has not slack
[11:03] concerning his promise Simon Peter 3:9
[11:09] one of the ways we have gone astray in
[11:11] our Christian life is by not spending
[11:13] enough time with God I think the best
[11:15] thing to come to church and every
[11:16] service and listening to the word being
[11:18] preached we are okay you might say well
[11:21] I don't think that the Word of God is a
[11:24] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[11:26] the heart
[11:26] sometimes we're thinking things that we
[11:28] don't even realize we're thinking it so
[11:30] brother Dale or some master exposes that
[11:32] takes that veil off of our face and we
[11:35] begin to see where we're at we see the
[11:36] walk horse rider rotting away in
[11:37] opposition when the rebel
[11:39] so there's things that really does
[11:41] preach when I literally thought no I
[11:43] didn't think I was believed in that
[11:44] banality I really was and so the
[11:46] revelation comes I'm glad to what
[11:48] actually believes so you might not think
[11:50] that that this is you but just double
[11:53] check because frankly if you don't go
[11:56] home and study and pray and read and
[11:58] listen to these sermons over and over
[12:00] again that are being preached here maybe
[12:02] you fall in that category just me just
[12:04] think about that
[12:08] so don't pitch for get back to the next
[12:10] person so that's not me as for the young
[12:12] ones or somebody though that is a very
[12:15] necessary part of the Christian life
[12:16] until them out whatever I said in that
[12:18] last life every kind of going going to
[12:21] church listening the work and so forth
[12:22] though lesson that's third part of the
[12:23] Christian life we should also be
[12:24] spending much time in sacred with the
[12:26] Lord we should be reading the sermons
[12:28] that our ministers tell us to read you
[12:30] know brother delt gives us homework
[12:31] assignments I call them almost a
[12:33] resource he said go read or listen to
[12:34] this for that write it down because you
[12:36] won't remember and then go go do it
[12:38] thinking on the things that are being
[12:42] preached by all of our Minister brother
[12:44] Brown them and by all the ministers here
[12:46] and those who come true to preach and so
[12:47] forth
[12:48] ask some questions in spending much time
[12:50] in prayer asking the Lord to reveal to
[12:52] us the word that is being brought if you
[12:58] want to understand the seals be still
[13:00] book understand them seventy weeks of a
[13:06] book you want to understand the same
[13:09] church ages ready to church a book
[13:11] pretty simple huh reading does not give
[13:18] you a revelation all right when it
[13:21] doesn't so it's down on the Word of God
[13:23] it does soul the word got into your mind
[13:25] so that God can quicken it to ground
[13:26] this is our part of repairing our ground
[13:28] can't expect off overhead and forward
[13:31] him other thing I'll say about that is
[13:35] how can you convince God that you're
[13:37] really sincere and really desire a
[13:38] revelation if you won't go and study and
[13:40] pray
[13:41] you know it's like lord I really decided
[13:43] to reveal your work to me and that's in
[13:45] this third part of praying but then do
[13:47] you go and show them your sincere you do
[13:53] that by studying and bright and spend
[13:54] time with hmm I just love that picture
[13:57] in the scriptures although they up there
[13:58] we're fair 225 for we were you were as
[14:01] sheep going astray but are now returned
[14:04] under the Shepherd and Bishop of your
[14:06] souls let me go back to this one from
[14:11] you so talking about preparing our
[14:13] ground and so forth I'll give you an
[14:15] illustration I don't remember if I've
[14:17] ever heard this somewhere else if I just
[14:18] thought of it
[14:19] but let's suppose that say a young girl
[14:21] walks in here right now say 25 years old
[14:24] and we know she's fertile she's able to
[14:26] conceive but we know she's never known a
[14:28] man she doesn't have a husband or even a
[14:30] boyfriend she's never been with a man in
[14:32] that way then and all of a sudden she
[14:35] says you know what I'm pregnant I'm
[14:36] expecting a child first I might say well
[14:38] you missed you missed that boat that
[14:40] came you know with Mary she's on one
[14:42] that had the Immaculate Conception right
[14:43] so you'd say well how are you pregnant
[14:46] you don't know a man and she she might
[14:49] come up with some kind of little story
[14:51] or something but really we know she
[14:52] can't be pregnant outside of being with
[14:55] the man and spiritually speaking we
[14:57] cannot be born again we cannot be
[15:00] bearing any fruit or anything to the
[15:02] Lord cannot be born again unless we been
[15:04] spending time with Almighty God a secret
[15:06] okay that's that Tommy you make yourself
[15:09] available to him and he opens his work
[15:10] to you and you just lay yourself out
[15:12] there and say lord I speak to me and
[15:14] then is pray and read and study and open
[15:16] your minds to the Lord just tell me then
[15:25] another game of name that preacher
[15:28] everybody really they got a time
[15:30] allotted to their life you don't know
[15:33] how much time that God has given you but
[15:37] you have a set amount of time you're
[15:38] here on earth which is why the Bible
[15:40] says redeem the time you want to
[15:42] maximize that the time that you're given
[15:45] here on earth to make as efficient as
[15:47] possible
[15:48] this process the new verse we should be
[15:52] giving everything that we have
[15:54] everything we are to God so that he can
[15:56] come so that he can make this work
[15:58] manifest in us because just like in this
[16:01] little one God is transforming us to
[16:03] take us from darkness into life who
[16:06] might have said that one of our five
[16:07] ministers gasps waking up Oh baa baa
[16:16] black sheep baa black sheep I'll form a
[16:29] firmly believe really in all seriousness
[16:31] I really believe what these learner
[16:32] brand tongues will pass the full
[16:33] redemption body that is here
[16:37] Christ is in these men speaking to us
[16:39] I'm not exhorting the men I'm just
[16:41] telling you that listen closely what I
[16:43] say what they're saying this was they
[16:45] were seven he started that was the
[16:47] beginning that series in here on birth
[16:50] pangs okay that was a really good
[16:57] there's a little nugget hidden in there
[17:03] [Music]
[17:05] all right this is just food for thought
[17:07] if you're not interested enough in the
[17:10] word now to sit down and study and pray
[17:13] meditate listen and read the sermon how
[17:16] do you think you'll be suddenly
[17:17] interested in the message of cheer we
[17:19] receive in eternity
[17:20] y'all ever given thought to that you say
[17:22] well my body's gonna be changed I'm
[17:23] going to be fully redeem oh all of a
[17:25] sudden I'll have all this desire for the
[17:27] Lord then I don't know about that I
[17:29] think the Bible says to set your
[17:31] affections on things above and that
[17:32] tells me it's within our realm of
[17:34] possibility he didn't say how to keep it
[17:36] to your stature because you know we can
[17:37] he said anything the Lord asks us to do
[17:40] should be perfect rhyme perfect if he
[17:43] asked us to do those things then it's
[17:44] possible right so that's a reflection on
[17:48] things of both so that's something we
[17:50] can do that's something in our part that
[17:52] we can intentionally
[17:53] set our affections on things above all
[17:57] right can we do that but everything just
[17:58] make her all right second Thessalonians
[18:01] 2:10 I think we're the way to refer to
[18:03] this a while back I think I wrote it
[18:06] down work for with all disable asan
[18:08] unrighteousness in them that perish
[18:10] because they received not the love of
[18:12] the truth that they might be saved we
[18:15] have to have the love of the truth we
[18:17] have to you ever heard some I administer
[18:18] stand up and say well I just love this
[18:20] quote or I just love that scripture you
[18:22] know they're falling in love with the
[18:23] Lord and I have certain scriptures or
[18:25] certain quotes that I literally love and
[18:27] I love to think on those things but you
[18:29] know that's unless we're falling in love
[18:30] with the Lord and that's part of it from
[18:33] the seventh rib cages the pattern
[18:34] Serge's the triptych book it is the
[18:38] morning star that is visible and a lot
[18:41] of the Sun commences to shine when our
[18:43] Sun Jesus comes there will be no further
[18:46] native messengers he will bring us his
[18:48] message of chair himself and as he rules
[18:52] his kingdom and we live in his presence
[18:54] the light of the word will become
[18:55] brighter and brighter our perfect day
[18:57] what else the widow's are above Jesus
[18:59] himself is he not everything even
[19:01] perfect everything he that hath an ear
[19:04] let him hear what the Spirit says to the
[19:05] churches
[19:06] Amen even so Lord God by thy spirit let
[19:08] us hear that truth
[19:10] but I especially wanted to emphasize the
[19:12] message of tear that's why I was talking
[19:13] about
[19:20] can you put a price tag on eternal life
[19:23] if you sacrifice worldly pleasures
[19:27] consecrate your life to Christ read
[19:29] listen and pray constantly do you
[19:31] suppose to look back from eternity with
[19:33] remorse about your consecrated life here
[19:36] on earth or regret I've ever Morris
[19:39] regret whatever would you look back from
[19:40] a fully redeemed body spirit and soul
[19:42] say in the future home and so I wish I
[19:44] spent more time on Facebook while I
[19:46] could or spend more time here is Almanac
[19:49] might really they'll says or or whatever
[19:51] you name the thing that to keep it's
[19:52] hindering you or spend more time
[19:54] cleaning the toilet the bathroom plate
[19:56] in the kitchen whatever it is that keeps
[19:58] you from the Lord that keeps you from
[19:59] spending time with God would you look
[20:01] back from fully-rigged for redemption
[20:03] and say man I wish I hadn't spent all
[20:06] that time studying and I kind of have
[20:08] this idea that maybe I'll probably look
[20:09] back and say I wish I'd spent more time
[20:11] saying you can't put a price tag on
[20:13] eternal life that's answering my
[20:15] question you can't put a price tag on
[20:17] eternal life it's worth everything we
[20:20] could do is it worth its full body
[20:22] experience or redemption worth listening
[20:23] to a sermon twice five times ten times a
[20:26] hundred times if you have time or if you
[20:29] can make the time you know it run else's
[20:31] listening to such a such a sermon and
[20:33] you say well I heard that when years ago
[20:34] listen again it's right you know why not
[20:37] right and all of our summers that our
[20:39] priests hear these ministers here listen
[20:41] to again
[20:48] look 962 it Jesus said it to him
[20:51] no man having put his hand to the plow
[20:53] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[20:55] of God when we start our Christian
[20:58] journey we should give Christ are all no
[21:01] turning back like Lot's wife to worldly
[21:03] ideas and traditions care for the
[21:05] letters let's leave everything take up
[21:08] our cross and follow him
[21:17] here's another gang it looks like yeah
[21:20] I've named that preacher again there are
[21:23] so many of these little nuggets hidden
[21:25] in the message it's wonderful all of our
[21:27] schemes and our ideas and our classical
[21:30] buildups and all of our politics and all
[21:32] of our science and everything it's been
[21:34] proved that it's nonsense
[21:35] and then we pray for God to help us to
[21:38] intervene come in and do something for
[21:40] us and then when he does I just wonder
[21:43] if we'll be able to understand it if we
[21:44] will be able to receive it or would we
[21:46] even consider it in my seat humility
[21:49] written all the way across their humble
[21:51] simplicity right Christ hidden in
[21:53] simplicity because if we can miss it
[21:55] entirely so I think especially in this
[21:58] hour it but Hooves us to pay attention
[22:01] to what's happening and realize what's
[22:03] taking place anybody want to guess who
[22:06] said that blotchy yeah same
[22:14] [Music]
[22:16] same exact that last lesson itself as
[22:22] follow those knuckles do one more
[22:28] attribute that humans and sheep both
[22:30] share is strength in numbers for this
[22:33] reason humans including message
[22:35] believers tend to do what everyone else
[22:36] is doing and think they'll be okay and
[22:39] say God will have to accept us because
[22:41] there's so many a number how can you
[22:43] reject so many people I'll get to this
[22:46] one if I don't forget in a minute but
[22:47] it's like Catholicism you know there's a
[22:50] lot of Catholics and if we believe in
[22:51] strength in numbers we should just join
[22:52] the Catholics is it a lot more than or
[22:54] us there are people in the message that
[22:57] I've talked to that I crossed paths with
[23:00] about doctrine and so forth and
[23:02] especially about the River Jordan the
[23:04] seed doctrine and so forth and they
[23:07] would say something to me like what
[23:08] about brothers throwing so screwed
[23:10] they've got a hundred people if you if
[23:12] you're disagreeing with us and you got a
[23:13] bit you guys say they're wrong - and
[23:15] what about brother someone's so screwed
[23:16] in this other brother she made all the
[23:17] big name preachers are the message and
[23:19] said what about all that and I said well
[23:21] I'm just talking about me I just don't
[23:22] see what you're saying
[23:23] you know I defended but anyway you know
[23:27] and then they always think what about
[23:28] these great big batch numbers and that's
[23:30] exactly what she'd do she'd go running
[23:33] and this is the time to introduce that
[23:36] we all remember the last time I talked
[23:38] about sheep I've talked about this
[23:39] illustration where there was fifteen
[23:41] hundred sheep I think it was jumped off
[23:42] a cliff and five hundred of them died
[23:45] the first 500 or so died and then they
[23:48] made a nice pillow for the other
[23:49] thousand for following up so they got
[23:51] entrance but they're the last thousand
[23:53] of them lived and but when she started
[23:56] off a cliff who knows why I think it was
[23:58] a butterfly trace now butterfly
[24:03] and everybody else go laughter no flaw
[24:06] apparently no thought process no
[24:08] vertical thinking is this really wise
[24:09] it's just I'm a sheep I'm instinctively
[24:12] gonna follow everybody else and go back
[24:14] my way and you know and what if some of
[24:17] these false stalkers some of these
[24:18] feel-good dolphins are started by
[24:20] somebody just because it feels good and
[24:22] it sounds good and it's too good sounds
[24:25] too good to not be true and they don't
[24:26] really research it and they don't really
[24:27] check it out the messages in the Bible
[24:29] and then all of a sudden they start
[24:30] gaining like a snowball effects or a
[24:32] gain of momentum because more and more
[24:33] people start to say that does feel good
[24:35] that sound good and more more people
[24:37] start running with and before you know a
[24:38] vast multitude of people are following
[24:40] this little silly idea and right off
[24:43] into death and all they started because
[24:46] we're that sheep nature that sheep
[24:48] instinct that we just follow the leader
[24:49] you know I can't strength in numbers
[24:55] this one brother Dale also said listen
[24:58] to well back I think you must be born
[25:00] again that the people might know that
[25:05] not rest upon some little experience
[25:08] they had but to rest song only on their
[25:10] day-by-day life how they live in the
[25:13] times when they're in church and how
[25:15] they live when the great strain comes on
[25:17] the outside there they flee to the cross
[25:19] for help my trouble arises or do they
[25:21] walk in their own spirit and their own
[25:23] thoughts did they rob back when the
[25:25] round upon is that's the question but
[25:27] and when we see that it's totally
[25:29] impossible for any of us to save their
[25:31] that the God has made an appropriate way
[25:33] and all sufficient sacrifice and it's
[25:35] the only way that we can come not by any
[25:38] church or in created domination a
[25:40] sensation but by the way of Christ
[25:45] so you know I was talking about the
[25:48] testimony while ago about Gabby giving
[25:50] her you know she was concerned as to
[25:52] whether or not she's really born again
[25:54] you know she could have looked to all
[25:56] the things there's been a lot of changes
[25:57] I've watched her over the years she and
[25:59] I live to go she could watch me closely
[26:01] hanbyul can and I can watch her very
[26:02] closely and save her progressing and I
[26:05] think she can be you've come a long way
[26:07] you do have the Holy Ghost but I'm not
[26:09] going to spend it away and so you've got
[26:11] it you just sit down now you can just go
[26:12] ahead and sit down and get on Facebook
[26:14] no I'd say keep on going that's not
[26:22] we're not black sheep in it is there any
[26:41] questions about that one comment though
[26:45] sir you might be too young I remember
[26:48] Jim Jones with a good example that's
[26:50] right yeah yeah
[26:55] yeah man let me think on me I forgot
[26:58] very cozy I'll bring that Goulet
[27:00] [Music]
[27:12] so far no good
[27:16] the second
[27:28] humility so the objective on this lesson
[27:32] I'm trying to get through the first few
[27:33] slides of this one it's mostly quotes at
[27:35] the front of this one and then we'll try
[27:38] it on the next lesson to finish the last
[27:41] half of this so the objective is to
[27:44] understand what it means to humble
[27:46] ourselves before the Lord very simple
[27:50] humble the definition having or showing
[27:53] a modest or low estimate of one's own
[27:57] importance second Chronicles 7:14 if my
[28:02] people which are called by my name shall
[28:04] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[28:07] face and turn from their wicked ways
[28:09] then will I hear from heaven and will
[28:11] forgive their sin and will heal their
[28:14] land
[28:14] I know other ways to talk about it you
[28:16] know there's an importance about the
[28:17] land
[28:17] you know of Israel or Jerusalem and so
[28:20] forth but you know in our day we could
[28:22] look at that and say well what about our
[28:24] body change you know God is concerned
[28:27] about this lamb about our earth he wants
[28:30] to redeem us by spirit and soul
[28:34] the humble is a Psalm 69 32 the humble
[28:37] shall see this and be glad and your
[28:39] heart shall live that seek God a lot of
[28:45] these things won't tie them to my last
[28:46] lesson - just a just a little bit
[28:48] variation of Isaiah 57 for thus saith
[28:52] the high lofty one that inhabiteth
[28:53] eternity whose name is holy i dwell in
[28:57] the high and holy place with him also
[28:59] that is of a contract which means like
[29:02] penitent horny and humble spirit to
[29:05] revive the spirit of the humble and to
[29:08] revive the heart of the contract ones
[29:12] matthew 18 for whosoever therefore shall
[29:14] humble himself as this little child the
[29:16] same is greatest in the kingdom of
[29:18] heaven Matthew
[29:20] 23:12 and whosoever shall exalt himself
[29:23] should be abased and he that shall
[29:25] humble himself shall be exalted James
[29:30] 4:6 but he giveth more grace wherefore
[29:34] he saith God resisteth the proud but
[29:36] giveth grace unto the humble James 4:10
[29:39] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[29:41] Lord and he shall lift you up
[29:47] 1st Peter 5:5 likewise ye younger submit
[29:50] yourselves unto the elder yea all of you
[29:53] be subject one to another and then
[29:56] Clubman be clothed with humility for God
[29:58] resisteth the proud and giveth grace to
[30:01] the humble there's really nothing the
[30:02] Lord can do with you when you're proud
[30:03] when you're lifted up in Revelation or
[30:05] not revelation I mean when you're lifted
[30:07] up in your own self and your own ideas
[30:09] and so forth today in the next verse
[30:12] humble yourselves therefore under the
[30:14] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[30:17] in due time
[30:19] well thank you do Commodus think there's
[30:21] another answer for Gaby because she's
[30:23] waiting on their birth and so but she
[30:27] says she's staying humble before the
[30:28] Lord so that he may exalt her and do
[30:31] time in his season is coming and then we
[30:34] got the Strong's definition for humbled
[30:38] or humility which everyone to abase let
[30:45] me just start you might love to bring
[30:47] low to level reduced to a plane to bring
[30:51] to a humble condition reduce reduce to
[30:53] meaner circumstances to assemble lower
[30:55] rank or place to to a base to be ranked
[30:59] below others who are honored or rewarded
[31:01] to humble or based muscle myself by
[31:04] humble living to lower the press of
[31:07] one's soul bringing down once pride to
[31:11] have a monster peanut oneself to behave
[31:13] in an unassuming manner devoid of all
[31:15] haughtiness
[31:21] three bass cast down home tests down
[31:25] humble of low degree estate lowly and
[31:28] then not rising far from the ground as a
[31:31] condition lowly of low degree brought
[31:33] low with grief depressed lowly in spirit
[31:35] humble and a bass sense supporting one's
[31:38] self object Lee I know there's a lot of
[31:46] definitions but that's just spitballing
[31:49] the next one
[31:54] there are many misconceptions about what
[31:56] it means to be humble humble is often
[31:59] often thought to mean sample or shallow
[32:02] this is calm this common thought may
[32:04] late to slothfulness toward God as was
[32:07] once stated by brother Dan I'm going on
[32:09] memory here okay I think this actually
[32:12] came from sister Peggy
[32:13] you might remember if you said this or
[32:15] not this is a paraphrase but when when
[32:17] she preached there is a difference
[32:25] between simplicity and stupidity
[32:38] anyway there's never explained
[32:41] simplicity and stupidity you know people
[32:43] walk around and hold their head down
[32:44] sign just don't understand all that's
[32:48] just over my head what's not over your
[32:50] head if you just get into my study on
[32:56] the contrary to humble ourselves before
[32:59] God can mean many things but perhaps the
[33:01] best summation of these is to submit our
[33:04] whole life to Jesus Christ as my
[33:08] definition this includes prayer
[33:10] meditation servitude fastings studying
[33:13] listening and many other acts of love
[33:15] and obedience many people may feel that
[33:19] to be humble means that we should not
[33:21] study because we are trying to figure
[33:23] things out on our own like Eve did
[33:24] instead of waiting on God this is a nice
[33:27] conception about humility reading
[33:30] studying and listening to sermons it's
[33:32] not a way of trying to figure things out
[33:33] our own stay in the Word of God is
[33:35] actually necessary for us to in order
[33:37] for God to reveal his word to us it's a
[33:39] part of our reasonable service let's
[33:41] read that they're true I'm a seeker
[33:44] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[33:45] to present your bodies a living
[33:46] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[33:49] is your reasonable service and be not
[33:51] conformed to this world but be
[33:52] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[33:54] how can you do that much to take on the
[33:56] mind of Christ and how can you do that
[33:59] unless you're in the word so that you
[34:02] may prove what is that good acceptable
[34:03] and perfect will or work of God for I
[34:07] say through the grace given unto me to
[34:10] every man that is among you not to think
[34:13] of himself more highly than he ought to
[34:14] think but to think soberly according as
[34:18] God hath dealt to every man the measure
[34:19] of faith
[34:20] so thank home bleh of your own self
[34:25] a village meeting some great names
[35:48] if these guys got change the clothes fit
[35:52] Spencer around
[35:54] that's the guy the thing don't we do the
[36:00] right thing ha be right back
[36:04] break it up Vivek you think you're the
[36:08] great person great is his humility
[36:13] forget that
[36:15] I tell you why you do it not dumb I
[36:38] don't think ahead
[36:40] that's real humility Jesus told us how
[36:45] to do it you overcome be overcome to
[36:50] stand the test but Jesus did mr. Alden
[36:59] the enemy is the best everything he was
[37:04] testing him he stood the base of
[37:08] sickness done okay we're pretty close to
[37:14] the time to go upstairs so let's just go
[37:16] ahead there any questions comments
[37:23] [Music]
