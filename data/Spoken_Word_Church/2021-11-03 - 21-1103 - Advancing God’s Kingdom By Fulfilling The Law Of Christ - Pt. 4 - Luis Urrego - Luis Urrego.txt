TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] in christ alone will i glory so i can pride myself in battle swan [Music] for i've been blessed beyond measure and by his strengths alone i overcome oh i could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies are not equal to the grace by which i stand in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength and my source of hope is christ's [Music] in christ alone will i glory for only by his grace i am redeemed and only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my need now i seek no greater honor than just to know him more than to count my gains but losses to the glory of my lord in [Music] i christ my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength and my source of hope in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be sad of me my source of strength

praise the lord jesus why don't we give the lord a clap of praise amen [Applause] amen you happy to be in the house of god this afternoon amen i trust i hope so amen i'm happy to be here with you and uh just thank god for his mercy and his grace that he's bestowed unto us once again amen another privilege another day to have been able to serve him remember every day that goes by is an opportunity that you shouldn't miss that's right and it's an opportunity that he's given us a man to draw closer to him for him to glorify himself through our through our uh our lives amen and not just to uh receive a blessing but to also be a blessing and so we that's why we come here this evening amen to to do that amen praise the lord jesus um we just thank god everything went well amen during the camp and we had a good time uh believe it or not i had i had a really good batch of 15 year old boys i mean they went to bed when i told them to go to bed they got up when i told them to get up they they were awesome and from the most part uh that i heard everybody just they were just they they they were just wonderful all the young people and i believe our young people here from our church they they they represented us well amen so most and foremost represented god well amen and so i trust that they receive something from the lord and and and something that they can take for them with them amen the rest of their lives amen so that's the most important thing and we just thank once again brother dale for allowing the opportunity amen to let to let them go um and uh just thank god for those those moments you know that you take advantage of because you'll never get them back amen you never get them back you know we can look forward to next year but we don't know if next year is going to be here you see we don't know we don't know but uh you look at what has happened and you cherish those moments amen cherish those times and uh most and foremost amen let those times amen be a stepping stone for you to grow closer to god amen praise god so let's uh let's go to the word this this evening and we want to turn to the book of john chapter 15. john chapter 15 we're going to start reading in verse 8. i want to i want to preach this evening on the last the last part of that little series that we were talking about advancing god's kingdom by fulfilling the law of christ and this is this is part four amen and uh for a subtitle i i just have it as god's new world order established amen so uh we hear that word a lot and we've been hearing it for many years you know the new world order the new world order you hear presidents talking about the new world order let me tell you god had a new world order already in mind amen before even they even started talking about it they're looking at it from a from a physical kingdom that's going to be established here and that they're going to live forever throughout eternal life not outside of the word that's what they're looking at but we have eternal life amen that was in him before the foundation of the world amen that's the true eternal life and that's the is that's the new world order that he wants to establish in us first that therefore it can be manifested physically amen has to be established in us first before it can be established here on earth amen so so that that is that is what we're looking at a man satan all can satan can do is just copy he can only mimic what god has already said in his word praise god so we just thank god for that so let's let's just um let's read john chapter 15 verse 8. it says herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments amen if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love notice that the central theme here is love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full amen verse 12. this is my commandment now look what he brings them down this is my commandment right that ye love one another he he did not say this is my suggestion this is my commandment in order this is something you must do especially as being part of the body of christ that ye love one another as i have loved you right greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends in other words if you can't die for your brother or your friend you don't really love them the way you say you love them but he did that for us not just for one person he did it for even people that would not even serve him amen praise god you are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you amen and that's verse 17 these things i command you that ye love one another he repeats it again and then we'll we'll turn to galatians chapter six verse two galatians chapter six verse two and it says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ the law of christ that we just read the commandment that we just read bear ye one another's burdens that in in i like the way it says it in in another version it says you obey the law of christ when you offer each other a helping hand amen praise the lord jesus well we're this ain't deep tonight but we need it because we like it we like it big time amen so let's just let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for another opportunity to serve you lord we appreciate lord god the the uh your word father god in its simplicity lord jesus if we could just take it father in in simplicity lord god it would just help us so much lord and lord jesus we ask that you to anoint father god the your word as it goes forth anoint the lips lord god that's speaking this evening i'm insufficient within myself lord but father god you are i can do all things through you lord i pray lord that you would bless the hearers here tonight meet every need that's amongst us be with brother richard sister and the lord as they're having health problems i ask that you would just be with them bless them raise them back up father god and lord jesus we just thank you once again for this opportunity to hear your word we ask these things now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated tonight praise the lord amen just just just as in a form of of a review you know we we we've covered uh quite a few quite a few things but uh mainly just trying to keep it centralized around love amen now we know that god doesn't love a man with affiliate love amen a failure love is love that is that comes and goes and it's the love that you may have for your for your wife for the love that you may have for your husband the love that that i have for my daughter you see or or or anyone or you or love that you might have for your pet but you know what if something changes amen that love sometimes changes amen what's that brother or that sister they do something you don't like or you didn't like the way they spoke to you amen that love could change amen but at agape love amen that love should not change because that's the love that god loves us with and therefore since it's eternal amen it sticks [Laughter] it sticks it's eternal amen don't you like something that that sticks when you're trying to to glue something you know on and and using that gorilla glue you know or something like that and you know that if you use good some good glue you know it's going to stick something's going to stay and it should stay there forever pretty much right and then but when you're using some cheap glue you know and then just just falling apart you know that that's that's like a filial love but agape love sticks like gorilla glue or more amen so just so that's the kind of love that we want to love with amen praise god and so and so jesus here is bringing this commandment to us amen and he's trying as we were looking there in the in in john chapter 13 and we read through the whole chapter and how that chapter types i believe i see you know our day in that chapter every every every way you know from judas and and every part of it but you notice that after judas left the scene he left the table amen that's when jesus amen started revealing things to them that he would not reveal while judas was there so in this day saints we have to have our judases leave the scene amen and they're still leaving the scene by the droves amen so as they're leaving the scene amen god is revealing himself even further amen to his bride amen and remember he said uh he said he didn't say great flock he said little flock amen this isn't going to be a a a a great thing a mega mega church type thing amen this is going to narrow down to something very very small of a small minority amen and it's that small minority amen that right now amen is in the process of of stomping satan on the head amen that's overcoming in this hour because i believe god said that he would have overcomers in this hour and i believe that's just you and me amen that's you and me overcomers in this hour young and old amen we are overcoming in this hour amen how do you say well the old people how are they overcoming amen they're overcoming amen because one day they're going to get a body change amen and that will be the final overcoming amen the overcoming of death amen praise the lord you're looking forward to that brother dale right amen i'm looking forward to and i'm much younger than than him but i sir look amen we won't be breaking fingers anymore we wouldn't be we won't be uh uh getting sick anymore we won't be amen it'll just be it'll just be perfect amen total complete no death amen no worrying about anything else amen oh my i'm looking forward to that praise god amen and it's happening right now and god's establishing that right now and you and i amen praise the lord jesus amen so so god amen so jesus brings in this new commandment now you ask amen did god then god give us the commandments amen he gave them the commandments in the old testament praise the lord but guess what at the beginning of the commandments amen he talks about love love right he said love love uh love um what is the first commandment love god amen and love thy neighbor as thyself amen so that is what god is trying to bring us amen because let me tell you things remember when brother branham went behind the curtain of time remember that what what did he say he said nothing will get there without perfect love nothing that's right in other words nobody will get there without perfect love and if you don't have the one that represented perfect love perfectly amen inside of you amen truly loving your brother the way you should love them truly loving your sister the way you should love them amen then you're not going to get there i i'm sorry i'm bringing bad news to you amen but that's the truth you ain't going to be there paul because the the the love has to be in you amen work in itself on the outside amen do you realize that it's got to be love working from the inside out amen this is going to change our bodies what's at the top amen it's going to be it's going to be perfect love that's going to call the saints amen from the grave amen so if it's not working in us right now if we're just church goers if we're just oh you know we're just taking every then then we got to seek that perfect love we've got to seek and what is perfect love it's the holy spirit it's the word amen it's what he is amen he is love praise god amen so i want him a man to change me from the inside out more and more amen i i want to love the way he loves amen i i want to i want to care amen the way he cares i want to be able to see the way he sees us amen we fail him many times and we make many mistakes amen and yet he still died for each and every one of us amen he died not just for our sins but he died for even for our iniquities and we talked about iniquity amen and iniquity is is doing what you're supposed to not doing what you know that you're supposed to do amen or doing what what's the other way the other thing i get it confused sometimes doing that it's knowing that it's not right yeah that that's the other things amen so that is what iniquity is amen praise god so let's just let's just uh let's just continue amen here um uh let me go down here to my notes this is my whole the whole chapter the whole series here all in one place amen praise god amen so let's uh let's read here in amen in john chapter 15 yes john chapter 15 amen in verse 8 which which we just read amen he says here herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you and he says continue ye in my love amen if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments amen praise god you see our lord jesus christ was our example amen obviously he was god amen he came here to live out this life before you and i did amen the head amen had to live it out first before the body could follow amen praise god so therefore he has given us this commandment amen to to love amen to love each other amen as he has loved us amen praise god this is verse 12 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you amen now brother branham says here in in in this in christ the mystery of god revealed and we're i i just want to i feel like reading this this quote again because i believe is just so important amen and sometimes we just overlook it but he says here and and it's a very familiar quote to us he says love one another above everything amen love of one another above everything it doesn't matter what anybody has done to you amen it doesn't matter what has happened amen you love because you failed christ more than anybody than anything anybody's ever done to you that's just a simple fact you failed him every day remember last time we talked about amen every time that you fail him amen that is the nail that you're continually driving in his hands amen i believe there's even a song like that do you feel the nails amen that that you're driving in his hands and his feet amen you say i doubt i never did that amen but it was our sins that put him there it was our sins that put him on the cross and it was your iniquities that put him there amen praise the lord so why couldn't we not love one another the way he wants us to love one another when he's given everything that we that he has he's done everything that he could for us amen praise god so he said brother brown says here love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say amen now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way amen satan amen something that will happen amen that will cause friction that will cause a man for people to scatter amen it happened in even at the time of jesus when he was again when he was that when he was gonna gonna die amen the incident that took place amen when jesus was about to when he was going before pilate amen what happened to the disciples they were gone and we and peter said i'll never leave you i'll never leave you lord amen i'll be right there with you and he didn't even want to listen to jesus's own words that told him before the crow three times you're going to deny me oh i don't believe that by his actions he didn't believe what jesus said but did it happen the bible says it did it happened that's what happens amen with church splits and problems and things like that amen what happens amen the pastor leaves the scene or something like that amen there's no steadfastness in people anymore that's the reason why you have to be amen you have to know god for your own self i cannot amen i i can't i cannot depend on brother dale for my for my spiritual walk on a daily basis i've got to have my own walk with with with christ amen you young people amen you've got to know him for your own self what happens with your prayer if your parents aren't on the scene anymore but what are they what if god takes them both what are you going to do it's got to be a relationship between you and christ god's the one who sent you here god's the one who who birthed you in this in this in this world amen and he's gonna the one who's gonna finish leading you through whether your parents are still around whether the pastor's still around amen he's the one who's going to be leading and guiding us amen praise god he's the one who's going to take us amen to the end he's the one who's going to establish the kingdom amen in our hearts amen that's right and eventually be physical kingdom amen praise god so no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning brother branham speaking see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his this target his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it amen he said don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another you got to remember if you want to love the way he's telling him about here you got to have the love in you his loving you amen otherwise you won't love people right the way you'll come to church and you know you'll shake hands but you won't love them the right way and you can tell people hey man when they just don't want to be around you or like you amen you just see it i mean and even the way they greet you you just you can tell that's fine amen just let let god deal with you amen i'll just pray for you i'll pray for you pray for that man see but look what brother brown said pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another amen and stay with your pastor amen praise the lord see he's the shepherd and you give him respects no matter how much he offended you amen on the last sermon amen no matter what he said or no matter amen he's your pastor praise god if you have a problem amen you just go right talk with him directly amen praise god don't go don't go blaring around the church amen praise god and stay with your pastors he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and cause he's ordained of god to do so all right do you believe brahma was a prophet of god amen do you believe what he's saying amen amen i do do now do you now do you remember that congregation says amen the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together amen my goodness if if churches a man would have taken this to consider it there probably would have been less splits in in the message amen less problems in the message amen if they were to just heed these words amen but you see they put their eye on man sometimes instead of the holy spirit instead of god amen the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all amen don't ever clan among one or or talk make yourself clannish amen in other words the little group say man well you can't be part of our group amen you you don't know you know our type of talk you know our our conversation the way we say things you know the the little hidden meanings amen you don't know anything about that amen so you can't be part of our group amen but brother brown says here don't be clannish that's what a clan is they have their own handshake they have their own way of doing things amen but he said don't be clanders you just love everybody amen everybody's included amen you you put me out of your circle i'll just email just make the circle bigger amen praise god don't ever clan among one or talk make yourself clannish we are one now what is jesus christ trying to bring us to amen we'll read john 17 here in just a moment amen but what is he trying to bring us to to a unity a oneness amen of love i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand or you don't preach the way i like you to preach you know i i'm adding that in he's my left hand i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want i want to stay right there amen i certainly do i broke my finger my pinky finger this past weekend and my you don't know how important a pinky is when you lose weight when you lose it when you lose a body part that's how you realize i needed that body part for real amen we'll just we'll we'll we'll add something there about that here in just a moment amen amen don't ever uh where we're at even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another now as we're reading this hey man ask yourself is this what i'm doing is this the attitude that i have am i willing to give up my life for my brother or my sister whether whatever they said to me or whatever they did or did not do to me that i did or didn't like are you willing to give up your life for him or her ask yourself those questions because that's what isn't that what jesus just commanded us to do did we just read that amen amen and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the church of god how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers amen some people start cringing when we start getting to this part of the quote i'm sorry but it's the truth brother brown said it don't stay home especially in this day that we're living in if you don't if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days he said that in 1963 amen how much more in 2021 where the bible exhorted us to much more as we see that they approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and christ jesus love and love one another this will all man know you are my disciples and we just read this right when you got love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness springing up how important is that because i'll it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of your life you think you think that when you have bitterness against somebody that's that's towards that person and you're not realizing that that's eating you also from the inside out you think oh it's just towards that person you know he's the one that needs to be right he she's the one that needs to get right she's the one that's wrong amen but in doing that you're being eaten up spiritually from the inside out amen lord don't ever let me have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then god will bless you amen praise god i'll be the first one to say lord i i i want that amen sometimes how easy it is amen for us to just slip up and say demeaning things amen towards one another or about was one another amen and out of a joke and then you know in your heart you feel condemned but because you think it makes somebody laugh amen you just go right out and say well let me tell you amen that takes the spirit of christ out of the whole thing amen amen it's how serious it is it's serious amen praise god so brother branham that was brother branham's warning amen for us here in the end time amen praise the lord now let's let's why don't we read john chapter 17 amen and this is this is the uh this is what i wanted to get to and we'll read it quickly but i i encourage you a man to read this chapter on your own and just really look at it because let me tell you if you want to know where i mean how many knows that jesus prayed for you this is the chapter where jesus prayed for you and he prayed for you he interceded for you and you were not even born you were not even on the scene and he was already interceding for you as a matter of fact it gets even better he was he he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world amen and here he is a man he's about to pray not just for his disciples but he's also going to pray for you amen and so let's just see what he says because remember what a high priest does amen a high priest what he did was intercede he was the one who was to go back into the into into the the holiest holies amen to give that blood to sprinkle that blood on the mercy seat where he was the one who was supposed to do it nobody else was supposed to do it amen and i'm sure the people the israelites out there amen they were thankful that they weren't the ones who had to do it amen they provided the sacrifice amen but the blood of that sacrifice amen had to be amen be put in the back in the in the holiest of holies by the whole by the priest amen why because if they didn't do it the right way if they didn't go exactly the way god told them to do it the high priest would do it they would die they would die and so jesus amen he is our high priest amen and he is here interceding for us amen and not just not just then amen he continues to intercede amen praise god he continues to intercede so jesus prayed for us amen interceded for us uh even before you were here on earth physically you were in his mind but he prayed for you amen so let's just let's just read here amen in john chapter 17 he says here these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven amen and you just do your best to stay awake amen amen praise god just concentrate on the word amen amen wake yourselves up amen concentrate on what he said look he's just he prayed for you amen that's wonderful amen amen i always love this scripture amen it gives me encouragement amen that jesus the creator of heaven and earth amen the one who created me prayed for me amen praise god this is his prayer amen amen let's try to stay awake amen these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hours come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee amen as we're reading we'll we'll comment a little bit on verses here and there but uh we won't be able to we could do a whole comment on the whole thing and it would just be here all night as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him amen that's you and me included in there amen if you've got eternal life and this is life eternal what is eternal life amen that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent now you can you can look at that and think oh my that that's that that's that's the second person of the trinity that's two in the godhead no it's the same person amen it's the same person amen the only true god in jesus christ whom thou has sent verse 4 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou has given me to do right he's praying to his father amen he's telling him lord i've done what you've told me to do amen he has a son amen came down here as a son amen and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was amen praise god which he was he was that glory he is that god amen amen in other words lord jesus take me back amen i'm getting ready to head back to the father amen back to the mike the my original condition amen i have manifested thy name unto the man which thou gavest me out of the world amen he's talking about his disciples here thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word right the disciples believed the word all the way they stayed with jesus so they believed now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send send me i pray for them ah i pray for them he see jesus christ is right here praying for them jesus christ is right here praying for them and the disciples were were just a few yards away just sleeping and and here's the lord praying for them amen i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine amen i pray not for the cosmos amen that the world the the word world here is the word greek word cosmos amen in other words i don't pray for this this world order amen amen i don't pray for the what's currently going i don't i don't pray for the president amen i i'm not praying amen i'm praying amen for them amen i don't pray for satan's kingdom amen saints kingdom will fall i mean brother branham said himself i don't even pray for america anymore they rejected christ and so everything that's happening now is just amen the consequences of them rejecting christ a long time ago it's just taken little by little eventually it's it's coming to a culmination i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to the holy father keep through thine own name those whose that those whom thou has given me that they may be one amen as we are there he is talking about that was the that was the goal amen right that they may be one as we are while i was with them right while i was walking with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that is judas amen that the scripture might be fulfilled amen and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world you see saints amen when you really receive the word of god in your life and the word of god is making a change in your life amen amen you the world will despise you the world will hate you the world does not love those that are not their own amen they don't like those amen that condemn them by their life sometimes you even you sisters amen even you brothers as you're walking by people amen we had to stop by uh petsmart this this afternoon right before we came to church amen and uh uh you know i had my my suit and and everything like that and you could just you just tell people i mean it's kind of weird going into petsmart with a suit on you know the coat on and a tie normally people are dragging with their sandals and they're in their slippers you know and they're jogging pants with their dog you know in there amen but when they see somebody wearing a suit and tie and they look at you and it's almost like they kind of look down you know it's like i'm like man you get that kind of respect i'll just wear a suit and tie everywhere you know okay i just kind of looked down you know and i didn't say one word to them you know and say one word to them but you see sisters you do that also when you walk around with your long hair amen people people feel it women feel it they feel condemned there's like there's a condemnation there amen that's good let your life speak more than words amen praise god i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should us take them out of the world amen see sayings god doesn't want to take you out of the world doesn't want to take doesn't want to take the trials and the tribulations out from you you're not going to be a trial and tribulation free when you become a christian when you become a christian the trials and tribulations multiply they just it's like a crank amen we'll just crank them up a little bit more amen okay amen it's gonna come even more those trials and tribulations but he says here i i i'm not taking you're not going to be taken out of the world you're not going out easy amen this is a struggle this is a fight this is not a picnic amen we all know that praise god i i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil amen amen praise god in other words have that how do you keep from the evil amen have that armor of god amen amen be fortified with the armor of god they are not of the world amen even as i am not of the world that's why the people couldn't understand his speech i sanctify them through thy truth and remember pilate asked what is truth but that's what truth is amen thy word is truth amen paula asked one time before jesus when jesus stood before him what is truth and the truth was standing right there in front of him amen thy word is truth because why he is the word amen as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes watch and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth aren't you thankful that jesus christ did that he sanctified himself in other words he held he he held himself amen he could have had a wife he could have had children amen he was a man he was a man just like every other man that was living at that time but he held himself from even doing those things in order amen that that the the disciples could be sanctified amen through the truth amen now watch this verse 20. neither pray i for these alone not just for the disciples but for them also which shall believe on me through their word amen praise god amen in other words i don't pray just for the disciples i'm praying for the ones that will believe the word that the disciples preached to them amen and what happened with the word throughout the ages amen from the disciples it came to other people from those people and on down amen and we got seven church ages and finally has come down to us that same word that same prayer amen is being fulfilled even right now in our lives in 2021 and he was praised over 2000 years ago amen that's the reason saints amen when you pray amen when you pray that you think oh god is not hearing my prayer amen but let me tell you god is hearing your prayer amen it's just he knows exactly when to come in and answer it he sometimes there's there's battles do you remember when even when when when uh uh uh gabriel amen was uh daniel was praying and even gabriel i believe was gabriel was being fought amen by the prince of persia amen there was there was a hindrance there amen 21 days gabriel didn't come in to answer daniel's prayers but daniel stayed true amen daniel stayed firm amen daniel stayed steadfast praying amen praise god and finally the prayer was answered amen sometimes we may we may think oh god didn't answer our prayer because it wasn't the way we wanted it to be but it's god answers our prayers no matter how much you think he's not listening he is he's ready to hear his his children amen he's ready to hear his child amen every time you open your mouth before him amen he's right there listening amen he tells the angels be quiet shut up amen my child is praying amen yes sir this is important and you pray you do your part and then he might answer it right away or he might take two years to answer it he might take 15 years to answer it but he never forgot your prayer he's not like us amen brother comes to us and brother pray for me amen brother i got such and such a need yeah yeah we'll pray about it amen and then you forget about it and you don't remember amen until the following week oh i forgot brother said but but that that that whole thing he asked you to pray for it was already done i guess i'm the only one that happens to so you know what i do now somebody tells me to pray let's pray right now let's pray right now amen let's just get it taken care of right now amen then you won't forget because what we're doing is we're lying it or not yeah i'll pray for you brother yes sister we'll be praying for that a whole year goes by and we don't pray so so we we let our yeas be gays and our nays benays the bible says amen praise the lord neither i pray for these alone but for them which also shall believe on me through their word watch that they all may be one look at that that is what he was praying for for for us here in 2021 that we all may be one that we all may have good businesses and a nice job and a great family nice suv outside and there that's not what he was praying for he was praying that we all may be one amen amen praise god because that's eternal amen your car is not eternal your job is not eternal amen nothing amen in this life that's part of satan's kingdom will not will is not eternal amen but oneness true oneness and his love that's eternal loving one another amen that's eternal that they all may be one as thou father are in me watch and i in thee that they also may be one in us how can you be one with us amen with him amen by one spirit are you baptized amen in one body praise god that the world may believe that thou has sent me now how is the world going to believe that that that christ amen is god amen they're only going to believe it through you praise god that's what jesus just said that the world may believe that thou hast sent me it's through your life saints praise god and the glory which thou gave us me i have given them amen amen i have given them that they may be one watch he says it again that they may be one even as we are one it's a constant theme for for jesus even in this last day i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me do you realize saints that your life amen will will cause amen for those around us amen to to either be judged amen i mean they will be judged amen but to either amen be condemned or to be saved if they don't have eternal life our lives amen if they come amen through if if we stumble through our lives amen at the white throne judgment amen they will either be saved by what they did for us or not believe that praise god amen cup of water in my name jesus said what verse are we in verse 24 father i will i will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory praise the lord how many wants to behold his glory amen amen which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world amen they believe that he loved you before the foundation of the world amen o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these and these have known that thou has sent amen and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and i in them he finishes his prayer right there with what love so what is the new commandment amen that's what he's calling us for in this hour saints amen praise the lord so whenever you need some peace whenever you need some reassurance go back and read john chapter 17. amen that's where he prayed for us john chapter 13 tells us little children yet a little while i am with you you shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whether i go you cannot come so now i say to you a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have loved one to another amen praise god amen so you know brother branham said amen when he saw beyond the curtain of time nothing was going to go in there without perfect love praise god and you have to ask yourself amen am i loving the way he loves us am i am i am am i loving where am i faltering amen praise god where am i faltering at mormon praise the lord now in ephesians chapter four amen it tells us this we'll be we'll finish up here in just a moment ephesians chapter if i didn't give the brothers this but he says here paul says here but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ amen i was almost thinking you know it's the other day uh how and it might be a carnal thought but i mean you know christ is our is the head right and he can't he he had that picture taken there in in arizona and and and and that represented hoffman's head of christ amen and and we are his body amen and as we're awaiting saints amen as we are here laboring amen as we are here he's working through us amen laboring as the body amen the mind thinks the head thinks he is the central he's he's the central theme right without a brain you can't function you can't function without a brain amen he is our he is our he is our our brain amen praise god he is the brain of this body amen but it's in a glorious sense that one day amen this body will connect amen with that head amen because the bible says amen that we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen and we shall be uh taken up amen to meet him in the air to connect with that head in the air praise god it almost reminds me of kind of like when in the 80s i mean when i used to watch those transformer cartoons and things like that amen and you'd see you know those robots say man just connect them with one another amen you know just kind of things like that amen but it's going to be much good more glorious than that amen amen praise god and he's doing the transformation now the transformation has to be taking place from the from inside out to amen praise god aren't you glad he's transforming us from glory to glory amen just just through his word amen but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even christ watch this from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in what in love amen and it's and it's not a filial love it's agape love amen praise god amen amen so so like i was saying earlier we need our body parts amen i just said you know i lost uh playing basketball over the camp this weekend and i went to defend a little young man that i was playing with he was in my cabin went to try to swipe the ball away from him and i hit his arm and as i was hitting his arm my pinky bent up bent this way i didn't hear any cracking or anything like that i just thought that maybe it was just a spring but a spring but waited a few days and last night i got the uh the x-rays and sure enough it's broken right here on the side so you just remember me in prayer on that but but then you don't realize how important a pinky is until you lose it until you can't use it you see saints we don't realize how important each of one of us are in the body amen until one of us is gone i mean i i miss brother ray i miss brother dick i miss i miss brother marlowe i miss all these brothers that have passed even the churches that i've gone and and have and and have gone through the brothers that have passed away even even then i miss those people amen you you you you don't realize how important they were to the body or or how special they were until they're gone and you know if we could look at each other in that way amen they would help us to treat one another much better that we're at any moment amen or tomorrow amen one of us that might be in here right now mate hey brother such and such is gone i mean remember what happened with brother marlow he was here one sunday and then the following day i mean he gone and we don't take advantage of one another the way we should because we still sit there amen i'm upset at her and him for something that happened 30 years ago you're gonna answer for that one day you are you're going to answer for it for your own actions and for your attitudes towards people amen at church we're not talking about we're dealing with with a hypocrite out there we're talking about you're dealing with the body of christ the purchase of the blood amen and that's how we treat one another oh my keep preaching brother yeah so but you know when i'm missing i'm missing uh you know this is like this is my body you see and and i'm missing a pinky amen so now they got it they got it buddy-taped they got it buddy taped you see and my pinky failed me he's fallen he's not completely down but he's he's out of service right now but you see amen here comes uh my this finger was just fine i had no problem with this finger right and these are just fine but my other finger amen had to come to the rescue to kind of help it help it you see you see you know brother boyd may have faltered you see maybe he made a mistake maybe he did something he wasn't supposed to do amen amen don't don't knock him down even more don't don't don't don't do that amen he needs a friend he needs somebody to go talk to him he needs somebody to stay a little closer amen look how closer it is you see he needs somebody to stay closer so that he can get better amen don't knock him upside the head don't knock amen don't knock the young person upside the head they may be faltering they may have fallen amen just just get a little closer to them amen be a friend to them love them amen amen that is what my pinky is being loved right now you see amen but he's strong my other finger is strong you see but my pinky is receiving help right now amen and you see my other ones they're still you know they're doing they're doing what they're supposed to do and they're also helping really they're also helping my pinky too because they're cutting for the slack that my pinky is not doing at the moment you see what i couldn't grab i couldn't grab with my pinky man now i have to use my other ones amen to come and pitch in you see so it's not just you know one brother to go help one another brother amen you everybody has a body amen go minister to that brother or that sister amen you be you be a a a witness you be you be the one who lifts the brother up amen the bible tells us to do that and i believe saints said that is part of loving one another that is part of fulfilling the love of that law of christ amen that we just read about amen that's right that is what that that's what that is amen doesn't matter what the brother did that's right you pray for that brother if you can't minister for it if you can't minister to them amen you pray for them lord i may have the wrong attitude about it forgive me let me pray for them amen you'll do much more than with that amen then then talking about somebody then blasting them over the pulpit amen you'll do much better than just loving them amen and it'll be better for the whole body and whole because i'm going to tell you saints this i'm trusting this pink is going to get better amen this pink is going to and then and then i'm going to be able to just pray raise my hands praise them spread them all out amen just like this one and be back again amen been functioning fully amen in service praise god amen so that's what we need to do amen just love one another amen so we just want to finish it off with that saints and uh i encourage you to just go back read john chapter 17 amen and just just just take it just take it uh you know line by line amen and read it carefully amen and just ask yourself where am i failing at in loving my brother and my sister sure we may know things about one another that we don't like i mean yeah sure that's fine but he loves christ she loves christ right he wants to go to the same heaven you want to go to this she wants to go to the same haven that you want to go to amen so let us just lift one another up instead of amen bringing each other down amen you love the lord amen if you love the lord then you love me even if i said what i said amen i hope you love me amen amen because i didn't tell you anything outside of the word that's what christ did for us amen praise the lord let's stand to our feet and have the musicians come let's sing listen to sing that song um i wanna i wanna love the way i want to live the way he wants me to live amen kiev uh f yes amen do you want that saints i live the way how did he live he loved man do you even realize that he loved even the ones that were accusing him he loved pilate amen he loved the pharisees they were out there screaming for his blood saying lay his blood amen his blood come on us and over our children he's still loved now how much more can we love amen if a little if a brother just does a little something here and there he says something amen we can love more i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love till there's just no more love i could never ever i love the lord [Music] i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love till [Music] i want to live the way [Music] [Music] [Music] so we're going to believe

be ministering for a church in india i won't be going to india although they they they wanted me they want me to there's a brother i met back in 2006 back in brother gene williams church and his his name is brother angelus and i helped kind of drive him around taking the church and we just had a good fellowship and really good brother he came here to work for a season and then he left and just several years later he reached out to me and and we've been talking and they they had started a little church there in india in a in the little city called chennai and they wanted to have their first year anniversary so they want to they want me to preach their their first year anniversary um they got several guest ministers coming in but i'm going to be online preaching for them one of the nights so i'll be in my basement doing my thing [Laughter] preaching all the way in chennai to chennai so you remember us in your prayers i i got to meet some of the brothers the other night just wonderful people it's just simple just just really enjoy talking with them remember me and prayer that'll be on the 26th and then on the 30th we're going to be heading out for our seven week trip to to central america also remember this a saints that uh i've been working with brother barry coffey he is the pastor of hickory bible tabernacle in north carolina um and he's been helping he's gonna help me bring uh several a shipment of bibles there to honduras and also to nicaragua and other other places because he has a ministry called vision books and so he has connections to all these bible societies and all these different places so i've been working with him we're going to be trying to get uh like a whole palette of bible sold to honduras there's gonna they're gonna be shipping directly from honduras from a bible society there and so um um i haven't i don't know yet what the cost will be if there will even be a cost because he's donated already some bibles to me for me to take down there about 20 bibles they're on their way right now and uh that um that he that he him and his church donated to us so so i just appreciate that you remember that in prayer uh because uh in honduras in those countries they're actually more in need of bibles than they are of message books bibles are very very needed especially in the remote areas and so just remember that in your in your prayers as as if you feel led you know that you want to if you want to give something you know make it towards that and we'll get bibles there um the connections are there we just need the the funds so but you remember that in your prayers and i just appreciate brother barry's heart you know for for missions and for doing that that work you know that he's doing with the books just sending bibles and books all over the world you you know we think you know that that that we have tablets and everything like that and we don't need bible you know a physical bible but let me tell you people can't afford these things they can't afford a phone sometimes to read a bible they still look to physical books they need a physical bible and bibles in the cities are are much easier to get but those remote brothers in remote areas it's harder for them to even buy a bible we don't think of that so you remember that in prayer saints as we as we head down there november 30th amen again if nothing changes amen we'll be heading down there so all minds hearts clear anything remember bible study this this saturday at 6 00 p.m amen come join us amen and i believe that you'll be blessed and change your

you come maybe maybe they might help you to come pray 30 minutes early 30 minutes before service amen praise god love one another amen so let's just buy our heads our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to serve you lord to have a spoken father these words of life lord god we're unworthy of lord jesus but father we want father god these words to be in us lord jesus that father god that they may be displayed through us lord jesus and that's what you desire father because thy word is truth lord i pray lord jesus that you'd help us father let us just not be hearers of your word but let us be doers especially in the time that we are living in now lord help us to take these things seriously lord jesus i ask that you'd be with my brethren lord god as they go forth this evening to their respective homes continue to touch and meet those needs that are amongst us father and we just commit ourselves into your hands now in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ
