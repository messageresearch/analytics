you it's an honor and a privilege to be here with you and to be able to speak to this morning and just before we look in the work we just buy our hearts together towards the Lord and we've sung the songs of Zion and we believe there is a an atmosphere that has been created here this morning that the word can come forth in and let's just ask him to come and speak to us Heavenly Father the Lord is your believe in children have gathered themselves together here this morning father we are aware that there are Lord many needs among your body in this hour and the time that we're living in Lord we know that we're living in a time where it's a shaking time it's a confusing time or it's a time when people don't know which way to turn they don't know which direction to look to father we stand here this morning under the auspices of the revealed Word of the our Lord in our hearts we rejoice knowing that your word told us that when these things begin to happen you told us to look up for our redemption is drawing nigh and this morning Lord as we gather here we do not come Lord to be seen or to be heard we do not come Lord to order to entertain or to be entertained but father we come here this morning and the power of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we come here this morning Lord to get ourselves out of the way alarm that your word could come and that you can minister to the needs of your children Lord I don't know all the situations but Lord I am aware that you are here in this building this morning and so father we submit our unto you lord I pray that if there would be any sick among us I pray you at hilum Oh God only if it would be any bound here I pray you would set them free Lord and fathers we have gathered here for this youth service this morning Lord we know that so many times it can be projected Oh God Lord that the youth or the Church of tomorrow or the Church of the future but Lord we are well aware this morning that we are not promised tomorrow we are not promised a future so Lord as we stand here today we are not speaking to the Church of tomorrow but we are speaking to the church of today and I pray Lord you would help us today God to wake up and to realize who we are in your word and father when I pray you just have your way among us and bless never heart that be here today Lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise of the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believers said a man and they man and may God bless you bless you this morning if you have your Bibles we'll invite you to the book of Romans the book of Romans the sixth chapter the book of Romans the sixth chapter and we want to look here and the first verse and while you're turning there we want to take this opportunity to greet you this morning and to say God bless you sure is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today and goodness everyone out this morning I tell you it's a it's a real privilege in this day and time to have a meeting hey man when the world don't know how many can gather and who can do what but just brother Wade was telling me a little bit over the phone the other day about the meeting this weekend and young people coming together and I tell you with all the camps being cancelled and things I think this is a real honor this morning amen to be able together in the house of God and to have a meeting in the presence of the Lord sure appreciate the invitation to come present the confidence to be able to stand here and speak to you and God bless you brother Samuel good to see you and the church here god bless you and just want to look here this morning the book of Romans the sixth chapter and the first verse Paul here writing says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father I love this even so we also should walk in the newness of life so what I love here is Paul is showing you that serving the Lord is not taking away your life but it's actually giving you life if you've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the life of his resurrection now knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead Dyess no more death hath no more dominion over him friend that he died he died unto sin once but in that he lived liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord I think this is a powerful thing he says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should not obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness under sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as righteous as your members as righteousness under God fresh for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace well then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid in the book of matthew the fifth chapter we just have one verse we would like to read there and we'll let you be seated and then how many come to receive something from the Lord today amen in the book of Matthew the fifth chapter we want to look here in the sixth verse very familiar scripture I'm sure we could all quote it by memory this morning but in Matthew the fifth chapter in the six verse Jesus you're speaking the Sermon on the Mount in the Beatitudes and blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall fall a shall be filled hey man we asked Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats this morning we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God amen the Word of God we believe is inspired we believe it's true we believe it's infallible we believe it's an arrant we believe it's the perfect Word of God we've come here this morning amen to receive from that word and I just want to for a few moments here speak to you from these scriptures and if I will title it this morning I'd like to talk to you on satisfied by being identified satisfied by being identified very much a well aware the world we're living in today there's two types of people there is there is a people that is satisfied and then there is a people that is dissatisfied amen there's a people Amen that are content there is a people that is happy there is a people that is a prospering that is growing that is going somewhere and at the same time there is a people that is dissatisfied and I I think it's quite amazing that we look around in our rural today and we find that even in our government it is dissatisfied and politics it is dissatisfied education it is dissatisfied and the thing about it is is then when when one person is just satisfied then people begin to satisfy them try to try to do something to satisfy them everybody eight minutes trying to satisfy each other can you say man and when we look here at the word satisfied it means to meet the expectations the needs or the desires of someone it means to fulfill a desire or a need it means to provide someone with adequate information or proof so that they are convinced about something adequately meet or comply with a condition an obligation of the man or it means to pay off a debt or to satisfy amen redditor so the word satisfied could actually mean convinced bourbon would sit this way he would preach a message called convinced and then concerned he would say I am convinced that this is God I am convinced that Jesus is coming I am convinced that this is his first appearing in the form of the Holy Ghost in the last days because the Prophet said it shall be light in the evening time I am convinced he meant that the Scriptures is fulfilled I am convinced that the world's on the threshold of destruction I'll think of this in 1962 he's telling us that the world is on the verge of destruction and he's convinced to that he said but at the same time I am convinced Amen that the coming of the Lord is at hand Amen I am convinced that we have what we have is the Holy Ghost so this morning young people Amen we have not come together ain't meant to convince you of a Creed we have not come together to convince you of a dog more to convince you of some Church idea Amen but we have come here this morning that you may see they meant that the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is not a God of history Amen he's not a historical God but he is an ever-present help in the time of trouble now amen you must realize this morning that that satisfaction amen or that convincing must be in your soul it's not good enough amen just to be convinced in your flesh it's not good enough Amen just to be convinced in your spirit but you've got to be convinced in your soul a meant because the soul is the place where the Holy Ghost has got to seal and then the Holy Ghost does not seal your flesh off it does not seal your spirit but it will seal your soul amen until the day every day I mean can we can we preach this morning amen and I think that's what we've come together for a mint there's a lot of things we could tell you you need we could tell you Amen that you need an education and that'll only satisfy your temporary we could tell you that you need a a job that'll that'll pay you a lot of money that will only satisfy temporary amen but we have come there this morning to tell you meant that if you get the holy ghost amen it is not a temporary satisfaction it is not a partial satisfaction but the Holy Ghost is an eternal satisfaction that will put an assurance of convincing in your soul Amen that no matter what tomorrow holds I know who holds tomorrow Amen mind to think this morning that we have get it here Amen not that just our flesh would be fed we have not come that just our spirits would be fed Amen but we have come that our souls would be fair I think here of how that David would say in the Book of Psalms 42 verse 1 he would say as the heart panteth after the water Brooks he would say so panis now that word panis means too long for amen so in other words he's saying so my soul isn't longing after the old God he would say my soul thirsteth for God now notice what David says he says my soul thirsteth for the Living God amen when shall I come and appear before God in the message thirst he said not some historical or something that happened some years ago or some tale that someone told but for the Living God somebody say the Living God he meant for the Living God a god that's ever-present and his so first it for that God not for some historical something now in Psalm 63 verse 1 David goes on to say O God thou art my god and early will I seek thee my soul is thirsty for thee my my flesh is longing for the and a dry and thirsty land where no water is amen see I think this morning what we've come here for is because our souls amen is crying out amen our souls amen is needing a drink of water now let me sit this way Amen I'm gonna preach amen and if I gotta do the preaching and the amen and it's gonna take twice as long to get out of here amen so if I preach and you Amen we'll get downstairs and eat a lot quicker amen amen now think of this our souls amen our screaming out they meant our souls are crying amen for something this morning amen and the world is in the same condition amen morning their soul is crying out and then their soul is trying to find somewhere Amen that they can find satisfaction and do you realize what that first is doing it is driving them to the worldly pleasures amen but thank God this morning young people that the first inside of your soul it did not drive you to the things of the world this morning amen but the first in your soul and it has driven you into the house of God amen that the word could penetrate that alive and could change you amen could satisfy you Amen I don't know about you this morning but I want a drink of that water hey man hey I want a drink of the water I I want to go somewhere this morning amen where my soul cannot just be stimulated where my soul cannot just receive a feeling Amen but there might come a satisfaction in the message life with him since now but God is great economy for mankind has made man in their way that he wanted man to beat now he made man to first amen do realize young people you were actually made you were actually created to thirst amen now that first he said did you notice David said my soul thirsteth for thee just imagine my soul is thirsty god I am thirsting for you just like I was in a land where there was no water he must find water a mental parish now you see Amen if you've got a thirst this morning you've got one of two options admit you're either going to find water and you're going to live or you're going to perish since God made a man with a thirst that's a part of the human being is his thirst but God made the thirst in man to thirst for God and the devil has perverted it and make it thirst for his kingdom for the world do you get it the first in man is godly for God made the man to first amen now we find then that God gives the control tower to you he gives to you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and his thirst runs in on control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking now the control tower is in the body and in the soul also he said there is a trol tower in the body that tells the need in your body and it's brought to you by first also there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirits and you buy this can tell what kind of life is controlling you Amen seat then you cannot have an unholy ruler on the control tower and that unholy ruler Drive you ain't meant to a holy first he meant you cannot have a holy ruler on the tower ain't meant and that a holy ruler drive you to an unholy first see aim it the control tower or the one that's on the control tower is what is going to drive you to the thing that satisfy the thirst he said when you can see he meant what your desires are than you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have Amen seat there is a certain thing that you thirst for it can tell you and your so what your desire is and by the nature of the thirst you have I hope you can understand that you are women this morning they meant that if something does not change on my heart even if something that's not changing the soul ain't meant then the thing that's controlling you is going to drive you amen I think of how that God the probably God said God created the first amen will you agree with me that God created that first how many how many thirsty here this morning amen let me just stop see if you ain't first ain't no need preaching on thirsty are you thirsty this morning amen are you hungry this morning amen then that is not something you did on your own that is something God created in you amen seat now God created that first Amen in the profit sense but Satan come in and he perverted the first you look with me in Romans 1:25 the Bible says who changed now that word changed actually means exchanged Amen so who exchanged the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever a man now for this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the me leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge Amen God gave them over to a reprobate mind and Paul says to do things which are not convenient now you gotta agree with me they meant that reading Romans one right there is describing Amen that day and the hour we're living in it is describing the world we're living in see because there was a thirst there he meant because there was a God created first there he meant they were driven by that first but because they did not find the place where that first could be satisfied he meant the Bible says that God give them up amen God give them up amen and then Paul says God gave them over see what happened was they were given over to a perverted thirst you see what that word perverted means it needs to be changed over it means to be made something different the body God will say when God made everything in the Garden of Eden it was lovely then when Satan come in and perverted he said see Satan cannot create nothing there is only one creator and that's God but Satan perverts the original creation and now he's got into this perverting the original creation of first he said seat now a woman as I said before she wants to be pretty Amen there's nothing wrong with it whether young girl desiring to be pretty Amen that was something that God placed in her there's nothing wrong with a young man desiring success ain't been desiring to go somewhere there was something that was placed in him amen but see if you don't dart that first he meant with the Holy Ghost in the devil will pervert that verse and he will exchange that first for a holy first until an unholy for are you with me this morning ain't it seat by the way they are on the streets hair cut like a man wearing man's clothes man turned around wearing women's clothes now come on you got to preach with me this morning amen it's it's not a mystery that man looks like women today and women look like me and amen amen it's almost dangerous to say sir ma'am anymore amen because you don't know what you're talking to admit but you see what it is it's an example Amen that first has driven them there and then they were thirsting for something and that first has driven them to where they are today Amen see he said women we're wearing men's clothes and men wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing is perverted your food is perverted he said the life is perverted your first perverted your desires perverted it's a day of perversion it's a day of perversion amen oh we find them that in these last days there are two spirits at work in this age he would say the two spirits one of them is God's holy spirits and the other one is the devil's spirit working in deception he said the people of the earth are now making their choice than if I could somehow or another Amen maybe get it across to you this morning that this is not just a service Amen this is not just a youth meeting this is not just two coming together to fellowship a ment but this is a decision time amen this is a choice time this is a time Amen where you're either going to choose Christ amen or you're going to choose the devil this is a time where you're going to choose the Holy Ghost and you're going to choose a life of holiness or you're going to choose a life of perversion amen and I'll say this you will not control that first that first will be controlling you amen he said one of them is God's Holy Spirit now amen that devil Spirit works in deception it's a day of deception now think of this admit it's a day of deception when the prophet of god is going to say that deception is people are thinking they're christians and they are not a meant they are thinking they're living the word and they are not a meant they are thinking that because they go to church and they pay their tithes and they do this and they do that they are thinking that they're there they're in good standing with god but in reality they are not in it because their life is not bearing the fruit that the scripture said it would bear amen but the glorious thing about it this morning hey man I feel good this morning don't you admit the glorious thing about it is is here in the middle of a day of perversion that God has released the Holy Ghost amen back in the land today amen and the Holy Spirit is here and he's calling out a bride for Christ amen he is doing it by vindicating the promise of his word amen this aid showing that it is Christ amen how many believes the message here this morning do you believe the message of the hour don't be ashamed Amen if you believe the message they are let it be known I believe he meant the message of the hour Amen then I tell you what the Holy Spirit is here today vindicating the message of the hour the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people believe God will be called out amen the people that believe God somebody say believe God the people that believe God he said those people will be called out of this chaos don't that make you on the same man and then that God has sent His Holy Ghost in this age that's brother wait in the middle of chaos in the middle of confusion in a day when police don't know there boys and girls don't know the girls but God has said the Holy Ghost in this generation amen to call a church they meant to call a young man they meant to call a young lady out of the chaos they meant out of the confusion by the Holy Spirit is here this morning amen and he's not here just to entertain you he's not here just to make you feel good he is here to call you amen out of this confusion I say this morning thank God amen I say we were blessed people this morning amen out of confusion amen to be called out of sin thank you amen to be called out of the standings men the Holy Ghost is here amen to call us out of this chaos he said the death Holy Spirit is here calling his church by the air as usual by perversion of the Word of God like he did the beginning see amen so God he is the transformer amen do you realize that Hollywood it's not the inventors of transforming power amen but actually God is the original transformer and then God is the transformer then what is Satan Satan is the deformer Amen God is the transformer and Satan is the D farmer in Genesis 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved hey Amy can we preach at it for a second amen let's say that together and the Spirit of God moves and that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters Amen I'll notice the condition it was without form it was void and it was dark do you realize what that does that describes a meant a life without the Spirit of God it describes a young man without the Spirit of God it describes a young lady Amen without the Spirit of God it is a life without form it is the life that is void it is a lot for this Park remember can I tell you that's not the way you gotta stay and then that's not the condition you gotta live in when the Spirit of God moves it will move you a mint from harmlessness and voidness and emptiness and darkness into a Garden of Eden in Genesis the first chapter the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and the Bible said in the beginning back there that this world was without form and was void you ever been there before and then have you ever been there where you felt like your life was just was just without any purpose ain't it when you felt like the day and then the things you were doing without any purpose have you ever been there Amen you know what that is that is the first that is the first in your soul that is telling you you was brought up on this earth for a purpose Amen I think there was nothing just darkness and chaos what a horrible shape it must have been and nothing Amen go away in the darkness shondor notice this earth that we're sitting all right can I preach to you this morning Amen how many loves to go sightseeing how many likes to see the beautiful like like you go out Arizona and see the CC sit down and you see I go out to Rockies you see all the beautiful things go to go to Canada see the Niagara fall amen there's all kinds of beautiful things but do you realize at one point it was not like that hey Minton you realize at one point it was not a beauty spot it was not at all it was a formlessness it was a voidness it had no Beauty to it Amen but the Bible said he meant that the Spirit of God moves and when the Spirit of God moved it moved the world from nothing into something and I see this morning that same spirit is in this building today maybe you may be here you may be feeling like you're void you may be feeling like you're empty but the Spirit of God is here this morning amen to move you amen from chaos into the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I say this morning come on in Holy Ghost I say come on in this morning amen move across our young man young ladies move across our elders move across the church once again the power of God amen transform amen hearts and lives amen see said no it was dark and then there was no light he said there was wandering star twisted around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been attacked it must have been a terrific mass or something lost like it was didn't find its way and that's the way we become when we become wandering stars away from God just without hope without God without just just churning around out in darkness not knowing where we're going see and I took that great chaos of darkness and he transformed it into the Garden of Eden see by his word then that's how we are transformed is by God's Word it done the perfect will of God for it was transformed Amen from a chaos into a Garden of Eden by the Word of God amen now think of this amen until the Spirit of God moved up on this hurt it was not serving any purpose he meant it was not doing anything it was just turning it was just wandering it was just moving a Mentos in the Spirit of God Oh mercy when the Spirit of God moved upon it it actually moved it ain't meant from just being there to being in the perfect will of God now he wants to transform us this morning do you believe that how does he want to transform us he wants to transform us by the renewing of our minds see now Satan comes in and puts in a deforming to the word but the prana God said see is this that the DES former came in to how many knows that it took six thousand years to create the surface took six thousand years Marissa said it took the Creator six thousand years he said with the original word to bring forth every word he said is that right is that they said now see the DES former came in and as God had took six thousand years Amen with the original word to bring forth every word of his kind everything that he made would be God's own word bringing forth of its kind now the deformers somebody say the de former now the de former has took six thousand years amen and is to form the Word of God and what has he done he has brought his self to a new type of Eden he said it's now Satan's Eden amen that's where we're living today he meant brother if you can give me more back in my ear I'd appreciate it amen see he was brought himself to a new type of Eden now think of this the Spirit of God moved and changed the world amen from a chaos to a Garden of Eden but in the last days amen the deformers going to come in this stage in the world truly the end and he's going to transform it or deform it rather from a Garden of Eden in this Satan's eater amen now let me just go and preach her to you for a second and then because the devil hates you are you awake you got a pulse admit the devil hates you you know why he hates you it's because you are living in the middle of Satan's Eden now think of this Amen and you're controlling him in his own either right here in his own Eden there is a young man there is a young lady there is a young man there is a young lady that is living right here in the middle of all this chaos but they've not been given to that chaos because they've been called by the Spirit of God my then I think of how in this day we're living in an Satan's Eden how the problem of God is going to come with not a casual message he is not going to come with a lukewarm message but he is going to come with a message of zeal he is going to come with a message of passion he is going to come with a message of fire amen to declare the church it is now time to arise to your identification amen let me just tell you this morning you're not just a school student Amen you are not just you are not just a teenager young man you are not just a young boy this morning Amen you are the Church of the Living God you like the pride of Jesus Christ and bad now see this morning it is time to rise up it is time to rise up it is time to stand in the position that God has called you in amen I'll just share this with you as I was as I was coming home from some meetings last week and I was praying and just listening to a tape and this let's just begin to unfold to me it's a tape called identified with Christ amen and then I don't know about you but I love those tapes amen in the message identified with Christ but they're going to come along and he's going to say now he's going to read Romans six and he said now if I should take a text not for about 20 minutes I would say this identification identified with Christ now what amazed me is when Billy Graham actually begins to speak on identification and then he doesn't automatically go into identification he starts with satisfaction he says you know there is in the country today so many dissatisfied people it's amazing when you get around and find out so much dissatisfaction people hardly know what they want to do amen they come down the road in about 70 80 miles an hour in a 30-mile hours home slide the brakes turn around the corner start up with such speed we're all guilty a that until they burn a new tires half off now you want to know something there's a difference in somebody that's the paying for their own tires amen and mom and daddy still paying for it are you with me I mean if mom and daddy's still paying for them they're making doughnuts and burnouts and everything remember when they're paying for their own tires and then they don't hit that 70 mile-per-hour zone so quick all right with me Ben see but because they're trying to find satisfaction amen see they'll go with city block he said they'll go crazy to go sit and talk a while seems like people don't know what they want to do now brother Andrew what are you talking about see what they're doing is they're trying to achieve something amen they're trying to achieve something now what is the greatest thing that we can achieve if I would pass this microphone around this morning and I would ask you what's the greatest thing once again ain't no doubt with this many people there will be different answers amen but let's go back to what the Prophet said he said the greatest thing we can achieve is life somebody shot life life is the greatest thing that we could achieve see if you would go to heaven this morning and you would walk around by the weight and you would find Abraham you would say Abraham what's the greatest name he would say life admit no matter what anything else a mental life is the greatest thing that anyone could achieve amen now see when you've got a life then there comes a struggle with wives and then I think it's amazing how can overcome but it says what are you living for he said so you can I he said what are you struggling for so you can live what are you living for so you can die he said wouldn't it be most foolish if we didn't make Christ our absolutes Amen now think of this this morning church we are going to struggle to live all right young people maybe y'all know what I'm talking about they go around saying this struggle is real are you hearing me and then they ain't got a clue about what they're talking about and then they're just going around saying something amen all right you got a kid eight minutes going to school don't have to pay no bills amen each each mom and daddys food amen don't have no phone bill they got mama paying the and then they go around saying the struggle is real and I come on yes struggle ain't real they don't know what a struggle is amen but you want to talk about a real struggle a real struggle is when you set forth the foot to serve God amen a real struggle is when you surrender your life to the lordship of Jesus Christ amen I'm looking at some young people this morning that knows what the struggle is and then they know what it's like to live in this world they know what it's like to feel the pressures of hell amen but at the same time there is a holy God inside of them that is sustaining them that is keeping them that is providing for them that is guiding them in the midst of a chaotic world oh there is some young people here this morning that knows what the struggle is they met they they they are witnesses Amen that there is a God that will release an overcoming power in your life my I said see that then there becomes a struggle now what is that struggle it is living between desires do you realize what produces the dissatisfaction in the life of people is living between two desires he said see that control tower of the soul that one for the body for instance the flesh first to satisfy the desires it's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul see and many times these war one against the other we find there what's a great trouble today that too many people try to live between two desires a meant for one of them desires the things of the earth and the other desires the things of heaven and then one time as a young man I heard a preacher preach a sermon he called it cross-eyed Christians and then I want to title whatever he's going then she said cross-eyed Christians hey man he said a cross-eyed Christian Amen is a Christian that's got one eye on the world and they got one eye on the own heaven and they're trying to live between the two worlds they're trying to satisfy the earth then they're trying to satisfy her ain't been there to live it and I'll say this this morning amen there's people here this morning this building that knows what I'm talking about amen because you battled the same thing they met young people we battle the same thing Amen to live for God ain't meant to live for the devil they meant to fit in with my friends or to stand out for Jesus Christ amen but can I tell you this morning why that every time you try to fit in something raised inside of you and says you ain't want to work every time you try to change who you are something speaks in your heart and says you're more than that you know why because there's a soul in there and then there's a thirst in there that's telling you you was not born definian he was born to stand out Haman he was not born to be a part of this chaos the Spirit of God is here calling you he is here calling you this morning he is here to transform you amen to think this one of the prophets said the world is full of people then it become dissatisfied now you know that's the truth they mean you go to the store I'm just going to preach to you for a second one thing that drives me crazy is when I go to the store and I stand out there brother and I hold the door for somebody you do that stand there and hold the door you know what gets me is when they walk by you and don't say thank you like you owed it to them now one of these days I'm gonna get brave enough from brother Sam I'm gonna say you're welcome it may be my last day on earth but I'm gonna say it Amen you know I'm talking about it drives me crazy but because they're dissatisfied Amen i watch amen they don't even know you but they're treating you the same way they're treating people at home you know why because they're dissatisfied huh see Amen a dissatisfied person Amen is a person that can't be happy with nothing well let's just go and preach a while amen amen they're not happy with the church they're not happy with their family they're not happy with the preacher they met no matter what you do they're always trying and then because they're dissatisfied then if you don't get that dissatisfaction under control it's going to begin to scream for your life it's gonna be getting a screen for your life aim it in the message identify with Christ paragraph 55 some of them get so disturbed until they go down to the drugstore and they purchase for themselves a bottle of arsenic or sulfuric acid or something and commit suicide they find them laying there some will turn their gas jets on in the room or setting their automobiles with the pipe for the carbon monoxide gas trying to get away from life are you are you reading the same thing I'm reading they're trying to get away from life amen greatest thing they can achieve is the thing they're trying to get away from some of them will climb up to the bridge right little note sticking and their coat lay it down plunge themselves in death in the river jumping off the mountains high towers some will take a pistol put up to their head and actually blow their brains out they're just this satisfied it wasn't that they was a bad person it wasn't that they they there wasn't that they come out of a bad family or they know it was it they were dissatisfied Oh church hear me this morning amen we've got to come to a place of satisfaction and then we've got a real burl and I'm in the message amen were exempt from that no we're not they're suicidal spirits around this message they're suicidal demons amen that attack our young people remember can I preach here this morning we have not come here amen to give those demons room we have come here to denounce sin spirits and to cast them out by the power the Living God and to announcing to you that there is a place of satisfaction oh they're dissatisfied amen it's not even something you done to him they're just to satisfy brother wait a member said the hospitals were full of dissatisfied people the insane institutions are overrun dissatisfied they don't know what they do want there seemed to be something that they're reaching after but they just never come to it Amen see Amen he says mothers are no longer satisfied just being mothers Amen fathers are no longer satisfied Amen just being Father amen now come on and then he said old man wants to be teenagers he said old man wants to be a mensch early men so it's not just young people a men battling this satisfaction we got it we got adults well let's just preach we're here a minute spaghetti will be here a little bit right amen you you see it you see them manifested amen you take a you take a man in his 70s and Andy I'm kidding I'm not an old man I don't want to be an old man hey man she goes out and gets a bunch of a bunch of American Eagle clothes and goes out and gets him some sneakers and they been trying to look like again admit that man he's not a bad person he's just just satisfied he's just come to place that alive has no satisfaction old church amen see the old man wants to be a teenager he see they'll cut his hair off and make it tell me back the teenager wants to be like one of these rock-and-roll kings man seems to be unsatisfied amen now notice here your example the end is what becomes the standard of your life what's you focus on what you look to is what becomes the standard of your life he said see they've set them up in this example Amen I'll notice here if I mentioned some of these you're gonna think what the world is he talking about why mention me house he said paneling and Hopalong Cassidy and then he said Roy Rogers now me may know that mr. Dhillon Amen all these are these are examples television programs hasn't been set before the people he said they've set them up as an example they've taken them for their standard of life he said see than the women Amen he said those those little boys they begin to look at those examples and they turn out to be gangsters he said see women turn out to be prostitutes and Street walking liquid people man turn out to be gamblers lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God churches try to impersonate the other church the big church see it's not just young people dissatisfied the whole world is dissatisfied amen amen politics or dissatisfied amen churches are dissatisfied amen but I'm so glad to announce to you this morning there is a refuge and then there is a place this morning that you can run into and you can be satisfied amen you see then the first amendment doing ok on time amen the thirst in your soul amen is becomes becomes the first for an example now you realize in this world there are two types of examples there are good and bad examples now in 1st Thessalonians 3 and verse 6 let's look at that together 1st Thessalonians 3 and 6 Paul writing says now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us for yourselves know to follow us for we behave ourselves disorderly among you we behave ourselves this early among you neither did we eat many neither do we need any man's bread for nought but wrong with labour and travail and they not that we be not chargeable to any of you now thinking burst not hear of 2nd Thessalonians 3 verse 9 now because not because we have not power but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us now see if the word example there means a pattern it means a son it means a suggestion of anything representation figure copy an example for imitation or if the thing to be imitated or other thing to be shunned now notice there is a good example which is something that is to be imitated which is the pattern which is the standard which is what you should embrace then there is a bad example which is to be shunned now when Paul was writing to young Timothy in 1st Timothy 4:12 he said let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example to the believers in Word and conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity you see not now notice here Amen in the Bible there is good examples at the same time there are bad examples you lookyou me in Hebrews 4:11 the Bible says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest what is the rest the Holy Ghost lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief they may not see those that did not enter the promised land they set forth an example of what unbelief can do can hinder you from the promises of God you look here at a bruise chapter 4 he says what is it he said the pillar of fire is here amen the angel of the Lord is with us he's doing the very same things he said he would do and people stumble around and say oh well I guess it's all right that's pretty good oh I guess it's ok be careful that you don't fall in the same snare of unbelief you take you with all your heart all right now look here amen Sodom and Gomorrah amen an example of a city of what happens when you welcome in perversion amen now we're gonna have Church here today okay it's an example when you welcome perversion in amen Sodom and Gomorrah stands today as an example the Bible says turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly Oh Church when you look at Luke 17 31 in that day he saw where he saw me up on the housetop and his staff in the house stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him I Christ not return back now he says remember Lot's wife said that with me together remember Lot's wife amen remember now why would he say remember Lot's wife Amen because Lot's wife is going to become an example of what happens to a person when they look back the Bible says remember Lot's wife she merely looked over her shoulder Eve merely stopped for a moment that's all she done Lot's wife just looked back and God turned that righteous man not his wife Amen to a pillar of salt by just a little bitty thing just disobeying his commandments enough to just look back and see what all that fire was about and she turned and then are you thinking about something even a woman there one second and the next second she's a pillar of salt aim it right there well I memorize down there preaching for brother blue one time some of you may know him we sit around the table eating lunch and he said hey he said pass me Lot's wife anyway this is the salt let's eat one one woman in just a mint just in one second went from Oh from from a pillar from a woman to a pillar of salt Amen see that's an example young people it seems the time to look back a minute and I'll say this with everything within me Amen if you look away from this message you will go from being a young person with a future a meant to being just somebody else in society we're just another life but church the message of the hour has come young people Amen to set you apart Amen to identify you to put a seal upon you and somebody that is a satisfied oh my Amen if we could look at Sodom and Gomorrah and see what they become if we can look at Hebrews four and see what they become then this morning Amen let's not just look at the bad examples Amen but let's look at our example which is the perfect example which is the Lord Jesus Christ in John 13 15 for I have given you an example that you should do as I've done to you now Paul poem says see and identify with Christ paragraph 65-62 but they are trying to find something to identify themselves with and they're I'm not gonna hold you all day okay amen and the reason they are doing it is because there's something in them that God made them match but God made them an example to be identified with and that was when he made Jesus Christ to become your Savior that's the example that's what people should want is to be identified with Jesus to be like him in Matthew 11:29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls see you're to learn of your example Jesus Christ Matthew 16:24 if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me you are to follow your example Hebrews fell to looking unto Jesus you are to look unto your example amen 1st Peter 2:21 for even here and to where he called because Christ giving us an example that she should follow his steps see the human nature is why there is so many dissatisfied people God gave them a nature they've got a nature that makes him want to have something to identify themselves with they must have something that they want to be like they must have an objective in life even see the poverty little boys want to be Hopalong Cassidy let's bring that today little boys want to be Michael Jordan amen or they want to be Shaquille only a mint they're looking at all these examples ain't mint little girls he said they want to be Annie Oakley's amen you thought you look at girls today amen they see they see a filthiness on the on the television they see filthiness in the in the internet and they begin to pattern themselves why they're trying to satisfy that first inside of them I hope I'm getting through this morning they're trying to satisfy that first and that first is driving them or if they only wanted to be like Jesus as much as they want to be like earth examples set the sunday schools would be running over everywhere now I'm just going to preach here for a few minutes because I take young people services very seriously especially ones like this morning because I'm not just preaching to a bunch of young men and the younger and young ladies I'm preaching to the future hey man I'm preaching to the Church of today I'm preaching the young men that's gonna grow up and be beacons they're gonna be preachers amen let me say this what we need is we need integrity and that we need character amen we need a young lady's center that better not better not model themselves after the things the world but they're modern themselves had to the power of the Holy Ghost and then I said my my room this morning they're the hotel get ready I listened to a tape and I could hear people walking down the hallway you know and they were carrying on well I didn't care they were disturbing me so I was playing my taping to sturb them fair enough they preach along he's sitting a listen he said any woman that guess how the kitchens out of her place I thought all that that could get me kicked out of this hotel real quick but you got to come back to scripture it's Bible well I kind of figured it get taught to everybody admit but better substandard changed has Satan's eaten is it changed to what we preach listen friends that's the world that's the problem with the world today amen they're changing changing trying to satisfy amen let's come back to the landmark let's come back to what God has vindicated my to think this morning the Prophet City people let this stay with that great design great ambition to be like somebody for an example if they took Christ as their example then we could weaken the hell right now I won't get in trouble here brother way but stay with me amen oh we want to talk about defunding police let's talk about it if you would take Christ as your example he said we could fire every police there was in the nation I just might run for office with that code Amen we want to talk about it let's go back to Bible principles amen amen defunding police ain't gonna change this world amen he said the only thing that's going to change this world is let's come back to Bible principles let's come back to Christ being our example they said if class was our example he said everybody would be meek and humble everybody would be kind that had brotherly loved one for the other there would never be divorce case ever played in our country there would never be any sickness we could even dismiss hospitals if they tried to make Jesus Christ their example we would have need of nothing else but the satisfaction is identifying yourself with Jesus Christ let me say this this one in the world isn't an identity crisis this morning an identity crisis is a period of uncertainty confusion in which a person's sense of identity becomes insecure typically due to a change in their expected aims or role in society young people we go through the energy crisis oh my lord with all the Angels come from this morning anybody ever go through those identity crisis you've been there we've all been there over the under bless Scott I never had well brother branham did he said when I was little boy he said I read the book of Tarzan the Apes mama had an old rug missmizon while the giver laid before the dresser I cut the thing that made Tarzan to suit slip in a tree for a week I wanted to be Tarzan he said when I read the book of the Lone Star Ranger I wrote her broomstick being a hobby horse trying to be the Lone Star Ranger it's no more than what people will do that's what you read the music you listen to go into a restaurant and this old rock and roll no wonder people are going crazy that's enough to drive a human being crazy see whatever you read or listen to is what you become then Sullivan is going to make something make a very very profound statement and Ecclesiastes 12:1 and he's gonna say remember now as I create or I'm tying this together remember now my creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years strong I will now shall say I have no pleasure in them see but all I'll be thankful off through eternity one day I read about Jesus he said and that satisfied me I want to be like him that's my desires to be able to turn the other cheek go the second mile be able to forgive when the arch is all against you hold nothing against nobody amen I'm rushing but I want to try to slow down here for a second amen because I just want to tell you something that I've seen I've seen it as an evangelist traveling and preaching by the grace of God I've seen adults in prayer lines amen with fangs snapped up in their lives that should have been dealt with 20 years ago are you with me amen amen things that started in childhood this started as young people it begins to one thing up on top of another and then they become bitter amen amen something happened to her I just said this way I remember I was in a prayer line one time down in Florida and a young a girl come up for prayer she said well Andrew she said pray for me she was just weeping she was crying and I said sister what he needed from the Lord she said I only know how to put it in words she said I was born in a foreign country she said in that foreign country I was all over here she said I don't know my mom I don't know my daddy she said I was abused I was hurt I was used she said I'm so bitter brother Samuel she actually said I'm so bitter amen she said I can't forgive nobody she said Here I am almost 30 years old been living like this I said sister when did it start she said when I was just a child Amen not hearing this one of young people this is your hour this is your time to defeat that faint world brother Andrew was passed down through family generations that has nothing to do with you Amen you have been anointed you have been called you have been chosen to stand in this hour and to destroy the curse see Amen ready or not Amen young he was going to up and get married and there's gonna be families and I asked you this morning young boy are you carrying things in your life today that you want to carry into my marriage hey young lady are you carrying things in your heart today that you want to carry into a marriage there's a place today there's a place provided today Oberlander I'm proud of my temper do you want to carry that into the marriage over later I tell you what daddy told me I shouldn't dress like that and I shouldn't look like this and I can go less snow by Amen you don't carry that into a marriage are you with me this morning you won't you want to carry that your helper there and I was hurting and I don't trust nobody you want to carry that into a marriage you want to carry that thing the rest of your life I don't know about you but I think this is a good place this morning to lay that thing down I think this is a good place this morning to get our eyes off for worldly examples come back and be identified with Jesus Christ but then under God he don't want me there he don't he don't want me he don't want no part of me my my life is too messed up I've I've done things that I'd be ashamed for anybody know about let me just ask you this if God didn't want you there why did he provide a way for you to get there well brother Andrew God don't want me in the church I well if God don't want you to church why did he provide a way for you to be here Oberlander God he he I don't know why I'm here this wonder why does God even want me here why why am i hearing this you service I God don't want me in this you service well I guarantee a lot of you had to ride with somebody to get here well let's just preach a while why did God give you the opportunity to get here this morning because he wants you here he wants you here this morning for a purpose and I'm gonna close with this in the Old Testament when a man want to be identified at the house of God he took the most innocent thing he could find which was a lamb and he know that lamb was free from sin caused it nope no sin and he went and took the lamb and put his hand upon his head and confessed his sins now catch this I'll tell you I was I was setting this another night in my office and I about about shouted the place down I know you wouldn't believe that bet I did by faith he transferred his sins on the lamb and the innocence of the lamb back on him are you hearing me then the lamb died because it was a sinner so through the transmission of sins to the lamb the man went from being a sinner to be enough to be an innocent amen and the lamb went for holkar's the lamb went from being innocent to being a sinner notice and died a sinner and man lived by an act of faith obeying what God said but what did he do he went right back out of the temple with the same desire that he had when he come in because when the blood cell is broken he said and when that blood cell was broken the life of that lamb would not pull inside or come back into human life because it was an animal life he meant the man went out with the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again amen but here's the thing about it that was under the blood of bulls and goats it only provided a temporary satisfaction amen are you with me Amy can you imagine coming in the church Amy in your let's put it this way amen in the old days am i holding too long brother sit brother wait in the old days you've been out and done something wrong and so in those days you had to go get a lamb now I tell you we ought to be thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ today Amy because in those days you had to go get your lamb and bring it to church now your lambs got to come get you and bring you to church shouldn't be that way but anyhow they would go get the lamb and they would bring that lament and they would kill that lamb and that bleeding buddy lamb they would lay their hands upon it and that lamb would take away the guilt it would take away the shame Amen maybe they went out and stole something he would take away the shame him stealing maybe they went out in total lie it would take away the shame of line Amen but brother when they walked out the door the desire to do it was still there so all they received under the blood of the bull and goat was a temporary satisfaction oh this morning people as I close amen I want announcement to you that we are not here this morning under the blood of bulls and goats under temporary satisfaction we are here this morning under a perfect under an eternal satisfaction which is an eternal blood which has produced an eternal Redemption for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him but there come a time when God somebody say God say with everything with any of God made us an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus brother way this is Rob out tour my office now and when a sinner puts his hands up on his precious head and confesses his sins and his sins is transferred from the sinner to Jesus and the innocence the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into that person o blessed be the name of the Lord young people are you hearing me this morning Wilbur that I've done this and I've done that amen but I come to tell you this morning amen raise your hand raised hands raised hand up amen if you'll take your hand this morning and in symbol just lay it on the head of your lamb amen identify yourself with your life you know what you'll come in here amen carry on that sin but you leave here carrying the innocence of Jesus Christ Oh glory to God what I'm glad what a lamb by the Holy Ghost that individual becomes as innocent as Jesus himself there's where I want to be identified for by one spirit we all baptized into one body now let me say it this way to be identified with Christ it's to move from this satisfaction in life to satisfaction I've got to leave you this and remember what satisfied means satisfied means to meet an obligation or to pay off a debt and David said behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me so in other words David is saying I was born in sin I was born in debt Oh Bible says there was a Jubilee year calm though people that were sold out for dancing they had old noted that they could not pay so they went and sold themselves to people for slaves but ever so often ever so often there would come a day of grace there would come a Jubilee what we know as the Jubilee year when this Jubilee year was come then there when a priest and sounded a trumpet and that trumpet denoted whoever slave no matter how long he had been serving how much longer he had to serve when the trumpet sounded the slave was made free he can lay down the whole he could go home to his children he didn't have to work any longer the trumpet gave not an uncertain sound but it gave a certain sound and the man can lay the on his trumpet and go home free from slavery then brother Andrew what are you doing I have been blowing the gospel trumpet to you this morning and I have been telling you wouldn't you leave these meetings today Amen sister when you leave these meetings you don't have to leave a slave young man you have to leave a slave to the world there is a liberty and then there is a power there is a place in the house of God amen that you can pull that thing down you can throw it down this morning anybody want to throw it down with me just throw that thing down throw that habit down you can leave here today free Verlander you're crazy for this next statement well you just call me crazy you can leave here today as innocent as Jesus Christ who makes me want to put my shouting shoes on brother you can leave here today as innocent as Jesus Christ and what we need today is anointed messengers from God sound of the gospel trumpet declaring that that has been paid for brother if you owed me $20 do you owe me $20 okay I thought you might wishful thinking right but if he owed me $20 what's your name John if John owed me $20 and every time Johnny got around me I'd say hey John how you doing he just kind of looked at me and smiled well I'm doing okay you know why he's not gonna smile have a good time with me you know why is because there's a dead hanging over his head he can't look at me without thinking about that debt he can't shake my hand without thinking about that that that is controlling his life I say come on John let's go on a trip let's go somewhere well I don't know maybe I'm it's not that he don't want to go the Dan is stopping him that Dan is stopping he wants to go he wants to feel but that dad is there what's your name Michael that's a good name he said he knew maybe Andrew fits in there maybe John fits in but Michaels good man Michael comes along and says you know what John I'm gonna pay that debt amen and Michael a mint Michael here's John say I want to go on that trip with you but I can't because I got a dance not one I want to talk to you but that debt is haunting me and Michael says you know what I'm gonna pay that debt a mint and he pays that debt you know what that does that brings the freedom in John's life that when he sees me you can shake my hand and I want to go on a trip you can go are you hearing me why because when the debt is paid it brings a Liberty and you know as well as I know there's times you come in the house of God you want to raise your hands you want to say Amen when the preacher says anybody want to go to heaven something inside of you says I want to go amen but there's a dad hanging there if you ain't got the Holy Ghost and been born again there is a dad hanging there amen but may I tear this morning amen that debt collectors in the bill that man amen the debt peers in the feeling he is here this morning he is here this morning to release you of that debt you want to raise your hands this morning go ahead and raise them you know why but that's paid for anything you want to talk about going to heaven go and talk about it because the debt is paid for I'm happy and the Devils mad because the debt is paid for I am sinless I am spotless I am innocent about the satisfying portion of the Holy Ghost oh he paid our debt but you know what John I'm trying to quit but you know what John in a few days somebody come along and say do you really pay that $20 debt off you didn't you didn't pay that debt but when when the debt was paid to me I wrote him a receipt paid in full when they tell him that that's not paid brother Samuel he can take the receipt and he can waive it in the accusers face and say but wait a second I've got a receipt and the problem of God said what is the Holy Ghost what is that pillar of fire it is that abstract it is that receipt that your debt is paid I'm done here this morning Church but if you want something to shout about I'm gonna give you something to shout about your ticket in the rapture is paid for and then your ticketing the glorious paid for your body changes paid for young people you don't have to go to the world you don't have to go to pleasure you'll have to go to entertainment it's paid for this morning you are they innocent children under the Living God won't you stand to your feet this morning paid for this woman brother Wayne the devil can holler mount the Dan all he wants to but I got a receipt I got a receipt and when I hear the Spirit of God say you can overcome these things I raise up and say hey man but that's been paid for that that is satisfied this morning you know when people they become debt free they they do crazy things they really do the craziest thing so when they get out of that they go back in there they celebrate getting out of that by going back that makes a lot of sense don't it but you know what the freedom has come to their life a freedom has come in their heart and there's not a restraint there to control they'll go out like I said go and debt celebrate and being out of debt but when Paul wrote that in Romans 6 and said the grace of God so because grace is here they thought well let's just go sin and Paul said god forbid god forbid that the debt was paid and you would go dead again brother sister I'll leave you since this morning but REM said on the day of Pentecost it come down that pillar fire broke apart like that tongues of fire sit upon him he said not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon each of them an elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that God has separated himself in the man do you get it he said God below God separating himself man God not in one person he's in the church universal that's the reason Jesus said the works that I do shall do all show you do more now King James says greater but the right translation there is more than this show you do God was bottled and confined in one man Jesus Christ somebody sit with me but now button how he's bottle and Kotori bottle and confined in the whole universal Church of Living God and how many's got the Holy Ghost here this morning Haman you have got the receipt your debt is paid you know my peoples out there drinking this morning they're in debt they were born in debt they rub em said you can't blame them they were born they were born in debt that's the nature they was born where's all born with sin shapen iniquity but didn't need something it's something that the devil that because of that nature drove you to do the things you did there over you to do trying to satisfy that thirst then when you come and get the Holy Ghost and get born again and get changed that same devil comes in church and then that devil tries to put condemnation up on you for doing what that nature that was in you drove you to do that he was a pervert or of but I heard a quote yesterday about blew me away brem said but come on this morning to the fountain that's open in the house of David he said there is where we'll expel all the guilt and all the shame my as musicians come today church what kind of youth meeting can we have here this morning what what a youth meeting it would be this morning if we would say Lord I want to come drink out of that film Lord I'm tired this thirst driving me the things the world there is a place of satisfaction you know this morning there's as we spoke about being a deceiving age probably for God was hitting this way he would say now if the doctor telling you you got throat cancer he said from smoking cigarettes trying to satisfy that thirst won't scare you he said then the devil just let you join church and get identify with what they call better society he said then you'll come in church and just be a church member just be there and just being a church member but young people I don't know about you but I think we got enough church members we got enough quoters and enough arguers and debaters and festers and fighters and how many would say today Lord is a young person I want to be a soldier I want to be more than just a church member I want to be the church could you witness it before the Lord this morning with your hand raised if that's really your desire today Lord I I want to move beyond just coming to church going to Sunday school and singing in the choir and playing an instrument oh I want to move beyond just being a church member I want to move into a place of satisfaction a place in the presence of God remember said this way and said the greatest pleasure I know of is to be able to pray until I know that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it he said and then recognize that the God that made the promise is in our midst to fulfill the promise that he made brother and ER I don't know if God intends for me to have the Holy Ghost what can I tell you God does but Burlando I'm paying if it's God's will or not for me to have the Holy Ghost let me said read the Bible his word is his will now can I sit this way there are some things you just ain't got to pray about Oberlander I'm praying about getting Holy Ghost you ain't got to pray about that it's right here and I'm trying to see if it's God's will or not no it's right here in the word receive the Holy Ghost and he shall have power how many wants that power this morning let's just bow our hearts together today with ever head bowed today ever eye closed as we come the close of this service this morning I wonder third be one here today that you could witness I needed this from the Lord this morning god bless you god bless you Verlander I've been raised in the message I've been raised in

Lord as young men and young ladies Lord young people father that loved you that believed your word for this high priest [Music] or does have listen to your words so reverently and lord I pray something has been said this morning to bless him and help him the Lord as I think of how your prophet said Lord there in that Garden of Eden in a sense of place of innocence in such a place of peace in such a place of arrest how that Eve by disbelieve in the word he said she swamped that veil of innocence for that lust veil he said before when she had that innocent veil she didn't know that she was naked Adam didn't know he was naked but Lord when they swapped those veils they received knowledge and it put a lust fell upon them and your prophet would come and Satan Zi then say now here we are and Laodicean Church age and one of the one of the characteristics of this age is it would be naked it would be covered their eyes their their their lives would be covered by a lust veil but oh god here is a group of young people this morning what is living right here in the middle of this evil age living right here in the middle of Satan's Eden but look they are not here desire and that lust veil they are desire in that veil of innocence Lord I pray the Holy Ghost would come today father when I pray for every young man here Lord that stands before me today their God Lord that earth that has got a future before I'm gonna life in front of him Lord Father I pray this morning if there would be one thing in their soul crying out for you Lord I pray that they would not leave this

most happiest people art I pray for every young man here today dear God Lord as they come to crossroads as they come to places in their life and in their journey Lord and they don't know where to turn they don't know where to go I pray o Lamb of God that she would come to him today lord I pray that they would surrender to you I pray they would come up to you today Lord and lay their hands upon your
