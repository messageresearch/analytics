house of the lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 and 2nd peter 1. revelations 1 2 peter 1. remember the announcement has been made of the easter meeting with life at

we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you now in jesus name amen revelations 1 12 and 13. and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now then let's turn over because we still ain't got to that to praying forth i hope when we get there we can say see this is what i've been talking about all right we want to go to second peter 1 and we'll read from one to through verse 4. simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god our savior jesus christ now remember this is not written to the world all right to them that have obtained like precious faith grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according that his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge the knowledge of him that have called us glory and virtue whereby given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we tried to bring out this morning and thinking on the things that we've considered for a while and speaking about the uh god condescending and revealing himself and coming down and making himself manifest among us and doing all the way through and watching him unfold himself as he condescends down to you and i to word that we can understand right to not back up too far but to think about the things we were trying to cover this morning of how that we saw that the christ when peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god or the christ of god that he was signifying to show that he was the creator god and that would fulfill hebrews 1 john 1. and read those scriptures where it says you know about all things were created by him and without him was not anything made that was made all right and seeing it on down to giant to ephesians uh three and nine where he created all things by jesus christ and jesus christ is the word all right you say well there it says jesus but jesus was not the creator the human flesh that we call jesus just remember jesus is the only name of god all right so jesus christ is correct if you were just saying jesus the flesh you're incorrect but jesus christ was almighty god because that was his name and the only name that he ever had see was jesus christ was jesus all right and we went through trying to show how that in the old testament that we followed the christ and looking at it and seeing that that christ was the anointing or the anointed and that it appeared in many ways like through david and joshua sampson moses all of those prophets were christ's for the time now not themselves but the word they were bringing me okay all right they themselves could be anointed of that spirit right all right and and coming forth and and you know and doing it but we saw that he was the angel of the covenant and you'll read in the book of acts that it speaks of jesus christ being the angel of the covenant all right the one who spoke to moses from the burning bush you know all right who was that back there the christ who was it throughout the bible the christ the anointing all right to make manifest and show god as he would be coming down to you and i that it would be bringing forth the christ the anointing all right coming down then to the last days coming through the the uh time of the new testament parts you know and peter recognizing him and then coming to to uh the day of pentecost and the holy ghost coming and the descending and holy spirit down through the ages bringing it down to the age that we're living in and to see that brother branham said it like this he said one day that that anointing that came on him on the river jordan left him in the garden of gethsemane all right and then later on he declared it this way he said is to return upon the bride of jesus christ in the last days all right now that would be making her the anointed you know making her to be the messiahs making her to be the fulfilling of the word and bringing us down to the hour that we're living like brother branham said on christ's mystery he was so you know it amazes me sometimes to think about how the man can know so much but yet he can just pull it right up and just stop and you say well he ought to finish that you know and he gets on christ's mystery we'll get a chance we'll read it in a minute where he said it's unfolded itself down to this present hour that we're living well you know why i believe he meant that he doesn't fold it down to that point but he knew it wasn't through unfolding right amen but he knew the next day wasn't unfolded he had to wait until that time for it to be revealed all right so beautiful in the writing that the ways that he would say things when you go back and you check the scriptures and see how that that come forth you know in the writings and in the understanding all right but now see then we've seen that it come down to its rest in christ there as he was upon the earth you know the lord jesus christ and then as i said promised to come back in the last days to be poured out see to fulfill the scriptures where it said that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh you know which would be poured out in the end time to be then to where you could see the anointing or the anointed all right now that is a wonderful thing but just remember now and i didn't give these for brother anderson to to uh give because he's got so much on him right now to try to keep up with us but the we think well all we need is the anointing all right see then he gets into the message and he says it this way on the anointed ones at the end time paragraph 127 now people can live in this spirit they can dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed on that spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit all right so we come down to anointed ones and he goes on to tell us because this is where he's bringing it that you can't tell that woman that it's wrong to cut her hair and wear her pants and the things like that you can't tell her why because she's anointed all right you remember the other day and i was bringing it out so you can't tell people if they're anointed you take somebody that deals with anointing all right and i'm a firm believer in it i've i've tried my best to explain to you what i believe in the anointings and and how i've smelt the presence of the lord how i've seen things and and seen different things in my home i believe in the anointing i believe in the supernatural but yet you can be tied up into the point that if something speaks to you then you can start going with that and keep following it but remember it doesn't matter about the anointing it's what the word says all right the anointing can be great and wonderful and we appreciate it but you just can't tell people that are anointed things because you know they're not going to listen to you because they spent all of their life under what they think is the holy spirit and it may be because that's what he's just saying you say would god do that yes he allows it to take place to try you and i to see what we'll do all right look what he says on a thinking man's filter he said you see that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul all right on a message called paradox he said we all know the anointing of is christ that comes upon the word to make the word live is that right amen christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in divine healing and so what the words are see waiting for the holy spirit and that's word that i believe when i do about the new birth i believe you take the word but it must be then revealed to you to make a new birth all right it's not just something that you believe it you talk about it you think it you say i've got it it's when it's revealed it becomes the new birth all right and doing that then it's not just an anointing upon your spirit it is the opening of the word into your heart that gives you the new birth all right then that way you're a child of god you're not just a church member or an anointing or anything but you can have that baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life and miss it right you said brother brother dale i thought we had to have the baptism on your spirit it can just be upon your spirit part of you and not upon bringing it to the soul all right you see why then that what i was bringing this morning and i believe it i believe in the anointing i believe in the genuine anointing on the genuine right i believe in that because that's what it is it is the anointing but remember too you can be anointed with a genuine holy spirit he said balaam was anointed with the same spirit that moses was so how do you tell the difference balaam was off the word right but you better remember one thing too he wasn't off the word until he faced the prophet right amen because there was nobody to judge him see that's where it's so strong church the anointing until maybe we need to just spend days months weeks years preaching on that to get it to the point that we can understand but the hardest parts is to get people not to fall off one side or the other you see you don't believe i preached one day on the manifestation of the spirit of god a certain brother went home with me that day first thing he said you don't believe in the manifestation do you i mean i just i said i spent an hour and a half explaining why i believed it but you don't believe it that's all he got out of the whole message and me explaining what i believe because i was explaining i believe correctly just like the anointing you can take that and you can just go with it or you can go but what is it it could be the genuine anointing upon your spirit and not quicken the word in your soul because i got one in here somewhere where he's talking about let's see it won't quicken a denominational seed the holy ghost can't quicken the trinity there's no such thing in the bible the lord revealed to me there was a trinity now lord never revealed to you there's no trinity i don't care what you say that's right because there's no trinity and god doesn't do it that way but he permits it by allowing the anointing to come upon us to think that we are genuine well i just don't know how to tell the difference go back to the word right back to the word well everybody else says they go back to the word okay okay go ahead we'll find somebody that's on the word and let them come and face it right you're gonna find out a lot of difference then well that's just your way of seeing it you're just argumenting i agree i'm argumented i agree i'm hateful i'm american i'm an old dude i agree with every bit of it but what about the word right what about the word all right so we can watch the anointing and we can talk about the anointing and talk about it correctly and bringing it down because firmly believing in the anointing all right but to believe it you've got to be born again amen and that's not just an anointing now remember what i've always taught you the people of the old testament weren't born again that's right none born greater than john right a prophet right an introducer of christ right right but the least in the kingdom is greater than he is that bible all right so the main thing the prophet said is whether you have that baptism of the holy ghost and your birth you can have it on your spirit and be baptized every day with it still not not be right but if you're born again all right if you're born again it is the same anointing that burst you the difference is is if you just understand the coming down of the holy spirit that the holy spirit comes down upon your spirit all right now watch what i'm saying it comes down upon your spirit it quickens what's in your soul but if there's no word in that soul it can't quicken why was it that jesus was seen of over 500 brethren the bible says and calls them brethren but there was only 120 made it to the upper room for some reason the others didn't get there well it was just too busy yeah well that's probably about right they're just too busy what's busy got to do with a new birth or not but do you understand so we can move on that we can follow the christ and brother brown said if you can't see christ in every verse go back and read it again because you've missed something all right it's wonderful to study other things and to see the holy spirit come upon those people and the things that they've done back there he's then one day was the other day was listening he said make us ashamed of ourselves about the things that they done under that old testament form right but see it's not just the anointing all right now this is about four months maybe longer that i've had these notes my wife won't throw nothing away because she she's afraid i might have something i need she told me yesterday said your office isn't a mess because i've got quotes run off for you know probably 100 or 150 pages of quotes run off on the things that i'm relating to and i just lay them over and then when i get ready to use them i'll write on the top of them what they are and put a paper clip to hold most of them together and it might be three months before i ever get back to that but i do have them laying there to where i can pick them up and about three or four months ago i began to think on a on a little subject and things and and i started to try to bring it out and i've seen immediately that that i needed to uh make sure and lay a foundational point to where we could so we brought it all the way down through and i hope now it's getting clear to you about what happened to eve in the garden and how that it was in her spirit that things got messed up it was not in her body until her spirit accepted those thoughts and ideas and she began to reason upon them then the effects went into the flesh part all right and that's the same as it is today and the same that you see in the message of the hour you see the people are just flocking to the anointing you let somebody have a little emotional up doings in their preaching and the people just flock to it but you also see them run with them three or four months and then you see them leave and flock somewhere else because that's where they build out they're built on that emotional thing i want you and i'm not throwing off on you because we're human i watch you when somebody comes through that's emotional you're more emotional with them than you are with me well that don't make me mad i know what you're doing i just said come on buddy come on get in the right channel to where we can all rejoice together because i like it too all right but then when you've got to have the emotion of the anointing before you can believe the word then you're right in the devil's trap because that's where eve was at all right but seeing what happened in the garden with her look where it took away any opportunity of the holy spirit to be able to come in a new birth it took away the opportunity of being able to fulfill god's plan and purpose and it would take him 2 000 years really for 4 000 years that it would take god in building the things to bring it to the place that it could come forth to be able to make some opportunity for the soul of mankind to be saved but yet he wasn't just playing around go to masterpiece and study it abraham isaac jacob joseph foundation body built by the prophets right take out one of them are missing right body built by the prophets the neck being john to come to introduce the head which was christ all right see then in that we can see god was doing something under the time of the anointing but just remember he said it himself he said that he would allow these things to come among us they did to them he allowed things to happen under anointing balaam was anointed just like moses was anointed or elijah was anointed and you couldn't tell the difference because he was no difference in the anointing and balaam remember is that my right now balaam he even prophesied some things that would take place under the as i said this morning caiaphas prophesied that it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people under the anointing of the holy spirit that was anointing their spirit but then we think the new birth is just some anointing shouting crying speaking in tongues oh wonderful that's right but none of that is the birth four thousand years and he could not bring one birth do you understand what that means that for 4 000 years under the anointing that god could not one bring one new birth to anybody that's right in john the baptist coming to be a prophet as he was receiving the holy ghost in his mother's womb but yet he was not a born-again christian right you say but now wait a minute okay then why don't you go read a little bit and find out in the bible that elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit yeah you didn't ever read that see we're there with john and i believe it but remember we need to read a lot more because elizabeth said was full of the holy spirit all right but you see then it would take the death of the lord jesus christ to bring it to a position that you could have a new birth amen all right now then the prophecies of the old testament so you think about it i'm thinking another day about it we're trying to express something to you about paul and and see when that light struck him down and and and here he goes out there and here sets paul paul knew isaiah and how a virgin would conceive he knew those scriptures he knew how the lawgiver would come before between the knees of judah he knew those scriptures but they never struck him until the holy spirit gave him a new birth and then he could even though i believe he was born to prophet don't you because i believe paul was a prophet now of course the people of the messiah argue with you on half that's all right they said paul was no prophet well brother branham even called luther and wesley and all he called him prophets because it was who the word come to is what you're dealing with a prophet all right and then paul would be greater than agabus which it says he was a prophet okay but not to argue with no one just to make the point and go on that that great apostle paul see then he could take the scrolls and the holy spirit could come off of the pages into that man's thinking and show him the christ that was throughout the word show him the things we talked of this morning show him the anoint the anointings and the things and do it in the correct order to have everything lined up but he also knew that there was something else see that's basically what man speaks of today even in the message is the anointing some of you that listen to these other brothers and you're thinking how many of us preaching on a new birth to tell you anything about the new birth no it's this great thing that we've got this message we we've got we've been you know we're these people we're oh it's all great but where's the new birth then where's the statue of prayer well that's way back in early part of this ministry we'll need that now we don't i still love to think about water baptism that was 50 years ago how long have you been since you got baptized that's a long time ago i still like to think of that and still love to do them you know because that's that's just part of me all right but think about it see that you can follow now let me get off the message now and get into what we need can follow the christ throughout the word but let me say it in the heart of love and the best grace i can have the denominational world can preach about the christ they might not know what brother branham did about the anointed ones and how it be the genuine anointing upon the balaam and the things but they know about the christ they know about things that happen back there but there's something that they don't know right and i wonder do we know it that's right i'm talking about lula ain't talking about somewhere else i'm talking to me and you ain't to somebody else that's for business to follow the christ the anointing throughout the word is wonderful but it does not complete the plan of god and to know all about the anointing we could be maybe no more than denominationalism who knows about the christ all right and i have to admit some of them do a better job of preaching the new birth than i hear of the pre-preachers in this message and that's as honest as i can be without being sarcastic because now it's just to believe brother brown was a prophet every day of your life die and go to hell right because they don't explain that it's on your spirit all right but think about it think about these things that we talk about let me give you just one more off the message called the rapture but remember it comes on oh glory i got the anointing and it's a genuine anointing remember caiaphas had it too and prophesied so did balaam have it and prophesied but that don't have nothing to do with this inside unless that was god's seed his gene from the beginning predestinated don't have nothing to do with the inside now if it was the spiritual realm that caused the fall and i hope by now at least you're beginning to believe a little bit about that that it was in eve the spiritual realm that caused the fall not the body not the soul but in that spiritual realm or spirit you know that she got all messed up and it created all of those things that it can't end with just the spiritual part it came in with just an anointing well brother dale i just want that anointing on me praise god praise god i've talked to you of my own personal experience of anointings until you can't say that i don't believe in them i smelt perfume it was so beautiful until marvelous down in the middle of the woods when there was nobody in that area at that time god was dealing with wade to get him to a place that i could speak to him and i failed and missed it until i seen what is going on i can talk to you about great experiences but that'll build you up on my experience and why tell you about it because i don't want you building on my experience i want you to build on your experience this member is your god and you not me and you and god because see the problem is if people think it's brother branham and them and god no no you've got to get away from that i don't care what we appreciate everything but it can't be that way brother is not our god you can't take the place i mean we honor we we give glory to all things because where would we be without the message we wouldn't know nothing but yet we put our honor upon the lord jesus christ all right now in doing that then let's think about something that was taking place throughout the bible throughout the old testament all right then on down into the new testament and right on down as it unfolds to the present hour that we're living and follow it through the word and i don't mean it to be something wrong as an it i just mean that god revealed something to me many many many years ago that i've tried to explain because i've never been one to put things upon emotional situations i've always been one to just go back to the word and and leave it there until god quickens it all right and bring it to that place but go ahead brother and pull up crisis of mr god reveal and let's read just a little bit then we'll get our thought and then move on to that if i don't finish this afternoon we will carry it on we instead worry about it but look what he says and god's great secret he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve now the back part why would he emphasize the back part me are we having trouble with the michael yeah okay all right why would he emphasize the back part remember we've been through that that would go on back into the eternities word that brother branham would speak of in the beginning before the eternal and it would back up into his mind what about a prophet that can go back into the mind of god now that's something called you and i can't do it just forget it we go by him all right there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it to just be the anointing to come upon him that's just part of it that's just part of the story right follow it now he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god but he actually wasn't he actually wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be displayed you know attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him which would be following him was to be son in him was to be savior and him was would be healer all of these attributes that we see already express they were in god all right so it's this not to anoint mankind it's not to just a fellowship form it's to see what's in his mind and what did he say he said so in my opinion the first thing he made was angels and then they worshipped and that made him god he started from there as the previous messages drop down a little bit paragraph 105. now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there were silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for space a half-hour and seven thunders ordered her voices and john was forbidding to write see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is a revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible watch and all the acts of the of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god help us we'll see it right here this morning all right a great mystery even tying he says to the coming of the lord well i've tried for 40 something years to preach about the things and not be and try to preach it right i believe brother brown said the seventh seal is the coming of the lord that's his coming well we don't know nothing about the seven seats we do know it's his coming we're not worried about other things that go around it or with it or whatever i'm not just arguing with you about what you would believe about it i'm just saying what he says it is all right that solves the problem he said it all right and that's it but the thing that is that we need to follow is what he goes on to say on paragraph 123 of christ is a mystery but if the thing is put together right there is the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation and god's whole plan revealed right in jesus christ he said it's put together there all right now what is the coming of the lord we can say well it's this is that it's the tent visions it's the the uh this and you've got your third pulls you've got all you can just go all you want to and run but what did brother run say it says coming of the lord okay that's all that no problem the rest of it is discussion of what you think we're saying what he says to me that's not water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ father son holy ghost is the lord jesus christ so matthew 28 19 is not contrary to acts 2 38. like people of this message i've heard them years ago say we take acts 2 38 for our baptism but they take matthew 28 19 if the denomination took matthew 28 19 they get baptized the name of the lord jesus christ that's taking your own interpretation because it does not say that right it's just quotes off of a page but listen what would it be then then that would be tied together and and see you you've got two things in the bible to be considered one is called the first coming of the lord all right the other is called the second coming of the lord right that's two things in the bible that it deals with it deals with his first coming and then it deals with his second coming all right so now his first coming would be all the things that we've been talking about that would start it on the other side of eternity in the beginning before the eternal and brought it across the line into the elements you know time and then bringing it down to like we were doing this morning bringing it down to the hour that we're living upon the word of god all right now then we know that it took 4 000 years to complete his first coming right right and it took 2 000 years to complete his second coming what's the problem then we're not relating to the things of what we think it is we're talking about the facts of the word of god that there's no you can't argue facts john the old saying go you can argue figures but you can't argue facts figures will mess you up the facts can't all right now see then we should be looking for something sorry lord for something no no way of saying it but you can't say the first coming is this but the second coming is different are you with me it may be in manifestation or reality or time periods they ain't gonna do it see whatever the first coming is that brought him here the second coming will be the same way or something related to that to bring him here again is that sensible you don't need a revelation for that do you we need a revelation to understand how it took place but it took him 4 000 years to get here the first time so all of that coming down through there was the coming of the lord when you see moses and all the things that was transpiring you see the lord on the scene all right he said well that's just covered under the anointing and there's where you're missing it then because you'd have balaam and him tied up in your anointing and you'd have them tied up in his coming and the coming of the lord can't be through balaam and see you you don't understand where you're you're condemning your own selves and what you're trying to study the word of god ever what it was the first time will be the second time because it brought him here the first time right it took all of those prophets and all of their doings to bring him here the first time and sure that was the christ dealing with them but something else was taking place all right in his second coming his second coming then would start on the day of pentecost right right any problem to the baptism of the holy ghost was the coming of the lord on the day of pentecost that's it no that was just no there's where you're going see you're going right back to where i i spent nearly an hour now trying to get you out of that you go right back no that was just a holy ghost that was just anointing but that anointing that fell on the day of pentecost was the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost amen it was not just an anointing of a spirit it was actually the birth of the church all right then thinking about it thinking about what happened abraham isaac jacob joseph prophets built the body john came to introduce every one of those prophets was part of the working of the coming of the lord amen not just an anointing i'm going to keep saying that to where you'll think about it it was the anointing yes praise god but that wasn't all of it because anointing would have failed when you got to the day of pentecost if it's just an anointing then you could not use it as especially and because that is divided and whether you believe it or not it's divided on the day of pentecost in the bible it never fell upon all mankind it failed up on 120 january it failed on 3000 january but in the last days it's promised i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh there's where your anointed ones would come into being see then you'd have the coming of the lord just being an anointing there's more to it than just talk about the anointing right you're glad we ain't gonna have communion but you see what i'm talking about that it took the believers in the book brother brown said that is the bible you need that quote he said that is the bible the believers in the book the believers in the book is the bible the bible is is not the letters on the page see you'd say to me well brother dale hold up the bible most people would grab it you know they throw it up there like they'd say oh brother dale i ain't gonna try it but call it because i couldn't pick you up but you'd say to me where's the bible there's the bible paul was the bible peter was the bible john matthew mark the old testament you had ezekiel jeremiah moses all of those writings was manifesting something they would come forth then to bring the very god of glory do you believe that amen do you believe that jesus was almighty god he realized then it took all the believers of the old testament to bring him forth right and you leave out one of them we call a minor prophet major prophets but you you can't do that this that just signifying that they didn't bring the extent of the word that the others brought and some were records and different things but they're still prophets and without them you would not have a complete word that's right john would have stood out there and he said i want to introduce you to the two-thirds of the lamb of god you understand what i mean because you'd be saying that the other third didn't amount to nothing no no no there was a complete full bible and jesus christ walked out upon that word right right the believers had brought it to that place you realize then that mary had to give birth to the word right right you realize the bride is supposed to what give birth to the word but as mentioned to me here a while back about you're going to get into it one of these days we will because see there's another step in christ's mystery that you don't hear the preachers of this message bringing they bring the birth of the word and the bride is pragnated to give birth to the word but you better read brother around says mary was not the seed said she gave birth to the seed said because he was the seed see that means then there's got to be a step somewhere in this thing that somebody is going to be the seed not just give it birth they're going to be the seed was that would that be any problem when the brother branham was saying let's see how the messenger will be pointing to the sky pointing to a word born bride well i sure don't see it well then open your eyes and quit trying to figure it out by your own little category you're judging my apples by your rotten one and you know what all that'll do put them all in a barrel together just rotten whole barrel okay because that's all it'll do it'll mess it up all right well brother dave what are you getting at i'm getting to what i believe and what's been made known to me over all of these years and trying to put it in a category to help you to understand that this thing is not just an anointing right but it has to bring forth something that god had in his mind to fulfill all of his attributes now the anointing never brought the christ child i know it's going to require you think a little bit and consider this afternoon but please do it the anointing didn't bring the christ child there had to be a seed involved and it certainly wouldn't marry receiving the seed from gabriel as an intercourse now it's don't be stupid but mary had to receive from gabriel the seed the holy ghost shall overshadow thee and want to be created in you right will be the christ child she had to accept that that was more than just an anointing to fall upon her she met an actual angel to deliver and the holy spirit we know was the one because the angel couldn't do it the holy spirit is one that brought the physical part or we call the seed all right but you see we've read this today in it and i've got a bunch laying here but i won't bring them but we read over in ii peter that we were to be partakers of his divine nature now partakers of his divine nature is not just an anointing of spirit and remember the prophet said this is not to the world they can't have the divine nature of god sure they can have a portion of these virtues you know and they can do anything yes sir we know all about it but they cannot talk about his divine nature all right let me call it another part to where we can get it into today let me do it as brother branham and i'll bypass most of what i'm saying to bring it so if you get it fast enough brother anderson go ahead jump over to number nine that we've read so many times we want to go to number eight excuse me you must be born again a soul good or bad death doesn't change it i had a lot of scripture wrote down here on this one that i wanted to come in on what is a soul what skin what a soul is what is a soul it's you you are a soul the part inside of you and when you die every what shape that's holds in that's where it goes to its destination all right now you say well brother dale you spent a lot of time talking about it and we've heard you talk about that god was a soul now not have a soul because that can be just something impartation god is a soul because that's what he is a person the word soul means person or being or what you are all right now so look what he says here on the next one entombment go ahead and pull that one up which is number nine he talks about when jesus christ when he preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not the long suffering the days of noah his soul his spirit his theophany of his being went down now the prophet had no problem talking about the soul the spirit the person of his being going to hell call it a theophany call it that going over to number 10 which is questions and answers in 1957 and he's dealing with the point that i'll not leave my soul in hell neither will i suffer the holy one seek corruption how about that here's his body was in the grave and his soul was in hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany now you're going to argue with him so that's and you're not going to argue with me because it's not going to work we don't do it so let me get another one going to the number 11 which is the queen of sheba and read all the way up and down to where you want to god above us god with us god in us god and christ emmanuel god with us and then he gets down but when the life that was in the animal that died that life could not come back and be a spirit with the human being because it was animal life without a soul but when jesus died it was a soul of god all right and when that cell broke it could cleanse the church okay when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes over number 12. i used to think that god was angry with me but christ loved me but come to find out that christ is the very heart of god all right how many do you need on that the very heart of god where he's coming out of the garden in the very heart of god now heart is not heart is soul right heart is not your thumping gizzard heart is soul or center the heart of the peach is the center of it the seed it doesn't matter if it's offset just a little ain't got to be dead center but it's the heart of that seed all right now heart you can have a heart transplant that doesn't give you as we're talking about in a bible study last night you know you can have a heart transplant that doesn't give you another heart or somebody take your heart and then they they got you they got your soul and they give you somebody else's heart you got their soul now that's getting you know and i know i know unless it's explained that's a question that's been around the message ever since i've been around the message for 50 years because that's what they used to argue about along about 50 years ago they were just making and it started out making a mechanical heart and you know the guy did live for quite a while with a straight mechanical heart now it's probably updated now so much on it to get it to work and live a long time and i told them last night i said i need a transplant of my brain but you could take my head off sister gayle put another head on it i might look like brother dick if i put his head on me but i ain't gonna be him and ain't gonna think like him cause that's not the point it's not that it's all up here in this brain and that's your spirit it's through that it's what you are right your soul because you were made in the image of god is that true we spent a long time talking about it in the image of god soul theophany logo our speech son of god christ the anointings we've been quite quite a while on it you see it's not to change a heart the bible says i take out a stony heart and they give you a heart of flesh what does that mean well my heart was hard so he took it out and he put me in one it's soft now no no it's still the same old one that was taken before it's just ticking now what does it mean take out the heart of you not take the soul out of you but work on that soul until he mellows that soul that being that you are what else are you going to say it is give you a heart of flesh when i got my ideas okay with your ideas but you tell me where it's at but you see that's the thing that we've never seen i'll just close the notes and preach that's the point that the lord's dealt with me over these years to try to get you to understand that his plan and purpose was not to just be an anointing to come upon people to make us something his plan and purpose was to come down and be the very soul and bring the soul of mankind into being to where he could fellowship with us and then he could come down on the day of pentecost and give birth to that soul we'll get to that a little later on what we're talking about the new birth and you'll see better he came down on the day of pentecost he took the anointing and took the things and cleansed out 120. like i said why didn't the other 380 show up they didn't get cleaned out and getting prepared so they missed it i ain't saying they didn't come on night saying they wasn't part of the three thousand uh it's none of my business cause it does call them brethren all right which could signify that they did become later but at that time they wasn't in the upper room why because it wasn't that important to them the bible says in the parables where jesus was given the parable he said and they took the word and held it you read that in the bible we see that 120 in the upper room held onto that word because they finally got down to the end of it what did they say to jesus we don't understand but we know one thing now that's the words of eternal life so we'll just do what you say well at least he said do you finally believe you see what was happening now let me give illustrations like we did this morning for a minute then can you follow the soul of god down through the bible you would agree this morning at least you're not as your head or smile or something you know amen you know i'm talking about the anointing and seeing it coming down when i remember the anointing was not what worked upon david that got goliath killed it wasn't the anointing that condemned david it wasn't the anointing that straightened david out right there was something working upon the heart of the man will you agree with that that it was working upon that man and on his way home from the bed with bathsheba schofield even picks that up he said lord return unto me the joy thy salvation reading the psalms and look how many times he says my soul thirsteth after thee o god my soul read the psalms and see how many times it mentions soul what was that in moses he met a bush yeah he told him moses you go on my angel will go with you i keep wanting to walk over there okay my angel will go with you moses we see something struck into the heart of a man that a man said okay i'll go no matter what happens to me i'm gonna go tell him what truth of it is why is it that we spend so much time and how many times did brother branham preach on abraham and his faith right how many times he preached on abraham and his faith that a man not because an anointing was upon him but a man that would believe god when god says get your family get out of here i got something for you it wasn't just dealing in the spirit right how long could you preach on what i'm talking about that down through that old testament you see the very soul of almighty god anointing anointing in the fiery furnace uh unfolds that anointing would have just went wormwood you remember brother branham you remember him what he said wormwood said you know he's the one destroyed the world with water he said let me go down i'll put that fire out so don't you see what you're doing he said just hold on a minute he let it get real bad but you know what he said he said i'm going down myself i'm not going to send somebody else i ain't sending you wormwood i'm going down myself and when a man looked down in there a center man looked down in he saw four men right something was changing that man's sin until he looked down and he said and he was like the son of god who was it in moses and as your prophet said it that it looked like moses told god a better way of doing it remember the story moses said lord if you're going to kick them people you're going to take me first that wasn't no anointing anointing would have said hey okey-dokey we're just going to take over for you we'll just get rid of them but can you see throughout that old testament the very divine nature of almighty god as it's unfolding down through the old testament coming forth and see him coming to the to the basis of of the prophets and the things that they done like i said about moses that could tell god a better way of doing something he brought around and said i wondered about that till i saw it was christ now he wouldn't talk about just an anointing right now the anointing would have done what remember moses you remember the god that was the king second in command and you know him by seeing christ he left is that right am i in the bible he went to egypt but he come out of there as a conqueror and like i was saying this morning then isn't it odd that he said moses said now god who do i tell them he said i'm not going god said i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob you know how i've always paraphrased that because it's good to me moses said okey dokey they had you they each one had you for their time but i'm not going because of what they had said what do i tell him he said just tell him i am sent you it goes down to egypt pharaoh says who's gonna tell me he said i am he becomes so personal with the god until his thoughts was upon the people and you tell me that to moses didn't have the soul of god dealing with him in the divine nature not as a new birth now come on we're going to get to that if i have to close i'll start wednesday not talking about the new birth moses didn't have it but that divine nature of god that soul of almighty god was right there and he loved the people and he was willing to die with the people whatever it took all right we see then one day that verse we read jesus was the very heart and soul of god why because he was god there walked on the shores of galilee a man that wasn't like moses who said let me kill him wasn't like david give me a sword here's a man that had the very soul of almighty god because he was the soul of almighty god in in christ he turned the other cheek right he loved the sinner right you do him wrong he didn't fight back because he did have the divine nature because he was a divine nature right right now what are you and i supposed to have and maybe you'll see why we're not too far up the pyramid maybe because that's talking about the divine nature that comes to you after you're born again right sure you get the divine nature when you're born again by the faith the love of god coming into you right yeah okay but then you're partakers of the divine nature as you grow in grace and knowledge not in knowledge of head but when we come to a place of it being part of us do you see what i'm talking about you see where i've been headed for months to go back after coming down through there and seeing that and realizing where sin took place at and what it was in and realizing the spot that god would have to start dealing do you realize he had to start dealing with those disciples in their memory reason conscious affections and he planted the word into their soul their being but then he had to give his own life that word to be able to be made alive can you see the soul of god as it come down through the bible and it's still coming down how it's unfolded down to the present hour that we're living the plan and purpose of god it's not just an anointing coming down take the anointing and you can die and go to hell take the new birth and your heaven bound you're fulfilling all the things that those men back there couldn't comprehend why but they would sing about him they pierced my hands and my feet no writings in there of him fighting back right no writings of this that's why man couldn't understand him because there he come as a baby they was expecting a warrior even when he got up to the disciples will you restore the kingdom even after his resurrection in the book of acts i believe it's acts 1 and 8 somewhere right in there after his resurrection after his talking to him after him fellowshipping with them for a time they still said you're going to restore the kingdom to israel brother brown said they still had their mind on a literal kingdom he said but it wasn't the literal kingdom that jesus was speaking of it was a spiritual kingdom do you see the soul of god you see the divine nature of almighty god as it unfolds to the word it is it comes down to you and i the soul the prophet said is worth a million worlds he said if there was one and that's all there was he said he would have still went to calvary and died for that one see we think it's just an anointing the new birth is not just an anointing the new birth is the receiving of eternal life that's what caught me when i heard this man we preached about eternal life but we preached it one of these days we're going to get it because it's up yonder somewhere but this man began to talk about eternal life here changed my whole thinking you want to know what caught me that that he spoke of a god that was real in my day not a god of the past or a god of the future he spoke of a god in reality was right here he spoke of the coming of the lord and the first coming brought the soul of god down through time what's the second coming to be then we'll see we've got it all figured out it's got to be the third fourth gotta be this gonna be happening what did he say when he got to the seals he said go on into simplicity i'm paraphrasing it but it's very close he said because if you don't you'll work your way away from it continue as you are but everybody's trying to figure it out instead of sitting back and looking at reality of what it's been well brother dale i always thought coming to the lord resisted come to the lord was that well it's got to be the coming of the lord that's plain sins right and if it's the coming of the lord he's been coming he's come already because there's a first coming in a second coming right in the bible we are in the second coming right and if they were partakers and brought had to be there to bring the first coming what do you think is happening through you and i today it's bringing to christ the second coming of jesus christ coming to christ in what did he say bright form bright form the coming of the lord is the revealing of his word or making his word alive that has been written now you can talk about all the other things you think it's related to this and think it's related to that but you remember you got to come back to where your anchor is in the word first coming brought jesus christ in human flesh the second coming will be now you're going to listen we're not the finish of the second coming come on been in the message too long i'm quote too good the second coming of jesus christ this is the bride coming to christ coming out of the church the second coming of jesus christ is in the millennium okay use something to think about the second coming is in the millennium because in the millennium he has everything connected to his coming from the beginning to the end because the millennium will be to the jews right not to you and i we're there on a honeymoon but we're there on a honeymoon so that that'll put us there that puts the jews there that's your second coming of jesus christ now if you don't believe that go into matthew um my goodness what is it is it 17 we're speaking of moses and elijah yeah right you know brother brown said that is the second coming who moses and elijah to who to the jews right so the second coming will climax to you and i the rapture yes that's the beautiful part but the reality of the finality will be to the jews in the millennium when they see him standing on earth and they'll say where did you get the nail prints through the two prophets but then when it finishes up they won't just talk about seeing it they will see that they are in the millennial reign because the millennial reign is to the jews oh what a wonderful beautiful picture that's why even your feel sealed you has to be tied into it that's why there's got to be a resurrection come on we go to that welcome table brother tatum love that scripture to the welcome table what with guests with abraham isaac and jacob they'll be at the marriage supper and a welcome table there won't be bride the jews will be in the millennium won't be bright but it's a promise to them they will be the servants and if you don't nothing more than just 144 000. brother branham says in the church age book right in the beginning i'll find it for you that that 144 000 will be in the millennium if you want to argue the point of whether they're going to be here or that but i believe the feel sealed jew will be in the millennium because brother brown says the millennium is to the jews as a nation because of the promise to david you sit on his throne he said he'll sit on that throne in the millennial ring you know who's going to be on that throne with him his wife so then as this morning i covered it you can follow the anointing to come down but now can you see the very heart and soul of almighty god as it developed unthrough the bible to bring his first coming and now to develop into bringing his second coming you might not think that means a lot but i do come on brothers let's stand when we talk about the coming of the lord we got it all figured out is this that or the other well let's start where i'm at and then we can go on to other things you say oh yeah well it's what i said the truth if it's the truth then that's where we must put our bases upon the word of god that's right not upon your idea or my idea but upon god's word and it'll all be finished anybody have a need with what we got brother think on these things bless you do you know that savior as your new birth can you follow the christ down through the bible can you follow the very soul and person or being of god as he's made itself manifest down through the bible right down to where we are now you see why we keep putting the title the glory of his person because when we get back to that it'll be very easy to preach because you can go back and see it higher like wool his feet that's right you can see all the way through the bible his person is being revealed king jesus either side oh why don't you believe why don't it release your faith oh jesus our little sister to her dad and you'll be with her let her shine the light of christ let everything be okay we send this for a safe journey back and for her to be taken care of in jesus name anybody else we were talking this morning sister johnny had told us about a situation that where brother is a is a minister in a church and that to get this big name person to come for 45 minutes it cost him 15 for the guy to come 45 minutes and the pastor never shook hands with him because they brought him in he delivered his point and back out with his little group and left and the pastor never even shook his hand but it cost him fifteen thousand dollars i said you know i'm kind of a dumb person i guess but if i knew a guy in california or china india whatever that i knew could help you you know could help you to understand god's word i wouldn't cure to spend twenty thousand fifty thousand that's nothing to me i just want to see you helped and i wouldn't care but i'd want them to feed you while they're here and it wouldn't matter to me whether i shook the person's hand or not i wouldn't care it's just whether or not that they'd feed you that's how much i care about you that i would spend the money just to get the person here that i'm happy but see then i know in real life if if it was some noted name you know and had to have that then he wouldn't be able to help you so we ain't gonna get him okay we ain't gonna have to pay it okay cause he ain't gonna help you okay you gotta have fifty thousand dollars to get here he ain't gonna help but pay his ticket here okay you know that's fine to pay his expenses but if you understand the point to get somebody to help you i search constantly through listening to try to find brothers that i believe that can help you and i want them to come and deliver their heart to you because i want them to help you that's my goal is to help you anything else why does it make any difference what does it matter about life and money and doing something well brother dale is as poor as i am but you see for churches all in trying to get you to see christ and what he's doing is my goal not what he has done and what he will do but what he's doing right now because that tomorrow won't help you yesterday can be a foundation to kind of help your faith and do it you that saw brother branham and saw the ministry and the things and know about the way that he's done and all that's a help to you right thank god but that still ain't gonna save you won't save you to think about what he was it'll save you when you try to get the same god in you that he had in him because that was his goal right that was his point let's sing one more then we'll to quit the fire going until salvation is the only thing that once you get it you want to give it away and if you don't want to give it away i know you don't understand my language i'm not talking like that but if you got salvation and you don't want to know about something that you can give it to somebody else if it's impossible then you don't have it because this is spiritual multiplication you get the seed you plant the seed god will quicken the seed into the hearts of other sit people i wish for you my friend this happiness you can't depend on him has come to me i what is a christian life living for others because you know what i love what brother brown said one day he said it takes god to be a man he said it takes christ to be a christian he was the only man that was worth anything and that life in him coming back up on you're dismissed lord jesus just blessed father as we're dismissed and we go home give everybody a safe journey we love you we thank you in jesus name you're dismissed i want the world to know there you
