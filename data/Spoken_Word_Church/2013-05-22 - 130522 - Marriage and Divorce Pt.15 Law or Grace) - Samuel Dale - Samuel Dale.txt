speak of on the invisible Union so just remember that yeah I know you've already prayed for brother colie's sister but remember her used come to church here years ago and just pray that the Lord would

okay so you contact Wade and them about thaten Romans 7 any other announcements I always miss something we we got around now that we don't even have to announce something coming up this weekend it's doing good amen enjoyed this last weekend and pray that the Lord blessed you and helped you in in understanding amen Romans 7 dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for this night and your love unto us thank you for Calvary thank you for you thank you for all things and Lord we know that they come to us freely we don't have to pay anything for it we just have to receive it we ask you now to just have your way and let your love and manifestation and Grace be with each one of us tonight as we read about you and talk about you then you come and speak to our hearts and our lives remember the sick among us Lord the many many different things many sicknesses you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you sent your word now we believe that the manifestation of the healings and things will also come into reality because we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord in Jes Jesus name amen Romans 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth now we won't get to that tonight what we want to do is just basically get in to uh what is the law and you know reality and coming down down but then you just think on that thing you know think on the point we we want to say to the women or go to the next verse you know but remember it starts off by saying and when it's saying that that word man there is not signifying just singular that the man's the only one that needs to be dead to the law it's meaning mankind it's meaning men women and everything you know in doing all right so know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law and that the law hath dominion over man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then while her husband liveth she then so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulterous but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefor my brethren you also are become dead to the law now remember verse one dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we will be still speaking and we'll put the number wise this is part 15 on marriage and divorce and we'll still tie it together to where that when they put it together and they they like to have it in a series point to where that so many numbers and then they'll put it in a group and and offer it to anyone that wants to hear uh you know our thoughts on marriage and divorce and thing but I think it's time to move on up a little further in where we're at and uh you know to be able to understand because like sister Gail said if not then we're going to be around here a long time and a lot of us is getting too old to be around here a long time so I'm wanting things to get underway aren't you and that's uh you know but we we need it all right now I want to back up into what we were talking Sunday afternoon because I pray that you will take that message and and listen to it over and over and over and and you know U maybe get what I'm talking about that's right cuz I put something in there Sunday afternoon that I have studied upon for for many years but yet not fully clear in my own self as to how to express it you know to open up and speak about it and to to say things but to see that why brother brandom would talking about uh on especially the invisible Union that a woman can be forgiven right but said she can never be justified in this life right all right then we want to go to but I thought the grace of marriage and divorce Justified us well now I I want that thought to be brought to me from Brother Brandon's message of marriage and divorce because to my understanding that's why I kept saying that Sunday afternoon he said go on as you are right yes sir sure we were forgiven right amen but if you're saying going as you are you know that means that under a situation of life and he said it y he said ' we can't take these things and break them down you remember right after he made that statement he said we can't do that he said so just don't try to do this that just go on as you are and leave it alone now as I said he didn't mean if you went there married to three women you went home with three women he didn't say that or he wouldn't have been given the grace or the porn of the thought or God wouldn't have been speaking through him all right now but yet when you get to the invisible Union you hear him speaking of of how that justified means as though you never done it you done it he guilty then you're forgiven you're Justified then you go on in through the message and you'll find out that it's as though you never done it right but then he finishes the message up by saying the real you never done it that's right all right so then that way we've got these things to go forward into to get a better understanding and I I just ask you to to go through that this past Sunday's afternoon's message and just ponder over the thoughts of what was said and you know maybe it will open up some things to where we can understand now Paul says that he's illustrating he's speaking of marriage and divorce but he's using that as an illustration right to speak on Law and Grace now we as I said Sunday afternoon we turned it around right we were saying that everything all the way down to the end was pointing to the grace of marriage and divorce for our natural things I I don't agree with that I'm sorry we will get to it in the message more Sunday you got to come through the new birth amen all right see how that husband is dead you got to come through the grace of marriage and divorce and see that husband is dead then you can talk about what Paul is speaking of and the the thing brother Randon was speaking of on the invisible Union so we'll have to take it and break it down and we just keep going on it for a while and you know and I hope you don't do like one brother did about us on a certain topic and we you know he got kind of irritated and he stomped his foot a few times up here and said get off of this that and go on you know well I hope you don't say that about I drag a lot of times I think but if I preach really what I see you know we would be a year or two on this one point I mean I would have no problem preaching at you ought to know that by now if I can preach 95 to 100 sermons off of one thought you ought not have any trouble thinking about that it could be done I'm trying to shorten it instead of bringing out I'm trying to cut back instead of because I'm preaching to people here that are are seasoned in the gospel and know what we've already already taught so I don't have to teach it over in every service I can just hit it go on go on just keep going all right but now brother brandham I gave them to you there Sunday where brother brandham on paragraph 35 of the invisible Union you can go ahead and pull that up cuz I want these to stay with you I want these quotes to stay with you of what he's saying you know and and we gave these Sunday but I want to give them over again I want them I want them to stay with you I want them to to embed into your uh thinking ability and put it all together and then you'll see when we begin to to speak more on the things that you'll see it just going right back to that same quote all right so look what he's saying on paragraph 35 of the invisible Union Paul here is given an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce see we want to make the marriage and divorce the height instead of no if you're illustrating with something you're typing with it Paul is typing with marriage and divorce y to show us about law and Grace amen all right see we we want to turn that around one sister came out after the service over she said I'm glad you said that she said because that's what I believed said I believed in other words I'll I'll phrase my own words onto the end of it not hers see a lot of people thinks that we can get these old bodies straightened out if we can find some kind of a gimmick or a way or a a something you know that we can figure out the these old bodies we're going to be ready to get out of here well I think we're dealing with the wrong end you know I think we're to deal with the inward man that's right and then the outer man will come into subjection to the inward man that's right all right now see so Paul is what he's illustrating it like marriage and divorce these passages very sell preach on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater port of marriage and divorce you remember what I brought out greater portion you got a portion that's a small amount or just a start but a greater portion you're Justified that's a portion of the Holy Ghost Sanctified that's a portion of the Holy Ghost but the baptism is the Holy Ghost so it's a greater portion see something keeps going on and on and on and on and climbing higher and higher all right said but it also pertains to a greater no marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order here that we as a church can no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and would be legal and lawful about it than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband he said I have my own thoughts on those things and he said it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy remember the entire Bible right would speak of the end time but in the end time the truth would come forth look at the next quote paragraph 43 the illustration here showing the relationship he's not showing the relationship Paul is not showing the relationship of a man and a wife or whatever this that and the other he's using that to show the relationship between Christ and the bride right are you following me showing the relationship of bride to Christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him now when we get on down into the message you'll see that that's what's taking place we are being brought to him all right amen is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always the type of the church because the church church is considered a bride a bride and she is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God go on to the next from paragraph 81 I want you to get these and just keep keep reading them over and talking about an illustration or an you know illustrating it showing it excuse me showing it by examples amen see then you'll see the whole Bible his types and shadows brother random was the greatest typologist that's ever been because he would always using something to type it with some telling a story all of those long stories of the armor Meat Packing Company and guy you know and the the little girl and the wash woman and all that you hear them about 400 times probably in the the message but one of these days that'll don't on you what he's talking about he's talking about Christ in the church right that's just illustrating it see and watch he says the woman he's using typ in it paragraph 81 we find that her body is the bedding grounds and therefore it is a sacred trust not to defile that now I'm speaking now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking of you women whatever you are that's between you and God or you men but I'm speaking of the church and Christ all right speaking of Christ and the church showing us that no matter what we deal with that our old husband has got to be dead amen now if he's not dead and we marry again what if we done y amen and I I want to say this and I'll say it over and over what about the prophet preaching the invisible Union to the people that are in that church the day he was preaching it and raking down so hard about denominationalism and how that old husband must be dead but how many people got up and walked out and said I'm not going to this church no more that's right are you understand but see it wasn't the time right amen and it might not have been the people either but it wasn't the time to understand now I'm saying it this way and trying my best to say it and I'll keep saying it I'm not saying those people were not born again that's right there's probably a lot in the building there that day was born again but you know brother brandham was preaching around the world against denominationalism right but he says I have no word attend them to but yet you can pull out you can never enter the door of a denominational church and be just as organized and denominated as anybody that's born and die and dies in there you know because denominationalism is just a manifestation of a spirit right organization is the first stage then it goes into Den to denominationalism all right that's why you don't see the people of this message putting a sign out in front William brandham Tabernacle they've got you know one there in Jeffersonville but that's you know but not you know you don't see that why because that would be stamping a a head of saying we're a denomination and then if you did and you stamped it out there and said we're we believe everything William Brown said then somebody walk up to him and say y'all teach two souls and two Lords and all these other doctrines and i' take the sign off the front yeah because you don't believe what the man said but we'll get to this and go over it and over and over it but the main thought in mind is one thing for us to be born again I'll go over this Sunday because this is where I'll start on it but I want us to lay it down for you to think on for us to be born again that old husband must be dead amen right your old adamic nature right all right and in the marriage and divorce situation that old husband must be dead right then in the invisible invisible Union that old denominational husband must be dead that's right amen for us to be married to Christ amen and like I said you could have said to those people that day sitting there you could say to a lot of people today and they say I was sitting there when he preached it so well did you get out of organized relig well about 20 years later I begin to think about it you know I'm telling the truth but I think on it look at paragraph 56 invisible union now remember the prophet of God said I'm trying to show you where the church stands that's what we just read paragraph 81 where the church stands so what does he say here the prophet Paul here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is you I'm going to show you a denomination I'm going to show you a denomination an organization now this is how simple we're going to have to break it down to to see what it really is you know that there's a lot of people in the message lamb bash brother brandham for saying Paul was a Prophet come on a lot of people say Paul would no Prophet they said it right here they said it in ministers meetings they said it and everything else that Paul wasn't no prophet that's a denominational idea right see because the denominations didn't want Paul to be a prophet right you realize why they don't want him to be a prophet then they don't have to agree with what he says and what he talk right man agreed right now that's how simple it is to be a denominational person and that husband if you're you're doing that with is still right there flirting with you in your mind ain't no Bible that says Paul was a prophet well one time he said it you can do what you want to with it he said I magnify my own office so you know if he was an apostle then he magnify his own office but just illustrating all right illustrating are you listening right use an example to show you how simple it is for us to be the prophet Paul here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead she cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living she by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her first husband is living and if she should do such a sin she should be called an adulterous I'm speaking of the natural now to type it with the spiritual he's not speaking of the spiritual to try to show you the natural he's speaking of the natural to show the spiritual right if this woman would commit such a sin then she is marked and adulterous and she has two living husbands at the same time therefore she has forfeited by doing this her rights to God and Heaven by doing so she sure has she is an outcast from the economy of God according to the scpt scriptures that I've just read now that's Romans 7 all right now illustrating it speaking of marriage and divorce speaking of the Natural Woman you know woman speaking of and illustrating by that to show us what God is expecting with the rest of it all right now let's read over again Romans 7 go ahead and pull up number five brother know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law this is not to just an outcast or anybody that's right that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth now are you reading that do you believe that no Brother D I got born again I ain't under no law law was done away you you you didn't come through the Baptist or nowhere law ain't in existence no more it was done away back God we're under grace New Testament is Grace we'll get to it in a minute grace came away before the law ever started right Abraham's Covenant was Grace but you see our ideas our denominational thoughts what we've been taught Paul ain't no Prophet show me anywhere in the Bible where it says Paul is a prophet that's what people are saying brother ROM call to all theur Church age Messengers prophets you not no trouble call him Luther a prophet but you see how easy it is to have a denominational idea and let not know it you see why it's been 50 years almost since the the going away of the Prophet is still trying to preach I hope we've got out of the dates of the times and the seasons and thing got through marching around hor and at Le at least got to Cades barnea cuz remember they came to Cades barnea and it was only just a few days journey to the promised land right seemed like brother around said 5 days or something I was looking at while ago so many days to the to the promised land and you realize they walked you think 40 years within five miles y they didn't Venture very far no study your Bible and see even they went 100 miles you could still look back and see a lot of it but that's how blind we can be but now look what he says know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law had the law ha dominion over anyone let's translate that into anyone or mankind as long as he liveth CU if you don't you're going to say the woman's not even under it see how carnal you can be now he goes down to make sure that you don't he interpolates you remember that years ago and I got in trouble trying to explain interpolate it means you simply trying to explain something that's all it means Paul now interpolates the woman in to make sure that nobody could come along and say well the women are not under that that's just the men women would never under law man's always under law Church you think I'm trying to be funny or silly or arrogant or hateful or some something I'm trying to save your soul and mine to show how silly we are verse Two for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband watch that's right the man is bound by the law over everything is the woman only bound to the law by her husband no it's simply explaining it this is this is the the man is all of this mankind everybody but illustrating it as a woman all right for the woman which ha an husband is bound by the law of her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man see that old husband's got to be dead not just divorced all right go ahead with the next one while we're on that point because Paul says the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she's at Liberty be to be married to whom she will only in the Lord that's right so you want to leave that off oh she's free to marry anybody only in the Lord the man is only he's free to marry what wife dies he's free to marry but he must marry what in the Lord amen well we certainly didn't do it brother de well all right right so then you got to believe for Grace then you got to cry out for Grace right amen right but think about it now her husband must be dead that's the only way the woman can be loose from that law is for her husband to be dead right you know the word of God bounds her the law we talk about the laws we show that law is just Ten Commandments no the word law is the word of God do you need all of that I looked at today how many times brother brand we talking about the the the god in letter form the Bible is God in letter form but listen not just put him away right as we get to it later you'll understand more what brother Mo used to say about it he said what we do is that we get our coat and hat and we move we change meet and houses but you know what we do when we go to the next meeting house some of you run into trouble here because this old boy don't BK too much and you bring your thoughts from somewhere else and try to bring it in here and I'll bring it out of here and show you it's wrong I have to right you see one of these days you'll realize what a pastor means you know that a pastor means husband I have to look over you as a husband to a wife you know you being a wife well now well come on if you ain't got enough sense to figure that out then you got a problem because I'm not just preaching to a bunch of women I'm preaching to men and women if you need to explain it but think about it see we say we we we left that as I said to those people that day when brother Brown preached so hard against organized religion did they get up and walk out and say is there anywhere that I can go that won't be organized no like my wife said they wanted to watch the gift take place they wanted the signs and the Wonders they didn't want brother randam there and if it hadn't been for a few of them he wouldn't have been into the businessmen some of those men put their their whole stake in that on the line to even to get him an ability to preach and the Christian businessmen cuz they didn't want him how would you want somebody that's constantly telling you you're lost but come on see brother random paragraph 151 152 indivisible Union not just put away he's got to be dead right not just put away there is no divorcement for the woman and listen in the body of Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female you agree so we are all the feminist body of Jesus Christ is feminist it is not masculine he's the masculine we're the feminist so whatever speaks to one speaks to the other all right now to try to get a thought as I said we'll pick up Sunday and more or less go through the new birth marriage and divorce go invisible Union and things the way I'm thinking now but I want you to think about the law so you ask most people say what is the law and they say the Ten Commandments right what would be your answer you know what is the law The Ten Commandments the law is God's word right amen whether it be the Ten Commandments or what is it the 11th commandment I mean the 13th commandment you remember love your neighbors whatever it is there Jesus speaking on the The Forgotten commandment what does it mean to be bound to the law as long as you're alive according to that then there's no hopes whatsoever of anything other than just dying right because you're bound to the law as long as you're alive now man chose law right now what about a group of people what about people who would actually choose law brother random titled the message what is it Church choosing law for Grace they actually chose law thinking it was Grace and it sounds so close until that was one scripture I had a lot of trouble with we'll get to it in a minute in Exodus 19 because of the way that it reads it reads like that God says this and they says we'll do it the brother Brown said that was the biggest mistake Israel ever made all right now I want the point to dwell in your mind what is law you got a law of gravity you got many natural laws brother R said there's plenty of laws in the word of God because the law is the letter of the word amen that's why Paul said the letter kth there is no Grace in the law right now we're going to read in a minute so don't just go BL BL BL off and cut off your computers and like you ought to know me well enough you listen to two tapes you order at least know enough to hang on a minute grace was before the law in the law and after the law all right that's what your Prophet had to say so just think with me what is law the letter of the Bible is law Paul what is the law he said it was a thing that I thought y brought life right we get back to those scriptures is that right is that what Paul said he said I was alive once but he said sin revived and I died no longer I that liveth cuz I died right amen Paul purely truly know that the only way any person could have anything was to die right you remember the Jim Jones situation you know down what was it Guyana where they went down there and there was some old guys are at work you know they're always trying to do something smart because of all of us Brothers being there together one of them asked Fred Hooper one day he said has Sam ever tried to get you to kill yourself he said ever since the Man known me that's what he's been trying to do you see as long as we're alive we got problems that's right my daddy died in 1945 you know it be kind of hard to accuse him of a crime right well because he's dead right all right but now think about it what is the law the law is all of this Bible old and new that is not revealed to you and I that's why man thinks it's a book of rules y That's Why They preach it as a book of rules if we can just get the women to line up but we be ready to go I've heard hours and hours of sermons to those messages like that what is law it's God's word that has been delivered delivered to you and I and we hold it in our hands but it has never been put in our heart right if it's revealed it's no longer law right now here's a good one how many times have you ever heard me explain this or try to you ask people say where did the New Testament start and they'll get in you know then you say well are you still under the law no law ended where where did it end well Christ is the end of the law yeah but read the rest for righteousness say Jesus said I didn't come to destroy the law I came to magnify that's right Paul said Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery Jesus said if you look on a woman to lust in your heart you've committed adultery already see magnified it am you magnify the law and make it honorable right amen I don't know where we get that far tonight but you know that the Ten Commandments was God in letter form to the people amen if I I if I could just know more about God read your Bible right well now now brother d i I just can't understand it so I I'll get me some good news for Modern Men that's all right but that's what you need but I just can't I just can't but I can read some of them new versions well good as long as it takes you to the same God the old versions took you to but when you change God's in the way with another book what have you got amen how come it Paul is saying that the man as long as he leaveth he's bound to the law did he say Jews only that's what you're saying he would say if that's the way you're making it LO and come to Israel you never heard that one Lo they come to Israel we Gentiles we were never under the law and Paul really like to illustrate that by saying you bunch of Gentiles and I'm paraphrasing about 40 scriptures but said you bunch of Gentiles think you're something but said the word didn't even come to you y That's right is that scripture he said the oracles come to Israel said adoption don't pertain to you that it pertains to Israel so then you just take your little Doctrine and little denominational ideas and you just zero yourself out you know I'm trying to get a point across what is the law well in the natural the law of the land is what mankind whether it be the Constitutions Etc is all supposed to be based upon that that man wrote down a bunch of things that said don't do this and it was called the law don't speed don't drink and drive don't do this don't do that you know it's called a law well they can write you a ticket for on a 55 mph Road for 56 mph because you just broke the law now watch what we try to see we want to explain we want to explain but brother Dale the County police don't do it that way they got to go 5 miles over they don't have to go one half a mile over they just do that that way you see a state patrol he can write it down if it's one mile over any County policeman can write you up if it's one mile over it might not hang up because the courts is going to say hey that's just not that's just being nitpicking well who's nitpicking is the Georgia State Patrol right one law is a book of rules right the Bible is a book of rules right amen unless you're born again right now what about a book of rules don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that Paul what about you in that book of rules concerning the law blameless right is that what he said amen in other words he done everything he's supposed to do and didn't do all the things he wasn't supposed to do but brother randam said no man can keep the law that's right Paul could just brag in the bases that he didn't break it but he said I thought that was life right so but I found it to be death what I thought was saving me was killing me law is a set down Stamped Out written out form of some government that has declared it whether it be God through his word or whether it be the policeman you know the the Constitutions the the governors the the the presidents the things it's a written out point to tell you that if you don't break that you don't have to worry about it no right but Paul says if you don't die now he was the guy remember I was quoting a moment ago that said I didn't break the law he said concerning the law blameless come on is that scripture but yet he says a man as long as he's alive he's Bound by the law but if he's dead he's free from that law but you see church that's where we don't understand is what I say and we we we back in organized religion we would tell you in a hurry that we was never under the law we were gentiles yeah carried away the dumb Idols boy what part is that going to put us but you see that's what we've been taught now let me back up on Marriage and divorce just a second why did brother brandham say we were in the marital situations we were in he said because of misinterpreted theology in other words somebody's wording thoughts and ideas that we took to be God's word I believe it was brother Mo told that time he said that he saw serpent seed and somebody tried to talk him out of something like that somebody did and somebody talked him out of it well if you talking out of it what is it but now listen law according to Paul is the word right the entire Bible is the law and the only part of it that is Grace is God to speak to you and I to save us from that you see where you'd be if you was a Gentiles saying that we were never under the law then what would you be saved from you understand Grace was a way before the law came into existence Grace was first amen right Grace was where man sinned in the garden and an atonement was made amen Grace we think we got to run over to Abraham with it now that's where you just coming down to where he stamps it down to one man and said Hey listen you take this and study on it and your generation out of you will have it there was Grace before the law ever came into existence go ahead and pull up number eight brother in Paradox re 65 paragraph 65-66 and also Grace provided an atonement the sacrificial lamb we're getting to that this week on the sacrifice to blood because darlay is your healing so on the atonement had been provided before there was any law Grace was before the law during the law am and after the law amen now when we read it in a minute you're going to have to say wait a minute now let me swallow l r said there's no Grace in the law he said it's a policeman to put you in jail but notice the way he's saying it Grace was before the law during the time would the law be in existence there was Grace what saved David from being killed Nathan the prophet which was Grace am that's right right he said but I've prayed for you David you're not going to die amen Grace was before the law during the law and after the law so there was Joshua read this very carefully Joshua representing Grace that was during the law you remember Moses the one that brought it and then Joshua representing Grace was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place so there was Grace during the time of the law the atonement could be made during the time of the law The Ten Commandments that we want to talk about Grace is the oldest teacher there is in the world it teaches us to not our ungodliness Grace was the lamb that stood slain before the foundation of the world Amen it was Grace that kept Eve from being killed not Adam injecting a seed right you see how easy you take a denominational thought and what are you doing with it you just died but brother so and so says so what but you you you just you're just against everybody well who was it Martin Luther was it that they said don't you know that yeah the whole world's against you he said I want them to know I'm all I'm against them too Amen brother told Wade the other day he said one thing brother Dale don't like is false Doctrine that's one thing I don't like right is false Doctrine CU false Doctrine will kill you yes sir and the worst thing is false doctr is not exposed right amen that's it now let me say something it'll be about 20 messages down the road but maybe it'll help you uh Brother Dean they taught you in karate to if you do not allow your mind to uh look at a block and pass through that block with your mind you with the ability of a soft hand you can bust it but if your mind ever blocks that thought you're going to have a busted hand right you say well what are you talking about I'm talking about that they told everybody you know that nobody could ever run a 4 minute wouldn't it 4 minute mile it was just impossible well here comes a guy along that according to records would have never supposed to walk or anything and you know they just forgot to tell him and he just went out and broke it you know there's a law that says a bumblebee cannot fly his wings spread is not big enough but they just ain't been able to explain that to the Bumblebee he said what are you talking about I'm talking about if the word of God can keep being revealed to you and I somebody's going to walk right straight through death and look at it and life at it that's right that's what I'm pointing at but we got to get rid of all these laws that's bound us yes sir we got to get rid of our ideas and thoughts that binds us and get free amen we asked Josh to pull the sound system and peek it a little bit to make make me a little bit finer cuz we' got down to a course like form and the way I'm hollering tonight I don't think it going to be no course to this one I think we get it pretty good but now listen Grace was there in Joshua but couldn't couldn't be made manifest because why what's the prophet saying amen because the law of Moses was binding everybody yeah right and the law of Moses binding the people do you understand why then that when 12 went over right 12 crossed over 10 come back the law had them bound we cannot take the land two came back picking up the thought of Grace amen right but which one won right Joshua and Caleb was never capable of explaining what they saw and the reason they believe they could take the land because the people was bound by their law of their mind holding on to Moses we got what Moses says you remember the marriage and divorce Moses gave us a writing of divorcement to put our wives away for any cause Jesus said now Moses didn't tell you that that's right well do you think they quit believing Moses and started believing Jesus if you do there's something wrong with you mentally let anything else they never stopped it no see that's why I don't believe in converting bodies and and spirits of people right why you get them in with a hot dog you get them out with a get them in with a a hot dog you get him out with a hamburger that's right but if you can touch that Soul amen and talk to that Soul a while the lord gave me years ago ability one time and that's all he ever let me do it that I backed up in my own self and stood and looked at people from what he saw and it was literally as a tunnel just standing looking and just went back into it and I saw what he saw but you know what happened when I come back to my natural I saw what I saw y right amen but listen Grace was D the prophet says with Joshua but could not now are you going to follow me amen could not come into its proper place why because the people were still looking at Moses right right the problem with it they couldn't get Moses off the scene amen exactly right that's right okay but you know what there's a lot of places in this message that preaches that we got to get the prophet off the scene you ain't never heard me preach that so you think I was bringing a point then to drive down that thought no oh H you missed it see I just trapped you but Moses was still on the scene in those people's mind and they couldn't follow Joshua Moses was still on the scene in them Pharisees minds and they couldn't follow Jesus right amen there's your law the cornal Mind Right amen law deals in the carnality of our human mind don't do this don't do that well I never done that so I'm okay I know I ain't going to get very far so trying to figure out which way to go you realize that the children of Israel chose law for Grace or thinking it was Grace right all right so I'll hold those quotes there in Joe if you will orever who's on it jump over let's get a thought and I'll just quit because I know I can't I can't continue all the way through so I'll pick these up Sunday how that and prove how that the children of Israel accepted law instead of Grace all right let's go to Exodus 19 and I want to read the scriptures and just see we'll come back to it Sunday and you just hold on to it run around and said that was the biggest mistake Israel ever made was in Exodus 19 I want to see where their mistake was Exodus 19 Moses went up un God you remember the mountain and the things this is coming back out this is not the the time over there where they were end and coming down you know and and do this is when they come on out and they're standing next to the mountain Moses went up un God and the Lord called to him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel and watch tell them what tell them this tell the children of Israel this that I have to say about them ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and bear ye on you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priest in a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel this was before law all right Moses came and called for all the Elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words not the Ten Commandments that's the next chapter chapter 20 is The Ten Commandments laid before their faces these words words of what praise Grace around said God provided a prophet a pillar of fire a healing atonement that was Grace to Israel right and they wanted a law they wanted something to do but now I want you to read it in there and see if you can find them saying they want something to do I used to bother me when I read that to be able to sit down and just read the scripture plain and not be able to see God says you're this you're that you're that all you got to do is just keep my word you know just like line up and be fine Moses came and called the Elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord now where is it there of a bad thing of accepting law it looks like because law has not been spoken yet it look like they were just saying heyen we believe we're A peculiar people we believe we're a priest we believe we're a holy nation all you say Lord that we'll do do you understand what I'm saying come on I mean do I need to keep going over and over the point you to think about it the prophet said this is the biggest mistake they ever made when they chose law instead of Grace Grace had already provided everything and Grace told them what they were it looked like God gave them the law it looked like God was the one that was doing it come on read your Bible look at it but we got to believe what the prophet had to say and then we see the final results the final results I won't have time to get to it but the final results is when you get over in Exodus 20 after the law is delivered and God came down on the mountain and they said don't let Moses don't let God Speak to us anymore God Moses you go get it bring it down showing they had made a mistake but the prophet of God said that was the biggest mistake we'll pick that part up in the thought cuz if I go very far I got to go into these look at number 16 let's see what brother Bram had to say about I've jumped to about eight quotes So we pick them up Sunday go ahead to number 16 which is taken of Abraham's Grace Covenant he 17 and Abraham never received this promise while he was in circumcision didn't receive it under the law now we know Abraham was way before the law so what's brother talking about they took circumcision and brought it under the law and they thought it was a thing that cleansed them I've always believed that that those Israelites believed in serpent seed the perversion of the wound and they thought circumcision cleansed it come on while he was in circumcision under the law but when he was under grace before circumcision was ever issued therefore it's not nothing that we could do to Merit it's God's grace that gives it to us by faith Abraham believ God and it was imputed to him for righteousness the law is what man wanted not what God wanted the law was never the perfect will of God now I just said some things that a lot of people wouldn't dare to say because they're afraid to run into all words like that the law was never the will of God I'm trying to show you that they chose it that's why they said give us something to do it was never the will of God look at the next one look at number 17 does God ever change his mind about his word preaching 65418 even paragraph 96 God permitted Israel to take a law in the 19th chap Exodus 19th Chapter when Grace had already give them a prophet Pillar of Fire sacrificed lamb a delivering power but they cried out for a law now watch it wasn't God's will but it was injected because man wanted it and he was cursed by the very law that he wanted but you see we got to prove that point we've got to get enough thought some way to prove that Israel was actually wanting I said that take too long they chose law it was not God's will you said well I thought I thought it was God's will to give him the law I thought see you talk to a denominational person tell them it wasn't the will of God you going to get laughed out of the country but they'll tell you that that was God perfect God giving them the law you know there's a Doctrine back there I ran into it before I run into this message you know there was a Doctrine back there that says in I forgot what church it was in but said that that the soul never come into existence until the law was given man was only body and spirit until the law came when the law came gave him a soul CU a soul is a I mean gave gave him a the law gave him a soul because the law is a knowledge of right and wrong he well I never heard that I just wonder how many times we sat and listen to a lot of things come on folks wake up when you're listening I mean are you going to church just to sit there I've been to church your soul is dependent upon what you're hearing you better be concerned about what you're hearing and you better be checking out what you hear that brother just so good he's just so wonderful I feel so good when he's preaching but brother Dale he just Wy Wy W yeah it's like I asked a lady one time I said what does your pastor preach on the soul she said I went there about four or five years I don't know he never did tell me I well four five years at least you already got around to it by then somewhere but you see church we can make it look so beautiful the soul never came into existence till the law came because the law brought a knowledge of sin I'm quoting scripture the law brought a knowledge of sin made you come into a soul I told a person after this little meeting was over that day I said well according to the Bible Adam was made a living soul and I said no no more you know leave it alone but it didn't change him you see Church nobody's going to get changed with anything new birth or marriage and divorce or invisible Union unless it's revealed that's right you remember when we went over and over and over on the marriage and divorce that brother brand said it's got to be revealed if it's not revealed it's not far you but Brother D we never under the law when Mama told you don't go in the dark room or outside when it's dark cuz there booger Bears out there that put a law in Motion in you and made you scared of the dark right you got old enough to realize ain't no booger bear but you never got over Mama telling you to not go out in the dark a law see what it is to be law folks we'll find out Paul said to thing the law that he thought was life he said it was death killing him as I was say while ago about the karate that where that you get to the place that you don't allow that to control you when somebody gets to the Bas in this word that this the laws and the things that we've been taught and all the baby ideas and the sugar te and the things that's been taught to us by mankind somebody's going to get to a place that all that can be dead and they can walk out that's what I told them when I left the Baptist Church I went to church in this message and I told him I said God got me out of the Baptist now I want to bapst out of me amen but Brother D that's a good brother I remember a man one time that said all us on God's side step over here and there was 250 priests was cold off the altar stood back off her way from Moses and the Earth just swallowed him up read your Bible the next day they came to Moses and they said you've killed the people of God he ought to walk back and said make another hole but by then Grace had taken over a little bit in Moses see there was Grace during the time of the law we'll get to it Sunday they ain't one dble Grace in the law no read it that's right the letter of dos and don'ts cannot bring you to Salvation cannot so when Israel said whatever you say Lord will do what do you think they ought to said it it just don't sound like that they were choosing it sound like God said here it it I'm going to give it to you and that's what he was doing he was giving it to him because that's what they wanted but remember this quote the prophet of God said God will take a permissive will and make it work for his perfect will that's right amen you that brother around and said taking people by the hand and doing the things like that was a permissive will of God he said I'll show you one day that that was not right to do that God took that and brought the people to a perfect word what about it let's stand law or Grace amen which are we ruled by but Brother D I'm just afraid that I might get caught with a bunch of Rules and Things no don't worry about it you already caught by right that's your natural nature and I'm going to make a statement the new birth don't cleanse a lot of them denominational ideas right you want to quote brother brandham said we're free from sin and bound by our Creeds no the new birth it's everything went I just I can show you where the Prophet said amen but show me the rest he said he said you women don't you think because you got long hair and long dresses that means you're saved right that's The Book of Rules the rule says don't do do don't do do don't cut your heart don't do this don't that's rules Grace is a person amen one of these days you'll realize what I mean by that Grace is a person it's the person in Jesus Christ God made manifest to you by Revel Grace what do we need what we got number two in the red book number two in the red book anybody have a name I Journey Through the land singing as I go pointing to calary from the Crimson FL just keep breing invisible I just read it read it again I read it three times read it again you want to know what the new birth is bring the future home the streets of Glory my last then we'll get down to it to see what the real meaning of all of it is like the prophet said the night when them Ten Commandments came he said the seals came downan soul I just can't see how you put the seal the 10 commandments together it ain't been revealed to you the reason You Came Forever Joshua was there on the streets of Glory
