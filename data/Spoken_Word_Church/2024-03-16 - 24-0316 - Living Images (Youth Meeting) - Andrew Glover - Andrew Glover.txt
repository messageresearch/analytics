Book of Genesis the first chapter and um of course it is honored to be here with my wife and our little boy Malachi I think they've stepped out and amen we appreciate them for making the trip with us and Amen brother Nate and sister Caitlyn for coming over from North Carolina and being here in little Charlie and amen it's just a special time to get together with Believers amen amen the Book of Genesis the first chapter we want to look here in the 26th verse amen and just before we read the word let's just bow our hearts together and let's invite him to come and speak to us Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon we are very well aware that we're not here by ourselves but Lord there's a supernatural host in this building and Lord your word is said wherever two or three would Gather in Your Name Lord you made us a promise that you would come and you would be in the midst of your people now Lord as I look around this morning there's more than two or three here but Lord there's a houseful of people Lord Believers of your word that have come to receive something from you now father I Surrender myself to you may you take control of me Father may you move me out of the way Lord Lord that the people would not see me they would not hear me but Lord they would see you and hear you oh god father I pray that as your word Goes Forth May the chains of the enemy be broken Lord May the strongholds of the enemy be torn apart oh God lord May the Sons and Daughters of God receive the word of Liberation and may they step from the bondage of unbelief and confusion oh God and to the Glorious Liberty of your word now father I pray you would send healing into sick bodies may you send salvation into lost souls oh God lord we turn our attention to you now father have your way among us and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the Book of Genesis the first chapter and in the 26th verse the Bible said God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image somebody say his own image own in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so it wasn't male only or female only but both male and female and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth now watch this and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now in the book of Philippians the 2 chapter I want to read one verse there with you Philippians chapter 2 and verse number five uh brother if you could give me just a little bit more in my ear I'd appreciate it amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 amen that's that's great amen Philippians 2 and 5 I know it's a very familiar reading to us uh speaking here of our Lord Jesus the Bible says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness or we could say image the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus somebody say Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the father amen we ask Lord this this afternoon to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments this afternoon speak you here and if I title this I want to talk to you for a few moments on living images amen living images I I believe today that we have gathered here amen and I want to say this I believe that the most solemn or the most powerful confession that you as an individual could make amen is that you are a Christian amen not that you are a a scholar or you are a sport star or you're something in the world but you are a Christian now when I say that I want to say this that Christians amen they must have real confidential Faith the prophet of God said in the images of Christ he said the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on and I believe that before anybody can ever move or have real confidential Faith it's first they have to know where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand so if you're going to make the solemn confession of being a Christian then you're going to have to know how to stand how to make the stand now he said I believe that's essential amen for you cannot just headlong plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you're plunging you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position then it gives a constant satisfaction if our faith is set in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction now I believe that we were made or we were created Amen in the image of God I believe that the image of God Amen is the Divine image in Genesis 5:1 the Bible said that this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him now we can trans we can transfer that word likeness to image and that word is a figure or it is an image of things amen the Heavenly things used of the moral likeness of renewed men to God it is the image of the Son of God into which true Christians are are transformed so in other words you have an image amen but then there's something happens to transform you amen from what you are into that image now we all know that we were born in sin shape in iniquity come in the world speaking lies right so we were born in the image of sin we were born in the image of the nature of the enemy but God by his transforming power amen has transformed us that we would be a reflection amen or a likeness or a figure or an image amen of the Son of God now I believe this I believe that as Christians amen that we are to manifest the life of Jesus Christ amen in all ways I don't believe we're just to manifest him in church or manifest him in in in just one area amen but I believe we are to manifest him in every area in all the ways of our life now amen I'll say it to you like this when you study the Bible you will see amen that the word Christian or Christians amen is only used about two or three times in the Bible in the book of Acts 11 book of Acts 11 2 verse 26 and when he speaking of Barnabas had found him he brought him under Antioch and it came to pass amen that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people amen and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch in Acts 26:28 then AG grippa said unto Paul amen almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian 1 Peter 4:16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf amen so now we see amen that just being a Christian is also going to come with suffering amen are we all on the same page if you're going to be a Christian amen there's going to be an element of suffering now I'll sit to you like this Christian amen means to be a follower of Christ it means to be Christlike amen or like Christ now I'll say this we have so many explanations and definitions of what a Christian is today amen we have around 900 different denominations and each one of those are specifically defining amen what they think a Christian is or what a Christian should be or what a Christian could do but I'll say this thank God for the message of the hour amen that has restored a true Bible definition amen of what a Christian is brother said therefore so many times we hear this expression oh what is a Christian well some people amen limit it to joining a church church Someone said well amen a Christian is a church member someone who takes up their affiliation with a church he said I believe that all Christians should do that but I don't believe that's Christianity see that's what a Christian does after he becomes a Christian but it doesn't mean that because he does it that he is a Christian then some say no it's going to a church and serving a declaration of Creeds and being loyal to those amen things in which the church teaches he said then there are others that say that perhaps packet a little something on them a little cross or something amen that is a sign of a Christian he said there's others perhaps maybe believe if they burn a candle or some kind of a Penance if that's a Christian if they will be merely immersed in water they'll do some sacrifice give some good to the church help the neighbor buy some coal for the Widow some shoes for the orphan that's the act that a Christian should do amen but that still doesn't make you a Christian he said then some says if you pack an image of Christ in your car or on your wall that that is a sign of a Christian well then things are all all right but I don't believe packing an image makes you a Christian now thank God for a prophet that said I do not believe packing an image makes you a Christian he said I believe that being an image of a of Christ makes you a Christian being a image of Christ is what makes you a Christian it's not what we do outwardly amen it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are so it's not what we pack on the outside or what we what we do on the outside that makes us a Christian amen but it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and members of his body amen we should be images like him amen then our lives should reflect the image of Christ amen notice it's not our joining church or our packing a crucifix or our emotion but it should be in the living presence of the Living God that is reflected through our life amen listen we can shout every day and still not be a Christian we can put pictures on our wall and still not be a Christian but when the power of God drops in the soul of an individual and changes them amen not just for time but for eternity amen that is what makes him a Christian amen I believe it amen I believe it I believe that it's Jesus on the inside amen working on the outside amen I believe that's what's making the difference amen is Jesus on the inside amen working on the outside you know what the prophet of God says he says you're not a Christian by your desire he said you are a Christian by God's desire so you know what that tells me is we were elected to be Christians we didn't choose to be a Christian we didn't join a church to become a Christian but we were elected by God from before the foundation of the world to be a Christian it's in the Bible John 665 he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father speaking on David the great warrior he said he knowed where he was standing he was a man of Faith he believed God God was in him he knew he was anointed and you know the same thing if you're Christians amen if God hadn't elected you to be a Christian then you would not be a Christian see it's God's choice not yours no man seeks God Amen at any time you haven't sought God but God has sought you it wasn't you calling for God Amen it was God calling for you then when God called you it showed he elected you you accepted the call it was justification then you gave your heart to Christ and was filled with the Holy Spirit and now you're positionally placed in the body of Christ now if it made you quit your old mean habits and act like a Christian ought to it'll do that for you it'll heal your body amen because it is a promise that a Christian is not somebody amen that just shows up when they want to amen a Christian is not somebody that just believes amen when it is convenient to believe amen but a Christian is a son or daughter of God that was chosen by God by the election of God and positionally placed in the body of God Amen and the spirit on the inside of them amen is a direct reflection amen of what God was in Jesus is what he is in this bride all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into you I'm just going to preach here for a moment I believe amen that outside of the message of the hour there's no way to be a real Christian now there's a lot of claim in the denominational Christians but if you're going to be a real Christian you're going to have to come in line with the word of the hour and the age you're living in but said in the Rapture he said if your life did not always was an attribute in God Amen then you are just a mimic of Christianity can I ask you something amen why would we want to Rob the Church of the beautiful teachings of predestination and the election of God and the forn knowledge of God Amen when a prophet said without that amen you're just a mimic of Christianity he said there'll be millions and billions of them amen they'll just be mimics of Christianity listen without a seed in your soul amen from before the foundation of the world you will stand in this age as a mimic of the word as a mimic of God but if there is a seed Gene of God on the inside of your soul was placed there by God Amen then when the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost begins to Quicken that seed it will move you from just being a church member into being a li living image of the Lord Jesus Christ now without that you'll just be a mimic of Christianity in Mark 77 Jesus said how be it in vain do they worship me what are they doing teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men Jeremiah 17:10 he said I the Lord search the heart I tribe the Reigns even to give every man according to his own ways according to the fruit of his doings now brother picks this up in the church age book and says now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are of the false Vine he said the truth of the matter is they are Christians but they're not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh see they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7:7 but in indeed they are Christians for what else could they be amen as a muhammadan is a muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches now in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God he is born of a virgin he was crucified died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind in fact in the layout of age there will be those who call themselves Christians but because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right Amen to deny his deity that is a mimic of Christianity they subscribed to the fact he was born of a virgin he lived a 33 and a half years he hung on the cross he died he was buried he rose again amen but they deny the deity of the return of the power of the Resurrection he said see a Christian Scientist has already done that as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believer is one who has been baptized in the body of Christ and is a member of him amen but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and they are not to be approved that is the command of God for their day for binding and burning is coming but it is not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising on the other hand he is rebuking he has told what is right with a True Believer now he warns the false Vine must do to stand Justified before the Lord amen let me say this we were all born Amen in sin shape and iniquity and come in the world speaking lies amen I'll say this I believe that there is a new birth that has been given by the grace of God Amen to break the birth of your Earthly father and mother amen the cursing and the seed jeans all those things that gathered into your life amen I believe there is a new birth according to John 3 amen and the only the ones who will come to that amen are the elected he said Marvel not that I said to thee ye must be born again picks this up in the church age book and says now then here we are coming to a conclusion amen as the Eternal lust God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn somebody say our turn Amen in our turn amen became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts are now made manifest in flesh are the sons of God Amen even as we are so called so can I say this Paul had his turn and Peter had his turn Amen brother brandham had his turn amen but Young people this is your turn Amen to manifest God Amen in your age by the promise of the seed that was deposited in your soul from before the foundation of the world I love how the prophet says this aen it it breaks a lot of confusion just to say what he said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn amen for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed amen is the reason we could be quickened amen because in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now I'll say this when Christ comes All Things become new that's why it's called the New Birth when Christ comes All Things become new see then what happens is is the image of Christ amen is birthed from the inside Amen to the outside see we're not cleaning a fish and then catching it but we catch a fish and then we clean it are you hearing me so it's not about cleaning up the outside and leaving the inside filthy but if you get the inside cleaned up by the new birth amen what is on the inside will move to the outside amen and will separate you from a mimic of Christianity and make you a real Christian in 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul said If any man be in Christ amen he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new brother said this cleans you inside and outside see it makes you a new creature yeah in Christ Jesus amen as the Greek puts it a new creation Now can I say this to you amen you are not an old creation amen patched up you are a new creation by the life of Jesus Christ coming on the inside of you say when the church lays dead for so long when your church don't have a Revival when the pastor just stands with a cold cut slide sermon when somebody says amen and everybody wants the deacons to take him out of the building when you get a Church like that it will lay dormant when you get a church like that it will lay dormant he said then oh let God send his man in their wants and watch what will take place amen the Revival fires will come back on the altar again people will be crying out for Mercy to their souls lives will be straightened up healings will take place in the church signs and wonders will begin to happen for where the Creator God is amen New Creation comes New Life comes New Hope comes every anything comes when Jesus comes always been so when Jesus comes he brings new life when Jesus comes he brings New Hope when Jesus comes he brings new faith when Jesus comes he brings the supernatural when Jesus comes he brings the fire amen back on the altar amen as a place of cleansing I'll say this the new birth is more than a Doctrine the new birth is more than an idea amen but the new birth amen is a paradox amen where God take makes you yourself and changes you from death into life and out of your innermost being is a new creation in Christ Jesus it is a paradox now God Amen prepares his servants by fire you look in the Bible in Isaiah 6 when you get time read it sometime you will see that the Bible says amen that Isaiah amen said that a Col of fire amen touch the prophet I want you to catch something here amen what changed him from a man that was undone and of unclean lips to a prepared servant with a commission saying amen here am I Lord send me amen it wasn't intellectualism it wasn't a bunch of teachings and a bunch of books and a bunch of Creeds and a bunch of declarate come on Church what changed Isaiah from being an undone man with unclean lips was when the fire of God come back on the Altar and touched his lips amen now let me say this I believe that our God according to Hebrews 12 amen is a consuming fire and I tell you what the church needs amen it's the fire of God to come back in the church now come on I might as well preach I'm here we're trying to fix all kinds of situations amen but let the fire come one time we're trying to cancel this and fix that put this back together amen but let the fire of God come in the church amen well our wayward loved ones come on our loved ones are wward and our babies are growing cold you know why they're growing cold is cuz the fire of God has left the altar amen come on church amen and we're trying to figure out all kinds of program got to preach brother Wade we're trying to figure out all kinds of programs amen we got to join this and go to this seminar and go to this class and then know what we need to do is preach the fire of God until it makes every icicle so uncomfortable that it melts in the presence of the Holy Ghost and the fire of God breaks out in the church again amen I still believe in the fire of God I believe we ought to let the fire of God consume our singing We ought Let the Fire of God consume our musicians we ought to let the fire of God consume the puppy amen how many say Lord open the windows of heaven and let the fire of God consume Spoken Word Church come on church it's the fire of God it's the only thing that'll bring a real change so somebody told me one time said said there was a said there was a guy at his church and said the building called on fire said everybody from the town was running down there and they brother way day was looking at the building and Pastor walking around he seen this one old guy there and he you know the church is burning down you know and he walks by this whole guy and he says hey he said been a long time since I seen you here and that guy looked back at him said yeah been a long time since I seen the church on fire too see what I'm saying is we need the fire of God Amen to cause an attraction in the house of God listen I believe this message will set a church on fire and God will call Eagles from around the world to watch it burn I believe this message is a fire come on Jeremiah said it's a fire amen shut up in my bones and if that fire gets in our young people amen you won't have to worry about pornography you won't have to worry about suicide you won't have to worry about complexes if the fire of God breaks out in the church again it'll burn every devil out come the fire of God will burn out Hollywood it'll burn out social media addictions come on Church it'll burn out all kinds of confusions how long you let the firey God break out of a burnout worldly boyfriend relationships and early girlfriend relationships you say well preacher you're oldfashioned I am oldfashioned cuz I still believe in the Holy Ghost and Fire having the ability to clean up a Christian and make a real Christian out of him brother said he's Justified a man Sanctified him and sent the Holy Ghost in fire amen and burnt the sin out of him amen and dwelt in him himself Amen brother I hate to ask this but if it' be possible to turn that compressor off or something it's it's compressing everything in my ear he does the Earth he's going to use in a Plan of Redemption the same way now watch this the Earth repented and was baptized in Water by Noah then Jesus come and Sanctified it by the dripping his blood upon it and claimed it then the new Earth is to come is to have a holy fire baptism to clean out oh that's that's wonderful where are we going to buy you a steak dinner amen amen going to clean out amen now watch this every devil amen the fire of God is going to clean out every devil every germ every sickness everything there is and make it a new amen amen the fire of God is going to burn out every devil come on church if the fire of God can fall upon this Earth and burn out every devil every jur every sickness Hallelujah and make it a new to where John said I saw a new heavens and a new Earth he said then you become a new person see not just an old one passed up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit God takes the old man and burns him completely out and with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen comes himself and sends down your representation no man can come to me except my father draw him and all the father has given me amen will come to me let me say this when the fire of God comes it'll burn out every devil it'll burn out every sickness it'll burn out every germ it'll burn out every unel come on I believe if the fire of God breaks out in the church it'll burn out the world it'll burn out Leota I say oh God set our young people on fire amen set our preachers on fire come amen take the braks off the atmosphere and let the fire of God come in the church well I'm here I might as well preach are you hearing me the fire of God will fix it amen now you say brother Andrew we getting way out there well I'll say this a real Christian is Christ in you and you in Christ a real Christian is Christ in you and you in Christ Colossians 1: 126 even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to the Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory now you all know brother preaches a very beautiful message and calls it Christ amen the mystery of God revealed amen now watch this he says that it'll be revealed in a threefold purpose right amen the first fold will be that he reveals himself amen the second fold will be that he will take preeminence of his body amen by the revelation of himself amen now the third fold is he will lead his bride that he has preeminence in Back to the Garden of e and condition amen by the revelation of himself said secondly the Manifest Christ in you the hope of glory now do you see why amen that he renovates You by fire it's because justification made way for sanctification which made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fiery baptism but that made way for the person amen of the word himself Amen to step into you listen friends he didn't put a book in you he didn't put a Doctrine in you amen but he deposited the Perfection of the word on the inside of your soul making you a Living Image amen hallelujah hallelujah amen the great manifested God in Christ is now Christ manifested in you listen what was once God's Great secret mystery Secret in his mind amen is now amen put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ now what was once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest can I say this what was once in God 's mind is now in God's Church what was once in God's mind I'm now looking at the image of what was in his mind now reflected in his church Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see then what is the new birth you say well brother BR what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see not you joined the church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised live by code of rules no but Christ the Bible he is the word was revealed to you now what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word now watch when the word is revealed amen it expresses itself so when the word is revealed amen the revealed word becomes an expression of God and the prophet said Christ God died in flesh in order order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like he did for intellectual conceptions of man if a man says he's born again and tries to place these promises of Christ in the last days to some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by Satan let me say this I believe in mark I believe that there will be a Mark 16 church that will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe there will be a Mark 16 church amen they will not try to psychology Devils out they will cast them Devils out I believe there will be a church that will March in the anointing and the same inspiration amen that Jesus breathed out upon the church when he said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel amen and baptize in my name repentance of sins come on church amen and the sick will be healed the dead will be raised demons will be cast out I believe that you are the reflection of that scripture in flesh in this generation I believe it amen I don't believe I'm just reading Mark 16 I believe you are the living image of Mark 16 I don't believe I'm just reading acts two I believe somebody has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they are the Living Image come on sometime or another it's got to get off of letter form and get in the flesh form come on sometime or another it's got to be more than Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon and Wednesday night in a in a youth camp somewhere somewhere or another you got to become amen the transformed son or daughter of God manifesting God in the power of His word in the age you're living in amen I believe it I don't believe it's a possibility I believe it's a promise I don't believe it's they might they perhaps they shall amen amen can I say it the way brother said it they will amen well Glory they not might they not perhaps they will see heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't now in Acts 24:14 I love the Bible it says this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy amen so worship I the god of my fathers I want you to catch this here believing all things yeah that's right as they call this way the way of heresy but it's the way that I worship the god of my fathers amen now watch this believe in all things which are written in the law and in the prophets now brother Bob you've been around long enough to know am mean you're getting a good hot meat you know and the Holy Ghost gets to move and amen people get to dancing and shout and rejoice and having a good time amen somebody going to stand up and say well glory to God in the way they call heresy is the way we worship the god of our fathers you know and but let me say this that is not just pertaining to an emotional demonstration of worship come onen it's not the way of heresy was not just because somebody got lost in the Holy Ghost and shouted or they got lost in the Holy Ghost and danced but the the way of heresy was that there was some people in there that they didn't believe some things the prophet said they didn't believe a few things the law said but everything that was in the law and everything that was spoken by the prophet amen they stood on it amen come H or high water they stood on it amen because they were Christians they were living images of God and I believe in this generation God is raising up a group of young people that are going to be identified as Heretics but they're not going to back off of this message they're not going to back off of what a prophet T if they got to stand by themselves they're going to stand by themselves because there is a power amen a transforming power Hallelujah and then there's a transforming power in saying what a prophet said people say the people czy listen the reason they say that is because they haven't got the mind of the world anymore they have got the mind of Christ so if you're going to fall in the way of heresy come on now you're going to have to lose the mind of the world and you're going to have to take on the mind of Christ in other words you're going to have to agree with things that your own flesh don't amen that's right you're going to have to agree with a prophet when the world says it's old fashion come on now we might as well preach we here well well brother Andrew I agree with but I don't go along with that part about wearing shorts you know that was his opinion well you're not in the way of heresy then that's right that's right Welly to God preacher you're doing good well brother Andrew we we believe brother brand but that part about televisions you know I mean that was back in the 50s and and you know what was on there then you know I love Lucian well dear God what's on there now right brother so either you're going to stand with the word and manifest the image of God or you're going to back off somewhere and say well we'll take the mind of the world Listen amen amen a double minded mind a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so if you got the mind of the world on this subject and the mind of Christ on that one you are a double-minded individual but either you're going to have all the mind of the world or all the mind of Christ but I believe there's some real Christians here and are going to die to the things of Leia they're going to die to the traditions of this world and they're going to say call me crazy call me a Holy Roller call me oldfashioned but I'm going to stand with a Vindicated word of God in the age I'm living in you got the mind of the world or the mind of Christ see Christ in you the hope of glory can I say this we are transformed into the image of God Amen according to Romans 12 by the renewing of our mind now I'll say this to you there's two mind Minds in the world today there's the mind of Christ somebody say the mind of Christ and the mind of the world says in Witnesses 1954 cause remember you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time my goodness you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time amen you have to get out of your way way to let God have his way that's the only way you're ever going to do anything is you got to get away from your own thoughts I'm preaching to you if you're going to be a real Christian you got to get away from your own thoughts your own reason see don't try to reason just believe amen listen if you're going to be a mimic of Christianity then take the mind of the world on this and the mind of Christ on that and the reason on this and you're but but if you're going to be a real living image of Christ amen crucify the mind of the world and let the mind of Christ drop into you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll say this to you the mind of the world is carnal amen the mind of the world is carnal but the mind of Christ is spiritual am now Romans 8:6 says to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind amen is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God Amen neither indeed can be you all heard the saying amen so Heavenly minded no earthly good you've heard that saying but you know I've actually come to realize more and more that that's more than just something to joke to say that that's more than just a little a little uh negative something to put on somebody amen if you're becoming more Heavenly minded that you're no earthly good amen you're becoming in a blessed position right amen amen because the way this world is going is crazy come on church we we we got B boys going in girls' bathrooms thinking they girls we got kids going to school thinking their cats well we might as well preach amen we got we got boys marrying boys and girls becoming boys and amen wake up one day they feel like a boy wake up the next day they feel like a girl wake up the next day they feel like a dog go to school they feel like a cat come home they feel like a are you hearing me we don't no longer say he or she we say they or them or well we might as well preach amen the world has lost their mind because the lid has come off of hell and demon powers have invaded this generation but thank God in the last days there would be a restoration of the faith of God that would turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers and somebody would rise up and say I'm not going that way and I'm not going that way and I'm not going that way I'm going the way of the word I'm going the way of the truth the life and that way see but you got to lose the carnal mind and take on the spiritual mind amen yes yes Romans 8:7 because the carnal mind is enmity against God that word enmity is the state or feeling of being actively opposed or hostile to someone or something another word for enmity is hatred which is used in the book of Galatians remember said look how true the devil was he fooled every priest that come on the earth he sure did he's still doing it see he was smart but he'd come up against a match one day who defeated him yes and the only thing we have to do is just lay against him he's already defeated him but it is from Ben speaking of wisdom this wisdom that man can accumulate to prove and show all these things why a man should do this and man should do that is contrary and enmity the carnal mind to God the scripture said so right no matter how smart they can twist it around I want somebody to show me where God ever had an organization or ever commanded one but what condemns it here in the Bible no matter how smart they can try to be it's contrary how the wisdom can it stand and out argue to you and make you feel little by little by telling you about it but see it's contrary to the scriptures now brother BR preaches a beautiful sermon I encourage you Amen to listen to it when you get time he calls it the images of Christ and he takes it he actually takes his uh his text from the B from The Book of John 13 and he reads it from where we read on foot Washing Service right he said now look know ye not what I've done unto you now wash this their feet he taken his garments was set down against them know you not what I've done to you verse 13 you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet now do you all remember amen how the Bible said that when he said that Peter said Lord we ain't going that way you know what happened was was Peter Still had amen a carnal view of what Jesus was saying am but Jesus said amen if your lord Master have washed your feet also wash one anothers for I've given you an example that you should do as I've done unto you verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things amen happy if you do themen now that word example means a pattern it is a sign it is suggestive of anything amen it is a copy for imitation of the thing to be imitated or of the thing to be shunned so when something is set as an example it's either to be copied Amen to be imitated to be a pre to be a to be a rep uh A reproduction of it rather or it's to be shunned now let me say this the pro God said our text tonight reflects what he was amen that's what makes him great in my estimation yet being the very God of Eternity the very God that created the heavens and the earth when he came here he took the lowest position the most dis desirable job that anybody could have that was a footwash flunky of all the Pains of the early days in the in the Oriental world the footwash funky amen was the lowest paid man of all for in these days animals walked on the highways had little byways that went by along the road amen it stunk all along the road where the animals were that dust f up got on their legs and in their feet and such an awful stink as there was and as soon as someone come to visit another he could not come in that manner he smelled bad from the stink of the Rob and the dust like around the liary stable so the first thing he did was he had a little reception booth and the lowest paid man on the place just like some slav stayed back in there to wash the feet of this guest that was coming and give him another pair of shoes to put on little sandals and slip on him when he was anointed now when the O could go to the great of all of his friend CU he'd fell out of place going in full going in so full the stink of the roads and sweaty and so forth and the footwash Funky was paid l less than any man that there was now now you got a a picture of the footwash and the god of Heaven humbled himself the greatest there was became the lowest there was he said now what a difference of the socalled reflecting Christian today what a difference see why the so-called Christian today wants to be served so the the the so-called Christian wants to be served oh he began to think that's he somebody what difference was it from what was reflecting him see he never come to be ministered to but he come to minister he said let he that's the greatest among you be the servant of them all and we see today our Modern Trend of Christianity is is I'm somebody and you're nothing it's wrong it should not be that way we are trying to reflect Christianity in the wrong way God doesn't want us to do it that way we sing the song to be like Jesus but when it comes to Humble our pride and to get down like he did then we draw a line and in doing so man has formed denominations that they can separate themselves seemingly not having the spirit as the scripture says they separate themselves we belong to this church it's a bigger church or better church denomination greater that doesn't act like Jesus that doesn't reflect his love and his personality he came to the lowest amen are you hearing me he came to the lowest to the street harlet to the beggar to the bum and got right down in the dust with him that's the Christian Life That's the way it should be to reflect him in that way so a real Christian has been born again by the water the blood and the spirit amen now listen they didn't try to come to God on their own terms but they laid aside their terms they laid aside the mind of the world and took on the mind of Christ and said if it's snotting at an altar that's what I'll go if it's crying out at an altar that's what I'll do come on we might as well preach we here I think we got a little too dignified and sophisticated Amen in our way we're bringing people to God I might as well preach amen we made this way and that way listen we used to get up knock the Baptist for sh for for shaking hands and signing cards amen but let's just preach about our ranks amen do you believe God sent a prophet what church do you go to do you accept this Doctrine amen we ain't got no business knocking the Baptist when we've diluted the way that a man can come to God and be changed by the fire of the Holy Ghost you know what we need to do we lay aside some of our self starchiness amen that's right amen well we don't do it like that we don't sing like that we don't shout like that amen ain't our culture we get a new culture am come on have we got so dignified that we can't even let go on the Holy Ghost no more have we got so starchy amen that somebody screams out oh they're Pentecostal or they're emotional no amen it's somebody who's humbled themselves to the power of the Holy Ghost listen I'm not here to be a reflection for intellectualism I'm not here to be a reflection for the things of Le out of seea my purpose on this Earth your purpose on this Earth is to be a channel that God can reflect himself through not as a god of wood not as a god of stone but as a living God a Living Image our God is not dead he's alive and well man he humbled himself now y y'all know I think it's amazing brother said the position they give the footwash flunky was a slave yeah right right the position they put the footwash funky in was considered a slave and Jesus took that position yenen come on yeah yes and the Bible also says there was little woman that come in and she had an alabaster box and she found her way over to where Jesus was and she knelt down and washed his oh God washed his feet with her tears amen and dried them with her hair are you hearing me she was a slave to the sin of the world she was a slave to perversion but there was a man there that could take her sin and give her his righteousness what did he do how did he do that he didn't do that as one being served he did that as a servant who being in the form of God thought it not Roby to be equal with God but made himself of no reput ation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men look at this word servant it is one who gives himself up to another's will amen yes amen so a real Christian oh God is someone who gives thems up to another's will those whose service is used by Christ in extending and advancing his cause among men listen devoted to another to the disregard of One's Own interest as a servant yes yes amen that's it so if you're going to be a real Christian you're going to have to give yourself up to another's will right amen amen that's right are you with me and you're going to have to disregard your own interest as a servant now let me say what a prophet said today they try to bypass the new birth because the new birth is a mess y that's right that's right but it produces life yeah amen right come on do we want a mess or do we want life right well we want the mess that produces life what kind of life he says servant life yeah right yes so the son of man didn't come to be ministered to but he came to minister to said what is a birth if a birth happens on a straw tick or it happens on the floor in a hospital that rooms are decorated pink silk it's a mess any way you take it and so is the new birth it's a mess but it produces life what kind of life servant life to humble yourself to deny yourself that's the kind of Life Jesus said this is my commandment that you love one another as I've loved you he said these things I command you that you love one another now watch what a prophet says oh they say but I seen them crying and boohoo around the Altar and carrying on sure they're being born it's a mess I don't care where you go you might get your face full of tears and your eyes red and your hands raw from beating on the altar but it is a birth yes amen amen it's a birth see it does something to you God have mercy it does something to you it makes you a servant are you ready for this it takes the starch out of you well glory to God I might as well preach on that point cuz I felt it amen I think it's time to get the starch out you know what starch is amen you put starching something when you want to hold in a specific position for a very long time and you know what I think we've done I think we've starched up our praise long enough I think we've starched up our worship long enough I think it's time to get back at the altar and let the fire of God melt out all the starch until there's a boohoo amen well I feel like praising him are you hearing me let all the starch go and let some flexibility come in there H Longoria told me one time he said he said I used to hate going to church on Sunday mornings as a kid he said cuz Mama put us in them starched white shirts you know he said them collars were so stiff and them sleeves were so stiff he said you couldn't even hardly move it rubbed your neck the wrong way and said your arm hurt y'all know what I'm talking about and and and you know why that somebody shou and gets on your nerves is because you got too much starch you know why somebody saying amen gets on your nerves is you got too much starch come on now are you hearing me you know why somebody raising their hand or clapping or enjoying themselves in the house of God gets on it's a it's a dangerous point to push a it's because you got too much star but if you get rid of that starch and let the fire of God come back in and make a servant out of you come on make a serving out of you we might as well preach amen people get so starch they can't even shake hands with people brother well brother Andrew so and so did me wrong 20 years ago they did you wrong and for 20 years you've been keeping starch in that Grudge you know oh yeah well so and so looked at me wrong and that kid did me right amen and for all

have a bad day and still worship God Amen they need to know what it's like Amen to know somebody got somebody against somebody amen but they can let it go underneath the blood of Jesus Christ and worship god oh that Devil's pushing but I'll push back he got the wrong guye get rid of the starch and get some flexibility y'all know talked about them trees he said that wind come down through there he said they just moan and groan and the days of Miracles has passed and God don't do that no more we don't act like that in our church and uhhuh see young people are going to enjoy themselves somewhere or another amen they're going to enjoy themselves somewhere or another it's either going to be in the house of God or it's The Honky Tonk brother that's right buddy amen it's either going to be in the fellowship of Believers or with worldly people at the bowling alley amen come on church so either we get the startch out come on and create an atmosphere where an eagle can be born or we stay all starched up now you know what happens oh I'm getting in trouble sh we you know what happens don't you is we get so proud of our starch 20 years down the road brother Tim young people's walking out and we're saying well dear God I don't know what happened there well I sure hate to see him let's have a prayer meeting you know oh yeah right we'll get the star out amen yes it makes you a servant it takes the stars out of you it makes an image molding New Life new may be all messed up when you get up but you're born again no matter where you are it makes a new life it brings a new image life it makes a serving out of you you want to serve them Jesus wanted us to serve one another love one another as we serve one another listen Church the example image of the son of man was to service Amen to be a service to the need of the people he came as a servant he came not to be minister to but to minister now watch according to Luke 17:30 we are Liv living in the dispensation of the revealing right of the son of man oh won't it be a wonderful on that day he says aren't you happy to be C to be living in the day to see the son of man revealing himself to his church in the day when the son of man is revealed what does he do reveals himself in Mercy first then the next time he reveals himself in judgment to condemn those who burn Mercy now it's time I'm coming now here I'm coming to you now what does he reveal himself in Mercy saving your soul and giving you of his life giving you Joy instead of sadness amen can we quit being sad in church come on I I preach people all the time sit there and look like their mother-in-law just moved in yeah come on Amen they're all wed up tied up you ain't got to ask them if they're doing okay but their Fai tells us amen but can we not enjoy church again can we not get some Joy back in the house of God where we can enjoy the power of God we can enjoy the singing we can enjoy the anointing and if somebody does get free enough to shout a little bit we can let them enjoy their blessing come on the son of man didn't come to starch up the church he come to take out the starch he come to take away the sadness and they give us joy in the stead of sadness to give us faith in the stead of sickness to give us healing in the stead of sickness faith in the stead of fear revealing himself to you in Mercy sir amen amen there ought to be some Joy in the house of God that's right amen now you know what H oh God you know what happens don't you is people get little ideas and opinions about things oh yes well I don't like the song the young people singing that song's too new it's too modern it's too uh it's too up to dat okay well I've been in meetings brother Wade and we sang songs Luther didn't know yeah right and it didn't change the atmosphere one day that's right amen amen true brother same here getting quiet amen so when a young person does get some Liberty to do something for god well that's not that that did you hear that beat did you hear the words in that song do you know who sung that song first yeah yeah do you know Elvis sang Only Believe come but we didn't put it out no right come on church amen we got to get flexible again amen we're not here to be served we're here to serve and sometimes in order to serve God we got to lay aside the way we like things the way they're done and embrace the change come on we got to embrace change sometime amen the son of man is not here to give more starts he's here to give Liberty see now watch this the secret of the power of Jesus Christ was he was able to Humble himself he was able to Humble himself now come on don't ever get to a place you can't humble yourself the son of man in this generation I'm I'm I'm turn I'm turning a corner now the son of man in this generation through a son of man came and humbled himself now watch what he done he went to places where people were trapped right right that's amen the son of man Jesus Christ veiled himself in a son of man Malachi 4 amen and went to places where Souls were trapped righten when he went there he did not go for them to do him a service he went to do them a service remember said that crowd one time now now I prove it to you said we're walking out of out of an auditorium one night and he said we were all out there and he said the guy that had it before us he said here come his crowd he said they were all high class and well polished Scholars and he said all dressed up real nice he said but then here came my crowd amen they were in straight jackets and Wheelchairs and stretchers now watch out friends them people with that high pollute dude they if that's okay y'all forgive me I'm just a country boy okay amen they went in there one way and they came out the same way they went in but these people in stretchers come on now come on and on Cs and in wheelchairs in terrible conditions they went in one way but because there was a servant of the Lord who had humbled himself to the power of God Amen they come out walking they come out in their right mind they come out rejoicing see he humbled himself to minister them can I say this can I say something to you people say well them people's rich and they're all high class and high flute you know but but do you realize you can be poor as job turkey and still be full of Pride that's right amen Amen brother that's right you can be poor is that a saying down here you can be poor as job's turkey and still be full of Pride want me prove it to you take someone that you think's important invite them over to your old house and and and and to you and you know it's not much it don't look like much but you let somebody important walk in and and and and this what they'll say well you really had to humble yourself to come over here and see my house yeah that's not humility that's Pride amen now well it's here I might as well preach we want to be real Christians we got to surrender we got to surrender our thoughts surrender our ideas Amen brother said Surrender Your Prestige amen that's right sir you know what Prestige is don't you y it's an opinion of oneself yeah oh yeah so so now oh God get trouble sure world day so you let somebody walk in here right now and they get out of a brand new Cadillac they walk in in a $1,000 suit and a $2,000 dress and they come in and sit down we had all we wouldn't all but some some would look around and say prestigious people full of prestige full of prestige they won't get nothing out of this service they won't get nothing out of this service we're too humble for them we're we're too we're too little for them they won't get nothing out of this they're too prestigious and they might get a bigger blessing than you because we equ we we equate Prestige to somebody that has a hyp in but do you realize there are some people sitting right here right now and you you don't have a $50,000 Cadillac or or $1,000 suit or $2,000 dress but you're full of prestige and you know what your prestige is it's the opinion of yourself and the opinion of yourself is I'm not good enough I'll never be anything I'm overlooked in the church God don't love me I'm not a part of this family there's no way God could use me and what you're doing is you're letting that Prestige Hold You When God wants to bless you listen you say well God couldn't bless them because they got a high opinion of themselves and God can't bless you cuz you got a low opinion of yourself but what if we laid aside all the opinions and welcomed in the transforming power of God and let the Holy Ghost transform the young the Holy Ghost transform the old amen hallelujah amen lay aside The Prestige well I've gone too far is there a desire in your heart to serve God is there a desire in your heart to love God then you haven't gone too far amen well brother Andrew I made this mistake amen quit building your value upon the mistakes you made lay it aside and let the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse you amen amen lay aside that prestigious idea yes sir well brother Andrew if you only knew my background then you you know why God can't bless me listen that's nonsense Amen Let It Go be a real Christian amen now that's right let me say this to you in closing Paul said in Romans 12:3 he said for I say though for I say through the grace given un me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think Amen in other words let me say this don't ever think you would be where you are today without the message of the amen unto you who humbles yourself under the message of the hour will be transformed into the real somebody say the real the real living Living Image IM of Christ amen you will be more than church members right you will be more than a part of the youth group y right you will be more than just singers in the choir or musicians on the platform you will be true spirit filled Christians amen Amen on and you will have the same somebody say the same The Same Spirit that was in Christ Amen brother B said now watch if Christ Still Remains Christ if his spirit is still the holy spirit that was in him be in you it'll make you take that position too right

you get to witnessing to to them and they say well I got this long hair CA Jesus did that makes me a Christian you know and and and you really think well but but what are you trying to get to what what are you what are you trying to satisfy with a thought that I've got long hair like Jesus did when brother B said it's not outwardly it's inwardly right said now that doesn't mean we have to grow a long beard as the artist picture him having and neither doesn't mean we have to grow long hairs artist picture him having or wear Rob as he wore for we're living in another day we don't necessarily have to be that to reflect his physical image but we must somebody say we must in our souls our reflect his Spirit image and his manner of life I do not believe that Christians consist of joining churches or Creeds I believe it's the reflection of Jesus Christ in a human being for we are the members of his body we bear His Image the scripture says amen Exodus 25:31 Thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beat shall the Candlestick be made his shaft his branches his bowls his knops his flowers shall be of the same the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure

guy one time like you brother Andrew we had long hair you know and he was trying to you know push it off and you know Jesus had long hair you know I said okay okay I said if you'll act just like him I said you can have long hair if you act just like him no deviation cuz Jesus acted like Jesus 9% of the time amen I said if you a like him take that Nazarite Vow Have It long as you want to right right but you slip up one time you better get it cut you know because you done fell out but we try to use those images as our brother said as an excuse the Bible says and the song says to be like Jesus to be like like him not not the image of him but to be like him to act like him to be a servant that's where people get things wrong about ministers and all ministers are servants we're we're not supposed to be put up on a pedestal that's we put Jesus Christ up on a pedestal right cuz you know what he gave his life amen so that I can have eternal life that's right now see there's only one guy can do that so that's why we put him am high and lifted up as a I love that song High and lifted up I love it when you when you uh when you lift your hands up that that's that you're lifting that sacrifice up I watched the you know you watch the old movies where you see the the high priest you know they take and let they do a heave offering well that's when they raise it up like this well that's you you you raise that heave offering up and you give it to God and brother Lis is talking about U um you know if you if you come up in a and a cop says say hey man said you're under arrest said surrender well if you do this right here you going to get a Glock in your face cuz he don't know what's behind your back but if you put both hands up there's no way he that you can that you can hurt him because you've surrendered everything you've got we surrender that all we surrender all to him and we give him all and we' given him this day you could be doing a million other things and our brother said you know we the we've got to live in the world yes but we don't have to be over the world that's right he's given us overcoming power he that overcometh will I give all these things amen you say I can't do it nope you're exactly right start right there you can't do it you can't do it but there's a God that can and there's Provisions there's there's there's people that can can preach the word like our brother did for us today that'll open up a window amen so that you can the devil can get out and you can and God can get in that's exactly what we want we want that unclean spirit I I said many times before I hope you're today you're as comfortable as you can be just like a just like sitting at home at my Mom and Daddy's house but I want the devil to be so uncomfortable till he leaves I want him to be uncomfortable I don't want him to be comfortable in this building I want him to be very uncomfortable and he will be when you start praising God and know the god that you're praising that's the whole thing know the god that you're praising when you know the god that you're praising that's the new birth cuz that's the only connection there is cuz your old birth pulled you away from it amen birth connected you right back to where you supposed to been had it not been a fall and that's God that's God that's not that's not another listen we're not another person amen we're God made manifest in another form called a bride we need to we need to realize that we are him thank God for a prophet that could say that she is him amen and mean it CU then we look in the Bible and we see that we're him we're supposed to reflect his image so if you reflect the image that's who you are amen who's our our worst enemy though ourself yes we want preachers to take care of all of our problems we want evangelists to come in and take care of all our problems no you're the problem to begin with so start with yourself we'll help you all we can but you got to want to remember where brother R said about that woman said that devil came back on her brother R why that devil she loved it she loved that devil so he cast it off God got it away from her but she wanted it so much till it came right back in the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry places comes back finds it all clean and if you ain't got that door sealed he's going to come back in and he's going to bring he's going to bring seven more religious Devils right yes and you'll be worse CU you'll sit in a church just like our brother said and you'll think you got all the you've got all the uh I've got the I've got the image on the outside but there's nothing but Dead Man's Bones on the inside let's give our brother a good hand well there are some things that that opened up I've told them last year or so to for us
