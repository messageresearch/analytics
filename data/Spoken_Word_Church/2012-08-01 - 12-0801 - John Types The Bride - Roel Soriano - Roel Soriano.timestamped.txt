[9:03] seated
[9:05] um
[9:06] we'll
[9:07] go to the scripture reading in
[9:08] revelations chapter four the fourth
[9:11] chapter of revelation
[9:14] i trust that tonight something can be
[9:16] said that will bless the heart of the
[9:18] people
[9:22] remember the last time i was here we
[9:24] we had a good time
[9:26] the presence of the lord
[9:28] came and
[9:30] we were all blessed
[9:33] i'm trusting that he will
[9:35] give us a repeat of that
[9:37] night tonight
[9:38] hallelujah
[9:40] i'm going to entitle this
[9:42] short message
[9:44] john types the bride
[9:48] revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[9:52] the bible said
[9:54] after after this i looked and behold
[9:58] a door was opened in heaven
[10:00] and the first voice which i heard was as
[10:04] it were a trumpet
[10:05] talking with me which said
[10:07] come up hither and i will surely
[10:10] the things which must be
[10:12] here after hereafter
[10:14] verse two and immediately
[10:17] i was in the spirit and behold a throne
[10:20] was set in heaven
[10:22] and one sat
[10:24] on the throne
[10:25] these are the words of the lord
[10:27] we'll pray
[10:28] heavenly father
[10:31] we ask that you
[10:33] bless the words that we have just read
[10:35] tonight
[10:36] anointed to our hearts lord jesus
[10:39] as we
[10:40] talk about the meaning of it tonight we
[10:44] bless us
[10:45] and reach down
[10:47] and
[10:48] father
[10:49] meet the need of each and every believer
[10:52] that has come here tonight
[10:54] for
[10:55] we want you to take all the glory and
[10:57] honor out of this service in jesus name
[11:00] amen
[11:02] may be seated
[11:12] in revelation chapter 10
[11:15] verse 11
[11:18] john was given the commission
[11:22] he said to me thou must prophesy again
[11:25] before many peoples and nations and
[11:27] tongues
[11:29] and kings
[11:32] so i got this thought from
[11:35] what the prophet said
[11:38] about
[11:40] john being the type of the rapture
[11:42] church
[11:44] john being the type of the
[11:47] individual believer that has been caught
[11:49] up in the revelation of the word of god
[11:54] praise the lord in the feast of the
[11:57] trumpets
[11:59] um
[12:00] butter banham also said
[12:02] that um
[12:05] the seventh seal
[12:07] which is a very controversial virtual
[12:10] seal
[12:11] i don't know how it is here in in this
[12:13] country but in our country
[12:16] people are fighting over it
[12:19] you know
[12:21] uh some people believe that the seventh
[12:23] seal is open already some people believe
[12:25] that it's not open something yeah some
[12:28] people believe it's partially open
[12:31] well
[12:32] um i know what the prophet said about
[12:34] the seventh seal the seventh seal is
[12:36] said it's revelation 10.
[12:38] hallelujah the seventh seal is
[12:41] revelation 10 hallelujah
[12:44] and so
[12:45] uh
[12:46] if if we can only understand
[12:49] uh the contents of the tenth chapter of
[12:52] revelation
[12:54] as ministered to us by the prophet of
[12:56] malachi 4 then we can see our place
[13:01] because revelations 10
[13:05] is the passing the passing of revelation
[13:10] right right from the mighty angel
[13:13] to the messenger of this day
[13:15] hallelujah to john
[13:18] who types the bride
[13:20] hallelujah so this is all happening in
[13:23] revelation 10
[13:25] i want you to understand that we're now
[13:27] living in the opening of the seventh
[13:29] seal
[13:31] hallelujah
[13:32] this is the half hour silence
[13:35] uh the bible is talking about in
[13:37] revelation chapter eight verse one when
[13:40] the seventh seal was opened there was uh
[13:42] uh uh there was silence
[13:45] for about half an hour in heaven amen
[13:48] hallelujah
[13:49] i want you to understand that we're
[13:51] right here right
[13:53] we're living it
[13:55] revelation 10 hallelujah this is the
[13:58] seventh seal
[14:01] thank you lord
[14:06] when um
[14:09] preached
[14:10] the church ages
[14:12] in 1960 revelation chapter 4
[14:16] he said this
[14:19] and notice john being taking up being
[14:23] being taken up immediately excuse me
[14:29] after the church age
[14:31] what's the type of the raptured church
[14:37] immediately after the church age is over
[14:40] this lay of the sea and church aids then
[14:44] comes then comes the rapture
[14:47] the church goes up like john did into
[14:50] the presence of god
[14:52] hallelujah that's the reason we read in
[14:55] revelations chapter 4
[14:57] verse 1 our scripture reading
[15:01] hallelujah
[15:02] what says
[15:04] after this i look after the church ages
[15:09] then john is caught up
[15:11] into the presence of god
[15:14] hallelujah
[15:19] do you see the type
[15:22] john was caught up in the spirit
[15:27] he saw a door open in heaven
[15:30] and was caught up into this door in
[15:32] heaven
[15:34] and he plainly saw the godhead
[15:37] and god showed him the things that are
[15:40] going to happen in the future
[15:44] john saw the seals unfold
[15:49] john heard the seven thunders
[15:52] he actually he actually heard what they
[15:55] were
[15:57] hallelujah
[15:58] because he was about to write the bible
[16:00] said i was about to write when i heard
[16:02] the seven thunders
[16:04] but then
[16:05] uh the angel forbid him
[16:08] to write to write this but he heard it
[16:13] and then he took he took the book from
[16:16] from the hand of the mighty angel and
[16:19] ate the open book
[16:22] hallelujah
[16:24] and he then is commissioned to prophesy
[16:27] again unto
[16:29] many towns and nations
[16:33] and then john lived to see the coming of
[16:36] the lord
[16:37] john
[16:38] lived to see
[16:40] the coming of the lord
[16:43] you might ask when
[16:46] well in matthew 17
[16:48] the lord was transfigured before him
[16:52] and he actually saw it
[16:55] in matthew 16 the lord said
[16:57] there be some of you that are standing
[16:59] here that will not even taste that until
[17:02] they see the son of man coming in his
[17:04] glory
[17:06] therefore john saw but the ground who
[17:08] called it the preview of the coming of
[17:11] the lord amen hallelujah because
[17:14] moses was there elijah appeared with the
[17:17] lord jesus moses representing the dead
[17:20] in christ
[17:21] and elijah representing those that are
[17:23] alive and remain
[17:26] this was the sin of the coming of the
[17:28] lord
[17:30] hallelujah and he saw it he was
[17:32] privileged to saw it to see
[17:35] thank you lord
[17:39] and brother branham said
[17:41] in this in question and answers 1961
[17:45] he said this about us
[17:49] but this message that i'm preaching is
[17:51] the true message of this day
[17:54] you agree
[17:56] this is the true message of this day and
[17:58] it's it is the last message
[18:01] amen hallelujah you see what i'm doing
[18:04] brethren he said i'm putting you all in
[18:07] the same place i am
[18:09] because you are just much as much into
[18:11] it as i am and then he said you are
[18:15] messengers
[18:16] of this same message
[18:20] i believe he's addressing the church
[18:22] hallelujah and he's telling us we are
[18:25] messengers of the same message
[18:28] the scene of revelations
[18:30] chapter 10 unfolding the mighty angel
[18:33] coming down
[18:34] with an open book in his hand
[18:37] hallelujah
[18:38] and then
[18:40] in revelations 10 7
[18:42] is is brother branham's ministry
[18:46] he was the one that preached the
[18:49] opening of the seals
[18:51] and then
[18:52] um john was was commanded to take the
[18:56] book and eat it hallelujah and then
[18:59] prophesy again john types the bride of
[19:02] jesus christ john types the rapture
[19:04] bride hallelujah and so we are here to
[19:08] eat the book meaning digest the message
[19:13] meaning leave the message
[19:15] make it a part of our life hallelujah
[19:18] we can demonstrate this the very same
[19:21] life of the son of man the very life of
[19:25] jesus the very life of god hallelujah
[19:28] manifested again in the last days
[19:31] hallelujah how can you manifest it if
[19:33] you don't eat it
[19:35] first you must take the open book
[19:39] first it must be open
[19:41] you see and
[19:43] not just six seals are open
[19:46] but seven sails are open
[19:50] hallelujah
[19:51] because if one seal is left unopened or
[19:54] unbroken hallelujah the book can never
[19:58] come open
[19:59] amen hallelujah so
[20:02] we're living in an open book
[20:05] in this age tonight i believe we are
[20:08] living
[20:10] in in an age where the bible becomes a
[20:13] new book to us
[20:15] hallelujah
[20:16] there's no more mystery about it
[20:23] still
[20:23] mysterious to the to the denominational
[20:26] world out there but to the bride of
[20:28] jesus christ there's no more mystery
[20:31] amen hallelujah because in the days of
[20:33] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[20:36] shall begin to sound then the mystery of
[20:38] god should be finished
[20:40] it shall be finished to the bride of
[20:42] christ
[20:44] hallelujah
[20:46] you see but
[20:47] we should not be content i believe
[20:51] we're just
[20:53] discussing the message
[20:55] talking about the message
[20:57] hallelujah
[20:59] we need to take the book and eat it
[21:02] hallelujah
[21:03] we need to live this message
[21:06] hallelujah this precious message that
[21:08] the lord
[21:10] gave us the privilege to hear in this
[21:13] last day
[21:14] hallelujah because you
[21:17] become
[21:18] the messengers of this same message
[21:21] hallelujah
[21:25] hallelujah
[21:28] but yet we have something to do right
[21:32] hallelujah we are left with the open
[21:34] book
[21:35] we are left with elijah's robe
[21:38] hallelujah
[21:41] and a double portion of the spirit
[21:50] this message is not just for ministers
[21:54] to argue about in ministers meaning
[21:57] hallelujah
[21:58] this message is the power of god
[22:01] amen hallelujah this message is not a
[22:03] set of doctrines that we discovered
[22:08] this message is the very life of
[22:10] god hallelujah
[22:13] and you are messengers of this same
[22:16] message
[22:17] amen
[22:19] in end-time evangelism
[22:24] said this god is looking for character
[22:29] not membership character
[22:31] eliezer
[22:33] when he went to get the bride of christ
[22:36] or the bride of isa
[22:38] he sweated it out until he found
[22:41] character
[22:43] right hallelujah he did not just
[22:46] uh go and try to find some
[22:49] uh
[22:50] women out there on the street
[22:54] he made sure he found character right
[22:57] here
[22:58] remember
[22:59] abraham
[23:00] put him responsible
[23:03] as god puts us
[23:06] responsible
[23:08] i hope you you catch this brothers and
[23:11] sisters
[23:12] this is a big responsibility amen
[23:15] abraham put eliezer responsible
[23:19] as god puts us
[23:21] responsible but mindset
[23:24] and then he said heart my bride
[23:28] hallelujah that's our commission
[23:33] in this half hour silence right of the
[23:36] seventh seal
[23:37] is to hunt my bride hallelujah
[23:41] you know you don't hunt
[23:44] as some domesticated chicken
[23:48] no
[23:50] you hunt the rare specie
[23:56] you hung eagles
[23:58] you have to go to the highways and the
[24:00] byways
[24:02] to find the predestinated seed
[24:04] to find character
[24:07] hallelujah we're not trying to find
[24:09] church members here
[24:12] hallelujah right
[24:14] we're finding the last scene
[24:17] the last of the seed of abraham
[24:20] hallelujah and it's a big responsibility
[24:24] hallelujah
[24:26] i don't see how
[24:27] message believers can be
[24:30] complacent
[24:33] and be contented with just sitting in a
[24:35] pew
[24:37] and having
[24:38] some fellowship chips picnic yeah
[24:42] well there's a lot to be done
[24:44] hallelujah we are responsible god is
[24:47] holding us responsible as abraham help
[24:50] eliezer responsible
[24:52] amen i hope that saves
[24:55] hallelujah because that's what we are
[24:57] here for right
[24:59] that is our commission that's the
[25:01] ministry the ministry and the commission
[25:04] of the bride of christ is to heart
[25:07] god's seed
[25:09] hallelujah
[25:11] in the book of
[25:13] john chapter 19 verse 26 and 27
[25:17] this was
[25:20] when jesus was crucified
[25:24] at the foot of the cross
[25:27] as he was hanging on the cross he saw
[25:29] mary there verse 26 says
[25:32] when jesus therefore saw his mother and
[25:34] he and the disciples standing by
[25:37] whom he loved
[25:39] so he saw two persons marrying his
[25:42] mother
[25:43] and
[25:44] the disciple the disciple whom he loved
[25:48] of course we understand
[25:50] that this disciple whom especially love
[25:55] there's nothing is this uh none other
[25:57] than john the divine
[25:59] hallelujah the
[26:01] disciple
[26:03] whom jesus loved
[26:05] he said unto his mother woman
[26:08] behold thy son
[26:10] and in verse 27 then said he to the
[26:13] disciple behold thy mother
[26:18] it was like
[26:19] jesus was now relinquishing his
[26:22] human responsibility
[26:25] of taking care of his mother
[26:29] he's not dying on the cross his earthly
[26:32] ministry was finished
[26:34] hallelujah but somebody has to take care
[26:36] of his mother in the flesh
[26:38] so he commissioned john
[26:40] hallelujah amen of all the disciples it
[26:43] was john the jesus commission to take
[26:47] care of his mother
[26:50] hallelujah i hope you can see yourself
[26:52] here
[26:53] the jesus commissioned he relinquished
[26:56] his earthly responsibility to john
[26:59] the disciple the bible said whom jesus
[27:02] loved amen
[27:04] hallelujah
[27:06] and then
[27:08] and then the bible said and from that
[27:10] hour that disciple took her unto his own
[27:13] home
[27:15] right he assumed now the role of being
[27:18] the son
[27:19] of mary
[27:23] he took her home with him
[27:25] and from that time on
[27:27] hallelujah the responsibility of jesus
[27:30] fell upon john
[27:32] hallelujah
[27:33] i hope you're seeing yourself now
[27:36] amen
[27:36] hallelujah
[27:38] in john right
[27:44] john is quite an interesting
[27:47] person right
[27:51] he's quite a character
[27:54] he's known in the bible as
[27:58] the sons of thunder him and his brother
[28:00] james
[28:01] right
[28:02] of course you know the reason why
[28:05] they're called sons of thunder
[28:08] because
[28:09] he's so
[28:11] aggressive
[28:13] and
[28:15] he's so bold
[28:17] in wanting to
[28:19] promote the lord
[28:21] hallelujah and promote the gospel we
[28:23] read in luke chapter 9 verse
[28:26] 53-55 where it says and they did not
[28:29] receive him the lord jesus
[28:31] the samaritan people they did not
[28:34] receive him because his ways his face
[28:37] was as though he would he would go to
[28:39] jerusalem
[28:40] and when his disciples james and john
[28:43] saw this
[28:44] the bible said they said lord wilt thou
[28:47] that we command fire to come down from
[28:49] heaven and consume them even as goliaths
[28:52] dead
[28:54] it's interesting that
[28:56] that they made mention of the prophet
[28:59] elias or elijah
[29:01] hallelujah
[29:03] because like the prophet elijah they are
[29:06] now getting a complex
[29:08] come on
[29:09] because
[29:11] because they did not receive him
[29:15] hallelujah
[29:17] and they were very zealous
[29:20] in telling other people about christ
[29:23] in promoting his ministry telling about
[29:25] them about the gospel that he carries
[29:28] and when they did not the people did not
[29:30] believe him
[29:31] now they want
[29:33] the lord to rain fire and brimstone upon
[29:36] the people and kill them all
[29:38] hallelujah
[29:41] do you remember elijah had the same
[29:43] complex
[29:46] in first kings chapter 19 he tells of
[29:48] the story where
[29:49] after
[29:51] shaming the 800 or so prophets of baal
[29:56] hallelujah
[29:58] in a showdown on mount carmel all right
[30:02] verbatim
[30:04] speaks of this
[30:06] anointing leaving elijah
[30:09] and now we see him
[30:11] um he
[30:13] always sings just the negatives
[30:16] he was telling god i'm i'm very zealous
[30:19] for you my lord oh god
[30:22] but then your people they have
[30:25] uh
[30:26] disobeyed your commandments they have
[30:28] torn down the altars and slayed your
[30:31] prophets with the sword
[30:34] now only i am left
[30:37] and thereafter my life
[30:40] you see
[30:41] he was having a complex
[30:44] hallelujah
[30:45] because the people
[30:47] would not receive his
[30:49] hallelujah if you're not careful things
[30:53] we will develop the same complex
[30:58] for the love of this message
[31:00] the seal that we have in trying to
[31:02] communicate to others
[31:05] and people just keep on turning us down
[31:07] and turning us down and rejecting the
[31:08] message rejecting the grace of god upon
[31:11] their lives
[31:12] hallelujah if we're not careful
[31:15] we'll develop a complex
[31:18] and we'll be like john
[31:21] because john pipes the bride amen
[31:25] will will we'll take on this
[31:28] self-righteous
[31:30] spirit
[31:32] and
[31:33] we will begin judging others just
[31:35] because they wouldn't believe
[31:37] the first time we tell them
[31:39] hallelujah
[31:41] brothers and sisters let's be careful
[31:43] right the lord told obey a
[31:46] parable
[31:47] in in the bible in one of the gospels
[31:50] he told he told of the parable of the
[31:52] two sons
[31:54] which the father asked to work in his
[31:56] vineyard
[31:57] the older one said after he asked him to
[32:01] work in his vineyard the older one said
[32:04] yes i would go and work
[32:07] work for you today
[32:09] but
[32:10] the older one did not go he just said
[32:13] yes
[32:15] and then the younger one said
[32:17] no at first
[32:19] right and then he changed his mind
[32:22] and he went to work in his father's
[32:24] virginia the question is which one of
[32:26] these two son did the will of the father
[32:30] the one that said no at first
[32:34] hallelujah you see people can say no at
[32:37] first this message
[32:39] hallelujah right
[32:41] like paul first persecuted the first
[32:43] christian
[32:45] and said no to the gospel
[32:47] but then god turned him around
[32:50] and he saw the light he received the
[32:51] revelation
[32:53] hallelujah of the gospel
[32:56] thank you jesus so
[32:59] i'm encouraging your saints right amen
[33:02] hallelujah
[33:04] not to give up not to be discouraged
[33:06] hallelujah just because three people
[33:08] said no hallelujah
[33:11] that's the way you have to stop right
[33:13] amen you have to press on
[33:16] hallelujah because you have a great
[33:19] responsibility before you
[33:21] god is holding you responsible as
[33:23] abraham is holding hell
[33:26] eliezer responsible to heart god's bride
[33:30] amen
[33:32] hallelujah
[33:35] that's why in the philippines you have
[33:36] never stopped
[33:39] hallelujah
[33:40] we still do the message presentation
[33:42] seminars
[33:44] hallelujah how can we stop doing
[33:46] something that is born so much true
[33:49] and has led hundreds maybe thousands of
[33:52] believers denominational christians into
[33:55] the light of the message of the hour
[33:57] right amen hallelujah
[34:00] just this month
[34:02] i was in the city of kalaukani
[34:05] conducting a seminar
[34:08] amongst ministers and workers of four
[34:11] trinitarian uh
[34:14] churches pentecostals through italian
[34:16] churches
[34:17] in kaluakan city and my they just love
[34:21] what they heard
[34:23] amen hallelujah
[34:26] and
[34:27] and now we're getting ready for a bigger
[34:30] bigger seminar maybe when we go back
[34:35] hallelujah
[34:38] they're organizing a seminar where about
[34:41] 100 ministers will be in participation
[34:45] because they want to hear more they want
[34:47] to share what they heard the first time
[34:49] hallelujah
[34:51] about the message
[34:53] uh that god has uh given us in these
[34:56] last days to get the bride ready for the
[34:59] rapture
[35:00] hallelujah
[35:04] so i can think of hundreds of
[35:06] denominational groups
[35:09] that have forsaken their organization
[35:13] to embrace the truth of the message of
[35:15] the app
[35:17] hallelujah
[35:18] well
[35:20] somebody tried to do it in in
[35:24] in ohio
[35:26] because it was it's
[35:28] it has been very successful in our
[35:30] country
[35:32] they think maybe it's gonna work in ohio
[35:35] so they invited about 200
[35:37] denominational ministers to come to a
[35:41] uh message presentation seminar
[35:45] and
[35:49] on the day of the seminar only two
[35:51] ministers showed up
[35:53] out of the two hundred only two showed
[35:55] up
[35:57] so they
[35:58] they went ahead and all right and and uh
[36:02] did the presentation anyway and video
[36:04] the presentation
[36:06] and they sent the 200 ministers that
[36:09] were invited copies of the
[36:13] expo seminar video uh
[36:16] expo seminar hallelujah so they wouldn't
[36:19] come to the seminar the brother said
[36:22] we take the seminar to them
[36:29] so i understand it's not working in
[36:31] america
[36:33] but it is still working in our country
[36:36] hallelujah god is still calling amen
[36:39] hallelujah
[36:41] not just ministers not just pastors
[36:43] because usefully when the pastor
[36:46] receives a revelation of the the message
[36:50] and he starts sharing it to his people
[36:53] and the whole congregation comes in
[36:57] amen right now we are working with at
[36:59] least 200 groups that have recently in
[37:03] the in the past four or five years
[37:05] coming to the message in the philippines
[37:08] so we're combating your prayers do you
[37:11] promise to pray for us
[37:13] because it's such a challenge
[37:15] to be facing all those
[37:17] learned men
[37:19] they've been in seminaries five five
[37:21] years in the theological colleges and
[37:25] earned their uh uh
[37:27] doctorate
[37:29] in theology
[37:31] and you have to face them and teach them
[37:33] about the word hallelujah
[37:38] you don't know what kinds of what kind
[37:40] of questions they'll be asking
[37:44] but by the grace of god hallelujah
[37:47] all questions this far has been answered
[37:50] amen
[37:51] hallelujah
[37:53] praise
[37:54] praise the lord because i believe we
[37:55] have the answer
[37:57] amen right man you believe the message
[38:00] you have the answer
[38:02] because the message is god's word for
[38:03] the day
[38:05] hallelujah
[38:10] and so jesus you turned and rebuked them
[38:12] and said you know not what manner of
[38:14] spirit you are off he rebuked john
[38:19] he said the son of man came to save
[38:22] lives not to destroy them amen
[38:25] hallelujah
[38:27] amen so john learned a lesson on
[38:30] grace hallelujah
[38:34] and we need to be careful because
[38:37] i find it a lot amongst message
[38:39] believers message churches
[38:43] it's easy
[38:45] it's easy to judge other people just
[38:47] because they said no the first time
[38:50] hallelujah but we need to be patient
[38:52] with people amen
[38:54] hallelujah
[39:02] because they're not coming because you
[39:04] know
[39:05] right we're good at sharing the message
[39:07] to them
[39:10] they're not coming because of our
[39:11] ability
[39:16] they're coming because of the grace of
[39:17] god right man
[39:20] and that's the way we all came by the
[39:22] grace of god amen hallelujah
[39:25] we don't all deserve to be in the bride
[39:31] we deserve to to go to hell is what we
[39:34] deserve that's right
[39:35] hallelujah amen but then god is has been
[39:38] so gracious to us right he showed us
[39:41] grace and
[39:43] showed us a revelation of the word
[39:45] right
[39:46] so you see the transformation of john
[39:48] now
[39:50] from having the self-righteous and
[39:54] condemnative spirit or attitude
[39:57] hallelujah
[39:59] he turned to be
[40:01] the apostle i call him the apostle of
[40:04] love
[40:07] hallelujah first john chapter four seven
[40:10] and eight
[40:11] here's what he has to say the one that
[40:13] wrote the book of revelation
[40:18] the one that has been entrusted
[40:23] with the deep things of god
[40:26] hallelujah
[40:28] he said in first gen 4 78
[40:32] beloved
[40:34] let us love one
[40:36] another this is deep brothers and
[40:39] sisters
[40:42] hallelujah you think the open is deep
[40:44] you think uh the seven seals are deep
[40:48] this is deep amen hallelujah
[40:53] hallelujah for the love for love is of
[40:57] god and everyone that loves it is born
[41:00] of god right
[41:01] oh my god
[41:03] right that's why
[41:05] the bible calls him john the beloved
[41:09] hallelujah john the beloved
[41:12] he that love it is born of god and
[41:14] knoweth god he that love it not know it
[41:17] god know it not god for god is love
[41:23] how deeper can you get again
[41:26] hallelujah amen
[41:32] of all the four gospel writers john
[41:35] caught the revelation of agape right
[41:38] right because he writes in john 13
[41:42] the words of the lord jesus he said a
[41:44] new commandment i give unto you that you
[41:46] love one another as i have loved you
[41:49] that ye also love one another by this
[41:52] shall all men know that you are my
[41:55] disciples if you love for one another
[41:59] hallelujah
[42:02] thank you jesus
[42:07] he understood that agape is the greatest
[42:10] amen
[42:13] now there are by the three things love
[42:17] of hope big hope and charity and the
[42:20] greatest is love
[42:23] paul said even here
[42:26] you have all the revelation of the word
[42:30] and if you don't have love in you
[42:33] it means nothing amen amen
[42:36] hallelujah you are nothing
[42:38] john 15 12 and 13
[42:41] this is my commandment jesus said that
[42:44] you love one another as i have loved you
[42:49] love one another as i have loved you
[42:53] hallelujah
[42:54] greater love than no
[42:56] no man than this
[42:58] then a man laid down his life for his
[43:01] friend
[43:04] what a love
[43:05] that's right hallelujah that somebody
[43:07] would die for me that's right amen for
[43:10] sinners such as i
[43:12] hallelujah
[43:15] so this is the original teaching
[43:18] amen is the teaching on agape right
[43:22] first john chapter 3 verse 11.
[43:27] says for this is the message that you've
[43:30] heard from the beginning
[43:33] so this is the original message my
[43:35] friends
[43:37] this is the message that you heard from
[43:39] the beginning
[43:40] that what that we should love one
[43:43] another amen
[43:46] not as kane who was that
[43:49] of the wicked one and slew his
[43:52] brother and that were for saluting him
[43:54] because his own words were evil and his
[43:58] brother's righteous
[44:01] at the end of the day
[44:02] the battle is going to be
[44:05] against
[44:07] between the love of god and the hatred
[44:10] of the devil
[44:11] amen
[44:12] hallelujah
[44:14] people were being so bound with the
[44:17] hatred of the devil as chaos
[44:20] hallelujah to kill his own brother
[44:24] all right
[44:25] but in the same token people will be so
[44:28] engulfed with the love of god that's
[44:30] right hallelujah to be able to love
[44:33] their enemies and verb said to love the
[44:36] unlovable amen right
[44:38] to be able to pray for those who
[44:40] despisefully use
[44:43] hallelujah and give the other chick
[44:46] hallelujah
[44:48] love the unlovable
[44:51] thank you jesus
[44:53] amen
[44:54] talk about the original teaching
[44:56] amen right this is it all right
[44:59] hallelujah
[45:01] it's actually the proof of individual
[45:03] spirit according to john first john
[45:05] chapter 3 verse 23 to 24 and this is his
[45:08] commandment that we should believe on
[45:10] the name of his son jesus christ and
[45:13] love one another
[45:16] listen to the disciple the apostle of
[45:18] love
[45:20] this is his commandment that we should
[45:22] believe in the name of his son jesus
[45:24] christ and love one another as he gave
[45:27] us commandments
[45:28] right and he that keepeth his
[45:30] commandments dwelled in him and he in
[45:32] him hereby we know that he abideth in us
[45:35] by the spirit which he has given us
[45:39] the holy spirit is truly dwelling in you
[45:42] you can't help but love your brother
[45:44] that's right
[45:47] hallelujah
[45:55] question is do you know god that's it
[46:01] that's the foundation that's the
[46:03] foundation of the church
[46:05] is the revelation of who jesus christ is
[46:09] upon this rock he said i will build my
[46:11] church and the gates of hell will never
[46:14] prevail against it amen first john 4 7 8
[46:18] 7 and 8 beloved let us love one another
[46:26] this is deep my brothers and sisters
[46:30] let us love one another for love is of
[46:33] god and everyone that love it is born of
[46:35] god and know it god
[46:38] he that love it no neither love it not
[46:41] know it not god for god is love
[46:46] and how many people say they know the
[46:47] message
[46:50] they know the doctrine of the godhead
[46:52] come on they know who jesus christ said
[46:55] right hallelujah
[46:59] and can't love their brothers
[47:04] just because they have a different way
[47:06] of seeing things
[47:08] hallelujah
[47:12] can't love your brother because
[47:14] he goes with some other camp
[47:16] that you don't fellowship with
[47:21] let me tell you one thing about him
[47:23] denominational system is a carnal system
[47:27] that separates brotherhood oh amen
[47:30] hallelujah
[47:31] and we think we've come out of the
[47:33] nominational system
[47:38] don't have enough love to forgive our
[47:39] brothers and sisters
[47:43] to try to get go along with them no
[47:45] matter the differences but being said
[47:49] because if you think of it no two person
[47:52] can agree a hundred percent in
[47:54] understanding the scriptures
[47:57] not in this flesh
[48:01] let's get real
[48:03] hallelujah
[48:04] if not two person can see eye to eye
[48:07] hundred percent on scriptures because
[48:09] we're still in this flesh hallelujah the
[48:12] remedy is love
[48:19] you have to have enough love in you to
[48:21] understand your brother
[48:23] amen
[48:25] you have to have enough love in you to
[48:27] give grace to those who need it
[48:30] and not to be asking the lord to send
[48:32] fire from heaven and consume the people
[48:34] that don't agree with us
[48:41] somebody said
[48:43] it's a sad thing that we all came out of
[48:45] the nomination
[48:47] but denomination has not come out of
[48:49] some people
[48:53] hallelujah because it's a carnal spirit
[48:55] that separates brotherhood
[48:58] hallelujah
[49:04] first gen 4
[49:05] verse 11 and 12.
[49:08] i mean we've been reading from the
[49:09] epistles of saint john
[49:13] and
[49:14] this is all he has to say
[49:16] beloved
[49:18] if god so loved us we are also to love
[49:21] one another
[49:22] no man has seen god at any time if we
[49:25] love one another god dwelled in us and
[49:27] his love is perfected in us
[49:33] talk about perfection
[49:36] the bride is going to be perfect amen
[49:40] hallelujah you remember the statue of a
[49:42] perfect man brother even drew a diagram
[49:45] for us
[49:47] all these glitches
[49:49] hallelujah need to be in a believer
[49:53] hallelujah
[49:57] because if you think about it
[49:59] nobody's perfect
[50:01] not one of us
[50:02] the bible said all have come short of
[50:05] the glory of god
[50:07] hallelujah there's only one that's
[50:09] perfect and that's jesus christ
[50:11] hallelujah
[50:13] but praise the lord
[50:16] because jesus christ
[50:18] now dwells in a body of believers called
[50:20] the bride of christ amen
[50:23] hallelujah
[50:28] no man has seen god at any time but they
[50:30] belove one another god dwells in us
[50:33] oh my
[50:34] and his love is perfected in us right
[50:39] lord to god
[50:42] second john chapter 1 verse 5. if you
[50:44] love him you will obey his word
[50:48] and now
[50:49] john said
[50:51] listen to the doctrine
[50:53] of saint john
[50:54] this is very deep teaching now
[50:59] now i resist the lady
[51:02] talking about the elect lady
[51:05] of all the disciples john wrote to the
[51:08] elect lady lady he addresses his epistle
[51:12] to the elect lady and we know that's the
[51:14] bride
[51:17] not as though i wrote a new commandment
[51:19] in today but that's which we had from
[51:21] the beginning that we love one another
[51:26] john don't you have anything deeper to
[51:28] say
[51:33] right
[51:40] beloved if god so loved us we ought to
[51:42] also to love one another no man had seen
[51:45] god at any time if we love one another
[51:47] god dwelled in us and his love is
[51:49] perfected in us
[51:52] ii john 1 5 and now i beseech the lady
[51:56] not as though i wrote a new commandment
[51:58] unto thee but that which we had from the
[52:00] beginning that we love one another
[52:04] hallelujah and this is love
[52:08] let me walk after his commandments
[52:11] this is the commandment
[52:13] that as you have heard from the
[52:14] beginning you should walk in it walk in
[52:17] what walk in love
[52:21] hallelujah amen
[52:27] that's why he has this revelation in
[52:29] first john chapter 3 verse 16.
[52:32] you know john chapter 3 verse 16 speaks
[52:35] about the love of god for god so loved
[52:38] the world that he gave his only begotten
[52:41] son
[52:41] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[52:44] not perish but have everlasting life
[52:48] but john called a revelation of that
[52:50] scripture
[52:51] hallelujah he understood that that
[52:54] scripture has been fulfilled by the lord
[52:56] jesus christ
[52:59] it has himself been fulfilled
[53:01] but we have a scripture to fulfill and
[53:04] that is in first john chapter 3 verse 16
[53:08] it's not hard to remember
[53:10] john 3 16 first john chapter 3 verse 16.
[53:15] you know what it says let me read it to
[53:17] you hereby perceive we the love of god
[53:23] because he laid down his life for us
[53:28] and we are to lay down our lives for the
[53:31] brethren
[53:34] amen
[53:35] oh my
[53:38] this is the love of god
[53:40] hallelujah
[53:42] not to say to your brother or your
[53:44] sister on sunday morning god bless you
[53:46] my brother god bless you my sister
[53:49] but to actually lay down your life for
[53:51] the sake of your brethren
[53:58] eternal life you want to know you have
[54:01] eternal life if you
[54:03] want to make sure you possess eternal
[54:05] life is said right you will expand your
[54:08] life benefiting others
[54:12] eternal life is living
[54:15] for others amen that's right
[54:23] so hallelujah was told to come up here
[54:27] i'm reading better venom
[54:29] revelation chapter 4
[54:32] he said after this i looked and behold a
[54:35] door was open in heaven
[54:37] and the first voice which i heard was as
[54:40] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[54:42] said come up hither and i will show the
[54:46] things which must be hereafter
[54:49] but said

[58:41] up together and made us sit together in
[58:43] heavenly places in christ jesus our
[58:46] thoughts
[58:47] should transcend the troubles of this
[58:49] world
[58:50] this present world we are looking away
[58:53] from the world unto jesus the author and
[58:57] the finisher of our faith
[58:59] hallelujah
[59:02] you see john was the disciple that was
[59:05] closest to the lord
[59:08] verbum said
[59:10] they're about the same age john was the
[59:13] youngest
[59:14] disciple
[59:15] they were about the same age maybe
[59:17] that's that's the factor that that draw
[59:20] them together
[59:22] um they have a lot of things in common
[59:26] they're of the same age
[59:29] and we read in the bible peter turning
[59:31] about seeing the disciple whom jesus
[59:34] loved
[59:36] following
[59:37] which also
[59:39] leaned on the breast
[59:41] on his breast at supper and said lord
[59:43] which is he that betrayed me you see
[59:46] john is always seen leaning on the bosom
[59:50] of the lord jesus christ never that
[59:52] close
[59:54] hallelujah
[59:56] if you see two guys
[59:58] being disclosed nowadays you question
[1:00:01] them
[1:00:04] right you have a question
[1:00:07] hallelujah
[1:00:08] but see
[1:00:09] they have this
[1:00:11] affection
[1:00:13] towards each other it's not a carnal
[1:00:15] affection
[1:00:17] it's the love of god
[1:00:19] hallelujah
[1:00:22] when you're that close to him
[1:00:25] you can hear his heart cry
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:31] you can hear his love secrets as he
[1:00:33] whispers them to you
[1:00:36] you can hear his you can know his
[1:00:38] deepest desires
[1:00:41] question is are you staying close to the
[1:00:43] lord
[1:00:44] is your mind set on him
[1:00:47] do you mind heavenly things
[1:00:50] are you always reading his love letter
[1:00:52] to you
[1:00:54] have you been listening to the message
[1:00:56] do you have a decide to know more of him
[1:01:00] hallelujah
[1:01:02] do you like it when he whispers love
[1:01:05] secret to you secrets to you
[1:01:09] do you love it when he reveals his word
[1:01:11] to you
[1:01:13] hallelujah
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:16] the bride shouldn't have to be told
[1:01:20] this is what the prophet said spoken
[1:01:21] word reveals fig
[1:01:23] here is the secret he said
[1:01:26] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:01:29] christ to know what he wants done with
[1:01:32] the word amen
[1:01:34] my
[1:01:36] and she does it in his name
[1:01:39] she does thus said the lord or she keeps
[1:01:42] still all right amen hallelujah
[1:01:46] the bride knows because she has the mind
[1:01:48] of christ all right amen hallelujah you
[1:01:52] don't have to keep on telling her
[1:01:55] because she knows what god once done
[1:01:58] with his word
[1:02:00] hallelujah that's right he has the ego
[1:02:03] anointing
[1:02:05] you know the four gospel writers
[1:02:07] they have four different kind of
[1:02:09] anointings
[1:02:11] hallelujah the four beasts of revelation
[1:02:15] chapter four and five
[1:02:17] hallelujah matches spoke of his kingship
[1:02:22] if you read matthew's gospel
[1:02:25] you seem to concentrate on the kingship
[1:02:27] of jesus
[1:02:29] that's why
[1:02:30] you can read
[1:02:31] his
[1:02:32] genealogy is traced back
[1:02:35] to david the king the son of david
[1:02:38] is called in matthew
[1:02:40] hallelujah why because matthew had the
[1:02:43] anointing of the lion
[1:02:46] lion is king
[1:02:48] hallelujah
[1:02:49] mark
[1:02:50] on the other hand
[1:02:52] recorded more of the things that jesus
[1:02:55] did right
[1:02:57] not so much what he said but
[1:02:59] what he did right
[1:03:01] he portrayed jesus as a priest a servant
[1:03:07] and that's the anointing of an ox
[1:03:10] of the ox the
[1:03:12] anointing
[1:03:14] hallelujah servant who
[1:03:17] and luke speaks about people portrays
[1:03:21] his humanity
[1:03:23] hallelujah because luke
[1:03:26] had the anointing of a man
[1:03:29] but john
[1:03:30] hallelujah he had the anointing of the
[1:03:34] ego amen
[1:03:36] that's why he could write in his gospel
[1:03:38] i and my father are one in the beginning
[1:03:41] was the word and the word was with god
[1:03:44] and the word was god
[1:03:45] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:03:50] the holy ghost is your comforter
[1:03:53] hallelujah i will not leave you
[1:03:54] comfortless i will come to you
[1:03:57] speaks of theophanies in my father's
[1:04:00] house are many mansions
[1:04:02] hallelujah
[1:04:04] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:04:06] you see can you see that john has a much
[1:04:09] higher revelation because he had the
[1:04:12] anointing of an eagle amen
[1:04:15] glory to god amen john was a prophet you
[1:04:18] know
[1:04:20] of all these four gospel writers john
[1:04:22] was a prophet
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:26] he wrote
[1:04:28] the book of revelation
[1:04:32] the last book of prophecy
[1:04:34] in the bible
[1:04:35] hallelujah
[1:04:37] see the ego is a heavenly creature
[1:04:42] if you notice the other three the other
[1:04:44] three beasts or anointings were all
[1:04:46] earthly creatures
[1:04:49] but the eagle is heavenly
[1:04:52] of all the beasts the eagle doesn't
[1:04:54] drink milk as an infant right
[1:04:57] all the three other bees
[1:05:00] they drink milk
[1:05:02] but the ego
[1:05:04] has an infant
[1:05:06] he already eats meat
[1:05:10] not just meat but fresh meat amen amen
[1:05:14] the strong meat of the word of god we
[1:05:16] read in the book of job chapter 39 verse
[1:05:20] 27 to 2029 where it says
[1:05:23] does the ego mount up
[1:05:25] at thy command
[1:05:27] and make her nest on high
[1:05:30] she dwelled and abided on the rock
[1:05:33] upon the crate of the rock the strong
[1:05:35] place
[1:05:36] from then she seeketh the prey and her
[1:05:39] eyes behold afar off
[1:05:41] verse 13 her young ones also suck up the
[1:05:45] blood and were the slain are there is
[1:05:48] she
[1:05:59] and these prophets are eagles
[1:06:02] amen hallelujah and the bible said
[1:06:08] where the newly slained
[1:06:11] animal is where the carcass is
[1:06:14] there the eagles will be gathered
[1:06:16] together
[1:06:18] hallelujah
[1:06:20] the eagles the eagle is able to soar
[1:06:23] high altitudes where pressure is so
[1:06:25] strong
[1:06:28] hallelujah
[1:06:30] the eagle dwells in the cleft of the
[1:06:33] rock
[1:06:34] amen up high in the mountain
[1:06:37] the eagle is faithful to her mate
[1:06:43] it is monogamous through life
[1:06:49] the ego is capable of renewing its
[1:06:51] strength amen
[1:06:55] so we can see that john was the most
[1:06:57] revelated of all gospel writers
[1:07:01] hallelujah
[1:07:04] and in john chapter 20 something strikes
[1:07:07] me as i read this
[1:07:09] because it speaks of the character of
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:13] regenerated john
[1:07:18] john chapter 20 verse four to eight
[1:07:21] so they ran both together
[1:07:24] and the other disciple did ultron peter
[1:07:27] and came first to the sepulcher
[1:07:31] the other disciple was john
[1:07:35] doesn't it interest you that john wrote
[1:07:38] the gospel of saint john and he doesn't
[1:07:40] mention his name in this gospel
[1:07:44] not one time
[1:07:46] did he mention his name he always refers
[1:07:49] to himself as the disciple
[1:07:52] which the lord who whom the lord love it
[1:07:55] than the other disciple
[1:07:58] but never mentioning his name
[1:08:02] it's his book
[1:08:04] but he's not mentioning his name
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:15] it shows something it's yours john's
[1:08:18] character
[1:08:19] hallelujah
[1:08:22] and he
[1:08:24] stooping down and looking in saw the
[1:08:27] linen clothes lying
[1:08:30] yet but he not in
[1:08:32] and then cometh simon peter following
[1:08:34] him and went into the talker
[1:08:39] and see it the linen clothes lie
[1:08:42] you see being younger he was able to
[1:08:44] outrun peter
[1:08:46] he came to the grave first
[1:08:50] but then
[1:08:52] look what happened the napkin that was
[1:08:54] about his head not lying with the linen
[1:08:56] clothes but wrapped together in a place
[1:08:58] by itself and then went in also the
[1:09:01] other disciple which came first to this
[1:09:04] sepoka and he saw and believed
[1:09:09] he came to the grave first
[1:09:13] but he waited for the older one
[1:09:16] to come in
[1:09:19] and then he came in right amen
[1:09:21] this shows humility
[1:09:25] this shows respect
[1:09:27] hallelujah this shows christian
[1:09:30] character come on
[1:09:32] hallelujah of being respectful
[1:09:36] to elders
[1:09:38] hallelujah
[1:09:40] you know what
[1:09:41] i've heard a lot of
[1:09:45] young ministers in the message
[1:09:48] and they run the older ones
[1:09:51] because they think they know more right
[1:09:54] of the message now than the older ones
[1:09:58] just because the older ones they cannot
[1:10:00] they don't know how to operate their
[1:10:02] computer
[1:10:07] but they know they know just how to do
[1:10:10] it
[1:10:11] so
[1:10:13] and i watch them they become
[1:10:15] disrespectful
[1:10:17] just because they know more
[1:10:20] that's not john
[1:10:22] i am hallelujah
[1:10:24] john was humble enough
[1:10:26] to wait for the elderly
[1:10:29] let him go into the simple curve first
[1:10:32] and then he went in amen
[1:10:35] to god
[1:10:41] one last point before we close
[1:10:46] in question to now answers hebrews
[1:10:49] 1957
[1:10:51] brother said this about the 24 elders
[1:10:55] he said the four and 20 elders
[1:10:58] he said an elder is an overseer
[1:11:02] now noise
[1:11:04] they were 12
[1:11:05] patriarchs
[1:11:07] and 12
[1:11:08] apostles 12 and 12 is 24.
[1:11:12] that's the old testament chairs in the
[1:11:14] new testament church
[1:11:16] the elders of the old testament church
[1:11:18] are the 12 patriarchs
[1:11:20] the elders of the new testament chairs
[1:11:23] are the 12 original apostles can you see
[1:11:26] that
[1:11:28] hallelujah
[1:11:31] and there were twenty and four elders
[1:11:33] which were the twelve patriarchs on one
[1:11:36] side
[1:11:37] the old testament
[1:11:38] herban said in the 12 apostles on the
[1:11:40] other side of the new testament amen
[1:11:43] so you see john
[1:11:45] was one of the apostles
[1:11:48] therefore john was one of the elders
[1:11:51] do you see that amen say even if you do
[1:11:55] so he was one of the elders
[1:11:58] hallelujah
[1:12:01] in that setting
[1:12:03] the 24 elders were surrounding the
[1:12:06] throne of god
[1:12:08] john
[1:12:09] was was uh
[1:12:12] shown the vision of the throne of god in
[1:12:14] heaven
[1:12:16] there were 24 elders
[1:12:18] around the throne
[1:12:20] hallelujah
[1:12:25] and then barbara said this
[1:12:27] who is this melchizedek
[1:12:30] he said
[1:12:31] then after you recognize the word of god
[1:12:34] was
[1:12:35] eagle food
[1:12:37] then you left the other thing
[1:12:40] whatever it was we were feeding on
[1:12:43] out when we were
[1:12:44] back when we were still in the in the
[1:12:46] denomination after we heard the message
[1:12:51] and we recognize that it's eagle food
[1:12:56] batman said you've then been formed into
[1:12:58] the living image of the living god amen
[1:13:02] he said you heard from your theophany
[1:13:07] hallelujah
[1:13:08] if this earthly body be this hope he
[1:13:10] said we have one waiting
[1:13:15] therefore when we receive a revelation
[1:13:17] of the message
[1:13:19] that meant you heard from your theophany
[1:13:25] did you know john wept
[1:13:29] after he looked in the heavens
[1:13:32] on the earth under the earth
[1:13:34] and found no one that was worthy to open
[1:13:37] the book
[1:13:39] he wept the bible said
[1:13:42] hallelujah until
[1:13:45] one of the elders
[1:13:47] one of the elders told john hallelujah
[1:13:51] we not john because the lion of the
[1:13:54] tribe of judah the root of david has
[1:13:56] prevailed
[1:13:58] to open the book to take the book and
[1:14:02] open the seals thereof
[1:14:04] hallelujah
[1:14:06] and then john from weeping he changed to
[1:14:10] celebrating
[1:14:12] and praising god and rejoicing
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:15] till all the heavens all the angels in
[1:14:18] heaven shut up
[1:14:20] hallelujah right they were all praising
[1:14:22] god but then when john started praising
[1:14:25] verb
[1:14:26] kind of explained it hallelujah
[1:14:28] his voice of praise drowned down the
[1:14:32] praises of the angels in heaven
[1:14:34] oh my
[1:14:36] what joy
[1:14:38] what excitement amen
[1:14:40] hallelujah amen
[1:14:43] because one of the elders said with not
[1:14:45] john
[1:14:47] hallelujah
[1:14:48] amen no but did not say this
[1:14:53] but i'm just saying
[1:14:55] if you heard from your theophany
[1:14:58] and john heard one of the elders say
[1:15:01] weep not john
[1:15:03] and then he got so excited hallelujah
[1:15:06] because the seals have been open
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:10] because he knew
[1:15:12] if no one was found worthy to open the
[1:15:15] book then all mankind is doomed
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:21] but then when when he heard from his
[1:15:23] people
[1:15:24] come on
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:27] that changed the whole thing
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:34] oh my
[1:15:35] i hope you see it amen all right man
[1:15:38] man you know in this last journey you go
[1:15:41] through trials and tests
[1:15:44] you go through a lot of tribulations in
[1:15:47] life
[1:15:48] hallelujah sometimes
[1:15:50] you become lonesome like john
[1:15:53] hallelujah
[1:15:55] and then you get reminded
[1:15:57] of the promises of god in his word
[1:16:02] and weeping changes into rejoicing
[1:16:06] embracing god right
[1:16:08] hallelujah why because you've heard from
[1:16:10] your theophany
[1:16:16] what is what is your theory by the way
[1:16:20] it's your word body
[1:16:25] but it's our
[1:16:27] representation in heaven
[1:16:30] if you're a believer
[1:16:32] your angel always beholds the face of
[1:16:35] the father in heaven
[1:16:38] you are represented in heaven
[1:16:43] your theophany is there
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:49] and when we need to be comforted
[1:16:52] in times of
[1:16:54] deep sorrow
[1:16:57] problems in
[1:17:00] life all we need to do is tune our
[1:17:04] hearing
[1:17:07] and hear from our theory
[1:17:11] be reminded of the promises of god
[1:17:15] hallelujah john was the youngest
[1:17:19] and the last apostle to die
[1:17:22] matter of fact he was the only apostle
[1:17:24] that didn't die a martyr's death right
[1:17:28] hallelujah he died of old age pastoring
[1:17:32] the church in ephesus
[1:17:35] he was faithful till the end amen
[1:17:39] amen one of the songs in this
[1:17:42] song book says will work
[1:17:45] till jesus comes
[1:17:47] will work
[1:17:49] revelations 1
[1:17:50] verse 9 says i john
[1:17:53] who also am your brother and companion
[1:17:56] in tribulation
[1:17:58] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:18:00] christ was in the isle that is called
[1:18:03] patmos for the word of god and for the
[1:18:06] testimony of jesus christ
[1:18:10] he was imprisoned
[1:18:12] and suffered
[1:18:14] for the word of god brother said he was
[1:18:16] trying to compile the new testament
[1:18:19] hallelujah
[1:18:28] that's why peter
[1:18:30] the oldest of all the apostles
[1:18:32] he was given the keys to the kingdom of
[1:18:34] heaven
[1:18:36] he was getting a little jealous
[1:18:38] of this young disciple
[1:18:41] hallelujah
[1:18:42] john 21 grieved me
[1:18:45] in verse 20
[1:18:46] that peter turning about see the
[1:18:48] disciples whom jesus loved following
[1:18:50] which also leaned on his
[1:18:53] breasts that suffer and said lord which
[1:18:55] is he that betrayed me
[1:18:57] peter
[1:18:59] seeing him said to jesus lord
[1:19:01] what shall this man do
[1:19:05] lord i thought you give you gave me the
[1:19:08] keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:19:12] i thought i was the man but what is this
[1:19:14] man doing
[1:19:19] he wouldn't leave your side
[1:19:24] he always wants to stay close to you
[1:19:28] but jesus said unto him if i will
[1:19:31] that he tarry till i come what is that
[1:19:34] to today
[1:19:36] follow theme
[1:19:39] hallelujah
[1:19:40] and then went the same
[1:19:43] there was gossip
[1:19:45] abroad
[1:19:46] amongst the brethren that the disciples
[1:19:49] should not die
[1:19:51] and yet jesus said not unto him he shall
[1:19:54] not die but if i will that he tarries
[1:19:58] till i come what is that today
[1:20:03] hallelujah
[1:20:05] of course
[1:20:06] jan john
[1:20:08] the divine died
[1:20:11] of old age
[1:20:13] hallelujah
[1:20:14] but because john types the bride
[1:20:18] jesus was saying what is it to me peter
[1:20:24] if i allow some people
[1:20:28] hallelujah to witness my coming in the
[1:20:31] end
[1:20:32] what is that to be
[1:20:34] if i allow by my sovereign will
[1:20:38] for some people not to taste that
[1:20:41] hallelujah what is left to defeat peter
[1:20:43] hallelujah
[1:20:46] if some people
[1:20:47] will see the coming of the lord
[1:20:50] alive come on hallelujah amen what is
[1:20:53] that to be peter if if this man
[1:20:56] terrorists
[1:20:58] will be
[1:20:59] of course we understand that it's the
[1:21:01] will of the lord
[1:21:02] that the bride will carry until the
[1:21:05] coming
[1:21:06] of the lord right amen we're still here
[1:21:09] come on i believe we'll see him coming

[1:21:14] resurrection of the dead in christ
[1:21:16] hallelujah amen i believe will be lifted
[1:21:19] up by the power of god to meet him in
[1:21:21] the air
[1:21:22] thank you jesus
[1:21:25] this is the disciple which testified all
[1:21:28] these things
[1:21:29] and
[1:21:30] and
[1:21:31] wrote these things and we know that
[1:21:34] his testimony is true
[1:21:38] and there are also many other things
[1:21:40] which jesus did which if they should be
[1:21:42] written everyone i suppose that even the
[1:21:46] world itself could not contain the books
[1:21:48] that should be written
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:54] the acts of jesus the deeds of jesus
[1:21:57] being written in a book come on
[1:22:00] hallelujah
[1:22:02] the book of acts
[1:22:04] what brown said she explained it it's
[1:22:06] actually not the acts of the apostles
[1:22:09] right
[1:22:10] it's a record of the act of the holy
[1:22:13] spirit in the lives of the apostles
[1:22:15] hallelujah
[1:22:17] and barbara said about that
[1:22:19] the orange tree
[1:22:22] if it ever puts forth an original branch
[1:22:25] hallelujah they will bring forth oranges
[1:22:30] hallelujah and and
[1:22:32] and then and they will write a book a
[1:22:34] book of acts behind them
[1:22:46] the holy spirit that does in each and
[1:22:49] every individual's life could be written
[1:22:53] in a book
[1:22:54] even the whole world cannot contain it
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:00] because right now
[1:23:02] the biography autobiography of saint
[1:23:05] john is still being rude
[1:23:07] because john
[1:23:09] pipes the bride
[1:23:12] the bride
[1:23:14] will tarry until it comes
[1:23:17] they which are alive and remain
[1:23:20] shall be changed and be caught up
[1:23:21] together
[1:23:24] with them with those that are dead in
[1:23:27] christ
[1:23:28] to meet the lord in the air
[1:23:31] first corinthians 15 verse one verse
[1:23:34] first verse verses 51 and 52 says behold
[1:23:37] i show you a mystery
[1:23:40] we shall not all sleep
[1:23:42] but we shall all be changed
[1:23:45] in a moment in a drinking tinkling of an
[1:23:48] eye at the last trump
[1:23:50] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:23:53] shall be raised
[1:23:54] incorrupt
[1:23:57] how do we run
[1:23:59] we are here
[1:24:01] hallelujah
[1:24:03] what are we here for right
[1:24:06] but

[1:25:06] but i'm trusting
[1:25:08] that god is showing you

[1:25:26] prevailed
[1:25:28] and was
[1:25:31] qualified
[1:25:33] was made worthy
[1:25:35] to take the book and break the skills
[1:25:38] thereof
[1:25:39] hallelujah
[1:25:40] because when you see the seals broken
[1:25:43] when you see the book open

[1:25:47] john saw his name in the book
