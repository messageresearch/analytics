[7:02] into the scripture tonight and I'll pray
[7:07] for me I appreciate the appreciate the
[7:09] prayers I know we all need them so
[7:16] tonight we got got a fever
[7:20] get some prayer requests and but uh
[7:25] first thing I want to say is I like to
[7:28] like brother Dale's office the study
[7:30] looks really nice I don't know how many
[7:32] of y'all have been in there some of us
[7:34] have been in there but every time I go
[7:36] in I'm not in there you know tremendous
[7:38] amount of times but every time I go in
[7:39] there and sit down you know if you if
[7:41] you don't want the if you don't like the
[7:42] preacher you have the opportunity lock
[7:44] him in the room I just you know every
[7:47] time I go I didn't mention that last
[7:48] time but every time I walk in there it's
[7:49] like if you don't usually the blocks are
[7:52] on the inside so you keep people out you
[7:53] can keep the you can keep the preacher
[7:55] in there if you don't want him to come
[7:56] out so I don't know what the what the
[8:01] policy is I don't know what that is but
[8:03] you maybe the next time don't worry
[8:06] nothing started I was just wondering I
[8:10] mean that you something that brings
[8:12] questions to your mind you know but
[8:15] appreciate the Lord and this comes from
[8:20] brother Bob brother direct sent word
[8:24] that they are back from the Philippines
[8:28] and so thank the Lord for that but he
[8:32] said the family's not feeling well so
[8:34] y'all pray for them tonight and also
[8:36] keep praying for their house in
[8:38] maryland's that it'll sail so we just
[8:40] want to keep them in prayer and thank
[8:42] the Lord that he brought them back and
[8:45] had a gonna try to keep this brief and
[8:50] we are standing you know sometimes I
[8:54] don't know how y'all I talk about myself
[8:56] you walk around you get in this little
[8:58] melancholy atmosphere and you know you
[9:01] think you think you feel like Elijah in
[9:03] the cave you know Lord why don't you
[9:04] just just take me you know and you and
[9:07] you know the devil talks in both ear so
[9:09] just one Ares in both ears and you know
[9:12] sometimes you just feel like giving up
[9:13] and I know y'all probably don't feel
[9:16] like yet but but I do but uh you know
[9:19] you you fight that a lot and this week
[9:23] you know you're in your own little world
[9:25] and you feel this way and when somebody
[9:29] comes up to you at a man at work he
[9:32] coming and told me his his dad's almost
[9:35] 80 years old and had a stroke the other
[9:38] day and his sister the man that worked
[9:42] with his sister was just the man's
[9:44] daughter the man who had the stroke his
[9:45] daughter took him to the hospital from
[9:48] what I understand he had visible signs
[9:50] of a stroke they took him in there they
[9:53] started running scans and everything
[9:55] like that and while he was they were
[9:58] praying when they Eddie said that they
[10:00] started praying when they took him when
[10:02] he got there they run scans he had no
[10:05] signs of a stroke they run him from head
[10:08] to toe and the doctor told him said I
[10:10] know he had a stroke but they can't
[10:14] prove it none of their tests show that
[10:16] he had a stroke but he's almost 80 years
[10:19] old and there's the problem that he has
[10:21] right now it messed up his equilibrium
[10:23] he's walking with a walker and Eddie
[10:26] said to tell the church to pray for his
[10:28] dead and I said well you know what God
[10:32] ain't never done anything halfway
[10:35] and so just want to thank the Lord for
[10:39] that and you know that really gives you
[10:42] an uplifting but I have another lady
[10:46] that I worked with and she has a brother
[10:48] and a sister that both had cancer and I
[10:51] guess her sister has leukemia and
[10:55] they're looking for a bone marrow donor
[10:57] the family's being tested so far they
[11:00] hadn't come up with a donor for she
[11:03] asked me for us to pray and I said it

[11:31] tribe to it and I said well you know you
[11:34] just got to cast down the Bible says
[11:36] cast down raising and Majan ations and
[11:39] everything because you know the devil is
[11:42] going to tell you what's going all these
[11:44] things that are gonna they're gonna be
[11:45] bad but you know the Bible is full of
[11:48] things that look they look bad for a lot
[11:50] of people and it didn't turn out bad

[14:38] Lord and now that I can just be a vessel
[14:44] Lord worthy to say these things we ask
[14:47] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[14:51] Luke chapter 5 beginning of verse 1 it
[14:55] says and it came to pass that as the
[14:57] people pressed upon him to hear the word
[14:59] of God
[15:00] he stood by the lake gun ENS surrett and
[15:05] saw two ships standing by the lake and
[15:07] by the fishermen were going out of them
[15:10] but the fishermen were going out of them
[15:12] and we're washing their nets and he
[15:14] entered into one of the ships which was
[15:15] Simons and prayed him that he would
[15:18] thrust out a little from the land and he
[15:21] sat down and taught the people out of
[15:23] the ship and when he had left speaking
[15:25] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[15:27] deep and let down your nets for a
[15:29] draught and Simon answering said unto
[15:33] Him master we have told all the night
[15:37] and we have taken nothing nevertheless
[15:39] at that word I will let down the net and
[15:42] when they had this had this done they
[15:47] closed a great multitude of fishes and
[15:50] their net break and they beckoned under
[15:52] their partners which were in the other
[15:54] ship that they should come and help them
[15:57] and they came and filled both the ships
[15:59] so that they began to sink when Simon
[16:01] Peter saw it he fell down on his fell
[16:04] down at Jesus knees saying depart from
[16:06] me for I am a sinful man O Lord for he
[16:09] was astonished and all that with him at
[16:11] the draw to the fishes which they had
[16:15] taken and so was also James and John the
[16:19] sons of Zebedee which were partners with
[16:21] Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not
[16:24] from henceforth thou shalt catch men and
[16:28] when they had brought their ships to
[16:30] land they forsake all and followed him a
[16:33] man God bless you tonight and be seated
[16:42] so
[16:44] this little thought at the word you know
[16:48] brother brems preach preach the number
[16:50] of messages on at thy word and at thy
[16:53] word Lord and you know it's a
[16:58] interesting thought when you look at the
[17:01] when you look at the life of Peter see
[17:05] what what kind of person he was and if
[17:10] they bring up quote number one this is
[17:15] from serves we would see Jesus and
[17:18] brother brems says here comes Peter up
[17:21] his name is Simon here a big old burly
[17:24] lookin fisherman some greasy Fischer
[17:26] fishing apron owning come down sit down
[17:29] there on the on the side of the other
[17:31] side of the log or something listened at
[17:33] him preach when he come up to Jesus he
[17:36] said Pete your name is Simon your father
[17:39] is Jonas how'd he know that your name is
[17:42] Simon your father's name is Jonas but
[17:45] I'm gonna give you another name call you
[17:47] a little stone from now on Peter
[17:49] I can imagine Peter say well Lord Here I
[17:52] am
[17:55] and then the next quote is from here ye
[17:59] him and brother branham talking also
[18:04] about Peter and he says and here God was
[18:08] going to do something great because he
[18:10] was bringing forth Peter James and John
[18:13] and he said I'd call it hope faith and
[18:16] charity the three great gifts of God say
[18:18] take Peter for faith and James for hope
[18:20] and John has always loved which is
[18:22] charity and he takes faith hope and
[18:24] charity with him and he goes up to the
[18:26] mountain because he's fixing to do
[18:28] something he's going to make an
[18:29] expression and he wants it to be
[18:31] confirmed and he always confirms it with
[18:33] three witnesses two or three witnesses
[18:35] that was an Old Testament statement two
[18:38] or three witnesses let every word be
[18:39] established and the third and the third
[18:44] quote is from faith cometh by hearing
[18:49] and everybody I'm sure everybody's knows
[18:52] he says faiths burly as I once said
[18:56] faith has hair on its chest
[18:58] when it stands up and pulls out its big
[19:00] muscles out everything else vanishes
[19:02] away just take flies away when faith
[19:07] really takes a hold nothing else stands
[19:11] you know it's the way you know brother
[19:14] Bram said that Peter was a great big
[19:17] burly man ball headed fisherman in a big
[19:22] big burly man and he said that Peter was
[19:25] a type of faith you know if you look at
[19:29] his if you look at Peters life that's
[19:31] the life of faith and you know when you
[19:36] when you look at Peters life because you
[19:39] know lots of times people we look at the
[19:42] things that Peter done and you know
[19:44] Peter had faults and failures just like
[19:46] all of us but you know what Peter done
[19:49] some great things in his life
[19:51] Peter was given the keys of the kingdom
[19:53] God called him to him to to do a great
[19:56] work and you know there's there's a lot
[19:59] of things and he said you know faith is
[20:02] burly you know always say well every
[20:04] time always read that always think of
[20:06] Pete you know brother branham's
[20:08] describing Peter that way of being a
[20:10] burly guy and having faith you know
[20:13] having hair on his chest and having
[20:14] muscles you know that's the way we ought
[20:16] to have you know not looking at the
[20:19] circumstances but looking at what God
[20:21] said and you know brother Graham said
[20:24] many times he he said you know the right
[20:27] mental attitude to any divine promise of
[20:30] God will bring it to pass
[20:32] and that's the main thing is to have the
[20:33] right mental attitude you know we can we
[20:36] can look back through Peters life and
[20:39] you know later on we'll read some more
[20:43] quotes but you don't if you go back and
[20:45] you look at you know we know that from
[20:47] Peters life Peter was taught the Word of
[20:50] God you know he was able is ignorant and
[20:53] learned but you know what he always knew
[20:54] the word had always been taught the word
[20:57] and you know here here comes Jesus you
[21:01] know to speak to him and you know you
[21:04] know hit they had had fished all night
[21:08] and note no doubt he was very tired that
[21:11] day
[21:11] and you know here you are you you go
[21:14] through all these things you've worked
[21:16] all night and you've told brother Ram
[21:17] said you how hearten disheartening it is
[21:20] when you when you fish all night you
[21:21] don't catch anything and you know
[21:25] brother branham brother Bram said the
[21:27] one thing that that Peter knew was
[21:29] efficient he might not have known
[21:31] anything else couldn't write his own
[21:32] name but he knew how to fish he knew the
[21:37] water he knew the moon all the things
[21:39] that took place to be a fisherman he
[21:40] knew what but you know what Jesus came
[21:45] by one day and told him you know he said
[21:49] I want you Wendy to get in the ship and
[21:51] was preaching to the people and no doubt
[21:54] he knew the situation that Peter had
[21:56] been in but you know he told him it he
[22:00] said launch out into the deep once you
[22:04] launch out and you know the same thing
[22:09] is to us you know what there's the deep
[22:14] things of God the Bible says for us to
[22:17] search the deep things of God and it's
[22:21] and it's placed there and a lot of
[22:23] people think that they know you know
[22:27] many times we let our we let the
[22:29] situations that were in you brother
[22:33] Graham said you know we don't we can let
[22:35] our conditions get in our way and here
[22:39] they here they are and you know he says
[22:41] what will Schloss won't send it out into
[22:43] the deep and he says then why don't you
[22:47] cast your nets into the water you know
[22:52] that was a that's a very striking thing
[22:55] that for a man that's already fished all
[22:57] night he smokes know how to fish that's
[23:00] all he's ever done this fish he spits
[23:03] those waters he knows what he's doing
[23:07] but you know there was something about
[23:10] Jesus now did you know Peter had heard
[23:15] that about the Messiah but this is the
[23:19] first time that he came face to face
[23:21] with the Word made flesh
[23:26] and you know he was in this boat and he
[23:29] said you know I've heard all these
[23:30] things about this man but you know this
[23:32] was an hit hurting preach but this was
[23:35] this first interaction this was the
[23:37] first time they had an interaction with
[23:39] him and you know he went out there and
[23:43] you know he said he said Lord we fished
[23:45] all night and we ain't got nothing we've
[23:49] been down this road I know what I'm
[23:51] doing and it you know we see all this
[23:57] and he says but you know what he said
[23:59] nevertheless of all the things that I've
[24:01] seen and all my experiences and all that
[24:04] I've been through because you said that
[24:07] I'm gonna take you at your word
[24:10] I'm gonna take you at your word and I'm
[24:12] gonna throw this net in that I've done
[24:14] up ten times already but I'm gonna throw
[24:18] it in one more time which is the thing
[24:21] is is it's we can do things and you know
[24:24] like brother Dale was saying you know
[24:26] you can sit and you can pray and you can
[24:28] pray and you can pray and you never get
[24:30] anywhere and it just becomes a
[24:33] repetition or you sit and you read a
[24:35] book or you read the Bible to your eyes
[24:37] cross you read stuff you listen to
[24:41] something you don't even know what
[24:42] you're listening to you get zoned out on
[24:47] it but in all in the midst of all of
[24:52] that God will come and speak to you how
[24:59] many times have you been listening to
[25:00] something and you're not even really
[25:01] listening and something will catch your
[25:03] attention and you look like what but you
[25:08] hear he was coming to see Jesus the
[25:11] first here's Peter pulling those nets in
[25:14] and here they are trying to pull though
[25:16] all those fishing in it see he had heard
[25:20] all about Jesus but when he come
[25:22] face-to-face with him then he said Lord
[25:24] the part from me he said because I'm a
[25:26] sinful man he said I can't be in your
[25:28] presence
[25:29] he had a life-changing experience just
[25:32] by that one miracle
[25:38] you know many times people have seen
[25:40] many things take place in their lives
[25:42] but you know have we come to a place
[25:44] where it where it's been a life-changing
[25:45] experience as it changed has it changed
[25:50] your life
[25:52] because many people any people have seen
[25:55] many things but did it change your life
[25:58] you know many people say I've had a I
[26:01] got a revelation from God I got a
[26:03] revelation from God let me tell you
[26:04] something you ever get a revelation from
[26:06] God it's a life-changing experience
[26:09] that's it changes your life you because
[26:13] you know when brother Brendan wouldn't
[26:14] be on the curtain of time you know he
[26:16] come back and he said I can never be the
[26:18] same brother branham again one because
[26:20] it changed his whole outlook on life
[26:23] when he went to when he went beyond and
[26:26] seen the depths of hell when he went
[26:28] beyond and seen this in the fifth
[26:29] dimension and saw those things and came
[26:31] back you know it changed his life
[26:33] because he said don't ever go there you
[26:36] know it changed because he said nobody
[26:39] should go there he said you know it was
[26:42] his determination to make sure nobody
[26:44] had to go there but he said he said you
[26:48] know when you when you look beyond the
[26:49] curtain of time he said you can't
[26:51] describe it he said you can't put into
[26:54] words he said you can't think how great
[26:56] it is how sublime he said the words
[26:59] don't eat you he said there wasn't even
[27:01] words in the in the human vocabulary to
[27:04] explain how great it is and that's the
[27:10] way it is if you have a life-changing
[27:12] experience you know what it changes it
[27:15] changes everything about you you can't
[27:18] be the same person and that's what
[27:22] that's what we need to have is a
[27:24] life-changing experience you know we go
[27:29] back and look at you know Peter he had
[27:32] he had a lot of ups and downs in his
[27:34] lives he had some great great moments
[27:37] and you know all you look at all the
[27:40] thing every time Jesus done many great
[27:42] miracles and great things you know Peter
[27:44] was there you know Peter was there
[27:49] you know a lot of the different miracles
[27:52] took place when he preached the Sermon
[27:54] on the Mount you know all these
[27:56] different things Peters they are seeing
[27:57] all these things and you know he had a
[28:02] head of faith that he that he believed
[28:05] what Jesus said even even when Jesus
[28:07] told him of what he was what what he
[28:10] would do he didn't you know
[28:13] hey no no I believe this I got faith I
[28:16] believe you I got you back they said no
[28:20] he said listen you'll deny me even and
[28:24] all the things that but you know Peter
[28:26] had it had a faith and he believed and
[28:29] he walked in it and you know the same
[28:34] thing with you and I we need to have a
[28:36] faith have a revelation of God having
[28:41] experience
[28:49] brother Branham says this is a as I was
[28:54] saying earlier this is from taking God
[28:57] at His Word he said no no Peter was just
[29:01] not an ordinary fellow fished one or two
[29:03] nights he note all the signs of fishing
[29:05] just how the moon's supposed to be just
[29:07] how the waters are and they'd fished all
[29:10] night long and take enough and now just
[29:12] think here it is I want you to get it
[29:14] see they fished all night and taken
[29:15] nothing yeah Jesus told them to go
[29:17] straight back to where they'd be fishing
[29:20] and drop the net and they'd get a whole
[29:24] draw to fish now if they had just fished
[29:27] through that water an hour before hour
[29:30] after hour all night long and that take
[29:32] and had not taken even one fish how in
[29:36] the world are you going to drop the net
[29:38] down and get a whole bunch of fishes
[29:40] they're just not running it just looks
[29:42] don't even look reasonable sensible the
[29:45] Peter said to him here's what is Lord
[29:48] we've seen all night and taken nothing
[29:51] nevertheless that's the word I'm going
[29:53] to let that net down the net there you
[29:55] are is taking God at His Word not what
[29:58] you feel or taste or what this says or
[30:01] that says it's taking God at his
[30:03] word by word Lord I'm going to let down
[30:06] the net I don't know how you're going to
[30:09] be there but if you if there wasn't any
[30:13] there and Peter let down the net with
[30:15] faith believing that God would fulfill
[30:17] his word faith will put some there and
[30:20] it did do it it did do it fish was there
[30:27] so it's better it's by your faith you
[30:36] know brother Brown said that if if God
[30:39] was here you know if you have a need the
[30:43] the needs already been supplied it's
[30:44] already been met you know if he said if
[30:47] he was standing here tonight and you
[30:49] needed if you needed healing he said he
[30:51] couldn't do it
[30:52] they said it's already been fulfilled he
[30:54] said it's already there for you they
[30:57] said but you have to accept it that it's
[30:59] for you you know when when he was
[31:04] talking about the when faith and hope
[31:08] and charity you know brother I'm said
[31:11] talking about hope you know hope
[31:14] believes that something's going to take
[31:16] place but it looks in the season a long
[31:20] range you know it'll take place it'll
[31:23] take place
[31:23] he said faiths not that way he said
[31:26] faith already sees it he not looking off
[31:29] you know God will God will heal me but
[31:32] I'm looking for it in the in the future
[31:35] I know it's going to take place but he
[31:38] said if you got faith you already know
[31:39] you're healed
[31:40] it's I'm healed I'm not waiting for
[31:43] something take place I'm healed and
[31:48] that's how we know now we know that it's
[31:51] a finished work and then we can believe
[31:55] that that's been done but you know we
[32:02] have to take the things that we don't
[32:09] look at our own situations or our
[32:11] problems but we look at God's Word
[32:15] you know it's just like when you're
[32:20] looking and Peter's life you know and
[32:23] you know you get sometimes you get
[32:25] caught up and things just like you know
[32:27] he was walking along one day and there
[32:30] was a big crowd of people around Jesus
[32:32] and they're pushing on Jesus and you
[32:34] know brother Graham said you know he's
[32:36] trying to get people to back up so Jesus
[32:37] could get through the multitude and and
[32:39] you know and and you know and in the
[32:42] midst of all this you we don't see the
[32:45] things that are taking place because you
[32:47] know we just get in our own little world
[32:48] and here goes Peter walking down through
[32:50] there and and you know and you know
[32:53] there's crowds of people all around
[32:54] Jesus crowding him and you know Jesus
[32:58] said who touched me well you know
[33:01] Peter's the one that turn around said
[33:02] Lord everybody's touching you what you
[33:07] mean who touched you the question is who
[33:10] didn't touch you who didn't touch you
[33:14] but you know Jesus said there was a
[33:16] special kind of touch he said because
[33:19] I've seen I perceive virtues left from
[33:21] me
[33:23] you know sometimes we get in our own
[33:26] little worlds like you know we don't see
[33:28] the things that are taking place but you
[33:29] know there it was that that Peter was
[33:32] walking in and you know that woman she
[33:34] had faith to believe you know all she
[33:38] had to do was touch the hem of His
[33:39] garment that she could get what she
[33:42] needed and you know you know brother
[33:45] Graham said that you know she had to
[33:46] press through the crowd to get what she
[33:48] wanted she had to get there you know
[33:52] there was something that she had to do
[33:54] you know she hadn't you know wasted
[33:57] there you know used up everything that
[33:58] she had not gotten any better she had
[34:00] went through everything but she had come
[34:03] to the one that could give it to her and
[34:06] she pressed through that crowd and I'm
[34:10] sure there was a lot of people in that
[34:11] crowd didn't even see her she was not
[34:13] even that stood out to anybody but she
[34:18] had a need and when she pressed through
[34:20] you know Jesus was the one that
[34:23] identified her you know because he knew
[34:26] that she had had faith to believe what
[34:29] she
[34:29] to get what she needed you know he was
[34:31] the one identified her and told her she
[34:33] was made whole because of her faith and
[34:36] you know it's not that you know it has
[34:40] to be some some great things but you
[34:44] know brother Brown said you know we just
[34:45] need to have childlike faith just a
[34:49] childlike trust if we can just have that
[34:52] kind of faith you know you know you know
[35:03] I've worked I've worked in in
[35:04] maintenance and done you know this kind
[35:07] of worked for you know several years and
[35:09] you know when when Levi was little you
[35:11] know Levon he always told everybody that
[35:15] he's a fixer and he didn't it didn't
[35:19] matter what it was I could weld plastic
[35:22] or you know I mean whatever it didn't
[35:24] matter I mean I can I move mountains cuz
[35:26] I'm a fixer
[35:27] and he just brought anything to me and
[35:30] he just was like well honey that's broke
[35:32] and so was alright daddy will fix it
[35:34] they didn't he didn't matter what it was
[35:36] he think he could turn back time and do
[35:38] whatever you know well because he had he
[35:42] had confidence in right now whatever
[35:45] whatever it was I was a fixer and I
[35:47] could fix it just give it to Daddy you
[35:51] know Adam s way you know he was the same
[35:54] way you know they look at you and they
[35:55] and they see that they you know it's
[35:58] really it's a job but you're late they
[36:02] think they think it's you know almost
[36:03] like superpowers yeah I mean they look
[36:08] at you know the things that you can do
[36:09] they just think that's just I mean you
[36:12] know when you when you mess with things
[36:13] that are electrical and things like that
[36:15] new things don't work and all of a
[36:16] sudden you can make them happen I mean
[36:18] they just think that's just rocket
[36:21] science you know and you know and they
[36:25] say well we'll just give it to daddy
[36:27] daddy I'll take care of it
[36:30] but you know you know if we can have
[36:32] that same kind of confidence you know
[36:38] you know brother Brown was talking about
[36:40] you know God came out and you know he
[36:43] step
[36:43] that'll nothing he stepped out on his
[36:47] own word and began to speak his own word
[36:50] and he said he believed his own word he
[36:54] spoke it and he believed it and it come
[36:56] to pass he said what's your standing on
[36:59] he said you know that everything that
[37:02] here he said the earth was materialized
[37:06] because of his word he said your body
[37:10] was materialized because of his word all
[37:13] of the planets all of the things that we
[37:17] see you know read I was talking about
[37:20] he said you look in the in the the sky
[37:22] and see a hundred and twenty million
[37:25] years of light space and he said he
[37:28] created all of it and he said it all in
[37:31] order and all of it works just exactly
[37:33] the way he called it to he said it in
[37:37] order and you know they're still here
[37:40] you know looking back in history and can
[37:42] tell exactly when the stars moved when
[37:46] they lined up and they can go into the
[37:48] history I mean into the future and tell
[37:50] you when things are going to line up and
[37:51] when things are going to happen why
[37:53] because it's so perfect and the way it's
[37:55] set up and you know what he was the one
[38:00] that spoke all of that and he spoke your
[38:02] body but you know what not only did he
[38:05] speak that he also spoke to your life
[38:07] and he also spoke eternal life and if he
[38:13] spoke that then you know what he he's
[38:15] mindful of you he does there's nothing
[38:18] that's going to take him by surprise
[38:19] there's there's nothing that's going to
[38:21] stop him and yet again sometimes you
[38:26] know we get we get in a mindset that we
[38:29] wonder if God knows where we're at you
[38:34] know because the devil likes to talk to
[38:35] you and tries to put you someplace else
[38:38] where you're not but you know it's just
[38:43] like when when the disciples and then
[38:45] we're on to own the ship and you know
[38:47] Jesus had left and they had they had got
[38:49] on this ship and was out on the only sea
[38:52] by themselves
[38:55] you know that here they are you know
[38:57] they're out there floating in a storm
[38:59] all by themselves and you know what they
[39:01] don't have anybody but you know what
[39:02] Jesus knew exactly where they were he
[39:06] knew their exact condition and you know
[39:10] he didn't well he didn't know wait till
[39:12] it just started the wind started blowing
[39:14] and the water started getting a little
[39:16] choppy yeah he didn't come with the
[39:19] water just when it just started raining
[39:23] you know the Bible says you know it was
[39:25] a violent storm that came upon them to
[39:28] the place that it almost sunk the ship
[39:32] and here comes Jesus walking on the
[39:36] water
[39:38] you know they almost give up hope but
[39:41] you know what Jesus knew exactly where
[39:43] they were he knew exactly when to come
[39:47] wait he's just right on time in the
[39:51] midst of all this stormy sea and you
[39:54] know they were scared when they seen
[39:56] somebody coming on the water but you
[40:01] know he spoke to him and said peace be
[40:02] still you know don't be afraid that's me
[40:07] and you know Peter said Lord if that's
[40:09] you then let me walk on the water let me
[40:13] then bid me to come to you that's it
[40:20] that's it doesn't matter that's a man
[40:21] with faith let me tell you what we were
[40:26] we were in oh we were on a cruise ship I
[40:28] don't know how many people's been on a
[40:30] cruise ship but you know we're in the
[40:31] middle the ocean you can't find any land
[40:33] anywhere around you and they tell you
[40:36] that the bottom of the ocean where
[40:38] you're at so ver two miles deep it's a
[40:41] lot of water let me tell you what I
[40:44] didn't have no faith to walk on the
[40:46] water
[40:48] but you know I said I'll turn I looked
[40:50] at in all that distance and all that
[40:52] water looking out through there and I
[40:54] was like you know Peter have faith to
[40:58] believe he could walk on there and you
[41:02] know Jesus told him to come come on and
[41:06] walk on the water
[41:09] and he did walk on the water as long as
[41:11] he had faith you know as long as he he
[41:15] kept his eyes on Jesus he could do that
[41:18] he could do a miracle and sometimes
[41:23] sometimes we look at our lives and you
[41:25] know sometimes we go back and we think
[41:27] you know we've seen God moving our lives
[41:29] you know I still tell people at work you
[41:36] know I got I got a job
[41:39] God gave me a job and I got and I got
[41:44] over a lot of other people I ain't the
[41:49] smartest I ain't the most experienced
[41:53] ain't the best-looking is that tolling
[41:59] when are you going you're gonna agree to
[42:00] no but you know I love all those things
[42:05] but you know what God opened the doors
[42:08] for me you know when when there were so
[42:13] many other people that that could have
[42:15] got those jobs and people are saying you
[42:17] know I'm being hurtful I turned it I
[42:22] turned in my resume just like everybody
[42:24] else did I talked to people just like
[42:26] just like everybody else did but you
[42:30] know what I was the only one they got
[42:31] called and they told me go take them you
[42:36] know another people's taking the test
[42:38] everything I took it but you know I was
[42:43] the one in one week from the time I took
[42:46] I turned everything in took the test in
[42:50] one week had an interview in the same
[42:52] week and got a job all in a period of
[42:56] five days you know we got we got people
[43:01] you know they turn in resumes months
[43:05] weeks sometimes it takes a long time for
[43:10] people to get around anybody ever worked
[43:14] in a business knows human resources
[43:15] ain't the fastest group of people but
[43:20] you know I
[43:22] I tell people you know he took me one
[43:24] week they had my resume and went and
[43:26] talked to him to test interview had a
[43:29] job on one week in a five-day period I
[43:34] said people always say it's not what you
[43:37] know it's who you know I tell them I
[43:42] said I know I know though I know the one
[43:45] I know the one person that you need to
[43:47] know there's only one person that you
[43:53] need to know you know I've had jobs
[43:58] where we've tried to we've tried to find
[44:00] equipment and everybody else has looked
[44:03] for them looked high and low looked all
[44:05] through places and you know I've stood
[44:06] in the doorway enough and I've prayed to
[44:08] God and I said God we need you know we
[44:10] need to find this and you're the only
[44:12] one that knows where it's at and and
[44:15] something just comes to me and comes
[44:19] right in my mind and tells me exactly
[44:20] where to go and I walk right there and
[44:23] people have walked and looked at all
[44:26] over the place right over the top of it
[44:29] and won't write up to it and there it be
[44:34] I've been I've been on jobs where we've
[44:37] tried to figure stuff out and nobody
[44:39] seems to be able to figure out where all
[44:40] scratching our head ready to pull her
[44:41] hair out what if you got any hair to
[44:43] pull out but you know what pray to God
[44:47] and he'd come on the scene and give you
[44:49] the answer even and people say well you
[44:53] know it's just minor things listen gods
[44:55] gods in the end the big things gods in
[44:57] the little things you know I tell people
[45:02] everybody asked me how long arms doing I
[45:04] tell them I'm it's doing great you know
[45:08] I tell people that work I don't know why
[45:10] I broke my arm but you know what the
[45:11] Bible says that all things work together
[45:13] for the good to them that love the Lord
[45:14] I don't know why but you know what it
[45:17] works out for my good hey you know what
[45:23] you know you know sure I wish I had too
[45:26] broke it but you know what in the end I
[45:29] know it works out I don't know what what
[45:31] a benefits for me but you know what I
[45:34] know God has it all in control
[45:36] but you're not witness to people all the
[45:39] time about my arm and you know I still I
[45:41] still tell people and I still have the
[45:43] thought and I'm still I still believe
[45:46] you know people ask me I'll look if you
[45:48] look at my arms they're not exactly
[45:50] straight but you know I still have that
[45:53] thought one these days I'm gonna arms
[45:55] like this right here and ones going to
[45:56] be straight as the other you know I'm
[45:59] still you know I still don't have the
[46:00] strength and this one that I had before
[46:01] but you know what I still believe I'm
[46:03] going to have the strength in this one
[46:06] why because God just don't start
[46:08] something and he just doesn't finish it
[46:10] I still believe that there's the healing
[46:13] power of God I'm still waiting for it to
[46:15] be manifested but you know what I wake
[46:17] up every day because you know what it
[46:18] when you can't move your arm when you
[46:22] can't use it when you get something
[46:25] thank God I can use my arm you know we
[46:30] we can be thankful because you know
[46:32] sometimes you know what we get in our
[46:33] own little will you get on it just how
[46:36] about me but you you're getting your own
[46:39] little world sometimes as the devil
[46:40] talks to you and boy you just you just
[46:42] get sit down and you know you just it
[46:44] just oh you just just this great big
[46:48] tormal of things and you know what it's
[46:52] when that's when God can come by and
[46:54] speak to you and tell you and show you
[46:56] things you know if you just sit down and
[46:58] look look think and look back to what
[47:01] God's done for you where God's brought
[47:03] you to you know if God didn't ever do
[47:05] anything else to make you know I I can't
[47:08] praise Him enough for what he's already
[47:09] done for me I can't praise Him enough
[47:13] for what he's already done for me well
[47:18] because he didn't have to do what he's
[47:20] already done but you know I thank God
[47:23] for that
[47:24] that His grace has been bestowed upon me
[47:27] that I've reached and received what I've
[47:30] received I wish you know you know so
[47:36] many people that you meet that you know
[47:38] they just don't have you know even
[47:40] though you know you have so many great
[47:43] things in their lives and everything can
[47:45] be going well but you know what they
[47:46] can't fight they can't find anything to
[47:48] be happy about they can't find anything
[47:50] that's worth looking and and you know
[47:53] and having been happy about our funny
[47:55] thing that's going right in their life
[47:56] and you know there's some people you
[47:58] know that their everything is going
[48:00] wrong and they don't look like they have
[48:01] anything and their life that's going
[48:03] right for me you know what they're the
[48:05] happiest people in the world you know
[48:08] Brennan says you know there's some
[48:09] people you know they said you just can't
[48:10] stand to be around they said you know
[48:13] they're so negative and they're so down
[48:15] in the mouth and everything like that he
[48:17] said you never wait he said there might
[48:18] be nice people he said but you don't
[48:19] want to be around them but you know he
[48:24] said there's people that you just love
[48:25] to be around yeah
[48:29] why because there's just something about
[48:33] them that draws you to one you know
[48:37] there's people that you know that if you
[48:40] have the right mental attitude if you
[48:42] have the right things in your life and
[48:44] you see God working in your life and you
[48:47] can just thank God and walk in that and
[48:50] see what God's done and know that God's
[48:53] going to do it you know if even if you
[48:59] just look back you know if you look and
[49:03] see what God has done and what God's
[49:05] going to do if he's done one thing in
[49:07] the past he'll do something he'll do
[49:09] what he's promised that he'll do you
[49:13] know there's many people that you know
[49:15] that they don't see what God has done
[49:17] they don't see what God has for them you
[49:23] know in the in the scripture we look
[49:24] back and you know you see the the two
[49:29] that we're going to Emmaus you know here
[49:34] here these here these are you know they
[49:36] Cleo person is in his friends you know
[49:38] they have walk with Jesus they knew
[49:40] about Jesus ministry they knew all these
[49:42] things and you know the other thing that
[49:46] they knew that Jesus had said he said
[49:49] you know tear this temple down in three
[49:50] days I'll rise I'll raise it up again he
[49:54] said you know he said that you know the
[49:56] Son of man will fall in the sinful hands
[49:59] then he said you know this is the type
[50:00] of death that our that I'll have to die
[50:04] but you he's you know he told him all
[50:05] these things but you know he said I'm
[50:07] gonna raise again
[50:09] he said one because he said the
[50:11] scripture spoke of me that this is going
[50:16] to take place but you know brother
[50:18] Branham said you know he said the
[50:20] disciples were sad because when they saw
[50:24] that Jesus had been crucified and died
[50:27] and was buried you know that's where
[50:29] they had their faith that's all that
[50:31] they had in their mind on was what had
[50:33] taken place and they could just see a
[50:36] tomb they could see it too but they
[50:40] couldn't see the resurrection even after
[50:43] all that Jesus had done raised raised
[50:45] the dead and and healed the sick and and
[50:48] fed and fed the multitudes all the
[50:52] things that he had done all the things
[50:55] that he had done and they sing that tune
[50:59] you know Peter Peter decided that he was
[51:03] going to go back fishing he went right
[51:08] back to where Jesus druing from but you
[51:12] know here comes here comes Cleophus and
[51:14] his friend and they're just walking
[51:15] along your brother I said they would
[51:19] just said I'm a walk I won't do like
[51:25] everybody else brother Dale wait brother
[51:27] weeks I like to walk down the aisle son
[51:30] but you know they're all sad I think you
[51:34] know they had to they were so sad they
[51:37] had to look up to see bottom and when
[51:42] Jesus stepped out to talk to him they
[51:45] were so sad are you a stranger don't you
[51:50] know what's been going on no if I was if
[51:55] that's if I if if that's not a pitiful
[51:57] testimony
[51:59] yeah we knew Jesus and he was he was
[52:04] wonderful he was powerful we thought we
[52:07] thought he'd fulfill the scripture man
[52:10] we singing him do great things all these
[52:14] things that Jesus said but jesus said
[52:17] I'm the resurrection and the life but I
[52:18] don't remember any of that
[52:21] I'm just looking at this tomb over here
[52:24] and I'm going back just going back to
[52:30] Emmaus and Jesus tries to talk to him
[52:35] you know they got such a pitiful
[52:36] testimony now they talk about all the
[52:39] things that he had done in the past and
[52:44] they even said and this is the third day
[52:48] well you know what he had done all these
[52:50] miracles in the past and he prophesied
[52:52] of what was going to take place and he
[52:54] said on the third day I'm gonna rise out
[52:56] of this but you know what they didn't
[52:59] remember know that no they just said and
[53:00] they just looked at a tomb a sealed tomb
[53:04] and that's all I saw their testimony was
[53:09] but you know what Jesus came in their
[53:11] midst and you know they were talking
[53:13] about Jesus and he walked into their
[53:15] myths but you know what they didn't see
[53:17] the president they gospel they didn't
[53:19] see the present day ministry standing
[53:22] there and he said old old fools and slow
[53:25] of hearts well here's what here's the
[53:28] scripture and you know and then he began
[53:30] at Moses and he began to expound the
[53:32] scriptures while he was standing there
[53:34] the Word made flesh was standing in
[53:36] front of them and he was trying to
[53:38] expound it to him and they were still
[53:39] blinded by it
[53:41] hey brother Branham said it's the same
[53:43] way today he said why they don't see the
[53:46] message they don't see the word and here
[53:49] he is in the present day and give a the
[53:51] people don't see it and here he is
[53:56] trying to expound - and he took him all
[54:00] day all day he he ministered to him
[54:05] didn't see anything
[54:09] but you know what when it came evening
[54:12] time you know he decided you know act
[54:15] like he was gonna go on you know they
[54:17] wanted him to stay so he stayed you know
[54:20] they saw something take place and the
[54:24] breaking of the bread
[54:25] at evening time then then they saw who
[54:29] was in their meats and he walked you
[54:33] know then he disappear for them but they
[54:34] were able to and they said did not our
[54:36] hearts burn within us as he spoke to us
[54:38] along the way but they did not see what
[54:42] was taking place and it's the same way
[54:46] today people don't see what's taking
[54:48] place and you know Peter went back and
[54:55] was fishing went back to go fishing and
[55:02] you know the he was all sad and you know
[55:07] all lonely and blue all the things that
[55:11] he had went through but you you know
[55:18] Jesus was when he rose from the dead and
[55:21] he told Mary you know he told him said
[55:25] tell my disciples and Peter said I'll
[55:28] see you in and Galilee this is John
[55:33] chapter 21 and verse 1 said after these
[55:42] things Jesus showed himself again to the
[55:44] disciples at the sea of Tiberias and on
[55:47] the Y's showed he himself there were
[55:50] together Simon Peter and Thomas called
[55:52] didymus and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee
[55:55] and the sons of Zebedee and two others
[55:57] of his disciple Simon Peter said unto he
[56:00] unto them I go a-fishing they said unto
[56:02] Him we also go with thee they went forth
[56:07] and entered into a ship it immediately
[56:09] and that night they caught nothing but
[56:10] when the morning was now come Jesus
[56:13] stood on the shore but the disciples
[56:14] knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus
[56:17] said unto them children have you any
[56:20] meat they answered him no and he said
[56:23] under the
[56:23] cast the net on the right side of the
[56:25] ship and he shall find
[56:27] they cast therefore and now they were
[56:31] not able to draw it for the multitude of
[56:32] fish is therefore that disciple whom
[56:34] Jesus loves saith unto Peter it is the
[56:37] Lord now when Simon Peter heard this the
[56:40] Lord he Girt his Fisher's coat on him
[56:42] for he was naked and he did cast himself
[56:44] into the sea and the other disciples
[56:46] came in a little ship for they were not
[56:49] far from land but as it were two hundred
[56:52] cubics driving dragging the nets with
[56:55] fishes and as soon as then as they were
[56:57] come to land they saw a fire of coals
[57:00] there and fish laid their own and bread
[57:03] and jesus said unto them bring of the
[57:05] fish which you have now called Simon
[57:10] Peter went up and drew the net to land
[57:11] full of great fish is one hundred and
[57:13] fifty and three and all for all there
[57:17] were so many yet was the net not the net
[57:21] broken jesus said unto them coming down
[57:23] and none of the disciples Durst ask him
[57:26] who art thou knowing that it was the
[57:28] Lord then said then Jesus then cometh
[57:32] and taketh bread and give them and fish
[57:34] likewise this is now the third time that
[57:37] Jesus showed himself to his disciples
[57:39] after that he was risen from the dead
[57:41] and that's what's so amazing is this was
[57:45] the third time that Peter is seeing
[57:46] Jesus raised from the dead and when they
[57:51] had dined jesus said unto Simon Peter
[57:53] Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more
[57:55] than these
[57:57] he saith unto Him yea Lord thou knowest
[58:00] that I love thee he saith unto Him feed
[58:04] my lambs he saith to him again the
[58:07] second time Simon son of Jonas lovest
[58:10] thou me he saith unto Him yea Lord thou
[58:13] knowest that I love thee he saith unto
[58:16] Him feed my sheep he saith unto him the
[58:20] third time Simon son of Jonas lovest
[58:22] thou me Peter was grieved because he
[58:25] said unto him the third time lovest thou
[58:27] me and he said unto Him Lord thou
[58:29] knowest all things thou knowest that I
[58:32] love thee jesus said unto Him feed my
[58:34] sheep
[58:38] you know the first time when they went
[58:41] out to catch fish Peter told the Lord
[58:45] said Lord we fished all night we caught
[58:48] nothing but you know the second time he
[58:53] didn't do that the second time when
[58:56] Jesus told him to cast the net they just
[58:59] threw the Nets out but you know he went
[59:02] back to doing what God called him from
[59:06] but you know Jesus said there and said
[59:08] Peter do you love me you know Peter
[59:14] thought he was a failure he denied the
[59:17] Lord and although and you know and you
[59:20] know that's the reason in the scripture
[59:23] you know it says tell the disciples and
[59:26] Peter because Jesus wanted Peter to know
[59:29] he was loved right and you know even
[59:33] even in our faults and failures even we
[59:36] don't think God will bring to take us
[59:37] back but you know what God takes us back
[59:42] but you know he stood there he said
[59:44] Peter do you love me
[59:47] they said Lord I love you
[59:49] he said feed my sheep feed my sheep
[59:54] why because Jesus wanted Peter to know
[59:58] he said he said you know Satan has
[1:00:00] desired to sift you and all these things
[1:00:03] but you know he said after you're
[1:00:04] converted strengthen the Brethren but
[1:00:07] you know Hegel's want Peter to know
[1:00:09] Peter you have a ministry there's
[1:00:12] something for you to do don't let your
[1:00:15] past failures hold you back whatever it
[1:00:21] is don't sit there and say well Lord I
[1:00:23] fished all night and I haven't called
[1:00:25] anything though that net in Lord I don't
[1:00:30] know if you'll meet my needs throw your
[1:00:32] net in whatever it is that you're
[1:00:35] looking for throw your net in whatever
[1:00:39] it is one because Jesus wants to speak
[1:00:42] to each one of us the same way he has a
[1:00:45] word for each one of us you know what
[1:00:47] not over one of us can preach
[1:00:49] or or do whatever not everybody is
[1:00:52] singers not everybody's a musician or
[1:00:54] whatever it is but you know what God has
[1:00:56] a job for you job God called you and and
[1:01:00] he has something special for getting
[1:01:02] made you special for a reason maybe you
[1:01:08] know some people say well I can't do a
[1:01:10] lot I've heard people say I can't do a
[1:01:13] lot but I can pray let me tell you what
[1:01:16] that is a big job if you can pray that's
[1:01:20] a big job let me tell you what there's a
[1:01:24] there's a there was a time that there
[1:01:26] was people called prayer warriors I
[1:01:28] don't know if there's anybody like that
[1:01:29] anymore or not but you know what that's
[1:01:33] something that needed to be taken that
[1:01:34] really that really is a need whatever it
[1:01:40] is that you can do you can be alike to
[1:01:44] so many people you know we we think we
[1:01:49] can't be used of God you know the devil
[1:01:58] will beat us up and you know make you
[1:02:02] feel like you're lower than anything and
[1:02:05] but you know what people you know what
[1:02:09] people have needs they know who to come
[1:02:11] to people people may disagree with you
[1:02:16] people may not like you people may not
[1:02:18] like what you believe people may make
[1:02:19] fun of what you believe but you know
[1:02:21] what there's people when they have needs
[1:02:23] they know who to come to for prayer so
[1:02:28] whatever you have need of you you just
[1:02:29] be what God wants you to be and don't
[1:02:33] worry about what everybody else is doing
[1:02:35] and what everybody else has been called
[1:02:37] to do because you know at the end of at
[1:02:41] the end of the journey you know what
[1:02:44] God's not going to ask you God doesn't
[1:02:47] compare us to anybody else he wants to
[1:02:48] know if we're faithful to what he called
[1:02:51] us to do that's all I saw he's looking
[1:02:55] for is us to be faithful to what our job
[1:02:58] is and if we can do that then we can be
[1:03:02] blessed
[1:03:03] that's all I want to be I just want to
[1:03:06] be used of God in the and and and
[1:03:09] whatever little way that I can that I
[1:03:11] can be used but if you have if you have
[1:03:15] a need you know what there's a vast
[1:03:17] ocean out there you know brother Graham
[1:03:21] talked about that little fish no let's
[1:03:24] stand and musicians come but you know
[1:03:27] brother Brennan was talking about that
[1:03:30] little fish swimming around in the ocean
[1:03:33] saying I may have to drink sparingly you
[1:03:37] know I don't know when this is going to
[1:03:38] run out and sometimes we feel you know
[1:03:46] we can be the same way but less if you
[1:03:55] ever need to ask abundant you know they
[1:04:03] tell that little story about the minute
[1:04:04] you know you know he just he didn't he
[1:04:09] just he was just barely getting by just
[1:04:13] getting just a little bit and and this
[1:04:15] up man he was doing he was being
[1:04:16] prosperous he was doing he was doing
[1:04:19] better you know who's another man you
[1:04:21] know the first man he was a little bit
[1:04:22] jealous of the second man it's like well
[1:04:24] you know what because I have faith in
[1:04:26] that that's what I'm asking God for you
[1:04:30] know some people just pray just to
[1:04:31] supply my needs but you know what
[1:04:33] there's there's more that you can ask of
[1:04:35] God and the problem but the problem is
[1:04:39] is people want to be millionaires but
[1:04:44] you know what I believe God wants us to
[1:04:46] live comfortably you don't have to you
[1:04:50] don't have to live hand-to-mouth but I
[1:04:57] believe God has has a blessings for us
[1:05:00] and it's but it's not just material
[1:05:02] blessings but those are blessings that
[1:05:04] God has for us but you know what God I
[1:05:09] believe God wants us to be blessed in
[1:05:11] every area of our life
[1:05:14] whatever you have need of God will bless
[1:05:16] you in it so god bless you tonight
