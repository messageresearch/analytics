[30:06] you this morning it's a real privilege
[30:09] to always be amongst God's children my
[30:15] brothers and sisters in the Lord I don't
[30:19] need to introduce myself to you y'all
[30:21] know me God bless you I'd like to get
[30:23] right into the message if I could you
[30:27] know I'm not known to be long-winded I
[30:29] know I say that but who knows what'll
[30:31] happen this morning I've been preaching
[30:34] on well I you know we use the word
[30:38] series I don't really know if that's the
[30:40] correct word or not because God's Word
[30:42] doesn't have any beginning it doesn't
[30:45] have an end so it's really not a series
[30:49] it's just a continuation and I've been
[30:55] preaching on the conflict between God
[30:58] and Satan at home and I just thought
[31:00] maybe cuz I feel like I'm at home I just
[31:03] kind of continue on I'll do a little
[31:05] background so that you get the gist of
[31:08] where I'm going and and if you take your
[31:11] Bibles while you're standing I want you
[31:12] to turn to the book of James if you
[31:15] would I do have my own glasses this
[31:21] morning so we're a good good shape James
[31:25] chapter one I'll just read verse 17 and
[31:29] when you have it say Amen
[31:31] of course I bring greetings from the the
[31:34] believers and in northern Arizona and my
[31:37] wife also she just couldn't travel with
[31:39] me this time but we'll be back in about
[31:41] five and a half weeks looking forward to
[31:44] it
[31:45] amen you love the Lord alright James
[31:50] 1:17 every good gift and every perfect
[31:54] gift is from above and cometh down from
[31:58] the Father of lights with whom is no
[32:02] variableness neither shadow of turning
[32:07] let's pray father we thank you for the
[32:09] reading of your word Lord we wear
[32:11] depending upon your father worried
[32:14] lying on you completely and totally this
[32:16] morning Lord for you to reveal yourself
[32:20] to us father and by that we are given to
[32:24] understand Lord that we will also come
[32:27] to a conclusion of who we are help us
[32:32] this morning lord I pray bless your
[32:34] children and their efforts father
[32:36] wherever and whomever they are for your
[32:40] honor and your glory and the precious
[32:42] name of Jesus Christ we pray and God's
[32:45] children said amen
[32:47] god bless you may be seated now of
[32:50] course I want to thank brother Samuel
[32:53] for having the confidence in me to let
[32:56] me come and minister to you even though
[32:58] he's not here
[33:00] really really deemed that a high honor
[33:03] so now you know I preached under
[33:09] inspiration so I'll just have to kind of
[33:11] feel in the direction I'm going to go
[33:13] this morning but this is this is part of
[33:17] like the greatest battle ever fought and
[33:19] and whether you know it or not or
[33:21] whether you like it or not we're in a
[33:24] fight this morning did you know that
[33:27] it's not all peaches and cream it's a
[33:32] battle it's a battle for the young and
[33:34] the old for the free in the bond for the
[33:36] male and the female it's a battle it's a
[33:39] battle for the believer the make
[33:40] believer in the unbeliever it's a battle
[33:44] we're in it this morning but in in in in
[33:48] God beginning to deal with me on this I
[33:50] thought to myself because of things that
[33:53] are going on around us and in our ranks
[33:55] and of course brothers and sisters you
[33:57] know that when we're preaching to to
[34:01] those of like faith you you you you
[34:05] understand that that the denomination is
[34:08] somewhere way out there on their own but
[34:15] the spirit that caused that denomination
[34:19] it's trying to work in this house this
[34:22] morning
[34:23] that's the conflict now now III I'll
[34:27] start it out like this so you can see
[34:29] where I'm going with this and I'm
[34:30] relaxed I'll take my time that I I the
[34:34] Lord was dealing with me on it and I and
[34:36] I looked at the title the conflict
[34:38] between God and Satan that brother
[34:40] branham priest and I said to myself III
[34:43] believe that I said but it doesn't it
[34:46] doesn't lord help me to understand it
[34:49] because I just I just can't see God as
[34:52] conflicted how can there be a conflict
[34:57] between God and Satan when God is
[35:01] supreme he's the king he's the creator
[35:04] he is everything that there is I mean we
[35:08] wait list let's listen say Smacks we
[35:10] know that Satan is not going to beat God
[35:14] at anything but Satan wants us to think
[35:19] that he's beating God at everything
[35:25] that's that's that's this that's this
[35:27] way of working but then God inspired
[35:30] brother Branham to preach on this and
[35:33] give this a title the conflict between
[35:35] God and say and I said lord help me and
[35:38] as I began to study and preach on it he
[35:40] began to open it up to me and so I'm
[35:42] going to use it like this I'm gonna say
[35:44] that the piano here is God it's not but
[35:49] I just and I'd ask a brother and two
[35:51] brothers to come up but and and any
[35:54] brother in here would like for me to put
[35:55] them over here and say you're the type
[35:58] of God this morning but then I've got to
[36:02] put another brother over here and say
[36:03] now you're the type of Satan this
[36:05] morning and it wouldn't go well nobody
[36:08] wants to be the bad guy
[36:10] so I'm gonna say the piano is the type
[36:13] of God and the keyboard here is the type
[36:16] of Satan you understand so I've got one
[36:18] over here and one over here okay now
[36:23] brother Branham in the message greatest
[36:26] battle ever fought tells us that of
[36:28] course Satan Lucifer chose his his his
[36:33] weapon
[36:35] and God chose his weapon God's weapon
[36:39] was the soul if you want to put it that
[36:41] way or or his his part alright
[36:45] and Satan chose the mind now they are
[36:48] very close together they are so close
[36:51] that it would deceive the very elect if
[36:54] possible and and and the devil knows
[36:58] that because he can read the Bible like
[37:00] you and me all right but we also know
[37:03] that because we also have contact with
[37:07] the Word of God so we realize brothers
[37:10] and sisters that the conflict between
[37:12] God and Satan it's not the way we think
[37:15] God and Satan are not fighting one
[37:18] another because God doesn't have to
[37:22] fight anybody but here's where the
[37:26] conflict is if that piano is God and
[37:30] that keyboard is Satan who's in between
[37:34] it it's a conflict between God and Satan
[37:43] I'm the conflict you're the conflict we
[37:49] are our own greatest enemy now for the
[37:54] sake of time I will give you Scripture
[37:56] and they can put it up on there you
[37:58] don't have to turn to it unless you want
[38:00] to but we realize that Ephesians six six
[38:03] tells us that this is not a fight
[38:05] against flesh and blood so you're not
[38:11] fighting each other
[38:13] Satan wants you to think you are Satan
[38:17] wants you to fight me he wants me to
[38:19] fight you he wants you to fight your
[38:21] neighbor he wants you to fight your your
[38:25] fellow brother or sister the next-of-kin
[38:28] the people you work with he especially
[38:32] would like you to fight with the people
[38:33] you're driving down the highway with
[38:38] somehow that just
[38:43] and it's getting worse it's not getting
[38:46] better but but brothers and sisters that
[38:48] believer begins to realize that they're
[38:53] not fighting against the person who just
[38:56] cut them off on the road once you begin
[39:03] to realize who your enemy really is let
[39:08] me take it like this now just prior to
[39:12] God visiting brother Branham to give him
[39:18] what he needed to preach on the seven
[39:21] seals God first gave him a dream and
[39:25] that was a dream that was a large man
[39:28] and a woman and the man had a
[39:29] three-cornered stick and he was beating
[39:32] on the woman this woman was in tight
[39:34] brother branham's mother and this man
[39:37] was in tight his father it wasn't his
[39:39] mother and father we know that but so
[39:41] then he was given to understand in this
[39:43] dream that this this woman was the
[39:45] church and this man was that Trinitarian
[39:50] denominational spirit that every time
[39:53] she she began to rise up and possibly
[39:56] begin to see the wrong of this
[39:59] Trinitarian spirit in this
[40:01] denominational work he beat her down he
[40:05] beat her into unconsciousness in that
[40:10] very same night that was that was by the
[40:13] way a dream but that very same night God
[40:16] won't brother ran him up early in the
[40:17] morning and began to deal with him on
[40:21] the seals and of course he saw the
[40:22] little birds and then he saw the doves
[40:24] and l.k that's just right at the end of
[40:27] 1962 but there's a key in here you see
[40:34] God gave brother Branham a test did you
[40:39] know that he warned him when he was on
[40:42] hurricane mountain up in the eighth Iran
[40:44] back mountains they said there's going
[40:46] to be a test for you now he didn't tell
[40:49] him what it was what it was
[40:50] he just said there's a trap set so we
[40:54] know that just a
[40:55] few days later he was in some meetings
[40:57] and there was a young couple in the
[41:01] front row towards the front row that
[41:03] were we would as we would say netting
[41:07] making out or whatever they were doing
[41:09] you know they were they were crawling on
[41:12] each other and kissing on each other and
[41:14] patting each other can you imagine can
[41:19] you imagine this morning here in this in
[41:21] this congregation if there was as two
[41:23] strangers came in and sat down in the
[41:25] front row and and started messing around
[41:27] I mean everybody would be appalled
[41:30] where's the Deacons they think they're
[41:37] doing in the house of God in the
[41:39] sanctuary of God oh this is this is what
[41:43] happened and I'm saying this because the
[41:49] conflict that you and I are in has
[41:51] everything to do with this we are not
[41:54] fighting against flesh and blood it
[41:56] wasn't that couple it was the devil who
[42:02] was anointing them you see it's all
[42:05] about the spirit world but we see oh I
[42:09] can't believe they're doing that huh but
[42:15] watched the test of the greatest battle
[42:20] ever fought God told brother Branham
[42:25] they're in your hands come on if they
[42:33] were in your hands if they were in my
[42:35] hands this morning just exactly what
[42:37] would we do get them people out of here
[42:41] you're condemned do you realize what
[42:43] you're doing in the house of God but no
[42:49] brother Branham proved that morning that
[42:52] he was victorious enough to begin to be
[42:56] used by God to receive the seven seals
[43:01] he said I forgive you they weren't just
[43:05] words
[43:07] this was the man
[43:10] coming to an understanding that while
[43:14] that couple was in his hands they could
[43:18] be totally separated from God or they
[43:21] could be given an opportunity now they
[43:24] probably never took the opportunity but
[43:27] that's not up to you and me it's
[43:30] something you and me to find ourselves
[43:33] so wrapped up in God that we could look
[43:38] with these eyes at a situation that is
[43:43] unbelievable practically and say I
[43:45] forgive you he won the battle he won the
[43:53] battle that's mourning and brothers and
[43:54] sisters you and I are in the same
[43:56] conflict today whether we realize it or
[43:58] not we're so I mean I I'm preaching to
[44:02] myself now so I don't don't don't get me
[44:05] wrong
[44:05] but we're so caught up and what we see
[44:09] and we are using that sight for judgment
[44:18] and we've got to stop doing that you see
[44:24] this is a conflict between God and Satan
[44:29] but we are the conflicted not God and
[44:34] Satan thinks he's going to be able to
[44:36] pull this off by the way did you realize
[44:39] that he knows he's the underdog but he
[44:44] believes in something so strongly
[44:47] because the Bible says the devil's
[44:50] belief and brother Branham said this
[44:53] about that scripture sometimes the
[44:55] devil's got more sense than the people
[44:58] that claim to believe God because they
[45:01] tremble the devil's believe and tremble
[45:07] now the problem with the devils that
[45:11] believe is what they believe and how
[45:15] they believe it now brothers and sisters
[45:17] is III and I thought like this as I
[45:20] began in this in this
[45:22] in this group of messages that God is
[45:26] dealing with me on that we're all in
[45:28] this fight together but there's
[45:30] something very unusual about this
[45:32] conflict that is unprecedented and the
[45:38] unprecedented part of this conflict is
[45:41] this is the only battle that I can find
[45:48] where the battleground decides who the
[45:51] victor is not the two contestants think
[45:57] about the parable of the sower Matthew
[46:00] 13 the seed was the Word of God the
[46:06] sower was the son of man but the ground
[46:10] the seed fell on was going to determine
[46:15] whether it brought forth after its kind
[46:20] you with me
[46:22] so the battleground that's me that's you
[46:27] is going to determine who's going to win
[46:31] you see God is already a winner
[46:34] Satan is a loser so you and I are
[46:37] essentially being used to choose the
[46:40] side we'll be on I'm choosing God's side
[46:47] I don't care what it cost me I don't
[46:50] care what people think of me I don't
[46:52] even care what I think of myself because
[46:56] I am my own greatest enemy all right so
[47:01] you got that amen now when I get to this
[47:07] afternoon's service I'll hit the hard
[47:10] point of this because there's there's a
[47:13] part to it that that will open up to us
[47:17] if we can if I can just get through this
[47:20] part so I wrote this down to help me
[47:23] with you because I I don't get to preach
[47:27] three times a week here which is fine
[47:29] I'm just saying at home you know you can
[47:31] just take it and stop and take it and
[47:33] stop and take it and stop so I wrote
[47:36] down this morning as I was meditating if
[47:38] we're going to be victorious then we
[47:41] need to know that we are on the winning
[47:43] side now we should be convinced that
[47:48] God's side is the victorious side then I
[47:53] wrote in parentheses but some aren't
[47:56] some aren't sure of that okay and I say
[48:00] it like that because we've got things
[48:03] going on in our in our in our not use it
[48:06] like this for the sake of you knowing
[48:08] and understanding where I'm coming from
[48:10] the message realm those people on this
[48:14] planet that believe God sent a profit
[48:16] and that profit was William Marion
[48:18] Branham and they could send and
[48:21] sometimes pretend to follow the message
[48:25] all right and that's kind of you know a
[48:29] conflict that's part of what Satan's
[48:31] using because the pretenders eventually
[48:36] come to a spot in their walk with God
[48:38] and in their following of the word
[48:41] through the Bible and the message that
[48:43] wait a minute this isn't working out for
[48:45] me I thought it was supposed to be
[48:47] completely changed and I'm still poor
[48:49] Minotaur or this isn't just working out
[48:52] the way these signs shall follow them
[48:54] that believe enough I don't have any
[48:56] outward signs that I am a believer of Oh
[49:00] Satan's got you right where he wants you
[49:06] he really does now we have to overcome
[49:11] that we have to fight that I have to
[49:15] fight it and you have to fight it
[49:17] remember it's not against your wife or
[49:19] your husband or your pastor or the
[49:21] church member it's not against flesh and
[49:23] blood it's against the Prince of the
[49:25] power of the air
[49:26] that's Ephesians 2:2 now listen real
[49:29] close he's just a prince now a prince
[49:36] somewhere along the way is in the
[49:40] lineage to inherit but if we would look
[49:45] at our modern-day saw
[49:46] we would look over into England where
[49:49] they still have a queen and they still
[49:51] have that royal line we find out that
[49:54] there's a Prince Andrew and a Prince
[49:56] Harry and a princess and a blah blah
[49:58] blah there's all kinds of princes but
[50:00] only one of those gentlemen truly fits
[50:07] the qualifications to inherit the throne
[50:11] even though there are others with the
[50:15] subtitle Prince my wife was telling me
[50:19] that somebody we know is is I don't know
[50:24] what the right word is but taking this
[50:26] King around the country introducing him
[50:31] to message churches this King is from
[50:36] some country in Africa I laughed
[50:40] not much of a king to let some peasant
[50:48] take him around and introduce him to the
[50:53] other believers I'm not looking for that
[50:56] kind of king praise the Lord for his
[51:00] earthly title but there's one king I'm
[51:02] interested in everybody else is a prince
[51:07] don't you find it interesting that the
[51:09] that the greatest warrior of all time
[51:11] Joshua was a general did you know that's
[51:15] what the Prophet called him a general
[51:18] possibly the greatest military mind that
[51:22] walked the earth outside of Christ of
[51:25] course because he's the one who said if
[51:28] you're gonna go to war don't you sit
[51:31] down and try to figure out if you can
[51:33] win it or not has anybody ever done that
[51:36] have you all ever sat down and figured
[51:38] out well I'm in a battle and mmm I
[51:41] wonder I wonder what it's going to take
[51:45] to win I've never done that when God
[51:50] called me and I gave my heart to him I
[51:52] knew I was on the winning side right
[51:55] then I didn't have to keep researching
[51:58] and try to figure out you know just
[52:00] actly how this is gonna work out I
[52:02] believe that because of God's election
[52:07] and if I would stay with it we would win
[52:14] but I find it interesting that Joshua in
[52:20] the heat of battle
[52:22] and a little respite in between battles
[52:26] comes across a man who looks like a man
[52:33] draws his sword and sets the Ru for us
[52:38] marty'll against I want you to notice
[52:45] the humility of God here's a general
[52:52] asking this man a question this man
[52:57] answers I am the captain of the host of
[53:02] the Lord did you notice the humility of
[53:06] God he didn't say I'm a five-star
[53:08] general he didn't say as a lieutenant
[53:11] colonel he didn't say I was an admiral
[53:15] he said I'm the captain of the host of
[53:20] the Lord Wow to me that's tremendous
[53:25] brothers and sisters because God brother
[53:28] branham tells us in one place that that
[53:30] was Jesus Christ in that form Wow you
[53:39] see our battle it's not who we think we
[53:43] are it's who we are
[53:46] now I entitled the message this morning
[53:49] Father of lights because I want to go
[53:51] into how we recognize the enemy and if
[53:57] we can recognize the enemy then we can
[53:59] certainly recognize our God is that
[54:04] right but I'm going to tell you our
[54:05] enemy is somebody that we should begin
[54:10] to understand or the Prophet would not
[54:12] have preached it to us
[54:14] because a lot of folks like us are going
[54:18] to find ourselves like the other folks
[54:21] that I've mentioned in our ranks that
[54:23] all of a sudden after 40 years and 40 by
[54:27] the way is an important number whether
[54:29] you know it or not it's a number of
[54:32] temptation you understand you it's it's
[54:36] it's like a number also of judgment and
[54:38] so forth people are beginning to look at
[54:43] the message that you and I and I and I
[54:46] say this that we believe I could say
[54:48] that that we say we believe but that we
[54:50] believe when they're going while I'm an
[54:54] eye I see a mistake here hmm
[54:59] oh that looks like another mistake oh my
[55:06] goodness there's three I wonder how many
[55:09] there are and you can start to look
[55:12] around through the messages that brother
[55:15] Branham preached then you can begin to
[55:17] find clerical errors and you know errors
[55:22] in our English language and he was a man
[55:24] he he would say one number seven hundred
[55:28] and instead of seven thousand you know
[55:30] there's all kinds of arguments and
[55:32] doctrines over that we're not fighting
[55:33] flesh and blood so one the world are we
[55:39] doing looking into what we consider not
[55:44] we but people consider to be the
[55:45] mistakes of a mortal man brothers and
[55:50] sisters I'll say this with all the
[55:52] confidence in the world the very day
[55:54] that God allowed me to hear the call
[55:59] he'd probably been calling me since I
[56:03] was born I didn't know that but just
[56:08] prior to my 22nd birthday I I said oh
[56:14] something's going on what is it I wasn't
[56:18] raised in a church was raised in the
[56:20] world out on the street come from a
[56:22] separated divorced family kind of wild
[56:25] wasn't looking
[56:27] for God but praise the Lord he was
[56:30] looking for me so thankful that he was
[56:34] looking for me he was looking for you
[56:36] and then when we when finally got to the
[56:40] place in our life inside of ourselves
[56:43] where we could stop for a minute but
[56:45] what's wrong with me that's God you
[56:53] don't read them you didn't realize but
[56:54] that was the call of God saying come
[56:58] home my child you can stop wasting your
[57:02] time and your life and your life's
[57:05] energy looking for me because I'm
[57:10] standing before you and I'm going to
[57:14] meet up with you now you can make this
[57:17] hard you can make this easy for the
[57:23] first 21 and a half years of my life I
[57:25] made it hard and the reason I say that
[57:28] and somebody say what wasn't wasn't my
[57:31] fault that I didn't know no I agree but
[57:37] it would be our fault if we rejected it
[57:41] when he made that call and I said Lord I
[57:48] understand that I'm a sinner I love the
[57:51] way brother Brandon portrays it he
[57:53] wanted to write him a note tack it on a
[57:56] tree that didn't work out finally got
[58:01] into the woodshed or their little garage
[58:02] he said there was a crashed Model A or
[58:05] Model T in there so I had to be a little
[58:06] kind of a garage shed and he said I just
[58:11] want you to know that I've come to the
[58:13] conclusion that that I'm a sinner I can
[58:18] see it I can see that I've been going
[58:22] down the wrong road all of my life and I
[58:26] just want you to talk to me he would say
[58:29] I just I just want to just want to just
[58:32] just want you to know that it was a
[58:35] conflict going huh but God wasn't
[58:38] conflicted
[58:40] God had all the angels of heaven right
[58:43] then doing this praise the Lord
[58:46] another one is answering the call right
[58:51] because all of the angels of heaven
[58:53] rejoice when one more comes in did you
[58:57] realize that you young folks or your
[58:59] middle-aged folks are you old folks that
[59:01] haven't given your heart completely to
[59:03] the Lord yet you want to see a festival
[59:06] you want to see a parade you want to see
[59:09] a party give your heart to the Lord you
[59:12] won't see it with these eyes because
[59:15] Satan is trying to get you to maneuver
[59:17] through your life with these eyes it's a
[59:23] conflict so let me finish this some
[59:27] aren't sure so let's take a look at our
[59:29] adversary do you know what the word
[59:32] adversary means did you know that the
[59:35] word Satan means adversary now remember
[59:40] in revelations chapter 12 we find out
[59:43] that this battle didn't begin down here
[59:46] this battle began it began in heaven
[59:49] right it was a spiritual battle in
[59:52] heaven before it ever dropped down to
[59:54] earth that's why it's still a spiritual
[59:57] battle but listen to the word Satan it
[1:00:00] means adversary it's taken from the root
[1:00:04] word adverse now I must say that again
[1:00:10] it's taken from the root word add verse
[1:00:19] and you shall not add to or take away
[1:00:22] from as a matter of fact did you guys
[1:00:25] know that in one fell swoop
[1:00:27] Satan using the serpent both added to
[1:00:31] and took away from the Word of God all
[1:00:33] at the same time how did he do it
[1:00:36] because he used the word not which is a
[1:00:41] negative that he added into God's Word
[1:00:44] so he both added
[1:00:46] and took away from at the same time
[1:00:50] that's why he's Satan because he had
[1:00:55] verse I just got this from the
[1:01:00] dictionary the Lord just opened this up
[1:01:02] to me
[1:01:02] a person who opposes or fights against
[1:01:07] another an opponent an enemy ad verse
[1:01:13] turned opposite to praise the Lord you
[1:01:18] know how God countered that God
[1:01:22] countered that with repent because what
[1:01:26] does it mean I'm going this way now God
[1:01:33] knows what he's doing you see we're on
[1:01:34] the winning side if we'll just follow
[1:01:39] the combat handbook all right can't fail
[1:01:46] can't fail adverse moving or working in
[1:01:50] an opposite or contrary direction so we
[1:01:57] need to take a look at our adversary we
[1:02:02] need to be able to discern who that is
[1:02:07] remember that there are two spirits that
[1:02:13] would be so close that it would to see
[1:02:17] the very elected if possible one of
[1:02:19] those spirits is correct and one of
[1:02:22] those spirits is the adversary but they
[1:02:25] are so close that they're very hard to
[1:02:29] distinguish one from the other can I ask
[1:02:34] you a question how far away is your
[1:02:37] spirit from your soul it's like me
[1:02:46] preaching on the on a series I'll just
[1:02:48] use the word anyway can't find a better
[1:02:50] one on the foolish and the wise Matthew
[1:02:54] 25 it says behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:02:59] go ye out to meet him can I ask you a
[1:03:02] question just how far are you willing to
[1:03:06] go go ye out to medium how far but when
[1:03:14] the revelation of Jesus Christ comes to
[1:03:17] us today we find out that he is here we
[1:03:23] don't even have to move to go out to
[1:03:27] meet him because the kingdom of God is
[1:03:33] within you
[1:03:35] you see that brothers and sisters you
[1:03:38] don't have to go anywhere if people are
[1:03:40] gonna go he's over here in the caves
[1:03:41] always in this city oh he's in this town
[1:03:44] always in this movement well praise the
[1:03:47] Lord he's omnipresent and he's in me
[1:03:51] he's in you we don't have to rush out
[1:03:54] and find him
[1:03:57] because he promised that he would be
[1:04:01] wherever we are in that day you shall
[1:04:06] know that I am in the father the father
[1:04:08] in me I in you and you in me we don't
[1:04:11] have to go anywhere except in our prayer
[1:04:16] closet he's right there still with me
[1:04:21] now remember brothers and sisters you
[1:04:23] forgive me for cutting us all up but
[1:04:25] this is a compilation of about 15 or 18
[1:04:27] messages those two spirits will be so
[1:04:33] close that it would deceive the very
[1:04:34] elect if possible so brothers and
[1:04:36] sisters it's a spirit it's not flesh and
[1:04:40] but do you realize you may not realize
[1:04:42] this I'm gonna break it down into
[1:04:44] simplicity when you're driving down the
[1:04:46] highway now I realize I'm talking to a
[1:04:49] mixed audience not a mixed multitude and
[1:04:55] that did you realize that some of you
[1:04:57] caused road rage
[1:05:01] I know who you are you're the person in
[1:05:06] the left lane driving 65 when the speed
[1:05:09] limit is 75 and you refuse to yield has
[1:05:15] that ever happened to anybody in the
[1:05:16] room but what happens you know and a few
[1:05:23] kind names come out you know I become
[1:05:27] mesial idiot I mean we're not gonna cuss
[1:05:34] we know that I may but you just
[1:05:35] frustration just begins to well up yeah
[1:05:38] I'm saying this for a reason it's a
[1:05:42] spirit it's a spirit it's not the person
[1:05:47] driving slow in front of you oh then
[1:05:50] anoint it I want you to understand
[1:05:52] they're anointed for what to frustrate
[1:05:55] come on and I'm using that as a graphic
[1:05:59] example but that's in every facet you
[1:06:02] know come on at the grocery store who
[1:06:04] picks the right wine not me
[1:06:09] it's eeny meeny miny moe who cares which
[1:06:12] line you get in it's gonna go slow
[1:06:14] there's gonna be a sticker missing on
[1:06:16] there's no price on that there's no and
[1:06:18] that people are in the one next to you
[1:06:21] move over do the one next to you and
[1:06:22] that one starts going faster yours is
[1:06:24] like it's a spirit you don't realise
[1:06:28] that brothers and sisters but it's a
[1:06:29] spirit that's anointing the world okay
[1:06:34] you see that so then in order for us to
[1:06:39] be the the the person in the battle
[1:06:44] against that what do we realize patience
[1:06:49] what's the hurry okay if they want to
[1:06:53] plug up the fast lane look for your
[1:06:55] opportunity to go around him and that's
[1:06:58] what brother Branham said to do you know
[1:07:00] he said when you come up against
[1:07:02] somebody who disagrees with you and you
[1:07:05] know they're off the word you don't get
[1:07:06] in their face and start swinging Adam
[1:07:09] you say Father forgive them for they
[1:07:11] know not what they're doing
[1:07:14] and brother branham said you shake their
[1:07:16] hand passing by that's what you do on
[1:07:21] the highway you just move around them
[1:07:23] and then you know who's I'm a fool for
[1:07:25] Christ who's fly you know that you guys
[1:07:27] know that remember the two on the
[1:07:29] sidewalk and then the guy blocking the
[1:07:33] highway says I don't move for anybody
[1:07:35] and the man says well I do he just walks
[1:07:37] around him you know I don't he says I
[1:07:41] don't move for a fool like you you know
[1:07:44] you see we're in a battle and brothers
[1:07:48] and sisters we have the truth we have
[1:07:51] the endtime message but how are we using
[1:07:55] it are we using it as a weapon it is a
[1:08:00] sharp two-edged sword I'll agree with
[1:08:02] that but it's more like a scalpel it's
[1:08:08] more like a scalpel than it is some big
[1:08:10] instrument to bludgeon people with it
[1:08:14] cuts coming and going God's Word is so
[1:08:20] powerful that it can cut you as it's
[1:08:24] going in and heal you as it's coming out
[1:08:29] and guess what else it does it leaves no
[1:08:32] scar
[1:08:34] you see divine healing was a glimpse of
[1:08:39] that do you realize that we have to
[1:08:43] believe in divine healing and I remember
[1:08:45] saying something to somebody recently
[1:08:46] and they got me I said what we have to
[1:08:49] love them don't Wayne he looks at me he
[1:08:50] says haften well I mean I didn't mean it
[1:08:55] the way that I said it but the way that
[1:08:56] it came out was he said you mean we have
[1:08:58] to no no we just do we just do and
[1:09:03] that's what it's coming down to brothers
[1:09:05] and sisters we have the most powerful
[1:09:08] weapon on planet earth as a matter of
[1:09:12] fact here's how powerful the weapon is
[1:09:14] in the conflict between God and Satan
[1:09:18] page 8 down at the very bottom of
[1:09:21] paragraph 55 don't you think that God
[1:09:24] see
[1:09:25] what Satan would be what Satan would do
[1:09:30] he gave to his children and provided for
[1:09:34] them the best thing that could be
[1:09:36] provided for them to knowing what the
[1:09:39] enemy's attack would be God fortified
[1:09:42] his children see we take the war when
[1:09:45] the general goes out to meet another
[1:09:47] general in war and this general if he's
[1:09:50] a real true citizen of this nation that
[1:09:52] he represents and he surely would be to
[1:09:55] be a general first thing he studies the
[1:09:58] enemy's attacks that's what we're doing
[1:10:01] he knows what he's going to do how he's
[1:10:05] going to work because he kind of went
[1:10:08] over and spied out I know he's got it up
[1:10:13] there now
[1:10:14] good I'm gonna read the next paragraph
[1:10:16] for a reason we got spies everywhere
[1:10:20] you know there's American spies in
[1:10:24] England there's American spies in France
[1:10:28] and you wonder what's going on in our
[1:10:31] government today huh there's German
[1:10:34] spies here and there's no matter how
[1:10:37] friendly we are we still got spies and
[1:10:41] we're spying out some kind of a nuclear
[1:10:44] weapon then we find it take it back to
[1:10:46] the country then what it is they get
[1:10:48] ready when war does come they know how
[1:10:51] to attack their enemy we're in a war so
[1:10:57] we need to know how to attack our enemy
[1:11:01] it's not the kind of fight brothers and
[1:11:04] sisters that we view in our natural
[1:11:07] realm now we all know that Jesus when
[1:11:12] you can keep that up there brother when
[1:11:14] Jesus was tempted in the wilderness
[1:11:17] brother branham tells us and we see it
[1:11:20] in the Bible that he did not use one
[1:11:22] super natural weapon at his disposal
[1:11:26] that's so unlike you and I when we are
[1:11:30] looking for every supernatural weapon at
[1:11:33] our disposal to use
[1:11:38] God Almighty said but it's also written
[1:11:46] the best weapon we got but it's also
[1:11:51] written and it's not just the word in
[1:11:55] that form what it is is understanding
[1:11:58] how that word is placed if it's being
[1:12:02] properly used or misused because Satan
[1:12:06] quoted him the word forward here he
[1:12:10] never had an averse so it would didn't
[1:12:14] look like he was the enemy when they're
[1:12:16] adding the verse are taking away one you
[1:12:18] and I say wait a minute that's not what
[1:12:20] he said but when the enemy is taking the
[1:12:24] word and quoting it verbatim but taking
[1:12:28] it out of context misplacing it
[1:12:32] misconstruing it misusing it oh it gets
[1:12:35] a little tighter you really have to have
[1:12:40] a revelation in order to truly
[1:12:42] understand the use of the word not just
[1:12:48] the fact that it is at your disposal
[1:12:51] still with me all right he says
[1:12:55] paragraph 58 it looks like God knew this
[1:13:00] great warfare was coming on between
[1:13:02] right and wrong he knew what the enemy
[1:13:05] was going to do he knowed just exactly
[1:13:08] how to equip his people so if we notice
[1:13:13] the very first thing that God equipped
[1:13:15] his children was being infinite he
[1:13:18] knowed what it took to defeat Satan
[1:13:20] anytime I love this any place anywhere
[1:13:26] on any conditions I love that that right
[1:13:33] there tells us we're on the winning side
[1:13:36] now he wouldn't say listen now
[1:13:39] he wouldn't say I'll give them something
[1:13:42] here and then a few years later I'm a
[1:13:44] study out something better to give them
[1:13:46] and then after a few and brothers and
[1:13:49] sisters that's happening
[1:13:51] I contend that I know brothers who have
[1:13:54] been preaching this message for 40 or 50
[1:13:57] years and they're beginning to think
[1:13:59] that it's time for us to go back to the
[1:14:02] Bible watch house doesn't that sound
[1:14:08] good brother Lewis it's time for us to
[1:14:11] go back to the Bible I contend brother
[1:14:16] when did you leave it I don't believe
[1:14:22] the message of the hour is separate from
[1:14:24] the Bible I don't believe that if you
[1:14:29] don't it's okay with me I love you
[1:14:30] anyway
[1:14:31] but I will shake your hand and pass you
[1:14:35] by
[1:14:37] because I'm not looking to go to the
[1:14:39] Moon or Mars or Venus I'm not looking
[1:14:42] for the sputnik to find the center
[1:14:45] did you realize brother branham told us
[1:14:47] that that's what Einstein was looking
[1:14:52] for through his mathematical equations
[1:14:54] that's what science is looking for
[1:14:56] sending out these trillion trillion
[1:14:58] trillion dollar satellites if I could
[1:15:03] just convince them brother Lewis that
[1:15:06] what they're looking for is the Welsh
[1:15:10] revival I'd like 10% of all their
[1:15:15] spending
[1:15:17] we'd all be on easy street they're
[1:15:20] spending trillions of dollars looking
[1:15:22] for God when God is in his people you
[1:15:29] see the conflict going on
[1:15:30] brothers and sisters science is trying
[1:15:32] to convince us that there's not a God
[1:15:34] when brother Branham said science only
[1:15:38] by their own actions eventually proves
[1:15:44] and we're not looking for proof are we
[1:15:46] I'm not I just believe it I mean I tell
[1:15:52] people this and it's not on me I just
[1:15:55] want you to know the way I think so that
[1:15:57] you'll understand when I'm preaching to
[1:15:59] you how I see things the same God that
[1:16:02] saved me the very same day told me this
[1:16:09] is my prophet I sent him to you take
[1:16:15] heed to what he is saying I'm not
[1:16:18] looking for the mistakes of William
[1:16:20] Mariam Branham because this message is
[1:16:22] really not about William Mariam Branham
[1:16:24] it's about Jesus Christ but God used
[1:16:27] William Marion random to bring that word
[1:16:31] I'm not looking for the humanity I got
[1:16:36] saved from that brother I'm looking for
[1:16:39] God and God is in his word
[1:16:43] yes brother Branham was a human being
[1:16:46] born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to
[1:16:49] the world speaking lies full of trouble
[1:16:50] in shorter days and you might wonder why
[1:16:52] I'm saying this this morning I know you
[1:16:54] believe the way that I believe but the
[1:16:56] devil in the form of a spirit is going
[1:17:00] to try to anoint everybody in this room
[1:17:03] to get them to begin to doubt something
[1:17:07] somehow some way that's his job and if
[1:17:11] he can't get you to doubt the letter
[1:17:13] he'll get you to doubt the postman who
[1:17:17] brought it it is not the post forgive me
[1:17:20] brother Wade wherever you're on it is
[1:17:22] not the postman's fault that he's
[1:17:24] bringing you a return Reggie
[1:17:26] receipt letter that you've got a sign
[1:17:28] from the IRS it might not even be your
[1:17:33] fault but when you get it
[1:17:37] man I'm going down to the post office
[1:17:39] and I'm gonna knock them all out you
[1:17:43] know you and I don't have to worry about
[1:17:44] that right the postman do that too they
[1:17:46] each other they get so frustrated with
[1:17:52] the negativity that they're involved in
[1:17:55] so so so you see how the ministry is the
[1:17:57] ministry is just God's postman
[1:18:03] delivering a message from God
[1:18:07] of course we're filled with mistakes God
[1:18:10] knows that but you know what's really
[1:18:15] wonderful about the God we serve he
[1:18:18] don't care because he made a way for us
[1:18:23] mistake ridden children of his to be
[1:18:26] perfect in his sight and that's through
[1:18:29] the blood of Jesus Christ which it won't
[1:18:32] be long before they begin to remove that
[1:18:37] you don't realize that brothers is it's
[1:18:39] a spirit and it's not it's is like well
[1:18:43] if people say well it's not here brother
[1:18:45] it's everywhere it's it's not it's not
[1:18:48] subject to confinement
[1:18:51] you see God said I'll pour out my spirit
[1:18:54] upon all flesh did me and Joel watch how
[1:18:57] close this is do you know that when Eve
[1:19:00] conceived and had cain she's the type of
[1:19:05] the church what does she say gotten a
[1:19:08] man now you and I have been informed
[1:19:14] through God's postman the prophet of God
[1:19:18] that because all life comes from God Eve
[1:19:22] said that by that revelation that she
[1:19:26] had but what was her revelation was it
[1:19:31] that she had gotten Cain
[1:19:34] the Lord or that all life comes from the
[1:19:36] Lord so she could make that statement
[1:19:38] who how close is that it's really tight
[1:19:42] and this is me now can I can I be me for
[1:19:46] a minute I want to give you an akan
[1:19:47] tension since I'm on the contending for
[1:19:49] the faith I truly believe that because
[1:19:53] Cain heard his mother his church say
[1:19:59] I've gotten a man from the Lord
[1:20:01] somewhere along the way
[1:20:03] Cain took that as a vindication want you
[1:20:11] to think about the way we are now come
[1:20:13] on we're all men and women and boys and
[1:20:19] girls from the Lord but what's the
[1:20:21] revelation of that statement you see
[1:20:25] what I'm saying
[1:20:26] and I truly believe now again this is me
[1:20:30] I want you to it's not a doctrine but I
[1:20:33] think the way I understand humanity that
[1:20:36] came began to feed off that and he
[1:20:40] thought he was righteous in killing Abel
[1:20:45] because he was a man yeah his mother
[1:20:51] told him that I got me I got a man and
[1:20:54] he he probably fought off of that and he
[1:20:58] said who in the world does this Abel
[1:21:00] think he is look at my sacrifice look at
[1:21:06] the beauty of it look at the effort I
[1:21:09] put in look at the toil look at this
[1:21:11] look at this as a matter of fact the
[1:21:12] Bible he's quoting the Bible now this is
[1:21:15] how sharp he is he says we're supposed
[1:21:17] to the earth is supposed to bring forth
[1:21:19] after its kind and we're supposed to
[1:21:21] tend to it I'm the gardener think about
[1:21:27] it and he brings flowers and fruit and
[1:21:31] just a lovely bouquet
[1:21:33] I imagine that altar was pretty awesome
[1:21:38] Monet couldn't do it you know what I
[1:21:43] mean and you know he got raw
[1:21:48] only because his sacrifice was not as
[1:21:53] accepted as Abel's you see the Bible
[1:21:59] tells us that Abel's sacrifice was more
[1:22:01] excellent oh that rubbed him you see the
[1:22:05] battle were in brothers and sisters
[1:22:07] we've got to stop looking with these
[1:22:09] eyes there is a different eye that God's
[1:22:15] asking us to use you see when you go to
[1:22:20] Genesis just leave that up on there
[1:22:22] brother but when you go to Genesis you
[1:22:24] find out that the fruit of the tree of
[1:22:27] knowledge of good and evil was pleasant
[1:22:30] to the eyes is that right that's
[1:22:37] Scripture now I'll just be is vanilla as
[1:22:44] I know how to be but that's the reason
[1:22:45] why pornography is where it's at
[1:22:51] the Bible says it's pleasant to the eyes
[1:22:57] just can't take their eyes off of it I
[1:23:02] know there's children in here so I'll
[1:23:04] stop right there
[1:23:05] but the adults understand you love you
[1:23:14] I'll go a few more minutes yeah I got
[1:23:17] this afternoon so are you alright with
[1:23:20] that so let's go down paragraph 60
[1:23:31] but God at the beginning gave his
[1:23:34] children the atomic weapon did you
[1:23:37] realize that you have an atomic weapon
[1:23:41] because he's the infinite God now seeing
[1:23:44] there was going to be a conflict and
[1:23:46] there was going to be a battle god
[1:23:48] equipped his children with the right
[1:23:50] kind of ammunition right kind of an
[1:23:55] attack right kind of everything that
[1:23:58] they had need of what would sweep them
[1:24:00] all the way from Eden to the rapture
[1:24:05] what was it the word the word
[1:24:13] that's what defeats Satan is the word
[1:24:17] it'll defeat him anywhere any place now
[1:24:20] why do we want to substitute something
[1:24:22] else when we've already got the best
[1:24:25] thing there is the word but the next
[1:24:33] phase of this message is going to give
[1:24:35] you a little insight I'll use the word
[1:24:38] illumination or enlightenment - what the
[1:24:43] word really is we think it's these
[1:24:46] letters on these pages we think it's the
[1:24:49] printing in this book we think it's what
[1:24:51] we're looking at on the screen and there
[1:24:53] is a partial truth to that but what
[1:25:00] really is the word that's where this
[1:25:04] really gets Nifty all right first of all
[1:25:09] I'll take that this afternoon let me go
[1:25:12] here let me find my bits of notes that I
[1:25:16] have if you'll just bear with me I got
[1:25:18] him in here oh excuse me I'm getting a
[1:25:21] little bit more sophisticated brother
[1:25:22] Joseph Hey he he he text me last night
[1:25:27] said could you email me your your quotes
[1:25:30] and your scriptures and I said how in
[1:25:31] the world I did I text him back how in
[1:25:33] the world can I email you the thoughts
[1:25:35] that are in my mind
[1:25:38] we're getting there but I'm not there
[1:25:41] yet
[1:25:42] so I thought of some of the scriptures
[1:25:45] that I was going to use and I thought of
[1:25:46] some of the messages that I was going to
[1:25:49] quote out of and I gave him that much
[1:25:51] which is certainly not enough do you
[1:25:56] love the Lord I want you to listen now
[1:25:58] to what the Prophet is saying to us and
[1:26:01] to me this is God talking to us not
[1:26:04] William Branham is God no no now I tell
[1:26:08] you what brothers and sisters it's come
[1:26:09] down to this the very words that he
[1:26:12] spoke well what represent God and if a
[1:26:16] man is behind the pulpit and God is
[1:26:18] using him he's on the same that's why he
[1:26:25] said I'm the captain of the hosts of the
[1:26:27] Lord
[1:26:28] captain you mean you only made the rank
[1:26:31] of captain in the message there's a man
[1:26:37] who could turn on the light brother
[1:26:39] Branham says that's the same thing
[1:26:41] brother that'd be paragraph 75 probably
[1:26:46] in the middle of paragraph 75 that I
[1:26:48] gave you there's a man who could turn on
[1:26:53] the light I'll just start reading it
[1:26:56] that's the same thing it is in the word
[1:26:57] see the word is God but remember God's
[1:27:04] not a bunch of letters the word is God
[1:27:07] and when the life strikes it it brings
[1:27:12] it light strikes it it brings the word
[1:27:16] to life again every age has always been
[1:27:21] that oh how we appreciate these great
[1:27:23] things how that the word being
[1:27:24] vindicated is the light of the spoken
[1:27:28] word see God said let there be light is
[1:27:31] that right
[1:27:32] justice 1:3 now what if he just said it
[1:27:36] and no light come then we don't know
[1:27:41] whether it's true or not come on I'm
[1:27:46] reading the prophets word then we do
[1:27:49] know whether it's true or not so all of
[1:27:51] the things that are said in these
[1:27:54] publications that we believe are God's
[1:28:00] words let there be light
[1:28:02] we really don't know if this is the
[1:28:05] truth or not I'm just reading what the
[1:28:09] Prophet said now what if he just said
[1:28:11] let there be light and he said and there
[1:28:14] was no light come then we don't know
[1:28:16] whether it's true or not we don't know
[1:28:18] whether he is all right we don't know
[1:28:20] whether he is God or not because he just
[1:28:23] said let there be and there wasn't see
[1:28:29] now if you could put yourself in the
[1:28:31] mindset of how brother Branham is
[1:28:34] bringing this you could begin to
[1:28:35] understand what the word really is
[1:28:38] brother Branham says this and other
[1:28:40] messages it might be in here also God
[1:28:42] said let there be light and it could
[1:28:43] have been trillions trillions of years
[1:28:48] but you see God didn't stop and look
[1:28:50] over his shoulder every ten minutes and
[1:28:53] say I wonder if it's gonna happen no he
[1:29:00] said let there be light and he just kept
[1:29:02] moving forward because he knew the power
[1:29:06] of his spoken word was going to in its
[1:29:09] time produce light behind him that's why
[1:29:19] the messengers not here anymore
[1:29:21] because what he said was going to begin
[1:29:24] to produce if it was the Word of God a
[1:29:28] manifestation of itself that's why we
[1:29:33] that's why we love to read John 1:1 so
[1:29:36] much in that right in the beginning was
[1:29:38] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:29:39] the Word was God
[1:29:40] now we might not know if it was so or
[1:29:43] not but the Word was made flesh and
[1:29:45] dwelt among us and that Word made flesh
[1:29:48] was based on prophecies for instance
[1:29:50] like Isaiah now I probably have said
[1:29:52] this before here but I want to make an
[1:29:54] emphasis because the devil is fighting
[1:29:56] us and we don't even know it we think
[1:29:59] everything is just he's fighting us
[1:30:04] how well Isaiah said behold a virgin
[1:30:08] shall conceive can I ask everybody in
[1:30:12] here how long they think the generations
[1:30:15] after he said it began to drop off
[1:30:19] Isaiah said let her be liked
[1:30:21] oh right I mean behold the virgin shall
[1:30:27] conceive now there were no doubt because
[1:30:32] of the recognition of the definition of
[1:30:35] a prophet people following Isaiah well
[1:30:38] Isaiah as a man of God I'm telling you
[1:30:39] you should see what he did he said this
[1:30:42] and this happened he said this and this
[1:30:43] happened and he said this and this
[1:30:44] happened he laid hands on this person
[1:30:46] and they got well and and there's just
[1:30:47] cancer fell off and you know you course
[1:30:49] I'm in fast-forward and all these things
[1:30:50] happen
[1:30:52] behold a virgin shall conceive a man
[1:30:55] it's scientifically impossible but I
[1:30:58] believe it anyway
[1:31:00] okay but then the children and then the
[1:31:07] grand show the great grand now God don't
[1:31:10] have grandchildren but we do and then
[1:31:13] the great-grandchildren so one
[1:31:14] generation to June so how many people
[1:31:17] were left seven hundred and forty years
[1:31:21] later do you know that in between the
[1:31:25] prophecy of Isaiah and one young lady
[1:31:29] recognizing that it's still true people
[1:31:35] were dropping like flies think about
[1:31:40] what this is going on in our agency
[1:31:42] people are dropping out they're either
[1:31:44] saying brother branham's God he's not
[1:31:47] God he comes under the atonement he
[1:31:51] couldn't be that should settle it right
[1:31:54] there but there's thousands of things
[1:31:56] you can say he was a man God used
[1:31:59] brothers and sisters God is no respecter
[1:32:01] of persons God wants to use you and me
[1:32:04] just like he used the Prophet not in
[1:32:07] that position
[1:32:09] but in the way that he believed in the
[1:32:13] way that God's Word could manifest
[1:32:15] itself through your life even if it's
[1:32:18] this simple brother branham would
[1:32:20] mention who brother Branham I don't have
[1:32:21] a position in the church and and I'm
[1:32:23] really nobody and I don't have any said
[1:32:25] but you might produce a child who would
[1:32:28] produce a child who would be the next
[1:32:31] Billy Sunday see what I'm saying we wait
[1:32:35] so so we all have our place in our
[1:32:38] position we all have our portion in the
[1:32:41] economy of God but the devil is trying
[1:32:44] to convince us that were either
[1:32:46] worthless or were so much we ain't got
[1:32:49] no room for him I made people like that
[1:32:53] wonderful people
[1:32:54] awesome preachers then I think if they
[1:32:57] just left a little bit of room for
[1:32:58] Christ man that'd be they'd be
[1:33:00] incredible but they're so full of
[1:33:01] themselves there's just not enough room
[1:33:04] for Christ in there and if there is it's
[1:33:06] just the tiny little speck and they
[1:33:07] think like behold the man you've met him
[1:33:12] I mean I've come across him and then you
[1:33:14] got people go like brother Joel wobbles
[1:33:16] eyz hmm
[1:33:18] I don't know if I'll ever get it done I
[1:33:20] don't know I don't know if this is gonna
[1:33:22] work out for me no it's like that old
[1:33:24] cartoon guy it'll never work I remember
[1:33:28] the guy in the cartoons and I was like
[1:33:29] it'll never work he would say he had the
[1:33:33] wowsie wowsie was apparently but that's
[1:33:36] not what God wants he wants you and I to
[1:33:39] come to an understanding of why he did
[1:33:44] what he did
[1:33:45] and he did it to express himself through
[1:33:48] his attributes now can I ask you a
[1:33:50] personal question who are his attributes
[1:33:55] so I like that's right I like to say it
[1:33:58] like this
[1:33:58] so here's God before the foundation of
[1:34:01] the world in his own mind before there
[1:34:03] was a molecule and he's and he is
[1:34:07] expressing himself through his thoughts
[1:34:09] and he says I'm a healer I'm going to
[1:34:16] express that attribute and he asked Jobe
[1:34:21] where were you when the sons of God
[1:34:24] shouted for joy before the foundation of
[1:34:29] the world I'll tell you where he was
[1:34:30] that he was in the mind of God and this
[1:34:32] is brothers and sisters worried his
[1:34:34] attributes I want you to think about
[1:34:37] this whereas attributes so much so we're
[1:34:40] so in tune with God why because we came
[1:34:44] from God and we have gone back to God
[1:34:49] whether we realize that or not and in
[1:34:52] that expression of his word I am a
[1:34:55] savior I am a healer right nobody been
[1:35:00] sick nobody had been lost how did this
[1:35:03] all come about people think well God
[1:35:06] decided that he would make a list of
[1:35:08] names and put him on a book and then
[1:35:10] he'd begin the ball rolling so that he
[1:35:14] could express himself well there's some
[1:35:15] truth in that but let me tell you a
[1:35:17] little bit more about God let's get
[1:35:19] intimate with him in God where his
[1:35:21] attributes which are you and I so when
[1:35:24] that great God in his mind said I'm a
[1:35:28] healer but nobody's sick I can just see
[1:35:36] one of his attributes and the back part
[1:35:38] of his mind raise up their hand and go
[1:35:41] I'll go I'll go down
[1:35:48] I'll be sick don't not knowing what
[1:35:50] sickness is I'll go I'll be sick so you
[1:35:54] can express yourself I'll go I'll be
[1:35:57] lost but here's the beauty of it because
[1:36:01] we were in the mind of God before the
[1:36:03] foundation of the world and we knew who
[1:36:05] he was we knew what we came from we know
[1:36:07] are we going it's not a problem yeah I
[1:36:10] don't mind being lost I don't mind being
[1:36:13] sick because I want him to express
[1:36:15] himself through his attribute but now
[1:36:21] we've turned a corner brothers and
[1:36:23] sisters and God's plan is coming to a
[1:36:25] close in that portion of it and now
[1:36:31] we're realizing that we were in the mind
[1:36:34] of God before the foundation of the
[1:36:35] world and sickness is nothing except the
[1:36:38] expression of the attribute of healing
[1:36:42] you with me being lost no problem
[1:36:46] because we're found see being sick no
[1:36:50] problem because he provided a way for us
[1:36:53] to be healed and it's all through faith
[1:36:58] the most misunderstood action on planet
[1:37:02] Earth the definition of faith is so
[1:37:04] against the grain for you and me because
[1:37:08] the definition of faith is a belief in
[1:37:11] something for which there is no proof
[1:37:14] that's why I say prove God I don't have
[1:37:17] to I believed him I don't need to prove
[1:37:21] God I believe him must be a tough tablet
[1:37:28] you're still with me you know what I'm
[1:37:31] gonna close in five minutes I just love
[1:37:36] it I just love him let me finish reading
[1:37:40] that part if this thing turns back on oh
[1:37:44] it's still working
[1:37:46] now what if he just said no light verse
[1:37:49] paragraph 76 then we don't know whether
[1:37:51] it's true or not we don't know whether
[1:37:53] he's alright we don't know whether he's
[1:37:55] God or not because he just said let
[1:37:57] there be and there wasn't and then when
[1:37:59] God speaks and we see it then that's the
[1:38:01] right I want you to get this so when God
[1:38:04] speaks so then when God speaks and we
[1:38:06] see it is I want you to notice it
[1:38:09] doesn't just say we see it it says we
[1:38:11] see it is then that's the light that
[1:38:15] shines forth the truth I love this the
[1:38:20] truth is that what it says the truth of
[1:38:22] the word wait a minute I thought the
[1:38:24] word and the truth were one in the same
[1:38:27] this is the truth of the word you see
[1:38:31] this is the word but the manifestation
[1:38:35] of it is the truth of the word that's
[1:38:39] the reason why brother Branham could get
[1:38:40] up and challenge everybody I challenge
[1:38:43] you to find something that God said
[1:38:46] through me that missed it he did it on
[1:38:51] every single message practically for you
[1:38:54] and I it was like well he just keeps
[1:38:57] saying it over and over and over and
[1:38:59] over and over and over apparently that's
[1:39:03] the way God has to work with us human
[1:39:06] beings because even on the road to
[1:39:08] emmaus he had to be revisit what the
[1:39:13] scripture said he was but he started out
[1:39:17] with all fools and slow of heart see
[1:39:22] what I'm saying a blessing sisters we've
[1:39:25] come to a place in the plan of God where
[1:39:27] we should be surpassing that it's it's
[1:39:31] it's well beyond the countdown so when
[1:39:36] God speaks and we see it is then that's
[1:39:39] the light that shines forth the truth of
[1:39:41] the word see various light and life
[1:39:44] all natural life comes by a spoken word
[1:39:46] we know that son is his spoken word he
[1:39:49] said it created
[1:39:50] he said he created a great light in the
[1:39:52] heavens for the day and a lesser light
[1:39:54] for the night and all the natural life
[1:39:56] has come by God spoken word a flower
[1:39:58] can't grow without the light of God
[1:40:00] spoken word shine upon it for the Sun
[1:40:03] the SU n is the spoken word of God when
[1:40:06] he said let there be light see it's God
[1:40:08] spoken life and no matter how much
[1:40:13] people try to
[1:40:14] say this that or the other it still
[1:40:16] remains the same you have to have that
[1:40:19] son
[1:40:21] so life natural can only come by the
[1:40:24] spoken word of God and spiritual life
[1:40:27] here we are eternal life can only come
[1:40:30] by God's spoken word of life life was
[1:40:36] the Esso end this time
[1:40:37] in him as light and in him is no
[1:40:39] darkness he is God spoken light is that
[1:40:42] right God spoken word for in the
[1:40:46] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:40:48] with God in the Word was God and it's
[1:40:50] forever God and it takes the light of
[1:40:53] God to strike the word to make it live
[1:40:56] here is what he spoke brother Branham
[1:40:59] Pat's his Bible now let the light shine
[1:41:01] amen let the light shine and the light
[1:41:05] will bring every word to its right
[1:41:07] position in its season did you get that
[1:41:12] what season are we in brothers and
[1:41:16] sisters did you realize that Satan is so
[1:41:20] shrewd that he declared himself an angel
[1:41:24] of light the very word Lucifer means
[1:41:30] light bearer and in first John chapter 1
[1:41:36] it says God is light whoo how we gonna
[1:41:40] know brother here's the light over here
[1:41:42] and here's a light over here well let me
[1:41:46] tell you how we know Satan will appear
[1:41:49] through natural light that you can see
[1:41:53] with this eye and God only appears when
[1:41:59] he wants to that's why he allowed his
[1:42:03] picture to be taken with the Prophet in
[1:42:05] Sam Houston Coliseum in 1950 now
[1:42:09] remember that picture
[1:42:11] brothers and sisters anybody who comes
[1:42:13] to me and says I see too many mistakes
[1:42:16] in the message and I I think we have to
[1:42:18] get back to the Bible huh
[1:42:21] like I said the first thing I ask is
[1:42:23] when did you leave the bottle
[1:42:25] if you've gotta go but you mean to tell
[1:42:27] me you've been preaching for 40 or 50
[1:42:29] years and you've been off the Bible the
[1:42:31] whole time I don't buy it
[1:42:34] I'm not looking at that kind of light
[1:42:37] I'm looking for a super natural did you
[1:42:43] realize that if you have the baptism of
[1:42:45] the Holy Ghost that you have a
[1:42:47] supernatural light in a cavity in the
[1:42:49] middle of your heart muscle about the
[1:42:52] size of my dream everybody well head
[1:42:58] down to the hospital this afternoon
[1:42:59] would you and have them cut you open and
[1:43:01] look for it they won't find it they
[1:43:04] won't see it yet it's there of course if
[1:43:10] you have the Holy Ghost and that's what
[1:43:12] we're looking for I'm not looking for
[1:43:15] the Holy Ghost through the actions of
[1:43:17] Pentecost I'm looking for Pentecost
[1:43:20] actions through me and I'm talking 2,000
[1:43:25] years ago I had a man recently tell me
[1:43:28] that old brother Branham didn't fulfill
[1:43:30] Malachi 4:5 you see he's like John the
[1:43:33] Baptist he turned the hearts of the
[1:43:34] fathers to the children but he hasn't
[1:43:36] turned the hearts of the children to the
[1:43:37] father's yet and I said beg your pardon
[1:43:42] he said you're gonna quote me one and I
[1:43:45] said no but I'm here to tell you that my
[1:43:49] heart's already been turned back to the
[1:43:53] original Pentecostal fathers it's too
[1:43:57] late you can't feed that to me and I
[1:44:01] know you represent the same thing please
[1:44:02] stand thank you for your time it pretty
[1:44:06] cut up but like a puzzle I can just flip
[1:44:10] over a few pieces and try to put them
[1:44:12] together for you there's a much bigger
[1:44:14] picture than this God's Word had no
[1:44:19] beginning and it'll have no end but what
[1:44:23] about the Bible brother it's only 2,000
[1:44:25] years old oh I'm not talking about that
[1:44:27] word I'm talking about the Word made
[1:44:31] flesh and dwelt amongst us the action of
[1:44:35] God's Word that's what we're interested
[1:44:38] in brothers
[1:44:39] not just the education of God's Word
[1:44:42] let's pray father we realize Lord that
[1:44:48] it's not easy father to be able to for
[1:44:51] me at least father to be able to bring
[1:44:54] eternal thoughts down into a point in
[1:44:57] time Lord but father if we could just
[1:45:00] shed a little light father upon the
[1:45:04] words that you have spoken Lord so that
[1:45:06] we could see ourselves in the reflection
[1:45:09] Lord right now we're we're just seeing
[1:45:11] ourselves as a shadow of a shadow the
[1:45:15] prophet of God taught us as that shadow
[1:45:17] gets closer to the light we began to see
[1:45:21] the outline of its image we began to
[1:45:23] understand just kind of what object it
[1:45:26] is Lord but we're given to recognize
[1:45:31] father through the message of the hour
[1:45:32] that we're not just to stay a shadow but
[1:45:37] Lord were to become the light as you are
[1:45:40] the light because you're the father of
[1:45:43] lights Lord we believe that with all our
[1:45:46] hearts father we realize Lord that the
[1:45:49] Bible tells us that we become the light
[1:45:53] as we walk in it Lord I pray father that
[1:45:57] you'd bless your children and their
[1:45:58] efforts this morning father for for
[1:46:00] putting up with me Lord and and the
[1:46:03] broken words but we realize father that
[1:46:06] your body was broken for a reason Lord
[1:46:08] and we can just take one portion of it
[1:46:11] at a time when we serve the Lord's
[1:46:13] Supper father realizing that that kosher
[1:46:15] bread is not the literal body of Christ
[1:46:18] Lord then neither are these letters on
[1:46:20] these pages but there is a mystical body
[1:46:22] of Christ that's developing from them
[1:46:25] Lord and we realize it's the truth
[1:46:28] father give strength and encouragement
[1:46:31] to your children father as we move
[1:46:33] forward we'll be sure to give you the
[1:46:35] honor and the glory in the praise in the
[1:46:37] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:42] amen God's children said again
