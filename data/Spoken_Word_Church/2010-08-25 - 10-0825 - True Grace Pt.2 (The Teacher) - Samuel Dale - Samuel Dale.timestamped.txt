[32:36] let's start with verse 1.
[32:42] but speak now the things which become
[32:44] sound doctrine
[32:46] now that's what i'm trying to do because
[32:49] now remember i told you

[32:56] after preaching the series of the second
[32:59] coming i was not dropping back

[33:05] things that we're climbing higher into
[33:09] of the things that you know have already
[33:12] been spoken but yet
[33:14] we need a revelation
[33:16] all right
[33:17] but speak to other things which becomes
[33:19] sound doctrine
[33:20] that the aids men be sober grave
[33:22] temperate sound and faith and charity
[33:25] and patience the age women likewise that
[33:27] they be in behavior has become holiness
[33:30] not false accusers not given to much
[33:32] wine teachers
[33:34] of good things that they may teach the
[33:37] young women to be sober to love their
[33:40] husbands to love their children
[33:43] to be discreet chaste
[33:45] keepers at home good
[33:48] obedient to their own husbands that the
[33:51] word of god be not blasphemed
[33:54] young men likewise exhort to be sober
[33:56] minded
[33:57] and in all things show thyself a pattern
[33:59] of good
[34:00] works in doctrine showing
[34:02] uncorruptedness
[34:06] gravity sincerity
[34:09] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[34:12] and he that is of the contrary part may
[34:14] be ashamed
[34:15] having no evil thing to say of you cena
[34:18] this is getting down to speaking to
[34:20] somebody that's getting anchored real
[34:22] good right
[34:25] exhort servants to be obedient unto
[34:27] their own masters and to please them
[34:29] well in all things not answering again
[34:32] not for prolonging which is meaning
[34:35] really to steal
[34:36] or to divide you know like something
[34:39] like that or to be to embezzle is a word
[34:41] for prolonging so not prolonging but
[34:44] showing all good fidelity
[34:47] that they may adore all may adorn
[34:50] the doctrine of god our savior in all
[34:53] things now
[34:54] for the grace of god that bring us
[34:56] salvation hath appeared to all men
[35:00] true grace now true understanding
[35:02] teaching us
[35:05] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[35:07] lust we should live soberly righteously
[35:10] and godly in this present world looking
[35:12] for that blessed hope in the gracious
[35:15] appearing of the great god in our savior
[35:18] jesus christ who gave himself for us
[35:21] that he might redeem us from all
[35:23] iniquity and purify unto himself
[35:27] a peculiar people zealous of good works
[35:30] these things speak and exhort and rebuke
[35:33] with all authority let no man despise
[35:36] thee you may be seated the lord add his
[35:38] blessing
[35:39] to the reading of the word now we're
[35:41] going to try to speak on
[35:44] we're still on the subject that we were
[35:47] sunday afternoon
[35:50] and i just titled it there uh true grace
[35:53] you know to where we would have a title
[35:54] for the message
[35:55] and uh
[35:57] we're trying to go through a part and i
[35:58] want to carry that on tonight
[36:01] but
[36:02] we were covering now that
[36:04] true grace
[36:06] all right
[36:07] now
[36:09] grace is the hardest thing
[36:12] to preach
[36:14] to hold in the line of being correct
[36:18] throughout the word of god
[36:21] throughout the prophet's message
[36:23] throughout time throughout uh doings
[36:26] because
[36:27] uh grace i guess is one of the most
[36:31] uh talked about
[36:33] uh doctrines
[36:36] all right but it's also one of the most
[36:38] um
[36:40] used wrong you know
[36:43] and and all as to uh people use it to to
[36:48] you know
[36:49] um back up their own site things and
[36:51] doings and
[36:53] and uh you know
[36:54] but still that doesn't change it
[36:58] because we found out there in the
[36:59] scripture that you're saved by grace
[37:03] but there's more to go with it there in
[37:05] ephesians two right
[37:07] it says we're saved by grace
[37:09] through faith
[37:12] you say oh we're just saved by grace
[37:14] will everybody in the world now i hope
[37:16] you understood that sunday if you didn't
[37:18] hear it please listen to it
[37:21] the everybody in the world is saved
[37:23] today
[37:24] when jesus christ died at calvary
[37:26] brother brown said every person that was
[37:27] in the world was saved right
[37:31] now are you going to say he was wrong
[37:33] no no he was right
[37:37] because the scripture said i gave them
[37:38] to you that's what was preaching on
[37:40] sunday romans 6 and 10. that he died
[37:42] once for all
[37:44] he didn't die two times
[37:47] so there's not a grace that's for the
[37:48] bride
[37:51] a grace for the foolish virgins so we'd
[37:54] say you know
[37:56] just making categories you know
[37:58] a grace for the jews
[38:02] it was all done at calvary
[38:07] you know
[38:08] he didn't do a little extra for you and
[38:10] i
[38:12] he done it all account for it
[38:15] he paid the price
[38:17] and everybody in the world
[38:20] was saved that day
[38:23] but they wouldn't accept it right
[38:26] so we're going on what is true grace
[38:29] so what's the problem
[38:32] well brother dale i just don't
[38:33] understand how you could say everybody
[38:34] would say i didn't the bible says it and
[38:37] the prophet said it
[38:39] you argue with god about it
[38:41] he died once for all
[38:44] all right
[38:45] now if we if we don't accept it
[38:50] it can't be applied right right
[38:54] right now and we don't accept it right
[38:57] it's not for us so we're the one that
[39:00] determines it right
[39:02] yeah
[39:05] but i want to illustrate something to
[39:07] you but what i want to do is i want to
[39:09] read what i wrote down to you to work
[39:12] that let's get your mind into what i'm
[39:14] talking about
[39:18] so make sure you understand what i'm
[39:20] saying all right right
[39:22] now the bible says the prophet says
[39:25] that
[39:26] we're saved by grace
[39:28] amen
[39:30] and everybody in the world was saved at
[39:32] calvary amen
[39:34] but it cannot be applied
[39:38] because it won't accept it
[39:41] a pardon is not a pardon unless received
[39:44] is one we'll get to that in a minute
[39:46] right
[39:47] if you don't accept it
[39:50] it's not for you
[39:53] but see it's not a situation that you
[39:55] say well i didn't accept it but one of
[39:57] these days i want to accept it
[40:00] are you saying that he's going to have
[40:02] to go back
[40:03] to calvary pay the price for you
[40:06] to be able to
[40:08] send you grace
[40:11] no there's something wrong with your men
[40:12] lexi
[40:14] it's it's not that away
[40:16] but
[40:17] now listen
[40:19] well brother adam brother
[40:21] you ought to say it for myself make the
[40:23] statement but brother dale then if grace
[40:26] is
[40:26] unmerited favor
[40:29] and that's what it is right
[40:32] grace is not something that if you do
[40:35] anything
[40:38] and you think that that merits you
[40:40] anything
[40:41] then jesus christ didn't die for you
[40:46] if you think that you were so good
[40:51] what about the rich young ruler amen
[40:56] what about the rich young ruler standing
[40:58] there with the lord jesus
[41:01] have you done this have you done that
[41:03] he said i've done all these things
[41:06] i kept everything from my youth
[41:11] and you know what the bible said jesus
[41:13] loved him
[41:15] why because he knew he told the truth
[41:18] right
[41:20] he could look down through and see that
[41:22] he told the truth
[41:24] he loved him
[41:26] but see none of that saved him
[41:31] so he knew where his problem was so
[41:33] what'd he say
[41:36] and once
[41:37] if he said
[41:38] come follow me
[41:42] maybe the rich young ruler would have
[41:43] put all his money into the work
[41:45] and they would have had millions of
[41:47] dollars for great campaigns you know
[41:51] he might have done it
[41:56] but jesus knew where to hit him
[42:00] he didn't ask him to give him all of his
[42:02] money
[42:04] he would have probably gave him a great
[42:05] offering
[42:08] because he knew to do those times
[42:12] he said go say what you got and give it
[42:14] to the poor
[42:17] didn't come and follow me
[42:20] so he knew exactly where he was at right
[42:23] he knew he wouldn't follow him because
[42:25] of that situation
[42:28] but now
[42:31] think about it
[42:34] do we really believe that grace is
[42:36] unmerited favor
[42:43] and if it is
[42:45] then why is not everybody in the world
[42:48] safe right
[42:53] i'm trying to get you to think
[42:59] it graces unmerited favor
[43:05] and you cannot do anything to merit it
[43:09] or it would not be grace
[43:12] why is it that everybody's not saved
[43:18] why is it that
[43:20] you know
[43:21] well the price is paid everything's done
[43:25] finished
[43:26] jesus died
[43:28] it's for everybody we just all go into
[43:30] heaven
[43:35] because we won't accept it
[43:38] right now that's
[43:41] hard to think it
[43:42] right
[43:43] i remember reading one time about
[43:46] a guy standing out on the street corner
[43:48] trying to and it's not this new fancy
[43:50] five dollar bill you got it's because it
[43:52] don't even look like play money to me
[43:55] but
[43:56] they still use it
[43:57] but i remember reading about a guy
[43:59] standing on the street corner trying to
[44:01] give away five dollar bills
[44:03] and he was just you know handling i want
[44:04] to give them to you
[44:06] you know what nobody wouldn't take one
[44:12] they thought there was some gimmick
[44:16] some
[44:17] thing you know
[44:19] that was trying to take place
[44:23] oh no we don't want to take that that
[44:24] might be counterfeit if i wind up with
[44:26] counterfeit
[44:27] you know
[44:30] but now
[44:31] think of the situation
[44:33] if grace is unmerited favor
[44:37] then why is it that all are not saved
[44:45] the price is paid
[44:47] everything was done
[44:51] but you see everybody won't accept it
[44:54] because of some
[44:56] reason
[44:58] some problems from something
[45:01] they won't accept it
[45:07] it's hard to
[45:08] tell the truth
[45:11] because there's so many perversions
[45:14] of truth
[45:16] until it's hard to really tell truth and
[45:18] get people to believe it right
[45:21] i'll get on to it in a few weeks or
[45:23] wherever when i can
[45:25] but
[45:27] the bible says we're just as perfect as
[45:29] god
[45:30] is but do we believe it
[45:34] oh yeah we can explain it
[45:39] but has it been revealed to us
[45:44] what that means
[45:47] i was asking terrence something coming
[45:48] down going down the road there the other
[45:50] day i asked my wife about it
[45:54] you know you you hear a lot of people
[45:55] preach about it that's fine i know it i
[45:57] know it's right
[46:00] but what does it mean when you say that
[46:02] if you think your brother has ought
[46:04] against you
[46:08] to go lay down your offering and don't
[46:10] try to offer it
[46:11] and go get it right
[46:14] what does that mean
[46:18] everybody's got a definition then
[46:23] but when brother branham was preaching
[46:25] to 300 ministers
[46:27] about the baptism in the name of the
[46:29] lord jesus christ
[46:30] and the biggest portion got up and
[46:32] walked out and those that
[46:34] didn't turn around and wouldn't even
[46:36] ever come and get baptized
[46:39] did he go to every one of them to try to
[46:40] get them all straightened out
[46:49] when he preached at the tabernacle or
[46:51] anywhere
[46:53] don't you know that there was a lot of
[46:55] people
[46:57] was offended at him
[47:00] a lot of people had ought against him
[47:04] did he go to them to straighten it
[47:09] i out i'm just serious i i like to see
[47:12] things you know
[47:13] to where i can understand it
[47:17] what does that scripture mean
[47:23] is it that if you tell somebody the
[47:25] truth and they get offended at you are
[47:26] you supposed to hunt them all over the
[47:28] world or try to
[47:31] straighten it up
[47:36] what does that mean
[47:39] well brought it to me no so you got your
[47:41] own self-interpreted
[47:43] answer
[47:47] and see i just gave you two or three
[47:49] illustrations
[47:50] and a lot more could be given to cover
[47:52] the point
[47:54] of do we know what that means
[47:58] or is it whatever our eyes see and we
[48:00] look at
[48:02] now i want to try to illustrate great
[48:04] sweetie
[48:06] i gave you a little picture
[48:09] then later on the
[48:10] picture they can see up there
[48:12] i'll hold it hoping it comes in
[48:15] those that are on internet
[48:17] we have a piece of paper with
[48:19] the letter g-o-d-i-s-n-o-w
[48:23] h-e-r-e
[48:27] all together
[48:29] okay dick put it up there we're gonna do
[48:31] it thank you
[48:32] okay
[48:33] now
[48:35] what does that mean
[48:44] see
[48:45] if you do it this way
[48:51] that's right
[48:54] it says god is nowhere
[48:57] i'll hold that up a little closer what i
[48:59] said
[49:00] that's just the way it looks you know
[49:02] which one are we looking at
[49:04] according to where you put the lines on
[49:06] the word
[49:10] well
[49:11] now brother dale
[49:13] it's not god is no where
[49:18] it's god is now here right
[49:24] you know i didn't change the letter
[49:25] that's right
[49:28] bring it over here where they see it
[49:30] all right
[49:31] he said god is now here
[49:34] right
[49:39] he said well what's that got to do with
[49:41] grace
[49:42] that's what i just asked you a simple
[49:43] question
[49:46] if grace is unmerited favor
[49:49] why is it that every person in the world
[49:53] will not be saved
[49:58] when the price was paid amen
[50:01] for it to be done right
[50:09] now we all baptist we had it figured out
[50:13] that it was called once saved always
[50:15] saved
[50:20] right
[50:23] once saved always saved right right
[50:31] huh we look down and say no that's not
[50:33] right
[50:37] but you tell me it's not right
[50:40] because if you're once saved you're
[50:42] always saved right right amen
[50:46] right
[50:48] now i didn't change the words
[50:54] right
[50:55] you see we think we know what we're
[50:57] talking about
[50:58] and then we condemn a lot of people for
[51:00] what they're saying when they come find
[51:02] out they're saying the same thing he
[51:04] says according to where they put in the
[51:05] line they have to divide the
[51:11] but if you're truly born again right and
[51:14] that's the only way you can ever be
[51:16] saved is to be born again right
[51:19] then you're always born again that's
[51:20] right
[51:23] but now then if you turn around and you
[51:25] say
[51:26] well then was the baptist right when
[51:28] they said
[51:29] once saved always saved
[51:33] okay
[51:35] now what do you mean that's right
[51:39] i heard your words i got the letters on
[51:41] the page i got it all figured out right
[51:44] but now what did you mean all right
[51:46] brother asked brother dick one night
[51:48] time like that i got some tickles
[51:50] cause he said
[51:51] i heard you but now what are you what
[51:52] are you saying that's right i know hey
[51:55] good point
[51:56] that's right
[52:00] see when you go to the end of the
[52:02] statement of
[52:03] once saved always saved
[52:07] and you say
[52:09] that i have received the baptism of the
[52:11] holy ghost and you birthed into my heart
[52:13] and i now have eternal life right
[52:18] and i can never be lost that's right
[52:21] well you know that's true that's right
[52:23] right
[52:26] but
[52:27] another person gets up and says
[52:30] but what i'm saying is
[52:33] once saved always saved
[52:35] it don't matter what i do
[52:40] i'm saved
[52:44] yeah
[52:45] you know they're quoting scriptures
[52:51] you know they're telling truth
[52:55] not the truth but they're telling truth
[53:00] because they're
[53:01] you say what
[53:02] well i'll just say the same thing you're
[53:04] saying
[53:07] no because you said it didn't make no
[53:08] difference what i'd done
[53:11] because now you've got from genesis to
[53:14] revelation to come back at you like i
[53:16] was trying to bring about sunday
[53:17] afternoon there on the message of grace
[53:21] but you can take it you can make it
[53:23] disgrace
[53:26] or you can make it true christ
[53:30] and it's all the only difference is a
[53:32] revelation
[53:34] right the only difference is the letters
[53:36] amen and where you know the divide to
[53:38] say
[53:39] god is now here right
[53:47] now you come to an understanding right
[53:52] why would god condemn a
[53:54] man if god was the one that said you're
[53:57] saved by grace right
[54:02] how can he be a just god
[54:07] and condemn someone
[54:13] when he said they're saved
[54:17] now are you thinking
[54:26] see
[54:27] true grace
[54:29] lord william we'll get that sunday and
[54:31] say well just little simple thoughts
[54:33] cause i'm trying to take them just a
[54:34] little you know alone
[54:37] and uh
[54:38] i want to ask you sunday just what he's
[54:40] saying
[54:45] well i got a blackboard coach
[54:50] but what he's seeing
[54:53] brother branham do you ever see him he
[54:54] said sin every day
[54:56] amen
[55:03] but then he could could have easily
[55:04] turned around and said
[55:06] show me where i've ever disbelieved the
[55:08] word
[55:10] right
[55:12] but you see i'm trying to get you to
[55:13] think about something
[55:16] do we understand grace
[55:19] we just understand
[55:21] the quotes the scriptures the
[55:24] the things
[55:28] how can it be that grace would be
[55:31] unmerited favor but yet you can grow in
[55:33] grace
[55:35] because that's what scripture says
[55:39] you can grow in grace and knowledge
[55:46] all
[55:46] right
[55:48] you see
[55:50] people will not accept
[55:54] the true understanding of grace
[55:58] because of
[56:00] the way they've been taught
[56:04] you know
[56:05] former background of teachings
[56:10] or maybe even because of
[56:12] a certain person saying it
[56:17] come on you know
[56:20] you've heard the story about the guy
[56:21] overseas his wife wrote him a letter
[56:23] sonny tell him honey i need some money
[56:25] send it to me now
[56:31] i'll tell you what
[56:33] so we finally decided i need to maybe
[56:34] let somebody else read the letter
[56:37] somebody else read the letter and what
[56:38] to say he said honey
[56:40] it's bad shape i need some money now
[56:43] he said she's changed her mind now i'll
[56:46] send it to him
[56:51] no same words
[56:54] it was his mind
[56:56] amen that's right now how many times
[57:00] have you read
[57:02] and swore that the bible says
[57:05] the correct way to baptize is the name
[57:07] of father son and holy ghost
[57:10] matthew 28 19 right
[57:14] baptized in the name of the father and
[57:16] of son of the holy cups right
[57:23] but then you come along and you finally
[57:24] catch the truth about it
[57:27] and you find out that nobody's ever
[57:28] baptized that away in the bible right
[57:31] right and it was never baptized that
[57:33] away until the catholic church come
[57:34] along and picked it up right and turned
[57:37] it there about 325 along in there and
[57:40] they begin to baptize in the name of the
[57:43] father and of the son of the holy ghost
[57:44] when nobody in the bible's ever baptized
[57:46] except in the name of the lord jesus
[57:48] christ
[57:48] we're going to have a baptism a couple
[57:50] of weekends so from now not this coming
[57:52] weekend probably the next one so if
[57:53] anybody wants to get baptized we're
[57:55] going to have a baptismal service
[57:58] now
[57:59] but
[58:03] you see people will say
[58:04] i'm saying just what the bible says
[58:12] it says repent every one of you and be
[58:14] baptized in the
[58:16] name of the father and the son and the
[58:18] holy god
[58:25] and you know we're saying verbatim what
[58:27] the word says
[58:31] but then we find out that nobody in the
[58:33] bible was ever baptized father son and
[58:35] holy god
[58:37] and until the catholic church come along
[58:38] and change it and we got documents right
[58:40] out of your own encyclopedias that you
[58:42] got in your home to show you where they
[58:44] changed it at and things like that but
[58:45] i'm not arguing with nobody about that
[58:47] i'm just trying to make a point right
[58:52] you see when you see it and you know the
[58:54] truth then
[58:55] and you get baptized in the name of the
[58:57] lord jesus christ
[59:00] because that's where they baptize in the
[59:02] name of the lord jesus or the name of
[59:03] jesus christ
[59:05] in the bible
[59:07] and you baptize in the name of the lord
[59:09] jesus christ what are you doing you're
[59:10] full of fulfilling exactly what matthew
[59:12] said that's right baptized in the name
[59:14] of the father and of the son of the holy
[59:16] ghost right father son holy god lord
[59:19] jesus christ right
[59:21] now you got it
[59:23] but if you got it like i heard some
[59:25] people one day talking and as a matter
[59:27] of fact it was a preacher
[59:29] preaching about it he said
[59:33] we take
[59:35] acts 2 38 for our baptism
[59:39] he said with them denominations they
[59:41] take matthew 28 19 for the urge
[59:43] and i sat there and thought how
[59:46] spiritually ignorant man are you
[59:51] matthew 28 19 is bible right
[59:57] acts 2 38 is bible right
[1:00:00] and you're saying that one of them is
[1:00:02] good and the other one ain't
[1:00:06] one's right nothing's wrong
[1:00:11] all right you get the background enough
[1:00:12] to know what i'm saying about grace amen
[1:00:17] what is grace well it's just american
[1:00:19] favor
[1:00:24] yeah
[1:00:25] and everybody in the world was saved at
[1:00:27] calvary
[1:00:29] if
[1:00:30] they'll accept it
[1:00:33] because a pardon
[1:00:35] is not a pardon
[1:00:36] and i didn't give these to you because
[1:00:38] anybody knows these but just a few goes
[1:00:40] with it
[1:00:41] that i want to read
[1:00:43] that what the prophet had to say about
[1:00:45] it
[1:00:50] this is off with a message here you him
[1:00:52] 1956
[1:00:55] 11.
[1:00:57] pardon is not a pardon if it's not
[1:00:58] received as a pardon
[1:01:00] and god's pardon and grace
[1:01:03] divine healing is the property of every
[1:01:05] believer
[1:01:07] if it's received is that
[1:01:10] but if it's turned down then it's of no
[1:01:12] effect
[1:01:13] god is not guilty
[1:01:16] because he offered
[1:01:18] it to you
[1:01:22] behold it greater than solomon is here
[1:01:24] 62
[1:01:25] 612.
[1:01:28] pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[1:01:30] accepted as a pardon
[1:01:32] so that's the way god's word is
[1:01:35] it's the word of god to all those who
[1:01:38] will accept it as the word of god
[1:01:42] if it's not well then it isn't
[1:01:47] right so if you accept it to be the word
[1:01:49] of god
[1:01:50] it's the word of god but if you think it
[1:01:52] was a man that wrote that
[1:01:56] and man did right
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:02] man pinned it down
[1:02:07] but he couldn't
[1:02:08] say anything other than what god said
[1:02:11] pardon in 1963 10 28
[1:02:14] he talked about it god gives us all
[1:02:16] things and he gives us a pardon it's a
[1:02:18] pardon to those who want to accept god's
[1:02:19] word as a pardon
[1:02:21] put it on it just to read it just to
[1:02:23] read it it doesn't mean that you're
[1:02:24] pardoned
[1:02:26] it means that you've got to accept it as
[1:02:29] your pardon
[1:02:30] that god gave his son to die in your
[1:02:32] stead and then it's a pardon
[1:02:35] see so it's not a part
[1:02:39] yet the paper says pardoned
[1:02:43] you know
[1:02:46] but it's not unless you accept it
[1:02:49] release from guilt is what we wish to
[1:02:51] place on this
[1:02:53] or pardon from god is a release from
[1:02:55] guilt
[1:02:58] not that turning away by a psychological
[1:03:00] doctrine of some sort
[1:03:02] that might in some way give you a little
[1:03:04] feeling that you have done what's right
[1:03:07] by joining church or taking up some
[1:03:09] creed
[1:03:10] but it's a release from your guilt by
[1:03:11] the power of
[1:03:12] calvary
[1:03:14] something has released you
[1:03:17] there's no more guilt the bible said i
[1:03:18] believe in romans 5 1 there is therefore
[1:03:20] now no condemnation in them there and in
[1:03:22] christ jesus who walk after not after
[1:03:24] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:03:27] but you see
[1:03:29] then sunday i was trying to explain it
[1:03:32] that
[1:03:34] if you do get born again
[1:03:37] because you're saved by grace through
[1:03:39] faith
[1:03:40] the salvations of the lord jonah 2 and 9
[1:03:42] oblivion
[1:03:44] but when you get saved
[1:03:49] that statements that i made will
[1:03:50] automatically do away with but it don't
[1:03:52] matter what i do
[1:03:54] right
[1:03:56] one
[1:03:58] when you get born again
[1:04:01] your christian journey is based upon
[1:04:06] you
[1:04:07] walking in god's word right
[1:04:10] now
[1:04:11] all right let's keep it straight
[1:04:14] if you're truly born again yes
[1:04:18] you are
[1:04:20] going to be saved right
[1:04:23] but if you're truly saved then why would
[1:04:25] you want to live like anything else
[1:04:26] other than being saved
[1:04:31] listening the other night brother brown
[1:04:32] said
[1:04:34] luther and talked about wesleyan all the
[1:04:35] images he said they all had a
[1:04:37] pentecostal experience
[1:04:40] they did
[1:04:41] sure did neutral spoken tongues i've
[1:04:43] done everything
[1:04:47] they ever born again believer that's
[1:04:48] ever been born again had a pentecostal
[1:04:50] experience right amen don't mess me a
[1:04:53] pentecostal i'll have you to know i'm
[1:04:56] right bless him
[1:05:00] well if you ever are what and will be
[1:05:03] can be someday will be whatever if you
[1:05:06] are five you are you have had a
[1:05:08] pentecostal experience that's right by
[1:05:10] the new birth amen
[1:05:12] because there's only one new birth right
[1:05:15] and that's the birth of the word amen
[1:05:20] so then if we don't accept the pardon
[1:05:26] what have we done
[1:05:29] we've turned the grace of god the
[1:05:31] scripture says
[1:05:32] into lasciviousness
[1:05:36] to believe a lie and be damned by it
[1:05:39] now that's scripture
[1:05:44] you see a pardon is not a pardon unless
[1:05:46] received is one
[1:05:48] now what i want you to see is one thing
[1:05:54] the only way that i can tie grace
[1:05:57] together i've got a lot of scriptures in
[1:05:58] here about grace and the things that it
[1:06:00] says you know
[1:06:02] but um
[1:06:06] the only way i tie all the bible
[1:06:08] together about grace
[1:06:10] is is one way
[1:06:14] grace is not a doctrine
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:19] he said well it's the oldest one has
[1:06:20] ever preached right because it wasn't
[1:06:22] started for the foundation world yes we
[1:06:24] know that
[1:06:25] but it's not a doctrine it's a person
[1:06:31] see that way it can fit all the bible
[1:06:34] grace is a person
[1:06:36] the person
[1:06:39] of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:42] that's why when you're born again you
[1:06:44] receive the new birth which is the life
[1:06:46] of christ
[1:06:49] and by receiving that new birth
[1:06:51] then is christ living in you
[1:06:59] but you see we think that we just get
[1:07:01] you know like the people said to run
[1:07:03] around we'll run around if i believed it
[1:07:04] that way i i just
[1:07:06] i just lived like that he said i live
[1:07:09] like i want to right now
[1:07:14] said i do
[1:07:19] people don't like you to make statements
[1:07:20] sometimes because they don't a lot of
[1:07:22] those out there don't understand you but
[1:07:23] you know i drink all the liquor i want
[1:07:29] you know what's so amazing i've been
[1:07:30] drinking when i was a sinner
[1:07:35] i don't want to drink it
[1:07:40] well you just never did drink it
[1:07:43] i'll agree with you
[1:07:45] i'm glad i did
[1:07:49] thank god for that point
[1:07:51] don't make me any different because it
[1:07:53] took just as much grace to save me as it
[1:07:56] does to save the dirty stinkiness person
[1:07:59] in the world that has ever been
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:03] because we've got to go back to grace
[1:08:06] but if grace is a person that's revealed
[1:08:08] to you
[1:08:10] then
[1:08:11] how could we ever have any thought or
[1:08:13] concept in our mind why would we even in
[1:08:16] any mental form
[1:08:18] ever think of
[1:08:20] i can just go do what i want to
[1:08:29] any
[1:08:30] reason for that to be in your mind
[1:08:32] i'll tell you up front it sure ain't god
[1:08:35] all right so then there's one other guy
[1:08:37] talking
[1:08:39] and that's the devil
[1:08:42] so it's certainly not god telling you
[1:08:43] that
[1:08:47] all right
[1:08:51] see but we
[1:08:53] we get the idea and we can't straighten
[1:08:55] it out in our minds
[1:08:57] and that's where our trouble comes it we
[1:08:59] we we we get it all messed up and and
[1:09:02] and then the devil comes along says well
[1:09:03] what about this what about that well
[1:09:05] what about this and what about that
[1:09:08] and then you just
[1:09:10] you just
[1:09:11] your brain's gone
[1:09:14] why because you can't talk to the devil
[1:09:15] about a revelation
[1:09:18] that's right you got a whole lot more
[1:09:21] quotes than you got
[1:09:25] and a lot more talking to you
[1:09:27] you make it sound more beautiful
[1:09:29] but when you try to tell the devil that
[1:09:31] a grace is a person
[1:09:35] it's not a concept or a thought
[1:09:38] see he doesn't know what in the world
[1:09:40] you're talking about
[1:09:43] because he's built upon the fact like
[1:09:45] the pharisees
[1:09:48] paul said
[1:09:50] that he lived a perfect life
[1:09:53] under the law he did
[1:09:56] under the law paul was living a perfect
[1:09:59] life he didn't do what he's supposed to
[1:10:02] didn't do and he done what he's supposed
[1:10:03] to do
[1:10:05] and there was no condemnation
[1:10:11] but one day a person came present
[1:10:16] isn't that what paul says he said the
[1:10:18] things i've done i thought was right
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:23] he said i thought it was right because i
[1:10:25] followed what the word said
[1:10:28] he said one day the word came to me
[1:10:30] and i found out
[1:10:33] the things that i thought was right i
[1:10:35] count them down
[1:10:39] he's seen what
[1:10:41] was happening to mankind
[1:10:43] and try to explain it to us
[1:10:47] and show us what real true grace is
[1:10:53] well i got this quote here i got this
[1:10:54] quote sir okay
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:58] but what about the rest of the message
[1:11:01] what about the rest of the bible
[1:11:05] you bring anything to me on grace while
[1:11:07] i'm into this you bring anything to me
[1:11:10] and show me where that i'm not bringing
[1:11:11] it correctly
[1:11:16] and if you can't then you need to shut
[1:11:17] your mouth and believe it
[1:11:20] and start practicing it
[1:11:23] you say well you shouldn't be that way
[1:11:25] why not
[1:11:27] i ain't mean you if you said that
[1:11:34] because if you're saying it right i
[1:11:35] ain't mean
[1:11:40] but now listen
[1:11:44] see then if it's unmerited favor
[1:11:47] why would the prophet talk about
[1:11:51] if you send us in as a christian
[1:11:54] you're going to rip the washed up for
[1:12:01] if it's just a license to
[1:12:04] do anything we want to do
[1:12:06] you know living life
[1:12:10] and we call it grace
[1:12:12] then what does the scripture say
[1:12:18] and it's over in the uh
[1:12:21] what where my notes really find it
[1:12:24] where is it
[1:12:27] i lost it somewhere somebody signed it
[1:12:29] for me where was it peter
[1:12:32] that said
[1:12:46] no no that's that's not what i'm getting
[1:12:48] at the one i'm getting is is worth you
[1:12:50] whatever you sow you're gonna reap right
[1:12:55] i'll find it turn a minute in the
[1:12:56] scripture but you know it's true
[1:13:00] and it was in the new testament under
[1:13:01] the disciples writings
[1:13:07] you said well
[1:13:09] brother dale that's what i understand
[1:13:11] you're explaining them perfectly
[1:13:13] explained i'm not perfect
[1:13:18] no i didn't say that
[1:13:24] where'd you get the idea i said that
[1:13:31] because the bible says
[1:13:33] that i'm perfect
[1:13:38] well i just can't believe i'm not
[1:13:40] perfect i'm forgiven
[1:13:43] well then we found out that if you're
[1:13:46] forgiven
[1:13:47] that means you was totally wiped out
[1:13:50] what you've done
[1:13:51] so you're not guilty
[1:13:55] you see
[1:13:59] have we been released from guilt by the
[1:14:01] revelation of grace
[1:14:06] or is it give us a book of rules to have
[1:14:08] to live by
[1:14:10] that's why i don't preach like these
[1:14:11] other preachers do and i'm sorry i know
[1:14:13] i'm just not a i'm not a good
[1:14:14] old-fashioned pastor i don't preach
[1:14:17] every service on women's dress and
[1:14:18] hiring clothes and men's hiring shorts
[1:14:21] and all this thing
[1:14:23] why because if you can't have a if
[1:14:25] you're a born-again
[1:14:26] christian you tell me where you can live
[1:14:30] any life outside of the life of christ
[1:14:32] with a born-again christian i'm going to
[1:14:34] tell you you're not born again
[1:14:37] now is that as blunt as i can be
[1:14:40] that's right if you think that it's
[1:14:43] anything you've done or didn't do that
[1:14:45] saves you you're lost
[1:14:49] because you're still in the trap of the
[1:14:50] devil right you turn the grace of god
[1:14:53] into lasciviousness
[1:15:04] when god has god revealed to you that
[1:15:07] you've been pardoned
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:15] hey man well then is he happening
[1:15:19] you're not pardoned right
[1:15:26] you mean i'm lost
[1:15:27] i didn't say it
[1:15:30] right why did you
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:35] that's what people do you know you're
[1:15:37] talking to them about about the lord and
[1:15:38] the message of the hour or something
[1:15:40] they say you mean my mama wouldn't say
[1:15:43] well i don't doubt your mama she was a
[1:15:44] good person you must doubt it
[1:15:50] why don't you bring it up
[1:15:52] you got something a little click in your
[1:15:54] mind that maybe she wasn't saved
[1:15:56] because i didn't say she wouldn't
[1:15:58] because she was in a different time than
[1:16:00] what you're in
[1:16:02] that's right
[1:16:04] but has he revealed to you that you've
[1:16:06] been pardoned
[1:16:08] from your past sins
[1:16:16] but just
[1:16:18] remember don't ever think
[1:16:23] see and watch me going one way going
[1:16:24] right back the other one in a hurry oh
[1:16:26] but don't you ever think that you're
[1:16:28] pardoned from anything you could ever do
[1:16:30] right or ever will do
[1:16:36] now don't make god's grace a blanket
[1:16:40] that has thrown over something
[1:16:44] because it's what mankind does
[1:16:49] grace is a person and must be revealed
[1:17:01] listen to these you've heard the prophet
[1:17:02] say these things
[1:17:04] god keeps his word 57 407.
[1:17:10] he says you're going out and
[1:17:12] he said and you say lord i'm sorry
[1:17:18] said you're going to get a whipping fart
[1:17:21] in other words you've done something
[1:17:22] wrong
[1:17:23] and then you say well lord i'm sorry
[1:17:28] you see that's what we do with our kids
[1:17:29] though you know the kids go do something
[1:17:31] and you you know they learn real quickly
[1:17:33] say please
[1:17:34] or i'm sorry
[1:17:38] that's right they learn it because they
[1:17:41] know they're gonna use it
[1:17:46] and they go do something and you start
[1:17:48] to word them and they say i'm sorry
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:53] and you know they'll even get smart
[1:17:55] enough to be able to quote brother dale
[1:17:59] they'll say brother dale said if you ask
[1:18:02] for forgiveness you've got to forgive
[1:18:03] them
[1:18:05] and i ask you to forgive me
[1:18:09] i'm sorry
[1:18:17] now why you gonna do it
[1:18:21] because the next time they do it they're
[1:18:22] gonna say what i'm sorry
[1:18:26] and after a while they're gonna learn to
[1:18:27] say
[1:18:28] i wrote a note while ago i know i was
[1:18:30] gonna go do wrong and i wrote a note
[1:18:31] saying i'm sorry
[1:18:33] you said you can't do that now the
[1:18:34] catholics do it all the time
[1:18:37] come on i'm not throwing off on them
[1:18:38] because that's no difference but they do
[1:18:41] right
[1:18:42] they give you a right to go down and pay
[1:18:44] the priest for your sin you're going to
[1:18:46] commit
[1:18:48] before you commit them that's right
[1:18:52] what's that big old word for me
[1:18:56] but listen
[1:18:58] are we pardoned from what we do after we
[1:19:01] become a christian
[1:19:04] you know
[1:19:06] as i'm just asking this question
[1:19:10] after you become a christian are you
[1:19:11] pardoned
[1:19:13] does that pardon me and you can go out
[1:19:14] let's do whatever
[1:19:16] no
[1:19:19] supposing that the guy you know that
[1:19:20] brought random referred to
[1:19:22] that was the one you know where the the
[1:19:24] courts of supreme court said you know
[1:19:26] pardon not apart unless you receive this
[1:19:27] one so let's change the situation just a
[1:19:29] little bit and and the guy goes in and
[1:19:31] gives the man the pardon and he says
[1:19:34] hey that ain't official letterheads and
[1:19:38] papers but is it real
[1:19:40] yeah
[1:19:41] you can go
[1:19:43] you don't have to be shocked
[1:19:55] right i'm gonna carry this piece of
[1:19:56] paper with me and if i ever do that
[1:19:58] again
[1:20:03] i'm gonna pull the paper on you
[1:20:06] see he pardoned me
[1:20:08] now you know that wouldn't be right
[1:20:11] right
[1:20:12] you know that wouldn't do no good
[1:20:15] might get by the first time he's gonna
[1:20:16] get shot second time you know
[1:20:21] because you see
[1:20:22] being a christian don't give you a
[1:20:23] license to steal being a christian gives
[1:20:26] you a strict condemnation in your own
[1:20:28] heart and life for anything you would
[1:20:30] even think about doing
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:39] do you think about it
[1:20:42] see here's where the true revelation
[1:20:43] comes in
[1:20:46] here's what i'm trying to talk to you
[1:20:47] about tonight
[1:20:48] because in titus 2 there we was reading
[1:20:51] and we got down to titus 2 and 12
[1:20:53] and it says
[1:20:55] 11 and 12 says
[1:20:57] grace
[1:21:00] is a teacher
[1:21:07] now if it's a book of rules how can it
[1:21:09] be a teacher
[1:21:12] if it's a concept or a doctor or an idea
[1:21:16] how can it be a teacher
[1:21:22] is that what title said
[1:21:24] let's read it make sure nobody out there
[1:21:25] won't miss it
[1:21:28] what does he say
[1:21:30] for the grace of god that
[1:21:32] bringeth salvation has appeared to all
[1:21:35] men
[1:21:37] teaching us
[1:21:38] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[1:21:41] lust we should live soberly righteously
[1:21:44] and godly in this present world
[1:21:48] can you show me any word in the bible
[1:21:54] show it to me now
[1:21:56] and don't dare come up with some thought
[1:21:58] just put it out there i'm sorry
[1:22:00] maybe i shouldn't say that but
[1:22:03] show me anybody in the bible
[1:22:06] that ever got by with what they've done
[1:22:10] that's right
[1:22:16] well look what david done yeah
[1:22:19] and he faced it all of his life
[1:22:22] and was told that he could not even
[1:22:23] build
[1:22:24] god a house
[1:22:26] to dwell in because of the murder and
[1:22:28] the blood he had on his hands
[1:22:30] but did that lose him no he never lost
[1:22:32] his salvation
[1:22:36] no way
[1:22:40] because if you're truly born again you
[1:22:42] can't lose your salvation
[1:22:44] but why would the bible say that we're
[1:22:47] going to have to give an account of the
[1:22:48] deeds done in the body whether good or
[1:22:50] bad
[1:22:53] now that's not to watch on judgment
[1:22:55] that's the judgment indeed building the
[1:22:57] body where they're good or bad
[1:22:59] why would he put that there
[1:23:01] because we are
[1:23:05] but you know what you're doing
[1:23:09] you're like and i know a man sits up one
[1:23:10] time and i clicked and i knew it was a
[1:23:12] doctor and i went back and checked it
[1:23:15] and it's like i said i'm not throwing
[1:23:16] off on people now i'm just making
[1:23:18] statements
[1:23:19] and you go ask them i'll tell you
[1:23:21] the catholic church teaches you if
[1:23:23] you'll come to them we've got one
[1:23:24] sitting here among us
[1:23:26] that was formally that and should tell
[1:23:28] you in a hurry what i'm fixing to say is
[1:23:29] right that they'd teach you that all
[1:23:31] you've got to do is come and confess to
[1:23:33] them
[1:23:34] and you've done been out living in
[1:23:36] adultery you've been doing all kind of
[1:23:38] things but yet all you've got to do is
[1:23:40] go pay so much money and get to the
[1:23:42] right priest and that priest will take
[1:23:44] and he'll do certain things and he'll
[1:23:46] wave things over you and he'll turn
[1:23:48] around and he'll send you back out of
[1:23:49] there
[1:23:51] not only forgiven
[1:23:53] but he'll restore your virginity
[1:24:00] now that's not no hocus pocus
[1:24:02] ask them
[1:24:04] go very fine brother get you one thank
[1:24:06] you
[1:24:08] they think they have the right to
[1:24:09] restore the virginity
[1:24:14] that's how much power they think they
[1:24:15] have
[1:24:17] no
[1:24:19] girls boys you go out you live in
[1:24:21] adultery you get boys you get a girl
[1:24:23] pregnant you're gonna have to take care
[1:24:24] of that the rest your life
[1:24:26] girls you go out you get pregnant and
[1:24:28] things were and you have a baby you're
[1:24:30] gonna have to take care of the baby the
[1:24:31] rest of your life and every time you
[1:24:33] look at it the devil is gonna tell you
[1:24:35] you was told not to do that you was told
[1:24:37] not to do that you're gonna be tormented
[1:24:39] oh or we'll just go have it aborted then
[1:24:42] you'll be like brother random was
[1:24:43] dealing with that woman that time and
[1:24:45] that lady said she'd lay in her bed at
[1:24:47] night and hear that baby screaming
[1:24:50] screaming
[1:24:52] she what
[1:24:54] what brought him down
[1:24:58] i thought i'd forgive him
[1:25:04] there's where we use it for what we want
[1:25:08] man right here used to go to church here
[1:25:09] priest and said
[1:25:12] that if you've got the new birth that
[1:25:13] covers your marriage and divorce problem
[1:25:15] i differ publicly
[1:25:17] privately and all and don't agree with
[1:25:19] it
[1:25:20] because if that was true why would you
[1:25:22] have to have the grace of marriage and
[1:25:23] divorce to be given the last date by the
[1:25:25] prophet right right amen
[1:25:27] now if he was saying this
[1:25:30] that when your new birth is complete in
[1:25:32] christ and we walk out of here in a
[1:25:34] rapture there's not going to be any
[1:25:36] problems right
[1:25:40] but that evidently wasn't what he's
[1:25:41] talking about
[1:25:45] but that's just what i'm telling you
[1:25:48] people have an idea
[1:25:50] brother i thought you said for me to get
[1:25:52] the new birth did he just wipe off my
[1:25:54] slate clean
[1:25:56] he will and god
[1:26:00] but it won't clean the dirty garments
[1:26:02] that you and i live in
[1:26:05] we'll carry those things all over life
[1:26:09] we've got to pray out for forgiveness
[1:26:12] oh but god forgive me
[1:26:14] when i need to pray all right you know
[1:26:16] for sure then if you're lost
[1:26:18] if you don't think you need to pray
[1:26:22] i've made the statement and always
[1:26:24] misunderstood about it but i say it
[1:26:26] and i still believe it
[1:26:28] i drove a search guard all of my life
[1:26:31] and get down to the end of my life
[1:26:35] and him tell me he said you had it all
[1:26:37] the way down
[1:26:41] then to not search god and take
[1:26:43] somebody's
[1:26:44] idea or concept or a thought and think
[1:26:47] that i'm saved
[1:26:49] and never seek god again and wind up at
[1:26:51] the end of the road and find out i'm
[1:26:53] lost right
[1:26:58] i said well i just don't understand what
[1:26:59] you mean by that
[1:27:01] i don't understand why you can't
[1:27:02] understand what i mean that's right
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:06] it's plain
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:09] don't ever you don't you know brother
[1:27:10] dale don't play around with words
[1:27:15] you see grace is what's called us out of
[1:27:18] the world of sin
[1:27:20] and grace is what liberates us
[1:27:24] so it's got to be a person
[1:27:27] and it's got to be the holy ghost within
[1:27:29] you if the only teacher i know that we
[1:27:32] need is the holy ghost teacher
[1:27:34] well now what we don't we got to fight
[1:27:36] for i didn't say that
[1:27:41] because the holy ghost is the only
[1:27:42] teacher in the word right
[1:27:44] god put in a body
[1:27:46] a fifo ministry
[1:27:51] to help that and let the holy ghost have
[1:27:53] something to use
[1:27:55] see grace becomes a teacher to us
[1:27:58] to word it will deny ungodliness because
[1:28:01] grace is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:04] made manifest in you and i as the person
[1:28:07] of jesus christ living in us right
[1:28:12] then i know he's not guilty
[1:28:14] right so the holy ghost then the
[1:28:16] scripture said is the teacher
[1:28:18] teaching us to deny godliness
[1:28:22] well it don't condemn me to go do that
[1:28:24] but then my brother brown said
[1:28:27] snakes don't have no hips either
[1:28:32] he said don't condemn me do that not
[1:28:33] cause you're lost
[1:28:35] amen
[1:28:38] if you can go out as a christian
[1:28:42] and do things and not be condemned you
[1:28:45] are lost
[1:28:46] is there anything else i can say
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:53] well that's for everybody else
[1:28:59] listen
[1:29:02] the prophet said
[1:29:03] would you go out and everything like
[1:29:05] that even though you say i'm sorry
[1:29:08] he said you're going to get a weapon for
[1:29:09] it just remember that
[1:29:11] yes indeed you'll reap what you sow
[1:29:15] you read what you sow out
[1:29:17] either way they could put to come on
[1:29:19] yes sir but whatever you do
[1:29:22] take your whipping here
[1:29:26] take you with me
[1:29:28] what did the scripture say now
[1:29:31] if we won't suffer a chastisement we're
[1:29:33] what
[1:29:34] bastard and not children
[1:29:41] get right up and straighten up and say
[1:29:44] father here i am whip me
[1:29:48] just as thou seest fit
[1:29:51] lord
[1:29:54] here i am that's right and walk right
[1:29:57] back with a hallelujah on your heart
[1:30:01] god lets the whip down on you
[1:30:06] and what do you say
[1:30:08] god lets the whip down on you
[1:30:11] just say
[1:30:12] yes lord
[1:30:13] i deserve every bit of it
[1:30:17] just keep on going
[1:30:20] god will take you through all right
[1:30:23] it'll be over one of these days
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:30] you mean you go do something wrong you
[1:30:31] can't run to god real quick and ask him
[1:30:33] to forgive you
[1:30:36] if you don't go to god and ask him to
[1:30:38] forgive you real quick you're lost
[1:30:40] it don't make no difference what you're
[1:30:41] doing if you're lost because the sinners
[1:30:42] condemned on a different level right
[1:30:46] general ain't going to hell because he
[1:30:48] sins
[1:30:49] you know some adulterous acts or
[1:30:51] something
[1:30:53] that's not even counted to a sinner
[1:30:57] we'll get to it right
[1:30:59] hebrews chapter 6 57 908 the evening
[1:31:02] service
[1:31:06] you say well
[1:31:08] can't we backslide
[1:31:10] absolutely
[1:31:12] and when you backslide you're going to
[1:31:14] get it
[1:31:15] don't you worry
[1:31:16] abraham got it and the rest of them got
[1:31:18] it and you will get it
[1:31:20] don't you think it gives you a right to
[1:31:22] sin it doesn't you'll pay for everything
[1:31:25] that you do
[1:31:26] you reap what you sow
[1:31:28] you do one little sin
[1:31:31] and you'll reap a whole worship fool
[1:31:34] that's right
[1:31:37] but brother don't don't
[1:31:39] listen but brother
[1:31:41] don't mean to say that you're lost
[1:31:44] that's exactly right abraham reaped what
[1:31:47] he sowed that's right but he was still
[1:31:50] saved
[1:31:54] if you're truly born again and you do
[1:31:56] something wrong
[1:31:58] immediately repent of it why wouldn't
[1:32:00] you
[1:32:03] but you're not lost
[1:32:05] you got caught in the devil's trap
[1:32:10] right
[1:32:12] and then one of us in here didn't get
[1:32:14] hadn't got caught in the devil trout and
[1:32:15] brother brandon was one admitted to him
[1:32:17] to start with he did
[1:32:19] listen what he said in hebrews chapter 7
[1:32:21] 59 9-15
[1:32:25] now they get whippings for doing wrong
[1:32:28] you reap what you sow you get that
[1:32:30] don't think now you can't you can just
[1:32:33] go on out and sin
[1:32:36] get by with it
[1:32:38] if you do and got that attitude
[1:32:41] it shows you've never been you've never
[1:32:43] been born again
[1:32:47] say well brother dale
[1:32:49] i didn't believe you want to go now that
[1:32:51] he said
[1:32:54] but you get it if you've still got the
[1:32:56] desire in you to do the wrong
[1:32:59] then you're still wrong
[1:33:04] now i'm honest as a human being and i
[1:33:06] thought your prophet and i believe he
[1:33:07] was
[1:33:14] you mean the devil is not going to try
[1:33:15] to bring up what you've done
[1:33:17] and try to tempt you with the things
[1:33:23] you mean that even your prophet would
[1:33:25] say that the lord jesus
[1:33:26] could be tempted of women
[1:33:31] but yet he didn't see him
[1:33:35] right
[1:33:37] because you didn't fall into the
[1:33:38] temptation
[1:33:42] see for you to have a dirty thought it's
[1:33:43] not wrong
[1:33:48] because you cannot help what you think
[1:33:53] but for you to entertain that thought is
[1:33:55] where the wrong comes
[1:33:59] you get out here on the streets walk
[1:34:00] down the highway you go out here on the
[1:34:02] road or somewhere
[1:34:04] why did your prophet have a cross in his
[1:34:07] car
[1:34:08] now he said he did i didn't
[1:34:10] right he said he's seen women on the
[1:34:12] road he looked at the cross
[1:34:19] there's a man
[1:34:21] the devil contempting
[1:34:24] but it's not the problem of being
[1:34:26] tempted is when you yield to the
[1:34:27] temptation
[1:34:29] in other words you entertain it
[1:34:36] position in christ 1965 22 the morning
[1:34:39] service
[1:34:41] you might do things wrong and every time
[1:34:43] you do anything wrong you're going to
[1:34:44] get paid for it
[1:34:46] yes sir
[1:34:47] you'll reap what you sow
[1:34:49] but it has not one thing to do with your
[1:34:51] salvation
[1:34:53] when you're born to the spirit of god
[1:34:55] you've got eternal life and can no more
[1:34:57] die
[1:34:58] then god can die you're a part of god
[1:35:01] you're a son of god
[1:35:02] i was born to branham you might make me
[1:35:04] some other name some of the name but
[1:35:07] won't make me one less i'm still brown i
[1:35:10] was born branham always will be branham
[1:35:13] i may be so disfigured someday drawed
[1:35:16] with arthritis have a wreck and all torn
[1:35:19] up till i look
[1:35:21] an animal
[1:35:22] and i'm still grounded why brown's
[1:35:25] bloods inside
[1:35:28] are you listening
[1:35:32] why would we even consider
[1:35:35] that salvation as i said was like some
[1:35:38] form of a blanket it just falls over you
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:41] it just covers you
[1:35:44] you immediately start talking about sin
[1:35:46] what is the first thing you come to the
[1:35:48] human mind that's in this message
[1:35:51] the prophet said
[1:35:53] we're living under a bumper blood
[1:35:56] well i agree
[1:35:59] i agree we live it under a bumper bud
[1:36:01] i agree we finally found out which one
[1:36:03] of these batteries is running out
[1:36:06] toss that one
[1:36:07] you'll have to
[1:36:12] we knew one of them was going out but
[1:36:14] we didn't know which one
[1:36:16] so are we on that
[1:36:19] okay
[1:36:20] we got it
[1:36:23] all right
[1:36:26] but why would we even consider
[1:36:30] anything contrary than the fact of true
[1:36:33] repentance
[1:36:37] and a life lived in christ
[1:36:40] that'll do away with all of her hateful
[1:36:42] attitudes and arrogance and things and
[1:36:45] then you'll say i can't help it i'm born
[1:36:47] on that side
[1:36:50] you know what i started to do the other
[1:36:51] day i'm going to do it one day
[1:36:53] i thought about this i told parents
[1:36:54] about it going down the road you know
[1:36:56] one of these days i was born under nares
[1:36:58] and an aries does not like to tell
[1:37:00] people what to do
[1:37:02] if you think they do you're wrong you've
[1:37:03] missed the areas you're over on some of
[1:37:05] the side cause like i told rachel she
[1:37:07] said she's born under aries and i said
[1:37:08] yeah but i think you were born about a
[1:37:09] month early
[1:37:12] she don't get mad at
[1:37:14] she didn't know what all i was thinking
[1:37:16] about all this thing not about her about
[1:37:17] myself
[1:37:19] but you see well an aries is a person
[1:37:22] that tries to instruct
[1:37:25] not demand instruct
[1:37:27] a leo isn't one who demands or instructs
[1:37:31] by force
[1:37:33] i mean both of them are leaders
[1:37:35] and one will demand you do it the other
[1:37:38] one will say i'll just go show you how
[1:37:39] to do it
[1:37:40] and if you get out of the way i'll do it
[1:37:42] myself that's a true aries because you
[1:37:44] got to put that in there with christ and
[1:37:45] what all he was huh
[1:37:47] but you know what i thought i'd do one
[1:37:48] of these days i'm going to find out
[1:37:50] which is the worst of all the 12 signs
[1:37:52] and for one month i'm going to preach
[1:37:54] out of that sign
[1:37:56] i'm going to be exaggerating and hateful
[1:37:58] america you see where you already are i
[1:38:01] guess i'm you're right
[1:38:03] maybe i've been under them other 11
[1:38:05] signs and you didn't know it
[1:38:09] but see don't blame it on signs
[1:38:13] well the devil made me do it he didn't
[1:38:15] do it you volunteered all right
[1:38:21] well i just can't help it that's what my
[1:38:23] brother said he's a methodist preacher
[1:38:25] he said he can't condemn me for being a
[1:38:27] sinner he made me a sinner i said no but
[1:38:30] you missed that one right because he
[1:38:32] didn't make you a center this is a 12th
[1:38:33] grade college graduate from a seminary
[1:38:37] i said you didn't do it you made
[1:38:39] yourself a sinner right god didn't have
[1:38:41] nothing to do with it
[1:38:44] he gave you a choice look what you've
[1:38:45] done
[1:38:47] but listen let me get on
[1:38:49] don't consider grace as a covering like
[1:38:51] a blanket that you'd think but we're we
[1:38:53] just all don't matter because we're
[1:38:55] under the bumper blood
[1:38:57] you know it's just all over everybody
[1:38:59] you know what you're doing you're
[1:39:00] turning the grace of god into
[1:39:02] lasciviousness because what you're doing
[1:39:03] is you're taking a truth and using it
[1:39:06] for your own benefit
[1:39:09] right
[1:39:11] you're using it for your own benefit
[1:39:20] sure we believe in a bumper blood
[1:39:23] we believe that if god was not looking
[1:39:25] down through the blood of jesus christ
[1:39:27] he'd have to destroy all of us right now
[1:39:29] yes sir really we believe it and who
[1:39:32] wouldn't want to be right
[1:39:34] but you know there's people i know one
[1:39:36] brother i won't call his name but
[1:39:39] he gave me a brand new pair of boots and
[1:39:41] two brand new shirts it cost about
[1:39:43] initially
[1:39:44] 30 years ago and then shirts cost me pr
[1:39:46] cost him about 50 space
[1:39:50] and you know what kind of shirts they
[1:39:51] wear
[1:39:53] but you know
[1:39:54] you know why give it to me
[1:39:57] because i proved he was wrong
[1:40:02] and he was in no way gonna say i'm sorry
[1:40:07] i should have asked him for a new
[1:40:08] cadillac
[1:40:13] all right
[1:40:14] listen i hope you're getting what i'm
[1:40:16] talking about right
[1:40:18] sure god does not see our sin as a
[1:40:22] christian or he would have to destroy us
[1:40:24] that's why we have to have
[1:40:27] the bible says an advocate
[1:40:30] now if you're not going to do wrong why
[1:40:32] have you got an advocate
[1:40:33] right
[1:40:34] right if you're not going to make
[1:40:36] mistakes in life why is there an
[1:40:38] advocate
[1:40:43] see then grace teaches us
[1:40:46] that we need to be called out of sin
[1:40:50] did you catch that grace teaches us that
[1:40:52] we need to be called out of sin
[1:40:55] grace teaches us we need to live right
[1:41:03] see then if we have any idea
[1:41:05] then it don't matter what i do i'm
[1:41:08] covered
[1:41:09] why would you want to live like that
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:14] why would you want to live that way
[1:41:19] you're gambling
[1:41:23] and brandon said i don't live true to my
[1:41:25] wife because
[1:41:26] she would divorce me
[1:41:30] he should be called i believe that if i
[1:41:32] told her that i'd done something wrong
[1:41:34] she would forgive me
[1:41:39] but he said how would i do it
[1:41:45] and what's what i wrote now this is the
[1:41:47] husband and wife so what's both of them
[1:41:49] heaven help the person
[1:41:51] who would think whether you are a wife
[1:41:53] or your husband
[1:41:55] and would think
[1:41:57] that your wife or your husband would
[1:41:59] forgive you
[1:42:01] for doing something and then you go do
[1:42:03] it
[1:42:07] don't tell me how dirty um david was but
[1:42:12] getting you rock killed to take a wife
[1:42:14] don't talk to me about that because that
[1:42:16] ain't half as dirty
[1:42:19] is to think that you can do something
[1:42:20] and get by with it
[1:42:23] why would you even think about it
[1:42:30] sure
[1:42:31] we all will slip and fall yes and we'll
[1:42:33] all make mistakes sure but we must ask
[1:42:36] for forgiveness
[1:42:38] if not we're going to answer for that
[1:42:40] well i've never heard anybody preach
[1:42:42] christ brother i always heard grace
[1:42:44] which is old and so wonderful to me no
[1:42:47] matter what i do everything's all right
[1:42:50] he's just a dodio granddaddy
[1:42:57] he's a god and savior
[1:43:01] just remember one thing for sure
[1:43:08] see i know it like this and this is the
[1:43:09] way i think
[1:43:12] why would you have such a bad ego
[1:43:15] that would make you think that you could
[1:43:17] do it something and get by with it
[1:43:23] now you tell me what else that'd be
[1:43:24] beside a bad ego and lost person
[1:43:31] you know
[1:43:34] you know a lot of you think
[1:43:36] i know i write funny notes okay
[1:43:39] and sometimes i get funny tickle about
[1:43:41] my own notes
[1:43:44] but you know what some of you think that
[1:43:46] you're so great at honcho macho this el
[1:43:48] chancho or what kind of a beautiful
[1:43:49] woman or what you are or what you do
[1:43:51] that you
[1:43:53] that your husband or wife can't live
[1:43:55] without you
[1:44:02] right
[1:44:05] just remember
[1:44:08] we can't live without god
[1:44:11] but he can live without us amen
[1:44:14] keep that in mind
[1:44:16] salvation does not give a right to sin
[1:44:19] salvation covers sin
[1:44:24] you know takes it away
[1:44:26] eradicates
[1:44:28] see the pardons only for what you have
[1:44:30] done
[1:44:35] it does not give you the right
[1:44:37] to go do it again
[1:44:39] i explained that a while ago now
[1:44:45] but brother dale that's not the way i
[1:44:46] see grace
[1:44:48] i think it's just a covering progress oh
[1:44:50] wonderful
[1:44:55] i just read what i wrote down and i say
[1:44:57] with all due respect
[1:44:59] to the fact that you can believe
[1:45:01] anything like that that you want to
[1:45:04] that would make grace not a teacher
[1:45:07] on the inside of you
[1:45:09] but the devil in you
[1:45:11] making you
[1:45:14] reject the truth
[1:45:20] so i want all the records clean folks
[1:45:27] i want all the record clean what about
[1:45:28] you
[1:45:30] come on brothers
[1:45:32] remember
[1:45:34] reap what you saw
[1:45:37] we used to teach that
[1:45:39] that didn't mean a christian
[1:45:42] you know that was somebody else
[1:45:45] well sorry we come to find out
[1:45:48] that that is
[1:45:50] about a christian
[1:45:54] and that we will reap what we saw
[1:45:59] all right
[1:46:02] if you don't think that we're ripping
[1:46:04] what was sold look what adam and eve
[1:46:06] sewed in the garden even with the beast
[1:46:07] and then with adam and look at what's
[1:46:09] taking place now
[1:46:13] there's nobody healthy nobody's in
[1:46:15] anymore everybody's dying it's all just
[1:46:17] just everything's just falling apart
[1:46:22] they're getting things now they don't
[1:46:23] even know what you got
[1:46:28] nothing for it
[1:46:32] why
[1:46:34] because we broke down the bloodline
[1:46:40] that's hard to think to tell a christian
[1:46:43] see that's what you people want you to
[1:46:45] tell them that you just get saved and
[1:46:47] everything's gonna be so wonderful
[1:46:51] oh it is
[1:46:53] it is so wonderful as a christian
[1:46:56] because you realize you have a savior
[1:47:00] but brother dale
[1:47:01] you mean i got to quit doing this
[1:47:06] i thought salvation was to take me to
[1:47:08] heaven
[1:47:09] i gotta quit cutting my hair wearing
[1:47:11] pants and paint my face and me with old
[1:47:14] lonely string hair you know my old
[1:47:16] garden you may not no no you don't have
[1:47:18] to quit nothing god ain't never asked
[1:47:20] nobody to quit anything
[1:47:25] i like
[1:47:27] that little thing
[1:47:29] that the little kids wear around their
[1:47:31] arm what would jesus do
[1:47:36] well what would he do
[1:47:38] if he's inside of you
[1:47:40] the same thing he done when he was here
[1:47:45] would jesus act like we do
[1:47:53] what is it then
[1:47:55] what is grace
[1:47:57] just unmerited favor
[1:48:03] but see then i do know
[1:48:07] that what i do or don't do don't have
[1:48:08] anything to do with it
[1:48:10] because he saved me
[1:48:13] because he promised him
[1:48:15] i took him at his word and accepted what
[1:48:17] he said
[1:48:18] so he saved me
[1:48:21] but now there's a condition in my heart
[1:48:23] to realize that i don't want to sin
[1:48:25] against my maker
[1:48:29] you remember the story was told who was
[1:48:31] it was it told of peter to where that he
[1:48:33] was
[1:48:35] going out of the city
[1:48:36] i believe that's right you know it's a
[1:48:38] story but was going out and as he was
[1:48:40] going out he met someone come walking
[1:48:43] back in
[1:48:47] who was it
[1:48:49] it was the lord jesus going back to die
[1:48:51] for him
[1:48:53] peter was going to run away but instead
[1:48:55] of that he just turned around
[1:48:57] went right back
[1:48:58] told them said don't even hang me the
[1:49:00] way they hung my master
[1:49:02] and hang me upside down
[1:49:08] because
[1:49:09] he knew what grace was
[1:49:13] grace is a person
[1:49:16] it's not a doctrine
[1:49:19] it's the person of jesus christ
[1:49:23] 174
[1:49:25] 174 in a red book anybody have a need
[1:49:50] now let us
[1:49:54] tell them all about
[1:50:05] is
[1:50:35] tell them all about our
[1:50:50] living in
[1:51:00] condemnation inside of us
[1:51:30] will you have problems and do something
[1:51:32] wrong yes siree
[1:51:35] call we're human
[1:51:39] but we won't justify them
[1:51:55] do you believe it
[1:51:57] true grace
[1:52:00] is not disgrace that's right
[1:52:42] the truth
[1:53:08] and all at once
[1:53:38] you are
[1:54:04] amen
[1:54:06] just think about him
[1:54:07] think about what he's done for you
[1:54:10] how he saved you
[1:54:14] how he's given us the truth
[1:54:17] you don't ever thank him for the
[1:54:20] truth don't ever just say lord thank you
[1:54:25] thank you for the truth
[1:54:28] and know how to live a man's ideas
[1:54:33] i don't have to worry about being up
[1:54:34] today and down tomorrow because of what
[1:54:37] somebody told me
[1:54:41] i'd go straight to you lord
[1:54:44] pour out my heart and say lord i'm sorry
[1:54:58] that i won't even think about
[1:55:03] what things
[1:55:31] so
[1:55:55] where he's broken
[1:56:03] is
[1:56:26] think about it talking about the lord
[1:56:32] thousands of yours
[1:56:52] we
[1:56:59] praise god
[1:57:02] praise god
[1:57:04] praise god
[1:57:07] praise god
[1:57:15] he's the only one that can make us
[1:57:16] perfect
[1:57:20] praise god
[1:57:24] god
[1:57:25] praise god
[1:57:28] praise god
[1:57:30] praise god
[1:57:32] praise god
[1:57:36] you know i remember when we was a kid
[1:57:40] that they taught us in school that they
[1:57:41] could travel into outer space
[1:57:45] and they would travel so fast
[1:57:47] you know when it's now taking place
[1:57:50] that you would be gone for
[1:57:52] hundreds of millions of light years
[1:57:56] you know
[1:57:57] and you're just
[1:57:59] way out
[1:58:01] you go way out and stay gone and
[1:58:04] hundreds of millions of light years and
[1:58:06] that's just light years that's not
[1:58:08] days and times
[1:58:11] he said
[1:58:13] when you come back to earth it's only
[1:58:14] just a few years older
[1:58:16] it's whatever time you travel
[1:58:19] well you know i was reading the other
[1:58:20] day something
[1:58:24] you know man with his technology he has
[1:58:27] been able to advance to go to that and
[1:58:29] travel way out and
[1:58:32] go and
[1:58:33] they got those
[1:58:35] things up there in space where they can
[1:58:36] just go up there and live
[1:58:39] and some of them stay up there six
[1:58:40] months
[1:58:42] and live there
[1:58:46] do you know what they're finding out now
[1:58:50] they say after you're in outer space for
[1:58:52] so long
[1:58:54] that the body begins to get to a place
[1:58:57] that
[1:58:58] it begins to age
[1:59:02] the muscle mass of things deteriorates
[1:59:06] and they're afraid now that those that
[1:59:08] have been out there for six months or
[1:59:10] something
[1:59:11] and they said as much as four months
[1:59:12] would do it
[1:59:13] that they're afraid if they came back to
[1:59:15] earth and they christ landed and the
[1:59:17] plane was on the rock it was on fire
[1:59:19] that they would not have enough energy
[1:59:21] you read about it
[1:59:23] they wouldn't have enough energy to walk
[1:59:24] away from the crash
[1:59:27] because their body had aged
[1:59:30] so much
[1:59:32] okay now i know the rest of the story
[1:59:34] they say after you're back here about
[1:59:35] three four days
[1:59:37] that your body begins to
[1:59:39] get back right
[1:59:41] but they're afraid if they christ landed
[1:59:43] they wouldn't be able to walk away from
[1:59:44] the plane because
[1:59:46] they've aged
[1:59:49] aged more than
[1:59:51] what you would be in here
[1:59:56] here you wouldn't have any trouble right
[1:59:58] but see we're not meant to be out there
[2:00:02] that's what i was thinking
[2:00:04] we wouldn't meant to be out there
[2:00:07] we're not going out there when it's all
[2:00:08] over
[2:00:10] god's coming right here
[2:00:12] we ain't got to travel all these things
[2:00:15] he's coming right here
[2:00:18] that's what i like about that little
[2:00:19] card
[2:00:23] god is now
[2:00:24] here he's down here
[2:00:27] father
[2:00:29] just be with the people on the way home
[2:00:30] give us all a safe journey that we may
[2:00:32] all be home safely and everything be
[2:00:34] taken care of we love you and we commit
[2:00:37] everything to you we pray that what we
[2:00:39] said tonight was worthy of being said
[2:00:41] about your grace because
[2:00:42] lord you are grace
[2:00:45] you are the person you're the only one
[2:00:47] that can keep off all of these kinds
[2:00:50] you shed the blood that would be able to
[2:00:52] cover us but one day that blood lord
[2:00:56] will be removed from that mercy seat
[2:01:00] and when it does
[2:01:02] only those who have the life of the
[2:01:04] mercy
[2:01:05] the blood inside of them will be
[2:01:08] protected
[2:01:10] we thank you father for your truth
[2:01:13] we love you
[2:01:14] we committed into your hands in jesus
[2:01:16] name
[2:01:17] amen you dismissed
[2:01:20] and when this battle's over
