everybody in in the house of the Lord it's good to be back be with each one here in the middle of the week if you would like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading or where we started reading and uh we'll try to continue the message on tonight cuz we had to too much for Sunday and too much for tonight but we'll do as far as we can so if you will turn to Ephesians 1 and we'll just read from that Ephesians one remember all the ones that are sick and all that and I know sick and remember all of these I know you've prayed for them and all but just keep praying for her little Olivia tomorrow gets to go get part of her body removed get those tonsils out of there where it won't be letting her be sick and that's we like that that's a you know we we had those parts for a reason but then sometimes through through the side that we're on of life and all we get to where we don't need them as much and they're they're not as valuable so uh you know we get them out and get out of the way but just remember that remember Wade and I'll be uh leaving out tomorrow going to Oklahoma there for brother Jess's funeral so just remember the family there they've had quite a lot of loss in that family and all so just you know just keep praying for them the Lord would would bless let's pray father we thank you we love you we ask you that you would just come now and speak to us as we Endeavor to speak for you this night we ask that you would come and Lord Open the Eyes of our understanding as we're sing that we may see you the one that's living among us forgive our sins is mainly what we want to be covered and just bless and guide each one Lord have your way now and just keep us father in your Your Love in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians one we'll begin reading at verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jus Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha accepted Us in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his word will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time now here's the mystery that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word here's about four copies of Sunday that Sunday's so if anybody didn't get a copy somebody here tonight didn't get a copy of the uh quotes from Sunday I made a few there to where we could could U do it now what is the key that we or what did I say we would be bringing out basically in ever service in this series that we'll be trying to bring uh on predestination and it's the one thing to me that is the key to understanding all things let alone predestination the entire Bible all things is to be understood by one thing what that God knows all things he's never had a new thought all of his thoughts are perfect can't be added to cuz it was he wouldn't be God he would be like me and you he would be uh gaining some form of knowledge or some way but he doesn't and that's the key see if if you get that into your mind and just say God knows all things amen but see we we come down into predestination and and like I said the prophet there was talking about it SU that he said there's a lot of of messed up doctrines about predestination you know and see then that way people don't go for the to the way of looking at it because if you approach predestination to me now this is the way I believe it if you approach it in any other form than to approach it in the bases of forn knowledge right then you got to great uh opportunity for further advancement you know but if you approach it without forn knowledge then you've cut off your whole channel right all right so then an all knowing god or what's the matter with your God that doesn't know all things well he just knows some things you know he just well I guess he knows a little bit well you got a little bit of a god that's the best way to say it because your God has some kind of a peanut brain like the rest of us but see now I know what brother brandom said and I understand but you still try to do the best you can to help people to understand I know the prophet of God said he said if you're not predestinated to see it right you'll never see it h and I know that and I realize preaching to people you know that everybody is not going to understand what you're talking about I mean I understand that I that's why I keep repeating keep repeating keep going over it over it and over it because that way see then if I'm wrong then I can be corrected if I'll listen to what somebody else has to say but if I'm right in what I'm saying then if I keep repeating it long enough maybe it will drop down within us to where that God can reveal it but see that's what I think about predestination to me predestination is the most simple thing that I could ever think of I wish that a lot of the other doctrinal things you call it like one God you know different things would be uh is easily understood as predestination that's right because it simply is based upon the fact of whether or not God knows all things right and if he knows all things then all we've got to do is listen to the scriptures as it defines things to us and that way then we can you know get an understanding out of it all right like second Peter 3 and9 that God is not willing that any should perish right he's not willing that any should perish all right then that should set our thoughts in a direction to where that we can think on these things that he's not willing now and that he didn't make anybody make a choice all right and we gave them to you there on the morning service and some of you have them there like brother brandom says that uh paragra 10 a super sign he said he don't predestinate according to that's right his desires right that's right that's right cuz he desired that every person in the world should be saved paragraph 122 Harvest Time right not willing that any should perish e E15 Queen of Sheba all right if he's not willing that any perish why would our minds be set in the wrong channel of understanding and why not place it in the correct channel right but it's just like all other doctrines the Bible in nowhere in the world has ever taught three Gods two four or have many people come up with you know they have Tess foress and Oneness and it never taught three Gods right it never taught a Oneness doctrine that mankind has come up with right the Bible didn't teach it brother random didn't come and give us a new Bible I still have the Bible that I was reading before I heard of this message you know the pages didn't change you know the words didn't change right you know what changed my understanding that's right amen now then if if if God wanted everybody to be saved then he had to make a way that everybody could be saved right are you listening right right you know Sunday I was more reading a lot and I still read a lot tonight but I want you to think on a couple of items about predestination if God wanted everybody saved and you can't say he didn't that's right oh see they got this great doctrines in the message you know that we was his seed and only the seed you know well we'll get down to that one of these days and see what the prophet is really talking about amen you know we've been through it enough enough on it before but just think on these things brother brandham said on faith of Abraham in 1955 he said he never made Esau the way he was right that's right he gave Esau a choice he even says now I didn't bring you this but anybody can find it he said that Cain had a choice right and we'll get down to it one of these days to bring out a few more points on it but brother brandham I was listening to him the other day we was about where he said that Moses are reading the quote where he said Moses was born with this great gift but you know what the next few words he said he said everybody was born with that gift he said everybody was born with it he said yeah but brother it was according to this longing desire brother Brandon said every Mortal human being no matter if he's a hot and tot in Africa that has never seen or heard about Jesus Christ in any form or or God in any way and he worshiped idols and things like that but said he's got a conscience right and said he's got a desire Within him to serve God right he had to do that to give him a choice right so if he didn't predestinate as we think you know he must have done it according to where that he wouldn't be nobody in the Bible we'll get down to that scripture in a minute in Romans there but see the Bible says the thing formed can't say why did you form me this way that's right amen mm if he forms you wrong he can't judge you for being wrong amen that's right but if he gave us a choice and we took the choice and went wrong right then he could predetermine the destiny because of his for knowledge yes it's simple to me go that way the brother R say on where I think Pentecost failed 1955 God didn't say now I'll make this man by this and I'll make this man be that he didn't do it how'd he do it all of those has it on it if you didn't get a copy you have one all of that has on there that he predestines before knowledge that's right well that's just an old denominational Doctrine we're over into the great Revelation you can't leave the word of God that says those who he forne he did predestinate yes sir see when you leave the word of God you have no basis you have just your own ideas and that's what man has done and why you come up with all of these doctrines y right and it's not like my brother says and I gave you a quote of God's Covenant with Abraham 1956 that Jesus didn't just come to Calvary like on a halfhazard basis and just say well you know uh I'll go down and die that's what my brother says and it's in the same almost quote I'll go down and die and maybe somebody will be saved right he said now he didn't do it that way he even says to you and I that he didn't put us in a tube and push through it that's right amen we still have a desire right amen you know we still do it God doesn't predestinate according to his desires so what did we find he predestines according to your desires right now that way see then you can't blame him for being what you are that's right if he predestines according to my desires and my desires is wrong then he can't you know he didn't make me that way right right you say yeah but there's people here that he didn't give a choice and there's people there see act a denominational Doctrine see right amen but see in the message you got to you can plug up those loopholes by the prophet saying listen he said those people out there in the jungles that had never heard he said they'll be judged according to their own laws you want those quotes they'll be judged according to their laws and how they done well ain't nobody going to happen but they at born again that's the way we got our ideas right they come to find out there's going to be a lot of people in heaven there's going to be foolish virgin that's going to be there and there's going to be a fifth seal Jew that's going to be there there going to be a lot of people in heaven that didn't receive ET Turnal life while they was here right but you see do we believe that or do we still believe what mama said Just remember Mama was under a different age that's right she wasn't under the understanding of the end time right but God keeps his word 1957 he said that God would say well maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and get saved now that's not correct right neither would he page 37 or e37 five Junctions of time 50 1956 he wouldn't just that deliberately turn you away right as I said he said to Cain would you not have been accepted had you done what your brother done that's right we think Judas was such a bad guy like I've always say I don't I'm not on all of this garbage kin the world's got about it I'm just telling the truth the way I see it right Judas had an opportunity right and Judas didn't do no worse than Peter did right so Judas introduced Jesus to Pilot right right Peter denied of him being who he was that's right but yet we want to take up for Peter and draw up on Judas no I'm just just like I am I'm just what I am I just look at it straight he gave Judas Judas had an opportunity right until Satan entered into him that night that's right and even after he done that he had more gumption than Peter or any of us has ever had cuz you know what he done he went killed himself but yet we don't look at it on that basis we want make it some kind of a doctrinal thing that what makes it a great big thing we don't want to go back and just look at it like it is as I said all of these has got on them that you're predestinated by full knowledge right God never predetermined anything apart from for knowledge right amen that's right I thought they was this great thing that's see that's where you're still thinking Eve didn't have a right to do it and you and I don't either but you see we put our own thoughts in there cuz we don't really now I thought of this today and I'm going to just be honest and talk a little while to you you know we don't honestly want it to think about it being by for knowledge why would people reject the thought when the biggest portion of this message you know it's true they reject for knowledge they go to predetermining they reject of people in the bride having a choice right they say that's for the denominations brother randam said I'm glad the Bible didn't say William brand I gave you a couple there Sunday right amen he said I'm glad it said whosoever will right amen he said because then that could be me but said it might be more William Brandon right but see we don't like them quotes but why is it what's the trouble about for knowledge why would it not be the most simple thing to think about that God if the prophet is right in the Bible's right that he would that everybody be saved Y and that he wouldn't predestinate according to his own desires cuz he desired that everybody be saved why would we have trouble with for knowledge exuse me I know I'm not going to get on the rest of the message part of it but let's just talk a little bit about it amen why would you not be over joyously as brother Rand said I was reading two or three of them in there and he said don't that just make you feel so great this feels so wonderful to thank that God for new and would predestinate according to his full knowledge yes see then what would he for know why would we be so why should we be so happy about a forn knowledge because he's working according to your desires right right amen then you must have thought something about our desires you know right he knew the prophet said that somebody would want to be saved said thereby he devised a plan and devising the plan then he could manifest himself as as a Healer as a savior and fulfill his attribut right but now just remember one of these days we're going to get down to we're going to back up into heaven with this thing and talk about it a little bit in a deeper way than brother Dale's ever talked before to you so but you can't byass for knowledge that's right amen if you do it where is your basis to put it upon oh but brother Dale you don't understand a great plan and purpose I gave you one out of that message Christ a Myster God reveal what brother Rand says on page 50 he said God never just said I'll choose one y this one or that one right he said it was to fulfill the mystery okay now why would we not want to think about for knowledge why wouldn't we want to think about that cuz you know what four knowledge deals with knowing what you would do and won't do right right you know what then if he predestines according to for knowledge then he knew what we do and what we wouldn't do right right for knowledge and then brother colie he knew that you would get ready go over and pick up Duty I guess you did today in and you'd come to church why why did you come with church is it some Book of Rules is it that you're going to get 10 demerits on your report card because you don't you know come or was it because you wanted to right see if we didn't come on any other basis than we wanted to tonight we were just stayed at home amen right cuz you know what you stayed at home you wouldn't hear what I'm going to say you and be responsible now we were talking my wife was on somebody today and was was talking about it and never was a time in our married life from the time we became I become a Christian in 58 there was never a day a choice a time was ever said are we going to church never right come when you're sick in the hospital with my back Twisted the only time went up to that time we' had like a Friday night Saturday night Sunday night service and I forgot who was preaching but anyhow brother M had Friday night Saturday night Sunday services or somebody and the doctor told me he said I'll dismiss you from the hospital if you go home and go to bed I said you get me out of here I'm going home and go to church he said well you need to go home and go to bed I went home got a nice pack heat pack or one of the two I think was a heat pack I came to church and hooked it up and sat here why cuz I wanted to and you know what God looked down and we talk about those cherim simes Etc you said well it don't I don't well it does have a lot to do with our life but you know what God reached down and touched me and delivered me from that back trouble I've never had another case like that why because I wanted to come to church but how many of you find excuses for not coming right oh that brother they picking on me are you guilty right okay amen if you're guilty I'm not picking on you I'm talking about you am okay how much blunter can I be but you see we make our excuses well don't you think before the world that God knew those excuses now do you think he's going to give a holy ghost to somebody that he knows they won't have the right desire right and you got a messed up idea somewhere there if you think that I'll be glad to find you those quotes cuz I looking at one the other day he gives the Holy Ghost to those that desire him according to the scripture right but what about for knowledge see you want some kind of a predetermined because called predetermined is the end of the journey so you want to live like the devil and then die like Paul as we used to call it the Baptist so you want to live like you want to and do what you want to until it comes time and then one of these days we'll slip through some way and we'll just make it because we're predestinated just remember he predestines according to your Desir right right anybody that goes to hell is not going to hell because God wanted them to right they're going to hell because they wanted to now you know that we're not talking about that everybody wants to go jump off in the Lake of Fire cuz we done found out it ain't a lake of fire but you don't do that with me see I don't play with you when I get this way I talk serious nobody wants to go to hell right you got to get over Calvary to get there you got to give over get over an outstretched arms of our Lord and savior to get to to to get to go to hell but what about it if he knows every thought that we have wouldn't he know those thought before the world right see God don't do things in a halfhazard way so he didn't give Judas the Holy Ghost and don't get tied up in the anointings and things like that we're talking about the New Birth amen he didn't give it to him right because he knew he loved Jacob and he hated Esau it says right why because he knew you see if you have the new birth today then God knew you wanted it more than right just like Jacob right you do anything to get it right right right he wanted that birth right that birth right's the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right I've talked to a lot of you and you've said to me Brother D I don't really know whether I'm born again or not if you know what's the problem he's still working on your desires right you're not Desiring correctly right see then you say that people say well you mean what no no just like I said nobody wants to go to hell now nobody don't want to miss heaven right everybody wants to go to heaven it don't matter if he's happy hunting ground with the old Indian or who it is or what he's talking about everybody wants something after this world right right so now don't misunderstand them but see four knowledge that's what I got to thinking about I thought well why don't we want full knowledge why don't we want to just accept the Bible and the prophet's message that says for knowledge cuz if he didn't predestinate according to the desires right and if he would have predestinated according to the desires now listen to what I'm getting to is if he'd predestinated according to his desires you know what he'd have done somebody tell me what he would have done if he predestinate according to his desire he'd have saved everybody wouldn't he right right he saved everybody right but he don't predestinate according to the desires so back before the world he could look down through time and see who would be saved and who wouldn't then it's my fault and your fault why didn't I get to Holy Ghost when I was 11 years old in that Baptist Church when God appeared to me in that church I had nobody to tell me about it right I had nobody that could help me you said well now you mean God will will do things well according to brother random there was a pope one time that the Holy Ghost tried to come on him you remember that need that quote be glad to find it said the Holy Ghost tried to come on that pop yeah and he rejected it that's a direct quote now so if you needed out service let me know we'll go in office and run it up but you know what that Pope turned around and done he wrote a decree that it was better to make people serve God by force than it was to let them go without it so he wrote to decree to kill the people to make them worship God that's how far he went because the Holy Ghost tried to come on him now is is our Prophet just talking up hazly is the Bible just something that we can make it fit anywhere we want it to fit me ask you a question I thought about something the other day I mentioned it to brother dick tonight one of these days I might preach on it you know brother random was out dire about marriage and divorce and the Lord told him to go out there on that mountain and he said he come down and told me to go tell the people to go on as they are is that right amen can you say Amen to that that he done that well you know when he come back and preached it why didn't he tell all about what God told him out there so well he did he told him to tell them what did he say yeah what was the quote the prophet made that we're quick to quote because of Supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals I say unto thee y was God speaking to him out there on the mountain or had he already spoke it to him in the marriage and divorce but he didn't know it about it in the seals you know cuz he says it in questions and answers after the seal he said if you're spiritual you'll catch something he didn't come to Mar that and say the Lord told me to say this this is what I'm going to say he said because of a supernatural Revelation he put it right back into the word right cuz he couldn't be contrary to the word right I saw that I rejoiced cuz that Prophet put it in the word right you said well I believed it was in the word right I do too but did you know what's in there word like that see Church there's a lot in this that we need to know a lot about right but when we take our own ideas instead of waiting on God we wind up like any other denomination or organization right and we are no different then why would we not want it by for knowledge right can I drill that heart into our minds you know by four knowledge God knows that we'll get our little feelings hurt we'll get upset with brother and sister we'll get upset with a pastor we get upset with this right you think God don't know that sure and then your Prophet would turn around and say that even God would sometimes make your brother and sister say something to you to try you right what about it do you really want it by for knowledge but brother Dale you're getting it you you putting it to where salvation know what we do or don't do I didn't say that see you just misinterpreted something you deal with God about that I just put it in the Bible because your Prophet said that it was for knowledge that God predestinated by right not his desires so it be according to your desires why is it that some people when they come into this message they just it's just wonderful but to some it becomes a hum drum right you know halfhazard thing well I'm in the message of course I don't go to church too often but I believe the prophet every word he says he said forsake not dissembling so he but brother Dale you don't understand my problems I sat and cried at my wife because of her back and neck and knees killing her so much and see her still struggle right and cry and I would to see her get in the car and come on to church knowing how bad she's hurting I see some of you sneeze and you can't get here I thought church is where we're supposed to go to when we sick right I didn't I don't understand that Hey listen let me put it two ways if you got a disease that other people could catch don't worry about coming to church with it we're not going to get it from you right right see that's what people thinks you got something that's bad you not go to church where did brother brandom ever turn anybody away that had a disease or anything see you're scared of diseases that's why you get them that's right you can't get a spirit that you don't want I've tried to explain that and got in trouble about it had people different with me that's all right you're not going to get a spirit that you don't want right you say well brother Dale don't you well sure we have the oil we know what that means right but you mean I'm going to be outside somewhere and somebody's going to come up and I'm sick I I can't pray for you now cuz don't have no oil are you going to do it brother Mo said have man done one time said he was kind of they was praying for him and I'm just telling it like he said it he said the guy was kind of nasty and he said there all laying their hands on to pray and said he happened to look over the corner of his eye and said this man had one finger sticking up on that guy's head so I guess he figured he could trust one finger he wasn't going to lay his hands see all of that's according to our forn knowledge right the four knowledge is exactly what it is knowledge of an of a situation or existence before right or knowledge what about it why is it we don't want it brother around said on a message positioning Christ 1960 these are still last Sundays by his infant every how you would say it being infinite is the word he looked down through the stream of time and saw every man that would be saved right he saw their whole life do we're not pulling nothing over on God it's number 14 on your notes if you want to read it but why do we don't want for knowledge because it shows what we are it shows why we think like we think right because it shows that we do think that way right you think God doesn't know I was looking at one today where brother R was talking about you've heard of it where there's a man said something you know about his family even and this brother told him said ain't you going to say something about that he said no he said that was a predestinated trial that would be put before me to see what I do a predestinated he it trial right you know the Bible said all things work what together for who the called according to his purpose so it's not up for everybody right that's right everything don't work together for everybody does it it only works together for the called because it's there for a purpose to bring us through a childhood development of growth development of but brother Dale I'm like I said a moment ago I still feel that thing dangling we want to be careful about praying for people why right why why should we be careful right you mean you're afraid of the demon is in the person you're afraid of the disease is in the person well you know if you're afraid of then you can get it if you're not afraid of you won't get it you to watch me you've been around me long enough you seen what I do I don't sure we got all we use all sure we pray right but if it's not that way we just pray anyway right but see a lot of you wouldn't go in a hospital room where there's a disease at you know why cuz you're afraid of them and God's forn knowledge lets him know you're afraid of right right but it also lets him know that is there some dumb clu like me that what am I afraid of you mean it's going to get me quicker by laying hands on somebody than it is through the IR that I'm breathing just walking through the life see we're afraid of forn knowledge cuz for knowledge let shows what we are God by for knowledge knew that you and I wouldn't be able we were talking about it down while ago 40 years God is been waiting on you and I but for knowledge he knows somebody will come to it right and he knew it take us 40 years and I'm glad of that that's right but he knew it you know cuz like I've always told you I don't have no secrets I wouldn't care for my wife thinking in any thought or I wouldn't care for any of you thinking any thought I would ever ever have about you in the wrong way as long as you would know the end thought before I'm through with the conversation but I might be upset and say something wrong you don't think something wrong but at the end of the day I tell my wife I love her and that's I'm not going to lie I'm like brother Tom fush on one thing brother Tom tells you he loves you you can Bank on that you know you can go down to the bank you can do what you want do with it cuz he say I ain't going to tell you if I don't me but by for knowledge God knew everybody would be here tonight this year sure amen right and he knew what You' think about what I'm talking about that's why you got to talk to him about it like the old saying goes You Know a Man lust in his heart is not a divorce you know grounds for a divorce cuz you can't prove it against him right CU that's within yourself but then he goes and displays it it's grounds for a divorce you right well so is it with your thinking right your thinking is your thinking but remember your respon responsible for what you think I remember something happened years ago here at the church and there was a certain brother and all I just say it a few words certain man came through here and it was snowing after the service was over with I said give the brother some money and I said here's you enough money for the preaching and here's your two nights in the motail you go right out there and you go right up through that way you go to Gams when they some good Motel couple of Brothers here they said brother Dale you ain't going to let him go out like that are you I said Brothers y'all don't understand said when he leaves I'll explain and when he left I explained it you know what the problem was that man had been in the brother's home for 30 days and I don't believe neither one of them brothers wanted that man to go his family to go home with them 30 days not that you wouldn't want them to go spend the night not you wouldn't want to take them help them you know no no but you wouldn't want them 30 days so he was going to get my home 30 days cuz the brother called me and told me he said I got this brother been over here 30 days in my home I said send him over you said Brother D yeah but God knows I made it my mind that I was going to send him somewhere else cuz I was going to help that brother out so the end of the thing is to know that I was trying to help the brother the rest of it sound pretty bad didn't it see our four knowledge is what we're afraid of instead of facing it like it is if you're not here tonight because you wanted to be there's something wrong with you right then God sees that and says well I see that I see a group of people and we do we have the best attendance of any church that I know of Wednesday nights especially you know average attendance you know what I'm talking about right per many people we got per what comes and see we come to hear we sure don't come to look we come to hear well then you ought to come to hear and you ought to listen to what I'm saying tonight and say well brother D was talking to me but instead of that she'll say brother they was talking about me no I'm not talking about you anybody out there on the internet anybody else yours these I'm talking to you don't even talking about you see we're afraid of for knowledge because forn knowledge brings in our lives and our reasons for doing what we do right you know God predestines according to that that's right okay let's keep on going that's right brother brand on number 15 on your notes Jehovah gyen part 262 that He sent Jesus to catch those who he foresaw I want to get just a little bit of of something here in a minute even if I ain't going to get all of it but so then He sent Jesus to catch those who he fora and there's not going to be one get saved that wasn't meant to be saved right amen there's not going to be one lost that God didn't know they'd be lost right the Baptist had a Doctrine at one time and they wouldn't have a Revival a lot of you never studied it even if you come to a Baptist you wouldn't even they wouldn't have a Revival in their Church brother brandom explains this you know why they wouldn't have a Revival in their Church afraid somebody Sav CA they afraid somebody to get saved it wasn't meant to be now boy that's good a so we just won't have a Revival then out way why no here's me I know I get mean here's me why didn't the preacher shut up go home and sit down and not preach now of course you know why the money end of the deal right y why didn't they just say well we ain't going to preach no more cuz it way then God can save who he wants to no that's making a living now you're talking about my living now brother Dale yeah we'll all give an account look what he says on the message Jehovah Gyra that was Jehovah Gyra part two this is Jehovah Gyra 58227 he said his forn knowledge allows him to predestinate and you read all of those because all of them's got some things in it that's real good about how did he look down through time how did he saw how he knew but just remember he never never saved you that didn't want to be saved he will not override your freem moral agency right he won't do it he knew you'd want it or else he didn't give it to you so that's why a lot of people say well I don't know whether I'm saved or not well that's you know I get I get in trouble by saying it I told one brother one time I said told about him I said according to your desires brother well he just left out of here he said brother Dale said I wouldn't even sa I didn't say that I said according to the way he was looking he wasn't you cuz Wes do it he wouldn't right but you see brother Brandon when he got down to questions and answers number 17 on your notes 1959 conduct order and Doctrine he said predestination is only the forn knowledge of God right see now you say but but Brother D what about all this other about the seed and about this and all right let's take one quote only the seed come predestinated eternally right from God Amen not the person that's right now that's what your Prophet said amen but it wasn't a person that's predestinated eternally it was the seed our word right right so we got a long ways to go right but listen on the message he arose Jesus arose 1956 number 18 in he note he could see all things the way it would happen happen like I said there's a lot more on I read it first seal par page 12563 318 by his for knowledge he saw them mark of the beast 61-1 17 by his four knowledge he Christ a mystery of God revealed brother Brown said predestination there is the mystery yep there's the mystery Paul called it the mystery of his will I'm not going to get back to those scriptures cuz there's a lot in this read I keep reading that scripture but I would invite you to just study Ephesians 1 over and over and and over questions answered Hebrews part 3 57106 by for knowledge he could tell who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved that's why Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated before before they ever done anything now how can God be just to do that but what terminologies would you be able to put it on see that's where people don't realize what they're doing if you take predestination as the people of the message the biggest percentage take is on the basis of predetermining and that we are this seed we're this seed and I believe what the prophet had to say but remember if you don't approach it by for knowledge right you got God Desiring to save Jacob because he was some kind of a seed and hating Esa because he was a nun seed and what kind of a Doctrine have you got see what I mean see people don't think about what they're approaching brother I just believe what he said I just found 200 quotes about how that we was a seed and how we was at aen and there every one right you know unless it's a slip of the tongue brother around ma something he said in a paragraph or something but without putting them in the right category where are they did you catch what I just said Jacob have I love and Esau I hated I people say I love he love Jacob cuz Jacob was a seed well he didn't he didn't give Esau a chance so Esau can go to judgment with God and say you never gave me an opportunity right so you don't realize what you're doing with the word of God that won't change nobody that just clicks off the tapes and things that just they're not going to listen they click on to find out what you're talking about then when you say something I don't agree that's click off you know I've always been honest enough to be one thing if I click on I'm going to listen to what the whole ceremony is right and I'm not going to try to listen to it as a I've already got this figured out but I'll try to find out what he's talking about if you do that you cut the tape off and and go pray cuz you're in the wrong shape and remember full knowledge allowed God to know you would think that that's why we don't want full knowledge you know that God called Abraham by predestination by for knowledge look at number 24 if you notes which is paragraph 318 Hebrews chapter 7 part 1 fature 7 9:15 he predestinated Abraham by for knowledge no now brother there you just don't understand you just you're so carnal and I agree with you you you just don't know what you're talking about I grie you there but what do the word say but Brother D we're supposed to know something about having this seed in US I just covered it there a moment ago did you catch on to that everybody in the world is born with a desire to serve God we put ourselves in the pawn shop amen by accepting Satan's lie you don't believe that go over to the life message what we just heard Sunday and read there where the Prophet said about the two natures and see what he had to say about it if you put eternal life in your soul and it lost that's right you got a lost eternal life you got a problem right you see but people don't want to hear it like that they want to hear some kind of a glorious something to build us up and make us do things and let me just get this last part okay you'll have to go to the lice the back of all that we just gave you today we'll start on number 17 then we'll get back to this Sunday and bring the rest of it cuz you think on it from now to Sunday on one thing predestination looks to full knowledge back to full knowledge you got the quotes reading till Sunday but bring them back we sa me having to redo it predestination looks back to for knowledge that's a great statement for knowledge looks on to Destiny so it's all tied to for knowledge so let's just get a little bit right here let's talk a little bit like I said about why are you afraid of for knowledge see God looked down through time and knew knew every one of us and every thought we'd ever have every desire we'd ever have every word we'd ever say every thought we'd ever have right or wrong and if it's not under the blood we'll have to give an account one day that's the Judgment you know of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad may not be a decision of eternal life without to give an account but why would I entertain a thought you mean after all of these years I've preached to you that somebody could come up and tell you now brother Dale is uh he's just this that or the other and you'd listen to that and entertain Brother D don't really love y'all he just You' listen to that I appreciate a brother called me one time on the telephone you know what he said he said brother Dale I some brother's up here telling something and they said that you said it he said I heard two brothers talking said they they said you said so and so and he said I told them I know brother Dale and he didn't say it I said thank you brother that meant a lot to me he had the confidence enough into me know that I didn't say it the way they was talking about it I appreciate it all right what God fornew or fora those who heer knew he did predestinate now I will get back to this later but I will make this point remember the book of Ephesians is not written to the world it is written only to Christians right it is not written to the world right so those he forne he doesn't have to have a tape player to bring it to judgment when a sinner walks up there you've heard your Prophet make the expression he said that he a sinner will go by with his head bowed at the Judgment he will not have to tell him that he was wrong he said but the ones he'll have to bring to judgment is those who think they are right have not I cast out Devils have not I done all these things he said depart from me I never knew you you wasn't in the for knowledge of God on because the forn knowledge of God listen to what I'm saying and make it right now the for knowledge of God doesn't give a hoot about the rest of the world because he knows what they'll do you took it the wrong way when I first said it didn't he you thought I saiding something wrong where it said he didn't give a hoop let me quote scripture for you brute Beast made to be destroyed one purpose H2O to explode y now if you don't do that correctly what have you got if you didn't give that person a choice but full knowledge what have you got you got a God just making people and killing them and then laughing about it the predestination of God is dealing with the bride of Jesus Christ right the true church those are the ones he fornew right the others he just knows all about it right but he knows if he kept Adolf Hitler and I'm not throwing off on him just using them or anybody Samuel Dale don't matter God knew that if he left me here for 100 million years my choice would be the same that's right and yet a loving God that would come down every day and deal with you and me that's what I don't understand a loving God brother R said he didn't step in heaven when man sin said he came down to earth a loving God that will stand there and begging you not to go to hell do everything he can to show you signs and wonders and help you financially and and all kind of things because he wants you to make the right choice don't you think God knows how to raise children he wants us to make a right choice right this is making way 1956 304 so forn knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this sensible is it and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning therefore knowing that all these marvelous days listen that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things that we SE now God had to make a preparation for it right what about it God made a preparation for you to be here tonight what you going to do with it I'm going to go away my feelings hurt you know brother Dale better than that don't you if you don't you got a problem right right cuz you know how I am Abraham's seed got one amen 59 423 then when God foresaw by his forn knowledge how he would redeem the world of sin and Corruption he slay Christ before the foundation of the world when he spoke the word 4,000 years before it was manifested he fornew you and called you in Christ all right last let's see 19 Ephesians parallels Joshua what did he do that's where I titled the thing you know how did he do it said what did he do he by four knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence now listen fora us knowing that he was a savior self-existing there was no Angels no nothing but God just God El Elohim the self-existing one nothing but him alone but in him was a savior well what's he going to save there's nothing lost knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something out y that he could say now did he project out are you reading that which way you can read it this way he projected out he made it go out and made Sin appear to where he could become a savior now is that the way you think think that's what's being said that would make him condemning us for having a choice no what is it he would project something out yonder that he could save in other words he would know all he had to do was put us on free moral agency and give us a choice right amen right yeah he knew that's all he had to do he couldn't make us wrong and condemn us for being wrong he just give us a choice but he knew when he give us a choice we go wrong then he could display himself as a savior right then when he did that by for knowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it and then by doing so he said to save that the only way I can do it will become down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of the man upon him and die for him that I might that I might be the one that's worshiped because he is God the object of worship wonderful God is it last one Be not Afraid 1960 look at the bottom but when God sets it it's forn knowledge by for knowledge he foresaw everything amen by for knowledge he foresaw everything then nothing out of cater nothing's messed up just for you and I right we're the ones messed up did Brother brandom come and bring us something different than what the Bible says about predestination he told us how it was done that's right and we'll go back into that and follow it down but as I said I wish you would read Ephesians 1 over and over and over and study it a lot in there you'll see what choices are made I want you to just think about it it I'm sorry if I offended you in any way tonight what I said I'm sorry not for what was said but for saying it because I don't want to hurt anybody but I want the truth and I was just sitting there today thinking why are we afraid of forn knowledge why is it not just a simple thing what was the problem in the Baptist what was not just why wouldn't it just a simple thing to say for knowledge but see somebody thought they had an idea and they made a Doctrine out of and they split churches out of it Y how many times have we seen that in this message just remember he predestines according to your desires what do you desire and why do you desire it why would you desire something that would not be according to God's word you know why because we're human we all have our thoughts in our mind don't be playing with me I won't play with you okay we all have thoughts in our mind and Satan gets in there and works on us and does things right cuz we're human but you know I just want my Lord to know one thing when I go to bed at night I tell him Lord I love you I tell my wife I said I love you I tell the kids when they leave the house I love you right you know that brother Brandon made a statement I know you've read it he said I'd rather see a love in a church than see 10,000 people healed now I may be wrong on my numbered but I think it's right 10,000 I remember when I first read that I thought Lord what's a man trying to say he'd rather see love than see 10,000 he goes right on and he explained it he said because if love comes in there'll be 20,000 or something right I would to God that there would be a spirit of Love falling among this church people cuz there's some here that won't even hardly speak to each other CU of some little old silly something I would to God there'd be a spirit of love fall here that would just put everybody in love with God you know what it to solve marriages you know when you got problems in your marriage that's right if you got God in your marriage you're not going to have no problems oh yeah you're going to have troubles yeah okay you have troubles cuz you're two people and our problem is we're too stubborn to give in on our side I telling my wife the other day about something talking to her I said you know you got this people over here and you got this people over here and the way this husband and wife acts this husband and wife would love to they act that way but this husband wife would love to theirs act like that yeah you know but see it's not going to work cuz that'd be a lot of divorces right and then you'd have a lot of garbage skins cuz you'd find out it ain't as green over there as you think it is you know on the other side you know yeah that's right mhm I was talking to somebody one time you know I said well what what's about your husband is he is he he don't make a good li no he makes good what is it he's not at home right well he's at home a lot more than I want him to be maybe and he does all of this and he buys you stuff yeah I said well what's the problem most of the women in the church are like to swap with with you what you say if we don't have a marriage in Jesus Christ our marriage is not worth anything anyway but if it's in Jesus Christ it'll all come together that's right right God is in Christ I would to God come on brothers that they'd be such a love that's what I'm praying that's right that would fall in this church until we would just love each other that husbands and wives would love each other and they'd fall in love again with each other I told you I talk plain I'm just as honest as I can be you marry the first time you marry from lust by genes or what you call them things or hormones whatever you call them that's what causes marriage you say I fell instantly in love with him well you this harmones reacted no you didn't fall in love cuz you don't even know them that's where the trouble is people go get married after knowing each other two weeks and then what do they do and two more weeks they divorced right it ain't that away that's right but then you learn to love amen you learn to love after 50 years you learn to love one another amen because that's the way it is in God God's not looking down watching us to see what we're going to do and going to zap us because we do something wrong you know what cuz he knows by for knowledge right he knows by for knowledge that you'll make that right is that true so then it's for knowledge he's not looking at you and saying but give me a stick I'll beat the daylight out of he's looking down he said but look what they doing that they down there on their knees crying out and praying that they're sorry for what they've done so Satan just get out from here you can't talk no more that Buffalo Satan more than anything is love in the church let's stand together and then people one to the other 539 spiral cre in me a clean heart oh and reew right Within Me cre in me you right you brother he's BN out his heart unto you Lord you listen to the heart you come father you to walk right in you we love you father thank you thank you for healing his body because Lord he was really sick but yet you took care of thank you Lord Lord let your love be made manifest in Jesus name and ren my spirit within me do you say but I've been prayed for I've been prayed for I've been prayed for God's trying you step out on it word just say by strip I'm Healed the joy of th and R my spirit Hey listen 70 years old you got hurts and problems right went to the doctor today and he said Sam I see you in 6 months he said my secretary told me what you said for the nurse you know what I say she said how are you doing I said I'm doing one careful any problems no problems I said if everybody was as well as I am you'd be out of business she went back and told the doctor what I said he come in our life and about it he said Sam I'm in the business to hear all the grains but see Church laughter is a good medicine happiness is a wonderful thing do you ever hurt brother death well I tell you about it is it going to help me my wife would see me going to maybe to the medicine cabinet to get an as or something are you hurting I don't hey I'm 70 years old anybody 70 years old is going to hurt but I'm not going to brag on the devil I'm going to say by his stripes I'm Healed I'm going to believe it and I'm going to walk on because we are the Seed of Abraham walking by faith God for KN where we'd be and what we'd all be and what we'd be doing see we're not pulling anything over on anybody because God forne his for knowledge would allow him to know everything that would ever take place and why it would take place so what are we then are we afraid of it are we afraid to face it on the basis that we are the ones that make the choice oh brother Dale you don't understand we didn't choose God I know the message in the scriptures but I know too that you and I got that God's working according to our desires right to the prophet of God in the tongues and interpretation you have chosen the precise way and and because of that a great portion of Heaven awaits you what's your desire you desire to serve him no matter what the world says or what takes place going to serve you why because I'm afraid of going to hell no I deserve that serve him because to love him you love him that way do you love him that if he would throw you down on the ground and stomp you and everything else that you'd still love him but you'd still say I love you Lord father I for knowledge I love you my desire heavenly father I appreciate you Holy Spirit you're a to me oh Holy Spirit you're you lead me you guide me you're dwelling inside me Holy Spirit you're to me the k say about anybody that because it work not you your you human father and we got to go home with him he know our father we just lay our hands upon our sister knowing one thing your word is true we are to seek you no matter what and not let Satan hinder Us in any form but to walk on in you Lord you make a way for all things but when we try to plan them out it doesn't work we leave it all in your hands in Jesus name anybody else just what about it little Olivia is going in the morning to get those tonsils out let's just pray and believe take that with you okay father in the name of our Lord and saor Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our little sister and all be well father we even believe that you can take care of these things before the doctors touch her tomorrow but we're not making it so negative we're just playing it straight with you Lord cuz you're straight with us you know our thoughts and our desires we desire that you would take this thing away from her they'd be no trouble before the doctors would ever be able to reach her we leave everything in your hands because we thank you in Jesus name anybody else just remember little Liv you there tomorrow I can believe and pray that when the doctor get there said we don't need to take these out I still believe that right why not you're right why can't we believe
