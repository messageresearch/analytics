[0:00] my heart
[0:03] beers
[0:07] [Music]
[0:10] I want to say
[0:17] to see you
[0:26] shining in the light of your glory
[0:31] pull out your power
[0:36] say
[0:41] [Music]
[0:48] shine in the
[0:53] hold on to power
[0:57] [Music]
[0:59] Oh
[1:04] Oh
[1:12] [Music]
[1:22] I want to see
[1:28] amen that's our desire tonight I was I
[1:33] was laughing at brother Anderson back
[1:35] there cuz uh we thought he was gonna get
[1:37] here a little bit late at night and he
[1:38] turned out he beat me so we I think what
[1:43] happened was everybody was looking at
[1:45] that big bright moon out there tonight
[1:47] and it slowed everybody down a little
[1:49] bit but I believe there's a scripture
[1:52] about how the one day the light of this
[1:54] moon will be as the light of the Sun and
[1:57] it looks like it's just about that light
[1:59] but I believe that scripture was
[2:01] speaking of something else of a people
[2:04] that have become the word until the
[2:06] light of the sun is shining through them
[2:07] just as if the Sun itself was here so
[2:12] let's look and if you've been listening
[2:16] to Sunday School lessons then you've
[2:19] heard a little bit about what I'll be
[2:21] speaking tonight so might be a little
[2:24] bit of a rehash and you know sometimes
[2:25] it's kind of hard to retain everything
[2:27] so that maybe maybe we'll just kind of
[2:31] look at some of the things that I've
[2:33] been talking about again so let's go
[2:34] ahead and and I'm gonna be reading from
[2:36] John chapter 17 and John chapter 16 and
[2:41] really what it is if you remember when
[2:43] brother Brian preached the message birth
[2:44] pains he his pages stuck together and he
[2:48] ended up reading these two scriptures
[2:50] one that he didn't intend to read and
[2:52] the other that he didn't tend to read
[2:55] and so we'll look at will look at both
[2:57] of these scriptures but before we go to
[2:59] the word let's go to the author the Lord
[3:02] Jesus we just bow our heads and our
[3:04] hearts to You Lord
[3:05] tonight Lord all of us have come from a
[3:08] long way many have come together tonight
[3:10] not to see each other or anything that
[3:13] we know that's part of going to church
[3:15] but we've come to see you Lord and I
[3:18] pray God that you'll just open the eyes
[3:20] of our heart tonight as we sing that
[3:21] song or Jesus and Lord we just invite
[3:24] you Lord to come and be welcome here
[3:26] tonight or that you're quicker in the
[3:28] words of our heart floors granted I pray
[3:30] Lord that the words that I that might be
[3:32] spoken the night will not be said in
[3:34] vain nor that they won't just go out
[3:36] into the ether as it
[3:37] but Lord that you quicken somebody give
[3:40] somebody deliver in a store tonight as
[3:43] we know that deliverance comes from your
[3:46] word Lord I pray God that you'll just
[3:47] quicken the word tonight Lord Jesus we
[3:49] pray and we ask these things as we go to
[3:52] the word and the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:53] Christ amen
[3:56] so let's start off with the scripture
[3:59] that that brother Branham did not intend
[4:02] to read and we know this is the Lord's
[4:05] Prayer as Jesus prayed in John chapter
[4:09] 17 and he was speaking about you as you
[4:12] read this thing about how he was
[4:14] thinking of you as they pray this prayer
[4:17] and he said in verse 20 neither pray I
[4:22] for these alone but for them also which
[4:25] shall believe on me through their word
[4:26] that they all may be one as thou father
[4:30] art in me and I in thee that thou that
[4:33] they also may be one in us that the
[4:36] world may believe that thou hath sent me
[4:38] now now think about that that's that's
[4:41] really what birth pains is is growing
[4:45] growing up into a place where you are in
[4:48] unity with God that through his word you
[4:51] become one with him and and remember
[4:54] when when brother I'm read this the the
[4:56] archbishop the Catholic priest or
[4:59] whatever his title of role was he he
[5:01] came up behind brother Branham and gave
[5:03] him his Bible and he said he said these
[5:05] words just draw breath there's a reason
[5:08] why it was done and you know what God
[5:10] will show you something to bring out of
[5:12] this that's wonderful think about such
[5:15] words that would be spoken by a Catholic
[5:17] archbishop and how true they are
[5:20] something will be brought out of this
[5:22] that's wonderful I'm gonna take my
[5:23] jacket off and then let's go over to
[5:26] John chapter 16
[5:35] verse 22 21 verily verily I say unto you
[5:41] that ye shall weep and lament but the
[5:43] world shall rejoice and ye shall be
[5:45] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[5:48] turned into joy and that's what we've
[5:50] been talking about birth pain there's
[5:51] always there's pains and sorrow and joy
[5:54] and agony and all the things that go
[5:56] along with that before a child comes
[5:58] into the world of course a lot of you
[6:01] sisters are well-acquainted with those
[6:03] things in a way that the brothers can
[6:05] really never be but we're not talking
[6:07] about a natural childbirth tonight we're
[6:09] talking about the birth as my title
[6:11] tonight is the birth of the promised son
[6:15] unless in the end unless finish with
[6:18] verse 21 a woman when she is travail
[6:20] hath sorrow because her hour has come
[6:23] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[6:25] child she remembers no more than wish
[6:28] for joy that a man is born into the
[6:31] world he may be see that the Lord has a
[6:33] blessing to the reading of the word and
[6:36] you know that's what you know brother
[6:38] Branham always taught us and not put a
[6:40] period behind what we believe because
[6:42] there's always there's more to come more
[6:45] to unfold and I think that's true about
[6:47] the new birth as well you think well I
[6:50] understand the new birth it's
[6:52] justification sanctification the baptism
[6:54] oligo is what the baptism Holy Ghost is
[6:56] what all the different parks and all the
[6:57] different things but you know what it
[6:59] just keeps magnifying and unfolded so
[7:02] tonight I'm gonna preach speak to you a
[7:04] little bit about the new birth but it I
[7:06] believe that it just keeps unfolding and
[7:09] folded into a higher reality and you
[7:12] notice in John chapter 16 verse 21 it
[7:16] says for joy that a man is born into the
[7:18] world and you know a lot of times in the
[7:21] Old Testament they would be desiring for
[7:23] a man child to be born they'd called a
[7:25] man-child because if one day that child
[7:27] was gonna grow into a man but I believe
[7:30] now we're talking about tonight I want
[7:33] to talk about their birth of a man-child
[7:36] because you know when you're born again
[7:38] you start off as a little child you
[7:40] start off with a little baby and in the
[7:42] gospel and and you know maybe tossed her
[7:44] out about by every wind the dock
[7:46] for knowing not knowing you know who's
[7:48] preaching right and what's going on so
[7:51] much but and then you just keep eating
[7:53] the word and and growing and and eating
[7:56] the word and growing until until you've
[7:59] come into adulthood and and that's what
[8:01] the down authors are seven church ages
[8:04] God has been building a church from a
[8:06] little baby forms the foundation of
[8:08] faith and to into an adulthood just the
[8:11] same way that he builds the individual
[8:13] from a foundation of faith into
[8:15] adulthood and you know you look at all
[8:17] these little Old Testament stories of
[8:19] children being born and and now I
[8:22] believe we can look back on those
[8:25] stories with kind of a renewed
[8:26] understanding of what's what's taking
[8:29] place like the story of of Abraham and
[8:34] Isaac how he's you know the story of
[8:37] Abraham how he went through the three
[8:38] different parts of the the prefigure of
[8:41] of justification and sanctification and
[8:44] the babs's mela ghost as God turned him
[8:46] aside and then he he put in his sleep
[8:48] and he saw the the burning lamp and
[8:52] played out that part of it and then on
[8:55] until he finally met the man met the son
[8:58] of man there talking to him and and and
[9:01] he stayed there with him until he had
[9:02] understanding what was gonna take place
[9:04] down and with with lot and Sodom and
[9:07] Gomorrah and he any and he hung around
[9:08] until Adam Abraham had an idea of what
[9:11] was gonna take place but you know really
[9:13] the culmination of all that story was
[9:16] the son coming into being the promised
[9:19] son and he promised that he was going to
[9:21] have a child and that little that child
[9:24] typed Christ in all the different
[9:26] aspects of his of Isaac's story how he
[9:29] he he yielded himself up to be
[9:32] sacrificed it gave himself over to his
[9:34] his father to do whatever he saw fit and
[9:38] and and just kind of played out that
[9:40] whole story and then you know you know
[9:42] you look over at another story like Ruth
[9:44] and Boaz how Ruth went through all the
[9:47] story of redemption and how her husband
[9:50] died and you could type that as how Adam
[9:53] lost it in his inheritance he he wasn't
[9:57] able to redeem get ever the situation
[10:01] back to the way it should and and Ruth
[10:03] went through all the different stories
[10:04] of the harvest time and and getting the
[10:07] the wheat in the field and barley and
[10:10] all the different things that happened
[10:12] to to play out the story of redemption
[10:15] and finally at the very last of that
[10:18] whole story she ate she has a baby in
[10:20] her arms and that whole story really is
[10:23] talking about its working its way up to
[10:25] the bringing forth of this child and so
[10:29] you know there's so many other stories
[10:31] that I'm gonna relate to you in a moment
[10:32] let me get a drink of water so I don't
[10:34] leave my boy but you know you think you
[10:40] you look at these stories and you think
[10:42] well now I understand I understand the
[10:44] new birth that the new birth is God
[10:46] being birthed into me but a hold on
[10:49] because there's more there's more to
[10:51] come there's more beyond just a new
[10:53] birth there's a lot more that goes into
[10:55] that like brother Branham said that that
[10:57] he said the new birth is is kind of like
[11:00] an automobile or if you were a mechanic
[11:02] you can look at it and see all this for
[11:04] parts and things you say the new birth
[11:06] but there's a lot that goes into that
[11:08] there's a lot of different moving pieces
[11:11] and there's a gasoline and sparks and
[11:13] all these different things that goes
[11:15] into the new birth and so I you know I
[11:17] you look at you and you discuss with
[11:20] people today even in the message and the
[11:22] engine and they say well I've got the
[11:23] new birth I'm ready for the rapture but
[11:26] are you because there's more to there's
[11:30] more to take in a rapture than just
[11:32] saying I'm born again we know that we
[11:35] know the born-again believers are gonna
[11:37] go in the rapture you but the problem is
[11:40] and this is one of the controversial
[11:41] statements if you don't come to maturity
[11:43] you might have to die first well you
[11:47] will have to die for and I know that
[11:50] that uh maybe maybe that was not wise
[11:54] let me just say it like that with going
[11:56] out on the internet what not cuz that
[11:57] that you know that that's sort of
[11:59] confusing to a lot of people but that's
[12:01] the reason that brother Brennan preached
[12:03] these sermons like the statue of a
[12:05] perfect man that we have on the wall
[12:06] behind us and
[12:07] and adoption why did he preach adoption
[12:10] why did he preach all those things was
[12:11] it just just for fun just for just to
[12:14] kind of how share share his amount of
[12:16] knowledge that he had noticed so that
[12:19] you could know that you have to have
[12:21] some things beyond the new birth and so
[12:25] look at all these other little stories
[12:27] like well I think of Hannah crying she's
[12:30] got she's her husband has a I forget
[12:34] what his name was at the moment but she
[12:36] he had another wife who had a child he
[12:39] had children but yet Hannah and brother
[12:41] branham said that she had gotten too old
[12:44] she had gotten too old to have children
[12:46] the Bible says that the Lord had sealed
[12:49] up her womb and so she was unable to
[12:52] have children and look at a lot of these
[12:55] other people like Abraham also Abraham
[12:57] and Sarah were too old you know think
[13:00] about how Hannah's conversation when she
[13:03] her confession when she went down to
[13:05] pray before the before the priest and to
[13:09] make her confession to the Lord
[13:11] her confession was not based upon her
[13:13] circumstance but it was based upon the
[13:16] Word of God that I believe that all
[13:18] things are possible to them that believe
[13:21] she was she was making a confession
[13:23] really that he's the same yesterday
[13:24] today and forever and I think sometimes
[13:28] a lot of times today we look at the
[13:30] circumstances around us we look at our
[13:32] predicament and we say we say well I'm
[13:36] too old to have a child or now we're
[13:40] getting too old too old too you know we
[13:43] just look at the at the situation that
[13:45] we're in and think about think about the
[13:50] rapture because we're gonna take a
[13:51] rapture and you look around at the
[13:53] predicament of what looks like the
[13:55] church today what looks like the bride
[13:58] and and it and it to be honest
[14:00] you can almost slip into doing like how
[14:03] Balaam was looking at the hinder part
[14:04] saying well there how in the world are
[14:07] those people gonna take a body change
[14:09] how it with all the problems with all
[14:11] the ones that are moving along a little
[14:13] bit of slower pace as the other ones
[14:14] people still not dressing right wearing
[14:17] may
[14:17] doing all the things that they shouldn't
[14:19] that are really message 101 how are they
[14:22] going to take a body change but you know
[14:24] if you go back to looking at the statute
[14:26] of perfect man and look at patience
[14:28] that's what he said it was be patient
[14:30] and just remember that God the same God
[14:33] that was called you out of sin and death
[14:37] and all those things is able to call
[14:39] others out as well and he's moving us
[14:41] all toward taking a body changed and
[14:44] we're gonna take a body change
[14:45] somebody's gonna take a body change
[14:47] because he promised him it was written
[14:49] it's written in God's Word excuse me the
[14:54] Lord help me you know y'all pray for my
[14:56] throat so Hannah was there she was
[15:02] praying for a man-child she's praying
[15:03] for this child and God came on the scene
[15:05] and gave her this child that was was
[15:07] really one of the judges one of the
[15:09] deliverers of Israel and then you keep
[15:11] moving on up moving on up as God does
[15:15] greater and greater and now we've got
[15:18] Israel Israel down in the land of Egypt
[15:20] and they're in bondage in there and they
[15:22] begin to cry out for a deliverer for God
[15:25] to send them a son send them somebody
[15:28] that can come upon the scene and deliver
[15:30] them and you look at these pains that
[15:32] they were going through as their
[15:33] taskmasters whip them and beat them and
[15:36] and and they're crying out has God
[15:38] forgotten us and and then God comes upon
[15:42] the scene and gives them the Promised
[15:44] One and and how what a strange story of
[15:46] how he was put in a little basket his
[15:49] mama gave him away so that she could get
[15:52] him back that's a story that a lot of us
[15:55] could learn from as well for our own
[15:57] children if you want to get your kids
[15:59] back give him over to God and make her
[16:01] confession and let God handle let me let
[16:06] God deal with them because God could God
[16:09] can deal with your kids God can deal
[16:10] with the people that you're praying for
[16:12] and calling out to God for for
[16:13] deliverance and ways that you can't you
[16:16] can't really maybe even imagine and so
[16:19] so this this son was was born to the
[16:23] people and led them out of Egypt led
[16:24] them out of captivity but he said and
[16:30] Deuteronomy 18:15 the LORD thy God will
[16:32] raise up under the prophet from the
[16:34] midst of thee of thy brethren like unto
[16:37] me unto Him ye shall hearken and so one
[16:40] day that son which all of the Old
[16:42] Testament was looking toward was
[16:44] pointing towards that son came on the
[16:47] scene that man-child who was the Word
[16:50] made flesh and when I say the word made
[16:53] flesh I'm talking about the eternal God
[16:55] that encompasses all of the attributes
[16:58] of God everything that's in a savior and
[17:01] and Redeemer and all of that was bottled
[17:04] up inside of that man he was the one
[17:07] that came to die for our sins - to pay
[17:11] the price for us everything was bottled
[17:13] up in that man all that God was he
[17:16] poured into Christ his what brother
[17:19] Branham said everything that makes up
[17:22] God was put into that man and so he was
[17:25] the son the son the son of God the Son
[17:28] of David the son of Abraham the son of
[17:29] man put inside of that man and and
[17:34] nobody knew about it except for little
[17:36] shepherds nobody wide had to be
[17:38] shepherds either that that man he was
[17:41] put into it they laid him in a manger
[17:43] but a feed trough because you know what
[17:46] he was that bread that came down from
[17:48] heaven and if you want to go or he is
[17:51] you've got to eat the body word and so
[17:54] they put him in a manger into a feed
[17:56] trough because that's the way to get to
[17:58] him that's the way to be born out of
[18:01] this world out of this fear is to is to
[18:04] eat the body word of Christ and you know
[18:09] that's what that's what being that's
[18:11] what the the birth of the promised son
[18:14] is about to birth us from one world to
[18:18] the next you know the problem is we
[18:23] can't see with our natural eyes that of
[18:27] the world
[18:27] just like a baby being born from its
[18:30] womb from the womb of the mother it
[18:32] can't see the other world so you know
[18:36] what you have to do you have to look to
[18:38] the unseen and the only way that you can
[18:40] look to the unseen is to believe that
[18:42] war
[18:43] of God that's been preached to you let's
[18:45] been that's been shared to you by some
[18:48] man some vessel that God got inside of
[18:52] him and used his lips that used his body
[18:54] used his hands at his feet to carry the
[18:57] gospel blessed are the feet of those
[18:59] that preach the gospel the lips of the
[19:02] ones that preach the word so that when
[19:04] you hear that you hang on to it and it
[19:07] begins to take you and transform you
[19:09] from this world from the things of this
[19:11] earth
[19:12] into another world into an unseen realm
[19:19] I'm getting off my notes a little bit
[19:22] here but look look at what Abraham
[19:24] Abraham was looking to the unseen he
[19:26] called the things that were as though
[19:28] they were not he looked around him and
[19:30] all the circumstance and the things and
[19:32] and and he said I don't even believe
[19:35] this anymore
[19:35] I believe that one day like brother man
[19:38] I've always talked about he began to
[19:40] make the booties and and and lay aside
[19:44] all the little bassinet and all the
[19:46] different things so that he would have a
[19:48] little baby and I was we went we went
[19:51] down to the Louisiana camp that last
[19:53] year we had they had the little sister
[19:55] Mariah that had had lost all of her hair
[19:58] and and they were telling a testimony
[20:00] about how she came up and she she had
[20:02] like a little hat or I forget exactly
[20:04] what she had but she came confessing and
[20:08] believing that God was going to restore
[20:09] her hair to her and I don't know if
[20:12] you've heard that testimony before but a
[20:14] year later just appeared a while later
[20:17] God came on the scene and restored her
[20:21] hair to her you know you you walk into
[20:25] your confession you believe count the
[20:27] things that you see is though they are
[20:29] not because the bride is supposed to be
[20:31] a people that they're not looking at the
[20:33] stuff around them you know you're
[20:36] looking to the unseen you're looking to
[20:38] an unseen world another another place
[20:41] another store up your treasures in
[20:45] heaven not here the story or treasures
[20:48] up there because there is where your
[20:50] heart will be where your where your
[20:52] treasures are you know brother Branham
[20:55] preach sermons like like
[20:56] countdown where he talked about how the
[21:02] world has a does their countdown 10 9 8
[21:07] 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 but we're going in the
[21:11] opposite direction from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[21:14] and what that what it is is it's a blast
[21:17] off from this world from this sphere
[21:21] into another world you think about
[21:26] worlds now you know in this mentality to
[21:34] the into the ocean for example if you go
[21:36] to way down into the deep there are
[21:38] things that live in that world they
[21:40] can't live in this world you can't take
[21:42] a blue whale and put him on the land you
[21:44] can't take a grey whale and put him on
[21:45] the land but unless something were to
[21:49] happen unless maybe just just for you to
[21:53] imagine a picture in your mind if God
[21:55] were able to do something to a blue
[21:57] whale to transform him to the power of
[22:00] transformation so that he could live on
[22:03] land so that he maybe if God were to put
[22:06] like lungs or feet on a blue whale and
[22:09] transform it so that it could take come
[22:12] out of that world and come into this
[22:14] world where the same thing God is doing
[22:17] to you and I he's transforming us so
[22:19] that we come out of this world
[22:21] come out of the the world cosmos of sin
[22:24] and death and the heartache and all this
[22:25] stuff that makes up this world and he's
[22:28] transforming us from this world into
[22:30] another world where we'll go and eat
[22:33] have communion with God around the
[22:35] sphere of the earth and then come back
[22:36] and he'll transform this world to be to
[22:40] be eternal a better place where we can
[22:42] live forever and that's these birth
[22:48] pains the birth pains the reason they
[22:50] come home the reason there's birth pains
[22:53] the reason that were birth pains at
[22:54] Abraham's day when he had to keep
[22:56] digging whales and he kept forgetting
[22:58] run off until he finally dug the third
[23:00] well the reason that were those kind of
[23:02] pains is because he had a confession he
[23:04] believes something
[23:06] had heard a message from God a message
[23:08] from heaven and that created a struggle
[23:11] and strife the reason that were birth
[23:13] pains with Cain and Abel is because Abel
[23:15] had heard a message from God and he
[23:18] believed it and he told what he believed
[23:20] to Cain and Cain said I don't like that
[23:23] so he knocked him upside the head the
[23:25] reason there are birth pains is because
[23:27] there's a coming forth from this world
[23:30] into another world and you watch you
[23:33] watch the birth pains in the natural the
[23:35] birth pains in the natural signify how
[23:38] close you are to the child being
[23:40] delivered and you can look in the world
[23:42] and the world system but the Bible says
[23:45] when you see the fig tree putting forth
[23:47] is figs you know that summer draws nigh
[23:50] and so you look over Israel and see that
[23:53] summers Joe and I because the fig tree
[23:56] is putting forth its buds all these
[23:58] things are taking place around the world
[24:00] and you know that something's happening
[24:02] and you can look at your own self but
[24:05] your own live and see the struggle
[24:07] that's taking place and now the word is
[24:09] being revealed in you and you can see
[24:11] that birth pains just give me to spit
[24:14] over the place birth pains are producing
[24:17] something real it's not the potential
[24:19] anymore but it's sort of living reality
[24:22] what what have you been looking at
[24:24] through a glass darkly is now plain
[24:27] before your face because the Sun is
[24:30] coming into view like like I was talking
[24:33] earlier that about the moon the moon now
[24:35] if the moon is the bride the moon now is
[24:39] bearing the light of the Sun where if
[24:40] you want to see what God looks like come
[24:43] and look at the bride the bride is
[24:45] coming into view she's being birthed you
[24:48] could maybe title this the birth of the
[24:50] bride because the bride is being born
[24:52] she's being born from the word she's
[24:54] coming out of the church and being
[24:56] produced in the view let me let me
[25:00] coming down a little say a little bit so
[25:01] you can understand me I'm a star
[25:06] snorting and spitting
[25:16] so look when Jesus was born now he went
[25:20] through a natural growth period where
[25:22] you know it came out as a little baby in
[25:24] his maybe his brain had to go develop
[25:27] and his body had to grow and he couldn't
[25:29] walk it at first and just like any
[25:31] normal little baby staggered in the
[25:33] street and maybe his mama had to jerk
[25:35] him out of the way of a car going by
[25:37] real fast and things like that but as he
[25:40] began to grow
[25:41] he was the word all of the word bottled
[25:44] up into that person and so that was
[25:46] never a point
[25:47] I don't believe when he didn't know who
[25:50] his real father was because he came out
[25:53] knowing who his father was
[25:55] even when a little boy in the temple he
[25:58] was instructed asking question he was
[26:01] asking questions but he was asking
[26:03] questions in a way that those priests
[26:05] and Pharisees and whatnot began to
[26:08] realize that maybe they didn't know the
[26:10] Bible like they thought they did and
[26:12] when his mom and Daddy came looking for
[26:14] him his earthly mom and dad is incubator
[26:16] let's say like that began it came
[26:18] looking for me corrected her and said
[26:20] don't you know that I must be about my
[26:22] father's business because he knew who
[26:25] his father was and if he knew who his
[26:28] father was when he was born what about
[26:30] you and you're born you've got to know
[26:32] who you let me come down no your father
[26:36] is John chapter 10 25 to 30 Jesus it
[26:41] talks about Jesus knowing who his father
[26:43] was knowing who he was and knowing that
[26:47] there ain't no such a thing as a Trinity
[26:50] because the father and the Son and the
[26:52] Holy Ghost is all one person I want to
[26:56] say to you tonight that we don't believe
[26:58] in a Trinity we believe that Jesus
[27:01] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[27:03] forever and if he was the same whatever
[27:06] his attributes were back there if he is
[27:08] tavern if you take that same life in the
[27:11] same spirit and put it in another vessel
[27:13] it'll act the same way it'll behave the
[27:16] same way it'll do the same things
[27:18] said if you don't believe the words that
[27:20] I say believe the works because they
[27:22] testify of me and I believe that if God
[27:25] is tavern I gotta get in another vessel
[27:26] today you'll act the same way you'll
[27:29] still be doing the same works because
[27:31] the Bible says that these signs and
[27:33] wonders will follow them to believe all
[27:35] that all the different things that
[27:37] scripture talks of the attributes are
[27:40] exactly the same today as it was back
[27:42] then
[27:45] Jesus sense with him I told you and you
[27:47] believe not the works that I do in my
[27:49] father's name there bear witness of me
[27:51] but you believe not because you're not
[27:53] of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep
[27:55] hear my voice said I know them and they
[27:57] follow me and I give unto them eternal
[27:59] life and they shall never perish neither
[28:01] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[28:03] my father cuz he knew who his father was
[28:06] and he was able to speak of him because
[28:08] he knew my father which gave them me is
[28:10] greater than all and no man is able to
[28:13] pluck them out of my father's hand and
[28:15] then he said this famous statement that
[28:17] caused everybody to stumble I and my
[28:20] father are 100 now I had my father a 1
[28:24] what what do you mean what are you
[28:26] talking about in John 8 25 28 then said
[28:30] they unto Him who art thou and jesus
[28:32] saith unto them even the same that I
[28:35] said unto you from the beginning I had
[28:38] many things to say in the judge of you
[28:39] but he that sent me is true see he knew
[28:43] where he came from
[28:45] and he knew where he was going and he
[28:47] knew his present responsibility
[28:49] he knew the past present and future he
[28:52] knew who it was that had sent him and
[28:54] who it was that had given him the
[28:56] revelation that he was speaking to them
[28:58] and he said and I speak to the world I
[29:01] speak to the world of those things which
[29:04] I have heard of him they understood not
[29:06] that he SPECT to them of the Father
[29:08] this had Jesus under them when you have
[29:11] lifted up the Son of man within ye shall
[29:14] know that I am he and that I do nothing
[29:18] of myself but as my father hath taught
[29:21] me I speak these things my good imagine
[29:27] a man that had come that was standing
[29:29] there and
[29:30] and it's such a maturity that he knew
[29:32] his who his father was and that he knew
[29:36] the Bible so well and his father so well
[29:38] that he said I don't do nothing but that
[29:41] what's pleasing to the Father I don't do
[29:44] anything until first I see it first
[29:46] everything that he did everything that
[29:48] he was was was so encompassed in what
[29:52] the will of the Father was I only do
[29:54] that which is pleasing to the Father and
[29:57] let me tell you something that's how we
[29:59] got to get to get out of here you got to
[30:02] come to a place where everything that
[30:04] you do you have an understanding of who
[30:06] you are of your who your father is you
[30:09] know him and and I believe that if you
[30:12] know what you got to do what where you
[30:15] got to get to then that'll give you
[30:17] power
[30:17] there's so many people that today they
[30:19] don't have a direction in life they
[30:21] don't know what they're what they're
[30:22] here for whether what they're even if
[30:24] it's not revealed to you you know
[30:26] there's many things about the capstone
[30:28] that are not revealed to me yet but I
[30:30] could I could explain to you on paper
[30:32] what it is but it's like there it is
[30:35] I got to get to that I got to get to
[30:37] that place and when you know you got to
[30:40] get to it then well now you got your
[30:42] marching orders I think that's what if
[30:48] you look around at Natural Science today
[30:50] you can see all the time and expenditure
[30:53] that man has put into trying to get to
[30:55] the moon or getting to Mars and all that
[30:57] thing what if the church what if the
[30:58] bride had put that same amount of that
[31:00] of effort and to getting out of here
[31:03] that they were putting into going to
[31:04] Mars or whatever you know they're making
[31:07] t-shirts and all of those different kind
[31:09] of things you know brother Brown said
[31:13] he's waiting on the readiness of the
[31:14] bride he's waiting on you and I and you
[31:17] know what he's waiting on is for us to
[31:18] open the door and let Christ come into
[31:20] our heart let him change our vision
[31:22] let him take away the the crust over our
[31:26] eyes and put the put the eye salve of
[31:28] the word on us so that we can see
[31:30] clearly the word so that we can then
[31:32] look to the unseen and see what's beyond
[31:35] the veil of his flesh
[31:41] you see what what is pulling us from
[31:44] this world what is taking us from this
[31:47] world is the gospel that we have heard
[31:49] and that I'll take you now to get a new
[31:52] birth right there how do you get born
[31:55] again you know Adam had an impartation
[32:01] Peters it was just given to him but you
[32:04] and I we've been born as sins shapen in
[32:07] iniquity and so we've got to be born out
[32:10] of this world
[32:11] you've got to go through a process not
[32:14] just there it is which is what many
[32:17] people in the message believe about the
[32:19] new birth is that you just hear it is
[32:22] what are you seeking for you seeking for
[32:24] just a quick a feeling or something but
[32:27] are you seeking for power of
[32:29] transformation by the word that when the
[32:31] word is revealed to you it begins to
[32:33] take you from from a clothes and hair
[32:37] and dress to sanctified life to an in
[32:41] feeling where God the power of the Holy
[32:43] Ghost is within you and let me tell you
[32:45] something I don't believe that the
[32:47] church really knows the power of God
[32:49] that God when God fills you with the
[32:51] Holy Ghost he gives you power to cast
[32:54] out Devils he gives you power to live a
[32:56] godly holy life he gives you power to
[33:00] live this word came hardly talked I'll
[33:08] get I'll get to that in a second but
[33:10] what's drawing us from this world is the
[33:13] pull of the gospel in the seven churches
[33:16] back in 1954 brother Graham said my
[33:21] brother the other night receiving Christ
[33:23] he said don't ever push me bill said
[33:25] when God speaks to me I said you can't
[33:28] come until he calls you no man could
[33:34] have come to me except my father draws
[33:37] somebody does something else pulls you
[33:40] up that's somebody else but when God
[33:44] speaks you'll come see that's right
[33:49] standing there no man can come except my
[33:53] father
[33:54] draws you yeah I will think about this
[33:58] cuz that's really the secret just
[34:00] kidding out here how does he draw you
[34:03] how does he draw you is it a sensation
[34:07] or a feel under order remember larger
[34:09] hide in that cave and the whirlwind came
[34:11] by and all they did the earthquake and
[34:13] all those things but what attracted his
[34:15] attention what caused him to emerge from
[34:17] his little hidey-hole was that still
[34:20] small voice when he heard that still
[34:23] small voice of the words speaking and
[34:26] when you when God speaks to your heart
[34:28] and something nice within you and you
[34:31] say that's got to be the truth that's
[34:34] right
[34:35] it begins to draw you from the world
[34:38] from the things of this world to another
[34:40] world the revelation of the word is
[34:43] what's drawing you and I John 6 43 44
[34:52] Jesus therefore answered and said unto
[34:54] them murmur not among yourselves no man
[34:57] could have come to me except the Father
[34:59] which hath sent me draw him and I will
[35:02] raise him up at the last day and so
[35:04] that's what's creating the birth pains
[35:07] as as you're drawn from one place to
[35:09] another being born again by the
[35:11] incorruptible seed by the incorruptible
[35:13] Word of God being born again from from
[35:17] from places that plane to plane to
[35:20] higher plane as you grow up it's drawing
[35:23] you from this place to the next and so
[35:31] as you come from this world like like
[35:34] brother Brennan was preaching in why are
[35:36] we so tossed about if you've listened to
[35:38] that sermon why are we so talked about
[35:40] very interested in the way he brought it
[35:42] out as you go from the outer court to
[35:45] the inner court into the Holy of Holies
[35:48] the outer court where you got the Sun
[35:51] the light of the Sun of the Moon and it
[35:53] hides one say the clouds can come and
[35:55] cover it over and then you keep moving
[35:58] in to a higher plane of sanctification
[36:02] where where you've got the the seven
[36:04] golden candlesticks now look
[36:07] the way he expressed it because you know
[36:09] there's there's levels to the new birth
[36:11] seven golden candlesticks and we've got
[36:14] seven golden candlesticks down through
[36:16] the seven church ages seven golden
[36:19] candlesticks where it looks like now
[36:21] bring it back to your own personal
[36:24] journey you got a-you got times where
[36:26] you need to go borrow light from the
[36:28] neighbors the way he brought it you've
[36:29] got to go maybe this gets smoky in there
[36:32] and you got fan this the smoke out and
[36:34] get everything get everything clear
[36:38] again but then when you enter into the
[36:40] Holy of Holies and the veil drops behind
[36:43] you then you can partake of all the
[36:46] things that are within the Holy of
[36:48] Holies and it's like a child coming
[36:50] forth into another world
[36:53] now the problem is that that people stop
[36:56] there they come into another world and
[36:59] they think well now I'm born again I'm
[37:00] ready for the rapture I don't don't
[37:02] realize that there's a growth process
[37:04] don't realize that you've got to go
[37:06] beyond just just being born again but
[37:09] when you're born again this is something
[37:11] I brought out in the in the and I'm
[37:14] gonna expand on that a little bit more I
[37:15] know y'all waiting on me to do stage two
[37:19] though that of the trip throughout ur
[37:24] when you come forth when you come forth
[37:27] in that new birth process when any baby
[37:29] comes forth what the first thing that it
[37:32] sees the first thing that it sees in the
[37:34] natural is all of it the doctors and
[37:36] everything the MA the mama or whoever
[37:39] all all the people uh somebody was
[37:44] telling me about how they when they had
[37:45] a when they had their childhood they
[37:47] were playing rock music in there as they
[37:49] did the operation whatever and that's
[37:51] what in the natural a lot of people come
[37:53] forth to although all the things you
[37:55] know that the mama or whatever even in a
[37:58] lot of the whole there's old timing
[38:00] movies or whatever you see the like the
[38:02] Western dad pacing around outside he's
[38:04] nowhere to be seen nowhere to be found
[38:07] where is he but in the spiritual what's
[38:10] the first thing that you see what was
[38:13] the remember we're talking about when
[38:15] Jesus was born he came out knowing who
[38:18] his father was
[38:19] and when you're born of the gospel you
[38:21] know who your daddy is because that is
[38:23] the new birth a personal revelation of
[38:26] Jesus Christ to you and that's where I
[38:28] Romans 8 says for you have not received
[38:29] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[38:32] you have received the spirit of adoption
[38:33] whereby we cry father the spirit of
[38:37] adoption where God has put you his
[38:38] spirit in you and that spirit is crying
[38:41] out for the word for more of the word
[38:43] and it's not a crying out like a baby
[38:46] and the natural cries out just like vain
[38:49] repetitions crying out not knowing what
[38:52] it speaks of but a baby in the gospel
[38:55] the only way what's the only way that
[38:57] you can get a hold of God's attention
[38:59] what's the only way that you can get
[39:02] God's attention is it with his sympathy
[39:04] appealing to how bad you feel or how how
[39:10] how down-and-out you are and seems like
[39:14] everybody else is doing so good and what
[39:16] about me that that won't turn God's
[39:18] attention if it would then he would have
[39:21] healed everybody there at the Pool of
[39:22] Bethesda if it would he would have had
[39:24] healed all the other blind beggars that
[39:26] were sitting alongside a blind
[39:28] Bartimaeus but the only way that you can
[39:30] get God's attention is by faith in His
[39:33] Word and so I believe that that's the
[39:35] way that you come forth crying Abba
[39:37] Father because Abba is a personal
[39:39] relationship a personal revelation to
[39:42] you of who God is and it might be just a
[39:45] baby form confession because in your
[39:47] baby form you don't have a full
[39:49] understanding like somebody that's
[39:51] adopted might might have an
[39:53] understanding but along your journey
[39:55] your confession is shaped your
[39:58] confession is molded and that's what
[40:00] this is all about is the words that come
[40:03] out of your mouth are shaped and molded
[40:05] until you come to speak in conditions
[40:08] which is what God is trying to get us to
[40:10] when the church comes to speaking
[40:13] conditions as what brother Aaron said
[40:15] back in 1954 I believe something like
[40:18] that then a hill didn't they'll come and
[40:20] Eden and what happened in Eden was Adam
[40:23] could come out and he could tell the
[40:25] mountain to go over there and tell the
[40:26] fog to roll back when the church comes
[40:29] to speaking conditions ask what you
[40:32] we'll and you shall have what you asked
[40:34] say to this mountain be moved and be
[40:37] cast into the sea and it'll be done and
[40:40] the thing is though that even in a baby
[40:43] form Christian all of that power is in
[40:46] there it's in there waiting to be
[40:49] manifested like an acorn that's planted
[40:51] in the ground that a that whole tree the
[40:53] oak tree is in that a corn it just needs
[40:57] to be manifested it just needs to go
[40:59] through a process for that acorn to grow
[41:01] and butt out with all the different
[41:03] things and so that's what I'm really
[41:07] getting to is when you come forth speak
[41:11] the word and I believe today so many
[41:14] Christians are afraid to speak the word
[41:16] or what if I say something what if I say
[41:19] something that doesn't happen what if
[41:22] you don't say something and you should
[41:23] have speak the word and it you know let
[41:28] me tell you let me be honest there's a
[41:29] lot of things in my private life that I
[41:31] am reticent to say in public because it
[41:35] would you know it causes all people
[41:37] start looking at you like you're
[41:38] somebody special whatnot but let me tell
[41:40] you something there is power in the
[41:42] spoken word if you want to see somebody
[41:45] healed or delivered speak it let it come
[41:48] out of your mouth speak it remember the
[41:52] Joshua did as they came over to Jericho
[41:55] they circle around the city and marched
[41:58] around 13 times and then they clash
[42:01] their lanterns and they shouted and what
[42:04] is a shout it's the Word of God coming
[42:06] forth from your lips that you believe
[42:08] what God has already spoken
[42:10] you're not saying your own words you're
[42:12] saying exist what God has already saying
[42:15] and the walls came tumbling down and if
[42:19] you want to see deliverance if you want
[42:20] to see the walls that are hindering your
[42:21] own growth in your own life your own
[42:24] spiritual life then speak and listen
[42:26] watch the walls come tumbling down and
[42:33] you see the way let me see if I can talk
[42:36] Lord stop screaming you see the way the
[42:40] way a baby and the gospel grows is it
[42:43] the father speaking and then you respond
[42:46] how are you responding your said I
[42:48] believe that that's nothing but the
[42:51] truth like Hattie Wright said you look
[42:53] at look at little Hedy right out of her
[42:55] old mouth and the deliverance are for a
[42:58] family whatever you say
[43:00] after she had said that's nothing but
[43:02] the truth and he said you speak it and
[43:04] she said let that my two boys fall down
[43:08] over my knees and give their heart to
[43:11] the Lord or however she said it and you
[43:14] know you go back into the Old Testament
[43:15] and looking out David a lot of these a
[43:17] lot of these Saints formulated their
[43:19] prayers and formulated their cries how
[43:22] Jonah in the belly of the whale and
[43:23] Daniel and Daniel 9 4 he said I pray and
[43:26] I made my confession how they formulated
[43:28] their conversation they used the word
[43:30] let let it come to pass let it be and
[43:34] they spoke and it was because the Word
[43:37] of God was in their mouth and now that
[43:39] Billy came those words and it came into
[43:42] a living reality because they were
[43:44] looking to the unseen unit the way that
[43:51] the church came into being on the day of
[43:53] Pentecost when that it came for minutes
[43:55] baby form now they that's let me say
[43:58] that right because the the ones that
[44:00] were in the upper room were all the way
[44:02] up here but the ones out on the street
[44:04] work came in - right there but the ones
[44:08] that were in the upper room they came
[44:09] out how did that how are they born they
[44:12] came out confessing who Jesus Christ is
[44:15] they came out proclaiming this is the
[44:17] one that you've killed and they came out
[44:19] speaking in the words that they spoke
[44:21] were so important in God's eyes that he
[44:24] wanted the ones from Cappadocia in
[44:26] Fritchie and all around the world to be
[44:28] able to understand the words that they
[44:29] spoke and so he changed the the way that
[44:32] it was that their tongues so that
[44:34] everybody could understand he gave
[44:38] everybody understanding of what they
[44:39] were speaking and they came forth
[44:42] speaking they came forth cry I put it
[44:46] like this they came forth crying Abba
[44:47] Father and that's the way the church has
[44:51] grown through Paul and Irene eosin
[44:53] Martin Columbo all the way up they cried
[44:56] as the word
[44:57] I knew a fresh fresh manner for that age
[45:05] was delivered to each messenger and he
[45:08] disseminated through all the ministers
[45:09] of that age they took up that cry and
[45:12] they began to cry to the people the
[45:15] ministers and the people picked it up
[45:17] and they began to cry I believe that and
[45:20] that's how the church has grown and
[45:22] that's how you grow as an individual by
[45:24] speaking the word upon your confession
[45:26] that's why he's the high priest of your
[45:29] confession
[45:29] he's the hyper he can't do anything
[45:32] until you first confess him
[45:34] you know the brother branham said
[45:36] there's this is really there's a lots of
[45:38] different ways that you can confess but
[45:41] at the end of a service he would say if
[45:42] you want to give you a heart to the Lord
[45:43] stand up on your feet and confess him
[45:46] and so they stood up on their feet many
[45:48] others would come to the offer and
[45:49] confess when you go down to the
[45:51] baptismal pool he said that's based upon
[45:54] your confession which is why he would
[45:55] say I now baptize you based upon your
[45:59] confession because they had spoken I
[46:01] believe what what the prophet has said
[46:04] what the Bible says I understand it and
[46:06] now I want to be baptized because I
[46:08] believe what has been spoken and that's
[46:10] my confession and so you your whole
[46:13] journey is based upon what you speak out
[46:16] of your mouth when you raise your hand
[46:19] in church and say I believe that when
[46:21] you when you stand on your feet and if
[46:24] you're in your private moment or or
[46:26] wherever you are that's your confession
[46:28] I believe God but you're confessing
[46:34] because you know who your daddy is and
[46:37] as the world opens up to you you know
[46:39] more and more and more and that's what's
[46:42] taking you from the world
[46:44] you're crying Abba Father just like a
[46:47] just like a baby cries out for that for
[46:50] that nourishing milk and that's why the
[46:53] Bible says that he's out out you know
[46:55] that's another thing that people have
[46:57] groped and pondered and what does else
[46:59] shadow I mean the breasted one the one
[47:02] that gives nourishment and you get your
[47:04] nourishment from the word you got you
[47:06] run to the word like like when David
[47:08] when they took when they kidnapped all
[47:10] of his why
[47:11] and took everything he had he said bring
[47:13] me the ephod because that's where he got
[47:15] his his nourishment from the word he got
[47:17] his his rejuvenation from the Word of
[47:19] God let me see where I am in my news in
[47:32] John chapter 14 I think this is number
[47:34] two on the on the notes back there
[47:36] Brooks jesus saith unto him I am the way
[47:39] the truth and the life no man cometh
[47:41] unto the father but by me if you know me
[47:44] you should have known my father also and
[47:45] from his fourth he know him and I've
[47:47] seen him and they were like what cuz
[47:54] listen you've got to look with that
[47:58] inward eye with the spiritual eye of
[48:00] faith Philip say that him Lord show us
[48:04] the father and it suffice with us he was
[48:06] standing there right in front of him and
[48:07] yet they couldn't see him and the only
[48:09] way that you can see the father is by
[48:12] spiritual revelation jesus said that him
[48:15] have I been so long time with you and
[48:17] yet has thou not known me Philip he that
[48:19] has seen me hath seen the father and how
[48:21] sayest thou then show us the father you
[48:24] know there's a good illustration of the
[48:26] difference between the intellectual
[48:27] understanding and a revelation because
[48:29] until the new birth felt that the
[48:31] batteries and all ghosts fell on the day
[48:32] of Pentecost they were they would they
[48:34] could say you're the father and they
[48:36] were repeat words after he would say
[48:38] okay now now I got it
[48:40] but then on the day of crucifixion when
[48:43] they all ran in different directions and
[48:45] Peter was lapping people's ears off and
[48:48] everybody was running mass confusion and
[48:50] then on the road to Emmaus I didn't know
[48:52] who he was I thought he was a stranger
[48:53] they had no idea who he was but then on
[48:56] the day of Pentecost they knew who the
[48:58] father was
[48:59] that's the evidence of the new birth to
[49:02] you is when you know who God is when the
[49:04] word becomes a new book to you and you
[49:06] can look into it and see see things
[49:08] beyond just a very basic basic
[49:12] understanding because it begins to
[49:15] unfold you in layers like how brother
[49:17] Branham said the seven seals are like
[49:18] fireworks going off one goes off and
[49:20] then it spawns another
[49:22] and it just keeps unfolding like like
[49:26] that example of why we so tossed about
[49:28] where you go through the outer core
[49:30] inner core into the Holy of Holies but
[49:33] then he's got the man the the figure
[49:38] that he's talking about back in the
[49:40] outer court again what is going on
[49:43] because there's layers you see layers to
[49:47] redemption where you keep you go through
[49:49] this process of outer core inner core
[49:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost being born
[49:56] again all of the statute of a perfect
[49:59] man maybe I better stop on that one not
[50:04] stop but hold off for a little bit look
[50:14] you're you're born you're born by the
[50:16] word the way you're born again is by the
[50:18] word Galatians 3:11 says but that no man
[50:20] is justified by the law in the sight of
[50:23] God it is evident for the just shall
[50:25] live by faith
[50:27] and I think that's one of the things
[50:28] that the gospel does is to show you that
[50:31] the price has already been paid there's
[50:33] nothing you can do law the law won't
[50:36] help you keeping the law like that
[50:38] struggling within yourself to obey the
[50:41] law but let that let the lawgiver come
[50:44] in Tabernacle himself in you and then
[50:46] that's true justification the just shall
[50:50] live by faith and then own up to what
[50:53] the scripture that John Wesley preached
[50:55] in first Thessalonians 5:23 and the very
[50:58] God of peace sanctify you wholly holy
[51:01] whole sanctification complete
[51:04] sanctification and I pray God your whole
[51:07] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[51:09] blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[51:12] Jesus Christ that right there is the
[51:14] power of transformation where God can
[51:17] take you a sinner and take you from the
[51:19] things of the world and transform you
[51:20] into a sanctified being born by the word
[51:24] and and then it becomes an experience to
[51:28] you not an experience like I felt
[51:30] something but an experience where you've
[51:32] lived something and I believe that's why
[51:35] a lot of people don't
[51:36] leave it in the in the if and and what
[51:38] the fivefold ministry today could do
[51:40] because they have never experienced it
[51:43] they've never allowed themselves to get
[51:45] into given given the word and
[51:48] opportunity sitting in a church sitting
[51:50] under a pastor sitting under ministry
[51:52] for the word to take effect in their
[51:54] life oh there's so many things that make
[52:01] up the new birth that comprised that
[52:03] experience that after you've gone
[52:05] through the outer core inner core Holy
[52:07] of Holies you can look back and say I've
[52:09] experienced all that and it's made a
[52:11] change it's wrong a change in me and now
[52:13] I know what it is because I've
[52:15] experienced it it's not just something
[52:17] that somebody has talked to me about but
[52:19] I know and the Bible says in Romans
[52:21] 10:17 so then faith cometh by hearing
[52:24] and hearing by the Word of God and so we
[52:28] know that's how you get the new birth is
[52:31] by hearing the word because that's how
[52:33] you get faith is when your intellectual
[52:36] hearing turns into real hearing and that
[52:39] produces faith and then you got the ball
[52:43] rolling when you say I know I you can
[52:47] feel that when you when you're up here
[52:48] speaking you know you kind of feel well
[52:51] this this is really basic and we've kind
[52:54] of all gone through this before but
[52:55] listen there's a lot of people that
[52:57] still need the basic and we've got we've
[53:02] got kids there's many different ones and
[53:04] all different walks of life some that
[53:05] had just just come to the message or
[53:08] whatever and so we're all struggling to
[53:11] get to the same place through these
[53:12] birth pains so hang on if I get a little
[53:15] bit basic or whatever so to speak and
[53:17] you know really if you think it's basic
[53:19] then maybe maybe you're the one that
[53:21] needs a little refresher course if you
[53:25] look down on the sincere milk of the
[53:26] milk of the gospel then maybe you're the
[53:28] one that needs to get that pacifier get
[53:31] that little bottle out and get some
[53:33] nourishment on the sincere milk of the
[53:35] word and that sounds ugly but maybe it's
[53:37] the truth
[53:42] so you've got to confess it first and I
[53:45] know that clocks winding around but just
[53:48] hang on with me for just a little bit
[53:49] cuz I I've just got another painter so
[53:51] knows let's look at number five yeah
[53:56] yeah which is believe it's Dow this in
[53:59] 1951 brother Graham talks about he might
[54:04] have been to every doctor there was in
[54:05] the city he told you there was no hope
[54:07] for you but even now our Lord whatever
[54:08] you ask God will do it and he's sitting
[54:10] at the right hand of the Father make
[54:12] intercession is upon his death burial
[54:13] and resurrection even now Lord whatever
[54:15] you ask God will do it and there he sits
[54:17] in His Majesty sitting by the side of
[54:19] the Father at the right hand of him up
[54:20] up there to make intercession upon
[54:22] anything that you ask him and confess
[54:24] that he's done it he'll confess it
[54:25] before the Father what more do you want
[54:27] say Lord I accept you as my healer say
[54:29] it say Lord I accept you as my healer
[54:32] I'll never say nothing else but what I'm
[54:34] healed from now on now that's a broad
[54:36] statement right there that's a big state
[54:38] I'll never say nothing else nothing else
[54:40] I remember that's one of the things that
[54:42] he wired why are people so tossed about
[54:44] he said when you get into the Holy of
[54:46] Holies all of the stuff that's going on
[54:48] outside doesn't impact you anymore
[54:51] because it could be raining outside but
[54:53] yet you're in there eating on that man I
[54:55] said I believe I'm healed I believe I'm
[54:58] gonna take a body change I believe it
[55:00] he's the same yesterday today and for
[55:02] every night influenced by whether or not
[55:04] the sun is shining other moons clouded
[55:06] over on all those things you're in there
[55:08] making your confession he can't do
[55:10] nothing for you to you first confess it
[55:12] he's the high priest of your confession
[55:14] in that case not even to your face and
[55:17] even couldn't be faith until you confess
[55:19] it you got to accept faith believe it
[55:22] and confess that it already is done and
[55:26] and I've got other quotes in here about
[55:28] how he conquered everything that the
[55:30] devil can't through against him by the
[55:32] word only by the word and how we we come
[55:36] forth we let's read this and in birth
[55:40] pain this is number eight I'm just going
[55:42] to skip through real quick he said it
[55:46] did that all down through the ages until
[55:48] finally the church delivered to them a
[55:50] man-child
[55:51] and that man child was the word
[55:53] self-made flesh in the beginning was the
[55:55] word and the Word was with God and the
[55:57] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[55:59] and dwelt among us
[56:00] he conquered every devil every power
[56:02] upon the earth they come against him
[56:04] with a father's word only every
[56:06] temptation that Satan give him he
[56:08] rebukes Satan not with his own powers
[56:11] that he had but with the Word of God it
[56:13] is written it is written it is written
[56:15] for he was the word and that's the same
[56:18] way that you defeat the devil is by
[56:20] bringing him the word that's the same
[56:22] way that you moved forward and the
[56:23] gospel is by confessing the word is by
[56:25] speaking it keep speaking it keep saying
[56:28] it and watch it come to pass when Satan
[56:31] flew against Eve she wasn't the word so
[56:33] it failed when he flew against Moses it
[56:35] did the same thing but we need hidden to
[56:37] the Son of God he was ten thousand volts
[56:39] it not gonna loose feathers out of him
[56:42] when he come back and said it's written
[56:43] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[56:46] every word that proceeds out of the
[56:48] mouth of God there was that man child
[56:51] made flesh God's eternal word Himself
[56:55] manifested in a body of flesh here on
[56:57] earth to represent the word that
[57:00] manchild made flesh and if you listen to
[57:05] the sermon the masterpiece you know that
[57:07] God is building another masterpiece not
[57:10] necessarily another masterpiece because
[57:12] it'll be the same word made flesh
[57:15] tabernacled again inside of people
[57:17] inside of you and I where did I put that
[57:23] quote mm I was tryna
[57:33] I can't find it right now but it was
[57:35] speaking on how that the church does not
[57:38] realize the power that lies within her
[57:40] if she realized what was inside of her
[57:42] that this spoken word can move mountains
[57:45] and all of those sorts of things but now
[57:48] let me let me just finish up here
[57:50] because remember what's drawing us no
[57:54] man could come under the Father no man
[57:56] can come to God except the father draws
[57:58] and so how is the father drawn us today
[58:02] he's drawn us by the gospel as the word
[58:04] is preached y'all hang on with me a
[58:06] little bit it's a little bit
[58:07] disconcerting for ministers when they
[58:09] see everybody starting to doze off see
[58:12] y'all hang on with me a little bit yo
[58:19] y'all go back and listen to the tape IRA
[58:21] erection hang on there with me just a
[58:24] little bit I know it's Wednesday night
[58:26] and everything but uh what's drawing us
[58:30] it's I'm just tell it what's drawing
[58:40] this is the gospel that we have preached
[58:42] and so to get us to get us out of here
[58:44] God has God sent something a little bit
[58:47] extra special for us as he's as he's as
[58:50] he's a messenger was pre he preached his
[58:53] message all the way up Oh what to Wesley
[58:56] and then we get to lay out of C and it
[58:58] seems like something's everybody's still
[59:00] in confusion in the denominational
[59:02] confusion and and but yet there's this
[59:05] child that needs to be born a man-child
[59:07] that needs to come into existence and
[59:09] the how is that gonna happen the only
[59:11] way that it can happen is for for God to
[59:14] send like a an emergency medical task
[59:17] force somebody to jump start with with
[59:20] those those electric paddles jumpstart
[59:23] that church and resurrect her bring her
[59:25] bring her up to her feet and would it
[59:28] what so what happened was he he sent a
[59:30] prophet to us a prophet which there was
[59:32] a little man who has a perfect conduit
[59:35] with all his flus open that God could
[59:37] get in here get in there and blast the
[59:40] word out like in that message looking to
[59:43] the unseen where he said we didn't brown
[59:45] even here anymore I'm using his lips I'm
[59:48] speaking through him I'm the one that
[59:50] raised up Christ from the grave and
[59:52] that's the kind of man that God said to
[59:55] jump-start the church and so that's
[59:57] what's pulling us that's what in 1st
[1:00:00] Thessalonians 4:15 that's what that's
[1:00:02] referring to when it said the Lord
[1:00:03] Himself will descent will shall descend
[1:00:08] from heaven with a shout the Lord
[1:00:11] Himself would come and get in that man
[1:00:14] where brother brother said I was looking
[1:00:16] down at myself speaking and somebody
[1:00:19] else was using his lips and speaking
[1:00:21] through him the Lord Himself descended
[1:00:23] in God in him and spoke through his lips
[1:00:26] with a shout shell from 1963 to 1965 a
[1:00:32] shout to pull us up out of the things
[1:00:35] that out of that denominational system
[1:00:36] so that we have understanding of where
[1:00:40] we're going and who our daddy is and so
[1:00:43] when that child is born after you've
[1:00:45] come through that outer court enter
[1:00:47] court into the Holy of Holies when that
[1:00:50] child was born you come out knowing who
[1:00:52] your father is
[1:00:53] you know who the father is and you know
[1:00:57] who you are and you could look back and
[1:00:59] see as the sails break to you through
[1:01:02] your own personal journey you can see
[1:01:04] how God has delivered you and you know
[1:01:07] that you have been delivered that God
[1:01:09] has justified you and sanctified you and
[1:01:13] Tabernacle himself and you and your
[1:01:16] confession has been shaped by the word
[1:01:19] and now you're not just speaking in a
[1:01:22] baby form but now you can speak in an
[1:01:24] adult form now the word can be spoken
[1:01:28] because you know what the word is you
[1:01:30] know what God wants done with the word
[1:01:32] and you have an understanding of those
[1:01:34] things excuse me being born again Peter
[1:01:42] said the first Peter being born again
[1:01:44] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:01:45] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[1:01:48] liveth forever and ever which is what
[1:01:50] this process is about being born again
[1:01:53] so that the Word of God is in you that
[1:01:57] you can speak it and that's what the
[1:02:00] next part of that first Thessalonians
[1:02:02] are speaking of he descended with a
[1:02:04] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:02:07] which brother branham said was Christ
[1:02:08] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:02:10] in Christ shall rise first the dead in
[1:02:12] Christ have to rise first in other words
[1:02:15] the voice of Christ has to get them out
[1:02:19] of the ground the voice of Christ has to
[1:02:23] speak so that they will come from the
[1:02:25] ground so that the graves will open up
[1:02:28] and they'll be walking around among you
[1:02:31] and how will it be spoken it'll be
[1:02:33] spoken just like the Old Testament
[1:02:34] Saints where they said let let it come
[1:02:37] to pass we're brother and said in the
[1:02:38] rapture Mehsud he said now it's been
[1:02:40] spoken let it come to pass there'll be
[1:02:43] somebody standing here on the earth that
[1:02:47] has an understanding of what God wolves
[1:02:49] were done with the word that the word is
[1:02:52] Tabernacle in them and they'll say let
[1:02:54] the dead rise from the ground let the
[1:02:57] graves open let the dead walk around on
[1:03:00] the earth because the dead have to rise
[1:03:02] first so that we can go in the glory
[1:03:04] somebody was speaking somebody's will
[1:03:07] speak it and I might as well but you and
[1:03:09] I somebody's gonna speak it let the dead
[1:03:12] rise and so you see well you say well I
[1:03:16] can look around and I say well we got a
[1:03:18] lot of time left listen the doors are
[1:03:21] closing fast and if you haven't heard
[1:03:23] the message yet if you haven't opened
[1:03:25] the doors of your heart yeah you better
[1:03:27] run quickly because there's a people
[1:03:30] that's coming into a speaking condition
[1:03:32] there's people that are coming into a
[1:03:34] revelation of what God wants them to do
[1:03:37] with the word and you better get inside
[1:03:40] of the bride as quick as you can
[1:03:44] I'm sorry I know it's a little bit
[1:03:46] painful listen to my voice
[1:03:48] so my question is and I ask this in
[1:03:51] Sunday school my question is where where
[1:03:54] is the voice because there's that quote
[1:03:56] that brother Lewis read when he was
[1:03:59] ministering one I forget what sermon
[1:04:00] that was and I believe many of us all
[1:04:02] know it by heart that divorced
[1:04:04] somebody's got to be here on earth
[1:04:07] for God to speak through somebody's got
[1:04:11] to be here on earth and so there's
[1:04:14] always been down through the ages
[1:04:16] somebody for God to speak through Paul
[1:04:19] and Irina San Martin Columbia and
[1:04:21] Lutheran Wesley and brother branham the
[1:04:25] final messenger but now he's not on
[1:04:28] earth anymore and Jesus is not on earth
[1:04:31] anymore
[1:04:31] all of these are not on our own the
[1:04:34] earth anymore
[1:04:35] there's got to be somebody that he can
[1:04:37] speak through that somebody is you and I
[1:04:41] John 14 13 14 it says and whatsoever ye
[1:04:45] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[1:04:48] the father may be glorified in the son
[1:04:50] if you shall ask anything in my name I
[1:04:53] will do it anything in my name now
[1:04:59] there's our problem we might be like
[1:05:03] Hattie right sitting there and and and
[1:05:06] not quite believing Hattie right didn't
[1:05:09] what I'm saying are we not quite believe
[1:05:12] that he'll give us our children are we
[1:05:14] not quite believing like all the other
[1:05:16] ones in Egypt that came out of Egypt
[1:05:18] that God is able to deliver us the
[1:05:20] Giants into our hand remember there's
[1:05:22] only two one in me Joshua and Caleb that
[1:05:25] believed that they could take the land
[1:05:28] but if you can say God is able let's
[1:05:40] look at let's look at number 12 the
[1:05:45] oneness of unity
[1:05:47] don't tell me I'll get tired now come on
[1:05:53] the oneness of unity this was back in
[1:05:55] 1958 rise do you believe you're healed
[1:06:02] you believe that God answered prayer
[1:06:04] raise your hands to it thank you for
[1:06:08] it's over you're healed and I say
[1:06:11] brother I've never taught it to wait
[1:06:13] until you're healed and then thank you
[1:06:15] give him praise before he's done it lift
[1:06:18] up holy hands
[1:06:19] raising him and then walk into your
[1:06:22] confession watch it come to pass if you
[1:06:27] shall say what is it when you are out
[1:06:29] from Babylon you're out from under
[1:06:30] unbelief you're out from under
[1:06:33] superstitions you're out from under all
[1:06:35] these things and you're filled with
[1:06:37] God's own life yeah there's another
[1:06:41] stumbling block for us do you really
[1:06:43] believe that it's God's own life in you
[1:06:46] that God is tabernacling himself in your
[1:06:49] flesh and again I know it's Wednesday
[1:06:52] night but that's you that's it excite
[1:06:55] all of us to know that the god of glory
[1:06:57] the same way he was tackled in Jesus
[1:06:59] Christ although that was the fullness
[1:07:01] that that same ocean that same
[1:07:05] attributes is tabernacling you listen
[1:07:11] when when as a child comes into the
[1:07:12] world and the natural it makes everybody
[1:07:14] happy everybody starts calling one
[1:07:15] another and telling everybody I believe
[1:07:17] that's how it should be in the gospel as
[1:07:18] well when you see the child coming into
[1:07:20] fruition coming being born you start
[1:07:23] wanting to tell everybody about it you
[1:07:25] want that you want to let the world know
[1:07:27] that a child's been born
[1:07:29] your voice here's one get you your voice
[1:07:34] is his voice you are I spoke it that's
[1:07:39] what he said I spoke it see it's got to
[1:07:42] be spoken
[1:07:43] he's the shout spoken what the voice is
[1:07:48] talking about picked it up the people
[1:07:51] from 1963 onward we've been picking it
[1:07:55] up and accumulating it to ourselves and
[1:07:58] now I believe we're coming to a place
[1:08:02] where it can be spoken in my room awhile
[1:08:06] ago God told me to do this and here it
[1:08:08] is he's confirmed it right now amen and
[1:08:10] blessed be the name of the Lord oh what
[1:08:12] a time that's the first time this
[1:08:14] happened since South Africa how long
[1:08:16] will you grow up in unbelief the wind
[1:08:18] swept through this platform here just
[1:08:21] now as the Holy Spirit crossed over here
[1:08:24] the calls it was the spoken word of God
[1:08:29] that did
[1:08:31] there's power in the spoken word and
[1:08:34] that's what that masterpiece sermon is
[1:08:37] speaking of when at the end of it the
[1:08:40] sculpture is stricken and the master
[1:08:43] builder the master sculptor says speak
[1:08:47] now Michelangelo knew that that
[1:08:49] sculpture sculpture couldn't get up and
[1:08:51] start speaking and stuff but this is a
[1:08:54] different kind of sculpture this
[1:08:56] sculpture has been sculpted by the word
[1:09:00] until the master builder the master
[1:09:03] artist can look at it and see himself
[1:09:07] reflected in it it's got all of my
[1:09:09] attributes all of my makeup everything
[1:09:12] that makes me about myself is in this
[1:09:16] thing is in this masterpiece and so he
[1:09:20] strikes it and says speak that's what's
[1:09:25] happening now because I believe that I
[1:09:27] believe that God is at present to help a
[1:09:30] present he's a present God and that's
[1:09:33] why I'm struggling I'm trying not to
[1:09:36] keep putting him off in the future
[1:09:38] he's right here right now if you need if
[1:09:45] you have anything in need of anything
[1:09:46] tonight just reach up and claim it
[1:09:50] accept it accept your healing accept
[1:09:52] your deliverance if anything of this
[1:09:54] world has still got you shackled down
[1:09:56] and just accept it because it's not by
[1:09:58] your works it's not by by any kind of
[1:10:01] thing that you do but it's by grace that
[1:10:04] God is delivering us
[1:10:07] let me read here's that guy I don't
[1:10:09] think I gave this to the brothers in the
[1:10:10] back but this is the quote that I read
[1:10:12] in wool and what does that do they and
[1:10:14] there has to be human flesh on earth to
[1:10:17] speak his voice he said that in the
[1:10:18] voice of the sign in 1964 and I'm a
[1:10:22] clerk that musicians can go ahead and
[1:10:23] come forward because I'm a closed on
[1:10:25] this because when the when the disciples
[1:10:28] went to the Mount Transfiguration which
[1:10:30] is kind of the culmination type in
[1:10:33] Jesus's adoption as he went up there and
[1:10:35] and Moses and Elijah appeared on the
[1:10:37] Mount of Transfiguration and they went
[1:10:38] through all the different parts of the
[1:10:40] play there and they stood up there and
[1:10:43] and and it reads like this and
[1:10:44] Matthew chapter 17 if y'all want to pull
[1:10:46] this so this is number 13 while he yet
[1:10:51] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:10:53] him and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:10:56] we said this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:10:59] am well pleased hear him hear him hear
[1:11:03] what he's got to say y'all come on and
[1:11:06] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[1:11:09] their face and we're sore afraid and
[1:11:12] Jesus came and touched them and said
[1:11:14] arise and be not afraid and when they
[1:11:16] had lifted up their eyes what did they
[1:11:19] see this is what you see when you're
[1:11:22] born when you're born you see Jesus and
[1:11:26] you come forth crying Abba Father and
[1:11:29] there they were on the Mount of
[1:11:30] Transfiguration and what they saw was
[1:11:32] Jesus only no man we get our eyes on man
[1:11:38] so many times we look at brother Branham
[1:11:40] or your pastor or deacons or all these
[1:11:44] different figures in the end the message
[1:11:47] great men and the messages these days
[1:11:49] and we've all done it but when when you
[1:11:53] come forth you see no man save Jesus
[1:11:57] only and as they came down for the
[1:11:59] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[1:12:01] the vision to no man until the Son of
[1:12:03] Man be risen again from the day and the
[1:12:07] Son of Man is rising right now amen
[1:12:12] let's stand to our feet and we'll just
[1:12:14] go to the Lord in prayer and I'll close
[1:12:15] the service I want to ask you a question
[1:12:26] if you just lift your hand up if you
[1:12:29] believe that the voice of God is in his
[1:12:32] bride amen and after all those quotes
[1:12:36] that I've read how could you doubt it
[1:12:39] God's got to have somebody that could be
[1:12:42] his voice and you are that voice if you
[1:12:47] open the door to your heart study read
[1:12:51] let him come in so they he'll do the
[1:12:54] speaking for you that's how the
[1:12:56] Galatians Galatians chapter 2
[1:12:58] we live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:13:00] his faith his works his actions in our
[1:13:04] lives
[1:13:05] so if you have it if you have any needs
[1:13:08] as we go to prayer you know you don't
[1:13:10] even have to lift your hand just believe
[1:13:11] that God is able to deliver that able to
[1:13:15] give you what you have needed
[1:13:17] that's what the Bible says if you ask
[1:13:19] ask anything he'll do it ask it
[1:13:22] according to his word
[1:13:23] if you come quoting the word and laying
[1:13:26] the word before them and say you
[1:13:27] promised it watch it come to pass so
[1:13:31] let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[1:13:34] God I thank you God so much for your
[1:13:36] grace to us tonight Lord and for your
[1:13:38] grace to me helping my voice tonight
[1:13:40] Lord Jesus God I really didn't know how
[1:13:43] all the notes and things that I had
[1:13:45] would be ordered tonight Lord but I
[1:13:47] believe that you put everything in the
[1:13:48] right order the Lord I want you to put
[1:13:51] the order in the people's hearts Lord
[1:13:53] Jesus and maybe they go back tonight
[1:13:55] Lord Jesus and that you will bring
[1:13:56] things that are remembrance since they
[1:13:58] is they open their Bible and studying
[1:13:59] your word to the weak Lord God and I
[1:14:02] pray God that you'll continue to quicken
[1:14:03] your word Lord Jesus and I believe Lord
[1:14:06] God that the the hour has come Lord with
[1:14:08] a bride is beginning to realize who she
[1:14:10] is she knows who she is and where she
[1:14:12] came from and where she's going and
[1:14:14] she's having a higher elevated
[1:14:17] understanding of the things that have
[1:14:18] been written and sealed up through all
[1:14:20] these years and now we've come to a
[1:14:22] place Lord where we know what's going on
[1:14:24] and so now Lord Jesus we can speak your
[1:14:27] word and say Lord now let it come to
[1:14:29] pass Lord Jesus let let your word to
[1:14:32] come to pass Lord God if there's any
[1:14:34] here that are still struggling Oh Lord

[1:14:38] pass Lord that you break all the change
[1:14:40] of the earth Lord break give them

[1:14:47] children of Israel from Egypt Lord
