[13:57] individual day-by-day services that we
[14:00] make you get them on the three months
[14:03] basis but you mark that but remember
[14:05] those now
[14:07] are not made and put in your rack if

[14:10] like the mp3s which covers three months
[14:14] they are in the rack down in the
[14:16] richard's office thing and you get them
[14:19] yourself so now that those are not
[14:22] putting you right everybody understand
[14:24] it's not putting your rack on the mp3s
[14:27] that's the three months deal you've got
[14:29] to go in there and get them the only
[14:31] ones just be put in your racks will be
[14:33] the ones that are made on like a daily

[14:38] mark these put your name on it then
[14:40] we're gonna it won't be up there all
[14:42] right then if you want brother richard's
[14:44] tapes

[15:01] not stones big old rocks
[15:03] i'm the one that makes the tapes
[15:06] and and i know things happen and things
[15:08] but sometimes i find a stack that thick
[15:11] in your rack
[15:12] and i know you're not listening
[15:14] because they're in the rack
[15:16] there's no way for you to listen and
[15:18] especially the ones i make say brother
[15:20] richards or myself now and then the
[15:22] richard makes the ones you know for the
[15:24] services but if you want to get just
[15:26] every three months of the services made
[15:29] here at the church that'll be one mp3
[15:32] that you can take home with you and you
[15:34] don't have a whole lot of keeping up

[19:43] remember the sick among us because you

[19:51] believe you we thank you have your way
[19:53] now in jesus name
[19:55] amen
[19:57] ephesians where we've been reading one
[20:03] verse three
[20:04] blessed be the god and father of our
[20:06] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[20:08] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[20:10] places we're at now in christ all right
[20:14] according as he has chosen us were in
[20:16] him
[20:18] before the foundation of the world okay
[20:20] all of that is
[20:21] is done in him
[20:23] why that we should be holy and without
[20:25] blame before him in love
[20:28] not before the world we never will be
[20:30] holy before the world forget it we never
[20:32] will be holy before one another forget
[20:34] it we had a wonderful time last night in
[20:36] the bible study we really got into some
[20:39] things and we got three things covered
[20:42] and we covered a lot of territory and we
[20:44] were actually about 30 minutes late
[20:46] because of covering a lot of the things
[20:48] and i thoroughly enjoyed it
[20:50] i enjoy just talking about the word of
[20:52] god so you know we don't take that but
[20:55] if you want to come and be with us maybe
[20:57] that'll stir your curiosity we're on the
[20:59] works of the flesh
[21:02] and that's you know a lot of people
[21:03] think boy i tell you what i'm a
[21:04] christian i don't have no works in the
[21:06] flesh
[21:07] well
[21:08] why was paul talking about it to
[21:10] christians
[21:11] you know and i've told you before and i
[21:13] still believe and will believe until i
[21:16] can be changed on it i believe a
[21:17] christian a born-again christian
[21:21] can have works of the flesh
[21:23] now i don't believe there's anybody in
[21:24] the buildings murderer that's number one
[21:28] no or adulterous
[21:30] better not be if it is then you need to
[21:32] be an alder and get that straight
[21:34] because not you're the hindrance of the
[21:36] whole thing all right
[21:37] but what about
[21:39] speaking against your brother or what
[21:41] about
[21:42] spiritual adultery
[21:44] as i asked him last night have you ever
[21:46] asked god to forgive you
[21:48] for being in a denominational church
[21:54] remember you was in an adulteress of
[21:56] fire
[21:57] but i didn't know it
[22:01] you go down here on the side road and
[22:03] let them be
[22:04] shooting people and you're out there in
[22:05] the middle they're gonna get you for
[22:06] being a witness
[22:08] guilty by association
[22:11] if i was you i'd ask god to forgive me
[22:14] because we're trying to be in the word
[22:16] you know
[22:18] you know okay
[22:20] all right let me get out of that i'm on
[22:21] last night all right what do you say
[22:23] verse 5 having predestinated us war unto
[22:26] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[22:28] this is the only day that comes to the
[22:30] point right
[22:31] of adoption to be able to be completed
[22:34] so then that's what we're doing
[22:36] a jesus christ to himself according to
[22:38] the good pleasure of his will to the
[22:40] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[22:42] he hath made us accepted in the beloved
[22:45] now let's go to acts
[22:47] 3
[22:50] and we will read verse
[22:54] 19 and 3 through 21
[22:58] repent ye therefore and be converted
[23:02] that your sins may be blotted out now i
[23:04] know the background what this is laying
[23:06] on okay
[23:07] but you better listen to the scripture
[23:12] if your sins may be blotted out when the
[23:13] time of refreshing shall come from the
[23:16] presence of the lord amen
[23:19] all right now that started on the day of
[23:20] pentecost we agree okay we're all right
[23:23] but there's to be a refreshing in this
[23:24] end time watching it
[23:27] and he shall send jesus
[23:30] which before was preached unto you now
[23:32] that's in the end time right
[23:33] shall sin jesus christ
[23:37] which was preached unto you
[23:39] whom the heaven must receive until the
[23:42] time of restitution
[23:45] which is the same word is restoration
[23:48] all right
[23:49] restitution of all things which god hath
[23:52] before spoken by the mouth of his holy
[23:54] prophets since the world began you may
[23:57] be seated the lord had his blessing to
[23:59] the reading of the word now brother
[24:01] branham will use the word
[24:03] and if you're looking it up the word
[24:05] restoration
[24:07] restoration is not in the scripture
[24:11] all right just to save you the trouble
[24:13] of thinking about it
[24:15] and trying to find it because i did
[24:16] until i got wise enough to
[24:18] look and
[24:22] the word is restitution another word
[24:24] restore and all is there
[24:26] but the word restitution
[24:29] is the word restore and brother branham
[24:31] will actually use
[24:33] and be quoting the scripture
[24:35] the restoration of all things when it's
[24:38] saying the restitution of all things
[24:41] all right so then we know that he knows
[24:44] it the scripture knows it and if you've
[24:45] got a scofield bible drop down to the
[24:47] bottom of it it'll show you the great
[24:48] big long word it says this word rest
[24:52] this word restitution is restoration
[24:55] appearing only here and in acts 1 6.
[24:58] see because it's a very wonderful word
[25:00] all right
[25:01] now
[25:02] we have been talking about adoption
[25:06] adoption in three stages
[25:08] all right
[25:09] and in doing that we've come down
[25:11] through
[25:12] to worry that we're dealing now with the
[25:16] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[25:19] of the living god all right
[25:21] that way then
[25:23] you know
[25:24] you you have this to work that you can
[25:27] can study on it
[25:29] and
[25:29] you know i'm asking you on these things
[25:31] if you don't want the tapes to be made
[25:34] other than something you want to get on
[25:36] your own right none on it and that'll
[25:38] save me a lot of trouble trying to find
[25:39] out what to do with it just writing you
[25:41] know any and that'll save me the trouble
[25:44] okay
[25:45] now
[25:46] but
[25:47] we've come down to the basis of talking
[25:50] about the manifestation of the sons and
[25:52] daughters of god
[25:54] all right now in doing that then
[25:58] see we've reached a position
[26:00] in our message
[26:02] to try to have an understanding of
[26:05] of uh adoption
[26:07] and and like brother branham would say
[26:09] your your new birth is not your adoption
[26:13] your adoption is your placing
[26:16] into the body of christ the positionally
[26:19] placing
[26:20] and you know and i'll tell you up front
[26:22] and keep telling you the disciples and
[26:25] you'll see in a little while because
[26:26] brother brown said the headstone was
[26:28] rejected so we're tying together the
[26:30] headstone and the
[26:33] adoption in the manifestation of the
[26:35] sons of and daughters of god
[26:37] because we you know
[26:40] we've got to come to that place all
[26:42] right
[26:42] now then we've got to deal with doing
[26:45] that we've got to deal with the word
[26:47] restoration
[26:50] all right
[26:52] now if we're dealing with restoration it
[26:54] means whatever was here before can be
[26:58] here again right right
[27:00] restore
[27:01] okay but if we don't deal with it in the
[27:03] correct order we will miss the
[27:05] understanding of adoption
[27:08] but i believe your headstone
[27:11] is your adoption
[27:13] you know the headstone to an individual
[27:15] is that individual's adoption then the
[27:18] headstone to the unit of the bride of
[27:20] christ is the adoption and that is when
[27:23] you will see in full manifestation the
[27:26] sons and daughters of the living god but
[27:29] it'll be only like the lord jesus was
[27:32] because it's only basically less than
[27:34] six months not you can play with the
[27:36] words a little on it but there's only a
[27:38] short period from the time of amount of
[27:41] transfiguration
[27:44] to calvary
[27:46] seeing it's not going to be a long time
[27:49] we're not going to be around here 20
[27:50] years with manifested sons and daughters
[27:52] of god capped off as a complete eunuch
[27:56] and all the things now it's going to be
[27:57] a short period how short that's none of
[27:59] my business brother branham said god
[28:00] will to anointed church and do in one
[28:02] year
[28:03] what theologist tried to do in 2000 but
[28:06] said he's doing it now all right so what
[28:08] have we been trying to bring
[28:11] see i believe
[28:12] and have talked to you
[28:14] that
[28:17] there are signs and wonders going on
[28:20] god is doing that through his childhood
[28:23] training of
[28:25] us as his children
[28:27] we have found that the tutor is the holy
[28:30] spirit
[28:31] and the holy spirit is the spirit of the
[28:33] father so it's not the father leaving
[28:35] the scene as a lot of people like to
[28:37] make it
[28:38] and us popping up on the scene it is the
[28:41] father coming into you and i
[28:43] to bring his nature the natural story is
[28:46] you hire a tutor to the children the
[28:49] spiritual story god's not hiring
[28:51] somebody else to raise his children he's
[28:53] doing it himself
[28:55] by the new birth all right then so we
[28:57] must deal with it and see
[28:59] that right where we're at now on the
[29:02] place that i'm talking about
[29:04] that romans 8 about verse 19 said the
[29:07] whole world is waiting on the
[29:09] manifestation of the sons and
[29:11] sons of god i always say sons and
[29:13] daughters because sons means you know it
[29:15] means sons and daughters but a lot of
[29:17] people want to make it well that's god
[29:19] it's only for the sons
[29:21] you know well i believe it's for the
[29:22] sons and daughters of god
[29:24] all right because we must come to that
[29:26] place and the growth development has
[29:29] been doing on for 40 years
[29:32] right all right you say well why is it
[29:35] taking so long i'll ask you a question
[29:37] you answer it brother branham said that
[29:39] he couldn't preach the statue of a
[29:41] perfect man until 1962 he said he waited
[29:44] 30 years
[29:46] but if he waited 30 years to preach
[29:47] about it
[29:49] is any problem with 40 years for us to
[29:51] obtain it
[29:53] well i got it when i believed well
[29:55] that's a good old baptist doctrine
[29:58] and glory hallelujah
[30:00] but i just don't believe it that way
[30:02] so then you know we just go on and stay
[30:05] on what we're at and try to believe it
[30:07] herself all right
[30:08] now
[30:11] let me get to a point
[30:13] that's why i said i'll probably have to
[30:14] break two messages
[30:16] for the point i want you to see
[30:19] now
[30:20] to restore
[30:22] is to bring back
[30:24] something that existed previously
[30:28] amen agree
[30:31] it wouldn't be restoration or
[30:33] restitution
[30:35] you
[30:38] if it was just dealing with
[30:41] what is here no i mean
[30:43] see now it's something that was here
[30:46] but has that went away and then it's
[30:49] coming back
[30:51] into place
[30:53] all right that's what the word restore
[30:55] means
[30:56] all right see to take you back to what
[30:58] it was originally and see then if we're
[31:01] in the days of the restitution or the
[31:04] restoring surely you would agree this is
[31:06] the end time
[31:09] you know and that we are in that place
[31:11] and i gave you a quote there from second
[31:13] handed role prince 1956 1206 the last
[31:17] words there now
[31:19] now is the day of the restoration of all
[31:22] things
[31:24] all right
[31:25] now now is the day
[31:28] okay
[31:29] now it's in here somewhere we'll get
[31:31] back to it after a while the prophet
[31:32] said when my brother when my sister was
[31:35] the sons and daughters of god to be made
[31:36] manifest outside of this day
[31:40] all right
[31:41] but it must be understood
[31:43] what we're talking about
[31:45] amen and forgive me because i'm trying
[31:47] to cover a little bit of the back and
[31:48] then come up and not just start right
[31:51] here
[31:52] but
[31:54] to try to get you to look at something
[31:57] and i know that i try to explain things
[31:59] and forgive me if i'm wrong
[32:01] but i'll keep on doing it i've tried to
[32:04] explain a lot of things over the years
[32:06] and people have
[32:08] labeled me as intellectual
[32:10] and say we don't need those things well
[32:12] where would you be if i hadn't explained
[32:14] them
[32:16] that's all i got to say
[32:19] you know that's no problem with me do
[32:21] what you want to
[32:23] but see i've tried to break things down
[32:25] the word that you won't have a loophole
[32:27] in your mind because i know what the
[32:28] human brain is doing
[32:30] just like trying to explain that
[32:32] on the day of pentecost
[32:34] and explain that brother branham said
[32:36] that he met people with a holy ghost
[32:39] 50 years
[32:41] before he came you know
[32:43] before him
[32:44] they received it 50 years before he come
[32:47] on the scene in other words in his
[32:48] ministries
[32:49] he said exactly like the day of
[32:50] pentecost
[32:54] well
[32:54] if you go one way on that you're running
[32:56] way off you go the other way you're
[32:58] running away off so what is it
[33:01] there was a split condition on the death
[33:03] pentecost
[33:05] there was 120 in the upper room
[33:08] they were tutored for three and a half
[33:09] years
[33:10] when the holy ghost fell it gave them
[33:13] where it says holy spirit on your
[33:15] pyramid it gave them all of these
[33:17] virtues
[33:19] all right
[33:22] but now the 3 000 outside heard one
[33:24] sermon
[33:29] and they received the new birth
[33:31] where did he put them
[33:33] according to the scriptures it put them
[33:35] as babes
[33:36] right all right which means it puts you
[33:38] right here at faith the new birth
[33:41] see and ours where the problem brought
[33:43] around pentecostal people and
[33:45] that's people in this message or
[33:46] whatever it's at
[33:48] they say oh we got everything
[33:51] you know
[33:52] what if you do what do you need to be
[33:53] around here for why don't you just go
[33:55] fishing and wait on the rest of it
[33:56] because days are not counted until you
[33:57] fish it
[34:02] okay
[34:04] but now listen
[34:06] see then better way then
[34:08] brother branham met people that received
[34:10] the holy ghost
[34:12] exactly like the day of pentecost
[34:15] not the upper room experience
[34:18] because i believe he was the only one
[34:19] standing in his day with it
[34:21] of an upper roaming experience
[34:24] you know the faith of the fathers
[34:26] all right
[34:28] see then he was trying to teach us how
[34:30] to come to that place and that's why it
[34:31] took 30 years to do it but see the ones
[34:34] he had met with the holy ghost the zeus
[34:36] street holy ghost was the baptism of the
[34:39] holy ghost exactly like the book of acts
[34:43] but not the upper room experience of 120
[34:47] but the 3000 that received the holy
[34:49] ghost is a baby
[34:52] and brother brown calls the zeus street
[34:54] the prophet
[34:56] 464 to see a book go read
[35:00] he said the holy ghost came himself in
[35:02] the person
[35:03] of jesus christ
[35:07] but see then we needed somebody to come
[35:09] and tutor us
[35:10] back to where the disciples were and
[35:12] that's where your prophet starts
[35:14] all right so with that example in mind
[35:16] let's approach restoration
[35:19] by the way
[35:22] let's approach restoration
[35:25] let's don't say well i've got the
[35:27] message i got everything
[35:29] you only have the message that's been
[35:31] revealed to you
[35:34] all right is that plain enough
[35:36] if it ain't revealed
[35:39] then it's still letters on page that's
[35:41] right
[35:42] but if it's revealed it's come off the
[35:44] page into your heart
[35:46] in a reality all right now we didn't
[35:48] start out
[35:51] just because you think you come into
[35:52] this message and have read
[35:54] you didn't start out well i'm a
[35:56] manifested child that's right
[35:59] you know i've got everything
[36:02] no
[36:03] no
[36:04] i preach my own experience you do what
[36:06] you want to
[36:08] two years i was in this message seeking
[36:10] the baptism of the holy ghost reading
[36:12] six books a day and listening to two
[36:13] tapes had a pretty good understanding of
[36:15] the message
[36:16] but i never claimed just because i read
[36:19] and heard tapes that that meant i had
[36:21] the new birth
[36:23] i waited until i received an experience
[36:26] that matched the word
[36:29] in my experience back student in from
[36:31] their own
[36:32] i have been trying to grow in grace and
[36:34] knowledge
[36:35] i know everybody else says i come into
[36:37] the message that proves i got the holy
[36:38] ghost
[36:39] that's all right if you got it
[36:43] but what if you don't have it
[36:45] you ain't telling me i don't have it
[36:46] well that's a good reason to show you
[36:48] don't have it if you get upset with me
[36:50] i told a brother something one time he
[36:52] got offended and left here
[36:55] i was just telling him the truth
[36:57] i was telling him with people to go out
[36:59] you don't go acting like the devil
[37:02] commit adulteries and stuff like that
[37:04] and say you got the new birth
[37:06] don't tell me that i'm too old i'm sorry
[37:10] i believe in living the life of christ
[37:13] in the manifestation
[37:15] not living in adultery and claiming to
[37:16] be a born-again christian well i just
[37:19] got problems you know dave it had them
[37:24] yeah david didn't have a new birth
[37:25] either
[37:28] and he sure flat repented that he is
[37:29] what about you
[37:31] you say who are you talking to
[37:33] anybody that hears
[37:37] anybody here anybody out there that
[37:39] hears so you do what you're going to do
[37:41] you are anyway
[37:43] but if you've got the holy ghost and we
[37:45] talk about it last night if you got the
[37:47] holy ghost you know you don't have no
[37:48] problems with anybody correcting you
[37:51] oh yeah you may hurt hurt feelings yeah
[37:53] because we're human
[37:55] but when you see what's true is true
[37:58] then you're going to get rid of it
[38:00] all right
[38:01] so you get your feelings hurt
[38:05] what did the prophet say
[38:08] he said even what if the
[38:11] lord had somebody to say something to
[38:13] you
[38:14] to see how you would react
[38:18] amen
[38:19] you remember the man that was praying
[38:21] when brother adam had told him about the
[38:23] squirrels
[38:24] and that he killed that squirrel and the
[38:26] man prayed and said now lord to prove
[38:28] brother brown is right let him find that
[38:30] squirrel
[38:32] and boy him brother random and everybody
[38:34] there was upset because that man said
[38:36] and they asked the man later about it he
[38:37] said i don't remember praying that away
[38:43] well
[38:45] it was to try brother brown
[38:48] remember we've been trying to see
[38:49] whether we're sons and daughters of god
[38:51] and if we can't extend chastisement
[38:53] that's from here going that way then
[38:55] we're bastard
[38:57] playing language just you know forget it
[39:00] listen
[39:01] restoration deals then
[39:05] with restoring what has originally been
[39:08] here
[39:09] all right so now we must cover it
[39:12] in like stages
[39:14] all right
[39:16] to worry that you can understand it
[39:17] that's the only way i can follow it
[39:20] all right the new birth came on the day
[39:22] of pentecost
[39:24] okay
[39:26] according to joel 2
[39:29] that you're promised
[39:31] that in the last days that he would
[39:33] restore all things
[39:36] now notice what
[39:37] joel is talking about i'll get to that
[39:39] just a split second now i put my finger
[39:41] on our word remember but remember the
[39:44] new birth
[39:47] was here
[39:49] and if you've received the new birth
[39:53] if you have received the new birth then
[39:55] it would have to be the same new birth
[39:57] that they received on the day of
[39:58] pentecost
[40:00] will you agree yes is it two or three
[40:02] different new births is there something
[40:04] he said what about luke what luther had
[40:06] the baptism of the holy ghost the new
[40:08] birth for his age
[40:10] all right
[40:12] under justification all right now
[40:15] they've been restoration
[40:19] we can say that we've been in
[40:21] restoration
[40:22] all right now there's a difference
[40:24] between the word restoration and
[40:27] reformation
[40:29] right
[40:30] luther listen luther had the baptism of
[40:32] the holy ghost for his day wesley
[40:34] pentecost etc
[40:36] that was restoration
[40:39] all right but the doctrine he brought
[40:41] was reformation
[40:45] because he was trying to reform the
[40:48] church he never wanted to leave the
[40:50] catholic church i've got his own
[40:52] writings
[40:53] he wanted to stay and reform the church
[40:58] of course he called it restoration
[41:01] but that didn't make it restoration
[41:03] because he was trying to work on
[41:05] something on reformation
[41:08] and brother brown said reformation was
[41:10] fine
[41:11] but he said reformation won't make it
[41:13] we've got to be into restoration
[41:17] reformation is to reform that's why i
[41:19] don't preach like the preachers of this
[41:21] message quit cutting your higher
[41:22] equipment afraid quit doing that quit
[41:23] doing that quit doing that and you're a
[41:25] christian i don't believe that i believe
[41:27] get born again you will automatically
[41:29] quit this thing it may take a little
[41:31] while for the holy spirit to get to you
[41:33] but you will quit
[41:35] if you get restoration but if you get
[41:37] reformation you'll set an appeal and
[41:39] holler amen
[41:42] but i wish brother dale would preach
[41:43] against them women
[41:49] you come into reformation
[41:52] and there's no restoration to it i
[41:54] believe in restoration
[41:56] huh
[41:58] you reform
[42:00] uh the old 55 chevrolet
[42:03] that means it's heated up with rust it's
[42:05] going this way that way it's all messed
[42:07] up
[42:08] and really there is no hardly any way to
[42:10] say you've got a totally restored 55
[42:12] chevrolet
[42:13] because either that they've manufactured
[42:15] the parts if that's true and that can be
[42:17] put together and make it if not then
[42:19] you're just reforming the thing and
[42:21] you're painting over the rust
[42:23] and that's what people try to do in
[42:24] their spiritual life
[42:26] but restoration means to bring back
[42:28] they've got what these new new mustangs
[42:31] now
[42:32] they call it a restoration that's not
[42:33] restoration don't even look like the old
[42:35] mustang
[42:37] right that's man's words for what you're
[42:39] doing but restoration is dealing with
[42:42] what's been here all right the baptism
[42:44] of the holy ghost came on the day of
[42:45] pentecost
[42:47] according to joel it's promised that in
[42:49] the end time we would come back
[42:54] to a full restoration
[42:56] all right which would mean and you know
[42:58] your prophet the way he taught it
[43:00] that luther wesley and them received the
[43:02] holy ghost under their age which was
[43:04] only one
[43:06] stage of justification but that was the
[43:09] new birth of luther's day second stage
[43:11] was wesley's day but he said the third
[43:14] stage is the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:17] the restoration of the baptism of the
[43:19] holy ghost exactly like on the day of
[43:22] pentecost
[43:23] with the three thousand all right
[43:26] now you you follow me people don't take
[43:28] hear that see i placed it exactly so you
[43:31] say what i say and we're all right
[43:34] all right then see the three thousand
[43:36] start as babies
[43:38] so you and i start as babies
[43:40] whether you like it or not
[43:42] that's the way we start
[43:44] we're just babies
[43:47] that need to grow in grace and knowledge
[43:50] all right
[43:51] now
[43:52] then we can look at joel because joel
[43:55] made a key point that i want you to
[43:57] listen to
[43:58] joel said i'll restore the years of the
[44:01] cankerworm pineworm locust and
[44:02] caterpillar
[44:03] right right
[44:05] all right we know that from the
[44:07] restoration message of prophet brought
[44:09] okay they ate down the church and then
[44:11] started back in the days of martin
[44:13] luther all right to save time of
[44:15] preaching just get the point
[44:20] joy is dealing with restoration back to
[44:23] the faith of the fathers
[44:26] he's not dealing with restoration
[44:29] all the way
[44:30] because he specifically states what he's
[44:33] dealing with
[44:34] the years that the cankerworm palmorn
[44:37] locust and the caterpillar ate away
[44:40] it's specifically stating in the book of
[44:42] joel what he's dealing with he's dealing
[44:44] in restoration of what would end the
[44:46] church ages
[44:48] you know like in a book of acts and
[44:49] coming down
[44:51] and then ate away and then to restore
[44:53] back the church ages
[44:55] all right now he's dealing with then the
[44:57] faith of the fathers
[45:00] because the faith of the fathers was in
[45:02] the early church
[45:03] you agree yes brother ram actually
[45:06] brings it up with the ability for it to
[45:07] come up to the fourth church age because
[45:09] he said the pure unadulterated word goes
[45:11] into the ground under the fourth age all
[45:14] right so it was people up to there
[45:15] especially the messengers who had to me
[45:18] the way i see it believe it had the
[45:20] faith of the fathers
[45:22] which means they had the holy spirit
[45:25] right here pointing to the pyramid holy
[45:27] spirit down
[45:28] all right
[45:29] they had it like that see they had then
[45:33] the ministry of jesus christ
[45:37] the apostles had the ministry of jesus
[45:39] christ i've got quotes in here we'll get
[45:40] to in a minute
[45:42] i'm just giving an overall and then
[45:43] we'll drop back
[45:45] they had the ministry of jesus christ
[45:48] in the early church
[45:49] all right but they didn't have the
[45:51] headstone
[45:52] because it was rejected
[45:54] well the church of pentecost didn't
[45:56] reject it no but the people that it came
[45:58] to rejected
[46:02] and you better remember the people it
[46:04] wasn't today of pentecost were all
[46:06] jews
[46:08] so don't try to play games with me
[46:12] listen to what i'm saying
[46:16] it was a gentile church on the day of
[46:18] pentecost amen
[46:20] because it opened up but all of the ones
[46:22] in the upper room was jews
[46:24] so was the three thousand downstairs and
[46:27] so was the early church basically jews
[46:29] until a few gentiles at the house of
[46:31] canadians started coming in
[46:34] okay
[46:35] so now we're right
[46:37] that's why i don't mind standing up and
[46:38] preaching because when i say it just
[46:40] come and show me where i'm wrong
[46:42] that's not exalted that's true
[46:47] all right we see people say well we
[46:49] can't follow that line well why not
[46:50] because you've been taught something
[46:52] else
[46:55] but you see then there's the new birth
[46:59] then everybody that got the new birth
[47:01] got the new birth
[47:04] into the body of christ
[47:07] that it can be libel in lutheran
[47:08] wesley's day yes
[47:10] but they still receive the new birth but
[47:12] brother brown said on a zeus street that
[47:15] the holy ghost came back
[47:17] exactly like it was in the book of acts
[47:22] which means it took three stages to get
[47:24] to that point luther's age it was just
[47:26] justification wesley's age was
[47:28] sanctification but a zeus's trick was
[47:30] the baptism of the holy ghost
[47:33] the person of jesus christ coming back
[47:35] all right now we're still in the message
[47:37] see but then looking forward see
[47:41] if we can get to the faith of the
[47:42] fathers and we cannot get to the
[47:45] headstone without the faith of the
[47:46] fathers i don't care what you think of
[47:48] where you're born there and i told you
[47:49] the other day people say well i'm right
[47:51] up here i i've got to be here because
[47:53] i'm born in this age that's glad you'll
[47:55] see that's where i'm born there
[47:57] and that's as blind as a
[47:59] well forget it
[48:01] i just don't believe it that way
[48:05] i believe in the growing and grace of
[48:06] knowledge
[48:08] i believe you're born again
[48:10] by the new birth
[48:11] but that's a baby
[48:13] and then you start growing in grace and
[48:14] knowledge and we must come to the faith
[48:17] of the fathers but where do you hear
[48:18] that taught anymore in the message
[48:22] i'm serious
[48:24] what are you hearing the message anymore
[48:25] taught about the faith in the fathers
[48:27] so you listen and go out where does it
[48:29] talk
[48:31] where do they even mention faith of the
[48:32] father oh we're so high and mighty
[48:36] until we know what that's that's behind
[48:39] us
[48:41] it can't be behind you if it ain't
[48:43] restored
[48:45] all
[48:46] right if it ain't restored it can't be
[48:50] behind you
[48:52] then you'll see
[48:54] that according to the church age book
[48:56] this prophet was to do two things
[48:58] one turn the hearts and the children
[49:00] back to the faith of the fathers to
[49:01] reveal the thunders which is revelation
[49:03] contained in the seventh seal and be
[49:05] these divinely reveal mystery truths
[49:06] that literally turn us back
[49:09] all right
[49:10] so then that's what i'm trying to show
[49:12] you
[49:12] restoration
[49:14] the new work restoration the faith of
[49:17] the fathers
[49:21] but then there has to be a restoration
[49:24] of the minister of jesus christ
[49:29] he said well you just said that the
[49:30] disciples had the ministry of jesus
[49:32] christ that's right
[49:34] but the disciples didn't have a
[49:35] headstone
[49:37] it was rejected
[49:39] i know that's offensive to a lot of
[49:41] people because of their doctrinal issues
[49:44] but i can't help it i just believe what
[49:46] the prophet had to say
[49:47] see there's more to restoration than to
[49:50] just talk about the new birth
[49:53] there's more to restoration than to just
[49:55] talk about the faith of the fathers
[50:00] what about the ministry of jesus christ
[50:02] that was promised to come forth in the
[50:03] last days
[50:07] and if you and i don't have that
[50:09] ministry then we don't have the
[50:10] headstone
[50:12] playing language
[50:14] so what did the prophet of god say
[50:15] number two in your notes faith delivered
[50:17] them to the saints look down at the
[50:19] bottom you read all the way in between
[50:20] he's talking about deliverance of
[50:21] science being delivered today same faith
[50:23] that was once delivered to the sciences
[50:25] being delivered today
[50:27] middle paragraph
[50:28] you know the sun at rose knees comes in
[50:30] the west what did he say after life
[50:33] it'll be light in the evening time the
[50:35] holy spirit's here with the same
[50:37] ministry that was delivered to the lord
[50:40] by the lord jesus christ to his apostles
[50:49] the sign ministry of jesus christ
[50:52] delivered
[50:54] by the lord jesus to his apostles
[50:57] all right now the none of the apostles
[51:00] preached anything about the seals right
[51:04] none of the apostles now i know matthew
[51:06] mark luke and john mentioned some talks
[51:08] about son of man but get my point paul
[51:10] never talked about son of man
[51:13] peter never talked about son of man
[51:17] it wasn't written in the new testament
[51:18] because they didn't understand the new
[51:20] testament is not matthew mark luke and
[51:23] john
[51:24] the new testament begins in the book of
[51:26] acts
[51:27] so from the book of acts on you don't
[51:30] hear the son of man
[51:33] being spoken of because they didn't
[51:34] understand
[51:37] they only understood
[51:39] the fact that they must get born again
[51:41] and they must have the faith of the
[51:42] father you said well brother you're sure
[51:44] strong in making those statements
[51:46] 40-something years i've been preaching
[51:47] that ought to be pretty strong about
[51:48] what i believe
[51:50] you know and if you don't understand
[51:52] what i'm talking about come to me out of
[51:53] church we'll sit down and talk about it
[51:57] and and you know and we'll deal with it
[52:00] all right but look now what he goes on
[52:01] to say
[52:04] in the message number three of your
[52:05] notes jesus christ the same yesterday
[52:07] and jesus christ was saying 1956 225
[52:10] paragraph or e60
[52:13] he said i'm late
[52:15] you know see the more there's more
[52:17] things i do you do and then you must be
[52:19] saying i'm late for suffering said did
[52:20] the apostles do it
[52:22] the same ministry that jesus had the
[52:24] apostles carried on just like exactly
[52:28] like they always did
[52:32] now reading these to prove the point the
[52:34] disciples had the ministry of jesus
[52:36] christ
[52:37] and then we'll read that they didn't
[52:39] have the ministry of jesus christ so
[52:41] you're going to have to understand
[52:44] stages of what we're talking about
[52:46] all right then that would come into that
[52:48] point see it has to be a restoration
[52:51] look at number four on your notes
[52:54] uh paragraph 189 what shall i do with
[52:56] jesus
[52:58] 63
[52:59] 11-24
[53:01] we got the vindicated word of god here
[53:02] vindicated proving by the spirit that
[53:05] he's received us and give us the baptism
[53:07] of the holy ghost we're baptized into
[53:09] the name of jesus christ the same gospel
[53:12] the same signs the same wonders the same
[53:14] ministry
[53:17] well that was only brother branham well
[53:20] you go ahead and do what you want to
[53:22] even the same pillar of fire visible
[53:24] among us showing the signs and wonders
[53:28] brother bosworth i'm wrong on quoting
[53:30] the correct one you get it in the right
[53:32] one out there
[53:33] brother branham prayed for a man's nose
[53:35] re-restored and a few days later it was
[53:37] restored brother bolivar was praying it
[53:39] was restored instantly
[53:43] do you argue over about it
[53:46] okay
[53:48] he wants the same gospel
[53:50] the same signs the same wonders the same
[53:52] ministry
[53:54] even the same pillar of fire visible
[53:56] among us showing the signs and wonders
[53:58] there is not an excuse no work and
[54:01] that's exactly what the bible said would
[54:03] take place in the last days
[54:05] and a call from malachi 4
[54:08] to restore the faith that the children
[54:11] back to the faith of the fathers
[54:15] all right
[54:16] again back to the fathers again excuse
[54:19] me all right
[54:21] so then
[54:22] the disciples had the ministry of jesus
[54:25] christ
[54:28] but the cake and worm palm worm locus
[54:30] and caterpillar take that back
[54:34] all right then you started in martin
[54:36] luther
[54:38] he would the just shall live by faith
[54:40] and the message of martin luther of the
[54:43] just shall live by faith is a
[54:45] restoration message
[54:51] but luther made it a reformation message
[54:57] because he tried to reform with the
[54:59] truth of restoration
[55:02] and he went on run around said he would
[55:03] be standing here now
[55:07] not that sensible
[55:09] all right
[55:10] but you see
[55:13] then
[55:16] when we we get to the place of talking
[55:18] or speaking of like we are in the day of
[55:21] the manifestation of the sons of god
[55:25] from romans
[55:27] 8 19
[55:28] see
[55:30] there has to be something about taking
[55:32] place in this end time
[55:34] that will tie together all that's been
[55:36] down through there
[55:39] and bring it into the headstone
[55:42] the to the church
[55:44] and that's be when as i preach another
[55:46] day when your name is just as good on
[55:48] checkbook as your father's
[55:53] and that'll be when the prophet would be
[55:55] talking about it
[55:57] the word and he's saying you know
[55:59] there's going to be a time come when you
[56:01] will speak the word
[56:04] and it'll create
[56:08] all right now
[56:10] we see
[56:12] the disciples have the statue of a
[56:14] perfect man i keep pointing to it
[56:16] they had this holy spirit going all the
[56:18] way down
[56:19] but they did not have a headstone
[56:23] it was rejected he said we'll prove it
[56:25] to you okay look down that number
[56:28] five on your notes
[56:32] adoption
[56:33] 1965-22 paragraph for you know paragraph
[56:36] 32. now we're coming right down to how
[56:39] many i believe this woman here raised
[56:41] her hand that she studied the pyramid
[56:43] you know the purity it never was kept
[56:45] was it
[56:46] listen to it
[56:48] never did have a capstone put on it
[56:51] they talked about the natural pyramid of
[56:53] egypt right
[56:54] what is it chiops is that the one is
[56:57] that the name of cheop it's the one
[56:58] there with no top all right
[57:01] they never couldn't find even find it
[57:04] they don't know what ever happened to it
[57:06] why
[57:07] why wasn't the capstone put on
[57:10] the headstone why wasn't it put on that
[57:12] cheots which is to be a
[57:14] a bible and stone right
[57:17] but why was it not put on
[57:19] the headstone on the top of it because
[57:21] he was rejected when he come
[57:24] he was the rejected stone that's right
[57:27] but it will be capped
[57:32] so now the headstone hadn't come
[57:37] it didn't come with the disciples
[57:40] they only had the ministry of jesus
[57:42] christ
[57:44] jesus christ preached the seals where's
[57:45] any of the disciples talking about the
[57:47] seals
[57:51] come on bridget bible
[57:53] matthew mark luke and john now come on
[57:55] matthew martin luke and john is not the
[57:57] new testament the new testament begun in
[57:59] the book of acts i don't care what your
[58:01] bible says
[58:03] you tell people turn to the first book
[58:05] of of
[58:06] the new testament they'll turn to
[58:07] matthew that's not the first book
[58:09] because the test of the test the death
[58:11] of the testator hadn't come
[58:14] the new testament being again on the
[58:15] death pentecost
[58:18] which is the book of acts
[58:20] well that's just a technical point
[58:24] so what's technical is true that's right
[58:26] that's right
[58:27] you know technicalities are true
[58:31] all right but now what are you talking
[58:32] about
[58:35] what was rejected
[58:38] this will
[58:38] hinge in for us later
[58:41] what was rejected
[58:47] the word
[58:51] the word was what was rejected
[58:56] but the disciples received
[58:59] what they could comprehend amen
[59:02] and a lot of things they said we don't
[59:04] understand
[59:08] he opened their understanding in the
[59:10] book of acts
[59:12] but it was only to
[59:15] what he had told
[59:16] them that's why they didn't talk about
[59:19] the seals and things
[59:22] because they were not comprehended
[59:26] right
[59:26] we didn't talk about them because nobody
[59:28] couldn't comprehend oh yeah we baptised
[59:30] we used to preach
[59:31] matthew 24 as a sixth seal
[59:34] but we put everybody in there including
[59:36] us
[59:40] all right but now follow what we're
[59:41] talking about
[59:44] look at number
[59:45] six on your notes
[59:48] i got 135 70 wicks of daniel 361 806 go
[59:52] right down to the bottom read all the
[59:54] way down through there and see how it
[59:56] shaped up and what it's been doing and
[59:58] there's come ministry among them just
[1:00:00] exactly like the ministry of jesus
[1:00:02] christ
[1:00:04] now what they got they got the thing in
[1:00:06] condition
[1:00:12] in condition
[1:00:14] now what's the next thing there's this
[1:00:16] rejected stone to the pyramid cut out of
[1:00:19] the mountain without what without hands
[1:00:22] god sent it do you see it the rejected
[1:00:24] one the rejected stone is the head of
[1:00:28] the is the head the capstone the very
[1:00:31] one that they rejected through this
[1:00:33] gentile church age
[1:00:35] is christ
[1:00:38] are you reading it
[1:00:41] so the headstone wasn't there
[1:00:43] they rejected it and christ was not cut
[1:00:46] and put in here as a viker or son of god
[1:00:49] or some great dignitary in the church
[1:00:52] he's the holy spirit and the cap of the
[1:00:54] pyramid will be christ's coming do you
[1:00:57] see it
[1:01:00] all right
[1:01:02] so
[1:01:03] the capstone headstone
[1:01:08] was rejected
[1:01:12] they rejected the word
[1:01:16] it's easy to see that the natural jew
[1:01:18] rejected
[1:01:19] the atonement
[1:01:21] the salvation
[1:01:23] but what did they really reject
[1:01:25] i thought we believed according to john
[1:01:27] 1 1 and on down to about verse 14
[1:01:30] that in the beginning was the word and
[1:01:32] the word was with god and the word was
[1:01:34] god in verse 14 said and the word was
[1:01:36] made flesh and dwelt among us right so
[1:01:38] what did they turn down
[1:01:40] the word
[1:01:43] there he come riding into jerusalem on a
[1:01:45] white donkey right
[1:01:47] who the word
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:51] what
[1:01:52] but
[1:01:55] it was rejected
[1:01:58] he became the rejected stone
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:03] according to the scripture
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:06] so now joel is dealing with what was
[1:02:08] down through the ages the faith of the
[1:02:10] fathers repeating what i said
[1:02:13] new birth is restoration of the new murk
[1:02:15] faith in the fathers is true
[1:02:17] joy to
[1:02:20] but then the headstone was rejected
[1:02:23] now let me give you a simple
[1:02:24] illustration
[1:02:26] i'll have to do that because that's the
[1:02:27] human mind
[1:02:29] those disciples could not comprehend
[1:02:32] even what jesus was saying
[1:02:36] because they did not have the new birth
[1:02:40] now even though
[1:02:44] he opened their understanding of the
[1:02:47] scriptures
[1:02:51] is that true
[1:02:52] the two on the road to emmaus he opened
[1:02:54] their understanding when they came back
[1:02:55] and gathered in jerusalem after his
[1:02:58] resurrection he opened their
[1:02:59] understanding of the scriptures
[1:03:02] but they did not have the new birth
[1:03:05] so no man can call jesus the christ
[1:03:10] except it be by the baptism of the holy
[1:03:13] spirit am i quoting the prophet
[1:03:17] so even though they had their
[1:03:18] understanding opened
[1:03:21] as to see things
[1:03:24] why would they in the book of acts say
[1:03:26] are you going to restore the kingdom to
[1:03:29] israel
[1:03:30] talking to the man that was standing
[1:03:32] there resurrected in front of them
[1:03:37] acts 1 8 read your bible
[1:03:41] they said you're going to restore the
[1:03:42] kingdom of israel he says you don't know
[1:03:43] what you're talking about
[1:03:46] you don't understand
[1:03:48] that this is a spiritual kingdom in
[1:03:49] other words
[1:03:50] it's got to be the baptism of the holy
[1:03:52] ghost that you've got to go to the upper
[1:03:53] room and wait
[1:03:58] they didn't understand what those seals
[1:04:00] of matthew 24 was no writer wrote of
[1:04:02] them
[1:04:07] so that was withholding from them even
[1:04:09] on the day of pentecost when the holy
[1:04:11] ghost fell on 120 it only quickened what
[1:04:14] they had of their understanding that was
[1:04:17] open
[1:04:20] are you listening
[1:04:22] so he opened their understanding up to a
[1:04:24] certain point
[1:04:28] about him and his resurrection and how
[1:04:30] he was the word and how that he was the
[1:04:32] fulfillment of the old testament and how
[1:04:34] he had to pay the price and all the
[1:04:35] things and even could open understanding
[1:04:38] of joy to tell him what would have to
[1:04:41] happen and how that it would go into the
[1:04:44] ground because remember when he was here
[1:04:45] he said that unless the corner week dies
[1:04:47] and goes into the ground and abides
[1:04:49] alone he could open their understanding
[1:04:51] to a lot of
[1:04:52] things but he didn't open their
[1:04:54] understanding to what those fields and
[1:04:56] things were i use that because that's
[1:04:58] one thing that everybody can relate to
[1:05:03] and then we'll see if we can get down
[1:05:04] that far in the message this afternoon
[1:05:08] that brother around calls the ten
[1:05:09] commandments the seals
[1:05:18] that's wrong with the ten commandments
[1:05:23] the ten commandments is god in a letter
[1:05:24] form right
[1:05:28] if i could have been quickened to those
[1:05:29] back there
[1:05:30] what would have moses done with it
[1:05:34] but all he could say don't commit
[1:05:35] adultery
[1:05:37] you know we'll kill you
[1:05:41] right
[1:05:43] are you listening
[1:05:44] see
[1:05:47] but see the rejected stone
[1:05:51] was rejected the word was rejected back
[1:05:54] there
[1:05:55] see
[1:05:58] you know i wrote it like this see people
[1:06:00] when i try to explain something then
[1:06:02] they come along behind me so well it's
[1:06:04] all just restoration i don't understand
[1:06:07] why brother dale spent so much time
[1:06:08] breaking this down
[1:06:10] he's done it over the years of breaking
[1:06:12] down these things you know and why does
[1:06:14] he come along now and try to break it's
[1:06:16] just restoration
[1:06:20] okay
[1:06:20] do what you want to
[1:06:24] i'm only trying my best to
[1:06:26] show us what restoration is
[1:06:29] and how this in stages now because you
[1:06:32] got the new birth don't mean you are
[1:06:33] restored to the faith of the father and
[1:06:36] because that you could have even the
[1:06:37] faith of the fathers don't mean that you
[1:06:39] have the headstone
[1:06:41] you have a connection to it because when
[1:06:43] you receive the new birth you have a
[1:06:45] connection to it there's nothing in
[1:06:46] between here this is all done don't try
[1:06:48] to lower that headstone just fill in the
[1:06:51] sides of it it's all one pyramid it's
[1:06:52] all the body of jesus christ
[1:06:55] and sure when you received the new birth
[1:06:56] you started a drawing from that
[1:06:58] headstone that's what's calling us
[1:07:00] upward
[1:07:02] but it doesn't mean it's here either
[1:07:05] because it's only here when god makes it
[1:07:07] manifest
[1:07:08] all right
[1:07:10] see what i'm trying to do is to tell us
[1:07:13] what to look for
[1:07:15] and to tell us what has been taking
[1:07:17] place
[1:07:20] and then to tell us about what will take
[1:07:22] place when the adoptional situation
[1:07:24] comes of the
[1:07:27] romans 8 and 19 that the world is
[1:07:29] waiting for in 1920 are worth waiting on
[1:07:32] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:07:33] daughters of god
[1:07:35] why
[1:07:36] because that's what i'm talking about
[1:07:38] here see the faith of the fathers is not
[1:07:40] the stage of adoption that the world is
[1:07:42] waiting for
[1:07:47] sure it was waiting for that because it
[1:07:49] must be in order to come
[1:07:51] but the real thing they're waiting for
[1:07:53] is the headstone which is promised to
[1:07:56] come in this day
[1:08:00] now i'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:08:02] then we'll read it later because i want
[1:08:03] to be in another message this evening i
[1:08:04] know but see the headstone i'm talking
[1:08:07] about is the word
[1:08:12] the things jesus didn't tell the
[1:08:14] disciples didn't quicken until there he
[1:08:16] comes to quicken in the last days the
[1:08:18] opening of the seals the things that are
[1:08:20] understood
[1:08:23] in our day
[1:08:25] is the headstone
[1:08:28] all right i'll get to it later
[1:08:30] what was it back there
[1:08:33] see everybody wants anointings and
[1:08:35] headstones and all like that they want
[1:08:36] to just put it all together
[1:08:39] but remember and i gave it to you some
[1:08:41] dedication
[1:08:42] is the message
[1:08:44] and brother brown calls those two tables
[1:08:47] of stone
[1:08:48] that come into the temple back there
[1:08:50] when solomon got it finished in 1st
[1:08:52] kings by 8
[1:08:54] when it was all finished
[1:08:57] and those two tables of stone came in
[1:08:59] and took their place
[1:09:01] he said then the shekinah glory failed
[1:09:08] he calls those
[1:09:10] tables of stone the capping stuff
[1:09:14] that's what i believe they are
[1:09:15] the word of god
[1:09:18] the shekinah glory quickens that and
[1:09:20] makes it alive
[1:09:23] see
[1:09:24] the temple was set everything was ready
[1:09:26] brother and said every stone was in play
[1:09:28] he said everybody was standing in place
[1:09:30] he said but there was nothing taking
[1:09:32] place but he said the last thing is when
[1:09:34] them two tables of stone rested
[1:09:38] he said then that's your kind of glory
[1:09:40] fail
[1:09:42] that's all i've ever talked and all i've
[1:09:44] ever believed
[1:09:47] i'm looking for an anointing to strike
[1:09:48] this church yes sir
[1:09:51] that will take us in direction amen
[1:09:53] but if we're not in place
[1:09:55] it don't do no good right if we're not
[1:09:58] tooted and trained to the right place
[1:10:00] the holy ghost can fall all over the
[1:10:02] place and we can shout all our way and
[1:10:04] still die and go by the grace right i
[1:10:06] want to change i don't know what you're
[1:10:08] talking about
[1:10:10] so the world is waiting for
[1:10:15] for the what
[1:10:17] do it not unite with a church all right
[1:10:19] look at number eight on your note
[1:10:21] let's see
[1:10:25] all right let's read number seven we
[1:10:27] didn't get through that just to just
[1:10:28] show that it was rejected too
[1:10:30] i didn't read that one in a manifested
[1:10:32] songs of god
[1:10:33] 1965-18 paragraph 47
[1:10:37] but as we grow from lutheran age
[1:10:41] let's be real and it's built up like
[1:10:43] this to a point and the stone on the
[1:10:45] capstone never was found they never did
[1:10:48] put a cap on top of the pyramid i don't
[1:10:50] know whether you know it or not
[1:10:52] the big pyramid of egypt has never had a
[1:10:54] top stone on it why the capstone was
[1:10:57] rejected
[1:10:58] christ the head said he was rejected
[1:11:01] but as we grow from the lutheran age
[1:11:03] baptist age methodist age pentecostal
[1:11:05] age
[1:11:06] we're right in up to the capping stone
[1:11:09] now see waiting and longing for that
[1:11:12] capping stone to set down
[1:11:15] the building's complete see all right
[1:11:18] when all this is done
[1:11:19] have not you read in the scriptures the
[1:11:21] stone was rejected of course we know
[1:11:22] that was talking to the solomon's temple
[1:11:25] but it but the rejected stone has become
[1:11:29] the chief of the corner
[1:11:31] but i'm saying this only to make a
[1:11:33] picture to you
[1:11:35] and now in the bible we're living in the
[1:11:37] last days the top of the pyramid the
[1:11:39] cross
[1:11:40] fishes of the cancer age in the zodiac
[1:11:43] in the time of the coming of leo the
[1:11:46] line
[1:11:46] in the capping stone
[1:11:48] and in the days of the manifestation of
[1:11:50] the sons of god in the bible see where
[1:11:53] we're at we're right at the end time
[1:11:58] so now he says that's what the world's
[1:11:59] waiting on right the capping style
[1:12:02] the capping stone will be what the word
[1:12:04] in the bride
[1:12:06] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:12:08] daughters of god all right
[1:12:10] now we're going down to number eight
[1:12:12] adoption preach 1965 22 the evening
[1:12:15] service paragraph 19
[1:12:17] read all the way down get down to the
[1:12:19] um before why before the atonement was
[1:12:22] made before the holy ghost never poured
[1:12:23] out before all the old testament on down
[1:12:25] there couldn't have been manifestation
[1:12:27] it didn't it had to wait until this time
[1:12:30] now all things has been brought coming
[1:12:33] shaping up to a headstone
[1:12:35] to the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:12:37] coming back and the spirit of god coming
[1:12:40] into these men
[1:12:43] he didn't say one man these men so
[1:12:46] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:12:48] so close like christ
[1:12:50] till it will
[1:12:51] till it'll join him and his church
[1:12:54] together
[1:12:55] so nice plain language
[1:12:58] that don't have to be interpreted it
[1:12:59] does
[1:13:01] go on down number nine abraham's
[1:13:02] covenant confirmed 61-10
[1:13:06] he said look at today look what we see
[1:13:08] today and find out what did i say about
[1:13:10] the pyramid
[1:13:12] it'll have to be honed and so perfectly
[1:13:14] set in
[1:13:15] all the shavings and everything until
[1:13:17] the headstone will have to fit just
[1:13:19] exact just to fit just perfectly in see
[1:13:24] the rejected headstone will have to come
[1:13:26] back the covenant
[1:13:28] the life that was in christ is in the
[1:13:30] church the holy spirit
[1:13:32] all right so it's got to come back it's
[1:13:34] got to be healed
[1:13:35] all right
[1:13:36] see then there's the coming of the
[1:13:37] headstone
[1:13:39] or the word of god that jesus christ had
[1:13:42] but did not place in a disciple i wrote
[1:13:45] down here explain this at least
[1:13:47] okay
[1:13:49] explain this at length
[1:13:52] does everybody understand
[1:13:54] what i've tried to explain up to this
[1:13:55] point
[1:13:59] that even though the disciples had the
[1:14:01] new birth
[1:14:03] even though they had the faith of the
[1:14:05] fathers
[1:14:08] because that you didn't use novices to
[1:14:10] write the bible
[1:14:12] you know they didn't use none of the
[1:14:13] ones it was just a baby to write the
[1:14:14] bible
[1:14:15] they were all manifested sons of god for
[1:14:17] the time i said for the time
[1:14:21] all right
[1:14:22] and in doing that see
[1:14:24] then
[1:14:27] we've got to be restored back to where
[1:14:29] they were
[1:14:31] before we can talk about the headstone
[1:14:38] that's what people don't like to hear
[1:14:41] like richard said he said you've never
[1:14:42] heard anybody explain stature of a
[1:14:44] perfect man what brought around and said
[1:14:46] you must have these things
[1:14:50] it's not a choice that's not a thought
[1:14:52] you must have them
[1:14:56] if not
[1:14:59] then we don't even talk about the other
[1:15:01] but that's what people are saying well
[1:15:03] bless god and i receive that new birth i
[1:15:04] got that headstone
[1:15:07] now where's the bible and where's the
[1:15:09] prophet's message to show that from
[1:15:13] because i've just shown you up to the
[1:15:14] position
[1:15:16] to where that we've got to come back to
[1:15:18] the faith of the fathers to be waiting
[1:15:20] on the headstone
[1:15:22] now i believe individuals
[1:15:26] can reach the headstone
[1:15:28] above other individuals
[1:15:31] all right i believe brother brown was
[1:15:32] capped off don't you
[1:15:35] i believe he had the headstone because
[1:15:38] he taught us the word
[1:15:40] individuals can be there
[1:15:43] and i know people argued with me years
[1:15:45] ago about it that's all right it proved
[1:15:47] to be true
[1:15:48] that brother branham had the faith of
[1:15:49] the fathers he had the headstone and he
[1:15:52] died and went by the grave
[1:15:54] because i've had people tell me say if
[1:15:55] you've got the headstone you can't die
[1:15:58] now show me that in the bible show what
[1:15:59] the prophet's message
[1:16:01] brought around god i believe he had the
[1:16:03] headstone
[1:16:05] he died he's waiting on you and i yeah
[1:16:09] but that's where people just take their
[1:16:10] own thoughts see they think so much
[1:16:11] about oh when the headstone you just
[1:16:13] can't die
[1:16:15] when the body as a unit
[1:16:19] is pounded off by the headstone death is
[1:16:22] destroyed right
[1:16:23] to those
[1:16:25] right
[1:16:26] but it may just be a handful
[1:16:31] it may just be a handful of people the
[1:16:34] prophet might be right when he said one
[1:16:35] hour of estate so you better go find you
[1:16:37] another state
[1:16:41] all right
[1:16:43] but just trying to be true and write
[1:16:45] about it
[1:16:46] so i wrote down explain this at length
[1:16:48] one
[1:16:49] that the coming of the headstone
[1:16:51] are the word of god that jesus christ
[1:16:55] was
[1:16:57] now you know it was
[1:16:59] but he did not open the understanding of
[1:17:02] the disciples to what those seals and
[1:17:05] things were
[1:17:06] if he did your prophet was wrong when he
[1:17:08] said no man ever looked in on these
[1:17:09] things
[1:17:12] now come on did he make the statement he
[1:17:13] said no man ever looked on these things
[1:17:17] nobody outside the lord jesus
[1:17:22] had ever seen these things
[1:17:24] see then the adoption that the world is
[1:17:27] waiting on
[1:17:29] is the headstone to the church
[1:17:32] see
[1:17:34] it was promised let's read it matthew
[1:17:36] 17.
[1:17:41] what a promise
[1:17:43] is something that is spoken
[1:17:46] with reference for most of the time
[1:17:48] you know not every time but most of the
[1:17:50] time it's the promises is the future
[1:17:54] you know
[1:17:55] and so look at matthew 17 and 11.
[1:18:04] look at verse 10 while he turned in
[1:18:05] there and his disciples asked him saying
[1:18:07] well i didn't say the scribes to the
[1:18:08] lies must first come
[1:18:11] yeah all right now remember this is
[1:18:13] matthew 17 they're coming off the
[1:18:14] mountain
[1:18:15] from the adoption and look what he says
[1:18:18] don't tell the vision that no matter
[1:18:19] what son of man be risen again from the
[1:18:21] dead see in other words in the end time
[1:18:23] be risen again
[1:18:25] any disciples ask him saying why didn't
[1:18:26] they describe that elijah must first
[1:18:28] come and jesus answered and said unto
[1:18:30] them
[1:18:31] a lie shall truly first come and restore
[1:18:34] all kinds
[1:18:38] now at this time
[1:18:42] elias or elijah or john the baptist
[1:18:46] was already passed on
[1:18:49] so he said shall come
[1:18:52] and restore all things but i say unto
[1:18:54] you
[1:18:55] that now notice that's the capital
[1:18:57] letter
[1:18:59] if you don't believe that look back up
[1:19:00] in some of the others and you'll find
[1:19:01] that it's not as italicized that's
[1:19:03] italicized to the point because it's
[1:19:05] making a point but i say unto you that
[1:19:07] lies is come already and they knew him
[1:19:09] not but have done unto him whatsoever
[1:19:12] they listed likewise shall
[1:19:14] likewise shall also the son of man
[1:19:16] suffer of them see
[1:19:18] that allies
[1:19:22] see that elias which was
[1:19:25] john the baptist
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:29] all right
[1:19:31] elise
[1:19:33] double portion of elijah
[1:19:36] and elijah
[1:19:39] so at the time of jesus standing there
[1:19:43] three phases of the ministry of elijah
[1:19:46] was fulfilled so he says that
[1:19:49] elish
[1:19:52] has come already
[1:19:55] specifically stating john the baptist as
[1:19:57] being
[1:19:58] um
[1:19:59] isaiah what 42
[1:20:03] is that the word it is talking about you
[1:20:05] know how that it would be and how that
[1:20:07] they would stand and have shoelaces out
[1:20:08] of the things from isaiah which was john
[1:20:11] the baptist
[1:20:12] is it 40 42 i think it's 42 all right
[1:20:15] but see
[1:20:16] but he said a lot shall come
[1:20:19] and restore all things
[1:20:22] so without brother branham coming
[1:20:25] to you and i there is no possibility
[1:20:28] you know the message he brought
[1:20:30] there's no possibility for you and i to
[1:20:32] be anything
[1:20:33] other than a member of the body of
[1:20:34] christ
[1:20:38] and that would be
[1:20:39] down so far until it's almost as heat
[1:20:41] away
[1:20:42] and i i like what brother random said
[1:20:44] and it always bothered me until the lord
[1:20:46] spoke to me about it when he said one
[1:20:47] day i mean it's about 62 61 somewhere
[1:20:51] right now he said the baptist just now
[1:20:53] become a denomination you hear me say
[1:20:54] that a lot and you wonder what i'm
[1:20:56] talking about i'm sure
[1:20:58] what you see the denominations had not
[1:21:01] died and dried up as you think
[1:21:04] they were honest-hearted people that
[1:21:06] were seeking and they were not
[1:21:07] responsible
[1:21:09] but when brother branham brought his
[1:21:10] message
[1:21:13] they became denominations that had died
[1:21:19] but brother randall was so nice because
[1:21:21] i'd look at it and say well brother
[1:21:22] branham the the baptist nominated 100 or
[1:21:25] 200 years before
[1:21:27] you see
[1:21:28] he knew what he's saying
[1:21:31] when they rejected his messages when
[1:21:33] they really
[1:21:34] died
[1:21:36] he said them denominations they know
[1:21:38] about this
[1:21:41] he says there's not a one of them that
[1:21:42] don't
[1:21:43] that's right
[1:21:44] then they said well i never heard about
[1:21:46] this you know they do
[1:21:48] they know about it just like today they
[1:21:50] know about this message
[1:21:53] oral roberts has got it in his college
[1:21:57] this message
[1:21:59] they've got it doing it you know with it
[1:22:01] all right let's go on
[1:22:05] but see then
[1:22:08] what then is the headstone
[1:22:11] that we are waiting and expecting to
[1:22:14] come
[1:22:19] we know it's not the physical coming of
[1:22:21] the lord jesus
[1:22:24] because we
[1:22:25] are going to meet that physical lord
[1:22:29] jesus in the air
[1:22:33] so the headstone is not the physical
[1:22:35] coming of the lord jesus
[1:22:38] then
[1:22:40] it is the coming of the word
[1:22:46] let's get this in there
[1:22:49] just like it was to the natural temple
[1:22:51] when completed by solomon in first kings
[1:22:54] 8-11
[1:22:57] that when those stones went into place
[1:23:01] then the chicana glory fell
[1:23:04] what was the headstone brother and i
[1:23:06] wrote it like this brother branham
[1:23:08] explained to us what took place back
[1:23:11] there
[1:23:12] and what we are to expect
[1:23:15] all right he does
[1:23:18] because look at number
[1:23:20] 10 on your notes
[1:23:23] that's what i was quoting while ago so
[1:23:25] we'll read it and we'll try to get a
[1:23:26] little further and then we'll quit
[1:23:29] this is a message called dedication
[1:23:30] preaching elizabethton kentucky 1962 11
[1:23:34] 11 the morning service i like that 11
[1:23:36] 11.
[1:23:37] now you remember what that is
[1:23:42] i thought we believed that we were the
[1:23:43] level with our people
[1:23:45] right okay
[1:23:47] now we find out through the next chapter
[1:23:51] this is e30 and be e35 which is
[1:23:53] continuation right on true
[1:23:56] we find out true
[1:23:58] true
[1:23:59] in the next chapter
[1:24:01] where's that no t-h-o-u-g-h
[1:24:03] that when the builders found out that
[1:24:06] they were wrong
[1:24:07] it they had all the other stones there
[1:24:10] but the reason they couldn't get them
[1:24:12] together was because there was a hole
[1:24:14] left
[1:24:14] there was something that wasn't right
[1:24:18] all right
[1:24:19] now we already have the stones
[1:24:23] the stones god for ordained
[1:24:26] unless
[1:24:28] and yet
[1:24:29] and see and we've got them all the way
[1:24:32] from ephesus to ladies
[1:24:36] okay
[1:24:37] we're only waiting for the headstone
[1:24:40] that the builders rejected
[1:24:42] waiting for his coming the capping stone
[1:24:45] and when these great stones are
[1:24:47] confessions and we know that confession
[1:24:50] is a stone
[1:24:52] that's when it found its final resting
[1:24:54] place
[1:24:56] all right now he's in the temple right
[1:24:58] there's the kind of glory that followed
[1:25:01] those capping stones the stone
[1:25:06] not the corner the capping stone
[1:25:09] the main thing
[1:25:11] all other stones would have was of none
[1:25:13] effect until then
[1:25:15] but this main stone came in the
[1:25:18] headstone
[1:25:19] and took its place positionally for its
[1:25:21] resting place for that generation
[1:25:24] the glory of god filled a place where
[1:25:26] they were sitting and there's a kind of
[1:25:28] glory upon all the whole building and
[1:25:30] the glory was so great so the priests
[1:25:31] could not even minister because of their
[1:25:33] glory
[1:25:34] all right what was the last thing that
[1:25:36] was brought into the temple go back and
[1:25:37] read it there
[1:25:40] in kings
[1:25:43] the ark of the covenant
[1:25:46] right
[1:25:48] what was in the ark of the covenant
[1:25:53] the ten commandments
[1:25:55] now plus
[1:25:58] plus as i said
[1:26:01] there's five books
[1:26:03] that was written by moses genesis exodus
[1:26:05] leviticus number deuteronomy
[1:26:09] those five books were in set in little
[1:26:11] pouches that went with the ark of the
[1:26:12] covenant
[1:26:15] what was moses trying to explain
[1:26:20] when he said god is not over the sea
[1:26:22] that one should go there he's not up in
[1:26:23] heaven
[1:26:28] see paul says the law is spiritual
[1:26:33] but he said but i'm carnal
[1:26:38] the law the prophet said is the ten
[1:26:40] commandments
[1:26:43] the ten commandments is what brother
[1:26:44] brown said that jesus sowed
[1:26:48] you need those quotes
[1:26:51] he sowed the word of god is that true
[1:26:55] so there's nothing wrong with the ten
[1:26:56] commandments
[1:26:58] it's our understanding
[1:27:01] well that's just a book of rules no it's
[1:27:03] not a book of rules that's where you're
[1:27:04] wrong
[1:27:06] that's why it killed them that's why
[1:27:07] paul would say the law is spiritual it's
[1:27:11] the word of god amen
[1:27:13] we said our carnality is what's killing
[1:27:16] us
[1:27:18] he said the thing i thought was life
[1:27:21] i found to be deaf what
[1:27:25] the law but that's not what he said what
[1:27:27] he thought there was life in keeping the
[1:27:30] law to the letter
[1:27:32] but then he found out he couldn't keep
[1:27:34] it to the letter
[1:27:37] and he thought it was killing him
[1:27:41] all right
[1:27:42] see the ten commandments
[1:27:44] in the five books
[1:27:47] was the last thing placed in
[1:27:49] all right
[1:27:53] all right you said well we don't know
[1:27:54] about what that it would like to drop
[1:27:56] down to number
[1:27:57] uh
[1:27:59] 12 on your notes right down at the
[1:28:00] bottom of that page unveiling of god
[1:28:01] 1964 614
[1:28:04] the pillar of fire paragraph 300. the
[1:28:06] pillar of fire appearing visible among
[1:28:08] those identifying that the message is
[1:28:09] right
[1:28:10] like it did at mount sinai remember
[1:28:13] before the true message come forth
[1:28:15] moses preached and he led them out of
[1:28:18] egypt
[1:28:19] now that's exactly what brother branham
[1:28:21] has done preached and led us out of
[1:28:23] egypt amen spiritually speaking all
[1:28:26] right
[1:28:27] and there before the real commandments
[1:28:29] was laid down
[1:28:30] and they put it for instance the seals
[1:28:33] brought in
[1:28:36] the brother didn't have any trouble
[1:28:37] making the seals and the commandments
[1:28:38] the same
[1:28:40] god came down before the people amen and
[1:28:42] prove that moses was sent from him
[1:28:45] all right
[1:28:49] so what will happen
[1:28:52] the word of god must be preached
[1:28:57] but why is it so rejected by the people
[1:28:59] of this message
[1:29:02] he said brother dale
[1:29:04] i know it
[1:29:06] i'm sorry
[1:29:08] i'm sorry that i have to say the thing
[1:29:10] that i have to say
[1:29:12] i'm a human mortal
[1:29:15] i like people i like friends
[1:29:18] and stephen wilson heard him say the
[1:29:20] other day on the tape i laughed at him
[1:29:22] about it but he said people think i'm
[1:29:24] mean but he said i'm a pretty good guy
[1:29:28] people think that i'm mean and tough but
[1:29:30] i think i'm a pretty good guy you know
[1:29:32] i think i'm really that nice
[1:29:35] i'm not just lambasting people
[1:29:38] see why has the people turned down the
[1:29:40] thing
[1:29:43] that the prophet was brought to bring
[1:29:46] which is the opening of the seals
[1:29:50] well they haven't turned it down we've
[1:29:53] heard every one of them my pastor prep
[1:29:55] played every one of them in the church
[1:30:01] still ten commandments
[1:30:07] well my pastors preached on them
[1:30:10] well
[1:30:15] send me the tape
[1:30:19] i'd like to hear it
[1:30:24] well he preached three sermons on it
[1:30:25] well
[1:30:28] that's what brother said one time about
[1:30:29] the statue of a perfect man brother said
[1:30:31] i got 60 something tight there on the
[1:30:33] statue of pretty man he said why my
[1:30:34] goodness i preached an hour and a half
[1:30:37] and i'm not making no joke or throwing
[1:30:39] off on him he preached all he could see
[1:30:41] in our night
[1:30:44] but he took brother most sixty supper
[1:30:46] sermons
[1:30:49] it took brother around 30 something
[1:30:51] years
[1:30:52] to be able to preach it
[1:30:54] but you see
[1:30:58] why is people against
[1:31:00] the opening of the word
[1:31:03] what do you mean brother daley preachers
[1:31:05] have a service
[1:31:09] now i wasn't the one that made this
[1:31:11] statement your prophet did
[1:31:14] he said you can't understand the seals
[1:31:16] until you understand daniel 70 weeks
[1:31:19] now he made that statement
[1:31:22] see nobody wants to tackle daniel 70
[1:31:24] weeks they don't even talk about it
[1:31:26] oh yeah they preach we don't understand
[1:31:29] it it looks like one here it looks like
[1:31:31] something here it looks like this oh we
[1:31:33] preached it we preached it to our people
[1:31:35] we preached it we don't understand it
[1:31:38] the prophet said if you don't understand
[1:31:39] that you're 70 weeks you can't
[1:31:40] understand the season
[1:31:43] well yeah everybody said well we know
[1:31:45] all about the seal quite horse rider
[1:31:47] red or
[1:31:48] black
[1:31:51] just remember one thing
[1:31:54] the seal is the holy spirit the steel is
[1:31:56] not the antichrist
[1:32:00] the white horse rider writing off is the
[1:32:02] antichrist the holy spirit is the seal
[1:32:06] there's only one seal in the bible and
[1:32:08] that's ephesians 4 30 the holy spirit
[1:32:12] let's see people don't want that that's
[1:32:13] for another message that'll be wednesday
[1:32:15] night okay
[1:32:18] but listen
[1:32:22] the word has to be brought back to the
[1:32:24] church
[1:32:26] it has to be preached by the five-fold
[1:32:28] ministry amen well i just hear the
[1:32:30] prophet now you've been hearing the
[1:32:32] prophet 40 something years
[1:32:35] well where are y'all doing what do you
[1:32:36] all got
[1:32:38] we got the seed in the field
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:44] okay
[1:32:47] we ain't went after all these doctrines
[1:32:50] it's kept us from it the seed in the
[1:32:52] field
[1:32:56] show me any of these doctrines that we
[1:32:57] followed after
[1:33:01] no
[1:33:03] why because the word was contrary to it
[1:33:08] you see what are you expecting brother
[1:33:09] dale i'm expecting just what your
[1:33:10] prophet said that what happened there in
[1:33:13] kings that after that word reached his
[1:33:16] place and was set in order and that
[1:33:18] shekinah glory then
[1:33:21] after that ark of the covenant was put
[1:33:23] in that place after those ten
[1:33:25] commandments was there the capping
[1:33:27] stoned
[1:33:28] then
[1:33:29] what did he say number 12 on your notes
[1:33:31] which is questions and answers preached
[1:33:33] in 1954 103 the evening service
[1:33:36] paragraph 145 and it goes down to the
[1:33:38] bottom he talked about the holy ghost he
[1:33:40] said oh brother give me a church full of
[1:33:42] the holy ghost god will do in one year
[1:33:44] what all what all theologists fail to do
[1:33:47] in 2000 years you wait till the
[1:33:49] anointing of the church really strikes
[1:33:51] home to that faithful the little remnant
[1:33:54] after the door the gentile church is
[1:33:56] clothed oh god will anoint a church then
[1:33:59] he who's filthy let him be filthy still
[1:34:02] he who's righteous let him be righteous
[1:34:03] still and he who's holy let him be holy
[1:34:05] still and god will anoint the church
[1:34:07] with the power of god and things will be
[1:34:10] taken place
[1:34:11] not only that then but he's doing it now
[1:34:18] see
[1:34:19] he's doing it now
[1:34:23] he's anointing the church
[1:34:25] there'll be a final anointing
[1:34:28] that's forming a letter reign
[1:34:31] be a final anointing that one day will
[1:34:33] strike when the the
[1:34:35] mechanics comes to the dynamics because
[1:34:38] the mechanics will be a refilling of the
[1:34:39] holy spirit am i quoting brother brown
[1:34:44] you on tape if you don't know where
[1:34:46] that's at send me an email we'll send it
[1:34:48] to you
[1:34:52] anything i'd like to say other than
[1:34:53] statement other than my own private
[1:34:55] something i say and i will tell you when
[1:34:56] i say that
[1:34:58] you send it to me we'll sure find where
[1:35:00] the prophet said it
[1:35:03] but after the door the gentile church is
[1:35:05] closed
[1:35:08] god is going to anoint a church
[1:35:12] well you're just looking to the future
[1:35:14] no
[1:35:16] because i've told you
[1:35:17] if we don't get the present the future
[1:35:19] is no good if we don't stand here with
[1:35:22] the faith of the fathers there is no
[1:35:24] headstone doing us any good
[1:35:33] as i've always made the statement and i
[1:35:34] know people wouldn't like it that's all
[1:35:36] right
[1:35:37] everybody in the world today
[1:35:39] could have the faith of the fathers
[1:35:41] seven billion people
[1:35:43] that would still not change one body
[1:35:46] because it did not
[1:35:48] right
[1:35:50] that's why the prophet's message had to
[1:35:52] come
[1:35:53] right
[1:35:55] he had to stand at the faith of the
[1:35:57] fathers
[1:35:58] read the statue of a perfect man and see
[1:36:00] if he didn't say that's where he was
[1:36:02] standing
[1:36:04] fill me up lord with these things that i
[1:36:06] may teach others apostles prophet
[1:36:08] evangelist pastors teachers that are
[1:36:10] bringing into these things into the body
[1:36:12] of christ
[1:36:15] reading there where he says that the
[1:36:17] disciples had the least little nod from
[1:36:19] god and he said i went down there to
[1:36:20] pray for that baby or something like he
[1:36:22] said i waited he said well when i got
[1:36:24] that little nod
[1:36:29] he knew where he was standing come on
[1:36:31] musicians
[1:36:33] i'll just have to continue this to seed
[1:36:37] as you see
[1:36:38] i'm looking for something great to
[1:36:40] happen
[1:36:41] but i'm looking each day at what is
[1:36:43] taking place
[1:36:45] and i made my statement and i believe it
[1:36:47] there are some people that can be
[1:36:50] standing with a headstone fully revealed
[1:36:53] and standing with it capped off
[1:36:55] but that don't mean the change is coming
[1:36:57] because of that
[1:37:00] that means they can teach us
[1:37:03] how to attain
[1:37:05] now here is my point i've made it over
[1:37:07] and over and over and i'll keep making
[1:37:09] it
[1:37:10] let's don't make something so small and
[1:37:12] so little that we can just all stumble
[1:37:14] into it you know we're in the message we
[1:37:17] understand restoration
[1:37:21] but let's don't make it so great until
[1:37:23] nobody can reach it
[1:37:25] well the only one that could do anything
[1:37:27] like this is brother branham
[1:37:30] so we're waiting on him to come back
[1:37:34] to tell us this
[1:37:37] you see
[1:37:39] to me you missed the scale on either end
[1:37:41] right
[1:37:46] but to me i wanna just walk day by day
[1:37:50] i want to be like the
[1:37:51] like
[1:37:53] uh solomon them was
[1:37:56] i want to get everything ready
[1:37:58] because that's not what solomon done
[1:38:01] david couldn't take care of it remember
[1:38:04] too much blood
[1:38:07] too much fighting
[1:38:09] too much killing
[1:38:12] solomon
[1:38:13] set out then to provide even though
[1:38:16] david had brought in a lot of the
[1:38:17] material solomon set out to get
[1:38:19] everything ready
[1:38:22] and he wanted that temple built
[1:38:25] when he got it all finished
[1:38:29] he said there's one thing missing
[1:38:32] get that ark of the covenant now
[1:38:35] and take it in
[1:38:38] and he said lord
[1:38:40] we've done all we can do
[1:38:44] everything is in place
[1:38:47] and god says now i can do
[1:38:51] what i want to do
[1:38:53] and this is kind of glory fail
[1:38:56] if something's gonna have to come in to
[1:38:57] sweep over us to change these bodies
[1:39:01] but if we don't walk day by day and see
[1:39:03] what's taking place don't worry about
[1:39:05] that later let's stand all right what do
[1:39:06] we got 124
[1:39:08] 124 in the spiral book let's just sing a
[1:39:12] verse or something like this anybody has
[1:39:13] a knee call we never
[1:39:17] wanna leave
[1:39:27] oh
