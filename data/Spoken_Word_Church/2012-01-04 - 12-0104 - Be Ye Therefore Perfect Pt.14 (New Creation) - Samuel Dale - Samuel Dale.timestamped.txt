[1:40] stand still

[13:12] concerned with other things you know

[13:28] all the doings and all of the cooking
[13:30] and the things that you brought in all
[13:32] that we had a good time fellowshipping

[13:36] now remember the Bible study will not be
[13:38] this coming Saturday night always the
[13:41] first Saturday all right it'll be the
[13:43] second Saturday this month because uh we
[13:46] don't want to do it with weight being

[13:50] down with brother Collins preaching for
[13:51] him to get an opportunity you want to go
[13:54] down let us know and uh but we will have
[13:58] the bible study on the second Saturday
[14:00] of this month you know good to have her
[14:03] visitor back there with us and I think
[14:06] he's been here before down through the
[14:07] years but you know remember him he used
[14:09] to be a whole lot smaller and you know
[14:13] he's been downstairs I know the other
[14:16] few weeks ago but this is great to have
[14:19] it with us we always say to you when you
[14:20] come one time your visitor two times
[14:23] Port Elizabeth you don't get welcomed on
[14:25] the second time you just welcome the
[14:27] first time I'm glad to have you with us
[14:29] and hope you enjoy the services amen
[14:31] amen just remember those announcements
[14:34] you know uh
[14:36] two I'm going to try if I can tonight
[14:39] and Sunday morning to finish up this
[14:43] series that I've been in on be therefore
[14:45] perfect
[14:46] and probably Sunday afternoon now we
[14:50] will have a question and answers
[14:53] comments Etc so whatever you think about
[14:56] what I've said and talked to you write
[14:59] it down and turn it in and we'll be glad
[15:01] to read it and talk about it a little
[15:03] bit and see you know what everything is
[15:05] okay so that's
[15:08] all right I do remember that amen if
[15:11] you'd like turning your scripture turn
[15:12] to Matthew 5
[15:14] we've been reading this about
[15:18] 13 times
[15:20] and then we're going to Second
[15:21] Corinthians 5 7 I was laughing this
[15:24] brother
[15:25] Ernest about it he said you know run
[15:27] around and could take a four-leaf clover
[15:29] and priest for 10 years or something off
[15:31] of it and I'd laugh and told him that
[15:33] the other day I said I've read the same
[15:35] scriptures preached 60 sermons off the
[15:38] one scripture and I'd always read a
[15:40] subtitle you know a sub scripture to go
[15:42] with it but I have read the same
[15:44] scripture and preached 60 sermons so
[15:46] don't worry about it you can't exhaust
[15:48] the word of God that's right it just
[15:50] gets better and better and better along
[15:52] the way Matthew 5 and II Corinthians
[15:56] wow we thank you Lord Jesus for your
[15:59] love and your grace unto us we thank you
[16:00] for the day that we have and we ask you
[16:03] now that you would just come Among Us
[16:04] and Lord not being on looker to record
[16:07] our actions tonight but be a preeminent
[16:09] one in each one of our hearts and lives
[16:11] we love you we thank you we appreciate
[16:14] this year that we have because we look
[16:16] forward every day we go forward and
[16:19] knowing that we're one day closer to
[16:22] your returning and finishing up all that
[16:24] has to be done here and Lord we believe
[16:27] that we're in on that part of it and we
[16:29] thank you and we ask you to just help us
[16:31] now as we read your word talk about you
[16:34] if you would come on the scene in each
[16:36] one of our hearts and lives and speak to
[16:38] us forgive our sins and lead us by that
[16:41] understanding and keep us in Jesus name
[16:44] amen amen amen
[16:47] Matthew 5 37-48
[16:50] remember now this is the finishing up of
[16:54] the Beatitudes
[16:56] and then the Lord Jesus is sitting down
[16:59] and just come when he's told you how
[17:00] blessed you are
[17:02] now he's setting down the nature or
[17:06] character or or things that we should
[17:09] have to be as his children and showing
[17:14] this to be like him all right
[17:16] let your communication be a verse 37 99
[17:20] for whatsoever is more than these cometh
[17:22] of evil you've heard that it has been
[17:25] said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[17:26] tooth but I say unto you that you resist
[17:29] not evil
[17:30] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[17:33] right cheek turn to him the other also
[17:36] and if any man shall Sue thee at the law
[17:38] and take away thy coat let him have thy
[17:41] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[17:44] thee to go of my own goal with him Twain
[17:47] give to him that asketh thee and from
[17:50] him that would borrow of thee turn not
[17:53] thou away
[17:55] that's like I said sometimes the Bible
[17:57] needs to be explained
[18:00] if somebody keeps barring from you that
[18:03] doesn't apply right here okay
[18:06] if somebody want to borrow from you fine
[18:08] but if they don't pay you and they
[18:11] borrow again and bar again you're the
[18:13] loser that's not this Bible telling you
[18:16] to do that
[18:17] it's just telling you a good Christian
[18:19] life because after you go so far you cut
[18:22] it off
[18:22] you know One schmachi on One Cheek turn
[18:25] the other that's right but you don't
[18:26] have to keep turning it backwards and
[18:27] forward back and forth run or do
[18:29] something you know get away and stop the
[18:31] whole thing or whatever you know but
[18:34] think about it because it's it's just
[18:35] telling us
[18:37] you heard it happening say it Thou shalt
[18:39] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[18:41] but I say unto you love your enemies
[18:44] bless them that curse you and do do good
[18:46] to them that hate you and pray for him
[18:48] which despitefully use you and persecute
[18:51] you
[18:52] and she may be the children see these
[18:54] are the things that you may be the
[18:56] children of your father which is in
[18:57] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[19:01] the evil and on the good instead of
[19:03] Reign on the just and the unjust or if
[19:05] you love them which love you what reward
[19:07] have you do not even the publicans the
[19:10] same and if you salute your brethren
[19:12] only what do you more than others do not
[19:15] even the public and so
[19:18] then what does he sum it up with
[19:21] talking about a great life right
[19:25] what to do then he says be therefore
[19:27] perfect even as your father which is in
[19:30] heaven is perfect now go over to
[19:34] second Corinthians 5 just reverse
[19:37] 17.
[19:40] therefore If any man be in Christ
[19:44] he is a new creature that word is
[19:46] creation right right he is a new
[19:49] creature old things are passed away
[19:51] behold all things are become new I mean
[19:56] if you see that the Lord had his
[19:58] Blessing to the reading of the word
[20:01] now we have been as I said a moment ago
[20:05] there for quite a while now I'm speaking
[20:07] on the things of what we believe about
[20:10] this and the Lord willingness laying on
[20:13] my heart I may start a series after this
[20:17] I'm not sure now but I may try to uh
[20:21] take a thought or for a while and just
[20:24] express some of the doctrines of the
[20:26] message
[20:27] and what do people believe
[20:29] and why I don't believe some of the
[20:33] things that the people believe and when
[20:35] I believe what I believe because we have
[20:38] new ones Among Us and also the internet
[20:40] system has opened up now going out to
[20:43] others around the world and you know so
[20:47] we we I may do that now I'm not certain
[20:50] I've got a couple of talks on my mind
[20:52] and you just pray which one will come
[20:55] forth because I don't never know I just
[20:58] wait and then I'll get until they start
[21:01] thinking on something and I get enough
[21:03] notes written for three or four months
[21:04] and then I finally start preaching on it
[21:06] but the brother made a good point the
[21:09] other night I don't know whether that
[21:11] was his exact comment that he meant but
[21:14] he made a good point there's a lot of
[21:16] things in the Bible
[21:18] that are just plain language
[21:20] when it says do this don't do this do
[21:23] that don't do that whatever that's plain
[21:26] language I've heard sermon on don't tear
[21:30] down the neighbors Pastor fence making
[21:32] the old days there with a lot of
[21:34] legalism going around and I've heard
[21:36] sermons on those things and you know
[21:38] well I didn't have to worry about it
[21:41] because when we was raised up if we tore
[21:44] down the neighbor's fence we'd put it
[21:45] back up and put his cows up got a
[21:47] whipping
[21:50] we got all of it so I didn't have to be
[21:53] told not to tear down the neighbors
[21:55] Pastor Finch
[21:56] I knew better to do that right because I
[21:59] didn't want to get a whipping you know
[22:01] the way we were if if you got a weapon
[22:05] at school and went home and told Mom and
[22:06] Daddy you just got another one
[22:07] automatically yeah it wasn't whether or
[22:10] not they you took they didn't ask you
[22:12] whose side you was on or try to join it
[22:15] when the only time I ever seen my mother
[22:17] upset is they whipped my brother one day
[22:19] for something and she wasn't upset with
[22:22] them about whipping what he done he was
[22:24] just upset for the fact that he had
[22:26] risings all over his bottom and a few of
[22:29] them got busted by the teacher but that
[22:32] was the only time I've ever seen her
[22:33] because other than that it was just the
[22:34] fact that you got a whooping there you
[22:36] get one at home right so we didn't have
[22:38] to handle that so there's a lot of
[22:40] things in the Bible
[22:42] there's a letter away there's a lot of
[22:44] sermons that you'll listen to brother
[22:45] Branham on uh
[22:48] like hear ye him
[22:50] that he will not necessarily be talking
[22:52] about adoption right he would just be
[22:56] talking about hearing the Lord
[22:58] he won't even relate it to adoption so
[23:01] there's a lot of things in the Bible and
[23:03] I've been thinking on that for quite a
[23:04] while now I'm just nice let it run and
[23:07] you know getting caught wheels and they
[23:09] work around every once in a while and
[23:11] come out with something but you just
[23:12] pray for me but we'll try to do that all
[23:15] right now the last message we just took
[23:19] last Wednesday night we just took a
[23:21] thought and we had to cut off because
[23:24] I get too much information to put forth
[23:28] and but we were talking about the
[23:30] message to this age
[23:32] and I want to make sure and back up on
[23:34] that a little and then move on with our
[23:37] thought
[23:38] now
[23:40] the message to this age
[23:44] is the complete full Plan of Redemption
[23:47] amen all right you agree amen this is
[23:50] the age when it's to be received total
[23:53] complete plan right all right now down
[23:56] Through the Ages
[24:00] they received a new birth
[24:02] he say he's got the new birth the birth
[24:04] of that age all right and each age would
[24:07] be a part of what Paul said of the new
[24:11] creature right
[24:13] everybody that ever got born again is a
[24:16] part of the body of Jesus Christ right
[24:18] and they're a new creature or a new
[24:21] creation all right now that was
[24:23] understood all the way down
[24:26] but now they didn't understand the
[24:28] fullness they did to a degree in the
[24:30] Disciples of adoption and spoke of it
[24:33] but they didn't know how to bring it to
[24:35] a completion so that would be left for
[24:38] this end time you know for us to
[24:40] understand the the adoptions and the
[24:43] things of this end time part but no one
[24:46] has ever been uh concerned about the
[24:49] change of the body right
[24:51] even though Paul and him spoke of it I'm
[24:54] sure he he thought about it and I don't
[24:56] believe he believed in getting a new
[24:57] body right right I don't believe that
[25:00] I'm against that Doctrine I don't
[25:03] believe that we're going to get anybody
[25:04] I believe it's this body made new
[25:06] Redemption redeem this body right make
[25:10] this body new right all right we'll get
[25:12] to it in a minute you mean you're going
[25:13] to save the soul in Redemption and
[25:15] destroy the body but there's a big
[25:18] following among the Believers of the
[25:20] message that believe that well
[25:25] yeah I believe that when I say at this
[25:27] age gets the complete Plan of Redemption
[25:31] all right
[25:32] and it will for the body
[25:34] it's for the soul the being
[25:37] and it's for the body and even for this
[25:40] world that we're living on that's right
[25:42] right
[25:44] need I'd ask you if you would to read or
[25:47] listen to the message the future home
[25:49] and you'll see what I'm talking about
[25:51] page 15 16. I'm going to do that of the
[25:55] future home all right this is the age to
[25:59] understand the complete plan that's
[26:01] right even we understand what will
[26:05] transpire past our time amen that's
[26:08] right we understand
[26:10] because that was you know God said to
[26:13] Abraham cannot withhold anything from
[26:14] Abraham see he's the heir you know so it
[26:17] was given to him right all right we're
[26:19] the seat of Abraham so we get we know
[26:22] what's going to happen to the Jews after
[26:23] we leave here that's right we know
[26:25] what's going to happen to the foolish
[26:26] virgins we know what that the white
[26:29] Throne is going to be we know all about
[26:31] the Millennium and not all I'm just
[26:34] saying oh we know about the Millennium
[26:35] amen we know about the future home
[26:39] all right which was totally contrary to
[26:43] 99.9 I say of the religious world that's
[26:47] right when the prophet began to speak on
[26:49] those signs
[26:50] because if you were going to believe in
[26:52] in uh you're going to have to get you a
[26:55] new body then where's it coming from
[26:57] right
[26:59] where would it or not where would it
[27:02] come from when we would all agree that
[27:05] uh as far as Sin is concerned upon the
[27:09] Earth and how far it's went
[27:10] that one day it'll be annihilated right
[27:13] not the not the planet not the core of
[27:15] the earth not the the thing but in this
[27:18] change in form right right all right so
[27:20] then if that's true then you would have
[27:22] to go to another planet get your body
[27:24] and come back here maybe because you
[27:26] would probably want to think you're
[27:28] going to be here or whatever so you'd
[27:30] have to go somewhere else and get your
[27:33] body that's just I know I'm carnal but
[27:36] that's just the way I think I'm sorry I
[27:38] didn't say maximum right
[27:40] right all right then
[27:43] if I can think natural and it turn down
[27:45] your spiritual
[27:47] I'm sorry you know I don't mean to I
[27:50] just mean to be truthful and just talk
[27:53] the way I am Amen in that way you don't
[27:55] have to say well I wonder why brother
[27:56] Dale believes on this just ask me that's
[27:58] right and if you'll hang around for just
[28:01] a little while you won't have to worry
[28:02] about your deal with no water blood all
[28:04] right
[28:05] what do you understand what I'm talking
[28:06] about see each age gotten a new birth
[28:10] and they would be a new creature in
[28:13] Christ Jesus that Paul spoke of Amen but
[28:16] not knowing the complete Plan of
[28:17] Redemption which would take the seals to
[28:20] break the things of the prophet's
[28:21] message
[28:23] so you bring out those to this age all
[28:26] right then we could see that the body
[28:29] this body that we're living in
[28:33] to redeem it would mean that it would
[28:35] come to a place of a new creation amen
[28:38] if your soul is a new creature our new
[28:40] creation in Christ Jesus then the body
[28:43] would be a new creation but it wouldn't
[28:46] be another creation amen see that's the
[28:49] difference
[28:50] the word you can be used if you
[28:53] understand how to use it amen if not it
[28:56] will mean something different right
[28:58] yeah you say new well a new new bottle
[29:04] I mean it never existed before
[29:07] well let's see in the scriptural
[29:10] terminology
[29:12] the word new can be where it can be made
[29:15] Eternal amen right right so he makes up
[29:18] eternal
[29:19] you truly got it redeemed right all
[29:22] right and if the soul is returned
[29:24] Eternal right by the new birth then
[29:27] truly more to understand it is redeemed
[29:30] amen amen all right
[29:32] because it can't go back any further
[29:36] than being Eternal right
[29:38] because that would be as far as you can
[29:40] go you know
[29:42] that's what I've always said how far do
[29:43] you want to be redeemed back to
[29:51] this body one day will be a new creation
[29:55] that's right
[29:57] because it'll be made eternal all right
[30:00] that's simple right
[30:02] um
[30:04] the end of world one day we'll get a
[30:06] fiery baptism
[30:09] right right to cleanse off all things as
[30:12] we're reading just a minute
[30:14] and then it can be made eternal
[30:17] so brother they'll always just thought
[30:19] we'd come back to a natural world huh I
[30:22] don't agree I'm dishonest
[30:24] I believe the world we're coming back to
[30:26] is going to be a brand new
[30:28] right but not a different one right amen
[30:31] we'll read in a second as far as Sin
[30:33] goes like I told you the other day as
[30:37] far as as an adult right a bit drill
[30:40] down through the Earth that was sin
[30:42] right and that school got to be claimed
[30:44] that far amen and as far as these
[30:47] Rockets go out that way
[30:49] it's got to be cleansed because it
[30:52] polluted the system
[30:55] see then but it won't annihilate that's
[30:57] right right because your soul is not
[30:59] annihilated that's right right amen
[31:01] hey I know what running around say yes
[31:03] and I know where there's some of the
[31:05] doctrines that we'll get to people
[31:07] talking about a New Soul
[31:10] all right
[31:11] we'll see
[31:13] is it this soul mate new right
[31:17] to give you another a new spirit is not
[31:19] to take your spirit out
[31:21] rip it out of you and put another Spirit
[31:24] In You
[31:26] it's just to take away the nature of
[31:28] this thing
[31:29] amen see to convert it right Redemption
[31:34] I don't I don't understand
[31:36] because then if you believe that the
[31:38] world can be made Eternal what would you
[31:40] have any trouble about your body be man
[31:42] he tried it man do you believe your body
[31:44] would be made Eternal why would you
[31:45] worry about your soul being Eternal now
[31:48] let's go the other way if you believe
[31:49] your soul is eternal why would you worry
[31:51] about your body you think God ain't able
[31:54] you think he ain't able to make this
[31:56] body eternal
[31:58] he cleansed and claimed it right that's
[32:01] right when he gave you the new birth
[32:05] brother Robin said it same as the Lord
[32:07] Jesus on the River Jordan
[32:09] yep when he said this is my part of the
[32:12] earth that I redeemed and from this I
[32:14] will redeem the rest of it amen
[32:16] that's right you get that new bird
[32:19] got laid claim on that body that's why
[32:22] you're not going to get another one amen
[32:23] that's right it's going to be this body
[32:25] made eternity wouldn't that be wonderful
[32:28] amen
[32:31] I'm sure glad it won't be no 71 year old
[32:35] Eternal that won't work
[32:39] but now just get down to the point
[32:43] if you don't get nothing out of the
[32:44] message tonight get the one thing
[32:48] I tried to explain it Wednesday
[32:52] if you get if you talk about a new
[32:54] creation
[32:59] then
[33:00] and we know that it's not Annihilation
[33:03] or something that's right
[33:05] when it's taking what you've got right
[33:08] and placing eternal life within you
[33:12] because that's what God has done right
[33:14] by the new murder
[33:16] all right
[33:17] see then he redeems his soul
[33:19] all right then you're a new creature in
[33:22] Soul
[33:23] amen
[33:24] our body in the world and all these
[33:27] other things it's still out here of this
[33:28] old order amen of life
[33:31] with that New Birth by the prophet would
[33:33] say the most important thing in your
[33:36] life is the new birth amen yes sir
[33:39] because you're not mourned again
[33:43] it's not even going not talking to you
[33:46] right
[33:47] you're not even talking about you in the
[33:49] Bible other than he's going to
[33:50] annihilate you right
[33:52] you know there's a lot of people and I'm
[33:54] not against people I love people you
[33:56] know that I want everybody to be saved
[33:58] because the Lord Jesus wanted everybody
[33:59] to say it
[34:00] but he knew it wouldn't work but that's
[34:02] I know it won't either but I wish
[34:04] everybody could receive the message or
[34:06] the hour in its Purity in truth that's
[34:08] right
[34:09] all seven billion people in the world
[34:11] could receive eternal life today if they
[34:14] would just get rid of themselves and do
[34:17] what I tried to explain
[34:19] what is the qualifications
[34:23] of being born again
[34:27] we said well it's just kids I've been
[34:28] baptism logo okay that's fine
[34:31] but let's break it down simple and
[34:33] without this simple-minded I got a ninth
[34:36] grade education so I don't mind saying
[34:38] that
[34:39] just be simple in your thinking
[34:43] the qualifications for being born again
[34:45] is for you and I to die right
[34:49] is that simple enough
[34:51] right right
[34:53] for us to die that he might live right
[34:56] there simple terminology
[34:59] simple revelation
[35:02] to just believe what God has said
[35:06] he gave us the new birth
[35:08] Paul said makes you a new creature amen
[35:12] all right
[35:14] now if he makes you a new Creator a new
[35:16] creature or creation
[35:19] did it meant and listen this is my point
[35:22] of trying to get over Wednesday it meant
[35:24] you wasn't that right
[35:32] because if he was a new creation then
[35:35] what would you be making a new creation
[35:38] out of a new creation
[35:39] right man we were of the old creation by
[35:43] sin right
[35:44] right Body Spirit Soul perversion of the
[35:47] world everything
[35:48] because of sin
[35:51] all right
[35:53] now if we become a new creature
[35:56] becoming a child of God
[36:01] no wonder brother Bradham would say I'm
[36:03] not the son of Charles and hella Brown
[36:06] he wasn't denying his mother and daddy
[36:11] he was telling you why do you come to
[36:13] the place to realize
[36:16] a new creature
[36:18] means we're not of this world
[36:20] right
[36:21] is that what the Lord Jesus said to you
[36:23] say I'm not of this world and he said
[36:25] you're not of this world right
[36:28] if you're born again you're not in this
[36:30] world right amen
[36:33] all right that's why I told everybody I
[36:35] believe it and you saved my life and
[36:37] whatever pretty much okay it makes good
[36:39] point sometimes
[36:40] I believe ever born again believer
[36:44] is the Genesis 1 26-27 person amen where
[36:48] he said let us make man in our own image
[36:49] and our lives and etc etc amen because
[36:52] that's eternal life right right amen
[36:55] and ever born again believer
[36:58] spiritually speaking
[37:01] has the same DNA right amen did you
[37:04] understand what I said spiritually
[37:05] speaking right amen we are the same
[37:07] spiritually speak in DNA
[37:09] amen well because we're the children of
[37:11] God right we're his offspring yeah amen
[37:16] amen
[37:19] I don't need a great big light bulb to
[37:21] turn on dude no it needs a new birth
[37:25] needs a new bird to be able to believe
[37:27] that God would do that for you tonight
[37:30] see then this is a a total different
[37:33] creation
[37:35] we'll get to it the minute agree if we
[37:36] don't I'm preaching y'all can read the
[37:38] notes layer
[37:42] a brand new
[37:43] creation amen
[37:47] Jesus was the beginning of that creation
[37:49] that's right that's right
[37:53] see from Adam down because president
[37:56] said that I've had eternal life so I
[37:58] believe that well he was the first
[38:01] but everybody from then on didn't have
[38:03] no eternal life right
[38:05] in Jesus Christ came
[38:08] not having eternal life not receiving
[38:12] eternal life but was eternalized yes sir
[38:16] amen because he was almighty God Amen
[38:18] that's right
[38:20] see then he was the product of eternal
[38:22] life amen
[38:25] a brand new race
[38:29] we talk about a Superman we talk about
[38:31] all kind of things your kids see it you
[38:33] know the these superheroes and where
[38:36] they're coming from other planets like
[38:37] Superman did you don't know
[38:41] which the young God came down to live
[38:43] that we that he could give his life amen
[38:47] that you and I could live
[38:49] that we could be you creatures right
[38:53] that's why we're different
[38:55] that's why we live in a world different
[38:57] when we act different
[38:59] we dress different we we obey different
[39:01] we behave different
[39:03] well because we're not of this world
[39:05] right
[39:07] we're a new creature
[39:10] man and a new creature means exactly
[39:12] what it is
[39:14] something that never existed before
[39:20] he said well he was all about
[39:22] yes remember you had to get down here
[39:25] too and we've got we got down here we
[39:28] was lost right right that's the best way
[39:30] to say it right right
[39:32] now when we receive eternal life that
[39:34] makes the connection back to Eternity
[39:37] that's right amen
[39:39] but we must receive it here
[39:41] if not why did Jesus Christ have to die
[39:44] amen why did he just come into the world
[39:46] and say hey all you my children come on
[39:48] we're going up
[39:51] now he came to his only his own receipt
[39:53] and not but as many as he can get any
[39:55] part of becoming something amen amen is
[39:57] that what the Bible says right all right
[39:59] all right now
[40:01] Within
[40:03] let's deal with something for a minute
[40:06] let's think about this thing seriously
[40:11] about how that when you receive that new
[40:14] birth you didn't physically die
[40:16] right
[40:21] right
[40:22] when Ezekiel said I give you a new heart
[40:25] a new spirit
[40:27] I'm glad we had a prophet to explain
[40:29] those times because we were all confused
[40:31] about what it was that's right
[40:34] but he said now that new spirit he said
[40:36] that's not the Holy Spirit right he said
[40:38] that God just took your spirit and
[40:40] changed it in a way that you could get
[40:42] along with somebody else and get along
[40:44] God all right
[40:46] they said that's not the new birth right
[40:48] and he said when I put my spirit in you
[40:51] he said there's your new birth right
[40:53] amen all right that's why you didn't
[40:55] have anybody in the Old Testament of
[40:57] this creation that I'm talking about
[40:59] right amen
[41:01] Adam was only prefigure right
[41:05] Adam was by impartation
[41:08] simply putting it down giving it you've
[41:11] never done anything to receive
[41:13] right the foolish virgins the Jews that
[41:15] receive eternal life that's an
[41:17] impartation one day
[41:20] they don't do anything here and receive
[41:22] it or maybe they may be good to somebody
[41:24] or something like that of a foolish
[41:26] virgin nature but still
[41:29] it's by an impartation God just gives it
[41:32] to him
[41:33] was the other person that has a new
[41:35] birth has to go through the basis of
[41:38] dying to their self right
[41:40] accepting Jesus Christ as their savior
[41:44] all right
[41:47] believing that he has accepted them
[41:51] because we can accept him
[41:54] but if he don't accept us right
[41:57] you see he knows whether we're sincere
[41:58] that's what I was trying to explain last
[42:00] week
[42:04] do you take this Bible
[42:07] he says you believe in your heart
[42:09] confess with your mouth God will save
[42:12] you
[42:13] that's Bible amen but act on a lot of
[42:17] people believe in their heart
[42:19] accepted and speak with them out and
[42:22] wind up not being saved right right
[42:26] right
[42:27] I'm sure not everybody except Lord Lord
[42:30] right
[42:35] so then there's something wrong in the
[42:37] receiving part right
[42:40] the ability to be able to believe
[42:43] amen if if I can't believe
[42:48] that Jesus Christ took my place then how
[42:50] can he take my place
[42:53] right
[42:54] if I can't believe he died for me then
[42:57] how can you know when he died for
[42:59] everybody well that's just a blanket
[43:01] that's throw it out there let everybody
[43:02] have it you know right no
[43:05] you don't get saved that away that's
[43:07] right you don't get saved believe that
[43:09] everybody will be saved all right
[43:11] you get saved by believing that Jesus
[43:13] Christ died for you right man you accept
[43:15] what he said
[43:17] and then he accepts you right
[43:20] all right so that's where the Prophet
[43:22] said
[43:24] he says not whether you accept him or
[43:25] not it's whether he accepts you that's
[43:27] right but now if you don't accept him he
[43:29] can't accept you so now he's not doing
[43:31] away with you accepting him right
[43:34] you hear him say that that fasting and
[43:37] praying Etc doing this
[43:39] didn't save you okay that's right that's
[43:42] perfect well show me one time he ever
[43:44] said it's wrong to fast and pray right
[43:48] because he told you what that done
[43:51] fasting and praying get yourself out of
[43:54] the way
[43:58] you're fasted you get yourself out of
[44:01] the way that's right
[44:03] the prophet of God said if you feel led
[44:05] to Feist you won't get hungry right
[44:07] right that's right man I went on a mini
[44:10] face and starved to death I'm honest
[44:13] I'm not making a joke just tell me like
[44:15] it is
[44:16] one time the Lord burdened me about
[44:18] something I put on the fast
[44:21] and I went for three straight days doing
[44:23] nothing but drinking liquids of anymore
[44:27] at the end of that three days I had my
[44:29] answer he gave it to me
[44:33] I had to go back to eating because I was
[44:35] not hungry right right I didn't want to
[44:37] not to eat
[44:39] but at other times I went on to myself
[44:41] and I sure starved to death and suffered
[44:44] through two or three days and you know
[44:46] finally get back to eating
[44:48] I'm dishonest all right see if everybody
[44:51] be honest it would be a whole lot better
[44:52] world
[44:53] you know like you see these fillers you
[44:55] know they say oh they've been on The
[44:56] 40-day Fast and you see them and what
[44:58] they've done is they bought about 10 to
[45:01] salvages you know they're they're maybe
[45:03] a a 38 like I am down here and out here
[45:06] for a little more but you know
[45:09] and they're 38 and you see them and they
[45:11] buy about a 50 size pair of pants you
[45:13] know and they pull the belt around you
[45:15] know
[45:16] boy look look at him man look at him he
[45:19] just feel like it's done he's been
[45:21] fasting for 40 days there ain't no such
[45:23] thing in the Bible the prophet said
[45:25] right the Lord Jesus was the only person
[45:27] ever fasted 40 days brother Brown and
[45:29] said you want to quote he said I've
[45:30] never fasted over three days in my life
[45:33] I've been a been challenged on that and
[45:36] I've got it where he said it so don't
[45:38] worry about it
[45:39] because a lot of people think that he
[45:42] did he would eat one meal a day
[45:44] how about time do you go did he get
[45:46] ready for a meeting he fast for two or
[45:47] three days
[45:49] but uh okay here we go but listen
[45:54] everybody is a new creature that's born
[45:57] again
[46:01] because that's what started on the dip
[46:03] income
[46:05] it was a different
[46:07] entirely different breed
[46:11] amen a breed of people started on the
[46:13] net Pentecost that had never existed in
[46:16] the world right of all of The Davids and
[46:19] the the Sauls and the Solomons and the
[46:22] great things that happened in the the
[46:24] you know killing the bird and killing
[46:27] the lines and all of that right
[46:29] I was done by people
[46:32] that were not of this new race because
[46:34] Jesus was the first of that race amen
[46:38] that's why I called him in Revelations 3
[46:41] 14 then the beginning of the creation of
[46:43] God that's right amen all right and see
[46:46] being that then he started a new race
[46:50] a super race of people
[46:53] we're in the days of superstars super
[46:55] this super that
[46:57] and they're there that people can run
[47:01] day in and day out
[47:03] just run
[47:04] just day in and day out
[47:08] and then fall in the water and swim for
[47:10] 10 miles
[47:13] did you super
[47:15] it's because they framed their bodies
[47:17] and their minds
[47:19] but that's not the new race that I'm
[47:20] moving to be a part of Amen I saw well
[47:23] and good but you know
[47:27] it's not that kind of a race of people
[47:28] amen right right it's a race of people
[47:31] that God spoke of all the way through
[47:33] man
[47:35] and I know my friend won't get there
[47:36] today but I'll get to it Sunday
[47:38] but that's why David when David was
[47:41] saying blessed is the man to whom God
[47:43] will not impute sin he wasn't talking
[47:45] about himself
[47:48] do you thinking watch you think he was
[47:51] just saying like hey bless you I tell
[47:52] you what God thanks so much of me he
[47:55] didn't kill me when I let my clear
[47:56] adultery I done all these things he
[47:58] didn't kill me cause he loved me
[48:01] now you got a thought like that you're
[48:03] you're right in the middle of the
[48:04] devil's trap
[48:06] in a garbage can right man right
[48:11] see David was speaking of you and I am
[48:13] that's right
[48:16] he was speaking of this new race of
[48:17] people
[48:19] that's what I've tried to get across to
[48:20] you about the point of being perfect
[48:23] the only way to be perfect is let him
[48:25] live in you and I we're not perfect in
[48:27] ourselves right but in Jesus Christ we
[48:29] are perfect
[48:30] right amen mom because you can't charge
[48:34] god with sin
[48:35] that's all right amen
[48:38] but I I tried to explain it go to that
[48:41] let's get this we don't get an
[48:42] announcement go to Psalms 30 32.
[48:46] where David says this
[48:48] see David was speaking of you and I am
[48:57] God Must Love Me
[49:01] what do you think he was saying
[49:04] we would just read the Bible and see
[49:06] what he was saying
[49:07] that's what I like to do that's why I
[49:09] said I just like to read it and see what
[49:10] it says and I believe it
[49:13] did in that way I didn't give him this
[49:15] what's wrong it won't be on the screen
[49:17] if they can grab it up quick enough I
[49:19] don't know Psalms 32.
[49:22] they were doing good the other night so
[49:23] they'll have it up before I get to a
[49:24] reason
[49:27] I really like that about the helicopter
[49:29] call
[49:31] you can write down our language
[49:34] most of you never know nothing about how
[49:36] they called you know and it is hey man I
[49:39] was in the days I had a call and so I
[49:41] told them later about it the Miss man
[49:43] this comedian came up with a joke about
[49:45] it if we found out later about it but
[49:47] see the reason they called it attic all
[49:49] they had to call it something I mean
[49:51] that was their day that was the thought
[49:52] of our day they had to call it something
[49:54] because they called it had it all 12 off
[49:56] y'all
[49:57] yeah
[49:58] same thing as a beer
[50:00] and it was disappointed
[50:04] didn't believe in the handicapped out
[50:06] for religions
[50:08] all right but listen
[50:11] blessed is he whose transgressions Is
[50:14] Forgiven and sin is covered
[50:16] match it is a man
[50:18] unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity
[50:21] and whose Spirit there is no God
[50:24] all right now that looks like to take it
[50:27] in our own thoughts
[50:30] make sure you leave it up over 1 verse
[50:32] five in a minute
[50:35] that
[50:38] it looks like David is just saying I get
[50:40] about anything
[50:41] and like he's saying that there's
[50:42] somebody in the world is good enough God
[50:44] thinks enough of him he ain't going to
[50:46] impute sin
[50:49] that's why I've tried my best to preach
[50:51] it to you the only person that God won't
[50:53] impute sin to is a dead man right amen
[50:56] you can't accuse my dad you're sinning
[50:58] or doing something wrong he's been dead
[51:00] 45 years or more
[51:02] um we want that
[51:05] he died in 45 so you calculate but
[51:11] if you're born again
[51:15] and the only way you'll be born again is
[51:17] for you to die
[51:20] we are the only religion in the world
[51:24] that our leader had to die
[51:26] there's no other religion in the world
[51:28] like that right
[51:29] name one name any religion
[51:33] where the leader had to die
[51:35] oh we talked about all he wrote the
[51:37] books he'd done this I don't know but
[51:38] our leader had to die right to give us
[51:41] eternal life
[51:42] and you don't want to be part of this
[51:44] body of Christ we have to die amen
[51:47] to ourselves and be warned again
[51:52] to the only man that God wanted to send
[51:54] to is a dead man right
[51:56] right I don't mean physically dead
[51:59] I mean a man that has spiritually died
[52:02] to himself right that's right well
[52:04] that's what David was speaking of right
[52:06] all right because like I told you here's
[52:07] David saying blessed is he is all that
[52:09] and he's over there dealing with
[52:13] who is it Nathan
[52:15] the prophet right and if it had not been
[52:18] for the prophet of God David would have
[52:21] died because he called his own
[52:22] condemnation when Nathan gave the story
[52:25] about the the one and not having one
[52:28] lamb and all of a sudden the other and
[52:29] David said bring the man here I'll kill
[52:31] him
[52:33] David you're the man
[52:36] finished his own death sentence
[52:40] the night and said
[52:42] in that damage you won't die that's
[52:45] right I pray for you
[52:47] amen thank you Lord amen God has told me
[52:50] to come and tell you right you won't die
[52:52] but the baby will
[52:55] look like his sins was counted to him
[52:58] doesn't it
[53:00] yep sure
[53:02] you see I didn't even know the rest of
[53:04] them
[53:05] scripture pull it back up now brother
[53:08] let's read the whole thing
[53:14] bless you this he whose transgressions
[53:17] Is Forgiven who sin is covered
[53:20] see it actually said doesn't even say
[53:22] that
[53:23] Paul comes on later and picks up you
[53:25] know about the sin right unless it is a
[53:28] man of tune to the Lord if youth not
[53:29] iniquity and whose Spirit never has
[53:31] known God
[53:36] wrote it up now we're going to read
[53:37] verse 5.
[53:39] I acknowledge my sin unto thee
[53:44] much
[53:46] and my iniquity have I'm not hid
[53:51] I said I will confess my transgressions
[53:54] unto the Lord
[53:56] and thou forgave us
[53:58] the iniquity of my sins
[54:04] David wouldn't say it blessed am I that
[54:07] God wanted pukes into me he tells you
[54:09] exactly what he done
[54:13] he acknowledged his sin
[54:16] amen
[54:18] he confessed his sin
[54:22] if I didn't hide my iniquity
[54:24] I tried to but when it got exposed I
[54:27] admitted it
[54:30] and the Bible says back in the Old
[54:32] Testament what if a man of an honest and
[54:34] a contrite heart that God looks too
[54:37] amen oh David was this special in the
[54:39] message they got it there's this special
[54:41] seed their special doing
[54:44] I would like for you to explain
[54:46] something to me
[54:50] you believe in Abraham
[54:53] you believe that Abraham and his seed
[54:55] after him and that we are the seat of
[54:57] Abraham by faith you agree sure
[54:59] amen
[55:01] you know that Abraham received an
[55:03] unconditional Covenant
[55:09] is that true right
[55:12] he said Abraham I've already done it
[55:16] salvations of the Lord Jonah 2 and 9.
[55:21] but show me where Abraham got by what he
[55:23] was doing
[55:24] right
[55:27] show me where David got by what he was
[55:29] doing
[55:30] no he was praying constantly to get rid
[55:32] of all of those things right
[55:34] right bring it out show me in the seat
[55:36] of Abraham whether you've got a right to
[55:38] just live like the devil and say you're
[55:40] saved anyway that ain't even Baptist
[55:42] Doctrine they didn't even believe that
[55:43] far off yeah right you hear it the
[55:46] people of this message they don't matter
[55:48] what I do I was a seed
[55:52] we'll get to that Sunday
[55:54] God wanted sin to that seed right that's
[55:57] right because he ain't for one seed and
[56:00] that's the word of God Amen
[56:02] and you want these others before Sunday
[56:06] the seed of God is the baptism of the
[56:08] Holy Ghost amen that's right Max press
[56:12] that one a little right
[56:13] you say it's just a seat and all the ram
[56:15] said it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:17] is the seed of God Amen
[56:20] so what are we trying to be but you see
[56:23] what David is saying
[56:29] I wrote in my Bible where I wouldn't
[56:30] forget it
[56:32] if David wasn't thinking about when he
[56:35] was just saying this up here in Prophecy
[56:37] by the Holy Spirit if he wasn't thinking
[56:39] about the life that he lived
[56:41] why would he acknowledge his sin
[56:45] but then he said bless God I'm one of
[56:47] them up there are two verses above I
[56:49] don't have to worry about it because I
[56:50] got it made now that's worse than the
[56:53] Baptist we didn't even believe that in
[56:54] the Baptist Church we at least believe
[56:55] in repent
[57:00] I just didn't believe it sin far enough
[57:02] when he died
[57:04] you know you're still going to heaven
[57:06] because you painted the parking lot
[57:08] I'm not joking
[57:11] put it in new pews your name's on the
[57:12] end of the few well they got to be in
[57:13] heaven like brother Stephen Wilson said
[57:15] ain't nobody going to hell no more
[57:17] they're gonna have to do away with it
[57:18] yeah
[57:19] why because everybody is a Christian all
[57:21] right of what
[57:24] let's get down to something well I've
[57:26] done wasted my time
[57:28] listen but listen and I wrote down
[57:31] please listen to the Future home
[57:38] got the title down yet
[57:41] is not the future home
[57:43] it's the future home of the Heavenly
[57:46] bridegroom
[57:47] and the Earthly Brown
[57:53] now that's the title of the message amen
[57:57] we are the Earthly bride amen right come
[58:01] on let's get into it let's read what the
[58:04] prophet did and let's say there's a
[58:05] little bit and then we'll quick all
[58:06] right I'll get this Sunday just going
[58:08] with it
[58:11] go ahead and pull up number one on
[58:12] another Sprint
[58:15] because what I want you to see is that
[58:18] we are not
[58:20] annihilated when we receive the new
[58:23] birth
[58:25] we're born again right
[58:27] my old nature yes
[58:31] my old ways yes annihilated
[58:36] but he put eternal life into my soul he
[58:39] didn't destroy my soul
[58:41] he gave eternal life to me
[58:45] all right and then deciding for the
[58:47] world and sign for her body so that's
[58:49] just what we're reading so listen
[58:53] thank you
[58:55] join the whole world frame did not
[58:58] destroy
[58:59] By the Waters when it was washed off you
[59:02] know the Bible says that the world was
[59:03] destroyed in the days of Noah by the way
[59:06] right yeah
[59:08] right but how is it destroyed
[59:12] was it totally annihilated I was just
[59:15] washed off
[59:17] which one was it who just washed off
[59:19] right
[59:20] that's why you got alligator fossils up
[59:23] here in in Indiana
[59:26] full grown alligator fossils up in
[59:28] Indiana
[59:30] because that's where they were living at
[59:32] and then this thing went through a chaos
[59:34] and it just washed and it just settled
[59:36] in his washing it settled and just just
[59:38] moved everything everywhere right man
[59:41] all right but listen
[59:44] By the Waters when it was washed off the
[59:45] frame of the planet the old frame
[59:48] the all the dirt all the stuff that God
[59:50] put on the Earth was not destroyed when
[59:52] the first world was destroyed and the
[59:54] Bible said it was to start so
[59:57] but it never destroyed the frame it just
[59:59] destroyed the sin and sinners that was
[1:00:02] on it the framework remained that's
[1:00:06] right but the next one
[1:00:09] that was paragraph 160 in the future
[1:00:11] home this is paragraph 164.
[1:00:15] I saw the old world frame work was not
[1:00:18] destroyed by the water
[1:00:20] the world was only washed off that got
[1:00:22] its baptism it was baptized right so
[1:00:25] will the framework remain though it be
[1:00:27] burnt by fire
[1:00:28] it don't destroy the Earth see it just
[1:00:31] destroys the sin that's only
[1:00:35] you know that's that's word that you've
[1:00:38] got to take the Bible of what it says
[1:00:42] but yet you take it to him I tell you
[1:00:44] what I don't care what anybody says my
[1:00:46] Bible said the world was destroyed
[1:00:50] and the days of Noah
[1:00:56] uh what planet did we come off of right
[1:01:00] you know
[1:01:02] did Noah and his sons and their families
[1:01:06] did they take a spaceship and run up to
[1:01:08] Mars or Venus or somewhere and land on
[1:01:10] another planet and started off a new
[1:01:12] world or whatever
[1:01:15] read the Bible we need an understanding
[1:01:18] amen right
[1:01:20] the sin was destroyed the world world
[1:01:24] means Cosmos the Greek word therefore
[1:01:28] Hebrew right
[1:01:30] it's Cosmos which means World Order
[1:01:33] it's like we say you know we're talking
[1:01:35] we say well you know well oh
[1:01:38] man come up here
[1:01:42] you want everybody in the building you
[1:01:43] don't walk up here right now if I said
[1:01:45] all men maybe it would change the
[1:01:47] situation right but see mankind
[1:01:53] all right
[1:01:55] it's just we've got to do it and thank
[1:01:58] God for somebody that was a seventh
[1:02:00] grade education man that God could speak
[1:02:03] to
[1:02:04] am I now listen let the theologians
[1:02:06] couldn't understand it
[1:02:09] and he'd have to even spell the word
[1:02:11] because he couldn't pronounce it right
[1:02:15] right yep
[1:02:16] they ain't doing anything more
[1:02:18] theologians sitting out there
[1:02:20] and him saying something he's doing
[1:02:23] look at that little idiot who do you
[1:02:26] think he is if you manage success
[1:02:30] now that word there is the same word for
[1:02:33] pass away
[1:02:36] did you theologians know that word
[1:02:41] may pass away
[1:02:46] you see what I'm getting at
[1:02:48] the education that's the Holy Ghost
[1:02:51] right all right let's go a little
[1:02:53] further paragraph 166.
[1:02:57] notice here some of you Bible students
[1:03:00] and especially Dr Dale
[1:03:06] oh me I don't think it was me yeah
[1:03:09] because I wasn't there okay
[1:03:12] I think that's Dr Bale yeah they should
[1:03:15] have put bail there but they put down
[1:03:16] that would they got a good life on that
[1:03:19] the other day when I lost her and I
[1:03:21] remembered it years ago that I've seen
[1:03:22] the doctor Dale that was that something
[1:03:27] Dr Vale was a theologian but he was a
[1:03:30] self-trained theologian you know no
[1:03:32] school training
[1:03:33] yourself trying to deal over there all
[1:03:35] right especially Dr Dale looking at me
[1:03:39] notice in Peter in the second chapter of
[1:03:41] Peter
[1:03:42] third chapter of it he uses the word
[1:03:44] world
[1:03:45] as a Greek word Cosmos which means the
[1:03:49] world order
[1:03:50] the Earth shall pass away
[1:03:52] melt the elements with fervent heat
[1:03:54] that's what the Bible says in the Bible
[1:03:56] see it doesn't mean that the Earth the
[1:03:58] planet is going to pass away but the
[1:04:01] world Cosmos I like that one
[1:04:05] everybody like that next word politics
[1:04:08] that's right amen blood suckers amen
[1:04:11] Cosmos for politics the Sinners the
[1:04:14] system they might get me for that in one
[1:04:16] day
[1:04:17] sin disease germ everything that's wrong
[1:04:21] will pass away right and what did I like
[1:04:24] about you you got all these down here
[1:04:25] that's reading our life so you've got
[1:04:27] sin and sickness and germ now and then
[1:04:29] he said politics politics is first
[1:04:31] that's all right right not around know
[1:04:34] how to talk amen all right jump on down
[1:04:37] you read in between and here Peter said
[1:04:39] and we'll melt with fervent Heat and the
[1:04:42] works that are in burnt up not the
[1:04:44] planet The Works that are in the works
[1:04:46] of man all their politicians and their
[1:04:49] schemes and all their denominations in
[1:04:52] man-made schemes
[1:04:54] we'll all go with it when it burns and
[1:04:58] it won't be no presidential election in
[1:05:01] heaven
[1:05:02] we won't have to worry about who's going
[1:05:04] to be in charge that's right
[1:05:07] you see what I'm talking about
[1:05:09] all right going over paragraphs 171.
[1:05:13] this is all in
[1:05:15] continue reading right on down
[1:05:17] in the future home
[1:05:19] you know when a man receives a baptism
[1:05:21] of fire there's a lot of noise around
[1:05:24] there oh man they think that's a shame
[1:05:26] to hear people scream and shout like
[1:05:28] that just wait till this Earth gets your
[1:05:30] baptism
[1:05:35] the H2O
[1:05:37] the water
[1:05:39] for the Bible said here in Revelation
[1:05:41] 21. see H2O is a two-part hydrogen one
[1:05:44] part oxygen that's what water is made
[1:05:46] out of the stuff you drink to stay alive
[1:05:47] is a deadly explosive
[1:05:51] you ever thought of that it's deadly
[1:05:52] because there's two parts hydrogen one
[1:05:54] part oxygen
[1:05:56] if you can some way in the world that's
[1:05:57] why they would afraid when they set the
[1:05:58] first atom bomb off and they split the
[1:06:00] atom they were afraid if they hit that
[1:06:02] correctly and they say if they had it it
[1:06:04] would have blow the whole world up
[1:06:07] see because it's water
[1:06:09] deadly explosion
[1:06:11] Whoever thought about fertilizer being
[1:06:14] an explosion right and the guy took it
[1:06:16] out there and went to Oklahoma somewhere
[1:06:17] and blowed that place up with fertilizer
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:20] you know
[1:06:22] there's a lot of things in the world
[1:06:24] that's that's not her but now listen
[1:06:27] and there was no more sea exploded this
[1:06:30] would change the whole surface of the
[1:06:32] entire Earth she'll burst and blow to
[1:06:33] pieces on the outside the crusted for
[1:06:36] hundreds of feet below it would just
[1:06:38] simply be completely demolished the
[1:06:40] atmospheres the gases that's in the
[1:06:42] earth now
[1:06:44] what
[1:06:45] where they're finding these missiles
[1:06:47] they can't get through it
[1:06:49] a great spear up in there way up in some
[1:06:53] kind of a spirit that there's all kinds
[1:06:55] of gases they say and that'll burst the
[1:06:58] holy wrath of God will come upon that
[1:07:00] sea and will cleanse it we'll change the
[1:07:02] entire surface
[1:07:04] now many of you that want to put down
[1:07:06] this word the Greek word pass away
[1:07:09] it comes from the word I had to find it
[1:07:11] and I thought how is this work how is
[1:07:14] this world going to pass away and yet
[1:07:17] we're going to live on it you get the
[1:07:20] point
[1:07:21] see when I put presses they they darken
[1:07:23] it out in different colors all right
[1:07:25] that was my emphasis
[1:07:27] he was going to pass away how are we
[1:07:28] going to live on it right so where we're
[1:07:30] gonna live it's the passageway we're
[1:07:32] going to Mars Venus Jupiter where we're
[1:07:34] going
[1:07:36] no well John saw that coming down on him
[1:07:40] right here
[1:07:42] but if you'll notice some of you people
[1:07:43] that wants to put it down there I'll
[1:07:45] spell it for you and I can't pronounce
[1:07:46] it so we spelled a big long word I don't
[1:07:49] know how to pronounce it all right and
[1:07:51] she said that and when the inspiration
[1:07:53] strikes he tells you how to get it so
[1:07:54] Heaven and Earth will pass away now this
[1:07:56] word means passing from one form to
[1:07:59] another it does not mean Annihilation as
[1:08:02] the English word would mean pass away
[1:08:04] it's annihilated but the Hebrew word or
[1:08:07] the Greek word here does not mean pass
[1:08:09] away it means from means from passing
[1:08:13] watch it
[1:08:15] means from passing
[1:08:18] from one thing to another right
[1:08:22] look what
[1:08:23] look but to pass from one condition that
[1:08:26] says
[1:08:27] to another amen now I hope you're
[1:08:29] thinking about your soul man
[1:08:32] do not just thinking about a world out
[1:08:33] there but around is explaining
[1:08:34] Redemption he said it on a future home
[1:08:36] by Page 15. he says you don't get
[1:08:39] what I'm talking about on the future
[1:08:41] home he said I hope you get the Plan of
[1:08:44] Redemption
[1:08:46] at least get the Plan of Redemption for
[1:08:49] the soul right your soul wasn't
[1:08:51] annihilated right
[1:08:54] right he just took the devil out
[1:08:56] took out the nature of the uncleanness
[1:08:58] because Jesus said the unclean Spirit
[1:09:00] goeth out of the Lamb walk Us in dry
[1:09:02] places
[1:09:04] that's what's supposed to happen with
[1:09:05] sanctification right
[1:09:09] all right then when it comes forth what
[1:09:11] are we to be a new creature
[1:09:13] I noticed Paul used it if you want to
[1:09:16] read it now put it down you can read it
[1:09:17] later in Titus 3 5 Paul is using this
[1:09:21] same word means regeneration of man that
[1:09:23] man that's passed from a center to a
[1:09:25] saint not completely annihilated
[1:09:29] when a man has changed he isn't
[1:09:31] annihilated but he has changed he but
[1:09:34] he's a changed person
[1:09:36] he has been changed from what he was to
[1:09:39] what he is not annihilated amen the same
[1:09:41] word going through and I don't blow that
[1:09:43] right around and said Jesus used the
[1:09:45] same word when he said go loose the coat
[1:09:48] right remember
[1:09:49] he told him to go get the code word to
[1:09:51] bring it to it they brought the the
[1:09:53] white donkey and he wrote it into
[1:09:55] Jerusalem that same word loose he said
[1:09:58] the same word was used when he told him
[1:10:00] that Lazarus was great Lucy
[1:10:03] it's the same word
[1:10:06] it means changing from one form to
[1:10:08] another form amen amen
[1:10:11] it doesn't mean Annihilation right
[1:10:14] when you get borned again it's not too
[1:10:16] annihilated right amen
[1:10:21] he is just that Soul inside of the Earth
[1:10:24] the nature of it has been changed
[1:10:27] I know that goes into the two Soul
[1:10:29] peoples and all this others but that's
[1:10:31] all right
[1:10:32] the main thing I tried to tell them is
[1:10:34] this plain language they can't even read
[1:10:39] the two Soul people always said the soul
[1:10:41] is just the nature of the spirit show me
[1:10:43] one quote right around him says that
[1:10:46] what do you mean we got paid out of page
[1:10:49] at the page sold to me
[1:10:51] hey you left down at work right
[1:10:54] around and never said the soul is just
[1:10:57] the nature of the spirit he said their
[1:10:58] soul is the nature of this amen there's
[1:11:00] a lot of difference
[1:11:01] try when you say the soul is just the
[1:11:04] nature of the spirit you're making that
[1:11:06] all it can ever be
[1:11:08] good it's just that establishes it to be
[1:11:11] what it is
[1:11:14] that's just a bottle
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:20] but you see take that bottle redo it
[1:11:23] then you take away the word just and it
[1:11:26] can become paper Maybe
[1:11:29] you know wood I'll be back they can go
[1:11:31] back to another form
[1:11:34] but when you say the soul is just the
[1:11:36] nature of the spirit then you're
[1:11:38] misinterpreting right around amen
[1:11:41] the nature he said on on sold in prison
[1:11:45] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:11:47] born again amen
[1:11:49] he said if not it's of the world that's
[1:11:51] right that's right so if you're not born
[1:11:53] again the nature of your soul is in the
[1:11:54] world right but if you are born again
[1:11:56] you're a 19 of your soul it's gone right
[1:11:58] that's right I see eternal life amen
[1:12:00] simple language all right
[1:12:03] but yet though theologians setting their
[1:12:05] life and it run around
[1:12:08] the life of me because I was standing in
[1:12:10] Jeffersonville one day out there
[1:12:13] Parkview school I know it's the old
[1:12:15] Armory
[1:12:17] I'm one of those guys with the two Soul
[1:12:18] guys was
[1:12:20] said something and I said what run
[1:12:21] around said to nature of soul is God if
[1:12:23] if you're born again if not each of the
[1:12:25] world he said how can you nature have a
[1:12:26] nature I said go dig right around him up
[1:12:29] and talk to him I ain't got time for
[1:12:31] food
[1:12:33] that's what I meant I didn't care about
[1:12:35] talking to him because he's contrary to
[1:12:37] brother Brown
[1:12:39] brother Robin said this nature of your
[1:12:41] soul is God if you're born here that's
[1:12:42] right if not you know the world that's
[1:12:45] right
[1:12:46] do I find the new Mercy has to burn out
[1:12:50] that nature
[1:12:51] that's why the Bible called Holy Ghost
[1:12:54] and Fire
[1:12:55] you'll notice that in that I believe
[1:12:57] let's write the book about it Holy Ghost
[1:12:58] and Fire right they don't mean you get
[1:13:01] the Holy Ghost and then you get a
[1:13:02] baptism somewhere else
[1:13:04] probably explain to Future home reading
[1:13:07] he said that fire comes in
[1:13:11] as that Holy Ghost is coming down that
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost is a fire to burn out ever
[1:13:18] desire of the world from that soul
[1:13:22] and leaves eternal life
[1:13:24] right
[1:13:30] burns out all that you desire
[1:13:34] he said well I got born again the next
[1:13:36] day I was having problems that's where
[1:13:38] the trouble is that right
[1:13:40] Nick won't
[1:13:42] let me quote brother Brown
[1:13:44] Boy Billy Paul's life
[1:13:46] another round said she received the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost last night
[1:13:52] you want this one he said she received
[1:13:55] the Holy Ghost last night and said the
[1:13:57] day she's doubting it
[1:14:00] yep sure
[1:14:02] you say you mean you can receive the
[1:14:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Satan can
[1:14:05] try to make you doubt it's not in the
[1:14:07] soul that's right that's right but the
[1:14:10] body and the spirit amen amen when you
[1:14:13] got bored again did it take care of
[1:14:15] everything you ain't never had no more
[1:14:17] truth
[1:14:22] come on
[1:14:24] we're still living in a body in the
[1:14:26] spirit that's in a realm of Satan right
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:30] with his new Creations in the Soul by
[1:14:34] the new birth
[1:14:35] all right never born again believer is a
[1:14:38] new creature
[1:14:45] see them God's living in you all right
[1:14:47] man Paul said it's not I that liveth but
[1:14:50] Christ that liveth in me and the life
[1:14:51] that I now live in the flesh
[1:14:54] and he turned around telling you his
[1:14:55] flesh is not worth nothing
[1:14:57] that's right he turned around and tell
[1:14:59] you he said by the n-word man I serve
[1:15:01] the law of God said by the outward man
[1:15:02] in other words of Flesh he said I serve
[1:15:04] the law that's right don't run around
[1:15:06] and explained that he didn't say that
[1:15:09] Paul was saying it's all right to go out
[1:15:10] and live like the devil and say I can't
[1:15:12] hit me
[1:15:16] you want me to get that one questions
[1:15:18] and answers conduct order and Doctor run
[1:15:21] around and explains it
[1:15:24] Paul was serving the law of the flesh
[1:15:26] how
[1:15:27] about around explained how
[1:15:29] he said I just come in off of the
[1:15:31] meeting and he said I was tired and wore
[1:15:32] out
[1:15:34] in other words he said my body want to
[1:15:36] go to bed
[1:15:39] but he said I heard the church
[1:15:43] and I knew brother Neville would be
[1:15:45] having Church
[1:15:46] yeah
[1:15:47] he said I got up and come
[1:15:52] that's how he explained Conquering the
[1:15:55] law of the flesh
[1:15:57] not that you can't help but sin that's a
[1:16:01] lie the devil's placed into our minds
[1:16:03] and our thinking
[1:16:07] we don't have to do anything
[1:16:09] and I've always told you how many of
[1:16:11] those how many times I've ever made just
[1:16:12] one statement the kid's life about it
[1:16:14] I'll be telling some joke or something
[1:16:15] and around they'll say that's the 16th
[1:16:17] time that he's already told out
[1:16:20] well how many times have I ever told you
[1:16:23] I don't blame the devil for everything
[1:16:25] that's right
[1:16:27] you say the devil made me do it I don't
[1:16:29] agree with that
[1:16:31] we have to volunteer forever
[1:16:35] sure it might be because of the nature
[1:16:37] part of it of the devil yes but he
[1:16:40] didn't make me do everything
[1:16:42] that's right he tried to make me do a
[1:16:43] lot of things
[1:16:45] and he has conquered me in a lot of
[1:16:47] things and got me to do them amen I'm
[1:16:49] human

[1:19:34] you can't
[1:19:36] if you're born again
[1:19:37] you got his thoughts
[1:19:40] it's the mind of Christ is in you then
[1:19:42] you are a new creature
[1:19:44] the Bible teaches that
[1:19:46] any brother would like to work you find
[1:19:50] that creature look that word creature
[1:19:57] find that that creature with that word
[1:20:00] creature up in in the Lexicon and you'll
[1:20:03] find out that the word creature there is
[1:20:05] interpreted or translated into creation
[1:20:08] much because you are a you are one
[1:20:12] creation
[1:20:13] yep
[1:20:15] pay close attention
[1:20:18] because you are one creation
[1:20:22] I'm watching
[1:20:23] a human being
[1:20:26] mourn in sexual desire here on the Earth
[1:20:32] that's exactly who all of us are Amen
[1:20:34] brother Brown and all of us
[1:20:37] yep
[1:20:40] and now you're a new creationist born by
[1:20:44] spirit
[1:20:45] your own thoughts are dead
[1:20:47] they're so dead until they're Crystal
[1:20:49] like the bride serpent
[1:20:52] or like he died when the heavens and the
[1:20:55] Earth and everything witnessed he was
[1:20:57] dead
[1:21:00] the new birth
[1:21:03] what is the new birth man right
[1:21:08] to die out to yourself and accept Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ
[1:21:13] I don't want to hear these great deep
[1:21:14] things there's nothing deeper than that
[1:21:16] all right amen
[1:21:18] you show me anything deeper than a new
[1:21:21] birth
[1:21:24] I preach to see yours I preached 70
[1:21:26] weeks of Daniel I preached marriage and
[1:21:28] divorce I preached all of them but you
[1:21:30] know where I preaching from
[1:21:31] the new word amen
[1:21:36] how many knows this statement of made
[1:21:39] the way I check a Doctrine is by my new
[1:21:42] birth
[1:21:44] that's why I know they can't be two
[1:21:46] Souls
[1:21:49] because they're too sold got to be two
[1:21:51] guards
[1:21:53] that's him
[1:21:57] I mean that's just how simple I think
[1:22:00] you'd have to have two Gods you have too
[1:22:02] small
[1:22:04] see that won't work
[1:22:09] the new birth
[1:22:11] how can you deny God's word
[1:22:14] yep no it doesn't mean we know
[1:22:16] everything
[1:22:17] right never have taught that
[1:22:20] I'm constantly learning learning
[1:22:22] learning learning learning
[1:22:27] and it all comes from my new birth
[1:22:31] the new birth makes me a new creature
[1:22:33] we'll take a right to our Sunday reading
[1:22:34] where the Prophet says 336 of the church
[1:22:37] a book that I read last week
[1:22:39] it's not the old creation made over
[1:22:41] that's right
[1:22:44] when he said that's the revelation of
[1:22:46] one God
[1:22:49] read through 36 Church movies read the
[1:22:51] whole page
[1:22:55] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:22:57] Amen
[1:22:58] he said it's speaking of another
[1:23:00] creation
[1:23:02] having to do with his pride amen
[1:23:07] because she's him made up on Earth
[1:23:10] in a new creation
[1:23:12] but if you don't get nothing from the
[1:23:13] message get one thing
[1:23:17] a new creation means exactly the way it
[1:23:19] means
[1:23:23] it is the story of
[1:23:26] the example of Superman
[1:23:31] which is
[1:23:32] nutritional
[1:23:35] but it gets a good point across
[1:23:38] he came from another world
[1:23:41] had superpowers
[1:23:46] did not our Lord Jesus Christ come from
[1:23:48] another world
[1:23:51] amen did he not have superpower right
[1:23:56] they could not touch him he could just
[1:23:57] walk out the moon they were fixing to
[1:23:59] throw him over a cliff one day
[1:24:01] and somehow right
[1:24:03] he just walked down yeah
[1:24:07] they couldn't do anything with him until
[1:24:10] that anointing left him in the garden to
[1:24:11] Gethsemane they couldn't do nothing with
[1:24:13] him
[1:24:15] they never killed him don't ever put it
[1:24:18] another Jew killed my savior
[1:24:20] don't ever put it in a Roman kill myself
[1:24:24] my sins
[1:24:27] my sins is what killed my savior that's
[1:24:29] right
[1:24:31] man because if he had not died I
[1:24:33] couldn't believe it right right amen
[1:24:35] that's right
[1:24:37] my sins guilty I put him on the cross
[1:24:40] he died for me amen
[1:24:45] with no Roman spirit that you'd like
[1:24:48] he said I have power to call privilege
[1:24:51] of the language
[1:24:54] how much is 12 Legions at least 12 000.
[1:25:01] and one man they had one angel named
[1:25:03] wormwood destroyed the world of water
[1:25:07] he said I'm called 12 12 Legions
[1:25:14] we wouldn't do it
[1:25:17] amen thank you Lord
[1:25:19] he didn't do it
[1:25:21] where I could live amen amen
[1:25:25] I'm not gonna be a new creature
[1:25:28] but I don't ever having trouble yes but
[1:25:31] not in that Soul right
[1:25:34] because that should leading me to
[1:25:37] eternal life in this body right imagine
[1:25:41] and by that then this world will have to
[1:25:43] be made Eternal because my body comes
[1:25:46] from this world right
[1:25:49] his body come from this world
[1:25:51] so he could redeem all of it sure
[1:25:56] what do you think about it
[1:25:58] what is a new creature
[1:26:02] old things are passed away
[1:26:06] I gave you the quote it's in there to
[1:26:08] come back with run around and said
[1:26:10] William brownham died 32 years ago
[1:26:15] he used to be a boxer
[1:26:17] 115 professional fights
[1:26:21] retired to preach the gospel
[1:26:27] he said
[1:26:30] I couldn't stand it my old days
[1:26:32] he said the old teacher tried to get me
[1:26:34] the tie knots in a string you know kind
[1:26:37] of calm myself down he said I start
[1:26:39] tying knots I throw it down let's go
[1:26:41] back to five
[1:26:42] he's a tough little boy
[1:26:44] you know they've been beat on all his
[1:26:46] life
[1:26:47] you got the boxing
[1:26:50] 115 professional fights
[1:26:55] but he said now you can lead me around
[1:26:59] and I've heard people talk about things
[1:27:01] that they saw with Witnesses
[1:27:03] that people could take right around and
[1:27:05] just lick him off and just whatever
[1:27:07] this whatever you just leave him off
[1:27:13] he said it's the hardest thing in the
[1:27:15] world
[1:27:18] for you to get a meal ticket from him
[1:27:29] hardest thing in the world for him
[1:27:34] he wanted to help everybody
[1:27:37] no matter where you believed with him
[1:27:39] and talked with him
[1:27:42] but listen to him last night talking
[1:27:43] about a former
[1:27:45] business Minister that he used to have
[1:27:48] setting the meetings up and you'll find
[1:27:50] it in there he said I had to fire him
[1:27:53] but he wasn't on this state
[1:27:56] he should have found him selling her
[1:27:58] call he had to fire him
[1:28:03] but on this day he bragged on him as the
[1:28:05] greatest man in the world
[1:28:08] go down and listen to him preach it
[1:28:10] ain't nobody to preach like him
[1:28:13] that was brother Brown
[1:28:16] then Paul said one thing you couldn't
[1:28:18] tell you could not tell
[1:28:20] with a brother random friends or his
[1:28:22] enemies by the way I actually made
[1:28:27] you couldn't tell which was which by
[1:28:29] exactly
[1:28:33] that sure wasn't in the days when he was
[1:28:35] busting people's nose in
[1:28:39] he puts it all upon his conversion
[1:28:45] if this message don't bring a conversion
[1:28:47] to our hearts
[1:28:49] we don't need this message right right
[1:28:51] sure that's right they don't change us
[1:28:53] and our nature in our way we're in bad
[1:28:55] shape come on that's right we're in bad
[1:28:57] shape if it doesn't make a change in US
[1:29:00] right
[1:29:01] sure and I want you to make a whole lot
[1:29:03] more changes
[1:29:05] we've got a lot of things I need to get
[1:29:07] rid of
[1:29:08] I want him to change me
[1:29:11] but yet
[1:29:13] I know he's begun work the Bible says
[1:29:16] and the Bible says he'll finish that
[1:29:18] word amen that's right amen
[1:29:23] what do you think about it
[1:29:26] if we die Christ can live if we keep
[1:29:29] living Christ can't live
[1:29:31] that's why people don't receive the new
[1:29:33] birth right
[1:29:35] they're afraid you're going to give up
[1:29:37] too much that's right have you ever
[1:29:38] heard people say that I just have to
[1:29:40] quit too many things
[1:29:42] you don't have to quit nothing to get
[1:29:44] saved amen
[1:29:46] just get saved
[1:29:48] and let God quit
[1:29:51] I'm really Tom Farm Bush passed away not
[1:29:54] too long ago
[1:29:55] even before he heard of this message
[1:29:58] he used to smoke
[1:30:01] and he said one day he prayed and he
[1:30:02] said just like something said he said
[1:30:04] Lord take away the need and the desire
[1:30:09] well you know he couldn't say it no
