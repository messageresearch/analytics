[11:53] i'm not believing any god any devil any
[11:55] spirit in nothing i'm not believing in
[11:58] prayer i'm not believing going to the
[12:00] church because i went i tried to see god
[12:03] i tried to talk to god and i i would
[12:06] like to talk to him and let him talk to
[12:08] me
[12:09] i tried my best and some of my friends
[12:11] said uh you have to go to this temple
[12:13] and worship and god will appear to you
[12:16] and he speak to you so i did that i
[12:18] broken some coconuts and i did some you
[12:21] know prayers to the hindu goddesses in
[12:23] the hindu temples but i didn't find any
[12:25] god right so my christian brothers
[12:28] christian friends told me that let us go
[12:30] to the church and sit and worship the
[12:32] lord and he will appear and he will talk

[12:49] all places and worshipping god and lift
[12:52] i would like to see god but you know i i
[12:54] failed right
[12:55] so then i finally
[12:57] at the age of 13 what i'm thinking there

[1:08:02] easter proved he wasn't
[1:08:04] only the lord but he was god himself
[1:08:07] right
[1:08:08] why he's saying like this he wasn't a
[1:08:10] word
[1:08:11] bill abraham said the world the gospel
[1:08:14] not came not by letter all right only
[1:08:17] right it came by power and demonstration
[1:08:20] of the holy spirit
[1:08:21] and in in some places i have seen some
[1:08:24] people they don't concentrate of the of
[1:08:27] uh
[1:08:28] laying hands on the people yeah
[1:08:30] and they don't pray for the people
[1:08:32] because they still they take the court
[1:08:34] and they say brother bran said if you
[1:08:37] building you will receive that's okay
[1:08:39] right but whatever the scripture
[1:08:41] the scripture says these signs shall
[1:08:43] follow that belief right and that same
[1:08:46] problem the same god spoke to from bill
[1:08:49] branham he said if god be with us then
[1:08:51] where is all right right amen amen amen
[1:08:55] and the spirit i'm just watching and
[1:08:57] just just observing the spirits the
[1:08:59] spirit is like sad you see spirits yeah
[1:09:02] right now spirits like pharisees spirits
[1:09:05] see the pharisees believes in holy
[1:09:07] spirit and angels and the spirits and
[1:09:09] you know they believe in these things
[1:09:11] and sadnesses they don't believe that
[1:09:13] right they're villains they don't
[1:09:15] believe in angels they don't believe in
[1:09:16] spirits they don't believe in holy
[1:09:18] spirit right yes sir and the same
[1:09:20] spirits brother branham said that
[1:09:22] spirits will die i mean that people will
[1:09:25] die and the spirits are still alive
[1:09:28] that's right yes sir and the spirits are
[1:09:30] working today
[1:09:31] and it was modified little bit right and
[1:09:34] says if you build you will receive
[1:09:36] that's that's fine
[1:09:37] but what about your faith right the
[1:09:39] prayers of faith
[1:09:41] shall heal the sin right amen we have to
[1:09:44] have the power
