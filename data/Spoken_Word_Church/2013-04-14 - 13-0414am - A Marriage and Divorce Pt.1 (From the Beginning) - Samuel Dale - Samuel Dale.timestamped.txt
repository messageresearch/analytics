[3:23] Lord would bless the family and be with
[3:25] each one of them and remember brother
[3:27] Bob black he's over in Alabama preaching
[3:29] this morning so Alabama is probably
[3:31] about 3T of Water Deep this morning
[3:34] because when he's he sweats like
[3:37] everything you know he he sent me a text
[3:40] and said he was holding his Bible close
[3:41] so he wouldn't lose it yeah he's better
[3:43] hold his Bible cuz he's capable of
[3:45] losing it you know sometimes so maybe
[3:49] they'll he'll get through today God will
[3:51] be with him and just pray the Lord would
[3:53] bless him amen and all of that amen amen
[3:55] any other announcements that we need to
[3:58] make uh we uh have the camera situation
[4:02] set up now so they can turn around at
[4:05] any given time and pick up any of you
[4:08] and see the hes in your nose is that
[4:11] good I mean it's it's really great they
[4:14] can really pull in and just right in
[4:16] your eyeball and could look at your
[4:17] eyeball and and see down in it but we
[4:19] appreciate the brothers getting all of
[4:21] this stuff ready and and everything and
[4:24] fixing it we just appreciate
[4:26] it you know that way uh the people can
[4:30] see and we can see we were lifing
[4:34] yesterday about it that you know get
[4:36] everything set up so good until people
[4:37] to just start staying at home and
[4:40] watching the service and I said well I
[4:41] can handle that I'll just sit in front
[4:43] of my desk we'll put a camera up and
[4:45] I'll stay at home so we won't have no
[4:47] problem we can solve the whole thing
[4:50] amen we announced that we were going to
[4:53] start a topic on marriage and divorce
[4:55] and I don't know how many services it
[4:57] will be and I tell you up up front I
[5:00] have no uh personal bones to pick with
[5:04] nobody anybody that sees this or
[5:07] whatever I just try to preach what I
[5:09] believe and about every five years I go
[5:12] through a series on marriage and divorce
[5:15] because of the young people coming in
[5:17] and the young children coming up and you
[5:20] know it doesn't uh I don't have anything
[5:24] I just try to say what the prophet says
[5:26] if I cross you I I'm not meaning to I
[5:30] didn't do it you know what I mean I if I
[5:33] cross your Doctrine I wasn't the one
[5:35] that caused you to have the doctrine so
[5:38] we just have to deal with those things
[5:40] within ourselves and and it wouldn't
[5:42] matter to me if I'm like brother random
[5:45] was we'll get around to it when his boy
[5:47] came you know and said he's going to get
[5:49] married and everything and he laughed at
[5:51] him because God didn't show it to him
[5:53] you know that he was going to do it he
[5:54] went out and got married you know and
[5:56] they had the wedding anull and he came
[5:58] back and wanted his father to do the
[5:59] wedding you know to his L I think is her
[6:02] name and brother R said no way you know
[6:06] so he had to stand them irregardless and
[6:08] we have to tell it like it is
[6:10] irregardless of where it fits in and all
[6:13] of that and I try to tell you the whole
[6:15] truth of it as much as I know amen and
[6:19] then you know that's the best I can say
[6:20] about it okay let's pray and then read
[6:23] Matthew 19
[6:25] 3-8 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[6:28] for your love and your grace and to us
[6:30] thank you for this day that we
[6:32] have that Lord that we can come together
[6:35] and fellowship together around Thy word
[6:38] that we can Lord have an opportunity to
[6:41] be able to speak about you and Lord not
[6:45] then to have our own ideas or our
[6:47] thoughts because as a human mortal we
[6:50] would lean one way or the other because
[6:52] we're all that way but yet we will not
[6:56] try to lean but we will try to walk in
[6:58] the path of your love and Your Grace by
[7:01] the revealed word and just have your way
[7:03] now Lord and teach us to wait upon you
[7:06] guide each and everyone be with brother
[7:08] Bob there Lord as he's ministering today
[7:10] there in Alabama and just bless him and
[7:12] calm him down Lord because we know when
[7:14] doing like that it's kind of nervous and
[7:17] things but yet you'll be with him and
[7:19] it'll be fine Lord and we thank you and
[7:21] then just be with the with the cash
[7:23] family there brother Tracy and them the
[7:25] loss of their father and we pray that
[7:27] you would just bless them have your way
[7:30] now and keep us in Jesus name
[7:33] amen okay we will probably be reading
[7:36] this scripture on the basis of all of
[7:39] the the uh doings you know and
[7:45] uh getting it right I told him verse
[7:48] four so we will read verse
[7:51] three and the Pharisees also came unto
[7:54] him tempting him saying unto him is it
[7:57] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[7:59] forever cause and he answered and said
[8:02] unto them have you not read that he
[8:04] which made them at the beginning made
[8:06] them male and female and so for this
[8:09] cause shall a man leave his father and
[8:11] mother and shall
[8:14] cleave to his wife and they twine shall
[8:17] be one flesh wherefore they are no more
[8:19] twine but one flesh what therefore God
[8:22] hath joined together let no man put
[8:24] aunder they say unto him why did Moses
[8:28] then command to a writing of divorcement
[8:31] and to put her away he sath unto them
[8:35] Moses because of the hardness of your
[8:38] hearts suffered you to put away your
[8:40] wives but from the beginning it was not
[8:44] so you may be seated the Lord at his
[8:46] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[8:51] as I said I want to take my time and and
[8:55] try not to be too lengthy with with
[8:58] doing but yet to try to um do the best I
[9:02] can to answer and there questions then
[9:05] you write down the questions you know
[9:07] and and I'm honest sometimes questions
[9:11] are are asked and the person answering
[9:15] them doesn't know exactly what's on the
[9:16] person's mind that is am I turned on or
[9:20] I need to be turned up need to be turned
[9:23] up a little
[9:24] Joshy they're saying they're not being
[9:26] able to hear so we want everybody to be
[9:29] able to hear and just pull it up a
[9:30] little bit but don't peek out the ears
[9:33] okay that better we got you we can get
[9:35] up a little bit all right but I don't
[9:39] want to be offensive about anything but
[9:42] I want to try to tell the truth to do
[9:45] the best that I know of and as I was
[9:48] saying if you have questions write your
[9:52] questions out but write them as uh the
[9:56] basis of saying uh if so and
[10:00] so you know this is my case explain it
[10:04] cuz that way I'll be better able to
[10:06] answer it than to just ask me an overall
[10:09] question and we got a kind of comical
[10:12] thing that we do in the Bible study and
[10:15] somebody will have a question especially
[10:17] sister Susan may ask a question and she
[10:21] says I'm asking this for a friend of
[10:25] mine you know but uh that's okay ask GI
[10:29] for a friend this is not me but I'm
[10:30] wanting to know you know but uh we're
[10:33] glad to have our sister back there with
[10:35] us she's not a visitor with us she's
[10:38] welcome she's here with us but amen you
[10:41] know but all right now let's read a
[10:44] couple of scriptures and then get into
[10:46] some thoughts and and all and you know
[10:49] try to to be able to follow the prophet
[10:52] so let's go to Matthew 19 and just read
[10:55] this and go over it very
[10:57] slowly as we we go through Matthew and
[11:01] Mark as the reading and then we'll try
[11:05] to start making comments but I want to
[11:07] come in a little bit along the way as we
[11:09] go through to get your thoughts in your
[11:12] mind so it came to pass that when Jesus
[11:15] had finished these sayings he departed
[11:17] from Galilee and came into the coast of
[11:19] Judea under Jordan Beyond Jordan and
[11:21] great multitude followed him and he
[11:23] healed them there all right and what the
[11:26] Pharisees also came unto him tempting
[11:31] him they were not wanting to know
[11:36] uh an answer for themselves that's right
[11:40] they were wanting to trap him y right Y
[11:44] and you know they knew that he had made
[11:47] some maybe stands on things that he had
[11:49] talked of and done and they were wanting
[11:52] to tempt him right or test him or try
[11:55] him right and really they wanted to show
[11:58] him how smart they
[11:59] were you know we have studied the
[12:03] word we know what Moses said you know so
[12:10] that you know that they were tempting
[12:11] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[12:14] a man to put away his wife forever cause
[12:18] you see the
[12:19] tempting there is no scripture that
[12:22] Moses gave them writing a divorcement
[12:25] for any
[12:26] cause right they turn turned it into
[12:30] that right they had made it to be that
[12:33] they had
[12:35] interpreted uh the the writings of
[12:39] Moses but how could Moses give anything
[12:43] contrary to the word of
[12:45] God but see they were tempting him and
[12:47] saying can you do it for any cause you
[12:50] know forever cause you know my wife
[12:53] burnt the bread this morning can I
[12:54] divorce her you know uh she doesn't take
[12:58] a bath too often you say those are being
[13:01] silly that's how silly I'm trying to be
[13:03] because that's what silliness really is
[13:05] is when you're trying to tempt someone
[13:08] and then you're stating that Moses said
[13:12] we can put our wives away for any
[13:15] cause or every you know make sure you
[13:18] get
[13:19] it but that Moses didn't do that no
[13:23] right it's even hard to find the place
[13:27] in there uh of where it is and really if
[13:30] you go to Deuteronomy 24 which is a very
[13:33] odd scripture and that's the only
[13:36] connection I can bring to Moses and his
[13:39] writing of divorcement you don't see
[13:41] anything where he says like Paul you
[13:44] know did later on in his doings but it's
[13:47] got to be there because the prophet said
[13:49] it was all right but you understand what
[13:52] I'm saying now in no way do we believe
[13:56] that you can just put away your wife for
[13:58] any cause or
[14:00] everost we will go through the
[14:02] scriptures of the only reasons a man can
[14:06] divorce his
[14:08] wife all right then we'll try to cover
[14:10] some of that and the points that he can
[14:13] divorce his wife and remarry right but
[14:16] there is no scripture I'm going up front
[14:18] blunt Point see that way a lot of people
[14:21] click off the Internet won't listen to
[14:23] the rest of it because they they'll know
[14:25] that we're we're not going to play there
[14:27] is no scripture whatsoever ever for a
[14:29] woman to divorce her husband amen that's
[14:32] there's no prophet's message nowhere or
[14:34] anything for the woman to divorce her
[14:36] husband no that's right and marry
[14:40] again I will be honest because I try to
[14:44] be in a daily situation like we're
[14:49] living I think a lot of times some of
[14:51] the women today could pull away from
[14:53] their husband but not try to divorce
[14:56] them amen right you know cuz there's no
[14:59] divorce for a woman
[15:00] right see you say well we we can't do
[15:03] this out of the other the court will
[15:05] make you take care of your children
[15:07] right so you can don't pull up things on
[15:10] me to be you
[15:11] know like that we just blunt I am blunt
[15:15] anyway uh you say well that are you
[15:17] saying that some I'm saying some women
[15:20] don't have to live under the condition
[15:21] they're
[15:22] in you don't have to live with a man
[15:25] that beats you and all other of things
[15:27] like that you don't have to
[15:29] you said well now where's the scripture
[15:31] that's brother
[15:33] Dale
[15:35] okay I don't mind saying things like
[15:37] that cuz I'm trying to Pastor a church
[15:40] if you was up here you ought to be able
[15:42] to say those things too but are you
[15:44] getting the point they wanted to tempt
[15:48] him now they didn't pick on uh clothes
[15:52] and H and dresses
[15:55] and right their picking was marriage and
[15:59] divorce we're getting a quote in the
[16:01] prophet in just a minute that anytime
[16:03] people get together religious matters
[16:04] that automatically comes up all right
[16:07] but watch now what was his
[16:12] answer they said Moses said we can just
[16:15] put her away for ever
[16:17] CA what was his
[16:21] answer reading his answer you
[16:24] immediately see that he didn't agree
[16:26] with him that's right
[16:29] right because what did he say and he
[16:31] answered and said unto them have you not
[16:34] read that he which made them at the
[16:36] beginning made them male and
[16:40] female now we'll get to that in a minute
[16:42] because there we got to cover two
[16:44] creation Parts there one where he's
[16:47] she's made in Adam and the other one
[16:48] where she comes into her own being all
[16:50] right look at verse five and said for
[16:53] this cause shall a man leave his father
[16:55] and his mother shall cleave to his wife
[16:56] and they twine shall be one flesh
[16:58] wherefore they are no more twine but one
[17:01] flesh what therefore God ha joined
[17:04] together let no man put us under all
[17:07] right now what God joins
[17:11] together you better not play with that's
[17:13] the words of the prophet he said not
[17:15] what some drunken magistrate done or
[17:18] whatever you know because that's the
[17:19] laws of the land that you go down and do
[17:21] those
[17:23] things and they say unto
[17:27] him what did Moses didn't command to
[17:29] give a writing of
[17:31] divorcement and to put her
[17:33] away
[17:37] why you agree that Moses done this and
[17:40] Jesus would have said that's
[17:43] right I wouldn't agree with the way
[17:46] maybe you said he was to do it because
[17:49] that's where he went right to the
[17:50] beginning he didn't go down to where
[17:52] there was a fall and a problem of
[17:55] marriage and divorce he goes straight
[17:57] back to the garden right
[18:00] Amen to give his answer so your answer
[18:02] got to come out of Genesis right they
[18:04] say why did Moses
[18:06] then give a writing of divorcement to
[18:09] put her away he sath unto them because
[18:13] Moses because of the hardness of your
[18:15] hearts suffered you to put away your
[18:18] wise but from the beginning it was not
[18:21] so now Moses gave a writing of
[18:26] divorcement all right blunt start with
[18:29] not for any
[18:31] cause or every cause Jesus answers that
[18:35] he turns you straight back to the
[18:38] beginning he doesn't turn you back to
[18:40] Genesis 3 4 5 7 10 or something you know
[18:44] where the fall that happened and all
[18:45] these things he turns you right straight
[18:47] back to the Garden of
[18:50] Eden all
[18:53] right and he says it wasn't so from the
[18:56] beginning now brother randam I'll give
[18:58] you one minute where he said and it
[18:59] won't be so over there right all right
[19:02] see now we're going to try to get into
[19:04] some thoughts now but I want you to read
[19:06] this one and think about
[19:09] it but I want to read
[19:11] Mark it's basically the same reading but
[19:15] there is a couple of of uh things a
[19:19] little bit different and you remember
[19:21] how the other week what I was preaching
[19:23] that if we can take this scripture and
[19:25] this scripture and they come together
[19:27] this one may have more in it on certain
[19:29] things where this one over here doesn't
[19:31] have certain things in it but we bring
[19:33] them together not as a contradictory but
[19:36] we bring them together as a
[19:40] uh an
[19:42] explaining right uh brother gave me
[19:46] some quotes off of the internet and I
[19:49] won't call the name
[19:52] but this brother is trying to prove how
[19:55] many contradictions there are in the
[19:57] Bible
[20:00] he does a good
[20:03] job I don't agree with him but to the
[20:06] carnal mind that just sits down and
[20:07] reads it looks good you know what I
[20:10] thought I thought you know what
[20:12] Lord
[20:14] Satan he don't need no
[20:17] help he took a vacation when the PE when
[20:21] the preachers of this message come along
[20:24] that's right the Bible calls them as
[20:26] Ministers of righteousness right
[20:28] Satan's
[20:32] Angels then he just gone on
[20:36] vacation he's letting all these
[20:38] preachers fight it
[20:39] out wasn't that what they were doing
[20:41] down at horb or is that horb when they
[20:43] were around the mountain and things and
[20:45] finally they said Moses said it's enough
[20:48] let's get out of here and go to the
[20:49] promised land let's do something all
[20:51] right pull it back up
[20:53] brother Mark says things just a little
[20:56] bit different in his sayings
[20:59] and the Pharisees came to him asking him
[21:01] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[21:02] wife tempting him see they don't go
[21:06] into Paul Matthew wrote one
[21:10] form Mark comes along and he picks it up
[21:15] from understanding because Mark and Luke
[21:18] were not original disciples but I
[21:21] believe they're Pro perfectly correct
[21:23] you know but he picks it up from the
[21:26] things he's heard and taught with the
[21:28] disciples so he doesn't bring it out
[21:30] maybe the emphasis of how that they were
[21:34] uh saying for any cause so he just
[21:37] brings it maybe as the point is it
[21:39] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[21:41] tempting
[21:43] him and he answered and said unto them
[21:46] what did Moses command
[21:48] you they said Moses
[21:51] suffered to write a bill of divorcement
[21:53] and to put her
[21:54] away now if that word is anything close
[21:59] to the human language of what we're
[22:01] talking about reason I wanted to get
[22:03] these scriptures
[22:05] today it says suffered and it was in
[22:09] Matthew which would mean that it was
[22:12] not
[22:16] uh God would permit
[22:19] it all right right in other words Moses
[22:23] was permitted to give the the the grace
[22:28] all right he he he suffered it it was
[22:32] something that was hard to do it was
[22:36] something that was horrible to have to
[22:39] face you think of brother brandom said
[22:41] going there that day to preach he said
[22:44] people are married four or five times
[22:45] you know and all and then I got it he
[22:47] said my own son sitting
[22:50] there it's so he's emphasizing both of
[22:53] them is that he Moses was suffering when
[22:56] this came about not just Moses was okie
[23:00] dokie I'll just tell you how it is we
[23:01] can do it this way now all the emphasis
[23:04] is upon the bases that Moses was
[23:08] suffering in agony before God remember
[23:11] brother Brown said I could how can I
[23:13] tell him he in 64 he knows and he's on
[23:16] the questions and answers and he's had
[23:18] the scriptures and but he said what can
[23:20] I
[23:22] say so he suffered with it a long time
[23:25] didn't he all right Jesus answered and
[23:28] said unto them for the hardness of your
[23:30] heart he wrote you this precept in other
[23:32] words y that's right you went out and
[23:35] done
[23:37] it you know you done it yep it was
[23:42] because of you that he had to do this
[23:45] yep right so he tried to straighten it
[23:47] up and do the best he could wa how would
[23:49] you else would you say it
[23:52] right Paul would come along and say I
[23:56] say that was pretty pretty powerful yeah
[23:59] brother randam said that didn't
[24:02] he but from the beginning of the
[24:04] creation of creation God made them male
[24:08] and female now specifically reason I'm
[24:10] stating that see from the beginning of
[24:12] the creation when it said the
[24:14] beginning and and the other one you you
[24:16] can Dilly dadly with words because
[24:19] there's many many many
[24:22] Beginnings in the beginning God created
[24:24] heaven and the Earth then you can read
[24:27] the next verse or two you know and say
[24:29] in the beginning God created this in the
[24:32] beginning God created that in the
[24:33] beginning God there's many many many
[24:36] Beginnings
[24:38] right so God is making sure that we use
[24:41] it in the word
[24:45] creation all right because now we'll get
[24:48] to it in a minute right Eve was not in
[24:51] an original
[24:54] creation so he says in the beginning of
[24:56] the creation of God God
[24:58] made God made them male and
[25:01] female all right now for this called
[25:06] shall a man leave his father and his
[25:07] mother and cleave to his wife why
[25:12] because the prophet said if you get a
[25:14] revelation that that is your wife he
[25:17] said that's your wife for life you know
[25:20] that Adam and Eve had the same
[25:24] theophany you see how long it would take
[25:26] to preach if we went through every point
[25:29] if you want to somebody on the internet
[25:31] send me a note I'll be glad to send them
[25:33] to you go on your computer and you can
[25:34] find them without sending them to
[25:36] me Adam and Eve had the same the offing
[25:43] right
[25:46] okay was Eve a body running around
[25:49] inside of
[25:50] Adam not exactly that's right all right
[25:54] we're going to get to some things maybe
[25:57] went fishing yesterday and Zach he was
[25:59] sleeping and I was
[26:01] thinking
[26:02] so we was getting burn
[26:06] back
[26:08] and but look they TR shall be one flesh
[26:12] so then they are no more Twain but one
[26:17] flesh man and woman lives together long
[26:19] enough they even start looking alike
[26:22] there's a a scientific fact to that
[26:25] that's
[26:26] right
[26:28] now see that's why that a husband and
[26:31] wife
[26:32] is a type of Christ in the
[26:35] church now see it's hard to to try to
[26:38] keep down I got notes laying on the desk
[26:40] and my mind's wanting to go to page 14
[26:43] all right
[26:45] wherefore what
[26:48] therefore God ha joined together let no
[26:51] man put us under all right now think
[26:54] about
[26:56] it and I'm going to want to mention this
[26:58] two or three times to where it will stay
[26:59] upon your
[27:01] mind the reason we read in Mark of the
[27:05] creation
[27:06] that and we don't have V over here kind
[27:09] of zero in keep up with me now he just
[27:11] sits back there on that little old thing
[27:13] he can follow me anywhere I walk that's
[27:15] no joke I can walk back to the back and
[27:18] he can follow me all the way to the back
[27:21] we were life in while ago you could
[27:22] standing in the office like Z wrote in
[27:25] you could see who was standing back
[27:26] there in their office and do it but all
[27:29] right so maybe I can move some he just
[27:31] keep it set on the Bo and I'll move
[27:34] around all right
[27:37] now let's think about
[27:39] first cuz the title would be you know
[27:41] marriage and divorce part one but it'll
[27:44] be from the beginning all right now
[27:47] that's what we're going to be dealing
[27:48] with so we're not going to be going over
[27:50] into a lot of other things we're going
[27:52] to be staying with the creation all
[27:54] right everybody understand me you know
[27:57] in my mind mind is hard to do that
[27:59] but I'm wanting to stay on the creation
[28:02] not the fall we'll start this afternoon
[28:04] and call it the
[28:05] fall but we're talking this morning
[28:07] about the
[28:09] creation all right so we know that and
[28:12] we'll read it that Eve was not in the
[28:15] original
[28:17] creation she was in
[28:19] Adam all right so then you got a
[28:22] creation of
[28:25] mankind and you got you know the you got
[28:28] a creation of the world the
[28:30] animals and they're made male and female
[28:32] male and female dog horse cow whatever
[28:35] male and female all right now when you
[28:39] come to the human
[28:41] race it didn't start out that way it
[28:45] started out with Eve being in
[28:49] Adam not as an identity not as a uh
[28:54] person running around and all of this
[28:56] that and the other
[29:01] but she was in
[29:03] Adam then she was taken from Adam
[29:09] right and
[29:11] made a by
[29:14] product all
[29:17] right so you know how I am on
[29:20] that I believe what the prophet said
[29:22] I'll try to go through everything he
[29:23] said on
[29:25] it but when you say byct Tru what do you
[29:32] mean well the man is a porterhouse
[29:36] steak and the woman she's just a little
[29:38] old h of hamburger with a bunch of uh
[29:40] what did you used to put in the
[29:42] hamburger
[29:44] mouth oatmeal we couldn't afford nothing
[29:47] El we didn't have all all you got so my
[29:49] wife would put oatmeal in the hamburger
[29:52] it's pretty good it it was ate a bullet
[29:55] it's kept us
[29:56] alive but that's what they
[29:59] think they think that she's just nothing
[30:05] right and you hear the preachers
[30:07] emphasize she's not even in the original
[30:15] creation but you've heard me say it too
[30:18] that God thought so much of Eve until he
[30:22] never made her like the rest of the
[30:23] animals you're only thinking of the
[30:25] sinful side right he took her from
[30:30] adamen cuz if that hadn't happen we
[30:32] couldn't come from
[30:34] Christ so I think you ought to change a
[30:37] little bit of your thinking on these
[30:40] points cuz you know most body by
[30:44] product and I don't like jokes you know
[30:47] preachers in this message will say
[30:48] that's the way women are they'll buy
[30:50] products all the time I think that's
[30:53] getting pretty close to being
[30:56] sinful
[30:59] I know a lot of men buy things all the
[31:01] time don't
[31:05] you our problem is we buy big things
[31:08] cars
[31:13] trucks
[31:15] guns where's Danny Danny's hiding there
[31:19] but now
[31:21] listen so there's two Creations that
[31:23] you're dealing
[31:24] with but now I'm going to make it plain
[31:27] to
[31:28] front when Eve was taken from
[31:31] Adam did he make her
[31:38] wrong just because you use the word by
[31:43] product does that mean he made her
[31:47] wrong if he did God's the author of her
[31:50] being wrong he can't condemn her for
[31:51] being wrong that's right solves a
[31:54] problem that's right right amen you
[31:58] know brother Brown is pretty specific
[32:00] about a lot of things but we just don't
[32:02] look enough we want to look at by
[32:05] product for all of the things we want
[32:06] down under here that says the bad
[32:08] looking
[32:09] things if you ever notice one we read it
[32:11] in a little
[32:12] while you know you're the byproduct of
[32:14] your mom and
[32:21] daddy is that pretty bad
[32:26] huh you're the byproduct your mom and
[32:30] daddy and you wouldn't be here if God
[32:33] hadn't have done that and made a
[32:38] byproduct you don't even look up
[32:40] byproduct I've tried to be common you
[32:42] know straight about
[32:44] it the word byproduct and Webster comes
[32:48] up to say in of equal value are
[32:54] greater but you don't ever hear these
[32:56] things
[32:58] you only hear the women women is just
[33:02] nothing dog
[33:05] meat well what you want to marry one for
[33:07] if it's dog
[33:09] meat I didn't marry no dog
[33:14] meat how can you be come together as one
[33:16] flesh if you call her a dog meat
[33:20] right now come on are we in the Bible oh
[33:23] we don't want to talk like that brother
[33:24] Dale we've turned you off well goodbye
[33:32] but you see if they become one
[33:36] flesh that's
[33:38] emphasized throughout the Bible right
[33:42] the two becomes
[33:43] one the problem is is where we stay to
[33:47] and claim to be married as one right
[33:50] amen right but we're supposed to be one
[33:53] if we're one then uh you might might
[33:57] order to get off your word byproduct so
[33:59] hard and try to listen to brother random
[34:02] as he's talking sure he's explaining
[34:04] things he has
[34:06] to you talking about rough read marriage
[34:08] and divorce I've asked you to read these
[34:10] things you talking about rough it's
[34:13] rough but it was a truth
[34:16] amen like one lady said he called me a
[34:18] vulture another said well he called me
[34:20] an eagle so it's According to which one
[34:22] you
[34:23] want but are you getting get the point
[34:26] now
[34:28] there was was there any fall I'll re
[34:30] repeat this if I have time was there any
[34:33] problems with the creation of
[34:38] Adam there any problem with the fact
[34:40] that he could be created male and
[34:43] female no Fallen condition there for
[34:45] those Pharisees to argue about was he
[34:47] right you see what Jesus done what could
[34:50] be a smarter I don't mean smarter but
[34:53] you know what could have been a greater
[34:55] answer that could could have been given
[34:57] to those
[34:59] Pharisees of course it didn't straighten
[35:01] them out but what was the better answer
[35:03] than he could have given to said go back
[35:05] to the beginning
[35:07] y if he' stopped anywhere they would
[35:10] have had
[35:12] argument he to stop with David they whoa
[35:15] Whoa man we got you now cuz David had a
[35:19] thousand
[35:24] wives yeah
[35:27] but you know if they' have went that way
[35:29] God was so great he would have just
[35:30] simply answered them and said but none
[35:32] of them wives could have another husband
[35:35] that's
[35:36] right he could have put it out there
[35:38] that's right that's right but yet he
[35:40] went right back to the beginning and
[35:42] nailed it down there's no way to argue
[35:44] then about marriage and divorce the
[35:46] arguments of marriage and divorce is
[35:51] irrelevant see our thoughts and our
[35:53] ideas about it is from Tommy rot
[35:58] right the word is true amen was there
[36:02] any problem then with
[36:04] Adam was any problem with a sinful
[36:08] condition
[36:12] existing when Adam was male and
[36:15] female was there
[36:19] any okay let's move up a step now let's
[36:22] see you agree with that one let's see if
[36:24] you agree with this one was there any
[36:26] problems
[36:28] with Adam and
[36:32] Eve once Eve was taken from
[36:40] Adam was there any problem with Adam and
[36:43] Eve when they were standing in the
[36:45] garden come
[36:47] on oh but brother Dale that's the way he
[36:50] made
[36:51] her quoting out of marriage and
[36:55] divorce I want you to explain to me how
[36:57] he made
[37:04] Eve I want that explanation how did he
[37:06] make Eve that would make her do what she
[37:09] done that he made her do that and then
[37:13] him being a just God and condem
[37:18] her that's why the brother one time
[37:21] wanted me to come over and preach for a
[37:23] week or so on marriage and divorce at
[37:25] his church and I just simply made him a
[37:28] good answer I said I plenty of tapes on
[37:30] the internet if you want to go back I'll
[37:33] be glad to come you set the
[37:36] date but I said go back to the internet
[37:40] and pull up marriage and divorce and see
[37:41] what I've preached about it and the way
[37:44] I preach it you probably or might not
[37:46] want me to come well you know what I had
[37:48] been yet and that's been probably 5
[37:50] years ago but you know okay no
[37:54] problem see I'm just plunged about what
[37:57] I
[37:58] say show me something about Eve the way
[38:01] she was
[38:07] made did she get something
[38:11] different about
[38:13] her if so what was
[38:21] it I'm going to drop off of this now but
[38:24] I'm coming back to it okay
[38:30] what way was she
[38:37] made that would make her so
[38:41] wrong and God making her that
[38:45] way see the B
[38:52] product she was a byproduct why because
[38:54] she was in Adam right
[38:57] she was not in the original creation
[39:00] right the dogs the cats no the male
[39:03] female she was not in the original
[39:05] creation we understand that but once he
[39:08] made
[39:13] her what was the
[39:15] wrong that was made about
[39:20] her right I'm just asking simple
[39:24] questions I like questions myself
[39:28] but I like to see people that sits quiet
[39:30] and looks at you because you're thinking
[39:32] what in the world this guy going to say
[39:34] next that's
[39:38] right you learned a lot to not holler
[39:40] and scream had
[39:42] you you found out I wouldn't go in that
[39:46] direction all
[39:49] right but you think about it now we're
[39:51] coming back to that
[39:54] later I like what brother random said on
[39:57] marriage and
[39:59] divorce he said it I think on the
[40:02] conduct order and doctorine I know I've
[40:04] read a couple of times but I know he did
[40:06] marriage and
[40:08] divorce he said God made a
[40:11] way that we could marry our wives and it
[40:15] be
[40:20] correct and it's not sinful for you to
[40:23] marry a
[40:25] wife is normal
[40:28] life that's right
[40:31] right all
[40:33] right he made a way and he said it this
[40:37] way he said if there is a
[40:39] question
[40:43] anywhere God has the
[40:46] answer to that question all right so now
[40:50] keep that in mind but the point is two
[40:55] creations
[40:56] created first in Adam male and female
[41:00] standing in one
[41:01] being all right next Adam and Eve
[41:04] standing side by
[41:06] side now I want to know the sinful part
[41:09] there
[41:16] right I don't like to use bad
[41:19] words but did he make her
[41:21] so
[41:25] uh
[41:31] so much burning with
[41:41] lust
[41:43] yeah if he did then he made her y you
[41:47] got to deal with that not
[41:49] me he made her that
[41:54] way there's always
[41:57] answer all right all right let's let's
[42:00] take a few quotes and then from that
[42:02] point and try to work her way down
[42:04] through some scriptures and the quest
[42:06] the points of the Prophet go ahead with
[42:08] number
[42:09] three on marriage and
[42:13] divorce preached in 1965 221 the morning
[42:17] service paragraph
[42:20] 5758 this scripture this question
[42:23] confronted Jesus at the beginning of his
[42:25] ministry
[42:26] and it confronted Moses at the beginning
[42:28] of his ministry
[42:30] okay we could put another one in there
[42:33] which would not be adding but we could
[42:34] say it confronted Paul in the beginning
[42:36] of his ministry right because that was
[42:38] the three
[42:41] points it's a foremost question in the
[42:44] believer's
[42:45] hearts now look how your Prophet talked
[42:49] The Sinner doesn't care no right
[42:52] y but it's to Believers because the
[42:55] believer is trying to do all that he
[42:56] know how to do to live right before God
[42:59] you amen
[43:01] that all
[43:03] right therefore if any question comes up
[43:05] on
[43:08] religion you know you sit down you start
[43:10] talking to somebody about
[43:13] religion what's the first thing will
[43:15] come
[43:17] up he's TR just just start talking to
[43:19] somebody about a religious matter and
[43:22] watch it read right on over into uh
[43:25] marriage and div argument
[43:28] right any question comes up on on
[43:31] religion then the marriage and divorce
[43:33] case comes up why because it is the
[43:36] cause of the original
[43:39] sin
[43:41] okay that's where sin
[43:44] started that's the reason it brought up
[43:47] it's brought up every time because it is
[43:50] the very beginning of
[43:54] sin that's right
[43:57] okay now where's he going right back to
[43:59] the Garden what did Eve do look down she
[44:05] committed
[44:07] adultery that brought forth the first
[44:09] child which was Cain Satan's own son for
[44:13] in him laid evil it did not come through
[44:16] Abel Satan's son was
[44:19] Cain now I ain't going to get into that
[44:22] because there's going to be an argument
[44:24] there we got them laying down we'll get
[44:26] back to it you say no Eve didn't commit
[44:32] adultery well you're a prophet said she
[44:35] did
[44:36] amen yeah but they had never lived
[44:39] together yet they weren husband and wife
[44:40] I'm
[44:43] sorry they was a whole lot closer to
[44:46] being husband and wife than you and your
[44:49] wife was when you started
[44:52] dating
[44:54] right because she come out of him that's
[44:59] right so she committed adultery
[45:04] amen
[45:07] okay and so he goes back into the basis
[45:10] of the beginning and the original
[45:14] sin and he says that was the cause of it
[45:19] right or the original sin look at the
[45:22] next
[45:23] one questions and answers 6 4 real three
[45:27] paragraph
[45:31] 3:30 she said that was Adam's
[45:37] son it was not Adam's son she said I got
[45:41] it from
[45:43] God and we know she did right cuz God's
[45:46] the only one that can bring
[45:48] life and she had to it was a
[45:52] seed it was a
[45:54] seed but it was serpent serpent
[45:57] seed now you're going to the Garden
[46:00] you're going to pick up serpent seed and
[46:02] we're going to get down into something
[46:03] in a minute and let's see if it'll tie
[46:06] together with what caused Eve to do what
[46:09] she done oh she a serpent seed now show
[46:12] me where she was
[46:15] no show me where Eve was serpent
[46:19] seed that's why I'm reading
[46:24] this
[46:26] all
[46:27] right but it was serpent seed and he had
[46:30] to come back a virgin and in order to
[46:32] clear up that sexual act that had been
[46:34] done now he had to come through the
[46:37] wound right Adam was put here on Earth
[46:41] but he he never found out that he was to
[46:44] be a father you understand what I mean
[46:46] Satan knowing this he got to Eve before
[46:50] Adam got D and D is where the whole
[46:52] thing lays today and brother that's what
[46:56] makes marriage and divorce and
[46:58] everything else such a scruple as it is
[47:01] today so what is marriage and divorce
[47:03] going back to the Garden of
[47:04] Eden the serpent
[47:11] seed see so Jesus when he said go back
[47:14] to the Garden go back to the beginning
[47:17] go back to the
[47:21] creation there was no serpent seed
[47:23] connection to the original creation
[47:31] nothing in the original am I quoting him
[47:34] nothing in the original can be immoral
[47:37] immoral every how I pronounce my words
[47:40] dirty rotten stinking or whatever you
[47:42] want to call it on the internet I'm just
[47:44] playing old
[47:45] Georgia
[47:47] immoral nothing in the original creation
[47:49] can't do it that's
[47:52] right
[47:54] right
[47:56] but what was it it's the seed of the
[48:01] serpent what caused marriage in
[48:04] divorce to come into
[48:09] being the way Eve was
[48:16] created or the serpent
[48:23] seed which one was it
[48:27] see we only look then at the serpent
[48:29] seed as a SE
[48:34] act that's basically people talk about
[48:36] serpent
[48:42] seed but we're going to see in a minute
[48:44] why Eve had the ability to do what she
[48:50] done but get it it's a serpent seed so
[48:54] anytime marriage divorce comes
[48:58] up the serpent seat automatically
[49:01] appears
[49:03] right because there is your original
[49:06] attribute
[49:08] right here's where we go with it in the
[49:11] minute
[49:12] see sin is not
[49:15] adultery I got that quote laying here if
[49:18] you ever wanted it that
[49:21] way sin is not Ault that's an attribute
[49:24] that's amen so Eve had to do something
[49:28] wrong before the adulterous act could
[49:32] transpire to be to the seat of the
[49:34] serpent coming
[49:36] in but what was
[49:39] it look at number five just giving you a
[49:42] few things in mind and then we'll drop
[49:45] into her points this is taken from
[49:47] marriage and divorce paragraph 275 but
[49:50] you see women you are you are a jewel if
[49:53] you want to be a jewel but the desire
[49:56] has to be by you and you see why the
[49:59] marriage and divorce was that Jesus
[50:02] pointed back under it was because your
[50:05] kind was the cause of all sin that's the
[50:08] reason polygamy and divorce and things
[50:11] was introduced at the beginning it never
[50:14] was so and it won't be so in the world o
[50:21] Yonder
[50:24] now
[50:26] think about
[50:33] it so God created man in his own
[50:36] image I'll just paraphrase these we have
[50:39] to go with number six s we'll drop down
[50:41] to number
[50:44] eight so God created man his own image
[50:47] and the image of God created he him male
[50:49] and female created he
[50:52] them right and God bless them and God
[50:56] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[50:58] and replenish the Earth that's Genesis
[50:59] 1:26 and 27 right or
[51:03] 27:28 and God blessed them and said unto
[51:06] them be fruitful and multiply so there
[51:09] was Eve and
[51:11] Adam in the original creation
[51:14] right he made them male and
[51:18] female made them to rule over everything
[51:21] because he jumps over to chapter 5 and
[51:23] makes this outstanding statement
[51:25] it still doesn't mean that you wait to
[51:27] that point to get to it because in
[51:29] chapter 5 of Genesis he said this is the
[51:31] book of the generations of
[51:33] Adam he's not explaining nothing he's
[51:36] giving you the generations all right in
[51:39] the day that God created man in the
[51:42] likeness of God made he him male and
[51:45] female created he them and blessed them
[51:47] and called their name Adam in the day
[51:49] when they were created all right so when
[51:53] they were created Adam's name was Adam
[51:55] and Eve was in Adam right you go along
[51:57] with that amen amen all right when she's
[52:00] taken from Adam what is her
[52:04] name she doesn't get her name until the
[52:07] fall comes that's
[52:09] right you go on over in Genesis about 23
[52:13] somewhere over in there and it says
[52:15] she's called Eve cuz she's the mother of
[52:17] all living her name is still Adam when
[52:20] they were standing in the garden as Adam
[52:23] and Eve standing there as two human
[52:25] beings
[52:28] beings so closely related together that
[52:32] they were one right but yet it's two
[52:34] separate
[52:36] beings no
[52:39] fall
[52:41] right no
[52:46] fall because it's she she gets her name
[52:50] later y That's right until she comes
[52:53] forth from Adam and the sin happens her
[52:56] name is
[52:57] Adam our name is supposed to be Christ
[53:00] we only have one husband we're
[53:02] Adam spiritual right Christ Jesus all
[53:07] right
[53:09] now let's read a couple of quotes and
[53:12] then we'll get to a
[53:14] point cuz I'm laying this down as close
[53:17] as I can relating to what I want you and
[53:19] to get your mind to follow
[53:22] me you say we you'll not tell us we
[53:25] doing
[53:26] that well why not that's
[53:30] right this is the way it comes to me
[53:32] that's why can't I tell you to where it
[53:34] comes to me and get you to listen come
[53:36] on all right go ahead with number eight
[53:39] this is taken from marriage and divorce
[53:41] paragraph uh 89 through it actually
[53:45] going into 105 but it' be two or three
[53:48] quotes he says the question the true
[53:50] answer that
[53:51] Jesus want us to go back to the true
[53:57] answer is to go back to the beginning
[54:00] then that would be in Genesis because
[54:02] the word Genesis is a seed chapter every
[54:03] question in the Bible and you always
[54:05] have to go back to the seed to see what
[54:07] kind of a seed is in the field to find
[54:10] out what your crops will be all right
[54:12] goes back to the beginning he introduces
[54:14] the beginning Jesus said go back to the
[54:16] beginning there was only one pair of
[54:19] everything on
[54:21] Earth there was there was one Adam one
[54:25] Eve they were joined by God Alone Now
[54:29] where's he
[54:30] standing Eve is taken from
[54:35] Adam the animals are created male and
[54:39] female Adam comes forth with Eve and
[54:43] Adam then Eve is taken from Adam now
[54:45] they're
[54:48] standing so in the original is never to
[54:50] have
[54:51] been one male and one female
[54:58] you say yeah but what about David and
[54:59] all of his
[55:04] types I got a few questions when we get
[55:06] down to that too all right I love to ask
[55:10] you questions it makes you think right
[55:12] sister Gail and that brother they ask
[55:14] you make you make you think I want you
[55:16] to think right I want you to go home and
[55:18] ponder over it see there was one now now
[55:22] he's up to the beginning of where Adam
[55:24] and Eve is standing together not Adam
[55:27] with Eve Adam and Eve is standing
[55:30] together now you have exactly what Jesus
[55:33] was
[55:36] saying cuz he's really referring to the
[55:40] two of them standing there when he says
[55:43] go back to the
[55:44] beginning
[55:47] right and you see that in the beginning
[55:49] when it was Eve and Adam as one there
[55:51] was no fall when it was Adam and Eve
[55:55] standing together as one you know and
[55:57] and put together as two people two
[55:59] identities there no fall that's
[56:01] right right yeah but he's got the dirty
[56:05] one over there that can make it come to
[56:08] Pi that's why she's a
[56:13] hamburger
[56:15] yeah that
[56:18] way she is a
[56:23] byproduct
[56:25] when she was standing there beside of
[56:27] Adam she was a byproduct that's
[56:30] right come on you're the byproduct of
[56:32] your mom and daddy and little kids you
[56:35] holding is a byproduct you
[56:39] reproduced come
[56:41] on right what was Eve give to Adam
[56:48] far to reproduce
[56:51] Adam what's a wife giving to a husband
[56:53] for right
[56:55] my kids are not mcil cutties they're all
[56:58] dals you
[57:02] know you you get the
[57:06] point in the beginning was running in
[57:08] perfect order and harmony with God
[57:10] nothing was out of
[57:12] cater nothing was out of cater Adam and
[57:15] Eve in the garden how long no problem
[57:18] don't have to worry about
[57:23] it all right
[57:27] what does she turn out to be
[57:30] then watch this going up to paragraph
[57:35] 101 I've cut some of these put extra
[57:37] numbers on them where we and I just cut
[57:39] it out to where I want to point because
[57:41] some of the things that's in it will be
[57:43] relating to other things that we'll get
[57:45] to later this is paragraph 101 notice
[57:48] why did she do such a
[57:51] thing look at it read it be being in
[57:55] that high
[57:59] order how much higher could she have
[58:04] been than the way God made
[58:09] her I'm hoping this is going to do away
[58:11] with some of your byproduct
[58:21] ideas being in that high order
[58:25] there's not a higher order in the world
[58:27] than to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:30] right you sisters should consider that
[58:33] there's no higher position that you
[58:36] could want to be in than to be the wife
[58:39] of your
[58:41] husband you should consider
[58:45] that and say thank you Lord for giving
[58:47] me that head I
[58:51] got instead of trying to be over him
[58:56] right right right come
[58:59] on I'm smarter so was
[59:02] he
[59:04] yes that's right now you got a problem
[59:08] that's
[59:10] right yeah but my husband he just a
[59:12] dummy he don't understand well
[59:16] maybe you still your head amen so you
[59:20] just admitted your head's a
[59:23] dummy or you're trying to overrule him
[59:28] one see that's why we can stay six
[59:30] months on one
[59:33] topic why did she do such a thing being
[59:35] in that high order she was right there
[59:38] with
[59:40] him
[59:44] co-equal now where's he any sin
[59:51] there where is there
[59:53] any part of her
[1:00:00] creation are you with me yes where's any
[1:00:04] part of her creation that would have
[1:00:06] been
[1:00:12] sinful she was go equal with him
[1:00:15] y but we all know now that she lost her
[1:00:19] co-equal with
[1:00:21] man when she sinned and God said man
[1:00:24] will be your ruler from here out he said
[1:00:27] that's the
[1:00:28] scriptures but she was
[1:00:32] co-equal
[1:00:36] amen I know a little bit about the
[1:00:38] message so remember just on down a few
[1:00:40] paragraphs before after that brother R
[1:00:43] says Satan is coequal with God in the
[1:00:48] beginning but what was Satan coequal to
[1:00:50] God he couldn't create that was one
[1:00:52] thing he couldn't do but he got all kind
[1:00:54] of gift he's got all signs and wonders
[1:00:55] but he's even co-equal you see Eve would
[1:00:58] have been a whole lot
[1:01:01] closer as to being
[1:01:04] co-equal okay going down to paragraph
[1:01:10] 105 notice the reason she did this she
[1:01:14] was not in the original
[1:01:18] creation she is not in God's original
[1:01:21] creation she's a
[1:01:23] byproduct
[1:01:26] boy that's it that's that's it right
[1:01:28] there says therefore at the beginning
[1:01:31] when Jesus referred to it she was not
[1:01:33] original created it was not original
[1:01:36] created being of
[1:01:40] God she is a byproduct of a man when
[1:01:44] Jesus referred to the
[1:01:47] beginning now is he saying that Adam is
[1:01:51] her
[1:01:52] Creator not
[1:01:54] quiet don't go
[1:01:58] carnal when you read a man and he's
[1:02:00] talking he's just like you talk we run a
[1:02:03] lot of words what do we mean Adam wasn't
[1:02:07] her Creator he said that Jesus refer she
[1:02:10] was not original created being of God
[1:02:13] what's he
[1:02:15] meaning who created her the devil did
[1:02:20] now I didn't know he was a Creator I
[1:02:21] thought that got out the door a long
[1:02:23] time ago
[1:02:27] what's he
[1:02:28] emphasizing right that she was not in
[1:02:31] the original creation that's
[1:02:35] right all the animals come male female
[1:02:38] male female male female but when you
[1:02:40] come down to Eve she was in Adam she was
[1:02:43] not an original identity standing there
[1:02:46] but then she's taken from Adam that
[1:02:49] makes her a
[1:02:50] byproduct there's no
[1:02:53] sin
[1:02:56] where's the
[1:02:59] problem I'll emphasize this again
[1:03:01] remember the two Creations that we
[1:03:03] speaking of or the two Beginnings or
[1:03:05] whatever you want to go back to when
[1:03:06] Jesus referred to the beginning so in
[1:03:08] the beginning there was a time that even
[1:03:10] that Eve only existed in Adam and that
[1:03:13] was in the beginning of the Creations
[1:03:15] back there she was created in
[1:03:17] Adam right right but then she was taken
[1:03:20] from Adam now you got another beginning
[1:03:23] that's the beginning I read you back
[1:03:24] this paragraph before we talking about
[1:03:26] that brother brandom is talking about
[1:03:27] the beginning
[1:03:30] right God Jesus when he was saying he
[1:03:33] was referring to the beginning when they
[1:03:35] were made male and female two
[1:03:41] people that's the way it should have
[1:03:43] stayed was not supposed to been anything
[1:03:46] else was supposed to stayed on that
[1:03:53] ground
[1:03:55] see this is the one everybody loves to
[1:03:57] read though go ahead with number
[1:04:01] 11 let's see what I do I got 10 though
[1:04:04] where am I at I done lost one of my
[1:04:07] quotes pull up 10 okay he's got it I
[1:04:11] don't even have it I left it l in
[1:04:14] y questions and answers on Hebrews 1957
[1:04:18] 103 look what the prophet is talking
[1:04:20] about a tree reproduces itself
[1:04:22] vegetation reproduced
[1:04:24] animals reproduce them humans reproduce
[1:04:27] themselves they are the byproduct
[1:04:29] of original creation did you get
[1:04:34] it they're a byproduct you're a
[1:04:36] byproduct to your mom and daddy so
[1:04:38] there's not anything wrong with being a
[1:04:44] byproduct there not anything wrong with
[1:04:46] being a byproduct all right go ahead
[1:04:48] with number
[1:04:53] 11 now I hope I can get this
[1:04:55] fast marriage and divorce paragraph 106
[1:04:58] and one down to
[1:05:00] 108 remember Adam was both masculine and
[1:05:02] feminist in the original
[1:05:04] creation one but then he was separated
[1:05:08] by rib okay now you coming out notice
[1:05:11] but a byproduct
[1:05:12] she there he wasn't Eve wasn't a
[1:05:15] byproduct when she was in Adam is
[1:05:17] everybody follow her that then when she
[1:05:20] comes out she's a byproduct and notice
[1:05:23] the only one of all only one of all
[1:05:26] God's creation of every animal and
[1:05:28] everything else she was the only one
[1:05:29] designed this
[1:05:32] way now what's your interpretation there
[1:05:35] she was designed
[1:05:42] wrong that's not what he's
[1:05:46] explaining he's explaining she was the
[1:05:49] only one that was designed that way
[1:05:52] right what as a a
[1:05:56] byproduct now you're going to make him
[1:05:58] take quotes and
[1:06:01] pull only one she was the only one that
[1:06:05] was designed that
[1:06:07] way no other animals nowhere was it
[1:06:10] designed that
[1:06:11] way every other female it was the
[1:06:13] original creation every other female was
[1:06:15] the original creation but he was not in
[1:06:17] the original creation see that had to be
[1:06:20] made that had to be made that way but
[1:06:24] now we agree
[1:06:26] there because the original creation
[1:06:29] couldn't
[1:06:30] fall that's
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:36] so she had to be made away
[1:06:42] right but now be careful how you making
[1:06:45] her come on brother because we just been
[1:06:48] through it and you at least nodded your
[1:06:51] heads that God can't create create
[1:06:54] something wrong that's
[1:06:57] right so if he created
[1:06:59] her in any form of your thinking of
[1:07:04] sexualities or any parts you want to
[1:07:06] bring you're getting to close to making
[1:07:09] God ordaining things that's
[1:07:13] right be real
[1:07:19] careful look at number
[1:07:22] 12
[1:07:26] why some people can't keep the victory
[1:07:28] 1957 324 paragraph 15 or
[1:07:32] E15 now man's on the basis of free
[1:07:35] moral free moral agency and he cannot
[1:07:40] God could not take a man and say God
[1:07:43] could not take a man and
[1:07:46] say now I'm going to make you do
[1:07:52] this I'm going to make you to be to be a
[1:07:55] lost
[1:07:58] man I'm going to make you be a saved
[1:08:02] man he can't do
[1:08:06] that that wouldn't be the nature of God
[1:08:09] no he's not willing that any should
[1:08:10] perish but he wants all to repent but he
[1:08:13] was being infinite as he is he knew from
[1:08:16] the beginning who would be who would
[1:08:17] perish and he would not perish because
[1:08:19] he knew what would be he's not in
[1:08:22] willing in any way what so there for
[1:08:24] what is it he could by forn knowledge he
[1:08:26] can make everything work right according
[1:08:29] to his
[1:08:30] plan amen now God
[1:08:35] knew that if he left Adam standing there
[1:08:38] with Eve inside they would have never
[1:08:39] been a
[1:08:42] fall
[1:08:44] okay but he knew that if he removed Eve
[1:08:47] from
[1:08:49] Adam the fall would
[1:08:52] come because she was not an original
[1:08:56] creation like a dog cats male female
[1:09:02] Etc so he
[1:09:05] knew but because he knew he couldn't
[1:09:08] make it I read it he said he couldn't
[1:09:10] make you lost he couldn't make you saved
[1:09:12] that's right there in front of
[1:09:15] you by his for
[1:09:18] knowledge he knew that if he made Eve
[1:09:21] like she did she'd fall
[1:09:24] but you better consider some things
[1:09:26] along the way that we will get to
[1:09:28] later you hunky boy you you bring a w
[1:09:31] him up there big you know wi he
[1:09:35] could he fell amen that's
[1:09:43] right now we've got a point
[1:09:49] right in his original
[1:09:52] creation
[1:09:56] with Eve in him no fall
[1:09:59] right bring Eve out
[1:10:02] right so now what happened in the
[1:10:12] garden bypassing these but just quoting
[1:10:15] them to you Revelations chapter 4
[1:10:19] paragraph
[1:10:21] 231 two trees s will one is death one is
[1:10:26] life free moral agency God placed the
[1:10:29] first man Adam and Eve right here on
[1:10:31] free moral agency he places you the same
[1:10:34] place right
[1:10:39] amen okay we're in the same
[1:10:43] place we can't blame
[1:10:48] Adam right and wrong was put before him
[1:10:51] right and wrong is put before you and I
[1:10:53] that's right am do you need any more on
[1:10:55] freem moral
[1:11:00] agency all
[1:11:02] right 18
[1:11:08] Till what was it about
[1:11:15] Eve
[1:11:17] that made her be able to
[1:11:22] fall do you notice the phrase made her
[1:11:26] be able to fall I didn't say made her
[1:11:33] fall what made her be able to
[1:11:40] right and that Adam in his original
[1:11:43] condition
[1:11:44] existence he was not able to that's
[1:11:47] right but yet when Eve done what she
[1:11:51] done she produced the product and he
[1:11:54] done the same things she done now come
[1:11:57] on don't get me all twisted up so you
[1:12:01] you you hold on you say what but Adam
[1:12:03] knew what he's doing if he knew what he
[1:12:06] was doing and done it he's got more
[1:12:08] problems than she's
[1:12:12] got so don't run your mind in quotes
[1:12:15] real quick hold on that's why I said
[1:12:18] while ago a lot of you learn not to
[1:12:20] holler and scream because you don't know
[1:12:22] what I'm going to say next
[1:12:24] right so you weighed it out okay
[1:12:30] now what is your
[1:12:32] thought that' be where I'd love to have
[1:12:34] questions and answers and let you stand
[1:12:36] up
[1:12:40] and but remember it's like I told a man
[1:12:42] at work one time he said I want to talk
[1:12:44] to you about the Bible I said go ahead I
[1:12:47] said but now if you cross yourself I'm
[1:12:49] going to raise my hand you know I said I
[1:12:52] want you to talk about about the Bible
[1:12:54] but but I'm going to watch your word I
[1:12:55] want to if you cross
[1:12:57] yourself I don't mean if you're right or
[1:12:59] wrong we're not talking about what
[1:13:01] you're right or wrong about your
[1:13:02] Doctrine but I said if you cross
[1:13:03] yourself I'm going to raise my hand and
[1:13:06] say you done cross yourself you you
[1:13:08] ain't even you ain't even in an
[1:13:11] argument well he said about two words
[1:13:13] and I raised my hand I said we might as
[1:13:15] well forget
[1:13:17] it cuz he'd already crossed himself
[1:13:20] before he got
[1:13:21] started and see that's what most people
[1:13:24] have done they've already crossed theel
[1:13:26] by the preconceived ideas and thoughts
[1:13:28] right that's been injected by the
[1:13:30] preachers and things that's right until
[1:13:33] he brought it to a basis that you
[1:13:35] already have a preconceived thought in
[1:13:37] your
[1:13:39] mind but
[1:13:41] remember if you cross
[1:13:46] yourself you said what do you
[1:13:49] mean I mean if
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:54] think that there was some
[1:13:57] way that Eve was
[1:14:01] made that would have something to do
[1:14:03] with
[1:14:05] her
[1:14:07] um sex allery what's the word for it
[1:14:11] right that's
[1:14:13] good if you think it was some way that
[1:14:15] he made
[1:14:16] her uh
[1:14:19] more
[1:14:22] uh irus in a lot of
[1:14:28] ways see when you get started then I'm
[1:14:30] going to raise my hand and say hold on a
[1:14:32] minute you just crossed
[1:14:34] yourself because it mean God made her
[1:14:37] that
[1:14:39] way but when he gave her one
[1:14:47] thing Adam had it but he never used
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:55] but he gave her one
[1:14:59] thing that made her be able to do what
[1:15:02] she
[1:15:06] done what is
[1:15:11] that what is that that I won't have to
[1:15:13] raise my hand and cross it you say what
[1:15:15] do you cross
[1:15:16] yourself and what is
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:27] see the key is in the way man is
[1:15:35] made when Eve was taken from
[1:15:40] Adam now are we going to go with brother
[1:15:43] brandom or we going to leave him leave
[1:15:44] him out
[1:15:47] see if she was in theophany the same as
[1:15:52] Adam
[1:15:56] if that's
[1:15:59] right then Adam and Eve only had one
[1:16:07] Soul amen
[1:16:10] that's and it was eternal
[1:16:13] yep because he done breathe the breath
[1:16:16] of life into the nostril of Adam and he
[1:16:18] become Blasphemous names go read it Adam
[1:16:22] a and especially into Adam eternal life
[1:16:26] before Eve came out right
[1:16:33] right
[1:16:38] now how is it that a human mortal is
[1:16:48] created he's made in the image of God
[1:16:51] right even in the fall of in the state
[1:16:53] can we go through that amen but what is
[1:16:56] it about man that makes him what he is
[1:16:59] what's the difference in a dog or an
[1:17:01] animal and a human
[1:17:07] being you better get off of some of your
[1:17:10] thoughts I may take five or 10 extra
[1:17:13] minutes off of you but you better get
[1:17:14] off of
[1:17:16] it CU if you're thinking about some way
[1:17:18] in form of sexologies orever what you
[1:17:20] call those big
[1:17:22] words
[1:17:23] then I'll remind
[1:17:25] you that every female animal has
[1:17:37] that
[1:17:40] what but what's the difference in a
[1:17:42] woman and a
[1:17:48] dog dog has her
[1:17:52] desires
[1:17:55] come
[1:17:56] on you want to go fishing with me
[1:18:03] sometime but she only has it for her
[1:18:05] babies right do you need those
[1:18:10] quotes the female dog animal cat horse
[1:18:15] she only has her desires for her babies
[1:18:18] but she has her desires for her
[1:18:21] babies you Tak in the bar Kingdom
[1:18:24] especially the old boy bar a lot of
[1:18:26] times when the baby's born after a
[1:18:28] little while he'll come back and kill
[1:18:30] that
[1:18:31] baby you know that Mama will fight him
[1:18:34] and sometimes they the boy killed her
[1:18:37] fighting over her
[1:18:40] baby but the reason he killed the baby
[1:18:42] is to bring her back into receptiveness
[1:18:45] from him and you know
[1:18:47] what the day she fights him even to
[1:18:49] almost her death but a few weeks later
[1:18:52] she looking him
[1:18:59] up I'm sorry to talk plain but is it
[1:19:09] true Eve was to have reproduced
[1:19:13] Adam now every how you want to go with
[1:19:15] that that's your business
[1:19:19] ain't if you want to make it a creation
[1:19:21] if you want to make it a act if you w
[1:19:23] make anything leave sex out of and
[1:19:24] you're okay because it's not sex in
[1:19:28] animals it's for reproduction
[1:19:35] only what's the difference in a male and
[1:19:38] I mean a a female and a dog the dog is
[1:19:42] only for her puppies but a female for
[1:19:44] anytime
[1:19:47] she
[1:19:51] desires right
[1:19:54] come on is that plain enough but you get
[1:19:55] the point for any time that's where
[1:19:59] she's he said well that was where he
[1:20:01] designed
[1:20:03] her I want to ask you a question I'll
[1:20:06] leave it down here and I'll just quote
[1:20:10] you did he design
[1:20:13] her for any
[1:20:18] time that she
[1:20:20] wants or did he design her her like all
[1:20:23] the other
[1:20:27] females is it wrong for you sisters to
[1:20:30] want to be a
[1:20:32] mother is not that the purpose of
[1:20:34] getting married and
[1:20:38] Etc that you want to be a
[1:20:42] mother just like the dogs the cats and
[1:20:45] the things you want to be a
[1:20:48] mother
[1:20:51] right see Eve wanted to be a
[1:20:58] mother and she would have finally become
[1:21:01] a mother
[1:21:02] right as I say that's up to you to
[1:21:05] decide which you way I ain't going to
[1:21:06] argue with
[1:21:07] nobody you want to call it creation or
[1:21:09] you want to call it an act with
[1:21:11] Adam David do what you want
[1:21:14] to brother B did say Isaiah and N was
[1:21:17] supposed to come through the wound of
[1:21:18] Eve you can argue all you want to there
[1:21:21] quotes both way I'm not arguing I'm just
[1:21:23] trying to stay to a
[1:21:28] point
[1:21:33] Eve which just like every other
[1:21:45] female what went
[1:21:51] wrong
[1:21:54] so then you can see when she was made
[1:21:55] she was made Body Spirit and
[1:21:59] soul you agree
[1:22:04] amen if you're going with the one sole
[1:22:06] point of the
[1:22:09] theophany then Eve had eternal life in
[1:22:11] her soul just like Adam had eternal life
[1:22:13] in his amen sure or else you're going to
[1:22:17] have to make some statements that don't
[1:22:19] come from the prophet you're going to
[1:22:21] have to say that God made her mortal but
[1:22:26] Adam was
[1:22:29] eternal my hands up you just crossed
[1:22:34] yourself and make him a respector of
[1:22:36] persons and make him doing wrong make
[1:22:37] one one way one the other one come
[1:22:42] on but see by ba being not a dog or a
[1:22:46] cat what's the difference in the dog or
[1:22:48] cat and a mortal and a
[1:22:51] woman
[1:22:54] they both have the desires for their
[1:22:56] babies they both want to be
[1:22:59] mothers nothing wrong with
[1:23:05] that if Satan had an had not entered the
[1:23:10] picture what would happen in the
[1:23:15] garden don't you think that we would
[1:23:18] have come forth you know yes sir amen
[1:23:21] some way
[1:23:23] okay cuzz that was the would be the
[1:23:27] part then we could be a byproduct of Mom
[1:23:31] and
[1:23:32] Daddy but you see what Eve done was the
[1:23:35] one thing that you and I do that you're
[1:23:38] doing right
[1:23:43] now you are sitting there right
[1:23:46] now trying to reason out what I'm
[1:23:49] thinking
[1:23:51] about
[1:23:54] right you're trying to reason out what
[1:23:57] is he going to
[1:24:02] say see that's the only thing about Eve
[1:24:04] so when God made Eve he made her body
[1:24:09] spirit and
[1:24:10] soul and by her soul being Eternal with
[1:24:13] Adam she couldn't die in that
[1:24:20] part but she had her body and her spirit
[1:24:23] to deal
[1:24:25] with her motherly nature within
[1:24:29] her would be Desiring to have
[1:24:33] children offsprings from
[1:24:38] Adam would see what Satan
[1:24:44] done that's what you give Adam and Eve
[1:24:47] in the garden to defeat the
[1:24:50] enemy he's talking about the spirit of
[1:24:52] God
[1:24:56] he said that's what you give them was
[1:24:57] the spirit of God to defeat the enemy
[1:24:59] and when Eve reasoned with
[1:25:01] it and projected reasons with the word
[1:25:06] it fell apart and sin
[1:25:11] entered it's taken from
[1:25:15] identifications
[1:25:20] 1963 there was a time when there was no
[1:25:23] death on Earth there was a time when man
[1:25:25] didn't have to die but because that Eve
[1:25:29] reasoned listen to Satan's reasoning
[1:25:32] against God's word death begin to rain
[1:25:34] from that time on and it rains yet today
[1:25:38] but let me say this in the face of it up
[1:25:41] there is a time and a thing that can
[1:25:43] happen that will never change it's
[1:25:48] Eternal so we'll byp pass just a minute
[1:25:51] or two and think on
[1:25:55] Eve began to
[1:25:57] reason reasoning is what part of
[1:26:01] you body is see taste feel smell and
[1:26:05] hear spirit is reasoning memory
[1:26:08] conscience affections Etc
[1:26:13] right Eve was okay until she let till
[1:26:16] she stopped to listen to Satan and his
[1:26:20] reasoning and when she did
[1:26:23] y there is sin remember we read while
[1:26:27] ago adultery drinking gambling smoking
[1:26:30] Etc even the prophet would say adultery
[1:26:32] when he said eve committed
[1:26:34] adultery because Adam was her
[1:26:37] husband and she took another one with
[1:26:39] the
[1:26:46] Beast and when it
[1:26:49] did she began to reason
[1:26:54] reasoning is the product of
[1:26:59] sin now unless you say come let us
[1:27:01] reason together that's perfect all
[1:27:03] right but do you see what Eve happened
[1:27:06] do you see where she was not made any
[1:27:11] different the only thing that she was
[1:27:13] brought over into a
[1:27:17] position to where she could
[1:27:21] reason
[1:27:22] now I ask you a
[1:27:25] question what happened to Adam
[1:27:35] right that was Adam the animals in the
[1:27:38] garden were reproducing the Beast could
[1:27:41] tell Eve look what you're
[1:27:48] missing you're missing
[1:27:51] motherhood
[1:27:52] you know the longing in your
[1:27:55] heart and she began to
[1:27:59] reason but when she fell she went to
[1:28:02] Adam and Adam looked and said my wife I
[1:28:06] love
[1:28:07] her I don't want her to die she'd have
[1:28:10] died right there if he had left her
[1:28:13] alone he began to
[1:28:17] reason and his reasoning was I'll go out
[1:28:21] you want me to quote brother around him
[1:28:22] I'll go out of the garden with her and
[1:28:25] I'll bring her back he said but that was
[1:28:28] where his problem was when he went out
[1:28:30] of the garden he couldn't get back right
[1:28:33] right amen
[1:28:35] amen what would he have created some
[1:28:37] kind of a
[1:28:38] lustful point that would make God the
[1:28:41] product of it give her the same thing as
[1:28:43] all the other animals had that's right
[1:28:47] that he didn't call it sin and still
[1:28:48] don't call it
[1:28:50] sin for dog dos and cats and things are
[1:28:57] reproduce she begin to
[1:29:02] reason and the reason is what killed
[1:29:06] her that's what's killing you and
[1:29:10] I
[1:29:13] reasoning I want to ask you a question
[1:29:15] it'll be about 3 months down the road
[1:29:17] but I want to ask you a
[1:29:20] question after what happened in the
[1:29:29] garden polygamy came into being
[1:29:34] right am I
[1:29:39] right I want you to explain that to
[1:29:43] me how did the fall of Man make the
[1:29:48] animals get into
[1:29:50] polygamy
[1:29:55] you see there is a lot of
[1:29:58] answers but I got a lot of
[1:30:04] questions polygamy easily seen in a
[1:30:07] family human race cuz you get over a
[1:30:09] little while and one guy had two
[1:30:14] wives but how come the
[1:30:20] animals when into
[1:30:23] one buck and many
[1:30:28] do but to get you off the hook there are
[1:30:30] some animals that mate for life that's
[1:30:33] right now they mate as long as that
[1:30:35] mate's living but when that mate dies
[1:30:37] they'll find them another mate so
[1:30:38] they're still under the
[1:30:43] problem some animals that don't even
[1:30:45] fool with
[1:30:47] polygamy they'll die
[1:30:50] first but as
[1:30:54] humans what are
[1:30:58] we you see what I'm talking about yes
[1:31:01] how was Eve created wrong she wasn't she
[1:31:04] was created a mortal
[1:31:06] being perfect in Body Spirit and
[1:31:10] soul your little babies let's stand your
[1:31:14] little babies when they're born they're
[1:31:16] perfect right I didn't say Eternal never
[1:31:18] had no word for
[1:31:20] it that's all right just wait will it's
[1:31:24] done too late for the music just
[1:31:29] wait little
[1:31:33] animals why would they get under a fall
[1:31:40] right think on these
[1:31:45] things Eve begin to
[1:31:49] reason you ever heard run around and say
[1:31:51] Eve said I think he said that's where
[1:31:53] she messed
[1:31:56] up she just got add them to
[1:31:59] thinking and he messed
[1:32:03] up you see God knew it was going to take
[1:32:05] place right he didn't have to create
[1:32:08] products for Adam and Eve after the fall
[1:32:10] to bring
[1:32:13] families you understand my
[1:32:18] wording they were standing there with
[1:32:21] everything
[1:32:23] perfect a little baby when it's born
[1:32:25] it's perfect why cuz God can't create
[1:32:27] something imperfect it's not talking
[1:32:30] about it can be sick the second it's
[1:32:31] born that's not what I'm talking about
[1:32:33] I'm talking about how God created it he
[1:32:35] created it
[1:32:37] perfect think on these
[1:32:40] things father we ask you to just go with
[1:32:42] us now yes Lord we go eat a natural meal
[1:32:45] bring us back together in you and Lord
[1:32:47] just give us that understanding because
[1:32:49] there is where we have to rest upon we
[1:32:51] love
[1:32:52] you and we thank
[1:32:54] you in Jesus name amen you dismissed
[1:32:59] take the name of
[1:33:19] Jesus brother
