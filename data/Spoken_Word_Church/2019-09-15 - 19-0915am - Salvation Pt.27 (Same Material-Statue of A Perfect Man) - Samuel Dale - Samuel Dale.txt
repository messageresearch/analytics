«  71       †        Now ask God to... while we're talking on Revelation, ask Him to give you a revelation of This. For It can only be known by revelation, and you can only be saved by revelation. You have a knowledge of It, intellectually, but you can't be saved until It's revealed to you. "No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost." That's what the Bible says. No man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost. He might say, "The pastor says so, the Bible says so." Them are truths. "The church says so." That is true. But you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed It to you, and He's become in you. "No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost." Not by knowledge, not by intellectual.

«  98       †          That virgin birth was a mystery to the people, they couldn't understand it, just like the new Birth is today. The new Birth is a mystery to the people. They can't understand it. They don't know what you mean. They have belittled it, bring it down, saying, "Well, just because you believe something." The devils believe the same thing, and tremble. It isn't what you believe; it's what God has actually done. The new Birth is a birth. It was a new. It was a paradox, when God brought new Life to the human race. To reject it, is Eternal separation. To receive it, is Eternal Life. You have...

«  233       †          Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of the revelation. See? Christ's Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to ...

reverse 15 through 18 he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am never back up before you know where they're coming through and ask him that's the son of man who is it and all he said but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and let's go over to 2nd Peter 1 Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtually now how does it come through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by the ease you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've spent some time and trying to get everything right in order to say what we want to about the stature of a perfect man but I hope that you'll understand one thing I want to drive this into your thinking to remember that the stature of a perfect man is what it is it's the stature it's the growth of a Christian it's it's what you know you you are born again by faith in God and then it keeps unfolding it keeps unfolding and unfolding until it comes forth to bring forth these virtues into the life of a Christian to make us what God wants us to be all right now then we'll get back to these things only but I want you two to think on one thing right here to start with to me now I have to look at things and follow it the way the Prophet is brought it and he said in the statue of a perfect man he says now you're adding these things will get back and review it but I won't this thought in your mind now if you're adding these things one to the other as we will go forth and you know speak on the things all right just remember the Prophet said now it's not that you know a woman receives the seed and and she has a baby and cities it's formed in her wound but said it's not the cell of a dog in the cell of a cat and the cell of a you know an animal it's the one cell multiplied you know and made forth all right the stature of a perfect man then you look this into your mind so think it deep and think on it that these virtues are all the same material all right it's not this material no more than it would be the material of a dog on a cat or you know to bring forth into a body it's all the same material because it will not vulcanize unless it is the same material now you remember that for the Statue of a perfect man I've asked you to read it and if you will go on and read blasphemous names which was about three or four months later and you'll see a lot of things in there that will go together and help us to understand but follow that point now in Wilden then you'll see what we're driving so hard at it's not the material of a horse and a cow makes a dog we've got enough sense to know that's not true all right now so in the body of Christ it's word upon word is what builds the body of Christ and if we're talking about the statue of a perfect man then it'll be word added to word it's the same material see that's why when we get to the point of seeing how that we get these virtues that will be a very valuable point to remember that each one of these virtues is the same material it's the Holy Ghost working in us to bring forth His divine nature and bring it to a position so don't lose that now as we go along and we talk about something we try to nail it down about faith we've been on that for quite a while just remember faith is a revelation all right so the statute of perfect man is gonna have to be built on Revelation that's why we read in Matthew where it says the gates of Hell shall not prevail against this what the body of Christ is built by the opening of the word or not now in being the opening of the word see as it opens its word upon word word upon word until we come to the full stature of Jesus Christ full growth all right so now whatever we talk about whatever you see faith to be you know if you can get that point to understand what faith really is then it'll be easy to be able to say add virtue because it's the same material all right it's not a different material it's the same material added to it virtue then knowledge will be the son material temperance patience godliness it'll all be the same material okay so you're not having to try to figure out it so if you just never find out what faith really is and get that in your in your understanding then you'll see what these virtues really are this is adding faith - faith - faith - faith are revelation - revelation right opening of God's Word to each one of us now all right you got that point hold that in mind that remember we're talking about these virtues whether it's faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness it's all the same material because it has to be vulcanized together and it has to be the same material to do that you can't as it probably said you can't vulcanize iron or metal - rubber he said that won't work well then let's don't try to say well well we got the new bird here but we get up here like they've told you it was taught many years ago and still being talked specially in the foreign fields about that you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost until you get up to where it says headstone well what is your base material then I'm asking you that question if you're saying that's where it's got to be you've got to have this then what is your base material what is your foundation right what is your foundation and the foundation of all Christianity is faith in the Word of God see then it's very simple if we follow it correctly if not then we'll try to make this to be one thing and this is something else over here we need virtue so we'll have virtue all you need is just to do what the Prophet said What did he say about the thing that we need to do more than anything pray read your Bible right wanna pray read you Bible okay in the Statue of a perfect man will mention as we're going along he says you get this lined up and correct he said it'll be automatically added now I've tried to explain this years ago and listen to the point there's a difference between automatically adding and adding automatically you know alright thank women now there's a difference between something if it's something that's within us and working and then it will be that district the more of that one over the other and you'll see what I'm talking about that it will be automatically added one because it's the same material but don't say it's going to be added automatically well I don't have to worry about nothing cuz it's gonna it's gonna be added automatically yeah it's gonna be added automatically all I need to do is get born again well that's a good start but now what are you gonna do from their own no is not that where the Prophet said to Pentecostals cabbage down upon the point that they believe they got it at faith and stood on that is not basically all of your religious believing based upon just one point or thought you know where you say bad this one I said we believe message this what we shout it a little bit and you try to make it different things when it's the same point that's that's the point now I want you two to stay with me on and keep that in your mind okay alright so now the Prophet says that my vision I can go ahead and pull up number one if you want to that you cannot be saved without a revelation now are we going to believe him or what we think or what somebody else things we could at least depend upon that point all right well brother Dale I didn't get no revelations when I got born again sorry maybe you didn't get born again well you hurting my feelings you're saying I'm not saved if you're not saved then you need your feelings hurt where you'll do something about it right well I've always depended on that one let's water see each Church you go as the Prophet says you go to each church and ask them and that's from what does it mean to be saved he said they'll each one give you a different form or thoughts but remember there's a difference between a revelation a revelation is a substance there's a difference between that then what you're you go through the the shouting the crime everybody thinks he will brother dealt against these things I believe in more emotional situations than any of you in this building I've always told you that I may not act like it but I don't have to put nothing on I am the saint you know all right cuz I believe it but are we gonna believe what he says now are we gonna tell you what we say you have a brother Dale I didn't get no revelation all I done was shouted well I didn't get no revelation all I doing was cried see you're talking about the manifestation of something not the very product itself there's nobody against any emotional situation I've gotten a couple in here this is a brought for that purpose we've brought around said a a dead baby a dead still baby this is no life so what did he say you do you take the baby in you spank it and it comes alive right what because it needs that shock all right but he said a dead baby is just a dead baby he said that's what we've done we've belittled he said the new birth we've made it to be something that it's not you said I spoke in tongue all right praise God but that's not to birth the the birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you wait till in just a minute when we read one where the Prophet says the new birth is a mystery oh all right so let's read while we're talking on revelation this is from the patmans vision we've read this over and over and over and over but we'll keep reading it over and over and over okay ask him to give you a revelation of this all right for it can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation but I didn't get the revelation brother there that's why I believe the new birth the way I do it can be a instantaneous point as we've tried to explain to you the house of Canisius when they heard the word the Holy Ghost fell on them the three thousand there at Pentecost when they heard the word the Holy Ghost fell on them right but the disciples was three and a half years before they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean anything to you it's only to me is trying to explain to one person that maybe a quick instantaneous point I believe in no son but to another one sitting beside of you it may be a long process I've told you my experience I was 2 years in this message before I'd confess the baptism of the Holy Ghost will you come into the message then that's what I've been told that by preachers well you've come in the message did you believe the message I feel yeah I believe it a whole lot more than you think I said I've read and studied this message more than you ever even thought about reading but I said that's not the new birth that's an aftereffect the baby cries after its birth right the shock the well the way you teach the new birth brother they're my kids can't understand that well what's the problem have you ever tried to explain it to come on have you ever tried to explain to your children how they need what salvation really is now I'm gonna make you that much matter the reason you don't try to explain to your children what the new birth is it because you don't know what it is you're making it something that it's not you're making it speaking in tongues out and crying doing this that or the other instead of making it what's your profit just say it you can only be saved by revelation upon this rock Matthew I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against you the church is built on a revelation a revelation of what now come on let's build on the revelation of Jesus Christ is that the way the Prophet explains it he says now the the one group says it's it's built on on Jesus the other group said it's built on Peter he said but now let me stand there with and say neither one that's right he said it's built on the revelation of Jesus Christ right don't look what he's saying you can only be saved by revelation he said well well I don't like what well he's the one you claim to be the prophet are you gonna believe what he says well you're misinterpret this interpreted somebody get up and read this I'll be glad to sit down is there any plainer than one thing you can only be known you can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation now watch him you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you now that's what he said I'm not trying to interpret that I'm trying to read what he said look no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost now you know where we use the other week 10 or so quotes from it you can only it can only be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can you know that Jesus is the Christ now remember anointed ones can be anointed but what do they like the anointing is the same come on but what if they're known and ones what are they missing the revelation they've got the spirit they've got the anointing and we'll read one in a minute where the Prophet said said you come in this in stature of a perfect man you folks have been reading the book where he says you come to a great experience of sanctification he said but that's not in it well I I just don't understand coda I've never had a revelation well are you admitting that you're not saying no well praise God what are you going to deny what he said come on no man can Cochise the cross the only by the old ago that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost he might say the pastor says so the Bible says so then we're truth the church says so that is true but you don't know it yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in new if you come to me today and you say brother Dale I want to be saved would you pray for me to be safe let's say well let's sit down and talk about this thing for a little bit are you wanting to be saved or you want to shout speak in tongues or what do you want to do well I want an experience all right I believe in experience I believe in the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe ever born-again believer that has ever been born again had the same experience now there's what goes hard on the grain in it yeah but I remember losing don't if the baby's gonna that's after-effects the new birth is the same no matter what age or what time it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally - you will see all you can remember is to the experience you've had of of the emotional situation you don't think about what you really ought to think about you realize being brought into this message I try to think about that being my new birth then anything else I could experience then I'm back on their side of it saying well well I I believe the message you know it's right means I got the Holy Ghost well that's a good example because you can only believe it by the baptism with old ago other that's your make-believe go ahead to number two and watch what he says that was from the Patmos vision this is from a paradox 1963 801 they look that virgin birth was a mystery to the people right they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people I thought a mystery was a previously hidden truth I'm trying to paraphrase the wording of it the Prophet used with the previously hidden truth that once it's made known to you it's part of you their mystery the new birth is a mystery that's what he's just saying well I don't get no mystery see that's what it goes back to ah I didn't get no revelation brother branham what is the new birth will you read it just a second this revelation Jesus Christ personally to you yeah but you're doing away with ever experience that I've ever thought about I'm not doing away with no experience I'm putting experience in a great wonderful place a dead baby doesn't have an experience you've got to spank it to get the experience to take place right a stillborn baby I know the prophets using that and it's hard to understand because he uses the word stillborn or it's dead and see then he says it needs to spanking to bring it forward to shock it into life so then it's not dead like we thought well if you're scared you don't need to do anything with it if dead it just means in that situation the breath of life has not introduced the body and it needs help right well look what he says the new birth is a mystery to the people they can't understand it they don't know what you mean they have belittled it bringing it down saying well just because you believe something don't believe in something is not a new birth that's an aftereffect right that something has happened because of your believing the devil believe the same thing in tremble it isn't what you believe is what God has actually done now the new birth is something that God has done some history I don't understand now they leave that back up here with it I don't understand how they can be a virgin birth I like the way the Prophet explains things don't you he says a whole lot easier to understand the virgin birth than it is the natural birth right because the virgin birth God created egg germ whatever placed it in the womb nars the virgin birth nothing with mankind uh-huh it's the virgin birth all right then it's so much easier to understand that than it is the natural birth cause in the natural birth it's many eggs and many churn and everything's got to be perfectly right to go and do this or where to come out right right this is the new birth it's an easy thing to understand it's a lot more easier to understand in the natural birth right God comes in and cleans out the vessel cleans it sanctified and puts his own life in it now how much more simple can the new birth be than that very simple isn't it we'll see we don't want to take that we want to lay on something that we've done or haven't done hey where do you say it God is actually done the new birth is what God has done right the new birth is what God has done he cleaned out the vessel he coming within the vessel is what he's done I see go ahead to number three crisis the mystery of God reveal you can bring it down Luc's Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do well we've been over this and we've been over this but do you have the new birth well I know I had to work another I didn't ask you what you've done because in the prophets message we can find the points where he says none of that is the new birth that's the aftereffects just like a baby being born then it cries the crying is not the birth the birth is took place the crying is an aftereffect so what is the new birth well president my children they just let us know because you've never explained to them what it is like I said maybe you can't explain the new birth because maybe you've never had it what is it for something to me that that I'm trying over and over if I have to say the same thing a thousand times for you to finally catch on that the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ and that what happened to you what's the birth of the word now then back to where we started that same material what's virtue the birth of the word what's knowledge the birth of the word what is the new birth then you'd say well brother branham what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen not you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different now that takes out everything you could do when he says done something different that takes out everything you can do shouting crying speaking in tongues seeing visions having dreams and see I've told you don't like my experience I know but I told you I saw garden I was 11 years old but I never counted at the new birth you said brother Dale what is your new birth it's the birth of the word because that's what the Prophet said it is that's what Jesus said it was unless you'd be born to him unless you be born from above unless you be born from where I was born from what is it you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules listen but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ pastor priest whatever it might be is Christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon now we're back to the beginning what was the church built upon come on upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell walks a built not on Peter and not on Jesus right on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it's the revelation the church has been built on the gates of hell can't prevail against that it'll try because that's what the brother said see that's gonna try but it it can't prevail what is the new verb then much more simpler could you ask brother Branham what is the new birth he says revelations Jesus Christ personally to you and then what else well now here is where rap okay well brother Dale what book do I need to read to get the revelation of Jesus Christ I mean is any certain book he's certain time that I could read to get the revelation of Jesus Christ yeah there's a book called the Bible and the Bible happens to be what the Word of God well read the Bible and pray is that what the Prophet said you want to get closer to God read your Bible and pray well I still have time to read it understand you reading everything else don't start that stuff with me you know where I stand and just forget that you've got it's not time for everything else look what is the new birth go to Brenda it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you know then what would be the thing that we need to consider more than anything it's to read and study your Bible you know one time I read study the message listened to tapes but see we're soul the human mind is so malfunctioned I guess the best working for something my brother got offended at me one time really got a highly offended because all I said was you I I wish you'd read showing so it's like I said I wish you'd read statue a perfect man you know I said read or listened to a tape he got offended at me you know why because he couldn't read he told it he got offended it I said he ought to read when he couldn't read then what kind of carnality is that I've got a little sense if you can't read you can't read but what do you do in place of reading you listen to tape I have said that what the brother got highly offended that I had apologized to it for what for saying I all he wanted was an excuse to be able to jump on to me I gave him that excuse I apologized that took away his excuse you apologize for telling the truth I'm apologizing many times for trying my best to help people like one brother said one time he said to thank brother Dale he said come and apologize to me for something he said to me he said when he was the one that dug me out of a hole in other words what I said to him dug him out of a hole that he a pit he was going into he said thank the man would come and apologize I didn't apologize for trying to hit him no that's that's that's wrong don't get on those or do not apologize I ain't gonna pologize you're not even knowing what I'm talking about the Bible says there with me the Bible says if we think our brother had fought against us the Prophet said it don't mean he has a fault he said if you think he's gotta fall you need to go straighten it out right I ain't apologizing don't worry about it cuz you're not you you're not thinking about what I'm saying at all I thought we're supposed to be living for others but I hope the whole thing thought the whole part of Christianity but listen what a number four now listen to what your prophet says you can't that can't understand you talking about they can't understand how you can speak in tongues and this can be done at it they can't understand it until that man is born again then when he's born again then he's in line of fellowship because he's a new creation the old suspicious doubting character he was is dead and he's a new creation so you see you don't have to add anything to his now because it automatically be added it'll automatically be added not at it automatically not to the point where like they don't matter what I do or whatever it's gonna be given to me I'm gonna get that anyway call this out tonight now then you know what he's saying he's gonna be automatically added if you get started right and keep taking in what you're doing if the new birth is the birth of the word then what would be the rest of the statue of a perfect man word add it to word under word until you come to the full stature that's over here in the message in just a little while for the Prophet says that in visible union of right across but look notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I've got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it or without faith it's impossible to please God they started off the statue of a perfect man at faith now watch when we pick that up this afternoon okay we're gonna pick that point up this afternoon okay but think with me now the foundation is faith how faith let's see this well - oh no no you're either controlled by faith or doubt you're possessed of one that dominates your life look but first he's got to be faith let me say stay on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is what faith is the substance of things hoped for its you already have it when you have faith cause it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11 faith what is the first thing in the statute of perfect man we're going down through here cuz it in here or the Prophet says how faith and be born again you can't be born again without faith I don't care how much you read go see that's not that's one of those things that we see or like the Prophet would say you know you come to knowledge in the statue of perfume and well I just I just read I need knowledge I'll just get knowledge they said that's not the way it is least the death's-head knowledge then go ahead waiting number five these are still off the stature of a perfect man first you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it well I don't hide under he's trying his best to make me say something but to ride my birth that I had I know I'd born again I know right words that I know come on first you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it you're you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the Word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith all right then after you get faith that's right here faith if they ought to yes then you're just in position of growing you're just in position of growing when you have a revelation of Jesus Christ to you as a new birth is that what he's saying you can't be born again without faith well if you got faith then now that's not human intellectual understanding that's real true revelation there's a difference in in brother Merton let's see how can I do it is in blasphemous name it might be in stature program I know some black penis night well Verteron talks about a lot of people having a portion of these virtues and not even born again right there's good neighbors that live around you right we'll do anything in the world for you right and not even talk about being born again the boy boy it produces faith come on now a lot of people go up Luna now a lot of people go up to the altar and pray and this is from statue of perfect man and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification comes upon them and things then you have a great time get up to the older shouting you go back bless God I got it now what did he say no you just started to the place where you can grow a great experience of sanctification and you come up shouting you remember that Waits priest owner than enough your turn Orton that but I preached on it enough to know one thing over and over what sanctification is the most dangerous stage there is ending it in the new birth process or anything why because it's so deceiving you come forth with its sanctification you get new desires you get new thoughts who get new things you do you stay away from the world you get rid of your drinking your smoking your you get rid of all of those things you stop doing them time you want to go to church you do things you want to become a help to everybody and you're just at sanctification ain't even born again but yet do you think you are well you know I haven't you ever heard people say how many times you said it you say well I would not like I did it if it wasn't something something happened to me now I'm telling you something happened to me well praise God something happen to me and I didn't know anything about this message that's what I used to tell the people you know that they say well will you uh you quit this and you quit that and you don't do this and don't do that and in things and said that means you're born again I said well then I must have been born again forever even heard of the message cuz I didn't drink smoke to run around didn't do nothing doctor was bragging on my wife and all because even when we were when we had a TV when we were in the Baptist Church we monitored our TV and got rid of it real quick not when we heard the message we begin to see the things was wrong she was telling the doctor about it and a lady was just elated to think that people would be that way well why not we were claiming to be Christians you just started to a place where you can grow you just got on the foundation you just laying that sanctification is a good part in that foundation is a faith you're gonna read it there's some sex so don't misunderstand there's worth a little where the things come in this morning we're going to talk about now all right a house this foundation is for what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the Word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation that's why the people couldn't understand brother Branham a lot of you know what I'm talking about is are true that back there into the 70s and the late sixties in the seventies a man was going around preaching that you didn't have the Holy Ghost until you got up to top of the pyramid and got the headstone let's see but around says your foundations fight what would it be if you were having to wait until you get all the way up here that's what a lot of people thinks the reason we're around here now is cause we gotta wait until we get right out here for we didn't get bored again brother so it's Oh tile tile I don't care what someone's hotel and arguing nobody then it in argument I just told it like it is I just sat down with one brother and laid it out said ours were the Prophet said that he met people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like on the day of Pentecost 50 years before him and I said now there you are brother that's the reason and I don't believe what you're saying because the Prophet told it different he thought you're born again at faith if you're not born again at faith how are you gonna get a foundation you realize where you would be if you wait until you could get to the headstone and then you finally find out that's ours my foundation is right up there brother Brennan said the disciples didn't have that headstone yeah oh come on I can quote with you he said the disciples had these virtues right he made the statement of that with any major statement of what he said they didn't have the headstone cuz the headstone hadn't come but you see faith is a revelation a revelation of God's Word to you and I let's see where'd we get to we're on paragraph 134 great experience 132 our sanctification comes upon you and things and you have a great time get up from the altar shouting you go back say bless God I got it no you just started to a place where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet the only thing you done is laid the foundation you just started working on it then come on what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the Word of God that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation now we're gonna pull this point right here and remember what I my point I told you to remember every one of those virtues is the same material cause every one of them is the Word of God that's revealed to you you'll find one of these days we'll get around to it you'll see what I'm talking about you'll see why did it's been so long trying to bring it how do you get those virtues by the word being revealed to you well brother Dale I don't like revelation you know y'all preach on revelation revelation out like that goes to show you don't know what you're talking about did I offend you that goes oh you don't know what I'm talking about I want a revelation don't you I want a revelation more than anything yeah but you just into most CEOs and enema Daniels was it the Prophet preacher is it in the Daniel 70 week's book one of the three books is it in there where brother Brian said if you don't understand this Daniel 70 weeks you ain't gonna understand the sales and thought he said that but how can you get two people to try to get him to study Daniel 70 ways I don't want it because they he says this and he said something looks like different here I've proved that over and over be glad to sit down we take my book and you can have it and over sat down and read it he was so perfect til he mathematically knew exactly what 1977 was and still is what about a man that could come out with a third grade education and he come out and he said making exactly thirty four hundred thirty years and you try to figure that thing out what did you believe in something you go haywire all you got to do do what he said according to Leviticus 25 days Leviticus 25 8 says 77249 49 times seven is thirty four hundred and thirty you know one multiply and see exactly what he's talking about when he said don't you say that I said to write for coming 70 cell no way come on let's get to this point and look we're home going 2-5 a it'd be the next one so you can see I added these things in later but okay 227 put it back down a little okay right there now if you got it like add to your faith if you still blow up incise and fuss and stew and curry on you ain't got no you can't add their clothes it won't add now listen to it how come it won't have how come our ideas our thoughts or opinions won't add to the Word of God cuz it's different material it's different material what I think God means and says is a different material from what he says and means you liked it that way I do what he says and means is right what I say in mean can be my own thoughts and ideas and concept Goforth like that they put a rag around his head eyes and put on to prophesy on will believe that he had temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up incise and fuss and spew and carry on you ain't got no you can't add that cause it won't add C it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron see it won't it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is he and when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him your added to it when your virtue is like his virtue then it'll add to it when your knowledge is like he is so what is it if the foundation of all Christianity is based upon faith if the new birth is the word revealed to you if it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then what would we hunt somewheres else to try to find virtue he said now it's not that kind of virtue to talk about these these things are not what we think they are they're the nature of Almighty God instilled up and into each one of us as he gets on over if you want him I'll be glad to give them to you the invisible union of the Bride of Christ that's my message to you Church you that's a union spiritual union by the word that you that you're dead - these old husbands you're born to new don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're a born-again Christian then that little germ that was predestinated in you it's word coming onward onward onward onward and come into full stature of Christ so what are these virtues the life of Jesus Christ starting at the faith of Jesus Christ then it becomes the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge the temperance the patience it's all in Jesus Christ kotas all the same material do you understand there's no difference in the faith of a born-again believer and the love of the headstone as far as what they are one could be greater than others yes more marvelous and understanding yes but it's the same material so now you see one that I emphatically state and try to drive so hard and been at it and will keep at it and whatever it's just a revelation of Jesus Christ so the headstone is a revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ marriage and divorce is a revelation of Jesus Christ Daniel seventy weeks is a revelation of Jesus Christ the seals is a revelation of Jesus Christ the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right so we don't have to hunt for something different just take what God has given us and let that be a growth development come on brothers let that be a growth development and then when you see the when we get to it this afternoon when you talk about add to your faith then how is that your faith told us what scripture said add to your faith that'll be the same material that's what I was getting out of the way this morning that's the thought to get this point out of the way it's got to be the same material it is the easy to follow it it's just a growth development it's being born again more of the same material just being added in your birth or growing in grace and knowledge is that Scripture is that things add to your faith virtue when what if you don't have faith you can't add virtue right not sensible till you get faith first you get the new bird that's why it's so simple but it says it's a mystery how that God can come down into a human being and live in you and I and give us of his own life his own nature his own ways is on doing to give it to us to live in us to make us his children it's not a hard thing to do well then we're gonna find out it's a very simple thing to add virtue the very simple thing to add knowledge you just got to know what it is but if you realize and keep this thing in mind whatever it is that you're going to add it's going to be the same nature way person being word add it to word this reunion we just read to where it comes out to the stature of Jesus Christ you see why it's been so long the profit off the same now for 50 years you see it's why it's been so long it's because people don't want to listen there's a new birth oh I already got it what I need to listen brother Dale about a new bird I already got it he can't tell me I got it he's never try and tell nobody they didn't have it but I will tell you one thing for certain for you and me if it's not what God says then what we think we've got ain't right that's right if what we think we ain't got we ain't got it so why not do something about it I'd rather spend all of my life searching after God and come find out one day he tell me I've had it all along that did not search after him at all you realized in parents what I'm talking about if we spent our time teaching our children they would know what the new birth is but if we read Greer's Almanac all of these things you know try to get some time well I thought I'll tell you what I've always wondered about if not read Greer's are Manette and God spoke to me lying Gosei didn't think I'll say Jen but angles say did oh there's not according to verse Almanac it's according to the Word
