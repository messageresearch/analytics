[2:26] let's go ahead and get on into the
[2:28] message Matthew chapter 24 verse 25 to
[2:36] 33 let's go ahead to the to the author
[2:42] before we read that we just thank you
[2:45] God for your grace and mercy to us
[2:47] tonight or Jesus we thank you for the
[2:49] word that you've given to us and we want
[2:51] to all of our desires here tonight is to
[2:53] be able to look into the word Lord and
[2:55] to see more of you and see more of the
[2:57] hour that we're living in to see more of
[3:00] who we are Lord and I pray God is night
[3:02] that you'll open up the word to us Lord
[3:04] Jesus to unlock the mysteries that are
[3:07] hidden all that have been veiled for all
[3:09] of these thousands of years
[3:10] and now we can begin to look and see
[3:13] what has been hidden there's been a
[3:15] secret a mystery and now it's been made
[3:18] plain for us Lord Jesus granite Lord you
[3:21] Justin I won't just be your time a waste
[3:24] of time where we just kind of come
[3:26] together and look at one another Lord

[3:47] you that's all of our desire that's my
[3:49] desire Lord maybe even in my heart
[3:52] tonight I could be sitting on the front
[3:53] row and get something for myself Lord
[3:56] that I pray Lord that you'll just be
[3:58] welcome among us tonight we ask in the
[4:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now
[4:04] this I I think it's a kind of a familiar
[4:07] chapter to us Matthew 24 and I want to
[4:12] just take one word out of this little
[4:14] little scripture but we'll just start at
[4:16] 20 verse 25 and kind of read on down
[4:19] behold I have told you before wherefore
[4:24] if they shall say unto you behold is in
[4:26] the desert go not forth behold is in the
[4:31] secret chambers believe it not for the
[4:36] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[4:37] shine up even under the West so shall
[4:39] also the coming of the Son of Man be for
[4:42] wheresoever the carcase is there will
[4:44] the eagle's be gathered together
[4:46] immediately after the tribulation of
[4:48] those days shall the Sun be darkened and
[4:50] the moon shall not give her light and
[4:52] the stars shall fall from heaven and the
[4:54] powers of the heavens shall be shaken
[4:55] and then shall appear the sign of the
[4:58] Son of man in heaven and then shall all
[5:00] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[5:02] shall see the Son of man coming in the
[5:04] clouds of heaven with power and great
[5:05] glory and he shall send His angels with
[5:09] a great sound of a trumpet and they
[5:10] shall gather together his elect from the
[5:12] four winds from one end of heaven to the
[5:14] other now learn a parable of the fig
[5:17] tree when his branch is yet tender and
[5:19] putteth forth leaves you know that
[5:20] summer is nigh
[5:22] so likewise ye when ye shall see all
[5:24] these things know that it is near even
[5:27] at the doors you may be seated
[5:29] the Lord bless his word now maybe just
[5:35] as a little background just to kind of
[5:37] set the stage a lot of those things that
[5:39] we're familiar with and you know some
[5:41] sometimes it kind of gets in our mind
[5:43] that you know the word gives us a
[5:46] warning to not not think that the
[5:48] rapture is way far off
[5:50] you know Paul said a lot of things when
[5:53] he wrote the books that we read in the
[5:55] New Testament about you know there's
[5:57] still a lot to happen that kind of sets
[5:59] the framework back then that there were
[6:02] some still things to come because he
[6:04] knew kind of the framework of what was
[6:05] going to happen and what had to take
[6:07] place but now we're at the time this
[6:10] decision there's a time for all things
[6:12] there's the time to different things
[6:15] that happen an hour we're at the place
[6:17] where the rapture is ready to take place
[6:20] so you know you get you in your head you
[6:22] start thinking well we got to wait many
[6:24] years for the rapture to come and you
[6:28] know we know all the framework of how it
[6:30] has to take place whether Rama said it
[6:31] there but there will be a there could be
[6:33] a little child somewhere that is their
[6:35] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[6:37] Life and they'd have to grow up and come
[6:38] to a point where the gospel could be
[6:40] preached to them they receive it and
[6:42] then keep growing on up to maturity and
[6:44] then because we've all got to come to
[6:46] maturity we've all got to come together
[6:47] and everything has to kind of work into
[6:49] our harmony for it to take place but now
[6:52] you can see you can see where we are by
[6:57] looking at the scripture and seeing what
[7:00] scripture says about the day and the
[7:02] hour that we're living in you know
[7:04] looking at this scripture it says be
[7:07] careful of somebody says he's over here
[7:08] over there because you should be looking
[7:10] at the word to see where he is for the
[7:13] Lightning coming out the east shining
[7:15] even under the West so shall also the
[7:17] coming of the Son of Man be the son of
[7:19] man will will come just as just as
[7:21] brother Brendan's message circle the
[7:22] globe and it went as the message went
[7:24] from the east started off in Jerusalem
[7:26] and went to Greece and England and kept
[7:28] on moving around the world all the way
[7:30] over to the west that's how the coming
[7:32] of the Son of Man be and you can look at
[7:34] the times and
[7:35] see that the son of man the revelation
[7:37] of Christ in his fullness has gone
[7:40] around the world now and this scripture
[7:42] has been fulfilled now it's even going
[7:45] all the way around to this one little
[7:47] nation over in Japan where there's a few
[7:49] that are picking it up and it's going
[7:50] all the way around the world so be real
[7:53] careful when you begin to say in your
[7:55] mind well we've still got a long way off
[7:56] because the scripture is becoming
[7:59] fulfilled in your ears in your sight and
[8:03] then that next that next verse it says
[8:05] for were so ever the carcass is there
[8:08] will the eagle's be gathered together
[8:09] and we know how the down through the
[8:12] church ages the four seals the lion ox
[8:15] and man an eagle have been fulfilled and
[8:18] now we're at the eagle time where the
[8:20] Eagle message has been preached and the
[8:23] Eagles and the Eagles have received a
[8:25] message have begun to realize what the
[8:28] message was about and beginning to see
[8:30] themselves in the scripture and
[8:32] beginning to preach I was listening to I
[8:35] like to listen to different ones and
[8:38] maybe that might be ill-advised but I
[8:41] just just kind of sit and listen I feel
[8:45] confident that that you know if
[8:47] something at this point in my journey
[8:49] that I would be able to kind of identify
[8:51] something with a little bit off or
[8:53] whatever but you begin to notice that
[8:55] that different ones are preaching things
[8:58] like ye are God then that and things
[9:01] like and elevated like a capstone
[9:03] revelation and because the bride all
[9:06] around the world is beginning to realize
[9:07] what's taking place we're not in like a
[9:10] little baby floor message anymore
[9:11] although some are some are you know
[9:14] where everyone when you know when you
[9:16] preach there's some that are that are
[9:18] kind of a different level there's a
[9:20] teenagers and moving on up at different
[9:22] levels you know because when you preach
[9:24] there's different audiences as
[9:26] unbelievers make believers real
[9:29] believers different ones that babies
[9:30] children teenagers mature Christians
[9:33] there's ones on the internet all around
[9:35] the world
[9:35] so you're really preaching to a lot of
[9:37] different things but the bride is
[9:41] beginning to catch old to who she is so
[9:43] I wonder you know you maybe maybe take
[9:47] this as a thought could you
[9:50] we think of the rapture as an event a
[9:53] place and it is if there's going to be a
[9:55] place where we step from time on into
[9:58] eternity but the rapture is happening
[10:00] right now
[10:01] so check up with yourself are you
[10:03] missing the rapture because the rapture
[10:06] is when the word begins to open up to
[10:08] you and you know that little Sunday
[10:10] School lesson I was talking about is
[10:11] savour the word savor get a get a
[10:14] revelation of what the word is doing and
[10:16] what is what it can do what it's there
[10:19] for and then give everything that you've
[10:21] got to the word because the word is
[10:24] what's going to take us out of here and
[10:26] if you miss the word if you miss the
[10:28] purpose of what's happening then you
[10:30] could be missing the rapture is my point
[10:34] then reading on on down these 30s
[10:37] digital verses that I just read
[10:39] immediately after the tribulation of
[10:41] those days shall the Sun be darkened the
[10:42] moon shall not give her light and then
[10:44] shall appear the sign of the Son of man
[10:46] in heaven and then shall all the tribes
[10:48] of the earth mourn and they shall see
[10:50] the Son of man coming in the clouds of
[10:52] heaven with power and great glory we
[10:54] know some of these scriptures they're
[10:55] speaking of different events and time
[10:57] and everything but you know we have seen
[10:59] that the cloud come down the picture of
[11:02] the cloud that hangs in many of our
[11:03] houses and we've seen this sign of the
[11:05] Son of man coming we've seen the side
[11:07] we've seen his appearing now I went what
[11:11] maybe to ask have you seen his coming
[11:14] we've seen the appearance of him but
[11:15] have you seen the coming of the Lord is
[11:17] he coming to you the opening of the word
[11:20] and he shall send His angels with a
[11:22] great sound of a trumpet and they shall
[11:23] gather together his elect from the four
[11:25] winds which is what's happening right
[11:28] now from all around the world his elect
[11:30] or being together together you know
[11:32] think about this now because we're in a
[11:35] time now a treacherous time what the
[11:38] Bible says that the teacher the tears
[11:40] will be gathered together and what God
[11:41] does is he separates this and he
[11:43] separates that and he gathers off he
[11:45] starts to bundle these and bundle these
[11:47] together we're in a bundling time where
[11:50] he's bundling everything together in the
[11:51] way that it should be gathering together
[11:53] and he's gathering the Eagles around the
[11:55] word because that's where the Eagles
[11:57] will be gather together around the
[11:58] carcass where the carcass is the
[12:01] fresh kill you'll be gathered together
[12:03] now learn a parable of the fig tree when
[12:07] his branch is yet tender and putteth
[12:08] forth leaves you know that summer is
[12:12] nigh now see there's the other big
[12:15] example of looking at the time and the
[12:18] signs and things to see where we are
[12:20] we're right here at the hour you know
[12:23] brother branham priest years ago about
[12:25] looking at Israel and seeing when the
[12:27] fig tree put forth our bud years ago
[12:29] years ago when they first became a
[12:31] nation and they begin to blossom into a
[12:34] country and begin to make things so that
[12:37] they could harvest water from the air
[12:40] and and and put to just building their
[12:43] economy and now they're in a position in
[12:46] a place where you look over there you
[12:48] see how what else is there to do for
[12:50] them to become a nation what else what
[12:52] else can be left so that's a sign for us
[12:55] when we look over then we see Israel
[12:57] putting forth her buds you know that the
[13:00] time is not something is fixing to take
[13:02] place and I believe that all the bride
[13:06] around the world is getting ready she's
[13:09] more hungry and thirsting than ever I
[13:12] believe now we've heard the word so now
[13:14] is the time that we should be
[13:16] consecrated and dedicating our lives so
[13:19] that the word can be fully made flesh in
[13:22] us so that we give everything this is
[13:24] the time this is not the time to be
[13:26] babying around but this is the time to
[13:29] just fully dedicate your life to the
[13:32] word and then this last verse so
[13:36] likewise ee when you shall see all these
[13:39] things know that it is near even at the
[13:45] door so I want to take for a topic
[13:49] tonight that word doors because you know
[13:54] there's in Scripture there's a lot of
[13:57] doors the whole scripture talks about
[13:59] gates and doors doors in and out doors
[14:02] opening a door shutting doors this way
[14:04] and that way and scripture is full of
[14:07] doors scriptures scripture talks about
[14:10] there's people around the doors there's
[14:12] porters and Watchmen and scare
[14:14] crows outside of the doors to keep you
[14:16] from going in the doors when you go out
[14:18] of a door God wants you to go into
[14:20] another one because doors represent all
[14:23] of these different things that I want to
[14:24] talk about tonight
[14:26] doors represent a transition that he's
[14:28] taking you from one place to another
[14:30] like from one room to another and in
[14:33] your in your journey you're going from
[14:35] this to this to this that he keeps
[14:37] opening a door I maybe want to what on
[14:39] one thing I want to talk about tonight
[14:41] is how do you get a door open because
[14:44] there's a secret if you know how to get
[14:46] the door open then you can keep
[14:48] progressing you can keep moving you come
[14:50] to a door and that's what happened in
[14:52] the old testament they would they would
[14:54] come to the door of the Holy of Holies
[14:55] and they look at see all of these they
[14:57] knew all of these things were these
[14:59] mysteries were back there that they
[15:01] could barely to comprehend they didn't
[15:03] know what it was for they held is the
[15:05] shewbread and all the things in the the
[15:08] tables of stone that they you know they
[15:11] were misinterpreted almost as just
[15:13] something they had to do to keep and
[15:17] they didn't quite understand what it was
[15:18] and they saw that the cherubims on the
[15:20] embroidered on the on the the curtain
[15:24] before the Holy of Holies and all those
[15:26] things but they couldn't get passed in
[15:28] there every now and then and every when
[15:31] that when the right time came when the
[15:33] right season came a feast or whatever
[15:35] all the different things and a priest
[15:37] could go back and taste of the manna
[15:39] once a year the the high priest could go
[15:42] back in there and do the things that he
[15:44] did but it was it was very sporadic it
[15:48] wasn't a continual way you didn't have a
[15:50] continual way to get back into there the
[15:52] Holy of Holies it was shut off from you
[15:54] it was blocked off how do you get in
[15:59] there how do you get into the promises
[16:02] of God how do you get into a door so you
[16:05] know going back to that thought of a
[16:06] transition God wants us to keep moving
[16:09] when we get to a little place in our
[16:11] life don't don't just stop and feel like
[16:14] you're that's where God wants you to be
[16:16] he always wants you to keep moving
[16:17] higher and higher and higher because you
[16:21] you get to a place in your life and
[16:23] there's all to a higher plane
[16:25] keep moving up
[16:26] moving up because you know if we kind of
[16:30] go back to the to the is realized down
[16:33] and easy up how they they they can't
[16:36] they kept moving through like what you
[16:38] would almost call rooms they were down
[16:40] in Egypt and that would be a room they
[16:42] were they were their pilgrimage of
[16:44] slavery and everything and then God took
[16:46] them into that room of the where they
[16:48] had to put the blood over the little of
[16:51] the door and the Death Angel came by and
[16:54] look to see where the life was with
[16:56] whether whether the life was shown the
[16:59] token was on that door and then he kept
[17:01] moving and he said now I'm going to take
[17:02] you from here now I'm going to take you
[17:04] over to the sea to the to the Red Sea
[17:08] and and they stopped there how we going
[17:10] to get across that's when the gods came
[17:14] down to Moses he said why cry speaker
[17:16] and you know all those things just hold
[17:18] your staff out and just keep moving so
[17:20] how did they get across the Red Sea how
[17:23] do they how did that door open up so
[17:25] that they could cross over well it opens
[17:28] up the same way that everything else
[17:29] opens up by faith because that's how you
[17:32] you won't that's the faith is the key to
[17:34] unlock the door and you know brother
[17:36] Bram said in one place I don't think I
[17:38] have this quote but he said you just
[17:39] believe and God will go before you and
[17:42] open up the door you just keep walking
[17:44] in faith believing and God will open up
[17:47] the door and that isn't that how the
[17:48] Israelites did with the Red Sea they
[17:51] just came to the Red Sea and and they
[17:53] believed and kept taking the foot a
[17:55] footstep and just kept marching on
[17:58] looking all around and maybe the whales
[18:00] swimming by everything my goodness but
[18:02] they just kept walking on walking on one
[18:05] step after another and before long and
[18:08] they went from that room into another
[18:11] room now they're in the wilderness but
[18:13] that's not where God wants you to stay
[18:15] either now you're in the wilderness and
[18:17] you've got the manna and all the
[18:19] different things of water coming from
[18:20] the rock but the goal is not to stay
[18:22] there the goal is keep moving and so
[18:27] they came out because because you know
[18:29] the pattern of the scripture is that God
[18:31] doesn't take you out to just just stop
[18:34] right there he takes you out to take you
[18:35] in if you come out and you don't go in
[18:38] then you've missed the whole point
[18:39] so many I feel like it maybe this is a
[18:43] little bit critical but so many have
[18:44] come out of denominations and everything
[18:46] I just kind of sat there in the
[18:48] wilderness we're going around and around
[18:50] and around and haven't fully gone in he
[18:53] doesn't take you out just think Duchess
[18:55] let you sit there but you got to go in
[18:57] so we're going to talk about that
[18:59] tonight how by going in how do you get
[19:01] in how do you get Christ in you so there
[19:05] they are in the wilderness and he takes
[19:06] him from that room he takes him on over
[19:09] ready to go on over into Kadesh Barnea
[19:12] now there's the big test they go from
[19:15] this room to this room to this room
[19:17] that's all right now here we come to
[19:19] Kadesh Barnea and they couldn't keep
[19:23] going on so doors are a transition right
[19:33] they mark off transitions you're moving
[19:37] from this place to this place to this
[19:39] place another thing a room is is a
[19:41] separator because when you go from this
[19:43] room to this room when they crossed over
[19:45] the Red Sea they look back in the
[19:48] Egyptians were gold they were dead the
[19:51] whole army was dead and that's what
[19:53] that's what the when you walk through
[19:55] the door of the new birth that old life
[19:57] is gone it's supposed to be going it
[20:00] needs to be gold if it's not gone go
[20:03] back and examine things a little bit
[20:04] more make sure that you really did go
[20:07] into the other room because you're
[20:10] supposed to look at supposed to separate
[20:11] you're supposed to make you not love the
[20:13] things of the world anymore it's
[20:15] supposed to make you have a different
[20:16] set of friends because the old set of
[20:18] friends used to want to do different
[20:21] kind of things it oscillates you from
[20:23] the other side and you're Jesus even
[20:24] talked about how that how that would
[20:26] make you an odds and ends with you're
[20:29] with your family with your with your
[20:31] mother and your father and your sisters
[20:33] and your brothers and everything because
[20:35] how can two walk together and let's say
[20:37] agree and that's kind of you know but
[20:40] the last sermon that brother Brandon
[20:41] preached was that communion sermon and
[20:42] that's really a lot in that communion
[20:44] sermon how can you really walk together
[20:46] unless you agree there's always going to
[20:48] be a little bit rubbing there
[20:50] thing when you get down and sit to talk
[20:52] with somebody then then you find out
[20:54] whether whether you're really
[20:55] inconvenient or not you know program
[20:57] said that's what communion is it's not a
[20:59] one-sided thing it's two-sided you
[21:02] you're talking and and in in the case of
[21:06] your communion with God God will speak
[21:09] back and we're not talking to just some
[21:11] kind of Idol or something we're talking
[21:13] to something that will speak back and so
[21:16] what do you speak to God you speak his
[21:18] word if you don't know the word then you
[21:20] don't have anything to speak to him you
[21:22] don't have anything to say to him and so
[21:25] that's what's community is a convenient
[21:27] Communion or this door is a separator it
[21:32] says when you go into the Holy of Holies
[21:33] when the high priest every year went
[21:36] into the Holy of Holies that separated
[21:37] him off so much from the rest of the
[21:40] congregation that in the Old Testament
[21:42] they had to put little bells hanging
[21:44] onto him so that they would know whether
[21:45] he was still alive or not
[21:47] because he was separated he was off to
[21:49] his own the light of that that behind
[21:52] that inner veil was what was giving him
[21:53] life so he could see he wasn't going by
[21:56] the light of the Sun of the moon or the
[21:57] things that they could set and rise
[21:59] every day but he had a constant light
[22:01] back in there with the Holy of Holies
[22:03] and that's what it does with a real
[22:05] believer it separates you from the
[22:06] things of the world so that you begin to
[22:08] see the things that are behind that that
[22:11] holy of holies the rod that budded the
[22:13] tables of stone in the side of the ark
[22:15] the manna you have access to all of
[22:17] those things because that's what happens
[22:19] to a seal a concealed life hidden in
[22:22] Christ Jesus it's not a mixture and you
[22:26] know another thing that a door does is
[22:28] that there's a secret in there and a
[22:30] door is like a keeper of secrets and you
[22:34] know brother Branham talked about that
[22:35] three rooms in a house I you have the
[22:37] the the little foyer there and then you
[22:40] go on into the kitchen and then then you
[22:42] go on into the bedroom and I know I know
[22:45] some some maybe even sitting here when I
[22:47] have you over to my house you're
[22:49] reticent or to go back with the brothers
[22:51] sometimes we'll go drink coffee stuff up
[22:53] in my bedroom and we'll sit around and
[22:55] talk about the word as some of you have
[22:57] said before well I don't like going and
[22:59] sitting around in
[23:00] bedroom why because it's a secret place
[23:03] it's a place where it's really just a
[23:05] man and his wife and and to some and you
[23:09] know really I agree what goes on in the
[23:12] bedroom is not supposed to be come out
[23:14] and shared with everybody but it's
[23:16] causes son between a man and his wife
[23:18] it's a secret thing and so what goes on
[23:21] between the bride and the bridegroom is
[23:23] a secret thing it's something that you
[23:25] can't even do you know that you're
[23:27] talking about secret things like that
[23:29] white stone you can't come out and say
[23:31] let me tell you about all the stuff that
[23:33] God has done for me and everything
[23:34] because it's a secret for you it's
[23:37] something that can't be this is not even
[23:39] supposed to be blabbed out to everybody
[23:40] it's a secret and that's what the root
[23:43] the door does it shuts off the secret
[23:46] from the rest of the world so the Royal
[23:47] it's not even for the rest of the world
[23:49] caps not your pearls before swine you're
[23:52] not supposed to be telling everybody
[23:53] about all the things that God has
[23:55] revealed to you because they'll just
[23:57] turn and ring you you tell them tell
[23:59] about the simple things of the gospel
[24:01] and get them convinced that Jesus died
[24:02] for their sins and letting them begin to
[24:05] grow up and begin to see the things that
[24:06] are that are here no secret things in
[24:09] the capstone you can't you can't tell a
[24:11] little baby about what's in the capstone
[24:13] because there's a quote what I said he'd
[24:15] kill them you got to come up the same
[24:18] way the chute is rolling up from a
[24:20] little baby on up up up until they can
[24:23] begin to receive it right and to access
[24:27] the secret you need a key you can't just
[24:31] come up to that door and walk in
[24:33] I presume but you got to have a key
[24:38] what's that key that we were talking
[24:40] about in the Sunday School lesson the
[24:42] key is is what is so misinterpreted and
[24:46] misquoted these days is that they say
[24:49] now the key is will I just believe that
[24:51] God sent a prophet well what did he say
[24:55] what did he say well that's that's
[24:59] fantastic to know that God sent a
[25:01] prophet but he came for a purpose he
[25:03] didn't just come so that we could see a
[25:05] grand show and everything and so they
[25:08] could clown around and everything but he
[25:10] came to deliver a man
[25:12] I wonder if maybe that's how sometimes
[25:15] we're getting off track a little bit of
[25:16] that we look so much at the profit and
[25:19] what he did in the pillar of fire and
[25:21] all those things that we miss what he
[25:23] came to do which is to bring a message
[25:26] and the message was given so that we can
[25:28] eat it like John took the book and ate
[25:31] it and it was bitter in his belly but
[25:33] because he had to live it in
[25:35] he didn't just it wasn't just something
[25:37] that he could read and see a nice little
[25:39] psychology about but it was something
[25:41] that he had to eat and become and
[25:44] sometime that because a little bit
[25:46] bitter that's a little bit hard to do
[25:48] sometimes you're going to suffer just as
[25:51] much separation offenses will come and
[25:56] all of those things and that's what
[25:58] bitter that's what's bitter
[25:59] but the message you was given so that we
[26:02] could receive it and become it I know
[26:05] what the message was about and then you
[26:07] have something to put you in communion
[26:09] with God well you can walk together
[26:11] because you know what the work said that
[26:13] you know who Jesus Christ is and you can
[26:16] see yourself in the word and you know
[26:18] the hour that you're living in and you
[26:20] begin to have an understanding of what's
[26:22] taking place so that's the key I'm
[26:24] talking about the key that unlocks the
[26:26] door is the word faith of the word how
[26:30] can you have faith if you don't have the
[26:32] word you don't even know what's what in
[26:34] the world you believe if you don't have
[26:35] the word of course you got to have faith
[26:38] but you can't have faith without the
[26:39] word I believe God send a prophet or
[26:42] what did he preach excuse me I don't
[26:46] mean to start squawkin so you need to
[26:51] understand I wonder if that kind of
[26:54] shoots over our head sometimes I don't
[26:56] need to understand I don't need to know
[26:57] nothing about the message I just need to
[27:00] I just need to come sit in church you
[27:03] know that's that quote that so often
[27:04] misinterpreted just it is ephesians 4 11
[27:07] and 12 for the perfecting that lady asks
[27:10] the question she said should I listen to
[27:12] taste should I it's what I get perfected
[27:15] in church and Rama answered it because
[27:17] she was she was looking and if I go sit
[27:19] in church am I going to get perfected
[27:21] well the answer is no not if you just
[27:24] come in
[27:24] in church not if you just come sit into
[27:27] a home and listen to tapes either you
[27:29] got to open the door you got to open the
[27:32] door and then you'll be perfected by the
[27:34] blood of Jesus Christ that's what
[27:35] profess you so you need to understand
[27:42] you need to have an understanding of
[27:44] what the word is and then the door will
[27:46] be unlocked Oh Terrence I'm getting
[27:48] close to my my time because in Matthew
[27:54] 16:19 the jesus said I will give unto
[27:57] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[27:59] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[28:02] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[28:04] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[28:06] loosed in heaven the key is to
[28:08] understand let's read that first quote
[28:10] and this isn't necessarily about keys
[28:13] specifically but this is what's getting
[28:15] on getting us on into thy father and he
[28:18] said we'll skip on down to that fourth
[28:21] paragraph in the face of faith of this I
[28:23] love the faith it's going to take more
[28:25] faith than ever was in any age for this
[28:29] has to be rapture in faith to be taken
[28:32] up and so we want you to believe tonight
[28:35] and all that you have seen heard the
[28:38] word that you have preached the signs
[28:40] and wonders that you have seen we want
[28:42] you to accumulate all that together in
[28:45] your heart and consider it whether if
[28:48] that be God or not because you know
[28:51] there's a lot of things you can
[28:52] accumulate you can accumulate things
[28:54] that the work place and although all the
[28:56] knowledge from the world everything you
[28:58] can accumulate complexes you can
[29:00] accumulate all manner of things but what
[29:03] he's talking about this to take a
[29:05] rapture you need to accumulate just
[29:08] gather up to yourself more and more and
[29:12] more words why because the more words
[29:15] you have this is a very simple comforter
[29:19] it's a concept that I'm about to share
[29:20] the more words you have the more faith
[29:24] you will have if it drops from the air
[29:28] down into the are but if it's not in the
[29:31] head there's not even a potential for it
[29:32] to drop down a horse of course it's got
[29:34] to be in your head first
[29:35] that's it because s going to be mrs. 101
[29:38] of course it's got to be in your head
[29:39] first before for it get it off down in
[29:41] your heart I say I don't need any
[29:43] understanding well once this dead
[29:46] brother brother branham just said here
[29:48] we need to be accumulating the word so
[29:50] that we can take because to take a
[29:52] rapture something that has never
[29:54] happened before it's going to take a
[29:56] great a grand amount of faith so to have
[29:59] a grand amount of face that's my word a
[30:01] grand amount a great amount you will
[30:04] need all of this word that has come down
[30:06] to this capstone ministry you'll meet
[30:09] all of that just eat it eat it up until
[30:12] you have that kind of faith and then you
[30:16] won't be confused is that that's that's
[30:18] what's keeping the door shut is our
[30:20] confusion is our confusion we don't we
[30:23] can't we got this one little doctrinal
[30:25] idea over here and another one over here
[30:27] and another one over here and we can't
[30:29] put it all together and so it creates
[30:31] this great big hodgepodge of confusion
[30:34] well we don't know what the word says
[30:36] and when I say we just rhetorically III
[30:40] made maybe believe that bold here I feel
[30:43] like I'm becoming less and less confused
[30:45] about what the Bible says by the grace
[30:46] of God so the word has to fit together
[30:51] into into a grand like like brother
[30:54] Brennan said it Christ is the door then
[30:57] it's like levers in there and the key
[31:00] faith unlock it moves all of those
[31:02] levers and they've all got to move and
[31:04] harmony and everything so that so that
[31:07] the door will open just like a king you
[31:09] put in a regular door it moves all the
[31:13] levers inside inside they're moving it
[31:15] so that the door will open and that's
[31:17] what your faith does you put your faith
[31:19] in the door just as an example I mean
[31:22] really that would almost be a very
[31:24] difficult picture to paint or something
[31:25] that how the door Christ says the door
[31:28] and all these little levers and things I
[31:30] don't know how you would draw that but
[31:31] just kind of a picture of the symbolism
[31:33] that of what's happening when you
[31:35] believe that moves everything so that
[31:38] the door and move it in order so that
[31:40] the door will open so that's how you get
[31:44] access to the mysteries that will give
[31:47] us rapture and faith because
[31:49] we're not called the bride is not called
[31:51] to be ignorant and unlearned we should
[31:54] there is no glory and be it agura and
[31:56] unlearn well I don't know what the
[31:58] Prophet said but I believe him and I
[32:01] want to have the right spirit well if
[32:03] you have the right spirit the right
[32:04] spirit will lead you to the word it
[32:06] would lead and guide you to all truth it
[32:09] would lead you to the word it won't lead
[32:11] you just to being a surreal real sweet
[32:12] person a real condo priest although
[32:15] that's part of it that's part of the
[32:16] picture because we need to have the life
[32:19] expressed the life expressed well where
[32:21] when lovely and kind and brotherly
[32:22] kindness to one another and we put up
[32:24] with one another but there's more to it
[32:26] than just being sweet and everything
[32:28] it's the Word of God being made manifest
[32:31] in you that's bless why I keep going
[32:33] back to the two evidences of faith let
[32:35] me see your revelation if you don't know
[32:37] nothing about the word and how do I know
[32:39] that you even know what it is to be a
[32:40] Christian faith show me your faith and
[32:43] then show me your works show your faith
[32:47] and your works because those two things
[32:49] and you know not necessarily works where
[32:51] everybody's just going around casting
[32:53] out Devils and things but living a godly
[32:55] life like like just sister Hedy right
[32:58] just that's nothing but the truth
[33:00] because when you get confronted in the
[33:03] word the works is expressed you agree
[33:05] with the word you're in communion with a
[33:06] word and it's on display where everybody
[33:09] can see that you are real Christian
[33:11] because you have a revelation of what
[33:12] the word says and you are living it if
[33:15] you're not living it do you really have
[33:17] a revelation of what the word says
[33:19] because a true revelation of who God is
[33:21] will produce the life of Christ in you
[33:23] that's what that's why the word is so
[33:26] important it's not just knowledge it's
[33:28] not just about being an election John
[33:30] not just about no one enough so that you
[33:32] can impress everybody but it's so that
[33:34] the Word of God can be made manifest in
[33:36] your members John 10 790 City on said
[33:43] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[33:45] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[33:49] the Sheep all that ever came before me
[33:51] are thieves and robbers but the Sheep
[33:53] did not hear them I am the door by Me If
[33:57] any man enter in he shall be Schade
[33:59] saved and shall go in and out and fine
[34:02] pasture so you got that we got all these
[34:07] doors giving it going in different
[34:08] directions you got to get into him and
[34:11] in the same way he's got to get in you
[34:16] so you've got a door in you or doors
[34:20] door in doors the doors in door let me
[34:24] get right and he is the door and you've
[34:28] got doors that's why I said at the
[34:30] beginning there's doors all through the
[34:32] scripture doors going everywhere there's
[34:34] open doors down through the sermon seven
[34:36] church stages there's an open door
[34:37] opening Revelation chapter four and
[34:40] we'll get to that in a second so hang on
[34:43] so you got to get into him because it
[34:46] John 14:27 oh that I am in my father and
[34:51] ye and me and I in you if he is the door
[34:56] and you know that we all know the
[34:57] illustration of how in the India and the
[35:00] Middle East and everything over there
[35:01] when they were the shepherd would lay
[35:03] down in the door of the sheepfold so you
[35:06] couldn't get in without the shepherd
[35:09] knowing about it unless you were a thief
[35:11] or a robber and then you got a bigger
[35:13] problem as you're coming in to try to
[35:15] grab the sheep and try to trying to go
[35:17] in some other way than the door but now
[35:19] once you get in the door the Shepherd is
[35:22] there at the door so you can have
[35:25] confidence that nothing is going to
[35:26] happen to you that the shepherd don't
[35:28] want to happen to you now you can't
[35:31] maybe not necessarily say nothing bad is
[35:33] going to happen to you because there are
[35:35] a lot of bad things that happen a long
[35:37] last way that God allows to happen so
[35:40] that you'll grow and become a more
[35:42] mature Christian and one great example I
[35:45] was listening to other day two brother
[35:46] brown telling that's a testimony of how
[35:48] God allowed his wife hope and and Sharon
[35:53] rose to pass away now that that was a
[35:56] very hard part extremely difficult very
[36:00] painful part in his life but it allowed
[36:05] him to grow and and it changed the way
[36:08] from then on he was putting everything
[36:11] on God he was
[36:13] you know he'd never again would even
[36:16] consider saying I'm not going to go with
[36:18] that Pentecost to a bunch of people over
[36:20] there or however was they he explained
[36:22] that situation from then on he was
[36:24] headlong into the going after that group
[36:28] whatever had that group had and so when
[36:31] you get into that sheet fold out the
[36:33] Shepherd's got you he's got you
[36:35] protected your in he's got a like it
[36:37] like joke said i hedge around you and
[36:40] he's watching over you so you should
[36:43] have confidence in that that everything
[36:46] is going to work out in the right way to
[36:49] fulfil his perfect will for you in your
[36:51] life but I want to I kind of got off a
[36:58] little bit right there it took a little
[37:00] detour but going back to the the Christ
[37:03] is the door so when I mentioned earlier
[37:06] that when around a scriptural door
[37:09] you're going to have a lot of different
[37:12] characters a lot of different
[37:13] personalities because whenever God wants
[37:16] to do something whatever he begins to do
[37:18] something then the devil is always
[37:20] watching so you're going to have people
[37:22] on God's side porters and Watchmen and
[37:24] that kind of thing and then on the other
[37:26] side you're going to have people on the
[37:28] devil side it's scarecrows and things
[37:30] people stand in the door not letting
[37:33] others go in and that's where I in this
[37:36] day an hour that that's become the
[37:38] greatest hindrance to people around the
[37:40] message because they've seen scarecrows
[37:42] and so many things have been heard and
[37:44] everything they have been jab and things
[37:48] said that almost you're going to have a
[37:53] limit let me read this brother Brennan
[37:59] was telling about the old old brother
[38:01] Jonas telling his sons Peter and Andrew
[38:04] sitting in the boat before they even
[38:07] knew about Jesus tell them that there's
[38:10] gonna be scarecrows just be aware and
[38:13] don't don't let that get in the way
[38:15] because where there's a false there's
[38:17] also a true that should give you more
[38:19] confidence as that are true to begin
[38:20] with that's going to be stuff along
[38:23] life's way
[38:25] and he's brother did away brother Ram
[38:27] tells us he said my sons
[38:28] come near me he might have said it like
[38:30] this you know we people have looked for
[38:32] a messiah and we know he's coming I'm so
[38:35] longed to see him I thought surely he
[38:36] would come in my generation but it seems
[38:38] like I'm going to go before he comes I'm
[38:41] getting old but my sons don't be
[38:44] disturbed now just before his appearing
[38:47] there's going to be all kinds of
[38:50] fanaticism raised up around him now
[38:54] hadn't been that been true around the
[38:56] message there's been so much fanaticism
[38:58] we know there was so much fanaticism
[39:00] around Martin Luther and so much
[39:02] fanaticism about John Wesley I listened
[39:04] to a little radio show about some of the
[39:05] fanaticism about Martin Luther and I
[39:08] thought I knew about it before but my
[39:10] jaw was dropping after I heard some of
[39:12] the ridiculous things that people did
[39:14] saying that they believed the message of
[39:16] Martin Luther just maybe later I might
[39:20] have a chance to tell you some of it or
[39:22] maybe I send you the link to the little
[39:24] to the little radio show but it's just
[39:26] absolutely ridiculous and that's what's
[39:28] called so many people they see the
[39:31] ridiculousness of it and and then
[39:33] they're there they get diverted away
[39:36] from it but you know the real true
[39:38] believer like when when Jesus begins to
[39:41] tell them about you if you eat my flesh
[39:43] and blood and all those things the real
[39:45] true believer it would everybody else
[39:47] left there were some real true believers
[39:50] that were sticking around and see we're
[39:52] up here we go you got the word and
[39:54] that's what I'm interested in I'm
[39:56] interested in the word no matter what
[39:58] else no matter all the fanaticism and
[40:00] all the things if I have to get beat up
[40:02] and bruised and scarred or whatever to
[40:04] get the word then then let's go ahead
[40:06] and do it so Matthew 23 13 15 Jesus was
[40:11] kind of talking about the things these
[40:14] scarecrows and things around around the
[40:17] door we do it all right
[40:19] four times
[40:23] he said but woe unto you scribes and
[40:26] Pharisees hypocrites for you shut up
[40:29] when we talking about the door now you
[40:31] shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
[40:33] men for you need to go in yourselves
[40:36] neither suffer ye them that are entering
[40:38] to go in and you know brother Branham
[40:41] made many comments about things similar
[40:43] to the scripture and here's one every 7
[40:45] the rejected singing king he said what
[40:47] we need in the capital of this United
[40:49] States as a president what we need in
[40:51] Congress what we need in our halls of
[40:52] justice is a man who have consecrated
[40:55] their lives to God and are filled with
[40:56] the Holy Ghost and are led by His divine
[40:59] direction that's what we need and I all
[41:03] around all across the board is people
[41:05] that have consecrated their lives and
[41:07] given everything over to God but here
[41:09] we've got some that that don't even know
[41:11] like that scripture I was reading Titus
[41:14] 1:10 in Sunday school about there's many
[41:17] that are unlearned and you know Paul was
[41:19] Paul was very frank and straight in the
[41:22] way that he brought it he didn't kind of
[41:23] dilly daddle around he said there's a
[41:25] lot of people here I'm just kind of
[41:27] paraphrasing they don't know what in the
[41:29] world they're talking about and they
[41:31] stand at the door and won't let others
[41:32] go in and because they're standing on
[41:35] the door preaching doctrines of men
[41:37] commandments of man instead of the Word
[41:39] of God there's no way for the people to
[41:41] open the door if you don't have the word
[41:43] you can't open the door that's why false
[41:45] teachers bring false births because
[41:48] there's no there's no word to bring
[41:50] faith it's just fake stuff woe unto you
[41:54] scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you
[41:56] devour widows houses and for a pretence
[42:00] make long prayer therefore ye shall
[42:02] receive the greater damnation now here's
[42:05] some more scarecrows people that are out
[42:08] there for the vanity of their own mind
[42:09] trying to just impress people instead of
[42:11] just being like brother instead of
[42:13] ministers should be a transparent person
[42:15] where you can see right through their
[42:17] life you know what they believe you
[42:18] don't have to ask anybody what they
[42:20] believe because they're preaching it you
[42:21] don't have to ask you to body what how
[42:23] they look if they're a Christian not
[42:24] because they're living in it's just
[42:26] right out there for you to see and
[42:28] brother understands the message
[42:29] influency said we must never get to that
[42:31] place we must always remember that God
[42:33] wants us to be humble
[42:35] the way up is down humble yourself and
[42:37] your exalted and if you exalt yourself
[42:39] you will be brought to a base in other
[42:42] words whatever God wants wants you to do
[42:44] just do it be satisfied with a lot that
[42:47] you have that God has placed you in life
[42:49] don't try to build yourself up with
[42:51] great big prayers and advertising how
[42:53] much money you're given and all those
[42:55] kind of things because all that does is
[42:56] make a stumbling block for people who
[42:58] are trying to go through the door and
[43:00] when you see somebody doing that don't
[43:02] be discouraged because where there's a
[43:04] faith there's a truth that's the
[43:05] greatest evidence that there's a true is
[43:07] a fake
[43:09] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[43:12] hypocrites for you can pass sea and land
[43:13] to make one proselyte and when he has
[43:16] made you make him twofold more the child
[43:18] of Hell than yourselves twofold more
[43:20] because it's coming brother I said in
[43:22] this quote here he said it's you can
[43:24] deal better with a street harlot and
[43:27] then I might add my own statement here
[43:29] I'm not quoting then a person like that
[43:31] he said you can deal better with us
[43:34] prostitute on the street or a drunkard
[43:36] in some dive than you can with some of
[43:39] these old Mossback so-called Christians
[43:42] that's exactly right they set down there
[43:44] and blow up like a toad frog eating
[43:46] buckshot and just carry on awful when
[43:49] they know no more about God and a
[43:51] hunting type news about Egyptian nice
[43:54] and there are twofold more child here
[43:57] because now it'll be twice as hard maybe
[43:59] maybe even more than that to get them to
[44:01] move they will open up the door and
[44:03] listen because there's the head is so
[44:05] stuffed with all of this knowledge and
[44:07] things you see that's that's real tough
[44:09] brother Brown brought it tough brother
[44:11] brother branham laid it out there I
[44:13] think I think sometimes we become too
[44:15] much as sissified Christians too many
[44:17] sissified preachers too many sissified
[44:19] Christians they don't know what they
[44:20] believe in the can run around tallest
[44:23] and we're not supposed to be plants that
[44:25] are raised in a house we're supposed to
[44:26] be able to take the wind and the rain
[44:28] and the storm and because it'll make us
[44:30] grow better it'll harden the hardness up
[44:32] right at the end time evangelism he said
[44:36] and if there's anything that's
[44:38] unrighteous and anything that's ungodly
[44:40] is to take an old Mossback church member
[44:42] that thinks they're so good and they
[44:43] can't see nothing through nothing but
[44:46] their own glasses
[44:49] he said that's the biggest stumbling
[44:51] block the sinner ever had they're
[44:53] expecting them people they call
[44:54] themselves Christians to live a decent
[44:56] life to be a different person that's an
[44:58] example that's a stumbling block that's
[45:00] a hypocrite that's ten times worse off
[45:03] than you ever was you'd be better off to
[45:05] be out there like you were you know all
[45:08] through scripture there's all these
[45:09] examples of these stumbling blocks for
[45:11] the people what may be one of the
[45:13] greatest examples was why did they
[45:14] choose Saul if you go back into the
[45:16] scripture and see why they wanted to
[45:18] elect the King was because that was a
[45:20] stumbling block samuel had two sons and
[45:23] he said well I'm going to make them
[45:24] judges and everything and they they just
[45:27] they weren't even really hypocrites
[45:29] everybody knew that they weren't living
[45:31] the right life they were just out there
[45:33] doing what you know taking the people's
[45:34] money and all kind of stuff and it
[45:36] became a stumbling block for the people
[45:38] there they were sitting in right there
[45:41] in the temple doing the job of the
[45:44] priests and Samuel the prophet Samuel
[45:46] was there dead and yet his two sons who
[45:49] are doing what they supposed to do so
[45:51] they began to think in their head well
[45:53] it'd be better for us to have a key than
[45:56] this I'd rather I'd rather have a king
[45:58] like all the other nations and it became
[46:00] a stumbling block and instead of looking
[46:02] at the Word of God they began to look at
[46:04] their own ideas and that's what that's
[46:06] what I'm getting at when you see all
[46:08] these stumbling blocks and things around
[46:10] don't let it get your mind off God off
[46:13] the Word of God but just keep focused on
[46:15] him that's the way that brother Branham
[46:17] taught us is just keep your eye on him
[46:20] and keep walking and put one step in
[46:22] front of the other
[46:23] and keep walking forward and if you keep
[46:25] your eye on him then he'll take you to
[46:27] the goal
[46:30] so my point around all of that was that
[46:33] Christ is the door and if you're trying
[46:35] to get in the door there's going to be
[46:36] all kind of people around the door
[46:37] people to help you people to hinder you
[46:40] people are a great big economy of
[46:43] commotion around that but ignore all
[46:46] that and just focus on him because
[46:47] within him within that door is
[46:50] everything that we're seeking for and if
[46:52] you can receive the word just get just
[46:54] enough word to be born again and keep
[46:57] moving on we're understanding the key to
[47:00] the door he said there's only
[47:01] one door two-piece and he talked about
[47:03] how you think you piece you have our
[47:05] piece when you have a lot of money and
[47:07] you go home and you lay down your bed at
[47:08] night and you don't have peace you'll
[47:10] find out real quick because the real
[47:12] peace comes from laying down on your bed
[47:14] and knowing that if you were to die
[47:16] right then that you would have a home in
[47:19] Hitler and there's only one door to
[47:23] peace brother branham said he is our
[47:25] healing in other words he's the door to
[47:27] our healing because the scripture says
[47:29] I'm the LORD thy God that heals all of
[47:31] your diseases he is the door to heaven
[47:34] and there's no other door no other way
[47:36] but through Jesus Christ and now Jesus
[47:38] is the door to all these things and
[47:40] faith is the key that unlocks the door
[47:43] now if Jesus is the door to all these
[47:45] promises of God faith in his finished
[47:48] work unlocks every door to every
[47:50] treasure there is inside the kingdom of
[47:52] God see it now see all these things that
[47:55] he was just laying out peace and I'll
[47:57] say joy and long-suffering and and the
[47:59] healing and the door to heaven and all
[48:02] those things that he put in that door
[48:03] you can have access to everything if you
[48:06] only know how to unlock it and you can
[48:08] unlock it as simply as just believe him
[48:11] just believe his word and you know we
[48:14] stumble over the quotes for brother and
[48:15] said you don't have to understand it to
[48:17] believe it
[48:18] just just believe and then God will give
[48:22] you understanding the fool the real
[48:25] revelation understanding and then you'll
[48:28] be able to go back and it will keep
[48:29] building on that keep building and
[48:31] building and you'll have the correct
[48:33] understanding you'll be able to have
[48:35] like brother Branham explain and
[48:37] demonology why demons don't leave you
[48:39] begin to have that understanding why
[48:41] things are hindering the church why
[48:43] things are hindering your own life why
[48:45] wait and as you grow like the in 2nd
[48:48] Peter it says without these virtues you
[48:49] cannot see you far off because I higher
[48:51] up you get it's like climbing a mountain
[48:53] the higher up you get the more you can
[48:55] see the more you understand the more you
[48:58] can see about what's the problem with
[48:59] the church what's the problem with your
[49:01] own life because what I though key if
[49:04] the key is faith and faith unlocks the
[49:07] door faith and locks all those blessings
[49:10] and all the mysteries and how do we get
[49:13] faith Romans 10:17
[49:15] so faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[49:16] by the Word of God so what do you need
[49:20] to have faith you need the word so you
[49:31] got to get in Christ and he's got to get
[49:34] in you and those are not necessarily two
[49:37] separate events because when he comes in
[49:41] you then you are connected back to the
[49:45] salt before the foundation of the world
[49:46] and you can look back by revelation and
[49:50] see how everything fits together you can
[49:54] see yourself in him how do you do that
[49:59] well just believe so he's got to get
[50:03] inside of you and brother brown talked
[50:06] about how the really the process of him
[50:08] getting inside of you is is a little bit
[50:11] difficult because you got to let go you
[50:15] got to die he talked about the like the
[50:20] little door to the right on the inside
[50:23] of the heart all the little doors and
[50:24] different messages he brought out
[50:26] different doors and this point was he's
[50:28] showing that that everybody's got all
[50:30] these things that you got to let go and
[50:32] with a greater that one of the chief
[50:34] most things to let go is when when
[50:35] somebody is talking to you about the
[50:37] word and you get in your head you've got
[50:39] all these others pride and ego built up
[50:42] that I can't admit I'm wrong because if
[50:45] I'm real I admit I'm wrong - that
[50:46] brother would have the upper hand or
[50:48] some such nonsense like that well the
[50:51] first step you got to do to becoming a
[50:53] Christian as you got to admit that
[50:54] you're lost you got to admit you're
[50:56] wrong you might as well start early and
[50:59] admit I'm wrong so that you can get on
[51:01] the right path so that may be one of the
[51:05] chief most doors one of our problems is
[51:07] that that Christ you know that that
[51:09] painting where he's trying to get in and
[51:10] you got to open the door so that he can
[51:13] come in come in he can't come in without
[51:15] you opening the door because he's a
[51:17] gentleman and he always goes where he's
[51:20] invited he won't come in unless you open
[51:22] the door to him and invite him in and he
[51:24] never breaks the promise he promised
[51:27] that he would give it to you
[51:28] if you open the door and let him in so
[51:31] it's both the easy and difficult just
[51:34] open the door
[51:35] just lay down all of your pride and your
[51:38] ego and your ideas and all these all
[51:41] these doors brother branham talked about
[51:43] the door of pride the door of
[51:45] selfishness it's for me and my group is
[51:47] for my little group over here but I'm
[51:49] talking about God don't deal with it
[51:50] groups he deals with individuals it's
[51:53] not going to be necessarily the church
[51:55] at Lula it's going to be each individual
[51:58] that he deals with each individual you
[52:01] know that's how we you know that's the
[52:03] problem in the message everybody says my
[52:05] group my group and everybody makes a
[52:07] little group and they want to know what
[52:08] group you're from what church do you go
[52:10] to so they can classify you I put you in
[52:12] another group but that's not how God
[52:13] deals with he just will to choose this
[52:15] group not not as the Gentiles he deals
[52:18] with us as individuals while within this
[52:20] group here that could be a lot of
[52:21] different ideas and different things and
[52:23] you just say that you're in this group
[52:25] does it draw what does that mean you sit
[52:28] here in uu one the seed that doesn't
[52:30] mean anything
[52:30] and all these other little doors the
[52:32] door a pride that we were just talking
[52:34] about I'm better than somebody else I
[52:36] don't want to let nobody know that I
[52:37] don't know about the gospel I don't want
[52:40] nobody know that I have a question you a
[52:42] complex pride makes complexes because
[52:45] you start thinking to some of her to my
[52:47] feelings and you you build up this
[52:49] complex and you you will be able to get
[52:51] any further until you drop that off drop
[52:54] it off inside the road and keep on going
[52:56] social standing I'm brother under said
[53:00] in one place somebody was saying I'm
[53:02] over those people talk about the
[53:04] Christians there the Christian the
[53:06] Pentecostals I'm over those people I
[53:07] don't want have nothing to do with them
[53:08] why because it pride gets in the way we
[53:10] make all these little cliques and
[53:12] everything the door of indifference now
[53:14] that's a bad one ended the door of
[53:16] indifference what we get so half-hearted
[53:17] we can't even hardly sit through a
[53:19] church service without keeping our
[53:20] letting our eyelids fall Clews lack of
[53:23] interested these are all things that
[53:24] butter and said lack of concern no
[53:27] empathy no concern for what's going on
[53:29] no concern for the word that's being
[53:31] preached but I tell you what if you get
[53:33] if you begin to savour the word and the
[53:35] word begins to be Quicken for you you
[53:36] get empathy real quick you will begin to
[53:39] run after that real quick you won't have
[53:40] any difference anymore
[53:42] you all be so half-hearted anymore but
[53:44] you'll run headlong bored because that's
[53:46] that's the Christian way God don't want
[53:48] us just to come to a church and sit
[53:50] there and not take party wants to be
[53:51] activated he wants us to be active in
[53:53] the service he wants to be active and
[53:55] and because we're we're not just sitting
[53:58] around but we're part of a living body
[54:00] of the body of Christ and there's some
[54:03] of some that our eyes the prophets some
[54:05] that are the mouth the preachers some
[54:06] that are that hear the people listening
[54:09] and some bit of defeat mover than the
[54:11] hands and the feet and all that but
[54:13] we're all part of this great body of
[54:15] Christ and we have a part to play the
[54:18] door of the private life you know
[54:20] brother and said that was something to
[54:21] resist that's what everybody gets
[54:23] offended at when you come to church and
[54:24] you start feeling like that maybe the
[54:26] word will just be gone out and God the
[54:29] spirit of God will be moving and
[54:30] addressing something in your life and
[54:32] you let your petty feelings get get in
[54:35] the way and you starting elissa
[54:36] preachers preach you know me he's curb
[54:38] my feelings and you can you go home and
[54:41] you got a little complex and maybe you
[54:43] take this maybe you take the CD and the
[54:45] tape you keep playing it over it's
[54:48] talking about me and you just let all
[54:49] these little petty feelings get in the
[54:51] way and what you need to do is just drop
[54:53] that let it go and keep going on sorry
[54:58] I start squawking again I lied to Lumos
[55:01] I'm wearing my time limit you start you
[55:07] start listening to a preacher start
[55:08] talking about talking about money for
[55:10] example they hear the Malachi 3 it says
[55:13] that if you give your tithes then
[55:15] they'll God will pour open the windows
[55:18] of blessing you know what kind of
[55:19] blessing would that be what's the
[55:20] greatest blessing of all the greatest
[55:22] blessing of all you give is the word the
[55:25] word that's the blessing that you get
[55:27] from paying your tithes if you're paying
[55:29] your tithes because you want a great big
[55:30] windfall you want to learn the world
[55:32] well and win the lottery you're not
[55:34] interested you're not even understanding
[55:36] the scripture right the blessing that
[55:38] you get is the opening of the word to
[55:40] you the word laying in your lap so you
[55:42] can eat it and receive it and of course
[55:44] when you start talking about tithes and
[55:46] things like that uh that's my money I
[55:48] made that don't talk to me about giving
[55:50] my money but the Bible says that's not
[55:53] your money the Bible says that's
[55:55] the money of course because now we get
[56:00] on that money and then of course the the
[56:04] biggest debate the major door the door
[56:07] of faith but God could get in that door
[56:11] when you just say Lord I've laid down
[56:14] all this other stuff I've laid down my
[56:17] pride I just want to hear I laid down my
[56:19] indifference I'm going to come to church
[56:21] even if I don't feel like it
[56:23] I've laid beyond my private life I'm
[56:25] going to lay my private life bare you
[56:26] can see everything I've laid down my
[56:29] selfishness I I don't care if this group
[56:33] seems like it's the wrong kind of group
[56:35] of this I've laid all this down and now
[56:38] it's time to just open up everything to
[56:41] God so that he can come in because you
[56:43] know God don't want to just come in and
[56:45] just kind of be put off and aside or
[56:47] anything he wants to be the lord and he
[56:49] wants to have total control over your
[56:52] life he wants to be like the son in the
[56:55] middle of the solar system controlling
[56:57] all of your senses all of your faculties
[57:00] controlling your memory your reasoning
[57:02] your consciousness your affection
[57:04] imagination everything every aspect of
[57:06] your life and the only way that you can
[57:08] do that is if you ladie so let me ask
[57:12] this question tonight will you open the
[57:14] door of faith to God tonight
[57:21] whether I said if Christ could come into
[57:23] the heart come into the door of faith
[57:26] now here's a big statement this is why I
[57:31] think this is why so there's so many
[57:33] problems going on people don't know
[57:35] which church to go to what to believe
[57:37] he said if Christ can come into the
[57:41] heart coming into the door of faith he
[57:46] will make you believe that all things
[57:50] are possible to them that believe so if
[57:56] you have a question tonight how do I
[57:58] know what's right I listen to all these
[58:01] voices all these ministries preaching
[58:03] atewa how do I even choose I don't know
[58:05] what's right I'm so confused
[58:08] well there's the answer to the dilemma
[58:10] first gets a new bird and then he'll do
[58:14] the believing for you brother Bob where
[58:17] is that in the box let me show you it
[58:19] says in Galatians 2:20 and this is one
[58:23] of the scripture you know everybody has
[58:24] a scripture this is my scripture because
[58:27] when I was born again I saw this
[58:30] scripture in a new way and it says I am
[58:35] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[58:38] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[58:43] and the life which I now live in the
[58:47] flesh I live now listen here's here
[58:51] we're talking about God putting his
[58:52] faith in you so that he does the
[58:55] believing and that that puts you that's
[58:58] what faith is that's why you got to be
[59:00] born again before you can start your
[59:03] journey up the stands of the perfect
[59:04] manner that should be like message 101
[59:07] but I digress he said I live by the
[59:11] faith not in the son of God but of the
[59:16] son of God who loved me and gave himself
[59:18] for me
[59:20] so you have your little bit of faith and
[59:22] you you open up the door and and you're
[59:26] just like I know that you died for my
[59:29] sins I know that if I repent you
[59:32] gave the promise and then he steps in
[59:34] and doesn't believe it for you how can
[59:36] you even believe the message without the
[59:38] new birth how can you even preach this
[59:41] message without the new birth good what
[59:44] would you be preaching if you don't have
[59:45] the preacher in you to preach it to
[59:48] believe it get the new birth first and
[59:53] there that will answer all the questions
[59:55] about well who's preaching what and
[59:57] what's going on there because then you
[59:59] have the believer inside of you
[1:00:02] of course then you'll say well the
[1:00:05] comforter is the teacher so why don't
[1:00:07] need any teachers no more
[1:00:08] I'm brother Branham answer that question
[1:00:10] to it who were check out Canada he said
[1:00:14] I just want to get this real quick
[1:00:18] questions and answers number nine he
[1:00:20] said you say well glory to God the Bible
[1:00:23] said when the Holy Ghost has come you
[1:00:24] don't need any teacher he's the teacher
[1:00:26] his self
[1:00:27] oh brother how can you be so little from
[1:00:29] reading the scripture why did the Holy
[1:00:31] Ghost set teachers in the church they
[1:00:33] say I don't have to have anybody teach
[1:00:35] me the Holy Ghost teaches me it does to
[1:00:37] a teacher
[1:00:38] he says teachers in the church he said
[1:00:40] all are all apostle teachers are all
[1:00:43] apostles are all gifts of healing the
[1:00:45] Holy Ghost set these things in the
[1:00:47] church he operates them all and each one
[1:00:49] of them operates orderly so I believe it
[1:00:53] an understanding the scripture opening
[1:00:55] the word a part of that is understanding
[1:00:58] how God is going to bring the word to
[1:01:00] you now you know today there's this
[1:01:05] thing going around it well brother
[1:01:07] Branham fulfilled all of the fivefold
[1:01:09] ministry and and to that I would say
[1:01:11] maybe this will be a little bit hearts
[1:01:13] but let's see how that works out because
[1:01:16] there's so much confusion over you know
[1:01:19] you listen to it like for example the
[1:01:21] Feast of the trumpets and you get all
[1:01:23] sorts of confused
[1:01:25] without with all the dates and things
[1:01:27] and maybe that's kind of a bold things
[1:01:30] to say but prove to me that you have a
[1:01:32] revelation you need the five bowl
[1:01:35] ministries that help you along to have
[1:01:36] somebody that you can actually question
[1:01:38] to you need somebody that can hear
[1:01:41] something wackadoo coming out your mouth
[1:01:43] and say that's not right
[1:01:45] and show you in the scripture where it's
[1:01:46] not right and and guide you low you need
[1:01:49] like yes what I could do yeah you need
[1:01:56] like this like they in The Book of
[1:01:58] Proverbs that says we're like iron on
[1:02:00] iron sharpening each other and I you
[1:02:03] know like lose that a lot because
[1:02:04] sometimes the sharpening process can be
[1:02:07] difficult we sharpen and we sit and we
[1:02:10] argue or whatever we talk about it but
[1:02:12] we're sharpening one another because
[1:02:14] it's we're making each other well well I
[1:02:17] never heard that before let me go read
[1:02:19] that quote let me go look at this
[1:02:20] scripture net everything and it just
[1:02:22] builds one another we're all working in
[1:02:24] harmony towards the kingdom and and
[1:02:27] because brother Branham he laid down
[1:02:29] these great big nuggets that that to tie
[1:02:32] everything together takes a lot of study
[1:02:35] that's why brother and said don't let a
[1:02:36] businessman that his objective is making
[1:02:39] money and making business don't let a
[1:02:42] businessman get up behind the pulpit
[1:02:44] because you need somebody that's been
[1:02:46] studied in the word and been brought up
[1:02:49] and tutelage in the word that knows
[1:02:51] where everything fits together that the
[1:02:53] statute of a perfect man don't just fit
[1:02:55] over here by itself and the son of man
[1:02:57] don't just fit over here by itself and
[1:02:59] and over here there's the son of God but
[1:03:01] you know how everything fits together
[1:03:02] and every everything moves and so then
[1:03:05] you can present a picture to the church
[1:03:07] that the church can receive and she
[1:03:09] becomes the Bride of Christ so I am
[1:03:13] convinced that you need a fivefold
[1:03:15] ministry and I hold it so I hope y'all
[1:03:20] know where I stand on that
[1:03:27] so we're talking about doors and I'm
[1:03:30] just getting here to the close here for
[1:03:32] a second I I know I've kept you a long
[1:03:34] time and I appreciate your patience and
[1:03:36] it looks like everybody's nice in
[1:03:37] attendance so we talked about doors
[1:03:40] doors to Egypt taking you from one room
[1:03:43] to another doors the door to get into
[1:03:45] Christ he is the door the doors to get
[1:03:47] into you so that you have any interest
[1:03:49] into you but now I want to talk about
[1:03:51] the door to get out of this time up into
[1:03:54] into eternity because in the book of
[1:03:57] Revelation it says enter the angel of
[1:03:59] the church in Philadelphia write these
[1:04:01] things saith he that is holy he that is
[1:04:04] true he that hath the key of David he
[1:04:06] that openeth and no man should have he's
[1:04:09] got the right to open a door and shut
[1:04:11] he's got the right to give you a
[1:04:12] revelation or not give one if you open
[1:04:16] the door he'll give you a revelation if
[1:04:17] you shut the door because that's the way
[1:04:19] it works that no man openeth I know thy
[1:04:21] works behold I have set before thee an
[1:04:23] open door and no man can shut it for
[1:04:26] thou asked a little strength and has
[1:04:28] kept my word and has not denied my name
[1:04:31] and we know of course we've been taught
[1:04:33] well that down through the seven
[1:04:34] churches the people would get all
[1:04:36] engrossed into their own ideas
[1:04:38] everything and alone would come a porter
[1:04:41] and the porter would give the people
[1:04:43] away to an open door he would preach a
[1:04:46] message to give them the word to escape
[1:04:48] the things of that age and they'd be
[1:04:50] called out of that age to receive the
[1:04:52] message for their day calling out into a
[1:04:55] broad age calling out into a but to be
[1:04:57] part of the word for their age and that
[1:05:00] repeated all down through the seven
[1:05:02] churches as a porter kept preaching the
[1:05:04] word he'd come at the end of the Asian
[1:05:06] and the people will be called out and
[1:05:08] and receive it and then that didn't go
[1:05:12] the door would be open just the same way
[1:05:15] as all the other doors that we've been
[1:05:16] talking about were open by faith they
[1:05:19] would hear the word and believe it a way
[1:05:21] of escape would be made for them and
[1:05:23] then that those things that they
[1:05:26] preached will be denominated and they go
[1:05:28] the people would go right back into kind
[1:05:31] of their own little system preachers
[1:05:33] will rise up and stand in the door and
[1:05:35] preach their old ideas and everything
[1:05:37] and then along would come another Porter
[1:05:39] and I had preached the open door he
[1:05:42] would preach his message and they kept
[1:05:44] moving on up and moving on up but now
[1:05:47] now we're at the time we read that
[1:05:49] scripture earlier how you look at the
[1:05:51] time look at the things that are
[1:05:53] happening around the earth the fig tree
[1:05:55] tree has put forth her buds there's not
[1:05:58] going to be another messenger so what's
[1:06:01] taking place now as a door a way of
[1:06:04] escape has been made for you and now
[1:06:06] where they had part word all through
[1:06:08] those seven churches they had a little
[1:06:11] here a little there now all of the word
[1:06:14] has been preached to you all of the word
[1:06:17] has been opened and so and the reason
[1:06:20] why that is so important is to give you
[1:06:23] understanding so that you can step
[1:06:25] through that door because this message
[1:06:28] wasn't given to us just so that we could
[1:06:30] have a little pity patty understanding
[1:06:32] that was maybe the same as all the other
[1:06:34] ages that we know that we need a new
[1:06:37] birth that we know that God sent a
[1:06:39] porter that he sent a messenger to this
[1:06:41] age it wasn't sent just just so that we
[1:06:44] could have an understanding of the basic
[1:06:46] things but it was sent to give an
[1:06:48] understanding so that we could take a
[1:06:50] body change to give us an understanding
[1:06:52] for example that we are as just did
[1:06:56] you're just as predestinated as jesus
[1:07:00] was that you have been justified in a
[1:07:04] way that you never did it in the first
[1:07:06] place that you have been purified by the
[1:07:09] blood of the Lamb that that you are able
[1:07:12] because the you have received the word
[1:07:14] that you are able to step from timing
[1:07:17] over the gap over into eternity to step
[1:07:21] over that breach I don't mean to
[1:07:23] squawking over into eternity and then
[1:07:27] you will be able to partake in the feast
[1:07:30] to the feast of it in a community and
[1:07:32] feast the feast of the trumpets after
[1:07:34] hearing the trumpets the sound are down
[1:07:36] through the seven churches the trumpet
[1:07:38] to the Gentiles declaring war now you
[1:07:41] have an understanding of who Christ is
[1:07:44] and who you are and you're able to
[1:07:46] identify who you are and you don't have
[1:07:48] it there's no more
[1:07:49] and it's eliminated the confusion so you
[1:07:51] don't have any questions now about why
[1:07:53] we are not a denomination or how to be
[1:07:56] born again or what the evidence of the
[1:07:57] new birth is or even if you are born
[1:07:59] again like so many have down what was
[1:08:05] that sister that had the dream of the
[1:08:07] statute of perfect meaning that the one
[1:08:09] sister Shepard that was wondering
[1:08:12] whether or not she has a new birth
[1:08:13] because now the word is open to you to
[1:08:16] identify the characteristics of the new
[1:08:18] birth so that you don't have to have
[1:08:20] questions like that anymore
[1:08:22] so what the statute of perfectman is
[1:08:24] what the bride tree was and how
[1:08:26] everything moves because the picture has
[1:08:28] been painted the masterpiece what the
[1:08:31] rapture is that the rapture is the word
[1:08:33] coming to the bride so that she becomes
[1:08:35] part of the bride and it's taking place
[1:08:37] right now that seventh seal mystery you
[1:08:40] don't have to there's you know they're
[1:08:41] still wandering around the messages the
[1:08:44] seven seals even open but I believe that
[1:08:46] we are we should know by now that the
[1:08:48] seven seals have been open it might not
[1:08:50] be open to you but it's available the
[1:08:53] word has been pray preached so they can
[1:08:56] be received by you if you'll open the
[1:08:58] door and receive it by faith
[1:09:02] all of these mysteries have been open so
[1:09:05] that you can have understanding so that
[1:09:07] you would have the key to faith to
[1:09:10] unlock the door and take a body change
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:19] and Isaiah just kind of comparing this
[1:09:24] scripture in Revelation three seven
[1:09:26] eight the key of David with Isaiah 22 22
[1:09:29] and he says in the key of the house of
[1:09:31] David will I lay upon his shoulder so he
[1:09:33] shall open and none shall shut and he
[1:09:35] shall shut and none shall open the key
[1:09:38] of David because the key of David you
[1:09:41] know brother Branham explained that the
[1:09:42] key of David and we're talking about
[1:09:43] keys to unlocking the door and brother
[1:09:46] Evan said the key of David
[1:09:47] so it was typing the marriage ceremony
[1:09:50] of the bride and the groom in the in the
[1:09:52] eastern and so forth how that they would
[1:09:55] the bride would take her veil and place
[1:09:59] it on the shoulder of the groom
[1:10:01] signifying complete
[1:10:02] each ownership that she was his now and
[1:10:05] so that's what that key of David is that
[1:10:08] Christ has taken care of his bride he's
[1:10:11] given her everything that she needs and
[1:10:14] now he's provided a way to open up that
[1:10:17] door he said so the key of David
[1:10:19] signifies that it is Jesus who will
[1:10:22] bring in the Millennium so in this day
[1:10:25] the message has been preached the word
[1:10:27] has been open the door should be open to
[1:10:30] us a message for their day has been
[1:10:32] preached all down the seven churches and
[1:10:35] now the complete word has been preached
[1:10:37] so that we can take the rapture we
[1:10:40] should need somebody now to convince us
[1:10:42] that we need to go to church or that we
[1:10:44] need to read our Bible or that we need
[1:10:46] to seek God and all these little things
[1:10:48] but now is the time to come to a
[1:10:51] revelation of what's taking place amen
[1:10:56] and the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:10:59] I'm just going to finish here but when
[1:11:01] one door opens before you another door
[1:11:05] shuts behind you and as you keep going
[1:11:07] you know there's doors opening shutting
[1:11:10] and things as you keep moving forward
[1:11:12] and when this door opens in heaven
[1:11:15] that's going to be in there isn't it
[1:11:17] brother Branham is not going to come
[1:11:19] back and preach another message so that
[1:11:21] we can catch a last minute revelation
[1:11:22] that's going to be the redemption will
[1:11:25] be over and so because of that because
[1:11:28] Redemption will be over the door will be
[1:11:30] shut in the same way that Noah's Ark was
[1:11:32] shut and after Noah's Ark was shut that
[1:11:36] is when the rain began to fall then
[1:11:39] brother Brent said the church will be
[1:11:41] anointed when that door is shut and
[1:11:42] anointing will come upon the church and
[1:11:44] I don't have that quote in front of me
[1:11:46] so I'm kind of paraphrasing but when the
[1:11:48] door is shut the rain will fall amen
[1:11:52] I believe that so I want to let's just
[1:11:55] stand to our feet and you know I believe
[1:11:59] we all have little problems in their
[1:12:01] life that we're still trying to overcome
[1:12:03] so maybe let's just let's just open the
[1:12:06] door to him tonight to come in and and
[1:12:09] just deliver us by the revealing of his
[1:12:12] word from all the little petty things
[1:12:14] we've got in her life and
[1:12:16] if there's something something hindering
[1:12:18] you or something you've got against
[1:12:20] somebody or anything I pride all those
[1:12:22] different things that we talked about
[1:12:24] let's just give it all over the hill so
[1:12:26] will you just raise your hand and just
[1:12:28] just say Lord I want to open my door all
[1:12:31] I want to fling them all open to you
[1:12:34] tonight and we'll just go all in prayer
[1:12:36] tonight Lord Jesus you see every hand

[1:12:41] heard the word that I preach Lord Jesus
[1:12:43] I I believe it Lord God I believe Lord
[1:12:46] and if we'll open our heart that's
[1:12:47] written in your word if we'll open these
[1:12:49] doors that you will come in and abide
[1:12:53] with us Lord Lord we're lifting up our
[1:12:56] hands Lord Jesus to find the laws of
[1:12:58] gravity because we believe in Lord Jesus
[1:13:00] and I pray God that you'll just come and
[1:13:02] help us Lord Jesus to yield is Lord in
[1:13:05] the coming week Lord in the coming
[1:13:06] months to yield ourselves more and more
[1:13:09] to draw closer to you so that we have
[1:13:11] true communion and true fellowship with
[1:13:13] you understanding the things that have
[1:13:15] been hidden in the scriptures
[1:13:16] understanding the things that have been
[1:13:18] veiled before our eyes for all these
[1:13:21] years but now Lord God will flinging the
[1:13:23] doors wide Lord Jesus that you could
[1:13:25] come and be the lord of our experience
[1:13:27] Lord of our heart Lord Jesus and then

[1:13:34] and be Lord of all Lord Jesus grant and
[1:13:37] I pray Lord that you'll just take the
