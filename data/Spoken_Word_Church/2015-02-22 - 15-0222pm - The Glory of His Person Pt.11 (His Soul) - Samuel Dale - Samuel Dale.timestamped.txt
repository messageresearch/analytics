[9:07] kind of turn the message because of a
[9:10] lot of company being with us and
[9:11] everything but it still gave an
[9:13] opportunity to kind of just lay a little
[9:15] uh point in I believe that will help us

[9:45] everything and we we just
[9:47] we say God bless because that's the way
[9:50] he will do we try to do his work and
[9:53] he'll
[9:54] he'll do the blessing if we do his work
[9:56] all right Revelation anything else in

[10:07] things Lord that you've given us
[10:09] and we know that you give them to us
[10:11] freely so then that way we don't have to
[10:14] try to make any arrangements to pay for
[10:16] them
[10:16] to try to get them or pay for them after
[10:18] we get them we just rest in you and we
[10:21] believe you Lord that you'll take care

[10:40] and we thank you just have your way now
[10:42] and keep us in Jesus name
[10:44] amen
[10:47] Revelations
[10:49] one
[10:52] and I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[10:53] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[10:55] of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[10:58] the first and the last what thou see us
[11:01] write in the book and send it unto the
[11:02] seven churches which are in Asia
[11:06] unto some Ephesus and unto Smyrna and
[11:10] unto pergamas and unto taitara and into
[11:13] Sardis and unto Philadelphia and then on
[11:15] the lady of SIA and I turned to see the
[11:17] voice that spake with me and being
[11:19] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[11:21] and in the midst of the seven
[11:23] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[11:25] man clothed the Garment down to the foot
[11:28] and gird about the pouch with a golden
[11:31] girdle we're still on this great person
[11:33] right so now let's go to Acts
[11:38] two in just one verse
[11:41] 31
[11:45] he's seeing this before spake of the
[11:47] resurrection of Christ
[11:49] that his soul was not left in Hell
[11:51] neither his flesh did see corruption all
[11:55] right then we'll try to get to our
[11:56] thought in Genesis of 1 26 and 27
[12:01] and uh then we'll go on from there
[12:04] because we're going to try to continue
[12:06] what we were talking about this morning
[12:07] but try to get it down to understanding
[12:11] more about this part that we are all
[12:15] right
[12:18] and God said let us make man in our
[12:20] image after our likeness and let them
[12:22] out dominion over the fish of the sea
[12:24] and over the fall of the iron over the
[12:26] cattle and over all the Earth
[12:28] and over ever creeping thing that
[12:31] creepeth upon the Earth
[12:33] so God created man in his own image
[12:35] in the image of God created him male and
[12:40] female created he them you may be seated
[12:43] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[12:46] of the word
[12:48] now
[12:50] we uh
[12:53] I said I just kind of
[12:56] redone and went a little bit different
[12:58] direction this morning because of a lot
[13:00] of company and you know that way you
[13:03] just don't keep driving on because
[13:05] people don't understand what you're
[13:06] talking about you don't want to do that
[13:09] so you want to help as much as you can
[13:12] and it gives us a time to consider a lot
[13:15] of things but
[13:17] now
[13:19] we've been talking about the nature of
[13:22] God
[13:23] and how that nature displays that doing
[13:27] in his creation he displays his nature
[13:30] his ways his being
[13:33] because of the way that he created
[13:36] things
[13:37] and how that he was to to bring that
[13:40] into
[13:41] being would show his very nature of that
[13:45] being that was doing it and everything
[13:48] was created perfect
[13:50] nothing out of order everything perfect
[13:53] not Eternal because you can't create
[13:56] eternal
[13:57] all right but
[13:59] in doing that he was actually
[14:03] displaying
[14:04] his own nature down to Mankind we could
[14:09] go through all of the creation of the
[14:11] Earth the animals the things you know
[14:13] and do but we just jumping over to the
[14:17] creation of man
[14:20] but I don't want you to forget one thing
[14:23] that we're talking about God being real
[14:26] talking about God being a being
[14:31] Not Just Like the Wind
[14:34] you know but he's a being he's a spirit
[14:37] all right we say what God is a spirit
[14:40] all right that's true these are spirited
[14:43] that's wonderful but really he's a
[14:46] spiritual being
[14:47] right because if you just related Spirit
[14:49] then you're rolling back to your point
[14:52] of not allowing him to
[14:55] um manifest himself
[14:57] because how can he manifest himself as a
[15:00] Healer savior Redeemer Etc if he's doing
[15:04] it only in the point of just saying that
[15:07] God is a spirit
[15:08] all right so then he has to condescend
[15:11] and in doing that in condescending
[15:13] downward then we can look at the things
[15:17] as they take place
[15:19] and we can look and see that truly he is
[15:23] the beginning of the creation
[15:26] not that he had a beginning
[15:30] but that he within himself was Desiring
[15:34] to display himself all right and to do
[15:39] that he would have to come into being in
[15:42] our Realm
[15:44] right in in the realm of mankind okay
[15:48] see then that way he would put us in
[15:51] this realm and then he would come into
[15:53] this realm as to do that remember what
[15:56] we we had the drawing and I don't want
[15:58] to use it right now I'll use it in a
[16:00] minute on the the drawing that we've
[16:02] been using but remember the line and
[16:04] dividing in eternity
[16:06] and remember that we've been been quite
[16:08] a time over on the the side over here
[16:11] into the in the beginning but before the
[16:14] eternal
[16:16] and bringing that down but now we're
[16:19] beginning to come over to the other side
[16:21] or come over into
[16:23] uh time as we would say and uh doings of
[16:29] life but just remember now
[16:32] you remember the drawing that we gave
[16:34] that whatever is on one side will have
[16:37] to be on the other side
[16:39] whatever he's displaying now as his
[16:41] attributes
[16:43] he had to have those attributes before
[16:46] he ever started anything
[16:49] all right and that that way then you
[16:52] would not be leaving something out he
[16:54] never gained attributes you know he
[16:57] displayed his attributes all right all
[17:00] of those attributes you want to talk
[17:01] about healing savior et cetera Etc we're
[17:04] in him before the world but not to the
[17:08] point that he was displaying him right
[17:11] but they was a part of him part of his
[17:13] nature part of his ways part of his
[17:16] being and he begins to reveal himself
[17:20] to you and I and the way he does that is
[17:23] by condescending
[17:26] all right
[17:26] coming more into the realm where we're
[17:30] at
[17:31] because he knew what we would be that
[17:33] even the best in the garden
[17:35] would be a problem he knew if he made
[17:38] Adam and Eve and gave him a choice
[17:41] that they would fall he knew all of that
[17:44] so then he knew that he could display
[17:46] his attributes from that but looked like
[17:49] he would have just said now wait just a
[17:50] minute I just won't bring the devil into
[17:52] being I'll just do all this other and
[17:54] we'll have a wonderful time but he
[17:56] couldn't display his attributes
[17:59] so he had to permit it had to allow us
[18:01] to come into being
[18:03] now I want you to hold the next two
[18:06] services with me or at least this
[18:08] service
[18:09] um
[18:11] hold it to not thinking about you as
[18:14] much
[18:16] as thinking about him coming into being
[18:19] all right everybody follow me that how
[18:22] that God comes into being
[18:24] into being for us to understand it not
[18:26] that he come into being that he wasn't
[18:28] into being didn't he come into being and
[18:30] you know no no I don't have an education
[18:32] I'm sorry so you just have to put up
[18:34] with the way I speak
[18:36] but how that he will bring himself into
[18:39] being
[18:41] right so that we can understand him all
[18:45] right we're going to talk about today
[18:46] his soul
[18:49] all right you remember this morning we
[18:51] dealt with that you know
[18:53] and uh dealing just a little bit about
[18:56] the soul right at the end
[18:57] and the Soul being who you are and what
[19:00] you are
[19:01] your being and things so go ahead
[19:04] brother
[19:06] you don't know who's back there now they
[19:07] got where they're putting the kids in
[19:08] and we appreciate these kids for for
[19:11] helping them but they're they're sharp
[19:13] on that too so
[19:15] this is what the the Old Testament
[19:18] let's see yeah we've got the Greek and
[19:20] then we got the Hebrew
[19:22] the Old Testament word Soul where it
[19:25] comes our you know when he created Adam
[19:26] become a living Soul see it means life
[19:30] mind heart
[19:33] it means like the Breath of Life the
[19:35] vital force which animates the body and
[19:38] shows itself in breathing of animals
[19:41] of men see it connects to that part of
[19:43] animal but they don't have that Soul all
[19:45] right but the that in which there is
[19:48] life
[19:51] a living being
[19:54] a living soul
[19:57] the seat of the feelings
[20:00] desires affections and things heart no
[20:04] the human soul insofar as it is uh what
[20:07] is that word
[20:09] constituted That by The Right Use of the
[20:12] AIDS offered it by God it can attain its
[20:16] highest end and secure Eternal
[20:18] blessedness the soul regarded as a moral
[20:21] being designed for everlasting life
[20:25] the soul as an essence
[20:28] which differs from the body and is not
[20:31] dissolved by death see even they know
[20:34] that by the definition of the word
[20:36] distinguished from the other parts of
[20:38] the body all right now that's the Old
[20:40] Testament form let's use the New
[20:42] Testament form it just picks up just a
[20:44] little bit better into understanding
[20:47] because this is you know where I think
[20:50] it's the scripture where Jesus said my
[20:52] soul is troubled I'm sure that's where
[20:54] it come from
[20:55] but look at 5315 and it goes into soul
[21:01] self life creature person appetite mind
[21:07] living being desire emotion passion
[21:11] all right that which breeds
[21:14] the breathing substance
[21:16] are the being so the inner being of man
[21:19] living being living being with the life
[21:22] in the blood
[21:23] the man himself
[21:26] person or individual so that's what our
[21:30] soul is now here's Webster and I hope
[21:33] they didn't use mine I hope they typed
[21:34] it because boy mine is a mess
[21:38] uh did you use that one not I'll give it
[21:41] to you Webster says that the word soul
[21:44] is the principle of life
[21:47] feeling thought
[21:50] an action of man
[21:52] it's the spiritual part of man as
[21:55] distinct from the physical body
[21:58] it's a human being it's a person
[22:01] the embodiment of some quality it means
[22:04] Spirit it means heart it means Essence
[22:08] it means core you know sinner of
[22:11] anything all right that's why the Bible
[22:14] will talk about the heart of man
[22:18] all right but that doesn't mean the
[22:20] thumping gizzard
[22:22] you know
[22:23] that means the core or Essence are the
[22:26] part of you that really makes you what
[22:28] you are
[22:30] your being and it makes you a person
[22:34] see then that's what it was so then when
[22:36] we get over in a little bit to where it
[22:38] says let us make man in our image then
[22:41] you'll see you know it'll tie together
[22:43] with what we were talking about this
[22:45] morning in the basis of
[22:48] talking about the soul
[22:51] and how that he gave his soul to redeem
[22:54] us all right now because that that will
[22:58] bring us to the rightful position now
[23:01] we've give this quote right here a lot
[23:02] but I love it
[23:04] I don't know how many more times I'll
[23:06] read it
[23:07] because I love the quote itself even
[23:10] though it seems like that you know it
[23:13] gives you a problem with understanding
[23:15] but with our understanding corrected by
[23:18] the prophet and the Holy Spirit why
[23:20] should we have any problem about you
[23:23] know the things look what he says on the
[23:24] questions and answers on Genesis
[23:26] paragraph 21 now if God created man in
[23:29] his own image and his his own likeness
[23:32] what kind of a man did he create
[23:34] a spirit man now if you'll notice after
[23:37] he had made all the creation and created
[23:39] a spirit man okay raised it on up and
[23:42] said he made man in his own image to
[23:45] lead the cattle now that's in Soul
[23:47] theophany
[23:51] all right now we're going to get down to
[23:52] some points because
[23:56] well we'll hold on he made manners on
[23:59] image to lead the cat to leave the Beast
[24:01] to the field just like the Holy Spirit
[24:03] leads the believer today
[24:05] all right now that's not the natural
[24:07] flesh of Adam
[24:09] that was in his spiritual creation
[24:12] now watch though he was in other words
[24:14] Adam the first man in the lower
[24:15] creations of God
[24:17] the first creation was God himself
[24:20] that doesn't mean God is creating
[24:24] you know now we'll get to the other
[24:25] point in a second and watch now
[24:28] but watch the first creation was God
[24:29] himself then out of God came to logos
[24:32] which was the son of God and out of the
[24:34] Lord Gods which was the word in the
[24:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[24:37] made flesh and dwelt among us out of the
[24:39] Lord Gods came forth came the man all
[24:42] right the man of what the man that was
[24:45] created in the image of God
[24:47] to lead the animals
[24:50] not as a flesh man
[24:53] he was leading the animals at Spirit man
[24:57] spiritual being
[24:59] all right
[25:01] in the image of God
[25:03] all right go ahead with the next one
[25:04] because this is what I want to this is
[25:07] an insert so you'll see I didn't
[25:08] underline because brother random says
[25:11] here in the church age book 336 the
[25:14] beginning of the creation of God
[25:16] that is who the Lord Jesus says he is
[25:18] but those words don't mean exactly as
[25:20] they sound to us just taking them the
[25:23] way they sound has made some people in
[25:25] fact multitudes of people get the idea
[25:28] that Jesus was the first creation of God
[25:31] making him lower than godhead
[25:34] then this verse now remember that's what
[25:36] they think
[25:38] there's where your Trinity concept comes
[25:40] into being see
[25:42] that God created Jesus then Jesus
[25:44] created everything because they know by
[25:46] the Bible Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1
[25:50] James 3 and what is it it's not James
[25:53] Ephesians 3 and 9 that Jesus Christ was
[25:57] the creator
[25:59] all right of everything nothing was
[26:02] created when all the Bible said so then
[26:05] people think that God created Jesus
[26:08] and Jesus created everything else
[26:11] all right but he says that's not right
[26:14] says all right in fact multitudes the
[26:17] people get the idea that Jesus was the
[26:20] first creation of God making him lower
[26:21] than God hid
[26:23] then this first creation created all the
[26:26] rest of the universe and whatsoever it
[26:29] contains but that is not right you know
[26:32] that doesn't line up with the rest of
[26:33] the Bible the words are he is the
[26:36] beginning or author of the creation of
[26:39] God now we know for surety that Jesus is
[26:42] God very God he is the creator all right
[26:46] now watch
[26:48] John 1 3 declared him to be that and
[26:51] made by him he's the one who is said in
[26:53] Genesis 1 1 the beginning God created
[26:56] heaven the Earth he's also in Exodus 20
[26:58] and 11 then in six days the Lord created
[27:02] to heavens and the Earth and all and and
[27:04] rested the seventh see there is no doubt
[27:08] that he is the creator
[27:10] he was the creator of a finished
[27:12] physical creation surely we can see what
[27:15] these words mean now to have any other
[27:18] interpretation would mean that God
[27:20] created God
[27:22] how could God be created when he himself
[27:25] is the creator all right
[27:28] is that a simple answer
[27:31] then when he says that that first
[27:34] creation is God himself he's not talking
[27:36] about creating himself
[27:39] you know no
[27:41] he's not saying that well something had
[27:44] to create now it means he's coming into
[27:47] being
[27:49] to word that we can comprehend
[27:53] amen all right and see the trinitarian
[27:55] concept would be glad to take Jesus as
[27:58] God creating Jesus
[28:01] and in Jesus creating everything else
[28:03] that is your trinitarian concept
[28:06] that's where they come up with a God in
[28:08] three persons in a different thing
[28:09] because they can look back there and
[28:11] they can see that that logos that
[28:13] theophany that things it was said would
[28:17] be called by the theologians the Son of
[28:19] God Amen amen you remember how we were
[28:21] bringing that out how the prophet brings
[28:23] it out
[28:25] how he brought it out in his first quote
[28:27] right and God created man in his own
[28:29] image
[28:30] then what kind of a man did he create a
[28:32] spirit man
[28:34] right
[28:36] see then in getting it lined up
[28:39] correctly
[28:40] all we got to do is find one thing
[28:45] okay go ahead and quote number two and
[28:47] let's see what we've got to find
[28:51] all right
[28:53] this is questions and answers on Genesis
[28:56] paragraph 13 atheistic
[29:03] rolling on up to save because we've got
[29:05] to do we'll stop on the reading what
[29:07] connection does this Genesis 1 26 how
[29:09] would Genesis 2 7. God created two men
[29:12] that's their question now and which was
[29:15] the man in which what connection does
[29:17] that have
[29:19] what how does it connect up in the
[29:21] scripture well if you'll notice close
[29:24] now in Genesis 1 26 let's get the first
[29:27] part first God said let us now let us is
[29:32] is a US is a let us make man in our own
[29:36] image
[29:38] our course we realize he's talking to
[29:41] someone
[29:42] he was speaking to another being
[29:46] now remember we went through that
[29:48] that's not the father and son discussing
[29:52] that's word and spirit
[29:56] if not father and son it's two people
[29:58] separated discussing it
[30:01] it's word and spirit
[30:03] it's coming into being so watch what he
[30:05] said let us make man in our own image
[30:08] after our likeness and let them out
[30:10] dominion over the cattle to the field if
[30:12] you notice in creation the first thing
[30:14] that was created of course was light
[30:16] you come on down to the creation the
[30:19] last thing was created was what a man
[30:22] and one was made after the man all right
[30:25] the first the last thing that was
[30:26] created of God's creation is mankind but
[30:29] when God made his first creation if you
[30:32] notice he made him in the likeness of
[30:35] himself
[30:37] he was made in the image of God
[30:40] and what is God
[30:42] right now if we can find out what God is
[30:47] we can find out what kind of a man he
[30:51] made
[30:52] right now that's your Prophet describing
[30:55] it to it so all we need to do is find
[30:57] out what kind of a
[30:59] Man was created
[31:04] and then when we do we'll find out about
[31:07] God but when we find out about God we
[31:10] find out about man
[31:12] because if you're going with a scripture
[31:15] to make Man In His Image
[31:19] all right
[31:20] whatever that image is is going to be
[31:22] displayed
[31:24] well remember whatever this is if this
[31:27] is in the image of it
[31:29] it is not a second part or anything it's
[31:33] the same being
[31:36] right now we're going to get down to
[31:37] some technical hard things
[31:40] and some of you are going to immediately
[31:42] think that I'm going with a lot of the
[31:45] doctrines of the pre-existences and
[31:47] things but you better remember for 40
[31:50] something years I've fought those
[31:52] doctrines of pre-existence
[31:56] even to it being a Mormon doctrine of
[31:58] pre-existence of souls a prophet said he
[32:01] didn't believe in now he believed in the
[32:03] pre-existence of eternal life
[32:06] he believed in the pre-existence of God
[32:11] all right but he didn't believe in the
[32:13] pre-existence of mankind as we are
[32:16] right as we are
[32:19] he never believed it that way
[32:22] because it won't line up with the rest
[32:24] of the scripture
[32:25] all right so then we got to keep it in
[32:27] line but if we can find out what God is
[32:31] we can find out what kind of a man he
[32:34] made
[32:36] right is that what he said about it
[32:39] now what did he make going to the next
[32:42] we've been over a lot of these but try
[32:44] to put them together and I run them all
[32:45] where you could read them for yourself
[32:47] and take them home with you and if I was
[32:50] you I'd keep these for next Sunday
[32:52] because we will background a lot on it
[32:55] okay
[32:56] look what he says on the message Souls
[32:58] that are in prison now preaches 63.
[33:03] and then first man was made and then
[33:06] first man was made
[33:07] he was made a spirit being in the image
[33:10] of God which God is a spirit Saint John
[33:13] 4. now he is a a spirit and they that
[33:17] worship Him
[33:18] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[33:21] and thy word is the truth now we worship
[33:23] Him in spirit in truth he is a a spirit
[33:27] being
[33:28] then there was no man to tell the soil
[33:31] and then God formed man out of the US to
[33:33] the Earth all right so the spirit man
[33:36] the answer of the question of what the
[33:38] two beep part man you know or whatever
[33:42] he first has created a spirit man amen
[33:45] in the image of God
[33:51] you might as well swallow
[33:55] remember
[33:57] if you are a true child of God
[34:01] and you have eternal life
[34:04] there is only one form of eternal life
[34:10] that's why you are called an offspring
[34:12] of God what is an offspring of God
[34:18] well it's a kitty head
[34:23] let's don't get it too dirty all right
[34:29] what is an offspring of God
[34:33] thank you
[34:34] is God in another form
[34:38] no you tell me any other definition
[34:42] a child of God that is real a child of
[34:44] God now we're not talking about all the
[34:46] other parts that goes around
[34:48] if you have eternal life today remember
[34:51] there's only one Eternal amen
[34:54] and that is what God's own life
[35:02] amen you remember the other week when
[35:05] Wade was bringing it out there and
[35:06] talking about the uh
[35:08] the part of us being co-equal was that
[35:12] the one
[35:13] the Bible says that we're co-equal
[35:21] ity what do you think about a soul
[35:24] then you'll see I wasn't playing this
[35:26] morning
[35:27] I was just wording it different
[35:33] if your soul has eternal life where did
[35:35] it get it
[35:40] it can only be God's own life
[35:45] right right
[35:47] sure right now
[35:50] think about it
[35:54] the first man was a spirit being
[36:00] in the image of God
[36:03] now
[36:05] I'm making it as hard as I can
[36:09] to worry that you can think
[36:12] when you were talking about image
[36:16] we try to make it as well
[36:20] um John brother college boy looks like
[36:23] him
[36:25] you know
[36:27] he's a very spitting image of his daddy
[36:31] he looks like him
[36:35] not James what's the other one Myron
[36:37] Myron looks like him
[36:42] he looks like it
[36:43] but he's not in the spitting image
[36:49] identical twins
[36:51] or not spitting the image because
[36:52] there'll be some difference in somewhere
[36:54] some part
[36:57] you see we want to make image as being a
[37:00] picture taken
[37:01] move it
[37:04] why not get serious
[37:06] and think about that he said
[37:10] let us make man in our own image
[37:18] are we a creation of God
[37:28] if you think
[37:32] remember if we are creation of God we
[37:35] would be something separate from God
[37:41] my brother tell you to make him just a
[37:43] little too strong no I'm not ain't
[37:44] making it strong enough yet that's right
[37:46] yeah you stick around you might find
[37:48] some more words
[37:52] but when you talk about the image and
[37:54] likeness
[38:01] was that man that was made in Genesis
[38:09] was it Adam
[38:12] yeah
[38:15] he received the name of Adam to make it
[38:17] a clarification but remember whatever
[38:21] was in Adam
[38:23] and we won't go that far but we're going
[38:25] to go there
[38:27] the Eve was in Adam and she never had a
[38:31] name
[38:33] and even after she was created
[38:38] her name was woman
[38:40] right she never received the name until
[38:43] she fell
[38:46] so I would think
[38:49] I told you I said when he dated I'm
[38:51] going to preach on the godhead
[38:53] um
[38:53] I'd listen
[38:57] but now
[39:01] if it's in the image
[39:06] then Jesus was in the image of God
[39:12] does that make him a second person
[39:17] are you with me
[39:19] was Jesus the second person
[39:22] brother random said he wasn't even the
[39:25] first person you remember he gave that
[39:27] two or three times
[39:29] he said he is the person
[39:33] that now you've gone too far cause
[39:35] you're gone into Oneness
[39:39] nope
[39:41] because you see I don't have any problem
[39:44] with Jesus standing there praying to his
[39:47] father
[39:48] and saying it out loud
[39:50] I'm a little trouble with that
[39:52] if you say then I'll remind ask you when
[39:55] why don't you just not pray out loud
[39:58] now don't you just shut up and just pray
[40:00] to yourself if you're in that way
[40:04] all right
[40:06] see we're not getting down to the
[40:08] understanding of the Bible that the
[40:12] prophet was trying to bring to us
[40:15] about what we are
[40:20] and it certainly would not help us to
[40:22] remain with our trinitarian concept
[40:25] as to him being one person and us being
[40:28] another one
[40:33] but I just can't see brother Dale it's
[40:37] your God
[40:38] well you want me to call Brother Brown's
[40:40] name and let him read it
[40:41] you know would you respect it more in
[40:44] him
[40:46] or would you respect it more in Jesus
[40:48] when he would be saying things
[40:52] and do you mind if I quote brother
[40:54] Bradham he said sometimes the father was
[40:57] speaking
[41:00] and sometimes Jesus was speaking
[41:03] now you deal with that
[41:06] is that trinitarian
[41:09] no
[41:11] is it Oneness no
[41:14] this Prophet is the only one who could
[41:16] divide that line between the trinitarian
[41:19] concept and the Oneness
[41:22] he said they both are truth
[41:25] who said we want the truth
[41:29] all right amen so he made a spirit being
[41:35] but yet he had that spirit being
[41:39] the end
[41:41] he created man from the soul
[41:47] and the man from the saw was not in the
[41:49] image of God
[41:51] remember it was in the image of animals
[41:54] right
[41:55] foot like a bear and like a chimpanzee
[41:58] or something you know
[42:01] the highest form of animal
[42:05] s
[42:11] so what is he
[42:14] let's read a little
[42:16] going to number four
[42:18] which is taken from the cruelty of sin
[42:21] and the penalty that caused
[42:25] to get rid of that sin
[42:27] from our lives
[42:29] paragraph 51.
[42:31] so he couldn't just leave it in that
[42:34] state
[42:36] it leaves something with it check what
[42:38] he's talking about back before then all
[42:40] right
[42:41] so he said let us plural
[42:44] make man plural
[42:47] in our own image
[42:49] and let us let us make man in our own
[42:52] image so then when God made his first
[42:55] man
[42:57] he was the spirit man
[43:00] he was something on the order of God
[43:05] or the son of God
[43:08] the Lord gosh
[43:10] that was the first man
[43:13] then he gave the man jurisdiction over
[43:16] the to lead to all the animals life just
[43:20] like the Holy Spirit leads the believer
[43:21] today
[43:22] go here to them
[43:24] but look what he says
[43:28] it's what I'm saying see we want to put
[43:32] I'm trying to hold this to a point of
[43:35] talking about
[43:37] his soul instead of talking about us but
[43:41] we've got to talk about us
[43:43] but now remember one thing
[43:45] there's over related quotes that lean
[43:48] and go backwards and forth but remember
[43:53] Cain don't fit to her
[43:59] right
[44:01] even Abel don't fit there
[44:07] right
[44:07] so he's talking about one man
[44:13] Adam
[44:15] all right yeah the rest of us is there
[44:19] but we'll have to be brought out in
[44:20] understanding
[44:22] right and later as we go along but look
[44:24] what he's saying
[44:26] first man was a spirit man that wasn't
[44:28] all mankind
[44:35] that was Adam
[44:38] but he wouldn't Adam at that time
[44:43] he was part of God
[44:48] yeah but you're getting it a little too
[44:49] close to deity brother Dale
[44:56] I hope
[44:58] let me let me quote him off let me quote
[45:01] brother mode about something years ago
[45:02] he said you can't go no further off into
[45:08] let's see how did he say he said you you
[45:10] go into unbelief
[45:13] and you know in paraphrasing his wording
[45:16] and he says you can't be any worse going
[45:18] this way then you can go over that away
[45:22] you know
[45:25] you talk about
[45:28] well it's wrong to do this it's wrong to
[45:30] do that
[45:32] and we know it is
[45:34] but you can't be no worse there than you
[45:36] are on the other side of the fence
[45:38] trying to prop up yourself as to being
[45:41] something good
[45:44] see because it doesn't bring out to the
[45:46] right order
[45:48] all right
[45:49] let's just keep it what I'm talking
[45:51] about
[45:54] I'm really driving a point today
[45:57] of talking about God and who he is and
[46:01] that not that he has a soul but that he
[46:04] is a soul
[46:05] he's a being he's a person
[46:09] he's not a person that has a person
[46:15] maybe one of these days we'll realize
[46:17] why brother Branham would make a
[46:18] statement one day
[46:19] he said A True Believer taking the word
[46:22] upon his and he say upon his heart or
[46:24] something and speak upon his lips he
[46:26] said it's deity speaking
[46:35] you might realize something's taking
[46:37] place Among Us
[46:39] that we need to understand look at
[46:41] number five
[46:44] this is taken from the message of
[46:46] questions and answers on Genesis
[46:48] paragraph 43
[46:52] then he asked the question he made the
[46:54] bees the monkeys and everything
[46:56] let us who father and son
[47:01] I don't mind giving these quotes it
[47:03] sounds like it's trinitarians
[47:06] I just gave you three quotes there where
[47:08] it says let us plural
[47:10] father son
[47:12] and who's he talking about another being
[47:17] I don't believe right around was
[47:18] confused do you
[47:22] know I might not know what he's talking
[47:23] about there but I don't believe he was
[47:24] confused
[47:29] I believe he believed it
[47:32] but I believe he had an understanding
[47:35] that when he said one day he said let's
[47:38] stand and address the third person of
[47:40] the trinity
[47:42] brother branham's preached for 40
[47:44] something years that there was one God
[47:46] but look at that really he meant this
[47:48] three he finally come out and told it
[47:51] but he only told it one time
[47:54] like a brother up in Indiana one time I
[47:56] believe it was told his other brother
[47:58] said
[48:00] brother Brandon was deity the brother
[48:03] Tony said I don't think that's right now
[48:05] because because he said here if you make
[48:07] me God you make me an antichrist he said
[48:09] he only said them things to throw you
[48:11] off
[48:12] he said well he done a good job throwing
[48:14] me off because I don't believe it
[48:17] because that would be the way to go over
[48:18] it but look
[48:20] then he asked this question now let us
[48:22] who Father and Son make man our own
[48:25] image now if a man was made something
[48:27] like that little sacred light Yonder or
[48:31] something like that
[48:33] it could not be seen which is a
[48:36] spiritual being
[48:38] he manifested or unfolded himself
[48:42] a little more to make a trinity of
[48:44] himself by father Son and the Holy
[48:47] Spirit
[48:48] and here was God
[48:50] unfolded himself now down into
[48:54] let us make man which was his son an
[48:58] offspring from him
[49:03] man in his own image he was a
[49:06] supernatural being
[49:08] now
[49:12] are we The Offspring of God
[49:16] I'll bring it over to us by the new
[49:17] birth you know because you can't make
[49:20] that back there
[49:21] the wrong thing all right
[49:26] and Paul would say it's Christ and you
[49:28] the hope of glory
[49:30] what kind of an image are you talking
[49:32] about
[49:34] he says that that man that was made
[49:36] there led to cattle everything just like
[49:39] the Holy Spirit leads to the real True
[49:41] Believer today watch
[49:44] the voice of God out there
[49:47] and watch him change
[49:52] the voice of man rather
[49:56] and God didn't name the animals right
[49:58] brother Lewis
[50:01] Adam named the animal
[50:04] God didn't name him
[50:06] the voice of man brother would speak and
[50:09] say call the cattle this way call the
[50:12] Sheep over to this pastor call the
[50:14] fishes to the water see he had Dominion
[50:18] everything obeyed him
[50:22] look what that spiritual man in the
[50:24] garden had
[50:27] amen had Dominion
[50:29] now let's pick up some wording
[50:32] as we continue in the process
[50:35] of looking at some things go ahead with
[50:37] number six which is Hebrews chapter 4.
[50:39] paragraph 2 29 230.
[50:45] and he's talking about
[50:47] the actual this life in anything that
[50:50] begins has an end and eternal without a
[50:52] beginning Etc
[50:54] he said was God a man certainly
[51:00] you know it took a long time
[51:08] to get people to think about
[51:12] Melchizedek was a man
[51:15] I remember those days
[51:19] I'm talking about the people of the
[51:20] message since I've been around
[51:23] okay
[51:27] when they say Melchizedek you remember
[51:29] they said to brother Brown said
[51:31] that wasn't God
[51:36] he said yeah he said he was even a man
[51:41] then you go about Hebrews 7 4 or what
[51:44] where somewhere right in there where it
[51:46] says the man the Melchizedek
[51:53] it took a long time to get beat into
[51:54] people 's mind that you
[51:56] about man and God
[52:03] what was God
[52:06] was God a man certainly
[52:09] let us make man in our own image
[52:12] what was God
[52:14] a theophany a body
[52:19] and their man was made
[52:21] like that
[52:25] a man was made like that
[52:28] he's talking about God
[52:30] and put over the garden
[52:32] but there was no man to till the soil in
[52:34] the senses then he created man Out of
[52:36] the Dust of the earth Etc
[52:38] and God the theophany come down and was
[52:41] made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem
[52:45] the man
[52:46] you didn't have any trouble bringing it
[52:48] down to the correct order did you
[52:51] but he talks about this
[52:57] and we used it while ago and he talked
[52:58] about him being a spiritual being
[53:01] we talked about him being a spirit man
[53:04] from the quotes
[53:06] now he talks about a theophany
[53:11] how real do you think a theophany is
[53:17] I'll show you where I'm going don't mind
[53:19] at all I hope you think on it
[53:21] and brother random saw those people
[53:22] beyond the curtain of time
[53:27] he could feel them
[53:32] he said they had senses he said they
[53:35] even had intelligence
[53:38] that was their theophany
[53:42] we model to think about how real things
[53:44] really are
[53:47] and we might begin to comprehend the
[53:50] reality of God
[53:57] go ahead to the next one which is
[53:59] in the same message as Hebrews chapter
[54:02] 2.
[54:05] now the logos that went out of God which
[54:08] was the the logos all this being
[54:10] deformed into a body shape and this body
[54:13] shape was called in the scholars
[54:15] teaching logos
[54:17] the logos that went out of God in other
[54:20] words a better word for it was what we
[54:23] call it theophany
[54:25] now watch him
[54:26] theophany is a human body that's
[54:29] glorified
[54:31] now start right there you got a problem
[54:32] right
[54:34] but what does he say not exactly with
[54:36] flesh and blood like it will be in its
[54:38] glorified State all right now he's
[54:41] making a difference but it's a form but
[54:44] it is of a form of a human body that
[54:48] doesn't eat
[54:49] neither does it drink
[54:52] where do we get the Melchizedek with
[54:54] that one
[54:58] right but it's it's a body
[55:00] the body that's waiting for us as soon
[55:02] as we leave this one now in there we
[55:05] enter into that body and that's the kind
[55:08] of body that God was
[55:12] for he said let us make man in our own
[55:15] image
[55:17] in her likeness
[55:23] is your God real
[55:31] remember the key that he's
[55:34] and you'll find it even in beyond the
[55:35] curtain of time
[55:37] when they said here we don't eat
[55:42] but around him and say
[55:44] look at that male chatted it said he ate
[55:46] a cave
[55:49] drank some milk
[55:52] but then he'll declare that it was a
[55:54] theophany that was there
[55:58] and it was
[56:00] sure
[56:03] see the theophany was on the inside of a
[56:05] flesh
[56:07] the flesh was created is that what the
[56:10] prophet said
[56:14] he said he just went over and looked out
[56:16] and said here Gabriel step into that one
[56:18] Michael step into that one he said not
[56:21] just step into this one
[56:24] see the outside man
[56:27] the flesh is what ate the case
[56:30] the Inside Man didn't have to eat
[56:36] so we spread around his right
[56:40] well she has a dick did eat because how
[56:42] can you separate that man that you're
[56:43] looking at they're sitting there looking
[56:44] at you
[56:46] you can't separate him
[56:48] you're looking at a human man
[56:55] I remember Aaron made a statement back a
[56:57] long time ago and I want him to find
[56:58] that if he has the quote
[57:00] but he said God just simply sprinkle
[57:03] flesh over to theophany and he walked
[57:05] out
[57:06] but uh
[57:07] there I can't find that exact quote
[57:10] maybe he can and we'll give it to us but
[57:12] I know we made that statement years ago
[57:13] you know I believe it I believe he just
[57:16] sprinkled over that flesh
[57:17] I mean over that
[57:19] theophany
[57:24] he just sprinkled flesh over it and just
[57:25] walked down right
[57:30] right then brother Dale
[57:33] you must believe the theophany of man is
[57:35] the soul of man
[57:38] all right
[57:39] and that
[57:41] that soul of man is real
[57:48] well that's exactly what I believe
[57:55] you see right there that man was
[57:57] standing there
[57:58] eating that calf and things
[58:01] but if he wanted to he could just step
[58:04] out of that flesh
[58:06] and just leave that flesh
[58:09] and there he stands looking at it
[58:12] because you're talking about God you're
[58:13] not talking about idiotic stupidities of
[58:16] you and I
[58:19] you're talking about something real
[58:22] and right around and let those people
[58:24] beyond the curtain of time
[58:27] he failed them
[58:29] he said now even let me explain it to
[58:31] you he said
[58:32] women he said but let me tell you
[58:34] something over there that's been taken
[58:35] away that he wanted to make sure we
[58:38] understood that
[58:39] right
[58:41] but look
[58:46] the kind of body that God was
[58:50] for he said let us make man and our
[58:52] enemies and our likeness
[58:55] theophany is a human body that's
[58:57] glorified
[58:58] not exactly where Flesh and Blood like
[59:00] it will be in the glorified state but
[59:02] it's a form of a human body
[59:10] now make it look comical
[59:12] you know inside of you we'll read it
[59:14] right around said today is a man
[59:18] he said now do you believe that I got it
[59:20] in my notes either today or next week
[59:22] one
[59:25] well what size is that man that's inside
[59:28] of you wait
[59:31] it wouldn't be 50 years old
[59:37] but who would it look like
[59:39] well it looks like brother Cauley they
[59:41] just flipped a coin and got them mixed
[59:43] up when they birthed and
[59:44] none exactly
[59:47] right come on uh
[59:51] who does that look like
[59:55] that you'll get around one of these days
[59:57] and realize what I said this morning is
[59:59] true that soul that you are is more real
[1:00:02] than your body are your spirit or
[1:00:05] anything this away
[1:00:10] because even in the Fallen estate you
[1:00:13] still have the creative ability handed
[1:00:16] down from almighty God to do great
[1:00:19] things
[1:00:24] look at the things man has achieved in
[1:00:26] the past
[1:00:28] 50 years 100 years
[1:00:34] one of these days you'll realize
[1:00:37] this thing got more to do with it than
[1:00:38] what we think
[1:00:40] go ahead to number eight
[1:00:46] taking them questions and answers on
[1:00:48] Hebrews 3. what do we do well my dear
[1:00:50] sainted brother my dear sainted sister
[1:00:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:57] when God created you in His image
[1:01:06] I I thought it created in Genesis 1
[1:01:09] 26-27.
[1:01:16] well Genesis 1 26-27
[1:01:22] is before the world
[1:01:27] he said no it was a sixth day I'd like
[1:01:30] for you to read of the Animal Creations
[1:01:31] when when you get a chance
[1:01:34] uh when was the animals created
[1:01:39] fifth day
[1:01:41] Man was created the sixth day but I'd
[1:01:44] like for you to read those two and
[1:01:46] declare that unto me
[1:01:48] because seemingly when you get over into
[1:01:52] talking of the sixth day
[1:01:55] that you you come in to a little
[1:01:58] difference of a way of stating things
[1:02:03] read them
[1:02:05] and you'll begin to wonder which day did
[1:02:08] the animals come
[1:02:11] because on the sixth day they were told
[1:02:13] to multiply
[1:02:15] but they wouldn't on the fifth day they
[1:02:17] were created okay that'll solved
[1:02:20] think about it
[1:02:26] before the foundation of the world when
[1:02:28] God created You In His Image or created
[1:02:31] The Man In His Image
[1:02:33] I love him to correct it like that
[1:02:35] because
[1:02:36] as a sinner could read that and it sure
[1:02:38] wouldn't fit too good
[1:02:41] all right so he says the man in the
[1:02:43] image and created the woman in the image
[1:02:46] of the man
[1:02:47] do you remember that
[1:02:49] when Adam was
[1:02:51] put in flesh
[1:02:53] he was lonely
[1:02:55] you know why
[1:03:03] because Eve was still in theophany
[1:03:06] that's what brother Branham says
[1:03:13] he said she was in him in creation
[1:03:17] spiritual said she was in him in
[1:03:20] creation natural
[1:03:23] then one of the people of this message
[1:03:24] want to preach so much about the hybrid
[1:03:27] woman
[1:03:28] making her a piece of dog meat and we're
[1:03:31] a great big old porterhouse today man we
[1:03:33] we filmed
[1:03:38] get away from that brother Dale would
[1:03:39] they call him
[1:03:41] watch what he said the man in His image
[1:03:45] and created a woman in the image of the
[1:03:47] man
[1:03:47] for the glory of the man
[1:03:49] he made a theophany just like himself
[1:03:52] when he said let us to the creatures
[1:03:54] that he had made
[1:03:57] now we've got four things that he uses
[1:03:59] it
[1:04:02] four things he uses about speaking was
[1:04:04] something now he talks about the
[1:04:06] creatures that he made he looked at the
[1:04:08] animals and said now hey look you need
[1:04:10] somebody to lead you
[1:04:14] I'm not going to go down here and be
[1:04:16] around here all the time I'm going to
[1:04:17] turn you over to somebody else
[1:04:20] he said let us
[1:04:22] what do y'all want him to be
[1:04:28] monkey says I'd like for him to be
[1:04:29] upright that's brother Louise when he's
[1:04:31] going the other day I was just sitting
[1:04:32] there I had to let me up here for a few
[1:04:35] minutes
[1:04:36] you know when the monkey says stand him
[1:04:37] up like me
[1:04:45] a lot of your smart animals would say
[1:04:46] make him like me I'm smarter than they
[1:04:49] are
[1:04:50] okay I sat there wanting to preach but
[1:04:53] he had the flow worship
[1:04:55] all right I enjoyed it he said let us to
[1:04:58] the creatures that he made let us make
[1:05:01] man in our own image in our likeness
[1:05:04] a theophany God had never become flesh
[1:05:07] yet
[1:05:08] he was in a theophany
[1:05:13] when Man was created God had never come
[1:05:15] into flesh yet he was in a theophany
[1:05:19] and Moses saw him Moses cried Lord let
[1:05:22] me see you
[1:05:24] all right
[1:05:26] what about it
[1:05:28] get too much information
[1:05:34] go ahead with number nine
[1:05:37] this was taken from questions and
[1:05:39] answers on Hebrews and
[1:05:41] that's where the Saints will be in a
[1:05:43] thousand years and what kind of a body
[1:05:45] they'll have
[1:05:46] so go ahead and roll it on up to
[1:05:49] now when the logos went out of God which
[1:05:51] was God coming from this one big
[1:05:54] Fountain into a body in the form of of a
[1:05:57] man and it made the logos which we call
[1:05:59] theophany
[1:06:01] now if you take the theophany when you
[1:06:03] are looking at that that's a man now
[1:06:06] that we now that's where we were in the
[1:06:08] beginning
[1:06:09] yep
[1:06:12] okay
[1:06:14] now you do not understand it now that's
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:17] but you was back there in the beginning
[1:06:19] that way
[1:06:20] when man made when God made Man In His
[1:06:24] Image he made him at the offney
[1:06:26] and he only placed him in flesh
[1:06:30] when God made Man In His Image in his
[1:06:33] likeness they were in Genesis 2 then you
[1:06:36] know you go from one to 128.
[1:06:39] then God brought a man a little lower
[1:06:41] down and put him in an animal life first
[1:06:44] man brought a little lower
[1:06:47] you know first man theophany Spirit man
[1:06:50] brought a little lower
[1:06:53] a little lower down and put him in
[1:06:55] animal of life that's his body just like
[1:06:58] the animal showed that he could till the
[1:07:00] soul and could touch that theophany
[1:07:02] doesn't touch it doesn't see taste smell
[1:07:04] here these senses that we have so God
[1:07:08] put man down there in order to to touch
[1:07:11] and to be
[1:07:15] mm-hmm
[1:07:18] he said but you just crossed yourself
[1:07:20] because you said a theophany
[1:07:22] beyond the curtain of time had senses
[1:07:26] are you listening that close
[1:07:30] sure but right before I said absences
[1:07:31] right are you talking about theology
[1:07:33] didn't have it
[1:07:37] just remember those beyond the curtain
[1:07:39] of time had come in there because of
[1:07:41] calvary
[1:07:46] right hold that point
[1:07:50] and as you walk through the Garden of
[1:07:51] Eden first as a theophany like the holy
[1:07:54] spirit is in here now walking in here it
[1:07:57] led the animal a lot it controlled
[1:07:59] everything
[1:08:01] all right
[1:08:07] go to number 10 let me read a few then
[1:08:09] we'll
[1:08:10] this is taken from Souls that are in
[1:08:12] prison now
[1:08:14] what made us different from other
[1:08:16] mammals
[1:08:18] that God put a soul upon us
[1:08:22] and read these with me
[1:08:24] now don't get so carnal or so great
[1:08:29] revelated
[1:08:32] that you think brother Dale he just says
[1:08:35] there that he put a soul on him
[1:08:40] well that's a great Revelation he didn't
[1:08:42] have a soul he just put a soul
[1:08:48] go on
[1:08:50] I didn't get where I'm at by arguing
[1:08:52] over them things
[1:08:54] that God put a soul upon us I'll just
[1:08:56] let him read to you in a little bit what
[1:08:57] he said now the other mammals don't have
[1:09:00] to wear clothes other animals has to
[1:09:02] wear clothes to hide his shame
[1:09:05] but us
[1:09:08] we're the only one that does because we
[1:09:10] have a soul
[1:09:13] we see God in the beginning knew what a
[1:09:16] man would be like
[1:09:18] all right
[1:09:20] number 11 Oneness
[1:09:23] 1962.
[1:09:26] he's talking about the man and the lamb
[1:09:29] and how it had to be because he was a
[1:09:31] human being with a soul
[1:09:34] and the Sheep has no soul
[1:09:36] see nothing has a soul but man
[1:09:39] God put he's an animal form that's true
[1:09:43] but he put a soul on him that's what
[1:09:46] made him differ from the animals he
[1:09:49] knowed right and wrong when his soul
[1:09:51] come on him
[1:09:52] but he remember when God created man in
[1:09:56] his own image and then he became a
[1:09:58] living Soul see he became that knowing
[1:10:02] right from wrong go ahead
[1:10:05] the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:10:08] preached in 1951.
[1:10:11] and then after he got all his creation
[1:10:13] made he said let us plural make man in
[1:10:17] our own plural on image now if God is
[1:10:20] unseen
[1:10:22] if the logos was in the form just
[1:10:24] mythically speaking drama in the form of
[1:10:28] a Halo then it's supernatural
[1:10:32] then he had to make a man in his own
[1:10:35] image
[1:10:36] so you didn't want to just leave him you
[1:10:38] know we're not to be just a spirit
[1:10:40] because God is not a spirit you know not
[1:10:42] to stay that way
[1:10:44] John 4 says that God is a spirit and he
[1:10:46] had to make a spirit man and he brought
[1:10:48] it down now
[1:10:49] what
[1:10:51] there's deity
[1:10:54] cannot be seen
[1:10:57] now he talking about man just as much as
[1:11:00] God
[1:11:02] deity is the supernatural then he brings
[1:11:05] it on down from a sacred hello to a
[1:11:07] little white light something that's more
[1:11:09] visible that's man you give him the
[1:11:12] rulership over the kingdom
[1:11:16] using the word deity
[1:11:21] you didn't have any problem using it did
[1:11:23] he
[1:11:24] go on to the next
[1:11:28] oh yeah
[1:11:30] that's paragraph 35 there's quicker than
[1:11:33] I am we're doing good
[1:11:34] says God put a soul in a man
[1:11:37] now the one guy said it should put a
[1:11:38] soul on a man so which one is it in a
[1:11:40] man or on a man or put a man beside the
[1:11:42] man or what a man
[1:11:45] this white cloud deity came down not in
[1:11:49] the animal in the man
[1:11:54] we're going to get to Blasphemous names
[1:11:56] when we ever do where brother Brown says
[1:11:58] that he breathe especially into Adam's
[1:12:00] nostrils eternal life
[1:12:04] if he put 126 and 27 into 2 7 then it
[1:12:08] had to be
[1:12:09] eternal life right now if they can see
[1:12:12] they can go out and play all they want
[1:12:13] to about the bones and the things and do
[1:12:15] what they want to
[1:12:16] go on
[1:12:19] questions and answers this is number 13.
[1:12:24] look Jesus come to manifest the father
[1:12:26] look in the beginning God made man and
[1:12:29] his own image is that right well what is
[1:12:31] God
[1:12:32] a spirit
[1:12:34] Saint John the fourth chapter Jesus
[1:12:36] speaking to the woman as well he said
[1:12:37] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:12:39] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:12:41] truth is that right if God made man in
[1:12:43] his own image what kind of a man did he
[1:12:46] make then a spirit man
[1:12:49] that's what he made
[1:12:51] another man no man to tell the soil and
[1:12:53] he put the spirit of man in this animal
[1:12:56] man here and he become a living soul
[1:12:59] now that's the difference between a man
[1:13:01] and the animal
[1:13:03] the animal don't build automobiles he
[1:13:05] doesn't do things like that to help his
[1:13:07] living
[1:13:08] and so forth like that he's an animal
[1:13:10] dumb brute he hasn't got a soul
[1:13:13] he can't read or write he can't talk
[1:13:16] speak he's a dumb brute but a man in
[1:13:19] flesh like a brute
[1:13:21] but a man is in flesh like a brute but
[1:13:24] he's got a soul of God in him what makes
[1:13:27] him immortal
[1:13:28] watch him and he can invent look what he
[1:13:32] can do he's on almost on the equal with
[1:13:35] God because he's the son of God even in
[1:13:40] his Fallen estate he's wonderful
[1:13:44] look at him
[1:13:45] think about what he's saying
[1:13:50] go to the next room number 14. Lord
[1:13:53] Grace
[1:13:55] the animal can't give the human blood
[1:13:58] the animal can't do it because his life
[1:14:00] is a different life
[1:14:01] and an animal has a life but not a soul
[1:14:03] an animal is a living being written on a
[1:14:06] soul but God put soul on man so then my
[1:14:10] soul what is the soul the nature
[1:14:13] of the spirit
[1:14:16] it's wonderful right
[1:14:19] let's see how they got two more
[1:14:26] message you must be born again
[1:14:29] a soul good or bad death doesn't change
[1:14:31] it
[1:14:32] I had a lot of scripture wrote down here
[1:14:34] on this one that I want to comment on
[1:14:37] what is the soul
[1:14:39] what is a soul it's you
[1:14:43] you are a soul
[1:14:48] the part you evidently read Webster
[1:14:49] didn't he
[1:14:51] you are a soul the part inside of you
[1:14:54] and when you die
[1:14:55] and what shape that sold in that's the
[1:14:58] way it goes It goes to its destination
[1:15:01] you couldn't pull it up no matter how
[1:15:03] much you do for it that Soul's got to be
[1:15:05] changed here it'll be born again all
[1:15:08] right going to the next
[1:15:10] this is the Inside Man
[1:15:14] paragraph 119.
[1:15:16] the inside band preaching 53 12 12.
[1:15:20] would you do you ever think that inside
[1:15:22] of our body is another man
[1:15:25] did you know that that there's another
[1:15:28] man inside of our body
[1:15:33] and that's her spirit man did you ever
[1:15:36] think of that brother Ryan
[1:15:39] do you think of that brother Ryan
[1:15:43] to see what yes sir that how this is in
[1:15:46] here the Inside Man and this Inside Man
[1:15:49] if if it is of god it's the spirit of
[1:15:53] God is that right that's inside our
[1:15:55] being now my finger could not move
[1:15:58] without something making it move it
[1:16:00] works from an intelligence here and
[1:16:02] things like know how to think about it
[1:16:04] it all moves but that's what he's trying
[1:16:06] to explain what in your body he's a
[1:16:09] different person
[1:16:11] person yeah
[1:16:14] let's read this one and then we'll
[1:16:17] maybe read one or two more but we'll go
[1:16:19] ahead this is paragraph 279 in Hebrews
[1:16:21] chapter 2.
[1:16:24] now when man become into that body
[1:16:27] he had a control of all the fishes and
[1:16:29] the fowls and the beasts of the field
[1:16:30] then there was no man until the soil
[1:16:32] Genesis 2. he done made man made male
[1:16:36] and female but there was no man until
[1:16:38] the soul then God made man out of dust
[1:16:41] to the Earth he gave him a hand like a
[1:16:43] chimpanzee he'd give him a foot like a
[1:16:45] bear he made him on the image and this
[1:16:49] Earthly body is in the image of animal
[1:16:52] life
[1:16:54] all right wrote it on up
[1:16:58] but the difference between an animal and
[1:17:01] a man
[1:17:03] God put a soul in a man
[1:17:05] and he didn't put it in the animal
[1:17:08] because the soul that was in the man
[1:17:13] is that theophany
[1:17:17] Soul losing a man is that theophany
[1:17:24] what about it
[1:17:26] what do you think about it
[1:17:33] go ahead with 17.
[1:17:36] this is taken from adoption Paul said in
[1:17:39] 1960.
[1:17:42] it does not yet appear just exactly what
[1:17:44] kind of a body we'll have but we know
[1:17:46] we'll have a body like he is what did he
[1:17:48] ever have that theophany body yes sir
[1:17:50] when he died the Bible said he is a
[1:17:54] personal pronoun again
[1:17:57] not two or three people right he went to
[1:18:01] hell and preached to the souls in prison
[1:18:03] hallelujah how did he do it he had sense
[1:18:06] of feeling he had a sense of hearing he
[1:18:08] had sensitive speech he preached with
[1:18:10] that same kind of a body I saw those
[1:18:12] glorified ones in the other night
[1:18:19] he preached to the souls that were in
[1:18:21] hell that repented not in the long
[1:18:23] suffering in the days of Noah when he
[1:18:25] when he rose on the Easter it was not
[1:18:27] possible that the body should see
[1:18:29] corruption because David the prophet
[1:18:30] foreshaw not leave his soul in Hell
[1:18:32] neither will I suffer my Holy One see
[1:18:34] corruption or my flesh shall not rest
[1:18:36] and hold because he will not leave my
[1:18:38] flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will
[1:18:40] not leave my soul in Hell neither will
[1:18:42] he leave my my Holy One see one see
[1:18:47] corruption and in 72 hours and on 72
[1:18:50] hour before corruption could set in that
[1:18:54] theophany that body that went and
[1:18:57] preached to the souls that were in
[1:18:59] prison that repented not in the long
[1:19:01] suffering in the days of Noah rose again
[1:19:04] and the Mortal put on immortality and he
[1:19:07] stood and ate and he told him that he
[1:19:10] told us that he was a man
[1:19:14] what about it did Jesus have that soul
[1:19:17] theophany
[1:19:20] what about it
[1:19:24] look at the next one
[1:19:28] taken from the entombment
[1:19:31] priest in 1957 420. here he goes where
[1:19:34] did he leave when he left
[1:19:36] the Bible said he ascended he went and
[1:19:39] preached to the souls that were in
[1:19:41] prison that repented not in the long
[1:19:43] suffering in the days of Noah
[1:19:45] his soul his Spirit his theophany of his
[1:19:49] own being went down
[1:19:54] his soul his Spirit his theophany of his
[1:19:58] own being
[1:20:00] that's pretty sure isn't it
[1:20:02] pretty sure of one thing
[1:20:05] your soul your spirit and your theophany
[1:20:07] is one being
[1:20:17] his soul was in Hell preaching to them
[1:20:21] he was in his theophany again
[1:20:29] just leave it there
[1:20:32] well let me show you the drawing bring
[1:20:34] up the drawing my brothers and then
[1:20:36] we'll show you a little addition
[1:20:38] you remember each time a little bit of
[1:20:40] addition
[1:20:42] pull it up brother
[1:20:43] you remember how we kept bringing out
[1:20:45] that all this back here is gonna have to
[1:20:48] be over here
[1:20:49] so whatever's here is going to be over
[1:20:51] there
[1:20:52] so over here we see that all of these
[1:20:55] attributes
[1:20:57] all these equal the nature of God
[1:21:00] which is the life of God
[1:21:03] the very nature of his being
[1:21:07] the soul
[1:21:09] his soul is his very nature of his being
[1:21:14] our soul is our very nature of our being
[1:21:19] souls in prison he said the nature of
[1:21:21] your soul is God if you're born again
[1:21:25] if not
[1:21:27] is of the devil
[1:21:30] so then we'll get into that to bring it
[1:21:32] on down but I want to talk about his
[1:21:33] soul now the next will be your soul
[1:21:37] that'll be the next Point next weekend
[1:21:39] your soul
[1:21:43] but think about it
[1:21:49] just think about the soul of an
[1:21:51] individual
[1:21:54] this body's not in the image of God it's
[1:21:56] in the image of the animals the spirit
[1:21:59] is just a mediator between
[1:22:01] the soul and the spirit I mean the body
[1:22:05] animals have that
[1:22:09] you know they have a spirit life
[1:22:12] me but they don't have a soul
[1:22:14] but a human being has a soul or really
[1:22:16] has not had us though that's what he is
[1:22:20] he is the soul God doesn't just have a
[1:22:23] soul he is a soul
[1:22:26] all of this has been him coming into
[1:22:29] being to reveal himself
[1:22:32] not him creating as we look at it and
[1:22:35] he's standing up looking and he slings
[1:22:37] off this one and there goes one person
[1:22:38] there goes another person
[1:22:40] remember
[1:22:42] the man that he's speaking about in the
[1:22:44] garden that led the animals
[1:22:47] and that man was put in flesh
[1:22:50] he fell
[1:22:53] he fell from that Holy estate
[1:22:56] that he was once dwelling in
[1:23:00] he didn't lose the eternal life out of
[1:23:02] his soul he couldn't do that
[1:23:03] that's right
[1:23:05] but I'd invite you to remember one point
[1:23:08] if you're going to talk about a
[1:23:10] beginning of a creation
[1:23:15] everyone except Jesus Christ
[1:23:18] Begins full grown
[1:23:22] the world Began full grown
[1:23:25] the animals Began full grown
[1:23:29] the man Began full grown
[1:23:33] but to make a way God had to change that
[1:23:37] and Jesus had to come in the wound of a
[1:23:39] mother
[1:23:40] to be the beginning of the creation of
[1:23:42] God
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:45] you know that brother Brown said we're
[1:23:47] just a continuation of that creation
[1:23:52] what do you think about it come on
[1:23:53] musician what do you think about it is
[1:23:56] your God real
[1:23:59] can you tie together the theophany now
[1:24:01] and the soul
[1:24:03] to see that that's what it really is
[1:24:06] the soul is that really that theophany
[1:24:09] they were standing there and God
[1:24:11] sprinkled flesh over that
[1:24:15] the offney
[1:24:21] and there was the man we call
[1:24:23] Melchizedek
[1:24:26] but he didn't sprinkle flesh over a
[1:24:28] theophany
[1:24:30] in Jesus Christ
[1:24:34] he was the theophany
[1:24:37] he was the flesh
[1:24:40] he said a body that has created me
[1:24:45] that was a body God created that was not
[1:24:47] a
[1:24:48] just another human being because God had
[1:24:51] already stopped
[1:24:52] I'm saying something if you'll listen
[1:24:54] God had already stopped you remember in
[1:24:57] a quote we gave the prophet 336 Church
[1:24:59] age book where he said is he's the
[1:25:01] author of a finished physical creation
[1:25:06] see that was the last man he made
[1:25:10] you know mortal
[1:25:13] it could speak unto a body and step into
[1:25:15] it and go but that man couldn't die for
[1:25:18] you and I
[1:25:21] melchized it couldn't die
[1:25:24] he was not kin folks right he had to
[1:25:27] change the whole case and bring it to a
[1:25:29] man that could be kin folks to us
[1:25:32] and when it did then it brings it down
[1:25:34] to a life to where you and I can
[1:25:36] understand a little about salvation
[1:25:40] and see that that man
[1:25:46] that he created back there
[1:25:49] was one person
[1:25:53] Genesis 1 26 and 27 is one person
[1:26:02] well of God if that is the theophany and
[1:26:05] you have the soul of God then
[1:26:13] we might find out what the new birth is
[1:26:15] one day
[1:26:19] if God can sprinkle over a man and bring
[1:26:21] flesh he can take care of our old soul
[1:26:25] our old being of what we are
[1:26:28] and make it eternal
[1:26:31] a stand
[1:26:36] anybody have a need the Alders open what
[1:26:39] we got
[1:26:49] a number
[1:27:16] and she won't have that anymore
[1:27:18] it'll all be finished all right
[1:27:22] Lord Jesus
[1:27:30] because by your stripes she's healed and
[1:27:33] we believe it and we just ask you to
[1:27:35] reach down down touch her father and
[1:27:38] deliver her from those attacks that she
[1:27:40] has
[1:27:41] we thank you father
[1:27:43] in Jesus name amen
[1:27:48] I
[1:27:51] am
[1:28:06] fine
[1:28:25] foreign
[1:28:31] heard our brother Satan put upon him a
[1:28:33] problem with his foot he's been able to
[1:28:36] overcome that maybe a little crippled
[1:28:38] but that's no problem he's overcoming
[1:28:40] now Satan is working up the legs to make
[1:28:42] his knees to be people and things and we
[1:28:45] just ask you father to reach down and
[1:28:48] touch our brother and deliver him from
[1:28:50] these things truly Lord we know and have
[1:28:54] a feeling for her brother because of our
[1:28:56] knees hurting and oh Lord we just ask
[1:28:58] him that you'd reach down and touch our
[1:29:00] brother and that we lord would would
[1:29:02] believe you and say that by your stripes
[1:29:06] we are healed and we thank you for it in
[1:29:09] Jesus name just go confessing it brother
[1:29:12] go confession it say it
[1:29:17] say it and just keep on going
[1:29:20] believe it
[1:29:22] because we believe that
[1:29:24] anybody else
[1:29:28] see Satan is trying to hinder every one
[1:29:31] of us with old age
[1:29:35] part of life
[1:29:38] listen another day to the prophet I
[1:29:42] think a minute what the message it is
[1:29:43] but he said we can't ask God to take
[1:29:46] away this old age
[1:29:47] he said because that's part of the curse
[1:29:50] when he said we can ask him to take care
[1:29:53] of us while we're doing it while we're
[1:29:55] here you know if we can believe it we
[1:29:58] don't have to give into it all right
[1:30:09] you heard her brother Lord we just ask
[1:30:12] you to reach down and touch you now and
[1:30:15] delivering father we love you and we
[1:30:18] thank you thank you for touching our
[1:30:20] brother
[1:30:22] in Jesus name amen
[1:30:25] let's go thanking him for it
[1:30:27] Go thanking him for it and just saying
[1:30:30] thank you Lord
[1:30:33] you have a need to start thanking him
[1:30:35] right brother Ray he said he's been
[1:30:38] praying that the Lord said why don't you
[1:30:40] just thank me for it
[1:30:43] well just start thanking him because
[1:30:45] that's what the prophet says
[1:30:47] he said thank God for it
[1:30:51] say it
[1:30:53] just walk on
[1:30:57] walk on into it
[1:31:04] yeah
[1:31:10] it's Jesus Loves Me Do you love him
[1:31:25] amen you love him
[1:31:28] he's great isn't he to think of all that
[1:31:31] he has allowed you and I to see
[1:31:34] even if it's just mentally
[1:31:36] you know even if it's just mentally
[1:31:41] thank God
[1:31:43] for mental fines
[1:31:45] you know what you can only get spiritual
[1:31:46] about getting mental for her
[1:31:48] you don't get spiritual in the middle
[1:31:51] you get something mental
[1:31:53] and then you get it spiritually
[1:31:55] you place it in the correct order right
[1:31:57] amen just remember to pray one for
[1:31:59] another member Aaron Wednesday's sister
[1:32:01] Anna
[1:32:04] I'm a Gilman stupid a lot of times but I
[1:32:07] tell you when it comes to the physical
[1:32:08] things that we have and I tell Al I said
[1:32:11] Al I don't tell you all the problems
[1:32:13] that I have I don't tell you how I hurt
[1:32:15] all the time I said but you know what's
[1:32:17] I don't know whether we sing that little
[1:32:19] song here or not stomping yeah you know
[1:32:22] be like a little child and just sing and
[1:32:25] stomp him under our feet you know and
[1:32:27] say hey I know I'm getting older but by
[1:32:31] granny that doesn't mean I had to act
[1:32:33] real old right you know right be young
[1:32:36] exactly
[1:32:38] being old and acting old is two
[1:32:40] different things right
[1:32:43] I've seen people that were 16 that acted
[1:32:45] old and I've seen people it was 90
[1:32:48] didn't even act old at all you know
[1:32:51] that's a good way to do it I mean
[1:32:54] anybody else before we go
[1:32:56] never pray one for another and I will go
[1:32:59] ahead and make a statement I've been
[1:33:01] aiming to make for quite a while here at
[1:33:04] the church we're going through some
[1:33:06] changes and some things it's doing you
[1:33:09] know in the church and and all getting
[1:33:11] it set and all like that because we
[1:33:14] don't know how much longer we're going
[1:33:15] to be here foreign
[1:33:18] we don't know what the next day is going
[1:33:20] to be
[1:33:21] and who worries
[1:33:23] it's no concern of mine it's no problem
[1:33:25] I don't have no fear you have fear
[1:33:27] Brother David going tomorrow
[1:33:29] I hurt I fear my neck hurting worse and
[1:33:32] I do anything it sure hurts so far out
[1:33:35] of me
[1:33:36] I don't have no problems with what the
[1:33:38] doctor says and what all of that says I
[1:33:41] just believe it and say by Stripes I'm
[1:33:44] Healed
[1:33:45] and no matter then whether it takes the
[1:33:47] doctor to
[1:33:49] help me
[1:33:51] why would brother Branham tell that man
[1:33:52] to go down there to that doctor he knows
[1:33:55] how to operate
[1:33:57] you can you can visualize in your mind
[1:33:59] that will brought around him knew that
[1:34:01] he couldn't have faith to get it and all
[1:34:02] that may be true
[1:34:04] but you know true there's a lot of Truth
[1:34:06] to just going to the doctor
[1:34:09] I remember years ago some brothers would
[1:34:11] quote there is a direct quote from
[1:34:13] Brother Brown where he said you do not
[1:34:15] have a right to come to the altar to be
[1:34:16] prayed for it to you go to the doctor
[1:34:17] first you need that quote
[1:34:20] it's there and that's almost as close as
[1:34:22] I can get it
[1:34:23] well now we don't get up here and say no
[1:34:25] now you go back till you go to the
[1:34:27] doctor because that's what the brother's
[1:34:28] doing
[1:34:30] back there in the 60s and early 70s get
[1:34:34] on back to you go to doctor now that's
[1:34:36] kind of silly we went by the house one
[1:34:39] day over to my family and they said
[1:34:40] where are you going I said we're going
[1:34:42] to the church and we're going to get to
[1:34:44] forget to pray for her because he's sick
[1:34:46] I said what are you gonna do we're going
[1:34:47] to take them to doctor
[1:34:49] but I said yes because we're going to go
[1:34:51] pray for him first because we're going
[1:34:52] to church
[1:34:54] well
[1:34:55] there's nothing wrong with going to the
[1:34:57] doctors
[1:34:59] the wrong is when you don't understand
[1:35:04] just tell that doctor said hey Doc you
[1:35:07] can't heal me of a toothache
[1:35:11] but I appreciate you
[1:35:14] thank you
[1:35:18] God gave us doctors when he knew that
[1:35:20] there wouldn't be enough enough belief
[1:35:21] into mankind to help us but when we
[1:35:24] depend upon the doctor
[1:35:26] now more than we do the God now we're
[1:35:29] going wrong
[1:35:31] just say bias drops I'm Healed
[1:35:34] and just walk home
[1:35:37] you know you might walk yourself into it
[1:35:40] true
[1:35:42] you might come right into it amen but
[1:35:44] just remember those things and and pray
[1:35:46] that the Lord would bless us as we go
[1:35:49] through kind of a little change and hear
[1:35:50] of what we're doing because we're
[1:35:52] changing over the building part and
[1:35:53] doing it just that and getting
[1:35:55] everything in order to where I don't
[1:35:57] want any trouble when I'm planning on
[1:36:00] being around here either for the change
[1:36:01] or being around here about 20 more years
[1:36:05] that just make me about 95 4. so I'm
[1:36:09] planning on being around here at least
[1:36:10] 20 more years
[1:36:12] so we're trying to get everything set in
[1:36:13] order to work in the handle 20 years
[1:36:15] from now you don't have to come down to
[1:36:17] the nursing home and ask me what you
[1:36:19] want done
[1:36:20] I don't make a lot of people do and you
[1:36:22] know what I mean we just get where they
[1:36:24] can't do nothing and just you know and
[1:36:27] you'll have it all set in order we're
[1:36:28] doing that and also I've been aiming to
[1:36:30] make this announcement weight has always
[1:36:32] been the assistant pastor of course the
[1:36:35] other brothers accounting assistant
[1:36:36] pastors also because of their helps and
[1:36:39] their doing but as of today I'm putting
[1:36:42] him into the position to where he is the
[1:36:44] junior pastor
[1:36:46] but I am still the senior pastor
[1:36:49] and when I'm out he's in charge
[1:36:52] all right because that's that's what's
[1:36:54] given you know that's the way I think it
[1:36:57] ought to be done and everything because
[1:37:00] I am the one that can do those things
[1:37:03] the pastor has the full sway of those
[1:37:05] authorities so I can do it now when I'm
[1:37:08] not here anymore you can vote all you
[1:37:10] want to
[1:37:12] but you're gonna have to put up with him
[1:37:14] until I get out of here
[1:37:16] so that'd be nice all right
[1:37:19] think on these things father we're not
[1:37:21] trying to become what could it be
[1:37:22] anything just being truthful Lord we're
[1:37:25] just putting everything into the bases
[1:37:27] that we can make sure that this church
[1:37:29] operates even though if you decided to
[1:37:32] take us off the scene that there would
[1:37:34] be no problem there wouldn't be no
[1:37:35] trouble wouldn't be no heartaches that
[1:37:37] the church would operate and just go
[1:37:38] right on because we believe in in you
[1:37:40] Lord and we thank you and we love you
[1:37:42] and we thank you we're not making any
[1:37:45] preparations
[1:37:46] we should have made preparations a long
[1:37:48] time ago Lord
[1:37:50] but we just being human we just roll
[1:37:52] along and wait
[1:37:54] you just have your way got each one take
[1:37:56] care of everybody on the way home bless
[1:37:59] each and every one in Jesus name amen
