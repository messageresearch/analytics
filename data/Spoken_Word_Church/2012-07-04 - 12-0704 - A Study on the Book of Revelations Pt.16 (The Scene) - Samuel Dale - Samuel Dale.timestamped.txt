[8:41] Revelations
[8:45] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[8:47] God gave unto him to show unto his
[8:49] servants things which must shortly come
[8:52] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[8:54] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[8:57] record of the word of God and the the
[8:59] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[9:02] things that he saw blessed is he that
[9:04] readeth and they that hear the words of
[9:06] this prophecy and keep those things
[9:09] which are written therein for the time
[9:12] is at hand and let's go over now to
[9:16] First
[9:18] Peter one starting at verse 9 receiving
[9:23] the end of your
[9:25] salvation even it's the end of your
[9:28] faith even the salvation of your
[9:30] souls of which salvation the prophets
[9:33] have inquired and searched diligently
[9:35] who prophesied of the grace that should
[9:37] come unto you searching are what or what
[9:40] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[9:42] which was in them did signify when it
[9:44] testified before him the sufferings of
[9:47] Christ and the glory that should follow
[9:50] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[9:53] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[9:56] the things which are now reported unto
[9:58] you by them that have preached the
[10:00] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[10:03] down from heaven which things the Angels
[10:05] desire to look into wherefore G up the
[10:08] loins of your mind be sober and hope to
[10:10] the end for the grace that is to be
[10:13] brought unto you at the revelation of
[10:17] Jesus Christ you may be seated to Lord
[10:19] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[10:22] word now this
[10:25] statement revelation of Jesus Christ
[10:28] appears three times in the Bible it's in
[10:31] Galatians 1 uh verse 12 by the
[10:34] revelation of Jesus Christ we read here
[10:37] in First Peter it says at the revelation
[10:39] of Jesus Christ and then in Revelations
[10:42] 1:1 we read the revelation of Jesus
[10:45] Christ now that's what we've been
[10:46] talking about it's not a
[10:50] u idea or thought it's a
[10:53] revelation and it must be revealed unto
[10:56] each one of our hearts and our lives all
[10:59] right
[11:01] now we took a lot of reading Sunday in
[11:04] the uh trying to read a lot Sunday
[11:09] afternoon of chapter 5 not reading the
[11:13] the U scripture part but reading the
[11:17] things brother brandom was saying about
[11:19] chapter 5 and U then we come to the
[11:23] point and we'll read it again in a
[11:24] minute where brother BR said this is the
[11:26] a
[11:27] scene it's not a verse by verse right
[11:30] all right so then we'll get down to it
[11:32] in a minute to see why it comes out to
[11:34] be that way but we tried to cover it and
[11:37] we read a lot now tonight we only have
[11:39] like four quotes So what I want to do is
[11:41] basically just uh speak about it and you
[11:45] know and and maybe help us to understand
[11:48] uh what we're talking about
[11:52] now we've been Revelations 5
[11:56] verse1 and that's all in the right hand
[11:58] of him him that sat on the throne a book
[12:00] written within and on the backside seal
[12:02] with Seven Seals now we're not going to
[12:05] be dealing with the part word that it's
[12:09] written within on the back side of the
[12:10] book Etc we'll take that up the Lord
[12:12] withing Sunday all we want to talk about
[12:14] tonight is one thing of what we we went
[12:18] through and go ahead and pull up number
[12:20] one on the notes brother and let's get
[12:22] these out of the way and then we can
[12:24] just speak on these things this is taken
[12:27] from uh Revelation 5 part 2 1961
[12:32] 618 paragraphs 79 and 80 now we find in
[12:37] that this first beginning of the chapter
[12:40] we find the the fifth chapter is just a
[12:42] TI Block it's a diamond hitch in other
[12:45] words something that pulls together
[12:47] fisons uh you can use the word breach
[12:51] all right yep breach would be the same
[12:53] form but you got to have something to
[12:55] come across and tie together in a breach
[12:58] but it is the same wording to where that
[13:00] you can understand it and see what's
[13:02] going on Tai hits that Diamond hits that
[13:05] ties a life part of the church age of
[13:08] the third chapter why because the
[13:10] Rapture comes at the end of the third
[13:12] chapter Revelation 4:1 we go up in the
[13:14] Rapture all right the fourth chapter
[13:17] tells what John was taken up into heaven
[13:21] and the fifth is prepare preparing for
[13:24] these all right we went through the
[13:26] seven Church ages then John's lifted up
[13:29] in the fourth chapter in the fifth
[13:31] chapter he's just setting a
[13:33] scene here for the opening of The Seven
[13:37] Seals now the word seen means a place
[13:42] where some action or event
[13:47] occurs all right an action or event or
[13:50] it's all right it means any view or like
[13:54] a picture right all right it's actually
[13:59] the
[14:04] um it's actually a a single
[14:08] episode yeah of a play right is what a
[14:11] scene is cuz you got many scenes put
[14:14] together that makes a movie right right
[14:16] you don't say the whole movie is a scene
[14:19] you have a scene and then it breaks and
[14:20] you have a scene especially where you're
[14:22] dealing with like I was bringing out
[14:24] Sunday where you're dealing with like a
[14:26] stage act you you open the St stage and
[14:29] there's the actors you know in
[14:31] place and that's a scene well then that
[14:34] you act that part out they close the
[14:36] curtains and you open up and then
[14:37] another scene comes into view but I like
[14:41] this one and you'll see when we get to
[14:43] it in a minute a scene is a incident or
[14:48] situation in real
[14:53] life so remember that it's an incident
[14:57] or a situation
[14:59] in real life okay so now we we'll hold
[15:03] to that point but look what he's saying
[15:04] see all
[15:06] right he's just setting a scene here for
[15:09] the opening of The Seven Seals just as
[15:11] he did in the first chapter of
[15:13] Revelations what opening the way for the
[15:16] church ages now what happened there
[15:19] there he stands in the seven golden
[15:20] candlesticks Revelations 13 he needs to
[15:23] look upon his Jasper and sard of stone
[15:26] and he's preparing for those that seven
[15:28] golden County looks Upon A J is
[15:30] preparing for the seven Church ages all
[15:34] right right now now he's preparing for
[15:37] the opening of those Seven Seals of
[15:40] redemption see that's what the fifth
[15:42] chapter is that's the reason I
[15:45] think that's the reason I kind of read
[15:47] it and just take it from there and talk
[15:49] on it and give the other parts of the
[15:51] scriptures is because it isn't verse by
[15:54] verse something that's
[15:57] happening
[15:59] it's preparing for something to happen
[16:03] now watch it and if you get the
[16:08] preparation then you just you're ready
[16:11] for it then and That's the Way It Is by
[16:15] faith or anything
[16:19] else so anything we get needs a
[16:22] preparation right right right a a a
[16:26] thing to to be able
[16:29] to help us to understand all right now
[16:33] and see then we gave you where you don't
[16:35] have to pull up the number two but we
[16:36] gave you where brother brand talks about
[16:38] in the seal book in the breach where he
[16:41] said this Revelation chap 5 is the most
[16:43] Sublime scripture in the Bible right all
[16:46] right because it's explaining something
[16:50] but watch
[16:53] now is preparing for the
[16:57] opening now what does that mean to
[17:00] you the prophet said it's preparing for
[17:03] the
[17:05] opening what would that
[17:09] mean
[17:11] right now he said as we read
[17:15] there that in chapter one Jesus standing
[17:18] in the midst of seven golden Candlestick
[17:20] and you're actually pulling that over in
[17:22] Revelations 4 uh to pick up the Sardis
[17:25] Stone and and all like that is high two
[17:28] scripture together but he's used in
[17:30] Revelations one where he standing in the
[17:32] midst of seven golden Candlestick like
[17:34] unto the son of man that's a foundation
[17:36] he said or a preparation to be able to
[17:40] understand the church AG all right now
[17:44] so then the fifth chapter is a
[17:47] preparation to understand the opening of
[17:50] the seals right and like we've talking
[17:52] about Sunday and you know you you're
[17:55] preparing an
[17:57] event you you're getting ready for some
[17:59] kind of event a wedding or or whatever
[18:02] or some kind of a a doing the shower or
[18:05] something that your sisters do it takes
[18:07] a lot of preparation sure I mean it's
[18:10] not just well we'll see you well when
[18:13] you going to see me well I don't know we
[18:15] we're going to have a wedding well when
[18:18] you going to have it don't
[18:20] know we'll call you when everybody's
[18:22] ready now what kind of an event would
[18:24] that be
[18:27] amen did that would be just a halfhazard
[18:30] thought and that's what we do in our
[18:33] minds of the Bible and the prophet's
[18:36] message is we just halfhazard think
[18:39] about something you know we say well why
[18:41] is it so important for us to understand
[18:44] Revelations 4 and 5 and all just get
[18:48] over into and we really don't even need
[18:50] them sealed we just we just believe the
[18:53] prophet's
[18:54] message well I thought the prophet's
[18:56] message beun the seal amen I thought
[18:59] that's what he said right amen but you
[19:01] see that's the way we do things we do it
[19:03] just you know nonchalant now you don't
[19:05] do a wedding that way do you right so
[19:08] you set a date you prepare everything
[19:12] you get everything ready and the closer
[19:14] you get more you just working like
[19:16] everything to get it to a place to where
[19:19] that you can have this wedding all right
[19:22] now all of that is the
[19:24] preparation that's not the wedding right
[19:27] so now understand what he's saying here
[19:30] Revelation 5 is a
[19:34] preparing now there is a quote in here
[19:36] who said this is actually opening the
[19:37] seals but I'm holding that for a long
[19:39] time AR another message or
[19:42] two but than about it what is the
[19:50] preparing
[19:52] now I took quite a
[19:56] while in dealing with the fourth
[19:59] chapter of the Book of
[20:02] Revelations and inside of that I kept
[20:04] giving you
[20:06] quotes and I'd say write this down
[20:09] because it will be needful later some of
[20:11] you did a lot of you probably didn't
[20:14] because you didn't consider it to be
[20:15] important enough but I was actually
[20:18] preaching the sermon there within those
[20:20] things and trying to Enlighten our eyes
[20:23] to where that we could look at it but a
[20:27] scene
[20:30] preparing for the opening
[20:33] right
[20:38] now we look in Revelations 51 as we
[20:42] read and we see one sitting on the
[20:46] throne all right we see a book in his
[20:50] hand as I said we won't be dealing with
[20:51] that but that's identically the same
[20:54] thing that you see over in chapter 4
[20:59] there right on verse two it says there a
[21:04] throne in heaven and one sitting on the
[21:07] throne all right now to me I don't
[21:11] believe you can understand chapter
[21:14] 5 until you fully understand chapter 4
[21:18] and that was the reason for preaching uh
[21:21] 13 or so many sermons 14 or something 15
[21:24] on the you know chapter 4
[21:29] because chapter 4 is a verse by verse
[21:35] description then when you get into
[21:37] chapter 5 it's a
[21:40] scene see chapter 4 describes what's
[21:44] taking place chapter 5 it just opens
[21:50] up and when it opens up there you
[21:53] are a
[21:55] throne right and one sitting on the
[21:57] throne wrong right all right
[22:02] now see by doing that as I said I spent
[22:05] much time trying to get us to
[22:11] understand and to see what that Throne
[22:14] was we said well I it's just a throne
[22:18] sitting up
[22:19] there well that's that's all right but
[22:23] that's up in
[22:24] heaven right yep we found out from
[22:27] chapter 4
[22:28] that this Throne was the father's
[22:31] Throne are the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:34] they come on the day of
[22:35] Pentecost in the new birth right right
[22:39] all right starting in the heart of man
[22:41] with the father's strong in our hearts
[22:44] and one day we will go to that throne
[22:47] and sit with him but if if we don't have
[22:49] it right here we're not going die that's
[22:53] right
[22:54] right if we don't match on Earth what is
[22:57] dark we're not going there that's right
[23:00] so where are we in we're in the
[23:06] preparation we're then the point of
[23:08] getting
[23:10] ready to be able to to see it all right
[23:15] now let me ask you a question a couple
[23:17] of messages down the road so I will jot
[23:19] this
[23:22] down will your
[23:25] Revelation produce a lamb for you right
[23:32] right simple
[23:35] question will your
[23:37] Revelation produce a lamb for
[23:40] you no I don't need to produce it
[23:43] brother they God produced
[23:45] it that's
[23:49] good but this is something personal
[23:52] that's
[23:53] right that's what I want you to see
[23:55] about the fifth chapter
[24:00] it is something personal that's taking
[24:03] place right
[24:05] now that's right that's
[24:07] right cuz if we're not in the
[24:10] preparation right then it'll never come
[24:13] forth in the right order
[24:16] right all
[24:17] right now you'll see why we've been
[24:20] around here 40
[24:23] years in the time of preparation yeah
[24:26] instead of just saying well boy bless
[24:28] God we got it the prophet said it that's
[24:30] the way people are
[24:32] right that Prophet themselves broke to
[24:35] the prophet amen we got it
[24:43] work right still worse than all than any
[24:46] organized religion group of
[24:49] people right
[24:52] y still messed up and the people W even
[24:54] talk to each other fellowship or
[24:56] anything that's right but now think
[24:59] about
[25:01] it in Revelations CH 4 we started off
[25:05] talking about a throne in heaven
[25:09] right but we said that Throne as I said
[25:12] a moment ago had to be in our hearts
[25:14] right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:16] that's right or there wouldn't be a
[25:18] throne in heaven for us to go
[25:21] to so do you realize what I'm
[25:25] saying the baptism in of the Holy Ghost
[25:28] in your heart is making way for that
[25:31] throne in heaven it's not that throne in
[25:34] heaven making a way for us on
[25:38] Earth we're making a way here on Earth
[25:42] to that to be
[25:43] prepared right if we can go
[25:47] there if we don't see it we can't
[25:50] understand it we if it's not prepared
[25:51] for us all right
[25:56] now see then we read first
[26:01] Peter and he's talking about at the
[26:03] revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:08] right now the Bible is the revelation of
[26:11] Jesus
[26:12] Christ right not just the Book of
[26:14] Revelation right right we'll read this
[26:17] in a second the entire Bible is a
[26:20] revelation of Jesus Christ right brother
[26:22] said if you read anywhere in the Bible
[26:25] and you don't see Christ he said go back
[26:28] and read it again because you missed it
[26:31] y
[26:33] right he said well there's a lot in the
[26:35] Bible about the things that happen this
[26:38] that and the other yeah and you see
[26:40] Christ in
[26:42] there we deal more Sunday about these
[26:45] things and try to get into a foundation
[26:49] right but if we don't understand chapter
[26:54] 4 and seeing the preparation
[26:58] and what has been taking place then
[27:01] chapter 5 means nothing to us it's just
[27:03] a double scene of what you saw in
[27:05] chapter
[27:08] 4 but now as I told you when I was doing
[27:10] that series then you'll see it it opens
[27:14] up all right you see a
[27:18] throne then you see one on the throne
[27:21] then you seen the 24
[27:23] Elders then you seen the rainbow you
[27:26] seen the different things all right now
[27:28] chapter 5 is not a verse by verse The
[27:31] Prophet's not going to take it verse by
[27:33] verse but he is taking it verse by verse
[27:36] he's explaining
[27:37] it but he's already explained it in
[27:40] chapter
[27:41] 4 that's the point I want you to see so
[27:45] then it comes forth as a
[27:48] scene something that's actually
[27:55] happening and it's a preparing yeah
[27:58] right for these things to happen all
[28:02] right now at the revelation of Jesus
[28:06] Christ so then the entire book is that
[28:11] Revelation and Revelations 5
[28:16] then is showing one
[28:19] picture a
[28:22] scene that covers all that took place in
[28:25] chapter
[28:26] 4
[28:30] do you understand what I'm saying so
[28:32] then I could have brought it out and
[28:34] said well here because remember it says
[28:35] a picture y the scene is like a picture
[28:39] but see you could have dra out the
[28:41] throne one sitting on the throne and a
[28:44] book in his hand and you just stuck it
[28:46] up here and said there's the
[28:51] scene but how did you know that took
[28:56] place
[28:59] everything you read is a foundation
[29:03] right sure everything you study is a
[29:06] foundation that's why it's so vital to
[29:10] study if we don't get a
[29:16] foundation what are we going to do
[29:18] somebody just come out and preach a
[29:19] message and just run across it oh you
[29:22] get up in the spirit and rejoice with
[29:24] them Etc but then when it's finished you
[29:26] say what say I don't know but it's good
[29:28] message
[29:31] yeah but if you've had a
[29:34] foundation
[29:36] right then the preacher is not going to
[29:38] lose you right
[29:40] right see we've had years to lay
[29:44] Foundation to get ready for the things
[29:47] that God wants to do all right
[29:52] now see then you can't
[29:55] see Revelations five unless you
[29:58] understand Revelations 4 as being an
[30:02] explanation of what has taken place upon
[30:05] this Earth where did 24 Elders come from
[30:09] right here upon the Earth where's the
[30:12] one on the throne he's on the throne of
[30:13] your heart now by the baptism of the
[30:16] Holy Ghost all right so then you see in
[30:19] chapter 5 a
[30:25] scene of a throne and one sitting on the
[30:28] throne and a book in his
[30:30] hand and there's no way to understand
[30:34] chapter 6 until we get chapter 5
[30:37] right are you following me yeah M all
[30:42] right in other
[30:44] words what was made known of the true
[30:48] revelation of Jesus
[30:50] Christ and the opening of the
[30:54] word was the preparing of the prophet
[30:58] to be able to speak right when it come
[31:02] to chapter six of the opening of the
[31:05] seals right see a lot of people say well
[31:07] brother Randon was wrong before the
[31:10] seals broke he was all messed up show it
[31:12] to me you have one thing that you can
[31:15] deal with and that's the white horse
[31:17] rider or you might make evidences of
[31:20] this and evidence but remember he's
[31:22] growing in Grace and knowledge too all
[31:25] right but you can deal with the or it's
[31:27] right but just remember no light had
[31:29] ever shined on that so it's not
[31:32] responsible even Jesus said if I hadn't
[31:36] come and spoke to
[31:38] you you would have had a covering for
[31:41] your sins right right but said I spoke
[31:44] to you now you have no covering
[31:46] Therefore your sins
[31:48] remain words he brought them out in the
[31:50] open he exposed him all
[31:54] right see then if the prophet wasn't
[31:57] right how could have God opened the word
[32:02] right how can a
[32:05] trinitarian
[32:07] concept understand any of the
[32:10] Bible
[32:14] right I mean any of it
[32:17] whatsoever how can you do it with a
[32:19] contrary with a concept of a
[32:21] trinitarianism because it's contrary to
[32:23] the
[32:25] Bible and the Antichrist Devil's
[32:28] teaching so are you saying that the
[32:30] devil has more understanding about God
[32:33] than God can
[32:36] bring not quite now
[32:39] folks see then a trinitarian
[32:42] concept can never see a true revelation
[32:46] of one God right it don't matter any
[32:49] Scripture talking about one
[32:52] Goden and truly when you come to the
[32:55] opening of the seals How would a
[32:57] trinitarian
[32:59] understand because the first seal said
[33:03] what the white horse rider rides
[33:06] out we see in the trinitarian concept
[33:09] you can just have one going this way and
[33:11] one going that way one going that way
[33:12] just all kind of things and you know
[33:15] that was the Holy Ghost with the little
[33:17] Aras of cupid shooting you know the
[33:19] hearts of the
[33:22] people and we think well now that's
[33:25] silly but you know that's what some
[33:26] people will believe her brother Randon
[33:28] wouldn't referred to
[33:30] it he had run into that
[33:34] Doctrine might have believed some of it
[33:36] himself when he first
[33:38] started you know we think he knowed
[33:40] everything but he said I used to think
[33:42] he in one of these quotes here that
[33:44] we'll get to in a second he said I used
[33:46] to think that that Jesus loved me and
[33:49] God hated me he said I found out it the
[33:52] same
[33:54] person then he begin to understand he
[33:56] couldn't be that
[33:58] way but now listen see I I just read
[34:01] through Sunday to get it laid down for a
[34:03] long you know good many
[34:08] messages but here's my
[34:12] point if brother randam was
[34:16] wrong you know before the seals broke
[34:20] when he come up to that place then
[34:22] there's no way that God could have come
[34:23] to him and that's right and give it to
[34:27] him
[34:30] amen he was standing there with the
[34:33] faith of the fathers reveal word of
[34:36] God and then God could open the word to
[34:39] him all right but now how can you and I
[34:43] do
[34:46] it you remember the word sing has to do
[34:49] with a personal
[34:54] experience that's where the trouble with
[34:56] people is
[34:59] see we take our own concept
[35:03] right and most of that is a hold over
[35:05] from the old religious
[35:09] ideas Y and then we try to understand
[35:12] God's
[35:14] word and how can that be
[35:19] done you see why that we need the
[35:21] background you see why we've needed 40
[35:23] something years since the prophets Left
[35:25] Right amen
[35:29] we've needed it to get a
[35:32] background of
[35:35] preparing y now what if you went
[35:38] somewhere now give an illustration P you
[35:40] know preparing backgrounds Etc here we
[35:43] go you go somewhere and and you you was
[35:47] a trinitarian you was you know the old
[35:49] days and and you walk into a church and
[35:52] somebody preaches one God and you say
[35:54] amen that's right
[35:57] that's what I
[35:59] believe believe one God especially if
[36:02] you badst cuz that's their Doctrine one
[36:06] God then you say well now how do you
[36:10] explain that to me well what it is now
[36:13] it's God in three
[36:17] persons Blessed
[36:20] Trinity
[36:22] right now your background has been what
[36:28] come on your background has been God in
[36:32] three
[36:34] persons it's not been a revelation of
[36:36] one God or you wouldn't have made that
[36:38] statement it's like I told you that's
[36:40] what I told Brother Mo when he asked me
[36:42] I said one true and living God he said
[36:44] explain it I said God and three
[36:47] person well see when he said you're as
[36:49] much trinitarian as anybody else
[36:51] person's a personality personality an
[36:53] individual individual is a person right
[36:55] well it didn't take me no six months to
[36:57] figure that out I looked at and said I
[36:59] don't believe that no
[37:01] more now if you ask me said what do you
[37:03] believe I said well I don't really know
[37:05] exactly yet but I know I don't believe
[37:07] that right because I believe in
[37:11] progressive
[37:13] revelation I believe every day we must
[37:15] get a background that's why it says in
[37:17] the Bible give me this day my daily
[37:21] bread now you don't take a baby uh join
[37:25] Rachel he call said it'd be viewing in
[37:27] tonight and know because the little baby
[37:29] you know taking care of it and know but
[37:32] you know you don't take that
[37:35] baby and it's laying there you know just
[37:38] born and you handed a piece of
[37:41] chicken boy we're feeding that baby we
[37:44] want him to grow up
[37:46] right you know what I said the other day
[37:48] you got all these people that write
[37:49] books about raising kids and all
[37:51] Bachelors are old
[37:53] maids you ain't somebody that that's
[37:55] raised kids that writes a
[37:58] book but see they pervert people's Mind
[38:01] by telling you you not do this or not do
[38:03] that
[38:05] why we got
[38:09] raised and when they raised us by
[38:12] sticking the finger in the gravy and
[38:13] putting it in your
[38:14] mouth not too long after we were
[38:17] born and we
[38:19] lived you
[38:22] know but you see all of it now is is on
[38:25] you know don't do this don't do that
[38:27] trying to tell you how to do things well
[38:30] now about 6 months from now a year from
[38:32] later they'll rewrite the book right
[38:34] amen and then they'll tell you not to
[38:36] give them what you give them
[38:38] here well they might as well forget it
[38:41] but you understand what I'm trying to
[38:42] say that
[38:44] church if we don't have a background an
[38:47] understanding of
[38:49] preparation then somebody preaches one
[38:51] God to us we don't know whether it's
[38:53] right or not right
[38:55] amen
[38:57] right
[39:00] right I've heard preachers preach a
[39:02] sermon you know people would come out
[39:04] wouldn't that the greatest sermon you
[39:06] ever
[39:09] heard and you just got to bite your
[39:11] tongue and walk
[39:15] away because it was all
[39:19] false but to them it was the greatest
[39:22] thing that ever been heard well they
[39:24] preached one he said three times he
[39:25] believed in one God
[39:27] so does the
[39:29] Baptist you want to go right over
[39:33] there so was a Baptist they believe in
[39:36] one
[39:38] God but you see your background is where
[39:41] the thing is
[39:43] at if you and I don't have a background
[39:45] by now
[39:48] yeah we're in bad shape
[39:51] right right see because we're subject to
[39:54] all kind of errors and doctrines without
[39:58] your
[40:00] background first off you got to have a
[40:02] new birth
[40:04] right right that's what it's talking
[40:06] about in Revelations 4 it comes up to
[40:09] show in Revelations 5 that new birth in
[40:11] your heart's got to be
[40:14] there but then a background an
[40:19] understanding and God speaking
[40:22] personally to you because no matter how
[40:24] much background you got if God don't
[40:26] speak to you we're still messed
[40:30] up it don't matter how much we can say
[40:33] that was true and it could be
[40:35] true but what do we get out of
[40:38] it that's
[40:43] right you know what do we get out of the
[40:50] message do you get what I'm trying to
[40:52] say or are you getting the words I'm
[40:55] saying
[40:58] cuz I'm trying my best to explain one
[41:00] true and living
[41:03] God you'll see what I'm talking about
[41:05] because that's been the whole basis of
[41:06] chapter
[41:08] 4 was to preach about one God and where
[41:10] he was at and the 24 Elders the rainbow
[41:13] and the The Jasper and the sarden stone
[41:15] and all I'm preaching about
[41:18] Goden now we
[41:21] come to see all of that as a background
[41:24] and God's going to show us something
[41:28] am but he's not going to show us what we
[41:33] think see why didn't God go from
[41:36] Revelation 4 in verse one right on over
[41:40] to Revelation 6 in verse one and start
[41:44] with the
[41:48] seals now why didn't he do
[41:52] that because he knew he wouldn't
[41:54] understand right
[41:57] he knew we couldn't
[41:59] comprehend he knew the prophet couldn't
[42:02] even
[42:02] comprehend yeah so we had to give him
[42:05] the
[42:07] background of all of the years that he
[42:11] preached was a
[42:15] background to me that was what the Lord
[42:17] showed me see when when that white horse
[42:19] rider went riding
[42:20] out all the Holy Ghost had to say to the
[42:23] prophet was said what have you taught
[42:24] all your life he said one one person one
[42:26] true and living God and it correct one
[42:29] person he said well then here you stand
[42:31] with the Holy Ghost and our goost the
[42:33] white horse
[42:34] rider that's leaving
[42:36] you so what do you
[42:40] got see if that have been a holy ghost
[42:42] you better go ride with it
[42:45] right but see he could tie back into his
[42:48] message and get him to
[42:51] see the revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:54] that's right cuz that's the entire
[42:57] Bible pull those up brothers let's just
[42:59] get those and we got little number three
[43:03] number
[43:05] four let's just bring these up this is
[43:08] in the first seal 19 uh
[43:11] 63
[43:12] 3:18 as we study this chapter we are
[43:16] referring different places even to Old
[43:18] and New Testament life because the
[43:20] entire book is the revelation of Jesus
[43:25] Christ
[43:27] the entire
[43:29] book that's all
[43:31] together the revelation of of the Lord
[43:34] Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[43:38] God revealing
[43:40] himself in the book revealing himself
[43:44] through Christ in the
[43:46] book and Christ is the revelation of God
[43:50] he come to reveal God because he and God
[43:52] was the
[43:53] same God was in Christ reconciling the
[43:56] world to
[43:58] himself now so what did it turn out to
[44:00] be in other words you'd never know just
[44:04] what God was until he revealed himself
[44:07] through
[44:08] Christ then you can see I used to think
[44:12] years ago that maybe God was angry with
[44:14] me but Christ loved me now this is a
[44:17] prophet
[44:18] talking come to find out it's the same
[44:20] person see and Christ is the very Heart
[44:23] Of God right look at the next one just
[44:26] getting the point where you're at this
[44:28] is Jesus Christ same yesterday today in
[44:30] Forever 1963
[44:33] 606 that's kind of been a theme with me
[44:36] in the campaigns that I would use that
[44:39] because I believe the entire book is a
[44:41] revelation of Jesus Christ and he is the
[44:44] same yesterday today and
[44:48] forever now he's the same yesterday
[44:50] today and forever then the entire book
[44:54] that we'll get to Sunday the book that
[44:56] is in the hand of the one sitting on the
[45:00] throne do we want to just read it and
[45:02] just jump out this the book in his hand
[45:05] one on thr one come tou the book out his
[45:06] hand well where did all that come
[45:12] from where did the glamb come
[45:20] from and will your
[45:24] revelation
[45:27] put you in a position to understand the
[45:30] opening of the
[45:36] word I know I'm slow I want to be
[45:42] slow what about
[45:44] it what if the world was dependent upon
[45:52] you you getting scripture okay they
[45:55] without us can can notot be made perfect
[45:57] that Sol it Hebrews 11:40 I guess it
[46:01] is so the world's waiting on
[46:06] you well I don't know where well then
[46:08] you're not part of
[46:10] it is that sensible if the world's not
[46:13] waiting on you you're not part of it but
[46:15] if you're part of it then it's waiting
[46:17] on
[46:19] you the bride is part of the
[46:23] mystery Christ The Mystery of God
[46:25] revealed
[46:28] right and she must be revealed
[46:33] am
[46:35] right now I've told you though this is a
[46:38] ever service I make this statement then
[46:41] in the Book of Revelations you don't
[46:43] find Jesus Christ by
[46:48] himself you find him in the people or
[46:51] revealing himself in the
[46:54] people right chapter one one standing in
[46:57] the midst of seven golden Candlestick
[46:58] like the son of man G about the POU with
[47:00] the golden girdle then we go to the
[47:01] church ages and he would revealing
[47:03] himself in the church
[47:06] ages then we went to chapter 4 of a
[47:09] Rapture and and showed how that that if
[47:11] it hadn't been the revelation of Jesus
[47:13] Christ we wouldn't have been going in a
[47:14] Rapture there would't be a Rapture
[47:16] without a revelation of Jesus
[47:19] Christ but with your Revelation what is
[47:22] your
[47:24] Revelation why do you believe what you
[47:27] believe you know that most people would
[47:29] say I don't really know
[47:31] right that's
[47:35] right but what if you was
[47:39] asked what if there was a large group of
[47:42] people
[47:43] dependent upon your
[47:50] Revelation you'd be more serious
[47:52] wouldn't you
[47:54] that's
[47:58] what if it is that the bride of Christ
[47:59] down through all the ages is now 2,000
[48:02] years have died and went into the ground
[48:04] and waiting on
[48:09] you well I don't have to understand I
[48:11] just believe
[48:14] it brother around said a true Eagle will
[48:17] understand if he's a true
[48:24] eagle see what if the world's waiting on
[48:27] you and I right amen according to the
[48:30] prophet and according to the Bible
[48:31] that's what it did that's
[48:38] right what is it
[48:43] Church
[48:47] preparing the years of
[48:49] preparation that that Prophet went
[48:51] through he preached 30 something years
[48:54] before he could preach this is his words
[48:56] before he could preach the statue of
[48:57] perfect man
[49:00] y get the book read it it's in the
[49:03] message 30 something years before he
[49:05] could preach yet I can show you back in
[49:08] the 50s that was 62 I think it's right
[49:11] somewhere right there and I I show you
[49:13] in the 50s where he was preaching on
[49:16] those
[49:18] things but he didn't see it tied
[49:20] together see cuz he said I didn't see
[49:23] this tied together to the other day I
[49:25] didn't good that
[49:31] honey you see we thank brother around
[49:34] come here with everything now he says he
[49:35] didn't he said I don't know what that
[49:38] that first seal is then when he open the
[49:41] first sheld over he said I don't know
[49:42] what the second one is third one that's
[49:44] his words what are you doing with his
[49:47] words because of our thoughts and our
[49:49] ideas of our mind what are we
[49:51] doing but what if it is that's the
[49:54] that's the only thing that's on my mind
[49:55] tonight is one thing you don't get
[49:58] nothing out of the message tonight get
[49:59] one
[50:02] thing will your
[50:05] Revelation bring God on the
[50:11] scene I don't have to do that he just
[50:13] come because he said he's coming well
[50:17] that's the good bad dist thought and
[50:20] that's what they
[50:24] say but what about it
[50:30] right but do you read and do you study
[50:32] the prophet's
[50:35] message do you listen to the tapes and
[50:38] you
[50:42] preparing
[50:47] right or have you got some concept of
[50:50] something that you've done or didn't do
[50:52] has made you to world that you're in the
[50:54] message
[50:55] right I said did or didn't do either
[51:03] way see what about your Revelation
[51:06] brother
[51:07] collie what if this whole church is
[51:09] dependent upon what you
[51:17] believe are you willing to take that
[51:19] responsibility that's
[51:23] right do when I get up here preaching
[51:25] that's what I have to do right amen amen
[51:28] you can sit there and do all you want to
[51:29] but I can't right see cuz I realize that
[51:32] if I don't preach it correctly we won't
[51:34] make it amen now you you say well what
[51:37] do you mean I won't make it I'll go
[51:39] somewhere else well go on then right
[51:41] amen that's the best way to say
[51:43] it that way it don't keep no bone
[51:46] picking with nobody don't stay here
[51:48] because of
[51:51] me because your soul is involved that's
[51:55] right
[51:57] right now if you want your soul lost and
[51:59] you think I'm lost then you're going to
[52:00] be lost yeah right that's just plain
[52:03] language I don't mind
[52:06] talking but what if everybody's waiting
[52:08] on
[52:11] you amen now you know the world was
[52:16] waiting on brother ROM to come that's
[52:19] what it means Malachi 4 you know all
[52:21] those
[52:23] scriptures now had he not come where
[52:25] would we
[52:29] be and you and I are totally
[52:32] dependent
[52:34] upon whether or not he was the prophet
[52:37] of
[52:41] God now the way it's going now and the
[52:44] people of the message you know for
[52:45] certainty it's not that way because
[52:48] they're just some going back to
[52:49] organized religion and some going back
[52:52] to all these other things right some
[52:54] just leaving to church and just going
[52:56] home
[53:06] and but what if it's dependent upon you
[53:08] and
[53:10] I do we have enough
[53:13] preparation
[53:16] right if you was taken in court today to
[53:20] be tried about this
[53:24] message
[53:26] now they don't care about you saying
[53:27] that brother around as a prophet you
[53:30] know then they ask you was what he
[53:37] teach see whether you like it or not
[53:40] we're dependent upon this
[53:42] message and whether you like it or not
[53:44] you're dependent upon the five-fold
[53:46] ministry to break it down to you
[53:48] amen and if you don't like that then I'd
[53:51] suggest you go home and listen to
[53:53] T because because there's no need of you
[53:56] wearing yourself out in cars too coming
[53:57] to church if you're not dependent upon
[53:59] what's being brought that's that's right
[54:02] right you shouldn't talk that way why
[54:08] not why
[54:13] not do you know that I believe and I've
[54:16] always talked to you
[54:18] this that no man is to have brother
[54:21] Ram's Ministry by himself anymore
[54:23] brother Ram had the ministry of the Lord
[54:25] Jesus Christ right right Amen to the
[54:29] resurrection to All Things No one person
[54:32] is to have that
[54:36] again but the prophet said the
[54:39] bride would have the ministry of Jesus
[54:42] Christ that's right yep all right so
[54:45] around the
[54:51] world is the brde of Jesus
[54:54] Christ
[54:55] ain't just Lula
[54:57] Georgia right no bride of Christ around
[55:00] the world then you know what that that
[55:03] means that you and I are going to have a
[55:05] portion of the
[55:07] word
[55:11] sure right and they're going to have a
[55:14] portion here and a portion there and a
[55:16] portion here and overseas has got a
[55:17] portion these places got a portion when
[55:20] it's all put
[55:21] together it'll be the word of
[55:24] God
[55:26] right amen but what if we don't have our
[55:29] portion right right
[55:39] amen very serious amen you so I'm just a
[55:43] housewife what have I got to do with it
[55:45] well even the garden you know I believe
[55:50] that this she could have spoke the
[55:54] word no it's only
[55:56] Adam
[55:58] well all
[56:00] right she had God living in her too
[56:04] right see you sisters got your part
[56:09] amen we just know it's not in the pull
[56:11] pit
[56:13] right but you got your part raising a
[56:18] family and helping one
[56:21] another
[56:23] right that's your part
[56:25] well you know if you don't Supply your
[56:27] part then you know that we're missing
[56:28] that
[56:29] part
[56:33] right who was listening to a tape the
[56:36] other day and brother Ram they asked him
[56:37] a question said should women brother
[56:39] brandham have a Ministry like you know
[56:41] not a Ministry like preaching should
[56:43] women have a uh uh you know an outside
[56:46] work to where that they could work and
[56:47] do things he said yes sir
[56:53] right
[56:55] I remember an old Baptist lady in our
[56:57] church she said if I could talk to
[56:59] somebody about the Lord I'd never make
[57:00] my bed of a
[57:03] morning you know she meant
[57:07] it she meant it you serious what about
[57:11] you and
[57:15] me you said what are you talking I'm
[57:17] talking about that without the opening
[57:21] of the word of Revelations
[57:23] 1
[57:26] I went through that and over and over
[57:27] and over you'd never be able to
[57:30] understand what happened in the church
[57:31] ages and
[57:33] theight and you'd never understand the
[57:35] Rapture and why it took
[57:38] place but then we went into chapter 4
[57:41] and we've spent 15 or something
[57:43] sermons talking about the
[57:47] requirements the thing God was expecting
[57:50] of you and
[57:51] I I wasn't preaching about what was in
[57:54] heaven I kept telling you
[57:59] that everybody wants to go to heaven
[58:01] with their their mind so fast what you
[58:05] know you can become so Heavenly minded
[58:07] to you're no earthly
[58:09] good and I mean that in the true real of
[58:12] this way you can become so Heavenly
[58:14] minded until you can't even get a
[58:16] revelation yet you're so revelated you
[58:18] think you got all of it
[58:22] yeah but what about it
[58:28] you remember a little boy that one day
[58:31] asked his mother he said mother can you
[58:33] see
[58:35] God
[58:38] yeah she
[58:41] said you'll have to ask your Sunday
[58:44] school
[58:46] teacher the little boy asked a Sunday
[58:48] school teacher can you see
[58:50] God well you better go to the
[58:53] pastor when I got to the pastor and he
[58:56] said can you see God and the Pastor said
[58:58] no you can't see
[59:02] God well you remember what happened he
[59:05] went fishing with the old gentleman you
[59:07] know the old gentleman was crying so cuz
[59:10] he saw the rainbow and all like that in
[59:11] the clouds and
[59:14] he he realized that there was something
[59:16] about the man he said can you see God he
[59:19] said all that I've ever seen in my life
[59:21] is God
[59:23] Amen
[59:26] now listen
[59:29] folks what if your kids comes and asks
[59:32] you can you see God
[59:43] right I like
[59:45] what
[59:47] uh I won't call the name but certain
[59:50] person one time claimed to be highly
[59:52] religious and his wife told
[59:55] said if that's what you call religion I
[59:57] don't want it
[1:00:04] yeah where is our lives LED people to
[1:00:07] Christ
[1:00:13] right and we got this great Revelation
[1:00:15] but where's our lives LED people to
[1:00:19] Christ can they say about you that
[1:00:21] that's a good
[1:00:23] Christian
[1:00:29] they might say oh we don't agree with
[1:00:30] them in Doctrine but they're good people
[1:00:33] at least that's the way it should
[1:00:36] be you
[1:00:40] know what about
[1:00:43] it what would be ha what would be
[1:00:48] coming this is whole what I'm trying to
[1:00:50] bring out
[1:00:52] tonight what would be the next next step
[1:00:54] of what you're thinking whatever you're
[1:00:56] thinking you know what what's going to
[1:00:58] be the thing to bring the Rapture the
[1:01:00] change you know the the won't twinkle
[1:01:01] and eye what do you
[1:01:05] think what do you think's going to
[1:01:09] bring see in the message day every time
[1:01:12] a young man comes along with a pretty
[1:01:14] good delivery and this that and the
[1:01:15] other the people just flock to it right
[1:01:17] even in the message people they just
[1:01:20] flock to that cuz they think that's a
[1:01:23] deliverer
[1:01:36] what if this whole thing is dependent
[1:01:37] upon
[1:01:40] you in your part that's
[1:01:45] right what do you think is going to
[1:01:48] bring you don't ever think like this you
[1:01:52] don't ever ask God God what's wrong
[1:01:57] right you know why are we around here
[1:02:01] why we're here 40 something years after
[1:02:03] the prophet's
[1:02:11] come you don't ever ask him about that
[1:02:15] you're not concerned about
[1:02:21] it what if it's because of you
[1:02:31] remember your Prophet said one
[1:02:32] unconfessed sin in any member in the
[1:02:35] church would cause the church to
[1:02:36] bitterly fail said you'd answer it
[1:02:40] judgment is that right do we believe
[1:02:48] that but what if the world's waiting on
[1:02:51] you now brother Dale we we know so much
[1:02:54] word at Lula till everybody
[1:02:56] else's they need to get where we're
[1:02:59] at you ain't never heard me say that
[1:03:02] that's
[1:03:06] right I believe God has been abundance
[1:03:09] to us in Revelation I do I
[1:03:14] agree but I've never said that the
[1:03:16] world's totally waiting on
[1:03:21] Lula but I say it's waiting on the bride
[1:03:23] of Christ around the world to realize
[1:03:25] who she
[1:03:26] is and only when she realizes who she is
[1:03:31] will she be
[1:03:36] gone now we're going to get into
[1:03:38] something on the
[1:03:40] steals one of these
[1:03:42] days that I tried to
[1:03:46] preach 30 years
[1:03:49] ago couldn't get people to see
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:57] how many of you rem me making this
[1:03:59] statement on the seal that some of you
[1:04:00] have heard of I said when that seventh
[1:04:03] seal is open to an individual they're
[1:04:05] sealed in that's
[1:04:09] right Satan sealed out right
[1:04:14] right I was talking about something
[1:04:19] then see I never preached nothing in no
[1:04:22] sealed in 82 there 83 but Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ and where he was
[1:04:35] at because chapter
[1:04:39] 5 if we can't see ourselves in chapter 5
[1:04:42] verse
[1:04:45] one the first part of verse one the
[1:04:48] throne one sitting on the
[1:04:53] throne if we can't see ourselves
[1:04:57] there then there's no need of going to
[1:04:59] chapter six and the seals and the
[1:05:01] breaking and
[1:05:07] thing cuz you
[1:05:09] see write this one
[1:05:11] down this bride has got to give birth to
[1:05:14] the lamb
[1:05:16] right I tried to say that in ' 82 and '
[1:05:19] 83 and it didn't go
[1:05:23] across
[1:05:25] she's got to give birth to the
[1:05:29] lamb now folks it ain't what brother so
[1:05:33] and so preached and his people said that
[1:05:36] he was standing between them them and
[1:05:40] God you know and it was his
[1:05:43] Revelation now I didn't believe it then
[1:05:46] I don't believe it now it's not totally
[1:05:50] dependent upon
[1:05:51] me it's totally dependent upon on the
[1:05:54] Bride of Jesus Christ around the world
[1:05:56] that's right I just want to be my
[1:06:04] part but the world's waiting on you and
[1:06:07] I
[1:06:11] right what kind of book is
[1:06:17] that oh we can describe it's a scroll
[1:06:20] brother Dale it's and I've been through
[1:06:22] that and explained it cuz was
[1:06:26] necessary but what kind of a book is
[1:06:37] it I wondered how many of you notice
[1:06:40] what I've done in chapter
[1:06:45] 4 I talked about the throne and the
[1:06:47] things and your
[1:06:50] experience I didn't deal very much with
[1:06:52] us sitting in that throne with him I
[1:06:53] didn't deal with it just a
[1:06:57] little cuz that was
[1:07:00] preparation now as we enter the fifth
[1:07:03] chapter if we don't see ourselves on the
[1:07:10] throne sitting on that throne with
[1:07:15] him then you're still a
[1:07:22] trinitarian and you totally Miss what I
[1:07:25] was just saying about when the Eagles
[1:07:28] come are the appearing of the Eagles
[1:07:33] plural they were the little eaglets
[1:07:38] right you know that brother around said
[1:07:40] God is not complete without
[1:07:44] you it's letay on my desk we'll get down
[1:07:46] to that he's not complete without
[1:07:52] you
[1:07:56] remember a scene is
[1:07:58] what what did we cover a scene
[1:08:05] was an incident or
[1:08:10] situation in real
[1:08:16] life but R said he will become so
[1:08:19] visible Among
[1:08:22] Us
[1:08:24] that he'll raise the dead we'll go in
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:36] Rapture where does he come from to
[1:08:38] become visible to
[1:08:45] us I've told you what I say about the
[1:08:48] tent and return Ministries and things
[1:08:50] like that it's not because of anybody
[1:08:51] believing it the only thing is I ask the
[1:08:54] same question I asked at the
[1:08:59] beginning I told the people in the
[1:09:01] beginning I said if brother Brown come
[1:09:02] back and put up a tent right here in
[1:09:03] front of this church you wouldn't know
[1:09:05] what he's talking about cuz you don't
[1:09:08] know what he's talking
[1:09:11] about I would say you know said so and
[1:09:14] so they say where's that
[1:09:17] at I got to where I was carrying books
[1:09:19] with
[1:09:22] me why because they didn't know that's
[1:09:24] what he' said
[1:09:33] right the first message I preached in
[1:09:37] 1969 was that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:40] must be the son of man the word made
[1:09:42] flesh
[1:09:44] amen you think I don't believe that
[1:09:46] still
[1:09:51] today but what about it
[1:09:57] all the years of
[1:09:58] preparation brother
[1:10:01] brandom to where that God could speak to
[1:10:04] him right and tell him about that white
[1:10:07] horse rider
[1:10:10] yep if it took him 30 something years to
[1:10:12] preach a statue of perfect man it took
[1:10:14] him 30 something years to come to the
[1:10:16] place he could preach the seals right
[1:10:18] right well he tried to preach him right
[1:10:21] come on he did he tried to preach the
[1:10:23] seal back there in his early
[1:10:25] Ministry and he had those notes off of
[1:10:27] it and that's what he was going to
[1:10:28] preach that opening of the seals you
[1:10:30] know when they come to jerus De that's
[1:10:32] what he's going to preach that's what he
[1:10:33] said he's going back to his old
[1:10:37] notes why because he didn't know
[1:10:39] anything different but then God made
[1:10:47] him but this is what I wrote down do you
[1:10:49] see my
[1:10:52] point
[1:10:54] will your
[1:11:00] Revelation prepare him a
[1:11:02] throne for him to sit
[1:11:08] on will your Revelation prepare a
[1:11:15] throne wait a
[1:11:22] minute
[1:11:25] you say I'm not
[1:11:32] responsible where'd you get that
[1:11:35] idea right oh Lord you never got it from
[1:11:38] here and you never got it from Brother
[1:11:39] random and you never got it out of the
[1:11:40] Bible where'd you get that
[1:11:44] idea I'm just as blun as I can be you
[1:11:47] had to get it from the devil because you
[1:11:49] certainly didn't get it from
[1:11:51] God because it Ain God's word God's
[1:11:55] words tells us we're all
[1:11:57] responsible the prophet said we're all
[1:11:59] responsible and we give an account of
[1:12:07] responsibility
[1:12:12] right what if the world's waiting on you
[1:12:14] and
[1:12:15] I
[1:12:18] right we think they we think that we're
[1:12:22] waiting on them to get to a
[1:12:25] place no that ain't what I think
[1:12:33] right all I want to be is my part of
[1:12:36] what God has revealed to me to what I'm
[1:12:38] supposed to
[1:12:41] be what about
[1:12:52] you what that's your part you know we do
[1:12:55] have an old saying that's called clean
[1:12:57] around your own house door you know
[1:13:00] maybe those on internet some of them
[1:13:02] might hear that and wonder what's going
[1:13:03] on it simply means that unless our life
[1:13:07] is straight and right we ain't got no
[1:13:09] right to be running around judging
[1:13:11] nothing
[1:13:15] else what if the world is waiting on
[1:13:21] you you know we're all getting being
[1:13:23] fast old you
[1:13:27] know and that don't mean anything
[1:13:29] because time don't have anything to do
[1:13:31] with it we can leave you
[1:13:33] tonight right no matter how young we
[1:13:37] are but don't you realize what I'm
[1:13:40] trying to
[1:13:41] say Revelation CH 4 was a foundation a
[1:13:46] preparation to be able just understand
[1:13:49] the first verse of chapter 5
[1:13:52] right because because it's a total
[1:13:54] repeat of verse four of verse two of
[1:13:58] chapter
[1:13:58] 4 you saw a throne in one city on the
[1:14:03] throne but then you see the book in his
[1:14:12] hand now what kind of a book is
[1:14:18] that
[1:14:21] well I've heard preachers preach and I
[1:14:23] agree with you to agree say it's the
[1:14:27] Bible I agreed to that
[1:14:30] part I've heard it preached that it was
[1:14:32] a list of
[1:14:33] names and all our names was there I'll
[1:14:37] agree with that to a part
[1:14:42] see but I thought it was a revelation of
[1:14:45] Jesus
[1:14:47] Christ and where he was
[1:14:51] at and what he was doing
[1:14:53] you remember that qu that quotation the
[1:14:55] other
[1:14:57] night and it's not brother R said it's
[1:15:00] not just the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:02] he said this where he's at and what he's
[1:15:06] doing cuz he's not here
[1:15:09] physically but you're in the bride of
[1:15:11] Christ
[1:15:16] right now you remember the last
[1:15:18] statements we were making on chapter 4
[1:15:21] and then we started in on Sunday
[1:15:24] afternoon and gave those
[1:15:27] quotes where the prophet of God said
[1:15:29] that
[1:15:30] he'll take the
[1:15:32] book climb up on the
[1:15:35] throne and sit
[1:15:40] down have we provided him a throne to be
[1:15:44] able to S
[1:15:49] him have we provided a book that can be
[1:15:52] in his hand
[1:15:59] what
[1:16:01] about simple
[1:16:07] question if this book is the revelation
[1:16:10] of Jesus
[1:16:13] Christ that's what your Prophet said it
[1:16:16] was then what is your
[1:16:22] revelation
[1:16:24] you know somebody might ask you one of
[1:16:26] these days what's your Revelation
[1:16:28] right I remember right here years ago
[1:16:31] somebody brother asked brother Dixon he
[1:16:33] said you believe that he said explain it
[1:16:35] to
[1:16:36] me he put him on the spot that's right
[1:16:39] and he said you don't have to give me
[1:16:40] quotes to explain he said just put it in
[1:16:43] your own
[1:16:45] language
[1:16:47] right what about it it's all we got is
[1:16:52] quotes brother R said this brother R
[1:16:54] said
[1:16:58] that or is it a
[1:17:02] revelation so if it's a revelation we
[1:17:04] can depend upon God providing or
[1:17:08] preparing a
[1:17:10] place so that's what the Bible says
[1:17:12] right I go to prepare a place for you if
[1:17:14] I go to prepare a place for you I'll
[1:17:16] come again and receive you under myself
[1:17:19] right it's in our hearts and lives right
[1:17:22] here on Earth
[1:17:24] right you said well you you're preaching
[1:17:27] it's that it's up in
[1:17:28] heaven no I don't know where you got
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:34] idea cuz we ain't went to the Rapture
[1:17:36] yet I kept emphasizing
[1:17:39] that we ain't left the world
[1:17:43] yet so evidently it must not be matching
[1:17:46] what's here of what's that right right
[1:17:51] when it matches we'll go
[1:17:54] or we'll go by the grave before
[1:18:00] then come on
[1:18:02] Brothers what if the world is waiting on
[1:18:06] you would your
[1:18:08] Revelation produce a throne for him to
[1:18:11] sit on
[1:18:15] y your Revelation bring into
[1:18:18] manifestation the throne that God could
[1:18:20] set
[1:18:21] on
[1:18:24] would he be pleased to
[1:18:33] dwell what
[1:18:37] about of
[1:18:39] preparing for the opening of The Seven
[1:18:44] Seals so then if we don't get to
[1:18:46] preparation remember when we had the
[1:18:48] first quote brother re said we got to
[1:18:50] get the preparation right we don't get
[1:18:52] to preparation
[1:18:55] right if I was you I would go read the
[1:19:02] breach and I would read
[1:19:05] it and just see what the breach says
[1:19:08] about what being
[1:19:16] prepared cuz you might find out as
[1:19:18] something personal to
[1:19:21] you
[1:19:24] we want to blame everybody else
[1:19:29] right no can't be done what we
[1:19:32] got 136 in the spiral book Old Time
[1:19:37] power
[1:19:40] amen they were in the upper chamber they
[1:19:45] were all wonderful when the Holy Ghost
