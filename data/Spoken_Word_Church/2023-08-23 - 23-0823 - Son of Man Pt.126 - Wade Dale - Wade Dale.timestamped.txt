[15:35] God bless you good to be in the
[15:37] household Lord thank goodness we made it
[15:39] to a half of a week
[15:42] and we've come assembled together
[15:45] I hope we come to hear from the Lord not
[15:46] from each other
[15:48] and while you're getting uh
[15:51] getting all situated brother Louise has
[15:53] a announcement to make
[15:55] and let him come on up and do it now
[15:58] and then we'll continue
[16:00] with the service yeah
[16:03] everybody
[16:06] just be in prayer
[16:08] we have a brother coming this weekend
[16:09] from Peru he's going to be speaking for
[16:12] us and so will brother Louise
[16:21] of your time here over by the way it's
[16:23] time
[16:26] um
[16:27] uh you can be seated for just a moment
[16:29] um
[16:30] some of you all know that that this come
[16:33] in December we're going to be at a
[16:36] uh we're holding a youth camp in in
[16:39] Honduras
[16:41] um it's a youth camp that we've held
[16:43] before brother Eric
[16:45] who we support here he's he's going to
[16:48] be hosting it so this is going to be his
[16:49] second year doing it
[16:52] um so
[16:54] um brother Eric they're they're they're
[16:56] got everything going right now they're
[16:59] preparing
[17:00] and so he was telling me about that I
[17:04] asked him where they mostly need the
[17:05] help in and so they're expecting about
[17:09] 250 to 300
[17:11] campers coming in kids not just from
[17:15] Honduras but also from Nicaragua
[17:17] so um they need uh he said that that
[17:21] they they could they could use you know
[17:23] probably around
[17:24] up to about three thousand dollars to
[17:27] just help with the food
[17:29] and um and if you if you do the math on
[17:32] that for about 250 to 300 kids that's
[17:35] about that's about 12 a kid and that'll
[17:38] feed them for three days three days yeah
[17:39] so if you can if there's anything that
[17:42] anybody would like to do brother Aaron
[17:44] is going to be there with me and so uh
[17:47] it's going to be one of the speakers
[17:48] there and uh so we're going to be going
[17:51] there and also brother Christian from
[17:52] from Ohio he's going as well
[17:55] we've already collected we're already
[17:57] secured about 350 dollars if I'm not
[18:00] mistaken so if you feel in your heart
[18:03] and if you got money laying around that
[18:05] you could put some kids to hear the
[18:08] gospel for three days
[18:11] then do so that the Lord will bless you
[18:13] greatly
[18:14] um
[18:15] and because brother brother Eric he's
[18:17] not trying to uh you know if he can't
[18:20] he's not trying to raise all of it up he
[18:22] just he told me he said if you can't if
[18:23] whatever you can brother Louise if you
[18:25] if you can collect that'd be fine if not
[18:27] we'll do what we can here so technically
[18:30] all the kids you know they they pay a
[18:33] little fee to to to go in but if they
[18:36] can't
[18:37] they just can't they just let them they
[18:39] let they let them camp for free because
[18:42] the main thing is to hear the gospel and
[18:44] probably the majority of them probably
[18:46] will not pay
[18:47] so so and that's what happened last year
[18:50] so where we helped last year when we
[18:52] were there it was in this area it was
[18:54] with the food and that was with some of
[18:56] the funds that you all had given us when
[18:58] we were previously there for like you
[19:01] know a couple of weeks that's when they
[19:03] last had that camp
[19:04] so um but I just want to put that in
[19:07] your on your laps and on your hearts so
[19:10] whatever you want to help me just I
[19:11] guess come to me or to my wife and uh
[19:14] we'll be more than glad to uh assist you
[19:16] there so God bless you all thank you
[19:19] hey you got between now and Christmas
[19:23] if you don't know what to give somebody
[19:24] for Christmas

[23:07] be your brother
[23:09] um uh human this weekend as we have a
[23:12] regular service
[23:14] um let's turn to
[23:16] is that on
[23:18] I think we're having internet issues too
[23:20] so just bear with us this would be part
[23:22] 106 son of man we're going to talk a
[23:25] little bit today and try to get to
[23:28] where we talk about the anointing and
[23:31] keep on going a little bit further
[23:33] something that the Lord was dealing with
[23:35] me the other night and um and kept going
[23:38] back to so we'll just keep going back to
[23:40] it so let's bow our heads just for a
[23:42] minute Lord thank you for this day thank
[23:44] you for everything you give us thank you
[23:45] for this building Lord it will have to
[23:47] come to Lord that we have that we can
[23:49] come to lord it's it's warm in the
[23:52] winter and it's cool in the summer
[23:54] father and now I pray Lord that you
[23:56] would just send a coolness of your holy
[23:58] spirit with us today Lord because
[23:59] without you we have no service Lord
[24:02] without you there's nothing for us to do
[24:05] here but with you here Lord
[24:07] Lord send the power
[24:10] as you said we'd be endued with power
[24:12] from on high Lord just fill us all with
[24:14] the Holy Spirit tonight give us a
[24:16] supercharge during the middle of the
[24:17] week Lord I pray this should be the ones
[24:19] of the sixth sister Freedom different
[24:21] ones Lord just take care of those
[24:23] situations father and sister Joyce and
[24:25] and Lord many ones that that are sick
[24:28] that's that's not with us and haven't
[24:29] been with us for for a little while we
[24:31] pray that you would strengthen them Lord
[24:33] You're Still the Healer you're still the
[24:35] great physician and Lord you're the ones
[24:37] that will you're the one that will take
[24:39] care of all these needs father we ask in
[24:41] Jesus name
[24:43] amen now something we're going to talk
[24:44] about tonight is is um how the Holy
[24:48] Spirit you know it took a prophet to
[24:50] tell us that the Holy Spirit was timid
[24:53] and he and many times about 28 to 30
[24:55] times he he addressed the holy spirit
[24:58] being timid in a service or in a
[25:01] situation or in prayer or in other
[25:03] things in life the holy spirit is really
[25:05] timid so we're going to talk about that
[25:06] maybe just a little bit because because
[25:08] the Bible says grieve not the Holy
[25:10] Spirit we'll read in just a minute well
[25:12] if you don't want these virtues if you
[25:14] don't want to be part of the Statue of
[25:16] perfect man if you don't want to be a
[25:18] perfect image of God
[25:19] you can grieve the Holy Spirit
[25:23] and just lock him down to where he
[25:25] cannot move and that was what happened
[25:28] in the church ages because brother Brown
[25:29] talks about
[25:31] that we were during the church ages they
[25:33] became cold formal and Powerless why
[25:35] they had some of the word of God they
[25:37] had the holy spirit for their age but
[25:39] they became powerless because they bound
[25:42] the Holy Spirit under what false
[25:44] Doctrine now what we're trying to do is
[25:46] get that false Doctrine out of us us
[25:49] get that false Doctrine away from us to
[25:51] where the Lord can move freely in our
[25:54] hearts and lives amen so let's read in
[25:57] the beginning was the word where with
[25:58] God and the Word was God and the Word
[26:00] was made flesh and dwelt among us we
[26:02] beheld his glory the glory the only
[26:03] begotten of the father
[26:05] for the grace and truth John 3 3 says
[26:07] Jesus answered and said verily verily in
[26:09] other words listen listen I say unto
[26:11] thee except the man be born again he
[26:13] cannot see the kingdom of God
[26:16] then of course Nicodemus being the great
[26:18] teacher he goes back to the carnality of
[26:20] his mind and he says do I have to go
[26:22] back in my mother's womb Jesus said no
[26:24] except a man be born of water and a
[26:26] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[26:28] of God that which is born of the flesh
[26:29] is flesh born of the spirit of spirit
[26:32] Marvel not
[26:33] that I said unto you you must
[26:36] be born again you'll be seated he didn't
[26:38] say you need to be or you might ought to
[26:40] be he said you must be born again he is
[26:43] compelled each and every one of us to be
[26:45] filled with the Holy Ghost all right and
[26:48] that's why we're looking at the bottom
[26:49] of that pyramid it's wide because the
[26:51] Lord can can begin to move in your life
[26:54] if you have the baptism of the Holy
[26:55] Ghost and he fills you with the spirit
[26:57] of God he can he it's like a newborn
[26:59] babe it's like something you know while
[27:01] I'm out of the womb and I've got this
[27:03] whole new world that I'm looking at and
[27:05] then all of a sudden though the cares of
[27:07] Life takes over you get hungry you have
[27:08] dirty diapers you have this you have
[27:10] that you become a teenager mom and daddy
[27:12] says you can't do this and you can't do
[27:14] that right
[27:16] then what do you do you Rebel and that's
[27:19] what we do even as Christians yes as
[27:22] Christians we Rebel all right because
[27:24] the Bible says grieve not well grieving
[27:26] is what grieving is rebelling how are
[27:28] you the most grieved to your children
[27:30] when they disobey you it Grieves you the
[27:34] most we call it mad sometimes
[27:37] but mostly it's grief because remember
[27:39] that old thing that it'll hurt me more
[27:41] than it hurts you
[27:43] yeah okay
[27:44] kids you'll understand that one day if
[27:46] the Lord tears and you have children it
[27:47] will hurt you because it tears your
[27:49] heart out to have to what to have to
[27:51] correct you one you've been told over
[27:53] and over and over again just like
[27:55] um
[27:56] um this past weekend
[27:58] and different times I've been noticing
[28:00] and and that's kind of why I think the
[28:03] Lord kind of brought me back to that
[28:05] um
[28:06] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[28:07] because
[28:09] remember brother Brown says one
[28:11] one child running through this building
[28:14] could cause the next service what
[28:16] happens the holy spirit is bound
[28:19] and it leaves the building
[28:21] right now I'm telling you what a prophet
[28:23] says so he could see those things it
[28:25] wasn't we're not presuming we're not
[28:27] trying to read in a book that James
[28:30] Dobson thought mine and Lord help James
[28:32] Dobson he's good for his time but he
[28:34] wasn't a prophet he couldn't see into
[28:37] another dimension to see that Holy
[28:39] Spirit I'll read it here in just a
[28:40] little while where he says the whole you
[28:42] know in other words the holy spirit's
[28:43] all over the building let's let's not
[28:45] let's not let's not get emotional let's
[28:48] not get all this that's what that's why
[28:49] I don't I don't get about people because
[28:51] brother Branham calmed people down
[28:54] for prayer lines
[28:56] boy that hurts your feelings doesn't it
[28:58] but he calmed people down he said calm
[29:00] down don't move
[29:02] he was in total control why because he
[29:04] said every one of you is a spirit he
[29:06] said I can see these Spirits moving and
[29:08] you know what it was doing it was
[29:09] confusing him
[29:11] because they were doing this you know if
[29:13] you were moving back and forth and and
[29:14] also I want you to please I we need
[29:17] prayer for for for children's bladder in
[29:20] this in this church
[29:24] and I'm not joking
[29:27] your kid can sit for three hours and
[29:30] play on a computer and never go to the
[29:31] bathroom
[29:33] but you let the preacher get about 15
[29:35] minutes into a service mama I gotta go
[29:38] tell them to sit there for a little
[29:39] while
[29:41] my mama didn't I never peed in my pants
[29:43] one time let me just be real real
[29:45] playing William she's sitting at home
[29:47] watching she knows that for a fact she
[29:49] said you sit there boy
[29:51] then maybe when you get tears in your
[29:53] eyes and you just really start bubbling
[29:54] you know you say Mom I gotta go
[29:56] but
[29:58] we don't need that to happen during a
[30:00] service to where now we're we're a
[30:02] little bit bigger than we used to be
[30:04] we've got more kids we've got more young
[30:06] people
[30:07] just be careful remember I told you I
[30:09] don't you know one time it's okay but
[30:11] now when one kid goes three or four
[30:12] times we need prayer for the sick
[30:18] that's why we got deacons we got deacons
[30:19] gonna be telling you hey stop go back
[30:22] and sit down
[30:24] go back and sit down in the seat you can
[30:25] go in a little while I don't care if
[30:27] they do that they should do that
[30:29] especially when they walk by them four
[30:31] four or five times same person now if
[30:33] you're sick there's a different story
[30:34] and I'd say here you go everybody's like
[30:36] well what about okay well what about but
[30:39] what about you just letting your kid go
[30:40] to the bathroom anytime they go I gotta
[30:41] go
[30:42] no they don't have to go
[30:47] let me ask you a question didn't you
[30:50] when you were growing up in a church
[30:52] you always wanted to go to the bathroom
[30:54] and you really didn't have to go
[30:57] let me see the old people say amen
[31:00] that's what I thought so guess what your
[31:02] kids ain't no different
[31:04] I don't care they're Halos held up by
[31:06] horns just like the rest of them
[31:09] all right First Peter 1 verse 22 but now
[31:11] I'm telling you uh we wonder sometimes
[31:14] why that we fail as a church brother
[31:16] Brown says that it's because the holy
[31:19] spirit's timid and you'll just drive him
[31:20] out on a limb
[31:22] and he'll sit there until you call him
[31:24] back well we're going to call him back
[31:26] we're going to make sure that we even
[31:28] our kids we don't just don't let them go
[31:30] to the bathroom all the time and and let
[31:33] them go beforehand and I know we have
[31:35] only three bathrooms and I'm sorry I
[31:37] apologize that we don't have enough room
[31:39] but if you'll pray hard enough we'll
[31:41] work on that we'll either pray all y'all
[31:43] out of here anyway
[31:46] we'll pray you some room okay
[31:50] and I'm serious I know that I know it's
[31:52] hard
[31:53] being crunched in a in a small building
[31:55] with a group of people but still you can
[31:58] be more observant all right
[32:02] um
[32:03] I mean they're your kids
[32:05] you watch after them
[32:09] you made them
[32:12] you handle them
[32:15] amen that's our job that's our job as
[32:18] parents it's not just something that we
[32:19] might do or need to do you must be born
[32:21] again
[32:22] you must be parents to your children or
[32:25] we will grieve the Holy Spirit and you
[32:27] think why sometimes you see the Holy
[32:28] Spirit moving and all of a sudden it
[32:30] just goes
[32:31] well you never know you know you never
[32:33] know what's going on back there or
[32:35] something uh let's just try to let let's
[32:38] get this let's get this thing moving and
[32:40] and in the right direction and number
[32:43] one I don't want the Holy Spirit to ever
[32:44] feel uncomfortable in this building I
[32:47] want the devil to feel uncomfortable in
[32:49] this building all right seeing that you
[32:51] purified your souls and obeying the
[32:53] truth through the spirit under unfeigned
[32:55] love of the Brethren see that you love
[32:57] one another with a pure heart fervently
[33:00] you see I the way I the way I see it is
[33:03] the way I've been for a couple years
[33:04] being up here you know and and helping
[33:07] to guide for a little while you you see
[33:09] that you you look at that one scripture
[33:12] and you say all right you you have love
[33:15] for the Brethren whether they love you
[33:16] or not
[33:17] you have love for those that are
[33:19] unlovable you have love for those that's
[33:20] not even in the building
[33:23] because I what you know what that does
[33:25] that's what brings them into building
[33:27] that's what brings them back to God is
[33:30] not you being you being a hound dog
[33:32] yourself
[33:34] doing things you're not supposed to do
[33:35] outside in front of them
[33:39] but we have unfeigned love it's a love
[33:41] that there's no condition it's a love
[33:43] that that that I don't it doesn't bother
[33:45] me if brother Donnie doesn't shake my
[33:47] hand but now he makes a point to do it
[33:49] and I appreciate that but if he doesn't
[33:51] then I just want to see his soul save
[33:54] all right I want to see your soul and I
[33:57] want you to see your kids Soul slave
[33:59] I'm really not worried about your
[34:01] feelings y'all ought to know that by now
[34:02] I just don't I don't work on feelings
[34:04] all right I'm sorry I do have a heart
[34:06] but I don't have a whole lot of feelings
[34:07] all right because feelings were What
[34:09] feelings will guide you in the wrong
[34:10] direction it'll make you make the wrong
[34:12] decision right
[34:14] all right okay so the Bible tells us
[34:16] Peter tells us being born again all
[34:19] right so listen this is a work this is a
[34:22] work it's not just I'm born again now
[34:24] I'm going to sit down on a rock
[34:26] no that's when brother Brown said that's
[34:28] when the battle really begins all right
[34:30] so being born again not of corruptable
[34:32] seed in other words breaking away from
[34:35] your Humanity your feelings
[34:37] but of Incorruptible what by the word of
[34:40] God which liveth and a body forever
[34:42] brother forever brother down stood up
[34:43] here years and years and years and he's
[34:45] told us just like Paul Paul's preaching
[34:48] his heart out and he's seeing people
[34:49] walk away and he's seeing people you
[34:52] know do you know go away and you see
[34:53] brother around him he comes and he
[34:54] preaches and he preaches to the
[34:56] Pentecostals it's supposed to be up the
[34:58] ones up here at the time all right there
[34:59] wasn't a lot of message Believers while
[35:01] he was preaching okay he was about the
[35:03] only one that believed the message okay
[35:05] at that time but he was trying to see a
[35:08] group mature and they weren't maturing
[35:12] the Pentecostals he said you get worse
[35:14] every year he said I come to California
[35:15] he said you cut your hair more he said I
[35:17] preach on it you cut your hair more what
[35:19] they didn't get a revelation all right
[35:21] so we want a revelation from God that'll
[35:22] what make us go forward
[35:24] that will make us go forward that if
[35:26] that if if a preacher does come in here
[35:28] and he sees people you know falling
[35:30] apart and wearing makeup and cutting
[35:32] their hair and all that stuff and then
[35:33] all of a sudden the next service he
[35:35] comes and they quit doing that and the
[35:36] next service like Cindy used to do
[35:39] I mean she's a prime example
[35:41] lovered her dad she came in here with
[35:43] all painted up and fingernails looked
[35:46] like the devil and all other kind of
[35:48] stuff and but you know what Brookdale
[35:50] just kept preaching he never looked at
[35:52] her and said hey you shouldn't do that
[35:53] he wouldn't weave it in the message you
[35:55] know that but he never did beat her over
[35:57] the head and you know what about two or
[35:58] three months later she quit wearing
[35:59] pants
[36:00] just quit cutting her hair
[36:02] and I believe she received the Holy
[36:04] Ghost right here in her simple way
[36:07] that evening that evening Services she
[36:10] came up here I just really do you say
[36:12] well where's she now well she's in a
[36:13] nursing home or wherever she is so her
[36:15] body's gone
[36:16] but her mind's still sharp and and she's
[36:19] wearing not wearing pants and not
[36:21] wearing makeup you know so what happened
[36:23] that's what I'm looking for
[36:25] I'm not looking for y'all to come to
[36:27] church every Sunday and you still cut
[36:28] your hair and you still paint your
[36:29] fingernails and all that I'm okay anyway
[36:31] you must be born again God bless his
[36:33] word
[36:35] and I want to take the subject this
[36:36] morning of Jesus's first Doctrine so his
[36:38] first Doctrine was what you must be born
[36:40] again
[36:41] now we find out that there's so many
[36:43] different meanings so we've been trying
[36:45] to and we know that that even in the
[36:47] message ranks there's many meanings to
[36:49] the word being born again
[36:51] all right being born again as we were
[36:53] talking not too long ago
[36:56] me and somebody was talking and and
[36:58] people say well brother Graham changed
[37:00] it after the seals because he got this
[37:02] great Revelation well you know what the
[37:04] great Revelation he got was that you
[37:05] must be born again the same as you was
[37:07] back then that he preached back there
[37:08] because on future home he said he said
[37:11] praise God he said I've been preaching
[37:13] these three stages all the way through
[37:15] my Ministry and have never changed well
[37:17] that was way after the seals was praised
[37:19] it is not just believing this message
[37:22] it is not just believing brother Brown
[37:24] was a prophet or cut not cutting your
[37:26] hair or not painting your face or not
[37:28] doing those things do's and don'ts
[37:30] it's being born again like brother Luke
[37:32] said Christ is who we're getting born
[37:34] again under not brother Branham Christ
[37:37] is who the one who's going to lead us
[37:38] and guide us into all truth and if you
[37:41] have that Christ inside of you it will
[37:43] lead you to the message it'll have to it
[37:46] can't deny the word for the day remember
[37:48] you know what brother Brown said the
[37:50] reason you know you have the Holy Ghost
[37:51] is what the word what inside of you
[37:53] agrees with the word for your day now
[37:55] see we agree with Luther
[37:57] Plus
[37:59] we agree with Luther to a point now we
[38:01] don't go to the pub and drink a beer and
[38:03] smoke a pot
[38:05] but Luther was allowed to do that under
[38:07] justification he was trying to get the
[38:09] people out of the Catholic church and
[38:10] get them Born Again under Luther's
[38:12] message but that won't get you born
[38:13] again because why God moved
[38:16] he moved up to Wesley and then from
[38:18] Wesley to Pentecost and then from
[38:20] Pentecost he brought it out as one of
[38:22] the brothers that was talking the other
[38:23] day we're grain
[38:25] this is not plant stock
[38:28] not even Chuck because the Shucks pulled
[38:31] away or pulling away right now and we've
[38:34] come back to the full grain so there's
[38:36] not another plant to come it's full seed
[38:39] to come all right and we find out
[38:42] there's so many different meanings that
[38:43] people put nearly all churches and we
[38:45] know that for a fact ask a Methodist how
[38:48] do you know you're born again
[38:50] just ask them ask a Pentecostal how do
[38:52] you know you're born again they'll tell
[38:53] you because I spoke in tongues
[38:56] amen I mean you'll guess what you'll get
[38:58] I've heard it myself through in my own
[39:00] ears
[39:01] but brother Brian said there must be and
[39:02] there's a truth somewhere and now
[39:04] remember it didn't say you ought to be
[39:05] born again it says You must be born
[39:07] again so God had to send us a prophet
[39:09] and that Prophet was a mouthpiece I was
[39:11] thinking today
[39:13] I was reading an article that brother
[39:16] um
[39:18] Tim Pruitt wrote about brother Branham
[39:22] and how the the the Belize assigned
[39:24] people have all these fallacies of
[39:26] brother Branham and his life and all
[39:28] these different things and some of them
[39:29] are true
[39:31] he's a human
[39:33] he's a human being
[39:35] but the word
[39:38] it brought me clarity
[39:40] it brought Christ to me not in a portion
[39:43] but in a hole it brought the whole
[39:46] person all right
[39:48] and that's what's required they weren't
[39:49] required the whole person they were
[39:51] required parts of the body
[39:54] that is our requirement now the full
[39:57] headship with the body underneath that
[40:01] when the head says move
[40:03] the arm moves it's not when the arm says
[40:05] move the head moves
[40:07] no
[40:08] when the head says move the arm moves
[40:10] all right brother Brown says look you're
[40:13] still what you are until you're actually
[40:15] born again of the spirit of God it
[40:17] doesn't change you in other words it
[40:18] doesn't change you to be shaking a hand
[40:20] or to fill out a form
[40:23] or press play or not press play whatever
[40:26] it is it's not going to change you
[40:28] what's going to change you is the Inside
[40:30] Man so that's what we're looking at is
[40:32] for the Holy Ghost to burn out that old
[40:35] part of you now listen you're still
[40:37] going to we know that you're still going
[40:38] to have problems with the this guy
[40:41] because he he's three a Triune being
[40:44] he's three parts
[40:46] and thank God that we're three parts
[40:49] because a lot of times and let me just
[40:52] go ahead and forward this through and
[40:53] and maybe not be so long tonight
[40:56] when it says grieve not the holy spirit
[40:58] of God whereby you're a seal to the day
[41:00] of your Redemption a lot of you and me
[41:02] and a lot of Christian believers
[41:06] take that as I'm not born again when
[41:08] they feel that
[41:13] I've got one
[41:15] Aaron's like me
[41:18] but it happens to all of us
[41:20] you see people struggle
[41:22] and they think they're not born again so
[41:24] they need to be baptized again and they
[41:25] need to be this and they need to come to
[41:27] the Altar and they need to no
[41:30] find out what grieved him
[41:33] work on that one thing
[41:35] [Music]
[41:36] okay life is gonna happen you're gonna
[41:38] have bills your kids are going to do
[41:40] idiotic things
[41:42] because you did it too
[41:45] praise the Lord
[41:47] right
[41:49] well now everybody's going yep exactly
[41:51] right
[41:52] but those are things in life though put
[41:55] that aside
[41:56] quit struggling when you've already got
[41:59] the thing down inside that you need
[42:01] but what's the devil's job the devil's
[42:03] job say
[42:04] I don't think you got that you wouldn't
[42:08] do that now you you wouldn't burn Tony's
[42:11] chicken
[42:14] chicken
[42:16] no they ain't got nothing to do with
[42:17] that's life that's just her not cooking
[42:19] good
[42:21] which is the fallacy
[42:25] an example only and you know what
[42:27] everybody knew that because you all the
[42:28] all the women jump said what
[42:32] but now those things we've got to be
[42:34] able to separate them and I think even
[42:35] in the Statue of perfect man that's what
[42:37] we're doing is helping me
[42:40] I've helped you guys praise the Lord but
[42:43] it's helping me to separate that time
[42:45] that that I think well man I ain't even
[42:47] born again
[42:49] okay if I have if I've got this you know
[42:52] situation that I got and I just totally
[42:54] fail
[42:56] everybody with me I just totally fall on
[43:00] my face you know what get back up you
[43:02] all you've done is you just grieve that
[43:04] timid man that's inside of you
[43:07] you have grieved him in he's kind of
[43:09] steps aside and brother Brown said he'll
[43:11] stay there until you what call him back
[43:13] so how are you going to call him back
[43:15] you're going to call him back with vice
[43:17] versa of what you did to put him out
[43:20] there on a limb because remember look
[43:21] he's not gonna just I know you're gonna
[43:24] fail I'm just gonna stay out here no you
[43:26] send him out there with something you
[43:28] did
[43:29] we send him out there with something we
[43:32] did
[43:33] because he's not just gonna go well I
[43:35] know I'm you no I can't stand you no he
[43:37] loves you he loves to occupy your body
[43:43] thank you
[43:45] he loves you with the love this
[43:46] unconditional
[43:48] but we make it conditional
[43:51] and grieve him
[43:53] and then what did you do he just steps
[43:55] over to the side and he says okay I'm
[43:57] going to let you fight that battle
[44:00] I know I'm gonna have to come on the
[44:02] scene and help you and I know when but
[44:04] you don't
[44:05] so here's your child training
[44:07] here's your here's here's where I'm
[44:09] going to show up as a parent and I'm
[44:10] going to help you
[44:12] so our nature to begin with is sinful so
[44:15] listen so the holy spirit that Tim and
[44:17] holy spirit is not going to dwell in
[44:18] your soul if you have sin in your soul
[44:22] sin in your soul means you're not born
[44:25] again
[44:27] pretty plain you have sin in your spirit
[44:31] but remember a Christian can't sin
[44:33] because the seed remaineth in him
[44:37] your soul is perfect it's God in another
[44:41] form
[44:42] but we've got to realize how to separate
[44:45] that and put that over to the side maybe
[44:47] as we say in our own in our own language
[44:50] put it over to the side and let's start
[44:52] working on this thing where the ball
[44:54] we're bouncing
[44:58] we're creating a lot of noise
[45:01] so he just steps over here
[45:03] okay fight the battle I'm gonna help you
[45:07] but I'm not going to jump in real quick
[45:10] I'm gonna let you fight the thing and
[45:12] that's what we do but that doesn't mean
[45:13] you're not born again that doesn't mean
[45:14] you have to run to the altar that
[45:16] doesn't mean see what brother Brown says
[45:18] and and we get it
[45:20] I know we need the altar but brother
[45:22] Brown said every time you come up here
[45:24] you get weaker now I'm telling you
[45:26] exactly what he said
[45:29] you get weak or when you why because
[45:31] your faith is put in right here not
[45:34] right there
[45:35] I want the faith to be put in there not
[45:38] up here
[45:39] this may fail you
[45:44] but you get it inside your heart setting
[45:46] where you're at tonight or whenever you
[45:48] come to church you won't need to come up
[45:50] here
[45:52] when we realize that we are children of
[45:55] God we are
[45:57] Kings and Priests we're not waiting
[45:59] waiting to be
[46:01] listen
[46:02] brother Brown said one time he said how
[46:04] can you rule you know how can we rule
[46:06] and Reign if we can't Rule and Reign
[46:07] this first
[46:10] and this might be just a Wednesday night
[46:12] Wednesday night
[46:13] but roll this guy first this is listen
[46:15] this is where the Holy Ghost dwells
[46:21] that's where your Holy Ghost yours don't
[46:22] dwell in me
[46:24] it's the same person
[46:26] but you're a person
[46:28] and brother Brown said it's God and you
[46:31] in there as persons because God deals me
[46:34] different with me different than he does
[46:36] you but it's the same Holy Ghost and
[46:37] it's in the same place
[46:39] it's in your soul so if you you know if
[46:42] you stumble and fall or if you
[46:44] you know you think well man I shouldn't
[46:46] have done that I know I must not be born
[46:47] again
[46:49] if the devil told you that's a lie we
[46:52] know that all right so don't write just
[46:54] put your anchor in faith
[46:57] that big old wide foundation and just
[46:59] say hey
[47:01] be like that guy says Lord if I don't
[47:04] have it you'll find a bag of bones right
[47:06] here
[47:07] till I get it
[47:09] that's how direct we have to be
[47:12] because you see it we're talking about
[47:14] the Old Testament
[47:16] they didn't receive a promise you and I
[47:19] received a promise
[47:21] in the beginning and the in the hinge
[47:23] point between the Old Testament and the
[47:25] New Testament we received the promise
[47:29] a promise of the Holy Ghost
[47:31] all right I promise this promising is to
[47:33] you and your children the promise of the
[47:35] Holy Ghost not just anointing you and
[47:38] not just making you act like a Christian
[47:40] but it makes you a Christian
[47:44] God having provided some better thing
[47:46] for us okay so we got a better thing
[47:50] that they without us
[47:52] should not be made complete
[47:56] because we as humans we always when we
[47:58] come to that word perfect we say no way
[48:02] right
[48:04] you ain't perfect that ain't perfect
[48:05] well the Bible never says that
[48:09] the Bible never quotes
[48:12] it says be therefore perfect it talks
[48:15] about having perfect faith it talks
[48:16] about having the promise it's to you and
[48:19] your children and them that far off as
[48:20] means the Lord that God shall call you
[48:22] will see you shall receive the gift
[48:25] are the promise of the Holy Ghost in
[48:28] your soul
[48:30] I think sometimes we get away from that
[48:33] but it's a promise
[48:35] that you can hold God to that promise
[48:37] and kids everybody anybody that's been
[48:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:41] Christ you just stand right there and
[48:43] say Lord
[48:44] this is it
[48:46] I'm not going back to that water again
[48:47] because you didn't promise me three or
[48:49] four times you said one time
[48:52] repent
[48:54] and be baptized and receive the Holy
[48:57] Ghost put yourself in the position that
[49:00] listen then God has to do what he said
[49:03] I want to put God in position where he
[49:06] has to do what he says
[49:09] what about a prophet stood up one day
[49:10] and said if God don't do this and that
[49:12] like he did it before he said you can
[49:14] call him a liar
[49:16] well now who's going to call God a liar
[49:19] but he made it pretty plain that if God
[49:21] didn't do what he said with the same set
[49:23] of situations now you got to be the same
[49:25] set of situation repent be baptized and
[49:29] receive the promise all right don't
[49:31] repent don't don't skip the repent part
[49:33] feel you need to just be baptized and
[49:35] then you quit going to church or you
[49:36] don't read your Bible you don't do
[49:39] you just got wet
[49:41] okay but I promise you if you'll repent
[49:44] number one you feel a whole lot better
[49:47] if you'll really repent then what we'll
[49:49] do God will watch in Ezekiel that's what
[49:52] we're coming to a new heart I will give
[49:54] you
[49:55] and a new spirit will I put within you
[49:57] you've got to realize and I want to
[49:59] hammer this home for the next several
[50:02] Services you've got to know where you're
[50:05] at in your journey
[50:08] you've got to know
[50:10] it's not you must I mean you you might
[50:12] need to know you must know
[50:15] to go up these virtues to get the
[50:20] to get the spiritual part of these
[50:22] virtues you've got to know where you're
[50:24] at
[50:25] man you got to know where you're at and
[50:27] brother Brown said you can know where
[50:28] you can know where you're at with God at
[50:30] any time some of us just don't want to
[50:32] know
[50:34] but I want to know Amen
[50:36] in some way somehow God will vindicate
[50:39] in your life where you're at if you'll
[50:41] just hang on a minute
[50:42] because you know the devil's here in
[50:44] this same sermon
[50:46] so he's going to fill you with the same
[50:47] junk that he's filled you with before
[50:49] well you can't do this you ain't done
[50:50] Latin isn't it
[50:52] he's a liar
[50:54] but a new heart
[50:56] can you not feel that when you first
[50:58] started your journey I know every one of
[51:00] us some of you how many of you were born
[51:02] and was just like raised in the message
[51:08] centers anyway
[51:11] worse
[51:15] because you thought that's what saved
[51:17] you
[51:17] and I know you don't now I know you
[51:19] don't now but you might have it one time
[51:22] thought that well salvation comes
[51:23] through believing what Mom and Daddy
[51:25] believe and I'm coming to church with
[51:26] them and that's about the best I can do
[51:28] no you have to
[51:31] have a new heart
[51:33] nothing new
[51:35] and a new spirit will I put within you
[51:38] in other words something comfortable I
[51:40] used to come twice a year
[51:45] I did you did a lot of y'all did too
[51:47] come twice a year it was at Christmas
[51:49] and Easter crowd you know oh and if they
[51:51] had a special time when when Esther was
[51:55] cooking her her wonderful squash
[51:57] casserole fill the pews but anyway
[52:02] you feed them they'll come in like
[52:04] brother Dale said you get them in with a
[52:05] hot dog you can get them out with a
[52:06] hamburger all right
[52:08] but if you'll get a new spirit then
[52:10] that's where that it's not it's where
[52:12] you want to come
[52:14] it's where you want that you you want
[52:16] and then all this other stuff is great
[52:17] just gravy to me but a new spirit but
[52:20] but when I used to come to church I'd
[52:22] sit there and and honest to God folks I
[52:24] didn't want to come
[52:26] you didn't either
[52:29] I didn't want to come
[52:32] because I didn't come back that's what
[52:34] proof that I didn't want to come but I
[52:37] did it for my mom
[52:39] and my family which and that's okay
[52:43] at least I came to church twice
[52:45] okay
[52:47] better than some but
[52:49] what did it do
[52:52] it just absolutely made me feel horrible
[52:55] because there was a spirit inside of me
[52:57] that didn't like being here
[53:00] I was comfortable out there
[53:05] all right I was comfortable out there
[53:08] oh it was like you know that was my
[53:09] security blanket I could go out there
[53:11] and do what I wanted to but when I came
[53:12] in here I had to
[53:16] and pay attention try to stay awake
[53:20] right let's just be honest with each
[53:22] other
[53:23] but when God got a hold of me and gave
[53:25] me a new heart
[53:27] and gave me a new spirit he gave me a
[53:29] zeal
[53:31] that when I walked in that door
[53:33] I was so comfortable
[53:36] when I come to this church in any church
[53:38] I'm not uncomfortable if you're
[53:40] uncomfortable we do need to pray for you
[53:43] amen
[53:45] and if you'll get it if you'll get it
[53:47] out there and get done there with it
[53:49] instead of bringing it in here you won't
[53:51] have to go out there with it again
[53:56] um
[53:58] I'll take away your Stony heart and I'll
[54:01] give you a heart of Flesh
[54:03] we all were rebellious
[54:07] we all didn't care
[54:10] we didn't care about this church thing
[54:12] you know singing songs and coming to
[54:15] church and listening to a preacher and
[54:16] back then Brothers you got two hours two
[54:19] and a half three
[54:21] all right
[54:24] we endured
[54:26] but now
[54:28] that same thing that same situation
[54:30] because I'm born again now that changes
[54:35] that whole scenario puts me in the same
[54:38] place
[54:40] but with a different spirit
[54:42] with a different attitude that I knew
[54:46] I knew going to not just fill me with
[54:48] the Holy Ghost he's going to keep
[54:49] filling me he's going to keep teaching
[54:51] me he's still going to lead me and guide
[54:53] me into all truth he's not going to send
[54:55] me out to where I come in here and I say
[54:56] well the message is wrong there's
[54:58] nothing good about this I'm gone no
[55:00] there was something inside
[55:03] they said that ain't nothing but the
[55:05] truth
[55:07] because in one day he said I'll put my
[55:09] spirit now when he puts his spirit
[55:10] inside of you how can it be rebellious
[55:13] to the word of God
[55:15] how can God fight God
[55:19] just the same as when Jesus said how can
[55:21] Satan fight Satan how can God fight God
[55:25] it's not the conflict between God and
[55:27] God
[55:28] it's a conflict between the devil and
[55:31] God all right and remember what brother
[55:33] Chris preached you're the you're the
[55:35] Battleground
[55:37] but when he puts yours his Spirit within
[55:39] you he causes you to walk in all these
[55:43] things that we thought were law
[55:47] our do's and don'ts
[55:50] I have to do this I have no you want to
[55:55] because the guy that wrote this book is
[55:57] inside of you now
[56:00] oh Ezekiel no the spirit that was in
[56:02] ezekiel's inside of you though
[56:04] Joshua no the spirit that's in Joshua's
[56:06] inside of you
[56:09] there's your difference
[56:11] then we know we go through justification
[56:12] sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost
[56:14] we're not we're going to skip every bit
[56:15] of that because we already been through
[56:17] it we know what we we should know now
[56:20] that what the Holy Ghost was sent for
[56:22] was to what teach us things
[56:25] all right
[56:27] you say no I've got to shout or speak in
[56:30] tongues see there we go back to the same
[56:32] old thing of of passing out well this is
[56:35] what the Holy Ghost says and that's it
[56:38] brother Brian said it was believing the
[56:40] word for your day right all right well
[56:43] now believe in the word for your day
[56:44] don't keep you out of church
[56:51] somebody else does
[56:53] the word of your day does not teach you
[56:56] to wear pants or us to curse or us to
[57:00] smoke or we always talk about the women
[57:01] hair and dress we're about as dirty as
[57:04] they you know
[57:05] or dirty
[57:08] but we take now and we see that all
[57:11] these years I was thinking today
[57:14] I watched a little snippet where brother
[57:16] Dale was preaching well actually
[57:18] um
[57:20] well I'm gonna give them a I'm gonna
[57:21] give him a crown
[57:22] the people in Ohio
[57:25] you know they've kind of they've got
[57:26] their own Pastor now
[57:28] um
[57:30] um
[57:34] I want to call him Richard for some some
[57:37] silly reason but that's his daddy but
[57:39] his name is Richard but Isaac is his
[57:41] name that we call him brother Isis to
[57:43] Pastor the church down they're doing
[57:44] quite well
[57:45] but they still every week
[57:48] they pick a series that either brother
[57:51] Dale preached back in the 2000s
[57:55] or one that I preach
[57:57] in the 2015-1617 they just finished the
[58:00] seal but they're watching Daddy and and
[58:02] brother Elisha was sent he sent me a
[58:06] WhatsApp or I mean a Marco Polo and he
[58:08] pointed up to the screen in his house
[58:10] and he was watching brother Dale was
[58:12] preaching on a series about something
[58:14] see that's what teaching's about
[58:16] and I'm not putting brother anything if
[58:19] you're if your Holy Spirit does not say
[58:21] I need to listen to more than just
[58:24] Sunday and Wednesday
[58:28] if you want to feed off of something
[58:31] else you need a different feeder
[58:36] but they sit down
[58:39] and they as a collective group before
[58:41] they before brother Isaac took over as a
[58:43] collective group they sat down and they
[58:45] would watch the whole series
[58:47] on Wednesday night they would get
[58:48] together watch the whole series of
[58:50] whoever was preaching then they would
[58:54] pick up our Wednesday service on archive
[58:57] and they'd listen to it right before
[58:58] they went to bed now how many of y'all
[59:00] do that
[59:02] I'm sorry how many of us do that
[59:06] but it brought in remembrance when he
[59:07] pointed his finger up to him and yeah
[59:09] he's my dad okay I don't want I went I
[59:11] didn't pick him
[59:13] okay
[59:14] but you've pretty doggone good preacher
[59:16] whether he's my daddy or not all right
[59:19] okay Daddy or not I was just blessed to
[59:21] have a spiritual father a natural father
[59:23] and all that
[59:25] and I still messed up
[59:29] yeah
[59:31] I still left for 20 years
[59:34] but anyway when he pointed up there to
[59:36] brother Dale you could see
[59:39] I see him now and I saw him see him then
[59:42] he was just so sharp
[59:44] but that was the Holy Spirit teaching us
[59:46] over all those years and what's your
[59:48] point by the way somewhere that's got to
[59:50] come to fruition if it was the Holy
[59:52] Spirit
[59:53] it's got to come to fruition somebody's
[59:55] got to grab a hold of that and like we
[59:58] talked about and listen don't put it on
[1:00:00] a man
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:06] William
[1:00:07] he was a mouthpiece to bring it it was
[1:00:10] somebody God chose that yielded himself
[1:00:12] brother Dale different ones yielding
[1:00:14] themselves so that they could bring you
[1:00:16] a message
[1:00:18] now what do you do with it
[1:00:20] is your business
[1:00:27] that's why I see the message
[1:00:29] the way we were taught in this church is
[1:00:32] it's a it's the word of God in human
[1:00:35] flesh speaking to your human flesh and
[1:00:38] that Holy Spirit if it's in there it'll
[1:00:40] speak right through that flesh right
[1:00:43] into your soul if it's not it's just
[1:00:47] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[1:00:49] it's just words on a page brother Brown
[1:00:51] same ways just words on a page
[1:00:54] if we don't have the Holy Spirit to
[1:00:56] teach us see that's Bible
[1:00:59] actually that's Jesus talking to us so
[1:01:01] he's telling us what's going to happen
[1:01:03] when this Holy Ghost is going to come
[1:01:06] not upon you but in you
[1:01:08] he's going to bring all things to your
[1:01:10] remembrance whatsoever I have said
[1:01:14] unto you
[1:01:16] Luke 24 49 behold I send the promise of
[1:01:21] my father upon you but carry you in the
[1:01:23] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:01:25] with power
[1:01:27] from on high now we know that in due
[1:01:29] means to put on clothe with I like that
[1:01:31] one where it says in the sense of
[1:01:33] sinking into a garment
[1:01:36] not this garment
[1:01:38] your flesh garment all right so it's
[1:01:41] going to sink in it's going to be in
[1:01:42] dude it's not just going to those licks
[1:01:44] of fire just didn't follow him around
[1:01:47] no it disappeared inside of them went
[1:01:50] into those people and whatever that
[1:01:52] pillar fire was they became that
[1:01:57] remember they weren't called Christians
[1:01:59] until Christ got in them
[1:02:02] you're not a Christian until God gets
[1:02:04] inside of you
[1:02:07] so he said you being dude with dunamis
[1:02:09] or what power now look the difference in
[1:02:11] the two dunamis is an inherent power now
[1:02:15] what happened though when Jesus was here
[1:02:17] in Matthew he actually gave them power
[1:02:22] now watch that's excusa which is a
[1:02:26] different kind of power because what
[1:02:28] he'd done it gave them Authority it
[1:02:29] didn't give them permanent Authority
[1:02:34] when you have when you have dunamis
[1:02:37] power you have permanent authority over
[1:02:39] the devil
[1:02:40] you have permanent authority over you
[1:02:45] exclusive power can come on you and come
[1:02:49] off you because he said look here cast
[1:02:51] out devils
[1:02:53] do this preach the gospel Judas was
[1:02:56] there
[1:02:59] but did he receive the Holy Ghost no he
[1:03:01] got excusia he never got dunamis
[1:03:04] because dunamis is an inherent power in
[1:03:07] other words what you inherits what's
[1:03:08] inside of you
[1:03:09] something came down inside of you and
[1:03:11] then they what they were called
[1:03:12] Christians in Antioch because they acted
[1:03:14] like
[1:03:16] Christ
[1:03:18] but Judas didn't but he got excuse your
[1:03:20] power
[1:03:22] or exosia power
[1:03:25] it's a power of choice though
[1:03:27] physical and mental power something that
[1:03:28] can come on you but it can come off of
[1:03:30] you just like an anointing just like
[1:03:32] these
[1:03:35] excuse me
[1:03:37] these virtues
[1:03:40] yes they're a part of the Holy Ghost but
[1:03:42] but they are not something that
[1:03:45] let me just go ahead and tell you
[1:03:48] they're not required
[1:03:52] for you to be a Christian is to have all
[1:03:55] these virtues
[1:03:58] all right everybody with me
[1:04:00] because you can have the baptism of the
[1:04:02] Holy Ghost in your soul and stay a baby
[1:04:04] whatever you decide
[1:04:06] you grieve him so much or listen
[1:04:08] grieving would be
[1:04:10] more like like brother Bob it'd be like
[1:04:13] going to a church that just says well
[1:04:16] all you got to do is just believe in the
[1:04:17] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:04:19] saved you don't know no better about
[1:04:20] growth you don't know anything about
[1:04:22] growing up you don't know about about
[1:04:24] further my uh you know not not say the
[1:04:27] message of the hour but even in the
[1:04:29] Bible the Bible
[1:04:31] if you stood here and read every
[1:04:33] scripture about growing
[1:04:35] you couldn't get it in a sermon
[1:04:38] the whole Bible is all about growth
[1:04:41] it's all about maturing and God being
[1:04:44] able to use us but what happened and
[1:04:47] we're probably not going to get to it
[1:04:48] now but what happened in the Ages was it
[1:04:52] became formal
[1:04:54] powerless they said this is the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost
[1:04:58] it's a trinitarian Doctrine
[1:05:00] this is the Holy Ghost baptized in the
[1:05:02] name of father son Holy Ghost they
[1:05:04] started splitting it apart and they
[1:05:07] didn't lose its Eternal quality it lost
[1:05:09] his power
[1:05:16] you shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:05:17] Ghost not many days since that's your
[1:05:19] promise
[1:05:22] but now Paul says look but you shall
[1:05:24] receive power after
[1:05:26] Jesus said after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:05:29] upon you so in other words you become as
[1:05:32] Jesus said brother Brown said right here
[1:05:34] in the Book of Revelations right of
[1:05:35] Revelation Jesus Christ watch now
[1:05:37] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:05:38] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:05:41] now see I see the book of Acts and
[1:05:43] brother Ryan's life now I see the book
[1:05:45] of Acts in our life
[1:05:48] we got the doctrines correct the basic
[1:05:51] doctrines we got all that correct listen
[1:05:53] they didn't have the seals
[1:05:57] Paul never said one word about it sure
[1:05:59] he preached about it but he never said
[1:06:01] this is Seal number one seal number two
[1:06:03] the book's been open to me no he didn't
[1:06:05] say that okay but remember
[1:06:08] he wrote the message or the or the Bible
[1:06:11] eighty percent of the old of the New
[1:06:13] Testament
[1:06:15] that we're supposed to keep
[1:06:17] and we don't keep all of it
[1:06:20] I'm talking about denominations
[1:06:23] got a uh just and listen and I'm not
[1:06:26] being comical but we need to pray for
[1:06:28] the Methodist people
[1:06:30] they're good folks
[1:06:32] and in our community there's one sitting
[1:06:34] right there on the hill
[1:06:36] in town that they're going to have their
[1:06:37] vote this coming weekend Sunday they're
[1:06:40] going to vote whether to stay in that
[1:06:42] United Methodist Church and have gays
[1:06:44] and lesbians and all preaching their
[1:06:46] Pulpit are they going to vote to turn it
[1:06:49] out but when they vote just turn it out
[1:06:50] the Methodist Church owns the building
[1:06:54] the people don't own it
[1:06:56] you people own this building
[1:06:58] they don't own that building if they
[1:07:00] don't vote the way the United Methodist
[1:07:03] Church wants them to vote
[1:07:04] they'll be without a church
[1:07:06] and they'll just let them sit empty
[1:07:08] that's how a denomination is they let us
[1:07:10] Church set empty and people die
[1:07:12] without a church
[1:07:14] then to
[1:07:16] admit they're wrong
[1:07:18] so just pray for them I mean they're
[1:07:19] they're good people
[1:07:21] they're not trying to be evil
[1:07:23] they're trying to be good they're trying
[1:07:24] to do what they can do to get you know
[1:07:26] get it and get into the kingdom of God
[1:07:28] uh who's a judge I'm not to judge them
[1:07:32] but the Book of Revelations shows how
[1:07:34] that the Anaconda now remember the
[1:07:36] church and the Christ in the true church
[1:07:37] is a continuation the book of Acts but
[1:07:39] the Book of Revelation shows look how
[1:07:41] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:07:43] into the church
[1:07:46] and defile it make it lukewarm formal
[1:07:49] and Powerless
[1:07:51] they didn't do away with it listen the
[1:07:54] church ages weren't destroyed when
[1:07:55] Luther stood out and and went in a in a
[1:07:58] pub and drank beer and smoked the pipe
[1:08:00] and talks about God
[1:08:01] okay
[1:08:03] no God wainted his ignorance and said
[1:08:06] that's what I need you to do you're the
[1:08:08] man for the hour for that right there
[1:08:11] and he was the only man for that hour or
[1:08:14] he depicts somebody else
[1:08:19] he's not nobody in this world could do
[1:08:21] what brother stand what brother Brown
[1:08:22] stood
[1:08:23] no way no way
[1:08:26] he almost went crazy himself several
[1:08:27] times right
[1:08:29] the Bible said in the last days there'd
[1:08:31] be churches another Tower of Babel that
[1:08:34] have a form of godliness but deny the
[1:08:36] God's word in power the power of His
[1:08:39] word
[1:08:40] because they don't deny the word every
[1:08:42] Methodist this coming Sunday they'll
[1:08:43] even open up the Bible
[1:08:45] and they'll preach out of the Bible
[1:08:49] right
[1:08:50] but they preach it with a denomination
[1:08:53] behind them that's pushing them and
[1:08:54] telling them what to preach that's what
[1:08:56] they're trying to come out from from the
[1:08:58] United Methodist Church
[1:09:00] and what is the word what is the kingdom
[1:09:03] of God
[1:09:04] we got to belong to the kingdom before
[1:09:07] we can ever be subjects of that King
[1:09:12] well how do you get into the kingdom the
[1:09:14] kingdom of God is the word of God made
[1:09:16] back in power
[1:09:19] you and I today we have seen it with our
[1:09:23] own eyes
[1:09:24] the word back in power
[1:09:26] believe it or not you say well we're all
[1:09:28] about half asleep tonight you're about
[1:09:29] to divorce to death the words in power
[1:09:31] somewhere
[1:09:33] all right you're not going to shut it
[1:09:35] down by shutting yourself down
[1:09:37] Acts 2 verse 4 says and they were all
[1:09:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:09:41] speak with other tongues of the spirit
[1:09:42] gave him utterance Acts 19 1
[1:09:45] . Paul says if you received the Holy
[1:09:47] Ghost since you come in this message
[1:09:51] and they said unto him we don't know
[1:09:53] anything about this message we just know
[1:09:54] that Jesus is a Christ
[1:09:57] Paul said look let me tell you something
[1:09:58] let me expound on just a little bit
[1:10:01] no real now look he didn't deny he
[1:10:03] didn't say no John you ain't got to
[1:10:05] listen to what John said right he didn't
[1:10:07] say no don't listen to what John said he
[1:10:09] was false no he said John barely
[1:10:12] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[1:10:15] repent
[1:10:18] and that they should believe on him
[1:10:21] which should come after him that is on
[1:10:23] Christ Jesus and then if I can
[1:10:24] interpolate for Paul Paul says let me
[1:10:27] tell you about him
[1:10:29] cause I got him inside of me
[1:10:33] and when they heard this they were
[1:10:35] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:36] and when Paul laid hands on him the Holy
[1:10:39] Ghost came on them and they spoke with
[1:10:41] tongues and prophesied
[1:10:43] here we are in Ephesians 4 verse 29 said
[1:10:45] let no now look how are you going to
[1:10:47] grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:10:48] corrupt communication
[1:10:53] that's what it says
[1:10:54] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:10:57] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:10:59] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:11:01] Grace
[1:11:03] not condemnation Grace unto the hearers
[1:11:06] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:11:09] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:11:11] redemption now see if you've if you look
[1:11:14] at that you say man I grieve the holy
[1:11:15] spirit that I'm gone no you're sealed
[1:11:19] whereby you're sealed you can grieve him
[1:11:22] out of the way a little bit or out on a
[1:11:24] limb as brother Brown calls it
[1:11:26] but now look he said now how can you
[1:11:28] grieve him he starts back again verse 31
[1:11:30] let all bitterness
[1:11:32] that's a good way to grieve wrath good
[1:11:34] way to grieve anger
[1:11:36] that's pretty much all the statue of
[1:11:38] perfect man
[1:11:39] clamor
[1:11:41] evil speaking be put away from you with
[1:11:45] all malice be it kind one to another
[1:11:48] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:11:51] as God for Christ's sake forgive you
[1:11:55] possession against the enemy brother
[1:11:56] Brown said look
[1:11:57] now be real reverent everybody now just
[1:12:00] be a real reverent keep quiet now he's
[1:12:02] in the middle of a prayer line
[1:12:05] this is an excerpt from the prayer line
[1:12:07] he's in the middle of a prayer line he's
[1:12:08] already prayed for a couple of people
[1:12:10] in the prayer line
[1:12:11] there's no commotion going on there's no
[1:12:14] screaming
[1:12:16] dead quiet
[1:12:20] be real reverent keep quiet see the holy
[1:12:24] spirit is so timid
[1:12:26] how many knows that just real timid Holy
[1:12:29] Spirit see just any little interruption
[1:12:33] bothers him
[1:12:40] any little Interruption you can fill in
[1:12:42] that blank all you want to
[1:12:44] okay
[1:12:47] coming to church late without praying up
[1:12:50] not reading not studying
[1:12:55] letting your kids go to the bathroom
[1:12:56] whenever they want to
[1:13:03] brother Ryan said we believe in
[1:13:04] justification by faith
[1:13:07] we believe that after the person is
[1:13:09] Justified he has peace with the Lord
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ but it's possible that this
[1:13:13] same person could have habits such as
[1:13:15] look watch this such as drinking smoking
[1:13:17] how many times have you heard people say
[1:13:19] I know I'm born again because I don't
[1:13:21] drink smoke and do things that I
[1:13:23] shouldn't do filthy habits of the flesh
[1:13:26] I've heard it with my own ears
[1:13:30] that's just justification
[1:13:32] really that's just heading into
[1:13:34] sanctification
[1:13:35] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:13:40] service of the lord we believe in
[1:13:42] sanctification according to Hebrews 13
[1:13:43] 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might
[1:13:46] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:13:47] suffered without the gate and we believe
[1:13:49] that sanctification is taught in the New
[1:13:51] Testament and meant for the Believers
[1:13:53] through the New Testament age which
[1:13:55] we're now living so we he has not done
[1:13:58] away with sanctification
[1:13:59] we as a church has never done away with
[1:14:02] sanctification the bride will never do
[1:14:04] away with sanctification because you
[1:14:05] know what Paul said I Die daily
[1:14:08] I need a daily washing you need a daily
[1:14:10] washing all right
[1:14:12] we also believe that after the person
[1:14:14] has been Sanctified unclean habits is
[1:14:17] gone from that person
[1:14:19] not born again yet
[1:14:22] he's a believer
[1:14:24] on the Lord Jesus and his habits are
[1:14:26] gone we believe that then
[1:14:31] because God said I'm not dwell in an
[1:14:32] unclean vessel We Believe
[1:14:37] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:39] which comes as a
[1:14:42] film he never says that about
[1:14:43] justification and sanctification
[1:14:45] remember in justification of
[1:14:46] sanctification it's a getting out
[1:14:50] right unclean spirit's gone out you all
[1:14:52] your sins are chopped away in
[1:14:54] justification the unclean Spirit goes
[1:14:56] out but when the Holy Ghost comes it's a
[1:14:59] filling of the believer
[1:15:02] now listen if you're filled you're
[1:15:05] sealed
[1:15:07] you're just as Eternal as God is but you
[1:15:10] can absolutely still grieve that thing
[1:15:12] that you got inside of you and so
[1:15:14] harness it and and and and bind it
[1:15:18] till it has nowhere to work
[1:15:21] it was been bound in the churches that's
[1:15:23] what the problem is
[1:15:24] and maybe it's been bound in message
[1:15:26] churches too because they don't they
[1:15:28] haven't been taught well
[1:15:30] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:15:32] Jesus and the word sanctify means
[1:15:34] cleaned and set aside in the Old
[1:15:36] Testament the altar Sanctified The
[1:15:37] Vessel and it was set aside for service
[1:15:39] we believe that the Holy Spirit watch is
[1:15:42] putting that same vessel
[1:15:44] in service
[1:15:50] now let's talk about anointings for a
[1:15:51] minute everybody okay
[1:15:53] Matthew 7 verse 21 says not everyone
[1:15:55] that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[1:15:58] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:16:00] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[1:16:02] heaven watch many was many
[1:16:06] many will say to me in that day this is
[1:16:10] Jesus speaking Lord Lord have we not
[1:16:12] prophesied
[1:16:15] in thy name
[1:16:17] not quit drinking alcohol
[1:16:19] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:16:22] in thy name cast out devils
[1:16:27] now listen Satan can't cast out Satan
[1:16:30] but God can so anoint a person to where
[1:16:33] that anointing will drive the Holy Ghost
[1:16:34] will drive the unclean Spirit out
[1:16:38] and by with me
[1:16:40] and that's good
[1:16:43] but you still don't have that intimate
[1:16:45] relationship that God wants because he's
[1:16:46] telling you right here and in thy name
[1:16:49] done many wonderful works then I will
[1:16:53] profess unto them now this is Jesus
[1:16:55] Christ
[1:16:56] I will profess unto them I never knew
[1:16:59] you that word knew is just like Adam
[1:17:01] knew his wife Eve it was an intimate
[1:17:03] relationship he is telling the person
[1:17:05] you never went on to the baptism of the
[1:17:07] Holy Ghost you thought you got into
[1:17:09] justification you thought you got it at
[1:17:12] sanctification but you didn't go on to
[1:17:15] get it because that's what a foolish
[1:17:16] virgin is right
[1:17:18] that's why the foolish virgin is but I
[1:17:20] don't want him to say depart from me I
[1:17:22] never knew you I want him to
[1:17:25] him to enter into the joy of
[1:17:30] oil my good and faithful servant
[1:17:35] trying to do God of service
[1:17:37] now notice in this David thought he had
[1:17:39] everything in order
[1:17:41] and it was inspired sometimes that's the
[1:17:43] way we are
[1:17:45] see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man
[1:17:47] now watch the Holy Spirit can anoint a
[1:17:48] man
[1:17:49] the outside Spirit can be Anointed with
[1:17:51] the Holy Ghost and the soul is the
[1:17:53] darkest pitch
[1:17:56] so darkest pitch false teachers can rise
[1:17:59] teaching all kind of trinitarianisms and
[1:18:01] everything else or whatever you want to
[1:18:02] call it in the message and be Anointed
[1:18:05] with the Holy Ghost and perform just as
[1:18:07] many miracles as the true gospel can but
[1:18:10] by the word that's what does it
[1:18:13] do we see what he means
[1:18:15] he said see what I mean do we really see
[1:18:18] or do we seek Miracles and we seek that
[1:18:21] preacher that can preach louder and
[1:18:23] speak in tongues and run the aisles and
[1:18:27] or do we listen to what he says
[1:18:30] faith comes by shout and speak no faith
[1:18:32] comes by what
[1:18:34] hearing
[1:18:36] I'm not against all that when it's in
[1:18:38] order and it is it will be an order but
[1:18:42] but I'm like brother Dale said you bring
[1:18:44] you can bring 10 caskets up here and you
[1:18:46] can that man could raise all ten from
[1:18:48] the dead and they everyone get whole and
[1:18:51] walk out that door but if he preaches a
[1:18:53] false Doctrine I ain't listening to him
[1:18:57] that's hard to believe he said what
[1:19:00] no
[1:19:01] if you've been taught well and you got
[1:19:03] the holy ghost in your soul
[1:19:05] that won't trap you
[1:19:11] break them now look
[1:19:13] the anointed ones only the word will
[1:19:14] separate them not the signs oh no
[1:19:17] they'll do the same signs but the words
[1:19:20] what separates them
[1:19:22] they all prophesied they all done this
[1:19:25] done that and the other just the same
[1:19:26] Jesus said they'd do the same thing but
[1:19:28] the word is what separates them notice
[1:19:30] not the signs
[1:19:34] because signs what signs follow look at
[1:19:37] me follow
[1:19:40] here's the believer
[1:19:42] signs follow
[1:19:44] the believer not go in front
[1:19:52] I Don't Preach to see signs
[1:19:59] I preach and signs follow
[1:20:04] because who works a gift you do
[1:20:07] all right and then let's look just for a
[1:20:09] second we'll close right here
[1:20:11] the gifts of the Spirit are these
[1:20:13] virtues or battles as brother
[1:20:16] um Keith called them storms of maturity
[1:20:18] I want to look at this just for a minute
[1:20:20] and we'll close right here musicians get
[1:20:22] ready to come we'll stop on that little
[1:20:24] word metamorphosis
[1:20:25] that word metamorphosis means in an
[1:20:28] insect or an amphibian the process of
[1:20:31] transformation look from an immature
[1:20:35] form
[1:20:41] that butterfly is still inside there
[1:20:44] but it looks like a caterpillar
[1:20:47] I want you to watch some of these other
[1:20:49] things I want you to read this
[1:20:51] it's the process of transformation from
[1:20:54] an immature form
[1:21:00] to an adult
[1:21:03] exactly
[1:21:04] and now remember too
[1:21:06] that adult form may not always be the
[1:21:10] same as what you started
[1:21:17] to form in an adult form in two or more
[1:21:20] distinct stages
[1:21:22] let's say seven
[1:21:25] a change of the form or nature watch
[1:21:29] of a thing or person into a completely
[1:21:32] different one by natural or Supernatural
[1:21:36] means
[1:21:39] because remember that caterpillar
[1:21:42] when it when it comes out and it goes
[1:21:44] through the larva and it goes into the
[1:21:46] caterpillar that caterpillar eats and
[1:21:49] eats and eat and eat and eats leaves
[1:21:54] whatever the diet of it is it just
[1:21:56] Gorges itself with leaves but now
[1:21:59] remember when he becomes a butterfly a
[1:22:02] butterfly don't eat leaves
[1:22:05] but what the caterpillar ate
[1:22:08] is inside the butterfly
[1:22:12] well I thought I got a more should have
[1:22:14] got more amens than that but
[1:22:16] it's what you eat
[1:22:18] it's what the caterpillar eats and makes
[1:22:20] him a butterfly it's what you eat that
[1:22:21] makes you a mature Christian
[1:22:23] the Journey Begins With The Call to
[1:22:25] Adventure away from the Ordinary World
[1:22:27] one is familiar with and comfortable in
[1:22:30] okay I stole this from somebody
[1:22:34] watch but it's it's it's it's it's
[1:22:36] totally true initially one may deny this
[1:22:40] call because of its daunting pull toward
[1:22:43] the potential dangers unknown
[1:22:49] listen to be
[1:22:52] the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end
[1:22:54] time is something no person listen to me
[1:22:57] just for a minute no person has ever had
[1:23:01] the opportunity to be that
[1:23:05] no one
[1:23:08] so it is a daunting point and it's
[1:23:11] unchartered water that's why I took a
[1:23:13] profit
[1:23:14] and why it took a Seer to go up high and
[1:23:16] say hey this is not bad
[1:23:20] you gotta do it this way but this is not
[1:23:23] bad remember he talks about the guy
[1:23:24] climbing up and looking over the
[1:23:27] um he said that's what a prophet was
[1:23:28] right
[1:23:29] instead of looking through the peephole
[1:23:30] and seeing just a few things the prophet
[1:23:32] gets over and he gets up on somebody's
[1:23:34] shoulders or gets upon a box and he
[1:23:36] looks and he sees the whole arcade well
[1:23:39] that's what brother Brown did he saw the
[1:23:40] whole arcade but he didn't keep it he
[1:23:42] didn't jump over in the arcade and just
[1:23:44] start playing now he come back
[1:23:47] and told us
[1:23:49] the truth
[1:23:51] I don't care you can put whatever in
[1:23:53] between all that he told us the truth
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:57] initially one may deny this call because
[1:24:00] of his daunting pull toward a potential
[1:24:02] dangers unknown you got to remember and
[1:24:04] I know you can't be a caterpillar but
[1:24:06] inside that caterpillar is everything
[1:24:09] of the butterfly
[1:24:12] no external nothing external it's
[1:24:16] but all of us
[1:24:21] changing there's a metamorphosis even in
[1:24:24] the cells the cells go to a different
[1:24:26] spot I hope y'all getting this
[1:24:29] it's what they eat makes the cells go to
[1:24:31] because listen caterpillars don't have
[1:24:33] wings
[1:24:35] not one caterpillar I know has wings
[1:24:38] but all the caterpillars that become
[1:24:40] butterflies have wings inside of them
[1:24:43] okay
[1:24:47] if answered look
[1:24:49] if
[1:24:51] praise the Lord
[1:24:52] if answered and acted upon
[1:24:56] this is not acting upon
[1:25:04] have you ever watched a caterpillar move
[1:25:06] kind of like some of us
[1:25:08] it might not get this far but it it has
[1:25:11] a purpose because when it gets this far
[1:25:13] in the day there's a leaf or bark right
[1:25:16] at the end of that and here's what he's
[1:25:17] going to eat
[1:25:18] all right
[1:25:20] struggle come to church do do the thing
[1:25:22] read the Bible pray
[1:25:25] if answered and acted upon one enters in
[1:25:29] a special word
[1:25:31] where one undergoes a series of tests
[1:25:34] and challenges the road of Trials or the
[1:25:37] statue of perfect man encounters enemies
[1:25:42] that caterpillar's got to watch because
[1:25:44] you know what they some things like to
[1:25:45] eat caterpillars them things are fat
[1:25:47] they're fat juicy big old things some of
[1:25:50] them are this big around
[1:25:52] but there's a butterfly inside of there
[1:25:55] and count as enemies and also mentors
[1:25:57] and allies
[1:26:00] you ever seen
[1:26:03] you put your hand on a tree or something
[1:26:05] you look
[1:26:07] and you didn't know it was there to
[1:26:08] begin with and you look right beside
[1:26:09] your hand
[1:26:11] and there's a caterpillar or something
[1:26:12] that has camouflaged itself
[1:26:15] it's hiding from the enemy
[1:26:18] okay
[1:26:21] that will mentors and allies that guide
[1:26:23] and assist through the difficulties
[1:26:26] Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:26:28] evangelists deacons Elders sisters with
[1:26:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Sunday
[1:26:33] school teachers let me just you got all
[1:26:36] of it listen we're not on an island
[1:26:40] through the fires of tribulation and
[1:26:42] Chaos a part of the initiate dies and is
[1:26:45] reborn in other words
[1:26:47] if you look at a what is that one you
[1:26:49] call it is indicator did one that that
[1:26:51] sticks on the side of the tree and all
[1:26:54] you see is the shell there's a split
[1:26:56] down the back
[1:26:58] what
[1:26:59] cicada
[1:27:01] you ever seen those
[1:27:03] that thing once was alive that shell
[1:27:05] once did something that it did not do it
[1:27:07] now
[1:27:12] but it was told what to do from the
[1:27:14] inside out and it split open and the new
[1:27:17] person came out or the new bug came out
[1:27:19] to the fires of tribulation and Chaos a
[1:27:22] part of the initiate dies and is Reborn
[1:27:26] resurrected with an Elixir that is taken
[1:27:29] back to be shared with the Ordinary
[1:27:32] World
[1:27:34] everybody listen how many of y'all like
[1:27:37] to just
[1:27:40] stand and look at a caterpillar
[1:27:43] they're fat green and ugly
[1:27:46] but oh you'll plant butterfly bushes all
[1:27:49] over your yard
[1:27:52] what because you want to see the
[1:27:54] butterfly we don't want to see
[1:27:57] the worm
[1:27:59] right
[1:28:01] that's the Elixir that is taken back and
[1:28:03] shared with the Ordinary World you
[1:28:06] become a butterfly and everybody loves
[1:28:08] to watch butterflies
[1:28:09] implied within the call is a recognition
[1:28:12] that
[1:28:13] that is needed of us
[1:28:16] butterflies needed caterpillars needed
[1:28:18] to but the butterfly has got to what the
[1:28:21] caterpillar never lays an egg
[1:28:23] the caterpillar comes from an egg
[1:28:27] that the butterfly Lays
[1:28:30] somewhere
[1:28:32] up under a piece of bark or something it
[1:28:34] makes it through the winter and then
[1:28:35] when it gets hot enough pops open and
[1:28:39] here comes an old ugly caterpillar
[1:28:42] well guess what there's a butterfly in
[1:28:43] there
[1:28:44] from the beginning there's a butterfly
[1:28:46] now watch
[1:28:49] Through The Crucible of adversity we
[1:28:53] transform and return to the Ordinary
[1:28:55] World with grayer wisdom
[1:29:00] our self-knowledge humility gifts
[1:29:03] empathy love and other qualities
[1:29:06] we discover there's more to give and
[1:29:10] have the capacity now
[1:29:14] to pollinate
[1:29:17] a butterfly is a pollinator a bee is not
[1:29:19] a B's a pollinator two but a butterfly
[1:29:21] is a great pollinator but that
[1:29:23] caterpillar never pollinates anything
[1:29:28] it's useless
[1:29:30] to a degree
[1:29:33] we discover there's more to give and
[1:29:35] have the capacity now to bestow those
[1:29:38] inner qualities
[1:29:40] unto others this edification of self
[1:29:43] deepens us into a more Mythic way of
[1:29:47] being in the world a higher plane of
[1:29:48] existing than where we started from
[1:29:52] from which we can give more
[1:29:55] of ourself
[1:29:59] an old an old bug an old
[1:30:02] um
[1:30:03] creepy crawly it just I mean it's just
[1:30:06] you know
[1:30:08] but how many how many of you just said
[1:30:10] we got a um
[1:30:13] hummingbird feeders
[1:30:15] they they're mesmerizing
[1:30:18] you can't duplicate that color and you
[1:30:20] definitely listen the government would
[1:30:22] love to get the speed of that of that of
[1:30:24] that hummingbird well they do this do
[1:30:26] this do this do this do this do this do
[1:30:28] this and you can't even see their wings
[1:30:29] they're so fast right that's mesmerizing
[1:30:32] but now that or a bug on a wall
[1:30:36] or a caterpillar
[1:30:38] no
[1:30:40] what are you saying brother Wade yeah we
[1:30:42] all started out as a caterpillar we all
[1:30:43] started out ugly
[1:30:45] pretty much useless but down inside
[1:30:47] there was something
[1:30:49] it just needed to get in the right
[1:30:50] environment started eating the right
[1:30:52] kind of food
[1:30:53] and then what was it what is it for the
[1:30:55] butterfly to do it's not for just to go
[1:30:57] hide somewhere it's to give it to the
[1:30:58] whole world
[1:31:00] somebody I think Josh and Leah didn't
[1:31:03] y'all do the butterfly thingy when y'all
[1:31:06] did the marriage thingy all them
[1:31:07] thingies huh
[1:31:11] your engagement yeah it was in a
[1:31:13] butterfly um
[1:31:14] Sanctuary Zoo
[1:31:21] it's not been a zoo ever since
[1:31:23] I'm trying to make that clear Leah's a
[1:31:25] good girl I love her to death
[1:31:29] praying for them all
[1:31:31] but what mesmerizes people
[1:31:35] is when the real you comes out
[1:31:38] number one you're a Mystic to the world
[1:31:40] they can't understand you how can they
[1:31:42] understand you know when you're when
[1:31:43] you're walking through the world and and
[1:31:45] and something happens and and you know
[1:31:48] most people that I know you'd be doing
[1:31:50] this because you knew what was coming
[1:31:53] a lot of four letters
[1:31:56] but when you just say Lord
[1:31:59] or something happens you say Lord
[1:32:00] forgive me
[1:32:03] can we not get the brotherly kindness to
[1:32:04] where we can do that to everybody
[1:32:06] instead of just being so hateful and
[1:32:09] have hatred
[1:32:10] well they don't believe like I believe
[1:32:15] well I'm gonna hit them all everybody
[1:32:16] Armageddon
[1:32:20] it's all of us folks we got pencil
[1:32:22] sharpening time it's time for us to
[1:32:23] wiggle and get that thing butterfly out
[1:32:25] so that we can so that we can share it
[1:32:27] with the world
[1:32:32] come on musicians and we'll we'll stop
[1:32:34] right here
[1:32:36] the Lord says behold I come as a thief
[1:32:39] blessed is he that watches and keepeth
[1:32:40] His Garment unless he walks naked and
[1:32:43] they see a shame
[1:32:45] and he gathered him to a place called
[1:32:46] Armageddon or the hill
[1:32:49] of the city
[1:32:51] I know there's a valley but Armageddon
[1:32:53] means the hill you got to have a two
[1:32:55] Hills to make a valley the scene of the
[1:32:57] struggle of Good and Evil let's stand to
[1:32:58] our feet
[1:32:59] and suggested by that battle plane of
[1:33:02] estradeline which was famous for two
[1:33:04] great victories of Barack and Gideon and
[1:33:06] two great disasters the death of Saul
[1:33:08] and Josiah hence in Revelation a place
[1:33:11] of great Slaughter the scene of a
[1:33:12] terrible retribution upon the wicked
[1:33:15] uh this version translates to name as
[1:33:18] Armageddon the hill or R is the city of
[1:33:22] mcgetto you and I as brother Ram talks
[1:33:25] right here the Battle Stars in heaven
[1:33:28] but it's ending right here
[1:33:31] in the physical form and the spiritual
[1:33:33] form you and I are in a battle
[1:33:36] that poor old caterpillar
[1:33:39] that butterfly I'm sure
[1:33:43] I had to do this you know many like
[1:33:46] chickens and all different things they
[1:33:47] have to eat their way out that you know
[1:33:49] they always even in bees if if a bee if
[1:33:52] you try to help a bee come out of it
[1:33:53] come out of it so a little cell
[1:33:56] You Hinder it
[1:34:00] you you get your at you get your little
[1:34:02] chicken out of a shell because you want
[1:34:03] to try to help it because it looks like
[1:34:05] it's struggling leave it alone
[1:34:08] it builds character
[1:34:11] it builds strength
[1:34:14] by doing it the natural way
[1:34:16] the bee has to eat that piece around
[1:34:18] there and has to push a little bit and
[1:34:20] I've watched them and you see one little
[1:34:22] tentacle sticking up and it's going
[1:34:26] then all of a sudden you know it comes
[1:34:28] back down and you see it moving because
[1:34:29] it's chewing it it's chewing a little
[1:34:30] bit more and then you see two tentacles
[1:34:33] sticking up they're going
[1:34:35] you know checking the place out
[1:34:37] but then all of a sudden he eats the
[1:34:39] rest of it and he opens it up and he
[1:34:41] comes out
[1:34:42] he came from a larva stage a little
[1:34:44] bitty egg it looked like a piece of rice
[1:34:46] to a bee
[1:34:48] let the transforming power of God make
[1:34:50] us into what we're supposed to be there
[1:34:52] is an end to this to this we talk about
[1:34:55] Humanity now we're not going to ever see
[1:34:58] wait a minute maybe we are
[1:35:01] you were transformed from what you were
[1:35:02] right
[1:35:04] some of you a picture like even June
[1:35:06] like when we got married you know or or
[1:35:08] right after we got married her hair was
[1:35:10] this short
[1:35:11] Shadow maker
[1:35:13] she's been transformed from that
[1:35:15] you'll not see that anymore
[1:35:19] so we are being transformed as the Bible
[1:35:22] says by the renewing of our mind even
[1:35:24] literally transformed where the world
[1:35:25] goes
[1:35:29] why don't you cut your hair
[1:35:32] you wear a dress everywhere you go
[1:35:35] when you gotta makeup on
[1:35:38] you know why makes you different
[1:35:40] but you know what it makes you though it
[1:35:42] doesn't make you odd to be so different
[1:35:43] to where you just clam up no you say hey
[1:35:47] the Bible tells us
[1:35:50] the Bible tells us to not do these
[1:35:54] things the Bible tells us don't say
[1:35:55] brother Branham said
[1:35:57] the Bible tells us
[1:36:00] that's why I don't understand these
[1:36:01] people
[1:36:02] that are leaving the message
[1:36:06] they're saying brother Brandon wasn't
[1:36:07] even in the Bible Lord of Mercy what did
[1:36:09] he preach out of
[1:36:12] I can read everything he said every
[1:36:15] sermon he preached you can read it write
[1:36:17] out of the Bible
[1:36:21] I don't understand
[1:36:22] but you know what I just pray they all
[1:36:24] get the Holy Ghost
[1:36:26] I wish that one guy on the internet and
[1:36:28] I can't remember his name but I wished
[1:36:29] he would put as much effort into
[1:36:31] learning what this message is about as
[1:36:33] he does trying to tear it apart he'd be
[1:36:35] a whole lot better person
[1:36:37] quit wasting his time and mine because
[1:36:43] but see they can't leave it alone the
[1:36:45] devil can't leave this message alone
[1:36:48] he can't just say well that's your
[1:36:49] opinion we'll just keep on nope nope
[1:36:51] we're going to take and your leader
[1:36:53] we're going to
[1:36:55] break him down isn't that what they did
[1:36:57] with Jesus
[1:36:58] you
[1:37:01] you a man calling yourself God now we
[1:37:04] know brother Brown wasn't God but Jesus
[1:37:06] was
[1:37:07] okay
[1:37:09] you
[1:37:10] say destroy this Temple and it took us
[1:37:14] 46 years to build this thing
[1:37:17] you say destroy this Temple and I'll
[1:37:20] raise it up in three days
[1:37:23] you say you forgive sins
[1:37:27] and now what they're saying now same
[1:37:29] identical thing same devil listen them
[1:37:32] Devils don't die but they're fixing to
[1:37:35] they're fiction too there is an end to a
[1:37:38] demon but there's not an end to you if
[1:37:40] you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:42] let's sing a song God bless you

[1:40:46] Hi man you love the Lord
[1:40:48] amen he's good to us amen he's given us
[1:40:51] something that's it is special it does
[1:40:53] make you special
[1:40:55] makes you different but it makes you
[1:40:57] different it's not you just make
[1:40:58] yourself different it makes you
[1:40:59] different
[1:41:01] I mean you you just take just for a
[1:41:05] minute you just think back
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:07] we used to go to a Baptist Church or or
[1:41:09] whatever Church you might have went to
[1:41:11] or a denominational Church they had a
[1:41:13] they had a what they call the doxology
[1:41:15] and they had three this and they had two
[1:41:17] of that and you know I told somebody the
[1:41:20] other day they were asking me about a
[1:41:22] sermon and he says how long does it take
[1:41:23] you to get a sermon somebody at work I
[1:41:25] think it was
[1:41:26] I said well oh I know why there's um
[1:41:30] there's a church to where me and Jim was
[1:41:31] married at they've changed the name of
[1:41:33] the church well the little preacher he
[1:41:35] puts his subject up on this on the
[1:41:37] outside billboard and gives you the
[1:41:39] scripture so you can you know kind of
[1:41:41] read the scripture if you want to
[1:41:43] and and you know I mean he probably gets
[1:41:46] it from the denomination but but anyway
[1:41:49] still so it's scripted I hope I don't
[1:41:52] want to say that but it is kind of they
[1:41:54] tell you what to do tell you what to
[1:41:55] preach and one of the girls asked me she
[1:41:57] said well well how long does it take you
[1:41:58] to get a sermon I said well it used to
[1:42:00] take me a while now it doesn't take me
[1:42:01] very long
[1:42:02] I said it doesn't take me long for about
[1:42:05] an hour hour and a half sermon and
[1:42:06] they're like
[1:42:09] you ain't kidding you preach that long
[1:42:14] I said we get everybody in this building
[1:42:17] Aaron included get an hour every time
[1:42:22] right
[1:42:23] they don't 30 minutes buddy and they're
[1:42:25] out of here
[1:42:27] but you see the difference and then you
[1:42:29] walk into a church
[1:42:30] and and I'm telling you this is why
[1:42:32] they're called former powerless that's
[1:42:34] why they've been taught what they've
[1:42:35] been taught from a Pulpit that they can
[1:42:37] just come in the church and they can
[1:42:39] talk and it's just like it is just like
[1:42:40] a lodge
[1:42:43] go visit one sometime not on Sunday
[1:42:46] but go visit them one time and and
