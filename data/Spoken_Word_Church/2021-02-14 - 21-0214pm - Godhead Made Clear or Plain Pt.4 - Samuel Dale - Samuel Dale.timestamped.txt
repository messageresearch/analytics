[17:58] him
[17:58] amen good to see everybody in the house
[18:00] of the lord if you'd like to turn in
[18:01] your bibles turn to
[18:03] hebrews 10
[18:07] in ephesians 5 where was reading this
[18:10] morning
[18:10] try to get this thought in and then
[18:13] maybe
[18:14] change little channels or something of
[18:16] it but
[18:18] just pray that the lord would bless
[18:20] remember wade will be ministering lord
[18:21] willing wednesday
[18:23] and then remember this that sunday we
[18:26] will be taking communion
[18:28] so everything we order for all of that
[18:30] we'll
[18:31] be having a good time of doing those
[18:33] things remember all of these that are
[18:35] away today visiting and
[18:37] whatever they're doing ministering
[18:39] things is more missing today than they
[18:40] are here so
[18:42] we just uh you know wonder where they're
[18:45] at
[18:46] that's what they're doing but that's you
[18:48] know
[18:49] that's the way god does things he puts
[18:51] us all to the place we need to be it
[18:53] doesn't matter
[18:54] if we don't want to get there he he'll
[18:56] hurt us around some way
[18:58] and make it work out i mean all right
[19:00] let's just uh
[19:02] pray and then go into the scriptures
[19:03] hebrews 10 and ephesians 5.
[19:07] the heavenly father we thank you lord
[19:09] jesus for the
[19:10] grace and love and all the things that
[19:13] you've given unto us
[19:15] thank you for an opportunity to be able
[19:17] to
[19:19] read your word as we try to express this
[19:22] morning and just read a natural story
[19:24] read of natural things that are taking
[19:27] place
[19:28] but to see that we're part of it and see
[19:31] that we're part of you
[19:33] lord we ask you to just have your way
[19:35] with each one
[19:36] come on the scene now this afternoon and
[19:38] open our eyes to thy word
[19:40] that we may walk in the light of your
[19:42] graves remember the ones that are not
[19:43] here some six different things remember
[19:45] brother curran there lord
[19:47] her sister said he was sick remember him
[19:49] and just be there be with brother i o
[19:51] lord
[19:52] he so wanted to be here today because he
[19:54] was
[19:55] he i talked to him yesterday lord and he
[19:57] said he'd like to come
[19:59] so then that's a desire that's in the
[20:00] heart and we pray that you'd bless
[20:03] have your way with each and every one of
[20:05] us forgive our sins
[20:06] cleanse us from all unrighteousness lead
[20:09] us in your love in jesus name
[20:12] amen ephesians
[20:15] i mean hebrews 10 and then ephesians
[20:18] okay hebrews 10
[20:23] for the law having a shadow of good
[20:25] things to come
[20:27] and not the very image of the thing can
[20:29] never
[20:30] with those sacrifices which they offered
[20:33] year by year
[20:34] continually make their commerce their
[20:36] unto perfect
[20:37] now that's like i said i'd like to read
[20:40] the word
[20:42] but understand what it's saying
[20:46] the it sounds like if you read that
[20:49] scripture
[20:50] and this is what i was trying to get
[20:52] across to you this morning
[20:54] it sounds like they're saying something
[20:58] in other words it can't happen but watch
[21:01] it doesn't make the comer there unto
[21:03] perfect
[21:04] it has to be offered over and over but
[21:06] each time it's offered
[21:10] are you listening each time it's offered
[21:14] it makes you perfect for the time you
[21:16] know that year
[21:17] or whatever it is they have one offer
[21:19] and they have to take it up and do it
[21:21] it works for the whole year so if you
[21:23] read it then see
[21:24] just read the way you're going because
[21:26] it said with those sacrifices they
[21:28] offered
[21:29] year by year continually make they're
[21:31] coming down to perfect it sounds like
[21:33] that they're just worth nothing no
[21:34] they're not worth it they're worth
[21:36] all of the total thing because it covers
[21:39] you for that year
[21:42] or then would they not have ceased to be
[21:44] offered
[21:45] because that the worshiper once purged
[21:48] should have no more conscience of sin
[21:51] but in those sacrifices there is a
[21:54] remembrance
[21:56] again made of sins year after year you
[21:59] you've got to go in and offer them
[22:02] where it's not possible that the blood
[22:03] of bulls and of goats
[22:06] shouldn't make take could take away sin
[22:08] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[22:10] he said
[22:12] sacrifice an offering thou would has not
[22:15] but a body has thou prepared me
[22:18] all right sacrifice and offerings can't
[22:21] do it
[22:23] but it can cover for a time
[22:26] but it can't take it away
[22:29] but i want it to be taken away don't you
[22:31] okay now let's go to ephesians
[22:34] 5 21
[22:38] submitting yourselves one to another in
[22:40] the fear of god wives submit yourselves
[22:42] unto your own husband as
[22:43] unto the lord for the husband is the
[22:46] head of the wife even as
[22:48] christ is the head of the church and he
[22:50] is the savior of the body therefore as
[22:54] the church
[22:54] is subject unto christ so let the wives
[22:58] be
[22:59] to their own husbands in everything
[23:01] husbands love your wives
[23:03] even this cross also loved the church
[23:05] and gave himself for it
[23:07] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[23:09] with the washing of the water by the
[23:10] word
[23:12] that he might present it to himself
[23:15] a glorious church having not having
[23:19] spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[23:22] but that it should be holy and without
[23:25] blemish
[23:26] so ultimate all men to love their wives
[23:29] as their own bodies
[23:30] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[23:33] for no man can
[23:34] no man ever yet hateth his own flesh
[23:38] but nourishes and cherishes it even as
[23:40] the lord of church
[23:43] for we are members of his body right now
[23:47] of his flesh and of his bones for this
[23:50] cause shall a man leave his father and
[23:51] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[23:54] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[23:57] a great
[23:58] mystery but i speak concerning christ in
[24:01] the church
[24:03] nevertheless let every one of you in
[24:05] particular so love his wife
[24:07] even as himself and the wife let's see
[24:09] that she reverence her husband in other
[24:11] words what are you saying
[24:13] christ in the church
[24:17] body in christ
[24:20] explaining it paul's putting it down in
[24:22] plain language as i said
[24:23] you read the natural part
[24:27] but he's talking about christ in the
[24:29] church
[24:30] there's a mystery
[24:34] in the bible that you start reading in
[24:38] genesis and you get the natural story
[24:42] was you following this morning but yet
[24:45] see then once you
[24:46] get involved in it you'll start getting
[24:48] the fact that there's a mystery
[24:51] being revealed
[24:54] that's what we want to know about isn't
[24:56] it you can be seated lord add his
[24:57] blessing to the reading of his word
[25:00] and christ is that mystery
[25:03] all right
[25:07] so i i hope it seemed to be
[25:10] that i couldn't get my point over this
[25:12] morning but maybe i should have read my
[25:14] things but i had 30-something quotes and
[25:17] i gave you them
[25:18] and uh you know we put them on the
[25:21] internet a lot of times
[25:22] i didn't want to i had 36 i think this
[25:25] morning
[25:26] we didn't quote you know didn't take
[25:28] nothing read it too much
[25:29] read a couple little things but it goes
[25:31] on the internet
[25:33] all right people listening they can look
[25:37] and see that all right they can pull
[25:39] that quote up
[25:41] and and and you know and hear it they
[25:43] can they can be doing that so that's why
[25:45] we go ahead and
[25:46] put it on there even though we don't
[25:49] read it here
[25:51] it'll be doing it because you know that
[25:52] way we can get the quotes on to them
[25:55] okay
[25:55] all right now
[25:58] let's just get started on a thought that
[26:00] we were on this morning that
[26:04] we are the body of christ
[26:07] he has always had
[26:11] some form or what thoughts or whatever
[26:13] you'd want to say
[26:15] a body all right even back before
[26:18] time even back before anything he had a
[26:22] supernatural body
[26:25] all right the best i could do with it is
[26:28] call it maybe a theophany
[26:31] but that is a body and if you die
[26:35] you realize your body goes this way
[26:39] naturally but your
[26:44] body of what you are in the body of
[26:47] christ you're a child you're a christian
[26:49] or
[26:49] you know a christian that goes somewhere
[26:52] to dwell and wait
[26:53] until it's all finished so then you've
[26:55] got a body we've got a body that's my
[26:57] point
[26:57] my whole point was that god has never
[27:00] been left without a body
[27:01] but it goes in stages see he came forth
[27:05] into the world
[27:07] under one stage to bring it from a
[27:09] glorified supernatural whatever you want
[27:12] to call it body
[27:13] theophany and then he came into flesh
[27:17] all right to a natural 16 element body
[27:21] all right then one day that was offered
[27:23] as a sacrifice
[27:24] and when it was then he went beyond
[27:28] and took the body and all up and left it
[27:30] and came back himself to dwell in the
[27:34] church
[27:35] so he never left himself without a body
[27:38] he's always had a body because that's
[27:40] the point he wanted a body
[27:42] so why would he just go so far and then
[27:44] stop
[27:46] no huh it's going to come forth the body
[27:49] of christ is going to come forth
[27:51] and we are that body
[27:54] and without him the prophet said you're
[27:56] not complete
[27:58] i mean he's not complete without you
[28:00] let's put it that way so we are
[28:02] on our own but uh he's not complete
[28:08] all right then it has to go in stages to
[28:10] understand
[28:12] see you and i have the baptism of the
[28:14] holy ghost we have eternal life in our
[28:16] soul
[28:18] we are in the statute of a perfect man
[28:21] somewhere
[28:22] in the uh dwelling of that and
[28:25] those quotes this morning we had in
[28:27] there that that would be the body of
[28:28] christ would be a body
[28:30] that he would provide which would be the
[28:32] stature of a perfect man
[28:34] that's the body that god wants to live
[28:35] in is your nature your ways your doing
[28:38] that he has given to you to add to what
[28:42] you have
[28:43] and it made forth to where you would be
[28:45] a child of god for
[28:47] adoptions uh things like that so it
[28:50] all comes in stages okay
[28:54] but i think what we need to do is
[28:56] consider the fact that i believe
[28:58] we're in the end time i believe we're in
[29:00] the finishing up of all things
[29:02] i i'm not a doomsday or or something
[29:04] like that kind of a guy
[29:06] i never have beat on you about this or
[29:09] that or the other or
[29:10] or went through dates and times and
[29:12] seasons or anything trying to scare
[29:14] you because it won't do no good
[29:17] it won't scare nobody into doing nothing
[29:20] you can't scare
[29:21] a child into being saved so don't do
[29:24] that
[29:25] don't scare your children or try to
[29:28] uh make them think about god in the
[29:31] wrong way
[29:33] talk to them about the love of god
[29:36] sure he wants took you to live right he
[29:39] wants you to be corrected
[29:40] you can explain the things uh you know
[29:43] as i've always said i never whipped with
[29:45] children
[29:46] until i explained why well you know what
[29:49] they wound up saying
[29:51] hey daddy just give me the whooping let
[29:52] me get out of here
[29:54] they didn't care much about the
[29:56] explaining
[29:58] they didn't worry about the the beating
[30:00] because they knew i wasn't going to kill
[30:01] them
[30:02] you know so they you know they but
[30:05] they'd say well just give me the whip
[30:07] and let me get out of here
[30:08] well that's that's all right now
[30:12] but see he's always had a
[30:15] bodily form but yet it moved from one
[30:19] thing to another
[30:21] one place one conditions existence and
[30:24] what
[30:25] to another until it wound up in two
[30:28] on the day of pentecost into the bride
[30:31] of jesus christ
[30:32] all right now for for 2 000
[30:35] the prophet said every age
[30:38] every time has had its own portion of
[30:42] the word
[30:44] the things to be brought forth and that
[30:46] mainly is what we want to think about
[30:48] because
[30:49] what i was driving at this morning maybe
[30:52] not enough for you to understand the way
[30:53] i talk but
[30:54] see that body is being built by the word
[30:58] you become the word as you receive the
[31:00] word all right
[31:02] see your glorified body is being built
[31:04] the prophet said around your born-again
[31:05] experience
[31:07] well why don't you want a glorified body
[31:11] let's get born again and let it get
[31:12] started
[31:14] just go down the road that way go the
[31:16] way he says for us to go
[31:18] and it'll all work out we try to figure
[31:20] it out and we'll get it messed up every
[31:22] time you know
[31:23] so we just do what the prophet said and
[31:26] that's what i love about it to where you
[31:27] can read the prophet's message
[31:29] and it's so wonderful until there is a
[31:33] even as i'm trying to explain this
[31:34] morning that he can explain a situation
[31:38] of natural and you can sit there and let
[31:41] god
[31:42] deal in your mean your your
[31:45] mental faculties and things and come out
[31:48] with
[31:48] with the point of looking at god and
[31:51] seeing something that he's making known
[31:53] to you
[31:54] all right and then see that brings us to
[31:56] that position
[31:58] all right now he getting my get my
[32:01] statement
[32:03] he's never been without a body okay we
[32:06] saw that
[32:08] so we got that he had back there before
[32:10] the world
[32:11] we could call it theophany and call it
[32:13] glorified you can call it
[32:15] but he had a body he wasn't just a wind
[32:17] floating around just
[32:18] air and just puffing it see no
[32:24] see that's our denominational ideas
[32:28] okay see god is real
[32:31] he was real back there all right so then
[32:34] he kept coming down
[32:36] until he could come to the body of
[32:39] christ
[32:41] you know the lord jesus himself in human
[32:43] flesh upon this earth
[32:45] god in human flesh that body was the
[32:48] body of god
[32:50] not that it made him a second person or
[32:53] a third person or some kind of something
[32:55] it didn't make him that it
[32:57] all it done was brought into
[32:59] manifestation
[33:01] those things that he was so he always
[33:04] was
[33:05] let me put it and i won't use the word
[33:07] human but let me put it this way
[33:09] he was a being the prophet said he said
[33:12] he's not like the wind
[33:14] so god is a being so if we could ever
[33:17] start comprehending about how real he
[33:20] is then he's just not the figurative of
[33:24] your imagination or some thought or some
[33:26] idea
[33:28] you know i've heard people try to
[33:30] explain the godhead and they'd say
[33:32] you know well god is this or god is that
[33:34] no no no
[33:36] you start leaving out and put nowhere
[33:38] extra in you're going to wind up in
[33:40] trouble
[33:40] so just be normal like it is let it go
[33:44] and just just serve god okay now watch
[33:49] god then came into human flesh and he's
[33:52] been in the human flesh for
[33:54] now for the 2000 years all right so
[33:58] he is not complete without you
[34:03] he said no no he can do what he wants to
[34:05] no he's not complete without you
[34:08] he's done it that way he designed it
[34:11] that way he made it that way
[34:13] to where that you and i would be
[34:15] involved
[34:17] in the form of salvation and
[34:20] you know existing on earth and what to
[34:22] do the
[34:23] all right then when he stepped over into
[34:26] the bride
[34:28] on the day of pentecost he's headed
[34:32] toward
[34:34] what he started out as being he started
[34:36] out as being a supernatural being
[34:40] now he's come to live in you and i to
[34:43] redeem
[34:44] these bodies that we live in all right
[34:48] redeeming the body making it to where
[34:51] that it can be used
[34:52] and see then he can't be complete
[34:55] without
[34:55] us but we're naturally we know that
[34:58] we're not in no way complete without him
[35:02] salvation is of the lord it's not you
[35:04] and me
[35:05] me all right see because then that way
[35:10] if he's if he if we can if we can study
[35:14] the word
[35:15] and see what he is today
[35:19] then what he was is wonderful that's
[35:21] that's all right that's
[35:23] i like that that's what i was trying to
[35:24] explain about the bible
[35:26] that i can read the bible now and i can
[35:29] just
[35:29] just just turn just read it and you know
[35:33] they they was building buildings back
[35:36] there they was doing all kind of things
[35:38] and
[35:39] you know all kinds of things was in
[35:41] manifestation
[35:42] you can sit there and think about those
[35:44] things
[35:45] all right but then you see the spiritual
[35:48] part of it when it comes forth in
[35:50] you see that he's building that in you
[35:53] because he didn't want to dwell in
[35:55] buildings
[35:57] that was never god's plan to have any
[35:59] kind of a fancy looking building or
[36:02] anything
[36:04] he didn't want that he brought that into
[36:08] being and used it because he used the
[36:10] tent the tabernacles and things
[36:12] he done those things yeah that's all
[36:13] right but that was not his plan
[36:17] his plan was to come down
[36:20] become mankind
[36:25] all right redeem the man
[36:29] make the man what he is
[36:34] and then one day change the whole thing
[36:36] because what did he do
[36:37] he came down he was god in
[36:41] in soul he was god in in spirit
[36:45] all right his body was a human body
[36:49] so that's where we're at that's what i
[36:52] was trying to get your emphasis to you
[36:53] for you
[36:54] to think about they're stood adam that's
[36:56] wonderful to me
[36:57] there stood adam and eve in the garden
[37:01] a body that would
[37:05] would you know finally do wrong and
[37:07] things
[37:09] but a soul and spirit to where that soul
[37:12] that was in them could be eternal
[37:15] and god looked at that and said that's
[37:17] what they are that's what i want to do
[37:21] remember how i was expressing it here a
[37:23] few weeks ago see
[37:25] adam came before the lord jesus did
[37:29] right adam came body spirit and soul
[37:35] and he came to the point of eternal life
[37:38] in his soul
[37:40] so thereby he could not be destroyed
[37:45] he was what god wanted for the time he
[37:47] was going to use that to bring forth the
[37:50] rest of his plan
[37:52] he was planning on coming to earth just
[37:54] like that man was
[37:56] and he did
[38:00] he came in body and spirit
[38:03] burst into a or brought forth you know
[38:06] whatever you want to call it begotten
[38:09] a body to live in all right
[38:12] and he lived in that all the years with
[38:14] mankind and and everything then one day
[38:16] he realized well i've got to give this
[38:17] body up now
[38:20] it's going to be bad he and i think i
[38:23] think the lord jesus enjoyed being a
[38:25] human
[38:27] now maybe you don't but i enjoy life
[38:32] i do i enjoy life i i never have fuss
[38:35] to drive into doorville that start with
[38:37] we were driving like 75 miles and took
[38:40] you two hours and a half to get there
[38:42] and that was every day and that to come
[38:45] back home
[38:46] because we had to go down through
[38:47] doorville and all across country there
[38:49] weren't no expressways
[38:51] but i never i never griped and
[38:55] complained about working
[38:58] i'd get off every time i could sure
[39:01] and they was nice enough a lot of times
[39:03] to let me off and to do you know
[39:05] because they knew that i would be there
[39:06] to work the rest of the time
[39:09] and out of 27 and a half years i was
[39:12] five minutes late one time
[39:17] so that order figured it i probably
[39:19] wanted to go to work
[39:21] you know all right but you see
[39:25] the thing that i didn't like was having
[39:28] to put up with mankind
[39:30] that was the part i didn't like as far
[39:32] as the work i never bothered me about
[39:34] working
[39:35] and all but it bothered me about the
[39:36] people around me you know and it was
[39:38] hard to get along with them sometimes
[39:40] and some
[39:40] sometimes it just it was fun you know
[39:44] to do but now listen
[39:49] so then if we come to the position now
[39:52] we've come through what he was to what
[39:55] he is
[39:56] you know or what he turned into being
[39:58] and what he is is
[40:00] and then what he is now all right we
[40:02] find he's here now
[40:03] in bodily form which is the bride
[40:10] right so without the bodily form look
[40:14] where you'd be
[40:15] now you're getting why the prophet would
[40:17] say it
[40:18] he said god is not complete without you
[40:20] well that that used to that hey it hit
[40:23] that old uh cranium cap up there with me
[40:25] and it just bounced around and
[40:27] and this you know i i just couldn't see
[40:30] it
[40:31] and one day it dawned on me just what
[40:33] i'm talking about now
[40:35] if he didn't have a body to live in
[40:38] he'd have to come back some way and do
[40:40] something
[40:42] so he came in bright form that's where
[40:45] he's at now
[40:46] and he's having a good time
[40:50] and i'm having a good time out of it you
[40:53] know
[40:54] i mean the basics of what i'll be going
[40:56] through this afternoon
[40:58] if i get there i preached this
[41:01] in athens georgia in 1969.
[41:07] that the bride of jesus christ
[41:11] would be
[41:14] the son of man the lord jesus christ
[41:18] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[41:22] in a people
[41:26] in 1969. so i've enjoyed it
[41:31] i can look back and think about that and
[41:33] remember those days and the things that
[41:35] i
[41:35] i did try to preach well you're just
[41:38] trying to be sorry well
[41:39] it happened what's your problem i mean
[41:42] you want to be sarcastic go ahead and
[41:44] call me that i don't care
[41:46] i've had a good time the this coming
[41:49] into the
[41:50] the the message it was not a bad thing
[41:54] for me you know a lot of people said
[41:56] well man i had trouble when i come into
[41:58] mexico because i was doing this and i
[42:00] was doing that you know
[42:01] and i i i had to quit this and i had to
[42:04] quit that and
[42:07] well
[42:10] i smoked a little bit when i was a kid
[42:12] most the time was rabbit tobacco
[42:15] a lot of you wouldn't know anything
[42:16] about those things but
[42:18] you know very little smoking no drinking
[42:23] probably yeah human being yeah okay same
[42:28] but i enjoyed living then
[42:33] a life as a human element
[42:38] not knowing that he would eventually
[42:40] come to me
[42:41] to try to get me to come back to where i
[42:44] should be in him
[42:47] go out and do wrong come home and sit
[42:49] there and think well
[42:50] what in the world did i do that for
[42:54] that wasn't right and i wasn't even a
[42:56] christian
[42:57] joined the baptist church when i was 18
[42:59] years old
[43:00] my wife and i were married and she was
[43:03] going to church and i'd been in church
[43:04] all of my life you know up and down
[43:06] so i said well i'll just go on with her
[43:09] so we went to
[43:10] you know the church i was 18 years old
[43:13] all right
[43:14] but i've enjoyed my life
[43:18] what i'm trying to get you to see is i
[43:20] believe god has enjoyed the point
[43:23] of a people living up on this earth
[43:26] that could live without having to be a
[43:28] garbage
[43:29] can some people tell you about the
[43:33] things a message took away
[43:35] i didn't have them i didn't drink i
[43:38] didn't do those things
[43:41] i thought you ought to be a christian we
[43:44] didn't have to get up on sunday morning
[43:47] are we going to church today
[43:50] there was never a thought
[43:55] it was never a thought never been a
[43:57] thought when we go on vacation we go to
[43:59] church
[44:03] we make some arrangements some way to be
[44:05] in a church
[44:07] well i was doing that in the baptist
[44:08] church
[44:10] i didn't have to quit doing this and
[44:13] quit doing that to come in this message
[44:15] my point i don't believe
[44:19] god was happy with us when we do wrong
[44:22] well when we try to do right i think he
[44:26] thinks that's my child
[44:28] i could spend a while on adoption in the
[44:30] statue of perfect man and a few things
[44:32] like that to try to
[44:33] understand that point right but i think
[44:35] you ought to understand
[44:37] all right see i think he has enjoyed the
[44:42] fact of living
[44:43] because the bible said it said about him
[44:45] and said you know
[44:46] that it plea he pleased god
[44:52] well i think he's pleased to dwell in
[44:54] you
[44:57] or he wouldn't be there it ain't a
[44:59] forceful thing that he's got to do it
[45:01] you know
[45:03] i think he enjoys living in his people
[45:07] i think he like brother branham would
[45:10] say about adam and eve
[45:12] he said god would come down in the day
[45:14] and you know at the end of the day and
[45:16] say my children said have you had a good
[45:18] time today
[45:20] yeah we've just we've had some good he's
[45:22] okay come we'll just lay down here
[45:24] and take a l little night you know a
[45:26] nice nap and
[45:27] wake up in the morning ready to go he
[45:29] was happy
[45:34] don't you think he's more happier with
[45:36] you than he was with adam and eve
[45:39] because adam and eve sure they had
[45:40] eternal life in their soul but
[45:42] but the point was they were not born
[45:43] again christians
[45:47] they were not per se or have they used
[45:49] that word fancy one time
[45:51] they were not the children of god
[45:54] as a born-again christian
[45:58] that had never come into existence
[46:02] but see when he came into existence 2
[46:04] 000 years ago
[46:06] then how much more happier is he today
[46:09] than he was when he started
[46:13] the worst that we could do
[46:16] he takes and makes it the greatest
[46:21] and comes down and dwells with his
[46:23] people
[46:25] satisfied to dwell
[46:29] well i i don't know whether he wants i
[46:31] think you order sometimes
[46:33] lay down in in the quietness of the
[46:35] night or sometimes just start praying
[46:37] and
[46:37] just start walking or something just
[46:40] this
[46:42] why i love to hunt i i've hunted a lot
[46:45] of days when my gun would be
[46:46] like the drums i didn't have it sitting
[46:50] next to me i was
[46:51] having me a good time
[46:55] took my little thing that brother
[46:57] richard and joe and him made for me and
[46:59] all the tapes was on it i just put that
[47:01] in my pocket
[47:02] i could sit back on that deer stand just
[47:04] click that thing on and
[47:05] just rotate through three tapes while i
[47:07] was because they're gonna be sitting
[47:09] there for four hours
[47:12] you know having a good time looking
[47:15] around and see the squirrels
[47:17] and see them just playing and everything
[47:19] i was in some big old timber one time
[47:21] you know what we call virgin timber
[47:23] great big tall trees and
[47:24] i was watching this squirrel and he come
[47:26] running down through there and jumped up
[47:27] on the tree next to me
[47:28] and he goes up that tree and that thing
[47:30] man i was in there just going
[47:32] and it was 50 foot high it was an inch
[47:36] and that squirrel went up the side of
[47:38] that tree all the way to the top
[47:41] and i sat now looking like that i lied i
[47:43] said well
[47:45] you made it up now you're gonna have to
[47:46] come back down
[47:49] he went out on a limb and he's just
[47:51] sprung off that limb
[47:54] right out in midair and he comes sailing
[47:58] and landed on a tree right next to me
[48:01] and it's just like he had done that many
[48:03] times before maybe
[48:05] because he just hit that tree and it
[48:07] just bounced like it
[48:08] and he just went on i sat there and
[48:10] cried
[48:12] i said god i wish i could trust you like
[48:18] that i think god wants to dwell with his
[48:22] people
[48:22] in the best well let me put it this way
[48:25] i think he would dwell
[48:26] will dwell with us and be with us in the
[48:29] worst that we are
[48:32] we won't even deal with the best we can
[48:34] be because that don't
[48:36] being best don't make you nothing with
[48:38] god i found that out a long time ago
[48:41] it's not what we do like that that works
[48:43] it's our repentant heart that he looks
[48:45] at
[48:46] and things that more of anything else
[48:48] all right now
[48:49] thinking about it so let me get on see
[48:53] god wanted to live with a man
[48:58] and the bride now is his body
[49:03] her soul is redeemed page 49
[49:06] future home waiting the redemption of
[49:10] the body
[49:12] all right waiting to a time that he can
[49:16] change these bodies and
[49:17] take us into glory okay
[49:22] so he's not going to change and get a
[49:24] new body
[49:26] i loved that when i heard the prophet
[49:28] when he first explained it
[49:31] because see we used to think was going
[49:32] to get a new one
[49:34] i mean that was after the message i
[49:36] still hear that in the people of this
[49:38] message
[49:39] some you know especially years ago when
[49:40] you used to go to a lot of the meetings
[49:42] you could still hear preachers and you'd
[49:43] say hey that guy believes in getting him
[49:45] a new body
[49:47] and they just literally come out and say
[49:48] it i'm going to get me a new body
[49:52] well i remember when them old baptist
[49:54] preachers said i'm going to get me a new
[49:55] body it don't matter about me smoking
[49:57] i'm gonna throw this in the way
[50:00] well i think well is that the way they
[50:02] think
[50:03] you know is that the way people think it
[50:05] now man
[50:07] but listen see then if we can realize
[50:12] who we are is that the way the prophet
[50:15] said it when the bride realizes who she
[50:17] is
[50:17] and what she's here for said she'll be
[50:20] an invincible army
[50:22] all right now in doing that
[50:27] let's just think about
[50:33] let's start the message now
[50:37] okay i got this wrote down where uh
[50:39] today's valentine's day
[50:41] to all you ladies you know happy
[50:43] valentine's day uh
[50:45] i i kind of thought about i thought well
[50:47] you know that's really something
[50:48] for me to be preaching about the bride
[50:50] of jesus christ on a
[50:52] on valentine's day because that was his
[50:55] desire
[50:56] his points was to live with a with a
[50:58] wife all right
[50:59] now you've seen what we were talking
[51:01] about in the message this morning so
[51:02] let's get started we'll start reading
[51:04] okay we're talking about this morning
[51:07] how that
[51:08] jesus was the body that god
[51:11] come and dwelt in all right
[51:14] we saw that god didn't want to live in
[51:18] buildings
[51:20] made by hand he wanted to live in the
[51:23] body
[51:24] and that was in the body of jesus christ
[51:26] because he would be the perfect son
[51:29] all right because god has always had a
[51:32] body to live in
[51:33] whether you want to go back before the
[51:35] world where you want to go anywhere he's
[51:36] always had a body
[51:38] and he's got a body now and that body
[51:40] now is the bride of jesus christ
[51:43] all right now we get down to the day
[51:47] that we're living
[51:48] now i want to read in reverse on one so
[51:51] brother uh anderson pull up number 20.
[51:57] uh that'll be the last quote i didn't
[51:59] give them a thing they didn't have to
[52:00] run anything this morning
[52:02] they just set their resting
[52:06] let's go to number 20 which is god's
[52:08] only provided place of worship
[52:12] they don't okay
[52:15] and listen to what he's saying the
[52:16] lutherans under justification defeat
[52:18] raised it like that
[52:20] wesley under sanctification of pentecost
[52:22] under the arms
[52:23] the works and the deeds and so forth had
[52:26] to be a cowardice
[52:27] or had to be a armenian had to be
[52:30] legalists but now
[52:32] we come to the pit come to the head the
[52:35] capstone
[52:36] grace grace the capstone cried the
[52:39] headstone
[52:40] crying what grace grace look
[52:43] past from death and creed into a living
[52:47] word of the living god now
[52:49] that's what god sees of us he sees it of
[52:52] somebody
[52:54] because that's what the prophet said
[52:55] pastor and death and god's only provided
[52:58] plan for his age his sons
[53:00] in the word age quickened by the spirit
[53:04] sparked it and lit off something to make
[53:06] it alive and sent
[53:08] and seated now in heavenly places now
[53:10] watch him
[53:12] you being a part of god's gene
[53:15] a part of the word other men are part of
[53:20] god's word
[53:20] seated together manifest the entire body
[53:23] of christ
[53:25] because there's no leaven among you
[53:30] all right now somebody's coming to that
[53:33] so we can do what we want to
[53:35] see what the see what he's talking about
[53:40] brother brown no no leaven among you
[53:43] just the word only seated in heavenly
[53:46] places
[53:48] in the door watch now
[53:51] where he put his name christ jesus
[53:55] no leaven among you that brings
[53:59] the entire fullness of the godhead
[54:02] bodily
[54:03] among you okay now we'll get you off the
[54:06] hook
[54:07] we don't if we don't think we can ever
[54:09] come to that place
[54:11] we don't have to worry about it
[54:14] we ain't going to be there
[54:17] we're going to go by the grave
[54:21] i'm talking to christian today i'm
[54:22] talking to sinners i'm talking to people
[54:24] that are not saved
[54:24] i'm talking to people looking at people
[54:26] that are christians
[54:29] that's why the lord showed me about 40
[54:31] years ago and i've told you about it
[54:34] that he showed me the biggest portion of
[54:35] people of this message was going to die
[54:38] and go by the grave because they would
[54:40] not be able to reach the a
[54:43] the point to where that they could take
[54:45] the change
[54:48] they would not settle down into the word
[54:50] and take the word for what it's saying
[54:52] and do it
[54:53] now i can't help it if something told me
[54:55] that i've told you that probably 50 75
[54:58] or 100 times
[54:59] over the 40 years so you ought to
[55:01] believe that something happened
[55:03] well i ain't telling what i'm just
[55:05] saying what it is because look no loving
[55:07] among you
[55:08] what's living sin no sin among you
[55:12] you have a brother there will never be
[55:16] then you're going by the grave
[55:21] if you say you can't come to a place
[55:24] that you can't live
[55:25] a life without having sin
[55:29] then you're contrary to the word of god
[55:36] so listen now living among you that
[55:38] brings the entire fullness of the
[55:39] godhead bodily among you
[55:42] watch him that he explains it
[55:45] so listen to what he's saying
[55:49] he's going to tell you how it's done
[55:51] because he's going to tell you
[55:52] why it can't be done or couldn't be done
[55:56] until this age
[55:59] look at it no living among you too
[56:03] that brings the entire fullness of the
[56:04] godhead bodily among you couldn't do it
[56:06] in luther's age
[56:10] luther couldn't say he didn't have any
[56:14] leaven
[56:18] come on couldn't do it and luther's life
[56:21] couldn't do it in wesley's age
[56:24] watch him this is the one that's hard
[56:26] shaking couldn't do it in the
[56:28] pentecostal age
[56:35] you mean brother dale that those people
[56:37] are not no he's not saying those people
[56:39] ain't going
[56:42] he's saying they couldn't come to a
[56:44] change
[56:46] a change of the body couldn't come down
[56:48] through those ages
[56:51] no word oh yeah a little hearing little
[56:54] liar little things happening right
[56:56] god living among them
[57:01] but look i couldn't do it in the
[57:04] pentecostal delays
[57:05] but in the day when the son of man
[57:09] will be manifested okay what's got to
[57:11] happen
[57:14] the son of man's got to be manifested is
[57:16] that the reading
[57:18] am i in english reading and what it says
[57:24] am i taking what i've tried to explain
[57:26] this morning of the bible
[57:27] that you can read there and this half of
[57:29] that happened that's happened that
[57:31] you said one that was in the natural
[57:33] then to flop over
[57:34] and you can see at the same time and all
[57:36] those things in the natural
[57:37] here come god right down through in
[57:40] genesis
[57:41] two and one you know making man and two
[57:44] and coming forth and then three where is
[57:46] it at the
[57:48] seat of the woman right and look
[57:52] so it couldn't do it in the pentecostal
[57:53] age couldn't do any western days
[57:55] couldn't do it in luther's day
[57:56] why there was no promise
[58:00] in those ages that the son of man would
[58:02] come to the earth again
[58:08] all right
[58:11] in the day when the son of man will be
[58:13] manifested
[58:14] reveal brought back the church together
[58:18] with the entire deity
[58:24] of god amongst his people
[58:27] showing the same visible signs
[58:30] manifesting himself like he did at the
[58:32] beginning
[58:33] when he was manifested on earth in the
[58:36] form of a prophet
[58:37] or o glory promised by malachi 4
[58:42] promised by the rest of the scriptures
[58:45] what where are you worshiping at
[58:49] the house of god now listen
[58:52] now let me say something to her i try to
[58:55] explain things and maybe i shouldn't
[58:58] brother would be i remember that he said
[59:01] you'll find out when these days you
[59:03] can't do what you do that's what
[59:05] he said you're trying to explain it
[59:09] he said you can't explain it
[59:14] i said well might not be able to explain
[59:18] it
[59:20] but i sure don't want to leave it in a
[59:21] dumb situation it can't be understood
[59:27] is that plain enough to you i know i
[59:30] can't explain this message
[59:32] but i've tried my best to at least get
[59:33] us out of the dumb situation that most
[59:35] people exist
[59:36] in if you want your feelings hurt go
[59:39] ahead
[59:40] about i'm not trying to win nothing that
[59:41] way i'm just trying to tell you the
[59:43] truth
[59:45] what is the prophet saying he said he
[59:47] could not
[59:51] luther's age had
[59:55] sin go to your church ages we're on that
[59:58] and listening to some of it now
[1:00:00] go to those church ages and look and get
[1:00:03] the names and the things like
[1:00:05] uh you know which one is it i know i
[1:00:07] remember one of them uh
[1:00:11] which one was it were columba yeah
[1:00:14] temperance
[1:00:15] fourth church eight you come into those
[1:00:19] situations until it was pitiful
[1:00:23] you had a few people trying to survive
[1:00:26] rest was running after the catholic
[1:00:28] church
[1:00:31] he couldn't do it in west luthor's age
[1:00:34] he couldn't do it in wesley's age
[1:00:37] he said well the pentecostal had he said
[1:00:39] you couldn't do it in the pentecost
[1:00:41] the pentecostal age couldn't come to the
[1:00:43] chains of the body
[1:00:48] and if you can't come to the chains of
[1:00:50] the body what is the need of talking
[1:00:51] about a body
[1:00:55] well see i'm putting it the best that i
[1:00:57] can to where i try to prove it
[1:00:59] there's no age back there i had the son
[1:01:00] of man
[1:01:04] now he's the one that put it
[1:01:09] is it not the truth of knowing the son
[1:01:11] of man now we're talking about
[1:01:13] for a minute we'll talk on the level of
[1:01:15] natural things we read in the book
[1:01:18] natural things are reading the book you
[1:01:19] realize that there's no way in the world
[1:01:21] we could make it without this prophet's
[1:01:22] message
[1:01:24] the prophet and the message now that's
[1:01:26] as simple as i can make it
[1:01:28] to make you know that i'm not dependent
[1:01:31] upon samuel dale wade dale
[1:01:33] or anybody else to try to bring
[1:01:37] something to get
[1:01:38] us changed we've already got the message
[1:01:43] and when i read about the son of man i
[1:01:46] don't read out brother branham
[1:01:48] i read it in there what that son of man
[1:01:50] was supposed to be and do
[1:01:55] because without him bringing the message
[1:01:57] where would we be see it couldn't be
[1:01:59] done in luther's age
[1:02:00] there wasn't enough word couldn't be
[1:02:02] done in wesley's age
[1:02:05] couldn't be done in the in the
[1:02:06] pentecostal age
[1:02:08] he said well brother no he didn't come
[1:02:10] into pentecostal age
[1:02:12] he's not the messenger of the
[1:02:13] pentecostal
[1:02:16] he's the malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation
[1:02:18] 10 7
[1:02:19] you get them all together you'll come
[1:02:21] out of the out of lady osea
[1:02:23] into the bright age which is not an
[1:02:26] additional age
[1:02:28] all right so now think about it
[1:02:34] it has to be in this age
[1:02:38] that the son of man would have to come
[1:02:42] back in this age or time wherever you
[1:02:44] want to put it
[1:02:45] because i've said it there it ain't no
[1:02:46] age then i say they're real cause you
[1:02:47] can't be
[1:02:48] we're in an age we're in time until lady
[1:02:51] osea finishes
[1:02:52] and lady osea finishes when you enter
[1:02:54] the millennium and the millennium is
[1:02:55] still time because it's a thousand years
[1:02:58] so then get all that off your mind and
[1:03:00] try to you say i'm trying to figure out
[1:03:02] what you're talking about
[1:03:03] don't just take what i say
[1:03:06] and just think about it now watch
[1:03:12] then the bride of jesus christ
[1:03:16] would be the body and it would come up
[1:03:19] through the ages luther was a part of
[1:03:20] the body of christ
[1:03:21] wesley was a part of pentecostals was a
[1:03:24] part of the body of christ we're not
[1:03:26] taking those people out and throwing
[1:03:27] them away
[1:03:29] they were a part of the breath but there
[1:03:31] was not a manifestation of the son of
[1:03:34] man
[1:03:38] that would have to wait until the
[1:03:39] prophet came on the scene
[1:03:41] and he plainly told us i am not the son
[1:03:44] of man
[1:03:45] is that the way he said it he said he's
[1:03:47] the son of man
[1:03:50] he was the one to introduce like john
[1:03:52] was not
[1:03:53] the lord jesus christ but he was the one
[1:03:56] to stand on the scene
[1:03:58] to make known the lord jesus or reveal
[1:04:01] him
[1:04:02] all right now the body of christ
[1:04:06] the bride of christ see if we can come
[1:04:10] over into this
[1:04:11] with us and see it realize that we can
[1:04:13] move up a step or two
[1:04:15] from a point that we've established the
[1:04:17] point is what
[1:04:18] luther wesley pentecost couldn't do it
[1:04:22] so there had to be something take place
[1:04:24] so that was the mani
[1:04:26] coming of the malachi 4
[1:04:29] the son of man all right all right we
[1:04:32] got that settled to where we can
[1:04:34] talk about it okay and in doing that
[1:04:37] then we can see that there is a
[1:04:39] possibility
[1:04:41] i like to say it that way there's a
[1:04:44] possibility
[1:04:46] of coming to a change of the body why
[1:04:49] because we have the message of malachi
[1:04:52] 4.
[1:04:56] as wade was quoting what the rapture
[1:04:58] lays in these tyson books
[1:05:00] it's in this message we ain't looking
[1:05:02] somewhere else i ain't looking for
[1:05:04] brother so-and-so to jump up and boy get
[1:05:06] this to go and you know
[1:05:08] i see people do that and i think well
[1:05:11] i'll see you on the way back you know
[1:05:14] how you keep up with the joneses
[1:05:16] you ever heard that one you know you
[1:05:18] just keep up with the joneses
[1:05:21] you know how to keep up with jones's
[1:05:22] stand still
[1:05:25] why because they're going to be back
[1:05:29] oh they're going to run out there
[1:05:31] they're coming back
[1:05:32] just stand still wait on them keep up
[1:05:35] with the joneses
[1:05:38] so what about just doing that with a
[1:05:39] message and just stay with the message
[1:05:42] and do it all right let's read a couple
[1:05:45] of scriptures and get our thought from
[1:05:46] there and go on
[1:05:47] go ahead brothers now to number one
[1:05:50] which is colossians
[1:05:53] 1 17. let's just hit these things
[1:05:58] and i'll try not to be too long i'll cut
[1:06:01] it
[1:06:01] if i have to i'll put it in later
[1:06:05] i always got preached all right you got
[1:06:07] it colossians
[1:06:09] now and he is before all things
[1:06:14] and by him all things consist
[1:06:18] amen right who is that the lord jesus
[1:06:22] christ
[1:06:23] watch me the son of man
[1:06:29] i hope we get time when we're done i'll
[1:06:30] put another message you realize the only
[1:06:32] way he can be a father is to be the son
[1:06:34] of man
[1:06:36] that's what brother ronald said
[1:06:39] what do you mean well it's the father he
[1:06:41] wanted to be
[1:06:44] okay you think on that for a while watch
[1:06:46] him and he is the head of the body
[1:06:48] the church who is the beginning the
[1:06:52] first born from the dead that in all
[1:06:53] things he might have the preeminence
[1:06:56] for it please the father that in him
[1:06:58] should all
[1:06:59] fullness dwell
[1:07:02] in him all fullness dwells
[1:07:06] all right let's just read a little bit
[1:07:09] more go ahead to the next one
[1:07:13] which is colossians 2 9-10
[1:07:17] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:07:20] the godhead
[1:07:22] bodily in that odd you never thought
[1:07:24] about that
[1:07:26] you don't never just sit down and think
[1:07:27] well why did it say bodily
[1:07:32] because it's going to be in the body
[1:07:36] right he said bodily because it's going
[1:07:40] to be in the body
[1:07:42] is that sensible
[1:07:45] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:07:47] the godhead bodily
[1:07:48] now watch it and ye are complete
[1:07:53] in him so if he's the fullness of the
[1:07:56] godhead bodily
[1:07:57] where are you at by being
[1:08:00] in the bride of jesus christ is the body
[1:08:03] listen
[1:08:04] and ye are complete
[1:08:07] in him which is the head of all
[1:08:10] principality
[1:08:12] and power all right
[1:08:18] can i translate this with what the
[1:08:20] prophet says is in here somewhere
[1:08:24] it says he's not complete without you
[1:08:28] you know he chose it that away brother
[1:08:31] ray we didn't have anything to do with
[1:08:32] that did we
[1:08:34] you say oh i prayed i cried yeah
[1:08:38] the bible says no man sought god
[1:08:44] now the bible is not saying and neither
[1:08:47] is the prophet
[1:08:48] not saying that you didn't cry in search
[1:08:51] and fast and do it's just saying
[1:08:55] simply you couldn't do it
[1:09:00] right it has to be what he does
[1:09:04] the bible says the goodness of god is
[1:09:06] what lead us to repentance
[1:09:08] okay now go ahead to the next one
[1:09:12] i like this one oh paul he without
[1:09:14] having him a good time one day going
[1:09:16] around look
[1:09:17] and he runs up on this great big place
[1:09:19] and sees all that's going on and
[1:09:21] he'll fall smart paul said i'll
[1:09:25] i'll take this and i'll trap them in
[1:09:27] their own words
[1:09:29] and that's what he done well listen
[1:09:33] acts 17 28-30 for in him
[1:09:37] we move we live and move
[1:09:41] and have our being as certain also of
[1:09:44] your
[1:09:45] own poets have said
[1:09:48] we are also his offspring
[1:09:52] he tricked him right into the point said
[1:09:55] you guys have been talking about this
[1:09:57] unknown god
[1:10:00] and i want to talk to you about him and
[1:10:03] says you went through every bit of this
[1:10:05] and said you even admit
[1:10:09] that you think you were a child of this
[1:10:11] god
[1:10:13] you just don't know who he is but let me
[1:10:16] talk to you about it
[1:10:18] or as much then as we are the offspring
[1:10:22] now look what he says he trapped him he
[1:10:24] nailed her hide to where they couldn't
[1:10:25] answer back
[1:10:26] also of your own poison said for we are
[1:10:28] all we
[1:10:29] are also his offspring somebody sitting
[1:10:32] there saying
[1:10:33] i i don't know about he says for as much
[1:10:36] then
[1:10:36] as we are the offspring of god
[1:10:39] you admitted it that that god
[1:10:44] has got children
[1:10:48] right for as much then as we are the
[1:10:50] offspring of god
[1:10:51] we are not to think of the godhead is
[1:10:54] likened to gold
[1:10:56] or silver or stone craven by art and
[1:10:59] man's devices
[1:11:02] why would you ever want to try to put up
[1:11:04] an image to a
[1:11:06] unknown god or a known god
[1:11:09] try to make an image to it
[1:11:15] you can't he says we don't do that
[1:11:19] we don't want to put the godhead in any
[1:11:21] position of thinking about it that it's
[1:11:24] pretty gold look at it look at that
[1:11:26] statue we've got
[1:11:27] look at that image we've made
[1:11:33] i get kind of tickled thinking about uh
[1:11:36] moses when he went up on the mountain
[1:11:38] and he come back down and
[1:11:40] and they was trying to tell him that
[1:11:43] they just took this gold and they just
[1:11:45] got it real hot and throwed it up in the
[1:11:47] air and it just fell back down and
[1:11:48] there's a calf
[1:11:55] boy i wouldn't want to follow them guys
[1:11:59] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:12:02] of god
[1:12:02] we are not to think that the godhead is
[1:12:05] like unto gold or silver
[1:12:06] or stoned graven by art and man's
[1:12:10] devices
[1:12:12] and the times of this ignorance god
[1:12:14] winked at but now commandeth all men
[1:12:17] ever were to repent what about it
[1:12:25] what would a godhead be likened unto if
[1:12:28] it's not likened unto gold and silver
[1:12:30] in other words if you were going to make
[1:12:32] an image to your god what would you do
[1:12:40] you were going to make an image to your
[1:12:41] god
[1:12:43] in other words thinking what he looked
[1:12:45] like
[1:12:48] what would you do
[1:12:52] well i'd i'd not make him he'd he'd be a
[1:12:55] 30 year old man and he'd have wavy hair
[1:12:58] and he'd
[1:12:59] no no
[1:13:05] but you know what i like you may not
[1:13:07] like the way i approach the thing that's
[1:13:09] okay
[1:13:09] but you know what i like i like the fact
[1:13:13] of what
[1:13:13] our prophet has done he said i've seen
[1:13:17] him two or three times
[1:13:20] now that's a direct quote if you i've
[1:13:22] seen him two or three times
[1:13:24] and he said the best that i could see of
[1:13:27] him is hoffman's head of christ at 33.
[1:13:32] well you know what
[1:13:36] i ain't trying to make no image or do
[1:13:37] nothing but i do think one thing
[1:13:40] we got pictures downstairs
[1:13:43] that are people that have passed away
[1:13:45] here
[1:13:47] and there they're like 18 20 years of
[1:13:49] age because i want to see
[1:13:51] what they look like when they come forth
[1:13:53] in the resurrection
[1:13:56] well now you try to describe me as to
[1:13:59] seeing jesus and
[1:14:00] you know and you try to make it has to
[1:14:02] be the prophet the best he could do
[1:14:04] would make it
[1:14:05] hoffman's but now he didn't say that
[1:14:07] that's the way it totally looked
[1:14:10] but he said it was the best of his
[1:14:12] understanding of side of what he said
[1:14:15] i've seen him to it two two or three
[1:14:16] times maybe three times i
[1:14:18] forgot which way the statement is okay
[1:14:22] well see we don't want to make no images
[1:14:24] out of him i was told when i first came
[1:14:26] in the message
[1:14:26] what we need to do is we need to get
[1:14:28] before the preacher of brother branham
[1:14:30] and draw and get before that and pray
[1:14:34] was you ever told that
[1:14:39] well i had just come away from the fact
[1:14:42] of the people back there
[1:14:43] thinking about jesus and i didn't want
[1:14:47] to try to get down before i never have
[1:14:48] been wanted wanted to get before a
[1:14:50] picture
[1:14:51] if i got to have a picture to remind me
[1:14:52] who god is and what's going on i'm in
[1:14:54] bad shape
[1:14:59] but yet we do know and the thing that we
[1:15:01] we can see i don't
[1:15:03] i agree with the point that we can say
[1:15:05] that that's probably what he'll look
[1:15:07] like
[1:15:08] because i believe when we get there that
[1:15:10] you're not going to see a father over
[1:15:12] here and a son over here and a holy
[1:15:14] ghost over here
[1:15:15] you're going to see the lord jesus
[1:15:17] christ
[1:15:18] i believe that amen he said we will have
[1:15:22] a body like unto his glorious body
[1:15:24] well he ain't going to be all twisted
[1:15:28] but there's one thing he'll have he'll
[1:15:30] have nail prints in here
[1:15:32] because that's still in the word think
[1:15:35] on
[1:15:35] these things i don't know what you're
[1:15:38] getting to
[1:15:40] all right let's start reading a little
[1:15:42] bit go ahead to number four
[1:15:44] let's pick up a few of these and just
[1:15:46] read some
[1:15:50] he's talking about this coming down to
[1:15:52] an age that had
[1:15:53] got in such a mess all right
[1:15:59] 46 yeah what you notice here he said at
[1:16:02] the end of the ending of the church
[1:16:04] eight
[1:16:04] it had got in such a mess till he would
[1:16:07] be revealed again as son of man
[1:16:10] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:16:13] how appropriate was that
[1:16:15] mix-up yesterday and i hope you don't
[1:16:17] miss it okay
[1:16:18] what come on not where we can see
[1:16:22] god manifested himself there as sodom as
[1:16:25] a prophet
[1:16:26] being a man in the flesh god
[1:16:30] elohim as i heard someone speak of it a
[1:16:33] while ago
[1:16:34] which the godhead bodily was in him he
[1:16:37] was the fullness
[1:16:38] elohim is the fullness of the godhead
[1:16:40] bodily
[1:16:42] now if he's the fullness
[1:16:46] if we can take like we did this morning
[1:16:48] we took if you listen
[1:16:49] we took where it says the body thou hast
[1:16:51] prepared me we applied that to the lord
[1:16:54] jesus christ and the bringing forth of
[1:16:55] the body of jesus christ upon the earth
[1:16:57] and then we switched it over to the
[1:16:59] bride of jesus christ
[1:17:00] that the bride of jesus christ has
[1:17:02] become the body of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:04] on earth and the only body that god has
[1:17:06] on earth at this time
[1:17:08] and the only body that'll be on this
[1:17:09] earth until we come to the change
[1:17:12] because we meet him in the air all right
[1:17:16] now we come to talking about this one
[1:17:19] that we talk about the lord jesus christ
[1:17:22] that he is the son of man
[1:17:27] now from here on for a while you're
[1:17:29] going to hear statements made
[1:17:32] that you're going to look at and wonder
[1:17:34] if brother branham had something to do
[1:17:36] with some of these things
[1:17:38] and i agree he did
[1:17:41] god used the man
[1:17:44] to bring the message the gifts and the
[1:17:47] things were there
[1:17:49] worked and done like that
[1:17:52] and and i'm honest to say it would be
[1:17:55] hard to
[1:17:56] have set there with him without looking
[1:17:58] at him in the wrong way
[1:18:00] i agree because i mean like
[1:18:03] he'd say he wasn't the brother wood you
[1:18:05] know if a man can tell you about the
[1:18:07] fish you're going to catch once they
[1:18:08] catches them you know well that's you
[1:18:12] know
[1:18:12] you just think about it if you stay
[1:18:14] there with him day in and day out and
[1:18:16] he just tell you every little thing
[1:18:20] i'd get worried get pretty nervous
[1:18:23] but you got to remember to keep
[1:18:25] separated the man
[1:18:29] from the gift that was within him
[1:18:32] and i ain't going to get it today but we
[1:18:34] will later
[1:18:35] to try to see how that the bible's
[1:18:39] in the writing of the bible brother
[1:18:40] brown says i know three times
[1:18:43] that the lord jesus looked like had a
[1:18:46] dual personality
[1:18:49] he said one time he would talk one time
[1:18:51] the father would talk
[1:18:53] now there's one in here where brother
[1:18:54] brandon done a marvelous job because he
[1:18:56] took us
[1:18:59] and he says now he's explaining you know
[1:19:01] how that
[1:19:03] one time jesus speak one time the father
[1:19:05] and he said
[1:19:06] like you are he said you go to work
[1:19:11] and he said that was what that's what
[1:19:12] gets me of the message of the man the
[1:19:14] way he could explain it
[1:19:16] did you go to work
[1:19:20] and said you're one personality
[1:19:23] you know one thing dealing because
[1:19:25] you're working
[1:19:26] he said then you come back to church or
[1:19:28] come home
[1:19:30] and see then you're dealing in another
[1:19:31] part
[1:19:33] how wonderful that can be explained to
[1:19:35] us
[1:19:37] that god so much has made himself
[1:19:39] manifest among us
[1:19:41] until we can see him
[1:19:44] let's read a couple then real quick okay
[1:19:47] go ahead to number five
[1:19:53] because i'll hold the point try to of
[1:19:55] the fact that be in him
[1:19:57] the lord jesus be in the fullness of the
[1:19:59] godhead bodily and then we'll break off
[1:20:01] and i'll do it on another message in
[1:20:03] order to talk about you and me
[1:20:06] and in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:20:08] godhead bodily
[1:20:10] all powers in heavens and earth
[1:20:14] is given unto my hands
[1:20:20] read that for yourself
[1:20:26] all powers in heaven
[1:20:30] and earth is given unto my hands he said
[1:20:33] all the power
[1:20:34] then god is powerless if he's another
[1:20:38] person
[1:20:40] how man could talk ain't none of us can
[1:20:43] do nothing like that don't worry about
[1:20:44] it we ain't going to
[1:20:46] you can't talk that language
[1:20:50] that's exactly what i was saying this
[1:20:52] morning where you look over here in
[1:20:53] genesis 1 and you see what was written
[1:20:55] the things that literally took place
[1:20:59] and then you go to genesis 2 and you see
[1:21:01] a spiritual application or something
[1:21:04] think about what he's saying all powers
[1:21:06] in heavens and earth
[1:21:07] is given in unto my hands he said all
[1:21:11] the power then god is powerless if he's
[1:21:13] another person
[1:21:14] for the bible said jesus said after his
[1:21:17] resurrection
[1:21:18] that all the power in heaven and earth
[1:21:20] both was given
[1:21:22] into my hands think about it
[1:21:26] think about how simple go ahead to the
[1:21:27] next one number six
[1:21:32] in him remember and dwelt all the
[1:21:33] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:21:36] in him never dwelt just a part of god
[1:21:39] but all of god was in his son christ
[1:21:42] jesus
[1:21:43] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:21:44] bodily all of god was poured out
[1:21:47] in christ all that god was
[1:21:51] in was was in christ all that christ
[1:21:55] is he poured out on the church
[1:21:59] but you keep refusing it
[1:22:03] why did he say that
[1:22:08] brother branham what are you getting now
[1:22:11] you say you were refusing it
[1:22:17] are we refusing to accept the things
[1:22:19] that he has said we are
[1:22:25] if he says we are the fullness of the
[1:22:27] godhead bodily
[1:22:28] and without us he's not complete so then
[1:22:32] he can't be the fullness of the godhead
[1:22:33] bodily without you
[1:22:37] is he saying that we're turning it down
[1:22:42] that's the only thing i can read
[1:22:45] said we keep refusing it refusing what
[1:22:48] refusing to believe what we are and what
[1:22:51] we're doing
[1:22:53] and what he's doing and what he's doing
[1:22:58] oh brother dale i believe it well
[1:23:05] like i said a while ago
[1:23:08] we didn't lay out a church we don't lay
[1:23:11] out a church now
[1:23:13] the church is first number one then we
[1:23:15] go on our vacations and our
[1:23:17] doings it's always been that way the
[1:23:20] kids didn't get up and say well
[1:23:21] we don't want to go to church today
[1:23:23] nobody's ever said anything about it
[1:23:26] we're just there
[1:23:30] could that be the way he's saying we
[1:23:32] refused it
[1:23:34] okay go ahead to number seven
[1:23:38] christ is a mystery of god reveal
[1:23:41] god expressed in jesus christ who was
[1:23:44] both father son and holy ghost
[1:23:46] the fullness of the godhead bodily now
[1:23:48] the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:23:50] bodily
[1:23:52] dwells in the catholic church
[1:23:58] brother tell anybody see the complete
[1:24:01] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:24:03] dwells in his church
[1:24:06] the preeminence all that god was he
[1:24:10] poured into christ
[1:24:12] and all christ was he poured into the
[1:24:15] church
[1:24:16] the believers now how many times
[1:24:23] i didn't run it up to see but i wonder
[1:24:25] how many times
[1:24:26] did brother branham explain that one
[1:24:28] little point
[1:24:30] all god was he poured into christ all
[1:24:32] christ into the church
[1:24:33] take her back to the garden of eden or
[1:24:35] whatever many different wordings on the
[1:24:37] end
[1:24:37] how many times do you say that
[1:24:44] almost every message
[1:24:47] right
[1:24:50] but yet do we believe that we could be
[1:24:52] that
[1:24:56] huh let's reread that and again i want
[1:25:01] to read it
[1:25:02] number seven is that number seven
[1:25:07] okay god expressed in jesus christ who
[1:25:10] was both father son and holy ghost
[1:25:12] the fullness of the godhead bodily now
[1:25:14] the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:25:16] bodily dwells in his church
[1:25:18] the preeminence all that god was he
[1:25:21] poured into christ and all that christ
[1:25:22] was he poured into the church to
[1:25:26] believers
[1:25:28] what about
[1:25:31] could it be that we're turning down what
[1:25:33] god has said about us
[1:25:40] he tried to hammer up something line up
[1:25:43] and
[1:25:43] get belts out and whoop each other to
[1:25:45] try to get places you know
[1:25:47] lined up and get us to straighten out in
[1:25:48] the word and he never done that yet
[1:25:53] but are we accepting what god says about
[1:25:55] us
[1:25:59] i just don't see how that could have
[1:26:01] what's that got to do with it
[1:26:03] who are you
[1:26:08] do you mean i'm me well why would you
[1:26:09] think like that
[1:26:13] that's you're not god
[1:26:17] oh you hurt my feelings well i'm sorry
[1:26:24] i guess i'll keep on hurting things
[1:26:26] because that's the way i've always felt
[1:26:28] i feel that we in 1969
[1:26:33] and i preached that the bride of jesus
[1:26:35] christ
[1:26:37] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:26:40] the son of man
[1:26:46] i wish i could have had to keep it but
[1:26:48] that don't make no difference
[1:26:51] well you wouldn't believe it if you sit
[1:26:52] and listen to it
[1:26:54] if you're not going to believe it now
[1:26:57] but you see i just happen to believe it
[1:27:00] i believe
[1:27:00] god has a way
[1:27:05] now upon earth in a group of people
[1:27:10] we'll continue to read more this but
[1:27:11] just hold on if wade gave them out
[1:27:14] i made about uh 20 x or 20 something
[1:27:16] extra copies
[1:27:18] and you if you want to read about what
[1:27:19] the prophet says take them home read
[1:27:21] them
[1:27:22] where he says the bride is the fullness
[1:27:24] of the godhead bodily
[1:27:30] couldn't do it in the days of luther
[1:27:32] couldn't do it in the days of wesley
[1:27:35] right couldn't do it
[1:27:38] in pentecost but it could be done today
[1:27:41] why
[1:27:42] because the son of man
[1:27:46] is here the lord jesus christ himself
[1:27:51] is here in the form of his bride
[1:27:54] believing the word
[1:28:00] but i i i just i look around i just
[1:28:03] don't see it nowhere
[1:28:06] well maybe you order
[1:28:09] let your nose down just a little bit and
[1:28:11] get it on level ground
[1:28:12] instead of way up in the air to think
[1:28:14] that you're something
[1:28:17] bring it down to think about all of us
[1:28:19] if there's anything in this building
[1:28:22] spiritually speaking that's worth
[1:28:23] anything it's the lord jesus christ
[1:28:27] it is not me and you
[1:28:31] it is not brother branham
[1:28:34] he brought the message but he done his
[1:28:37] work and went home
[1:28:39] he'll have a great reward when we get
[1:28:41] there with him because we'll all be
[1:28:43] there with him
[1:28:44] wonderful but yet somebody has got to
[1:28:49] accept the word
[1:28:51] and believe it that's why i mention it
[1:28:54] again
[1:28:57] people was laughing back there when
[1:29:02] the lady run for the president's job or
[1:29:04] vice president what she done
[1:29:05] clinton and everybody couldn't think
[1:29:08] about nothing else brother run said and
[1:29:10] they'd just start laughing about
[1:29:11] well she couldn't that couldn't be her
[1:29:12] cause she ain't pretty
[1:29:17] i've never done that
[1:29:20] because i know brother brown wasn't
[1:29:22] talking about that kind of beauty
[1:29:24] ugliness or beauty he was talking about
[1:29:27] the controls and the doings of what they
[1:29:29] could do
[1:29:32] but now since it's come to the basis
[1:29:33] that the woman's in the white house
[1:29:35] do you hear the ministers of this
[1:29:37] message saying look at our
[1:29:39] we're in the end
[1:29:43] we're in the end because we're seeing
[1:29:46] the natural things that the prophet
[1:29:48] spoke of
[1:29:55] seeing him made manifest
[1:30:00] he said in the last few hours of
[1:30:04] the time back there with the lord jesus
[1:30:06] right before the crucifixion
[1:30:08] he said the biggest portion of the
[1:30:09] scripture was fulfilled
[1:30:13] could it be that way what are you
[1:30:16] looking for
[1:30:20] your prophet said that we'd be at the
[1:30:22] mercy of the elements
[1:30:25] but the bride don't go through the
[1:30:26] tribulation so there must be a
[1:30:28] pre-tribulation going to strike
[1:30:31] and i believe we're in it
[1:30:37] and right now all they got to do is call
[1:30:39] it in and you don't have no money
[1:30:43] wouldn't that be a horrible thing
[1:30:47] ain't going to get mine don't start that
[1:30:49] foolishness
[1:30:51] you're the first one to come after
[1:30:55] they say we're going to do the best we
[1:30:57] can do
[1:30:59] well because we're not going to be in
[1:31:00] the tribulation no huh
[1:31:02] no there's no such thing as putting the
[1:31:04] bride in the tribulation
[1:31:07] but there's a pre-tribulation to strike
[1:31:10] that ought to divide that point that the
[1:31:12] prophet said
[1:31:13] that the bride don't go through the
[1:31:14] tribulation then he comes over here and
[1:31:16] says but we'll be at the mercy of the
[1:31:18] elements
[1:31:19] he evidently saw some things that was
[1:31:21] going to get pretty bad
[1:31:25] if they can tell you you can't do this
[1:31:27] and you can't do that
[1:31:28] take your kids out of school close down
[1:31:30] companies this building everything if
[1:31:33] they can do that
[1:31:34] don't think they can't demand a lot of
[1:31:36] other things
[1:31:40] but would that have to be the
[1:31:42] tribulation
[1:31:45] that's what i asked the people years ago
[1:31:49] i said what if california goes under and
[1:31:52] we're still here
[1:31:53] well that mean we wouldn't bribe we
[1:31:56] missed it
[1:31:57] i said boy that's how much you
[1:31:58] understand i said get in your bible and
[1:32:00] you'll find out there's two
[1:32:02] earthquakes
[1:32:08] there's an earthquake at the
[1:32:10] resurrection of the saints
[1:32:15] but then there's an earthquake under the
[1:32:18] sixth seal
[1:32:24] right
[1:32:26] see it's not sitting down and simply
[1:32:28] taking it easy
[1:32:30] and studying the message and just see
[1:32:33] what the prophet has to say about this
[1:32:35] thing
[1:32:36] we get it all figured out we can't do
[1:32:38] this can't do that
[1:32:39] no just say it real simple
[1:32:43] we'll do the best we can do
[1:32:48] we'll make it
[1:32:51] the real point is of whether or not we
[1:32:53] are the bride of jesus christ
[1:32:58] you mean if i miss it does that mean
[1:33:00] that there is no god
[1:33:04] no not quite come on musicians
[1:33:09] just think on these things
[1:33:14] jesus christ was the fullness of the
[1:33:16] godhead bodily
[1:33:18] brother branham over and over and over
[1:33:20] said
[1:33:21] all god was which would be the fullness
[1:33:24] of the godhead bodily
[1:33:26] was poured into christ which would be
[1:33:28] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:33:29] which was poured into the church which
[1:33:31] would be the fullness of the godhead
[1:33:32] bodily
[1:33:35] how much more do we need
[1:33:38] to think on these things remember it's
[1:33:41] not what we think about ourselves at
[1:33:43] mouths it's what he is
[1:33:47] understand back on these things
[1:33:56] brother dale you you you talk about like
[1:33:58] sometimes that we're
[1:33:59] we can be in this and we can be in that
[1:34:01] i'm just telling you what the prophet
[1:34:03] said
[1:34:04] when it takes place is up to god
[1:34:08] but i don't want to be left here
