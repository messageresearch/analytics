come on service is nearing and in Quire is singing just as I am here now where's the song is played personifying finding Mercy struggling time was because that's what this holder is for is the love that's true that's what this altar is for eign saw them back for you hearts are being broken lives are being changed they'll never be the be the same thing the time has come that's why what is all songs like blood thank you there's a love that's true though that's what this holder is Jesus go quickly now before they go foreign thank you foreign my heart I'll reach I'll reach how I wish see thank you Lord zombies foreign thank you my shoes on my feet foreign good evening amen I don't know how I get Rebecca and Rachel but I do that everywhere I go my grandma used to call my mother Martha her name was Alberta and she called my aunt Alberta and her name was Martin and I thought she was trying to cause a problem between them but I found out later in life is that what that wasn't the way it was amen let's try about about the G baby ain't got good already already went away you know like I said this morning um it seems like every message I pick up here lately it has to deal with the new birth and I know when I came last night to the little bible study that they were doing they were talking about sanctification which is a part of that new birth right and so I know they've been teaching justification sanctification baptism all in a person absolutely coming and dwelling in you that's what it is exactly it seems like every message and I mentioned it this morning if it be transformation where something changes right right where it's the statue of a perfect man where you can't even start up here until you have the new birth right and then I've been reading here lately in The Invisible Union amen and basically it's the same thing right it's a new birth there can't be a union without a birth do you understand that so just it seems like everywhere now it talks about the new birth I think probably one of the most misunderstood uh should I say I don't like to use the word doctor because it almost sounds negative in some ways but the most misunderstood doctrine that there is around the message of the hour is the new birth and I believe there are many many people who do not understand it that's right I believe there's many preachers in the Pulpit who haven't experienced it exactly can I tell you that because if they've experienced it they could you know like I said this morning if a woman says she's got the Holy Ghost and cut her hair remember Graham said the Holy Ghost will let you touch your ear sister that's right so if you got the Holy Ghost how can you spread a strange Doctrine out there because if you got the Holy Ghost in you it would he wouldn't let you do that and so when you see these ministers and I see it many places who come up with these strange doctrines as you one thing comes to my mind no numeration how could a preacher actually teach polygamy when brother Bram said and the seed is not air with the shuck polygamy is actually adultery right exactly is that right so we know you can't be an adulterous woman and be married to Jesus Christ but yet they'll preach a Doctrine like that and spare it out on the congregation so it pretty well identifies who they are so you know but I've been preaching a little series out of invisible Union I usually don't go somewhere else and in the middle of what I've I'm not even through at the series yet what I've decided to do is take the book of Corinthians both books and Minister on it and I really believe if you look at the books in Corinthians first and second you know brother Graham said Redemption is two parts right out of and into go look at First Corinthians and second Corinthians just bringing them out of and into it okay and it's a separation is what it is there's what a lot of people in the message of our have not come to as a separation so what I want to title this sermon tonight is a water of separation and put a friend there and I'm going to put a sacred trust right and if you lead an invisible Union brother Branham talked about a sacred trust that every woman is endowed with did you know that and a woman types the church we know that brother random said that is that correct so as a church God has given you a sacred trust is what he has given you and his expectation is that you're going to keep that trust does everybody agree with that and brother random when he talked to about the women see God gave the women and I'm going to be kind of playing Avail is that right and God expects you to keep that Veil right until you're married does everybody understand that so and Eve in the garden God entrusted her with a holy Veil right is that right but what happened was she traded that Holy Veil for a lust that this is what started us on the road of where we're at in this house that we're in right right so I just want to kind of talk about that tonight if I may if you would let's go to uh Romans 7 and 1. if you would I'm gonna read it out of the invisible Union can I amen you know brother Ram said this was his Thanksgiving message kind of an odd one don't you think but this was absolutely brother branham's Thanksgiving meeting let's see the date on it and this is way down the line he's just about off the scene here 65 11 and 25. this was brother Ram's last Thanksgiving message that he gave right that's right kind of odd to preach it out of Romans 7 1 don't you think let's read know ye not brethren okay for I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband right so then if while her husband liveth she is married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be joined or should be married to another even to him who is risen from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under God for when we were in the flesh motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death right but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter that's about our heads dear heavenly father we pray that you'll Quicken your word to us O Father Lord we love you with it with every fiber of our being oh God and we pray now Lord that you'll come on the same we know you're here Lord because we brought you here be with us now break the words of eternal life to us and we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated you know I was reading this uh book here the other day I started reading it after I'd done the the uh series on the Feast of uh or the statue of a perfect man I'd actually did the feast days went through them then I did a stature of a perfect man and then I I had a bunch of books there that I'd gotten out I thought I'm gonna go to 65 and read some there you know and I can't this book kept shuffling to the top and how I kept getting there I don't know and I was sitting there in my chair one day and I said well there it is again and I thought maybe the Lord's just you know and I don't believe in Ouija boards by the way okay I don't do that but this kept coming to the top and I said well Lord I said well I'll just read the book and if you've got something you want me to bring the people of course we read a book and we've got two messages right but if there's something that you want me to get to the church right now then you break it for me and then I'll Minister on that and I thought well I'll Minister one service well then I ministered two three four I'm up to five now and I've actually gone through a series and like I and like I say I'm going through the booker Corinthians and I don't know if you understand Corinthians or not the Church of Corinth is actually a Greek Church did you know that the Corinth church is 50 miles from Athens is where it's at to the West it was a city that was on an isthmus they call it which is a land bridge between the peloponnese and between the main uh land of Greece so Sailors would come in there and what they didn't want to do they didn't want to sell around these peloponnese islands because there's hundreds of them it made their Journey like 200 miles out into rough seas and they'd have to come down to back around to deliver their cargo so what they do they come up to Corinth they would unload their ships and then they go load them on another ship to complete the journey so they wouldn't have to make that 200 mile circle through rough Seas is the way they did it but to just let you know Corinth the Church of Corinth was founded by Paul does everybody understand that the Church of Corinth was founded by Paul so and then the Church of Ephesus we know he was a pastor over there right we know you know he was a church age Messenger to Ephesus Paul so he was he actually started the Ephesus Church he started the Corinthian Church and it was five years before the the the the books of Corinthians were written that Paul established them now we know that when Paul established the church he put him on the faith right I mean that's what Paul that was his part of faith I told the church if you think Paul didn't have faith he took 195 Stripes he was thrown over a long left for dead you better have some faith if you're going to go through that is that right so Paul lived his message of the hour Paul expressed faith if there's ever a man that showed faith that was Paul and he was a master builder he laid a platform is that right and you better watch how you lay on that so if you come and preach marriage and divorce any other way than what Paul preached it right you're cursed with the curse I had a man one time a preacher tell me and brother Wade he kind of laughs because sometimes we're on the telephone I had a preacher call me one time and he said well I want to come minister before yeah so that's I said and I asked him this I said you know and I'm like brother brother Samuel is a if you're an evangelist you better have a pastor or don't call me because if you can't stand under a Ministry I don't want you coming administering you understand it shows that you don't have leadership or you can't set it under a five-fold Ministry if you're an evangelist you need to have a home Church does everybody agree to that that's my number one rule for them number two you better be living this thing right and I asked him are you qualified well I learned to quit asking them if they're qualified because with their definition of qualified is and what the messages definition of qualified is is two different things and I asked him Point Blank I said are you called qualified he said well yes brother I'm qualified I said fine then come on I wrote him in on the day okay a week later I got a call from a brother that said you know this guy's in second marriage I said what I said I asked him if he was qualified he said yes so I called him up I said brother you know I asked you I thought how plain how much player could I be I guess you got to ask them are you double married so now I got to where I do that I thought you know you learn as you go when you're a pastor right right it's OJT it's on the job training when you're a pastor you hit all sorts of circumstances it's like wow now what do I do Lord help me that's what you do you get in prayer don't you and you say God here's a situation you guide me through it and he always does but anyway this guy man called preacher so I told him I invite him out and he told me when I told him I said oh brother you're double married I said I asked you if you were qualified he said but I am he said you need to go read marriage and divorce brother Branham brother Brandon changed that I said yeah brother I'm sorry but I don't quite get what you're getting at you know he said oh yeah brother Brandon yeah brother Brown made that clear he changed that he said you need to go read it because you know brother Brandon said we're going to have the same message and we are all right the trouble is when he was talking to me he let me know I was out because I didn't believe it just like he did that I that I didn't have the message he had the message right so anyway I went and I said I'll tell you what brother I promise you I'll read marriage and divorce and I'll call you back I read it two days later I called him back I said brother I don't get it I'm sorry I've read it and I said brother Brandon never changed the qualification right for the five-fold men do you agree he never changed that now what he did was he gave Grace to those out here and I told our church and I shouldn't say this because it almost they'll take you up on it yeah I told him I said I don't care if you've been married 18 times it's what I tell them it's kind of scary I really do care I was just trying to show him you know that God can forgive you for that amen for marriage and divorce we have the answer for it right when this message comes wherever you're at you remain as you are right right is that what he says you can't go out there divorcing it marrying and divorcing and marrying and nonsense has to stop right is that right is it nonsense has to stop it really does see I don't believe in really divorcement I believe in a death right because if you divorce somebody you bring them back for the occasion that's right is that right so the new birth ain't a divorce you understand I don't believe in Two Souls does everybody understand that because if you believe that then you believe in divorce right because you can bring the old man back anytime you want and a lot of them who believe that do right is that right usually they'll go out and get him another wife and she's always younger well yeah my pastor brother just said you know they they want if they want to do polygamy like Sarah and Abraham did let Sarah pick their wife he said I'd pick about a 400 pounder about a 60-something-year-old lady and say there you go you want to do polygamy you go duplicate look at these stuff will stop there right we'll double out getting my teenagers what they'll do right so I mean they are they don't even practice it right if you're gonna do it do it like Sarah and Abraham did it right don't do it okay like I told you the story polygamy is actually adultery can we just call it what it is for we're not wondering now or somewhere compared into a rest we've got the answers right we have the answers the people of the message are now right but what I wanted to tell you was he had marriage and divorce so messed up I said well brother I can't bring you in here like that and so I just I just had to race him off my calendar sometimes brother Wade will call me and I'll tease him I go hear this I'm scratching him off my calendar you know so medium's got in an entire joke about it but you know hey you know if you mess up around me and you're a pastor I'm gonna go you understand because I believe you ought to be qualified to minister the gospel it's kind of like brother Howard Carroll said and I really like what he says he said if you've got on and meet him or me and my wife's gonna fly out and the guy the pilot sitting there was shaking my hands and said I'm not qualified to fly this jet would you stay on the jam now I guarantee I'd kick the windows out to get out of that yeah so you're going to get on a plane that this man's supposed to take you up here you understand he's going to fly you out of here because you can't go as high as your pastor did you know that and he ain't even qualified to fly the plane you got to be kidding me right exactly is that right so there's some things you know marriage and divorce brother Brandon preaching Romans but we have to understand that in order for a union to take place there has to be a separation right a water of Separation does everybody understand that something the old Nature has to to die do you agree with that the rule of a resurrection is without a death there is no Resurrection so something has to die and you talked about it this morning me and you that old adamic nature that you were born with and that adamic nature is from the earth it was a lust Veil that was put on you is that right amen that's what it was you were born under a lust Bell Brother Brad said your mother was he was eat Trinidad sure was because you were born in sin shaping iniquity come forth speaking lies is that right and once lust is is conceived at bringeth forth sin once sin is conceived and bring it forth death you understand so that's why you have to be born again if you're not born again you have not passed from Death to life right so invisible Union is all about a separation is what it is and the old man cannot be alive does everybody understand that if that old nature is not dead then you are not married to Jesus Christ because Spencer says if you have two living husbands you shall be called an adulteress amen an ill-fame woman does everybody understand that you are not be the bridal Jesus Christ if you've got a living husband right because everybody understand that so brother random in The Invisible Union what's he telling us again new birth right amen amen statue of a perfect man New Birth almost through 16 360 freeways showing us what the new birth was it's like I tell people if you can't agree on anything else you agree on one thing something has to die all right something has to die and Christ has to be formed within you is that right there has to be a death that's the rule of Resurrection so as low as we understand that we're going to get somewhere now is that right so what we have to do and I'm going to explain to you brother Brandon said this was his Thanksgiving message is that right let me read a quote to you Hey Brother Branham I think you know he'll go on for a while then all of a sudden he says I haven't even got to my Thanksgiving message yet is that what he said listen to what he said you may say what's this all got to do with Thanksgiving it is pretty strange isn't it Romans 7 1 right yeah seems like a strange Thanksgiving message but no it's not he did right on constantly these little when you see these little stories that's right and these little uh Parables that he's talking about in a book go back and look at the title again I constantly when I read it I say now this is the book what does this have to do with that if you'll keep going back and forth don't try to interpret it just let it interpret itself you'll see that that little Parable that he was bringing forth has everything to do with that title is that right amen it does it go look at it and really ask God to give you the revelation of it and you'll see that those Parables hooked right up with what's talking in okay but listen you may say what's this all got to do at Thanksgiving what are you talking about brother Branham here it is quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their Newfound way of life a new life can I say it that way right right they left their own life and they came over to their new life does everybody agree with that at their old church of England where they couldn't Worship in spirit and in truth is right right they were so organized they couldn't worship the way they wanted to worship so what did they do they crossed over the water right amen into the new land the new life because everybody understand so what's rather than talking about water of Separation it's a water of separation is that right what is the water the word right that's the only thing going to separate you from your old life to your new life amen does everybody understand you're going to have to have the water the washing of the Water by the word is what's going to take you from your old life to your new life is that right and once you come over you ain't going back does everybody under saying that once you come to the new life you're not going to go back into the world of sin right so you can't have the old man and the new man does everybody understand this guy is gone there's a separation you know separation means death right if you look at the word change means that there's so many things like I say the rule of Resurrection is death right so you have to understand something has to die in order for Christ to be born in you is that okay the Pilgrim problems we're very thankful for their Newfound way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creed they could marry to the new anointed anointed right they can marry to the new anointed the anointed word for this day right can I tell you that word for their age see Luther was married to the word of his age is that right he was he was he absolutely preached justification it was the message of the hour he was absolutely adjoined to that is that right it was the truth for that day so what what are we absolutely joined to is the word for our hour is that right and new anointed word of their age for their day see I'm not live I'm not eating on some old dead carry-on right is that what he said right I'm not eating on a a Mana for another day this is Mana that fell in our day so I've got eaten on carry-on I'm eating on the unfailing Bodywork of the son of man amen is that right that's what I'm eating on so can we be thankful as pilgrims Abraham was a pilgrim wasn't he did God separate Abraham God separated him didn't he he told Abraham said Abraham you get away from your kin folks son you come on out here I want you Abraham you get out here with me is that what he's saying you know he said separate yourself from your kinfolks really he brought him with him he didn't do God never blessed him until he fighted did he he never really blessed Abraham until he got away from his old daddy his old daddy brought Idols over did you know that a lot of worshiper He's a fly in the ointment his old daddy died out now he was getting somewhere then he had to a lot of him where they gave her they argued all the time so he had to separate himself from lot once he did that now God right to start blessing Abraham is that right now he could become the world made flesh the this right right we talked about it Melchizedek the word made flesh could now come to him right is that right couldn't do that until he had a separation you got to separate do you understand that all right you can't have two living husbands expect to be joined to Jesus Christ forget it it'll work that way we understand it right so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all of our Associates yo young people this is what I see one of the biggest problem in young people is they want the message of the hour but they won't separate themselves from their own friends right now I'm going to tell you if God could not bless Abraham until he separated he will not bless you till you separate because that old friend if he's got fleas you're gonna get fleas you understand now that's the truth whoever you run with that's the influence brother Brandon preached the message influence of another until Abraham come out from under the influence of another and God under the influence of Melchizedek that voice that he heard is that right then God could bless him at that point does everybody understand Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all dead religions right I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what separated us been open to us a new land a new message for this day for this day right okay now brother Brandon before he read Romans 7 1 I want you to see what he says it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it really isn't to me it's a prophecy amen a prophecy for the church in the last day so this message of invisible Union is a prophecy is that right and I'm going to tell you you must be born again was never preached after Jesus preached it until this day by our Prophet does everybody understand that you show me where Luther Wesley go look at their writings you won't find where they use the title ye must be born again I think it was one of the Mysteries they didn't understand don't you they knew they had to be saved they couldn't explain it we can explain it next day we can explain what died this day if you understand is that right and so for you in order for you to be married to Jesus Christ that death has to come to that old nature does everybody agree with what I'm saying now that's what he said now I want to go back to the Old Testament okay and I think brother Wayne almost got on it last night I told him you need to be still his mama wouldn't even talk I wanted him to be still because he was hitting what I was going to preach I thought if he takes my fire I'm gonna be mad you know what I mean but that's okay I know and he about got on it I said oh boy I wish you'd be still man because I really believe one of the biggest problems around the message of the hour is there's many many many many many people with no new birth right right and we don't want to make it through such a mystery to you do you realize everything that you receive is a gift from God if you go in the book of adoption and that's the final State isn't it adoption that's it it's where your words are his words whatever you say it'll be that way you sign the checkbook he'll cash it you write the check right now that's what full adoption is it really is so you go in the adoption book you watch how brother Brown does it he preaches Saint John 3 16. and God gave His only begotten son so it's a gift does everybody agree you're right then he said he gave some gifts everybody following me then he said he gave some Apostles right I read that this morning there's a gift amen then he said he gave you the Holy Ghost what is it you got that God didn't give you right is there anything you've done to deserve it there's only one thing you can do exactly accept it Daniel 70 weeks a pardon is not a party unless it's accepted you know why we don't have more gifts working in the church people won't accept it right is that right accept it I tell the church I said I taught on all the gifts and gifts is just like this pyramid in my opinion Brethren didn't say as I said it but I can see it see that pyramid there I do this and what the the least of the gifts are speaking in tongues the interpretation right we know that God the restoration of the gifts is that was the Pentecost God restored this speaking in tongues does everybody agree with that put the cabbage down they denominated they died right there that didn't stop God one bit did it you didn't stop God one bit now we're going to go beyond that Beyond organization does anybody agree with that now we're not going to do away with the benign spiritual gifts but when I said you do away with an I am spiritual gifts you're living in a delusion the church is living an illusion right so we believe in the nine spiritual gifts so it comes up right one of them is knowledge does everybody believe in knowledge I think you ought to be an expert in the word don't you exactly it's a gift Glory it's a gift that God gives you these things you understand so you come up the gift of discernment right not like brother Branham had right now there's only one of those gifts per generation is that what he's saying well you know what the gift of German is to be able to judge right you know we'll sit here in a congregation we'll say I can't judge that brother you're the only one that can right that's right who are you kidding right see people around the message I said oh you can't judge him really you mean you got the Holy Ghost In You remember it's a judgment seat we see with blood on it it's a mercy say you mean to tell me I can't judge a matter in the church isn't that what Paul got on to the Corinthians form he said you'll take a brother to law you've got to be kidding me you're supposed to have these nine spiritual gifts working in your midst and you're taking a brother to court no you're supposed to have the gift of discernment it's where you can judge a matter is that right matter of fact take the person in this congregation that's the least esteemed among you not the greatest the least esteemed among you set them down in a chair you tell them your side they tell them their side lay it all out that person ought to be able to discern that that gift of discernment should be working in every local assembly is that right right so God's Building this thing up okay the gifts you the last thing he brings wisdom right wisdom is that right you know what come down in 1963. wisdom thank you all right now I'm gonna ask you what was the first message before brother random preached the seals what was the title of it God in Simplicity I told the church if I was going to use one word to say what Simplicity or what wisdom is it's Simplicity right exactly is that right because remember in the Corinthians Paul had to constantly correct these Corinthians brother Adam preached the message Corinthians book of Correction now book of correction he didn't correct them because he didn't like them right and he just wanted to look up on him all the time he put the book he loved them Paul loved them Paul established this church he wanted to see him move up and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost is really what Paul wanted is that right he did preach it again or beat him down he's trying to get the nonsense out of the church the Washington that's what he wanted to get he wanted he want to do separate him from their own life that old damning nature that old sin is what he wanted to get out of your life is that right amen that's exactly what he wanted to do that's what brother Brandon was talking about the invisible Union right you have to separate yourself from that if you're sin you're still a sinner right exactly John just tell you that don't say you I get more people in my church they'll say I believe and they think that's it good Baptist Doctrine isn't that what it is well they said burn that before you come over into this just because just just trembles the devil believes this entire message did you know that's very most creatures I know right he's way ahead of the curve the devil right he believes every doctrine of this message of the hour and he trembles like I say that's pretty well beats most preachers on that right is that right so just because you say I believe the message is not it you have to have a separation the old fellas got to be dead that old nature that old nature it was a damning nature and it strived after the world of things the world can I tell you that that thing has to be dead d-e-a-d everybody understands and if it's no you are an adulteress right right isn't that what's happened over there in Revelation 7 said she was an adulteress right why because she takes the name of Christ says she's married to Christ and yet she's married to the world and the things of the world she's got her own wine her own Revelation that she hands out is that right now that's what she does now if you've got your own Revelation then you're nothing but an adulteress you understand what I'm saying so like I said you better not hand out any wine or your wine you better have his wine is that right but Revelation to the message of the hour because if you know you're just like that Harlot that's missing in Revelations no different is that right why she hadn't come to the New Birth is why exactly exactly right man and that's where the big failure around the message of the hour is is New Birth right no new birth that's right if you get a new birth you're going to get yourself right with God exactly amen okay and I don't care what you say your mouth can tell me all it wants to I believe the message you go to Ezekiel 36 what I was talking about when he said ye must be born again you look at the last scripture said and you do it right and do it ain't that the last words comma and do it if you don't do it you don't believe it it's that simple so I don't care if you were born in a message church if you do not occurred you're not there yet right amen okay now I'm not gonna give up on you all right Paul didn't give up on the Church of Corinth and I won't give up on people in my church either that's right but I have many of them to say I believe and I'll see about smoking a cigarette you got to be kidding me there has to come a separation do you understand what I'm saying you have to separate from unbelief bitter and sweet does not come from the same Fountain right now I'm telling you we're down here at the very end of the end and we need to quit kidding ourselves if you don't have a new birth in this church it's easy right just accept it exactly it's so simple you can't believe it is that right but it's foolishness to your coconut right to your intellect it's foolishness because it's too simple right yeah if that asked you a hard day you'd go do it right right but if I tell you to go dip in the river seven times and that Almighty Jordan you got to be there's a lot clearer Rivers down here in Syria let's go there no that's not what he said he said dip in Jordan right death right right you gotta be separated does everybody understand that so your whole new life is based on separation right does everybody agree with that now do you understand I'm not going to read the scripture I could but I I won't have time does everybody understand the water of Separation in the Old Testament that's right the Old Testament if you were in the church and you were a brethren you say I believe the message and then you go out and sin in the world before you come back into the congregation of the righteous you had to be cleansed in that water of Separation now do you know what went in that water right there was one when it was hissa that I talked about this morning does everybody understand that kiss up Cedar was the third one help me and Scarlett thank you I remember that so you got hyssa which is faith he's got to go in the water the word right if you don't have if Faith's not in the word you can forget it you don't get the separation is that right and again the same rule that I told you in the Passover was in the water of Separation you didn't take part of the hyssop and put it in there right when you burn it with the ashes of the red heifer is that right so I took the red heifer too so you had to take the whole Revelation the whole Faith right and you put it in and burn it with the red heifer right remember he said Lord I come in a volume of book he's the red heifer is that right Christ is the red heifer so for Waters of Separation they had a red heifer that was perfect right is that right a perfect absolutely perfect specimen of a red effort so they would slay that heifer they take it outside of the can and burn it is that right they had to have cedar cedar the wood Cedar is red and white right but they said the red is for the blood the white is for righteousness is that right so they put that on it then they put in the hyssop that I told you then they put the Scarlet but it was Lamb's wool right so it's Lamb's wool it's Scarlet brother Raven said that was Redemption sure and that went in there doesn't that pretty well tell you everything that's in the water of Separation right right so you gotta have all those things to actually have the water of Separation so when you go out in the world and you get the world of things in the world before you could come back into the congregation of Israel you had to have the water of does everybody understand that because you would absolutely if you brought suit in the camp then what happens is let me just be honest with you you bring adultery in that back door and you call yourself a brother yeah they were an Israelite is that right you call yourself a brother that you believe this message and you bring adultery in the back of that church there's going to be a preacher to take care of that that's right and I'm going to read that scripture for you in just a minute okay but the water of Separation you went out in the world and with that water of Separation what you could do is now you could come into the congregation of the righteous and worship with them exactly is that right until you did the water it even if you were a stranger a stranger you could do the water of separation and come into the congregation is that right but you had to have the water of Separation to do it exactly is that right the word isn't it the washing of the Water by the word amen you had to have it you've got to have the word do you understand you have to what's the Holy Spirit going to anoint his word all right man you ain't got no word in you and you say you got the Holy Ghost you got to be kidding amen right the only thing he can anoint is his word is that right that's the purpose of the holy spirit is to anoint his word and make it come to pass in you right it's you're written Epistles written red of all men is that right you're living like I said you're a dwelling Tabernacle of God right if you ain't got no word in your house God's Gonna Know It God ain't gonna anoint that right he's got to anoint the word is that everybody agrees with that it's every Baptist Church in America today is going to read the word is that right yeah man but it's not life-giving right they don't have the Holy Spirit to anoint it they don't have a message to do like the life for this day they don't have that to anoint it and bring it up do you understand what I'm saying and that's what brother invisible Union was what is it it starts with the new birth you don't have a new birth no Union exactly it's what it is okay that's right now I'm gonna read a scripture to you real quick if I can hold on numbers 25 and 6 if you want to turn here I want you to hear that so this is going to get rough on some of your toes I promise you when I get through you're gonna get scanned so I'm just warning you up front get ready take a deep breath don't get nervous that's the way I preach man when I preach I preach okay I know you do too I've heard brother Wade so I don't have to wonder what you guys preach too and behold one of the children of Israel now this wasn't an unbeliever folks this was one of the children of Israel do you understand could I say a message believer would that give you more understanding right came and brought into his brethren a medianized woman in a sight of Moses here's this guy this Jew this Israelite goes out and gets a strange woman and brings him right into the congregation of the righteous and he didn't go through the water of Separation now if they'd done the law right right is that right they'd have been okay but they didn't do that they didn't go to the war of the word so this brother thought he could go out and get him a strange woman bring it into the congregation of the righteous and everything would be okay not a good idea you understand now listen to what happened a median ice won't decided mode and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel and listen to this who were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation they were in church he brought it here they were in worship crying at the door of the congregation and he brought this strange woman in yeah is that Brazen yeah do you know the devil when he was in Hammond exalted himself up and get up against Michael is that Brazen you know what job when he said he walked up there didn't the devil walk right before the sons of God right before the throne he said hey he said what do you think about my servant job it's when you got a hedge around him man I can't get it to him take the heads down and I'll get him to curse you to your face but the point I want to make is the devil went right up to the throne of God did he not right you talk about Brazen there's people that say they believe the message is our they'll go out in the world and get him a strange woman with this message says don't you marry an unbeliever under no circumstance if you really believe this message of the hour you will not go out there and get you a strange woman does everybody understand this is going to be tough but I'm going to tell you you're not supposed to do that you're not now listen to what happened to this guy and when Phineas does anybody ever look up the name Phineas what that means it means brass mouth can I tell you what it means mouth of brass you got it I heard you chuckle I know you got it so what was it judgment right right you know where judgment comes from all right Phineas he was a son of a high priest he was a priest is what he was and he's seen that thing going on he knew they didn't fulfill the law right he wasn't going to let him get by was he this guy ain't gonna let you get by either you understand what I'm saying you go out there in the world and you pull those things off Phineas is going to come after you if you're a pastor a true Pastor you're not going to let adulter Spirit come in your congregation and drag your people out is that right because he's a shepherd and he's going to take care of his sheep does everybody understand that so what did he do Phineas a priest now I want to tell you something there were other priests there oh yeah why didn't they do anything exactly makes you wonder don't it he wasn't the only priest there why didn't they do something right right I've seen it in message churches they'll let that stuff go on Elite your church up it's like a cancer you can't let those things you can't let the world of things the world come into your congregation and not be a Phineas and kill that thing right it sounds tough don't it oh yeah but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into some real detail with you here in a minute I'm using one example and then I'm going to get real ABC with you and break down the real simple part of this message where I believe the failure is coming from you understand where I believe the failure of this this around this message the message will fail this message I got is perfect you understand but that devil will walk right up in front of this he's he ain't got no he don't care he's Brazen in there he'll walk up before God I guarantee you he'll walk up before me in a congregation right right so phidius the son of Eliezer the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation so he was a priest he lived among the congregation is that what I said this morning that's what a pastor he lives among you he 'll put up with that nonsense and took a job to Japan and he went after the man of Israel into the tent this is the tent do you agree yeah this is the Ten right right see I'm not worried against flesh and blood right does everybody hear it was Flesh and Blood it was a shadow of things to come right is that right I'm not fighting against flesh and blood I'm fighting against the spirit of that thing I'm not going to let that Spirit come into my congregation and have a bunch of that get off on a bunch of people is that right see we can't allow that to happen what did he slay his enemies with a flaming sword where did it come from his mouth right it's a mouth of judgment do you understand so the pastor is not going to let things come into this congregation and not take care of it that's what we're supposed to do if you're a true Pastor you're going to take care of that thing in a hurry because you're not going to let get off on somebody else right is that right and he went after the man of Israel message believer man of Israel right he said he believed the message into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague the plague was stayed from the children of Israel right is that right it's exactly right now then let's go to the book of Corinthians the first chapter this is what got me onto the message that I've been preaching for a while here let's go to Corinthians I said right not know it's everywhere again does anybody know what the word Corinth means it means ornaments glitter they had the glitter but they didn't have the glow does everybody understand brother bran said you got the glow not the glitter of Hollywood right the Church of Corinth if you look at the characteristics of the Church of Christ it's identical to the the spirit of laodicea it is absolutely this is what I did in our church and I'm going to do it now so you'll understand now it's the Church of Corinth or the Church of Ephesus I'm gonna draw a line and too bad you're on the left you know it's the Sheep on the right go to the left you just don't you just have to be on the wrong side but you can move up when I get through maybe all of you'll be sitting over here okay that's really what we want as a pastor isn't it we want all of you to be just like the Ephesian church to where you can take adoption where you take predestination where we can move you up into the statue of a per that's adoption up there is that right that's adoption at the very top there that's what we're taking you to that fivefold Ministry is that right exactly Statue of Liberty right there by giving you the word right that's where how we're going to get you there right let's go to Corinthians 1 and 1. Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sauce to these our brother unto the Church of God so he calls them a church right right he don't refer to these guys as bright yet yet okay now listen I wanted to get you how he really looks at these Corinthians which is that Korean to them that are Sanctified remember what you said last night brother so you guys been preaching the same thing I've been preaching it ain't no different I can't preach a different message Than You Preach right right I preach the same message you preach I preach the same message you preach the fivefold ministry is saying the same thing is that right I'll read it to you in a minute okay I'm back at up here shortly Sanctified I said their behavior was what was in question see what he had done when Paul got there Paul got him to justification Paul got into sanctification you know now brother random said Paul got him to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had to leave him like Billy Graham did 30 000 would come up say make their confession brother random said Billy Paul preached justification did he Billy Graham did I say Billy Paul Billy Graham thank you my wife always corrects me I love it it don't bother me it don't matter who cracks me I love correction amen do you understand I love correction you really do if you're one of his you'll take correction see God don't correct the devil's youngins right he corrects his youngins is what he does okay it says their behavior was what was in question I got after I said Sanctified because sanctification is your behavior did you know that you're right is that right right it's behaving out here is because you ain't got something right in there right and that's what Paul was saying Boys you ain't got the baptism the Holy Ghost because if you had the baptism all the ghost you wouldn't be pulling these things right so what's he do he's going to take them back now he's gonna put him right back and establish them again and bring him up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's the way Paul did it that's why brother I'm sitting here right to separate from Prophet things and dedicate to God to consecrate so if you ain't been separated then you don't have the water of Separation right you don't have the new birth does everybody understand that amen if you're still sinning it's because you're a sinner let's just be bold okay I'm gonna say some things that's going to kind of got to put your hair on in here a little later I'm building up to it but these things need to be preached because there's a lot of people in the message of hour sitting in churches have been told you believe the message of the hour recognizing your day in the faith when you receive your message of the hour that's it you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost no if you've got the baptism you'll do it right so if you're you've got one quote you're not living under it yeah you're in deep trouble right right we're at the end of this thing now you better start checking up brother man said you better be prayed up check it up every hour every minute of the day to make sure you're right where you need to be because we're fixing to take a Rapture of body change does everybody understand so you better be sure that you're under your messenger and the message and the messenger one right so that's what you need to if you have the separation and it separated you from unbelief you'll be under your messenger but we have people all over the place 90 of the people say they're mentioned and they say they believe it and they don't have the separation because they're not I can see it they're not under the man is that right in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place called upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto you see Paul was a Grace preacher right the law and the prophets were until John since John come we preach Christ exactly is that right because if you preach Grace Grace will put you under the law you understand what I'm saying you'll fulfill the law can I say it Jesus didn't do away with all he fulfilled it right the Old Testament still works today Thou shalt not commit adultery now there's some preachers don't believe that but it still applies today does everybody understand right Grace be unto you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which has given you by Jesus Christ gift right everything look at the scripture every time it says gave given what is it that you've worked for nothing right it's gift everything's a gift just accept it accept salvation accept your gifts accept it just accept everything that God given you if God says this is you then why can't you accept it right he gave it to you just accept what he gave you right he gave you your healing just accept it like I said this morning ask God tell him what you need and then thank him for it just say thank you Lord and thank any foreign and now what Thanksgiving is exactly Thanksgiving thanks for giving me something right that's what that's what Thanksgiving is all about just thank God for what he already did for you all right that in everything you're enriched by Him in all utterance now I want you to listen to this these Corinthians that in everything ye are enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge right now they knew the message of the hour they knew what Paul preached them that's what's happened around the message there they know the message of the hour and they can even utter it right they knew it they could speak it but they lived none of them right does everybody understand where we're going with Corinthians that's what you said last night brother Wade see they say he said they were Sanctified dangerous like brother Wade said it and I thought boy you got that right big boy he said when you're Sanctified you're on Dangerous Ground right you are you're just like the Corinthians were if you stay in that Sanctified realm you can fall off there you understand and that's where they were they could they knew the message of the hour they knew the quotes I can remember my pastor who used to tell them the color of the book The volume number the page number at the bottom of the left hand when you I told him one day I said you're not learning that for me because you can clothe it and the Holy Ghost In Me will amen right what you're learning that for is to argue with a bunch of preachers is that who you got to prove it to him he's a Moses who gave him problems on marriage and Wars the 70 preachers that came to him the brother man say it was the preachers that got married to divorced all messed up there's where your problem lies today it's the preachers who ain't got a new birth can I say it that way they ain't got a new birth they can't keep it straight but if you ain't got a good new birth you're not going to live it and you're dead you're going to preach me a sermon aren't you that's right that's the problem look at them some of them polygamist you got to be that's the new birth no no it's proof to me there's something a lot of preachers yeah I'm not down enough I'm drawing a line say okay you're over here with the Corinthians now get over here with the officials Paul didn't give up on them you understand he didn't give up on the Church of Corinth he said you where what I'm going to do is I'm correct you give them some love yeah and that wasn't Brotherhood said love is corrective correction is love right so what do you do he's going to correct the Church of Corinth and get him to move over here move them up so they'll come to the Church of Ephesians and they'll be ready to take a Rapture then right so that's what Paul was trying to do with the church of Korean you know what I'm gonna go back to the history for a minute drop back but the Church of Corinth what they said the history of it was the Church of Korean was what it was where the church is supposed to influence the world is that right right that's what you're supposed to do influence the world what happened is the world started influence the Church of Christ and what do they have coming in um exactly I mean go read the stuff they had coming into their Church idolaters does anybody know what brother Brandon said in our daughter was let me tell you what an idolater is it's different what you think you and our daughter is a guy will come sit right in here the message walk right back out and do nothing with it yeah right did you say that's what an eye doctor was so if you want to know that's what the church you could do or they were idolaters and he called them that right they come in they hear a good message does everybody agree they'd walk out and do nothing with it they wouldn't put Flesh on it right right like I said this morning do you understand if this man preaches a word and you get it down in your heart it's going to have Flesh on a thing you're going to Manifest this message of the highway if you don't you're an idolater right right that's pretty tough isn't it just because you come in here doesn't mean you got it right all right because remember Satan walked right up to the throne it didn't bother him one bit right right so just because you come right here to this Tabernacle don't mean you you got to get it on the inside of the inside you got to come to water separation where that old nature that old damning nature gets off of you and then it's Christ that's formed in you it's not me that lives it's Christ in me that liveth is that right that's right and if you've got Christ in you you're going to bring forth fruit all right correct is that right right where would I leave off oh utterance and knowledge and this is the one I told you even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you your testimony is the prophecy confirmed in you does everybody understand that Brethren just didn't preach a message to be to be preaching it brother Adam say this thing to your church he even said Brandon Tabernacle is not my church when he put that in that Cornerstone the Lord told him this is not your church is that what he said brother Brandon was not trying to build a church neither are we trying to build a church any true ministers not trying to build a church we're trying to build a living Tabernacle for a living God is that right that's what we're trying to build here tonight right amen so we have a testimony if you don't have a testimony that prophecy hadn't been made flesh there is that right that's right because the testimony is the result of the prophecy so the preacher remember I said preacher means Prophet would this guy preaches the message if that don't take Flesh on it and you don't bring a testimony forth that absolutely unions with what he said that it shows you don't have a new birth do you understand because it means you got two husbands and you shall be called adulterers right so I just want to make sure you understand just because you said it here doesn't mean you have it that's right so that ye come behind and no gift they had every gift working in the Church of Corinth I want you to know when you go read the book of Corinthians he never corrected their Doctrine one time right do you realize that not one time does Paul corrected her doctorate they had the doctrine right they ought to Paul taught him he established the church you think Paul put him on false Doctrine no Paul put him on the right Doctrine he wasn't correct in their Doctrine he was correct in their lives right they claimed it they spoke it they had argued right why they argue with every preacher in the message right isn't that what we got the problem is a bunch of arguing preachers right you realize that's the problem right that's right brother Rams said when Moses and them were taking their Journey when they stopped and argued with those moabites that's what got him in trouble and God said no fussing right is that right see we're not going to fuss the medicine they want to believe it Go believe it I'm going to tell them the truth and then I'm gonna walk away is what I'm living in you will argue you're gonna find some other preacher to argue with I don't have time to argue I'm on a journey and I'm moving you understand I'm not gonna stop stop and spend my time arguing with some preacher that's right that's the truth so that you come behind a no gift that all the gifts working waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you amen is that right isn't that what this word is sent for to confirm you you is what it is take this thing personal all right amen until the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the worship of the son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I'm going to tell you I'm going to stop here first Corinthians 1 and 10 is the thesis for the entire book of the first to Corinth do you know that anybody and Paul had two phds does everybody know that Paul wrote 13 letters in the Bible Paul was a writer a writer well I was in college they taught us there's three parts anybody in college you're in college oh okay it was I was gonna say well you're alone to be in college we got a guy brother Wayne if you ever meet him he went through the second grade three times so I teased him every once in a while I told him to see God don't deal with your intellect because scripture said a fool need not air therein and why because wisdom is coming it's Simplicity now I don't care if you've got a college education or you can't even say your ABCs that's right because this message was brought in Simplicity for that the common people would receive him gladly so you reading and writing and all that and you're intellect they got one thing to do with it that's what he gave you does everybody understand okay this is the thesis of First Corinthians the book listen to it real close now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing did your Prophet tell you to say what's said on tape all right is that right that's what he said and that there be no divisions among you is that right you're not supposed to have you know this is what the problem was in Creative they'd say summer of Apollos summer of Paul sir Christ and I told the church you know what they're saying if I said well I I go to Brothers to him your nails charged yeah yeah you know what that's going to buy you nothing all right if you say I go to Claude why so you're sure nothing zero you know what's happened to a lot of people around the message of the hour they've caught their pastor's Spirit right and they do it didn't get the Holy Spirit right this man don't want you to get his spirit because if he did you don't be on the same Anchorage climbed up in a tree tomorrow huh so he wants you to get his Spirit he wants to have some hunting land left do you understand so if you get the Spirit of this guy here I guarantee you I'll see you in camo tomorrow all right is that right no we're not supposed to take on the spirit of our pastor but you go into a message church and they hold their Bible like who brother Branham you know what they did they caught the spirit of their Prophet they didn't get the Holy Spirit right I know that sounds tough don't it right but that's what it is a lot of people I believe the message they hold their Bible the same way when they walk right and they want to act like brother Madam well what do they want the spirit of William Branham he didn't tell me to take his Spirit he said you go get the holy spirit so I don't care if you're in Samuel Dale's Church you're in Claude why is there Donnie Reagan whoever you are don't you get your pastor's Spirit you know spirit amen you get you get the okay so that's what he's saying that's what he told the Corinthians didn't he quit that nonsense there ain't no divisions Among Us it's Christ that's all it is there's only one great one Among Us Jesus Christ it ain't saving the only difference in this guy and this guy he's got a ministering gift in his life that's all that's different he's flashing blood just like you do he has the same emotions you do he's got the same gray matter that you do the only difference is he's got a ministering gift in him right it's only there so if you know if you want to thank God for the gift fine but don't exalt the man I tell people our church will come when I come out they say boy brother Claude we really appreciate thank you I know what they're saying but you know what I always tell them thank God don't thank me thank God God's the one who put the gift in there sometimes I'll get my stuff let's see who it's nothing I'll get up I'll go in the other night I ain't got nothing to preach Wednesday isn't that the way we do it right I go oh you know read a book and I'll say bam he'll give me something right is that right then after he gives it to me I'm like you on that line I'll say now I don't want this to be me Lord I want this to be holy spirit I don't want to be called Spirit yeah that's good I like it but Lord is this what you want me to bring to the church so what I start doing is getting myself out of the way I'll even start studying another subject yeah and you know what I'll do I'll study the other subject I'll go book like hitting a brick wall yeah I go okay you don't want me to go there let me try this one all right then that's the way it works for you and then you'll come back and say well and he'll open it up it's like a rush comes in the room right it's just like where brother Brown said when that angel come to him in the room one of the seals he had to stay it up it almost took his breath I can associate with that I've had to get up and walk to the refrigerator sometimes there's such a presence come down in my study you understand because why you hit a vein it's the men where you hit a vein and God said this is what I want you to bring the Tabernacle tonight is that right so the gift is the ministry gift in the man but he had no different use Flesh and Blood just like you are amen so there's no divisions Among Us right but that ye be perfectly joined together remember I said this morning the cements love right that's what's supposed to put us together in the church is love everybody agrees with that right the same mind let this mind that was in Christ being you he wasn't talking about the mind to Paul he was talking about the mind of Christ is that right that let everybody have the same mind the same message the same Christ right and insane judgment amen right yeah see you are supposed to judge something did you know that right you you're going to judge do you realize you're going to judge Angels one day yeah you realize one day you're gonna be sitting there with Jesus Christ judging people that come forward right man and you'll say you know he was good to me when I was on the earth Lord and he said he was he said enter in right whatever you've done to these little these my little ones you've done it unto me you're going to be sitting up there where is The Mercy Seat today by the way when I told you this morning the Tabernacle is a feminist name then let me ask you if that's where the seat of judgment was if that's where the mercy seat was where is it it's in the bride amen is that right exactly sure it's in the bride and you know what there was two things in there over that judgment scene there was Michael and there's Gabriel you know Gabriel is the messenger can I say the message you know what's in my heart the message you know the other thing with her Michael do you know Michael never lost a battle that Michael that Archangel never lost a show it I dare anybody show me the scripture where Michael ever lost a battle amen right Michael cast Lucifer Out of Heaven did he not with Daniel Prayed 21 days right who come and helped him to get him there Michael all right is that right Joshua when you come up to Jericho who was standing there Michael he was walking around taking a look at it and said man it looks tough don't it he knew the battle was won right you got Michael on the scene folks Christ you are a winner I don't care what the devil tells you and that third compartment in your heart is Michael all right is that right man Jesus Christ I hope the glory is in you Michael so I don't care don't let the devil get you down and tell you you're beat down you are not beat down Church you understand that all right you cannot lose how you like that you cannot lose you have Michael in that third compartment and he's never lost a battle amen and he never will right he can't so you look in that third compartment all those things in incense proper prayer right all those things in that is what's in your heart you understand what I'm saying so what's in you is a lot of different things you understand and it's showing you the symbolism of what is actually contained in you and the mercy seats is that right brother random said there not be another one saved when the bride leaves why because The Mercy Seat is going to be gone was that right right amen that's it a lot of people don't understand that but the mercy seat is in the bride and that's what Paul was trying to get to these Corinthians you understand he's got it so you got judgment boys you started using it is that right right now that's exactly what he did now I'm going to tell you something going through I'm just going to be honest with you what we've had in this end time and I see it over and over and over people are coming in Brazen just like Satan is and setting right in the congregation to the the righteous and you're bringing those old nasty Spirits in with you you understand what I'm saying right right now what I've told you this morning brother random said you're the final voice to the final age under your messenger right right now I told you and I want to repeat it look Satan didn't have an exalted himself up against Michael it got him cast out is that right right so if you as a message believer you tell me you believe the message of the hour now I'm going to get tough and itemize a few things so I apologize okay Brother Brad said If he if he wouldn't have a TV he'd blow it out with a shotgun does that mean you're going to have a TV you're going to go above your messenger all right and I'm gonna be just Real playing with you okay you mean you're gonna and I've had people in our church we'll have a get-together and a woman hand me a a a dish and have clear fingernail polish Sean do you find one quote where brother Branham ever said yellow red green he said polish right he said make up on the outside makeup on the inside do you understand what I'm saying I'm gonna get right down with it and the only reason I'm doing it because I said church I want you ready for a Rapture right right that's all of our responsibilities being pastors right and if you don't go take that Javelin and you don't run it right into the spirit of that thing and kill it then you have allowed it to come into your congregation and it will spread does everybody understand that and that's exactly invisible Union it's talking about a separation is that right so if there's people here that separated I don't want to allow the devil to come in amongst the congregation and bring Spirits in here that'll sweep them out do you understand what I'm saying I and you too we're as a pastor and I got a preach a pastor I'm not an evangelist guy so I got to preach what I'm preaching at church when you come to our church do you preach What You Preach here sure you do you told me you do same titles and everything so I can't preach any different than I preach if I do I'll become a hypocrite right did you know that's what Paul said in Corinthians if I come to you and I got to preach what he gave me right and this is what he gave me this is when I go home I want to start right where I pick I live off tonight that's what I'm going to start in our church because I've got down to chapter four of Corinthians but you start taking a look at Corinthians what he's doing he's cleaning up the marriage and divorce situation in the church is that right I mean they had a guy sitting there a a son living with his mama yeah you gotta be kidding me and they they knew it yeah they uttered it but they didn't live it do you understand what I'm saying so the water's a separation when he gets out on the inside of the inside it's going to make everything else on the app it works from the inside out it's going to clean this Rascal up you understand and if you still got the world the things the world hanging on you you're in trouble right I'm gonna be honest we're going to make a Rapture and if if one word threw this thing into what it is does everybody agree right like I said she was behind a holy Veil she walked out and took the lust Veil and look what it brought right now you were born under a lust Veil now you've taken on the word a holy Veil and you know what God has entrusted you with he says it invisible Union a sacred trust what has God given you the word right as long as Eve stayed behind the word she was okay once she walked out from behind that word she took a lust Veil on right and once lust is conceived to bring forth sin what sin is conceived to bring it forth dead now that's the steps of it does everybody understand so water is separation you got to separate from your old life but you got to come under your messenger folks you are not going to live higher than what William Branham is that right so I see people I see it all over where they wear the clear fingernail polish why can you guys help me out and tell me why when brother Ram said nail polish right he didn't say the color so I guess it's like remember the stagecoach driver brother Brandon talked about there was one to get real close to the edge right he said and that King said I don't want to ride in your Stagecoach you think Jesus Christ wants to ride in you yeah and you're as close to the edge as you can get no what you're going to do is the stagecoach is going to get close to the mountain as you can get right is that right so you're running around on the edge you think he's going to be sitting in your Stagecoach I'm going to tell you no he's not going to do that and I sure wouldn't ride in your stage coach either but as a Phineas mouth of brass the five full ministry has to go out there and kill those Spirits you understand that's right you can't think that you can go out there because your messenger already told you these things you come into the congregation and you call yourself a brethren in other words you're saying I believe the message right Brethren that's what he was they were crying and worshiping in the congregation and he brought that strange woman right amongst them do you think you're going to get away with that right no I'm sorry man that preacher is going to preach that message he's going to kill the spirit of that thing if you can stand it okay everybody understand but he's going to preach it right because that's our duty is being a pastor it really is so invisible Union Brethren was talking about a water separation is that right he's talking about the new birth right right we're gonna let these things happen in the church and just keep on and keep on and keep on I've got a book at home that's a red book about this thick that talks about television did you know that Ramen in one place he said television yeah right do you not believe that right and you know I where I work in the office they got a TV and a break room I can sit there there's not a fit commercial anymore you know I the people tell me they say brother Claude well I got one just for the weather I said really I said why don't you get away Oklahoma weather Rock and they say what's that I said you put it out under a tree and you go outside and you feel of it if it's wet it's raining if you feel of it and it's cold it's cold if you feel of it and it's hot the Sun's shining I know that sounds funny don't it that's right but it's a core excuse to have a TV you better clean your house up you understand what I'm saying brother rib said you're supposed to apply the token the token is the life does everybody understand that if brother Brandon preached against it then what do you think you could bring it in your house and get by with it right now I'm just going to be honest with you I know I don't get preached a lot of places but I'm going to preach it that's right my preach it at our church too and you know why I hate TV because if you put one in front of me I will watch it right that's right what's you don't tip me with that thing I think it's like a magnet man you'll be a turtle a man don't have I mean commercials anymore Phil fell on it right is that right me and my wife one day there's a Mexican restaurant just to be blunt about it we were sitting there and had the TV on the corner we're slapping each other eating pretty soon this man and woman got up there's a BBD commercial show them in her underwear I like to have a heart attack I couldn't believe it I said you got to be kidding me is that right that's what's on TV a commercial so if you're watching the news you're going to get some of those commercials you understand what I'm saying right I mean Bittersweet don't come from the same Fountain you better get away from that thing I don't like I say I know it don't go down good I know it there's a lot of people still smoking right not good enough you better separate from those things don't bring yourself into a congregation say I'll believe the message and you're pulling those things off we're out here at the end time now you better get yourself separated you better get the new birth is what you better get because this thing is soon to end does everybody understand that okay it's the truth I know it's hard but go look at what he's saying invisible union he said it's a sacred trust that he gave you God gave you this message of the hour a sacred trust and he expects you to keep that Veil right does everybody understand brother Ram said that woman is entrusted with that Veil right right you sisters have something very very special I'm going to tell you that God entrusted that to you amen amen and your responsibility is to keep it and we're the woman's a type of the church and he has given us a holy Bell in this end time amen and his expectation is you're going to keep it right so you're either living one of the other all right you're either living behind a holy Veil or a lust fail right there's no difference you understand what I'm saying right right you're either in the Church of Corinth and you know brother Branham half of his messages he had to correct people the other half he could preach the Revelation and bring him up is that right brother random he said I teach preach what Paul preached brother Abraham wasn't any different you show me a message where brother didn't preach on the clothesline can I say it that way he does but did he preach a revelation too right why he had a mixed multitude there he had the Corinthian Church he had the Ephesian church now he didn't preach the Corinthian Church just to beat him down he was trying to bring him up to get him over on the efficient side is that right so that's the goal of the pastor we're not here to beat you down but we need to tell you get away from those things right is that right amen and move up to a vision amen because we want to go to adoption as as pastors that's what we want to take you all too right is to adoption sure and you know I told brother brother uh Samuel you know brother Brandon had a quote he said you know he said God will not require you to do something that he's not willing to do did you know he said that right amen so when Jesus was born he was born Jesus capital J capital e capital S capital u capital s he didn't become God at the River Jordan right he was born a son will be given to you and his name shall call be called Emmanuel God With Us all right does everybody understand that he didn't become that at Jordan I'll tell you what happened to Jordan because he's going to do example what we have to do is that right he came to the spirit of adoption right right now Spirit adoption is this it's when he said this is my son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in exactly there's your spirit of adoption you understand so you're born right then you receive the spirit of adoption then after that you're going to come to full adoption can I put it that way you know where brother Brandon received his cool adoption sunset Mountain when God pulled him up into that cloud right is that right because remember in adoption you put your son on a high place and you said this is my son his check name's as good on the checkbook as mine is is that what happened to Jesus Christ when he pulled him up on a mount Transfiguration didn't he say this is my son here ye him exactly so he took adoption is that right so what did Brother Brandon well not sunset Mountain he took adoption let me tell you you're gonna have to have your sunset Mountain too is that right like I've told people you want to see and this is me now you can change this or whatever and not what in Revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel come down yeah that was logos does everybody agree you know what and I tell him and I'm going to tell you this to show you the separation Your Soul and Spirit are like that okay is that okay all right says in get it for me yeah uh Hebrews 4 12 and read it for me I can almost explode it but I want him to be sure we get it right he for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than the in two-edged Sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit right Adam to join Samara Jackson's the only thing can take that old nature off you is the word amen that's what divides it asunder does everybody understand that all right so if you don't have then our message for our day is revelation 10 1-6 that Mighty Angel did come down logos because everybody agree with that if that this message there is going to take that old nature off of you is that right like you said your your soul is the theophany you're right it is exactly what it is and a lot of people in this message don't understand that right so what is it it's when that word gets on the inside of the inside and kills that over damning nature out is that right and then you're born again and now you have the divine nature of God Amen is that right and in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God he was logos is that what word brother I said logos so what gave you New Birth it burnt that old you out of there exactly the OU is d-e-a-d Right amen is that right there's no more to be found of the old you right is that right you're born again is right you're born Anew into the kingdom of God is what you are what is the kingdom of God word word word is what it is right right no wonder brother random could start saying she is him right and everywhere I see now when I pick up a book I see the new birth I just can't isn't that what you do I mean you guys are Jessica you're seeing it sure it's because and the reason it is because God has had so much grace on you people here because he wants you to receive the new birth so that you can make a Rapture right all right now remember it's not an option it's a must right all right you must be born again there's the invisible Union there's your Thanksgiving so in order for you to have joy because without it you're a man most miserable I'll tell you that you really are is that right and with it no matter what the devil tries to throw at you you're happy happy man because why I know I'm born again yeah man I can't lose brother Wade exactly amen no matter what the devil tries to throw at me I win right so in that wonderful now aren't you going to be a message and that you've experienced the new birth I mean it's a wonderful thing people it really is but do me a favor go through the book of Corinthians see what they wrote and I told them I said the the prince church was misbehaving yeah yeah that's what I tell our church and go through there and itemize and see how they were misbehaving look Paul told him in the Theses of the book you've got to have the same message the same mind and the same judgment does everybody understand that exactly right you're all going to be doing living the same thing you're going to have under your messenger if we all live under the message we're all going to be living the same life is that right right it's the truth it can't I can't come to you and preach you a different Christ right right brother Ram didn't preach you a different Christ than what Paul preached we all preach Christ amen and him crucified amen and resurrected is that right a personal experience I like the way you put that last night it's a personal this this Bible has become such a new book today it is it is personal to me it's a love letter right it's personal right and I thank God that I could have that he'd let me have a new birth right away so that I could experience oh Grace you know what I miss Grace right that's right is that right that's what I am it's wonderful isn't it all right I'm gonna close with that hey Lord bless each and every one of you I want you to know it's one of my I don't they don't call me to preach a lot of places and if they did I wouldn't because I'm a pastor does everybody understand that but I do appreciate you it's always wonderful to come here and preach and like I told Brother Samuel when you're when a person when a church is taught and you're a pastor and you come to preach at a church because see pastors supposed to be able to teach too I mean you guys do good you know I don't have to just teach the ABCs and stuff like that all right zoom zoom zoom and preach some nice things right all right so when you go to the church and you feel that freedom and that Spirit right you know that the people have been taught correctly right amen that you could you could preach some good messages you understand what I'm saying so I appreciate your pastor can I tell you that sometimes I call Brother Wayne or a brother uh uh Samuel yeah I told Brother Wade I didn't want to talk to the secretary I wanted to talk to the main man he takes teasing very good but I'll call him up and I'll say so and so and I'll say I want to talk to the main man I don't want to talk to the secretary anyway so I pull brother Samuel out and discuss something with him and it's very it's been very it's a valuable thing for me to be able to have that fellowship with brother Sammy right so like I say you people thank God for the gift that God's put in this church not just him brother Wade do that these men can actually teach the word of God and break it down for you before you go out and live it is that right and really that's what it has to be and I said it this morning that word has got to become flesh it has to be that the prophecy has to become testimony right right to where you're written Epistles writ and red of all me right right you know you look at Corinthians it says that there are angels the world and men that you're a spectacle you know what says that exactly and you know what the word if you look up the word spectacle it's the later you know we're actors we're either acting out the message of the hour or we're acting out the darkness part of it you understand what I'm saying right and it says in Corinthians read it and you'll see what I'm saying it says you are spectacle to the world to men and to Angels right so you absolutely your life will bring people's strength does everybody understand that brother random when he talks about Mr Lily he said Mr Lilly when he comes up he comes up about them up comes up and when he Sprouts out the Bumblebee can come by and draw nectar out of him right he draws strings and brother random said virtue there did you know that virtue there it says where people could draw strength from you right yeah and you live the most confused life in the message of the hour do you think God can draw virtue or straight from you another brother no we're workers together does everybody understand right and we need to draw strength one from another that's why strength and virtue is so important in the message in the Believers all right so you need to start living the message of the hour if a quote says don't do it why can't you do it why are you going to exalt yourself over that right it's me you know what they did in crit they said I I mean read it as I mean it'll make you blush the life they lived right right see that's what's happening around the message of the hour we have message Believers say they believe it argue it speak it know it right and no life to back it up right right like you said brother Wade they're on dangerous Grammy they're on Dangerous Ground because they haven't went on and received the new birth and be separated right from the old man can I say that they're not living in a new land right that's all right amen God bless each and every one amen I'm going back to Oklahoma tomorrow I'll be glad to be leaving Georgia by the way Georgia's okay as low as you're here but I need to get home so Lord bless you I appreciate each and every one of you like I say I talked to brother Samuel and you know I just I'm out there by myself I don't even have a minister another minister in the church so one thing I really ask you people is be praying for us I'm asking God to grow the church give me a song leader give me a deacon give me somebody else who can so I'm asking for a lot right if you're a lot is that right so if you would if you'll be praying with me I'd really appreciate it amen and pray for the church we've had a lot of natural death in the church and I've had people in the accountant tell me I said we're not going to your church everybody's dying and I said no you don't understand they're sleeping right right nobody's died they're on the other side half of my church made it what about your church is that right so it's not my point right there foreign but it sure is rough on the flesh you know what I mean so if you would I really covet your prayers you pray for us uh brother Samuel brother Wade's going to be out there next week preaching so after this two-week journey I get two weeks off to hear them preach when they come out there so I'm kind of glad I hadn't been in my own bed and I'm wore out I'm getting old now brother Wade's been teasing me because he says I'm an evangelist or trying to do the Evangelist I said buddy I'll tell you right now I'm not an evangelist I'm a pastor so I ain't got no business out here trying to evangelize all right because that's not my Ministry you know what I mean I see a lot of pastors or should I say this I see a lot of evangelists that are drying the pastor exactly they won't even stay at their Church they're out here they're out there they're out here they're out there more than they're at their Church their Ministry speaks of what it really is the gift we need to start smarting it up writing the message of the hour right right Lorraine said don't mix your Ministries right we know that right so God bless you I want you to know I love each and every one of you I really do I just when I get into church even our church I'll stand there for a minute and look at everybody because you are the most pretty people right on the face of the Earth right exactly you are the Bride of Jesus Christ do you realize that you're the most beautiful people on the face of the earth I told our young girls I said you know you look at those women out in the world or our brothers said they're all hardened up you remember that sister that looked at sister meeting and said oh sister media You're So Soft she got hardened up she smoked you ever see somebody smokes a lot of women they're ugly yeah their face will all wrinkle up I told somebody why would you why would a woman smell they're the most vain creature on the face of the Earth

now but I know what he said he said in second Corinthians he'd become a great guy and was a deacon in the church that's what he's saying I can't find it and that's what I believe he knows what he's talking about he said to become a deacon in the church so he must have found something right and get straightened up let's just saying what do we got brother dude my heart for laughter he said he really they are left here how much snow just covering everything that's right amen you know I get so upset and I know what it means but people are making so much now and they they put out this rainbow
