[3:39] them okay Matthew 19 we've read these
[3:42] scriptures but uh we just keep reading
[3:45] it until we get down to where we want to
[3:46] be okay Matthew 19
[3:49] 3-9 the Pharisees also came unto him
[3:52] tempting him now want it's tempting him
[3:54] right words they wouldn't
[3:56] right they wasn't concerned and somebody
[3:59] trying to tempt somebody doesn't care
[4:01] which angle they approach from they'll
[4:04] do anything they can to trap you if
[4:06] they're trying to tempt you and saying
[4:08] unto him is it lawful for a man to put
[4:10] away his wife or ever cause he answered
[4:14] unto them have you not read that he
[4:17] which made them at the beginning made
[4:18] them male and female and said for this
[4:21] cause shall a man leave his father and
[4:22] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[4:24] they twain shall be one
[4:27] flesh wherefore they are no longer TW wi
[4:29] but one flesh what therefore God ha
[4:31] joined together let no man put us under
[4:34] they say unto him why did Moses then
[4:36] command to give a writing a divorcement
[4:38] and to put her away he sath unto them
[4:42] Moses because of the hardness of your
[4:44] hearts suffered you to put away your
[4:47] wives but from the beginning it was not
[4:49] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[4:51] put away his wife except it be for
[4:53] fornication and shall marry another
[4:55] commits adultery and who so marry her
[4:57] which is put away does commit adultery
[4:59] all right Deuteronomy now
[5:02] 24 verse 1-3 when a man had taken a wife
[5:06] and married her and it come to pass that
[5:09] she find no favor in his eyes because he
[5:11] have found some uncleanness in her let
[5:15] then let him write her a bill of
[5:16] divorcement and give it into her hand
[5:19] and send her out of his house and when
[5:22] she has departed out of his house she
[5:23] may go be go and be another man's wife
[5:28] and if the latter husband hate her and
[5:30] write her a bill of divorcement and give
[5:32] it into her hand and send it send her
[5:34] out of his house or the latter husband
[5:37] die which took her to be wife you going
[5:40] down reading theand is not to come and
[5:42] take her back you may be seated the Lord
[5:44] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[5:46] word
[5:48] now we have got up to the point
[5:52] of tonight what we want to deal with and
[5:55] we'll get back to it in a minute but
[5:57] what we want to deal with tonight is is
[5:59] the Matthew 19 so just go ahead and keep
[6:02] that up brother um Anderson of Matthew
[6:06] 19 because we want to emphasize some
[6:09] things on the verses and and follow
[6:11] after exactly what is being said but now
[6:16] remember we've covered what is a
[6:20] marriage is when you're
[6:22] engaged and we're not talking now listen
[6:24] I want to make it plain to you and I
[6:27] have it in here a couple of times we are
[6:29] not talking about what the world calls a
[6:32] marriage or divorce or anything that's
[6:34] right amen we are not even con being
[6:36] concerned with what you know the word
[6:39] divorce means this and the word marriage
[6:41] means that we're not concerned with any
[6:44] of those things that's right we are not
[6:46] in any way attempting to explain it by
[6:49] natural terminologies we are trying to
[6:51] explain it by the scripture all and the
[6:55] prophet's message okay now in doing that
[6:58] then don't get tied up in well I don't
[7:01] believe this means that well if we're
[7:03] going to believe and that's the emphasis
[7:06] I placed upon it if we're going to
[7:08] believe the
[7:10] prophet you know all right let's believe
[7:13] it amen if not let's forget it right
[7:16] amen but if we're going to try to follow
[7:18] this message and believe the prophet
[7:20] when he said that as far as God is
[7:22] concerned when you ask the girl to marry
[7:24] you and she accepts that you're married
[7:27] amen he said the law gives your right to
[7:30] live together and all like that and he
[7:32] said you're married no matter whether
[7:33] you take the vows at the altar or
[7:36] whether or not you consummate that by
[7:38] going and living together you know or
[7:40] whatever you're doing that those are
[7:43] things in other words secondary going
[7:45] with it amen so we've determined that
[7:47] what a marriage is is The Vow you make
[7:51] unto that person all right then we
[7:54] covered a what a divorce is and see it
[7:58] makes me kind of
[7:59] laugh because I remember a Little
[8:02] Rascal's things and they were talking
[8:04] about their mom and dad was going to get
[8:06] a divorce and I don't say this for a
[8:08] joke I just try to make a point and all
[8:11] of the kids was trying to figure out
[8:12] what was a
[8:13] divorce and uh this finally this little
[8:17] black boy he said I know what it is and
[8:20] they said what he said I was down there
[8:22] the other day and said there was a wreck
[8:23] on the highway and said that policeman
[8:25] said that was the worst wreck he had
[8:28] ever seen so that's what he thought a
[8:30] divorce was was a wre on the highway
[8:32] yeah you know so that's what a lot of
[8:34] people thinks a divorce is yeah or what
[8:37] a marriage is you can go to court and
[8:39] see that I ain't never been married at
[8:41] one time well what about going to the
[8:43] other County you you might be you know
[8:47] and two how many times have you been
[8:48] engaged all right now but now listen
[8:51] then what is a
[8:54] divorce irregardless of what you would
[8:56] think about the word divorce you would
[8:58] have to agree with a simple
[8:59] terminologies of what a divorce is if a
[9:02] marriage is your vows that you made to
[9:05] one
[9:06] another then simply a divorce is to deny
[9:09] those vows or take back those vows in
[9:13] other words you you wrote down that the
[9:15] courthouse that you made your vows you
[9:17] were married they call that to give you
[9:19] a license Etc you know all right then
[9:22] you'd go back to the courthouse and the
[9:23] courthouse would say they're wanting to
[9:25] take back the vows they made to one
[9:28] another you say well that's not in the
[9:30] wording no but that's what's taking
[9:34] place right just be sensible that's
[9:37] what's taking place sure you get a
[9:39] lawyer and you pay him 1,500 bucks to
[9:43] write you out a piece of paper when all
[9:44] you got to do is go tell her I don't
[9:45] live with you no
[9:47] more I don't take back what I said to
[9:50] you that's what a divorce is of course
[9:52] good judge of life actually doing that
[9:54] he's got to get paid too you know that's
[9:56] what I say we're not arguing about the
[9:58] world says about what he anything said
[9:59] that's right and also when I get on in
[10:01] here in the fur I've got it written down
[10:03] another time to say it like this we are
[10:06] not discussing this upon the basis of
[10:09] what organized religion thinks sir or
[10:11] what the churches agree with that's
[10:14] right we are talking about what the
[10:16] Bible says and what the prophet says the
[10:19] Bible is saying unto us all right amen
[10:23] that way we're making our statement upon
[10:25] that basis and if we can't believe it
[10:27] that way
[10:30] then how in the world could you ever
[10:32] believe in the grace that's right amen
[10:34] if you're not going to believe him up to
[10:36] the grace how can you believe in grace
[10:38] right well I think he was a prophet
[10:40] maybe he was a prophet I don't know but
[10:43] well blessed God I really believe him on
[10:45] that marriage and divorce Grace now Butz
[10:47] I needed that well see that's the way we
[10:50] are that's how silly we turn out to be
[10:52] you
[10:53] know but listen
[10:56] church I hope you understand what I'm
[10:58] trying to bring
[10:59] bring so let's get started on this and
[11:03] as I was ending up Sunday or doing
[11:05] Sunday I want to reread a couple of
[11:07] things back to you and read them real
[11:08] fast and not spend no time on it but I
[11:12] want you to follow with me of what I'm
[11:15] trying to say and where we're trying to
[11:17] get to on this position of of a divorce
[11:20] and tonight we'll be talking about uh in
[11:23] other words who can get a divorce all
[11:26] right so we will have to review back
[11:28] over and in Romans 7
[11:32] 1-3 we have uh well let's keep this up
[11:36] right here let's keep this but I want
[11:38] you to I want you to see this all right
[11:40] Matthew 19
[11:42] 3-9 the Pharisees came unto him tempting
[11:47] him they did not believe him to be who
[11:49] he
[11:50] was they were tempting him to try to
[11:53] trap him right MH right right trying to
[11:58] make life of him right to show him up
[12:02] yeah as to not know what he's talking
[12:07] about so they were tempting him and
[12:10] saying unto him is it lawful for a man
[12:14] to put away his wife for every
[12:19] cause now that word every there would be
[12:22] any cause right every cause all right
[12:27] now
[12:30] as I said look what he says immediately
[12:32] back to him and he answered and said
[12:33] unto him have you not read that he which
[12:35] he went right to the
[12:36] scriptures which made them at the
[12:38] beginning made them male and female he
[12:40] never even answered their question it
[12:42] was not even worthy of
[12:44] discussing he didn't argue debate with
[12:46] it I've got a couple of things on what I
[12:48] preached back under and the the brothers
[12:50] commented a couple of times least he
[12:51] called me brother I thank you that but
[12:54] uh you know I ain't going to comment on
[12:56] the Internet or on on the here and argue
[12:59] with nobody if he hears this he's
[13:01] waiting on me to say something so if he
[13:03] hears this I call my house and come see
[13:06] me be glad to see you you know be glad
[13:09] to talk with you but I ain't going to
[13:10] argue here I ain't going to argue you on
[13:11] the internet cuz there's no argument
[13:13] about it I just going down the road and
[13:15] forget it all right but now
[13:19] listen Jesus said that there was no such
[13:23] thing as a man being able to put away
[13:25] his
[13:26] wife right cuz even if you've never
[13:30] thought of it on this course I try to
[13:32] give things natural and then go back
[13:35] up the in the beginning was back before
[13:38] the sin in the
[13:40] garden
[13:43] right all right so you got to go back to
[13:45] the beginning so you know what the
[13:47] prophet has said in marriage and divorce
[13:48] indivisible union he said you go back to
[13:51] the beginning he said that was when
[13:52] there was male female yep there was no
[13:56] such thing as a deer with a hole hire
[14:01] them or a man with a hole hire them or
[14:03] or you know whatever anything else it
[14:06] was just male and
[14:09] female so he wasn't even answering
[14:12] anything of their point when they said
[14:14] can a man put his wife away forever
[14:17] cause now first off I want to make
[14:20] myself
[14:21] blunt Moses never gave them a right to
[14:24] put other wives away for every cause
[14:28] that's right I want to see that in the
[14:31] Bible no all right I want to see it in
[14:35] brother R's message where he says he did
[14:38] sure I know the quotes that brother Ram
[14:40] has made and you read them it sounds
[14:41] like brother said see there give right
[14:44] to put them away for everything no read
[14:46] right back before then cuz I've been
[14:48] over these and over these and over the
[14:49] and you'll see that he's saying they are
[14:52] saying right all right so now Moses
[14:55] never gave them a right to put away
[14:57] their wife for just any
[15:03] cause I want you to remember that we're
[15:06] talking about that this message is for
[15:09] the end time
[15:11] people it's not for the world they're
[15:12] not going to listen to you talk all
[15:15] right first off then there's nobody ever
[15:18] had an understanding that Moses gave any
[15:21] form of Grace of marriage and divorce I
[15:24] want to see a commentary even says
[15:27] it all
[15:29] nobody didn't understand
[15:31] Paul and do you understand Paul we going
[15:34] to get to it after a while we won't
[15:35] right now but do you understand Paul and
[15:37] what he said and can you tie it together
[15:40] with the grace of marriage and divorce
[15:44] right and where is it in Moses gave the
[15:47] writing of divorcement
[15:52] right I mean I want I want somebody to
[15:54] show me because i' I've studied this for
[15:56] 40
[15:57] years
[16:01] see because you got to find out what
[16:02] you're
[16:04] doing you can't just go in Corinthians
[16:06] and say Paul don't say in Corinthians
[16:08] said okay now you take your wife go home
[16:10] with him everything's okie dokie right
[16:12] he doesn't say
[16:16] that brother Brown was the one that
[16:18] brought that into modern day
[16:19] terminologies are
[16:22] saying now it's the Delights of the
[16:24] message we'll make sure to get it in
[16:25] here and then it's Delights remember
[16:27] this message and this grace of marriage
[16:29] and divorce is only for the Believers of
[16:32] this message amen that's right it is not
[16:34] for the denominational world it is not
[16:36] for it is because of a supernatural
[16:38] Revelation I tried to make it plain
[16:40] there the other night it's there Sunday
[16:44] it's only because you've received a
[16:45] revelation can you understand the grace
[16:47] and receive it because the grace is
[16:49] there doesn't mean you have it do that
[16:52] mean you are saved before you received
[16:55] salvation no you received it didn't you
[16:59] right we going to have to receive the
[17:00] grace of marriage and divorce
[17:02] right and if you don't know what it is
[17:04] how can you receive it right right you
[17:06] can't take this out to the world and say
[17:08] I want to explain it to y'all come on in
[17:10] here and we'll tell you how to get
[17:11] things straightened out leave them bring
[17:13] them into the word yeah man that's right
[17:16] and then we can talk about marriage and
[17:18] divorce it is not something to be
[17:20] explained to your neighbor no wonder
[17:22] they make such light of us that's right
[17:25] where are you going to find it in the
[17:26] Bible you say let's God Moses gave a
[17:29] right to divorcement H gave a right to I
[17:32] want I want somebody to sit down my
[17:34] study with me and just give me the
[17:37] scriptures and show me how that's
[17:39] marriage and divorce
[17:41] Grace that's what we're going to deal
[17:43] with
[17:45] tonight he just just show it to me where
[17:47] it's
[17:49] at if not you're just saying brother
[17:52] Brown said it we'll go out there and
[17:53] tell them go here to the church next to
[17:55] us not throwing off on them they they
[17:57] know brother br
[17:59] but go say brother R said so and so yeah
[18:02] he said well we don't believe it that
[18:04] way see we're A peculiar people amen
[18:08] we're an odd bunch of people I'm talking
[18:10] about the Believers in this message to
[18:12] believe that God sent a prophet amen and
[18:15] if he sent a prophet to us then he gave
[18:17] us Grace that is a prophet a prophet is
[18:20] Grace to the people I know I've heard it
[18:22] preach and it's true a a prophet is
[18:24] judgment to a nation yes but he's grace
[18:26] to the people right right amen all right
[18:30] amen but now get in there and let's just
[18:31] think about what he's
[18:33] saying so Jesus doesn't answer him they
[18:36] say can a man put away his wife forever
[18:39] cause in other words can he just put her
[18:41] away any time he wants to for any
[18:48] reason Jesus anchored
[18:53] it he said from the beginning it was not
[18:57] so
[18:59] right
[19:01] right okay so they back
[19:04] off he's going down explaining what
[19:07] happened in Genesis and how they're
[19:10] won talking to the Pharisees so they see
[19:14] that they can't go the approach they're
[19:17] going so now they're trying to make
[19:20] light of him but verse seven and they
[19:23] say unto them why did Moses now
[19:27] watch they don't bring up for any
[19:30] cause right read your
[19:33] scripture they said why they say unto
[19:35] him why did Moses
[19:38] then you know the scriptures don't you
[19:41] you know Moses
[19:43] gave a writing a
[19:46] divorce
[19:47] look they say unto him why did Moses
[19:50] then give command to give a writing of
[19:53] divorcement and to put her away they
[19:55] never mentioned what CA then you better
[19:57] get off of that that cuz he done answer
[19:59] them up here if you go back to the
[20:01] original read it over and over in the
[20:03] prophet's message marriage and divorce
[20:04] and invisible Union and watch how much
[20:06] he
[20:07] emphasizes that it wasn't so from the
[20:10] beginning it was just one man one woman
[20:13] that's right that's right and they were
[20:15] one
[20:17] physically yep right and one spiritually
[20:21] yep and how could it now
[20:24] watch so now he's going to answer them
[20:26] see he didn't answer them up here you
[20:28] think this is not an answer if you're
[20:30] reading it look at it read it sometime
[20:33] just sit down and read it plain
[20:35] language he didn't argue with him he
[20:38] just told him it wasn't so
[20:42] no they said can you put him away
[20:44] forever C he no other words what was he
[20:47] saying no cuz from the beginning it was
[20:49] just
[20:50] one
[20:52] right amen other words he was saying
[20:54] Moses never gave you that right cuz
[20:57] Moses was my Prophet that said in the
[21:00] beginning it wasn't
[21:02] right now they get
[21:05] down then they say why did Moses then
[21:09] give
[21:10] her a
[21:13] commandment to put her away he said unto
[21:17] them Moses because of the hardness of
[21:20] your
[21:22] hearts suffered you to put away your
[21:25] wives but from the beginning it was not
[21:28] so that's right that's right now
[21:32] watch did God give a Grace in the last
[21:35] days because of the hardness of our
[21:43] hearts now I know you're quoting in your
[21:45] mind so that's good that's what I want
[21:47] you to
[21:47] do he said because of misinterpreted
[21:51] theology is that
[21:54] correct well wouldn't that exactly what
[21:57] Jesus was saying under
[22:00] them your misinterpreted theology is
[22:03] what caused Moses to have to give a
[22:06] granting of a Grace and I believe he
[22:11] did I preached to you when I believe he
[22:16] did because how did Rahab the Harlot
[22:19] wind up to be able to marry
[22:21] that Israeli General and right out of
[22:24] there come the lineage down to Jesse
[22:28] right right towards Jesus Every Which
[22:30] Way it
[22:32] comes which really comes to Joseph you
[22:34] know that
[22:37] right but you see what I'm talking
[22:40] about the whole text of the whole point
[22:43] is Jesus is telling them Moses never
[22:45] gave you a right to do
[22:47] that you wanted it you got in trouble he
[22:51] had to come up with an
[22:55] answer and he gave it we'll get back to
[22:57] that that in a little while I want to
[22:58] hold that
[22:59] point and I want you to think on
[23:03] that in no way did Moses give them a
[23:08] right to just do for anything right amen
[23:12] we're going to read some things the
[23:13] prophet had to
[23:16] say about whether or not a Believer
[23:19] should be put
[23:22] away I mean an unbeliever excuse
[23:26] me
[23:28] we're going to read whether or not he
[23:30] says it cuz his wife don't cook and do
[23:32] everything just right they could put her
[23:34] away he said you can't do it
[23:40] right flatly he said it this way he said
[23:43] even if she puts me away I'm still
[23:45] married to
[23:46] her that's where you you don't listen to
[23:48] brother Dale and what he's
[23:52] saying some of you may have got a
[23:54] divorce from your husband or your wife
[23:56] but have you checked out to see if the
[23:58] other side got
[23:59] it we it's got a
[24:02] divorce well if it's not a two-
[24:05] party you could be still having some
[24:08] technical
[24:13] problem
[24:16] sorry but is it the truth that's right
[24:19] I'd rather know it and get rid of it
[24:21] here didn't have trouble down at the
[24:25] river right but now
[24:31] listen so we're saying that this does
[24:33] not
[24:34] apply whatsoever of marriage and divorce
[24:38] to the worldly systems of their thinking
[24:41] neither does it
[24:44] apply to organize religions or religions
[24:47] in any form and he said it was only
[24:49] we'll get back to it after a while only
[24:51] to his followers that's right that's
[24:54] right that could receive the grace of
[24:56] marriage and divorce I'm sorry I don't
[24:59] mean to be blunt but mean to be blunt
[25:01] enough for you to think it over it ain't
[25:03] for uncle and aunt and sui and Mom and
[25:05] Daddy sometimes you got to think it
[25:09] over because they were not here to
[25:11] receive it no they don't know how to
[25:13] receive it this is not a blanket you
[25:16] throw out to a church even n you say
[25:20] everybody in here is under this blanket
[25:21] no it ain't it ain't no blanket it's an
[25:23] individual of fire that's right yes sir
[25:27] down some hard
[25:29] right all right but just remember where
[25:32] we spent our time
[25:34] at who P up Romans 7 I think I put it on
[25:37] there for
[25:40] you but you know what it says in Romans
[25:43] 7 I don't think I'm left it on my notes
[25:45] so they may have a little trouble
[25:47] getting do you know what Paul said in
[25:49] Romans 7 that her husband must be dead
[25:56] amen
[25:58] yep does that sound like
[26:02] Grace let's just read that I want to
[26:05] make sure everybody understand it
[26:06] follows Romans
[26:10] 7 no you not Breen for I speak to them
[26:12] that know the law how that the law have
[26:15] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[26:18] for the woman which hath an husband is
[26:20] bound by the law to her husband so long
[26:22] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[26:25] she is loose from the law of her husband
[26:28] so then if while her husband liveth she
[26:30] be married to another man she shall be
[26:32] called an adulteress but if her husband
[26:35] be dead she is free from that law so
[26:38] that she is no adulterous though she be
[26:39] married to another man okay so we got it
[26:44] up all right now so then doing that the
[26:47] husband must be dead right and then we
[26:51] covered that there was no and I want to
[26:53] make sure come on these tape I keep
[26:55] putting these things back on because
[26:57] somebody come along and click on and
[26:59] they just hear one tape and they wonder
[27:01] what in world you talking about all
[27:03] right go ahead with number one on their
[27:05] notes and look what we're we're still
[27:07] back on what we were talking about now
[27:10] that brother Brandon said there is no
[27:12] grounds for a woman to divorce her
[27:15] husband and marry again that's
[27:18] right if she divorced her husband
[27:20] according to Paul in Corinthians it will
[27:22] get to another while she must rest
[27:24] remain single or be reunited back to her
[27:27] husband
[27:28] there's no ground for a woman to divorce
[27:30] her husband and marry again
[27:32] right right now we went through that
[27:35] cover that you don't have to live with
[27:37] him if he's a dirty mean
[27:39] guy right you can separate from him
[27:42] because Paul said if they do separate
[27:44] yeah but they don't give you a right to
[27:47] remarry well you mean my my husband he
[27:49] was mean he was beat me
[27:51] he your pra for you got it all right
[27:53] that's right
[27:56] amen
[27:58] right if You' have prayed for you got
[28:00] him you would have wouldn't have wound
[28:01] up with a smelling you know what brother
[28:03] around said about the the lady said the
[28:05] girl why did you well he had such pretty
[28:08] feet and he smelled so good he said I'd
[28:10] rather him have shoes like a car box and
[28:13] stink like a something I forgot what he
[28:16] used the word horse or something and be
[28:18] a good boy about it right
[28:21] amen but you see we were the one that
[28:23] messed it up all right so look what he
[28:25] said now we'll just read these F so we
[28:27] won't have to wor about for marriage and
[28:28] divorce brother randman explain
[28:30] paragraph 227 see she has got a living
[28:33] husband no man can marry her cuz what
[28:36] she does and who she is she's got a
[28:38] living husband there is care what she
[28:40] does or who she is she's got a living
[28:42] husband there's no grounds for her at
[28:44] all but it's not said for him because
[28:46] it's her not him get it you have to make
[28:49] the word run in continuity see nothing
[28:52] saying he couldn't but she can't see
[28:55] calls it her not him that's exactly what
[28:57] the Bible says causes her it's not
[28:59] stated against him to remarry but her
[29:02] why Christ in the Tope right now I will
[29:05] say this up front brother brandom never
[29:09] gave an okay for a man to just be able
[29:12] to divorce his wife for any cause and
[29:15] marry again amen we won't cover them
[29:18] today but a man has a perfect right to
[29:21] put his wife away for cutting her heart
[29:23] that's right honored of God the prophet
[29:26] said to do so but he cannot remarry for
[29:29] that cause right amen so that's plain is
[29:32] there that we won't get we're not
[29:34] wanting to get into that not we're want
[29:35] to cover one
[29:37] thing what about
[29:40] Moses was they right when they said
[29:42] Moses said they could just put them away
[29:44] for everything see Jesus was telling you
[29:47] Moses never said that that's right they
[29:50] made him say what they
[29:54] wanted he never said it so that's the
[29:56] point all right with the next
[29:59] one kill on marriage and
[30:01] divorce paragraph 243 there is one
[30:05] Christ and many members of that wife
[30:07] notice he can put put us away for
[30:10] Spiritual fornication false Doctrine
[30:11] anytime he wants to but how dare you try
[30:14] to put him away and make it the man can
[30:16] put away his wife and marry another but
[30:17] not the woman put away her husband and
[30:19] marry another I see all the types and
[30:21] shadows going to the next one just want
[30:23] to get those points notice the Bible
[30:25] plainly says here that her first husband
[30:28] must be dead not just put away he's got
[30:31] to be dead that's paragraph 151 of the
[30:34] invisible Union 65
[30:36] 11:25 right go on to the next one Paul
[30:39] here is given an illustration this
[30:41] invisible Union paragraph
[30:43] 35 in our scripture about the law and
[30:46] Grace and illustrating like marriage and
[30:47] divorce this passage is very seldomly
[30:49] preached on because it more or less
[30:50] pertains to like marriage and divorce
[30:53] but it also pertains to a greater
[30:54] portion of marriage and divorce of how
[30:56] that he's trying trying to set in order
[30:58] here that we as as a church can no be no
[31:02] more be married to the world and to
[31:05] Christ at the same time and be legal and
[31:07] lawful about it then it could be for a
[31:09] woman to be living with a husband while
[31:11] she's got a living husband he said now I
[31:14] have my thoughts on that one
[31:15] more these are just showing you there's
[31:18] no grounds for
[31:19] her all right and we're going to get
[31:21] them to Paul with this scripture in a
[31:23] little while I may do it now I don't
[31:25] know I'll have to look back and check
[31:27] this is marriage and divorce paragraph
[31:29] 230 now you notice in First Corinthians
[31:33] 7:10 Paul commands that the wife that is
[31:37] that divorces her husband to remain
[31:39] single or be reconciled not to remarry
[31:42] she must remain single or be reconcile
[31:46] be reconciled back to her husband she
[31:48] cannot Remar she must remain single but
[31:50] notice is never said about him all right
[31:53] so now as I said we're going to get down
[31:55] when we get to it we're not going to
[31:57] cover the male show in this pig
[31:59] everybody would think we are and say
[32:00] well a man he just what he do for
[32:02] anything you can't do
[32:04] it amen I want to show to see where the
[32:07] Prophet says you
[32:09] can I definitely want to see where the
[32:11] Bible says he can right all
[32:16] right now let's get down to
[32:23] something when they were tempting Jesus
[32:28] they were not wanting the truth right
[32:31] right or it wouldn't have been stated
[32:33] they were tempting
[32:34] him you didn't say they just asked him a
[32:37] simple question you know they Shar Us in
[32:38] the heart no they asked him tempting him
[32:42] trying to trick him track him do
[32:44] whatever they could all right see they
[32:47] didn't want the
[32:51] truth
[32:54] right they just wanted to show how smart
[32:56] they were
[32:57] yep that's right
[33:00] amen don't you know that Moses gave us a
[33:03] ride of
[33:04] divorcement to put away our wife and
[33:06] marry
[33:13] again and
[33:16] watch the first point was can you
[33:19] divorce your wife for any cause second
[33:22] Point kind of weaken down just a little
[33:25] bit got to from the ever
[33:29] cost and said you know Moses done
[33:33] that now remember how many times brother
[33:36] around emphasize this
[33:38] point that they said we're moses'
[33:43] disciples right then those Pharisees
[33:47] when they're always saying we're moses'
[33:51] disciples we follow Moses we don't know
[33:54] about
[33:54] you right well then why didn't they
[33:57] believe Moses
[33:59] right why did they not read what Moses
[34:02] had to say that's
[34:09] right Moses never gave him a writing of
[34:11] divorcement forever call that's
[34:15] right sure he gave him a message of
[34:23] Grace
[34:24] but here's something I want to drop
[34:34] damn is marriage What is marriage and
[34:36] divorce how is it to be
[34:40] handled now this is the way I believe it
[34:44] so you whatever you want to do I believe
[34:47] marriage and divorce is a one- Time
[34:49] given
[34:52] thing
[34:55] that's are you following me whether you
[34:57] agree with him or not that's okay that's
[34:58] that's your business I'm just making my
[35:00] point about
[35:01] it I believe marriage and divorce is
[35:05] given one thing now no I didn't say now
[35:07] don't misunderstand me and say it was
[35:09] given for one person I didn't say that I
[35:12] said it was
[35:14] given for one time
[35:21] right see then you can't just take it
[35:23] and say well I divorced this woman here
[35:27] because of this and I'll divorce that
[35:28] one for this and I'll divorce this one
[35:30] for that and I'll divorce that one for
[35:31] that I'm sorry I I don't I can't see
[35:34] that I'm sorry if that's the way you
[35:36] believe it that's your business I'm just
[35:38] telling you how I
[35:40] believe but brother random when he gave
[35:43] the grace of marriage and divorce what
[35:44] did he say and we'll read it at the last
[35:46] of the
[35:48] message he said God told me to tell you
[35:50] to go on as you
[35:53] are but not to do it
[35:55] again that's
[35:59] right
[36:01] now so evidently Grace is allotted for
[36:04] only one
[36:06] thing you know we don't have a blanket
[36:09] given to us in Salvation that we can go
[36:11] out and live like the devil and
[36:13] everything's covered because we're in
[36:15] The Bride of Jesus Christ we've done
[36:17] been through that and proved
[36:22] it see grace is not just a blanket throw
[36:25] out and you just go live like the devil
[36:26] but the blanket covers
[36:29] you and you go divorce one woman and
[36:32] then you come up with a second woman and
[36:33] you come up with a third woman a fourth
[36:34] woman something what are you
[36:37] doing well the prophet said it was Grace
[36:41] well Grace now
[36:43] listen
[36:46] Grace are we
[36:48] Catholic Catholic believes in being um
[36:51] forgiven before you
[36:53] do you can go down and pay and go out
[36:56] and do
[36:57] right now if they don't like that the
[37:00] people listening in can just argue the
[37:02] point that's plain language about what
[37:04] you do right you can just go down and
[37:07] pay it off and then go do it well I
[37:10] don't believe in that
[37:14] amen Grace is not for future
[37:17] sins
[37:19] amen Grace is covering of the past sin
[37:24] or the things that we have done right
[37:28] and if we do again we have to
[37:31] repent right is that right amen so then
[37:35] the grace of marriage and divorce
[37:36] wouldn't be just a blanket throw it out
[37:38] to where that this they would say well
[37:40] well just come on down here and you know
[37:42] Moses day and bring us a couple of caves
[37:45] and a few little something to eat maybe
[37:46] a little gold and we'll just we'll
[37:48] sprinkle a little salt on you and turn
[37:50] around and send you
[37:51] back that's what the Catholic Church
[37:54] believes they actually believe believe
[37:56] that they sprinkle s on you turn and
[37:58] send you back and that you're totally a
[37:59] virgin going back just like you was when
[38:01] you've
[38:02] started that's their
[38:05] belief they believe in restored come
[38:07] find out you find some people in this
[38:08] message believe that too that's
[38:13] right but that I mean that's silly amen
[38:16] so now remember what I'm
[38:18] saying Moses like brother brandom like
[38:22] Paul was bringing a Grace for what had
[38:26] taken
[38:28] place right now yep right what had taken
[38:35] place not what is going to take place
[38:38] now follow me what I'm
[38:40] saying we wasn't back there to hear
[38:43] Brother random when he told him at the
[38:44] Tabernacle
[38:47] right but when God reveals it to
[38:50] you then it's for you that
[38:54] day are you listening amen it's for you
[38:58] that
[38:59] day but see those sitting there that day
[39:02] if they didn't believe it was for them
[39:05] it wasn't for them either even though
[39:07] they heard the verbal words from the
[39:08] man's mouth right neither is it with
[39:11] Moses or Paul and our brother randam it
[39:14] is not to just say well you know well
[39:16] bless God it's just the Grace we're
[39:19] under grace
[39:20] now don't make it disgrace right
[39:25] right
[39:27] see they wanted the fact that they could
[39:30] put their wives away for any cause or
[39:34] every
[39:38] cause
[39:40] right Ain that the way mankind
[39:45] is he wants to down the
[39:51] woman did Brother random did
[39:55] Paul
[39:57] ever say
[40:01] anything except for what the
[40:05] conditions they were found in
[40:11] right now give it to me if you got it
[40:13] that's
[40:14] right did they say it was for just
[40:22] anything now there was a lot when Moses
[40:25] and brother Rand and Paul said it yes
[40:28] there was a lot of things that the grace
[40:31] they gave
[40:34] covered because it had to be given for
[40:38] there but remember what I'm saying it
[40:41] didn't cover the next day it covered
[40:44] what is prior to
[40:46] then
[40:48] amen all
[40:51] right see now let's go to First
[40:53] Corinthians I got that on the brother
[40:57] let's go to 1 Corinthians
[40:59] 7 let's
[41:06] see so now let me say this statement to
[41:09] you and I don't mean this sarcastically
[41:11] I mean for every one of us there was not
[41:14] one of us I said while ago knew that
[41:16] Paul said anything about the grace of
[41:18] marriage and divorce right until we
[41:20] heard the prophet right
[41:22] right we didn't know Moses gave a Grace
[41:25] of marriage and divorce
[41:27] until we heard the prophet tell
[41:30] us all
[41:32] right now he tells us that it's in Paul
[41:36] in 1 Corinthians
[41:40] 7 but I would like for you to read that
[41:42] with
[41:44] us I hope I can get that up can you get
[41:46] it on that brother they'll get it
[41:48] they'll get it up a little bit
[41:52] sorry and watch his answer and see if
[41:56] Paul says it's for any
[41:58] reason uh 1 Corinthians 7:
[42:02] 10-15 there you go they're getting it
[42:06] all
[42:07] right now
[42:12] watch and unto the married I command
[42:15] watch
[42:16] it yet not
[42:19] I well that's is not his grace of
[42:21] marriage and divorce
[42:24] no yet not
[42:27] but the
[42:29] Lord let not the wife depart from her H
[42:32] husband Romans
[42:34] 7:1
[42:35] MH we just covered that right but if she
[42:42] depart let her remain unmarried or be
[42:46] reconciled to her
[42:47] husband and let not the husband put away
[42:51] his
[42:52] wife right I want you to find for any
[42:55] cause in here right
[42:59] am I want you to find just for any
[43:01] reason whatsoever you can put away your
[43:03] wife and marry another one and it'd be
[43:04] all
[43:06] right he said well she not a Believer
[43:08] well we're going to read down through
[43:10] here below this and then we're going to
[43:11] read what the prophet says about that
[43:14] too I want you to find the grace of
[43:17] marriage and divorce written within
[43:20] here can you do
[43:25] it but to the rest speak I not the
[43:29] Lord now we know it's got to be
[43:31] something doing with him right right
[43:34] okay if any brother ha a wife that
[43:37] believeth not and she be pleased to
[43:40] dwell with him y let him not put her
[43:47] away any brother that's got a
[43:50] wife that believe us not so now Paul is
[43:54] doing away with all of the things they
[43:56] asked brother brandham in the questions
[43:58] and
[44:00] answers can a man put his wife away cuz
[44:03] he don't believe un believer and Remar
[44:07] he said
[44:09] no why cuz Paul just said that right
[44:13] right now
[44:17] what he's still saying
[44:19] what he said and not the
[44:22] Lord and the woman which had an husband
[44:25] that believeth not and if he be pleased
[44:28] to dwell with
[44:30] her let her not leave
[44:33] him or the unbelieving husband is
[44:36] Sanctified by the wife and the
[44:37] unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the
[44:39] husband else were their children unclean
[44:41] AR watch but if the
[44:46] unbelieving not supposed to be
[44:48] Christians one of's a Believer the other
[44:50] one's an unbeliever right now I want to
[44:53] preach on that one of these days what is
[44:54] Believers right come on
[44:57] amen see the way it's preached in this
[45:00] message just about it it's preached that
[45:02] the girls and boys here in this this
[45:04] church has got to intermarry each other
[45:06] they can't go out somewhere else and
[45:07] find them a wife that's where a lot of
[45:09] people believe CU you're marrying
[45:11] outside the
[45:13] faith well I wonder what happened when
[45:15] Joseph when George Smith was a Baptist I
[45:18] believe that's right now he hears this
[45:19] and said he's not that's what I thought
[45:21] they
[45:23] said the brother R was letting them down
[45:30] what is a
[45:36] Believer see a Believer then would be
[45:38] categorized as being someone who is a
[45:40] believer in the Lord Jesus Christ not a
[45:43] believer in Buddha Hindu
[45:45] Muslim
[45:48] whatever I'll get back one of these days
[45:50] every get time I'll preach on that a
[45:54] while because
[45:58] what is a Believer right but if the
[46:01] unbelieving
[46:03] depart let him
[46:09] depart okay him a brother or sister is
[46:14] not under bondage in such case but God
[46:17] has called us to
[46:19] peace all right then he goes on down to
[46:21] explain you know the different things
[46:24] right but where's the grace where did
[46:26] Brother random in there I mean where did
[46:28] Paul say
[46:32] now the Lord met me on the mountain and
[46:34] told me to come down here and tell you
[46:35] to go on as you
[46:46] are remember what the prophet
[46:50] said because of a supernatural
[46:52] Revelation because of the opening of the
[46:53] seven seats right
[46:56] I gave it to you Sunday or Wednesday
[46:59] where that brother Ram covered about
[47:01] three times two times I know in conduct
[47:03] order and Doctrine he told the people
[47:05] that asked him about divorcing or
[47:07] whatever to do he said remain as you are
[47:10] you will hear from me later on this you
[47:12] remember that this past Wednesday I mean
[47:15] this past Sunday he said remain as you
[47:18] are don't go out do
[47:21] anything why because he knew a Grace
[47:23] could be given but he couldn't come up
[47:24] and give it until God called him out and
[47:27] give it neither could
[47:31] Moses neither could Moses give
[47:34] it
[47:38] right now I know I'm going to be running
[47:41] slow tonight I may have to continue this
[47:43] Sunday but that's okay go ahead
[47:47] with with number six on your
[47:50] notes
[47:52] brother cuz what I want to establish now
[47:54] in about five or six
[47:57] quotes is things from brother
[48:00] Brandon that will show
[48:03] you that you don't have a right to just
[48:07] put your wife away for any
[48:12] cost whether they're not good whether
[48:15] they're not good good home bodies you
[48:17] know or whether they're not uh even
[48:21] they're they're
[48:22] unbelievers right now we just got do
[48:25] with Paul
[48:27] said
[48:29] if they want to remain let them
[48:33] remain now where was Paul saying I just
[48:36] divorce him because an unbeliever go
[48:38] find you another one no no
[48:43] no now
[48:46] remember whether it be Moses whether it
[48:49] be Paul or whether it be brother
[48:52] Bram the grace of marriage and divorce
[48:56] cannot
[48:58] be
[48:59] contrary to the word of God absolutely
[49:04] right not saying that the word would
[49:07] definitely emphatically State
[49:11] sometimes but because that would be
[49:14] God's mind transmitted down to mankind
[49:17] of what he was really saying right Amen
[49:22] in his
[49:24] word right
[49:26] so now look what he says he's talking
[49:28] about 1 Corinthians 7th chapter 15th
[49:31] verse all right in answering these
[49:33] questions are the best of my knowledge
[49:34] and I'll try to answer by the scripture
[49:36] first one is found I believe in 1
[49:37] Corinthians 7th chapter 15th verse so
[49:39] we'll try to get over to that and get to
[49:41] the scripture Now 1 Corinthians 7th
[49:43] chapter 15th verse and I suppose the
[49:45] person's present now now here's the way
[49:47] it reads all right now what they done
[49:50] the question we'll read it on down here
[49:51] in a minute the question is can a
[49:53] unbeliever can a Believer put away an
[49:55] unbeliever plain language like that okay
[49:57] we'll read that in a minute but if the
[50:00] unmarried depart let him depart a
[50:02] brother or sister is not under bondage
[50:04] in such a case but God has called us
[50:07] unto
[50:08] peace now that's simple plan right if
[50:11] they
[50:12] depart all right now watch brother
[50:14] Brandon what he's trying to explain now
[50:17] he's explaining there can't be a
[50:23] contradiction it can't be saying that
[50:25] you can just go out and throw them away
[50:27] or whatever you want to do cuz you're
[50:29] going to be contrary to the scriptures
[50:31] watch him
[50:32] now and now 1 Corinthians 7 15th verse
[50:36] now the question they ask brother bradam
[50:38] does this mean a sister brother is free
[50:40] to remarry cuz that's the question
[50:45] is no now he's talking about an
[50:49] unbeliever he ain't brought up nothing
[50:51] about no cases of
[50:54] of uh fornication or
[50:58] adultery he's just talking plain about
[51:01] an
[51:02] unbeliever all he says no so you don't
[51:06] get this question here in what he's
[51:09] saying I talking to brother dick about
[51:11] something the other day and I invite you
[51:12] to do that sometimes go into conduct
[51:14] order and Doctrine especially and just
[51:16] read the
[51:18] question and turn around and read
[51:20] brother Brown's
[51:22] answer and sometimes he don't even ask
[51:25] answer seemingly the question the person
[51:28] asked now he's explaining
[51:34] why he's going to explain to you when we
[51:36] get through reading that Paul was
[51:38] answering exactly what the person are
[51:41] speaking about exactly what the persons
[51:43] back there was asking and that's what he
[51:45] was
[51:46] doing see sometimes we ask a question
[51:49] and brother R would answer the question
[51:51] and and you'd look at him and say well
[51:52] you didn't answer my question yes he did
[51:55] right he answered what you had in your
[52:01] heart
[52:02] right I know a man that
[52:06] denied that brother Bram that he was
[52:08] raised from the dead in brother br's
[52:10] Ministry don't
[52:13] you you think I want to believe the man
[52:16] no I believe brother BR am amen you have
[52:19] another brother that told some things
[52:21] about the dreams that brother brandham
[52:24] had but you better remember a prophet
[52:28] would see the dream see the dream you
[52:30] had and tell you the dream that's right
[52:32] and say why did you leave this part out
[52:35] you know why he left out you wanted
[52:38] to you didn't want to admit what was
[52:40] going on in the dream look too much
[52:41] against you you ever done
[52:44] that so let's see if that's what he's
[52:48] doing does this mean that a sister or
[52:51] brother is free to Remar no so you don't
[52:53] get his question there and what he's
[52:56] saying they're not free see that would
[52:59] make a contradiction in the scripture
[53:01] and the scripture does not contradict
[53:03] themselves at all see now let's you see
[53:06] like you can make the scripture just by
[53:09] reading one verse say anything you want
[53:12] it to say to fit our thought but you've
[53:15] got to take the thought that they're
[53:18] talking
[53:19] on all right so now what he explains it
[53:23] to brother Neville you know if I I say
[53:25] boor you got to find out what's about to
[53:28] board now all right so he goes on he
[53:30] said sometimes the Bible contradicts
[53:32] itself people say see sometimes they say
[53:35] the Bible contradicts itself I want to
[53:37] find it it doesn't he said he's been
[53:38] around for the Holy Ghost is the
[53:40] revealer of the word no contradiction
[53:42] see if Paul is writing them people
[53:45] saying you ask such and such a
[53:48] thing only he isn't just saying you ask
[53:52] it he's saying that
[53:56] other words what they meant what they
[53:57] were trying to say then here he turns
[54:00] around and answers them back which is
[54:03] contrary to what they
[54:11] asked he's picking up their thought and
[54:14] answering their thought brother Rand was
[54:16] picking up people's thoughts instead of
[54:18] answering their question he picked up
[54:20] the thought of what was about the
[54:22] question and sometimes he's been for
[54:25] minutes on one
[54:27] question and you'll never in the 45
[54:29] minutes be able to name him down and say
[54:31] he said
[54:33] this but that's what he
[54:36] said I challenge you to do
[54:40] that they ask we do so and so and so
[54:44] Paul turns around and says something
[54:46] else see looks like it's a contradiction
[54:49] it's not and if you just read the whole
[54:51] verse the whole chapter you find out
[54:53] that he's he's trying to expl explain
[54:56] what they've wrote him so was is
[54:59] everything we try to write him all right
[55:01] here's the question is a brother or
[55:03] sister in the Lord now what is a brother
[55:07] or sister in the
[55:09] Lord can Remar can marry or remarry and
[55:12] be free if they leave their companion to
[55:16] marry again see that's more of that same
[55:19] question part of was could they do and
[55:22] put it away just watch it unto the
[55:24] marriage I command yet not I but the
[55:27] Lord let not the wife depart from her
[55:29] husband see can't do it cuz he says
[55:33] no he says no to what a brother or
[55:36] sister can Remar marry or remarry and be
[55:39] free if they leave their companion to
[55:41] Remar again that's an part part of could
[55:45] day if there were
[55:48] unbelievers go back and read it in the
[55:50] book and then you come on down and he's
[55:52] answering he's bringing their question
[55:55] he says no you can't do it and look what
[55:59] he says unto the married yet not I but
[56:02] the Lord see let not the wife depart
[56:05] from her husband see but and if she
[56:07] departs let her remain unmarried or be
[56:09] reconciled to her husband and let not
[56:11] the husband put away his wife that's the
[56:14] Commandments of the
[56:17] Lord see the Lord one said it wouldn't
[56:20] Paul but to the rest speak I and Paul
[56:25] coming with his grace now not the Lord
[56:27] if any brother ha a wife that believeth
[56:30] not now he's going to answer now watch
[56:33] this subject if you read it on down
[56:35] before this and on through the chapter
[56:37] you'll find that they thought they
[56:39] thought if we married a wife and she was
[56:41] if I got married and I become a Believer
[56:44] and my wife wasn't a Believer let me put
[56:46] her away oh no that isn't it you can't
[56:49] do that that's
[56:53] right if any brother has wife that
[56:55] believeth not and she'd be pleased to
[56:57] dwell with him let him not put her away
[56:59] that's exactly
[57:00] right you said well I'm I'm marry a
[57:03] woman and then or whatever look what he
[57:04] goes on down and
[57:06] say that's not because of marriage and
[57:10] marriage that's because of
[57:12] unbelief words it's not a problem it's
[57:14] not something you straighten up it's
[57:16] because of unbelief not Remar again see
[57:19] you stay with her course you can go on
[57:22] and be Sanctified all right
[57:25] other unbelieving wife is Sanctified
[57:27] notice and if the unbeliever
[57:31] sa the people say bless God you got to
[57:33] get rid of that woman you got she's an
[57:35] unbeliever or you know tell the the the
[57:38] woman you got to get rid of that husband
[57:40] cuz he's an
[57:41] unbeliever
[57:43] now now if the unbeliever
[57:47] says now this is Paul's
[57:50] Grace I want you to read it over and
[57:53] over in Corinthians 7 10 through 15 and
[57:56] on through
[57:57] there first Corinthians this is Paul's
[58:03] Grace that he's giving if not show it to
[58:06] him in the word cuz it's where your
[58:07] Prophet said it
[58:09] that what and if the unbeliever says I'm
[58:14] not going to live with you any
[58:16] longer you've become a Christian to a
[58:19] man tells his wife the man now tell his
[58:22] wife because he got saved and going to
[58:24] get out of the world where we was once
[58:27] in I'm going to leave you now there
[58:31] ain't nothing you can do about it let
[58:35] him
[58:38] depart now he just told you let him
[58:42] depart or her she or the woman who say
[58:46] to her husband I'm not going to mix up
[58:48] with that bunch of Holy Rollers I'm not
[58:51] going to do this I'll separate and leave
[58:53] you don't you leave leave the church you
[58:56] let her leave
[58:58] see and a brother our sister is not
[59:01] under bondage in such
[59:04] case that is if your companion is
[59:08] putting you away and wants to depart for
[59:11] for it excuse me depart for it that's
[59:15] right get the mic away you don't have to
[59:18] just hold unto them if they're wanting
[59:21] to leave you and they're going to leave
[59:24] you
[59:25] for the cause of Christ let them leave
[59:30] but you can't remarry that's right right
[59:32] now that's exactly right let them leave
[59:34] he ain't talking about what they
[59:36] do or do down the road afterward he's
[59:39] answering it exactly
[59:42] right if they decide to leave let them
[59:45] leave now they go get killed down the
[59:48] road you got a different situation they
[59:50] go out something else happen you got
[59:51] other things to deal with right he's
[59:53] answering it to the point
[59:55] right let them go
[59:57] ahead cuz you're not bound there see but
[1:00:02] you can't remarry but God has called us
[1:00:05] into peace see not that you can remarry
[1:00:08] again he's already stated that but you
[1:00:11] don't have to live with an unbelieving
[1:00:13] husband or an unbelieving wife if
[1:00:15] they're not willing now notice what he
[1:00:17] said if they're not
[1:00:22] willing and if they're with
[1:00:26] him
[1:00:28] now say now you go on to church and
[1:00:33] which woman just said all right you go
[1:00:34] on the man said you and if you want to
[1:00:36] go to down there that's your business
[1:00:39] you want to go to your church you go
[1:00:40] ahead for me I don't believe it and I
[1:00:44] I'll do everything anything for you I'll
[1:00:48] not stand in your way you go ahead then
[1:00:51] you just remain there knowing not that
[1:00:54] you're SA Sanctified life will sanctify
[1:00:57] that unbeliever causing them to become a
[1:00:59] Believer said just remain right
[1:01:02] there go
[1:01:04] ahead but now just to say I brother
[1:01:07] brandom I got married my wife's an
[1:01:09] unbeliever here's a sister over here I
[1:01:12] marry I'm going to leave this one and
[1:01:14] marry that one oh no no
[1:01:19] indeed somebody told me that word there
[1:01:22] how many times it was Fe brother you
[1:01:24] looking for indeed I thought he said
[1:01:26] indeed indeed listen your vow is until
[1:01:30] death you separate and there's nothing
[1:01:33] else in the world permits you to marry
[1:01:35] in the Bible until your Comm companion
[1:01:37] is dead that's right the only ground is
[1:01:39] there's no remaining nowhere at all
[1:01:41] except the dead companion that's all you
[1:01:45] can't make it contradict itself so just
[1:01:48] read the verses before and after and
[1:01:51] you'll catch then what he's talking
[1:01:53] about now this what it means here and
[1:01:55] that see he explained that first y right
[1:02:00] does this mean that a brother are free
[1:02:02] it's no no he explained that first
[1:02:06] there's no such thing as any believer
[1:02:09] ever being reconciled in remarriage
[1:02:12] again with a living companion in other
[1:02:14] words you read that one is conflicting
[1:02:16] in your mind it's all right there's no
[1:02:19] such a thing as an
[1:02:20] unbeliever ever being
[1:02:23] reconciled to to remarriage why because
[1:02:26] they don't have anything to bring them
[1:02:27] they're not Christians all right with a
[1:02:30] living companion so you you can't just
[1:02:32] go back and put this back to that and
[1:02:33] that to that and do this that and the
[1:02:34] other all right do you
[1:02:37] understand all right do you understand
[1:02:40] what I'm trying to say amen that's
[1:02:43] Paul's Grace right according to brother
[1:02:46] Brown
[1:02:47] y now can you read in
[1:02:51] there and see the grace of marriage and
[1:02:54] divorce in 1 Corinthians 7:
[1:03:01] 10-15 can you actually see what's taking
[1:03:09] place see because Paul wound up in a lot
[1:03:11] of
[1:03:13] trouble and we know
[1:03:16] Moses was under the day of
[1:03:19] polygamy now the marriage Grace of
[1:03:21] marriage and divorce never stopped
[1:03:23] polygamy
[1:03:26] right it kept on going until Christ
[1:03:31] came so it was a straightening up of
[1:03:33] what had went
[1:03:36] wrong all right now
[1:03:39] Paul coming into the
[1:03:43] Corinthians right the book of
[1:03:45] Corrections cuz that's what it means he
[1:03:48] had trouble with them why because they
[1:03:50] was married a lot of time they had a lot
[1:03:52] of wives because the polygamy was still
[1:03:55] going
[1:03:56] on and you know remember the women over
[1:03:59] there and Paul said what did the word
[1:04:00] come out from you only they was
[1:04:01] preachers under those old U heathenistic
[1:04:05] worshiping of idals and things and they
[1:04:07] thought when we preach back there we'll
[1:04:08] just preach over here and Paul says no
[1:04:12] way now that's right that don't work see
[1:04:15] Paul had a lot of things he had to deal
[1:04:18] with he had a lot of situations right
[1:04:21] that had to be dealt with and I loved it
[1:04:25] when a brother come here and you may not
[1:04:26] agree with this somebody out there and
[1:04:27] that's your business okay but I tell you
[1:04:29] what I I thoroughly rejoiced when old
[1:04:31] brother the arasmus was telling about
[1:04:34] when they was over there in Africa
[1:04:36] orever where he's from there and they
[1:04:38] found those people that just living in
[1:04:40] the ground they didn't know who Daddy
[1:04:42] was who they just lived together they
[1:04:44] just no marriages or no nothing they
[1:04:46] would
[1:04:47] just and they want to be
[1:04:49] Christians so they went out there and
[1:04:51] started talking to them about being
[1:04:53] Christian
[1:04:54] Chans well after a while they finally
[1:04:56] got around to W really be
[1:04:58] Christians they just went out there and
[1:05:00] said okay who's your
[1:05:04] wife 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you know I don't
[1:05:09] know they said they told him said pick
[1:05:12] you out one cuz as of
[1:05:15] today you're going home with one wife
[1:05:18] and you ain't going to have no h of
[1:05:21] dust and I I enjoy that I thought that
[1:05:24] was wisdom you say well I don't know
[1:05:27] where I thought it was
[1:05:28] wisdom because they had wisdom enough to
[1:05:31] be able to halfway try to straighten
[1:05:33] something out right now I've always been
[1:05:36] this
[1:05:37] too Paul in his day when polygamy was
[1:05:40] legal up until Christ came right and
[1:05:44] then the Corinthians they were still
[1:05:46] dealing with those things did Paul pick
[1:05:49] out tell them you pick out one woman and
[1:05:51] go home with her and throw the rest of
[1:05:53] them in jail
[1:05:55] now I don't think
[1:05:57] so I don't think so got my own opinion
[1:06:00] okay plainly
[1:06:02] opinion if I had it to deal with you
[1:06:04] know what I'd say so pick out which one
[1:06:06] of them is your wife and you go home
[1:06:09] with that wife singular and you don't
[1:06:11] fool with them others but you will make
[1:06:14] a living for them others until things
[1:06:17] can turn
[1:06:19] different because you are a Christian
[1:06:22] claiming to be you mean you're going to
[1:06:25] throw away nine wives or 14 kids by each
[1:06:27] one of them or something and throw them
[1:06:29] out into the world no you'd want to do
[1:06:32] the best you could to supply every one
[1:06:35] of them a
[1:06:36] living but you couldn't live with with
[1:06:38] one of them cuz polygamy is wrong in the
[1:06:41] New
[1:06:44] Testament
[1:06:45] yeah just put that in don't charge you
[1:06:49] let you have
[1:06:52] it let's read a few few things let's see
[1:06:54] we went down
[1:06:56] through and we got to these what are we
[1:06:59] on number six number seven what number
[1:07:00] did we get
[1:07:02] to We got down to number seven
[1:07:10] okay this is uh as it was it was not so
[1:07:14] from the beginning
[1:07:15] 1959 uh paragraph E8 they were talking
[1:07:18] on the subject of divorce as you see the
[1:07:20] previous part of the scripture was
[1:07:22] teaching they said that they had a
[1:07:24] Commandment that the woman should be put
[1:07:25] away for any cause Jesus said Moses did
[1:07:28] this because of the hardness of your
[1:07:30] heart but it wasn't so from the
[1:07:31] beginning we have to go back and find
[1:07:33] out what the foundation is all right
[1:07:36] pull up the next quote but that shows
[1:07:37] you that you got to go back to the
[1:07:39] beginning to find out back in the
[1:07:41] beginning would be one husband and one
[1:07:44] wife back in the beginning was one dog
[1:07:47] one female one horse one female you know
[1:07:50] what I'm talking about that was before
[1:07:52] time even started
[1:07:54] but just in
[1:07:56] case that you want to try to pull some
[1:07:59] other smart elic
[1:08:03] stuff brother brandham said eve would
[1:08:07] have been
[1:08:09] burned for what she
[1:08:13] done but
[1:08:16] Adam didn't put her
[1:08:20] away yeah never were
[1:08:22] right
[1:08:25] come
[1:08:26] on is your mind
[1:08:31] clicking he had never right
[1:08:33] to but he didn't do
[1:08:37] it we're going to find in a minute
[1:08:39] brother around and
[1:08:41] said if you want
[1:08:46] to that's the way clim stat all right
[1:08:48] let's go now he talking about the little
[1:08:51] woman at the way him said she was living
[1:08:52] with her six husband so you see it's
[1:08:54] wrong when you got a living husband is
[1:08:56] it and so forth and going on just for
[1:08:59] any cause put a woman away and marry her
[1:09:02] and go and marry another and marry
[1:09:04] another and marry another one you
[1:09:06] shouldn't do
[1:09:07] that so he said see he said now really I
[1:09:10] don't know whether she was even married
[1:09:12] or not but go on to the next quote we're
[1:09:13] not concerned with that marriage and
[1:09:16] divorce paragraph 84 Jesus in our text
[1:09:18] invite us to go back to the beginning
[1:09:19] for the true scriptural answer now when
[1:09:21] he was confronted with this there was
[1:09:23] two things in view the priest said to
[1:09:27] him can a man put away his wife and
[1:09:29] marry another for any
[1:09:32] cause who he answers it and Jesus said
[1:09:35] it wasn't so from the
[1:09:37] beginning who he answered it no you
[1:09:40] could put her away for any
[1:09:44] cause right now the other part of the
[1:09:47] question was what and then they said
[1:09:50] Moses suffered us a writing a divorce
[1:09:51] which put her away for anything they
[1:09:53] wanted wanted to he said that Moses did
[1:09:55] that because I'm letting that string
[1:09:58] string a while because of the hardness
[1:10:00] of your heart but from or at the
[1:10:02] beginning it was so the question all
[1:10:05] right go on to the next one let's get
[1:10:07] these out of the way and then we'll get
[1:10:08] down to what I'm trying to preach let
[1:10:10] take a Hebrews chapter 6 Book 2
[1:10:13] paragraph
[1:10:14] 303 and listen to what he says accepting
[1:10:17] me to BR as my wife was what love done
[1:10:20] for her what she does in appreciation
[1:10:23] she's a nice woman stays home takes care
[1:10:25] of the children and lives a good true
[1:10:27] life that's not because we're not
[1:10:29] married we are married but she does that
[1:10:32] in appreciation and she runs downtown
[1:10:35] every day and took in every 10 cent
[1:10:37] store and up and down I thought about
[1:10:40] Walmart and up and down the street and
[1:10:43] never wash the dishes or anything else
[1:10:46] we are still
[1:10:48] married watch
[1:10:51] you absolutely when I took my vow that
[1:10:54] settles it she's my wife as long as
[1:10:56] there's life in us she's my wife that's
[1:10:58] her vow but appre but what appreciation
[1:11:01] she does for that she stays home
[1:11:05] what she stays home and takes care of
[1:11:08] the children and tries to be a real wife
[1:11:10] I could run out and be gone all the time
[1:11:12] just getting about over the country and
[1:11:15] let her High starve or anything let the
[1:11:19] children go without something to
[1:11:21] eat we're still married
[1:11:26] right if she even divorces me I'm still
[1:11:31] married as long as there life in my body
[1:11:34] I took that vow till death we separate
[1:11:36] that's right we're still married but yet
[1:11:38] I make a poor excuse of a husband she's
[1:11:41] made a poor excuse of a wife so if we
[1:11:44] love one another we stick together and
[1:11:46] pull the load together okay amen going
[1:11:49] with the next
[1:11:50] one questions and answers 62
[1:11:54] paragraph 109 I am not true to my wife
[1:11:57] because I'm afraid she divorced me I'm
[1:11:58] true to her because I love her there's
[1:12:00] no other woman in the world but her
[1:12:02] that's the reason I'm true to her not
[1:12:04] because if I done a mistake and they
[1:12:07] thought I did something wrong come to
[1:12:09] her say mey Hunley I didn't mean to do
[1:12:12] that she'd forgive
[1:12:15] me now you going to see
[1:12:18] grace you going to see Adam did forgive
[1:12:22] Eve
[1:12:26] okay I know she would I'd forgive her I
[1:12:29] love her and I I'd forgive her now this
[1:12:32] is a prophet
[1:12:33] talking from a heart not a prophet
[1:12:37] talking from a letter of a
[1:12:40] word right I don't know where you
[1:12:42] understand that that's okay but I
[1:12:44] wouldn't do it for nothing I love her
[1:12:46] too much to do it it isn't because I
[1:12:48] didn't tell her I didn't think she'd
[1:12:50] forgive me it's the idea that I love her
[1:12:52] too much to do it first place and as
[1:12:54] long as I love her like that I'll never
[1:12:56] do it and she loves me that way
[1:12:57] everything's okay all right going on to
[1:12:59] the
[1:13:01] next this is for marriage and divorce
[1:13:03] paragraph
[1:13:05] 307 friends and then I'll close let's
[1:13:08] see all right let's get this because
[1:13:09] we'll see what it's talking about
[1:13:10] friends and then I'm closing you can go
[1:13:12] from this that's when this has been
[1:13:14] revealed to me what I'm going to tell
[1:13:16] you right now so don't miss it now I'm
[1:13:18] speaking to our followers
[1:13:20] only I said that while ago and I said I
[1:13:22] come back and read it who has fed me in
[1:13:24] this message not the outside bear me
[1:13:26] record of this before God just to this
[1:13:28] group only right now we are found in
[1:13:31] this mess because of misinterpreted
[1:13:32] theology is that right that's why you
[1:13:35] women married the second time and you
[1:13:37] men because misinterpreted Theology and
[1:13:40] I want to show you something that he
[1:13:41] told me and if God our creator was
[1:13:43] questioned to question and he was here
[1:13:45] on Earth Jesus Christ and when his
[1:13:48] delivering Prophet came forth Moses down
[1:13:51] in Egypt to bring the children out of
[1:13:53] egyp Egypt he put them to put them in
[1:13:55] the promised land and Jesus said here
[1:13:59] that Moses seen the people in this
[1:14:01] condition and he granted them a writing
[1:14:04] of divorcement because the situation was
[1:14:07] what it was
[1:14:09] wait Moses found such as let them suffer
[1:14:14] no need of you looking to try to find
[1:14:15] that in the scripture it's not there
[1:14:17] right okay so you a little trouble not
[1:14:20] in those wordings God permitted Moses
[1:14:23] that Prophet sent to the people to Grant
[1:14:25] this writing of divorcement to them and
[1:14:27] in 1 Corinthians the 7th chapter and
[1:14:29] 12th and 15th verse in the New Testament
[1:14:31] Prophet Paul who met the same thing in
[1:14:33] the church and spoke this this is I not
[1:14:35] the Lord that right because of the
[1:14:38] divorce situation our do conditions SK
[1:14:41] it wasn't so from the beginning but
[1:14:43] Moses was permitted it and God
[1:14:45] recognized it righteousness and Paul has
[1:14:47] had a right also had a right when he
[1:14:49] found his church in that condition but
[1:14:51] now you believe this to be true and
[1:14:53] believe it to come from God and by the
[1:14:55] Vindication of his cloud and his message
[1:14:57] that's brought me this far this far
[1:15:00] should not God upon the mountain permit
[1:15:02] me to do the same thing to suffer you to
[1:15:04] go on the way you are and do it no
[1:15:11] more go with your wives and live in
[1:15:15] peace for the hour is late the coming of
[1:15:18] the Lord is at hand we haven't got time
[1:15:20] to break these things down don't you
[1:15:22] dare try to do it again I'm speaking
[1:15:25] only to my congregation but if you're
[1:15:27] married and God bore me witness of that
[1:15:30] on the mountain that I should say this I
[1:15:33] could say this a supernatural Revelation
[1:15:35] because of the opening of The Seven
[1:15:37] Seals and this is a question in God's
[1:15:39] word let them go on as they are and sin
[1:15:42] no
[1:15:48] more
[1:15:50] now for a few minutes
[1:15:53] as we close
[1:15:58] out I just remind you we wouldn't have
[1:16:02] known about the grace of marriage and
[1:16:03] divorce for Paul but brother ROM had
[1:16:05] told us where it was
[1:16:06] at and then in Reading even what he
[1:16:11] said we cannot take that and just apply
[1:16:14] it Loosely or whatever
[1:16:18] right we can't put it just in a
[1:16:20] situation and just say oh he had it
[1:16:27] whatever brother randam
[1:16:30] said would have to be the same Grace
[1:16:33] that Paul said right and the same thing
[1:16:36] that Moses said would you agree with
[1:16:38] that
[1:16:39] right I don't like that fly flying
[1:16:42] around but it's all right maybe he needs
[1:16:45] marriage and divorce
[1:16:48] too but now
[1:16:50] listen where is it in the Bible that
[1:16:53] Moses gave the right a
[1:17:01] divorce as I said it's hard to even find
[1:17:05] Paul now where is it in the Bible that
[1:17:10] Moses gave a right in
[1:17:16] divorce all
[1:17:17] right now go ahead and pull up
[1:17:20] Deuteronomy
[1:17:22] 24
[1:17:25] it's going to have to be related right
[1:17:27] in there somewhere
[1:17:30] y to be able to understand it because
[1:17:33] this is the only scripture in the Bible
[1:17:36] that the divorcement is
[1:17:37] used in a bill of divorcement other than
[1:17:40] in Isaiah I gave to you the other day
[1:17:43] Isaiah says where is her to Bill of
[1:17:46] divorcement for your mother all right
[1:17:52] now can you read that and
[1:17:55] see the grace of marriage and
[1:18:00] divorce just be honest now look at
[1:18:03] it can you really see the grace of
[1:18:05] marriage and
[1:18:09] divorce Yet brother Brown said Moses
[1:18:12] gave
[1:18:16] it there when a man had taken a wife and
[1:18:19] married her and it come to pass that she
[1:18:20] find no favor in his eyes because he had
[1:18:22] found some un cleanness in her let him
[1:18:25] ride her a bill of divorcement and give
[1:18:26] it in her hand and send her out of his
[1:18:34] house where's the grace
[1:18:44] there okay I didn't give it to them to
[1:18:48] back up but if you will turn to
[1:18:51] Deuteronomy
[1:19:01] 22 scripture we used the other day and
[1:19:03] explaining some things and I just left
[1:19:06] it now if they want to find it and try
[1:19:08] to back up there in Deuteronomy to find
[1:19:10] it but it's Deuteronomy
[1:19:12] 22 and we'll begin reading about the
[1:19:14] 13th verse if they find it during the
[1:19:17] time then we'll look at it if not we'll
[1:19:20] stay on this if man take wife and go
[1:19:23] into her and hate her and give occasion
[1:19:24] to speech against her and bring up an
[1:19:27] evil name upon her and say I took this
[1:19:30] woman and when I came to her I found her
[1:19:32] not a mid then shall the father of the
[1:19:34] dsel and her mother take and bring forth
[1:19:36] the tokens of the DS's virginity unto
[1:19:39] the Elders of the city in the gate and
[1:19:41] the Dam's father shall say unto the
[1:19:43] elders I gave my daughter unto this man
[1:19:45] to wife and he hateth her and lo he hath
[1:19:48] given occasions of speech against her
[1:19:50] saying I found not thy daughter aaz
[1:19:53] and yet these are the tokens of my
[1:19:55] daughter's virginity and they shall
[1:19:57] spread the cloths before the Elders of
[1:19:59] the city and the Elders of the city
[1:20:01] shall take that man and chastise him in
[1:20:03] other words if he ain't right they're
[1:20:05] going to whoop him
[1:20:08] right and they shall inmense or make him
[1:20:10] pay a fine him in 100 shickles of silver
[1:20:16] and give them unto the father of the
[1:20:17] dsel because he has brought an evil name
[1:20:20] upon the ver Virgin of Israel
[1:20:23] and she shall be his wife and he may not
[1:20:25] put her away all his
[1:20:28] days BL so they're picking it up now all
[1:20:32] right and so we go
[1:20:34] down to verse
[1:20:37] 20
[1:20:39] okay we just explained that if the guy
[1:20:42] says you know I married your daughter
[1:20:45] she wouldn't have made no in the
[1:20:48] Virgin they bring forth the things to
[1:20:51] prove her virginity and if they can
[1:20:53] prove it then they go whip the old boy a
[1:20:56] real good time and and then they make
[1:20:58] him pay the father a big chunk of money
[1:21:01] and then he can't put her away
[1:21:04] right now so we go to verse
[1:21:08] 20 but if this thing be
[1:21:11] true and the tokens of her virginity be
[1:21:13] not found for the
[1:21:15] dsel what then they shall bring out the
[1:21:18] damel to the door of her father's house
[1:21:20] and the men of her City shall Stone her
[1:21:23] with stones that she died because she
[1:21:26] has wrought Folly in Israel to put the
[1:21:28] in to play the in her
[1:21:30] father's house so shalt thou put away
[1:21:34] evil from among
[1:21:36] you all
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:41] now I don't think it' be necessary to
[1:21:43] read the rest of these things but you
[1:21:45] read it when you get
[1:21:47] time he goes up and down giving certain
[1:21:51] answers
[1:21:54] about
[1:21:56] situations and you know that each one of
[1:21:58] those
[1:22:01] situations if it was proven wrong about
[1:22:04] the woman she was
[1:22:07] killed
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:12] see
[1:22:13] Moses stay with the
[1:22:17] word brother
[1:22:20] brandham stayed with the word
[1:22:23] right before the grace came right right
[1:22:26] he wouldn't even he wouldn't even do his
[1:22:28] own son's
[1:22:33] wedding see Moses you read in there
[1:22:36] you'll see Moses and they took him out
[1:22:38] and killed
[1:22:40] them now you remember how we went into
[1:22:42] numbers and went through the vows and
[1:22:45] things my point is to get this to you
[1:22:48] Moses had already given them the law
[1:22:53] about
[1:22:55] marriage and how it was
[1:22:58] constituted and what it
[1:23:01] was then when he found them all so
[1:23:03] messed
[1:23:05] up by their misinterpretation of the
[1:23:08] things that he had
[1:23:13] said now come on folks brother brandom
[1:23:16] in what he was a say and you read
[1:23:17] marriage and divorce real careful and
[1:23:19] you'll see that he says real Christians
[1:23:21] real elect people people sitting out
[1:23:24] there with all kind of marital problems
[1:23:26] they said what can I
[1:23:29] do he wasn't talking about this worldly
[1:23:31] people he was talking about real good
[1:23:34] people Moses wasn't talking about this
[1:23:37] every little old
[1:23:39] Israelite Moses laid down the
[1:23:45] law he gave him the
[1:23:47] word brother random had given the
[1:23:51] word and I hope you're listening then
[1:23:53] you can see the grace of marriage and
[1:23:55] divorce and what Moses said and you'll
[1:23:57] see it what Paul done cuz you show me
[1:23:59] anywhere else in the Bible I don't mean
[1:24:01] that wrong I mean it right I want to see
[1:24:02] it cuz I studied 40 years trying to find
[1:24:05] I can't find no more than that
[1:24:06] Deuteronomy 24 where he's he gives them
[1:24:08] a right of
[1:24:10] divorcement because he didn't give them
[1:24:12] a right of divorcement in Deuteronomy
[1:24:20] 22 take him out and kill him
[1:24:25] pretty
[1:24:28] straight wrong was wrong they took out
[1:24:31] killed
[1:24:32] him man went wrong go over the numbers
[1:24:34] and read all them things we just read
[1:24:35] that part down there the show that if he
[1:24:38] accuses the woman and he ain't right
[1:24:40] then they work on
[1:24:43] him but where's the
[1:24:48] grace
[1:24:50] then in the scriptures
[1:24:54] pull back up Deuteronomy 24
[1:24:59] now and really
[1:25:05] read there's got to be a Grace lying
[1:25:08] right here in these verses but where
[1:25:10] else we going to find
[1:25:15] it if you can find it I want to see it
[1:25:18] I'm honest now sure that's that's not
[1:25:19] sarcastic that's as honest as I can be
[1:25:21] in my life I studied 40 years on this
[1:25:24] thing and I want to see it if you can
[1:25:26] find it in there where Moses is it's
[1:25:28] okay to do this or what this and you
[1:25:30] know
[1:25:31] that look when a man had taken a wife
[1:25:34] and married her and it come to passes
[1:25:36] find no favor in his eyes because he had
[1:25:38] found some uncleanness in her let him
[1:25:40] write a bill of divorcement and give it
[1:25:42] in her hand and send her out of his
[1:25:48] house didn't say the kill her
[1:25:51] no right
[1:25:54] chapter 22 he's saying kill
[1:25:59] her now he saying send her
[1:26:02] out send her
[1:26:04] away divorcement is only used two times
[1:26:07] it's in those two verses right here and
[1:26:09] right here and it's used in Isaiah
[1:26:12] whenever I gave 50 something use one
[1:26:15] other
[1:26:17] time the word divorced is only one time
[1:26:20] and that's Jeremiah 3 and 3 and
[1:26:23] 8 uh divorce excuse me the word divorced
[1:26:26] is used four times six times in the
[1:26:28] Bible it's used three and the new 3 and
[1:26:30] old I gave them to you but
[1:26:35] watch let him r or reil or divorce
[1:26:43] me but what would you do if you came up
[1:26:45] with a situation you're Moses now and
[1:26:48] here we come up and there's a bunch of
[1:26:49] us come walking up and they say Moses
[1:26:53] we got this
[1:26:55] problem what should we
[1:26:59] do should we kill these
[1:27:03] women or what should we
[1:27:09] do he said you didn't understand you
[1:27:12] never understood the things I brought to
[1:27:15] you and he went before God and he said
[1:27:17] God what did he
[1:27:21] do now would it not be that Paul was
[1:27:24] saying the same thing Moses said I
[1:27:26] emphasized that while ago Mo I mean that
[1:27:28] yeah Moses said the same thing brother
[1:27:30] random would
[1:27:31] say that go on as you
[1:27:35] are remain as you
[1:27:40] are now look at the grace that's
[1:27:42] extended to this woman now I know
[1:27:45] they've argued that there's no name I'm
[1:27:46] not going to argue with nobody if argued
[1:27:49] this next verse and when she had
[1:27:50] departed out of his house she may go and
[1:27:53] be another man's wife I've argued with
[1:27:55] preachers on that that they said well
[1:27:57] see there he's telling her it's okay I
[1:27:59] said you are
[1:28:01] wrong he is not telling her to go do it
[1:28:05] he's saying she will do it he's not
[1:28:09] saying she may go and it's okay with me
[1:28:12] no but that's what got it all messed up
[1:28:15] with all them different marriages and
[1:28:17] different
[1:28:19] situations Moses what we going to do
[1:28:23] around and said there'd be people saying
[1:28:24] said Lord what can I do do I divorce her
[1:28:26] do I leave her
[1:28:30] I same thing had to be in the days of
[1:28:33] Paul
[1:28:34] right the same thing in the days of
[1:28:36] Moses hon his hearted people sincerely
[1:28:38] wanting to know the truth not just a
[1:28:41] bunch of junk
[1:28:44] that's you don't think I'm right I'm
[1:28:46] still going to make it like that junk of
[1:28:49] Pharisees that come out of the believe
[1:28:51] in the Bible certain way
[1:28:56] right
[1:29:01] right cuz they simply reminded Jesus
[1:29:03] that Moses gave him a writing of
[1:29:05] divorcement he said it wasn't so from
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:07] beginning he never had to answer
[1:29:09] anything
[1:29:12] else but there's no such thing as
[1:29:14] divorce why would a true Christian want
[1:29:16] to divorce his wife or a true Christian
[1:29:18] woman want to divorce her husband
[1:29:20] why for what reason that's right amen my
[1:29:24] whole point has been for what reason
[1:29:27] would you want to do this or do
[1:29:31] that but when it was misinterpreted
[1:29:33] theology that we didn't know the truth
[1:29:35] then there's a lot of marriages took
[1:29:38] place and what are you going to
[1:29:43] do you better run to the grace of
[1:29:45] marriage and divorce believe right cry
[1:29:49] out and pray God reveal to
[1:29:53] me that it's me you're talking
[1:29:59] about but see the reason to say that
[1:30:01] this won't work out he watch the Bible
[1:30:04] is
[1:30:05] right and when she depart out of his
[1:30:07] house that she may go and be another
[1:30:09] man's wife that's not okay for her to do
[1:30:12] it watch now and if the latter husband
[1:30:16] this number one guy and then here's
[1:30:18] number two
[1:30:19] guy he goes out she gets married
[1:30:22] if the latter husband hate
[1:30:25] her and write her a bill of
[1:30:28] divorcement now he ain't got no right he
[1:30:30] ain't he can't plead number one
[1:30:35] case number one case the man has an
[1:30:39] exact right because she's
[1:30:44] unclean number two guys she ain't
[1:30:47] unclean so now you see they just started
[1:30:50] a bill of divorce and Moses knew they'd
[1:30:52] do
[1:30:55] that then they just started for any
[1:31:00] cause number two God didn't have no
[1:31:02] uncleanness
[1:31:06] of number one does so keep it in line
[1:31:09] number one number
[1:31:11] two okay and if the latter number two
[1:31:15] husband hate her and write her a bill of
[1:31:18] divorcement and give it into her hand
[1:31:20] and sendeth her out of his house
[1:31:22] or if the latter husband die number two
[1:31:26] guy dies Y which took her to be his wife
[1:31:30] her former husband number
[1:31:33] one which sent her away may not take her
[1:31:37] again to be his wife that's right
[1:31:42] right come
[1:31:44] on after that she is defiled for that is
[1:31:49] abomination before the Lord and Thou
[1:31:51] shalt not cause the land to sin which
[1:31:54] the Lord thy God giveth to the from the
[1:31:55] earth amen it's not dealing down
[1:31:59] here but what's dealing up
[1:32:03] here this up here is a woman that she
[1:32:06] gets married and he finds some
[1:32:08] uncleanness in
[1:32:12] her something
[1:32:15] wrong referring to sexually wrong
[1:32:18] right okay that's right
[1:32:22] other words she's not a true
[1:32:24] virgin he puts her
[1:32:32] away he's got a reason to put her
[1:32:36] away and he's right he done it
[1:32:39] right you say well looks like that when
[1:32:42] her second husband married her then he
[1:32:44] come along and he would die I like the
[1:32:47] way it says that if the latter husband
[1:32:49] die why couldn't the first husband take
[1:32:51] her
[1:32:55] back now follow me right brother Brandon
[1:33:00] quoting him if I done something
[1:33:05] wrong number
[1:33:07] one my wife would forgive
[1:33:11] me but now what if his wife divorced him
[1:33:14] and married another
[1:33:16] man right
[1:33:19] uh-uh he can't take her back then that's
[1:33:25] right come on he can't take her
[1:33:28] back he can't take her back because she
[1:33:31] mad had she remained a true woman and
[1:33:34] then come back one day the goodness of
[1:33:36] his heart might could have took her
[1:33:39] back but once she got married to guy
[1:33:41] number
[1:33:42] two she was totally defiled and cut off
[1:33:46] from him right amen so is it with the
[1:33:50] denominations right you following me so
[1:33:52] here's the grace of marriage and
[1:33:56] divorce which is a word of God to the
[1:33:59] truth if she hadn't left and went off
[1:34:02] they could have come back
[1:34:03] together sure been a problem but it
[1:34:06] could come
[1:34:07] back Eve done that and Adam took her
[1:34:10] back
[1:34:14] right
[1:34:16] now that uncleanness go ahead brother
[1:34:19] and give a definition of it I like do
[1:34:21] this in front of kids but we got to do
[1:34:24] it okay amen now watch that word
[1:34:28] uncleanness if he finds some uncleanness
[1:34:30] in
[1:34:32] her it's the Hebrew
[1:34:34] word strong concordance
[1:34:38] 6172 now if he's find some uncleanness
[1:34:41] this is some uncleanness fits right here
[1:34:47] nakedness
[1:34:50] nudity sh
[1:34:52] shame
[1:34:56] pudenda pudenda if that's the way I'm
[1:34:58] pronouncing I'm trying that's right
[1:35:00] implying shameful
[1:35:05] exposure nakedness of a thing
[1:35:09] indecency improper
[1:35:12] Behavior
[1:35:14] exposed
[1:35:16] undefended figure te now you remember
[1:35:20] what the scripture says
[1:35:22] Deuteronomy man's taking a wife and find
[1:35:25] some
[1:35:26] uncleanness the Berkeley version of the
[1:35:29] New Testament says and comes to her
[1:35:32] dislike having found something improper
[1:35:35] in her now these are other translation
[1:35:38] right the lza translation says because
[1:35:41] he had found some o evidence of open
[1:35:46] prostitution right in
[1:35:50] her
[1:35:52] all right see we' solved the problem I
[1:35:55] hope in having you seen the
[1:35:57] grace because God did come down on
[1:36:00] Israel and okay what this doing and say
[1:36:01] go on as you are don't try to straighten
[1:36:04] this up leave it alone go on as you
[1:36:07] are and we know they messed it up and
[1:36:09] all of that cuz they've done the same
[1:36:11] thing in this message right they've
[1:36:12] messed it up all around the message but
[1:36:14] brother R said okay to do this okay to
[1:36:16] do that now go back and read the book
[1:36:18] but I'm just trying to declare one thing
[1:36:23] how simple it is women sisters
[1:36:27] girls don't let them boys touch you in
[1:36:29] the wrong
[1:36:35] place because that's what it can simply
[1:36:38] mean if you voluntarily now not somebody
[1:36:41] we've covered in the message all right
[1:36:44] boy grabs a girl rapes her that's not
[1:36:46] her problem no that's his problem kill
[1:36:49] him right
[1:36:54] it's not her problem cuz she couldn't
[1:36:55] help it but she's in the city and won't
[1:36:58] cry they killed her cuz she KN some
[1:37:02] where somebody could hear it or in other
[1:37:03] words she didn't go around and tell
[1:37:05] somebody
[1:37:06] somewhere
[1:37:08] see so the word uncleanness is nakedness
[1:37:11] nudity shame pudenda
[1:37:14] pudenda implying shameful
[1:37:19] exposure now
[1:37:22] you can look on down there and see what
[1:37:24] the word pudenda
[1:37:26] means all right roll that up toward make
[1:37:29] sure everybody sees it brother we'll
[1:37:31] listen on
[1:37:33] up Enda the external genital
[1:37:39] organs especially those of a
[1:37:43] female
[1:37:46] okay the external which goes down to the
[1:37:49] VV word from pudenda
[1:37:52] means the external T
[1:37:54] female Galia how you genitalia
[1:37:59] genitalia external organs
[1:38:04] right that uncleanness there doesn't
[1:38:07] have to be sexual intercourse that's
[1:38:09] right that's
[1:38:12] right girls don't let
[1:38:15] boys touch you in the wrong
[1:38:20] place
[1:38:21] don't do
[1:38:23] it you may have a
[1:38:26] problem if you allow it to be
[1:38:32] done
[1:38:35] right if you're fighting and it you
[1:38:37] understand what I'm saying brother Dale
[1:38:39] is trying to be right not to be wrong
[1:38:40] about it it's just allowing a person to
[1:38:43] Simply touch your
[1:38:46] organs is an uncleanness that's
[1:38:49] right you or to tell your daughters
[1:38:54] that and keep telling them over and over
[1:38:56] about it
[1:38:59] right cuz a woman can go to the bed and
[1:39:01] say I'm a pure
[1:39:07] virgin like Wade was talking about what
[1:39:09] they're doing now todays that they're
[1:39:10] claim that the girls and boys are not
[1:39:12] having sexual intercourse they're just
[1:39:15] having
[1:39:16] oral
[1:39:18] sex you know that way they go up to the
[1:39:21] day of their marriage I'm a
[1:39:25] virgin just
[1:39:27] remember this is supposed to be
[1:39:29] Christian things this is not to the
[1:39:33] world this is not a garbage
[1:39:38] can this is where we ought to be right
[1:39:40] in the Lord
[1:39:44] amen because
[1:39:47] see the man might have a right to put
[1:39:50] you away right
[1:39:54] abely but the main point I've been
[1:39:56] trying to make is one
[1:39:58] thing not for just any
[1:40:01] cause amen Moses had already laid down
[1:40:07] the law that stated a man would be
[1:40:10] killed for them things or a woman
[1:40:17] killed Paul said can we sin that Grace
[1:40:20] May AB he said God
[1:40:25] forbid Paul never was going out there
[1:40:28] and just saying everything's all
[1:40:33] right Moses found the people in that
[1:40:36] condition and said I'll give you a bill
[1:40:38] of divorcement then they started using
[1:40:40] it for just
[1:40:42] anything the real true Grace that the
[1:40:45] man brought don't you think that it
[1:40:47] would be a broken heart for him to come
[1:40:49] up just like I said whether it's the
[1:40:53] right or not you agree different that's
[1:40:54] all right Rahab the Harlot was allowed
[1:40:57] to marry
[1:40:58] that
[1:41:01] General and right out of there come the
[1:41:03] lineage coming
[1:41:06] down now did she do it just by
[1:41:09] haphazardly or was it the fact
[1:41:12] that maybe that Soldier loved her took
[1:41:16] her for his wife and then went over to
[1:41:18] the priest and said what can I do
[1:41:21] is any way sir that I can straighten
[1:41:23] this thing
[1:41:27] out he said there's a
[1:41:31] Grace if you can believe
[1:41:35] it a Grace for you if you can believe it
[1:41:39] you can really believe
[1:41:41] it not for
[1:41:44] everybody everybody won't take it that's
[1:41:49] right
[1:41:52] because if you don't go through the
[1:41:54] opening of the seals how in the world
[1:41:55] can you have a revelation about marriage
[1:41:57] and
[1:41:58] divorce but yet people come into message
[1:42:01] and two weeks into the message they're
[1:42:02] already so holler and I'm free I've got
[1:42:04] M marriage and divorces might
[1:42:06] straightened out how can it be
[1:42:07] straightened out if you don't know what
[1:42:08] it's about right you think it tears my
[1:42:11] heart out of
[1:42:12] you that's right I want to see people
[1:42:15] right and do what's right
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:21] but you see we don't want to go the
[1:42:23] correct
[1:42:24] way brother randam said invisible union
[1:42:26] he said that old husband has got to be
[1:42:29] dead
[1:42:32] amen there's no
[1:42:34] problem no problem with a woman Mar
[1:42:36] another man if her husband's dead but
[1:42:38] remember what we brought out the other
[1:42:39] night and kept on bringing out it says
[1:42:41] only in the Lord right well I just going
[1:42:44] to marry anybody want to only in the
[1:42:46] Lord you're not thinking way that's
[1:42:49] right you children that's in this
[1:42:52] message you order to try to find a wife
[1:42:53] in this message
[1:42:55] amen he said well others didn't know I
[1:42:58] all
[1:42:59] right don't run around because somebody
[1:43:01] else did try to find you somebody in
[1:43:04] this message Amen to be your wife that's
[1:43:09] right but wait on who God sends you amen
[1:43:14] right am not just run off start hunting
[1:43:16] for the first
[1:43:19] one h
[1:43:22] wait on the Lord amen told you I got in
[1:43:25] trouble by saying I didn't like for
[1:43:27] girls to be married at 16 and four kids
[1:43:30] but
[1:43:31] 20 couldn't help it I just meant
[1:43:35] it but if that's what you wanted 16 and
[1:43:38] married that's all right that's your
[1:43:43] business you know but don't come up at
[1:43:45] 20 want a
[1:43:46] divorce right
[1:43:49] yeah he try to find some way of an
[1:43:54] excuse to get
[1:43:57] one I remember Jesus said it wasn't so
[1:43:59] from the beginning let me quote brother
[1:44:01] random did he come on down to say it he
[1:44:03] said and it won't be over
[1:44:09] there it won't be David over there with
[1:44:12] a thousand
[1:44:15] life you said well who's he going to
[1:44:17] have don't ask me cuz they're not born
[1:44:19] again Christians that's right
[1:44:21] you're dealing with an entirely
[1:44:22] different group of people that's
[1:44:25] right right
[1:44:28] yeah do you see what I'm talking about
[1:44:31] Moses gave a
[1:44:33] Grace that's right they made it all kind
[1:44:35] of things amen but he told them people
[1:44:38] how to get rid of things and straighten
[1:44:40] it up and he said don't kill
[1:44:42] them don't kill them just send them out
[1:44:47] yeah and that woman went out she's the
[1:44:49] one that went out done the wrong thing
[1:44:51] by finding another man and marrying
[1:44:58] him the church truth is the truth I hope
[1:45:01] you understand come
[1:45:03] on come on let's stand again I hope you
[1:45:06] see the truth now Sunday the Lord
[1:45:08] willing will get into more or
[1:45:11] less who can divorce you know as far as
[1:45:14] we know it can't be the woman divorcing
[1:45:16] the man right we get in there what
[1:45:18] grounds a man has a divorce the title of
[1:45:21] the night would have been like a
[1:45:22] requirement for a
[1:45:24] divorce requirement of a divorce is to
[1:45:27] find something wrong you know and go and
[1:45:31] do it but mainly I would want us to see
[1:45:32] the
[1:45:34] grace cuz I've been studying this thing
[1:45:36] for over 40 years on one
[1:45:39] thing to find
[1:45:42] out where Moses gave a writing a divorce
[1:45:47] man I knew it was in Deuteronomy sure
[1:45:51] cuz that's the only place it could be
[1:45:53] cuz there's no other scriptures on
[1:45:56] it but then the Lord spoke to him and
[1:45:58] told me where it at told me I to bring
[1:46:01] it to you tonight the best I could
