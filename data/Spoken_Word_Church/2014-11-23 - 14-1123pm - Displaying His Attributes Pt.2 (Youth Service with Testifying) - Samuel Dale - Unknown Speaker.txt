have maybe a surprise today all right you may be seated we got just a little surprise for you come on up boys they're going to have the service this afternoon good afternoon we're gonna um take turns um doing it so I'll go first since we're gets well I'd like to um read from the Book of Jonah stand up now Jonah I believe really I'm reading from this book because it reveals how how God actually showed a man that no matter what he'll still be there with him and he'll take him through the trials that he needs so if it all bow your heads we pray before we read the scriptures Lord God thank you for this day Lord and thank you for everything against us Lord thank you for having the song service Lord and help me Lord and I know I'm not the best at this Lord but help me in doing this service Lord was that and thank you for everything Lord and help all the prayer requests that were prayed Lord and just bless this service in the name of Jesus Christ I pray amen I'd like like to read um Jonah 1 the chap first chapter of Jonah verses 1 through six now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amii saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for the wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto tus from the presence of the Lord and he went down to jopa and he found a ship going to tarus so he paid the fair thereof and went down unto it to go with them unto tarus from the presence of the Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken when the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship master came to him and said unto him what meanest thou sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we shall not perish amen so that we shall not perish not and then and they said everyone unto his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for who cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon Jonah you may be SE I'd like to speak now um how that God in whenever he showed Jonah cuz he disobeyed God he just simply disobeyed him amen but through all that as we read throughout the four chapters how God showed him that wherever you can't hide from God am so wherever you go God knows where you are and he'll he'll still show you the right way that's right and so if you can turn to chapter 2 it says that then God prayed unto the Lord his God out of the belly the fish's belly because he was um he was thrown into the sea because they cast lots and they all it landed on Jonah and so they cast him into the sea and he was swallowed by the fish swallowed by the fish and so he just he was shown that he has to obey God because he was swallowed by a fish and even after that he still wanted to run until he had to stay in a fish's belly for three nights and trust me that really wants you to go back to God when you've been in a fish's belly for three nights and so after he was out of the fish's belly a few turn um in chapter 3 it says and the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time so when God tells you to do something you better listen to him the first time he shouldn't have to tell you a second time and so it says in verse two of chapter 3 arise go into Nineveh that great City and preach it unto it unto it the preaching that I B thee so Jonah Rose and W unto Nineveh according to the word of the Lord now Nineveh so after he listens to God L after he's been went through the bells the the fish's stomach and spit out for three days and three nights so so Jonah arose and went to ninva according to the word that of the Lord now Neva was an exceeding great city of three days journey so he also had to travel three days and God and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown so he's preaching to the people there so the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on zck cloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them for word came unto the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat and Ashes and so they repented right of all their sins and if you go down the chap 4 but Jonah he wasn't happy he wanted the whole city to be destroyed and it says but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the Lord and say I pray thee Oh Lord was not this my saying when I went yet in my country therefore I fled before tarus for I knew that thou are a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and great kindness and repr and repentance of thee of the evil therefore now oh Lord take I beseth Thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live so after all he's been through he wants to die he's asking God to kill him because he wants the city destroyed and so and then the Lord do then said the Lord does thou well to be angry so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shallow Shadow till he might see what would become of the city so he was waiting for the whole city to be destroyed because of all his journeys he went through the fish he went journeyed into the City and the Lord prepared a gourd and made it to come over Jonah that it might be a sh Shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so Jonah was exceedingly glad I mean in that place in the Middle East it's very hot and so I'm sure some shade would really help so the Lord grew it to where it shadowed Jonah and you'd be thankful too I mean it's really hard out there amen and but then God prepared a worm when the morning Rose the next day it smoked the gourd and it withered so the whole gourd was taken out and it's burning up and he's angry and he's been through a well just to get there cuz God said he would destroy the city well the city repented and God accepted the repentance and it came to pass when the sun did rise God prepared a East Wind and the Sun Beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live so he's asked God twice or he's told God it's better for him to die than to live because he's been through all the day and he wanted the city to be destroyed right and God said to Jonah do thou be angry dust thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said I do well to be angry even unto death so he just wanted to die he wanted the city to be destroyed since he's been through the fish and it really shows that he was really angry with God and you shouldn't do that and then said the Lord thou Hast had pity on the gourd for which thou Hast not labored so he has even he wasn't the one who grew the gourd God grew the gourd and he sat when he wanted a whole city to be destroyed but he sad because of a gourd that just shattered him so he was sort of selfish right then then said the Lord th PR neither mest It Grow which came up in the night and perished in the night and should not I spare Nineveh that great City where when are more than 6 score thousand persons that cannot desert between their right hand and their left hand and so much cattle it's the end of the chapter and so God was saying to Jonah why feel sad for a gourd when thousands of people's lives could Depend and they repented and God just he spared the city and he wanted Jonah to realize that you could feel sad for a gourd but the thousands you wanted the thousands of people men women children when they repented so he was showing Noah I mean showing Jonah to his face exactly what would happen so good afternoon y'all forgive me I'm a little nervous so today today I'm going to uh I'm going to tell a testimony amen I'm going to tell about uh what was going on in my life uh before I had the Holy Ghost amen um I had I had a lot of uh hard days in my life and I I I was depressed when I was younger and um it was because of Dreams Dre and and uh ter terrible nightmares and uh things I was seeing and and and uh that would happen to me at night and and things and uh you know how little little children they think um you know you know how they think they're monsters in their closet you know things like that well I thought that was true my mom she and Dad they would tell me me there's no such thing as monsters and there there isn't but you see there there there are demons you know and um I I would have these terrible dreams and there was one demon that would torment me every night and he he was in a black cloak and his face was white completely I was so scared of him every time I on I would just want to scream so I would have these dreams where sometimes he would devour devour me and he would uh torture me and uh I I was awake one time and uh it was dark and I was I was scared of the dark you know when I was younger so uh I had the covers over my head so um I heard my closet door open and I heard something walking towards me and I felt something lay its hands they're cold very cold and felt like death and I felt that on my body and it's just like pressure you know it was laid on my body and um I was so scared and uh I I couldn't talk I was in shock just laying there so um then I I heard it walk away and the closet door closed so the next morning I told my mom and she didn't uh she was like now you're just imagining things but uh there was a demon that would torment me and it was torture for me since I was just a little kid and I said I got I got to do something about this so I uh I prayed and um when I was about 9 or 10 I I I kept seeking the Holy Ghost and finally one day I knew I had it amen and all those dreams that I had completely stopped all the torture and everything it was completely gone there was one last dream that I had right before uh I got the Holy Ghost and um it it all those dreams seemed so real and this this one was I don't know why but it was the most terrifying of all but uh I was laying in bed in my dream and um uh I woke up in in my dream and uh the closet door opened and uh so in my dream I I got up out of bed and I looked in the closet and there was that demon with black cloak in the white face and he was just staring at me then the clock door closed and all that stopped amen and I never had a dream with that demon ever since was completely gone Hallelujah I'd been delivered of that and ever since ever since then ever since I got the Holy Ghost I've tried to tell my friends about uh my friends that aren't Christians about about the Lord and and um I was never ever ashamed of what I believed never you should never be ashamed of what you believe so um yeah that's my that's my testimony amen thank you I just asked him a few weeks ago I said would y'all uh like to take a service oh excuse me I'm not on okay I said would y'all like to take a service surprisingly they said yeah I said okay we'll just do it on the the children Sunday and they all take the service and take over I said if you don't spend too long I'll take the rest of it and do whatever you know but I enjoyed what they had to say I told them I said just testify read a scripture speak a little bit do whatever you want to do because they are the future and we don't worry about how long it'll be or what's going on so they're the future to take over that's why we encourage him to get up here and Lead singing and sing and worship and do things why because you know they are the future all of the kids all these little bit ones even the little bitty ones just standing you know they they're still they're learning and that's that's good we got a lot of little kids coming up you know and doing so we got to we can leave them a a part to where they can have something then that way it won't be just we're in a message that mom and daddy made us have to do they're in a part that they can have a part to do with you know and you and encourage all these kids and things to where that they'll they'll seek the Lord amen until they find him and then it'll be you know it'll be finished so we just appreciate that uh all I wanted to say the rest of the thing is I didn't finish this morning's message so I'll try to finish a little thought with you and uh then we'll just close that I I was trying to make a point with you that you know what caused a problem in the garden was Eve with too many partners too many husbands as we'd call it all right then you turn around in the next stage you see and it polygamy is introduced well don't ever think that polygamy is what was introduced to take away sin because that would be you know double up you would be going into the wrong thing the the sacrifice in the garden was what took away sin there's your atonement your atonement was made for them but you know but God didn't turned around and said well all right I've got that part I've got the uh the sin covered they said now how do I work out my perfect will because he had that he let he allowed us to go into the wrong and he said okay you've done wrong and now it'll be a hard Road and then you can go into the things you know of what was said about it and we earn our living by the sweat of our brow we the women are are bothered in childbearing and things like that and uh but when it's all said and done God is going to have his way amen that's right amen that's sir he'll permit things in a permissive will you say well and that's what a lot of people tell me a lot of times they'll say well I believe the Lord told me to do this and and I don't want to discourage you but I want you to make sure you're right about what you think the Lord told you now if you tell me the Lord told me to go out and do this that or the thing wrong then I'd tell you in a hurry that was not the Lord you know talking to you you you heard another the voice all right but see the thing of it is polygamy was permitted to where that it would bring about the things that would happen the fall brought to pass the Redemption the fall brought to pass you know the the him coming forth himself God coming down and it brought to pass the Redemptive form and it brought to pass the uh there's nothing in polygamy to cover as uh sin uh you know sicknesses uh things like that that's displayed on the basis of God doing it himself through the atonement all right then you know he's a Healer he's a savior he's a redeemer and all like that and see the sex act brought death well don't ever relate any form of sex act to to bring in Redemption because it's not it's not in there for you to think about that and so you can say well I I believe the Lord told me this that or the other make sure that it's right with the word of God make sure you're right in there because if you're not then you're in a worser trap than Eve was in the garden and that's why it says lest the Devil tempt you like he did Eve you know to tell you a lie to tell you you're okay that's why I I stand before a church with a lot of problems saying marriage and divorce you know issues that have been there and all I can do is tell you you search God for an answer because I can't give you one if you ask me I must lay it down according to this line right here which is the word of God I I can't I won't deviate from it I will tell you what this says you know all right but then you must come to the place of of seeking God for the right answer for yourselves cuz that way you can search out the Lord because see grace is what brought the atonement all right you see why I just brought a half a message and I told you I wanted to keep it this to the Old Testament part of to where that when it polygamy was introduced The Prophet said and look what it done it even went into the animal kingdom why would it do that why would it go into the animal kingdom until you'd see those things you know because the animal was a part of the original happening which was the Beast all right so then being the Beast see and I remember a brought around and said he said see there he said animal was a part used in the fall he said thereby then it would come into the part of atonement you know because the animals back there would be sacrificed as a part of the atonement because they were part of that they had nothing to do with it as far as volunteering anything but that doesn't have anything to do with it it's the way God does things and you can't question how he does it right so then as I said now now then Eve with too many partners you can't come over and say well God just got mad at Eve and just said well I'm going to fix it I'm going to give Adam the right to have all the wise he wants now God didn't do that we'll get more into the scriptures the Lord willing Wednesday and some things that God doesn't work like that you may think sometimes that you're punished for what you're do what you've done wrong and it may be true but it's not always true you know just because you're sick doesn't mean you're lost you know cuz you have troubles doesn't mean you're lost it means we're under the curse to where that things are happening so then get away from those deals of that but see you can't as I tried to make the point see why did polygamy come into view it came into view to display the point of God showing you know that through the the man having more than one wife that would show a type of Christ in the church all right and see then once as I ended up talking about it once you come to that place that we're at Calvary you know and then look day of Pentecost coming on the day of Pentecost to me now the way I look at it I believe it that man and wife was restored back like it should have been in the beginning all right see that would put you back to that place not to not to just say the new birth does away with everything of the body cuz we've taught that we've got to come down in the end time to find out how to do away with a lot of these problems in the body that we have but as far as the soul of the individual when that Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost it set the hearts of those people into an order of Christ and in the church Paul would be specific about it and she said talking about the wife to do this and the husband he said and I'm speaking of Christ in the church it's not a polygamy point now that's where that when it come to the New Testament see you don't have polygamy right now we will hold one pointed I won't say no more on but you got to remember that as we'll pick it up Wednesday the Lord willing you got to remember that there's still a uh what do you call it uh effects uh what is another word you could use that there is start still a part about the the uh polygamy deal that we've got to deal with not that it's okay uh-uh now get that out of your mind get it out of your mind that polygamy is okay because it won't work the prophet said no it's wrong but we're still under the part to where like the prophet said he can but she can't now that gets under a point that we'll cover more Wednesday night but the main thing I want to to talk about just for a minute is the fact of of we see that God's plan and purpose for our lives has been fulfilled was fulfilled back there to try to bring it or to start away for it to come back from the permissive will to the perfect will all right now remember this polygamy is under the permissive right amen you haven't got to the perfect don't think that don't think you went from this over here as permissive and then you come to polygamy and you're under no no you're still under permissive will that's right the perfect wheel was on the day of Pentecost when the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into the heart of that individ indidual to set that individual free from sin now it didn't make no difference if that individual was married or or whatever you know it what it didn't matter it could have been somebody in the upper room you know just uh married one of the brothers could have been there that was married but his wife wasn't there receive the Holy Ghost she had to get her own Holy Ghost and see in this you got to have your own salvation not just a point of of thinking about well we're in this situation here no no don't blame polygamy don't talk about polygamy as being anything it was just introduced into the human race right well I now look and it went on over into the Animal Kingdom right the polygamy but now when it come to Calvary as far as Christ and the individual yes I I say Calvary because of the day of Pentecost what I'm talking about right when the day of Pentecost came the individual went from topes and shadows right into the reality of the new birth all right which made Christ and his church inside of you all right but then it's a many membered body so then he's got many members to that so it goes out and he brings in many more and there was 120 the first time but each one of those received the person of Jesus Christ in spirit form into them the new birth all right but see then to show that it was going to go on and he hadn't finished all of it even though he was bringing it to his perfect will as far as the soul right now far as a soul on the day of Pentecost the day you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that soul is eternal all right that Soul doesn't have to have anything to make it perfect it's perfect by the new birth it has a growth development that needs to be going into into the statue of a perfect man yes but as far as the Perfection of that and see then when you come to that it's Christ and his church because each individual represents Christ in his church are you following me 120 in the upper room each one of them represented Christ and his church all right but now then as a whole you back off and look at it or whatever you want to do and you see that it's a many membered body go what are you going to do with 120 of them all just alike you know right 120 Born Again Christians see now you you put them into the body as a many membered body you know one body many member all right and now you can look at polygamy not in the form of of uh one man and many wives you look at it as Christ and his church it doesn't doesn't run into the human race you know what I mean it doesn't come on down past they're at the upper room when the Holy Ghost fell right right from there on down is Christ in his church which is one individual and Christ right but each individual then is an an individual all right then we make up the body of Christ right which is a many membered body and you see then that polygamy is not legal today amen but it holds a part that that it spoke of back there in the Old Testament as being permitted to speak of Christ in the church all right then you couldn't just say that it's one man and one woman and leave it as a whole because you would only have one person saved that's right all right but when you get into the New Testament with the body of Christ each individual in that body of Christ is a person with God together that's hard to understand right hard to comprehend but it's true you know all right see then that way each man and woman can type Christ in the church now if they're correct there's where your marriage and divorce has to come in the marriage and divorce situation has to come in to where that if you can accept the grace you can be brought that way but a man and many wives can't type it see amen it won't work a woman with many husbands won't work that's then it comes down to the basis that she can never marry again right because of the Fall now if her husband be dead we read the scripture she's free to marry only in the Lord so if his wife has died he can marry only in the Lord right all right right but if there's a reason for him to be able to scripturally put her away then he can and marry again right and see then it's still in the type because we'll get to it Wednesday more of doing it and talk about the husband of one wife what about a person could stand up up I know that's talking about a bishop and and a deacon and I know what your rules are there but I'm using it as an example that a man could stand up that he had been married five times each time legally put away scripturally put away he only has one wife right cuz you're not trying to type anymore you get what I'm saying once you pred in the New Birth that settled a tying the rest of it is just the hold over or the part to use to where that when you get into this natural life then you look at Christ in his church and you say thank you Lord for showing me how free I can be because that's the only thing in the grace of marriage and divorce right so you can't go kill your husband you know and say well I'm free he's dead now you're murderer so what's a what's it doing but if he can let it die now what's your point there if he can let it die you realize the new birth if you received it he let that ow you through justification sanctification the bap gives with the Holy Ghost he let that old you die not die like dying like we think about it's the nature and the doings and the beings of that person and we talking about the other day when he give you a new heart and your spirit he doesn't take your heart out he Mellows the heart with his goodness all right the goodness of God leadth thee to repentance the Bible says see then we can get down to see that really David with all of his wives he could type Christ in the church but just remember not one of them women could marry another man but now you better remember something else David and I know the quote run said he married man any woman he wanted to that's true only in the Lord maybe you hadn't thought about that David couldn't go down and just take a man's wife away from him that's where his trouble was with basba he took away the wife he thought he'd cover it by letting as I said a while ago you know you kill your husband you're free David had that idea to start with right he had what's his namei he had him killed then he made a great show in front of the public right that he loved you so much until look at him now he's going to take his wife as to be and that's one when the prophet came to him and said David David look what you've done but look at Grace all at once that Prophet said but David you won't die because it was supposed to been death y right am we'll pick up a few things Wednesday and talk about it but just remember David we think he could go marry anybody there Earth were your Old Testament s people was wrong and that's what they said to Jesus said we can put our wife away for anything and marry again he said from the beginning it wasn't so and will not be so in the end you when you think a guy went up there there and he said I don't like her she's ugly you know I'll just put her away and marry another one now according to God he's living in adultery right I don't care what your law says he was allowed to do the law had nothing to do with God's word even though they used it for their own benefit to put away their wives for any cause if you don't have a scriptural reason listen this is what we got to get to if you don't have a scriptural reason for divorcing a woman just divorcing her without a scriptural reason can put you in a bad shape cuz she will go and marry again and you cause her to commit adultery there's not everybody that just say well it was I just me and my wife couldn't get along I just divorced her and married again you got two two living persons I don't care who you are that's right you better find some Grace somewhere you got two living people well I I I done it according to the word word says except it be for fornication you see why we wasn't taught correctly through any of our lives in organized religion and we just done what they thought was right and then you come in this message and the people do what they think is right and then you say something you ain't going to tell me I'm not free no I ain't going to tell you and I ain't going to try cuz you ain't going to listen if you don't have that's the point I want to drive if you don't have a scriptural reason or Old Testament are new if you don't have a scriptural reason for divorcing you can't remarry Old Testament or new testament so if David I know he married Abigail which would have not been right with a priest coming down to thing but David wasn't a priest but I believe that's her name right Abigail that he married her but remember her husband was dead so scripturally he was okay all right we will get into that more Wednesday night because I love to of a point there but think about it God will take his permissive will allow things to happen allowed us to be born by sex allowed all these things to come into being allowed polygamy to come come into a allowing things and he'll make it work out for his perfect will but I hope you understand what I'm driving at when you receive the new birth that don't clear everything oh now there's where people get it you know they think the new birth clears everything people think the new birth clears their marriage and divorce problem if it does then why did Brother run them out to preach soling that you don't know why I make those statements I make the statement because like I talking to somebody a while ago they can't be no other way right you tell me they can well that solves it that's it yeah but brother I think it's I don't give up what you think if I can stand with the word of God and say this is it I'm not even worried about your arguments I'm not concerned about it I'm standing with the word all right but see David then could have more than one wife but remember it had to be a scriptural reason we think he just go marry any woman he wanted to uhuh he couldn't go out and have somebody killed and take his wife uhuh brother R said Remember the law of of of marriage and divorce is so straight he said that's why that King when he found out that Abraham was Sarah's husband he said look what you put me in he said that is your wife he said that is a law even among among the Heathen he said that you can't go along just anything the Bible's right the Bible tells us how to divorce and how and why we could remarry but just remember the woman can't divorce her husband and she can't remarry unless he's dead because of what happened in the garden that part is still held there to where it's still dependent and you and I are still held under that same situation because it that way you wind up living in adultery but you see why polygamy come into view was as to type Christ in the church not to set the church free polygamy doesn't set the church free the blood of Jesus Christ is what sets you free polygamy was just allowed to where it would be for a time wise but we're still in the bases that as far as Christ and his body is concerned that she's a many membered body and when we get over on that other side do you know that it'll be Christ and a many membered bride amen all I'm going to say it and I'm going to quit because that way you can keep things running straight you can't keep it running straight to way our thoughts are a lot of times like I said to start with maybe that doesn't mean anything to you but Eve with two partners caus to fall God permitted polygamy to come into being now what if he hadn't permitted it to come into being last question what if God had not permitted polygamy you already had the display of his attributes as healer savior Etc don't get that all involved that was through the atonement if polygamy had not been instituted there would have been no Christ in his church right they would have been a Christ in one person but yet because of the allowing of polygamy it would put in Institute a type that would last until the world is over that Christ and his church would be one just remember brother R said he can put us away anytime he wants to that's right he said he proved it in the days of Luther he put them away because it wouldn't continue he said and he married to Methodist he put them away because they wouldn't continue married to Pentecostal so you go through the Baptist the Presbyterians the different churches does it come forth you know it's a great thing and a great understanding to me because it takes away anything related to any form of like the people of the message will say so you don't believe in in polygamy to look out there in the yard that there is a rooster and a whole lot of hens that's true you know that that animal's body came out of the same Earth you came out of and when that Earth is completely redeemed this first right that's right come on am I right this part of the Earth has got to be fully redeemed in a Rapture then the real Earth can be redeemed and then it'll be right everything will be back in order the way it should have been to start with but we should never get a thought in our mind of any form of thinking today that polygam is okay I can go do this remember your problem is when you go do this and say I'm going to do this because you're thinking it out trying to figure it out trying to make an excuse well it's okay for David it's a different Covenant won't work today we're under a covenant today of one man and one woman you got to consider that it is you and Christ together as persons amen and it's not you and your husband and Christ together you and Christ then when it's all finished and the story is completed then it can be a many membered body because that's where it started back there and the top is not fulfilled in flesh I hope hope you're listening animal come out of the ground we come out of the ground it's not finished in flesh until we walk off this Earth and until we walk off of this Earth we're going to deal with whether you like it or not we're going to deal with polygamy because we're going to have people that have not followed the laws of the word to what is a wedding and what of these things are you know we haven't walked according to this so we better believe in grace right not disgrace right but line it up correctly it comes out to be a beautiful picture they get wrong and we got a garbage can he trying to say I'm telling you what the prophet said that's what people want to do isn't it I'm just saying what he says well okay Judas went and hung yourself you go do likewise I just told you what the Bible said but we don't want that right but you know what I done I took two scriptures to make my point then we say I just said what the prophet said I've eat that for 50 years the two Soul people said that the seventh under virture people said that the perusia said that right brother Ray they all said this is what the Lord laid on my heart to be the truth and the biggest portion of them went after polygamy showed what kind of spirit it was if anything do you and I let's keep it straight because we're going to face him I enjoyed these boys I thought they done a marvelous job because they're in training and we're going to need them well we're not going to be around here that long that's what people said 40 years ago right a lot of people 40 years ago said that we're still here 40 years from now these boys would be on up in their 50s right thank God for these kids that will get up and sing and worship and tell what they believe amen thank God for them let's Stand Together come ahead music Ians come ahead let's just sing and worship I told him I said y'all just take your time whatever you want and I'll finish up a little bit on a thought CU it give me an opportunity to finish this morning's message and not leave you dangling to go home and wondering just remember polygamy don't straighten things up right the atonement straightens things up amen the de of Christ straightened things up that's right but look what a situation you'd have had back there that when Eve messed up if God hadn't instituted or introduced The Prophet said polygamy to where there'd be tops and shadows but just remember we are not in the tops and shadows anymore we are in the reality that does not give us a right to just do anything we still got to be by the word okay boys what we got want to be wonderful go ahead won't it be wonderful page 40 it be wonderful that having no burdens to be Jo singing with heart Bells all ring oh it be wonderful there think about it won't it be wonderful when we get there
