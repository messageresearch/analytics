[17:11] Flames
[17:14] again

[17:24] would not get
[17:26] heavy or the hill would not

[18:09] on our Lord will show
[18:13] up and he will take you through
[18:17] the
[18:23] again he never promised that the cross

[18:39] CL he never
[18:42] offered our victories without fighting
[18:46] but he said help would always come
[18:53] in so just remember when you're standing
[18:58] in the valley of
[19:02] decision and the
[19:04] adversary
[19:05] [Music]

[28:32] this and the same day when the Eden was
[28:36] come he said unto them let us pass over
[28:39] unto the other side and when they had
[28:42] sent away and when they had sent away
[28:45] the multitude they took him even as he
[28:47] was in the ship and there was also with
[28:49] him other little ships and there arose a
[28:52] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[28:54] into the ship so that it was now full
[28:57] and he was in the hinder part of the
[28:59] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[29:02] him and said unto him
[29:04] Master carest thou not that we
[29:08] perish but he does
[29:11] care and he arose and rebuke the wind
[29:13] and set into the sea peace be still and
[29:17] the wind ceased and there was a great
[29:21] calm and he said unto them why are you
[29:24] so
[29:25] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[29:30] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[29:32] to another what manner of man is this
[29:35] that even the wind and the Sea obey him
[29:40] Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to
[29:43] speak to you this morning on where is
[29:46] he where is
[29:48] he Heavenly
[29:51] Father Thy word is
[29:53] true we commit this congregation and

[29:58] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[30:02] name God bless you Saints you may be
[30:05] seated this morning I'd like to call
[30:06] your attention back to verse 40 it says
[30:09] and he said unto them why are you so
[30:12] fearful and how is it that you have no
[30:16] faith and as I was thinking about this
[30:18] scripture on fear and faith it reminded
[30:20] me of something that the prophet said
[30:23] brother bam said I thought tonight that
[30:24] I would talk on faith for a little while
[30:27] just to build you up on Christian faith
[30:30] he said I find that one of the greatest
[30:32] hindrances that the church has got today
[30:35] is that they're scared to death and what
[30:37] are you scared about that's what I'm
[30:39] wondering if you'll just only realize
[30:42] who you are amen you don't know who you
[30:45] are you don't know who that is sitting
[30:47] next to you you say oh yeah that's my
[30:49] neighbor I know him all right but you
[30:50] see he's a Son of God see that's right
[30:53] adopted by Jesus Christ into the family
[30:55] that's a daughter of God sitting next to
[30:57] you
[30:58] and who are you if you're a Christian a
[31:01] Believer you're a son or daughter of God
[31:05] then what are you scared about there's
[31:06] no need of being scared so see that's as
[31:09] long as the devil can keep you
[31:13] scared that's all he wants to do he's
[31:16] got you right then as long as he can
[31:20] keep you scared keep you afraid because
[31:23] you don't know who you are am so then we
[31:26] realize that amnesia of not knowing who
[31:29] you are produces fear amen you know I
[31:33] was telling you of my father I lost my
[31:36] daddy several year ago he died from
[31:38] Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's a terrible
[31:41] disease because you lose them twice you
[31:44] lose them long before they pass and as
[31:47] the disease progressed on my daddy and
[31:50] he he he got to where he couldn't
[31:52] remember and uh we had to put him into
[31:55] an Alzheimer's home where they took care
[31:57] of people like that and they was having
[31:59] a little party for him and I I went over
[32:01] to be with my daddy and I rode him out
[32:03] into this room and they were passing out
[32:07] gifts and they called my daddy's name
[32:09] they said James
[32:11] Ward but my daddy never
[32:15] moved cuz he didn't know who he
[32:18] was and I said Daddy you better raise up
[32:21] here buddy they they've got a gift for
[32:23] you it's yours it belongs to you but he
[32:26] never moved
[32:28] right you said now why would you say
[32:30] that because I want you to
[32:33] understand that no matter how great the
[32:35] anointing would be from this pull pit no
[32:38] matter how great the gift would be that
[32:40] stands before you if you don't realize
[32:44] that it's for you it'll do you no
[32:48] good amen he didn't come just to give us
[32:52] the word but it came for a
[32:54] personal relationship with you
[32:58] amen so Amnesia then you'll find a lot
[33:00] of times Alzheimer's patients will get
[33:02] violent it's because they're scared they
[33:06] don't know that person coming in the
[33:07] room they don't know whether they're
[33:08] going to help them or hurt them and so
[33:11] Amnesia produces fear it feeds fear but
[33:15] realizing who you are produces faith
[33:19] brother Bram said Jesus had perfect
[33:21] Faith because he knew who he was in the
[33:24] word amen you know I heard one time a
[33:26] story of a beggar that was laying in a
[33:29] gutter and an artist walked up to him
[33:31] and he said sir may I paint a portrait
[33:34] of you said I'll give you a few dollars
[33:36] and the the old beggar said why sure and
[33:39] so the artist paints this portrait and
[33:41] when he gets done he hands the old fell
[33:43] some money and the beggar land in the
[33:45] street he said well if you painted a
[33:47] portrait of me may I see the portrait
[33:49] that you painted and the man said why
[33:52] sure and the artist turned the canvas
[33:54] around and on the canvas was this
[33:56] well-dressed man and ever hair in place
[33:59] clean shaven and he said the old beggar
[34:02] said who is
[34:04] that and the artist said That's you he
[34:07] said that's me he said well you see
[34:09] that's the way I see you amen and the
[34:12] old beggar said well if that's the man
[34:14] you see then that's the man I'll be amen
[34:17] and he got up and he straightened
[34:18] himself up and walked down the road and
[34:20] I say that this morning that many times
[34:22] we see oursel through our eyes we see
[34:24] our weaknesses and our faults and our
[34:26] failures come on somebody but if you can
[34:28] realize this morning that he doesn't see
[34:30] you that way he sees you through the
[34:32] blood of the Lamb of God and that
[34:34] sacrifice is perfect
[34:36] amen hallelujah we need to see oursel
[34:39] the way God sees us this morning perfect
[34:42] love cast out all fear and love and
[34:44] faith is the same thing see love perfect
[34:47] love cast out all fear which gives us
[34:49] Faith then let us come this morning with
[34:52] this revelation we are not a cult they
[34:55] try to make us a cult but we are not a
[34:58] cult we are not a denomination we are
[35:01] not an organization we are a
[35:05] body his body represented on the earth
[35:09] this morning that's who I am Hallelujah
[35:12] and I can be what my daddy says I am
[35:15] amen oh my then let's come with that
[35:18] Revelation and let our faith cast out
[35:21] all fear because we're living in a day
[35:25] of great phobias
[35:27] everything is a fear oh yeah huh never
[35:31] even heard of phobus when I was a boy
[35:33] I'm not even sure I can spell
[35:36] it there's fear people scared of
[35:40] lettuce look it
[35:42] up fear fear but there's no need in a
[35:46] time a fearful time for us to fear our
[35:50] Daddy has it all in control amen now our
[35:54] scriptures opens this morning we find
[35:56] that Jesus is telling his disciples to
[36:00] get into the boat and let us pass over
[36:03] to the other side now where are they
[36:05] going to the other side why he said so
[36:10] he said so let us pass over to the other
[36:13] side now the reason that they're making
[36:15] this journey is across the water is a
[36:18] maniac he's known as the maniac of
[36:21] gadera and this man is living among the
[36:24] tombs and he's cutting himself and
[36:27] ripping off is
[36:28] clothed he's a maniac they tried to tame
[36:32] him they tried to reform him but he
[36:34] would break the chains and go right back
[36:36] into the tombs
[36:37] again but even though he was in this
[36:40] condition he was crying out for help yes
[36:45] he wanted
[36:46] Deliverance so Jesus got into the ship
[36:49] and he crossed that stormy sea that
[36:52] night not for the mayor not for the
[36:55] mayor's daughter but for a Maniac living
[36:58] among the tombs the call of one needy
[37:02] Soul brought him on the sea we don't
[37:05] need a church full this morning we need
[37:07] one needy Soul can call him on the scene
[37:11] this
[37:11] morning oh Hallelujah Jesus crossed the
[37:15] sea all the way over to gadera to give
[37:18] Mercy to one man amen to one man brother
[37:24] you know when my daughter came home from
[37:26] the hospital she was the only Survivor
[37:28] of a train accident and when they she
[37:31] came home their homecoming from the
[37:33] hospital they invited brother Billy Paul
[37:35] down to give his testimony and he come
[37:38] down that weekend and when the service
[37:41] was over we were standing outside and my
[37:43] daughter Jess is just a little old thing
[37:45] had she actually turned three just
[37:46] during that time and so I I asked
[37:49] brother Billy I said brother Billy would
[37:51] you pray for my daughter and so he just
[37:53] took Jessica up in his arms and he
[37:55] prayed for her and he handed her back to
[37:57] me and brother Billy Paul brandham told
[37:59] me this he said brother Daryl he said
[38:01] daddy always told me that in every
[38:04] meeting there's always one great miracle
[38:07] takes place they said this weekend that
[38:10] Miracle is your daughter amen but ever
[38:13] since he's told me that I've thought if
[38:15] there's one Miracle takes place in this
[38:18] building this morning God let it be me
[38:21] if what that ought to be your attitude
[38:23] amen when we come through that door God
[38:25] if nobody else wants help I won't help
[38:27] if nobody else wants a Revival I want a
[38:30] Revival
[38:31] Lord if you're only coming for one Let
[38:34] It Be
[38:35] Me amen he's the same Jesus this morning
[38:39] he'll come from glory to one needy Soul
[38:42] setting in a humble church tonight the
[38:44] same one he'll every time come to where
[38:47] he's
[38:48] wanted but he'll never come to where
[38:51] he's doubted right well I don't know if
[38:53] he can help me or not don't
[38:55] worry he won't
[38:58] he will never be there well he ain't
[39:00] done nothing for me he won't never do
[39:02] nothing for you with that kind of
[39:05] attitude he'll come every time where
[39:08] he's wanted but he'll never come to
[39:10] where he's doubted then let let's let
[39:12] out ever doubt and ever fear and believe
[39:15] him that's all he ever ask us to do was
[39:19] to believe him amen amen then let's
[39:23] let's realize this morning that there is
[39:25] nothing that's able to stop him from
[39:27] coming when we call him notice the wind
[39:29] couldn't stop him the waves couldn't
[39:31] stop him the storm couldn't stop him the
[39:33] sea couldn't stop him the Devils
[39:35] couldn't stop it there was nothing n o t
[39:38] h i n g nothing that could stop him from
[39:41] coming to you when you call on him you
[39:43] see it wasn't the man's voice he was on
[39:46] the other side of the sea he never heard
[39:48] the man's voice then what was it that
[39:51] touched Jesus it was not his voice it
[39:53] was his
[39:55] face Hallelujah and if his faith can
[39:57] touch Jesus your faith can touch him
[40:00] this
[40:01] morning
[40:03] Hallelujah like the boy in the shopping
[40:05] mall he told brother Ben he said I'm
[40:07] lost as lost can
[40:09] be that's right he said I'm like a coin
[40:13] in a sandpile lost and brother R said
[40:17] but you don't have to stay that way yeah
[40:20] amen you know people don't go to hell
[40:22] because they're Sinners right did you
[40:24] know that amen you go to hell because
[40:27] you won't escap the way we could help
[40:29] being born Sinners huh we had nothing to
[40:32] do with that now so we don't go to hell
[40:34] for being Sinners we go to hell because
[40:36] a way was provided away from hell and
[40:39] you refused to accept
[40:41] it amen well that's for somebody I don't
[40:44] know but that's all
[40:46] right amen he said you don't have to
[40:48] stay that way there's someone standing
[40:51] present now who can find you the minute
[40:54] you are ready to be found and the boy
[40:56] said I'm ready
[40:58] are you ready this morning are you ready
[41:00] for a Revival are you ready for a move
[41:03] of God are you ready for God to touch
[41:05] your life don't doubt him just believe
[41:07] him well the doctor says it's great but
[41:10] the Bible says Our God's
[41:13] greater Hallelujah so if you're doubting
[41:16] him just remember he'll never be at your
[41:18] door but if you love him and want him
[41:22] he'll come anytime you call for him he's
[41:25] ready to come
[41:27] there's one standing present this
[41:29] morning who can find you the moment you
[41:32] want to be found who can heal you the
[41:35] moment you want to be
[41:37] healed so we find the meeting is coming
[41:40] to a close and he tells his disciples to
[41:43] get into the boat let us go over to the
[41:47] other side now he's filling the pool of
[41:50] The Maniacs need so he gets into the
[41:53] ship and Jesus is with them and they
[41:56] began
[41:57] to cross now Jesus being the word he
[42:01] knew all things you believe that he knew
[42:03] the maniac was on the other side he knew
[42:05] he would deal with that tomorrow he knew
[42:08] the storm was coming he knew the Devils
[42:10] would try to drown them he knew the pig
[42:12] Farmers would reject him and ask him to
[42:14] leave he knew all already he already
[42:17] knew all of that but yet he spoke let us
[42:21] pass to the other side now that was his
[42:24] word and the Bible said his word will
[42:26] not return to him void but it will
[42:28] accomplish that which it was sent to do
[42:31] he knew the waves were coming he knew
[42:33] the storm was brewing he knew the winds
[42:35] would pick up but he also
[42:38] knew that his word would carry them
[42:42] through
[42:44] Hallelujah so he finds him a place to
[42:48] sleep and he lays down knowing the storm
[42:52] is coming he wasn't worried he wasn't
[42:55] nervous
[42:57] well why would a man do that if he knew
[43:00] a category 8 Hurricane was coming how
[43:03] could he lay down and go to
[43:07] sleep think about it we get a weather
[43:10] alert about a wind shear and stay up all
[43:12] night burning
[43:16] candles well
[43:19] Glory but you see he had a promise from
[43:22] his father amen over in Proverbs that
[43:25] when thou layest down Thou shalt not be
[43:28] afraid and when thou layest down thy
[43:31] sleep shall be sweet amen so he had a
[43:36] promise it didn't say your sleep will be
[43:38] sleep will be sweet if it's a clear
[43:40] night no clouds he said it' be sleep
[43:43] whether there's a storm or not a
[43:44] storm so he didn't Rel oh God he wasn't
[43:48] looking at the wind he wasn't looking at
[43:49] the storm he was looking at the promise
[43:51] of the
[43:54] word when you lay down and night in a
[43:56] troubl some time and many people taking
[43:58] all kinds of pills just to sleep I tell
[44:00] you the best pill you can take is the
[44:04] gospel well Glory I'm getting in your
[44:07] medicine cabinet you're going to pull
[44:08] back on
[44:09] me amen but we have a promise from the
[44:12] father when we lay down our
[44:16] sleep can be
[44:18] sweet go to
[44:20] sleep go to sleep go to sleep little
[44:25] bride don't you worry I am with you I
[44:30] will never leave your side amen right
[44:33] just go to sleep I mean not now but
[44:47] tonight
[44:51] Hallelujah he knew the storm was
[44:55] coming but he wasn't nervous
[44:57] he wasn't
[44:58] worried because he knew the storm did oh
[45:01] God help the sink in this morning he
[45:03] knew the storm did not control him but
[45:06] he would control the storm and you know
[45:10] it seems like we find every time that we
[45:12] try to do something for the Lord when we
[45:14] try to help someone or try to draw
[45:16] closer to God it's or walk in Obedience
[45:18] of It's Always them times that snags
[45:22] comes and hindrances comes and storms
[45:24] begin to have you ever noticed that amen
[45:27] Satan tries to put up barriers to try to
[45:30] keep you from getting closer to God you
[45:32] know in a racetrack when they back those
[45:34] horses in and they close that gate in
[45:36] front of them do you know what that
[45:37] Gate's called it's called the barrier
[45:40] gate but what does that barrier testify
[45:43] of it tells you that on the other side
[45:46] is a victory line amen so so every time
[45:50] Satan tries to gate you in just remember
[45:53] that's the evidence there's a victory
[45:55] waiting for you
[45:57] amen but it seems like in these times as
[46:00] I was telling the young people yesterday
[46:01] we was talking about prayer that you can
[46:03] go all day without getting a text and
[46:06] you go into your prayer closet to pray
[46:08] and
[46:10] is Satan tried to bring
[46:14] hindrances amen like Moses when God told
[46:17] him bring my people out they shall serve
[46:20] me on this mountain then as far as God
[46:23] was concerned they were already on the
[46:25] mountain
[46:27] am and that same God that said you'll
[46:29] worship me on this mountain he said
[46:30] there'll be a Rapture and as far as God
[46:32] is concerned we've already
[46:36] raptured
[46:39] Hallelujah Moses look at the hindrances
[46:41] he faced bringing God's people out of
[46:43] bondage the first thing he hit was a sea
[46:47] not a creek a
[46:49] sea henders but God split the water then
[46:53] he got three days in the desert with no
[46:55] water
[46:57] amen and then they found water and the
[46:59] water was bitter it would have been
[47:02] better to find no water at all than to
[47:04] find water that was bitter but sometimes
[47:07] I'm convinced that God makes the water
[47:09] so bitter that the only place you can
[47:12] look to is to
[47:17] him Hallelujah but whatever was in his
[47:21] way Moses had the right to speak and go
[47:25] forth God never says to go back we are
[47:29] not to retreat well brother dar it's
[47:31] getting pretty rough around here we are
[47:33] not to
[47:35] retreat look at the armor that God gave
[47:38] us every piece of armor but there's not
[47:40] one piece on our
[47:44] back CU we are never to
[47:47] retreat now I was in the Army I know
[47:49] some of you Brothers Here know that was
[47:50] in the Army and I was in the army they
[47:54] gave me equipment I was in a combat unit
[47:56] up here at Fort bra North Carolina I was
[47:57] at the 18th Airborne Corps up there
[47:59] field artillery unit and they gave me
[48:01] all this equipment to defend my country
[48:04] they gave me a helmet that we called a
[48:06] steel
[48:07] pot they gave me an M16 rifle with a
[48:10] banana clip that held 18 rounds they
[48:13] gave me an m203 which was a grenade
[48:15] launcher that fit underneath the
[48:17] M16 and you would put the grenade shell
[48:20] in there and you stick it on your arm
[48:21] and
[48:23] poop now the reason they gave me that
[48:25] grenade launcher was because the
[48:27] sergeant watched me shoot my rifle one
[48:29] day and he looked at me and he said
[48:31] you'll be the grenade
[48:35] launcher you don't have to be close you
[48:38] don't have to be accurate just
[48:40] close
[48:42] right so I carried it the whole time M16
[48:45] rifle m203 they gave me combat boots I
[48:48] was on A5 Houser that fired around the
[48:52] projectile round that weighed 105 lb and
[48:54] on a Max charge eight green bag it could
[48:57] go 18 miles if my memory served me right
[49:00] and they gave me all this to defend my
[49:02] country but one thing the United States
[49:04] Army never gave me was the promise of a
[49:11] victory come on now now I joined the
[49:15] army for two reasons one to get the GI
[49:17] bill to go to
[49:19] school for the go so they pay for my
[49:21] school in a second was to see the world
[49:23] we was raised poor I wanted to see the
[49:25] world there's no way for us to to do
[49:27] that so I thought I'd get in the army
[49:28] and see the world so I got in the Army
[49:30] and they sent me to North
[49:32] Carolina spent all four years of my
[49:34] military in North Carolina but when I
[49:36] got out of God's uh the US Army and got
[49:39] into God's Army I've been in 32
[49:44] countries I just found out I was in the
[49:46] wrong
[49:48] Army but when I got into God's Army he I
[49:51] found out he gave me equipment he gave
[49:52] me the helmet of salvation he shot my
[49:55] feet with the preparation of the gopel
[49:56] he gave me the sword of the word and he
[49:58] gave me the shield of Faith but God gave
[50:00] me something that the United States Army
[50:02] never gave me he Hallelujah he gave me a
[50:06] promise of a
[50:07] victory no matter how bad it gets he
[50:09] said look in the back of the book we
[50:14] win
[50:17] hallelujah
[50:18] amen hallelujah do you love him this
[50:22] morning the prophet said if you're sick
[50:24] and you can't get well and you've done
[50:26] all the doctor told you to do and you
[50:28] still can't get well you're in the line
[50:30] of duty just go
[50:33] forward amen just keep moving Jesus said
[50:36] let us go to the other side he had a job
[50:39] to do he was tired he was weary and he
[50:41] lays down to rest knowing he's in the
[50:43] will of the father moving across the sea
[50:46] to the maniac of gadera now here's the
[50:50] disciples they're moving across the lake
[50:52] or the
[50:54] sea and they're with him in this boat
[50:58] they were in the message of the
[51:00] hour if I could say it that
[51:02] way they had Jesus with
[51:06] them they were having a Revival
[51:09] testifying of all that they seen him
[51:13] do now here you're going across this
[51:16] water in the message of the hour in a
[51:19] great
[51:22] Revival should be smooth
[51:24] sailing no worries no
[51:28] bumps no waves we're his disciples we're
[51:32] moving with him we left everything to
[51:35] follow him it should be smooth sailing
[51:40] but you see there's one problem with
[51:42] that Jesus never promised that
[51:48] right
[51:50] right he didn't say matter of fact he
[51:53] said we're not on a picnic we're in a
[51:55] battle
[51:57] right he never said we wouldn't have
[52:00] trials he never said we wouldn't suffer
[52:03] they just sung about it right before I
[52:04] came out he never said we wouldn't be
[52:06] laughed at he never said we wouldn't be
[52:08] made fun of he never promised move Salem
[52:12] he never said there wouldn't be storms
[52:13] he didn't he never said we wouldn't lose
[52:15] loved ones he never said we wouldn't cry
[52:17] come on somebody he never said that but
[52:20] he did say I will never leave you nor
[52:23] will I forsake you then no matter what
[52:25] we face in life we do not face it
[52:29] alone
[52:31] hallelujah
[52:33] amen he said let us go to the other side
[52:37] so they're sailing across this sea and
[52:39] as they're sailing across this sea the
[52:42] storm begins to blow in now Peter being
[52:47] a seasoned fisherman no doubt had fished
[52:50] on this water many times been in all
[52:53] kinds of
[52:55] Storms and know out he thought boys see
[52:58] that right there I've got
[53:02] this this Peter was relying on his
[53:05] ability as a fisherman as a navigator
[53:09] all this confidence was in his ability
[53:13] but you see what Peter failed to realize
[53:15] was this wasn't a storm this was a
[53:20] storm but yet his attitude was I've got
[53:23] this I can handle this myself no you
[53:28] can't he built the body in such a way
[53:31] that we would need one another don't you
[53:34] sit in this church and what I don't need
[53:36] nobody in this church I'm sorry the
[53:38] devil's lying to you we need each other
[53:42] the prophet said it's Christ in me
[53:44] helping you and Christ in you helping
[53:47] me brother amen we need one
[53:51] another sometimes us message people what
[53:54] we need to do is just humble our s down
[53:57] and say Lord I need
[54:02] help brother some people been in this
[54:04] message 50 years never been to the altar
[54:06] one
[54:08] time I don't care who we are Pastor
[54:11] preacher teacher evangelist song leader
[54:14] mom and dad there's times in our life
[54:16] that we need him more than we ever
[54:18] needed him
[54:21] before amen the prophet said Jesus was
[54:24] crossing the Sea and the devil knew
[54:27] think about this the devil knew he was
[54:29] on the road to a great victory for God
[54:33] and he tried to drowned him that night
[54:36] and caused a storm to come up and 10,000
[54:39] Devils of the sea saw that drowned him
[54:42] that night and he was tired and he was
[54:44] laying in the stern of the boat and even
[54:47] the waves didn't wake him
[54:49] up 10,000 Devils tried to drown him
[54:53] because he knew the devil knew that the
[54:56] next day he was going to have a great
[54:59] Victory and you wonder sometimes why
[55:01] Trouble Comes if you could only
[55:05] realize amen this great storm began to
[55:08] rise up and as the sails were torn and
[55:11] the ores were broke and the waves be to
[55:14] toss on the prophet said 20ft waves and
[55:16] they were tossed like a bottle stopper
[55:18] out on the choppy
[55:20] Waters in this great storm it way up
[55:23] this way and way back up this way the
[55:26] water coming into the boat where was
[55:31] Jesus it looks like if he really cared
[55:35] he'd be up there with
[55:37] them if he really cared he would have
[55:40] told them the storm was coming he knew
[55:42] it was
[55:43] coming he knew when it would hit he knew
[55:46] where it would hit he knew how bad it
[55:48] would be he knew all
[55:50] things knowing the end from the
[55:52] beginning he knew it was going to happen
[55:56] he knew it was going to
[55:58] happen he was
[56:03] Goden why wouldn't he up there with his
[56:05] hand on Peter's shoulder yeah yeah where
[56:07] was he yeah where is he amen this storm
[56:12] is
[56:14] great why is it happening come on
[56:17] brother the prophet said it only
[56:18] happened to test their faith didn't he
[56:21] say so later so a real child in the
[56:24] testing time
[56:26] do not walk by sight their physical eyes
[56:29] are closed to the things that are around
[56:31] them they only walk by the faith of the
[56:33] Lord Jesus Christ looking into his word
[56:35] and believe it he'll keep every word
[56:38] exactly the way he said
[56:42] it amen you see you can't walk by your
[56:46] eyesight and walk by faith at the same
[56:49] time you've got to walk by one or the
[56:52] other but true Christians do not walk by
[56:54] what they see with their eyes but they
[56:56] walk by what they see with the eyes of
[56:59] their
[57:00] heart and the eyes of our heart sees the
[57:03] Unseen oh
[57:05] hallelujah
[57:07] hallu amen testing times and trials
[57:11] sometimes God let afflictions hits his
[57:13] people to test him for their faith he
[57:16] was testing a saint not rebuking a
[57:19] sinner that's such a good point because
[57:22] a lot of times when Trouble Comes The
[57:24] Devil will try to tell us the reason
[57:26] you're going through this is because you
[57:27] failed
[57:29] God but sometimes it's not because you
[57:31] failed God at all matter of fact the
[57:33] prophet said in Victory Day the more
[57:35] loyal the more
[57:41] testing oh Lord
[57:44] Jesus
[57:46] amen
[57:47] amen get ready there's a storm
[57:53] coming amen not rebuking a
[57:57] sinner but testing a
[58:00] saint he was testing a saint not
[58:02] rebuking a God does that to test the
[58:05] prophet said and that's why you're sick
[58:07] tonight maybe that's why this La of the
[58:09] Revival is to see what you're going to
[58:11] do about
[58:13] it are you going to pick it up you going
[58:15] to make it all what are you going to do

[58:44] him if nobody will say hallelujah I'll
[58:46] say hallelujah if nobody will sing loud

[58:53] basing my Revival on an emotion I'm

[1:05:42] other side right amen was I not with you
[1:05:47] the whole
[1:05:51] time reminds me of the Cherokee have a
[1:05:55] it's called the right of passage it's a
[1:05:57] myth among the Cherokee when a boy gets
[1:06:00] a certain age his father takes him to a
[1:06:01] secret
[1:06:03] place only the father knows
[1:06:06] about just listen to me just a couple
[1:06:08] more minutes I'll
[1:06:10] close and he sets him on a rock or a
[1:06:12] stump and he ties his feet but he ties
[1:06:14] them real loose he ties his hands but he
[1:06:17] ties them loose so if the boy wants to
[1:06:19] get out of it he can and he takes a
[1:06:22] blindfold and puts it over his eyes so
[1:06:25] he can't
[1:06:26] see now the boy must sit there all night
[1:06:30] if he cries out for help he fails the
[1:06:34] test if he gets up and moves around he
[1:06:37] fails the test he must sit there all
[1:06:41] night
[1:06:43] long but if he's true to the test at the
[1:06:47] rising of the sun when the first Ray
[1:06:49] strikes his face he's a man he can come
[1:06:53] out of the ties take off the blindfold
[1:06:55] he a man it's called the right of
[1:06:57] passage from a boy to a man so the
[1:07:01] father takes him out to the secret place
[1:07:04] sets him on the stump ties him and the
[1:07:07] boy sits there all night ain't too bad
[1:07:11] to S 8:00 about 10 you know when the
[1:07:13] dampness sets
[1:07:15] in the cies begin to
[1:07:18] yel when my girls are little I used to

[1:07:30] them whales here we go Oreos and all you

[1:07:42] bear is it a is it a wolf is it a shy
[1:07:45] Warrior looking for a scal easy target
[1:07:48] he don't know so he sits there all night
[1:07:54] long but at the rising of the sun when
[1:07:57] the ray strikes his face The Boy comes
[1:07:59] out of the ties he takes off the
[1:08:01] blindfold and he looks around he's a man
[1:08:04] but it's only then that he realizes
[1:08:06] sitting behind
[1:08:08] him is his
[1:08:17] daddy he had been
[1:08:19] there the whole time that's right don't

[1:08:36] ship with them yes then he can calm our
[1:08:38] storms by being in the ship with us the

[1:10:09] Antioch and aacom and lth what
[1:10:12] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:10:14] all the Lord delivered me sometimes we
[1:10:18] get in physical trouble we can't remedy
[1:10:20] sickness cancer and so forth and the
[1:10:22] doctors can't they don't know what to do
[1:10:24] but remember who's in the

[1:11:09] denomination we are his body represented
[1:11:13] on the earth and the only thing that can
[1:11:15] call him on the scene is for us to
[1:11:17] awaken him in
[1:11:23] ourselves we have a right just as Moses

[1:11:29] time we're moving
[1:11:32] forward amen we're in the ship he's in
[1:11:34] the ship with us then let's exercise our
[1:11:37] god-given right as Moses spoke to the

[1:11:44] rebuke that habit rebuke that thing that
[1:11:47] bothers you speak to the storm speak to
[1:11:49] that Sugar speak to that arthritis speak
