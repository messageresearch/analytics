Description:
1A) - 3 - THE EPHESIAN CHURCH AGE
God tells them to REMEMBER. Evidently something had left their minds. They had forgotten something. He told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin. The origin of the first age was Pentecost. They had fallen from it. They had forgotten the glory and wonder of it. It was time to go back in mind and then in reality. Back to when they could say, “For me to live is Christ.” Back to purity when Ananias and Sapphira were dealt with. Back to the Gate Beautiful. Oh, what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts that defile His Name. Let those who name His Name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God. Look at what you once were in your heart, and mind, and in your life. Then go back to it. And what is the way back? The way is the way of repentance. If a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more. Repent! Bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Prove it by your life. “If you do not repent,” said God, “I will remove your lampstand.” Certainly. A church in that condition can’t give light to the world. Its light has turned to darkness. God will then take away its faithful messenger and its faithful shepherds and leave them to themselves, and they will go on talking about Christianity but be bereft of it.
...
Repent quickly! Don’t hesitate! Evidently Ephesus did hesitate, for her life span was not very long. The glory of God decreased ever so rapidly. It was not long until the city was in ruins. Its glorious temple became a shapeless mass. The land became a marsh inhabited by water fowl; the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid village. There was not even ONE Christian left. The lamp was rent from its place. Now it does not mean that she could not have repented. It does not mean that we cannot repent. We can. But it must be quickly. It must be a true heart cry to God in sorrow, and then God will restor...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to power [Music] around your power Oh [Music] that's our desire tonight right well let's go ahead and turn over I'm gonna read something maybe some strange scriptures for this topic tonight Daniel chapter 2 verse 1 and Haggai chapter 2 verses 1 through 7 it's good to be in the house of the Lord it and yes it is good to see my parents you with us appreciate that oh and I'm sure maybe it'll help me preach a little bit better but tonight I want to I want to take a little subject of the you know I was talking to brother Louisa Sunday and I you know sometimes your ministers kind of talk to one another here I don't know what I'm gonna be preaching on Wednesday night and you just you just get to a place sometimes where Lord you gonna have to give me something you know and so this is what he gave me and it might be we're gonna wait out a little bit deep tonight if that's all right and get into some things I you know last time I preached I got to talking about the seven feasts and kind of want to get into that a little bit more and and see some things but so I'm going to talk about the return of the glory tonight and we'll be reading from Daniel chapter 2 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus as we sing that song holy holy holy Lord all the all the words that we sing to that Lord odda egg goes in our heart Lord of desire to see your glory manifested in your tabernacle in your people Lord Jesus Lord I pray God tonight Lord that you'll be welcome in this little church Lord God is and in our hearts Lord God and that you'll just feel welcome and be able to come among us

be quickened and it'll produce something Lord we come expecting tonight Lord Jesus and my expectation when I come into the house of the Lord as always to be changed and I believe you just continuously from glory unto glory Lord God until finally you give us that final glorious baptism that takes us from the things of this world completely and changes just Lord God granted I pray you Lord that you'll let not this Church to service tonight just be like any other church service but Lord God grant it Lord that you'll quicken something special to us we pray will you ask your blessing upon the reading of the word now open it to us Lord Jesus we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so again I'm gonna be kind of going through the seven feasts but I'm reading from Daniel and Haggai which seems kind of strange let's read Daniel chapter 2 verse 1 and it says and the first year of Darius the son of a higher heiress of the get my notes here so I can read it of the seed of the Medes which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans and the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years aware of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish seventy years and the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face under the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes I'm just gonna skip down to save a little bit of time down to verse 17 where he says now therefore O our God as he's finishing up his prayer he says hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and caused thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord's sake now let's go over to Haggai chapter 2 verse 1 through 7 in the seventh month and the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the lord by the prophet haggai i say and i highlighted the things i want you to pay a special attention to tonight because this is in the seventh month something something very interested in mysterious is taking place in the seventh month and the seventh month and the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the lord by the prophet a guy saying speaking out as aruba bull the son of shealtiel governor juda and to joshua the son of josedech the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who was left among you that saw this house in our first glory and how do you see it now is it come on brother why is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing think about that who who has seen this house and her first glory think about that in the context of what I'm speaking on the return of the glory yet now be strong those aruba Bowl saith the Lord and be strong or Joshua son of josedech the high priest and be strong all you people of the land saith the Lord and work for I am with you saith the Lord of Hosts according to the word that I Covenant is with you when you came out of Egypt see y'all y'all know I get leaky just bear with me a second so my spirit remaineth among you fear you not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and look what he's doing here now and that's in kind of a three-fold way he's doing three things here so pay attention I highlight of them there so you can you get something good and I will shake the heavens in the earth and the sea and the dry land and I will shake all nations so he's going to shake all nations and then what's he gonna do and the desire of all nations shall come nigh tree shaking all nations then the desire is gonna come and then what's gonna happen then I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of Hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of Hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of Hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of Hosts you may be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the work now y'all back there in the back just kind of have your finger on that your trigger finger on that Mouse so you can pull those scriptures back up again cuz I'm gonna refer to them just for a little bit while we well we kind of get started here but I want to keep your kind of keep in the end in your mind what we're talking about is in Haggai he says in the seventh month in the seventh month because if you look in the feast days they're kind of they kind of go that and I'm gonna be kind of real high level tonight uh you know it's Wednesday night and I'm not gonna dive down into every little aspect and detail all the different feasts I'm just gonna kind of lay out the big plan of redemption in the feast because you know as a brother brother Wade and brother Dowley bringing out the seals and and and all the different things everything just kind of ties together and you know you kind of get to a place where you think well you know why do we need to understand Daniel 70 weeks why do we need to understand the feast why do we need to understand all these things that maybe a lot of preachers have made real complicated in things but but there's something in here that IIIi believe I believe God called me to kind of help identify the bride honestly if you and I believe there's something in here some of the mystery in here that that identifies who you are that that when you see it then you begin to realize the day in the hour that you're living in your plan and purpose that you have in your life what you're here for and what God is doing and have begun begins to unfold to you into a living reality where you can see that like like Daniel did when he looked and he saw he looked back into what Jeremiah had written and about what even what Zechariah are not Zakaria but all the prophets that had gone before he knew something was taking place and he knew if Jeremiah had said that they would be in bondage for seven decades and that they were toward the end of that second seven decades then something's got to be taking place and so he got he got down on his knees and I began to pray and fast and call upon God and God help me to help me to be right is there anything in my life that's not right and began to call and and at the end of that prayer you begun to call out that God cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate because when they had gone into bondage the Babylonians had taken out all the ornaments and all the different things all that they've taken the Ark of the Covenant out of there and the ark had become lost when that as they went into Babylonian bondage so he's calling out to God that God would bring glory back to that sanctuary that now had become desolate and I believe it's time for us to realize the day that were and the hour that we're living in if you could look into these seven feasts these seven feasts and realize how close we've got to be to seeing to seeing the body change not I believe we're seeing right now they're coming of the Lord it's not something that we can put off it but yet for years people have put it off of some kind of future event but but it the shout is now the voice is now the only the only thing remaining is right there trump the last trump does our body change to take place and we're right on the cusp of that so now it's time for us to get serious and get back into the word and figure out what it takes for the glory to come back into the sanctuary so that we can see the glory return to be something greater than that initial glory because let's see what I'm talking about in there in the first church age the the initial glory that fell on the day of Pentecost that was glorious that was a wonderful thing but this glory this glory will be something in early clue that hidden manna them boses put aside and said only the high priest can go in and eat of that it'll include something special that was reserved that was set aside where when that white that capstone was opened up in there and the dream that the person had and and and next and that the individual said look on this I think it was brother Branham I'm kind of shooting from the hip here a little bit when you begin to think about with that kind of glory this will be far more glorious than that initial glory but what does it take to have that kind of glory to see that kind of glory made manifest in this church and I'm not talking about just feel good or anything I'm not talking about just you know running up and down the aisles but I'm talking about a glory that so takes over the believer so it conquers the believer conquers everything in the believers life until it conquers their flesh and their flesh is changed that's the kind of glory that's gonna as you see that kind of glory will not come until the seventh month if we're looking in the feast days and into the feast so let's just kind of let's just kind of back up here a little bit and kind of run through the feasts so you got it in the beginning you got the Passover unleavened bread firstfruits Pentecost that's the first four right and what that just to kind of simplify it for you a little bit Jesus died he he was buried and then he rose again and then on the day of Pentecost 50 days later fifty days after the after the resurrection then then the Holy Ghost fell the Holy Spirit fell and quickened the word that they had heard and now you've got something in-between you got this this gap they see there's a lot a lot of mysterious gaps and a lot of people don't realize don't understand you've got this gap between the feast of Pentecost which we're in now because the bride is still fulfilling this Feast of Pentecost we're in the feast of Pentecost but then one day there's going to come oh we say one day but let's keep it let's keep it present tense because right now Israel is back in their homeland the Feast of Trumpets is supposed to drive Israel back to their homeland the Day of Atonement is supposed to Israel is supposed to realize what they had done that realized that they had killed the one that killed a very Messiah the realized that that that the price had been paid with the scapegoat and all different things you realize what's going on and then the last Trump that the sounding of the last truck the kingdoms of our Lord I've become the kingdoms of his Christ and all those things in other words he just takes takes over he completely takes over when you see the revelation of what happens in those lasts in that last seventh month and that seventh months has been hidden from the world the first four feasts were hidden from the Jews they had no idea what took place in those first four feasts the feast of Pentecost the Feast of the firstfruits all those different things but the last three feasts have been hidden for mayor her body and everybody's grasping at straws trying to understand what those piece of mean and so you see even maybe maybe not to be too critical but maybe even message believers well they're they'll see things we're brother Brown said that the the feast of the trumpets was for the Jews only which it was the Feast of the trumpets was we're not going back to the land of Israel but yet you can look at those things and realize that there's something taking place through the bride there's something taking place in parallel like Naomi Andrews and marching back into the marching back into the homeland together they're marching back Ruth is marching back into a spiritual homeland while naming a name naomi is marching back to her natural homeland at the same time and so you can begin to see something taking place but but kind of keeping your mind I hope I hope you're following well I would have kind of you know simplify Fisher Price it down like like we say I say sometimes Fisher Price it down so it's just real easy to understand hopefully I believe God's it the fivefold ministry to to break down these big old nuggets so that they're easily not to digest that there is so you know I believe the gift of the fivefold ministry is you just lay it out so playing that you just about have to stumble over it to get around it you just it's just so so right there in front of you that oh my goodness I can't help but see it and so that's my intent tonight let's pull up a quote number one a because brother Branham I just maybe want to start on this well brother Brown maybe not so much about the feast but he's talking to the he's kind of expounding on the message in Revelation to the ephesian church age where where God is telling them to remember how what you have fallen from remember your first love to look back and remember and that God can restore the glory to you and he says God tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something oh you can't you just apply that to this day that something simple something got forgot down through these seven churches now he's talking to the Ephesian Church hey don't get confused here he's talking to the Ephesian Church age that they had for and how they started off on the day of Pentecost but now we're supposed to be an Ephesian Church we're not supposed to be in a little Corinthian baby church we're supposed to be a mature place Church coming to adoption we're supposed to be applied church that is well grounded in the word and we're supposed to be able to look back to see what we came from look back and have an understanding of what's taking place they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their to in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it they had forgotten the glory oh my we're not supposed to be a defeated church tossed about every which way it was time to go back in mind and then a reality back to when they could say for me to live as Christ back to purity and in it when Ananias and Sapphira dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts to defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God look at what you once were in your heart and mind and in your life then go back to it and what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm a backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give like to the world as light as turned to darkness God will then take away it's a faithful messenger and his faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about Christianity but be bereft of it he said repent and he keeps going on but there at the end he said but it must be quickly it must be a true heart to cry to God and sorrow and then God will restore the glory shall come again the glory shall come again and maybe tonight if there any of you have kind of in a backslidden condition where it's been a long time since you've felt the presence of the Lord it's been a long time since you've been consecrated to God it's been a long time since since you've been in a place where but you come down and locks one another's feet a communion that you feel the presence of the Lord come down then maybe you need to get down on your knees and repent and call out to God and make sure that everything's right with you because God is able to destroy the glory he's able to bring it back to you back to the way it was if you look back and remember how it was when you first met God when you first got down on your knees back in the back side of the desert or wherever it was do you remember I want to bring to your remembers tonight how it was the first time the first time that you met the Lord and remember that he is able to restore there is a balm in Gilead to take to take over to take the thing the things over your eyes that are hindering you from being it'll see the glory of God God is able to bring us back to the way that it was God is able to bring us back in this day to the way that it was at the day of Pentecost but even more so because he's given us more in this days and then they had their he's given us a capstone revelation he's gonna given us a revelation for a body change and all that unfolds in the seventh the seventh month let me get my bearings so think Daniel they came out of bondage that came out of captivity and the glory of the Lord was not there they began to build as a rouble and went as Zechariah and Haggai began to prophesy on the rebuilding of the temple they began to rebuild the temple they began to get everything back put back the way it was but then yet the glory of the Lord could not come into that temple because there was some requirements that we're missing and so you know we talked about repentance and saying how can you repent unless you hear the word how can you how can you how do you know to come to God unless the word be preached and that's why the preaching of the word is so important how could you make one move toward God except the word and so when you get the word back when you get the word back then the glory will come what what was missing was that the Ark of the Covenant had gone missing when the Bible during the Babylonian captivity and so after they got it all built they didn't have the Ark of the Covenant with the tables of stone they didn't have that to be able to put back into the temple and so work how can the glory come and when the glory did come when Jesus himself finally walked into the temple they didn't recognize it they failed to recognize it to you in a second they failed to recognize when the glory did come and I wondered today if we fail to recognize when the glory is among us when the glorious sitting on the pews in the church veiled in human flesh its veiled but it's unveiled it's revealed but it's still hidden it's a mystery that's that's sitting in the pews in our churches that's preaching behind our purpose that's walking through through the offices and on the streets and all around it's walking on two feet it's walking in your your feet it's eh using your eyes and using your lips he's veiled in your flesh and that's where the glory is hidden this glow is glory is hidden in you and I Oh Daniel Daniel long to see that glory be returned to the sanctuary and when it finally was listen let's go back to first Kings chapter eight and let's see how that glory first came into the temple then I oh goodness that clock is moving so fast oh my that's it that's the preachers enemy of the clock right there first Kings chapter eight says then Solomon assemble the elders of Israel Israel now do you see there's a mystery hidden in the scriptures here of what's taking place in this seventh month in the seventh month the first thing to happen that has to happen is there has to be an assembly do you see what the mystery of the Feast of the trumpets is the Feast of the trumpets has to gather Israel they they can't understand what's going on till they get gathered back to the promised land so first thirty first four therefore the glory to fall there's got to be a gathering and so we assemble the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel under King Solomon and Israel that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the City of David which is design oh my god they're putting the Ark of the Covenant you put that word into the temple you put that word into your tabernacle and the glory is bound to fall the the Gloria you want to know how to get the new birth tonight you want to know how to get adoption tonight that is you put the word in there and the glory is gonna fall and all I see and all the men of Israel assemble themselves and the King Solomon at a feast in the month asanam which is what month the seventh month and all the Israel's elders of Israel came and the priests took up the ark and they brought up the Ark of the Lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those that the priests and the Levites a'lamin and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled on him were with him before they are sacrificing sheep and oxen that cannot be told nor number for multitude and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place into the Oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims do you know in the New Testament that it says for you to speak as of the Oracles of God a minister is supposed to speak a church member a member of the bride is supposed to speak as of the Oracles of God because the Oracle is where the word is and so when they put that word into the tabernacle it was put it into the into the Oracle into the Holy of Holies where the word is and so when you have the word inside now you can distribute it out to others out of your belly will become Wellsprings I believe every everlasting life your wealth spring of flowing water and that is the glory of God the glory of God flowing out from you like that river of life it will flow out of New Jerusalem and others can come to you and drink freely of the waters of life because you got it flowing within you because you are the or you are the living Oracle of God you have to live it you are able to speak when when when you have the word you speak it's God speaking that is what the Oracle is to see people people try to fake it or you know out and the witch doctors and things they try to have somebody tossing bones and everything and people come to them but yet they won't come to a Christian like to find out what what's really going in the day and the day and the hour that we're living in let me stay focused here I'm trying not to run down in the rabbit tree for the chair broom spread forth their two wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubims cover the ark and the staves thereof above and they drew out the stage that the ends of the stage were seen out and their holy place before they all crawl and they were not seen without and there they are under this day there was nothing in the ark saying the two tables of stone in other words there was nothing in that Ark except for the revelation of Jesus Christ there was nothing in that Ark except for the seven seals because the seven seals are there a complete revelation of Jesus Christ the complete revelation of what how he's going to redeem you the earth how he's going to manifest himself in you how he's going to take everything back to himself the complete redemption plan everything is in that and that was that was the two tables of stone they thought it was a book of rules but it was the revelation of who he was and they put that into the tabernacle which Jesus put there adorable when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were coming out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand a minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord and filled the house of the Lord and says do you see how the glory of the Lord has made manifest the glory of the Lord was made manifest then in a cloud what will it look like in this day when he comes forth from the Day of Atonement front with that plant with that cloud the smokiness from within the holy of holies when he comes forth to make himself manifest this son of man what would it look like when he comes forth to make himself manifest in a cloud oh but when he came when he came veiled in his flesh when he came to that temple that zerubu had built they didn't recognize him see we think the coming of the Lord we got to get rid of all these traditions that denominations had put in our minds that the coming of the Lord is this this great thing that the whole world is gonna stop although all the cop cars and all the planes and jets are gonna stop because of the coming of the Lord what it's going to be is so mysterious so secret that it'll be like this this this secret trip that Jesus made to the temple that I'm read for you in John chapter 7 a secret that nobody realized he told him he wasn't gonna go but then he secretly went let's read let's go over to John chapter three number three the quote number three where he said after these things I see now now I'm getting worried about the clock come on now here we go I'm trying to be mindful seriously it's Wednesday night and everything after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in Jewry because the Jews sought to kill him this is John chapter three it should be quote number three now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at hand and if you remember the Feast of Tabernacles was the last feast in the seventh month so you got the Feast of Trumpets the Day of Atonement or the feast of atonement and then the Feast of Tabernacles so this is at the feast of tabernacles his brother and therefore said an EM depart thence Hynson go into Judea that I disciples also may see the works that outdo us for there is no man that do with anything in secret and he himself seeks seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world in other words show up why don't you show off to everybody why don't you demonstrate all the things that you can do but this is not something that can be shown off this is something secret this is something that happens in your in your private prayer closet this acceptin that happens in your private chamber alone with God this is something that when you're walking to work the world won't see it something that's happened in secret that's why all of a sudden in Matthew 24 he said one will be in the bed and one will be taking two will be in the bed and one will be taking one will be left two will be in the field one will be taken one will be left it'll be something so secret then all of a sudden it happens that they're catching away and that's what happens at the Feast of Tabernacles because you realize the Feast of Tabernacles as a body change right the Feast of Tabernacles is changing location changing changing your tabernacle and it'll be secret for neither did his brethren believe it in verse 5 then jesus said unto them my time has not yet come for your time is always ready you can go to the feast anytime you want to but I have a set time that this seventh month can take place I have a set time do you realize if there was not a set time the rapture would have happened way back here but he had to wait for all of us their whole whole rest of the attributes of God to be made manifest down through the seven churches he had to wait for all of us to hear the Gospel message to be breached he had to it took time for all these things to happen but when the fullness of time comes then watch out and he said let's read verse eight go you up into this feast I go not up yet under this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words under them he had bowed still in Galilee but when his brethren were going up then when he also up under the feast not openly but as it were in secret cause it's a secret he doesn't do it in front of everybody he goes to the Feast of Tabernacles the body changed secretly so nobody else will know except for this very special group of people who were in tune with the revelation of the hour who were in tune with what the message is saying in that hour you were in tune with what their purpose is in this hour then the Jews saw the method feast and said where is he and that what what stake about how where's the glory what's what's I don't see anything happening and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he's a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people how beget no man spoke speak openly of him for fear of the Jews now about the midst of the feast and I've got these words feasts highlighted because when we get to the seventh occurrence of the word feast in this chapter there'll be something happened that Jesus does that typifies the glory that comes to the Feast of Tabernacles because that's that's the glory that we're looking for right we're not looking for a shiver up our spine or an ice cube drop on our back or something like that we're looking for the glory that will transform our bodies and the Jews marvels verse 15 how knoweth this man letters having never learned Jesus sends for them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself he shall know of the doctrine and so there's a fantastic combat to this idea that's floating around this there in the message today that they y-you don't even have to know anything you don't have to know the doctrine you can just come and sit in your church and as long as we know that God sent a prophet as long as we know that we're in the message then then that's all good but he said if you want to do the will of my father if you want to do his will you'll know the doctrine and I believe now we're coming because this is the out let's be honest this is the hour of adoption time this is the hour of knowing what you're doing here this is the hour of understanding your place in the message and I want to keep stressing it I want to kind of keep beating that this is adoption time because that kind of makes people nervous it don't make people nervous to say it's it's time to get the new birth everybody's fine with getting the new birth but when you start talking about taking an adoption get an adoption that's the thing that we're coming that's the thing that we're supposed to be coming to in this hour oh no nobody better be coming to that do you think you're something special that's what comes into people's mind do you think you're getting adopted I thought we were supposed to the believers of the message we're supposed to be coming to a place where we know what's taking place in this hour we're supposed to be receiving a capstone message and what other affect can receive in a capsule message half are there to adopt you of course now if you say you're adopted then you're not adopted that's the cash if you say look at me I'm adopted that that won't work because it's a secret it's a secret revelation that only you will have it's something that only only you and God know something that sums up there's got to be a personal relationship and others around you you might hear them saying I I don't think there's anything going in the message but you know there's something going on in the message you know that God is restoring his glory he's restoring he's taking it back to the original Pentecost the original faith of Pentecost he's bringing us back to a capstone message is what he's doing back to the what kind of capstone the capstone the same capstone that walked into the temple this man this son of man that revealed himself hidden he was veiled but unveiled in the temple he was there preaching in the temple and they didn't know who he was back to that son of man back to that kind of faith oh goodness where was I let's skip down to verse 23 or verse 22 he said Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is a Moses but of the father's and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man if a man on the Sabbath day receives circumcision that's the law nothing now remember he's saying this on the on the Feast of Tabernacles which is a body change right if a man on the Sabbath day receives circumcision that's your new birth was of the day of Pentecost on the Sabbath you receive you you receive your circumcision on a little personal Sabbath to you because on that Sabbath you entered into your rest and see now he's talking about two different things he's talking about your circumcision your birth and then he's talking about made every with whole every whit whole this is a glorified person that's been made every wit whole if a man on the Sabbath day receives circumcision that the law of Moses should not be broken are you angry at me because I have made a man every whit hole on the Sabbath day every whit hole are you mad at me because I get somebody the holy Burt holy ghost he's saying are you gonna be mad at me because I've given given brought my glory into somebody now on this on the Feast of Tabernacles the judge not according to the appearance but Judge righteous judgment then said some of them of Jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill but lower he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto Him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ how big it we know this man whence he is but when Christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is then can see they didn't know who he was he was he was veiled to them then cried Jesus in the temple as he saw talks saying you both know me and you know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom you know not but I know him for I am from him and he hath sent me do you see not what us what I son of man revelation is if you have this kind of revelation then you know where you came from you know who you are and you know where you're going that's the kind of revelation that the Son of Man ministry has brought in this day then they sought to take him but no man laid hold on it laid hands on him but because his hour was not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when Christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man has done the Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him then said Jesus unto them you had a little while am i with you and then I go and AM that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither you cannot come then said the Jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go under the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am theater ye cannot come and the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst so this is he's saying this at the seventh occurrence of the word feast in this in this chapter about the Feast of the Tabernacles he said if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water in other words out of his belly will flow my glory why because the ark has been put in there the king the tablets of stone have been put in the the revelation of Jesus Christ has been put in there and so he's put his glory in there and out of that out of his belly will flow that glory you see and but but see that we're asking him what do you mean that we shall not find you because Jesus is apparently about to go after his death burial and resurrection he would be about to go off the scene and disappear until what was going to take place in this seventh month he would be off the scene doing the work the mediatorial work of the high priests right I hope I'm not overloading you I don't hear any explosions I know this is a lot of thinking for Wednesday night hang on hang on with me listen let's read in Acts chapter 1 verse 6 to 11 I like to take things back to the Bible we're doing a lot of scripture reading at night because when let's see how come it's important to see as these first four feasts are ending and he left he left the scene I believe it was 10 days before the feast of Pentecost or something like that right there close to the date of the feast of Pentecost and so just as those first four feasts were ending which marked the end of his of the work that he came to do then he goes off the scene and he does something down through the seven churches until finally he comes back on the scene again in that seventh month how does he come back on the scene what is the way that he comes back what brings him back on the scene that what brings him back on the scene is the same thing it follows the same pattern as what brought him on the scene when we were reading about how the glory field that Solomon's Temple that all the Israelites gathered together then the glory they put the word in there they assemble together put the word in there and then the glory filled the temple do you see really how simple the last three feasts are you assemble together a message goes forth they reveal what stick it's revealed to them wants to tell my Ezreal now it's revealed who they crucified who what's going on now that God has paid the price for them and then the feast of tabernacles but what about us so let's just read Acts chapter 1 verse 6 to 11 when they therefore were coming together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight a cloud received him out of their sight so if he went up in a cloud he's gonna come back in a cloud right he's gonna and when does he come back he's revealed on the Day of Atonement because the high priest comes forth on the day of atonement I'm jumping ahead a little bit but hang on and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven but what's he doing now while he's in heaven Paul told us what he was doing he's doing the work of the high priest he's doing the mediatorial work of a high priest when you when you plead for mercy o God plead it based upon the word and he intercedes for you on your behalf a high priestess touched by the feelings of your infirmities that's able to be touched through the trials and the things that you go through in life through all these things but he's our high priest and that's why brother Branham preached the sermon who is this Melchizedek because when he came back on the scene he's a high priest after the order of Melchizedek and he preached him present tense because that high priest is present now priest he declared through that preaching of the word and he preached the words so that so that that high priest could come back not not in a he would come back in in a spiritual seventh month to you and I at the end of all of this thing at the end of all this process because it all started in the first month and it ends and the seventh month will say seventh because this reveals takes us on into the eighth because remember our seven feasts right but then at the end there's there's a holy convocation that takes you on into the eighth and so let's read let's just read some of these scriptures that Paul brought about about the high priest at Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 he said seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession because what he's our high priest of our confession you see how important it is to have a confession not just upon some vague think that's why brother Graham said when you pray don't just let your mind go blank you've gotta have you gotta confess something and that thing that you confess is the Word of God and so the for the glory to come into your temple into your tabernacle you hear the word and then you confess that you speak it you go forward just like David did when he met Goliath he said I'm gonna cut your head off and all that all the different declarations he made for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without seeing let us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need and in Hebrews chapter 9 he said but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for a seat there there's the answer where did he oh he entered in once into the holy place entered into the holy place to not not as though he's sitting up there just kind of relaxing somewhere or whatever but he's doing something he's pretty he's performing a mediatorial work for you until he comes back on the scene in this day that's why I believe that the fivefold ministry will assent to identify the day in the hour that we're living in what God is doing he identify the bride and I want to identify the night that this is the day that the high priest is being made manifested this is the day that Melchizedek is back on the scene he's come forth in the cloud of glory with clothed with a rainbow with his feet of brass and all that everything with a book at his hand a book that you can take and read and open up and see your place in the mystery and identify yourself with the mystery do you see how the bride the bride is because she is the voice in this day she is the final voice under her messenger she is able to identify who she is she is able to identify who the bride is and connect all the dots and see the whole picture if you see and this is in this day and this hour they say it's like the preaching of the gospel becomes greater than it ever has that's why the preaching of the gospel is the highest form of worship because the preaching of the gospel identifies what's taking place this got smells so good and they're good oh how could you fall asleep with something like this come on now neither by the blood of goats and cows let's see forth the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through tonight seat now he's talking about the day of atonement when you recognize that his blood has paid the price for you and made you entire taking you to a higher realm of justification taking you to a higher realm where all is all passed away do you see how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God urge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance now see you see we're following a process because it takes a process to get to the return of the glory to get to a place where the glory returns is just like it was when Jesus himself I'm talking about that son of man glory when the Son of man went into the tabernacle veiled it was that glory was veiled behind him his flesh that's the glory I'm talking about the glory where he's taking us back to that same kind of glory the son of man walking and talking in this age but it takes a process remember the last time I was preaching about how Joseph went through a process and went through where they threw him into him after he got that robe of righteousness after you got that robe of the new birth from the father then he went through this process where he got thrown in a pit then he come out then he got tempted then he got thrown into prison there was a thief on the right and a thief on the left just like Jesus one on the right one on the left one that died went went to hell when they went to figuratively speaking one two went to heaven then he got pulled out of prison and there he was calling he got the the the signet on his finger and he got put on the throne and then he called a Gentile bride and and he and then he then he began to gather his brethren back to him that's the Feast of the trumpets and then they recognized who he was that's the Day of Atonement and then they relived and reigned in the Millennium then they're in and what became Goshen there and that's the Feast of Tabernacles and all of these things were played out and the life of Joseph and you could see it's a process it's a process just like when Eliezer went to call went to call Rebecca he went in and he went searching for where is she brother Branham preaching in all these different churches there might be just one in this church and he went preaching here and preaching there and till finally a little people began to the big fish the big rainbow trout began to buy it by to the hook and they be to follow after the message then I begin to see something was taking place and finally Rebecca she got on the camels and she began to come back and then then she went into Isaac's tent and and and that and see it's all a process to get from from glory under glory but see this process that I'm talking about one two three four feet then the Sherpa seven church aid has happened but in this seventh month and the seventh month it's time for the glory to return how does the glory return like I'm trying to figure out how to wind down here to say how does the glory return now if the Feast of Trumpets is to call Israel back and like brother Bremen said between the sixth and the seventh trumpet there's got to be a bride that comes something mysterious happen something's happening see it just says the Feast of the trumpets is calling Israel back to their homeland parallel to that there's also something that's corresponds to that happening with the bride and what's taking place is that God is sinning he sent a message to call us out he sent us out because see that's the parallel to these last three things it's first Thessalonians with it says that the Lord Himself will descend with a shout a message to gather the people back together a message to gather them back to the word and then avoid the voice of the Archangel si see how that parallel it parallels the day of atonement because the voice is when the people that heard the shout begin to recognize what that message is for they begin to recognize why God sent a prophet they begin to recognize who they are and they begin to realize what the day and the hour that they're living in is and then because they have heard the shout then they become the voice that will call the dead from the ground I hope I'm not blowing anybody's mind here and see when they when they become the voice when they become the voice then that pave is a way there is no inhibitor when the with force of the Archangel will cause the dead to rise from the ground because the word comes to the word and then the only thing left to happen is the Feast of Tabernacles which is the change of your dwelling place but you see you've got to get this all in order for the first there has to be a gathering together then you've got to put the ark into the tabernacle and then the glory can come so first that's why we had to hear a message that's why we had to hear a message that that gathered us together and it's gathering us together even though we're scattered all around the world there may be one or two in different churches scattered all all over the place let's read let's read Ruth chapter 1 you see you begin to see why brother Graham said when the seals open up you can take each seal and run it all the way through the Bible because this process is repeated in mystery form through all of these stories that you read this story of Esther the story of Esther is a story about how this little woman came into Authority and to into a touch she went into the King's it into the King and God authority to deliver the children of Israel the story of Ruth is a story of Naomi and Ruth being redeemed taking a bit taken back and you Ruth you know let's read it I'm gonna go down a rabbit trail Ruth chapter 1 verse 1 now it came to pass it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled it was a famine in the land just like today there's a family for the hearing of the word oh you better believe it that's what we tell our kids we one day you'll be able to choose your church and you better you better take careful consideration of what you do where were you where you set up shop and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was a limb Lac and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Malin and Chile on better effort ice of Bethlehem Judith Marlin means sickness and chilly on means something like that so they right off the bat they they were having problems and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and eliminating Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was or purring the name of the other Ruth and they dwell there about ten years and Marlon and Chilian died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband and see see they they went out into the land of Moab and and and Elimelech and both sons died but that didn't get him moving back to the homeland look and see what I'm talking about is being gathered back to the word what got them moving was not these three people dying they still sit there but what got a moving let's read the next verse then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard and the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread and giving them and that's that's why all of us are gathered here today all of us are gathered here because we've been attracted to this location because of the message of the hours being preached from all over the earth we're being attracted to the word we're being gathered to the word and the word is what gathered us together let me see let me see if I can kind of skip over some of this here because see brother Branham when he began to preach he was preaching together he was gathering the bride up into a bride for him because back in 1962 I love this quote where he said in the endtime seed sign he said this was when he was sharing that five stars had lined up and really really what it was if you look at look back in the history it was the five planets plus the Sun and the moon which made seven stars had all lined up and he said that was a sign in the heaven that showed that something was taking place an infant bride was being formed what was she being formed around she was being formed around the word that she was eating in preparation for that glory to fall upon her he said an infant Church a bride emphysema the power of God had began to fall on her she's taking for him a bride for this bridegroom that three star his perfection of the heavenly father's of the Trinity becoming one on earth among us God's officers becoming one office what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the Word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach a man might not believe that but it's the word just the same though the bride was being formed around that she was gathered together coming into a realization just as the just as Israel was being gathered back into their homeland and you know you start to wonder Oh what what are the seven trumpets well you go and and you know we don't have time to take an in-depth study or anything or look at the examples of things but there's I believe it was the fifth trumpet that the earth and the the grass and all the different things were scorched that all the different things of the earth were scorched and I remember brother I think it was brother Brown I'm talking about how that he knew somebody that fought in war with one or one of the one of the world wars and they said I looked everywhere and I could see and and the grass was scorched it looked like the sky was scorched there was no bark on the trees everything was scorched and and see what were those things done for to drive the Israelites that all the persecution of Hitler and and and and Mussolini and all that stuff going on to get them back into their homeland so you see what day and our living in Israel is back in their homeland and the bride is back in their homeland - what's the bride's homeland the bride's Promised Land is the word of the hour that's why just just like any Israelite that is out of their homeland is out of the blessing of God just like any any member of the bride any church member that's out of the promises of God out of the Holy Ghost in power is outside of the will of God and then we come to the day of Tommen which to the Jews I'm closing down here a little bit don't get nervous on me which of the Jews is when they recognize when they recognize that the sacrifice has already been paid what you think about and I'm just kind of getting to steal here a little bit what the day of was the Day of Atonement is when the high priest goes into the sanctuary and and sprinkles on the altar the seven seven times that the the blood of the sacrifice that he's made you've got the scapegoat remember the scapegoat that that was released into the wilderness and took took our sins far far away and that's the type of they realized that the atonement has already been made for what do you what do you realize that if you're looking at the atonement when when the high priest is comes forth from the sanctuary the high priests coming forth as the Son of Man coming forth with his feet of brass with the book in his hand with with his feet one foot on the land and one foot on the sea having complete power and Dominion over civil and ecclesiastical powers having power over all these thing and he says there in Revelations yeah Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 he says John take the little book the angel said take the book he's got the book in his hand and he comes and he says take the book take the book so that you can see you can look and see that you're identified with him do you realize that remember when brother Branham was preaching birth pains and his pages got stuck together he's playing out a little symphony he's playing out and their acts of a play when his pages got stuck together and he was wondering what's going on here and and a priest came up to and said and handed him his Bible and said here just relax everything is done according to the word of the Lord everything that has done according to a purpose because he's acting out something he's acting out taking that book from the high priest he's acting it out and it's unfolding to see was you see all the things that go part of that Day of Atonement the high priest was the only one that could have access to that hidden manna but he's made us kings and priests he's made it he's given us the right and the authority to go into the interval and eat of that hidden manna that was only reserved for the high priest and nobody else could go at they the manor that was outside in the outer core they would gather that manner but the high priest had access to that hidden manna and now we've got access to the hidden manna that even-even down through the seven churches they didn't have access to they didn't know who is this Melchizedek they didn't know Christ is the mystery of God revealed they didn't know the future home of the heavenly bride and the earthly the future home of the heavenly Oh however that is the future home that it they didn't know all all of these things that have been preached to us because what did the message do the message declared that the Messiah is here that the son of man is here and he's here because he's stepped forth from the sanctuary they look for him back back there in this first church age at the beginning at very beginning when he went up and he was received into the cloud they look for him and they wondered where he went they wondered what was happened we not see him they could have seen him because he was he went behind the veil of the inner sanctuary but now he's come forth and he's been revealed to the bride many don't see him just like they didn't see back there in st. John because he was veiled to them even though he walked among I mean he talked among them but now he's veiled he's unveiled to us and the only thing left is for the Feast of Tabernacles I'll see I'm debating whether to get into the Golden Jubilee or not let me just touch on that real quick because in Leviticus it says that after seven seven seven seven times seven is forty-nine then you got I'm a backup Rundell here hey you don't need him backing up but I'm doing Leviticus 25 verse eight says in doubt number seven thousands of years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seven seven seven years shall be under the forty and nine years right here seven times seven is forty-nine but see that's when that day of atonement when the high priest comes out he comes out on the day of a homer and makes make a declaration what they that you everything can go free what's everything your soul and your spirit and your body and and the earth everything is going free nothing is gonna be held back then shout that calls the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee under you and you shall return every man unto his possession what's your possession back to the Father that he may be all and all back to him everything will be he will consume everything back to you back to your inheritance back to back to the dominion over the earth back to what was yours before Adam lost the right to it back to everything and that's what the golden jubilee is when that when the when the high priest steps out in that golden jubilee he declares that everything can go free I'm gonna read one more thing because now oh goodness y'all cuz now we come to the Feast of Tabernacles which also is in the seventh month let's read Nehemiah chapter 8 see this seventh month the things that happen in this seventh month the feasts the Feast of Trumpets the Day of Atonement Feast of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles are all very mysterious things because they're secret things secret let's read Nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1 through 15 and then we'll be done and all the people gathered themselves here's another gathering all the people gathered themselves together is one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel so you've got a gathering together you've got the book in other words the Ten Commandments the revelation you've got the gathering you've got the book and the people are going to look in the book and then let's keep reading and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month the seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand that the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law see they were attentive back then there was so attendant they could sit through half of the day they didn't complain about you know 30 or 45 minute the church today you know we need to have this real short church services or anything that were ready to hear that book and Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mat Athiya and she my and I'm not gonna read all these names verse five and Ezra opened the book and the sight of all the people he opened up the book for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up and Ezra blessed the Lord the Great God and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bow their hands heads and worship the Lord with their faces to the ground and and a lot of more names and the Levites calls the people to understand the law and that people stood in their place oh my there's a lot we could say about the fivefold ministry here they cause the people to understand the law so they read in the book and the law of God distinctly and gave the sins and calls them to understand the reading it calls them to understand what they were reading just like I'm doing right now look how simple these seven feasts are to understand they show the day and the hour that we're living in and this is what was happening here in this chapter they began to realize the day and the hour that they were living in and they began as we read along I'm just gonna distill it real quick for you they begin to realize that they had never they had not cept celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles in a long time that it had not been celebrated and for such a sister duration and so let's keep reading in verse 9 he said in Nehemiah which is the true Shafa the governor and Ezra the priest described in the Levi's taught that taught the people and all the people this day is holy under the Lord your God more not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send Portia's unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our Lord and neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength so the Levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be aggrieved and all their people went their way to eat at the drink and to send portions and portions and then make great great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared under them do you see what brings is a revival it's not just having the spirit in the church but it's having the words and having an understanding of what's taking place that's what and we we have the recipe for a revival today a word revival a bride the bride is having a word revival now and on the second day we're gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the Levites unto Ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the law and they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded my Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths and the feasts of the seventh month in other words they looked into the law they recognized and they began to understand what was taking place and they realized that the Bible said that there was going to be a body change the Bible said in first corinthians chapter 15 where it says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed they looked into the book and realized that there was a mystery of a body changed like Paul preached to the Thessalonians for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven verse 15 first that we would see alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord and as the musicians come I'm just wrapping this up here if you see they caught the revelation of the day in the hour that they were living in and then they they began to build booths for themselves they began to go they took that revelation and they began to do something with it they began to exercise their faith but do you see how the shout and the voice and the Trump parallels what's happening here in these last three feasts the shout and the voice in that shout the voice in the Trump was given for you just as these three feasts were given to Israel to gather you back together to reveal to you who you are to call the dead from the graves and then to change your mortal body amen if you can stand now and we'll just I'm gonna I'm gonna end right there I know I come to a screeching halt sometime God is good at any Amen coming down on the Word of God [Music] where the Saints are out of this he invites his chosen people come and dine with as many Danny Moses sweet deceptive Jesus all the time come and MasterCard [Music] he said Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] instead Jesus [Music] Wood will be a glorious side all the saints in spotless white and with Jesus and feasting her man and the master garlic cumin you made these that Jesus table all the time [Music] a man blue come and died you know that was something that he did when he turned the water into wine he took water the type of the word and turned it into a stimulation a stimulating thing that's exactly what he's doing we were coming to the house of the Lord we he the word is already anointed and when they anointed word because it came from an anointed vessel and when that anointed word strikes an anointed person something's got to happen oh that's why that's why we've got the recipe for revival because we've got the recipe for something that stimulates we've got the word in this hour a man you believe it [Music] [Music] sister this is [Music] [Music] sister [Music] he's surely been good to me [Music] we've shown what this world [Music] shoulda been good to me you say my Solomon she shall be good to me you say my soul should

turning back now we've come too far amen oh you have anything to say brother all hearts and minds clear everybody good well let's just bow our heads and then we'll be dismissed we thank you Lord God
