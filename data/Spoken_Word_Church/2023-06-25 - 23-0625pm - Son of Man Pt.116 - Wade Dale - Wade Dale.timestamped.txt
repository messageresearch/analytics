[21:42] that a little bit later
[21:43] so it's almost July already
[21:46] so another Year's heading out here
[21:49] but we're one day closer
[21:52] we're one day closer to getting out of
[21:54] here one day
[21:56] one day closer one 24-hour day so let's
[21:59] pray
[22:00] dear Lord thank you for giving us this
[22:02] day
[22:04] and as we were told to pray give us this
[22:06] day
[22:07] Our Daily Bread Lord and we know that
[22:11] John said on the Isle of Patmos that he
[22:13] was in the Lord's day so it's not a
[22:15] 24-hour day but
[22:17] it's a day that you are present
[22:20] and Lord I pray that you would show your
[22:22] presence today Lord into speaking of
[22:25] your word and the hearing and the
[22:26] revealing of your word
[22:28] Lord in the revealing of our healing
[22:30] Lord we all in this building need
[22:32] something in our body
[22:34] for you to touch and Lord we pray that
[22:36] you'll touch us father
[22:38] and be with us now in the further in
[22:40] this service be with each one that's
[22:41] sick and not with us ones that are on
[22:43] vacation the ones that are traveling
[22:45] Lord we pray that you keep your hand on
[22:48] them Lord as they travel back home Lord
[22:51] forgive us of our sins and our many
[22:52] mistakes be with us in this service in
[22:55] Jesus name
[22:56] hey Matt
[22:58] in the beginning was the word the word
[23:00] was with God and the Word was God and
[23:03] that word is fixing to form somewhere
[23:06] and was made flesh and dwelt among us
[23:08] and we behold his glory the glory the
[23:10] only begotten of the father
[23:11] full of grace and truth she may be
[23:14] seated
[23:15] Lord has blessing to the reading of the
[23:17] word
[23:19] Philippians 2 verse 3 because we're
[23:21] going to get to this I hope this
[23:23] afternoon it says let nothing be done
[23:25] through Strife for vainglory
[23:27] but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[23:31] other better than themselves
[23:34] all right so we're talking where when
[23:36] you get to that word selfish
[23:39] that takes that out of the way if you
[23:41] esteem others better than yourself you
[23:45] have took selfishness out of the way
[23:47] because look at that last word
[23:49] themselves
[23:52] you esteem someone else better than you
[23:55] II Peter 1 verse 5 we know that we're
[23:58] heading down let's keep on going because
[24:00] now we've went from godliness now we're
[24:02] parked on brotherly kindness but just
[24:04] remember I want you to remember
[24:06] that that God told us through a prophet
[24:10] God told us in the Bible he told us
[24:12] through all the prophets that there
[24:13] would come a day that there would be a
[24:15] bride on the earth that would be without
[24:17] spot or wrinkle not that we were going
[24:20] to go to heaven and get that but that
[24:21] somebody's going to come to that here on
[24:23] this side
[24:25] so someone is going to have to come to
[24:27] completion Perfection uh that Genesis 1
[24:30] 26 man in full view as we were talking
[24:33] about this morning that's very important
[24:37] that Genesis 1 26 man is your new birth
[24:39] that is your and we're going to read it
[24:41] in just a minute brother random talks
[24:43] about all these other loves being
[24:45] created because remember in the Garden
[24:47] of Eden
[24:49] you started with agape love there was
[24:51] love that and it was no perversion there
[24:55] was no they were both naked and I'm sure
[24:57] they both sat around and talked with
[24:58] each other and they all had they've held
[25:00] hands or they were husband and wife but
[25:03] with that Holy Ghost Veil on them there
[25:04] was nothing to
[25:06] um just try to make it clean or bank at
[25:09] PG there was nothing there to to to make
[25:12] them do what they did later on right all
[25:14] right because they had a holy ghost Veil
[25:16] so see you get the Holy Ghost it'll help
[25:18] you I promise you it'll help you with
[25:20] your desires and your lust and your
[25:22] wants and all those different things I
[25:24] said it would help you you're still a
[25:26] free moral agent you still live in a I
[25:28] was going to say a dog body you still
[25:30] live in a human animal body
[25:33] so do I
[25:35] let's just be honest we don't we can't
[25:37] walk around like this all the time you
[25:39] know
[25:40] that's right because you know let me let
[25:41] me let me just let you in a little
[25:43] secret life lesson 473
[25:46] that's why the priest and and the
[25:48] Catholic priest
[25:49] do what they do
[25:51] there's a desire in man to procreate
[25:54] there's a desired man to get with a
[25:56] woman and are you white and procreate
[25:59] right
[26:00] but when that's when they told in the
[26:02] Catholic church that you can't have a
[26:03] wife they got to fulfill their desire
[26:06] somehow and that's what gets down to
[26:08] perversion as we talk about brother
[26:09] Brown so that was created not by God
[26:12] it was created by the devil that love is
[26:16] turned to lust and all that other stuff
[26:18] if they would let them priests have
[26:20] wives they wouldn't do the things they
[26:21] do amen because that's where to get into
[26:24] trouble but you see though it's the
[26:26] perversion of the doctrine that they've
[26:28] been told that you got to stay single
[26:31] man I don't understand that they said
[26:33] Peter was the first pope he had a mama I
[26:36] mean he had a mother-in-law right so he
[26:39] was married
[26:40] you see how perverted that is though
[26:42] because we just say oh well okay it's
[26:44] the Catholic church and they tell us to
[26:45] do this and that's what we do no
[26:47] if you'll get Christ in you as we're
[26:50] looking here today if you'll get Christ
[26:51] in you the hope of glory there's only
[26:53] one way that God's going to totally
[26:55] identify himself in the end time is
[26:58] through me and you
[27:00] in human flesh
[27:04] in a animal body
[27:06] that's what we all are brother Ram tells
[27:08] us we're animal flesh that's why we come
[27:10] to the higher order of creative
[27:12] evolution is he created the animals in
[27:15] human flesh and then he created man in
[27:17] his own image though and he created us
[27:19] Spirit man first
[27:22] then he put this in too
[27:24] the Genesis 2 7 man which was a body of
[27:27] Flesh which is animal flesh a higher
[27:30] form of Flesh and then there's where man
[27:33] fell and God knew that
[27:36] but he could not display his attributes
[27:40] or any of these right here
[27:43] you all know if we didn't have a fall
[27:45] there wouldn't even be a Bible
[27:48] if there was no fall there wouldn't be a
[27:49] Bible
[27:51] there would be no need to make one
[27:53] you would be the children of God and God
[27:55] had you all in his mind and you came in
[27:57] in continuance uh Adam and Eve gets
[28:00] together speak the word of God hear you
[28:01] come and here you are and that's when
[28:03] you just start living in a life and then
[28:05] all of a sudden your body is going to be
[28:06] made Eternal somewhere down the road
[28:08] isn't that what brother Brown was
[28:09] talking about their news was being
[28:11] renewed this didn't have to be renewed
[28:13] this is the Genesis 1 26 man the Eternal
[28:17] part of God
[28:18] amen can't lose that God will never give
[28:22] you eternal life and take it away from
[28:24] you he didn't give eternal life to Adam
[28:26] and take it away from him he didn't give
[28:27] it to Eve as bad as what she did he did
[28:29] not take it away from her he took away
[28:32] from her the ability for the whole form
[28:34] to be Eternal because that's what we're
[28:37] going back to the whole form of me is
[28:39] going to be Eternal the whole form of
[28:41] you is going to be made Eternal that's
[28:44] Body Spirit and soul everybody with me
[28:47] but it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[28:49] whom we preach
[28:53] you know I was
[28:57] just a few minutes ago everybody know
[28:59] who's Adrian who Adrian Rogers is
[29:02] most of you do but he was a wonderful he
[29:06] was a he'd have been a good message
[29:07] believer but he was a good preacher he
[29:09] was kind of like the Charles Stanley and
[29:11] the different one but Adrian Rogers was
[29:13] um he was a a pastor of a church and he
[29:17] was kind of the first one that really I
[29:18] think went online and and and not online
[29:21] but they recorded his sermons and he
[29:23] they put it alive anyway he was
[29:25] preaching a few minutes ago I was
[29:26] watching it
[29:27] it's a striking thing
[29:31] he said you know he said
[29:34] he said if you don't make Church
[29:37] important
[29:39] okay
[29:40] then your kids are going to look at you
[29:43] all right if your kids look at you and
[29:45] see that you don't think church is
[29:47] important
[29:49] they don't think church is important
[29:52] that's why it's parental delinquency
[29:54] brother round said the the adults quit
[29:56] going to church in brother Brown was
[29:59] time and that's why he would look at him
[30:00] and say hey it's not a kid's problem
[30:02] it's your problem
[30:04] but if you don't make that important but
[30:06] if you make it important
[30:08] then the kids are going to see that it's
[30:10] important and that generation that's why
[30:12] the generations of churches are you know
[30:14] falling apart and different things oh
[30:16] yeah there's a lot of people going to
[30:17] church but are they really going to
[30:19] church
[30:21] and I I like what he said you know he
[30:23] said you got to make it a priority
[30:25] because if you don't make it a priority
[30:26] then it's not going to be a priority to
[30:28] your kids
[30:30] and that's pretty simple I mean you we
[30:32] try to say well we need to come to
[30:34] church yeah I I thought coming and being
[30:37] a Christian was living for others
[30:41] I come to church to live for others I
[30:43] come to church to bring something to you
[30:45] fellowship with you watch your kids grow
[30:48] up that's what brother Dale did for a
[30:49] generation
[30:50] he watched it Generations grow up and
[30:54] and still sitting here most of them
[30:57] but why do we make important when I when
[31:00] I said whom we preach look warning every
[31:02] man
[31:03] there's a warning love has a warning to
[31:06] it and listen true agape love
[31:10] is weird
[31:13] according to humanity
[31:15] agape love is weird because then nobody
[31:17] likes it Jesus was the epitome of agape
[31:20] love they hated him
[31:21] right he was the epitome he wasn't just
[31:24] part of agape love he was all of agape
[31:27] love everything he did even when he
[31:28] planted the room drove the people out
[31:30] hello somebody and drove the people out
[31:33] of the temple that was agape love
[31:36] because agape love has judgment
[31:37] connected to it right
[31:40] agape love has something attached to it
[31:44] that when you have filial love and don't
[31:46] get me wrong
[31:48] sister Junior I've been married 45 44
[31:51] years 45 years coming up
[31:54] wow we still have issues
[31:58] well okay then pray for us we're the
[32:01] only ones
[32:03] [Music]
[32:04] and we'll never come to that Perfection
[32:06] like we'll come with the Lord
[32:09] because we're on this side of humanity
[32:12] all right
[32:13] but we're preaching warning every man
[32:16] teaching every man in all wisdom so
[32:18] we're being taught when we do come to
[32:19] church and we do come to be better
[32:22] husband and wife but better wife to God
[32:26] than anything else I want to be a better
[32:28] wife to God I want I like what somebody
[32:31] said the other day I was watching
[32:33] somebody online and it was it was
[32:36] beautiful because you got all this
[32:38] gender stuff we were talking about not
[32:40] too long ago you know they're this and
[32:42] this you're gonna be a man or a female
[32:44] or whatever you want to be a dog an
[32:45] animal a pig whatever you want to be
[32:47] that's what you can be
[32:49] but God didn't set it up that way
[32:51] and when it fell from that that's when
[32:54] it all fell apart so listen if that made
[32:56] it fall apart we got to get it all put
[32:59] back together
[33:01] but if a woman will look at a man and
[33:03] say hey
[33:04] I'm gonna trust you
[33:08] to be the head
[33:10] I'm gonna trust you to be the headship
[33:13] I'm going to trust you to do your job
[33:17] I'm not going to tell you how to do your
[33:19] job
[33:28] you know sometimes you hold stuff up see
[33:30] if anybody shoot at you
[33:36] how to do your job
[33:39] you say the same thing I appreciate you
[33:42] if you stay in your position in your
[33:45] Godly position everything will be fine
[33:49] if you'll start that way
[33:51] you won't have a lot of problems
[33:54] instead of saying well now you've got to
[33:56] be my head no that's the headship
[34:00] what am I saying we don't have to remind
[34:02] Christ that he's the head
[34:05] we got to believe that he's the head
[34:08] not tell him what to do but do what he
[34:11] said
[34:12] amen do what he said trust him I trust
[34:16] God enough that whatever he tells me
[34:18] that's exactly what I need to do
[34:20] yeah right hello yeah I mean instead of
[34:23] instead of no well I don't know if I
[34:25] want to do that I don't believe I that
[34:27] cutting hair business or that going to
[34:29] church business ah you know that really
[34:30] ain't for me well see you've come out
[34:32] from under headshot
[34:34] anytime you come out from under the word
[34:36] of God you brought you but you're naked
[34:38] yeah
[34:39] what happened to Eve when she stepped
[34:42] out from under head ship
[34:43] she should have said hang on a minute
[34:45] we're getting too deep here let me go
[34:48] get my husband
[34:50] because he's my head and whatever he
[34:53] says that's what I'll do even though
[34:55] they were co-equal in the uh in the
[34:58] creation there where brother Brown talks
[35:00] about
[35:01] still he was her head because he was the
[35:04] husband
[35:05] all right because that whole
[35:07] establishment has to be that we look at
[35:09] Christ and say God whatever you say
[35:12] that's what I'll do because you're the
[35:13] head you're the husband you're the man
[35:16] you're the man
[35:17] right
[35:18] you the man I want you to stay the man I
[35:21] know you're the man
[35:23] need that
[35:24] I want to say where I'm at
[35:27] all right everybody with me
[35:30] so that's what preaching does preaching
[35:32] brings headship
[35:34] preaching tells us what we're required
[35:38] to do by our head because our head is
[35:40] who Christ
[35:41] our head is the Bible because the Bible
[35:43] is Christ amen the message of the hour
[35:46] it's an enhancement of what we already
[35:48] got in this right here
[35:51] remember it gives us a love letter if we
[35:53] have a question there's an answer to
[35:55] that and if there's not a direct cut
[35:57] answer
[35:59] then God sent us a prophet
[36:02] to give us
[36:04] what do you say the correct
[36:06] interpretation
[36:07] by divine inspiration
[36:10] he sent us
[36:12] somebody that we can depend on I can
[36:14] depend on this message
[36:15] [Music]
[36:16] to be correct
[36:19] so let my put my then I put my all my
[36:21] worth in that
[36:23] what happens there's a lot of people
[36:24] that want especially like ones that are
[36:26] leaving the message what they've done is
[36:28] they've never had true heads yet
[36:30] they've always thought they had a little
[36:32] something extra that brother Brown
[36:33] didn't bring or something less uh you
[36:36] know a quote their own self or something
[36:39] like that you know where brother around
[36:40] really didn't mean that
[36:42] no
[36:43] be submissive
[36:46] get out of the selfishness that we're in
[36:49] right that's gonna that's gonna stop us
[36:53] from being
[36:55] now that's not gonna stop us from being
[36:57] Christians
[36:58] if you're already up to to brotherly
[37:01] kindness you're getting pretty good
[37:05] but you're not an adoption yet
[37:08] you're heading toward adoption you have
[37:11] the spirit of adoption but you're not
[37:13] have come to adoption to where he puts
[37:16] that stamp or gives you that ring and
[37:18] says I can trust you with what I've
[37:21] already said
[37:22] I can trust you with this message of the
[37:25] hour
[37:27] and there are certain people that that
[37:30] um
[37:32] that have come to that place
[37:36] amen that have come there has to be
[37:39] there has to be somebody that comes to
[37:41] that position to be able to teach us
[37:43] what brother I'm saying the statue of
[37:45] perfect man he said Lord
[37:52] amen
[37:53] and we've been around uh brother Dale
[37:55] different ones I I believe he's come
[37:57] where God can speak to the man and and
[37:59] come to adoption
[38:01] okay I'm just going to say that I
[38:03] believe that
[38:05] and we're happy
[38:07] and we're heading in that direction
[38:08] because you got to have somebody that
[38:09] knows what they're doing
[38:11] to get you there
[38:13] how are you going to get a first grader
[38:15] to tell you what's going to happen in
[38:16] college
[38:17] no you need somebody in college to tell
[38:20] you what college is going to be like
[38:21] amen all right same way with the the
[38:24] word of God because remember if you'll
[38:27] remember many many times in your
[38:30] Christian experience
[38:32] things were strange
[38:36] okay some of your nodding some of your
[38:39] sleep
[38:40] but it's strange because it's contrary
[38:43] to what you were raised in it was
[38:45] contrary to your nature
[38:50] all that cussing
[38:52] good party in nature
[38:54] but then when that got pulled out of me
[38:56] and I can replace him with words of
[38:58] wisdom and maybe with words that are not
[39:00] that that cut like that
[39:04] strange
[39:06] that's strange for us and it's hard I
[39:08] know it's hard it's hard to do a lot of
[39:10] things but God give us a uh he gave us a
[39:14] way to do it
[39:17] and he gave us a position to come to
[39:20] right and this age requires adoption
[39:23] which requires we come to that statue of
[39:26] a perfect man
[39:27] up to where it says holy spirit we must
[39:30] come to that to where
[39:32] the disciples were to where Peter and
[39:35] John could say Silver and Gold Have I
[39:36] None but such as I have what they had
[39:39] that
[39:40] they had it to right here
[39:42] because remember the headstone had left
[39:46] so the seals are not open
[39:48] they knew they had to go on Paul knew
[39:51] that he was going to pass he didn't he
[39:52] did he was trying to remember brother
[39:54] Ryan said he was trying to tell people
[39:55] that the Rapture wasn't going to take
[39:56] place during his time now what about a
[39:58] Ministry whether where he was revealed
[40:00] to him that hey there's a lot of work
[40:02] I'm just the bottom of this thing I'm
[40:05] just a foundation
[40:07] right right but remember he called
[40:10] himself a master builder
[40:13] he was a master builder because he was
[40:15] the first one to get that Foundation
[40:16] right
[40:17] and then now me and you have come to a
[40:19] place to where we can live Godly
[40:22] all who live Godly in Christ shall what
[40:24] suffer persecution
[40:26] all right
[40:28] that we may present every man perfect in
[40:31] Christ Jesus now look it didn't say
[40:33] perfect in yourself
[40:35] it said perfect in Christ Jesus
[40:38] we have to look at Christ because he was
[40:40] our example
[40:42] all right so that's where godliness and
[40:44] brother Brown says yes you can I like
[40:46] that you want to put that on your
[40:47] refrigerator oh yes you can
[40:51] thus said the Lord you can do it
[40:53] and listen the reason he could say that
[40:56] is because by the spiritual eye of a
[40:58] prophet he could see somebody come to
[41:00] that
[41:01] I believe he could see that his message
[41:04] would bring somebody to that that the
[41:07] message he was bringing was not for that
[41:09] group around him
[41:11] it was for a group coming it was for a
[41:14] group that was going to put those 1100
[41:15] sermons because you can ask I mean like
[41:17] sister cleator in different ones you
[41:19] know brother random would make the
[41:20] circle like go to Macon and it would be
[41:22] like three years later before he'd go
[41:24] back get to back to making again look at
[41:26] your look at your dates
[41:28] so he wouldn't it's not like he's going
[41:30] to sit here and they were at the
[41:31] Tabernacle every Sunday no he would you
[41:34] know preach at different places and come
[41:35] back around and that's all they had
[41:38] they'd have 1100 sermons they didn't
[41:40] have 1100 sermons on their watch
[41:43] to where if somebody says something they
[41:44] pull up a quote
[41:47] we do
[41:50] we do we have it instantly available
[41:53] right here in front of me I can throw
[41:54] any quotes you need up here within about
[41:57] a minute all right does that make us
[41:59] puffed up and heady and high-minded no
[42:01] it does not it makes us to where we can
[42:03] get available information
[42:06] through the preaching of the Gospel
[42:10] the only way the word is going to be
[42:11] made flesh is true
[42:13] Doctrine
[42:16] to the doctrine which is according to
[42:19] Godliness so there's a Doctrine
[42:22] according to Godliness and they're
[42:24] together
[42:25] they're matched so somewhere there's a
[42:27] Doctrine that's going to take us
[42:30] or a set of ideas or beliefs that are
[42:32] taller believed to be true and but it's
[42:34] going to take us somewhere
[42:36] listen the doctrine of the Baptist is
[42:38] going to take them somewhere
[42:40] it's gonna take them sorry to the
[42:43] tribulation period
[42:45] the Methodist Doctrine is going to take
[42:49] them to the tribulation period right
[42:54] is our Doctrine going to do that too
[42:59] think about it
[43:01] it will not if you'll stay in that
[43:04] Doctrine
[43:05] as Paul said continue in my Doctrine
[43:09] continue in this
[43:11] Romans 1 verse 16 says for I am not
[43:13] ashamed of the what I'm not ashamed of
[43:15] this message I'm not ashamed of this
[43:16] gospel
[43:17] I'm not ashamed of it because it's the
[43:19] power
[43:21] because there's power with characters we
[43:23] were talking about this morning pie with
[43:25] character it's fit to rule power with
[43:27] character you better know one thing for
[43:29] sure the first thing you got to get
[43:31] ruled over is this guy
[43:34] all right that's the first thing you
[43:36] need to get rulership over is this guy
[43:39] and not me you take your finger and
[43:41] point to yourself this guy right
[43:44] for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[43:46] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[43:48] salvation to everyone that what
[43:50] believeth
[43:54] so now remember we were talking about
[43:55] having a holy ghost Veil
[43:57] I believe that when we come to this
[44:00] right here now don't get me wrong when
[44:02] we come to this we're going to talk
[44:04] about it maybe next time
[44:06] brother Brown said it was just like
[44:07] waves it's something that covers over us
[44:09] it's kind of like as brother Ram was
[44:11] talking about the honey
[44:13] man if you can get honey in something or
[44:16] or uh
[44:18] it's real sticky
[44:21] and it will go into all the cracks and
[44:23] crevices and just for a little while
[44:24] it'll stop everything up so that's what
[44:26] the Holy Ghost is doing now I believe
[44:29] the holy ghost is now falling on us
[44:33] to fill in the cracks
[44:36] sure it's still saving sure it's still
[44:38] doing things but it's coming to a time
[44:41] to where we got to come to a place to
[44:42] where we got to have all the cracks
[44:43] filled
[44:45] every crack has got to be filled because
[44:48] you know who's going to step in that
[44:49] crack
[44:50] Satan is going to wait till that crack
[44:52] opens and he's going to step in it
[44:55] so we've got to have it where we're
[44:57] right up here where we know we have the
[45:00] virtue of God we know we have the
[45:02] knowledge of God the tempers of God the
[45:04] patience of God and that we are Godly
[45:07] right
[45:08] amen and that we have brotherly kindness
[45:11] that we're fixing to talk about here in
[45:12] just a minute
[45:15] we talked about this this morning
[45:17] let us make man in our own image
[45:20] you know we preached
[45:22] I was thinking about yesterday we
[45:24] brother Dale preached on this
[45:27] probably in early 2000s
[45:30] 2000s
[45:32] about this Genesis 1 26 man
[45:35] and it's never been exhausted since then
[45:37] for 20-something years we just keep
[45:39] adding and keep preaching and keep
[45:40] preaching on this Genesis one and seeing
[45:42] more and more of what this Genesis 1 26
[45:45] man was it was every believer that gets
[45:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:51] and there is no way that it was ever
[45:53] created as we see created is there was
[45:56] not then it is because if we had a
[45:59] beginning if this had a beginning this
[46:02] has got to have an end
[46:04] the new birth did not have a beginning
[46:06] it did in you but it didn't in God
[46:10] all right we'll read it in just a minute
[46:11] because remember love every love is
[46:15] temporary except agape love every love
[46:19] every love is gonna go away when we get
[46:21] on the other side
[46:23] what is on the other side brother random
[46:25] perfect love
[46:27] perfect love is agape love you cannot
[46:30] have perfect love and have feel your
[46:31] love
[46:33] Peter love has conditions it has cracks
[46:35] it has holes it has lups it has downs
[46:39] am I preaching to the right congregation
[46:40] today
[46:45] to me
[46:48] Agape Love Takes to human emotion
[46:52] out of it
[46:53] think about that
[46:57] because Jesus Christ said I wish that
[46:59] all would be saved now he wished that
[47:02] but he knew they wouldn't
[47:06] so his Zeal was okay I want everybody to
[47:08] be saved but I know
[47:10] that they're not all gonna be saved
[47:13] so therefore I'm not going to force it
[47:15] on anybody
[47:17] I'm going to put it out there and then
[47:18] I'll see I've already seen who's going
[47:20] to accept me and who's not going to
[47:21] accept me but I got to put it out there
[47:23] anyway
[47:24] so then in the Old Testament he starts
[47:26] with Moses David Sampson we were talking
[47:28] about it this morning
[47:31] they had power but they didn't have
[47:33] character to go with it and they were
[47:35] somewhat messed up in different
[47:36] different times of their life but you
[47:39] and I are not that anymore we have the
[47:41] blood of Jesus Christ to take care of
[47:43] all sin
[47:45] listen it's still a sin killing gospel
[47:48] folks I'm telling you
[47:50] but let's talk about brotherly kindness
[47:52] let's get into this let's skip some of
[47:54] this
[47:54] remember it means it's Philadelphia or
[47:57] brotherly love it's the love of brothers
[47:58] or sisters and brotherly love
[48:01] we're going to let the Bible explain to
[48:04] us what Brotherly Love is if that's all
[48:06] right and it's the love of Christians
[48:10] that they cherish each other as Brethren
[48:13] and God is love but love typically
[48:15] produces obedience
[48:17] that's what we were talking about if I
[48:20] if I have the correct husband or the
[48:21] correct wife and I love them even with
[48:24] filial love
[48:25] but that's what brother Brandon remember
[48:27] what he said he said pick a husband and
[48:29] wife he said don't pick them by outside
[48:33] appearances
[48:35] because I feel your love that's even
[48:37] lust
[48:39] right right he said look at their what
[48:42] character
[48:45] how many times have you heard us tell
[48:46] you kids
[48:48] get born again
[48:50] marry somebody that's born again
[48:53] because at least you have agape love in
[48:57] your soul and somewhere you can get in
[49:00] there with video Love
[49:02] all right it ain't gonna be a a cure-all
[49:06] because you have filial love because
[49:08] you're a human
[49:10] but that agape love in your soul is what
[49:12] you need to let take over
[49:17] and lit that will produce obedience
[49:20] being disobedient is what gets us all in
[49:22] trouble
[49:23] husbands wives sisters brothers being
[49:27] disobedient is what gets us in trouble
[49:29] and usually it's not just one person it
[49:32] affects a lot of people right
[49:34] um
[49:35] for those who do trust in Christ in
[49:38] other words make them your head and just
[49:40] trust in what he said they receive what
[49:42] they don't deserve which is Grace and
[49:44] withheld what they really deserve which
[49:47] was Mercy which side are you on do you
[49:50] have eternal life
[49:52] or you still have the wrath of God
[49:54] abiding on you and I said in you because
[49:57] that's where it is so this is where
[49:58] we're at this morning let's start right
[50:00] here just for a little bit
[50:02] um
[50:03] Matthew 24 verse 12 says because
[50:05] iniquity shall abound now what is
[50:08] Iniquity iniquity is knowing to do
[50:10] better
[50:11] and you don't do it or you know to do it
[50:15] and you don't
[50:17] works both ways all right and because
[50:19] iniquity shall want abound in other
[50:21] words he pop it's not going to be just a
[50:23] little bit the love of many so what eats
[50:26] the love of God iniquity
[50:28] the love of God shall wax cold brother
[50:30] Brandon you must be born again he talks
[50:33] about the rainbow
[50:35] after that comes from agape love to fill
[50:37] your love that's the love that you have
[50:39] for your wife if some man would insult
[50:41] her you'd shoot his brains out see
[50:43] because it creates a jealousy now look
[50:47] it creates a jealousy
[50:52] okay formulates creates a jealousy
[50:57] it creates all these things that you
[50:58] really don't need but watch
[51:02] because it creates a jealousy but that's
[51:04] filial love or secondary love
[51:07] then comes lust for another man's wife
[51:09] then comes filth see it just becomes
[51:12] perverted but all of this kind of love
[51:15] had a beginning so all love had a
[51:17] beginning is epigapee love Agape left
[51:19] can't be Eternal and have a beginning
[51:22] it's like I said before if God ever
[51:24] loved you he can never unlove you
[51:26] if he saw that you loved him
[51:29] he can't unlove you by the things that
[51:32] we do and that we we we like
[51:34] um I said many times before we spent a
[51:37] lot of time getting water baptized we
[51:39] spend a lot of time you know getting
[51:42] redone
[51:43] there's somewhere you're gonna have to
[51:44] put State down and say look I've had
[51:46] enough of that
[51:49] this is human error and mistakes it's
[51:52] going to happen I don't need to be
[51:54] baptized if I lose my temper if it did
[51:58] every one of you we'd have to baptize
[51:59] you every day I just have to stay up
[52:02] here and we'd be wrinkled by the time we
[52:03] got done
[52:05] sister Rebecca's laughing praise the
[52:07] Lord
[52:07] we won
[52:11] can we keep it separate
[52:14] there is a time when you better realize
[52:16] you need water baptism you better know
[52:18] that you need this Genesis 1 26 man but
[52:21] once you do there's a Humanity part that
[52:24] we live and this Humanity part that we
[52:27] live is human
[52:29] all right let's learn to keep it
[52:32] separate now watch this
[52:33] but then a real genuine love of God
[52:37] that I've been talking about come to the
[52:39] human being by the new birth now look
[52:41] it's not in there
[52:43] it comes in
[52:45] by the new birth being born again it it
[52:49] had no beginning
[52:52] and it'll never have an end
[52:54] you are then a Son of God and a daughter
[52:57] of God and your affections are on things
[53:00] above you stop that cussing
[53:03] stop it you stop all that other stuff
[53:07] feel your love would make you shoot a
[53:09] man for insulting your wife agape love
[53:12] would make you pray for his lost soul
[53:13] that's the difference
[53:15] the baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958 they
[53:18] come all the way down from Philly Love
[53:20] or agape love to feel your love and on
[53:22] down to lust and to the lowest
[53:24] and as we were talking this morning
[53:25] listen God can condescend and come and
[53:28] get you
[53:29] Satan's not going to that God himself
[53:31] became a man Jesus came down that same
[53:35] way to the lowest pits of hell
[53:38] picked out those who knew before the
[53:40] foundation of the world whose name was
[53:41] written on the book and redeemed them
[53:43] back to itself
[53:45] there you are the story of redemption
[53:48] cannot be fully known until we see him
[53:51] and we stand in his likeness it's really
[53:55] nice to know that Jesus was God
[54:01] but how much more nice is it to realize
[54:03] your God
[54:06] it's wonderful the world knows
[54:09] another maybe the second or third person
[54:11] or something that Jesus was God
[54:15] they don't know how to put it in there
[54:16] though but you and I know where to fit
[54:18] it out but we need to fit ourself in
[54:20] that too
[54:22] there you are the story of redemption
[54:24] cannot be fully known until we see him
[54:26] and we stand what in his Genesis 1 26. I
[54:32] hope some of y'all are praying
[54:35] well you got your eyes closed
[54:38] then sexually let's add Brotherly Love
[54:40] brotherly kindness now that's a good one
[54:42] right here six seven all right adding
[54:45] brotherly kindness when we get to
[54:47] brotherly kindness put yourself in his
[54:49] place on the matter that's a hard thing
[54:50] for us to do
[54:52] it's really hard for us to put ourselves
[54:54] in someone else's situation
[54:57] right right
[55:00] my brother sinned against me shall I
[55:03] forgive him talking to Jesus seven times
[55:05] oh Peter thought man I'm doing a good
[55:07] job
[55:08] uh Jesus said no 70 times that
[55:11] brotherly kindness now you see it for
[55:13] brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[55:15] impatient with him see no see be kind to
[55:18] him go anyway somebody said not long ago
[55:20] how can you believe these things the way
[55:22] you do and still go to the Assembly of
[55:24] God the Oneness and all the rest then
[55:26] put see brotherly kindness hoping
[55:28] someday see patient with him so you got
[55:31] to use all these verbs you're patient
[55:32] with him temperate with him enduring
[55:34] with him having knowledge to understand
[55:36] what he believes
[55:38] I like to know what people believe
[55:41] I like for them to explain to me if you
[55:44] can't explain to me what you believe you
[55:46] really don't believe it
[55:49] remember because remember the quote
[55:51] where uh someone said you only really
[55:53] believe what you obey you only go obey
[55:56] what you believe in if you don't believe
[55:59] should come
[56:03] but that's contrary to the Bible
[56:06] very contrary to the Bible
[56:12] Antichrist
[56:14] well if it's not word what is it it's
[56:17] anti-word to you
[56:20] but let it go out with kindness meekness
[56:24] having faith that someday God will bring
[56:27] him in
[56:29] but I'm going to tell y'all something
[56:30] I'm gonna be a bearer of bad news here
[56:31] just for a second there's one day that
[56:34] God's going to finish that and he's not
[56:35] going to have any Mercy anymore
[56:40] do we not believe that
[56:42] are we just don't believe that we're
[56:44] just going what we're going to do is
[56:45] we're just gonna from the message it
[56:47] doesn't matter if we really get right
[56:49] uh we're just gonna flow right into the
[56:51] ark
[56:53] go right through the door
[56:55] and go right on into safety and
[57:02] I can do that because I've lost some
[57:04] weight
[57:11] [Music]
[57:14] no
[57:16] God said Noah I've had enough get in the
[57:18] ark that's right amen exactly and I'm
[57:21] sure listen Noah being a human he still
[57:23] had some friends out there that he said
[57:25] hey Lord just just give him a little
[57:27] more time
[57:29] gosh I give him 120 years
[57:34] he even give Grace he let it stay open
[57:37] for a few days then he shot it
[57:41] and when he shut it no one could open it
[57:44] so what am I saying well we're in the
[57:47] message so I think we're just going to
[57:49] morph into a change no you ain't gonna
[57:52] morph into a change you're gonna fight
[57:54] for every inch of ground I appreciate
[57:57] people that fight their way to church I
[57:58] can't stand people well here we go
[58:00] nevermind
[58:08] now here we are now in the in the New
[58:10] Testament
[58:11] everybody with me
[58:13] we're now in the New Testament all right
[58:15] the Old Testament you had a commandment
[58:17] right ten of them
[58:19] plus levitical law and all that
[58:22] but I'm gonna read you something in
[58:23] Leviticus in just a few minutes it may
[58:24] just like flip your switch a little bit
[58:27] but here Jesus is standing in John 13
[58:29] 34. now he's the new commandment so he
[58:32] says a new commandment I give unto you
[58:36] he's not erasing that commandment
[58:42] right
[58:43] he's magnifying it
[58:45] and telling you you can live it
[58:48] right because the Pharisees spent all
[58:49] their time saying you can't live it you
[58:51] got to come to us you got to do this you
[58:53] got to do that you got to wash the pot
[58:54] you got to light a candle you got to say
[58:57] you know 10 Hail Marys and all that
[58:58] stuff I'm bringing it up today
[59:01] listen the Catholic Church came from
[59:04] that Pharisee Spirit it was you when
[59:05] Jesus was here
[59:07] if you can't say that you're blind right
[59:09] it's not a different devil it's the same
[59:12] Devil in a religious organization that
[59:14] just brought it up to
[59:16] 80 300 8600 and I see you and just
[59:19] plopped it right down in the Christian
[59:21] church
[59:23] a new commandment I give unto you
[59:26] that you love one another now they were
[59:28] told that in the Old Testament
[59:31] as I have loved you
[59:34] that ye also love one another
[59:38] as I have loved you so the new
[59:40] commandment is it's not just love
[59:41] everybody
[59:43] as I have loved you
[59:46] you gotta love everybody else everybody
[59:48] with me look by this shall all men know
[59:52] that you're my disciples if you have
[59:55] love one to another remember we
[59:58] discussed it this morning disciple means
[1:00:00] discipline
[1:00:02] they were disciplined to what Jesus had
[1:00:04] told them
[1:00:06] Proverbs 25 this is the Old Testament
[1:00:10] if thine enemy be hungry give him bread
[1:00:13] boy that's contrary
[1:00:15] if he be thirsty give him water I'll
[1:00:18] bless God let him starve
[1:00:20] let him drown
[1:00:23] listen he's hitting all of us
[1:00:25] all right
[1:00:27] for Thou shalt Heep coals of Fire
[1:00:30] upon his head
[1:00:32] and the Lord shall reward you
[1:00:40] the best way to make somebody mad at you
[1:00:44] is do good to them
[1:00:46] oh they love road rage and they love for
[1:00:48] you to be in their face and you didn't
[1:00:49] argue or are you already are you because
[1:00:51] you just two Devils arguing with each
[1:00:53] other sorry
[1:00:54] I said two devil
[1:00:56] are you you're arguing back and forth
[1:00:58] right
[1:01:00] but if you say
[1:01:02] where was we at
[1:01:06] and we said if you say God bless you to
[1:01:09] somebody
[1:01:10] or have a blessed day
[1:01:13] some of people it's like you smack them
[1:01:14] in the head
[1:01:16] because they ain't gonna hear that they
[1:01:18] gonna hear all them other cussing
[1:01:22] that's what it's going to do though so
[1:01:24] then what do you do you transfer what
[1:01:26] was going to be on you you transfer it
[1:01:29] to that person your enemy I'm just over
[1:01:32] here I'm left-handed so I'm over here in
[1:01:33] front of you so
[1:01:38] my wife's sitting over there I can't go
[1:01:39] over there
[1:01:41] but what you're doing is you're heaping
[1:01:43] every bit of that that they're trying to
[1:01:44] throw on you if you don't back and forth
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:48] everybody with me can you see that you
[1:01:50] you and you see that when you start an
[1:01:52] argument with somebody just stop stop
[1:01:55] and say God bless you you have a good
[1:01:57] day and then turn around walk off it
[1:01:59] won't
[1:02:03] well it cause a fire on the head it's so
[1:02:05] inside
[1:02:08] if they just said one more thing
[1:02:13] well don't say that one more thing and
[1:02:15] it'll just Heap everything on his head
[1:02:16] and guess what the Lord said he would
[1:02:18] bless you for doing it did we not read
[1:02:20] that and the Lord shall reward thee
[1:02:25] Isaiah 42 verse 21 says the Lord is what
[1:02:27] this is Isaiah the Lord is well pleased
[1:02:30] for his righteous and his sake
[1:02:33] now remember
[1:02:35] in Isaiah 42 that would be in the Old
[1:02:38] Testament but it is speaking of and
[1:02:41] Jesus Through the different prophets in
[1:02:44] the New Testament he's going to say the
[1:02:46] exact same thing because he didn't do
[1:02:48] away he can't do away with the law
[1:02:51] he magnified the law a new commandment I
[1:02:56] give to you
[1:02:58] watch this right here
[1:03:00] and make it honorable
[1:03:03] Matthew 5 37. but let your communication
[1:03:07] for whatsoever is more than this cometh
[1:03:11] of evil you have heard that it's been
[1:03:13] said now wait a minute where'd they hear
[1:03:15] that
[1:03:16] where'd they hear that the hearing the
[1:03:18] synagogue they heard a preacher
[1:03:23] somebody
[1:03:25] poke you an eye
[1:03:27] poke him back
[1:03:29] because that's what the Old Testament
[1:03:31] says
[1:03:33] they knock your tooth out Knock theirs
[1:03:36] out
[1:03:37] and thank you your brother go kill him
[1:03:40] that was your old testament that was a
[1:03:42] levitical law right
[1:03:45] but what did Jesus come to do not to
[1:03:47] take it away
[1:03:49] but to make it little
[1:03:52] you have heard that it has been said an
[1:03:53] eye for a nine a tooth for a tooth but I
[1:03:56] say unto you this is the word this is at
[1:03:59] John 1 1 this is the word that has
[1:04:01] become flesh that's now talking to me
[1:04:03] and you
[1:04:05] but I say unto you that you resist not
[1:04:07] evil but what so whosoever shall smite
[1:04:11] thee on thy right cheek give them the
[1:04:13] other one
[1:04:16] if a man will sue you into law and take
[1:04:20] away your coat give him a cloak how many
[1:04:22] of y'all would do that
[1:04:24] didn't think so and whosoever shall
[1:04:27] compel thee to go a mile
[1:04:30] well I'm tired
[1:04:32] I'm tired
[1:04:34] Jesus said go two miles
[1:04:38] this will if this will take care of the
[1:04:40] situation
[1:04:42] all right
[1:04:43] then we're good praise the Lord we're
[1:04:46] good no Jesus said just go another their
[1:04:49] mouth and make it more better
[1:04:52] made it where it hits the cold on top of
[1:04:55] their head
[1:04:57] give to them that asketh thee
[1:05:00] and from him that would borrow thee turn
[1:05:03] that thou away
[1:05:06] you know you're not supposed to
[1:05:07] according to the Bible you're not
[1:05:09] supposed to lend brother a brother money
[1:05:10] in that and get interest off of it you
[1:05:12] know you're not supposed to do that
[1:05:13] right that's not life lesson that's the
[1:05:15] Bible
[1:05:16] so you should never charge your neighbor
[1:05:18] if I'm or your brother if you let him if
[1:05:20] you loan somebody money
[1:05:22] don't charge them interest because the
[1:05:23] Bible tells you not to
[1:05:25] you've heard that it been said Thou
[1:05:27] shalt Love Thy Neighbor hold on man sue
[1:05:29] listen this
[1:05:34] I know
[1:05:36] we're gonna have a repentance party here
[1:05:38] in just a few minutes
[1:05:40] but
[1:05:44] all right the Bible says love your
[1:05:47] neighbor and hate your enemy
[1:05:49] and then what the Bible says the Old
[1:05:51] Testament says love your neighbor
[1:05:54] but hate your enemy
[1:05:59] but I say unto you now listen the person
[1:06:02] that's saying but I say unto you is this
[1:06:04] person right here
[1:06:07] remember this is still the New Birth the
[1:06:09] Genesis one man the the one that was not
[1:06:12] created that's Eternal that's that's
[1:06:14] that's not an offshoot of God it is God
[1:06:17] in another form called a bottle of water
[1:06:20] all right I heard the Genesis 1 26 this
[1:06:22] is the one that's talking
[1:06:24] everybody with me this is talk this came
[1:06:27] into human flesh 2000 years ago as a
[1:06:30] baby
[1:06:33] this was inside of that man right right
[1:06:35] what another person what now uh uh well
[1:06:39] Jesus wasn't God he was another person
[1:06:41] and he became god well I need to know
[1:06:43] where that other person's at then we got
[1:06:45] two or three persons we got a
[1:06:46] schizophrenic God and we don't need to
[1:06:47] serve him all right them
[1:06:50] we have one God
[1:06:53] he was born a baby
[1:06:55] he could do that
[1:06:57] but this was speaking because this when
[1:07:00] it comes into you has got to speak the
[1:07:02] same thing right that's why we've messed
[1:07:06] up
[1:07:06] down Through the Ages we've not listened
[1:07:08] to this we've listened to that Spirit
[1:07:10] realm that's wrapped all the way around
[1:07:12] this real tight
[1:07:14] because remember God can't tell you a
[1:07:17] lie God can't tell you an untruth God
[1:07:20] can't lead you into error
[1:07:24] so it's either the devil or him one of
[1:07:26] the two right all right Thou shalt Love
[1:07:29] Thy Neighbor y'all ready and hate that
[1:07:31] enemy
[1:07:32] but I say unto you
[1:07:35] love your enemies
[1:07:39] bless them that cuss you
[1:07:43] in southern language
[1:07:45] do good
[1:07:47] to them
[1:07:49] that hey you know bless God I'll get
[1:07:51] them back by the end of the day you just
[1:07:53] wait and see if I don't
[1:07:55] um
[1:07:56] you're not at brotherly kindness yet
[1:08:01] you're not
[1:08:02] he said well if they were this this is a
[1:08:04] lot of y'all
[1:08:06] wait a minute y'all
[1:08:09] now if it's a Believer I forgive him
[1:08:12] yeah
[1:08:14] they go to little church I forgive them
[1:08:16] that's easy
[1:08:23] your neighbor don't go to this church
[1:08:27] now now wait a minute The Dales do but
[1:08:30] sorry so we're exam but most of your
[1:08:33] neighbors don't go to this church my
[1:08:36] neighbors are gay
[1:08:38] full blown for years 30 years they've
[1:08:40] been living together okay
[1:08:43] now
[1:08:44] I gotta look at them
[1:08:47] with the Same Love
[1:08:49] that God looks at me
[1:08:52] if not
[1:08:53] he can't look at me
[1:08:57] like you should be looking at me I told
[1:08:59] your brother all these others
[1:09:01] everybody's like oh praise God godliness
[1:09:02] that's good yeah we got some virtue we
[1:09:04] got some not oh man I'll get rid of that
[1:09:06] temper we're gonna have some well some
[1:09:08] we'll get rid of that
[1:09:10] I got patience now I got the patience of
[1:09:13] Job
[1:09:19] but like I love my neighbor
[1:09:22] as I do myself
[1:09:26] until for those of you that live way out
[1:09:28] in the country and don't have neighbors
[1:09:29] just consider it go put your paths a
[1:09:31] little bit wider somebody everybody's
[1:09:33] got a neighbor somewhere
[1:09:36] but I'm saying do you love your enemies
[1:09:39] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:09:42] them that hate you
[1:09:44] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:09:46] you that's a hard one
[1:09:49] okay pray for me it's hard for me nobody
[1:09:51] said amen so pray for me
[1:09:54] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:09:57] you listen this is somebody that's gonna
[1:09:59] use you
[1:10:01] in a spiteful way
[1:10:05] and persecute you look that you may be
[1:10:09] the children
[1:10:11] of your father
[1:10:14] your father produced this right here
[1:10:19] that you can be the children of your
[1:10:21] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:10:24] his son to rise on the evil
[1:10:26] and on the good
[1:10:28] and sendeth Reign on the just
[1:10:31] and the unjust
[1:10:33] for if you love them which love you
[1:10:37] what reward is that
[1:10:42] do not even the publicans do the same
[1:10:45] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:10:50] what are you more than others
[1:10:53] do not even Republicans do that also in
[1:10:55] other words Jesus is saying the normal
[1:10:58] this is the norm right here
[1:11:01] he don't want you to be the norm
[1:11:03] we got to rise above that
[1:11:08] oh then verse 48
[1:11:10] after all this
[1:11:12] is be therefore perfect even as your
[1:11:14] father in Heaven
[1:11:16] is perfect John 15 9 says as a father
[1:11:19] have to love me so have I loved you and
[1:11:21] continue ye in my love my agape
[1:11:28] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[1:11:31] abide in my love now we're fixing to
[1:11:34] give you the two best Commandments of of
[1:11:36] all the ten even as I have kept my
[1:11:39] father's Commandments and abide in his
[1:11:40] love these things have I spoken unto you
[1:11:43] that my joy might remain in you and that
[1:11:46] your joy might be full listen
[1:11:48] every time
[1:11:50] we come to a revelation
[1:11:53] you you all of us every time we come to
[1:11:56] Revelation you know what
[1:11:58] God's happy
[1:12:02] because something has bound you and he
[1:12:04] can't get to you
[1:12:07] but if it's revealed to you and you come
[1:12:09] out from that God can reveal more
[1:12:12] and then you're moving further and then
[1:12:16] because without Revelation we're nothing
[1:12:19] brother Brown said we thrive on
[1:12:21] Revelation
[1:12:23] because if you're if you're a backslid
[1:12:26] that means you ain't got anything
[1:12:27] revealed to you
[1:12:29] Revelation is continuing
[1:12:36] these things have I spoken unto you that
[1:12:38] my joy might remain in you
[1:12:42] and that your joy
[1:12:44] might be full
[1:12:46] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:12:49] another as I have loved you
[1:12:53] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:12:55] a man lay down his life
[1:12:57] for his friends Divine love 1956 brother
[1:13:01] Ryan said now we are faced in a day it's
[1:13:04] prophesied that Brotherly Love would
[1:13:05] become a strange thing among the people
[1:13:08] and it's to my humble belief that that
[1:13:11] is the greatest of all gifts that there
[1:13:13] is in God's Bible now this is
[1:13:16] 1956. he hasn't really got he's still in
[1:13:19] the healing campaign he's still
[1:13:21] preaching to Badness and Methodist and
[1:13:23] Pentecostals he hadn't really got to his
[1:13:25] message yet does everybody understand
[1:13:26] what I'm talking about
[1:13:28] all right he's getting us back to the
[1:13:31] day of Pentecost
[1:13:34] he's getting us back to what they
[1:13:36] already believed in the first church age
[1:13:39] but remember we left our first love
[1:13:44] in the first church age
[1:13:47] and the Lord Jesus would stand and
[1:13:49] platform tonight look me in the face and
[1:13:50] say I'm going to give you your choice in
[1:13:52] other words let's let's paraphrase this
[1:13:53] you can be a great person a great
[1:13:55] Minister I'll give you a gift gift to
[1:13:57] preaching he did all that I'll give you
[1:13:59] the gift of teaching I'll give you the
[1:14:01] gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the
[1:14:02] gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a
[1:14:05] prophet or any fine gift of faith any of
[1:14:07] the gift that's in the Bible now look
[1:14:09] how important he's fixing to put on this
[1:14:11] other thing
[1:14:12] any of the gifts that's in the Bible
[1:14:14] I'll give them ever one to you but then
[1:14:16] I will withhold love
[1:14:18] from you or either I'll give you love
[1:14:21] and withhold the gift
[1:14:23] I'd say Lord
[1:14:25] take all the gifts
[1:14:27] and let me have the love
[1:14:30] for no matter how many gifts we got
[1:14:33] they will never do us any good except
[1:14:36] the love of God is the motive behind the
[1:14:40] gift
[1:14:41] we must have agape
[1:14:46] 1957 I will restore
[1:14:48] Jesus spoke Paul did rather said let
[1:14:50] Brotherly Love continue that was in the
[1:14:53] first church but something taking place
[1:14:55] and there was a fellow came in by the
[1:14:57] name of Obama worm and when he began to
[1:15:00] eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he
[1:15:02] cut the very sight line of it because it
[1:15:05] don't make any difference how smart you
[1:15:07] are how much we think we know or how
[1:15:09] much we want to be different from
[1:15:10] somebody else as long as that brotherly
[1:15:13] feeling isn't among us we are fighting a
[1:15:16] losing battle
[1:15:18] that's right we can't win there's no way
[1:15:23] for us to win
[1:15:25] we all believe brother Brown was a
[1:15:27] prophet right and what he said we need
[1:15:29] to believe okay all right so let's
[1:15:31] continue on now let's talk about selfish
[1:15:34] to be selfish is to be what concerned
[1:15:36] excessively
[1:15:38] that's okay to take care of yourself
[1:15:40] take care of your house first
[1:15:42] but excessively or exclusively with
[1:15:45] oneself
[1:15:47] you're nothing but a selfie stick
[1:15:49] selfishness is one of the biggest
[1:15:52] obstacles to having the kind of close
[1:15:55] relationship with God and in an
[1:15:57] inspiring relationship with other people
[1:16:01] that many of us desire
[1:16:03] selfishness Cuts us off Galatians 2
[1:16:06] verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ
[1:16:08] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:16:11] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:16:13] live remember I preached several sermons
[1:16:15] on
[1:16:16] uh two lives because he said the life I
[1:16:18] now live which meant he was living a
[1:16:20] life before that but the life I now live
[1:16:23] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:16:24] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:16:27] for me Galatians 2 20. it teaches us
[1:16:30] that living by faith in the Son of God
[1:16:32] means you no longer live but Jesus lives
[1:16:35] in you this right here
[1:16:37] all right
[1:16:39] right so if we want to have a close
[1:16:41] relationship with God and other people
[1:16:43] you need to learn to leave yourself
[1:16:49] second Timothy 3 verse 2 it says for men
[1:16:51] shall be lovers of their own selves boy
[1:16:53] think about that Covetous boasters proud
[1:16:56] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:16:58] unthateful Unholy
[1:17:03] you know man's come to a place to where
[1:17:07] you know we used to make an honest
[1:17:08] living you go to work
[1:17:10] you'd work your hours you would produce
[1:17:12] something right you'd go to a building
[1:17:15] let's say we go to General Motors some
[1:17:16] of you work at the gym you go to gym you
[1:17:18] had all your parts there you you trusted
[1:17:20] that the this company would give you all
[1:17:22] the tools that you needed you would at
[1:17:24] the end of the day I think General
[1:17:26] Motors at one time was running
[1:17:28] um a car every minute so you were there
[1:17:31] was a car a minute going out
[1:17:33] big building
[1:17:35] 1200 people working you got all this
[1:17:37] equipment
[1:17:38] and they made money from that because
[1:17:40] they would take the like bro Danny would
[1:17:43] take the product put it together
[1:17:46] tangible
[1:17:48] ship it pack it ship it and go over here
[1:17:52] and somebody buys that right
[1:17:56] folks let me let you in a little secret
[1:18:00] when Facebook went public
[1:18:05] it was just an idea
[1:18:07] and a Man became a billionaire
[1:18:10] over just an idea
[1:18:12] these YouTube influencers that make
[1:18:15] hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[1:18:17] that's all they are
[1:18:18] they talk online there is nothing they
[1:18:21] produce oh yeah up here but there's
[1:18:24] nothing tangible they don't go to work
[1:18:25] to a job they don't put something
[1:18:27] together and then sell it to somebody
[1:18:29] else they talk
[1:18:32] right mainly about their self
[1:18:37] YouTube influencer is that's what it's
[1:18:40] come to what
[1:18:42] what is that it's just the devil a farce
[1:18:45] of the devil he is telling you you can
[1:18:47] produce something and there's nothing
[1:18:48] there
[1:18:52] listen God will give you the parts
[1:18:54] got to give you the place to do it here
[1:18:57] and he'll give you the ability to do it
[1:18:59] but when you put something together what
[1:19:00] do you produce you produce a Christian
[1:19:02] Life
[1:19:03] and you take that product out to the
[1:19:05] world not a YouTube influencer
[1:19:09] the people has got too selfish that's
[1:19:11] what they're doing they're not going to
[1:19:12] work anymore they're going to say to how
[1:19:14] of course covet helped a little bit of
[1:19:15] that
[1:19:16] the people's got ten selfish got this go
[1:19:18] place where they think they live in a
[1:19:20] little world that's where I got the idea
[1:19:22] about the influencers because that's
[1:19:24] what it is it's all YouTube influencer
[1:19:26] does what talks about the world
[1:19:30] blog
[1:19:32] and make millions off of that off of
[1:19:35] talking
[1:19:36] gosh I should be a billionaire
[1:19:40] and people say amen
[1:19:46] people got too selfish they got the
[1:19:48] place where they think they live in a
[1:19:49] little world all by themselves
[1:19:52] you know that's the truth well you know
[1:19:54] it used to be out in the farm when we
[1:19:56] had a neighbor and the neighbor get sick
[1:19:58] we go help them do the work cut wood
[1:20:00] bring it in now you don't even know your
[1:20:02] neighbor's dead unless you read in the
[1:20:03] paper
[1:20:05] that's right selfish
[1:20:07] people pass down the street while we
[1:20:09] grab a hold of one another's hands shake
[1:20:10] their hands say how are you brother and
[1:20:11] today they pass on the street they give
[1:20:13] a little silly grin and that is right
[1:20:15] sister Esther sent me the the quote it
[1:20:18] was media that did that not brother
[1:20:19] Brown
[1:20:21] about four or five times in in the
[1:20:24] message so that's what he's referring to
[1:20:27] he's getting he's dishing his wife a
[1:20:29] little bit right here
[1:20:32] right and today when they pass on the
[1:20:34] street they give a little silly grin
[1:20:35] because that's what she said she said I
[1:20:37] grinned at them
[1:20:41] throw their head up in the air oh my no
[1:20:43] wonder the Love's gone I despise that
[1:20:46] old somebody feels they're bigger than
[1:20:49] somebody else
[1:20:50] after all you're six foot of Earth
[1:20:52] that's all you are that's right
[1:20:53] everybody
[1:20:55] 1954 and I recognized the other day a
[1:20:58] selfish Spirit coming upon me
[1:21:01] it's hard for people to swallow saying
[1:21:03] this man's wrong I ought to tell him
[1:21:05] about it he said that's wrong
[1:21:07] God's the one to tell him about it
[1:21:09] that's not none of my business but my
[1:21:11] business is to preach the gospel and
[1:21:13] love everybody move on love my enemies
[1:21:16] as Jesus loved me when I was his enemy
[1:21:18] do you remember that we were all enemies
[1:21:21] to God okay we're all the enemy of God
[1:21:24] so all in one boat but my business just
[1:21:26] preach the gospel of everybody move on
[1:21:28] love our enemies as Jesus Christ loved
[1:21:31] me when I was his enemy when I was
[1:21:33] unlovely he loved me to his bosom and
[1:21:36] anybody that's unlovely let me love them
[1:21:39] the same let the spirit that was in
[1:21:40] Christ be in US amen let that be our
[1:21:45] plea today is to be
[1:21:47] as loving as Jesus Christ is
[1:21:51] because I mean how many of you
[1:21:54] when you come to the Lord
[1:21:57] was in a real good shape
[1:22:02] think about it
[1:22:04] no use about in your lowest of low you
[1:22:07] had come to the end of your rope tied a
[1:22:09] knot and was hanging on
[1:22:11] or you've done something incredibly
[1:22:14] stupid
[1:22:18] that you couldn't get yourself out of
[1:22:21] that's when the Lord comes
[1:22:23] well guess what tell me that agape love
[1:22:26] is conditional
[1:22:28] is not conditional
[1:22:30] he loved you at the unlovable list
[1:22:33] that's the word part of your life
[1:22:37] and what did that love do he showed that
[1:22:39] love and it drawed you to it
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:44] amen praise God that's the Revelation if
[1:22:45] you'll hang on to that
[1:22:47] look listen now 1954 brother Brown says
[1:22:50] now let us hold fast our profession of
[1:22:52] our faith without waver he's quoting
[1:22:53] scripture he is faithful who hath
[1:22:55] promised and let us consider one another
[1:22:57] to provoke one another unto love and to
[1:23:00] good work now listen a lot of us provoke
[1:23:03] other things
[1:23:04] praise the Lord every one of you
[1:23:08] word provoker but now the Bible tells us
[1:23:11] to promote one another into love and
[1:23:12] good work provoke means to what
[1:23:14] encourage
[1:23:16] we think not but it is encourage one
[1:23:19] another unto love and the good works if
[1:23:21] you see a brother in the church
[1:23:23] now watch there's got something against
[1:23:25] the other brother
[1:23:27] don't say something to stir that thing
[1:23:29] up
[1:23:32] how many secret centers have I hit there
[1:23:35] praise the Lord
[1:23:36] don't say something to stir that thing
[1:23:39] up
[1:23:40] but say something that'll bring them
[1:23:42] together
[1:23:45] provoke one another unto good works and
[1:23:48] to love is what we must do what is it
[1:23:52] that's a man that's born again
[1:23:54] if you my brother tonight don't feel
[1:23:57] that way when you see your brothers
[1:23:59] falling out in short words between one
[1:24:02] another if you don't feel like bringing
[1:24:04] them together it's your time to go to
[1:24:07] the altar
[1:24:09] right that's right there's something
[1:24:10] happened in your life there is something
[1:24:12] you've been deceived in
[1:24:15] you haven't the experience that God
[1:24:18] wants you to have
[1:24:21] for Jesus when he was reviled he reviled
[1:24:24] not again and with spoken evil of he
[1:24:27] spoke not back again and when they done
[1:24:30] evil to him he turned and did good to
[1:24:32] them
[1:24:33] when they persecuted him and nailed him
[1:24:35] to a cross he looked down and said
[1:24:37] father forgive him for they don't know
[1:24:39] what they're doing
[1:24:40] if that kind of spirit's not in you the
[1:24:42] Holy Spirit Holy Ghost has never entered
[1:24:45] you yet
[1:24:47] for that was the same spirit that was on
[1:24:49] Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in
[1:24:51] you Christ is in his church that's a
[1:24:55] pretty powerful statement
[1:24:57] Hebrews 12 verse 14 says follow peace
[1:25:00] with all men and Holiness without which
[1:25:02] no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:25:04] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:25:08] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:25:12] springing up trouble you and therefore
[1:25:15] many be defiled that goes to that quote
[1:25:17] that I just read you
[1:25:19] if a root of bitterness comes up brother
[1:25:21] Brian said what you need to cut it off
[1:25:22] you need help the brother instead of so
[1:25:25] we like to get a brother down and then
[1:25:26] beat him while he's down all right let's
[1:25:28] read what brother Brown said about some
[1:25:30] earning Church age 1960. the only thing
[1:25:32] the matter is got all these little
[1:25:33] differences away from you little isms
[1:25:35] little funny feelings around you for
[1:25:37] brother
[1:25:38] and things like that shake it away don't
[1:25:40] let no root of bitterness ever get into
[1:25:42] your soul if you do it'll conquer you
[1:25:45] right keep love I don't care how much
[1:25:47] people hate you love them anyway
[1:25:50] if you can't do that
[1:25:52] you ain't you the ain't you ain't sealed
[1:25:56] you got a loose place yet
[1:25:58] so come on on back and get that sealed
[1:26:01] up right good with the blood of Christ
[1:26:04] that'll cleanse you from all roots of
[1:26:07] bitterness yes Jehovah Jireh 1957.
[1:26:10] but Abraham the man of God gave lot his
[1:26:13] choice remember Abraham stood there and
[1:26:15] they stood on the mountain and they saw
[1:26:16] the Great Plain over here and it was
[1:26:18] really green grass but there was Sodom
[1:26:22] then you had all this other desert over
[1:26:24] here and Abraham didn't say now bless
[1:26:25] God a lot I'm I'm the one that started
[1:26:29] this thing
[1:26:30] okay I got you out and brought you with
[1:26:33] me which was wrong to begin with but
[1:26:35] Abraham thought he was doing a good job
[1:26:38] but he said now uh or he should have
[1:26:41] said like us like well well
[1:26:46] God spoke to me he spoke to me for
[1:26:49] then I spoke to you so so I so I get the
[1:26:53] green
[1:26:53] you can fight for yourself out there in
[1:26:56] the wilderness I mean in the desert okay
[1:26:58] no but Abraham the man of God gave lot
[1:27:00] his choice and took what was left
[1:27:03] oh I just love that a real believer will
[1:27:06] give you your choice he's willing to
[1:27:09] take what's left there's no selfishness
[1:27:12] and a real believer not at all right
[1:27:18] Romans 12 verse 9 says love be without
[1:27:20] dissimulation in other words strife and
[1:27:23] differences abhor that which is evil
[1:27:25] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[1:27:28] affection one to another with Brotherly
[1:27:30] Love in honor preferring one another
[1:27:33] Luke 6 verse 26 says woe unto you
[1:27:37] when all men speak well of you
[1:27:42] read in Bible
[1:27:44] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:27:47] prophets but I say unto you which here
[1:27:49] love your enemies do good to them which
[1:27:52] hate you
[1:27:53] bless them that curse you and pray for
[1:27:56] them
[1:27:57] that despitefully which means falsely
[1:28:00] accused
[1:28:01] which despitefully use you and to him
[1:28:05] that's modesty on One Cheek
[1:28:07] offering the other him that take away
[1:28:09] your cloak this is the part of the other
[1:28:11] scripture we read take that coat also
[1:28:14] give to every man that asks us of thee
[1:28:16] and of him that taketh away thy Goods
[1:28:18] ask them not again
[1:28:20] and as you would that man should do to
[1:28:23] you do you also to them likewise for if
[1:28:25] you love them which love you what thank
[1:28:27] have you for Sinners also love those
[1:28:30] that love them
[1:28:32] and if you do good to them which do good
[1:28:34] to you what thanks have you think of you
[1:28:36] for Sinners also do even the same and if
[1:28:39] you lend to them who you hope to receive
[1:28:42] ah ah boy that just beat us all right
[1:28:45] there upside the head don't tell me
[1:28:49] at a point in your life you give
[1:28:51] something wanting something in return
[1:28:59] yeah you have if you shake your head
[1:29:01] you're lying
[1:29:04] but it's hard to do
[1:29:06] is to give it with no strings attached
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:12] remember life lesson number 488 Dave
[1:29:16] Ramsey tells us
[1:29:18] don't ever let your kids borrow money
[1:29:19] from you
[1:29:20] right
[1:29:21] give it to them right
[1:29:24] because if you loan it to him he said
[1:29:26] Thanksgiving dinner does not taste the
[1:29:28] same with somebody sitting across the
[1:29:29] table that owes you money
[1:29:32] right and that's the truth
[1:29:37] all right and if you land on them of
[1:29:40] whom you hope to receive what think of
[1:29:42] ye
[1:29:43] for Sinners also lend to Sinners and
[1:29:45] receive as much again but love you your
[1:29:48] enemies and do good and lend hoping for
[1:29:52] nothing again
[1:29:54] and your reward shall be great
[1:29:57] and you shall be the children of the
[1:30:01] highest
[1:30:03] for he is kind unto thee unthankful and
[1:30:07] to the evil first John 4 19 says we love
[1:30:10] him because he first love us loved us if
[1:30:13] a man say I love God and hate us his
[1:30:15] brother he's a liar
[1:30:17] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:30:19] he has seen how can he love God who is
[1:30:22] not seen and this commandment have we
[1:30:26] from him who God that he who loveth God
[1:30:30] loveth his brother also First John 3
[1:30:33] verse 13 says Marvel not my brethren if
[1:30:36] the world hates you
[1:30:38] we know that we have passed from death
[1:30:40] into life because we love the Brethren
[1:30:43] he that loveth not his brother about us
[1:30:45] in death
[1:30:47] whosoever hate us his brother is a
[1:30:49] murderer
[1:30:50] and you know that no murderer has
[1:30:52] eternal life abiding in him wow that's
[1:30:55] pretty strong there John
[1:30:57] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:31:00] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:31:02] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:31:04] brethren but who so hath this world's
[1:31:07] good and see if his brother have need
[1:31:09] and shuteth up his bowels of compassion
[1:31:12] from him how dwelleth the love of God in
[1:31:15] him my little children let us not love
[1:31:18] in Word
[1:31:19] neither in tongue but indeed and in
[1:31:22] truth
[1:31:24] first Peter 3 verse 8 says finally
[1:31:26] be all of One mind having compassion one
[1:31:30] of another love as Brethren be pitiful
[1:31:32] be courteous not rendering evil for evil
[1:31:36] or railing for railing but contrary wise
[1:31:40] blessings
[1:31:42] knowing that you are there unto called
[1:31:44] that you should inherit a blessing for
[1:31:48] he that will love life and see good days
[1:31:50] let him refrain his tongue from evil and
[1:31:52] his lips
[1:31:53] that they speak no guile Mark 11 24.
[1:31:57] therefore I say unto you want things
[1:31:59] whatsoever you desire When you pray
[1:32:00] believe that you receive them and you
[1:32:03] shall have them
[1:32:04] and when you stand praying
[1:32:07] forgive
[1:32:10] if you have awed against any he didn't
[1:32:13] say your favorite
[1:32:16] if you have ought against any that your
[1:32:18] father also which is in heaven May
[1:32:21] forgive you your trespasses
[1:32:24] but if you do not forgive neither will
[1:32:27] your father which is in heaven forgive
[1:32:29] you your trespasses folks that's Divine
[1:32:33] forgiveness because you can forgive the
[1:32:35] hardest part is going to be you forgive
[1:32:37] somebody you're still going to remember
[1:32:39] it
[1:32:40] and it may eat at you if you let it but
[1:32:44] thank God when God forgives you
[1:32:46] it's divine it goes in forget see if God
[1:32:49] forgiveness never to be remembered again
[1:32:51] but it bothers us because we see our
[1:32:54] faults and we see all the failures that
[1:32:55] we have but why don't we start looking
[1:32:57] at Christ inside the person
[1:33:01] but if you do not forgive neither with
[1:33:03] your father which is heaven forgive your
[1:33:05] trespasses in other words your prayers
[1:33:08] have stopped
[1:33:10] thank you
[1:33:12] you get no blessing until you
[1:33:16] forgive
[1:33:18] well I'll forgive them if they'll
[1:33:19] forgive if they'll if they'll come to me
[1:33:22] I I I I'm gonna just forgive him I'm
[1:33:25] gonna write it down put it in my Bible
[1:33:29] that that's that's um
[1:33:31] um that that seems like a holy thing to
[1:33:34] do I'll put it in my Bible
[1:33:36] or I'll put it near a prayer cloth no I
[1:33:39] ain't what it's there
[1:33:41] if you do not forgive neither will your
[1:33:44] father which is in heaven forgive you
[1:33:45] your trespasses so listen you're stuck
[1:33:50] God cannot speak to you until you get
[1:33:54] this taken care of
[1:33:57] why do we have problems
[1:34:00] many are weak and sickly among you in
[1:34:02] many sleep the Bible tells us why
[1:34:04] because we're not discern the body of
[1:34:05] the Lord
[1:34:09] Philippians 2 verse 3 let nothing
[1:34:12] not the vainglory but
[1:34:16] better than themselves
[1:34:19] perfect faith 1963. I want you to look
[1:34:22] at this I found this quote
[1:34:26] now faith is based on forgiveness
[1:34:31] then
[1:34:33] and we'll talk about that a little later
[1:34:34] why don't we get into it right now I
[1:34:35] just want you to see that faith is based
[1:34:37] on forgiveness I want you to kind of run
[1:34:39] that around in your head turn that to a
[1:34:41] Wednesday night
[1:34:42] faith is based on what
[1:34:44] forgiveness I just read you
[1:34:47] if you don't forgive
[1:34:50] God can't use your faith
[1:34:53] to forgive somebody else
[1:34:57] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:35:01] listen 1965 we'll close them uh come on
[1:35:04] musicians
[1:35:05] but because of the selfishness God among
[1:35:08] it the objective was wrong
[1:35:11] signing up a bunch of stuff it would be
[1:35:13] this way when they promised they would
[1:35:15] do it for the kingdom of God but looks
[1:35:17] like it was for themselves
[1:35:20] that's why I say you need to check your
[1:35:22] motive and objective because a lot of
[1:35:23] times we'll say oh this is the will of
[1:35:25] God this is what this is what God wants
[1:35:27] and I'm going to tell you something in
[1:35:29] this message God changes his mind more
[1:35:31] than any other religion there is
[1:35:35] right
[1:35:36] this is the will of God I'm supposed to
[1:35:38] do this and then two months later God
[1:35:41] changes his mind
[1:35:43] and something else happens
[1:35:45] oh I've seen it I don't know if you've
[1:35:46] seen it or not but we you better check
[1:35:48] your motive and objective because look
[1:35:51] it looks like it's for themselves you
[1:35:53] got a lot of self involved when you
[1:35:55] start making these decisions
[1:35:57] and it won't work no selfish thing will
[1:36:00] work your motives and objective has to
[1:36:02] be exactly perfectly right then you have
[1:36:06] faith to ask that's why
[1:36:10] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:36:15] you ever thought about that I hope you
[1:36:16] do now look if our hearts condemn us not
[1:36:20] all right then we have confidence but
[1:36:22] now look let's turn that around if our
[1:36:24] heart does condemn us
[1:36:27] we can't have confidence
[1:36:29] we can't have faith
[1:36:33] we've got to have confidence
[1:36:36] I want this to be the honor and glory of
[1:36:38] God
[1:36:39] then faith has a channel to move into
[1:36:43] if it doesn't then you got mental
[1:36:45] intellectual faith and not genuine Faith
[1:36:48] from God that intellectual faith will
[1:36:50] get you nowhere
[1:36:52] might get you emotional but it won't get
[1:36:56] you the healing that you're looking for
[1:37:01] we might be sick because we can't
[1:37:03] forgive
[1:37:08] I just read you every bit of that and
[1:37:10] that's all the whole summation of the
[1:37:11] whole thing
[1:37:13] we have a lot of problems because we
[1:37:15] can't forgive nobody
[1:37:20] let's stand
[1:37:22] I told you brotherly kindness is right
[1:37:24] up there I mean but listen if you break
[1:37:26] through it watch want much more are we
[1:37:28] going to get
[1:37:30] if we get it revealed to us that we've
[1:37:32] got this South cocoon that we're in and
[1:37:35] we're not going to let anybody in and
[1:37:37] we're not going to get out how are you
[1:37:40] going to display God in a cocoon how are
[1:37:43] you going to display God hiding him
[1:37:44] under a bushel like the Bible tells us
[1:37:46] take can't take the candle and put it
[1:37:48] under a bushel right you're supposed to
[1:37:50] take the cap off of it and let the let
[1:37:52] your what let your let me put it this
[1:37:54] way let your forgiveness shine
[1:37:58] same thing as life let your forgiveness
[1:38:01] shine let somebody say that oh he's the
[1:38:03] most forgiving person in the world
[1:38:06] everybody okay with that well no you're
[1:38:08] probably not I don't want an answer
[1:38:12] protects our life folks
[1:38:15] and it's right there
[1:38:16] where that Holy Spirit has got a you
[1:38:19] know what the Holy Spirit does
[1:38:21] and now down here he saves you right he
[1:38:24] saves you fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:25] right
[1:38:27] all right puts you in service to work
[1:38:30] to let these virtues work when you get
[1:38:32] to that Holy Spirit up there at the top
[1:38:34] that ain't playing around
[1:38:36] that ain't a baby Christian that ain't
[1:38:39] not crying out by father that's somebody
[1:38:41] God is fixing to pour the oil on and
[1:38:44] it's going to seal you in as a unit
[1:38:47] then listen then God can really work
[1:38:49] with you
[1:38:51] the rain the Signet the adoption all the
[1:38:53] different things that's where God can
[1:38:55] work on you because
[1:38:57] we've got to come to that before The
[1:38:59] Headstone comes
[1:39:02] we're ain't talking about The Headstone
[1:39:03] when you talk about adoption and that's
[1:39:05] on two different things
[1:39:08] because they had that you know Paul
[1:39:10] different ones they were way up there
[1:39:11] brother Brown said the early church had
[1:39:13] all these gifts working or gifts or
[1:39:16] these uh virtues working in their life
[1:39:19] working in their life yet they did not
[1:39:22] have the headstone yet they were under a
[1:39:24] closed book
[1:39:25] what about us with an open book
[1:39:28] what a shame it is that we are who we
[1:39:30] are I'm talking about all of us that
[1:39:32] we're stuck in a cocoon of selfishness
[1:39:34] let's be unselfish let's give ourselves
[1:39:37] away
[1:39:39] let's sing a song God bless you
[1:39:41] [Music]

[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:19] I told y'all and I'll tell you again
[1:46:23] I had I had to be raided a minister
[1:46:26] for for something he did which was none
[1:46:29] of my business
[1:46:31] and I held on to that for
[1:46:33] few years
[1:46:38] but one day I
[1:46:40] came to a realization that I wasn't
[1:46:42] going anywhere
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] I mean it was just heavy
[1:46:47] [Music]
[1:46:48] heavy I mean like a load was on top of
[1:46:51] me
[1:46:52] because you know what it's just Rebecca
[1:46:54] I would I would I'd get a sermon
[1:46:57] give me a minute
[1:46:59] I'd get a sermon and I think man this is
[1:47:01] good
[1:47:03] everybody's gonna really enjoy
[1:47:07] they really enjoyed sleeping through it
[1:47:09] that was about all I got out of it
[1:47:12] the Lord let me go through that for a
[1:47:14] while
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:18] always
[1:47:21] there was a little voice inside says you
[1:47:24] got to make that right
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:29] now listen
[1:47:32] one thing about this whole situation is
[1:47:35] is God had enough confidence in me
[1:47:40] to tell me that
[1:47:43] if he didn't have any confidence he's
[1:47:44] not going to waste his voice and tell
[1:47:46] you you need to do it
[1:47:48] foreign
[1:47:49] but I'll promise you
[1:47:52] you talking about a load being lifted by
[1:47:55] just picking up the phone
[1:47:57] and calling the brother and say look man
[1:47:59] I'm sorry
[1:48:00] I said something against you that you
[1:48:02] did of your own accord and it was your
[1:48:04] business and I didn't have any business
[1:48:06] talking about your business
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] and he said brother wait he said you're
[1:48:13] forgiving he said won't you come preach
[1:48:14] for me
[1:48:16] but you're talking about when I hung
[1:48:18] that phone up
[1:48:19] you talking about feeling clean
[1:48:22] you know you get out
[1:48:23] get out
[1:48:24] I'm not saying the rest of you not
[1:48:26] workers but Donnie gets in and he gets
[1:48:28] Grime all over him and he's got you know
[1:48:29] he's got soot and and tar and and oil in
[1:48:33] places he shouldn't have it because he
[1:48:35] worked all day he got into his job and
[1:48:37] boy what a nice thing she was like
[1:48:40] in the shower
[1:48:42] right
[1:48:43] same way with all of us Jim's like
[1:48:45] you've been in the garden all day take a
[1:48:47] shower but don't you feel refreshed when
[1:48:49] you do it no matter how tired you are
[1:48:52] you get in that shower and you left a
[1:48:54] water run you just kind of you know you
[1:48:56] sing a little bit and you kind of let
[1:48:57] the water and you you massage yourself
[1:48:59] with that's what you give soap for is
[1:49:00] and massage yourself with you know that
[1:49:02] it's not the cleanest just to massage
[1:49:03] you anyhow but uh
[1:49:06] don't you feel good you're feeling you
[1:49:08] know brother Gary different one you got
[1:49:09] sawdust in his ear and he got sawdust in
[1:49:11] his hair and Julie's like nope go shower
[1:49:13] and you go take a shower and you feel so
[1:49:16] clean well that's how I felt when I got
[1:49:17] off the phone with that brother
[1:49:19] and then I would then you know what I
[1:49:21] went on with the Lord
[1:49:25] I made it through that hurdle
[1:49:27] it's not just saying I mean me you got
[1:49:30] to do the same thing I'll promise you
[1:49:32] but now listen
[1:49:34] here's the sad part
[1:49:37] if you're not his child
[1:49:39] he won't condemn you
[1:49:45] right
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:47] remember you're a bastard child
[1:49:49] he ain't got to take care of you he has
[1:49:52] no he only his Genesis 1 26 kids
[1:49:57] so if you say now come on throw tomatoes
[1:50:00] at me please if you say oh that don't
[1:50:02] bother me you're not born again
[1:50:07] why'd you stop playing
[1:50:13] Tomatoes at me or what
[1:50:17] but now listen you're not because
[1:50:19] there's nothing in there
[1:50:22] to bounce off of
[1:50:25] to live this right here how many you
[1:50:27] tell me how many people in the world
[1:50:28] that's not born again can live what I
[1:50:30] just preached today not one to the T
[1:50:35] but he's made it where we can
[1:50:38] cause he's a good daddy that will bring
[1:50:40] these to your remembrance oh we like for
[1:50:42] him to bring the good things to our
[1:50:44] remembrance
[1:50:45] yeah but what about the things he says
[1:50:47] hey you're not going any further till
[1:50:49] you get that right
[1:50:51] it's going to hinder you
[1:50:53] until you get it right but all when you
[1:50:56] get it right
[1:50:57] what has he done he's taken that
[1:51:00] rapper off and now you can move to the
[1:51:03] next thing
[1:51:04] and now you can move to the next thing
[1:51:05] now you can move to the next phase of
[1:51:08] your Christian Journey but I promise you
[1:51:10] you won't move until you get to a place
[1:51:12] to where you can forgive
[1:51:15] and not expect something in return I
[1:51:17] didn't expect the brother Dave to to you
[1:51:20] know I knew what he would do I knew he
[1:51:23] would forgive me
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] but I had to hear it for myself
[1:51:27] I had to get it clear with me
[1:51:30] was it for him nope it was for me
[1:51:35] he probably never thought a word about
[1:51:37] it because he never heard what I said
[1:51:39] but when I told him he said well bless
[1:51:41] God you shouldn't have nothing out I'm
[1:51:43] gonna hang up on you
[1:51:45] well that would have showed who he was
[1:51:50] but he said brother wait he said don't
[1:51:52] worry about it he said
[1:51:53] I forgive you
[1:51:55] he said now come preach for me what
[1:51:57] happened yeah but I will I've never been
[1:51:59] I haven't been up that way in a while so
[1:52:01] but uh it just made but then it makes
[1:52:03] you feel a lot better though let's don't
[1:52:05] carry these weight what the Bible say
[1:52:06] these weights that so easily beset us
[1:52:13] can you run better with your pound pack
[1:52:15] on your back or with nothing on your
[1:52:17] back
[1:52:18] you can run a lot better with nothing on
[1:52:20] your back well if you carry the load out
[1:52:22] that door don't get it right it's a 50
[1:52:24] pound bag of junk on your back
[1:52:27] that you know what you're doing you're
[1:52:28] carrying it
[1:52:31] you're carrying it
[1:52:33] selfishly
[1:52:36] because you're saying they need to come
[1:52:39] to me
[1:52:40] or I don't have to really do that
[1:52:44] but who are you heaping coals on then
[1:52:47] you're heaping coals on yourself
[1:52:50] take that thing off
[1:52:52] let's give it away take care of it
[1:52:54] there's there's one way to do it and
[1:52:56] that's to forgive and be forgiven
[1:52:59] brotherly kindness
