[2:59] alone for God on the mountain is still
[3:01] God in the valley see when things go
[3:05] wrong he'll make them right and the god
[3:07] of the good times is still God in the
[3:09] bad times the god of the day is still
[3:12] God in the night we took the faith when
[3:15] we're up on them on but the talk comes
[3:17] easy one life that is best but it's down
[3:21] in the valley of trials and temptation
[3:23] that's when your faith is really put to
[3:26] the test sing a song that's a good so
[3:31] okay we're gonna use the Bible story
[3:33] we're gonna read a lot on the Bible

[4:56] Aldie according to all that the LORD
[4:58] commanded him in hominin and his sons

[6:09] three wives the son with them into the
[6:14] earth
[6:31] and they went in to know off into the
[6:35] park two and two of all flesh where is
[6:38] the fire and the flood was forty days
[6:53] upon the earth and the water increased
[6:56] and bare up the ark and it was lifted
[6:59] above the earth and the waters and the
[7:16] waters were prevailed exceedingly upon
[7:18] the earth and all the high hills that
[7:21] were under the whole heaven were covered
[7:23] and all flesh died that moved upon the
[7:34] earth

[7:38] beast and every creeping thing that
[7:40] creepeth upon the earth and every man

[7:53] it which was upon the face of the ground
[7:55] both Man and cattle and the creeping
[7:58] things and they follow of the heaven and
[8:01] they will destroy it from the earth and
[8:03] not only remain alive and then they were
[8:06] with him in the ark and God remember
[8:16] Noah in every little chapter eight first
[8:19] one and God remembered Noah and every
[8:22] living thing and all the cattle that was
[8:24] with him in the ark and God made a went

[13:11] saying you are Ram s what does that
[13:20] trench around the mountains brother
[13:22] brother said let's see some of the
[13:24] unusual things of this I just said what
[13:27] was the attraction just before judgment
[13:29] struck the world and destroy about
[13:31] watering an old man at around 120 years
[13:35] old filming both when there was no water
[13:38] to float in it up there for years
[13:42] standing and or building away on the
[13:45] interior on the hand side and pitching
[13:47] it inside and out and saying there were
[13:50] the world's going to be swallowed up
[13:52] with water in the great scientific age
[13:55] what is that coming out on the hill up
[13:58] there father there's an old man by the
[14:00] name of Noah he's up there in old
[14:03] phonetic the old man stood in the Sun
[14:06] too long
[14:07] yeah that's me that's what I can't
[14:09] pronounce a he's he's sunstroke he's out
[14:15] of his mind he's building what he calls
[14:17] an arm and saying water's coming from up
[14:20] there word there's no water and it's
[14:22] going to pull all the people around and
[14:26] everybody that don't hear his message
[14:27] and everybody they won't comment
[14:30] is going to be drowned did you ever hear
[14:33] of such a thing it was an unusual
[14:36] attraction I imagine when the people
[14:39] wanted a good laugh they went up and
[14:41] stood before the door and that well you
[14:44] said it was going to rain a hundred
[14:46] years ago grandpa tell me they heard you
[14:50] up there saying it was going to rain and
[14:52] you're still beating around on the whole
[14:55] piece of wood up here why don't you get
[14:59] next to yourself but he was gone
[15:02] generated to confirm a promise and to
[15:05] fulfill the prophecy that his prophet
[15:07] had made very unusual God fulfilling his
[15:11] promise to know what others was laughing
[15:14] God was also getting ready to make
[15:16] history to show others even to this day
[15:19] that he keeps his word no matter how
[15:22] unreal it seems and unreasonable he
[15:25] still keep his word he was making an
[15:27] example of the old man pounding on the
[15:31] order for these people here in America
[15:33] tonight all over the world no matter
[15:37] what science says what they say this or
[15:40] that or the other he still keeps his
[15:43] word he was making history
[15:55] let's go to Genesis 19 27 to 29
[16:35] and everyone get up early in the morning
[16:37] to the place where he stood before the
[16:40] Lord and God look toward Sodom and
[16:43] Gomorrah and to work all the land on a
[16:45] plane and the hill and without the smoke
[16:47] of the country went up at the smoke of
[16:49] that furnace and it came to pass from
[16:52] God destroy the cities of the plain and
[16:54] God remember Abraham and sandlot are the
[16:57] midst of the overthrow when he overthrew
[17:00] the cities in which love dwell I got
[17:04] that's an awesome honor
[17:19] Genesis in 1916 and well they lingered
[17:22] the man laid hold upon his hand and upon
[17:24] the hand of his wife upon the hand of
[17:26] his two daughter the Lord be merciful
[17:28] unto Him they brought him forth and set
[17:30] him without the city and he came to
[17:33] class when they had brought them for
[17:35] abroad that he said escape for the life
[17:38] look not behind it neither stay be in
[17:41] all the pain escaped to the mountains
[17:44] this not be consumed and not said unto
[17:47] them oh no so my lord
[17:50] and behold now that servant that found
[17:53] grace in thy sight and not as magnified
[17:55] that mercy we start a show unto me in
[17:59] saving my life and I cannot escape to
[18:02] the mountain least some he will take me
[18:04] and die behold now the city is near to
[18:08] flee unto it and it's a little oh and
[18:11] make me a scary theater it's not a
[18:13] little one and my soul shall live and he
[18:16] said unto him see I have sceptic be
[18:19] concerned this thing also that I that I
[18:22] will not overthrow the city for a priest
[18:24] dollar spoken as the escaped theater or
[18:28] I cannot do anything till he become
[18:31] theater therefore the name of the city
[18:34] was called storm and this time what is
[18:36] risen upon the earth will not enter into
[18:39] soul and the Lord rained upon Sodom and
[18:46] Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the
[18:48] Lord out of heaven and he overthrew
[18:50] those cities and all the pain and all
[18:52] the helmet the inhabitants of the city
[18:54] and then which grew upon the ground but
[18:57] his wife looked back from behind and she
[19:01] became a pillar of salt
[19:05] [Applause]
[19:18] Genesis 22:1 214 and it came to pass
[19:29] after these things that God did tempt
[19:31] Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he
[19:34] said behold Here I am and he said take
[19:37] now thy son my only son Isaac whom I
[19:40] love us and get T into the land Ohio see
[19:45] I can say that 1mm and offer him there
[19:49] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[19:51] mountains which shall tell thee in
[19:55] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[19:58] settled his ass and to two of his young
[20:01] men with him and Isaac his son and
[20:03] cleave the wood for the burnt offering
[20:05] rose up and went into the place that
[20:09] which God had told him then on the third
[20:12] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[20:15] the place afar off and Abraham said unto
[20:18] his young man I buy you here with a s
[20:21] and I am the lad will go yonder and
[20:24] worship and come again to you and
[20:27] Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[20:28] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[20:31] and he took the car and his landing
[20:33] knife and they went both of them
[20:36] together and nicely
[20:38] expect unto Abraham his father said my
[20:42] father and said Here I am my son and he
[20:45] said Behold the fire and the wood but
[20:47] there's the lamb for a burnt offering
[20:49] and Baberaham said my son God will
[20:53] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[20:56] offering so they went both of them
[20:58] together they came to the place which
[21:00] God told him up and then Abraham built
[21:03] an altar and laid the wood and the altar
[21:05] and bound Isaac his son and laid him on
[21:08] the altar upon the wood and Abraham
[21:11] stretched forth his hand and two
[21:13] knife to slay his son and the angel
[21:16] adore call onto him out of heaven and
[21:18] said Abraham Abraham you said Here I am
[21:23] and he said they not my hand upon my lad
[21:26] neither do anything unto him from now I
[21:29] know that thou fearest God seeing thou
[21:32] has not withheld thy son my only son
[21:35] from me and every time lifted up his
[21:38] eyes and looked behold behind him a ram
[21:41] caught in the thicket by his horns and
[21:43] Abraham went and look the RAM took the
[21:47] RAM and upper hand up for a burnt
[21:48] offering instead of his son and Abraham
[21:53] called the name of that place Jehovah
[21:56] Jireh it is said to this day in the
[21:59] mouth of the Lord it shall be seen and
[22:03] mountains are not as high as the
[22:04] mountains but it's still like a
[22:29] let's go to Exodus 3 1 through 12
[22:42] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[22:45] father-in-law priest the median age he
[22:49] let that the backside of the desert
[22:51] cake to the mountain then the angel of
[22:57] the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of
[22:59] fire other miss Bella worsening he
[23:02] looked and behold the bush burned with
[23:04] fire and the bush was not consumed and
[23:06] Moses said I will not turn outside and
[23:09] see this great star in the village is
[23:11] not burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[23:15] turned aside to see God called unto Him
[23:19] other mister bush and said Moses and
[23:22] Moses and he stayed here on him he said
[23:24] roll not not not hither put up thy shoes
[23:29] from thy feet for the place where thou
[23:32] standard is holy ground more always said
[23:36] I am the God of thy father the God of
[23:38] Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of
[23:40] Jacob and Moses did his face where he
[23:43] was afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[23:46] said I should have seen the affliction
[23:48] on my people which are in Egypt and have
[23:51] heard their cry by the reason of the
[23:53] test message for and on their sorrows
[23:56] and I come down to deliver them other
[23:58] than plain an Egyptian and to bring them
[24:02] up out of the land of the good land and
[24:04] the Lord onto a land flowing with milk
[24:07] and honey unto the place of the
[24:10] Canaanites the Hittites and amaura
[24:12] and pursue tights and the HIPAA tights
[24:14] and all the other sites nothing good
[24:17] now therefore behold the cry that
[24:19] children israel is come unto me and i
[24:22] also seen the oppression where the
[24:25] egyptians of president
[24:27] come on therefore now assembly or to
[24:29] fair that on his bring forth my people
[24:32] the children of Israel out of Egypt and
[24:34] Moses said unto God Who am I that I
[24:37] should go unto Pharaoh and they thought
[24:40] she bringing for the children of Israel
[24:41] out of Egypt
[24:42] and he said certainly I will be with
[24:47] thee and this shall be a token of to be
[24:49] that I am sandy when not has brought for
[24:52] the people are the Egypt you shall serve
[24:55] upon this mountain for you are not
[25:03] coming to the mount that might be
[25:04] touched and they burned with fire and -
[25:10] no I'm sorry this is Hebrew for me
[25:14] Hebrews 12 18 24
[25:22] well you're not coming to the mount that
[25:24] might be touched and that probably the
[25:26] fire they do blackness and doctor
[25:30] detective and this time the trumpet and
[25:33] the voice are the words which I heard in
[25:36] the treat that the work should not be
[25:38] spoken to them anymore well they could
[25:41] not endure that which was commanded in
[25:43] his soul as much as the beast touch the
[25:46] mountain it shall be stoned or trusted
[25:49] through with adorable and so terrible
[25:51] was the sight that mother said is nearly
[25:54] fear and quake but you are come unto
[25:58] Mount Zion and on Thursday the Living
[26:01] God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[26:04] innumerable company of angels
[26:13] the show the father brother says is it's
[26:16] like a three-foot rule you've got 12
[26:18] inches here that 24 inches here you got
[26:22] 36 inches here but it's the same rule
[26:25] God the Father was revealing himself
[26:28] falling himself trying to get to men God
[26:36] the Father was manifested in a pillar
[26:38] father that hung on the mountain even
[26:40] Moses dread the quake is that right if
[26:44] any even a beast come near the mountain
[26:47] had to be trusted through with the door
[26:49] is that way the same God was manifested
[26:52] in flesh and dwelt among us and ever in
[26:54] a virgin born body in the order take
[26:59] away our sin do you believe that that
[27:01] God was a son he believed that is the
[27:05] same God my father and I are one I
[27:08] thought that dwell in me it's not me
[27:10] that doeth the works it's my father
[27:12] the hello Jesus talking about his father
[27:15] the same God revealed down here in a
[27:18] body of flesh one in a pillar of fire a
[27:25] personal experience of God and now Moses
[27:28] had been a bitter failure
[27:30] but out there now see we see his
[27:33] attention I took their burning bush and
[27:36] he looks to the burning bush to find out
[27:38] what the trouble was a little walk
[27:40] wolves walking closer to it far usually
[27:43] brings an attraction usually the Holy
[27:45] Spirit when it comes to in a manner of
[27:48] are attracts the attention of people and
[27:50] when Moses turn outside to see a sight
[27:54] to consider the burning tree they would
[27:56] not burn up God spoke to him if fresh
[28:00] fishing by an angel
[28:05] law or grace when God the Father in the
[28:09] form of a big cloud hung over the
[28:10] children of Israel and when he said on a
[28:12] mountain morning to write the law wait
[28:16] even if an animal touched among he must
[28:18] be trusted through with the door only
[28:20] through sanctification is he bringing
[28:24] moves it up said Aaron way down at the
[28:27] bottom hill to watch and to keyboard and
[28:29] nothing and when they feel afar said on
[28:32] a mom it lightning bursted forth and the
[28:35] tons of the rover that blackness settle
[28:37] for Jehovah God the creator of all
[28:39] Eternia settle up on top of the mountain
