[31:33] but we'll go to Ezekiel 36 and then
[31:36] we'll just read and try to continue the
[31:38] message on from this morning of what we
[31:41] were talking
[31:42] abouten let's pray father we thank
[31:45] you thank you for you Lord most of all
[31:50] thank you for all things thank you for
[31:52] these children Lord that want to sing
[31:54] and and to do Lord and to show us how

[32:11] they are being prepared now we love you
[32:14] and we thank you we ask you now that you
[32:16] would just come as we read your word and
[32:18] you would speak to our hearts and our
[32:20] lives and that we may hear from you this
[32:22] day and Grant understanding we pray
[32:25] you'd bless each thought and idea that
[32:28] it may be according to your will we love
[32:30] you in Jesus name
[32:34] amen I said we get Ezekiel 36 so I
[32:37] decided we' just go ahead and try to
[32:39] cover it today but what I want to do now
[32:41] I want you to drop back up with me to to
[32:44] verse 22 read the whole thing it's
[32:47] talking about Israel right but this is
[32:49] not this is is Scofield even got any the
[32:52] future Israel of restoration and
[32:55] conversion all right and that's what it
[32:57] will be right because see natural I mean
[33:01] you know the 144,000 of Israel one day
[33:05] will go through this situation also
[33:07] because they're going to receive uh the
[33:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost once we get
[33:11] out of here right but we are the
[33:14] spiritual Israel so we'll see the parts
[33:16] you know and that way we can understand
[33:18] what'll happen to them at the end of of
[33:21] the doing so all right verse
[33:25] 22 therefore say unto the house of
[33:27] Israel thus sayith the Lord God I do not
[33:31] this for your sakes oh House of Israel
[33:34] but for mine Holy Name sake now I like
[33:37] that right he's going to keep his word
[33:40] which you have profaned among the
[33:41] Heathen whether you went and I will
[33:45] sanctify my great name which was
[33:48] profound profaned among the Heathen
[33:51] which ye have profaned in the midst of
[33:53] them and the Heathen shall know that I
[33:56] am the Lord sayith the Lord God when I
[34:00] shall be when I shall be Sanctified in
[34:03] you before their eyes right for I will
[34:06] take you from among the Heathen and
[34:08] gather you out of all countries and will
[34:11] bring you into your own land then I will
[34:14] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[34:16] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[34:19] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[34:22] you a new heart also will I give you and
[34:26] a new spirit and and I will put and a
[34:29] new spirit will I put within you and I
[34:32] will take away the Stony heart out of
[34:35] your
[34:37] flesh and I will give you an heart of
[34:39] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[34:43] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[34:46] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[34:49] them and you shall shall dwell in the
[34:52] land that I give to your fathers and you
[34:54] shall be my people and I will be your
[34:57] God you may be seated the Lord add his
[34:59] Blessing to the reading of the word as I
[35:02] said this is this is a
[35:05] prophecy all right a
[35:09] prophecy of what will happen to the
[35:12] children of Israel
[35:14] 144,000 in the uh end time after the the
[35:18] bride but it's speaking of you and
[35:21] I and telling us what will take place
[35:24] you know in each one of us uh that
[35:27] receives the new birth because that's
[35:29] really what it's dealing with and I want
[35:30] to cover that now with what we were
[35:32] doing and I I want to
[35:36] uh just back up just a little bit and
[35:38] not say much but you know I want you to
[35:42] follow me in the message and then you
[35:47] you at least see what I believe the new
[35:50] birth is cuz I believe the new birth is
[35:53] the birth of the
[35:54] word but I believe you must hear that
[35:56] word
[35:59] you know because it was never in the
[36:01] Bible that the Holy Ghost fell on anyone
[36:03] that had not heard the word first you
[36:06] know and and in doing that then we we
[36:09] know that Faith cometh by hearing and
[36:12] hearing by the word so we we must hear
[36:14] first and then the Holy Ghost can come
[36:17] and Quicken that word and we were
[36:19] talking about the soul and how the soul
[36:22] of the individual is the real you and uh
[36:25] you know being that I gave you something
[36:28] because uh I made a statement this
[36:31] morning and I I knew the point was Dire
[36:34] and but I made the statement and I still
[36:37] make the statement that I don't believe
[36:40] Satan is a
[36:42] soul now you may differ and I'll even
[36:45] read what brother Ram says here that
[36:47] sounds like it's contrary to what I'm
[36:49] saying and you take what he
[36:51] says but uh you know that way give the
[36:54] other on out but uh see I don't believe
[36:58] he's a
[36:59] soul because he would be created in the
[37:02] image of God that's right I believe
[37:04] Satan is the anointed chur right right
[37:08] that Stood Beside the Lord all right but
[37:10] he's not a soul see he is a spirit
[37:14] being created a spirit being he wasn't
[37:18] created to be a human being that's
[37:22] right and not but doing that then it
[37:24] would not require him to even have a
[37:27] soul
[37:29] and then to me see the soul is more
[37:32] real than what Satan is right right
[37:35] that's the point I'm W you to see now as
[37:39] the part that he perverted the nature of
[37:41] our soul he became our ruler
[37:47] right I mean Satan became actually our
[37:50] our U kin folks but then that's where
[37:53] the new birth comes in
[37:57] the new birth comes in to take us away
[37:59] from Satan being kin folks and us being
[38:02] kin folks to God by the birth of the
[38:05] soul but now I I I knew this quote was
[38:08] here but I tried to find it this morning
[38:11] in I couldn't find it in Brother Richard
[38:13] Wilson called me during the service and
[38:15] he said he he he said I want to know
[38:17] what you think says does Satan have a
[38:20] soul and I said no sir I just got
[38:21] through making that statement to the
[38:24] people this morning I do not believe
[38:26] Satan has a soul I'm just as honest as I
[38:28] can be about it and and you know because
[38:32] it would make him to be a
[38:35] person cuz a person is a soul right and
[38:39] Satan's not a person he's a
[38:41] spirit he's a created uh spiritual being
[38:44] let's see
[38:47] uh brother Rand says on page 9 99 of the
[38:51] Ephesians which is church edge book he
[38:54] says he's talking about Satan can't be a
[38:56] creator
[38:57] and all he couldn't be that cuz said for
[39:00] he is only a created spirit being he's
[39:04] not a he's not a a person like we are
[39:07] he's a spirit right he's the the head
[39:10] Spirit yeah and he was created and was
[39:12] standing beside the Lord but there's
[39:14] where the catch of it is see that
[39:17] brother Bram made the statement he said
[39:19] no man is a match for the devil all
[39:22] right but I believe ever born again
[39:26] believer if you you were just bornn
[39:28] again right
[39:30] now amen that you're more that you're
[39:33] capable of handling the the devil if you
[39:36] follow What God
[39:38] Says see no man is a match what brother
[39:41] R said the holy spirit is so if you get
[39:44] the new bird I believe it you know I'm
[39:46] glad that's come up to where I can make
[39:48] that statement as strong as I can make
[39:50] it cuz I believe every Born Again
[39:53] believer Satan's not a match for you
[39:55] anymore that's right no man by no person
[39:59] in our natural concept or thoughts you
[40:02] know of intelligence or Daniel was a
[40:05] wisest of all men it would be called and
[40:07] but he wouldn't a match for the devil
[40:09] right but one person that is born
[40:13] again that soul and that individual by
[40:15] the new birth having eternal life that
[40:18] makes you more than a match for the
[40:20] devil CU he cannot comprehend what's
[40:22] going on now I believe that now but I'll
[40:25] read you what brother R said then you
[40:27] can just make up your mind of what you
[40:28] you think about what I'm saying and and
[40:31] you know I'm not the final Authority
[40:32] anyway I'll just tell you what I believe
[40:34] but I will tell you what I believe right
[40:36] I well I don't know about that sound
[40:39] like his quotes this way and they sound
[40:40] like his quotes that way sound like the
[40:43] other no I just tell you what I believe
[40:45] then you can go from that point but
[40:47] let's look at it that day on Calvary 196
[40:52] 925 he said there was a requirement for
[40:55] sin requirement was death death death
[40:58] with his penalty and that is we could go
[41:01] into great details of this because I do
[41:04] not believe that there is but one death
[41:08] there is one
[41:09] life all right and I believe a man that
[41:12] has eternal life can never die right I
[41:16] believe that there is a complete
[41:17] annihilation of that soul that sins for
[41:21] the Bible said so the soul that sinth it
[41:24] shall die not the man the soul in it so
[41:29] Satan must surely die to be completely
[41:34] destroyed how I disagree with the
[41:36] universalists that say that Satan will
[41:38] be
[41:39] saved now see they say he can be saved
[41:42] cuz they say he's got a soul now that's
[41:44] the point I want to make watch it see
[41:47] for him to be able to be saved you're
[41:48] going to have to be saved and he's got a
[41:49] soul that's
[41:51] right now I don't believe the devil can
[41:53] be saved
[41:55] right he didn't have to fall now that
[41:58] was his choice but once he done that
[42:01] there's no salvation for him I'm sorry
[42:03] for the old boy you know that's what I'm
[42:05] saying any Born Again believer then is a
[42:08] match for the devil if you'll let the
[42:10] Holy Spirit lead you now you seen the
[42:12] way I said
[42:13] that you said well the devil will jump
[42:15] on this way the other hey he jumps all
[42:18] the time you know but if we'll just let
[42:22] God be the one from the soul that'll
[42:24] take care of it because we greater is he
[42:26] that is in you
[42:27] than the devil let me put it that way
[42:29] and paraphrase the scripture but look
[42:30] what he said I disagree with the
[42:32] Universalist that say Satan will be
[42:34] saved he sinned and he's the originator
[42:37] of sin his soul sinned and he was a
[42:41] spirit that Spirit shall to be totally
[42:44] annihilated to be nothing left of it now
[42:49] you can take that and you can read it
[42:50] and say well now Satan's got a
[42:54] soul but now this is the way I read it
[42:58] how did I disagree with the
[43:01] Universalist that say Satan can be
[43:04] saved yeah he
[43:06] sinned and he's the originator of
[43:09] sin see and they
[43:12] say the Universalist say his soul
[43:20] sinned you you can read it the way you
[43:22] want to that's the way I read cuz I knew
[43:24] the quote was there I told Brother
[43:26] Richard I said I know the quot quote I I
[43:27] knew it was there but I don't believe
[43:31] Satan has a soul not a soul of what I'm
[43:34] talking about you can call him a
[43:37] nature yeah cuz he does that he's got a
[43:39] nature about him right cuz he's trying
[43:41] his best to inflict us with that nature
[43:43] that's right amen right we see then he
[43:47] he'd have to be a he'd be created in the
[43:49] image of God angels were not created in
[43:52] the image of God man was the first one
[43:56] created in the image of
[43:57] God Satan had already fallen before Man
[44:01] was created in that image so you know I
[44:04] mean that's the way I read it so it's up
[44:05] to
[44:08] you because he didn't he said and his
[44:10] soul sinned and he was a spirit what's
[44:14] he saying they believe his soul sinned
[44:16] they believe he can be saved I don't
[44:19] believe Satan can be saved that's
[44:22] right cuz once he sinned I don't believe
[44:25] there salvation for Angels
[44:29] right no I mean I don't believe that you
[44:33] can if you want to that's up to you but
[44:34] I don't believe Angels you know can be
[44:37] saved that's
[44:38] right Angelic beings are Angelic beings
[44:41] that's right created for a wonderful
[44:43] purpose for helping the IRS of
[44:46] salvation but not made a soul so that's
[44:49] that's up to you now I gave you the one
[44:51] down under the next one to show you that
[44:53] even his offspring through uh uh the
[44:57] Beast brother BR said on the on
[45:00] questions and anwers of 64 there
[45:02] paragraph 1
[45:05] 11:31 he said that talking about the
[45:08] Beast he said he's smarter he almost had
[45:11] a soul the Beast almost had a soul he
[45:15] had a place for a
[45:17] soul but what did he do he sold out to
[45:20] Satan's deceiving to dece Satan to
[45:23] deceive God trying
[45:25] to see the Beast didn't have a
[45:29] soul man was the first one created right
[45:33] see in the true image of God right amen
[45:37] and that Soul was created as I've tried
[45:39] to bring down to you and bring in the
[45:41] theophany so where would you put Satan
[45:44] that's just me now you can you can argue
[45:46] the point and I'm I said I'm not the
[45:48] final Authority I'm just the one telling
[45:50] you what I believe and then I don't mind
[45:52] telling you uh you know cuz we know
[45:57] Satan's a spirit right amen he's a
[45:59] spiritual being right in that way then
[46:01] he wouldn't be a human being and that's
[46:03] a you can you can take that for whatever
[46:05] you want to and out there on the
[46:08] internet you'll know that I'm just as
[46:09] blunt as I can be and I'm not different
[46:12] with brother
[46:13] Brandon you know right and what would it
[46:16] matter if Satan did have a soul but I
[46:18] don't believe he did that's just as
[46:19] honest as I can believe it so it's you
[46:21] know we leave it on that cuz I believe
[46:24] what he done he set out to pervert the
[46:26] nature of your soul now I show you a lot
[46:29] where he can't
[46:30] create you know or nothing like that
[46:32] there's no way he can't well then you
[46:34] could go through the point like Brother
[46:35] Richard was bringing out see you and I
[46:37] are little creators by
[46:40] Soul right even then you fall in a state
[46:43] you're a little Creator right see Satan
[46:46] can't be that he can't be a Creator if
[46:50] he had any sense at all he'd take a long
[46:52] vacation and leave us
[46:54] alone but he's the best help we ever had
[46:57] cuz he's forcing us pushing us driving
[47:01] us to bring us to the word cuz that's
[47:04] what them demons are doing right amen
[47:07] all right but now let's get back to what
[47:08] we're talking about so you can have that
[47:10] for whatever you want I'm just and you
[47:12] show me and come and tell me and show me
[47:14] in the message you know where that Satan
[47:16] got a soul and I'll come right back here
[47:18] and tell the church okay right brother
[47:20] so and so showed me this and you know
[47:22] here it is but at least you'll know
[47:25] where I stand that way you can dig for
[47:27] whatever you want to to see if you can
[47:28] find it but I'm not going to worry about
[47:32] it but now
[47:35] listen see Satan perverted the nature of
[47:38] your soul amen coming through your brain
[47:42] as I said this morning down into you cuz
[47:44] he used your head all right and it went
[47:48] with mankind like that for 4,000 years y
[47:53] that mankind was under that domain of
[47:55] Satan
[47:57] the being inflicted and every baby that
[48:00] ever came
[48:01] in they had no
[48:04] opportunity to be anything
[48:07] else and even after the Lord Jesus
[48:10] coming in the 2,000 years every baby is
[48:13] still born the same way coming into the
[48:15] world into Satan's domain and Satan
[48:18] perverts the nature of that soul of that
[48:20] individual to the point that it makes us
[48:23] lost right exactly right okay now but in
[48:27] this dispensation in this time we have
[48:30] an
[48:30] opportunity that mankind didn't have say
[48:33] in the Old Testament in the the times
[48:35] before because we have a chance that's
[48:38] what Jesus was saying to
[48:40] Nicodemus
[48:42] Nicodemus you need to have that soul of
[48:45] yours you need to have the unclean
[48:47] Spirit driven out and maybe that was why
[48:50] that Nicodemus come to ask him the
[48:51] question because he'd heard Jesus say
[48:53] the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man
[48:55] walketh in dry places seek rest you know
[48:57] they kept up with it you better blank on
[48:59] one thing it's just like I was listening
[49:01] the other day and and you say well now I
[49:04] never heard of this message until a
[49:06] certain time brother renam said there's
[49:09] not a
[49:10] denomination that don't know about this
[49:15] message now that was a point to me he
[49:18] said there's not a
[49:19] denomination like I told you the old
[49:21] Baptist preacher that that when I left
[49:24] you know he said s
[49:27] I've heard about this William brandom
[49:29] and I won't say one thing about
[49:33] him he said but now I'd like you talk to
[49:36] other people I said I'd be glad to if
[49:38] you send them to me well he hadn't sent
[49:40] them yet that's 40 something years ago
[49:42] but any he told me I'd be away about 6
[49:45] months well that's been a long 6 months
[49:46] you know he he was a good old man I
[49:49] really really appreciate him a good
[49:51] preacher he could preach he he he he he
[49:53] wasn't in the the making this that he
[49:56] preached about taking the saddle off the
[49:57] horse When you pray you know put it
[50:00] under the barn cuz it's going to get wet
[50:02] you know cuz he believed in prayer right
[50:05] you know and and I appreciate him but
[50:06] now just saying the point that the every
[50:10] person is born in that perverted
[50:14] real I don't care how good your mom and
[50:16] daddy is you said well Mom and Daddy was
[50:19] sweet and wonderful so I'm saved and all
[50:21] that don't make you Sav right you better
[50:24] be careful that'll make you a two-fold
[50:25] child of hell cuz you'll depending on
[50:27] that instead of depending on what God
[50:30] says see don't depend on what so and so
[50:33] done and I like what the way brother
[50:34] around said it he said we can't blame
[50:36] Adam and Eve right I like the way he
[50:39] preaches he said we don't we can't blame
[50:41] Adam and Eve now he said c we're all on
[50:44] free moral
[50:45] agency we everyone has got to make our
[50:48] choice by predestination you know sure
[50:52] God knows the choice but
[50:55] still you going to make the choice but
[50:58] see we got down to talking about how
[51:01] that the the new
[51:05] birth is the birth of that
[51:08] Soul it's eternal life coming and living
[51:11] in you exactly right that is the new
[51:14] birth but it requires for one thing to
[51:16] take
[51:17] place see that's why you anointed ones
[51:20] have you ever thought about why would
[51:22] the Holy Ghost come down on a person
[51:24] Spirit the genuine wi Holy Spirit now
[51:28] the prophet said he said now not
[51:30] something it's the Holy Spirit would
[51:33] come down on a person Spirit Y and just
[51:37] be anointed yep that's
[51:41] right well why would it be that
[51:44] way and maybe they're great religious
[51:46] people maybe they're they're sincere
[51:49] maybe they're sweet humble people but
[51:52] then hear some boot lag Jack lag of a
[51:55] garbage out there some word you know the
[51:57] best to say about all of us
[52:00] mankind and the Holy Spirit can come
[52:02] down and fall into a man's soul and make
[52:05] a child of God
[52:06] Amen that's
[52:10] right you never thought about those
[52:12] things that's right you don't think
[52:14] about you know what is the the
[52:17] difference you see I always love that
[52:19] scripture where it says got there's like
[52:21] four different in each gospel it's
[52:24] listing of what theyve done with the
[52:26] word but one of them says they took the
[52:28] word and held it
[52:30] right I like that right they counted it
[52:35] worthy and by counting it worthy it held
[52:39] on when others even seeing Jesus after
[52:43] his
[52:44] resurrection we're not in the upper room
[52:50] why now I've got them in here or
[52:53] somewhere and I forgot because I took
[52:55] out a bunch while ago notes but brother
[52:57] R said true prophets bring a true birth
[53:01] he said false prophets bring false
[53:05] birth the preaching of the word of God
[53:07] will bring a new
[53:09] birth but people preach the word of God
[53:11] it's being preached around the world
[53:13] today over and
[53:14] over but what is it being done
[53:18] right we inject just one little thing of
[53:22] our own
[53:23] thoughts and the word is no longer pure
[53:26] that's right how can it bring a pure
[53:27] birth that's right
[53:30] right you see what the trouble
[53:33] is the trouble is in the planting of the
[53:35] word right you know I just got to plant
[53:38] and a few seeds into the ground well you
[53:41] know I would know where I planted the
[53:42] corn you I expect it to come up I may
[53:46] get other things volunteered from last
[53:47] year but I don't expect a whole lot to
[53:49] grow in those Rose except what I planted
[53:53] you
[53:54] know because that's that's that's what
[53:56] we're doing and see that's what Jesus
[53:57] was doing he had to plant that seed
[54:01] that's right amen it wouldn't if he just
[54:02] come into the world and said I'm God
[54:04] I'll die for you the way he goes for 3
[54:08] years he preached the
[54:11] gospel got three and a half there that's
[54:13] right preaching the
[54:15] gospel y to let that word get anchored
[54:18] Into the
[54:20] Heart y just kept anchoring it in and
[54:24] you know what what what was the
[54:26] difference in Judas and any of the rest
[54:28] of them when the Bible said he had a
[54:30] part of the ministry Etc right but what
[54:34] was
[54:35] wrong he had one little
[54:38] problem the little thing that he Lov
[54:41] money
[54:44] Y what else you going to say it well he
[54:47] was this that and the other I know what
[54:49] the Bible says that he was a thief from
[54:50] the beginning so he love
[54:54] money but why wouldn't he say
[54:58] right well he went on done it well I
[55:01] believe if he' waited and went on to Cal
[55:03] went on the upper room I believe Satan I
[55:06] mean that he could have been saved as
[55:08] quick as anybody else right but he
[55:10] didn't do it see something got in there
[55:12] right that's the point I'm trying to
[55:14] make to you you see why it's so
[55:17] important to preach the truth yes
[55:21] because if that word is not planted
[55:23] correctly how can the Holy Spirit
[55:25] Quicken it that's right
[55:26] that's right you said brother Dale
[55:29] you're talking to people here that
[55:31] probably 90% claims to be have the new
[55:34] birth that's all right but we'll get
[55:36] down to it maybe in this this evening
[55:39] with what we're talking about maybe you
[55:42] just got a new spirit right cuz you know
[55:45] what with a new spirit you get new
[55:47] desires
[55:49] right
[55:51] right so we better check ourselves out
[55:53] to find out if we are born again that's
[55:57] right and then not do well I believe the
[56:00] message see there's one of them little
[56:02] things that was planted Into the Heart
[56:03] of mankind and that's kept the holy
[56:05] ghost from going into that individual
[56:07] and Quicken the rest of it
[56:09] right they heard the
[56:13] message you know but somebody said well
[56:17] long as you believe the
[56:19] message now that seed went into the
[56:21] heart of an individual and you know that
[56:23] God can't Quicken that that's right amen
[56:27] you think about it yep that's right he
[56:30] can only he can only Quicken the pure
[56:32] word amen he can't Quicken our thoughts
[56:35] and our ideas Eve said I believe right
[56:39] and that's all it
[56:41] took so you think about it what's the
[56:44] difference in you and someone
[56:48] else well I go to church and I believe
[56:50] the prophet's
[56:52] message it's becoming now that this is
[56:55] beginning to be and and I predicted it
[56:58] back probably 5 years ago or something I
[57:00] said if this thing goes on 10 more years
[57:02] they they'll make us a denomination you
[57:04] know on the basis of writing us up for
[57:06] something and they'll because they'll
[57:07] say there's so many of
[57:09] them there's Millions now fallowing this
[57:13] message he said well they're not in the
[57:16] message well that's up to
[57:17] God certainly not me and you decide
[57:20] who's the message and who's not up to
[57:22] God right right would you want to put
[57:25] them to the point that you would want
[57:26] him to be in the message no no but
[57:32] listen then that new birth being a birth
[57:34] of the
[57:36] word so you've got to hear the word
[57:39] faith cometh by hearing that's right
[57:42] you've got to hear the word first and I
[57:45] say it and I keep saying it there's
[57:46] never been a person in the Bible that
[57:48] ever got the holy ghost that didn't hear
[57:49] a message first that's right am show it
[57:52] to
[57:53] me they heard something or knew about
[57:55] something mhm but how many of them also
[57:58] knew about it and didn't get it and S
[57:59] and
[58:00] listen why right well they would
[58:04] predestinated like I
[58:07] am there's one thing about it I hope
[58:09] you've caught what I believe about
[58:11] predestination cuz if you're
[58:13] predestinated you're going to live it
[58:15] you're going to find it you're going to
[58:16] get to it you're not going to worry
[58:18] about it you're not going to listen to
[58:20] to other things you're going to get
[58:22] settled into the word if you're
[58:23] predestinated right cuz only the word is
[58:26] predestinated eternally
[58:29] right but see we'll get back to that but
[58:32] what is it
[58:34] now it takes a revelation for you to be
[58:37] born
[58:39] again that was what Nicodemus couldn't
[58:45] comprehend and neither did the disciples
[58:47] have any understanding in that
[58:50] realm they still right even in the book
[58:53] of Acts after the resurrection of the
[58:54] Lord Jesus after all thing acts 18 I
[58:57] believe it is they still was talking
[58:59] about a natural Kingdom right will you
[59:02] restore this Israel land back to us in
[59:05] other
[59:08] words he said you don't
[59:12] understand it was just left to where
[59:14] they couldn't understand right cuz it
[59:16] takes the new birth to understand it
[59:19] takes the new birth to give you a
[59:20] revelation I'm talking about a holy
[59:21] ghost Eternal Revelation you get a
[59:24] revelation about a situation
[59:26] God can give it to you they gave as I
[59:28] said this morning he gave the little
[59:29] woman a revelation that she's healed cuz
[59:32] that's what the prophet calls Fai for
[59:33] the time in other words a revelation for
[59:36] the time of whatever you have need of
[59:38] right all right but that's not a holy
[59:41] ghost Born Again experience right see
[59:43] that's where everybody wants to put it
[59:44] and they say look at that little woman
[59:45] to the well the word come alive the
[59:47] prophet said but you know where she went
[59:49] she had to go to the upper room to get
[59:50] the new
[59:53] birth Mary gave birth
[59:56] to Jesus Christ but brother R said you
[59:58] can believe what you want to about your
[59:59] mother of God but said she went to the
[1:00:01] upper room to get to baptism of the Holy
[1:00:04] Ghost that's right amen that's right now
[1:00:07] so then you know it's not just I believe
[1:00:11] right right that's just a good place to
[1:00:13] start all right but now listen you're
[1:00:17] Prophet let me hurry up cuz I want to
[1:00:19] get to this other
[1:00:21] part your Prophet on the future home
[1:00:24] explains the new birth amen and he said
[1:00:26] that's where people say oh today it's
[1:00:30] different now I gave you the quote the
[1:00:32] very first line to what you're looking
[1:00:34] at on the the future home message it
[1:00:37] says
[1:00:38] what I've always taught those three
[1:00:41] stages of
[1:00:47] Grace that's coming from this morning
[1:00:49] which is number five on your know all
[1:00:51] right future home I've always taught
[1:00:54] three processes this
[1:00:56] that's right CU people people today say
[1:00:59] oh the new birth today oh yeah back down
[1:01:01] you it was this or it was that but today
[1:01:03] it's just a just a baptism of the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost
[1:01:08] no in this age from isusa Street
[1:01:14] upward you must it's required that you
[1:01:17] be justified now do you hear what I said
[1:01:19] now I didn't mistaken do from isusa
[1:01:22] Street upward it's required the three
[1:01:25] process es right
[1:01:28] justification sanctification and the
[1:01:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost right all
[1:01:33] right so if that's not taught to
[1:01:36] people that's
[1:01:38] right how do you know what to
[1:01:44] do and what breaks my
[1:01:48] heart is to think that I I didn't come
[1:01:50] through
[1:01:51] Pentecost but the most mixed up people
[1:01:55] about about the real New
[1:01:58] Birth I'm talking about old people at
[1:02:02] all it's a Pentecostal people
[1:02:10] right you think about a lot of the
[1:02:13] churches you've been around and a lot of
[1:02:15] preachers you've been around and their
[1:02:17] Pentecostal
[1:02:20] experience and you tell me a one that
[1:02:22] hardly knew anything or even knows
[1:02:24] anything about this message
[1:02:28] I'm sorry right I don't like to be that
[1:02:33] but I like to tell it that's the
[1:02:36] truth but see I believe you must be
[1:02:40] justified I believe that's an actual
[1:02:43] work in you that's right amen it's not
[1:02:46] walk up to the altar I want the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost to turn around walk off and say
[1:02:50] I'm born
[1:02:51] again now that can happen that's right
[1:02:56] that can happen if you know what's going
[1:03:00] on it did to the 3,000 in the book of
[1:03:07] Acts
[1:03:09] right okay
[1:03:11] amen but it didn't to the 120 right
[1:03:15] right that's why the 120 was used to
[1:03:18] write the word out of them you don't use
[1:03:21] a
[1:03:22] novice to write the scriptures
[1:03:26] his personal experience with God before
[1:03:28] he used to write scriptures amen but on
[1:03:31] the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] fell on the 3000 they heard one sermon
[1:03:35] and God went through that with them
[1:03:38] hearing that one sermon step by step as
[1:03:41] those as Peter was preaching that sermon
[1:03:43] until when it
[1:03:45] ended he had laid down such a
[1:03:48] wonderful thing about what the Lord
[1:03:51] Jesus Christ read the book of Acts there
[1:03:52] about it what took place and Jesus died
[1:03:56] and how all the things would happen and
[1:03:58] and all and then they said men and
[1:04:01] brother what must we do to be
[1:04:03] saved or what can we do to be
[1:04:06] saved they repent everyone and be
[1:04:08] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see
[1:04:10] they were brought totally under
[1:04:14] conviction by the Holy
[1:04:17] Spirit working a work in their soul
[1:04:19] because you're not born again in your
[1:04:21] body you're not born again in your
[1:04:23] spirit you're only Born Again In Your
[1:04:25] Soul
[1:04:26] justification drops off the five
[1:04:29] sins of that
[1:04:31] Soul sanctification cleans and sets in
[1:04:35] order the
[1:04:38] individual puts it to a place to where
[1:04:41] it to be clean the unclean Spirit going
[1:04:45] out of
[1:04:48] you right then the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost comes so you got to hear the word
[1:04:53] even the 3,000 they heard a sermon amen
[1:04:56] that's right not they just walked out
[1:04:59] there and said what can we do we'd like
[1:05:01] to have what y'all
[1:05:03] got when they first started hearing it
[1:05:06] they didn't like what they heard
[1:05:07] probably but Peter read that book of
[1:05:10] Acts Peter was laying it down so
[1:05:13] beautiful that's
[1:05:15] right it takes almost a whole chapter
[1:05:17] for him to explain
[1:05:20] right then they want to be saved
[1:05:25] it wouldn't just a halfhazard walk out
[1:05:27] there and the Holy Ghost
[1:05:29] fail I told you anointed ones that's
[1:05:33] Holy Spirit falls on their Spirit but
[1:05:36] the reason they're not born again they
[1:05:38] take some man's ideas and they're
[1:05:40] looking for some form of something I
[1:05:42] need to shout I need to speak in tongu I
[1:05:44] need to cry I need to do it's all laying
[1:05:46] in your nature somewhere right and if
[1:05:49] it's not killed by the word it'll grow
[1:05:52] up and become a big Amor right
[1:06:00] like I said it over and over people say
[1:06:02] what must I do to be saved quit doing
[1:06:04] this quit doing that don't do this do
[1:06:05] that go to church do believe a
[1:06:08] message that's not what the man said he
[1:06:10] ask him what can I do to be
[1:06:14] saved but follow what I'm talking
[1:06:17] about brother random draws three heart I
[1:06:19] mean two hearts there I believe myself
[1:06:21] that that's the one heart he's
[1:06:22] explaining cuz one of them's got a snake
[1:06:24] in it the other got a dove in it right
[1:06:27] if it is two people that's
[1:06:30] fine it's explaining it right but how
[1:06:33] did that get that dove in
[1:06:38] there now he explain they look just
[1:06:40] alike as you see them and they're both
[1:06:42] religious and they're both standing
[1:06:44] there looking alike yeah but one of them
[1:06:47] got a snake in his
[1:06:49] heart now don't tell me that an anointed
[1:06:52] one don't have a snake in the heart I'll
[1:06:53] tell you in a hurry they'll cut you
[1:06:55] pieces that's right and so will the
[1:06:58] people of this message that's
[1:07:02] right that's right you don't believe
[1:07:04] what we preach you're out that's right
[1:07:07] and if you don't come to our church
[1:07:08] you're out amen like I said this morning
[1:07:11] brother randam then say don't think you
[1:07:13] can come to the brandham Tabernacle just
[1:07:15] as bad as anywhere else that's right now
[1:07:18] he's the one make that statement like I
[1:07:20] said dark said brother Neville sitting
[1:07:21] there saying
[1:07:24] amen and brother around I'm saying it
[1:07:27] right it don't have you go to church it
[1:07:30] have you get born again amen right right
[1:07:33] but see I'm trying to get where I'm not
[1:07:34] going to read this but you read what I
[1:07:37] gave you there in a future home
[1:07:38] everybody on the internet can got it
[1:07:39] they can they can read it brother talks
[1:07:42] about justification or repentance being
[1:07:44] the first step amen that's right but he
[1:07:47] says that does nothing to your
[1:07:50] nature it's just repenting of your
[1:07:53] sins you just chopping off occupy
[1:07:57] sins it does nothing to your
[1:07:59] nature it don't give you eternal life
[1:08:05] right you just
[1:08:07] repent he just chopped it
[1:08:10] off he said what caused you to do it is
[1:08:13] still
[1:08:14] there right then he goes down a little
[1:08:17] further in it and he gets into
[1:08:19] sanctification he's talking about the
[1:08:21] unclean Spirit going out
[1:08:26] now I can give you one I wish you'd
[1:08:29] listen but brother brandom I love the
[1:08:31] way he speeches but speaks sometimes but
[1:08:34] sometimes it's hard to understand he
[1:08:36] said on one statement I was looking at
[1:08:38] this the other night he said that
[1:08:39] unclean Spirit went out of its own
[1:08:45] accord walketh in dry places and seeketh
[1:08:48] rest and findeth
[1:08:49] none now what's he talking
[1:08:52] about that unclean Spirit got where he
[1:08:55] couldn't stand that word it was being
[1:08:57] brought in all right so he's exactly
[1:09:00] right the unclean Spirit goes out of its
[1:09:02] own accord why it ain't you saying I'm
[1:09:05] going to drive you out I'm going to
[1:09:06] drive you out that's what I see the
[1:09:08] Pentecostals this message I watch them
[1:09:10] pray for people you know shout and
[1:09:12] scream and shake them and just I watched
[1:09:15] it in
[1:09:16] P one this church in Jamaica and seen
[1:09:19] them take the you know do like this and
[1:09:21] say say it say it say it say it say it
[1:09:23] say it to the little kids you know
[1:09:25] little 10 year old kids and say say s
[1:09:27] trying to get to speak in
[1:09:29] tongues that person didn't I didn't want
[1:09:33] that I just waited and let everybody
[1:09:35] else pray and then I'd go pray cuz
[1:09:38] that's way I've always been I told you
[1:09:39] we was in a prayer line one night and
[1:09:40] they were just praying down through
[1:09:42] there and they was all in that prayer
[1:09:44] line and they were just getting them to
[1:09:45] shout and getting them to cry and I'm
[1:09:46] not against that you think I am I'm not
[1:09:49] I'm wonderbly for it cuz there's
[1:09:51] emotions where a birth is right
[1:09:56] but then I was down on the end and I
[1:09:58] just stop him and I'd say Hey
[1:10:00] listen let's think a little bit what you
[1:10:02] want what do you need I need healing I
[1:10:05] need salvation I'd stop and pray with
[1:10:08] him for a little bit and you know what
[1:10:09] the same ones that shouted down to me
[1:10:11] stopped shouting when they got through
[1:10:13] with that then they started shouting the
[1:10:15] old brother I don't call his name but he
[1:10:17] was just preaching that night he
[1:10:20] kept he's eyeballing
[1:10:23] me and after a while he was down there
[1:10:27] listening and you know the next night
[1:10:29] what he was saying we had prayer line he
[1:10:32] said okay now let's get her B on the
[1:10:34] Lord I said Thank You Lord it caught on
[1:10:37] you see I wouldn't making no scene I was
[1:10:39] just doing my part and going on
[1:10:40] forgetting it cuz that's that's what I
[1:10:43] believe I believe in shouting ain't
[1:10:44] nobody in the world believes in shouting
[1:10:46] any more than I do or crying or
[1:10:49] whatever if it's any if it's a birth
[1:10:51] it's going to be an emotional thing
[1:10:53] babies are not born without a little
[1:10:54] crying or something
[1:10:56] you may have to spank them to get it to
[1:10:57] them but it'll work but listen see what
[1:11:00] is it justification just chops off your
[1:11:03] P
[1:11:05] sins but
[1:11:09] sanctification that hearing of the
[1:11:13] word even if it was in the book of Acts
[1:11:15] of them hearing that message and they
[1:11:17] believed it right there it drove that
[1:11:19] unclean Spirit out as we' call it right
[1:11:22] like I said if you hear enough of the
[1:11:24] word of God now here's a quote from
[1:11:26] Brother R he said can you live close
[1:11:27] enough to God so the devil don't know
[1:11:29] what to do with you he said
[1:11:31] yes
[1:11:33] right you know why cuz he don't like
[1:11:36] it like a man told me at work one time I
[1:11:39] was bragging on he said I don't
[1:11:41] understand you he said I see you out
[1:11:43] here working and he said you work here
[1:11:45] with these
[1:11:46] women and he
[1:11:49] said you don't have no problems do you I
[1:11:51] said no sir don't I said I'm a human
[1:11:53] mortal listen but but I said That's
[1:11:56] supposed to be taken care of he said
[1:11:58] that's what I've watched something to
[1:12:00] this situation he said but I guess it
[1:12:02] would be hard for them to try to flirt
[1:12:04] with you if you said hey have you heard
[1:12:05] about the Lord Jesus
[1:12:07] Christ amen and it
[1:12:10] works you tell me it don't work I'll
[1:12:13] give you a
[1:12:15] quote Lady Come Dancing up to brother
[1:12:17] brandham and a thing that was having it
[1:12:20] to work one night and what did he do he
[1:12:24] said I never die till I
[1:12:26] pray oh
[1:12:28] yeah you need that quote grabbed the
[1:12:31] lady by the hands got down and pray and
[1:12:33] busted the party he went to apologize to
[1:12:36] the boss cuz he busted up the party
[1:12:39] then you get them gooo eyes flirting
[1:12:42] around just start talking about the Lord
[1:12:44] that's
[1:12:47] right of course I've seen people do that
[1:12:49] flirt right on the end of the bedroom
[1:12:51] too talking about the
[1:12:53] Lord you have to
[1:12:57] but just be honest you start talking
[1:12:59] about the Lord it'll drive away them
[1:13:00] Spirits that's what I believe
[1:13:02] sanctification is right cuz I've
[1:13:05] experienced
[1:13:06] it you said Oh no just pray for me and
[1:13:09] cast that demon
[1:13:12] off that's why I love that quote where
[1:13:14] brother R said
[1:13:16] it he said he went out of his own
[1:13:19] accord I really should have brought
[1:13:22] that why he he it got crowded in there
[1:13:27] he just couldn't stand the word
[1:13:30] right you just keep packing that word in
[1:13:32] that Soul something going to happen
[1:13:34] right he said well you're just trying to
[1:13:36] make Christians by reading no no I'm
[1:13:39] trying to make people by reading you
[1:13:42] read G's Almanac and all these other
[1:13:44] filthy stuff won't you try reading the
[1:13:49] Bible get in the car turn turn to switch
[1:13:52] on your car and what I hear the the all
[1:13:55] kind
[1:13:56] of well you get in mind you turn it on
[1:13:59] why' it go you hear that old familiar
[1:14:03] voice the token of this day is the
[1:14:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:14:10] well I love to sit down in the woods in
[1:14:12] about 4 hours sitting there you know I'm
[1:14:14] just listening one t right after another
[1:14:16] just sleeping and just you know he got
[1:14:19] come home she said what you been doing I
[1:14:20] said been
[1:14:22] sleeping I mean hun I hone
[1:14:25] but get the point you can read what the
[1:14:29] prophets had to say but he said second
[1:14:30] early sanctification which sets our mind
[1:14:32] in order for Holiness that's
[1:14:35] right now listen I wish you get this one
[1:14:38] cuz I I didn't have the time I wanted to
[1:14:40] preach this and I will probably repr
[1:14:41] preach
[1:14:42] it but see when
[1:14:44] that when that Holy Spirit comes in at
[1:14:47] sanctification in a work of the Holy
[1:14:49] Spirit of
[1:14:50] sanctification and driving that unclean
[1:14:52] Spirit out you know that what brother R
[1:14:54] says it does
[1:14:55] he said it cleanses and
[1:14:59] claims that territory
[1:15:03] amen that's the reason it goes out see
[1:15:05] Satan can't stand it God comes in and
[1:15:07] lays a claim on your
[1:15:10] soul cleanses it and claims
[1:15:13] it now if it cleanse and claim your soul
[1:15:16] let me go one more step what do you
[1:15:18] think about this old boy out here why
[1:15:20] why do we want to get us a new body
[1:15:22] that's right when this one this cleansed
[1:15:25] and
[1:15:26] cleaned by the Holy Spirit living in us
[1:15:28] not just
[1:15:30] sanctification but by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:31] choosing to dwell in all right you see
[1:15:34] cleanse and claim it set it aside he
[1:15:38] said you've heard him explain it he said
[1:15:39] like a water glass you go out in the
[1:15:41] yard and you see a GL and you pick it up
[1:15:43] he said that's justification you got a
[1:15:45] reason for using it he said but it's
[1:15:47] still dirty is all get out right he said
[1:15:49] you don't take it in the house and use
[1:15:51] it he said no said take it in the house
[1:15:54] and wash it and SC it you know SC it out
[1:15:57] you know hot water boil it
[1:15:59] out he said then it's just now ready for
[1:16:03] service said it doesn't mean it's
[1:16:06] full he said you just got it ready to be
[1:16:08] used but see that's what happens he's
[1:16:11] explaining that sanctification it just
[1:16:13] brings you to a
[1:16:14] place that you're ready to go to work
[1:16:17] for God right but that's where the
[1:16:19] danger part
[1:16:23] is cuz if you don't go on and get to
[1:16:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:16:28] amen you become very religious and
[1:16:30] that's what anointed ones do super
[1:16:33] religious
[1:16:35] people that maybe that unclean Spirit
[1:16:37] has been driven out but Satan comes back
[1:16:40] and finds a house swept and
[1:16:43] garnished and you know what the prophet
[1:16:45] said he'll do to you he said he'll put
[1:16:48] you in church y you better read what
[1:16:51] your Prophet has to say about
[1:16:53] sanctification see most people preaching
[1:16:55] sanctification is the beer bottles goes
[1:16:56] out the liquor goes out and this goes
[1:16:58] out but never preached like
[1:17:01] that he preach to Cleansing and
[1:17:05] claiming you don't believe in quitting
[1:17:07] no don't believe in quitting I believe
[1:17:09] believe in being delivered
[1:17:11] am that unclean Spirit goes out you
[1:17:14] better get something in place of it cuz
[1:17:16] brother brand says when it goes out
[1:17:19] see what goes out with that unclean
[1:17:22] Spirit it don't mean it wor out takes
[1:17:25] out everything see that we get all tied
[1:17:27] up in our mentality of thinking we
[1:17:31] understand no more than when we say you
[1:17:33] get a new spirit in a
[1:17:35] minute does that mean that brother
[1:17:37] collie that he you got your spirit and
[1:17:39] he takes it out puts no spirit in now
[1:17:42] that's that's not what the Bible's
[1:17:43] talking about that's right it's a
[1:17:45] conversion amen right it's converting
[1:17:48] that Spirit from an old adamic way to a
[1:17:51] new way but see when you get to the
[1:17:54] place he said and your Prophet said it
[1:17:56] like this he said he'll send you to
[1:17:58] church the devil don't like to hang out
[1:18:01] in the the Juke joints and the in the
[1:18:03] liquor Hogs and the things like that he
[1:18:05] don't want
[1:18:07] there he likes to go to
[1:18:10] church he's already got them people out
[1:18:13] there he's not concerned with them he
[1:18:15] wants to come to church cuz he likes to
[1:18:18] hear about God that's right he likes to
[1:18:20] know what you believe you see
[1:18:22] sanctification is a cleansing and set
[1:18:24] aside
[1:18:25] and then you got to have the fiery
[1:18:26] baptism to burn out what's left right
[1:18:30] now what's
[1:18:31] left if the unclean Spirit went out
[1:18:33] what's
[1:18:38] left you want to answer that now the
[1:18:40] unclean Spirit goes out of the Soul
[1:18:43] what's
[1:18:45] left
[1:18:50] you right right you
[1:18:54] why owe
[1:18:56] you that's what's
[1:18:58] left Y and what you a sinner Satan has
[1:19:03] perverted
[1:19:05] us sure we get new
[1:19:09] desires sure we want to go to church at
[1:19:12] sanctification Church you're looking at
[1:19:14] somebody that can witness to you for
[1:19:17] hours and telling you about what God
[1:19:20] done back there
[1:19:22] right I was a deacon at 23 years years
[1:19:26] old you know they had to think a lot of
[1:19:29] me cuz they seen my
[1:19:33] life they seen what I stood for and it
[1:19:36] wouldn't I stood for the Baptist
[1:19:37] Doctrine but I argued with them about
[1:19:42] it I told him the Bible said he that
[1:19:45] believeth I could
[1:19:48] read I never did believe you got the
[1:19:50] Holy Ghost when you believe that's right
[1:19:55] he said believeth in his baptized shall
[1:19:57] be saved means Keep On Believing right
[1:20:02] but see sanctification just cleanses The
[1:20:05] Vessel but the vessel's still
[1:20:08] there it's you now God has to come in
[1:20:12] and burn out what's left of you and
[1:20:15] I right amen and what if we don't yield
[1:20:18] it to him can he burn it
[1:20:22] out but brother Dale always stop getting
[1:20:25] the Holy Ghost just go to the Altar and
[1:20:26] pray for it jump up and grab it and run
[1:20:28] out yeah you go back and what are
[1:20:32] you now come on we've been around long
[1:20:34] enough a lot of you have been around
[1:20:35] long enough to see them in this message
[1:20:37] it claimed it and claimed it preachers
[1:20:40] and where are they now
[1:20:44] right I'm not already getting fussing
[1:20:46] with nobody I'm just telling it like it
[1:20:49] is you know yourself this is the biggest
[1:20:53] garbage cans of preachers has ever been
[1:20:55] ain't never been a Baptist Church that
[1:20:57] had the garbage can these preachers this
[1:20:58] message has got amen you got that right
[1:21:01] amen and then claim to still be saved at
[1:21:05] least in the Baptist you went out and
[1:21:06] done something wrong you did fall off
[1:21:08] and
[1:21:12] quit
[1:21:14] right now everybody but God don't God
[1:21:18] don't condemn me cuz I'm his son
[1:21:22] yeah but listen
[1:21:25] it says in the Bible the baptism of the
[1:21:27] Holy Ghost and Fire excuse me let me let
[1:21:31] put it correct says the baptism of the
[1:21:32] fire and the Holy Ghost
[1:21:34] right cu the fire comes to burn
[1:21:37] out what's
[1:21:40] left cleanse us put us to the place that
[1:21:44] God can come and live in right and give
[1:21:46] us the new
[1:21:48] birth now we jump over to Ezekiel
[1:21:55] yeah now we get over to where we are on
[1:21:59] Ezekiel and I just gave a few
[1:22:02] quotes for us to to read from because I
[1:22:06] didn't have that much time to bring a
[1:22:07] lot what I wanted to but it says a new
[1:22:10] heart verse 25 26
[1:22:14] right a new heart will I also will I
[1:22:18] give you and a new
[1:22:21] spirit and I will put
[1:22:25] a new spirit will I put in you and then
[1:22:26] you go on down to the next verse and he
[1:22:28] said I'll put my spirit in you okay now
[1:22:31] I don't remember where I've got the
[1:22:33] right one or correctly but brother
[1:22:34] brandom says see there are three
[1:22:41] things he said one is a new heart right
[1:22:45] one is a new
[1:22:46] spirit and one of them is my spirit
[1:22:49] coming three things all
[1:22:53] right now see that's what's going to
[1:22:55] take
[1:22:57] place I give you a new
[1:22:59] heart now the Bible says he would take
[1:23:02] away what our Stony heart right and give
[1:23:07] us a heart of Flesh
[1:23:10] right see if you don't become condemned
[1:23:13] about your life of what you was then
[1:23:16] don't talk about
[1:23:18] salvation amen because in the Bible
[1:23:21] everybody always you know said what can
[1:23:24] I do to be saved in other words I'm a
[1:23:27] sinner something needs to happen so what
[1:23:30] does the preaching of the Gospel do it
[1:23:33] makes you realize you were born wrong of
[1:23:36] course that's why I'm against it that's
[1:23:38] why the people in this message you know
[1:23:39] they always was eternals and all this
[1:23:41] thing they never preach salvation to the
[1:23:43] people so how can the people get saved
[1:23:50] right now go
[1:23:52] ahead that's what you believe go ahead
[1:23:55] but I just still old fashion enough to
[1:23:57] just believe in that you must be
[1:23:58] justified Sanctified and filled with the
[1:24:01] Holy Ghost and have the new
[1:24:03] birth I never believed that this age now
[1:24:07] this going to be funny but it don't mean
[1:24:09] to be but wouldn't it be nice sisters
[1:24:13] for you to never have to go through in
[1:24:15] the birth of a baby you just go to the
[1:24:17] hospital and pick it up and bring it
[1:24:22] home that's what you're
[1:24:26] now I thought we believe that the
[1:24:28] natural type to spiritual right amen the
[1:24:31] justification water sanctification blood
[1:24:35] and the baby getting life you know
[1:24:37] coming with the baby I thought we
[1:24:38] believe that well now what how many of
[1:24:41] you went to the hospital picked up your
[1:24:43] baby you never went through
[1:24:47] nothing there you was one day you look
[1:24:49] like an old pregnant chaos cuz you never
[1:24:52] Rachel's W to be no farmer
[1:24:56] but you can have a cow that can have a
[1:24:58] false pregnancy brother Thomas am I
[1:25:00] right she looks this exactly like she's
[1:25:03] fixing the havat she's as fat as mud she
[1:25:06] is beautiful looking wobbling around
[1:25:09] just like every other pragnant cow but
[1:25:11] then one day I don't know what happens
[1:25:14] to her where the air goes out of her or
[1:25:16] what happens I don't know ain't none of
[1:25:18] my business I ain't a cow but all at
[1:25:21] once she's as skinny as rail
[1:25:24] why cuz it was a f what they call a
[1:25:26] false pregnancy but wouldn't that be
[1:25:28] something for all you sisters you know
[1:25:29] to go through the N9 months then you get
[1:25:31] rid fat you don't even you go up to the
[1:25:33] doctor and doctor I'm ready and he said
[1:25:34] okay here take your baby
[1:25:38] home no no no no no no now I'm just
[1:25:43] sorry I'm just I know that's arrogant
[1:25:45] and hateful and carnal but I just still
[1:25:47] believe
[1:25:48] it and I still believe to be born
[1:25:52] again that youve got to come to a place
[1:25:55] of realization that you're lost that's
[1:25:57] right brother dick telling me that so
[1:25:59] somebody there in the Presbyterian said
[1:26:00] well they didn't know they lost cuz he
[1:26:01] born in the church something like that
[1:26:03] me and him talking about one time so I
[1:26:05] was just born in the church or something
[1:26:07] yeah preacher wife or something yeah
[1:26:10] well she was a preacher's daughter
[1:26:11] preacher's daughter and she just well I
[1:26:13] saved all the time I never didn't know I
[1:26:15] was lost here well that's the way people
[1:26:18] are if you don't know you're
[1:26:21] lost y you don't know what's going on I
[1:26:26] never been lost but one
[1:26:27] time right and I I was concerned that
[1:26:32] time I wasn't concerned about myself I
[1:26:34] was concerned about somebody else but
[1:26:36] still I was lost one
[1:26:38] time I'm I'm I'm not a but I'm a
[1:26:41] Woodsman in the bases that I can walk in
[1:26:43] the woods and come back out I may come
[1:26:44] out three miles down the road but I'm
[1:26:46] going to get back out of there cuz
[1:26:48] that's what I talk to kids follow the
[1:26:49] branches follow the sound follow the
[1:26:51] doing but one time I was concerned
[1:26:54] but see if you've never been lost you
[1:26:56] don't know what it is to be saved right
[1:26:57] amen that's
[1:27:00] right you never realize you're lost you
[1:27:02] don't know what to be saved so that's
[1:27:03] what it means I give you a new
[1:27:08] heart I take away your Stony
[1:27:12] heart and give your heart of Flesh in
[1:27:15] other words make you the word that you
[1:27:17] will listen to God and hear the
[1:27:21] message and you know how that is you
[1:27:23] come to church and you sat down if you
[1:27:25] remember your experience you know you
[1:27:27] may have been to church alone your life
[1:27:29] whatever but then one day something just
[1:27:30] begin to deal with you you begin sitting
[1:27:33] there and you thought well I'm
[1:27:35] lost you know of course the way it is
[1:27:38] now everybody you know is always saved
[1:27:40] so they don't want to preach each other
[1:27:43] way but you just say but I'm
[1:27:46] lost I need to go to the
[1:27:49] Altar and you know the difference
[1:27:51] between the fact of you being condemned
[1:27:53] in your heart to go to the Altar and
[1:27:55] somebody coming down there trying to get
[1:27:57] you out of the Pew and take you to the
[1:27:59] altar my brother R said don't do that
[1:28:02] right he said you'll make them harder to
[1:28:05] get saved than it ever was right cuz
[1:28:07] you'll start dealing with them you know
[1:28:08] you need to be saved cuz your mama saved
[1:28:10] you Daddy Sav you want to go to heaven
[1:28:11] don't you where they're at you know see
[1:28:13] and that ain't doing nothing that's just
[1:28:15] condemning you and the bases that that's
[1:28:17] making you harder but when something
[1:28:19] actually comes over you that's right
[1:28:22] amen that you realize
[1:28:24] right I'm
[1:28:26] lost just don't wait until like the lady
[1:28:29] was that was a Sunday school teacher and
[1:28:30] everything you know but she wound up her
[1:28:32] last hours there and you remember the
[1:28:34] story of the Prophet tell
[1:28:36] you and she was screamed out she said
[1:28:38] I'm lost he said her real Soul came up
[1:28:40] before her amen he said she realized she
[1:28:43] was lost and said they shot her with a h
[1:28:45] hypo needle in other words kept giving
[1:28:46] her shots to put her out of it why
[1:28:49] because she was condemning them right
[1:28:52] right see that's right
[1:28:55] but you know what happened if you don't
[1:28:56] know what happened then I would pray for
[1:28:59] someday that God will deal with
[1:29:02] you but also remember the story The
[1:29:04] Prophet said when he he called out a
[1:29:06] girl one
[1:29:10] day and told her she needed to get right
[1:29:13] she said from the day You' done that she
[1:29:16] said I went down she said I could see my
[1:29:18] mother's Soul frying hell and life at it
[1:29:22] said here preacher you want something to
[1:29:23] drink you want something
[1:29:25] smoke see because she turned it down
[1:29:30] right right but you know what it is see
[1:29:34] people get under condemnation and then
[1:29:36] they'll go talk to the pastor well you
[1:29:39] believe the message don't you and don't
[1:29:41] come into my office and feel in
[1:29:43] condemnation and expect me to tell you
[1:29:45] you're all right
[1:29:47] right I'm not going to do it I'm going
[1:29:50] to tell you to deal with God about
[1:29:53] it you feel condemned you go deal with
[1:29:55] God about it because I not I don't have
[1:29:57] no quick fix to make you no Christian
[1:30:00] right you don't have to go two years
[1:30:02] like I did no that was my
[1:30:06] problem cuz you see I've seen through
[1:30:08] much of
[1:30:12] religion until when I come in this
[1:30:14] message that's all I seen was religion
[1:30:17] and a higher form than what we had as
[1:30:22] Baptist but thank God for the word that
[1:30:24] I
[1:30:25] heard and I knew the man then wasn't
[1:30:29] religion you know what I'm talking about
[1:30:31] I remember I know brother brandom I
[1:30:32] remember when hearing that even my wife
[1:30:34] said one day she said there's one thing
[1:30:35] about it if he done the things he said
[1:30:38] on that tape right there he had to be a
[1:30:40] prophet see that's coming to realization
[1:30:43] of Truth looking right it just blunt
[1:30:45] look at it straight I'm
[1:30:48] lost I need a savior right see then you
[1:30:53] repent
[1:30:56] right repentance to say God I'm
[1:31:00] sorry right I'm sorry Lord forgive
[1:31:04] me but you know it's hard for people to
[1:31:07] do today that rather by you in you
[1:31:08] Cadillac and say I'm sorry you know
[1:31:11] that's
[1:31:12] true instead of just saying I'm
[1:31:15] sorry because this is not the age of
[1:31:17] saying I'm sorry this is the ede I'm
[1:31:19] saying I'm
[1:31:21] okay but see then what happens
[1:31:24] I give you a new heart I give you a
[1:31:27] melon mellow how you say it mellow I
[1:31:31] mellow you down I'll bring you off of
[1:31:33] your high house I bring you down to a
[1:31:36] position to
[1:31:37] realize and if you don't realize that
[1:31:40] you're lost you'll never be saved right
[1:31:42] I don't care what you talk about that's
[1:31:45] it I don't care what you claim if you
[1:31:47] believe the prophet you believe him you
[1:31:49] as children what you are you that don't
[1:31:51] make no
[1:31:52] difference you got to have your own
[1:31:54] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:56] Ghost just cuz Mom and Daddy had it
[1:31:58] doesn't mean you got it he said I give
[1:32:00] you a new heart right he said I give you
[1:32:03] a new spirit now I gave you the quotes
[1:32:05] there and they're on the internet and
[1:32:06] there's plenty of them just run it in
[1:32:07] new heart new spirit on your computer
[1:32:10] brother ran says he gave us a new spirit
[1:32:13] he said now that is where the
[1:32:14] Pentecostal was messed
[1:32:17] up he said cuz they thought when they
[1:32:19] got that new spirit that was it
[1:32:24] do you love God y you want to go to
[1:32:27] church you become happy things going on
[1:32:31] you know a new spirit he said but that's
[1:32:34] not the Holy
[1:32:36] Spirit he said that's just a new spirit
[1:32:39] he said because you couldn't stand your
[1:32:40] own self with your old Spirit now as I
[1:32:43] said a moment
[1:32:44] ago I don't believe that means no more
[1:32:47] than I give you I take away your Stony
[1:32:50] heart well you know there's no such
[1:32:53] thing as a stone on your heart if it is
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:57] dead
[1:32:59] okay there's no such thing so that just
[1:33:03] is showing you what's the
[1:33:05] situation they give you a heart of Flesh
[1:33:07] in other words it's melling you down
[1:33:09] softening you up that's what God is
[1:33:12] doing he shows us things he heals us and
[1:33:15] delivers us and helps us you know amen
[1:33:18] maybe you're fixing to have a wreck and
[1:33:19] you see it looks like something just
[1:33:21] supernaturally happened to you and then
[1:33:23] you just come out of you
[1:33:25] someone how did that ever
[1:33:28] happen maybe the Lord's trying to talk
[1:33:30] to
[1:33:32] me that's what it means to get a new
[1:33:34] heart right now when it said get a new
[1:33:37] spirit is not take your spirit out put
[1:33:40] another spirit
[1:33:41] in
[1:33:43] right it's to work upon that
[1:33:49] spirit and as I said this morning now
[1:33:52] even the quotes will sound like it but
[1:33:54] remember when you're dealing with a new
[1:33:57] heart and a new spirit and the Holy
[1:33:59] Spirit in you that's in the soul that is
[1:34:02] not in your body or in your spirit
[1:34:04] that's righten you don't get a new
[1:34:06] spirit to take out your old Spirit of
[1:34:08] memory reason conscience affections
[1:34:10] throw it all away and then you you got
[1:34:13] to start thinking over again no
[1:34:17] now just starts working on you right and
[1:34:21] he's working on you in your soul
[1:34:24] right but now words listen if he's
[1:34:27] working on you and your soul what was we
[1:34:29] talking about this
[1:34:30] morning then the Soul will dictate back
[1:34:32] out to the spirit of the Body Spirit
[1:34:35] right through the
[1:34:36] body it'll show there's a new spirit
[1:34:38] come in that Soul a new spirit on what
[1:34:42] not a new spirit coming in to live but a
[1:34:44] cleansing up a washing a set a side cuz
[1:34:48] Ezekiel doesn't cover justification
[1:34:51] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:53] Ghost
[1:34:56] you read what your Prophet is he's not
[1:34:57] talking that way he's talking about the
[1:34:59] Stony heart meling you up he's talking
[1:35:02] about the new spirit being the old
[1:35:03] Spirit you can't stand yourself with he
[1:35:05] said then put my spirit in you he's not
[1:35:08] even I've looking through all this he's
[1:35:10] not talking about sanctification and
[1:35:13] time now the future home is explaining
[1:35:17] it so get what I'm saying the new birth
[1:35:20] takes place in your soul when you get a
[1:35:23] new spirit is in the soul it's not a new
[1:35:26] spirit coming into the soul it's a
[1:35:28] washing or cleansing amen that's right
[1:35:31] of the
[1:35:33] Soul it's not a you memory reason
[1:35:36] conscience and affection that's right
[1:35:38] it's in the soul where the new birth
[1:35:40] takes
[1:35:41] place everybody understand what I'm
[1:35:44] saying whether you believe it or
[1:35:46] not the new birth takes place in your
[1:35:48] soul not your body and your spirit am so
[1:35:50] when he said I give you a new heart
[1:35:52] that's not taking out your thum gizard
[1:35:54] you put your Mello one in there right
[1:35:56] that's in the
[1:35:57] soul cuz that's the heart of man it's
[1:36:00] the soul of man
[1:36:02] right and to give it a new spirit is not
[1:36:05] to put you another spirit in place of
[1:36:07] your old memory reason conscience right
[1:36:09] that's the
[1:36:10] problem right we still got that right we
[1:36:14] got to deal with that after the New
[1:36:16] Birth the new birth don't convert your
[1:36:19] natural Spirit
[1:36:22] right it don't birth your body
[1:36:26] right the only place that you birth that
[1:36:29] is in the soul amen and from that soul
[1:36:32] is where the new spirit will
[1:36:35] come new desires Prophet said what does
[1:36:38] he mean new spirit he said new desires
[1:36:42] am why because you'll start wanting to
[1:36:44] be motivated towards God
[1:36:47] right y a cleansing process is working
[1:36:50] within you justification and
[1:36:51] sanctification is working in the soul
[1:36:54] all right and see then when it does he
[1:36:58] said I put my spirit in you said th's
[1:37:01] the Holy Spirit he said but that's where
[1:37:03] you Pentecostals is that he said you get
[1:37:05] a new spirit he said I got
[1:37:07] it you get new desires you think you're
[1:37:10] saved
[1:37:14] right now I'm not going to ask you to
[1:37:17] answer this question only in your own
[1:37:20] conscience is there one person in here
[1:37:24] and you're looking at one that's going
[1:37:26] to tell you that didn't happen to me is
[1:37:28] there one person in here that can say
[1:37:33] well I just jumped up and grabbed the
[1:37:35] Holy Ghost it don't matter what these
[1:37:37] other things is taking
[1:37:41] place I just believed
[1:37:44] it I just believed every been right
[1:37:46] there once it just happened to me all
[1:37:49] that one time well if it did you still
[1:37:50] had to go through them process amen
[1:37:53] right you cannot have the new birth
[1:37:55] today without having justification
[1:37:58] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:38:00] Holy Ghost amen that's right
[1:38:03] amen and you can't have it without
[1:38:05] justification chopping off you P sins
[1:38:08] sanctification dealing with your
[1:38:10] nature y but that's in the soul see
[1:38:14] we're trying to convert people in these
[1:38:16] body and spirit right that's what I'm
[1:38:19] trying to get to you if your new birth
[1:38:21] is not
[1:38:22] there right
[1:38:26] the day I got born again it didn't make
[1:38:28] me so worri I didn't remember what I
[1:38:30] used to do did it
[1:38:32] you when you got born again that's what
[1:38:35] I was asking did did it cleanse you so
[1:38:37] much day you got born again you just
[1:38:39] don't never have no more wrong thoughts
[1:38:41] and you don't ever remember what you
[1:38:42] used to do cuz remember that's in memory
[1:38:45] reason
[1:38:47] consciously right amen well I ain't
[1:38:50] never had a dirty thought since I got
[1:38:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:56] I'm
[1:38:57] like believe it was Jack Cole told that
[1:38:59] lady when she come up there and she said
[1:39:02] said Mr Cole said I want to lay my
[1:39:04] tongue on the
[1:39:05] altar he said said I just gossip and
[1:39:08] everything said I want to lay my tongue
[1:39:10] out here alar he said ma'am this P this
[1:39:14] alar is only 14 ft said there ain't
[1:39:17] enough
[1:39:20] room one come to him something one time
[1:39:22] that's why they didn't like once come to
[1:39:24] him one time brother T him he had a lot
[1:39:25] of f on and told him said you know said
[1:39:28] I got the Holy Ghost I ain't lied or
[1:39:30] done nothing he said the biggest liar
[1:39:31] here go shut
[1:39:33] down he didn't mind just bluntly saying
[1:39:35] it you're the biggest liar here just go
[1:39:37] sh
[1:39:40] down so you can't preach like you used
[1:39:43] to you know you offend people too much
[1:39:48] but
[1:39:50] listen since you're born again if you
[1:39:52] ever had wrong thought
[1:39:53] amen that's right can you think about
[1:39:56] what you used to do
[1:39:59] right my problem is I can't keep from
[1:40:01] thinking about what I used to
[1:40:04] do right
[1:40:07] right I mean I don't something wrong I
[1:40:09] ride by there I can still remember where
[1:40:11] it was at can't
[1:40:15] you well I thought maybe Christianity
[1:40:18] was a little
[1:40:19] different to the world it is but this is
[1:40:23] like brother rown said he said there's
[1:40:26] no such thing in the Bible where it
[1:40:27] promises you prosperity and things to be
[1:40:29] a Christian he said it promise you
[1:40:31] spiritual Prosperity but not natural
[1:40:36] right see but we're Tau come to the
[1:40:39] church and you'll have this you'll have
[1:40:41] that now you ain't never heard it around
[1:40:42] here right no I saying there this
[1:40:45] morning people thinks you know we just
[1:40:47] take one more step and everything going
[1:40:48] to get better and everything going to
[1:40:49] get better the econom is going to get
[1:40:51] better this going to be well when we go
[1:40:52] out here we're going to be living in a
[1:40:54] Utopia we go out here in a Rapture we'll
[1:40:56] probably be living in one of them
[1:40:58] concentration camps up in Alaska amen
[1:41:00] that's all right that your Prophet spoke
[1:41:05] of you said well you sure don't have
[1:41:07] much Faith well it's one thing about it
[1:41:10] I'm still preaching on it amen you know
[1:41:12] I'll preach it till we get it but see a
[1:41:14] new heart take away the Stony
[1:41:18] heart that's in your soul the stoniness
[1:41:21] of you the hardness of you M you
[1:41:24] down enough to worry that you'll want to
[1:41:29] repent you don't mow it down you can't
[1:41:31] repent cuz you don't you're too hard
[1:41:34] that's right then you repent you say
[1:41:37] Lord I'm sorry and he just chops off in
[1:41:39] P sins but just remember brother run
[1:41:41] said it didn't do nothing to the Future
[1:41:43] right
[1:41:45] right right amen he said only the past
[1:41:49] that's
[1:41:50] right there's no such thing as praying
[1:41:52] for the fure future
[1:41:54] sins that's Catholicism that's right
[1:41:58] where they allowed the people to come up
[1:41:59] and give the money and they it and told
[1:42:01] them to go ahead and kill
[1:42:03] people cuz they forgive it before they
[1:42:05] done it you can't do it that's not in
[1:42:06] the Bible God does not
[1:42:09] require you to repent of what you're
[1:42:11] going to do right wait till it's
[1:42:15] done right we might order repent for the
[1:42:17] fact of even thinking about we could get
[1:42:19] by with
[1:42:20] it but what does it say a new and a new
[1:42:25] spirit what he said a new desire I want
[1:42:28] to do right now I know I'm a
[1:42:32] Christian I'll smoke one more than I'll
[1:42:35] throw it
[1:42:36] away now I'm reading right here off the
[1:42:38] page that's on the first one that turned
[1:42:41] over to on impersonation of Christianity
[1:42:43] 7
[1:42:45] 120 why the spirit you had you couldn't
[1:42:48] even get along with yourself how you
[1:42:50] going to get along with God God had to
[1:42:52] give you a new heart not patch up one a
[1:42:54] new heart that's your intelligence that
[1:42:57] you think with a new way of
[1:43:01] thinking now
[1:43:03] listen I don't care if you can quote all
[1:43:06] day long memory reason conscious spirit
[1:43:08] Spirit real your soul is what makes that
[1:43:14] work
[1:43:16] okay that's why I deal with the soul I'm
[1:43:19] preaching to Soul I ain't preaching to
[1:43:20] bodies and spirits
[1:43:23] I'm preaching to
[1:43:26] souls because it's a soul that's
[1:43:31] iner what he
[1:43:33] said I just going on down in that now I
[1:43:37] know I'm a
[1:43:38] Christian I'll smoke one more then I'll
[1:43:40] throw it away see I'll just stay home
[1:43:42] tonight and you know I'll just all these
[1:43:45] little
[1:43:46] just Eve stopped for a moment that's all
[1:43:50] she had to do right
[1:43:53] new heart new
[1:43:59] spirit after you get a new heart and in
[1:44:01] new spirit you need God's spirit within
[1:44:04] you amen after
[1:44:06] then that that heart has been made
[1:44:09] mellow enough to
[1:44:11] repent and then God can use the word to
[1:44:14] drive that unclean Spirit out of you
[1:44:16] that's
[1:44:19] right you ever heard this statement I
[1:44:22] tell you what it might not be a good
[1:44:24] thing but for me to bust somebody gets
[1:44:26] boy it helps my spirit that's what it
[1:44:29] does it helps that old
[1:44:31] human
[1:44:32] well like I told a man at work down
[1:44:35] there one day he hit his hand or
[1:44:36] something he let out some word I said
[1:44:37] why didn't you say Thank you Lord I
[1:44:38] didn't M the thing
[1:44:42] off what good is all them words well it
[1:44:45] half my nature half my old Spirit we're
[1:44:48] getting rid of the old spirit amen
[1:44:51] amen say thank thank you Lord
[1:44:58] yes but he calls going down in that same
[1:45:01] message he talks about the new spirit
[1:45:02] sits in the center of the new
[1:45:05] heart you read these and you get home
[1:45:08] new spirit sets in the center of that
[1:45:09] new
[1:45:11] heart he said then he puts his spirit in
[1:45:13] there which is the m spring he calls
[1:45:17] it remember what we were saying the soul
[1:45:20] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[1:45:22] the body
[1:45:23] the main
[1:45:25] spring the thing that's controlling
[1:45:29] us then there's no problems with all
[1:45:31] these other things they become
[1:45:32] automatically in the
[1:45:35] process no I didn't have to quit
[1:45:38] anything to become a Christian that's
[1:45:39] what everybody preaches you got to quit
[1:45:41] this you got to quit that to become a
[1:45:42] Christian and I know exactly what's in
[1:45:44] your mind I talk to you and I listen to
[1:45:45] you if I could get good enough I'm just
[1:45:47] not good
[1:45:50] enough you're going to die and go to
[1:45:52] hell that way cuz you'll never be good
[1:45:53] enough right quick as you get rid of one
[1:45:55] thing Satan brings up another one right
[1:45:57] don't ever think that like I've always
[1:45:59] told you you say well I just don't feel
[1:46:00] like going to church
[1:46:02] today the devil says that's
[1:46:04] right that's right you go all the time
[1:46:07] you're a good dedicated person you go
[1:46:09] all the time you just stay out there cuz
[1:46:10] you don't feel like it he's on your side
[1:46:13] 100% ain't he until you look at the
[1:46:16] clock and you say they started the
[1:46:17] service at 10:00 and I'm not there and
[1:46:19] the devil says ha
[1:46:21] haa you proved you wouldn't a Christian
[1:46:24] you'd have went now he's not on your
[1:46:27] side he's condemning you right and he
[1:46:31] has a right to do it cuz he conquered
[1:46:33] you right that's right but you see when
[1:46:37] God puts his Spirit within
[1:46:40] us now comes into view the
[1:46:43] scriptures that you can't wait for the
[1:46:45] doors to open
[1:46:48] right right that's right amen you can't
[1:46:51] wait till the doors open what your the
[1:46:53] Bible says and your Prophet says it but
[1:46:56] see what do we
[1:46:58] do well if I could find a pretty good
[1:47:01] excuse you know like the old guy sitting
[1:47:03] down on two guys sitting down on the
[1:47:05] river you know and one of them said to
[1:47:06] the other one said boy I can hear that
[1:47:08] church bell ringing nor went to church
[1:47:10] the other one said
[1:47:11] yeah said I couldn't go anyway said my
[1:47:14] wife's
[1:47:18] sick okay pretty well fits to bill on it
[1:47:23] joke fit the bill yeah that's right see
[1:47:27] he said I put my spirit in
[1:47:29] you there's that part I was talking
[1:47:31] about where that he begins to work on
[1:47:33] that
[1:47:35] Soul because when you get that now I've
[1:47:37] got them on past this in the next
[1:47:39] message Wednesday cuz when you get the
[1:47:41] new
[1:47:42] birth you only get the earnest that's
[1:47:46] right of your inheritance that's right
[1:47:48] amen true brother R said your soul is
[1:47:51] not complete yet he only got the
[1:47:56] earnest so you get that new spirit
[1:47:58] placed within
[1:48:00] you and it's going to start working on
[1:48:03] us y see that's what Ezekiel was talking
[1:48:06] about that's what the Israel was going
[1:48:08] to go through you know what Israel is
[1:48:10] going to be one of these days now let's
[1:48:12] just say this for a minute we qu you see
[1:48:14] one of these days there 144,000 going to
[1:48:16] be called out right that's right amen
[1:48:19] they're going to get the new birth it
[1:48:20] will not put them in the body of Christ
[1:48:23] right I don't believe that right amen it
[1:48:25] won't put them in the body of Christ cuz
[1:48:28] the body of Christ done gone up the
[1:48:29] Rapture right but it'll be a new birth
[1:48:32] to them and I believe they'll have to go
[1:48:34] through a new heart a new spirit because
[1:48:37] that's what he says right they're going
[1:48:40] to go through what you go
[1:48:42] through right but they cannot be in the
[1:48:44] body of Christ right everybody
[1:48:47] understand that because they rejected it
[1:48:50] and it's not going to put them a second
[1:48:51] bride
[1:48:53] right you know we don't believe in stuff
[1:48:55] like that it only got one body one bride
[1:48:58] polygamy is going to be done away with
[1:48:59] one of these days you know it's going to
[1:49:02] be back to one Christ and one body all
[1:49:04] right so you don't have two all right so
[1:49:07] that 144,000 they're going to realize
[1:49:09] that they're lost they're going to
[1:49:12] realize they missed it and they're going
[1:49:14] to go through the stages that you and I
[1:49:16] have to go through to find a place right
[1:49:18] and when they do there's going to be a
[1:49:20] new spirit plac within them
[1:49:23] and that'll be the Holy Spirit and you
[1:49:25] know what they'll do then the Bible says
[1:49:28] they separate apart and
[1:49:32] cry that don't shout Glory Hallelujah I
[1:49:34] had it all the
[1:49:37] time they cry and they
[1:49:40] pray because they realized one thing
[1:49:43] that they've missed it right that they
[1:49:45] will not be the bride that's done
[1:49:48] gone but they'll
[1:49:51] realize that they're not like the rest
[1:49:53] of
[1:49:54] Israel that they're
[1:49:57] saved and that they will be in the
[1:49:59] millennial Reign the prophet said but
[1:50:02] they'll be servants to the
[1:50:04] bride you know that's not a degrade they
[1:50:07] won't be degraded and
[1:50:09] downrod my point is what's going to
[1:50:11] happen to Israel should be what's
[1:50:14] happening to you and I right
[1:50:16] amen we should be the happiest people in
[1:50:19] the world to think about that we're
[1:50:20] saved that's right that God God has
[1:50:23] given us all of this and brought it to
[1:50:24] us here in the end time and showed us
[1:50:26] all of the word amen made us his
[1:50:31] offspring but we've went through these
[1:50:34] processes come out of it with the
[1:50:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see then
[1:50:38] you can only start the growth
[1:50:40] development from the time that the baby
[1:50:41] come into the world right you know the
[1:50:44] baby in the wound it grows right but
[1:50:46] still up to a part and it stops you know
[1:50:49] see then it's got to come out and it's
[1:50:50] got to start drinking milk and and then
[1:50:52] it's start got to eating potatoes and
[1:50:53] it's got to it's got to start growing
[1:50:56] and the nourishment that it needs for
[1:50:57] each stage you can't keep giving it milk
[1:51:01] right right amen you stunt to growth you
[1:51:06] got to feed it so is God done with a
[1:51:08] stature of perfect man to feed the bride
[1:51:09] in the end time do you
[1:51:13] understand then I believe as I said to
[1:51:15] start
[1:51:17] with that ever born again
[1:51:20] believer now I know this is coming out
[1:51:22] in is coming out odd to what people's
[1:51:24] going to think because of what the
[1:51:25] statement I make but I believe every
[1:51:27] Born Again believer if we'll just yield
[1:51:29] to that Holy Spirit within us we are not
[1:51:32] more than we are more than a match for
[1:51:34] the devil amen cuz greater is he that is
[1:51:37] in you than he that is in the world now
[1:51:40] we're not going to go out and say Satan
[1:51:43] I challenge
[1:51:47] you don't think that you're going to
[1:51:50] challenge him if you think you are you
[1:51:53] already got him in you cuz he's the only
[1:51:57] one that wants to
[1:52:00] challenge God don't challenge he accepts
[1:52:03] the
[1:52:06] challenge greater is he that is in you
[1:52:08] and he this in the world ever born again
[1:52:11] believer then by the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:13] Ghost can tell Satan say get out of
[1:52:17] here you know what you have to do you
[1:52:19] have to
[1:52:20] listen you know what you have to do
[1:52:22] let's get out of here long as you keep
[1:52:24] telling
[1:52:25] him just keep telling him see why
[1:52:28] because it's not
[1:52:31] you it's not you I'm not talking about
[1:52:34] you being a match for the devil I'm
[1:52:35] talking about the Holy Ghost is in
[1:52:38] you you understand the Holy Ghost in you
[1:52:40] is the more than a match for the
[1:52:42] devil but what do we fight with well
[1:52:46] Satan I tell you what now Jesus Took the
[1:52:49] word amen and said it is written
[1:52:55] what do we take right it is written
[1:52:58] brother R said if you can find anything
[1:53:00] in here that God said you can call him
[1:53:04] on the scene now this is a direct quote
[1:53:06] he said if he don't do it you can call
[1:53:08] him a liar I first read that I thought
[1:53:11] man oh man this guy really has a
[1:53:15] connection somewhere or he just he just
[1:53:17] goofing up one I mean that's what I
[1:53:20] thought I'm honest
[1:53:22] but then I begin to realize what he's
[1:53:24] talking
[1:53:25] about greater is he that's in you
[1:53:29] amen when that indwelling of the Holy
[1:53:31] Spirit comes
[1:53:34] in it
[1:53:36] converts our soul now
[1:53:39] listen see I don't mind all these quotes
[1:53:41] I love them it converts our soul to a
[1:53:44] new
[1:53:48] nature now after all of that you'd say
[1:53:51] well what do you mean you just you you
[1:53:52] look like you're going back and talking
[1:53:53] about this some your nature no the
[1:53:57] nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:53:58] born again right it's been converted to
[1:54:00] a new
[1:54:02] nature all I want is just more of
[1:54:06] him come on boys let's Stand Together
[1:54:10] come on musicians where's the song
