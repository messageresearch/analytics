TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right let's uh let's go ahead and turn to Second Peter one oh I took yours I'm sorry yeah yeah they videoed the funeral online did you find it oh there is one underneath the seat in front of me that has your name on it that's not it oh that's not normal but did you get that one uh okay I'll read along with the rest okay brother Tracy left some conversionary today are they huge fans all right second Peter's chapter one just go ahead and get started now we're wavy I got it change no change the color first the time it's like 10 minutes yeah so you're gonna pop up every 10 minutes okay that is so annoying there you go thank you okay all right look at Peter chapter one I think today we'll just continue just maybe one more um Sunday school class on making sure our life is correct making sure everything we're doing is right if we're not born again at least we're working towards something and if we are born again then we're really looking towards something okay amen all right so even if you're not or if you are we're still working I want us to be aware of the fact that you're one of the others you're not in between you're one of the other you're either working toward being born again are you being born again up to Statue of a perfect man already born again in the body of Christ all right so you're one of the two right so we want to we want and it's not bad being one of the other it's just bad not knowing whether you're one of the other all right being deceived or being like we were talking about being anti-word all right for being anti-word that makes us against the word of God right and we know that we are against the word of God and this natural life because something is bringing us together because I said the statue of a perfect man not the statue of a perfect theophany but if you're born again you have a perfectly often so this is the statue of perfect man this is bringing everything together fitly joint the Bible says bringing everything together all the all the joints and all the fingers working right and you know these little fingers are are pretty insignificant sometimes but you need them like dad's always said about fingernails fingernails are not so you know you just kind of do with them but boy when you need to be scratched or if somebody pulls one off or if you cut one down in the quick you sure know that that thing's there so that's the thing we want to do when the body of Christ if we know that there's a place in our body that that needs work you know what God's gonna do he's going to say hey that part's important that's right he's gonna say hey this part's important he's going to bring it up to you and say this is important or this is important or this is important okay so second Peter chapter one I've been reading this book we're going to read it again because I want the emphasis to be what brother random we're going to read this quote here after we're finished Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained there's an entrance they have you have obtained something all right like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace of peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things so he's giving us divine power according to his divine power he's going to give us divine power have given unto us all things that pertaining to life and godliness all right so you see that word life and godliness now if Peter's already born again he's not talking about the life of God so much that's a dual meaning there you see where he separated he said life and godliness well your life in this world is not godliness okay that's right so he's separating the two he's saying okay this is going to be that pertain learn to life everyday living just like what we're talking about making the world a better place it's not just feeling good or a good thinking you know you have to feel good about yourself that's true how many times like talking about sister Johnny and uh being making you know I just realized when I walked through something and like in the car lot out there somebody they throw stuff on the ground all the time while I go by and pick it up I feel bad if I walk back and see it sitting there and have to go do something and forget about it and go back because I want it I want it better I don't care if it's perfect but I want it better I want it better than I left that's why when we go to places when we go to functions and when we go to places that out in the world when you go to a restaurant when you go to places like that I've seen people in the message and sorry but they've had a bunch of kids and they don't pay no attention to them and it's just stuff all over the floor looks like the foods exploded in the floor now I don't agree with that I don't agree with that at all I just don't think that's a lot of got a lot of godliness to it right all right now we're talking about life you should clean up your mess I'm sorry you say oh it's a little bit that person is going to walk in and clean up and say this was a sorry person so see there you got the connection but that's why we leave things better when we go camping up in the mountains I tell them the last morning on Saturday we send them out on an Excursion we even clean up what's not even ours we cleaned up so far out where there's no question of what we left behind we might leave wood but we stacked the wood up against a tree we leave the fire pit where somebody else can use it we leave the things you say well that's just yeah that's just being good because you know what if you're a Christian and being good that puts you closer to being Godly that's right some of these people are just going to be good out in the world but see Peter says life and godliness he he separates them but then he puts them back together life and godliness he's talking about life and the godliness with living that life all right because we're the only one that can live a Godly life right through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given those are gifts unto a succeeding great impression promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all right excuse me and besides this giving all diligence foreign virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance patience into patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity if you'll notice as looking at this in in terms of English look where it says right here add to temperance patience patience regardless there's no comma there a comma is a pause right to bring a little more of a thought there's not even a common layer so you're adding to what I'm saying you don't even pause you just keep going right these keep going right on through these things all right there's no comments there and the knowledge because I just looked down because it says right here and the godliness brotherly kindness there's no there's no stop no add to Godliness brotherly kind you just keep this at it right up just keep right on adding to it that's why I think these are Blended together they're not something and we we can we do give them as an example of a stair step but they're really not you build on this one to get to the next one sure but it's just a flowing up and down of Faith virtue in all these different patience godliness and brothers and kindness I mean there's only lines in the pyramid just for the purpose of separating them so that we can see them right I wish there was a way that we could take those lines out because they're really not you don't get you don't fill up with virtue and then stop and then get no more virtue and then fill up with knowledge and stop and get no more knowledge no it just keeps I wish there was a way you could blend all them words together and just keep pushing them up that's what he's doing right he's taking us all the way up you never you never get to a point where virtue is no good to you anymore right right never so virtue doesn't stop down there and then you add but you for an hour English language or or for our explanation we have to put add to your faith virtue but there's no common there it's just continuation right yeah listen get back over here the fans turning the face all right and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity there's no commodary they're just absolutely flows right on in okay or if these things be on you bro what's that say in you not on you own you they fall off the Winds of the world and the cares of the world and the lust of the world will do what they'll just blow it right off of you but if you're inside this building you're part of this building if you're outside the building you're not a part of the building but you're inside this building so in if these things be in you and abound in other words overflow like we were talking about the dream the other day about sister Shepard about her dream that she had where the water was just boiling out of the top all right and about they make you that word their make just like you'd make your child do something it's just going to make you if you do these things right what it's just going to become common to you it's just going to become something that you do without even thinking right right becomes a part of you becomes a part of your everyday life brother Brown instead of walking breathing living instrumentation of God walking breathing living all right you said a lot of things I do not godly well maybe you're not God I'm gone in this yet but you're doing the things toward that all right because you know what you got to use virtue to have knowledge you got to use knowledge and virtue to have temper that's what I'm saying you don't take first you and just have virtue and then put it aside and say now I've got knowledge and put it aside no you use virtue to have knowledge because what is virtual strength you have to have strength to know that God's right know that the word's right know that the knowledge of God is right then you take the virtue and knowledge that you've get and that teaches you to be patient got it then you take that part and add it and then you got patience then God then see what I'm saying you got you need all these and and it took them a man like Peter to put them in line and then it took a prophet of God to explain every one of them virtuous strength and you draw strength like Peter Silver and Gold Have I None see Peter Peter when he wrote this he'd already witnessed him they knew he had virtue because he had something to give that guy out on the street called or the gay called Beautiful all right they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful now how many times I know a lot of you don't have fruit trees but I have a a plum tree that bears every other year I bought me two more of the uh this year to go in between them years but I love plums but you know what that tree's not near as pretty now it don't have anything for me to go get it's unfruitful right but boy next year it's going to have those great big plums on it and also most of y'all some of y'all have come by and ate them they're big old plums you know they're really good well you know I don't care much for that tree now but now next year I don't care for it because I'll look out there and see them big old plums on it right they know I wasn't standing pick them and even right off the tree well that means it's the tree was fruitful but I ain't gonna go out there tomorrow and do it or the next day or anytime this year there's no fruit on it and I know that because I see what it bears you understand what I'm saying okay so same way with you and I it says right here that said You shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful that's a promise in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see it far often has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence how many times he said diligence diligence diligence delegates to make your calling and election sure that's what we're doing now we're finding out whether we're really born again or whether we're not right and it's good to find out both right it's because you can do something but if you're deceived then you're just deceived there's just no there's no help but God 's the only one that can break you out of that whether the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall okay we're gonna stumble and trip he said you won't fall because you can't fall if you gotten a new birth yeah you can fall from these virtues you don't get them automatically at the new birth you have to grow all right just like Jonas he's got everything he needs to drive a car but he's got a grow he's gotta get some character about him and that's what those are those those are character virtues that's right you know I'm never gonna be a quiet person but I can use my loudness to maybe get a point across to you or not being so quiet and timid maybe okay I'm not gonna be fine Timmy because I believe what I know I don't know what I believe and I just believe that and I'm just at the place where I do nobody's gonna shake me off these old doctrines that people have got in the way that people act and and the way the people act in the world and think that's not going to bother me go ahead but you say that's insignificant and that's just oh that's Mr wet no somewhere down the line that's going to come back to you it's just like I ran in here this is promises that God give us somewhere that's going to come back to you it may not be in somebody and not falling for or in water but you'll never know maybe till you get over there that they would be a Christian walk by and was going to slip and fall you say well y'all gotta know that and that's the way he that's the way he's leading in guiding us I don't I'm like Daddy I don't think Jesus just got up in the morning and said okay I'm gone I gotta act like God no he went about his duty but he was so much gone till the things of the world didn't bother him he had a mission he had he had a way he had to go and he went that way he was led of the Lord to do things and you say letter of the Lord to get a puddle of water up well why not we've had manifesting God in you not going to manifest himself anyway and to manifest himself I gotta show other people see it but you don't see it yourself and that's manifesting you said we want to have a Priceless experience and then have a crash size tooth you guys I mean you don't know who's watching you either right right that's it right you don't know who's watching you either I know who's watching us right but you know really these uh that brings up a point let me make this point and you may appear that's really those are not for God seeing us that's right those are not for God to see in US God's all-knowing he knows we're gonna who's gonna get up there to love so he's sitting back and watching what you'll do that's right so that you'll have confidence that's what this says here it says to happen that you'll never fall if you do these things there's an absolute way to get to God and to be like God there's a way to give to God which is have faith then there's a way to be like God is to do these virtues virtue knowledge and let people see it in you that's the witness that's going to be on the day of judgment it's not going to be a Bible it's going to be laying there on the day of judgment it's got things written out um uh if this is Johnny walked by water and no it's not gonna be that you're gonna know and the person that either slept or fell or didn't slip they're gonna know that's why we got an eternity for these things to just unfold the Bible says the former things will pass away I think all the bad things will but you know what we will not forget what we've done down here I don't I don't see why we're going to go over there and just what we're going to have to think about and talk about it and do an act there was a man that came along and I asked him how he was and he said well and that's good so I thought well I'm not gonna give him any money because I don't know who he is you know and I was kind of in a hurry so I went on the in-store got the card so I went and I bought him some crackers and I bought him some tuna and some Vina sausage and then I got a banana I'll get a banana for me but then when I got back after the curves Don came up and he was ready to go well when I come out of Quality Foods I couldn't find any so I said well you know I'll just take it home I'll give it to somebody else or something so I went Donna came and got me and I said drive through the parking lot just the same time so we drove this parking lot and he went in there and said Don I said well I think I saw him walking down the road so we get to the red light right there at the lot sure enough he was walking around so Donna said what do you want to go go give it to him I said yeah I bought it foreign one Sunday we left here from church went over to feed the cats a good shot of a man on I had stolen a tractor drunk driving had turned the corner there and wiped out about five to seven of our cars one of them we had just got back from the body shop this was the place I told God I said that was the guy that wiped out all our cars on that stolen tractor that we did because we caught him potential violated he went to jail we got enough the insurance wouldn't pay for the parts and that guy sold track yeah we had no recourse and you'll see how hungry they are right so there's wisdom to use that don't just be don't give up every dime you got I mean we're Christian and we're supposed to act like Christians and they'll probably call you an antichrist for not doing it but you don't know you just got to be letting the Lord you just the best thing to do is just say hey buddy come on I'll get you uh I'll buy you ten dollars worth of you don't know you hand them ten dollars they'll probably go get drunk and hit somebody and kill them you know you never know the best thing to do is we did that one time in Thompson Georgia we were going to June's dad at McDonald's the guy said my wife down here on the side of the road and I need twenty dollars for gas and I was getting ready to give me twenty dollars and I said hey I'll help you I said I'll get a gas can and I've got my car here and Jim's inside was doing something and I said well I'll just drive you no no that's okay man I just need the $20 to get my gas with and I'm like okay I said I'll meet you down there and I said I'll just meet you I said where's it at I know Thompson I know where the highway goes I said I'll just is she on the side of the road over there oh that's okay man don't worry about it I'll get it from somebody else yeah so I mean like I said 10 minutes later he was hustling somebody else so when Don gives somebody money yeah going back to what you said about you never know who's watching this ladies we stand out more now than any other age all these mini skirts everybody's watching us because we look different when you do something yeah not right yes well it doesn't match the profession that you have on it doesn't match the fruit that's on the tree the fruit right you know the direct long dress yeah that's why you have to be careful and even being careful not everybody's got on a long dress and got long hair some I just like some people just like long dresses and long hair but you gotta you that's why this is the Plus to me these are pluses you got the Holy Ghost you got the new birth you're you're just as Eternal as God is God still speaks to you God still speaks through you God still does things for you but he wants to add he says add to that's a plus add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge you understand what I'm saying so it's an ad these are attitudes right okay these are not just Elementary now Elementary's good at least you're in Chicago yeah but why would you want to be 40 years old and still be in first grade you know have a beard in the fourth grade you know well see you know there was something wrong well then people would know something's wrong spiritually mentally you understand what I mean with your spiritual mentality not your natural mentality if you've if you've been born again for 20 years and you still got the same old problems we got to start shedding these that's why that pyramid's in an angle and the angle goes away not toward everybody got that yeah you see what I'm saying run around and said one time he said we are on a knife blade Edge he said an ax blade actually you know you turn an ax blade up like this that blade goes right up to nothing if it's real sharp if a knife's real sharp you can't hardly see the end of it or the edge that's what we're on he said if you fall off one way or the other he said there's no way that you come back he said you got to come back up to the middle right that's right because what is that angle falling away so what that was doing in Sister Shepard's dream it wasn't here I was doing it brother Berlin I thought it was here but Ginger Shepherd's green that was the pyramid and brother random had pulled the top off of it or the man did and that the man had to be by the brown because he said it was a messenger and he was pouring water in the word and then water was coming out over the top of that pyramid and flowing down the sides and he said it was trash so this is all getting rid of trash all right up and out up and out all right and then what happens then then what does God do he takes a meat sealed that baby up with the Holy Spirit seals you all the way in not that you won't ever get no more virtue but you'll come to a place that's what I said God knows how much virtue you need you don't right you just don't know you just got to keep getting it that's right Silver and Gold Have I not now if that didn't just drain Peter and he was done for his rest of his life no that was probably just the beginning because remember the book of Acts done many many words okay so that's what we need these are pluses they're additions too that's just like Jonas he's a human but there's additions too he's going to add human knowledge right he's going to add these human things but he's a human but he's going to add these character builders during his life to where he's not going to sit well he may sit in his mom's left and leave about 20. the way he's going now but one day mom was going out to kick him out and say buddy you got to stand up on yourself and you need to feed yourself being 20 years old and shaving you need to go feed yourself all right but see that's abnormal but normal people want that word leave and cleave you know they get it backwards nowadays the Bible says leave your mother and father and cleave to your spouse not leave your spouse and cleave to your father mother I can see where they the Lord added those things you need a strength well that's what we're going to talk about once we get off of the Holy Ghost we're going to get into that because it is an addition to your new birth it's in there but you got to see it in there right right because see you can you can like brother Brown said you you get the Holy Ghost you got everything you need for the rest of your life whenever he quit preaching when he got the new bar did he quit acting like a question did he quit doing I mean he should have the way that says he's got everything he needs for the rest of his life he ought to just lay back under a tree you know and just take a nap no that's when you really know how to use what you got right Jonas has got hands arms feet and all that I mean his arms hearing his stuff he don't know what to do he's doing with it but he's got it he don't know what to do with his hands but one day maybe he'll be a skilled labor and he'll be able to take those hands he can't hardly pick up a spoon now and be able to make a rocket out of it but it's because of not what he's got but what's added to what he's got that's the same way with you and I it's an add two looks like brother Brown said here that's how we know we've passed from Death unto life we look back to the pit where we were hewed from all right so he said oh it's bad to look back when our brother Brown said look back it's not bad to look back it's it's bad to turn and go back all right it's not bad to look back and say hey God you've brought me through this right here and it had to be you but but to go back into the pit different scoring all right we're not what we want to be we're not even what we ought to be right but one thing we're thankful for we're not what we used to be right that was the old color sister that said that now it's a very profound statement now look at the next thing he says we're on the road being born again put you on the highway puts you on the road all right now what you got to do is is you've got to make the preparation to go either walking or driving you make the choice you can either go real fast or you can go real slow but at least you're going and you're on the right road right now you can go from here to California but if New York's where you were going you're in bad shape you got on the wrong road somewhere but if you get on the right Road you'll get there and having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and Corruption of the world you're above that now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things seen the corruption of the world all right let's continue what he's his thought right here just for a minute and having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and Corruption of the world you're above that now that's now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world besides this so it besides it's okay giving all diligence adding to your faith versus using diverse knowledge to knowledge Temperance patience patience regardless regardless and brother kindness charity y'all gonna have to quieten them babies down a little bit I'm sorry don't need to be disturbed while we're doing this now he was giving us the outline here what to do know how to do it now there it is know how to do it you don't know how you don't know how there's no way you can know how to live like God if you don't have a little God in you you can say oh look at brother Dale well yeah he's a good example but he can't make me what I am now listen now but through him that's right through him I can't right through brother Bob I can't through you I can but you can't make me that's right and you can live in exemplary life you can live a life that's just so close to God like brother round but look what did they see they saw him as God that's great not God using it that's right they saw him as God not God using it but if you'll see that God is using that funnel I think brother Brown had these virtues to be able to preach it you got to have them other than that you're just presuming and other than that you're just saying well maybe no faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness that are additions to what you already have okay so now list what he says that's why I chose this message this morning for the church knowing that people are traveling for last night I sit here and he's out of town about 90 what he's saying is the people are coming in and not the people that are there at the Tabernacle see they're all common people poor ordinary dress there's no great Anthem he's telling the people no great anthem from some pretend to be Angelic choir pop organs and some stained glass windows you have a hard time getting to see it on the bench they don't come for such as that but they come because inside of them say is something that sees a beauty that the natural eye doesn't see it's a spiritual eye that catches the beauty of Christ okay now what happens is in life and we'll get to understand I'm gonna try to finish at 10 30. is that we are going to be able to come to a place to where not everybody's going to go oh they're just so fearsome now that we've got to come to a place to where that you know when brother Brandon walked into a room the room changed right right atmosphere chain but you said oh it was the prophet now what about that time he walks into the house he tells the story kids are screaming that's right right now this is the Prophet this is Dr we ain't talking about some being out and healing the scent raising the dead he's just a man he's at home he's not got this great anointing on him you may not think but he walks into a room and there's just chaos in the house well you know what if he didn't have a little bit of these virtues he would have started screaming like sometimes we do he would have started why screaming at his wife because it's her problem she's the problem and the kids smack them on send them to bed what'd he do he walks in he doesn't say a word he puts on an apron he goes over and he says honey let me help you with dinner or dishes or whatever he was doing and he what'd he say he said now he didn't say instantly I believe he said five or ten minutes somewhere in the he said either like 10 minutes later he said the kids were playing in the in the room he said the wife was real happy and I was helping her make dinner and everything just after 10 minutes so it's not an instantaneous thing but what did he do he had virtue he created an atmosphere he created an atmosphere but he had enough knowledge to know not to do certain things plenty of temperance because he controlled his temper right and a big Gob of patience to be patient with all that going on because a lot of times we'll jump in the middle of something going we all been guilty of this we'll jump in something make it worse that's right I told Donnie I'll tell him that Susan tell him too Donnie if something was going on at work and Donnie would just walk right in the middle of it and make it 10 times worse the before and the after he just walks in and gets involved that you you don't need to do that I've told him that so I mean nothing not he don't know that I know of it okay do what he's trying to think he's just trying to fix it but you can't fix something that you don't know nothing about okay you just can't go in and go brother Ryan didn't go in and go maybe a little bit of temper you know remember what she done slammed the doorstep that's okay but remember he assessed the situation and I believe God took over I believe he had an anointing not just being a husband father man of the house and all this stuff right right he just took over what was then he took over what was in him raised up and took over now that's what we need because when the water goes in we feel we'll read next Sunday we'll read sister Shepard's dream that water that he was pouring in was pure but when it come out it had trash and I didn't make the water trashy it was just getting the trash out of what was inside that vessel remember then he put honey in it and poured water back in it and it held the water okay brother Brown that's why that holy spirit's up there at the top that's not the Holy Spirit at the bottom you might not have a lot of honey when you got the Holy Spirit at the bottom yeah right God you still gotta have faith still gotta have better you still gotta have mileage still gotta have temper but when you get up there where it says holy spirit above the brotherly kindness that's when the Honey comes in now buddy well I'm telling you about some honey honey is pure there's no way you can duplicate honey there's no way honey is twice as sweet as sugar honey is so pure they don't even they can't even duplicate it and that's what why do you think you use honey read the Bible what brother Brown and what brother Brown says about honey and the honeycomb because that's what the scripture says sweeter than honey and the honeycomb will fish sweeter than honey 's two times sweeter than pure sugar man you can get bathed in it he said that box finally held water what what was going in see sometimes the water the word goes in and it goes out yes it don't reside that's right okay what he was talking about then and when he said the man poured the water in the box and the Box held the water so we're going to come to a point in time I believe to where what we hear is going to absolutely right there and make an effect on us now it takes a long time come on people yeah right we've been here 20 30 years it takes a long time for the word to take effect on us now why we don't have all them working that's true when we have all them working in our life the honey the honey seals it in and what we get is going to do us more than sugar more than honey because it's sweeter than honey and the honeycomb so it's just going to be the words going to be much more sweeter to us we're still going to have cares of life still gonna have problems don't think you'll ever be problemless even if you're up there in the top of the pyramid you're still going to have life problems life issues life you know why you have a lot of issues because you can't control everybody that's right okay but remember when we get there everybody's going to be that so then what you don't have that devil playing with you so much because the devil's playing with you all the time now whether you whether you're a manifested Son of God adopted into the family of God Jesus got killed when he was an adopted son of God brother Brown had real bad problems when he got adopted and started preaching the uh the seals thousands of his friends left him he was standing virtually by himself just like the Lord Jesus did so being adopted is not going to be this you're going to walk into a hospital and everybody's just going to start jumping up but you know what they say it's when brother Branham died in the emergency room when they put him in that emergency room every person every patient in that emergency room got better he never prayed and he was just his presence well see that's what you want you want that presence of God so much to wear to where you don't have to uh like I said Peter didn't have to go look up in a quote book Peter didn't have to go over and get a Bible and read one I need to have a person no it was a natural occurring thing and when they put brother Branham even even the body of William Branham was dying that soul and that Spirit of that man had so much of God in him till it just flowed out and him being in that emergency room they said it cleared the whole emergency room when he was there now he died but the spirit that was in him was so much use of that man until everybody in the emergency room got better and that's a documented fact now the whole Hospital didn't get emptied out but right there around where he was you see what I'm saying they see the power that God can give you without you having power that's right because power without character satanic that's why these virtues are character you can have Satan has power yeah right but he doesn't have character he can't act like God I mean he can act like God but he can't be God and you and I got to come to place where we are God made manifest in another form made manifest in another form if you keep that right all right next Sunday we'll work on we'll look at sister Shepard's dream and see um see what was going on with that you have to move well yeah yeah some people ain't gonna care how you acting it's got to be for you you've got to realize that when I used to do stuff like that
