[12:55] reason they're doing that they won't
[12:56] know how she put up with me for 60 years
[12:59] and they figure if they can get that
[13:01] straightened out and find out how she
[13:03] done that they can save a lot of money
[13:05] by just putting people in the cubicles
[13:07] and send them to the moon you know they
[13:09] can do it from the easy way because to
[13:11] find out how she put up with me but I
[13:14] can say one thing with all of my heart I
[13:16] love her and I've had a good 60 years
[13:18] it's been a wonderful 60 years you say
[13:22] well have you got along all together
[13:23] we're still together well you know have
[13:29] you done this we're still together
[13:32] that's wonderful because that way you
[13:36] know if you're still together you know
[13:38] love has to be the binding factor to
[13:41] cover all the things I want to
[13:42] appreciate I'm doing it all and the
[13:47] lower gear yeah yeah we put him in put
[13:51] him in the middle between us both and it
[13:54] takes care of a lot of things okay
[13:56] amen that's you young people that are
[14:00] coming along starting in your married
[14:01] life in times just remember my brother
[14:04] he was going to do a or was getting
[14:08] married and he asked this old country
[14:10] preacher to do the wedding and then he
[14:12] thought well now that old guy he is he's
[14:16] just ain't nothing he's just old country
[14:19] preacher you know once it ain't got no
[14:21] sense at all and so they went over to
[14:24] talk about getting married and the
[14:26] preacher said well son said I want to
[14:28] explain something too he said marriage
[14:30] is like this and when you and your wife
[14:33] said you you have problems sometimes so
[14:35] the best thing to do is just throw a
[14:37] rope across the house and said then if
[14:41] you get older one inch you gets hold on
[14:42] the other one said it won't do nothing
[14:44] but this is exact
[14:45] he said just lay down you're in walk
[14:47] around the house get her by the hand and
[14:49] walk off of the rope and everything will
[14:51] be all right he said I left thinking
[14:53] that guy was a smart
[14:54] in the world so that's the way we change
[14:56] things by what we do they meant just
[15:00] keep those things in mind keep her in
[15:02] mind tomorrow and Tuesday all right

[15:13] us that Lord you would bring us into
[15:15] your word you would open our
[15:18] understanding to the things of the
[15:21] message of the hour that you'd reveal
[15:23] yourself to us and that you've got us

[16:02] which liveth and abideth for ever on it
[16:05] now we go over to 2nd Peter to pick up
[16:11] our thought verse 1 Simon Peter servant
[16:14] and apostle of Jesus Christ to them who
[16:16] have obtained him that have attained
[16:19] like precious faith with us through the

[16:39] 1 now we're gonna be talking about it

[16:43] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[16:46] are given unto us exceeding great and
[16:48] precious promises that by these you

[16:53] having escaped the corruption that is in
[16:56] the world through lust and besides this

[17:03] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[17:04] patience and to patience godliness
[17:06] and to godliness brotherly kindness and
[17:08] to brotherly kindness charity you may be
[17:12] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[17:16] reading of the word and we tried to
[17:22] cover a point this morning anyway just
[17:24] was doing basically preaching you know
[17:27] my style because of what we were trying
[17:29] to bring but I hope it opened up some to
[17:32] your understanding of what we're trying
[17:36] to do in studying the Word of God and
[17:39] letting us know more about what the
[17:42] faith of the fathers is and what to
[17:45] expect in this day because this is the
[17:48] day when all things are to be made
[17:51] manifest all right so this is the time
[17:54] there was not an age until now to word
[17:57] that it would be that God could come on
[18:00] the scene and bring his word sure he was
[18:04] there through the ages he was there in
[18:07] every age he was there to bring the word
[18:09] of that age and all that but he could
[18:11] not bring the fullness of the word until
[18:15] this life age all right because that was
[18:18] the scriptures to promise that he would
[18:21] do it he said I will restore so he was
[18:24] you know bound to do that then you have
[18:27] he had to wait until the end time to
[18:32] bring everything into the right position
[18:34] place or whatever to where it could be
[18:38] brought forth because you couldn't bring
[18:40] it forth back in other ages you would
[18:43] have to have the opening of the word all
[18:45] right and that's what I hope you're
[18:47] listening to because as I said this
[18:50] morning now we talked about the faith of
[18:53] the fathers we talked about the statue
[18:55] of a perfect man the things like that
[18:57] and those disciples were writing what
[19:03] God was present in their time and they
[19:07] were writing the Word of God all right
[19:10] see it's not to just talk about a good
[19:14] thing or to it is to actually see that
[19:17] the word was unveiling itself
[19:20] they're to her that it would would be
[19:23] the very top post that would anchor
[19:25] everything all the way down through and
[19:27] would wind up all the ages in the things
[19:30] and see if Peter dam was writing the
[19:33] word we're in the time of the revealing
[19:35] of the word alright they were writing
[19:38] the word the the understanding of the
[19:41] scriptures the thing they were writing
[19:43] that down as God led them alright see
[19:47] now we are the people that can read that
[19:50] knotted it changed in between it was
[19:54] down to the ages you had the same
[19:56] writings but you did not have the Holy
[20:00] Spirit to you had to hold the spirit for
[20:03] each age don't misunderstand but it was
[20:05] not able to express through those ages
[20:08] through what it's been able to do in
[20:11] this life days because the promise of
[20:13] the coming of the prophet is for this
[20:17] age at this time so you had to wait God
[20:19] waited we'll get to it in patience you
[20:21] know that God had patience he waited
[20:23] patiently on a time to where he could
[20:27] bring his word and declare it and bring
[20:30] it forth and now we're into the position
[20:33] of the opening of the word the revealing
[20:37] of the word the making alive of the word
[20:40] that get to Poland coma when Peter when
[20:44] when those when the apostles when the
[20:47] prophet sometimes wrote the Word of God
[20:49] alright now it was alive to them what
[20:55] they wrote about was alive it wasn't
[20:58] just a even though Paul would say you'd
[21:01] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[21:03] an eye to him that was alive but he
[21:06] could not attain unto it because of
[21:08] having to wait until the end time but
[21:11] still he could see it and understand it
[21:15] to be off in the future and he did
[21:17] because he said they must need to be
[21:19] this and things all these things must
[21:21] happen before the Lord can come alright
[21:25] and he knew that but it was alive to him
[21:28] right those Old Testament prophets when
[21:32] they spoke they spoke in the very
[21:34] first person right you know David
[21:40] Solomon etc first person now getting a
[21:43] point listen if they could speak in the
[21:48] first person without the baptism of the
[21:51] Holy Ghost
[21:53] right now they didn't have the baptism
[21:56] will hold us they had an anointing of
[21:58] those who go to come upon them they
[21:59] didn't have the new birth and the Old
[22:01] Testament well see if they could do that
[22:04] what about you and I or what about an
[22:07] end times surely you could see that the
[22:09] disciples that when they had that faith
[22:13] of the fathers placed in their heart
[22:15] Paul and all of them the thing that they
[22:17] could speak the things of God with a
[22:20] whole lot more clarity than the Old
[22:22] Testament prophets because Old Testament
[22:24] prophets was always leave kind of a you
[22:27] know what I'm talking about it would
[22:28] never finish it would speak off but
[22:32] never finish the total product well yet
[22:35] when the disciples came forth and they
[22:37] began to bring the word see then the
[22:40] word comes forth in its purity all right
[22:43] I hope you understand my point see if
[22:46] the prophets could speak it in the first
[22:49] person who was that speaking through the
[22:51] disciples you understand who was i
[22:56] speaking through Paul and Peter now
[22:58] surely he was speaking in the first
[22:59] person to them all right who was it
[23:02] speaking in this last days when the
[23:06] mysteries of God would be revealed to
[23:08] the endtime people who was that speaking
[23:11] unto us right we don't make the man
[23:13] nothing we make the vessel to be what it
[23:17] is but we make the God to use that
[23:20] vessel to give understanding all right
[23:23] then how much more is it now that we
[23:26] should realize what has taken place that
[23:30] these things has been unfolded to you
[23:33] and I that we can see the things the
[23:35] prophets the Bible said spoke of and was
[23:38] not able to see we should see it come
[23:41] forth in our day and understand see
[23:44] that's the that's the part of the
[23:46] writing of the word now
[23:47] to the making alive of the word because
[23:50] now come on I can quote the Prophet with
[23:52] it because he said when my brother when
[23:54] my sister was the time that there was to
[23:56] come or the manifestation of the sons
[23:58] and daughters of God outside of this age
[24:02] was you're not saying down to time that
[24:05] they they didn't have it no we're not
[24:06] talking about they didn't have they had
[24:08] it from their time but they could not
[24:10] make manifest this is the day of
[24:12] manifestation right this is the day of
[24:16] bringing things out in the open right
[24:19] you get a guy's name come up for
[24:21] president I ain't even never heard his
[24:23] name didn't know he existed don't know
[24:26] who he isn't or nothing right two days
[24:29] later they done got all about his life
[24:31] and how many times he's been in adultery
[24:33] and then many times and all of the
[24:34] things that's happened in his life and
[24:36] what he's done and although son 1
[24:38] because it's the manifesting time it's
[24:42] the revealing it's the opening so you
[24:45] can't hide anything so there's no need
[24:48] of trying to hide it stuff is to walk in
[24:50] what are we're doing
[24:51] see and and to bring you know to that
[24:55] place all right now then to see that
[25:02] we've come into as we were trying to
[25:05] just speak about this morning of
[25:08] knowledge because knowledge is a
[25:12] wonderful thing but it can be damaging
[25:16] to if it's Holy Ghost knowledge
[25:19] everything is wonderful but if it's
[25:22] human intelligence knowledge they are as
[25:26] the Prophet would call it you know he
[25:28] said we have two different face two
[25:30] different virtues two different
[25:31] knowledge one of them is Holy Ghost
[25:33] knowledge that's God speaking but the
[25:37] other one is the nature given which is
[25:39] life and knowledge run through the
[25:42] scriptures and find out what knowledge
[25:43] that you could say you know that it is
[25:47] and and this is one I like that I just
[25:50] picked up about knowledge in Hosea six
[25:53] and six God says for I desired mercy
[26:01] and not sacrifice and the knowledge of
[26:06] God more than burnt offerings his own
[26:12] knowledge because he was God whatever
[26:15] his own knowledge he desired that more
[26:19] than anything any offerings or anything
[26:23] you said well then we need to know we
[26:26] need to know the word yes we need to
[26:28] study the word yes
[26:29] we need to read and and constantly study
[26:34] but to realize then that to do that is
[26:38] just head knowledge
[26:41] alright I'm saying God don't quicken it
[26:43] sometimes right when you're first
[26:44] reading it nuts that's true we can do
[26:46] that but you know yourself it doesn't
[26:48] happen most of the time most of the time
[26:51] you read the word at least I do
[26:52] I read the Word of God I get something
[26:55] and it looks good
[26:56] and I so okay that's good I'll write
[26:58] that down and I I'll jot down a little
[27:00] notes or something you know and then
[27:02] I'll go on and I'll wait
[27:04] all right then one day I'll look back
[27:06] and say well what did that note mean
[27:08] Peggy she's always been good about that
[27:11] my wife she's see I have little pieces
[27:14] of paper when I'm sitting here on a
[27:17] listening to ministers and things or
[27:19] brought around them or whatever
[27:21] I have little pieces of paper and I mean
[27:23] no there's been a little bitty pieces
[27:24] like that well she knows better than
[27:26] throw it in those pieces away because
[27:29] there's something I wrote on our and it
[27:31] might just be two or three letters
[27:32] across a page you know but it's
[27:35] something that will bring back to my
[27:37] memory later on what it is and what God
[27:40] was dealing with me about because that's
[27:42] the point all right
[27:44] but getting now to our point that we've
[27:46] dealt with that we must have these
[27:50] virtues to be a virtuous Christian
[27:53] requires to have the virtues of God the
[27:56] virtues of God is the nature of God
[28:00] right this convert the word to nature's
[28:04] God is dealing with us trying to reveal
[28:07] his nature to us or get his nature to
[28:10] come in us alright see then it's heaven
[28:12] born
[28:14] faith is heaven-born virtue is
[28:19] heaven-born knowledge alright and see
[28:23] those things are God opening up to you
[28:27] and I and given us understanding what
[28:30] about it
[28:30] see I know the scripture talks that
[28:33] knowledge puffeth up yeah that's true
[28:37] it does if we just go with head
[28:39] knowledge and stay with that but if we
[28:42] get to a Holy Ghost knowledge they ain't
[28:44] gonna puff up it's gonna take us down
[28:46] right I've never got a revelation from
[28:50] God that ever exalted me you know people
[28:54] said well the Lord gave me this and I
[28:56] just got no when the Lord gives me
[28:57] something I go this way I do it is I
[29:01] just go down because I realize that if I
[29:06] do have what he just gave me it was not
[29:10] something I deserved it was not
[29:13] something that I tried to figure out for
[29:17] myself if something he wanted me to know
[29:21] see you know I prayed this way to him
[29:26] you know my dad died when I was about
[29:29] four years old so I never knew him the
[29:33] you that parents and new children
[29:35] especially now that you have a father
[29:37] and a mother or something you honor that
[29:40] and you love them and you talk to them
[29:42] it don't matter what you know and let
[29:44] everything work right because when you
[29:47] don't have it it leaves a vacuum it
[29:50] leaves a holder that I can't talk about
[29:53] what you can talk about that my mom and
[29:55] my dad took me to here taught me that I
[29:57] had done this I don't have any
[29:59] remembrance of that but I do have a
[30:02] Heavenly Father I do got now how the
[30:06] Heavenly Father you know what he he's
[30:11] good he talks to us sometimes and I love
[30:14] it that way but it never makes me to be
[30:16] say well I the Lord spoke to me this
[30:19] week coming no I don't preach like that
[30:23] I don't preach to try to get you to
[30:26] under
[30:27] staying what God and I listen that God
[30:30] has spoken to me I don't do that I want
[30:32] you I want him to speak to you I want
[30:37] him to manifest itself through you and
[30:39] then I'll achieve the goal that I'm
[30:41] after is get you to see God to get you
[30:45] to see the God that I see in this word
[30:47] is the greatest goal that I could have
[30:50] of anything okay now but we went through
[30:54] faith the new birth our faith in to be
[30:58] born again you know and then add virtue
[31:01] alright you can't know as I covered this
[31:04] morning on if it is a second see it's
[31:06] not that you say well okay I've got
[31:08] faith so what I'll do is I'll just work
[31:11] on knowledge that that don't work it's
[31:16] got to be honest together one
[31:19] piece at a time
[31:20] [Music]
[31:22] you say well what would you suggest that
[31:24] I work on if we have faith then the next
[31:27] thing to do work on virtue if we have
[31:31] virtue of faith in virtue then the next
[31:33] thing to do is to work on knowledge and
[31:37] to realize that these things are Holy
[31:40] Ghost given it's not your faith it's
[31:44] God's faith given unto you that gives
[31:47] you the new birth and makes it your
[31:49] faith it's like my other prophet said
[31:52] God gave it to me
[31:54] he gave me the new birth but it's his
[31:56] Holy Ghost is him doing well yet he gave
[32:00] it to me
[32:01] alright now I can add virtue 1 by
[32:06] letting him do the same way that he done
[32:09] by giving me the new birth
[32:11] letting him unfold his word how did we
[32:14] find that we are to receive these
[32:16] virtues the prophet of Malachi 4 was to
[32:20] bring the message that was to be worth
[32:22] it could be to deliver the opportunity
[32:25] to would be there as we were covering
[32:27] this morning for us to understand the
[32:29] things of God that the ages did not
[32:32] receive and see then from that God can
[32:38] move into our hearts and lives
[32:40] and can bring things into manifestation
[32:43] whoo vocalizes it together read the
[32:46] statue of a perfect man and blasphemous
[32:48] names and notice that brother branham
[32:50] spends a lot of time talking about
[32:52] vulcanization or vulcanizing and he says
[32:55] you can't eyes a piece of metal
[32:57] to a piece of rubber etc or something
[32:59] like that
[32:59] it won't work it's got to be the same
[33:02] material C then virtue cannot be a
[33:07] different material from faith virtue is
[33:11] an outworking of faith I wish I could
[33:14] get that back I was going over to
[33:16] brother bin Howard's years ago and I was
[33:19] by myself and just riding through that
[33:21] one not going to church and for some
[33:24] reason picking them couldn't go and I
[33:27] just went by myself and I was riding
[33:29] through there and and I begin to think
[33:31] about the virtues and the things of God
[33:33] and it began to unfold and I wish I
[33:36] could get that back I do I wish I'd have
[33:38] had a tape recorder you know to push the
[33:40] button to talk into it because I could
[33:42] see how the knowledge the knowledge
[33:48] without first having the new birth it
[33:56] won't doing it sure it's good it's
[33:58] wonderful but it will not do what God
[34:01] wants it to do so you go by the new bar
[34:04] first see that brings Christ to you that
[34:08] puts within you the interpreter are the
[34:11] one that the knowledge can be done all
[34:13] right see then it's not to try to jump
[34:15] up from know you take faith and you let
[34:20] God add virtue and he adds virtue to you
[34:24] and it's not just as I said it it shows
[34:27] you by what the Prophet he said that's
[34:29] not to just live a virgin life he said
[34:33] that's not so in this case see there's a
[34:36] different meaning you can look up the
[34:38] word looking up and you're strong and
[34:40] you'll get the definition of maybe the
[34:45] Virgin in the parts you know you'll get
[34:47] that but that's not what it is in this
[34:50] case now listen to what I'm trying to
[34:52] say this morning then for
[34:53] that see it if you looked up virtue and
[34:58] it led you backwards to natural things
[35:01] it is not the correct definition
[35:05] scripturally speaking of the word virtue
[35:08] to be used in Peter does that mean
[35:13] anything to you it does to me it means a
[35:17] lot to me because I look up words look
[35:21] up temperance it doesn't mean this
[35:23] because I don't drink alcohol
[35:25] well yet if I looked it up in a
[35:27] dictionary that would be what it would
[35:29] mean but that's not the definition those
[35:34] things see come forth because see Peter
[35:37] was writing God's word was he listening
[35:42] this morning Peter was writing the word
[35:46] so the word virtue in Peters writing
[35:50] doesn't mean just a virgin life but we
[35:54] thought it did and that's the meanings
[35:56] of our and can be used but it's not in
[35:59] that case who would have known that
[36:02] outside of the Prophet the intellectual
[36:06] man with intellectual knowledge would
[36:08] have only led to the natural wording but
[36:13] to the Prophet he would look at things
[36:14] and he'd say no that's not true you know
[36:18] works you know yourself that this is
[36:20] stated him over that he looked up the
[36:22] word godliness then he said he looked
[36:24] forever we're trying to find what the
[36:26] word godliness now he knew what the word
[36:28] godliness man knew what it meant but he
[36:35] was hunting something that would mean
[36:38] what was being said right dark now any
[36:43] of you never used Thrones in courts you
[36:45] know what I'm saying it's true you've
[36:47] taken the word knowledge over here in
[36:49] the scripture and it it'll have this
[36:52] meaning you're going over through the
[36:54] scriptures when you take the word
[36:55] knowledge it has a different meaning
[36:57] it's according to what is being said
[37:01] will determine how that is used
[37:05] uh-huh and see that's what the profit
[37:08] then he looks at it he says that don't
[37:10] mean just being a virgin
[37:12] he's because that's one of the things of
[37:13] life and they don't mean uh temperance
[37:18] is stop drinking alcohol
[37:20] he said not in this case me all right
[37:25] see then getting the word get it away
[37:29] and that's why I love it the word that
[37:31] we can go with the Prophet and when he
[37:33] says something that sounds a little
[37:34] contrary you know I everybody ever looks
[37:39] at my Bible I want it and I'm not
[37:42] against people some people say oh I
[37:44] would never write a word in the Bible
[37:46] that's alright I'm not saying nothing I
[37:48] do in a lot of definitions a lot of
[37:56] words that I don't know what they mean I
[37:58] look them up right and a lot of times I
[38:04] don't get too good of an answer out of
[38:06] Webster's dictionary right because I'll
[38:11] get a different one I may get the word
[38:13] virtue to mean a virgin and that
[38:17] wouldn't work for what I'm trying to get
[38:19] so I I've taken listen to the Prophet
[38:22] and when he said something see I'm
[38:25] trying to think of the one that he said
[38:26] you know oh he said even that the ends
[38:30] and the bus is in the right place but
[38:32] then he'd turn around and say this
[38:34] should be the worst talking about the
[38:39] the coming of the Antichrist and I
[38:41] thought and said this thee should be
[38:43] changed art to the one and only what see
[38:49] father my point I'm trying to get a
[38:51] adult to you
[38:54] that we look at words when they don't
[38:59] always have that meaning when you're
[39:01] using them in the realm of Christianity
[39:05] you can take a word and use it over here
[39:09] and it works but you put it over here it
[39:11] won't work all right see that's the way
[39:15] God is speaking to you and I
[39:18] to try to get us to see what he wants us
[39:20] to know okay
[39:22] so that is not knowledge as we would
[39:26] look up the word knowledge and we say
[39:30] well the word knowledge means an amount
[39:32] of training or this or understanding
[39:35] order and see in this knowledge it
[39:37] doesn't mean that we had to spell the
[39:40] way the Sun everything's are saying we
[39:43] get you got to get it to her that you
[39:45] see what if Toma so its Holy Ghost faith
[39:52] his Holy Ghost virtue its Holy Ghost
[39:58] knowledge are can I change it to use it
[40:01] the way the Prophet did in the statue of
[40:03] her its heaven-born heaven-born faith
[40:09] heaven-born
[40:10] virtue heaven-born knowledge it's got
[40:16] something to do with it that's greater
[40:18] than the spelling of the word and that's
[40:21] what we should follow it look up what
[40:24] the Prophet is saying when he's given
[40:26] you a definition of something look that
[40:30] up and find out if it's true then you
[40:34] check it with those things okay
[40:36] now getting home so it's heavenly born
[40:38] knowledge it is not how much you know we
[40:46] need knowledge is knowledge that's just
[40:47] know is heaven more knowledge knowledge
[40:53] puffeth up natural knowledge will get
[40:57] you in trouble
[40:58] natural knowledge has brought us to a
[41:01] world of look at it all around you know
[41:08] look at the world all around that's
[41:10] heaven that's natural knowledge but now
[41:13] holy ghost' knowledge is to bring us to
[41:17] God in his word I want his understanding
[41:21] are you with me
[41:22] I want his understanding to me not
[41:26] something that I can study out and say
[41:30] well this means so-and-so code I looked
[41:31] at
[41:32] well that's well and good I do that too
[41:34] I'm constantly looking at words I'm
[41:37] constantly writing down definitions and
[41:39] things because that's the human thing
[41:44] but I'm also constantly trying to study
[41:47] to see what the Prophet said in that
[41:50] case we're talking about it the other
[41:52] day or woods yesterday something you
[41:55] know what I do when I'm talking to
[41:57] somebody
[42:01] nobody we're talking about you know the
[42:04] Bible or something you know what I'm
[42:06] doing a lot of time
[42:07] I'm not sitting there waiting on you to
[42:10] quit talking because I know the Prophet
[42:12] said that's wrong to do that he said
[42:15] we're not listening I listen to what you
[42:17] say but at the same time I'm listening
[42:21] what did the Prophet say do you do that
[42:26] I I think to my mind what did brother
[42:30] Branham say about this how did he
[42:31] approach this situation what did he say
[42:36] when this person asked this question I'm
[42:41] trying to think about what his answer is
[42:43] to that question and you know what I
[42:46] couldn't find out I couldn't find out
[42:48] it's the best answer all right I come to
[42:51] find out it saved me a lot of trouble if
[42:53] I just listen to what he said and let it
[42:56] be have you ever noticed him in
[42:58] explaining how was it so simple to us
[43:00] you know we tried to figure out the
[43:02] Trinity we couldn't figure it out we
[43:04] couldn't understand what it was and and
[43:06] we get all confused and everything
[43:08] because we swore by the Trinity and and
[43:10] tried to make our mark as to what we
[43:12] were as Trinitarian and all I got within
[43:15] when the Prophet comes through was
[43:16] simple illustrator
[43:18] he said I'm a father almost alone he
[43:24] said I'm a human you remember when that
[43:27] was first brought and how it just opened
[43:31] up the understanding of God well that's
[43:35] what I'm trying to do see I'm trying to
[43:37] think what does the scripture say see
[43:40] when I'm reading these things add to
[43:43] your faith virtue knowledge temperance
[43:44] pacing
[43:45] it does not tell me that how to do that
[43:50] I've been through that with you overall
[43:52] it doesn't tell you that and Peter how
[43:55] to get these virtues within by listening
[44:02] and waiting on God then he comes to the
[44:04] place of coming to you and explaining to
[44:07] you that the prophets message is how
[44:11] these virtues are to be brought into
[44:12] being what changes the hold up from a
[44:18] natural point of hid knowledge you can
[44:24] get head knowledge and you can say well
[44:26] I'll tell you what uh I've studied the
[44:29] Word of God and blessed art out I can
[44:31] know it and I know every word that's
[44:33] fine wonderful be great if we all done
[44:38] that but now where is the Christ that
[44:44] comes off the page the question was that
[44:49] life not how do you know how do you know
[44:53] whether you're born again or not you
[44:58] want a 9 euro question how do you know
[45:01] whether you're born again or not
[45:03] do you wait explain oh we believe this
[45:06] we believe the Prophet we answer a 9
[45:08] year old the give an answer to a 9 year
[45:15] old I can understand well the best out I
[45:20] could give was is an example of life
[45:25] that you're having problems you're in
[45:30] life and you're you're going along you
[45:32] having problems and all it wants
[45:34] something this happens the you you
[45:38] reason what we call the age of
[45:39] accountability or whatever and when you
[45:42] do see then you begin to be concerned
[45:44] about yourself well right now you know
[45:48] for sure if you begin to be concerned
[45:50] about yourself that it's not the devil
[45:53] because he's one trying to provide it so
[45:56] you know something else is dealing with
[45:58] you
[45:58] so how do you know you know something
[46:00] dealt with you all right then you wait
[46:03] on that one that's dealing with you
[46:05] until you can get a satisfied inward
[46:07] answer as to not being in your body and
[46:13] what you can tell it see taste feel
[46:15] smell in here it's not in your memory
[46:18] reason consciousness is insane
[46:20] all those are wonderful but that inside
[46:24] part of you is what's calling out the
[46:28] inside of you is calling out for an
[46:31] answer
[46:34] huh then as you do you start looking at
[46:38] that and seeing God is dealing with me
[46:42] and then God can speak to you he can
[46:46] speak to a child he can speak to to
[46:48] anybody they through that little
[46:52] illustration do you learn what a soul is
[46:55] then you learn what a how God is dealing
[46:58] with you and you know how that you are
[47:00] see we say the question is you know we
[47:03] say how do you know where you born again
[47:05] I believe every word the Prophet says
[47:07] well I'll we'll go pick up the internet
[47:10] and turn on to that deal that they got
[47:13] on there you know we're all these
[47:16] brothers now are spending all their time
[47:18] tearing down the message well you know
[47:22] what there was a time they would have
[47:24] swore that they had the Holy Ghost
[47:26] because they believed the prophets
[47:28] message what do they do now I got the
[47:32] Holy Ghost now called I don't believe it
[47:34] is that what it is no what would it
[47:41] matter in anything how can you do that
[47:45] how can you turn against the word but I
[47:51] found out he was wrong over here well
[47:54] when you found out he is wrong you were
[47:57] to automatically know that the others
[47:59] you're trying to read about was a whole
[48:00] lot more wrong than he was
[48:02] you don't ever look at sensible thing I
[48:06] mean you got somebody over here you know
[48:08] I'm not calling though nice but you got
[48:10] all these over here that's all
[48:12] kind of garbage cans living in adultery
[48:14] living in in all kind of forms and yet
[48:17] you're gonna take their word over the
[48:21] Prophet that brought the word even
[48:24] without dealing with him as a prophet
[48:26] without even thinking about him as a
[48:29] prophet you know his life was right they
[48:32] couldn't say nothing against it you know
[48:35] that the way he was they could not bring
[48:37] up those things or they'd have been sure
[48:40] to have done it and see there you got
[48:46] such a way to your matter over here to
[48:48] see that what I'd rather trust this man
[48:50] than to trust these that are off over
[48:52] here this changed their doctrines every
[48:54] time the wind blows you say well what
[49:01] are you trying to I'm trying to get you
[49:02] to find out a difference between heaven
[49:04] born knowledge and head knowledge right
[49:10] trying to talk about a difference
[49:12] between heaven born knowledge then those
[49:17] there's no contradictions in the word
[49:19] whatsoever between that and head
[49:22] knowledge which will accept the fact
[49:25] that there's contradictions all over the
[49:27] place you know that's because that's
[49:28] what your might alright
[49:30] heaven more knowledge doesn't do that
[49:32] heaven born knowledge captured you know
[49:35] puts a name into everything that's
[49:39] whether you having more knowledge or not
[49:42] is whether it agrees with the word and
[49:46] like I say it you got these people that
[49:48] for 40 years some of these preachers 40
[49:50] years they preach this message getting
[49:53] converts to this message and now they're
[49:55] gone they're gone because there's so
[50:02] little something that amounts to nothing
[50:07] of a hill of am it is nothing in
[50:10] comparison and who are they following
[50:15] what are they following who are they
[50:18] turning to
[50:23] and then are you gonna turn around and
[50:26] and you're gonna turn against this
[50:27] message and then understanding the one
[50:29] gotten in you're gonna go to
[50:30] trinitarianism who are they going to
[50:37] they're going to their own understanding
[50:40] head knowledge they're staying with
[50:44] their own thoughts head knowledge and
[50:48] all that'll do is take you to the grave
[50:52] but holy ghost knowledge will lead you
[50:56] to Jesus Christ see that's all I'm
[51:00] trying to do this to try to get us to a
[51:02] point to see knowledge you've read what
[51:06] the Prophet had to say about it
[51:07] that's watch over it's not into you if
[51:09] you're not interested in reading the
[51:11] statue of perfect men on what he said on
[51:13] knowledge you're not interested in any
[51:14] what so it wouldn't do me no good to
[51:16] read it to you I just took that point
[51:19] this morning and to trying to preach on
[51:21] that's what I'm doing now to try to get
[51:23] you to see knowledge that one born
[51:28] knowledge will agree with every word
[51:29] being right even though I don't
[51:34] understand it I still say it's right
[51:37] don't you even though I can't figure it
[51:42] out even though I tried for 40 years and
[51:45] can't understand it I know there's
[51:48] something wrong with me it's not
[51:51] something wrong with the message there's
[51:53] something wrong with me because I'm the
[51:56] one that's cutting off guard from
[51:57] revealing it but when it's revealed it's
[52:01] no longer heaven I mean no longer human
[52:05] knowledge
[52:09] revelation covers all things Holy Ghost
[52:14] knowledge right you know yourself the
[52:21] Prophet and the things that he spoke up
[52:23] about knowledge abraham believed god
[52:34] then was contrary to everything in the
[52:36] world Noah believed God was contrary to
[52:41] everything in the world Moses believed
[52:43] God contrary to everything in the world
[52:46] did he have head knowledge no he had
[52:51] Holy Ghost knowledge now here's the
[52:54] point that she got her seat between this
[52:56] message and another message or two
[52:58] you've got to remember one thing
[53:00] brother Branham covered in the statue of
[53:03] a perfect man that Moses had patience
[53:06] the children of Israel had patience that
[53:10] Moses had patience and they would have
[53:13] knowledge and things like that well you
[53:16] got to remember one thing now watch were
[53:18] you defined whether you're believing it
[53:20] or not Moses never had the new birth so
[53:29] he had never had heaven born knowledge
[53:32] in the form of the new birth are you
[53:35] following me
[53:36] well the Prophet said he had knowledge
[53:39] prophet said he had temperance prophet
[53:42] said he had patience I'm gonna believe
[53:43] the Prophet instead of you
[53:45] amen go ahead I'm not trying to get you
[53:47] to believe me I'm trying to get you to
[53:49] be sensible with that head knowledge
[53:51] that you've got they never had the new
[53:56] birth back there
[53:57] it's all they could have was an
[53:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost to come upon
[54:01] them to lead them and guide them and
[54:03] look what they were able to do with that
[54:06] what would have happened had they had
[54:08] the new birth Samson could kill a
[54:15] thousand Philistine what if he had a new
[54:18] work he wouldn't have cared if they
[54:20] would a hundred thousand of them
[54:28] see they had God given giving to them
[54:36] knowledge of the Word of God amen but
[54:40] they never had the new birth they never
[54:44] had to Holy Ghost knowledge of eternal
[54:46] life in their soul that's why they could
[54:52] go out and do what they done right why
[54:57] David would go out and have his best
[55:00] buddy killed to take his wife if he'd
[55:03] had the Holy Ghost he would have done
[55:04] that but he had to anointing you gotta
[55:10] admit that you got to admit what he had
[55:13] on him and where he was and what he
[55:15] could do but surely if you can see that
[55:18] he can do that without the new birth why
[55:20] would it be with us when the new birth I
[55:23] said we have problems thinking what
[55:27] would be even in anyway what would be in
[55:31] any way to think about this message be
[55:34] wrong
[55:41] why entertain even any thought that this
[55:44] message is wrong I like what one man
[55:51] said one time when he was talking to
[55:53] somebody about it and the guy said well
[55:55] you know they said something about
[55:57] profits and the guy said well well he's
[55:59] probably a false prophet he said well we
[56:01] got that soft the gusset what do you
[56:05] mean he said we got it solved his profit
[56:12] come on are you listening that was
[56:16] solved he was a prophet you call him a
[56:18] false prophet well he's our prophet we
[56:20] got that song now let's go for something
[56:22] man but you see God's could reveal to
[56:31] those people what was needed for the
[56:33] time what was needed for their time and
[56:39] their their place or where there's that
[56:40] he could speak to those prophets and do
[56:42] those great things but yet they never
[56:47] had heaven born knowledge now you say
[56:51] well whoever tell you I won't take what
[56:53] the Prophet said cuz I read here where
[56:54] he said they had it there go ahead cuz
[56:57] you're never gonna get any answer either
[56:59] if you got that far into your mentality
[57:03] of of mind to think that because brother
[57:06] Branham said that Moses had patience
[57:08] that gave him the patience for the
[57:10] statue of a perfect man then I'm gonna
[57:13] ask you do you have it well I don't know
[57:17] within Moses was greater than you into
[57:19] that birth and then won't work you see
[57:29] they didn't have a Holy Ghost knowledge
[57:32] like it's supposed to be they had one
[57:34] knowledge for the time of what was
[57:35] needed or whatever was to take place cuz
[57:38] he didn't have the new birth to bring it
[57:40] to him but I remember in the first years
[57:45] of studying the message when I studied
[57:47] that statue of a perfect man I'd run
[57:49] across those things and in my human mind
[57:53] I would say hey Moses had patience
[57:57] brother Brennan said I don't even have
[58:00] him yet but yet I got the Newburgh he
[58:01] said more that put Moses hey you ain't
[58:08] honest you even honest to admit what
[58:11] you've done yeah you know am I the only
[58:15] one that come into this thing blinded
[58:17] and all out of shape I had to come to
[58:22] the basis of realizing they had to be a
[58:23] prophet then when I realized that had
[58:28] come to that place I don't know more
[58:29] trouble with in the other because it
[58:31] would just be my head knowledge and I
[58:35] could stay with whatever the prophet
[58:36] would say until God would figure it out
[58:39] Wow it allow me to understand because
[58:44] brother Brown say that they would have
[58:46] patience or godliness or whatever it
[58:48] doesn't mean they had it in the new
[58:49] birth of that age because that's what
[58:52] he's trying to explain in the new in the
[58:55] statue of a perfect man that we don't
[58:57] have those things but we must have those
[58:59] things teaching there's a lot of
[59:08] difference between heaven knowledge that
[59:11] is the Holy Ghost knowledge rock that
[59:13] God is dealing with us to bring us to a
[59:16] place than there is from head knowledge
[59:20] head knowledge will keep us confused the
[59:25] Holy Ghost knowledge will straighten
[59:27] this out but it'll work from that inside
[59:33] it doesn't work on this head Holy Ghost
[59:36] don't work on your head it works in your
[59:38] heart sure it has to go through that it
[59:41] has to use those channels etc etc but
[59:45] it's not trying to work through there
[59:46] he's trying to work through your soul
[59:48] your being on what you are and see those
[59:52] early disciples had those virtues what
[59:57] would your father want to say you know
[59:58] by having those virtues they could write
[1:00:00] the Word of God but those prophets
[1:00:05] the Word of God for their age they
[1:00:07] didn't have did not have the new birth
[1:00:11] well I don't like that because I believe
[1:00:13] they did well all right I'm not gonna
[1:00:16] argue we don't spend no months arguing
[1:00:18] over whether who's got water who's got
[1:00:20] whatever I'm just gonna go on down the
[1:00:23] road but I'm gonna preach it the way I
[1:00:25] believe it and to see it that the way I
[1:00:28] can follow it through the word that I
[1:00:31] can see then that these virtues are
[1:00:34] required but if they're not our virtues
[1:00:39] there are ours because God gave them to
[1:00:41] us they are his virtues their are his
[1:00:45] nature in ways and things it's not me
[1:00:49] and you if God bringing to me and you
[1:00:52] hidden his way his point his nature see
[1:01:00] then that way we get confused about
[1:01:01] words and thought instead of just simply
[1:01:05] relaxing and letting God take us through
[1:01:07] the mess knowledge knowledge is a
[1:01:16] wonderful opportunity of mankind to be
[1:01:20] able to have knowledge that's great but
[1:01:25] if it's only human knowledge you will
[1:01:28] never curious no word but to outer space
[1:01:31] it cures to the moon you can't argue
[1:01:33] with that that's what they were saying
[1:01:35] last night someone was asking the
[1:01:36] question what did to get to the moon I
[1:01:39] said what Lane go and argue about
[1:01:41] whether they got to the moon or not I'm
[1:01:43] just gonna say with the scientific
[1:01:45] ability that they have today what would
[1:01:48] hinder them from getting there I'm not
[1:01:50] gonna argue whether they did or not what
[1:01:53] I thought we're brother Brown sit around
[1:01:55] ain't gonna argue with you about it cuz
[1:01:58] there's no argument about it you know I
[1:02:02] just know one thing for certain if there
[1:02:07] is a human knowledge that can that
[1:02:15] almost there's nothing withholding
[1:02:18] because that's what the Bible says
[1:02:19] there's nothing withholding from mankind
[1:02:22] look at what they could do the little
[1:02:26] telephone that a lot of you have a
[1:02:27] little machine here to transmit that's
[1:02:31] greater than the first computer they
[1:02:33] made the first computer covered a city
[1:02:35] block it took that much to put all those
[1:02:39] switches in it on and off and on and off
[1:02:45] but yet you could take your little bitty
[1:02:47] telephone and do more than that they
[1:02:51] have come to the place until nothing is
[1:02:53] we refrain from proving it every day
[1:02:59] that they're hacking these people in and
[1:03:02] can do anything they want to they're
[1:03:08] proving that the supernatural is here
[1:03:10] because brother Brown said they broke
[1:03:12] into God's laboratory and they can prove
[1:03:18] these scientific facts sometimes I'm not
[1:03:24] concerned about scientific facts I'm
[1:03:26] concerned about the Word of God a
[1:03:28] scientific facts not going to take you
[1:03:30] in a rapture for brother Branham we read
[1:03:31] them to you the other day it's in the
[1:03:32] statue of perfect man that a man with
[1:03:34] these abilities is gonna be qualifying
[1:03:36] for the rapture you know what these
[1:03:39] virtues then is what we need if we're if
[1:03:41] that's what's gonna qualifies for a
[1:03:43] rapture or he says for a resurrection
[1:03:47] and he says they without us cannot be
[1:03:50] made perfect he said they're waiting on
[1:03:52] us faith virtue knowledge God adding to
[1:04:05] you his own nature his own being giving
[1:04:13] to you the things we have need of and
[1:04:20] revealing himself at that same time
[1:04:26] knowledge to know the to Bible don't
[1:04:32] contradict no except well I know what
[1:04:38] don't contradict you know what I said
[1:04:40] that and I was Trinitarian come on get
[1:04:46] off of him quit being some glory you
[1:04:49] said the same thing you believed in a
[1:04:51] trinity and swore they wouldn't know
[1:04:52] contradictions well you find out they
[1:04:58] might not have been no contradictions in
[1:05:00] the word but there was a lot of
[1:05:01] contradictions in us as humans
[1:05:04] there's no contradictions in this
[1:05:06] message the message not the things the
[1:05:10] Prophet had to correct where he was
[1:05:12] wrong because he was a human being and
[1:05:15] made mistakes and taught things are
[1:05:17] incorrectly but yet the Holy Spirit
[1:05:20] corrected him that's not in the message
[1:05:25] there's no contradictions in the message
[1:05:28] there's contradictions in our ideas of
[1:05:31] the message but stems they stay with him
[1:05:36] for a second but what I'm trying to say
[1:05:40] as I said we couldn't understand the
[1:05:44] Trinity we didn't know where they was
[1:05:48] three four ten or twelve really right
[1:05:51] although you're silly there was just
[1:05:53] three backyards all we believed in well
[1:05:55] you found out that was wrong but think
[1:06:00] about it a prophet just giving you a
[1:06:03] simple illustration of a father or son
[1:06:06] and the human being and you know what
[1:06:10] God could quicken and take away that
[1:06:14] idea of the Trinity away from us this is
[1:06:18] not a little simple illustration well
[1:06:20] why wouldn't I want to follow that man
[1:06:25] as I've always said I don't care what
[1:06:27] they prove brother branham would I don't
[1:06:30] care if they put out it and I don't see
[1:06:32] why they hadn't put out a lot of the
[1:06:33] lives because they lied about all the
[1:06:35] rest what's the difference I haven't
[1:06:38] much of them come up with a line saying
[1:06:39] that he's my
[1:06:40] 14 times and all this add the other
[1:06:42] whatever because there was one time
[1:06:48] Gordon made a man's life so straight
[1:06:52] until they couldn't find nothing against
[1:06:54] right but what about it hadn't you draw
[1:07:01] the file or something like that than to
[1:07:03] follow this all of these other things
[1:07:06] that are constantly changing what I said
[1:07:10] I don't understand what could they
[1:07:12] convert me to you mean you're afraid to
[1:07:18] go down to a nuthouse and get the afraid
[1:07:21] they might convert you to the
[1:07:22] Trinitarian doctrine
[1:07:24] well they you don't even have much sense
[1:07:31] you're not afraid of being converted
[1:07:34] that away well what could they convert
[1:07:36] you in this message that gets me how
[1:07:38] could you stay with this message 30 40
[1:07:40] years swear by it and then turn and go
[1:07:44] somewhere to to what right what did you
[1:07:49] go to I never heard none of them explain
[1:07:51] what they went to they just found out
[1:07:53] how wrong he was well brother down here
[1:07:59] understand the truth was he's wrong
[1:08:03] well I've said it I don't mind saying it
[1:08:06] brother dick and I've talked about this
[1:08:07] for a long time he'd say it with me I
[1:08:10] don't care if they could come out and
[1:08:12] prove that brother Branham was the worst
[1:08:15] person never been a Hitler of
[1:08:17] Mussolini's and all of the things
[1:08:18] manifested in one man he led me to Jesus
[1:08:22] Christ
[1:08:25] I'll clap on that myself he led me to
[1:08:29] Jesus Christ he brought me to a place
[1:08:32] that God could speak my language that I
[1:08:35] could understand him that's what he is
[1:08:37] and it being in a person that I could
[1:08:40] follow him in love and understand the
[1:08:42] whole thing and not have to have all of
[1:08:44] these things you don't
[1:08:49] glory glory in the fact that he brought
[1:08:52] you to Christ so what I care what they
[1:08:56] want to say I'm kind of like to the
[1:09:04] little boys that put the food on the
[1:09:06] lady's porch and you know she come out
[1:09:09] hollered and glory hallelujah God's fed
[1:09:12] me a little boys one of them said hey
[1:09:14] lady he said God didn't give that to you
[1:09:17] said we brought it and put it on your
[1:09:19] porch
[1:09:20] she said glory hallelujah thank God for
[1:09:23] the food in the devil that Fox did right
[1:09:28] I could be happy about all things one
[1:09:33] because I know this message is right I
[1:09:35] don't have to worry about somebody
[1:09:37] coming into Lulla church and and doing
[1:09:40] it but you see I'm not allowed in the
[1:09:43] churches of this message that was
[1:09:46] settled a long time ago they won't allow
[1:09:50] me in it and these brothers that are
[1:09:52] going out now you watch them they're
[1:09:54] going to get less important they won't
[1:09:55] they're gonna be cut off too because
[1:09:58] they know where I stand and if they're
[1:09:59] gonna stand with me they're gonna get
[1:10:02] cut off I ain't worried about that I'm
[1:10:05] happy because you see I even tried to do
[1:10:09] that I ain't trying to be anything I've
[1:10:11] tried to turn everybody to the message
[1:10:15] what a wonderful message we've had do
[1:10:18] you understand what I'm saying
[1:10:19] it wouldn't matter how much that could
[1:10:21] prove brother Branham was wrongly what
[1:10:23] this is he led me to Jesus cry whole lot
[1:10:26] more than all of them over here with
[1:10:28] that great things that takes out the
[1:10:30] head
[1:10:31] they didn't lead me to Christ where
[1:10:36] could they be any contradictions in this
[1:10:38] message if it could lead you to Christ
[1:10:45] well you're just a silly old dude I
[1:10:47] agree we agree with your person but I'm
[1:10:52] still too human being and I've always
[1:10:54] been when I seen God promised in the
[1:11:00] word that he'd send a prophet most of
[1:11:06] you know my story I saw that before I
[1:11:09] come in this message I told my wife that
[1:11:14] they would according to Melek are in
[1:11:16] Malachi for that they'd be two prophets
[1:11:18] coming before the end of the world I
[1:11:20] never heard of the Prophet never heard
[1:11:23] of the message and I read the Bible and
[1:11:27] I believed it and I was a good Baptist
[1:11:32] that could read and I could understand
[1:11:34] Malachi for as to be the part of John
[1:11:37] the Baptist coming with me and Malachi 3
[1:11:39] you know the fulfillment I could
[1:11:41] understand that because I could read the
[1:11:43] word I could go to Luke and find out
[1:11:45] then he done this and he done that and
[1:11:46] how it was done I could understand that
[1:11:48] but I couldn't understand that monocot
[1:11:50] forward no but I believed it then
[1:11:53] brother mote begin to tell me a little
[1:11:55] about Malachi 4 I said okay what about
[1:11:58] this Melancon 3 who is he
[1:12:01] I thank God I didn't run into somebody
[1:12:03] you gotta believe I've had a man that
[1:12:08] could put me in the word and he put me
[1:12:11] right into the Bible and said the Bible
[1:12:13] said here's Luke 1:17 we'll see I
[1:12:16] already knew those scriptures I already
[1:12:19] knew those things I had read them I just
[1:12:23] needed that Malachi 4 to be put into C
[1:12:28] then when he told me he said look here's
[1:12:32] Elijah there's Elijah f1 into yours
[1:12:38] Melik aisle three John the Baptist
[1:12:42] said there's got to be a malachi for
[1:12:45] because one of those two witnesses to
[1:12:48] Israel cos Baptist we did read the word
[1:12:51] I knew there was to be two witnesses we
[1:12:54] used to argue that it was Moses and
[1:12:57] Enoch you heard brother Brennan talking
[1:13:00] about using acid a lot of people think
[1:13:01] it was Enoch he said no it was Elijah we
[1:13:04] argue to test what it was because the
[1:13:06] Enoch was translated he did not die we
[1:13:10] had scriptures in time but I couldn't do
[1:13:13] it with that say it was head knowledge
[1:13:16] but when he put this five over here in
[1:13:19] one two three back here I said well
[1:13:20] they've got to be a four somewhere now
[1:13:23] where's that act and this is what I told
[1:13:26] him I said brother you was there and you
[1:13:31] saw because he's seen the dead raised
[1:13:33] the sick healed and all kind of thing I
[1:13:35] said but I wasn't there I believe you he
[1:13:38] told me about Robert Tatum and I knew
[1:13:40] Robert item and the Tatum family they
[1:13:42] were marvelous people I knew him and I
[1:13:46] said that's all right but I said I can't
[1:13:48] take it what you saw I can't take I
[1:13:53] didn't see it but if you tell me what he
[1:13:56] taught in the Bible and I'll know
[1:13:59] whether or not he was a prophet thank
[1:14:01] God I run into the right man that could
[1:14:05] put it in the Bible and show me the
[1:14:08] promises of God through Malachi 4 Luke
[1:14:11] 17 30 revelation 10 7 and all of those
[1:14:13] sons it went down from a head knowledge
[1:14:22] to an understanding that I could see the
[1:14:26] word is being truth and that God had
[1:14:30] promised a people come on I could read
[1:14:36] the Bible where he promised Israel that
[1:14:38] they'd be done our 400 years right I
[1:14:42] could read the Bible of all the promises
[1:14:44] but I didn't read the Bible to
[1:14:46] understand God was promising things to
[1:14:48] me but when I saw that he said I send
[1:14:54] you Elijah the Prophet
[1:14:59] if the Bible was gonna be speaking to me
[1:15:01] that was me
[1:15:04] and that's why I've never had any
[1:15:06] problems in with all of these doctrines
[1:15:09] and ideas and so because of one time
[1:15:12] let's get into the message let's get in
[1:15:16] the Bible
[1:15:17] I didn't leave my Bible when I came in
[1:15:20] this message my Bible is still the Bible
[1:15:25] I still got a lot of writing in this
[1:15:27] problem I still love to read this novel
[1:15:30] because it's the Word of God right it's
[1:15:36] God's Word you and I right it is the
[1:15:40] knowledge of God meaning the
[1:15:44] understanding of God you know the
[1:15:46] reality there's a lot in here where
[1:15:49] brother Branham speaks of knowledge if
[1:15:50] you want it you can have it what you
[1:15:53] ought to understand one time
[1:15:54] it can't be knowledge that puffs us up
[1:15:58] it can't be just knowledge of you know
[1:16:03] some life or man it has to be Christ in
[1:16:09] the word amen
[1:16:12] let's stand together we have the
[1:16:16] communion we'll go right into it
[1:16:23] take the communion I pray you'll just go
[1:16:27] home and think let's see no matter what
[1:16:32] everybody says I've gotten my point at
[1:16:35] one time this message and the Bible are
[1:16:39] one I solved with me I don't have to
[1:16:46] worry about it head knowledge won't keep
[1:16:51] you there head knowledge will find
[1:16:53] contradictions and probably but heaven
[1:16:57] more knowledge won't turn you from the
[1:17:01] word right it'll turn you to the work I
[1:17:05] pray you'll think on these things Lord
[1:17:09] as we go into this part of the communion
[1:17:10] we we've tried to explain today one
[1:17:14] thing that we've had on our heart that
[1:17:18] you brought your word and you've given
[1:17:25] it into our hands and left it with us to
[1:17:29] be able to study what the prophet has
[1:17:33] brought unto us and what all the
[1:17:37] prophets brought what all the writers of
[1:17:39] the word broke they brought a revelation
[1:17:43] of you Lord to us how much greater could
[1:17:48] we want anything to be than to have that
[1:17:51] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] could be an Almighty God the great I am
[1:18:01] and just help us to understand I know I
[1:18:05] sound funny in art and the way I try to
[1:18:07] express it but I don't have no other
[1:18:10] ability Lord I just try to talk about
[1:18:16] what you've made known to me because in
[1:18:20] that then I know something personal and
[1:18:24] I can try to talk about what's
[1:18:27] personally been revealed but you just
[1:18:30] have your way with all of us forgive our
[1:18:32] sins forgive our attitudes in ways I
[1:18:34] know I hollered and scream
[1:18:36] Lord just have your way and goddess and
[1:18:47] take us into these things that you
[1:18:49] promised to add unto us because there in
[1:18:53] the words it says add to your faith then
[1:18:55] that is a promise all we got to do is
[1:18:58] believe you and you'll take care of it
[1:19:00] as we're going to the communion you
[1:19:02] bless and guide each one of us in Jesus
[1:19:14] I've received of the Lord that which
[1:19:17] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:19:20] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:19:24] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:19:27] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:19:31] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:35] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:19:39] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:19:44] had supped saying this cup is the New
[1:19:46] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:19:49] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:19:57] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:19:59] this cup you do chew of the Lord's death
[1:20:04] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:20:07] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:20:09] Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the
[1:20:11] body and blood of the Lord so let a man
[1:20:14] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:20:17] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:20:19] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:20:20] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:20:23] not discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:20:26] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:20:28] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:20:30] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:20:33] when we are judged thank you Lord for
[1:20:35] this then when we are judged we are
[1:20:38] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:20:40] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:20:42] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:20:44] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:20:46] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:20:49] not together unto condemnation and the
[1:20:52] rest what I said in order when I come
[1:20:58] great man had a great understanding and
[1:21:03] God revealed to him why didn't God
[1:21:06] choose one of the disciples that had
[1:21:08] walked with it didn't do any chores Paul
[1:21:11] to explain the communion because Paul
[1:21:15] could understand it he could put it in
[1:21:16] the Old Testament go through all of
[1:21:18] those things that they went through the
[1:21:22] rituals and things that they went
[1:21:23] through he could see all of that and how
[1:21:25] it tied to
[1:21:27] so he was chosen to write it some
[1:21:31] personal to him right think on these
[1:21:34] things it says they take they had they
[1:21:38] prayed so let's just have a few moments
[1:21:40] of prior and just wait upon the Lord
[1:21:43] praying one for the other the Lord would
[1:21:45] bless us all and bring us to the right
[1:21:47] place in him
[1:22:00] mother thank you for your word that
[1:22:02] you've given unto us and to show us Lord
[1:22:05] yourself and what you are that you
[1:22:07] reveal here to the Apostle Paul and he
[1:22:09] wrote it down and told us about it and
[1:22:12] then it is speaking to us about the
[1:22:15] communion he was explaining to us all
[1:22:18] about you in your ways we love you and
[1:22:21] we thank you we ask you now you just
[1:22:23] bless each one we pray one for another
[1:22:26] that you would bless us all together in
[1:22:28] you just give us of your understanding
[1:22:31] of your love and grace forgive our sins
[1:22:33] cleanse us and keep us guide us in Jesus
[1:22:37] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:22:44] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:22:47] bread that's been made for this purpose
[1:22:48] this afternoon and we just break it as
[1:22:52] an honor to you and your body
[1:22:54] that was broken for each one of us the
[1:22:57] Lord help us to have a understanding of
[1:22:59] you and to what it's all about
[1:23:02] bless the food and the sanctify you and
[1:23:04] the partakers in Jesus name
[1:23:19] how wonderful it is to know truth just
[1:23:26] to even this little bit of the communion
[1:23:27] and what it's about that it's not the
[1:23:30] body it's not the blood it's not this it
[1:23:32] only represents that that's wonderful
[1:23:35] do you realize the biggest portion of
[1:23:38] the world today is taking this but yet
[1:23:45] not understanding making it all kind of
[1:23:48] things the literal body the literal this
[1:23:50] or whatever and then the others that
[1:23:52] don't understand anything about it yet
[1:23:58] God has revealed it to you and I the
[1:24:02] endtime people what this is all about
[1:24:06] thank God for the truth
[1:24:15] other we thank you for this wine it's
[1:24:17] made for this purpose this afternoon and
[1:24:19] it represents your blood that was shed
[1:24:23] for each and every one of us we drank we
[1:24:25] eat the little piece of bread we drank
[1:24:27] the wine and it creates blood cells
[1:24:29] literally in our body and how much more
[1:24:32] is the spiritual than our soul to
[1:24:34] understand your word your manifestation
[1:24:37] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:24:39] name come morning
