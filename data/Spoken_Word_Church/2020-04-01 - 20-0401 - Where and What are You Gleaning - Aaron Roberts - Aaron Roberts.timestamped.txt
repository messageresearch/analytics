[2:39] you're still with us so I'm okay
[2:43] everything everything's telling all
[2:45] right so well god bless you tonight
[2:48] we're gonna look into the scripture and
[2:51] wonder as brother Terrence was saying
[2:56] there's many that have needs and many
[3:00] sick this is from sister Barbara says
[3:09] her niece in Denver is quarantined at
[3:12] home and caring for her disabled
[3:14] father-in-law two daughters and a
[3:17] grandchild so y'all just remember old
[3:19] them out there I know that's that's the
[3:22] rough you know I don't know if anybody
[3:26] has said but I do want to say thanks for
[3:29] my mom and she's you know if you don't
[3:35] know my dad's at home now and you know
[3:37] that's all that's a big order for
[3:39] anybody and taking care of you know home
[3:42] health and everything is coming in but
[3:44] mainly most of it falls on mom and my
[3:46] sisters and I know mom appreciates the
[3:49] prayers but just continue to pray for
[3:52] the
[3:52] and dad has you know there's a
[3:55] transition thing going on but there's
[3:57] also a lot of some medical issues going
[3:59] on too and you know we just trust the
[4:02] Lord and just continue to believe that
[4:05] the Lord will do what he started and you
[4:08] know he shouldn't be here with us and
[4:10] you know I think sometimes you know we
[4:13] get we look at the wrong things but you
[4:15] know you think about my mom shouldn't be
[4:17] here with us either I mean you know they
[4:19] you know the doctors told my dad you
[4:21] know you need to make her funeral
[4:22] arrangements while she's still here with
[4:24] us so you know he's the same yesterday
[4:26] today and forever
[4:27] I know mom wants to thank everybody and
[4:30] and all of y'all for praying and y'all
[4:32] just continue to remember them and I
[4:37] think brother Ike LaFontaine I think
[4:42] they said that he had the virus and
[4:45] that's brother Paul brother and so we
[4:49] just don't remember him and and I don't
[4:52] know I know there's others that they had
[4:53] mentioned some overseas whatever really
[5:00] okay the comb donor path so let's
[5:03] remember the family there but many other
[5:06] ones and you know I want to pray for all
[5:09] the like my wife and all the ones that
[5:11] go to work everyday that you know the
[5:14] ones that are fighting this and you know
[5:15] it's a that's a big order that you know
[5:17] they have to go into that and I think
[5:19] about sister Ruth and sister Amy and all
[5:21] the different ones that you know you
[5:23] they go and all the doctors and the
[5:24] different ones that are having to you
[5:26] know fight that cell but you know God is
[5:29] a healer God's a comforter God's in
[5:33] control and so I just want to thank the
[5:36] Lord for that and thank for us being
[5:39] healthy and also remember remember Levi
[5:43] also leave us had a sinus infection and
[5:46] they put him on some medicine and he
[5:47] don't seem like he's getting any better
[5:49] but it's just all sinus stuff and you
[5:51] know nowadays this time of the year with
[5:54] the with the sinus infection you know
[5:56] people just start freaking out now
[5:58] because if you sneeze people start
[5:59] getting worried it's like well it's
[6:01] allergies I mean you know but that's
[6:04] just the time of season that we're
[6:05] living
[6:06] but you know we just know that the Lord
[6:09] said is angels would be about us protect
[6:11] us you know we just do what we ought to
[6:14] wash your hands and you know Paul said
[6:20] to leave Paul said to greet each other
[6:22] with a holy kiss and now which now it's
[6:25] been regulated to give everybody the
[6:28] holy wave so we're just gonna wave at
[6:30] you you know but try to try to follow
[6:33] the rules about all of that just staying
[6:35] away from you know everybody and you
[6:38] know remembering what you might carry it
[6:42] you know some people are not mindful of
[6:44] that you know you may not get sick but
[6:46] that doesn't mean that you don't spread
[6:47] it to somebody else that will not be
[6:48] able to fight it to be able to get sick
[6:51] so you know just like any other you know
[6:53] the flu or any other type of virus that
[6:55] that can be passed from one to the other
[6:57] so we just want to remember all of them
[6:59] but thank the Lord that we're here
[7:01] tonight and we're gonna look right into
[7:02] the scripture and you know just pray for
[7:05] me and we're gonna look you here in the
[7:07] Book of Ruth and look in the first
[7:11] chapter of Ruth here and I'm going to
[7:14] speak a little bit about gleaning and
[7:18] you know I was I heard somebody say
[7:21] something to you the other day and you
[7:24] know I just end up getting this little
[7:27] thought that I will want to speak on
[7:29] tonight about let's go where and what
[7:33] are you gleaning and you know what you
[7:36] glean where you're gleaning is what
[7:39] determines what you're gleaning and so
[7:41] you know you know determining what we're
[7:45] listening to what we're feeding on and
[7:47] and those type things and you know it
[7:52] you know it does it you know and in
[7:58] certain instances and without trying to
[8:01] get into too much but in certain
[8:03] instance we have people that they get
[8:06] into this situation where you know they
[8:09] either think that they can get it all
[8:14] themselves and they don't need any help
[8:15] or the it's they have this Catholic
[8:19] mentality
[8:19] we're just gonna look to a person that
[8:23] we're gonna get everything that we need
[8:24] from them and you know they're you know
[8:27] you have to strike a balance and all on
[8:29] that but you know I just wanted
[8:32] something I want to look at tonight and
[8:34] bring it from the scripture but let's
[8:37] just all bow our heads and we'll I'll
[8:38] speak to the father heavily father Lord

[10:29] amen amen
[10:32] Ruth chapter
[10:33] one they're gonna forget at verse 12 and
[10:38] save a little bit of reading here but
[10:40] most everybody kind of knows the story
[10:43] so you know this is Naomi and she says
[10:49] turn again my daughters go your way for
[10:51] I am too old to have a husband and if I
[10:54] should say I have hope if I should have
[10:57] a husband also tonight and should also
[10:59] bear sons would you tarry for them till
[11:01] they were grown would you stay for them
[11:04] from having husband's name my daughters
[11:06] for a grievous me much for your six that
[11:10] the hand of the Lord has gone out
[11:12] against me and they lifted up their
[11:13] voice and wept again and Orpah kissed
[11:15] her mother-in-law but Ruth cleave unto
[11:18] her and she said behold thy
[11:20] sister-in-law was going back under her
[11:22] people and unto her God's return thou
[11:25] after thy sister-in-law Andrew said
[11:27] entreat me not to leave thee nor to
[11:30] return from following after thee for
[11:32] whither thou goest I will go and whether
[11:34] thou lodgest I will Lodge the people
[11:36] shall be my people and thy God my God
[11:39] where thou diced I will die and there
[11:42] will I be buried the Lord do so to me
[11:45] and more also if I out but death part
[11:47] thee and me when she saw that she was
[11:50] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[11:53] she left speaking unto her so they went
[11:58] they too went and they too went until
[12:03] they came to Bethlehem and it came to
[12:06] pass that when they were come to
[12:08] Bethlehem that all the city was moved
[12:10] about them and they said is this not as
[12:13] this Naomi and she said unto them call
[12:16] me not Naomi call me Mara for the
[12:19] almighty hath dealt very bitterly with
[12:21] me said I went out full and the Lord
[12:25] hath brought me home again empty and
[12:28] then call he meet Naomi singing the Lord
[12:30] hath testified against me and the
[12:33] almighty hath afflicted me so Naomi
[12:35] returned and Ruth with the mobis her
[12:39] daughter-in-law with her which returned
[12:40] out of the country of Moab and they came
[12:43] to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[12:45] harvest
[12:46] amen god bless you may be seated some
[12:51] docto most everybody is familiar with
[12:56] the scripture but you know well when
[13:03] there was a there was a famine that came
[13:05] in the land and Naomi's husband
[13:10] Elimelech and their two sons you know
[13:15] they wanted to go where the the famine
[13:19] wasn't where they had a thought they'd
[13:21] have a better life and you know they
[13:23] decided to go into Moab but you know
[13:26] there's no you can't go outside the
[13:29] place that you're supposed to be and you
[13:31] know you know the homeland is where they
[13:33] where the children of Israel were
[13:35] blessed and you couldn't go outside that
[13:36] and be blessed and and you know they
[13:39] went out there and you know there was
[13:41] there they were there I think around
[13:44] like 10 years and you know we know that
[13:47] Naomi lost her husband and she lost her
[13:50] two sons and you know all these things
[13:52] happen to her and then you know when all
[13:55] these things that happen and you know
[13:57] all this affliction that came upon her
[13:59] then she decided you know what I'm gonna
[14:01] go back to the homeland and you know
[14:03] lots of times those things happen to us
[14:05] so God wants us to be in a certain place
[14:07] well if we decide we want to go out well
[14:09] then you know these things happen to
[14:11] come our way that we get afflicted with
[14:13] things and you know hard times come our
[14:15] way and things go wrong in that but you
[14:18] know God is leading us back to where he
[14:19] wants us to be and you know there's a
[14:21] place for us to be and you know God sent
[14:24] them back and then she went in but you
[14:26] know she was so tore up about what had
[14:29] happened and you know she could just see
[14:31] her situation but you know and all of
[14:34] this you know there was something about
[14:36] Naomi there must have been something
[14:38] about her that Ruth saw something in her
[14:41] you know and you know when she saw her
[14:43] but you know she she had seen something
[14:45] and all that that she didn't want to
[14:47] leave Naomi she wanted to follow her you
[14:50] know there was something that drew her
[14:51] to the earth and she wanted she didn't
[14:53] want to leave her and you know brother
[14:56] Branham says in and the
[14:59] the message and inside and he's speaking
[15:03] of of Ruth he says and notice the inside
[15:06] was lifted up beautiful picture and Ruth
[15:08] and he said maybe you think you're
[15:12] eating meat Ruth as maybe a little love
[15:14] story in the Bible which it is oh what a
[15:16] beautiful story of representing Christ
[15:18] in His Church how Naomi went back over
[15:20] into the land of Moab there her husband
[15:22] died or husband or two sons died leaving
[15:24] widows on the way back the beautiful
[15:27] picture Ruth listen ruth the moabite a
[15:29] Gentile carried away with dumb idols
[15:32] like we were and when it came time Naomi
[15:35] kissed her and said go back to your
[15:36] people and with your people I'll go
[15:38] alone but she said let your people be my
[15:41] people let your life where let me live
[15:44] where you live let me die where you die
[15:46] let me be buried where you are buried
[15:48] and let your God be my god beautiful
[15:51] picture of the young Gentile church
[15:52] coming and by the old Jewish Church the
[15:55] Jews had packed the gospel first he said
[15:58] oh how marvelous so we know that the you
[16:02] know that is the type of truth the word
[16:05] being brought to the Gentiles but you
[16:07] know she went back and followed her but
[16:10] you know it was something that was
[16:11] drawing her back and we know the brother
[16:13] Bram talked about you know it was the
[16:14] Holy Ghost bringing Ruth to the place
[16:17] that she ought to be you know there was
[16:19] a there was a place that God had for her
[16:21] and God was bringing her to that place
[16:24] that you know and you know so as she was
[16:26] being she was coming into the place
[16:28] where she ought to be and your Naomi
[16:31] came back but you know Ruth had had a
[16:34] great love for Naomi and to see there
[16:38] was you know that she said where your
[16:39] your God I want that God to be my god I
[16:43] wherever you believe I can there was
[16:45] something that it was about her that she
[16:46] wanted to follow the same thing and so
[16:50] when she went and I came back into the
[16:53] homeland she said you know she was there
[16:57] and coming back and you know here is
[17:02] here's a type of the believer coming
[17:04] back because we know through history
[17:07] that as says the Jews carried the gospel
[17:10] to the end of the Gentiles and you know
[17:12] here they are
[17:12] receiving salvation and you know that's
[17:15] the first thing that you have to do
[17:17] because you know there's the four steps
[17:18] in or the four areas of Ruth's journey
[17:22] that we look at you know the first one
[17:24] is her making a decision you know and so
[17:28] you know she has to make that decision
[17:29] and you know we all have to make that
[17:31] decision you know there comes a time
[17:33] where all of us have to make a decision
[17:34] what we want to do and you know those a
[17:39] man years ago as a man that was her
[17:42] brother was speaking and he was talking
[17:44] about you know the the things in life
[17:47] sometimes aren't big decisions and he he
[17:50] was preaching about you know Gary Cooper
[17:52] and the movie High Noon and you know he
[17:55] you're building up to this great
[17:56] crescendo this great gunfight you know
[18:00] and it's just and it just keeps building
[18:02] and building and building and and he
[18:04] said sometimes you know it doesn't come
[18:05] that way sometimes there's just slight
[18:08] things that come along our way and we
[18:11] don't take time to we may think it's
[18:13] just a minor decision that has to be
[18:15] made but sometimes we don't pay
[18:17] attention that you know that's actually
[18:18] a major decision and sometimes we don't
[18:20] pay attention that you know we we can
[18:22] overstep God's bounds or we can overstep
[18:25] the holy ghost' speaking to us because
[18:27] we don't realize that it's such a major
[18:29] event and sometimes we look back and
[18:31] it's like well you know you know I was I
[18:33] didn't listen to God all right you know
[18:35] I didn't pay attention well that's the
[18:36] reason sometimes it pays for us to take
[18:39] every decision that we make and try not
[18:41] to make our own decisions but take it
[18:43] back to God and let him lead us and say
[18:46] you know all our decisions you know we
[18:48] try to make them in ourselves well
[18:49] sometimes we make the wrong decision and
[18:52] the problem is is God's trying to speak
[18:53] to us don't let us make you know to let
[18:56] him make the decision to tell us what we
[18:58] need to do you know he wants to lead and
[19:00] guide us he said you know if we seek the
[19:03] kingdom of God first he said that all
[19:04] these other things will be added to us
[19:06] so if we just seek God and let him lead
[19:09] us because we know if we're just like
[19:12] sheep then we have to have a leader we
[19:14] have to have a shepherd we have to be
[19:16] led so that's what we need we need
[19:18] somebody to lead us through these things
[19:20] and you know so I don't want to try to
[19:22] make any decisions on my own or think
[19:24] that I'm smart enough to lay
[19:25] myself because I know I'm not I know I
[19:28] can't make any decisions I can't I can't
[19:30] make this journey alone I have to have
[19:32] somebody to lead me and guide me and
[19:35] carry me through and that's what he said
[19:37] that he would do so you know what I just
[19:38] want to rest on him I just want to I
[19:42] just want to put my confidence in him
[19:43] and you know even in these dark times
[19:45] and and the way things are going and and
[19:48] the economy and you know the sickness
[19:50] and different things like that you I'm
[19:52] so glad that when I wake up in the
[19:53] morning I can confess what the Bible
[19:56] says you know if I look at my situation
[19:59] sometimes you know we can get little
[20:01] discouraged we can get down but you know
[20:03] what I go right back to the scripture
[20:05] and know that he's in control and you
[20:07] know I can put my confidence in him and
[20:09] I can go to him for what I have needeth
[20:11] because I want I just you know I just
[20:14] want to live the life that he has called
[20:15] me to live and you know what he's called
[20:17] us to live a life of overcoming he wants
[20:20] us to be happy and free and we don't
[20:22] have to be bound and and worried and
[20:24] confused about things why because we
[20:27] have the ability to walk in the light of
[20:29] the word in the in the fullness of the
[20:31] word and your we have we have can over
[20:33] raise our hands and be joyous and happy
[20:35] and and praise God because of what he
[20:37] has done for us and not worry about the
[20:39] world and how things are going and you
[20:41] know people are you know people are
[20:43] getting all constrast about things and
[20:47] you know you see people nowadays they're
[20:49] people are all into things like what is
[20:53] it the Preppers and and you know all
[20:55] these different things that people want
[20:56] to do everybody's trying to prepare for
[21:00] your pocalypse and the end of the world
[21:02] and you know everything going wrong and
[21:04] you know like years ago everybody wanted
[21:07] to be able to underground shelter and
[21:09] you know everybody's gonna learn how to
[21:10] live off the land and you know
[21:12] everybody's gonna buy up all the
[21:13] ammunition and all the guns and
[21:14] everybody wants to learn how to be Rambo
[21:16] and all this kind of stuff you know
[21:18] because everybody's got to have
[21:19] something that's got to fill this need
[21:22] because there's such stress and anxiety
[21:25] that build-up with people because they
[21:26] don't know where to stand but you know
[21:29] if you can come to the place that you
[21:30] can stand in the rest in God you know
[21:33] then you don't have to worry about
[21:34] tomorrow
[21:35] but you know the thing is is if we come
[21:37] to that place you know God didn't tell
[21:38] us that we couldn't store up a little
[21:41] food or you know or do these calm things
[21:43] I mean that's a smart thing to do have a
[21:45] little money set aside for all these
[21:47] different things but you know what to
[21:49] the place that you know you know what
[21:50] storing up rolls and rolls of hand
[21:52] sanitizer and a hundred rolls of toilet
[21:54] paper ain't gonna help people it won't
[21:58] do anything for you but you know some
[22:01] people they have to feel like they're in
[22:02] control of something so you know they
[22:05] they ever I well you know what they got
[22:06] to buy up all this stuff and you know
[22:08] they sit on all this stuff and they
[22:10] think well you know I've got all this
[22:11] and you know yeah that's you know that's
[22:14] um how this is going to make give me
[22:15] comfort but you know what it doesn't do
[22:19] you any good it won't change anything so
[22:28] Ruth here and they only coming into the
[22:33] land the place where she had to leave
[22:38] all these things behind her you know
[22:42] this is this is all a life that Ruth had
[22:45] ever known you know she was this was the
[22:49] land of her her birth her family
[22:52] everything that she had known was right
[22:53] there but you know what she had to get
[22:56] up and make that decision if she's gonna
[22:57] leave all of that behind and go to a
[23:00] place you've never been before to see
[23:02] people she didn't know anything about
[23:03] you know brother Brown said at one time
[23:06] he was talking about Ruth's going into a
[23:08] land and you know she was going to a
[23:11] land that you know she didn't fit in and
[23:15] you know she was kind of made fun of
[23:16] because of being a Moabite a you know
[23:19] because the motorbike was an outcast I
[23:21] mean that was a type of person that you
[23:23] know the Israelites didn't more really
[23:26] associate with and here she is coming
[23:29] back into this land you know she had to
[23:32] give up all of that but she wanted to
[23:33] come into a place that that she didn't
[23:37] want to leave Naomi she wanted to come
[23:39] to this place because something that had
[23:41] you know and I'm sure that she had been
[23:43] told about that you know about these
[23:44] things so she wanted to go to this land
[23:46] that that held something
[23:48] was more than what she had him and mo
[23:50] lab and you know here she is going into
[23:53] this land and that she's traveling and
[23:55] and they come in and we know it come
[23:58] they come in at the in the barley season
[24:00] which is uh and you know Pentecost and
[24:04] you know brother Brown said you know
[24:05] that is Pentecost when because that's
[24:08] when the Gentiles Church came in was it
[24:10] was at Pentecost and and here they come
[24:13] in and when she gets there you know
[24:16] Naomi Desai you know she tells her Ruth
[24:20] tells Naomi you know I want to go work
[24:22] in the field you know and and the
[24:26] scripture says you know that she just
[24:27] kind of like happened into the field
[24:29] where they were that she would gather
[24:31] and take care of because you know Naomi
[24:34] yeah I'm sure she was getting up in age
[24:36] and everything but you know she wanted
[24:38] to take care of her mother lawn she's
[24:39] you know I'm gonna gather food from us
[24:42] and you know because that was a type of
[24:44] the of the law there the you know that
[24:47] you could dig and when they made the
[24:49] harvest then you know the rest was open
[24:51] for everybody to come and take you know
[24:54] the poor and everything could take part
[24:56] of it and so you know here she is
[24:57] gathering out of the field and you know
[24:59] and you know she's just gathering and as
[25:03] she's gathering you know you know she's
[25:07] gathering in and as she comes through
[25:10] there you know the Bible says that you
[25:13] know that she would just kind of happen
[25:14] into Boaz is filled but brother Ram said
[25:20] you know the Holy Ghost was leading her
[25:22] the whole time that led her into the
[25:23] fieldwork she ought to be you know and
[25:25] she was digging and she was gathering up
[25:28] out of the field and you know as you see
[25:31] that she's out there gathering up for
[25:33] the harvest and picking up what was left
[25:35] and you know in the midst of all that
[25:37] time here come Boaz to her and began to
[25:40] speak to her and you know because he
[25:42] first asked you know who is this who is
[25:44] this damsel this maiden in the field and
[25:46] they said well that's the Moabite woman
[25:48] that came back was Naomi you know it was
[25:51] something that struck Boaz that when he
[25:53] saw her in the field that what she was
[25:55] doing you know then he began to expound
[25:58] when he began to expound the roof you
[25:59] know he said I under
[26:00] staying what kind of person you are
[26:02] because you've taken care of your
[26:03] mother-in-law you know even even when
[26:05] you you could have went back and you
[26:07] could have went away but you are still
[26:09] here in a foreign land and all these
[26:11] different things and facing this
[26:13] ridicule and different things and here
[26:15] you are taking care of your
[26:17] mother-in-law and you know then when
[26:19] when Boaz comes Torre says you know
[26:21] don't you worry about anything but he
[26:23] said I want you to stay in my field he
[26:26] said this is where I want you to stay
[26:27] and he said he said as the Reapers go
[26:30] along he said I want you to gather with
[26:32] the Reapers he said I want you to stay
[26:34] with the maidens that are in the field
[26:35] and said you make yourself at home here
[26:37] in this field you know you don't have to
[26:40] go anywhere he said he said when you get
[26:42] thirsty you go drink the water that the
[26:43] young men have drawn and he said you
[26:45] stay right here
[26:46] and he said you stay here and gather
[26:48] until the harvest is over with you just
[26:50] continue to stay right where you're at
[26:52] and he said you know he said I've
[26:54] command the men not to bother you you
[26:57] just to go wherever you want to and then
[26:59] Boaz tells the Reapers and he tells the
[27:01] young men he said you don't let her you
[27:02] know you don't worry about where she
[27:04] goes she can go among the sheaves and
[27:06] she can gather and he said and you drop
[27:07] handfuls of purpose on the ground and
[27:09] she can gather that and you just let her
[27:11] go wherever she wants to and he says if
[27:13] you get hungry he said used to go and
[27:15] eat and you know he said that even gives
[27:17] her a quart and all these type things
[27:19] and lets her do what she wants and
[27:21] everything in this in this whole place
[27:23] and then you know here's now here's Ruth
[27:26] and then she you know she falls on the
[27:28] ground and she says you know how did I
[27:29] how did I become so in such favor with
[27:33] you the being that I'm a stranger in
[27:35] this land you know and he said because
[27:37] of what you've done and he said what
[27:39] you've seen him because what we've seen
[27:42] of you he said I want you to be here and
[27:43] I want you to take care of these things
[27:45] he said I want you to be taken care of
[27:47] and you know it's just you know and so
[27:50] we know this we know how the story is
[27:52] laid out but you know I won't look at a
[27:55] few things because you know it takes it
[27:58] takes you and I we can't just rely on
[28:01] just one person or or you know waiting
[28:05] on the fivefold ministry or or you know
[28:07] we can't just stand there and say well
[28:08] you know I'm
[28:10] get it all myself I don't I don't need
[28:12] anybody I'm just gonna you know listen
[28:15] to tapes or whatever you know I just get
[28:17] it all myself and you know years ago I
[28:19] heard a man say that the reason he
[28:21] didn't go to church was because it he
[28:24] said what Christ is outside the church
[28:26] and he said he said I'm on the outside
[28:28] with him he said I'm on the outside too
[28:31] because you know God he said Christ is
[28:33] outside the church they put him out he
[28:34] said I don't go to church either and he
[28:37] and a brother you know he said well you
[28:39] know he said he was knocking he was on
[28:41] the outside but he was knocking trying
[28:42] to get back in he said I don't see you
[28:44] trying to knock trying to get back in
[28:49] but you know everybody's got their own
[28:51] their own ideas about how things ought
[28:54] to be you know they want to pick and
[28:56] choose their own own scriptures but you
[28:59] know you know the thing is is but God
[29:00] has given us a place to be and you know
[29:04] it is the word and you know that's a
[29:07] brother and said that was a type of the
[29:09] word was that field and drawing the life
[29:12] out of that field he said it was eternal
[29:15] life coming out of that field and that's
[29:16] what he said that's what the Reapers
[29:18] were laying before Ruth for her to
[29:20] gather as she didn't have to go some
[29:22] other place but she could be right where
[29:24] she was that him that the Holy Ghost had
[29:27] led her to this place and you know
[29:29] brothers sisters if in your journey you
[29:31] know the Holy Ghost is what leads you to
[29:33] wherever you go it takes the Holy Ghost
[29:36] to lead you you know because you know
[29:38] it's the grace of God that calls us to
[29:41] repent it said you know we don't call
[29:43] ourselves we don't go seeking God but
[29:45] it's God seeking us but God brings us to
[29:48] a place that God wants us to show where
[29:50] we need to be and God has placed us in a
[29:52] place so we can feed on the word you
[29:55] know and so wherever you worry you go it
[29:58] has to be in the word where do where's
[30:00] where does the believers gather where
[30:03] does the Eagles gather they gather with
[30:05] the word together in the word together
[30:06] where the carcass see us so that's where
[30:09] we have to be but God has placed us in a
[30:11] place that we can feed on the word but
[30:14] the thing is is one thing it takes place
[30:15] that you and I must dig in the word it
[30:18] takes it takes laboring in the word
[30:21] you know as you know they were laying
[30:23] handfuls of purpose there in the field
[30:26] for Ruth but you know what she had to go
[30:28] out there and she had to get out and had
[30:31] to pick it up she had to gather it it
[30:32] wasn't that it was just somebody give it
[30:34] to her but she had to be in the field
[30:36] digging for herself and gathering for
[30:38] herself you know and so when those
[30:41] things come to be he laid out a balance
[30:44] left this thing open and made an
[30:46] invitation for her to have a half free
[30:49] reign and all these things so you know
[30:50] the word has been open to your us and
[30:53] we've been given an invitation to get
[30:55] into the word and dig and you know the
[30:56] thing is is not just just reading about
[30:59] it or waiting for somebody else to bring
[31:00] it to us but you know what those Reapers
[31:02] so those angels that are there in in the
[31:05] scripture that are coming forth bringing
[31:06] the word and he said how about the
[31:09] angels that have come tonight in this
[31:10] building or wherever you are listening
[31:13] to the world the word that he's come to
[31:15] bring you the word do for you to bring
[31:17] you whatever you have need of those
[31:19] angels are there to minister to you so
[31:22] if you're standing here tonight or
[31:24] sitting at home wherever you may be and
[31:25] you have a need then you know what you
[31:27] just wait on those angels to bring you
[31:29] what you have negative sometimes I think
[31:36] you know we don't realize what condition
[31:39] that we're in what what takes place when
[31:42] we gather where two or three are
[31:43] gathered in my name and you know what it
[31:47] doesn't matter that that you may be a
[31:48] hundred miles away you know what if you
[31:50] gather in his name then it doesn't
[31:52] matter what the geographical location is
[31:54] so if you're at home and you're
[31:56] listening in tonight if you're gathered
[31:58] in his name that it doesn't matter
[32:00] there's only a handful here that doesn't
[32:02] matter that's whoever has gathered
[32:04] together with him there's work you know
[32:07] that's binding together that we gather
[32:09] together in the work then he can come
[32:11] and speak and you can receive what you
[32:13] have need of oh if we could just open
[32:20] our eyes sometimes well
[32:23] open our spiritual eyesight man I tell
[32:27] you what you know brother Bram said you
[32:29] know he never wanted to leave that
[32:31] dimension he said on when he got into
[32:33] that dimension he said how much you know
[32:35] you never want to leave and he said when
[32:36] you're down here and in the in just your
[32:39] normal life and everything he said
[32:41] that's one thing but he said when you
[32:42] get into that other realm he said oh he
[32:44] said it's so wonderful to be in heavenly
[32:46] places in Christ Jesus and you never
[32:48] want to leave it and to know that he's
[32:51] there with us and you know he wants us
[32:54] to be with him and you know you know if
[32:57] we can just you know we have it well our
[33:00] lives and things that go and you know we
[33:03] just have to do things but you know if
[33:06] we can ever get to that place where we
[33:07] can always be mindful of him and you
[33:10] know the the story always like is where
[33:12] General Jackson was talking about he was
[33:16] the man that wrote him a letter was
[33:19] asking he said you know that scripture
[33:21] in the Bible where it says pray without
[33:22] ceasing he said you know I find that so
[33:24] hard to live that you know he just had I
[33:28] just don't understand that and you know
[33:29] General Jackson wrote him back and he
[33:31] said oh brother he said listen he said
[33:33] it's so wonderful he said I don't he
[33:35] said everything that I do he said he
[33:37] said I don't even open my mouth to take
[33:39] a drink of water and he said unless I
[33:40] give thanks for it he said I don't open
[33:42] a letter he said unless I pray to God
[33:45] before I opened the letter to prepare me
[33:48] for the contents he said I don't drop a
[33:49] letter in the mailbox
[33:51] he said that I don't pray for the
[33:53] recipient of this letter he said I don't
[33:55] he said when I couldn't make tote at
[33:57] Virginia Military Institute he said
[33:59] before I go before the cadets he said I
[34:01] pray for them that that God will help
[34:03] them he said that I can be the kind of
[34:05] instructor to them but they can receive
[34:08] what they have need of and he said oh
[34:11] well he said he said it's so heed he
[34:13] said he said as much as he said this is
[34:16] you were going to take a drink of water
[34:17] he said you automatically open your
[34:19] mouth he said your mouth will
[34:22] automatically open you don't have to
[34:23] think about it it automatically he'll
[34:24] open he said that's how instant it is
[34:26] for him to pray he said that he said am
[34:30] I so and grainy and he said he said I
[34:32] can't he suggested opening his mouth
[34:34] that he almost unconscious
[34:36] stop he said I'm praying to God and
[34:38] thanking him for the water and so you
[34:40] know many times if we can get to that
[34:41] place where you know that we can thank
[34:43] God for everything that we see and
[34:45] everything that goes on and we can talk
[34:47] to the Lord and one because he's right
[34:48] there but sometimes we walk right past
[34:50] him or we don't even pay attention that
[34:53] he's there with us until we need him or
[34:55] you know sometimes it's way in maybe
[34:57] late in the day or or whatever you know
[34:59] sometimes we get tied up with things at
[35:01] work you know and so sometimes we miss
[35:03] God that he's right there with us you
[35:06] know and he's such a gentleman that he
[35:08] stands there waiting for us to make time
[35:09] for him and you know it's like you know
[35:11] Lord I wish I could talk to you is like
[35:14] well you know I've been waiting on you
[35:15] I've been right here all day waiting on
[35:16] you just for you to open up so you can
[35:18] speak to so I can speak back to you
[35:22] you know sometimes if we just sit still
[35:24] and say Lord what would you have me to
[35:26] know what would you like to say to me
[35:32] because you know prayers prayers not
[35:36] just talking prayers listening you know
[35:40] prayers communion and so it takes
[35:42] communion that's two-way travel that's
[35:46] two-way communication so you know you
[35:49] know many times people want to sit down
[35:50] and they want to pray well I'm gonna
[35:51] pray for 45 minutes well you need to
[35:53] spend another 45 minutes just waiting to
[35:55] see if the Lord's got something to say
[35:56] to you because sometimes people you know
[36:00] they just won't do all the talking and
[36:02] and you know they they they're concerned
[36:04] about how things going we oughta we
[36:06] ought to have a plan and know how things
[36:08] gonna go and Lord we all you know it all
[36:10] go this way or that way it's like you
[36:12] know Lord how should things go well what
[36:18] should we know and how we just look to
[36:22] you and say Lord give us the direction
[36:24] we need to go or what needs to take
[36:25] place because you know sometimes when we
[36:28] pray and you know as brother Dale said
[36:31] many times you know we want to pray for
[36:33] certain things in our lives well you
[36:34] know what God's gonna give them to us
[36:37] and we say well lord give me patience
[36:39] well you know what when things come our
[36:41] way you know we don't want patients we
[36:44] want them now
[36:46] but we have we have things that happened
[36:49] in our
[36:50] laughs and you know we want to overcome
[36:52] things in our lives that we want to
[36:53] change things well you know what the
[36:54] things that come our way that soak the
[36:56] Lord I don't want that well you know
[36:59] what that's what you pray for and that's
[37:00] what's going to bring you exactly what
[37:02] you won't you know anytime that anybody
[37:08] that's ever played sports and though
[37:09] brother Wade has and different ones you
[37:12] know played sports well you know what
[37:13] you know you know they always tell you
[37:16] know you have to give 110 percent you've
[37:19] got to give 110 percent no matter what
[37:21] you're doing if you want to get good at
[37:23] it you know there was an old saying that
[37:25] many times people always said hey said
[37:27] don't practice something until you get
[37:29] it right
[37:30] but practice something till you can't
[37:32] get it wrong but you know what you got
[37:35] to keep on practicing it and you know
[37:37] the thing is is you've got a coach there
[37:39] and that coach is gonna be there and
[37:41] that coach is gonna find out exactly
[37:43] what you don't have right or what you
[37:46] can or what you can improve on and you
[37:49] know that's that coach is gonna get
[37:51] there and say you know this is what you
[37:52] need to work on you don't do this right
[37:54] you need to fix this for him or whatever
[37:55] and you know what and they get out there
[37:57] and yeah that's the one thing that you
[37:58] got to do whether it's you know batting
[38:00] or whatever you know that one thing it
[38:01] is whatever you do wrong you know that's
[38:03] wrong you know even if you're talking
[38:06] about a boxer they know your weaknesses
[38:09] and the thing whatever it is that you
[38:11] don't do right get it whatever your
[38:13] stance or your form whatever it is you
[38:16] know that that's the one point that
[38:17] they're gonna work on you all the time
[38:19] is sometimes they put somebody in the
[38:21] ring with you and that's the one thing
[38:23] is because you know you drop your keep
[38:26] your set of keeping your hand up all the
[38:27] time you garden yourself when you they
[38:29] put somebody in the ring and that's all
[38:31] they do it's waiting on you to make that
[38:33] mistake soon as you drop your hand and
[38:35] they just keep doing well you know what
[38:36] after a while you finally figure out
[38:37] keep that hand up you know whatever it
[38:40] is and you know many times people go
[38:43] through things and you know you you work
[38:45] on exercising and and all that and you
[38:51] wore out after practice all day and next
[38:53] thing you know you know what let's run
[38:55] some sprints you know why cuz we won't
[38:56] give you no because you wore out your
[38:58] you're winded and everything's like that
[39:00] it's like no now it's time to we're
[39:03] really
[39:03] start burning energy you know really and
[39:06] then it's like you know when you get
[39:07] done it's like you have you know you're
[39:09] just dragging along but you know what
[39:11] that's what it takes it takes that extra
[39:13] that you have to keep giving and you
[39:15] know you keep practicing on the things
[39:17] that you don't have right and that's the
[39:19] thing that goes that God sees in our
[39:21] lives whatever has to be done then you
[39:23] know those are the things that God wants
[39:24] us to work on and that's the things that
[39:26] come our way that God wants us to fix
[39:28] and God wants to mold us into his image
[39:30] and when you know well you know why do
[39:32] these things keep happening to me why
[39:34] because God wants you to become a better
[39:36] person because he wants to mold you into
[39:39] his image and this is what's bringing
[39:41] you to that place it's like well they
[39:46] they wish they could you know bypass all
[39:49] that well you know that doesn't work
[39:50] that way that God has brought us to the
[39:55] place he wants us to be you know you
[40:02] know just like when you have trials and
[40:06] problems and everything like that you
[40:08] know you know when you overcome them
[40:10] then you know you don't go through them
[40:11] but you know as you if you fail that
[40:13] trial you know you've got to go back
[40:14] through it again you fail at you go back
[40:16] through it again and so you know many
[40:18] times it takes a while and you know so
[40:21] it takes us going back to that place and
[40:22] saying Lord what is it what is it gonna
[40:24] take for me to overcome and which lots
[40:28] of times it's it's to the point we get
[40:29] to place sometimes in our lives that we
[40:31] realize you know that's not me sometimes
[40:35] it's what it takes is us surrendering to
[40:38] him that he can come on the scene and
[40:40] then we can overcome but as long as many
[40:42] times we want to we want to you know we
[40:45] don't want to surrender what we need to
[40:47] surrender because we get to a point
[40:49] where it's like well you know what Lord
[40:50] we're gonna give you 80% of it when 20%
[40:53] is gonna be mine or 90% and 10% you know
[40:57] I'm gonna hold on to a little bit well
[40:59] you know what that's still not gonna be
[41:00] right because until you give a hundred
[41:02] percent to him then you know what you've
[41:04] not overcome it takes a hundred percent
[41:07] it takes a total dying out to yourself a
[41:10] total surrender to Him and you know it's
[41:13] why it takes over so many times of
[41:15] people get into so many things and they
[41:17] do
[41:17] overcome to get into positions why
[41:19] they've not got to a place where they've
[41:21] surrendered and so you know the thing is
[41:23] if as Ruth came into this field you know
[41:26] when she come into this field you know
[41:28] he told Boaz told Ruth he said don't you
[41:31] have your eyes on any other field he
[41:34] said but keep your eyes on the field
[41:36] right here he said keep your eyes on the
[41:38] Reapers and he said you follow the
[41:40] Reapers through the field because this
[41:43] is the Word of God and he said those are
[41:45] going to be people that are becoming
[41:46] through there and he said you follow
[41:48] them and they'll bring you to the place
[41:50] that you need they'll give you the play
[41:51] the things that you have need of will be
[41:53] in the word and you'll receive it and so
[41:56] you know many times people have you know
[41:57] they wanted they want to get they want
[41:59] to do their own thing you know they to
[42:01] have their eyes on other fields but let
[42:03] me tell you something if you're going to
[42:05] live on the Word of God if you're going
[42:06] to receive the Word of God then it takes
[42:08] a total dying out he takes you staying
[42:10] in the place that God has placed you and
[42:12] it takes you stay under the headship of
[42:14] the word that can bring you to the place
[42:16] where you ought to be because if if Ruth
[42:19] had her eyes on all the other fields
[42:21] that were out there that wasn't the
[42:22] place where she ought to be you know
[42:24] because if Ruth had come along the way
[42:26] and she had her eyes on all the other
[42:28] fields and all the other places and you
[42:30] know what she might have missed Boaz
[42:32] when he come to the field to meet her
[42:34] why because she had her eyes she was out
[42:36] of position and you know the thing is is
[42:38] if we want to meet God then we have to
[42:40] meet him on his place he called a place
[42:42] for us to meet and that was under the
[42:45] word under the blood is where we're
[42:46] supposed to meet under Christ there is
[42:49] the place where we come to so we can
[42:51] meet him and that's where he's going to
[42:54] meet us under the shed blood of the word
[42:55] is a place where he wants us to meet him
[42:58] and if we get in there that field that
[43:00] he said he would lead and guide us into
[43:02] all truth and so here we always would
[43:04] come into this field and we gather where
[43:07] the where the word is and we stay where
[43:09] them where the angels are and not not
[43:13] only you know not only is the Angels you
[43:15] know the speaking of the heavenly angels
[43:17] coming but you know we've had it we've
[43:19] had an angel entire day we've we've had
[43:21] a we've had a prophet in our day to come
[43:23] to bring us the word so you know we
[43:25] don't have to
[43:26] about where we ought to be one because
[43:27] he brought us the war because it was
[43:30] Christ speaking to us through a person
[43:32] so a man come and spoke to us and he was
[43:34] the word why because we can have
[43:37] confidence in in the world we don't have
[43:39] to worry about naysayers or any other
[43:41] buddy-buddy saying what brother Brandon
[43:42] was wrong here he was wrong there but
[43:44] you know what he was vindicated by the
[43:46] word and he spoke to each one of us and
[43:48] you know what it becomes a personal
[43:50] revelation to where you ought to be you
[43:57] know I don't worry about what everybody
[43:58] else says you know they're okay you know
[43:59] they do whatever they won't do but you
[44:02] know the thing is as for me in my house
[44:04] we're going to serve the Lord why
[44:05] because it becomes a personal revelation
[44:07] you've got to put your stake down you
[44:09] got to drive it down it's got to become
[44:11] real to you to know what you believe
[44:12] were you gonna stay in it's not what
[44:16] everybody else believes it's what you
[44:17] believe you've got to come to a place to
[44:20] see Jesus Christ for yourself he said if
[44:23] you don't see Jesus crave you don't see
[44:24] Christ in every verse go back and read
[44:26] it again if you don't see Christ in your
[44:28] life then there's a place where you can
[44:30] come to that you can find Christ in the
[44:33] word because he's gonna lead you and
[44:35] guide you that you can see him and see
[44:40] everybody talks about if we're in the
[44:43] field if we're in the place in the word
[44:44] then you know what God brings men along
[44:47] the way to help us you know that's what
[44:52] I struck me about Ruth you know
[44:54] Boaz tells Ruth he says listen he said
[44:56] you stay in the wind the field this is
[44:59] my field
[44:59] he said you gather wherever you want to
[45:02] gather from this is all mine and he said
[45:06] he said you go along where the Reapers
[45:07] are and he said as they're gathering he
[45:09] said there's drop they're dropping
[45:11] handfuls so they were giving her more
[45:12] than what she just had to gather up off
[45:15] the ground but there was something that
[45:16] was being left for her so there was
[45:18] something left for us but in our day
[45:20] there was something left for us one
[45:23] because God come and give us something
[45:24] in our day you know because there was
[45:26] something that was given in every day in
[45:28] every church age there was something
[45:30] given but it was something given to us
[45:31] in our day something given to you
[45:33] personally in your day when brother
[45:36] Graham talks about the bride you know he
[45:38] said he always comes when he talks about
[45:39] Ruth
[45:40] he talks about the Gentile bride
[45:41] everything like it and then he goes back
[45:42] and he talks about it being the personal
[45:44] believer you digging in the word for
[45:46] yourself you're gonna find what God has
[45:48] for you but you know he talks about the
[45:52] young men that are in the field and he
[45:53] said he said these young men they've
[45:55] drawn water here they are helping in the
[45:58] reaping process here they all in the
[46:00] field working and he says I have two
[46:02] commanded the young men not to harm you
[46:04] not to touch you not to harm you not to
[46:07] not to plague you not to harass you here
[46:10] they are and they've come into the field
[46:12] and here they are and they're a blessing
[46:13] to you and they're here to help you and
[46:16] they're over there to watch over you and
[46:19] you gather with the other women in the
[46:20] field and you're working and you help
[46:23] yourselves to whatever you want now you
[46:25] want what struck me is because many
[46:27] people that they want to come into the
[46:29] word they want to get into into the word
[46:31] and they will walk a Christian life and
[46:33] they want to see things but the problem
[46:34] is as they get in here and they're
[46:36] worried and they're stressed and they're
[46:38] filled with anxiety about different
[46:40] things and you know what they don't have
[46:42] faith they don't have a place to rest in
[46:45] the Word of God because if you know what
[46:47] if you have confidence in the word if
[46:50] you have confidence in God that God will
[46:52] lead you and God will lead you and you
[46:54] know what he can speak through a person
[46:57] to you and you know what because so many
[46:59] people are so concerned about you know
[47:01] trying to get into the word but you know
[47:03] what if you get in the Word of God and
[47:04] you trust God then God will lead you and
[47:07] guide you to the place where you ought
[47:08] to be and you know what God will show
[47:10] you where you need to be and one of the
[47:12] things that people are so concerned
[47:14] about is whether they you know we're
[47:15] whether we ought to have a fivefold
[47:17] ministry or you know what we're just
[47:19] going to follow the Prophet well you
[47:20] know what the Prophet spoke that there
[47:22] would be a fivefold ministry in the last
[47:23] days you know people always talk about a
[47:26] return ministry where is the return
[47:28] ministry people preach on a return
[47:30] ministry well let me tell you brothers
[47:31] and sisters I believe in a return
[47:33] ministry I believe it's a fivefold
[47:35] ministry in the last days that's
[47:38] bringing the word for the return of
[47:40] Jesus Christ who brings Jesus Christ
[47:42] back in flesh why because the fivefold
[47:45] ministry bringing the word is going to
[47:47] perfect the Saints that's
[47:49] exactly.the the prescription that was
[47:52] given in our day for us to receive the
[47:54] word for him to come to us that we can
[47:57] be called away well because it takes us
[47:59] it's got to be the Holy Ghost speaking
[48:01] through somebody but you know what God
[48:04] doesn't work through fear God doesn't
[48:07] work through the anxiety God don't work
[48:08] through all confusion or anything like
[48:11] that but you know what if you can trust
[48:13] God then he can speak through one man
[48:15] they can speak through another one
[48:18] because he's a sane man it's the same
[48:20] Holy Ghost that they were their birth
[48:22] these men into this age and not only but
[48:25] he said he said it was a group of men
[48:26] called in every age that was the voice
[48:29] of many waters they were speaking the
[48:30] word that came through with those men so
[48:36] if you and I have confidence in the Word
[48:38] of God that he's the same yesterday and
[48:40] today and forever then there was a group
[48:42] of men they was called as Peter and Paul
[48:45] was called and John and the different
[48:47] ones that he called all the ones through
[48:49] the the Old Testament you know through
[48:50] the church ages you know all the
[48:53] different well it just wasn't it just
[48:54] wasn't the church age messengers but
[48:56] they were other men of God never called
[48:58] through that God spoke through the God
[49:00] use to bring the word all the way
[49:01] through he just didn't call seven men to
[49:04] bring the word but you know what he
[49:05] called a group of men in each age that
[49:07] was calling of God to bring the word and
[49:09] to perfect the people for that age to
[49:14] bring them to the place where they ought
[49:16] to be well then you know what God's
[49:18] called us to do the exact same thing so
[49:21] we don't have to worry about being
[49:22] confused why because the Holy Ghost
[49:24] inside of the fivefold ministry that's
[49:27] speaking through him it's not just a man
[49:29] speaking but it's the Holy Ghost and
[49:31] it's the only ghost on the inside of the
[49:33] believers in side of the church delay a
[49:36] team that's going to hear the same thing
[49:37] and you know what it's not me trying to
[49:40] give my word or trying to give my idea
[49:42] but it's the Holy Ghost speaking and
[49:44] it's only ghosts on the inside of you
[49:46] speaking and listening and agreeing to
[49:48] it
[49:51] you know we don't have to be worried and
[49:54] you know it's so it's so it's so
[49:55] I say silly but you know it's so sad to
[50:00] see people in this condition where the
[50:03] where they're so wrapped up about things
[50:04] and you know and gods trying to get
[50:06] people to understand that if he calls
[50:10] you and he and he's led you this way and
[50:13] he's me and he's trying to bring you to
[50:15] a place of adoption if he's trying to
[50:17] bring you to a place in the new birth
[50:19] he's trying to birth to you into the
[50:21] body all the ways that he's brought you
[50:23] if he can do these things that obviously
[50:26] he can speak through a man well you know
[50:37] I got a confident I got all the
[50:38] confidence in the world and brother
[50:39] branham everything brother Branham says
[50:41] I say yes sir amen hallelujah except
[50:45] where he mentions a fivefold ministry
[50:52] well how are you supposed to have
[50:54] confidence in what God says if you if
[50:56] you can't put your confidence in all
[50:58] that God says if you can't trust
[51:01] everything that God said that how are
[51:02] you supposed to believe how you supposed
[51:04] to come to a place where you need to
[51:06] come to but God's called us into this
[51:10] word he wants us to dig into the word
[51:12] and have confidence that God has called
[51:14] us to this place and showed us what we
[51:16] need to say - you know what we can dig
[51:18] in the word and you know it doesn't take
[51:20] just just just me it doesn't take just
[51:23] brother Dale or what are whoever wait
[51:25] but it takes every person working
[51:28] together God has called each one of us
[51:30] and you know what it takes you you've
[51:32] got to read the Bible for yourself
[51:33] you've got to pray you've got to listen
[51:35] you've got to feed on your own wait for
[51:38] God to speak to you and sometimes you
[51:40] know what it takes it takes those type
[51:42] things that people are feeding on that
[51:44] God can bring the word to us because you
[51:52] know we're just like those young men in
[51:53] the field we're just their servants
[51:56] that's the thing you know we're not
[51:58] we're not to be the hierarchy over
[51:59] everybody and rule with an iron fist and
[52:02] and you know and try to beat everybody
[52:04] down and keep everybody under our thumb
[52:10] because God's called us to be led by the
[52:13] Holy Ghost
[52:17] the church the church isn't being led by
[52:19] the pastor the church had been led by
[52:24] the Holy Ghost if you know because if we
[52:29] say well you know what I don't
[52:31] understand why brother Dale does search
[52:33] things I don't understand well you know
[52:35] what you need to pray to God and find
[52:37] out you know lots of times people ask
[52:40] questions like then they said well I
[52:41] don't understand that brother the way
[52:42] you don't understand you know and the
[52:43] problem is is you know what they don't
[52:44] understand everything your brother Dale
[52:45] knows and sometimes you know what God
[52:50] don't God don't tell me everything God
[52:51] don't show me everything so you know
[52:53] what it's not my place why cause I ain't
[52:54] the pastor you know some people they get
[52:59] so wrapped up in things and you know you
[53:01] know and they get to a place where they
[53:05] they start to cause more problems and
[53:08] I'd say you know sometimes I me well
[53:09] thank the Lord deeds to certain people
[53:11] ain't the pastor because you know if
[53:16] he's ordained of God to lead us through
[53:17] then you know what then he's been called
[53:19] to a place and you know God has prepared
[53:21] him for that place he's called him to
[53:23] that place and you know and God's
[53:26] brought him to that place that he can
[53:28] bring us to the place where we ought to
[53:29] be but you know he writes like well I
[53:33] don't know you know we got all these
[53:37] people we're just gonna we're just gonna
[53:39] sit home and listen to the tapes
[53:41] we just got we're just gonna do it we're
[53:44] just gonna do our little thing and you
[53:45] know we're so wrapped up in all these
[53:47] and all these things and we're we're
[53:49] just so and just involved in all these
[53:52] things and and you know and then when
[53:53] you talk to somebody you know what they
[53:55] don't know they don't know split piece
[53:56] from coffee grounds I mean you see
[54:00] people's lives you know it's where where
[54:04] is the growth where where is that where
[54:06] is the manifestation you know the thing
[54:10] is is worried where you grow it where
[54:11] where you manifest where is that where
[54:13] is the showing of God in your life and
[54:19] people people they don't see that but
[54:22] you know if you stand in the light and
[54:25] in the word you know what then your all
[54:26] your life ought to start manifest
[54:28] something and you know if you know
[54:32] because sometimes it takes a you know
[54:34] people don't want to look in the mirror
[54:35] of the word and see where they've grown
[54:37] if they're matching up do they not see
[54:40] where how far they've come and did they
[54:42] see that they've grown any because you
[54:48] know the thing is is if you if you stop
[54:50] at one spot if you if you get hung up on
[54:53] one spot if you if you don't you'll
[54:55] never grow past that and we see people
[55:00] you know that you wonder about them or
[55:02] do they have anything to have any growth
[55:04] in their life as the Lord spoke to oh
[55:07] yeah the God wants us to stay in the
[55:17] field and dig in the word and God has
[55:22] prepared something for us and you know
[55:25] for us to continue to gather and as as
[55:31] we gather in the end the word and we
[55:33] feed on the word then you know what it
[55:34] brings us to the place where we ought to
[55:35] be because you know as we saw
[55:40] she kept gathering and gathering all day
[55:44] long to the evening time she was out
[55:45] there gathering continued to gather
[55:47] continue to gather but then there came a
[55:51] time you know went at evening when she
[55:53] left the field and she went out and then
[55:58] she went and Naomi told her said you
[56:01] know now it's the time that when to go
[56:03] to the threshing floor because that's
[56:06] where Boaz is and you know she late she
[56:09] went there at dark after everybody had
[56:10] had went to sleep and everything and
[56:13] then she went down there and laid before
[56:16] Boaz and the threshing floor you know
[56:21] she laid there until he until he woke up
[56:23] and realized she was there and you know
[56:25] then he spread his skirt over her you
[56:27] know and he was speeding you know he
[56:30] told her he says you know that he spoke
[56:32] and saw what she had done and that she
[56:34] continued because she was looking for
[56:36] something
[56:36] she had a desire that she wanted to to
[56:39] receive from him and you know what then
[56:41] he said you know
[56:42] but he said Naomi's inheritance has to
[56:45] be redeemed and he said you know she has
[56:48] to be redeemed also and you know what
[56:50] she continued all the way through
[56:52] following the word until she came to
[56:55] that place that Boaz came before the
[56:57] elders and he took off his shoe and he
[56:59] said you know now I'm coming to redeem
[57:01] you I'm coming to fulfill everything
[57:03] that has to be done you know what it
[57:05] takes
[57:06] laying in the word because that's what's
[57:08] going to bring you to the fullness
[57:09] that's what's gonna bring you to the
[57:11] fullness as you stay in the word you
[57:13] know you know it people you see people
[57:16] and you know if you start out and
[57:18] justification if you're at justification
[57:20] then where you need to be is in the word
[57:23] that's what that's what brings you to
[57:25] the word is when you come when you come
[57:27] to God when you when you get saved if
[57:29] you're just a justification you need to
[57:31] stay in the word until he brings you to
[57:33] sanctification because what brings you
[57:34] to sanctification is the word that's
[57:38] what's going to bring you to the next
[57:39] state what's going to bring you to the
[57:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the word
[57:43] the word is what sanctifies you it takes
[57:45] the word that's what's bringing you to
[57:47] the place to be filled by the Holy Ghost
[57:49] that's what it takes it takes the word
[57:51] and you have to stay in the word and
[57:52] many times you know it's getting under a
[57:56] ministry that can lead you and guide you
[57:58] and teach you the truth because the
[58:00] problem is is we've got people that you
[58:02] know just because you're a preacher or
[58:03] whatever you know that doesn't mean that
[58:05] you can lead anybody and and I'm sorry
[58:08] but there's some you know that you know
[58:10] I I just you know it's kind of hard for
[58:14] me to have confidence in them one
[58:17] because we know that there's something
[58:18] that you know they're not they're not in
[58:20] the word you know how you do somebody's
[58:24] got to come that way and know what
[58:25] they're talking about to lead you that
[58:27] way and it takes that kind of leadership
[58:30] that somebody's gonna lead you through
[58:32] and you've got to stay in the word and
[58:34] to come to that fullness to come to the
[58:36] place that God has for you we need to
[58:40] follow it with God that he can be with
[58:42] us and he can carry us all the way
[58:44] through
[58:47] we have to worry about the different
[58:50] things in our lives God's going to bring
[58:52] us through God has called us to a place
[58:55] and I thank God that we have a place
[58:57] here you know I you know people say you
[59:01] know what why do you what do you say
[59:04] those type things because you know what
[59:05] I believe it you know what if I didn't
[59:08] believe the word was here I wouldn't be
[59:09] here you know what if I didn't if I
[59:13] didn't agree with the word then you know
[59:14] what I'd be gone because you know I
[59:18] believe this is what God called me to
[59:21] you know have I finished no I'm not
[59:24] finished but you know what I believe I'm
[59:26] standing in the fight I'm standing I'm
[59:29] still running the race I want to still
[59:31] be fire I still want to be in the word I
[59:33] want to become faithful in the word
[59:35] digging in the word gathering what God
[59:38] has for us the purpose that he has laid
[59:40] out for us the word east laid out for us
[59:42] I want to be faithful in that and
[59:43] gathering what I need for this journey
[59:45] because that's what it takes because it
[59:49] takes bringing in laying in the field of
[59:52] where God has called us to and you know
[59:56] what you can have confidence in God
[59:58] where God calls you to you know you know
[1:00:02] I don't I don't mind listening to the
[1:00:03] tapes I enjoy listening it takes I
[1:00:06] believe in listening to tapes but you
[1:00:08] know what I believe in a fivefold
[1:00:09] ministry time because you know what I
[1:00:11] can believe I can stand in in the field
[1:00:13] and you know what because if if the Holy
[1:00:15] Ghost is leading you then you know what
[1:00:17] the Holy Ghost will tell you whether
[1:00:19] something is wrong or not you know
[1:00:22] there's been times in my life where I've
[1:00:24] heard things anything you know it just
[1:00:25] stopped me in my tracks it's like I
[1:00:27] didn't understand but I knew something
[1:00:30] wasn't right
[1:00:31] and you know what you hold on to that
[1:00:33] for years and you know then all of a
[1:00:37] sudden God will show you exactly what
[1:00:39] the truth is but you know what God
[1:00:41] catches your attention well sometimes
[1:00:43] people just go right along and just you
[1:00:44] know they just scoot right over it and
[1:00:46] scan right over and they don't even
[1:00:47] catch anything it's like well we're
[1:00:51] gonna you know what what is it that that
[1:00:53] God's not showing them these people
[1:00:55] things and it's like well you know I
[1:00:59] just got confidence in and in brother
[1:01:01] Dale's like what
[1:01:01] you know what that that's good I got I
[1:01:04] got confidence in and this brother over
[1:01:06] here and or whoever else well that's
[1:01:08] good but you know you got to have the
[1:01:09] Holy Ghost for yourself you got to check
[1:01:12] up on the word for yourself it's like
[1:01:17] well I don't understand what people say
[1:01:19] I don't understand what brother Dale
[1:01:21] says I you know it just don't make sense
[1:01:22] to me well you know what you need to
[1:01:24] just stay in the word for a while it'll
[1:01:26] start to make sense too
[1:01:30] and brothers you know whoever they are
[1:01:34] you know if something's not right you
[1:01:35] know what you you stay and you and I
[1:01:38] understand people you know there's
[1:01:40] brothers out there good brothers fine
[1:01:41] brothers whatever you know they may be
[1:01:43] wrong about something and you know what
[1:01:45] we've all been wrong about something you
[1:01:47] know what it takes some time you know
[1:01:49] all of a sudden what the Lord may show
[1:01:50] them something that you know they're not
[1:01:51] right they might so you know I'm not I'm
[1:01:56] out trying to throw anybody under the
[1:01:57] bus or nothing because you know what I
[1:01:59] still want to hold grace out for
[1:02:01] everybody but you know what God will
[1:02:03] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:02:05] God will speak to you what you need to
[1:02:07] have and it will show you the truth you
[1:02:10] know what I could have confidence in the
[1:02:12] word I can have confidence in what
[1:02:17] brother Bram said I could have
[1:02:18] confidence in this because you know we
[1:02:19] found people that you know they out
[1:02:21] trying to tear up
[1:02:22] what brother Branham said well brother
[1:02:23] Branham wasn't the prophet he said this
[1:02:25] isn't that neither and the next thing
[1:02:26] you know now they say well this ain't
[1:02:28] right either well then you know then who
[1:02:30] is right if the Bible is it right if the
[1:02:33] word is it right if brother Branham was
[1:02:35] wrong everybody's wrong then you know
[1:02:37] what I guess we ought to be following
[1:02:38] you then then they want to make
[1:02:44] themselves God you know we have a place
[1:02:49] that God can speak to us and show us
[1:02:51] what's truth you know what it takes it
[1:02:55] takes getting before God and seeking God
[1:02:58] and that's one thing that's missing in
[1:03:00] people's off people don't set God get
[1:03:03] before God seek God's face find out
[1:03:06] what's truth or not amen god bless you
[1:03:09] not lets off standing but you know if we
[1:03:13] can have confidence in God God can speak
[1:03:15] to us he can show
[1:03:15] what's truth answer our questions you
[1:03:20] know we don't have to we don't have to
[1:03:21] be worried or concerned about things you
[1:03:25] know but that's that that's the age in
[1:03:26] which we live right now is x times of
[1:03:29] confusion perilous times will come it's
[1:03:34] the time that we live in that people
[1:03:35] will live in this hour and they've
[1:03:37] confused and they anxiety and they worry
[1:03:40] and you know people that's walked in the
[1:03:42] message for years and years and years
[1:03:44] and now they said well I don't know if
[1:03:45] this is truth or not after you walk in
[1:03:49] it for years and years and then then
[1:03:51] they could see where brother Branham
[1:03:53] wasn't right it's a terrible thing that
[1:03:57] people have walked around but you know
[1:03:58] what it's a time of manifesting and we
[1:04:01] know that it's a time that there has
[1:04:03] been a mixed multitude that's walked off
[1:04:05] but you know what now's the time that
[1:04:06] it's going to be made manifest of who is
[1:04:09] who but you know what I'm not worried
[1:04:13] about that you know why because I'm
[1:04:15] gonna can still stay in that field and
[1:04:17] I'm gonna gather while God has for me
[1:04:20] and you know whether anybody else comes
[1:04:23] or goes whatever else they do that's so
[1:04:24] that's up to them but I know where God
[1:04:27] called me to be God placed me in the
[1:04:29] place where I need to be and I believe
[1:04:32] that each person ought to have an own
[1:04:34] church but you know what I don't I don't
[1:04:38] rely on the fivefold ministry to give me
[1:04:41] everything it takes me reading and
[1:04:44] studying and praying I gotta have my own
[1:04:46] experience with God I got to have my own
[1:04:49] time with God because it works hand in
[1:04:54] hand but it takes us all doing that
[1:04:57] together and people people are worried
[1:05:00] about all these type things well you
[1:05:01] know what God didn't call me to be
[1:05:04] worried and concerned and half fear and
[1:05:06] all these tough things God called me to
[1:05:08] a place of confidence and God showed me
[1:05:10] the word and showed me what was truth
[1:05:12] and that's what I've put my confidence
[1:05:14] in amen god bless you tonight
[1:05:19] let's sing you know here by to see amen
