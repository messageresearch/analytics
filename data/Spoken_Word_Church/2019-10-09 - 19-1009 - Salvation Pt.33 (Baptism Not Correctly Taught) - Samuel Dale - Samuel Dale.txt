speak to our hearts and lives and guide us and keep us Lord in your grace in Jesus name go down to verse four save time reading whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue and knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go over to Zechariah 4 says and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is working out of his sleep and said unto me what see us down and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick Hall of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and it's seven lamps their own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top their own and the two olive trees by one by the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that's talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these what these be and I said no my lord and the answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art down a great mountain before his rule I shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and unnoticed is to bring forth the headstone we'll get to it in a minute he's not to bring forth the corner stone the disciples laid the cornerstone we built on the foundations apostles and prophets all right but now he's to bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hens of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house in his hand shall also finish yet and I don't know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto thee you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word as I've said I've tried to bring to you over the past couple of months a story or a part to try to get it connected together and we want to wind up tonight showing that you know a dream interpreted the Prophet said is a vision alright if it's interpreted okay then my point when we get to it we'll be talking about sister Sheppard's dream that was interpreted by the Prophet to show what it would be and he declares that the the dream are you know we call it a vision because it comes to Paes came after that he had preached on the stature of a perfect man you know the sister had the dream before then and then wouldn't brother Branham come forth and preached the statue of a perfect man then she saw her dream and sent it to him and he interpreted the dream to her and it compared exactly that's what a you don't get nothing else remember this that her vision her dream compared exactly to the basis of what the Prophet had been bringing what Peter had taught you know add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience you know and bringing it down to that and it comes out to be the same place as the adoption because in the adoption 'el series you would be covering you know how that son is born into the family and then is adopted into the family and that's what we've been trying to lay out here in in doing this and try to find it and seeing that the word of the Lord came to the Prophet in the end time all right now sister Sheppard was worried about herself whether she had the Holy Ghost or not all right she was concerned about that she had a dream and in that dream the dream was what was showing you know that's what I'm saying that she had a dream but interpret it made a vision out of it because she saw her own life by the interpretation the prophet brought until even brother Branham said God accepted her foundation showing she had the baptism with all the ghosts all right he then have as God accepted our foundation as he accepted us or or whatever because if it is it would be in the biblical term and that's what I've tried to drive over and over you know board I guess to a lot of you to think about trying to express about the new birth the seed the Prophet said the new birth is the foundation faith is a foundation of all time that new birth all right if we don't have that new verses he was concerned but God spoke to her and told her that she had it he had except because the water came down to her feet in the the dream that she was bringing alright and in doing that see then it shows that the word is correct he got her answer now if you and I don't get our answer then where we at we were we're we're our own problems trying to figure out our problems and and making it but now what have we been over and over and over what is the foundation of all Christian thinking faith in the Word of God because that is the new birth the faith that brings that all right and we covered how that the in the new birth that is the Prophet owned the flash on the blasphemous names when he gets into it interpreting her dream he tells something there that you should have read over and over that he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost had been incorrectly taught you remember that he said it was then correctly taught now she was worried whether she had her tonight because she was concerned about that she had spoken tongues he had done this he had done that but yet in finishing it up the it wound up to be the answer was in the message the Prophet was to bring because that was what it was remember the poor and the water in and goofed up the other day and said that cutting the top off of the pyramid you just you know bring it to the right one that was another one showing the what I was trying to bring of the seals and things but that's that's what I've tried to get you to see the new birth is the birth of the word right all right see then it's required that you and I have this new birth then it's required now for someone to to come to an end time and finish it all up it's required that we have these virtues is this not a choice or a thought or an idea it's a point that it's required of us to have these all right now whose responsibility is it about having it first off it must be brought unto us to offer them to us all right the Prophet brought it he brought the message remember he was pouring the water in you know in all and it was bawling out you know all of the trash and the things and he said no it no denominational to hold that Holy Ghost they can't do it but when they put the honey in for the brotherly kindness then the rock did hold you know or the you know and and as it did it begin to swell up I guess a lot but it still it held on all right but the water running down run down to her feet so she got her answer do we have the answer have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe well brother Dan I got the Holy Ghost three years ago all right that's good that's well in a good point but just remember if it won't tie together with the word what did we get well then that's why I tried to end up the series on talking about Zachariah and the coming of the headstone because I've told you what I believe it is you know if you don't believe it that's up to you I believe the the those seals is that headstone to the church I've always believed that because that was what the prophet his emphasis to me was made he said well it's this or that okay you go what you want to I'm sticking with what I see in the word and believe in that in the word that if the cornerstone and the headstone is the same stone and come on Church we talked that in the Baptist now don't don't frown up on me about it we talked the cornerstone and the headstone in the Baptist Church because we knew that the cornerstone was there and it was the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone all right and then he was the headstone who what is the headstone the revealed word the revealed Word of God is the head to the church all right because it's the corner of the church it's the cornerstone it's the stone that the stumbling that they stumble that what about being as always try to illustrate what about being out in a football field and you know hundred yards out through there and you got one little Bill Rock right out in the middle of it and you stumble over that rock trying to find a stone because that's what we've done that's why the Prophet said it's been so incorrectly talk it's been talk to us that we shouted we cried we spoke in tongues we've done this we've done that we believed the message you know those things has been talked to the people until they have no foundation to bring it on where could you put that into the headstone you know working at B let's see if the cornerstone is the revealed word then the headstone would be the revealed word what was to be revealed in the last days why I said we're using Zachariah because it'll bring forth the cornerstone he I mean he didn't break the Prophet said this one here didn't bring forth the cornerstone that cornerstone was laid in those disciples he said he brought forth the headstone will you just think about it now that's what I've tried to to illustrate you think how simple it is because that to me is what's the most marvelous thing is to think of how simple God makes it we have no excuse for any doubts or thoughts or ideas of what we think this ought to be or that ought to be because it's what he said that cornerstone was the Lord Jesus Christ walking up on the shores of Galilee trying to bring his word to the people he was the cornerstone right but he was also the headstone and the headstone was what was rejected Lee sure they rejected the cornerstone cousin didn't know what it would or not that's the easier for us to understand but remember the headstone was rejected because there stood the headstone the Lord Jesus Christ the Word of God was that headstone well what would we be looking for in the last day now yours my point that's reason I say it what how many of you've read the seal book I ain't said nobody ain't got it cuz they ain't raising their hand if you're done it I'm just asking you a simple question that's what it's simple about it you say I believe the headstone is the revealed word but do we read the word we study the word or we'd rather read all kind of other things we try to illustrate our emphasize that we need to study the word but is that word become a part of us to work that it's revealed Jesus Christ to us see then asking a simple question how many times if you ever read to see a book but yet I believe in those I declare it for me I don't mind if learning I departed there the other day and the message I believe that's what I've always believed the headstone to the church is the revealed Word what else are you going to make it and if it's the revealed Word then why are we scared to read the word or study the word or listen to the word oh yeah we know everything else yet how many times have we read the steelbook see but somebody comes along try to preach on it and it just people start laying out or start doing everything in the book that is and yet claiming to be the test our head I thought our head was the word we don't get anything tonight get one thing I believe the head of all church the Church of right across is the Word of God now that's the Word of God that's revealed not hid nothing letters on the page many times you've read the book would give you a gold star but how many times have you really sat down and seriously studied and thought about the TAT prophet brought the headstone I'm not looking for a headstone that's resting what that Prophet was said I'm not looking for a headstone the headstone is a reveal word if that's what it is then why would we look for something else but yeah we'd like all other things we like to this that the other and I'm not against anything I'm trying my best to be straight with you they tell you right where I stand because I know that I'll have to stand again one day and I have to answer for the things that I've said that's why I've tried my best to be sincere with you it gets you to follow the word that's always been my goal from day one was to get you to to be interested enough to read to study or listening to tapes but do you do you when what el hELCO okay what's gonna happen when the rook is required that we stand there well I don't have time you understand what I'm saying I believe Church we have night talking about your Lula ain't talking about that I'm talking about the Word of God don't get on all that junk the Word of God is the head of the church why would we not want to study that and read it and find out what it says that is our head it's like telling your husband but you don't care nothing about it because you don't want no fellowship with him but yet the people of this message are so afraid afraid of getting deceived you can't get deceived if you already are and there's no more deception than the basis of the fact that we will not study God's Word and know what it is do you understand what I'm getting here we know what the word is we have the prophets message that prophets message is the head to the church but yet do we honor our head do we we glory in to the fact of our head that he's the head of all time but we'd rather have something else we'd rather we'd rather hear somebody do this or do that we'd rather house something something build up emotional situations or not and you say I'm against it you're lying I've always been a emotional person I just don't put it out well because I keep it sealed up but when I feel on that inside and know what's going home and knowing that people are turning the Word of God down they're rejecting the very head that was declared it's the revealed word why would you not want to study the word well I still have time yeah but what about a church the sister was worried whether or not she had the baptism of the holy God and he said that's why it's been so incorrectly called I don't think she was talking about you know worried about DAR I think she believed what the Prophet was saying right I mean I think you know maybe but yet she was concerned because one said it was this one said it was that one said it was that I don't need it I shouted I cried I spoke him doing all kind of things was made out of it instead of the true interpretation of the word of God what about having you know that's that's what gets me is having God's word that is to be our head and yet we spend our time with other things talk about me you all of us if it was taught wrong back there what does it be and now when looking to people of the message the way they're going a vision came forth he's selling what's a dream you're not listening to what I'm saying a vision interpreted its a dream or a dream interpreted as a vision she wanted an answer do we want an answer are we serious enough to go before God and ask for an answer and be concerned with the fact of whether or not we're born again he gave the interpretation of her dream right the interpretation of the dream was that this man was poured water in and that was the message being poured into the church and it was boiling out all the Trice in the things but didn't the honey would hold because that would be the age of brotherly kindness because that will hold he proved God proved what about it to her that she had the new birth are we serious enough to ask that question of God Lord show me that's what she said she said in other words in the day in the manner of all the things that's going on Lord show me because I've got to have this we've got to have the new birth but there's more to it than this a new birth that's what I've tried to get you to see there's were the misconceptions in the in the days that we're living in the things like I said it's still the prevalent overseas it's saying you don't have the baptism with the Holy Ghost you get all these virtues well cuz they say that's what the Prophet taught well he said you're born again to faith and these virtues are the things that he's required for us to have yes but how do we get them that's what I said I asked the question how do we get these virtues the opening of God's Word the revealing of God's Word will bring the virtues into being you may take a long time but what's that got to do with it we've been 50 years studying the prophets message let's see he was pouring in the messenger was pouring in the message you remember that or did you read blessed famous night he was pouring in the message cleaning up the church and bringing that to the point that God could accept what we have remember when we was in the series they're bringing it over and over you said I accepted Jesus Christ but run said that's all right he said but that ain't it he said if he don't accept you yeah but I tell you what I'll die now you can't tell me coach I accepted Jesus Christ I'll wrap that yeah but did he accept us because that capstone to the church is the revealed word and the profit in the blasphemous night and stature prevent both deals with the headstone coming and sealing the individual into the body of Christ and that was the sisters dream sealed in those things as we studied the Word of God then he can come and seal in those things within us but what if we don't study his work whose fault is it well I didn't know we had to do you didn't know we had to eat the word we'll see how many of he's even Reggie bobble and the Bible be in the Word of God we had we can read everything out I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm talking about all of us because if the headstone is the head of the church and what are we doing we're rejecting our very head how do you think he feels if he feels that I do he feels brokenhearted cuz we got everything else yet we don't study God's Word then we expect our children to some way just automatically become Christians I guess maybe that's why they don't want it maybe that's why our children don't want the message you know what happens I mean some of you now sitting are thinking but when I get it 16 18 years old I'll be out of this you see is it us that's making it that I don't want it have we made it something that is not correct has it been miss you know uncorrect we are incorrectly tall are we telling our children just because if they come to church it's because it's a they participate a little bit of that but they're born again well that's not the born-again experience that's what we should be doing see what's wrong brother branham say it here's what's wrong with the Branham Tabernacle how many of you know what he said it was he said this is what's wrong with the Branham Tabernacle now do you know what he said he said there's two different kinds of faith he said this is what's wrong with Branham Tyburn uncle there's two different kinds of virtue okay okay thirteen if they want to try to get it in they won't you won't try to remain up 13 here's what's wrong with the Branham tabernacle then your profits gonna tell you what's wrong with the Brenham top of that I'm gonna tell you that same thing wrong with Loula Georgia all right what did he say it was you see there's two different kinds of faith there's two different kind of virtue they're two different kind of there's natural nature given virtues and you know goodnesses and parts about us right see we're dependent upon the things of it what he said was wrong well I've got that faith huh I believe I believe the Prophet huh I believe everything two different kind look one thinks it's prohibition you remember that on virtue and temperance temperance saying it's not drinking alcohol but did you listen I know I'm gonna say this and it's gonna go flat okay you realize that right I've tried to explain on that is that God don't expect us to be zombies I don't want a bunch of zombies you know Google Cooper no need a woman zombies he want sons and daughters and you know what sons and daughters have mistakes and problems not you remember what we've tried to bring out where he was talking about virtue and he said that's not a virgin life he said not in this case so he was explaining the case the case was one strength then when he got over to temperance he said it's not drinking alcohol not in this case what was it he said that uncontrollable temper we don't think of Christians as a temper I'm brother Dale you sure and yeah I'm just human enough to tell you God has to look over a lot of problems with you and me a lot of things that should have never been in the world you remember how I was trying to explain it about it he doesn't have to use the word virtue as as virginity because that should never have to be talked about among Christians you shouldn't have to be about alcohol that shouldn't be talked about among Christians but you know what Christians are problem we have troubles we have just as much as anybody else no I don't have no problem I don't temper like I said why is he face get all red why is he all puffed up and you know you get all you know soused out and mad and everything else I've tried to be one thing tried to preach from my bottom of my heart to you to get you to see Jesus Christ go to brendham said Christians are the only ones that have sins is it true sinners condemned on a higher level he's just a sinner well I thought we spoke be safe from that that's what's happening you're being born again it's a process that's taking place within our lives a being born again add to your faith virtue how do you add verse you you study the word and God adds the virtue come on but you cease that that's what's wrong with the Brenham Tabernacle there's a nature given virtue there's a nature given temperance all these things are nature given the biggest part of our faith is mental faith now I didn't say that I'm reading all right they can pull it up on the screen cuz that's number 14 the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith Bible by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God okay the biggest part of our faith is mental faith well look what he says by hearing the word no how would all nobody emphasize that how do we get the virtues right how many times have we said how do we get the virtues by studying the Word of God is that a big secret we don't know how to get them yeah no wonder we're reading here's almanacs to do something else but listen by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God by hearing the word brings us to a mental recognition and he said that's what's wrong with the tabernacle a mental recognition but now watch what he's saying oh brother if it ever strikes this now watch it there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word oh no matter what everything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word word with garden word was clay I keep on reading and the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst and when the word itself is poured into our faith now where's your faith top of the headstone there I got up here oh no no no get back down where he that read what he's talking about and what's he and when the word itself is poured into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation well what if we don't pour it in upon this foundation I listen it's not poured in at the head that's my point you look at it to head things out pour it in from there he said the foundation foundation of your faith and pulling this foundation I'll build my church not a fundamental concept of church joint in a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when them streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual revelation where did the mental faith see faith cometh by hearing and we don't hear how can God quicken it but the Prophet said what he said the holy ghost is sitting in your soul if you're born again waiting on you to bring in the word and he said it when it comes in immediately he makes it alive well see that's what we need but the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith and watch it brings us to a mental recognition but if this coming from above now we're up here you ain't listening come on back up where we was you dig it in you foundation you getting started because just were you working that now he's come up to the top because what was the statement of the making the Chrysler mister I mean in statue of a perfect man he said God coming down through the cross holy spirit now we're dealing with sealing in what if he foundation ain't right you can't jump up get what I'm saying you think well I just gotta I need the headstone I've got it you're gonna have to start from the bottom and grow up then what happens that starts sealing in back down that's your statue of a perfect man there's the man brother Brennan said that would go in the rapture that's the church he said that would go in the rapture but when it's sealed in well I got filled in when I got the Holy Ghost that's sealed in it faith that's sealed in it faith that's the new birth you're sealed in when verse ER comes and then it's molded together with it it seals in that you're going upward one time now when you get to the top if you're listening when you get to the top then that headstone is the same as the cornerstone and the head is what seals it in yes each individual each thing is sealed in come on listen to what I'm saying they're trying to figure it out the cornerstone is at the bottom you take and you each one of those has started to seal it in as you're coming in that's fine but that comes a place when you reach the top that it's going to come back down and seal the whole thing together as a unit hell you got the baptism with a whole ago that's why it's so incorrectly tout but yet we're still toying with with where brother Branham says you're born again then baptized into the body with that man I can't figure that out how can you be born again and then baptized into the body you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the new part you're baptized into the body for gifts you're baptized into the body and that's your word for your prophecy for gifts gifts come with the body you're sealed in cause Satan's sealed out what about it pouring into our faith word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation upon this foundation now you're still down at the bottom what I'm saying you said well I don't understand the Prophet you're saying this about the bottle it's to talk listen you're being sealed in as the word is being revealed to you which they'll come a final sealing one day it will fill every fiber of our being the Prophet said for us to go in the rapture we've got something to look forward to but yet it's so simple until we stumble all over it try to find it faith is the foundation of all time that headstone is the revealed Word of God that's why I said it over and over and I'll keep saying it but I've always believed it when I read that seal book the first time a nice I do most of you some of you know my story buddy huh I started studying the message in Brenham oak told me about the seals I said I won't that book cause see we we were good Baptist we note about the seals we'd read the book in Revelations at least we knew a lot about it we wouldn't exactly like my brother-in-law thought that Kong King Kong was walking across our you know being the Beast but we still had our problems but listen I wanted that seal book you're talking about reading any other you ever think about reading the church age book in two days and work for a living come on I ain't kidding you when I said I've listened that I've read six books from the hips two types in one day no the note finally gave it to me after I'd read and I remember try some history in the church ages and who was it smelled chastity of two or three young I read that seal book I read a lot of things that was very interesting but we had talked with some of those things in the Baptists this was to me at the time of reading it was another man with another idea of saying what these things look like and I wasn't making fun of my brother-in-law because that's what people think see some big King Kong is that beast rise up out of the ocean you know and it does all of these things you know I wasn't making a lot of him cuz we had our own concepts and thoughts about what the seals and things were I really enjoyed reading it but there was no nothing to anchor within my soul because I didn't understand I liked it to see a book aside I wouldn't read it I went back to the church age book I can understand in you know brother Larry you stalking church age book a lot years ago cuz he loves that church April I've always said you give me one book the message ain't King getting them more than that one book I'll take Church a book no somewhere others are shaking their head you said no I won't test that yep you don't understand to see you get through the church they flew so where'd I go back to I went back to the church edge book and I started reading and studying and getting down the thoughts of what he was trying to bring the one God the one you know the the no eternal hail is a doctrinal issues it was covered and it was probably I don't know six or eight months I picked up the seal book and I began to read it had become a brand-new book cause now I had a foundation the church age book was a foundation because it was the teaching of the doctrines of the Bible that's why I loved it so much they said always got this one I put it on internet send me a place and show me in the church age book worst concert I put that out on the internet all over the world so just come on I think be an arrogant I'm just telling the truth you sit down and listen and read that it'll have its own answer in there but a random even talks about in there that the raptures don't come on the force severe that's in the church age book supposed to be written before the seals come on but he said no he said it'll come that see there was a lot of things added to and taken apart no what happened we get what I'm talking about I went back to something that I could take it's a foundation that I could follow and understand and read but then when people started preaching the seal that became very important to me and God began to deal with me back there in about 79 and I began to study on those things began to speak on them you know I know that word is the head of the church what that prophet told him no seals covers ever doctor and okay come on show me you want to talk about it let's get on it marriage and divorce revealed in the sealed if you'll ever read the field seal correctly and you ever see that's that fish seal correctly of that Jews that are don't even deserve nothing yet they're given eternal life you see the greatest revelation of justification sanctification the baptism with Allah go and you'll see the opening of the marriage and divorce right out of the seals the DES rapture was revealed in the seals each one of those priests way after yet it would reveal I remember the first time that I struck a cross because I'd read it studied it but I was trying to figure out where is he getting this from and got onto the first seal learn it as they begin to read it the Prophet said it made a statement and I was working on a job that required over 40 seconds out of every minute for me to complete my job ain't kidding you took over Tony's been there some of these know it's a brother college some of them been here that know about it it spice wouldn't it Tony you didn't play around 40 seconds and I had to get ready for the next job coming and I was reading the seal book I'd turn around I'd read and I read all at once it come off that pages he said here stanza ham with a book in his hand he said it out dire about 155 somewhere run in the seal he said out Dyer goes the white horse rider sorry bud that's the Antichrist I shouted glory for 20 seconds so I got ready to the next job you see that stuck with me that first seal open right there to show you have you ever seen the Antichrist ride away from you if you hadn't you've got troubles you still tied it with him but see they eat seal as it begins to open it just opens more of God's Word more of God's Word more of God's Word you think something when I've struck that fifth seal and seeing that God would give eternal life to a group of people that hated he didn't want it that was a glorious time six seals see in tribulation but knowing it wasn't talking about tribulation for me and you because the tribulation we need is the one that might work of patience I see then I come up to it and I'm telling the truth this is much as I can tell it I come up to the seventh seal and I read that seventh seal and I stood against the block blank wall and couldn't understand I backed up laid the steelbook down again because when it when the Prophet said the Seventh Seal is the end of all thing my end was running up against the wall you remember yours when you say end it means the end that means all of it doesn't know and I knew there was something wrong with my understanding God laid to seal book down again picked it back up started reading and I took the dictionary and I looked up the word e ND you ever done that if you ever just opened up the dictionary and look up e ND I'd invite you to go home and try but don't try it with the end like that means nothing else and just means that something that's coming to a position that it can start and unfold itself when that prophet saw them filled that come up to there and it dis unfolded in this couple going on see when I studied about it and iron 82 and priests film two seals it didn't stop I kept on preaching why because it had to unveiled the word end doesn't mean falling off a cliff or running up against a wall the Bible says Christ is what the end of all things to them that believe well you know what if it ends like you're thinking you got a problem but if it ends in the basis that it unfolds to another step and that's what happened in their sealed it unfolded to another step and then when the Prophet said I'm not saying he's coming cuz I'm saying he's here well he might have been the only one in the world could said it but he meant it and it was true now go home and look up the word come you know we looked up the word come just look up the word come when you get home the word come doesn't mean that I'm saying oh they're ready there won't you come to my house that's not the word come listen to what your prophet said he said it's the end of all time that's the coming of the Lord what was it the word come look it up and study it and see what you're talking about it literally means an embracing of a point to where two things have become one it literally means a husband and wife as in embracing to each other but they have become one that's what the word come means we get we're looking for it is the word covenant the Lord's coming probably said he ain't coming he says here but when he said that and I saw that I ain't never taught it since then that he's coming ain't looking for the coming of the Lord I'm looking at the coming of the Lord I see him in his word I see my violin sale he's here he ain't somewheres else what do you need a guard up in heaven hold water can help me you see that's why I said when I saw that then I had no more concern of what the headstone was but you know what back in could study it from Zechariah and Zechariah says the DISA ruble will bring forth the headstone to me that's Malachi for right but you see we're looking for the coming of the Lord looking here the other day was talking about him looking for the rats right I quit looking for the rats for a long time ago cuz I read my Bible the Bible said the dead in Christ shall rise first well I'm looking for the resurrection then the live and remains then the change what is the resurrection the Prophet said your resurrection is inside of you in your spirit see that's where we go with it no oh we got smart wait on the sphere come on you better study on that a little bit that resurrection is not in your spirit of five senses that won't work that'll kill you it's in your spirit realm of the soul of mankind its dwelling within you no divine healing no resurrection that's what's your prophecy no divine healing no resurrection yeah we're ready for the rapture oh I can just hear it there's people that say oh we were there we got caught up into so we acceptance is just ecstasy till I thought the Lord we're just gonna drop out of the sky I hope it happens that way without any what I'm looking for you know what I'm looking for in the coming of the Lord now we don't finish it up I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to come and seal in each one of us into the body of Christ with those virtues dwelling within us listen I thinking today about it see we talked about faith virtue and honor when I talk about love joy peace goodness meekness right that's the virtues but it's love joy peace goodness meeting since the Bible launchers what did he say that was number one coming to you you're a mental faith right there cut right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental faith and worse a mental faith down tomorrow making it a spiritual faith then the spiritual faith can only recognize the word of God and number two three then you'll have spiritual faith you'll have the holy spirit and we'll seal all these things into you the Holy Spirit covers this from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ he's just sealing down at the bottom he's sealing the top he's sealing up and down cuz that's what it is Church it's the Holy Ghost just it's been so miss correct we talk to people don't understand what it's about what is the whole ego the life of Jesus Christ that is the Holy Spirit that's the head of all times I'm just trying to bring it to a close think on these lines my faith all the way up to the headstone I want to be sealed in and that's requiring that I study the Word of God but just remember it's not reading the word see when God speaks to you personally there's where you got something this anchored he speaks to you personally about something shows you something personal at you that's Christ all said allotted I now live in the flesh I live with the faith of the Son of God about it do you not what about our faith where's our faith what is it anchored in that's why though they can say what they want to that's what I've told you they can say what they won't do about brother Branham I don't care I do care for their part I'm sorry for them I don't care what to say the man led me to Jesus Christ thank God for that then I'm not putting all of my hopes just on what brother Branham was a prophet no you got your hopes in your own resurrection that's inside of you something personal don't even talk to and you can talk back my brother Dale you mean God talks to you yeah through the opening of the word you talk to audible voices that's alright I've heard abortion sir like I told you when I left that Baptist Church and then when I went back by there years later I said lord I left that church and you got well well it was audible where at what it was or my own thinking something said when you left I left we I believe it I believe it the cult has always been that growth development right straight toward that one that I saw when I was 11 years old what about it come on musician think on these things I hope you'll take it on into adoption and it's auction and get it to the basis of understanding you know what this message is really called it's so wonderful to come forth and declare unto you and I that God is real he's alive he's waiting on me and you adoption times what you probably see is if when he can pour in his fullness in the baptism well I got the Holy Ghost I want more of the Holy Ghost the book of Acts read it they had many feelings they had one new birth but they had many feelings every time they gather the Holy Spirit would be there and just flirt them that's what I want well we got really [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank
