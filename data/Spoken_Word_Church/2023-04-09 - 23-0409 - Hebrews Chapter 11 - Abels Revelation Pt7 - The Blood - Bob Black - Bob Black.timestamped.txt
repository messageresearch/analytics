[0:03] foreign
[0:09] on this Resurrection morning
[0:17] let me just get these little slides
[0:18] going here
[0:23] I mean I just want to read this question
[0:25] he was coming over this morning we were
[0:27] uh we just looked over to the side you
[0:29] start thinking about things it's Christ
[0:31] rising from the grave on this day and
[0:33] everything and and uh Monica looked out
[0:35] the window and there's a little white
[0:36] dove if you know anything about doves
[0:39] seeing a white dove is really rare
[0:41] the last time we saw a white dove was
[0:43] when we were moving into the house where
[0:44] we are right now and uh so it's just you
[0:48] know sometimes just God does something a
[0:49] little special for you
[0:52] an Ephesian Church age brother Brown
[0:54] said uh because we've been we've been
[0:56] kind of meditating on uh Hebrews chapter
[0:58] 11 and we're at the at the spot in that
[1:01] in that scripture in that chapter where
[1:03] it's talking about eight the difference
[1:04] between Abel and Cain's sacrifices
[1:07] and brother Brown said in the Ephesian
[1:09] Church age he said Adam took her back
[1:11] speaking of Eve he knew exactly what he
[1:13] was doing but he did it anyway
[1:15] she was a part of him and he was willing
[1:18] to take her responsibility upon himself
[1:20] he would not let her go so Eve conceived
[1:23] by him he knew she would he knew exactly
[1:25] what would happen to the human race and
[1:27] he sold the human race into sin that he
[1:29] might have sinned that he might have Eve
[1:31] for he loved her
[1:32] and so those two sons were born
[1:35] sons that would be the fathers of the
[1:37] human race that was even now polluted I
[1:40] doesn't have something to say he's to
[1:42] the last time we were talking about how
[1:44] how polluted things got since what
[1:46] happened in the Garden of Eden we know
[1:48] that you know the real story that it
[1:50] wasn't the the reason why things are in
[1:52] the situation they're today they are in
[1:54] today is not just because somebody ate
[1:56] some kind of a fruit like a like an
[1:58] apple or a pomegranate but because these
[2:00] things in the Bible that we read about
[2:02] are symbols the whole the whole book of
[2:04] the Bible throughout is the book of
[2:06] symbols The Book of Revelation as the
[2:07] book of symbols when you read it and you
[2:09] look at the four creatures and the seven
[2:11] churches and all these things they're
[2:13] symbols they're symbols of things that
[2:15] really happen
[2:16] and we know that eating that eating that
[2:18] fruit is a symbol of something that
[2:20] happened and so Abel
[2:22] uh as we get to verse four Abel Abel had
[2:26] a revelation of what happened and Cain
[2:29] had an intellectual understanding that's
[2:31] why they came with different sacrifices
[2:34] let's just pray before we get into our
[2:36] study well God we're so grateful to be
[2:38] able to gather around your word and
[2:39] study these things out this morning and
[2:41] and and look into your scriptures Lord
[2:43] and Lord we just come this morning Lord
[2:45] to be helped Lord God and I pray Lord
[2:47] just bless us Lord as we prepare our
[2:49] hearts for the for the main event as
[2:52] brother Chris long is preparing Lord
[2:54] Jesus to bring us the word we've come
[2:56] with hungry hearts Lord Jesus and we're
[2:58] expecting Lord to be fed we're expecting
[3:00] you to give us what we have need of this
[3:02] morning and I pray God as you'll just be
[3:03] with us today we ask your blessing Lord
[3:05] and your name
[3:07] so verse 4 says and by faith Abel
[3:11] offered unto God a more excellent
[3:13] sacrifice than Cain
[3:15] let's see y'all excuse me by which he
[3:17] obtained a witness that he was righteous
[3:19] God testifying of his gifts and by he
[3:21] being dead yes speaketh now you you we
[3:25] we've kind of been dwelling a lot on the
[3:26] difference was Faith are you thinking
[3:28] about faith
[3:29] faith is a revelation and faith is how
[3:33] you know which way to go uh you you know
[3:36] what you think about any many of you in
[3:38] here might be making decisions and
[3:39] things in life Faith everything's got to
[3:42] be based on a revelation of what what
[3:44] you need to do that's why Abel brought a
[3:47] sacrifice a lamb as a sacrifice because
[3:49] God revealed him what he needed to do
[3:52] that's why Noah built a boat because God
[3:55] revealed what he needed to do that's why
[3:57] Abraham turned around and started going
[3:58] a different direction in his life
[4:00] because God revealed what he needed to
[4:02] do that's why you go to a certain church
[4:06] or pick a different job or pick a wife
[4:10] or a husband is because if God not just
[4:14] oh if we could if we could base our life
[4:16] not just some something we think is a
[4:19] good idea or something that we you know
[4:21] looking for little likes and things and
[4:22] looking for something but if we can base
[4:24] our whole life and every decision that
[4:26] we make every when we come to a
[4:28] Crossroads in life to wait for God to
[4:30] reveal it to us and that's how Abel knew
[4:33] how to bring the right kind of sacrifice
[4:35] because he waited on God to reveal it to
[4:37] him
[4:39] you know we will think sometimes that
[4:41] you know that that uh you one of the
[4:43] things ireneous and the early church
[4:45] fault against was that Gnostic idea that
[4:47] Revelation comes from something outside
[4:49] of the word that you can just go sit up
[4:51] under a tree and and not never read your
[4:53] Bible to go to church but just something
[4:55] will just pop into your head but that's
[4:57] not how it works the reason Abel had a
[4:59] revelation because he had heard he had
[5:01] heard the story of how they came out of
[5:04] the of Eden and how that God had killed
[5:06] a lamb and and and covered them with the
[5:09] blood and you know all these things got
[5:11] to turn and he began to wonder God
[5:13] surely you got to show me the way back
[5:16] everything that's the same way it
[5:18] happens today the reason when you get a
[5:20] revelation it's not just something
[5:21] something ethereal popping into your
[5:24] head that's based on you know a cartoon
[5:26] you watched or something but a
[5:28] revelation is based upon the word of God
[5:31] and you see I just want to bring it down
[5:33] to where we think is is so far out of
[5:35] our reach sometimes like like to maybe
[5:38] think to to dramatize it to the point
[5:39] where you think that that Abel you know
[5:42] didn't didn't hear got got some kind of
[5:44] special special instruction that came
[5:47] didn't or something you see right here
[5:49] sitting in this in this congregation
[5:50] this morning everybody's hearing the
[5:52] same hearing the same word preached
[5:53] everybody's got the same opportunity
[5:55] just like Cain and Abel back then you
[5:58] hear the same word priests the same
[5:59] lessons taught the sitting under the
[6:01] same tutelage and all those things but
[6:03] it depends on whether we're willing to
[6:06] wait on God for a revelation whether
[6:07] we're willing to open up our heart to
[6:09] receive from him and you see you read
[6:11] through this whole story even came when
[6:13] Abel had a talk with him Cain was not
[6:14] willing to just just humble himself and
[6:17] just do it's it's so simple almost like
[6:20] almost like that train sitting out on
[6:22] the train tracks if you just just do
[6:23] what God Said but Cain was not even
[6:25] willing to to do what obviously God had
[6:28] Vindicated when God came down and
[6:30] Vindicated what people that that Abel's
[6:33] sacrifice was correct
[6:36] but
[6:37] what Adam and Eve had done in the garden
[6:39] had set set the course for everything
[6:42] that we see and uh all the horrors of
[6:44] life and great going to the graveyard
[6:46] and because God had promised he said of
[6:48] that of the tree of the knowledge of
[6:50] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[6:51] but in the day that thou edest thereof
[6:53] Thou shalt surely die and brother Brown
[6:55] said in Oneness he said his kingdom can
[6:57] promise nothing but death Satan's
[6:59] kingdom that's all he has he's the
[7:01] author of death he can promise lies
[7:03] because he's the father of Lies he can't
[7:05] give you life he can't give you Heaven
[7:07] he has no heaven to give you think of it
[7:09] one word to disbelieve God through a
[7:12] promise of the devil or his Machinery
[7:14] one word sends you into torment
[7:17] I think that should give us Comfort
[7:19] though this morning that if we got the
[7:20] true word if the word's been restored
[7:22] then we got to get way back if if one
[7:25] word off sent them and send the whole
[7:26] world into torment then uh thank God
[7:28] that God sent us a prophet in this day
[7:30] to restore everything back so that we
[7:32] could come back and and the Oneness into
[7:34] fellowship with God the way we've got an
[7:37] understanding of the way back just like
[7:39] Abel had an understanding of the way
[7:41] back he needed a sacrifice and God gave
[7:44] us the sacrifice he gave us his word he
[7:46] gave us his blood he gave us his life
[7:49] one word off will bring death
[7:53] and that's why I've got a I've got a
[7:55] picture at you anybody know what these
[7:56] are I want to just maybe raise your hand
[7:58] this is these are the gravestones of
[8:01] Martin Luther and John Wesley because
[8:03] brother Brandon said in wisdom versus
[8:04] Faith he said that's where she started
[8:06] sinking right there that's where the
[8:07] whole human race went right down to the
[8:08] Grave from right there because she
[8:11] doubted one word one word off will take
[8:14] you to the Grave
[8:16] one word off but God has been restoring
[8:18] it he promised in Joel I will restore
[8:21] and one with the if one word off will
[8:24] take you to the Grave one more all the
[8:26] word restored will bring us out of it
[8:29] in Psalm chapter 51 he said behold I was
[8:32] shaping in iniquity and in sinned and my
[8:34] mother can see me
[8:36] in Ephesians 2 3 among whom also we all
[8:39] had our conversation in time past and
[8:42] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[8:44] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[8:46] we're by Nature the children of Wrath
[8:48] even as others
[8:50] what we'll see oh if we just meditate on
[8:53] these things that we're not we're we're
[8:55] not messed up because of just somebody
[8:57] taking a bite off of an apple we're
[9:00] messed up because of this of what
[9:02] happened uh underneath that symbol in
[9:05] the Garden of Eden that that uh Eve Eve
[9:09] polluted the whole Human Race by by
[9:11] believing one word off she she was
[9:14] unable to uh fulfill God's word in her
[9:17] womb because her womb was polluted her
[9:20] mind and her womb was polluted and then
[9:22] the whole human race got polluted
[9:24] because he said the serpent seed was the
[9:26] degradation of humanity by anger
[9:28] mingling the sea so oh you put a picture
[9:30] in your mind of how everything just got
[9:33] so polluted that our minds are polluted
[9:35] and our and our hearts are polluted our
[9:37] hearts uh where we we were born in
[9:40] carnality we were shaping in carnality
[9:43] shaping apart from we weren't brought
[9:45] into existence by by a revelation upon
[9:48] God's word but by carnal desire and but
[9:52] God has given us his word and made a
[9:54] sacrifice and made a way for us to go
[9:56] back to Deliver us from our our
[9:58] carnality to Deliver Us from all these
[10:01] things that Paul's talking about in the
[10:03] lust in Ephesians Institute the lust of
[10:05] the Flesh and the desires of the Flesh
[10:06] of the mind and and we were by Nature
[10:09] the children of Wrath even as others
[10:11] and job he said in Job chapter 15 what
[10:14] is man that he should be cleaned and he
[10:16] which is born of a woman that he should
[10:18] be righteous
[10:20] behold he put all this job talking it
[10:23] sounds a little bit depressing to read
[10:24] how he was in that state what how should
[10:26] how should I be made clean
[10:28] behold he puteth no trust in his Saints
[10:31] yea the heavens are not cleaning his
[10:33] sight he's talking about God God he's
[10:36] not putting his trust in any man he's
[10:39] not putting it even even some job's
[10:41] painting a picture so much that that
[10:43] even God looking at the heavens are not
[10:46] not clean in his sight how how are we
[10:48] going to stand in in a a a God that
[10:52] wants so much Purity how could how can
[10:54] us in our filthiness he said how much
[10:56] more abominable and filthy as man which
[10:58] drinketh iniquity like water
[11:01] laughs
[11:03] and Adam come out and he the Bible says
[11:06] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 7 and The
[11:08] Eyes of them both were opened and they
[11:10] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[11:11] fig leaves together and made themselves
[11:13] apron
[11:14] think about that's how sometimes we do
[11:16] we try to we try to patch things up as
[11:18] filthy as we are in the depravity of our
[11:20] mind and our carnality we try to be holy
[11:23] through our own works and our own
[11:24] actions and he covered himself over with
[11:27] fig leaves with his own works and with
[11:28] his own a man-made religion saying well
[11:31] I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make it
[11:33] work myself
[11:34] you see that that that'll never work
[11:40] the eyes of them both were open and they
[11:42] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[11:44] fig leaves together
[11:45] and made themselves aprons
[11:48] brother Brown said now notice then when
[11:50] Adam his fig leaves were all right as
[11:53] long as he didn't have to face God
[11:56] you think about that
[11:57] your man your man-made works all right
[11:59] as long as you don't have to face God
[12:02] but when he had to face God
[12:05] he realized his fig leaves was no good
[12:07] amen oh you see you Paul talked about
[12:10] that we we gotta we got to be
[12:12] resurrected from our dead Works uh The
[12:15] Works of it that we try to we try to
[12:17] just manufacture something
[12:19] that's not sufficient it'll never be
[12:21] sufficient where you you come to church
[12:23] and you pay your tithes and you do good
[12:25] things and you show up and you warm the
[12:27] Pew and you sing her some songs and even
[12:29] get in the spirit sometimes
[12:31] but God wants somebody that'll serve him
[12:33] in spirit and Truth to know what he's
[12:36] worshiping about that can that can they
[12:39] can get under that shed blood
[12:41] and he said and now friend you might
[12:43] think you're a pretty good person and
[12:44] you might be that's right but when you
[12:45] come to face God you're if you haven't
[12:48] accepted God's provided sacrifice for
[12:50] you you're lost and you'll know it now
[12:54] that's that goes back to the difference
[12:56] between Cain and Abel's sacrifice the
[12:59] difference between Abel sacrifice Abel
[13:01] knew he needed some blood he needed a
[13:03] sacrifice he needed the way back was
[13:05] through a life that life had to be
[13:07] shared
[13:08] and and and Cain uh Kane just came with
[13:12] trying to trying to manufacture
[13:14] something pulling some some nice looking
[13:16] plants out of the field and and bringing
[13:18] them to offer before God and God never
[13:20] offered that
[13:22] in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 it says uh
[13:25] unto Adam also to his wife did the Lord
[13:28] God make coats of skins and clothe him
[13:30] and brother said in law or Grace see
[13:32] what kind of a blood was that bled
[13:34] animals blood
[13:36] animal life for a human life it just
[13:38] can't take away sin camp now when Jesus
[13:41] come it wasn't only human's life
[13:43] but it was God's own life himself
[13:47] that's what was in his blood
[13:49] and I was sitting here this morning
[13:51] thinking about the resurrection and why
[13:53] Jesus had to die that's why he had to
[13:56] die to pay for our to pay for our
[13:58] impurity for our degradation our our
[14:01] carnality the mess that we had got in to
[14:04] bring us back into fellowship with him
[14:06] that's that's what Easter Sunday is
[14:07] about
[14:09] brother Ram said in the law having a
[14:10] shout out now when as I read this quote
[14:12] this is where brother Brandman I think
[14:14] in the next sermon he looked back and he
[14:16] said as he was preaching this he was
[14:18] actually seeing a vision of it unfold
[14:20] and he said he said there when Adam
[14:22] sinned the most horrible thing I can see
[14:25] is that day when them children sinned
[14:27] and God called them out behind the
[14:29] bushes and throw them in Old bloody
[14:31] aprons in there there stood his Heritage
[14:33] his own children standing there look at
[14:36] Eve around that beautiful body of hers
[14:38] is wrapped in Old bloody sheepskin the
[14:40] blood running down off her like that and
[14:42] dripping down her perfect shaped body
[14:44] there's Adam standing there not a brute
[14:47] a perfect made man his muscles and his
[14:49] arms the muscles and his big legs his
[14:52] shaggy hair around his shoulders his
[14:54] dark beard hanging a perfect man look at
[14:56] that now he's saying look at that now
[14:58] because he's seeing it
[14:59] look at that now I see his shoulder
[15:01] stooping around his big body Here Comes
[15:03] an old bloody sheepskin running down
[15:05] those big manly legs comes blood
[15:09] tears is dripping off his big cheeks
[15:11] patent on the top of Eve's head as she
[15:13] leans over on his bosom and little Eve
[15:16] crying the tears patting down as it
[15:19] mixes with blood
[15:20] running down her bosom what's the matter
[15:23] Something's Happened they can cry now
[15:26] they're mortal now they're dying now
[15:30] there you are
[15:32] now doesn't that paint a picture that
[15:33] that we all need a savior we all need
[15:36] somebody that's because we can't have
[15:38] any confidence in your flesh of where
[15:41] you came from in your natural genealogy
[15:43] but what we can have confidence in and
[15:45] what is what Christ did for us that his
[15:47] life was shed so that same life could
[15:49] come back and live in Youth and
[15:51] Tabernacle himself in you in Romans
[15:53] chapter 3 it says what then are we
[15:55] better than they no and no wise for we
[15:57] have proof both Jews and Gentiles
[16:00] everybody everybody's all under sin as
[16:03] it is written there's none righteous no
[16:05] not wonders nobody can boast to where
[16:07] you come from or or your heritage or
[16:09] anything like you we're all we're all
[16:10] guilty there's none that understand this
[16:13] there's none that seeketh after God they
[16:15] are all gone out of the way they are
[16:18] together become unprofitable
[16:20] there is none that doeth good no not one
[16:24] in Romans verse chapter 3 verse 23 he
[16:27] said all have sinned and come short of
[16:30] the glory of God
[16:32] and in chapter 5 verse 8 he said but God
[16:34] commendeth his love toward us and that
[16:36] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[16:39] for us
[16:40] it seems like sometimes we just hammer
[16:42] on those things that we all need a a
[16:44] savior but because it you know even in
[16:46] the day that when Noah priest before as
[16:49] he was building that Ark it seemed I'm
[16:51] sure he wondered why people didn't run
[16:53] to the ark it's so difficult sometimes
[16:55] to convince people that they need a
[16:57] savior that they're not where they need
[16:59] to be and see that's the difference
[17:00] between Abel and Cain and Cain came with
[17:02] his with his his it looked like a good a
[17:05] good religious experience Balaam came
[17:07] with the same altars and all the all the
[17:09] things you could compare with the way
[17:10] that Israel worshiped but yet there was
[17:12] something lacking Abel came with a
[17:15] revelation a revelation and if we can
[17:18] come if oh if God can touch our hearts
[17:21] with a real revelation of who he is and
[17:23] and and draw us if you can begin to
[17:25] realize this morning that God is
[17:27] speaking to you that God wants to save
[17:29] you and God wants to change you then
[17:31] something began to take take place
[17:36] Jesus made God made that promise in
[17:39] Genesis chapter 3 I will put enmity
[17:41] between thee and the woman
[17:44] and between thy seed and her seed they
[17:47] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[17:49] bruise his heel you think what a comfort
[17:51] that should be to this this morning
[17:53] thinking here on Easter Sunday that God
[17:55] made that promise thousands of years ago
[17:58] that he's going to do something as they
[18:01] were going out of the out of the Garden
[18:02] of Eden
[18:04] covered in covered in lambskins he made
[18:07] a promise I'm going to put enmity I'm
[18:09] going to there's going to be a battle
[18:11] wage between the good and the and the
[18:13] wrong between the right and the wrong
[18:15] I'm a enmity between thee and the woman
[18:17] and between thy seed and her seat and
[18:20] and there's the main the main point that
[18:22] we're talking about this morning that
[18:23] the serpent had a seed
[18:25] and the woman had a seed that God gave
[18:28] her a seed and he said it that woman's
[18:31] seed shall bruise thy head and thou
[18:34] shalt bruise his heal the serpent seat
[18:36] will Brew the
[18:38] Christ on the cross as he died and he
[18:40] made that promise that he's going to do
[18:42] something about it about that situation
[18:44] and then the message expectation he said
[18:47] tonight with our Throne blessings in our
[18:49] heart by his grace to know that we were
[18:51] Sinners and he came and took our place
[18:53] and died as a sinner
[18:55] died in my place he died my death at
[18:59] Calvary
[19:00] he died all of our deaths at Calvary and
[19:03] the sin my me as a sinner he represented
[19:06] me in his death at Calvary he
[19:09] represented every believer tonight in
[19:11] his death at Calvary and God reconciling
[19:14] us and his love to us raised him up
[19:17] again
[19:18] for our justification
[19:20] if we have confidence in what he did
[19:23] I want to just kind of take a little
[19:25] deviation you see we it says that the
[19:28] woman's it talks about the woman's seed
[19:30] and and the serpency there but what
[19:32] about Adam see do you see you can't have
[19:34] confidence we're not basing our
[19:36] confidence on where our flesh came from
[19:38] this morning but we're covering our
[19:40] confidence is based on what Christ did
[19:43] for us because in First Corinthians it
[19:45] says for as an Adam all die Adam Adam
[19:47] stepped out knowing where the the human
[19:50] race and everything what would happen
[19:52] and he he understood that his action
[19:55] would put everybody into a bind
[19:57] so when Adam all die even so in Christ
[19:59] in Christ shall all be made alive and in
[20:03] Galatians chapter 3 it says now to
[20:05] Abraham and his Seed where the promises
[20:07] made he saith not in the seasons of many
[20:09] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[20:12] Christ that seed is the one I want to be
[20:15] part of
[20:16] Romans 8 29 says for whom he did for no
[20:19] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[20:21] to the image of his son that he might be
[20:24] the firstborn the firstborn among many
[20:27] brothers now you say well I'm born of
[20:28] Adam I'm born of this one or whatever I
[20:30] can trace my lenians this way or that
[20:31] way I can trace my linear as my
[20:34] spiritual lineage back to Jesus Christ
[20:35] because he was the firstborn among many
[20:38] brethren and Titus says avoid foolish
[20:41] questions in genealogies and contentions
[20:43] and striving is about the law for they
[20:46] are unprofitable in vain it's
[20:48] unprofitable to talk about genealogies
[20:50] and those sorts of arguments and
[20:52] contentions but what's profitable is to
[20:54] know that you've been born again that
[20:56] his life has been has been tabernacled
[20:58] in you and it's starting to change you
[21:00] from the inside out like brother Chris
[21:02] was preaching yesterday that God's
[21:04] Building the body as you as you hear the
[21:06] word something's happening on the inside
[21:07] of you God has taken you over and
[21:10] changing you
[21:11] so what about Adam's seed if brother
[21:13] said in the Ephesian church if you said
[21:15] if the seed of the woman was a man-child
[21:17] apart from the man in other words Adam
[21:20] didn't have nothing to do with that man
[21:21] that was born Cain then the seed of the
[21:24] serpent will have to be in the same
[21:26] pattern
[21:27] sorry I got that backwards the seat of
[21:30] the woman is Christ was a man child
[21:31] apartment a man in the seated serpent
[21:33] will have to be in the same pattern and
[21:35] that is another man another male must be
[21:37] born apart from human male
[21:39] instrumentality
[21:40] in other words Cain didn't have nothing
[21:43] to do with Adam
[21:44] and and there wasn't a man that had
[21:47] anything to do with Christ being born he
[21:49] was born completely apart of Joseph had
[21:51] nothing to do with it he his birth had
[21:54] nothing to do with with any any male any
[21:57] man touching the situation
[21:59] that's where our confidence is this
[22:01] morning
[22:02] in Philippians chapter 3 he said for we
[22:04] are the circumcision Paul's speaking
[22:06] again which worshiped God in the spirit
[22:09] not in the flesh and rejoice in Christ
[22:12] Jesus and have no confidence in the
[22:14] flesh and I got a little picture of on
[22:15] the left of that kind of illustrate the
[22:17] difference between your carnality and
[22:20] something on the inside that's taking
[22:21] place as you hear the word
[22:23] though I might also have confidence in
[22:25] the flesh Paul's speaking now if any
[22:28] other man thinketh that he hath aware of
[22:30] he might Trust In the Flesh I'm more
[22:32] Paul's laying out a situation he said I
[22:34] got a lot of stuff I can trust in as far
[22:37] as my genealogy and how I'm keeping the
[22:38] law and all that stuff just in my flesh
[22:41] I was circumcised The Eighth Day of the
[22:43] stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin
[22:45] and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching
[22:47] the law of Pharisee boy that's a lot of
[22:49] bullets that you could tick off that you
[22:51] could have a lot of confidence in your
[22:53] flesh of how you were born and the tribe
[22:56] you were part of and when you were born
[22:58] and all those kind of things he said
[23:00] concerning Zeal persecuting the church
[23:02] touching the righteousness which is in
[23:04] the law blameless but what things were
[23:06] gained to me those I counted loss for
[23:09] Christ
[23:10] is the thing we should be after
[23:14] Christ is the main thing I have no I
[23:16] think we could all say this morning I
[23:17] have no confidence in the flesh I have
[23:20] no confidence in my own abilities and my
[23:22] own Works in any kind of fig tree I can
[23:24] hide myself behind fig leaves that I can
[23:27] cover myself with I have no confidence
[23:29] in the actions that I do to try to be a
[23:31] good person because it's not being about
[23:33] a good person I want to be a Christian
[23:35] the only way to be a Christian is to
[23:37] accept what Jesus did on this day two
[23:40] thousand years ago that he died for you
[23:42] so that he could come and live in you
[23:46] [Applause]
[23:50] you see what he did
[23:52] fulfilled what types and what Moses
[23:55] types thousands of years ago in the
[23:58] wilderness says he said let's let's make
[24:00] a serpent and a bronze serpent that's
[24:02] lifted up as John in John chapter 3 you
[24:05] said as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[24:07] the wilderness even so must the son of
[24:09] man be lifted up that whosoever
[24:11] believeth in him should not perish but
[24:13] have have eternal life
[24:15] and then that famous scripture for God
[24:17] so loved the world that he gave his only
[24:19] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[24:22] him should not perish but have
[24:24] everlasting life
[24:25] what was Jesus doing when he was lifted
[24:28] up on that cross he was fulfilling that
[24:30] type in the Old Testament taking
[24:32] everything that the serpent had done had
[24:35] taken all of your guilt and all of your
[24:37] shame and all of your degradation and
[24:39] all of your all of your iniquity on
[24:42] himself
[24:43] and being he was lifted up on that cross
[24:45] to die for you so that you wouldn't have
[24:47] to die
[24:48] and in the Old Testament as as the type
[24:51] you're looking at the type all they had
[24:52] to do to be saved would just look at
[24:55] that bronze serpent I hope you see so
[24:57] many today just won't just won't look
[24:59] just won't look at what Christ did for
[25:01] us the greatest evidence of love that
[25:04] could ever be displayed was when Christ
[25:06] lifted up and was lifted up on that
[25:08] cross to die for everything you've done
[25:10] everything you didn't do everything
[25:12] everything that you just you just
[25:14] inherited as part of that sin curse that
[25:16] came down from the Garden of Eden just
[25:18] just because you're in this messed up
[25:20] human condition that he died he died for
[25:23] you and if you can be that you can be
[25:25] delivered from that if you'll just look
[25:27] to him look to him and believe and
[25:30] accept what Christ did for you this
[25:31] morning amen
[25:33] we'll just end on that as I pray that
[25:35] our hearts are prepared for the for the
[25:37] message this morning God bless you and
[25:39] think upon this Resurrection morning
[25:41] what Christ did for us today
[25:44] thank you
