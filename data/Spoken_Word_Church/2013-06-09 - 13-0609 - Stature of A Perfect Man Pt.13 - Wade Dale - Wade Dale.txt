TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh seven four verse 7. good to have everybody back that was gone did they have bells that are here here and then now next Sunday I'll be doing this but the next two Sundays you'll make it here a lot of stuff no he's fine well he's got two weeks next Friday when I was flying out give it to yourself where are you going okay going to Kansas I don't know I'm going to Oklahoma one brother Claude we got a they have a Minister's meeting at brother Frank prater's on Saturday so they invited me to come not the three but to come so we're fun you're not gonna say anything well sure I'll say God bless you Brothers but now Clyde's speaking at The Minister's meeting on Saturday and then I'm preaching for him on Sunday then the next weekend we're going to be at Doug Scott so that'll just be a one day trip but the wonderful keeps in Kansas because we always flew into Kansas and drive the clogs but the AirTran doesn't go to Wichita anymore so we had to fly in the Tulsa thanks to Delta Airline and brother Benny you weren't around nowhere but we could find you to get any tickets from you so that's all right but you can see turn the camera and just point to this telephone so we had to get some I've never you know that thing right there never answered the thing I pulled that thing up here and it's nothing happens so we got it from some stranger down in at Delta gave us two tickets don't even know his name Benny said I got six tickets you want two I said yes so anyway so we'll be flying out to Tulsa next Friday not this coming Friday but the next Friday remember our fishing trip um all the brothers need to meet here that's going after second service for a brief meeting okay for a brief meeting immediately I have to take a service yes um also remember my buddy Claude Jr just sent me a text and he is running a very high fever he has a urinary tract infection again and he's heading to the doctor so they couldn't get his temperature down so probably they're not having services this morning so just keep him in your thoughts you don't have to it's called diabetic yes very very much he's been diabetic since he was 14 years old he's 58 years old now so oh wow he's lived a lot longer than they said he would so he was a severe diabetic at 14. no come to find out he went fishing a few days ago the last two days Ginger said and he didn't drink hardly anything so he got a new boat for his birthday so I just got some stuff for her to duty um that's part of that okay that I'll find out the name of it well Martin sent him some colloidal silver but I think he took all that up back when he was sick the first time he got better and then I guess now if you're diabetic and you need detox every night and stuff finishes do a castle okay so I'll get the name of it eating a bottle of before you go okay just remember the people out there they have a hard time because they have no other preacher to preach so nobody close by so I don't know what they're doing for service but just remember them Ephesians 4 verse 7 we're going to take a little different angle because I still I want to get started on faith but I still want us to be established and grounded in like last Sunday we were talking about the order of how brother Branham preached uh our last Wednesday night also the key and then then preached the key was faith and then preached statue of perfect man then preached my guide then he preached damn 70 weeks and then you could see how God was laying that in order well that's the way you and I are going to have to understand Church ages is a doctrinal point of a message right when you pick up a church age book and you you know a lot of people hand the church age books to a new convert or somebody you want to explain the message to you hand them a church age book well in that church age book what it has all the foundational doctrinal points of one God water baptism no eternal hell and all those things and brother Brown breaks that down plus he brings the church ages together and shows how each her takes messenger had a had a a message and then there was a group of people locked away with that message so see there's your foundational and that's what he preached in 6061 and there with any come in 1962 he brings statue of a perfect man in he brings Daniel 70 weeks and that's what I'm saying about our understanding our understanding of of should be if brother Brown had to understand it that way then you and I are going to have to not exactly the way he did but we're gonna have to put it in that order because once you put it in an order I see that it's more simple than just everybody won't know what the seals are when you're in sure everybody knows what the letter of the seals are but do you know or have you got the foundational Doctrine down have you got the Daniel 70 weeks right and in order if not you're not the seals are not going to open to you okay so you got to go get the foundational Doctrine get that down pat then you got to come up to the key which is Faith then you got to come to Daniel to assess your perfect man showing how to get the man in order Daniel 70 weeks how to line the scriptures up then you can look at the seals as something that is part of your life that that is going to open and be revealed to you and it will show it will manifest itself once you get to that point that's where brother Graham said that was the third pull and it can't be imitated you can imitate how many people do we know been in the message a long time had the foundational doctrines right but it was by letter right you can quote it by letter but if it was a revelation they'd still be here right it was a revelation that still be here but if it was just do's and don'ts God sent a prophet don't cut your hair do cut your hair men you know the vice verses of all this or the the foundational doctrines because watch what happens then you come on up to a little bit further and you start getting into the statue of a perfect man well brother Ramsey some of them start falling off uh We're Not Gonna read it today but I have another quote where brother Brown said we see these scraps he scrap heap of ministers that go out past God's plan and you see them on the side of the road not saying that they're wrong but they just run roll around freaks to a sermon of running without a message and that if you run without a message I mean you're running but you just don't have a message behind it so there's no there's no character there's power there and power without that character power without these virtues you see what they're doing now they're discrediting the message they've been in the message sure they know the foundational document they know to see they're stuck on they're stuck on brother Branham was wrong here and this one's wrong here there and and brother fiscal lied in 1974 and you know crazy stuff like that but we see if it's a revelation then it will carry you and sure we can have a a knowledge of the seal because you can walk in sanctification for years without having the Holy Ghost and all of a sudden one day boom because look what happened you say well give me an example 12 apostle actually 11. because number 12 walked with Jesus all the way through the foundational Doctrine right the devil was there and 11 good ones he was there with him all the way up to the third pool well there was God hanging on the cross Judas couldn't take that Judas turned him down before that but Judas had the foundational adoption Judas had the preaching of the word right casting out Devils signs wonders and all that right right okay same way with a message but now remember Judas was not unconvertible he could be he could have been converted if he would have made that choice but we know he didn't make the choice because God knew it wouldn't make that choice right so but the other 11 did they but they walked in a state of sanctification and had a lot of power but not a lot of character Peter did have a lot of character when he cut the guy's ear off but now about 50 days later right Peter would have never cut that guy's ear off Peter was changed on the day of Pentecost in other words he Jesus was crucified the next day and then 50 days later came the Holy Ghost going down Pentecost so Peter was you know 51 days after that day Peter was the same person and he had the same power but he had character to go along with the power because what happened on the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room they received these virtues for their time in their fullness when they received the Holy Ghost because God had already taught him just like you and I even though it's like I was trying to say the other Wednesday night and I hope people didn't take it wrong I just I just see that a lot of people were just were parakeets or or something and we just say what brother Dale said or we just say what brother Brown said it's got to be personally revealed to you and you've got to go in the same steps you can't act like a sinner and get the and get the seal so here we got power we got power we got the word we need the character to go with it so that God can say hey you've got the power now you have the ability to handle that power right you if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the power okay but without character it's a pain but pile with characters Victor rule power with character is something that you take in your everyday life it's like I was saying Wednesday night the seals are on the front side of the book and the back in other words coming and going if you're walking in that direction your life behind you is the same as it is in front of you in other words you act the same in churches you do at work I've always said it it would be it would be funny but it wouldn't be would brother Dale to walk up every person and say bro Bob I'm gonna go spend a week at work with you this week now if he goes into a connection set and falls over with hives and sweats and maybe causing sick that week I know something's going on right yeah but if brother Neil could walk all the way through when you say well brother now well what about God he's there already see he's there already he's there with you during that time that you're doing what you're doing you know I mean uh brother they don't can't be there all the time but this this man can but this right here in the book of Ephesians we see that Paul picked it up Peter showed us what to do and to your faith virtue after getting the divine nature of God then God is going to start adding these virtues but now how are you going to get them I believe Paul brings back into a point in Ephesians 4 and he says look verse 7 but unto every one of us all right the divine nature of God remember Peter says having the divine nature of God you you've escaped the Crux into the world through lust all right well now watch what Paul's doing Paul's picking it up and telling you how to do it all right you got it but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ now that means that everybody has a measure right everybody has a measure of gifts this thing's not on again a measure of the guest man I love watch him wherefore you stay at when the when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts plural yes on demand now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the more parts of the Earth in other words he went to hell remember Priests of the stolen prison he that descended is the same also that I said it far above all Heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles he says how are you going to get this because when he says afterwards and he gave some Apostles and some Prophet some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ teal teal that's how long and it's up to you how long that teal is yours you know we're going to wait until that word tell is until I get ready to go I'm not gonna go right so kill we all do you not leaving one out till we all come into the unity of the faith same Doctrine and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man until you're working towards something all right unto the measure of the stature not statue stature is height or growth development all right of the fullness of Christ that we hint forth now henceforth in other words something happened and it's not going to happen anymore henceforth in other words when we all come to the unity of Faith all Heaven Knows the Son of God unto the perfect man to the measure the statue that we hint for be no more children in other words you won't be children if God gives you these gifts Faith versions based okay Faith you are baby but Merchant only temporation God is another kindness you have these things working in your life you're not a baby you come to a stature or a growth development because look here's where I catch my my wording on people in the message and they go up through the foundational doctrinal points and oh they can even preach them and go on but watch into the statue of a perfect man because watch what he says then we hence forth be no more children toss two and fro thank you there it is right there toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to see right there is where they fall off if they don't have the new birth if they don't have the faith in the message that they're preaching or walking or doing right there's where you're going to fall off all right let me read that one more time that we hence forth be no more children Paul's compelling us milk is good strong meat is good too all right that we in for it be no more children costume and fro don't know who this doctor's right I don't know whether this one line or I don't know where the distance got the truth or I don't know where I don't know what I need to come church today or not God's just not going to be there I'll just sit right here and you understand what I'm saying are the carriers of Life remember the store the seed the seeds the children of the Kingdom that wasn't centers that was sold that was Children of the Kingdom and the Bible said the cares of Life choked them didn't make them not a son it choked their development they didn't come to maturity because remember God was pleased with those two little ships that come out of the ground now that wasn't a bit of corn there's no way you could Harvest that corn right but Luther come up out of that ground with two shoes that dog was just as pleased with that because that started something well that's the same way with you and I when you start eating a new birth you're just too little tender young cute all right then you come up out of that and grow into maturity but look how what happened toss two and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men so it's not just one man it's men and cunning crafting this whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up there's your growth to grow up into him in All Things which is the head of the church even Christ from whom the whole body Bentley joined together and compacted all right everybody got the compacted part the compacted part if we'll read we'll probably get to it today but remember what we were preaching Wednesday about the not the two Holy Ghost but the two the difference in getting the holy ghost at the bottom of the pyramid in the top of the pyramid all right here's where it's compacted brother Brown says the Holy Ghost seals these virtues in what is compacted you take compacted dirt you can't dig it because wine it's Bentley joined it's pressed together everything's where it's supposed to be you can't move it you know water can't uh water can't move it and water can move loose soil uh that's why you don't build your house on sand is very movable all right but now talking about this right here it's not but now look who he's talking to he's talking to the Ephesians who are immature group of church very strong Church very powerful Church not even as many sitting in his room today there's 20 something of you sitting here today and they had 12. and they were a mighty powerful Church why they all had the Holy Ghost you all had gifts working in their life they all had to uh Power with character all right so that's what we're looking at if 12 can have that much power and turn the world upside down look what we as 20 something people sitting here should be able to do if we come to a full mature stature of God all right from whom the whole body Bentley joined together and compacted because see you're in the body at Faith right right the divine nature you're in the body of faith but he wants that thing to be sealed so together joints and everything Maryland everything to be working as a unit from him the whole body feeling joined together and compacted by that whichever joint supplies not cutting it off not cutting somebody out no everything working together in unity according to the effectual working see and the measure of every part make it I like that word makeup you do these things remember and if we'll be reading for second Peter if you do these things they make you that you'll be established in the knowledge of God right they'll make you they'll literally transform you that's what you want you want something because you know what the creatures of habit human beings we have to be made to do so why do you think that Bell had to go off to make people go upstairs where they should have already went but but it's human I mean look outside we got speed limits we're all governed by somebody making you do something whether you think you're a free country or not you go try to get a permit to build a building outside of your house and it don't conform to the code of that of that area you know what they're going to tell you no you can't do that or you got to build it a certain way well if they make you do that for a certain reason well the Bible I know it's all by grace and it's all by love but love look how many times the Bible says make it will make you what it's doing is giving you a promise that if you'll do this it will make you conform to this all right and you won't have as much of that to and fro and and am I right and am I wrong and and all that just do the simple thing this if you do the simple thing God promised if we never fall according to the eventual working in the measure of every part don't be a don't don't think you're a a heart when you're a pinky that's why you got to find your place we got all these people that that they they come in a message and 20 something years old and like Daddy said they'll read one book and they want to be a preacher if I was a minister or a pastor in that church I would absolutely grill that child in a lot of things before I'd let that child ever do any of that and I said child because you see a lot of young kids out here just preaching and all they got to fire but they don't have a whole lot of wisdom and they don't have a whole lot to say as far as that but just like this here it says some apostles so if you if you find out you're an apostle stay in that group Pastor stay in that group evangelist stay in that group look brother Brown says when we know who we are and what we're doing here right what if I know I'm a pinky can I listen everybody wants to be the heart everybody wants to be the brain most everybody wants to be the mouse but there is this little thing right here and you know what the other day just for a carnal illustration my two fingers right here were too fat to fit in a little hole to get something I stuck my old Pinky in there and pulled it right out all right well that was important if I didn't have that little pinky Brother Ray I'd have one got a screwdriver but God gave this to be used you couldn't pinky swear without one of these you understand what I'm saying though yes but if you are if you are like like take for example sister Gabby she's here and she's got her children part of them well she got all three of them one two three I know where the other one is got four most of the time right right yeah you know if if her position is to be the mother of those three children raise them in the ablation of God and and I love her to death because because she's solid in what she believes but you know what she don't have to go out here and tell everybody you don't have to come in every Sunday and tell him no and you know what if that's the position that God put her in and she feels safe and able to work in that position she's just as much of a witness she's just as much as a preacher more than so if she stays where she is and if I'm in my own place more so than her being her place gosh more please than for me saying well I'm gonna start evangelizing I'm gonna be in evangelist I'm gonna quit teaching I'm gonna be in abandoned I'm gonna go out and just tear the world apart yeah you might go out there about three or four weeks but then you won't be there no more so find out your position have you ever asked what am I doing in this church well what am I doing in my community why did God move me over here why did I do this or that or the other have you ever asked him that oh you need to ask him that sometime you know and for those of you on the internet there with both children yeah I I was not I always wondered where where you were supposed to put the emphasis on the sentence that says he gave some a process should you put it on some he gave some Apostles some profits or some people having a some people that's right but now remember like I told you it's got to work like a unit like five fingers that's a five-fold minutes he's got five fingers all right but now sometimes my thumb is more important than my pointing finger right so sometimes this is what I need sometimes this is what I need I hope I never use that much the world likes to use that one but this one and this one you understand some how many of you enjoy teaching we all enjoy teaching minutes because that's that's what we're we've been grown under but now what if you had an evangelist every single Sunday that's where he gave some you'd move right here hey look nothing on the internet again nothing against evangelist at all that's right they have their place absolutely they have their place brother Brown said evangelist comes in stirs the people up gives them the word and leaves right then the pastor comes along and takes that word maybe and I'm talking about maybe just one word that Sparks in your heart God puts it in brother Dale's heart to expound 30 sermons on it right right that's right and that's what we're doing when he gave some he gave something you couldn't stand Apostles all the time you couldn't stand prophets all the time right right it's not that you can't stand it's just we all have individual individual needs and wants we need an evangelist maybe once a month or once every two months come in stir the gift up and then leave do it no it's not a plan there's no way an evangelist wow should be a faster because it's a gift it's a different gift look look where the Bible says look he gave some apostle right and some profits separated and some what evangelists when I look down at the bottom he didn't say some pastors and some teachers they said some pastors and teachers puts the two together because if you'll read over here somewhere else in the in the Bible it only lists like four somewhere in the but it puts the two together because because really actually a pastor can fulfill all five gifts at once at a certain time but he don't need to do it all the time okay on the PCS indeed in the church he'll be in evangelist maybe one service okay somebody comes in with you know acting up or whatever but but because the pastor has to be the one that's there every day every hour every day and he can teach because you got the pastor and teachers together all right because honestly a prophet is not made to be every Sunday get up in the same group of people the people couldn't handle it because he'd have a discernment or he'd have this or or he would be something that would that would um scare you to death I guess sometimes he's needed somewhere else too absolutely because you got to understand these people are not five preachers in one church right you can have five of these preachers in one church but that abandons this kind of evangelize in the same church he's not an evangelist then evangelist means to go out an apostle means to go overseas you know a prophet means to come in have a word for the people call out the sin of the people individually or as a group and then move on but now pastor and a teacher can stay there see that's why honestly they when we're getting off but let's just fill our time up with this because this is what's going to do this and you've got to understand what you need you gotta understand what you need and Paul's telling us we need all five of them for the perfecting of the same so that's this is the perfecting of the Saints statue of a perfect man right but you take the gifts that God's given us you give us a fine full ministry and he give us all these things but you take a a prophet would be one that would that would you know hear straight from God come out bring a message then go somewhere else uh you don't see too many of those you see some that fulfills that office a little bit but if you stay in that office you've got to be going it's like dad's always said with a five-fold Ministry in the economy of God if you take a five-fold Ministry and do it the way it's supposed to be done you can send evangelist out and he ain't gonna live enough a shack and make 200 a week right what's happening is we got pastors that go out and preach a lot and that takes the part of the Evangelist because the evangelists listen when that's why under bands looks like brother Joel could you imagine I mean I preach maybe a four or five places a year sometimes multiple places but could you imagine bro Joe Forney told me he preached it 88 different churches in one year 88 different churches now there's only 52 weeks in a year if you just preached on Sunday that's just 52. every Wednesday's 52 he's got the same thing the 88 different places if he'd come here like two times a year but 88 different places in one year you know why sure he was on he was in demand but you can't just go preach on Sunday and make a living I mean Jewel makes a living just off of what the people pay okay I don't know if both him give them any or not and that's none of my business but some people will evangelize out of a church and they'll give him a little bit of a salary to kind of Hell by but you take an evangelist that comes in here and into pure evangelist he lived off what you give him and let me tell you something I don't see how they make it I mean you go to church and preach and they give you a hundred dollars and it cost you about 200 to get there right figure that out you need a bigger watermelon truck you can't make it enough and I know it's not all about money but what's happening is pastors are evangelizing and taking that part out of the money in the evangelists and also when evangelist comes they don't have enough to pay them because they don't keep up with their own ties so that they can pay them to a minister but but that's neither here nor there we I believe we do it right here at this church so I believe we can we can handle that but I'm sure if Jewel said that he went to one place and they gave him like I wrote him a check for eighty dollars and it bounced the brother asked him about a month later if he'd come preach for him he said well brother you need to make up this bad check oh I'll make it up you come back preach and I'll write you another one y'all didn't go back but you see you want to talk about that you're going to get perfected though when an evangelist can't evangelize this is my point when an evangelist came evangelize he's got to go get a job and it ain't bad to get a job but if you're evangelized if you're an evangelist you need to be out there in the field in a different places preaching that's just the one on evangelist there yeah all right an apostle one cent okay you send one to you send one to you send one you're sending them across the world or wherever and I don't see why in the world that they don't have an apostle that would that would stay in a place for a while because an apostle is one cent over to a place not just to evangelize he sent there to help the people grow up but then you got the teacher well here's the teacher nobody wants a teacher except your own home church and not saying that because I'm a teacher but I can see it in many places you go to place and preach and and the people just absolutely just crowd around you like your uh uh you know like you're a rock star Jim said it many times but the pastor don't ever ask you back you know why a little bit on jealous side well you know what's he doing but what's she doing though he's killing his people that's the point I'm trying to say he's killing his people starving them to death malnourished good Christian sitting in the church hearing nothing but evangelists and then you know this and then hear that but you never hear a teacher the teacher does more of showing you where you are with God because that's what the teaching and the preaching and teaching that I hear is that it shows me where I'm at and what I'm lacking with God so that's how we're to be perfected is to and I'm not thrown off on any Pastor some pastors can't afford because they got little beef Roots but I'd find a way to get my people to have an evangelist somehow some way and you know what God said he'd make a way because you can't get perfected without all five all right so God Will Make A Way that's where you got to rely on God and say God you're the one who's going to do it bring that guy in and we'll give them to our people but here we don't have that problem but I see people starving to death well how do you think they're going to make this statue a perfect man how do you think the Saints are going to be perfected if they don't have all five folds and not just all five in one person can't do that you gotta have a five-fold Ministry all right just think about that until next Sunday and then we're gonna we're going to start with face is the key foreign
