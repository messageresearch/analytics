========================================

pray for me also teaching the Sunday school class here this morning so I'm continue on my love lesson series All About Love especially love of God but just love in general um and this one is going to be a lesson on passion and um so um I want to uh stress the point right off the bat that there's a lot of things uh that passion can mean and a lot of things I'm talking about and some I'm not I'm not really talking about lustful beastly passion I'm talking about our passion and our love for Christ primarily and then love for spouse love for children love for one another to be passionate about it means to be sincere you know to really put your heart into it and uh so let's uh let's keep that in mind and I'm also going to have to back up and review last lesson so um so I'll be short on time but I'll just try to get all I can in there and let's pray over this lesson Heavenly Father we pray just help me Lord in teaching this lesson and let it be a blessing to your people here Lord and those that hear uh later on on the internet and uh just give me the the right things to say Lord that uh be an encouragement to everybody and help us Lord to be more passionate in our service to you and in our love for you and for one another and um as we live in an age Lord where love is grown so cold among so many father help us to just burn with passion and love for you and for one another and for our families and everything else in Jesus name amen so uh first of all just few definitions as I said there's a lot of things passion can mean but just just to name a few definitions here of course we know it means the suffering of Christ between the night of the last supper and his death so has to do with suffering also there is a level of emotion involved with passion um it also means an intense driving or overmastering feeling or conviction Ardent affection or love a strong uh liking or desire for or Devotion to some activity object or concept so that includes you know we all have passions and loves for hobbies and things in life um you know that we can think of and there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't put that before the Lord I might I might refer to that for an example here in a little bit if I get time and then also an object or desire or uh or deep interest and to lack passion is to be cold formal or indifferent so that's kind of like the opposite of passion just to kind of stress what I'm talking about here and what I'm what the opposite of that would be in Christianity a lack of passion is powerless religion having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof second Timothy 2 um in Revelation 3:16 I believe that's to the L to seene ages I recall so then because Thou Art lukew warm and neither cold nor hot I will spew the out of my mouth in our day people are kind of just indifferent about everything they just don't care one way or another you know serve Christ or not you know it's just an age of indifference indifference toward one another indifference toward God and so let me stay on that slide just for a minute before I review my last lesson so um this is kind of a self-reflection well really all these lessons I'm teaching about love are a self-reflection so think about as I teach this and whether you are passionate or not whether you have this passion I'm talking about this Burning passionate love for God and for your fellow men um as uh I think of passion this last Sunday I was standing up here and thinking of this whole cloud of very passionate men that were up here of all these ministers brother Dale was up here brother Wilson brother Harris and all of our other ministers and to thank of all these men who are so overcome with passion in their lives for Christ for his bride for the word of God and it was uh it was a very inspiring moment to me to be up here and be a part of that but those are examples of some men that I can name but then there are many in the congregation it's not just not just ministers that can be passionate as leoty too now one example that always stands out in my mind is these widows and widowers that even though the Lord took their spouse home they came right back to church the next service kept right on serving God to me that's an inspiration and example of passion so in love with the Lord that you just won't stop that's passion it comes from a sincere heart a genuine love that produces passion so I go back to reiterating the point of first fall in love with Christ and then the passion will come you don't really have to make it happen per se you just fall in love with the Lord It's a real simple process and you'll be passionate if passion is what drives you through your prayer closet it's what drives you to fast and pray and to trust in God in times of Temptation and trials it's if I could sum it up I would say passion is love and action let's just sum it up that way the best definition I can think of passion is love and action so reviewing my last lesson I talked about how a beautiful picture I think it would be as I was on the subject of putting Christ in marriage how if let's just suppose this is a boy and a girl here in the lap of the Lord and they come to the Lord at an early age in life and they give their heart to him and serve him in their youth then they come to the age of marriage and they get married and they put Christ in their marriage walking forward with the Lord so then they're kind of reestablishing what was in the Garden of Eden in the original marriage was not just man and woman it was man and woman and the Lord and he was the head so Christ should be in marriage Beyond just the wedding day and that was the point I was stressing last time walk close with the Lord individually and with your spouse remove self from Marriage it's very important key in marriage and 1 Corinthians 7 just uh a brief overview Paul here is talking about once you marry of course you're distracted from serving the lord you can't fully devote yourself to him like you could when you were single because now you have your spouse but you do need to tend to your spouse you do need to be in other words passionate about loving your spouse and um as well as loving the Lord but God above all else as I reiterated point last time many many many times through this series I'm I'm trying to make sure put a difference between love for spouse and for family versus our love for God it should be infinitely more than love for anything else okay God first and our love for him is first and foremost brother brandham and uh God keeps his word don't tangle with the world or anything stat of this modern world stat of these modern theologies just look to the Lamb of God read your Bible and pray all the time that's so important and fall in love with Christ just skip on down to the highlighted point to save time this is again reviewing last the last lesson I have hid this Bible from the wise and PR and will reveal it to babes such as will believe if you want to get anything from God just be a baby open up the Bible fall in love with Jesus all these other things really come along in the journey but first and foremost fall in love with the Lord so uh identification brother B here talking about having the mind of Christ then uh we let his character be in us we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let the mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a Son of God all right so I'm going to skip this one I think I read this one last time gabrian I Reading This Love Dare book very very rich very good and I highly recommend getting that if y'all those of you who are married okay um it's a good good devotional for made couples to go through it's one for each day of the year um this one is titled love believes the best Bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things 1 Corinthians 13 this is keep in mind about your spouse but also about your love for the Lord this applies both ways deep in your heart is a room it's called the appreciation room it's where positive and encouraging thoughts about your spouse are kept or you could say about the Lord every so often you enjoy visiting this special place inside are wonderful things you've discovered about your mate and that cause your appreciation for them to increase down another Corridor of your heart lies the depreciation room and unfortunately you visit there as well inside are things that bother and irritate you about your spouse placed there out of frustration and disappointment but know this the more time you spend in this place the more your heart devalues your spouse in fact divorces are plotted here so stay out of that depreciation room kind of playing off brother John's series about finances you know Dave Ramsey teaches about debt scream and run don't play with debt when it comes knocking at your door and you get that credit card offer in the mail shred it throw it away don't sit there and put on the shelf and say I'll think about that I need a boat I need a car need this need that shred it throw it away scream from debt like avoid it like the plague he's very adamant about staying away from debt now take that into this depreciation room about your spouse or about the Lord scream and run when you have bad thoughts toward your spouse put him down just say you know what I love him her so much that I'm going to just apply Grace there I'm going to cover it over I'm going to say he or she is human you know and I'm going to just uh overcome that with love just overwhelming just layers and layers of love stay out of that depreciation room stay in the appreciation room and with God that means praise and worship that means thinking about all the good things he's given you and don't sit there and mle over you know well he let me go through this temptation or well he took this from me or that you know for at certain periods of our life we may Wonder just why Lord why' you let this happen but no he's got it in in his mind he knows what he's doing amen so skip on down where it says Love Knows about the depreciation room you know about it it's there you're you're aware that that it's that exists but it chooses not to live there love chooses to believe the best about people now we're including other people beside spouse now we're talking about one another love uh you know our brother and sisters in Christ and people we encounter even at on the job and so forth about people and when our worst hopes are proven to be true love makes every effort to deal with them and move forward as much as possible love focuses on the positive so pray to God to commit give him uh whatever issues you are worried about admit that you have no control over the issues and ask God for forgiveness for not trusting him resolve to turn any future worries into prayers and then uh Philippians 2 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ any comfort of love any Fellowship of the spirit any bowels and mercies fulfill you my fulfill you my joy that you may be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strive or vain Glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than than themselves that's that selfless uh aspect of Love look not every man on his own things but on every man also on the things of others so I'd say like this passion is blinding love is blinding love covers a multitude of sins so it really makes you blind to that depreciation room you're aware that it's there but you just Overlook it all those negative thoughts about God and about your situation or about your spouse um I read this kind of in depth last time I I'm still on review so I'm trying to just skip over some of this but let's keep on down Song of Solomon is a book about the romantic and sensuous love husband and wife should have for each other true sensuous love is a giving love not a taking love an offering of self rather than a claim to The spouse's self Ephesians 5 as the church submits to Christ so you wives should submit to your husbands and everything for the husbands this means to love your wives just as Christ loved the church he gave himself for her after our love for God nothing should take greater priority than giving the giving sacrificial love we have for our spouse this love helps us learn more about how we are to love God and in it's an example to those who are learning about love Hebrews 13 skip on down there to the Highlight part it's essential that you make a lifetime irrevocable commitment to stay married then when problems come you won't be looking for way out instead you'll be looking for a way through passion really in marriage will fix problems even if your spouse is not very passionate in return we'll say you just keep um that passionate love for them and you know and I guess you can say especially if you have like an unbelieving spouse that's the most difficult situation I can think of and that would be you know you just the the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband or vice versa you know um just keep believing keep that that Sanctified life before them and keep being passionate in your love for them now this uh lesson is mostly inspired from this passage of scripture where the two are on the road to EMAs uh the disciples there and I don't need to read it all but as they drew not to AAS uh you know Jesus showed up as he often does when you think about him when you talk about him when you worship him he comes around that's his nature okay he loves to be worshiped thought about talked about you read word he comes around okay and here's where this heartburn condition comes in not natural heartburn I started to call this lesson heartburn and I was like no that don't seem quite right I'll call it passion so we're talking about passion the reason the disci the reason the Lord came to these disciples because was because of their passion for him because they cared they were not indifferent toward him they cared and they were thinking about him and really saddened by the fact that he was crucified and thought maybe he wasn't what he what they thought he was and then he came around and started to prove to them and and prove his life and Ministry and the uh Prophecies of the Old Testament and their heart began to burn and how many times has a minister stood up here and talked about things that you can um cope with that you've experienced that you've seen in the word and then your heart begins to burn and you have this passionate love that starts to starts to rise up in you and you say I believe that I know that I've seen that I've witnessed that I I can relate to that and that's what was happening here these disciples their heart Hearts begin to burn within them and that's what I'm basically talking about is this passion why wouldn't Jesus just come to two random people walk along the street who didn't care at all about about him or about religion at all why would he even appear to them and and start talking to them they wouldn't care you know they they might they might entertain him with just by listening for a moment and say I suppose that was pretty good and keep on going about whatever they were talking about but no he comes to those who are passionate about him for our God is a consuming fire read that down there in the red I'm not to read the whole passage here but my focus here on this scripture is God is a consuming fire when you really get into him he consumes you the the he sanctifies you he he burns out the sinful nature as you come to Christ as a sinner you give your heart to him you still have all that root of evil he comes and he burns that out through sanctifying you through the washing of Water by the word and he just be begins to consume your whole being everything about you begins to be consumed with him that's that passion signs of passion just to name a few this is not at all all inclusive it's just just a few of them that come to mind you will have an intense desire for more you will not let anything prevent you from obtaining more you will be blind to the negatives and you will be fully resolved Relentless Unstoppable this is something that from my own testimony when I was 12 I gave my heart to the Lord because I realized I was a sinner something happened frankly just to be blunt neighbor boy showed me pornography magazine until that time I thought I was pretty good A lot of my friends would say Ryan you're good you don't you don't go to the principal's office except for something good which was true at the time and I started thinking well I guess I'm all right started to believe him until that happened and then I began to realize I was a sinner like everybody else and I need salvation I came to Christ for salvation I repented my sins and I meant it and then this Burning passions like a little flame began burning in me that said I'm not going to stop serving Christ if I live to be 80 100 years old I will not stop it's there to this day and it's stronger than ever that's passion that's what I'm talking about being passionate let that start in you and burn like a fire passion shows in our actions you can't hide it I want to go to the Natural examples for a minute I'm passionate about flying and if you get around me and talk with me long enough you'll know that Aviation is my passion it's one of my passion so is learning instruments Gabby's is these crafts and baking cakes and art and those type of things so many of you have hobbies and things you do and if I get around you long enough your passion will kind of begin to come out and I and I'll begin to know what you're passionate about nothing wrong with those things just saying you can't hide your passion and if you're passionate about the Lord it'll show up sooner or later somewhere it'll come out so obviously the most the greatest example I can think of of passion is the example of Christ and and his passionate love for his bride uh and dying for us while we were yet sinners Christ died for us while we didn't even care at all about him cuz at some point in our lives each of us did not care about serving him at some point if you go back far enough another great example of passion is brother Dell he stands out in my mind as one of the greatest men that I know of being an example of passionate love for Christ for his bride for the word and as uh here on the left this is a picture of General Motors uh I just Googled you know from General Motors back in the 80s but this is an assembly line there and um you thank of brother Dell all those all those years that he commuted that long commute to work making a living for his family passionately serving his family while pastoring a church and and having all that passion for for uh pastoring of church and trying to get a sermon always fighting praying seeking God for his next sermon and listen to those two tapes a day and reading those six books a day sitting with brother collie I think in that office I think in part of that time reading those books studying there was no smartphones but I mean he could have busied himself with magazines or books or you know newspapers all kind of other things he could have kept his mind on but he stayed focused passionately on the word of God because he is passionate about it um and about serving his family and and raising them and everything he did was with passion I think I remember him saying this multiple times he said it's like a fire shut up in my bones you know it's this the message of the hour the word of God when you really get it it's like a fire shut up in you and it's just burning to get out it's burning to for you to understand more of it and to express it other people Jeremiah said there but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing I could not stay go back and read that whole passage you want to know but that's just what I was talking about burning a burning passion and then uh Matthew 5 blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled I believe brother Benham said you're even blessed even to have a hunger for it you're blessed if you even want more of God you're blessed so just stay right there just keep Desiring more of God it'll come and you'll keep seeking it because of it being a passion in you what drives you to seek more truth is that passion why do others H have the same opportunity but don't desire it why is that you know why don't some people have the passion like you have just think about that there's something burning in you for more of him examples of passion as I said we all go widows and widowers in our congregation ministers teachers musicians all have this passion for worshiping serving the lord and his bride um examples of passion also your alone time with the Lord okay what do you do for him in secret you know the things you do in secret for him are out of passion you know if you um do things up here like I'm doing you know teacher Sunday school right now you might say well you're just doing it cuz you're you know asked to teach Sunday school well what about when I go home and I go when nobody's looking and nobody sees and I do these little secret things of Love out of love for the Lord and y'all know what I'm talking about y'all do these things when you read your Bible and you enter in your prayer closet when no one sees you and you just cry and pray and seek God for Revelation or cry out for someone who's sick or or in need of Salvation that's passion um but thou when thou prayest enter thy closet and when thou has has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret reward thee openly this is Brother Dell a quote from him from 2009 uh 18 September 2018 on being born again message on brotherly kindness it says so in the spiritual children you've got to eat the word of God study the word of God you know pray and seek God ask him to reveal these things to you instead of just saying oh I believe that let it be a part of you and if you have that new birth you will desire right is that what we read you'll desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby because see that will be a part of your life passion why wouldn't you want to grow in Christ why would that not be your desire to want to know more about God really fall in love with the Lord first don't just say I believe this is just me saying this I'm not quoting anybody don't just say I believe but live I believe actions speak louder than words you can say you believe but missing Church neglecting Bible reading and prayer proves you don't really believe we prove What We Believe by our actions remember brother Bob's lesson on conscience and in other words if you don't read the Bible and the message you prove you don't believe it's necessary perhaps you believe you're all right just being in the message or in Spoken Word Church take heed to brother Dell's statement I'd rather seek the Holy Ghost every day of my life and find out that I had it all along and to not seek it and die lost more or less that I'm paraphrasing what he said so because thou sayest this is a message uh to the lat agent Revelation 3 because thou sayest I'm rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou retro miserable poor and blind and naked okay I'm not going to read all the scripture but the point is that that's the condition of our age to be miserable wretched blind and naked and think that we are you know rich and increase with goods and everything some people spend their life trying to figure out what love is other people spend their life trying to express their love humans are created to love driven by Love by the god of love when you possess it you want to express it um let's see I want to skip on down here to as the musicians will go ahead and come at this time and just got another minute or so here I think I quoted that before this is from Brother Wade let me go to yeah I think this one was first now look this is from um 2023 last year September last year um now look it gave us the promises it didn't say we were going to automatically get them come on somebody come on somebody okay anyway they're there they're there to get but you got to want them You' got to get them make yourself ready whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these brother B said these promises you might be Protectors of the divine nature wherefore the rather Breen give diligence to make your calling not your pastor not your brother not your sister or your neighbor your calling find out who you are and what you're doing here calling an election sure for if you do these things you'll never fall what promise if you do these things this formula brother B said this prescription you'll never fall and um I'm just going to skip to this as my last quote here Exposition from Seven Church ages brother bam on the Ephesian age the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal so bear those things in mind and pray God give me more passion help me more passionate about my service to you that's all thank you all God bless you [Applause]
