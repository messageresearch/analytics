[0:00] all right so we're going to continue on
[0:04] birth pains and what I'm gonna you know
[0:08] my family's kind of going through
[0:10] getting the fluid and everything this
[0:12] weekend so what I'm going to talk about
[0:14] this week seems a little bit odd with
[0:17] all that going on and everything but you
[0:22] know I really want to talk about why why
[0:25] there are birthdays just last last
[0:28] couple of Sundays we just kind of looked
[0:30] at what my friends are and how they've
[0:32] been going down through the seven
[0:33] regions as each church age
[0:36] misinterpreted because each brought
[0:38] their misses and then either the
[0:39] different ministers only brought their
[0:41] message then it created birth pains we
[0:44] created a struggle and brother Branham
[0:45] explained that in the myth today and the
[0:47] message birth pangs he said the reason
[0:48] there's a fight is because there's
[0:50] there's two coming out there's a Jacob
[0:52] and Esau coming out and well there's a
[0:54] one can't quite do along with the truth
[0:57] and so what the reason for birth pains
[0:59] is because the truth is coming out and
[1:02] so when you have truth being preached
[1:04] then it creates a struggle that creates
[1:06] and it creates this this squeeze
[1:10] medicine eventually it will produce God
[1:12] it back inflicted again the son of man
[1:15] lay back in his people here and so
[1:18] really what what produces Burt birth
[1:20] pains is when the people begin to catch
[1:23] the message of what's being preached and
[1:25] they began to speak him back and that's
[1:28] why I was going through back Romans
[1:30] chapter 8 starting off with crying Abba
[1:33] fathers because that you went even when
[1:35] you come for the baby you come forward
[1:38] speaking the word you come forth saying
[1:40] I am a Christian and I believe God word
[1:42] and you say I believe the correct way of
[1:47] baptism and you start speaking even
[1:49] though you know a little baby doesn't
[1:51] click can't quite formulate the exact
[1:53] way to say things or
[1:55] or doesn't quite know what to do with
[1:57] the work but yet he's crying I have a
[1:59] father because he recognizing how he's
[2:02] born out and grow you he knows where his
[2:04] sustenance is coming from he's looking
[2:07] at the father in the face so to speak
[2:09] because he's cut as he comes forth he's
[2:11] looking at him and he's recognizing who
[2:13] he is and and he keeps any speaking the
[2:16] word because you grow old based upon
[2:17] your confession and I got a lot of
[2:20] slides here to go through but that's
[2:21] pretty much what I'm going to be talking
[2:22] about this morning as that birth pains
[2:24] are based upon the Church's position the
[2:27] churches the bride's confession and when
[2:29] the bride begins to speak it produces
[2:32] something and the brightest is is the
[2:35] word isn't being squeezed out so it's
[2:37] all based upon your confession no
[2:40] there's lots of examples in the
[2:41] scripture think about when when the very
[2:44] first one able and it will have a little
[2:48] talk with Cain and explain some things
[2:51] and it's not written in the Bible
[2:52] exactly what he explained but I think we
[2:56] can make a pretty good guess at the
[2:58] conversation that they had and whatever
[3:00] that wasn't discussed it produced a
[3:02] birth pain that produced a pain so great
[3:05] that Cain took a rock and walked him
[3:07] over the head with it and and that print
[3:10] reproduces all the way down I was
[3:12] looking at kind of studying that about
[3:13] how programs was talked about the one of
[3:16] the three woes that that war will one
[3:18] there were two or three that the earth
[3:21] is going through and and you begin to
[3:23] look at what happened in war or two
[3:24] about how that the Kristallnacht the
[3:27] night the night of broken glass when
[3:29] they began to pull Jews out of their
[3:32] homes that first night in there and and
[3:34] why were they doing that because it was
[3:36] you confession because of what they're
[3:38] going to eat because of who think
[3:40] because it was time for them to return
[3:42] back to the homeland and so all of these
[3:44] things are producing they're producing
[3:46] the pains are producing a
[3:49] a new world coming in to be getting
[3:53] everything straightened out
[3:54] and and so you with the expression birth
[3:57] pains comes from in Matthew 24:7 through
[4:01] nine with this Scripture that we're all
[4:03] familiar with but the wades gone through
[4:05] it a lot when Jesus preached the seven
[4:07] seals and and this verse 7 for nation
[4:11] shall rise against nation and Kingdom
[4:12] against Kingdom there shall be famines
[4:14] and pestilences and earthquakes in
[4:16] diverse places all these are the
[4:18] beginning of Sorrows and if you pull up
[4:21] a like on a Bible hook command where you
[4:23] can see a translation of this with all
[4:25] just about all the other different
[4:28] Bibles there's like 50 different Bible
[4:29] you can see translated side by side and
[4:32] this scripture is translated in many
[4:34] different Bible versions as the
[4:38] beginning of birth pains and that's
[4:40] where that that that comes from the
[4:42] beginning of birth pains beginning of
[4:43] Sorrows because all these things are
[4:45] producing what I've just kind of
[4:47] illustrated and then shall they deliver
[4:49] you under to be a leader and we know how
[4:52] the background the context of all these
[4:54] things but really why did they deliver
[4:57] them up to be afflicted because they had
[5:00] a confession because they believed
[5:03] something because they were saying I
[5:05] believe like in the in the days of Nero
[5:08] and the date going all the way back I
[5:10] don't believe that Nero is that is the
[5:12] true God I believe that Jesus Christ is
[5:15] the one true God and then they really
[5:17] began to kill the people for that think
[5:20] about all the times when they would say
[5:21] well if you'll just give us over your
[5:23] material your the message books of the
[5:25] day the books that had the power are the
[5:29] different writers of the New Testament
[5:30] had written just give us those books and
[5:33] then we won't kill you but yet they so
[5:36] many who were unwilling to even do that
[5:39] they stood upon the action and and they
[5:44] lost their lives because of that
[5:47] and you can just come a little
[5:49] illustration I put together just kind of
[5:51] showing some of the squeeze that's been
[5:53] taking place and you've got brother
[5:55] brown over seven the different seven
[5:58] visions the seven things that he saw
[6:00] that we're gonna have to take place
[6:01] about how Mussolini and who was
[6:03] representing factories I mean Hitler
[6:05] representing non-seasonal drives Nazism
[6:08] and then those two would would combine
[6:10] to form communism he said they wound up
[6:12] in one abysm and that one isn't will
[6:14] dominate the world and will burn the
[6:16] vatican city watch rush of technological
[6:19] advancements the car that could drive
[6:21] itself or the the bubble and then moving
[6:23] them down into a more okay a powerful
[6:26] woman who rise up and one day America
[6:27] will be in ruin and all these things are
[6:30] squeezing out to produce this a bride
[6:34] coming back to to a millennial and to a
[6:37] millennial reign it's all this is
[6:39] producing on and you can even see them
[6:40] the rise of the that going on with it's
[6:45] difficult to illustrate this but all the
[6:46] way back to the one when Paul was
[6:48] preaching and he said the mystery room a
[6:50] committee already works the Antichrist
[6:52] spirit working moving on to false
[6:54] prophet and then it comes in Carla and
[6:56] the Beast Satan incarnate sitting on his
[6:58] throne and and it mirrors what God is
[7:01] doing in his church taking us through
[7:03] the four stages to put himself back in
[7:05] human flesh birth pain that's what birth
[7:08] pains are and he said and you can see I
[7:11] didn't even realize that so Billy Graham
[7:13] and all Roberts were born in the same
[7:15] year I if you ever want to know what how
[7:20] close we are looking look at things like
[7:22] this we've got to be at the end times of
[7:25] times when something is because oh yeah
[7:29] and then oh the whole earth has gone
[7:32] through birth pains and look at these
[7:33] now and all three of these these birth
[7:36] pains for the cleansing of the earth
[7:38] that brother Branham talked about in the
[7:39] future home can and other messages are
[7:42] they they started with a man
[7:44] it wasn't us and that's really the point
[7:47] of that the birth pains come because of
[7:49] a message and because the people catch
[7:52] the message and they begin to believe it
[7:54] and they begin to speak you know what
[7:57] caught the message and he began to speak
[7:59] it and his family got there in the are
[8:03] committed and only these three things
[8:05] you know the distinctive you their
[8:06] justification of air of the
[8:08] sanctification and then in purification
[8:10] about five maybe one day will be there
[8:13] will be God's power or not may inspire
[8:15] ain't but all of these are our birth
[8:18] pains because they but the birth pains
[8:21] are taking us from the things of the
[8:23] earth the believer that the birth pains
[8:26] are doing many different things the one
[8:29] thing is they're cleansing the earth
[8:30] they're preparing the arm for the bride
[8:32] to come and walk not only cleansed earth
[8:34] where there ain't no singing but another
[8:37] is it's changing us from this earth from
[8:40] this earthly realm as you eat the word
[8:43] you come from the realms of this earth
[8:46] that's why programs the Bible says if
[8:48] you love the things of the world the
[8:50] love of God is not even in you because
[8:53] the word is taking you from the world
[8:56] and taking you from two to a is it
[9:00] seated in heavenly places in it with
[9:02] Christ Jesus in another Kingdom in
[9:05] another dimension that only your soul
[9:07] right now is in contact with one day
[9:10] with through full Redemption your your
[9:13] entire being will be in contact with
[9:16] that that other world that you're being
[9:18] birthed into and see why it's hard to
[9:22] preach it sounds like we're going to
[9:24] another world but we're gonna be here
[9:25] because God has changing this then he's
[9:28] changing this place so that we can come
[9:30] back and do it a little bit yeah and so
[9:33] what birth planes is is delivering the
[9:35] manchild which programs sat down here so
[9:38] I'm gonna get to that so let's read some
[9:39] folks delivering the manchild that seems
[9:43] like a strange thing to say that it
[9:45] because you start off with a little baby
[9:46] being born again and it grow
[9:48] and then there's got to be that manchild
[9:50] come forth and to deliver that manchild
[9:52] of a message had to come forth a message
[9:55] had to come to get the people speaking
[9:58] the same thing because that's what birth
[10:00] pains is is when that people begin to
[10:02] realize that place and who they are well
[10:06] what makes the shuffle away is when the
[10:08] people begin to clean the bride begins
[10:10] to speak again when she begins to say I
[10:13] and my father are one
[10:15] then the shuck pulls away anything all
[10:18] down through scripture you can follow
[10:19] that pattern when the people begin to
[10:21] realize who they are then when you begin
[10:24] to realize who you were that the
[10:25] denomination that you were in kicked you
[10:27] out
[10:28] and you can follow that all the way they
[10:33] said it did that all through the ages
[10:34] I'm sorry finally the church delivers to
[10:54] them a man-child that man child was the
[10:56] work itself made flesh and in the
[10:59] beginning was the word the Word was with
[11:01] God and the Word was God and the Word
[11:03] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[11:04] he conquered every devil every power
[11:07] upon the earth that come against him
[11:08] when the fathers were only every
[11:10] temptation that Satan gave him he
[11:12] repeated he rebuked Satan not with his
[11:15] own powers that he had but with the Word
[11:16] of God it is written it is written it is
[11:19] written the firm was the word and didn't
[11:21] brother Brown
[11:21] teach us but that's the same way that we
[11:23] attack the weak we direct the devil and
[11:25] in the message of harvest-time he talked
[11:28] to us about how that you defeat the
[11:30] devil the exact same way that Jesus did
[11:32] because that corn of wheat has grown all
[11:34] the way down to the church of the seven
[11:35] churches until it's right back to the
[11:37] way it was at the beginning where God
[11:39] and manifest and his people and he's
[11:41] equipped us with His Word
[11:43] come on in brother Lewis better late
[11:46] than one Satan flew against Eve she
[12:02] wasn't the word sort of failed when he
[12:04] flew against Moses it did the same thing
[12:06] but we need to enter the Son of God he
[12:08] was ten thousand volts and not the loose
[12:11] feathers out of him when he come back
[12:12] and said it's written man shall not live
[12:14] by bread alone but by every word that
[12:16] proceeds out of the mouth of God there
[12:18] was that man child made flesh God's
[12:20] eternal word himself manifested in a
[12:23] body of flesh here on earth to represent
[12:26] the word and then he says in birth pangs
[12:30] which is really where I'm getting a lot
[12:33] of this you know you know that you did a
[12:36] lot of this but you also have to put
[12:38] everything together because you can't
[12:40] look at messages and it's kind of
[12:41] discrete entities everything fits
[12:43] together like a puzzle
[12:45] so it all fits together the word must
[12:48] deliver the word broadchurch I think
[12:52] we'll think about that statement the
[12:53] word must deliver the word broadchurch
[12:56] you come from the word you're born from
[12:59] the word and you become the word and so
[13:03] the word is delivering a word bride
[13:05] church we got make those hand moves
[13:09] and the church has got to be delivered
[13:11] out for a bride for Christ then that
[13:14] fell asleep in all ages will make up
[13:16] that bride that come out on the word
[13:17] that they come out on a lot from your
[13:19] feet coming to your head and she gets
[13:20] greater and more you have to have and so
[13:23] forth as the body grows up so does the
[13:25] body of Christ grow up and then finally
[13:27] the head will come to it they hit a bit
[13:29] will now if we notice because it's all
[13:31] linked to the end and this is this is a
[13:33] this is a quote good quote I'll share on
[13:35] brother wheat Louie's last Sunday the
[13:37] head does the turning and pulling the
[13:42] head does the turning pulling now
[13:45] there's a lot that could be said about
[13:46] that you're you being thrown up you're
[13:49] being birthed by the head it's been
[13:53] pulling you guys I don't know how's it
[13:56] pulling you didn't didn't Jesus say no
[13:58] man can come to me except the father
[14:00] draw him and he's drawing you by the
[14:03] word what does that mean he draws you by
[14:06] the word he draws you by and I put
[14:09] together a lot of quotes about this that
[14:11] I don't have but the bottom line is if I
[14:13] could just share with you my revelation
[14:15] and you could God gave us a brain in two
[14:19] hands of two feet to go look in the word
[14:20] and see if it's true or not but he's
[14:22] drawn us by the revelation of his word
[14:25] because when you get a revelation of
[14:27] what the word says and you draw closer
[14:29] to him its draw and you can pulling you
[14:32] and that's what's drawing you into an in
[14:34] the image of him is is this in it and
[14:38] what is the head then is this message
[14:41] that brother Branham brought to us that
[14:43] is more than just clothes and dress and
[14:45] things like that but it's a message of
[14:48] full redemption to know who you are and
[14:51] know that God is able to redeem your
[14:53] body I can't start crying down color
[15:02] this day the scriptural fuel program
[15:05] said saying that the world is in birth
[15:08] pains now the old has to be done away
[15:10] with so the new can be born just like a
[15:13] seed has to rot away in order to give a
[15:15] new life and how the pain is birth pains
[15:18] from the world in a world once you had a
[15:22] terrific pain because they had poison
[15:23] gas and so forth that almost could
[15:25] destroy the world and in world war two
[15:28] those that she struck another harder
[15:30] pain they had blockbusters and also an
[15:32] atomic bomb she cannot stand another
[15:34] labor pain with these missiles and
[15:37] things today one more world war throw
[15:40] her out into space for she will now be
[15:42] delivered and there will be a new earth
[15:44] if you think we're not close
[15:47] III get news it pops up on my phone and
[15:50] one of the articles that popped up last
[15:51] week was that Donald Trump is planning
[15:54] or however you want to say at the
[15:55] government whatever is planning a is
[15:58] secretly moving things into position for
[16:00] a nuclear war with North Korea and and
[16:03] and so you say well that could never
[16:05] happen or whatever uh you know things
[16:08] are moving into position you're a
[16:11] brother and said now one bomb will drop
[16:13] until we are going but now how close do
[16:17] you have to be it could be it could be
[16:19] pretty close things are exactly things
[16:22] are moving too quickly and and so I
[16:25] believe that the Brian should be more
[16:27] consecrated now than ever
[16:29] something's happening of course now the
[16:31] bride is gonna know what she's not gonna
[16:34] be duped and deceived and she's gonna
[16:36] have an understanding of what's taking
[16:38] place I know her position I know what
[16:39] needs to be done with the work and
[16:42] that's what I'm really speaking of this
[16:44] morning is that a word has to be spoken
[16:47] there's got to be a people that know
[16:50] what the word says and out of her lips
[16:52] come the word that she can her
[16:54] confession is what what calls it that's
[16:58] why I mentioned last Sunday I believe
[17:00] the bride right now is preaching herself
[17:02] into a body changed because she is
[17:05] speaking a word just like that baby a
[17:09] when you come forth crying Abba Father
[17:12] you grow up and to manifest its sons
[17:15] just like Adam was in the beginning Adam
[17:18] was a manifest that son his body had not
[17:20] been changed his body needed to be
[17:22] changed but he was in the Garden of Eden
[17:24] telling the trees where to go and stop
[17:28] him snowstorm her whatever her what
[17:29] needed to be done by the spoken word but
[17:32] then there's something even beyond that
[17:35] - Adam was to wit the redemption of the
[17:38] body to understand what it takes for
[17:41] your body to be changed and when the
[17:44] pride begins to realize what that is
[17:46] then she can begin to speak it and it
[17:48] will happen yeah yeah and so look what
[17:51] I'm really getting to one of the things
[17:53] that has to be spoken is that the dead
[17:55] have to rise from the ground first
[17:58] before you can take the body change and
[18:00] so that's got to be spoken
[18:02] somebody's gonna speak it I'm getting
[18:06] ahead of myself a lot sorry but I'm
[18:09] sorry about my voice you know just hang
[18:12] in there with because this is good so
[18:21] this is what I meant about putting all
[18:22] that all the things together that
[18:24] brother Adam spoke about because if the
[18:27] birth pains come happen because the
[18:30] people are catching something because
[18:33] they're catching a revelation now what
[18:35] are they kitchen in this day we're
[18:38] catching the revelation of what the
[18:39] shout was and we know what we know
[18:42] brother ground solidly it hadn't grabbed
[18:44] her message he he explained he preached
[18:47] a sermon that was so different than
[18:49] anybody else had ever preached to
[18:52] rapture message anything about the
[18:54] rapture that and that there would be a
[18:56] shout of orders a trump command and a
[18:58] you know when I began to read that
[19:01] message the first times I look at it and
[19:03] be like I don't really know what he's
[19:05] talking about what I know
[19:09] but as you begin to study the message it
[19:11] begins to unfold exactly what is taking
[19:14] place and first of all there has to be
[19:16] for you to catch a message there has to
[19:18] be a message first and then and this is
[19:20] what produces the birth pains is this
[19:23] message that God gave us between not the
[19:27] only thing now not necessarily the years
[19:33] of preparation but when he began to
[19:35] sound his message in 1963 from 1963 to
[19:39] negative 65 that represents the capstone
[19:42] here you see that's that's what I'm
[19:44] referring to with the shell he came down
[19:46] with a shout and then then the people
[19:48] begin to catch that he said and there's
[19:53] a man here that in turn on the light the
[19:55] Luther's mana was the message of
[19:57] justification Wesley's message was the
[19:59] manifestation of sanctification
[20:01] Pentecostal was the restoration of the
[20:03] gifts but this is introducing the
[20:06] headstone the last day the bride treat
[20:08] which is contrary to all of it and yet
[20:10] it's the same life for the material and
[20:15] there's just the scripture for you to
[20:18] tell the kids that we which are alive
[20:19] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[20:21] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[20:23] and there's no reason we're not going to
[20:25] hinder them that are in the ground is
[20:27] because we've heard the shout and the
[20:29] shout is the word for this age that
[20:31] prepares us give way to all of the
[20:35] complete swage of the Spirit of God so
[20:37] that you can have preventive preeminence
[20:39] and so that there's no leaven there's
[20:43] nothing but the pure unadulterated Word
[20:45] of God to be spoken there's nothing and
[20:48] that well will provide a way for them
[20:51] which are asleep to come forward and so
[20:53] we will not prevent them went to our
[20:55] sleep they will be able to be able to
[20:57] freely come back to this dimension for
[21:00] the Lord himself shall descend from
[21:02] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[21:04] the Archangel with the Trump of God and
[21:06] the dead in Christ shall rise first when
[21:10] the showers what brother branham it
[21:13] compares right over with
[21:15] four five six but I will send you your
[21:17] line into the profit before we come into
[21:19] the great and dreadful day of the Lord
[21:20] and he shall turn the heart of the
[21:21] father's to the children and the heart
[21:23] of the children to their fathers lest I
[21:24] come and smite the earth with a curse
[21:26] and obviously I think I was a little bit
[21:29] inspired by that sermon that for the way
[21:31] preached up there brother Tim hymns and
[21:33] I forget if you preached it somewhere
[21:34] else as well but about how that the the
[21:37] message this message is literally
[21:39] turning us this message is literally
[21:42] turning the hearts of the children to
[21:44] deliver us and to make the word be
[21:48] forward is that's what that's what's
[21:50] delivery turning us literally turning it
[21:53] that's what the shout is to do is to
[21:55] turn literally turn us so that the work
[21:58] can be born in this day the shout what
[22:03] is the shout is the message going forth
[22:05] first the Living bread of life bringing
[22:07] forth the bride
[22:09] now you said what the shout is if the
[22:12] shout is a birth pain because the shout
[22:14] goes forth and it stirs up denominations
[22:16] and everybody's wondering what what's
[22:18] going on and and causes a great big
[22:20] terminal everything but like I was I was
[22:23] I was quoting the last time I was
[22:26] reading that that scripture and Ruth
[22:28] that says that Ruth was better than
[22:30] seven sons and I compared that with
[22:33] looking at the seven church ages the the
[22:37] birth pain really happens when the bride
[22:40] catches what is being asked what is
[22:42] being said that's when the when the
[22:46] people began to catch ahold of what's
[22:48] being said that's when the real can
[22:50] happen
[22:50] that's why Ruth the bride is better than
[22:55] seven sons because that's the ultimate
[22:56] goal of all of these seventeen
[22:59] messengers is to produce the Word made
[23:01] flesh again if you just have the seven
[23:04] sons and put them over to the side then
[23:06] that would be that would be all well and
[23:07] good but you would be able you would be
[23:10] without your products right right
[23:12] that's right does that make sense yes
[23:15] yeah you know that that's a little bit
[23:21] controversial today because when you say
[23:23] smiie you make statements like that
[23:25] people think that you're trying to
[23:26] diminish brother brandon will say we
[23:27] don't need a prophet anymore no we need
[23:29] a prophet more than ever we need to we
[23:32] need bill or the word we need we need
[23:34] them if we didn't have this message that
[23:36] you brought but where would we be in
[23:38] ain't we be backing out you know in the
[23:40] denominational system you want to write
[23:42] right on Almont with the rest of them
[23:45] but what the message was for was to
[23:47] catch a bride and get her to realize her
[23:50] place and and see where she came from
[23:53] where she's going who she is and all
[23:56] those other things which is why you said
[23:59] I can make a statement the bride all
[24:01] together that's the main thing the
[24:03] producing of the brightening according
[24:07] to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of
[24:09] the shooter to the fathers he will
[24:11] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[24:12] thunders in Revelation 10 which other
[24:14] relations contained to the seven seals
[24:16] it will be these divinely revealed
[24:18] truths that literally turned the hearts
[24:21] of the children to the Pentecostal
[24:23] followers
[24:24] it will literally turn us back to the
[24:26] original faith that's right this shout
[24:34] that's what I was speaking on earlier
[24:36] about when God speaks you'll come no man
[24:41] can come except my father drawls it God
[24:45] draws you then you'll come and I think
[24:50] so many times we try to reason one
[24:52] another into things but it's not by
[24:54] reason is by a revelation of the word
[24:56] not we can't beat one another into
[24:59] seeing it we put enough one another in a
[25:02] headlock we can't happen but we all we
[25:05] can do is talk to one another and share
[25:07] it well but it takes God to reveal
[25:09] himself to somebody and you know a lot
[25:12] of times you want
[25:13] just kind of open your kids heads up and
[25:15] pour for early and then hey horses
[25:16] anybody or one another but unfortunately
[25:21] it doesn't work like that and it takes
[25:22] God to speak and now you just have faith
[25:26] to believe now these things and then he
[25:30] goes only he's talking he's giving some
[25:32] kind of some examples and the anointing
[25:34] ones at the end time message and he said
[25:39] I've got lots of quotes here so I'm
[25:41] going to help me to just kind of piece
[25:42] some of these together come on with my
[25:45] saw to a tube anointed prophets how was
[25:49] the difference in them one had this
[25:50] speaking of the word and the other one
[25:52] didn't and that goes back to my earlier
[25:55] thought that the birth pains are
[25:58] bringing forth two children Jacob
[26:00] Panisse halt track one has the spoken
[26:02] word one didn't now if you go back and
[26:04] look up Hananiah when they came against
[26:06] the jeremiah he was he had a very
[26:08] interesting background the Bible says
[26:10] that he was a prophet and he was the son
[26:15] of a prophet and so you don't look so
[26:19] much at people's credentials and things
[26:21] like that you want to look at what that
[26:23] comes out of their mouth and what the
[26:25] word is and I think so many times we
[26:28] look at somebody's reputation or
[26:30] somebody's credentials and things like
[26:32] that out of the reputation and the
[26:34] message big people in the message or
[26:36] whatever and and ignore so much was
[26:38] coming out of their mouth we listened to
[26:40] them because of what somebody said they
[26:42] believed or whatever or didn't believe
[26:44] but it's what comes out of your mouth
[26:46] that makes the difference it's not what
[26:49] goes into the belly head and defiles a
[26:50] man but what comes out of his mouth
[26:52] yeah two anointed prophets Jeremiah and
[26:55] Hannah and iy was the difference and
[26:56] then one had to speaking to work and the
[26:59] other one different Jeremiah say they
[27:00] mean and that's what produces the birth
[27:02] pains is when somebody gets to speaking
[27:05] somebody gets to say in the same thing
[27:10] and so then we get into the voice now
[27:13] see you the shout was from 1963 to 1965
[27:16] a message was delivered and then the
[27:18] brother branham goes off the scene and
[27:20] and and seems like it left a lot of
[27:25] people in terminal they didn't know what
[27:27] to believe didn't know what to expect
[27:28] and so there's a period from then on to
[27:32] right about now where it's time for the
[27:34] bride to begin eating and to begin to
[27:36] realize who she is and so that's what
[27:39] I'm calling this period of the voice
[27:43] because the voice has to be in somebody
[27:45] not believe is in you because there's a
[27:48] quote I buried a little bit that the
[27:50] voice has there's got to be somebody on
[27:53] earth for God to speak through and if
[27:56] brother Branham is not on earth anymore
[27:57] and Jesus is not on earth anymore and
[28:00] and you are on earth then you are a
[28:02] prime candidate if you will open the
[28:05] doors of your heart and let God come in
[28:06] for God to come and speak through you
[28:09] and that's what I was at is there even
[28:12] from your birth you come from from the
[28:14] womb of the word you come forth speaking
[28:16] the word as you grow you speak the word
[28:18] it's your confession there speaking the
[28:20] word but one day you are you understand
[28:23] and I believe the bride is beginning to
[28:24] understand what to do with the word and
[28:26] how to speak it and you actually comes
[28:30] into authority maturity where God lets
[28:32] loose the reins a little bit more
[28:34] because he knows that the bride knows
[28:36] what to do with it and she could speak
[28:38] it she could speak it because she's been
[28:40] studying at all these years she's been
[28:42] feeding on me she's been eating it
[28:44] eating eating he just like in Revelation
[28:47] chapter 10 verse 7 it says it in the
[28:50] days of the seventh angel the mistress
[28:51] will be finished but if you keep reading
[28:54] John took the book and he represents the
[28:57] bride he took the book and then it says
[29:00] the angel said these things must be
[29:01] prophesied again her
[29:02] Reeth him those things have to be spoken
[29:05] again
[29:06] somebody's got to speak what they read
[29:08] in the book didn't work for a second and
[29:23] and so that's that same the same voice
[29:25] brother I was talking about that what
[29:27] the voice is and he said the same voice
[29:29] that summoned John to come up in
[29:30] revelation 4 chapter 1 is the same voice
[29:33] that some of his dead Lazarus out of the
[29:35] grave that same voice of the Archangel
[29:37] Christ is the voice of the Archangel and
[29:40] all that trophy the voice of Christ
[29:42] summons John to come up the same voice
[29:44] summons Lazarus and keep reading in the
[29:47] answer to here am i and he come from the
[29:49] dead after he was dead and his body
[29:51] rotten and you talk about birth pains
[29:53] birth pains to come up from the grave
[29:56] with grave clothes all over you and and
[30:00] and not really realizing where you are
[30:02] and things like that to come up from the
[30:05] grave that's birth pains and that's the
[30:07] birth pains that I'm talking about that
[30:09] we we have come from death to life and
[30:11] there's no there will be a day when the
[30:14] dead rise from the graves and they come
[30:16] forth so that we can go in a rapture
[30:19] because you're not you're not gonna take
[30:20] a body change until first the dead come
[30:22] for most that's the order of events
[30:24] first came the shout then came the voice
[30:27] comes the voice to raise the dead from
[30:29] the grave and then the Trump to call us
[30:32] into the air where is his voice this is
[30:38] one that brother Adam spoke spoke about
[30:41] many times the scripture John 14 and
[30:43] whatsoever you shall I ask in my name
[30:45] that while I do that the father may be
[30:47] glorified in the son if you sho ask
[30:48] anything in my name I will do it and the
[30:54] oneness of unity he said if he shall say
[30:56] what is it when you are out from Babylon
[30:58] you're out from under unbelief you're
[31:00] out from under superstitions you're out
[31:02] from under all these things and you're
[31:04] filled with God's own life your voice is
[31:07] his voice you are I spoken in my room
[31:10] while ago God
[31:11] to do this and here it is he's confirmed
[31:13] it right now I'd against us say how that
[31:15] he's speaking something the Lord showed
[31:17] him and he said the wind swept through
[31:19] this platform here just now as the Holy
[31:21] Spirit crossed over here because it was
[31:23] the spoken word of God that did it and
[31:26] see I think that's wonderful the
[31:29] prophets spoke the word you hear the
[31:32] word and then you speak the word and and
[31:35] you follow your confession through your
[31:37] life brother Graham said it when you
[31:39] begin when you're when you're sick you
[31:40] speak it anyway that I'm healed when you
[31:43] when you were in lost in sin you began
[31:45] to tell everybody I'm a Christian I am a
[31:47] Christian and the people around you
[31:49] might say well I don't see it yet but
[31:51] you kept saying it I'm a Christian and
[31:53] after a while it began to work
[31:55] righteousness because you were speaking
[31:57] it you got to speak it and then looking
[32:02] at the message the masterpiece were
[32:03] round talked about how and when when
[32:06] when the great sculptor but finished
[32:09] that masterpiece he struck it across the
[32:11] leg and the harder speaking and they
[32:14] made a flower and they put a flower on
[32:16] the image now what was the flaw remember
[32:18] the flowers that was put out the
[32:20] denominational system all the world
[32:22] system couldn't take they put it out
[32:24] they struck him to put it out it was it
[32:28] was put out of that system and and it
[32:30] then it began to speak the speaking
[32:33] produces a birth pain it was perfect and
[32:37] that's why he cried how speak because he
[32:39] had seen before him and then he was been
[32:42] able to achieve to bring to pass the
[32:44] vision that was in his mind and
[32:45] therefore under inspiration he done
[32:48] something out of the reason out of the
[32:49] ordinary he struck it and hollered
[32:51] speaking and so going back to Romans 8
[32:56] if you follow this line amen
[32:59] whereby we cry Abba Father now we've
[33:04] been taught that God is not a God of
[33:06] sympathy the only way you can't cry oh
[33:09] god please I'm feeling bad and that kind
[33:11] of thing the only way to get to God is
[33:13] to cut to approach him with his word
[33:15] that's the only thing that moves God has
[33:17] faith in his word
[33:19] he's not a God of compassion if he was a
[33:21] God of sympathy like that then then
[33:23] everybody there at the Pool of Bethesda
[33:25] would have been healed as he just walked
[33:27] from one person to the other but he went
[33:29] the one that would respond to the word
[33:31] and would believe and rise to his feet
[33:35] and so this crying is not just crying
[33:37] out for on some some some vain idea or
[33:41] something but it's crying out the word
[33:43] is speaking the Word of God and a baby
[33:45] phone but then you keep growing on up
[33:47] for the earnest expectation of the
[33:49] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[33:50] of the sons of God as it speaks about
[33:53] all this growing birth pains are
[33:55] happening and not only they but
[33:57] ourselves also which have the
[33:59] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[34:00] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[34:02] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[34:05] of our body and where is this voice this
[34:09] voice is is in you all the way from your
[34:12] birth to to the material to being a
[34:14] mature Christian because when you're
[34:18] sick listen you don't have to wait till
[34:21] you're adopted to stick a fish you're
[34:23] healing when you're sick you speak the
[34:25] word and watch it come to pass and
[34:27] remember it's not based upon your it's
[34:31] not based crying out for just some
[34:33] vanity or something but when you when
[34:35] you cry out to God put the word before
[34:37] like when I when I was began to seek the
[34:40] Holy Ghost it seemed like everybody in
[34:43] the message would tell you reasons why
[34:45] you couldn't get a rope it couldn't be
[34:47] saved and so I began to look through the
[34:52] scriptures to find reasons why Skippy
[34:58] the reason why this message was for me
[35:01] and when I found that I laid it in front
[35:03] of gods who you promised it now let it
[35:06] come to pass that's what that's what
[35:12] this whole journey is as you say you
[35:14] promised it now let it come to pass he
[35:18] promised to rapture he's promised a body
[35:20] change hey Scott Robin Williams priests
[35:22] to the rapture he said has been spoken
[35:24] now let it come to pass and he spoken
[35:28] but now you've got to speak it you got
[35:31] to speak it and the only way you can
[35:34] speak of this if you've been eating the
[35:35] word and you understand what needs to be
[35:38] spoken and then out of your belly will
[35:40] flow living waters as it comes forth
[35:43] from your lips and you speak exactly
[35:45] what was written the true interpretation
[35:47] of the word not just something that was
[35:50] inscribed from an intellectual
[35:53] standpoint on paper but the real
[35:56] spiritual understanding of what God
[35:58] wanted you to see at the spin I know my
[36:04] voice is activate the voice of the
[36:14] Sangha realm so what does that do then
[36:16] there has to be human flesh on earth to
[36:20] speak his voice there has to be human
[36:23] flesh on earth that's one of these big
[36:26] giant quotes I think that God just gave
[36:29] us to just wield as a like a big old
[36:31] mallet up against the devil's he did
[36:34] there had to be human flesh over and if
[36:37] brother branham's not on earth this is
[36:40] whatever I say that they try to say
[36:41] whether the shout out is brother Brandon
[36:43] divorce is gonna be some minister or
[36:45] somebody some great man
[36:47] the shout they try to make some some
[36:50] reason why it can't be you buddy
[36:53] but jesus said does not the scripture
[36:56] say that ye are God's Word came to you
[37:00] can speak the word
[37:05] any brother this is one program city
[37:08] even said now when I'm praying I like
[37:10] this enough now think about this
[37:12] God don't see me he just hears my voice
[37:16] and through the blood of Jesus right see
[37:19] he don't see P he hears my voice now
[37:21] this is a real true son God speak in the
[37:25] word and he's all he does is hear that
[37:28] voice speaking the word and I'll be
[37:31] honest I believe that's what real prayer
[37:34] is is not just saying the Lord helped me
[37:37] with my schoolwork or whatever although
[37:39] those things are good but real prayer is
[37:42] laying the word of God before him and
[37:45] saying you said and then what God move
[37:49] pull the scene and bring in the past
[37:51] that's right
[37:52] and I'll stop right there crazy
[37:57] [Music]
