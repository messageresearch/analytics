foreign like to follow along in the scriptures turned into Revelations one and First Peter 1 where we've been reading remember the announcements the ministers meeting for the ministers only will be

with us let us know be leaving here about 10 o'clock going up for the meeting that you'll remember these announcements done all the announcements about missing anything I generally do but you know just all right Revelations 1 and first Peter 1. you have any father our Lord Our Savior Our Redeemer or all in all and Lord that Wonderful Name of Jesus is where we can ask all of these things and depend upon receiving from you we pray that you would just bless each and every one of us with understanding this afternoon and Lord God each and every one Lord remember those that are not here ones that are traveling and the things you just be with each one and blessing God and have your way in our hearts and lives and Lord we love you and we thank you as we read your word now come and speak to our hearts because Lord we can talk about these things but without you in our presence then with just a meaningless Gathering but have your way now and keep us and show us thy Grace and love and we're still walking you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1-1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John so by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy who keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand out into first Peter 1. verse 9. through 13. receiving the end of yourself your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesy of the grace that should come unto you searching what are what manner of time the spirit of Christ which is was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desired desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now remember the thought of our message this morning this book that we're going to speak on this afternoon is the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ all right so then there must be things within the book that you know is taking some time to come to the position to understand to be able to receive and to walk into it took the prophet dose the times and all culture he didn't understand everything when he started and he kept unfolding to him and he kept preaching what he could see and we saw that it was the the right hand of God is the power of God during Revelations 5 1 where we're reading and we'll read in a minute and get started again but you know we've seen that it was the right hand he had to book in his right hand it wasn't in the left hand right so it was in the right hand for a meaning and then the right hand means power and authority so then he was raised to the right hand and we read the scriptures are this morning that it was the right hand that raised into that position the power of God brought Jesus Christ unto the position to be able to uh you know sit on that throne and to be able to see and understand uh the the point of what's doing the it's not a great big right hand it means power and authority all right then we ended up speaking about that that Authority is now in the hands of the Bride of Jesus Christ all right now so what about the authority now this this was a point I was trying to get across here Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me well then word as we quote them this morning and all the talking about it because you ought to know these quotes that run around and said then where is your any other God see if there is to be powerless right right no Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto him well now brother you just don't understand that the father gave so much and the Holy Ghost gave so much and put it all to Jesus look you know you just don't understand either so that's the main problem all right see that would bring in too many people and too many thoughts and you know and uh you know like we talk about we don't believe in Eternal son of ship because how could a son be Eternal but we do believe in eternal godship Jesus with almighty God made manifest in flesh all right and then when he raised from the dead he said all power is given unto me and then he turned right around and gave that power back to the church now he had already while he was here see I didn't have time to bring the message but while he was here he even unliving he gave the disciples power don't go out preach the gospel cast out Devils heal the sick Etc and all like that and and they wound up in trouble you remember with the uh epileptic child that they couldn't um cast out the demon and he said it was because of their unbelief not because of the power right now I've had a quote there this morning that I should have read I'm sure but right around says in other words if God ever gives you anything he can't take it back that's right now that's that's just as much as we can be if he gives you something and you say well I had this but you know God took it back no God didn't take it back that's right that's right you see I used to be able to do this and be able to do that but God took it away from me now don't get tied up with what brother Brown was saying when he said that that God took that gift away from him for about five years because that can happen that's in ministries and and doings I'm talking about salvation or the power of almighty God living in our life it was the fact that he had you know uh he had wronged God and and not followed the way he was supposed to and God took away what was that part all right let's see the power and authority the right hand is now in The Bride of Jesus Christ because when you see him he's in the seven in chapter one of Revelation you see him in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man dirt about the pouch for the golden girdle see that puts all of God there in that form and we believe that that the the thing that the prophet said all God was he poured into Christ oh Christ was he pours into the church all right so then that makes us part of the mystery and makes us with that same power you say well but I just don't see it well that's where the trouble is the trouble is is we're not looking correctly we're looking for something to happen we're looking for another Prophet to come or or somebody to come out with gifts and signs and wonders and I've told you over and over I preached this from day one here to church probably 40 over 40 years I believe that no person one person can have the ministry of Jesus Christ again like brother Brown had it one person I do not believe in it because it's not promised but I do believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ that it's promised to her around the world I mean I emphasize that around the world that is promised to her to her that the fullness of the godhead bodily would be in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen right see then you say but I just don't see it within that's making you the unbeliever and if you've been here where Jesus was here you would have been the same time no no I'd have believed if I hear what you now you're a liar because brother sorry but that's blame but it's true right that's right see we think it's supposed to change things because we could somebody else could be here all right see David The Killing Goliath was only to get the people they're fighting their own battle yes right right run around came to show us what God would do in any individual that would believe him they were not to deal with the ministry but we're to deal with the same God that's right because the same God has got to be in the ministry around the world all right we see it all ties up and makes one true and living God all right so then we see that the power and authority of almighty God is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne all right cause that is his hand right that's his power there's you Seven Stars there's a whole of the church age Messengers and God you know doing all tied up bringing it down to sin Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right now remember that we kept emphasizing the fact that Revelations 5 of The Prophet said is a scene preparing for the opening of the seals all right preparing I kept talking about that and kept over and over talking about it you're preparing for a wedding you spend days weeks months getting ready for one little event you know it ties up maybe two hours of your day but yet you've prepared for it for six months or more you know getting everything ready well then when the day comes that's where I like the point see that when the wedding comes you know and when that bride steps in that door back there to come down the altar you really literally supposed to lock the door man where those lazy bunch of shiftless bums they can't get here on time but they think the world evolves around them and they're in a puffed up manner you know look closed the door on me if you'd have got here before the time of the Bride coming down sorry I'm playing but is that true true well now you don't understand I like you talk like that or what if you was the bride right that's right and what if you was the Grim do you understand if I was the groom and my wife being the bride I wouldn't care if it was my Mother and Daddy it didn't get there I wouldn't stop the wedding to let them come in you know why because God ain't gonna stop it for those Teddy little females of our order one of these days the door is going to be closed and it don't matter what we think about it that's right that's right it's going to be on Amen so what if you were surprised when somebody comes in the door I'd like to have a seat you give him one swift kick in the seat to send him on his way why because this is a serious matter we're talking about reality I'm not talking about your petty feelings that's right listen now if you've caught on to something I told you we would get into Revelations 5. and I made statements along the way to help you write them down and be ready because according to the prophet Revelations 5 is a background or a preparing for chapter six to come into being of the opening of the seals right right I'll emphasize that over and over and over we got to be in the right place everything's available in position all right now you don't see once you see it in in what you see in chapter four is there a manifested in chapter five of the one sitting on the throne but it doesn't emphasize the throne and the things as much as it emphasizes the one that's sitting on the throne the right hand the power all right the authority and also there's a book in hand another one sitting on the throne and remember it's in the right hand it's not in the left hand it's in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne now the background for the opening of The Seven Seals is for you and me that are the chosen of God to see that we must prepare ourselves for the opening and I said it this morning and I'll say it again then what do you mean the shield broken prophet he said it's gone from you and you don't know it just because that Greta Branham was here and that God came to brother Brown and I agree with that I believed it yeah but does that make God coming to me and you God came in 63 brother Dale I'll have you to understand who too where was you at in 63 where was I at in 63 had an organized religion yes but the Lord came he did he came to the prophet it don't make it automatically come into us because it had come to him that's right has the Lord come to you wrote a randomly let's see I'll make the statement it's Embassy book he said has he through the old opening of this these seals revealed itself to you yeah but you said well brother you sound like you're trying to get your seals open again oh I'm glad you thought of that I'm trying to get them to open to you and me that's who I wanted to reveal to is me and you that's right all right man I want it open to me and you I want to see it for myself right I just bleed the prophet well amen wonderful now what about you I told you this morning that you you wouldn't die so you wouldn't know it a good Baptist Doctrine if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got it I said come on to that Pentecost really did go find you one and ask him exactly the way he believes him how do you believe about getting a new birth I believe I got it come on death Pentecost well now that's 2 000 years between the event right and you talking about it all right where were we at in 63. that's what 50 my mind slipped on that no matter how do you counted let me hear that be not 50 something 49 or whatever say 50 years ago it came to brother Brown but there's a lot of distance in between there a lot of you wasn't even born huh you see what I'm talking about you said well that that happened because and that's the way people think you said no brother now you don't understand I'm sorry that's what hurts my heart I do understand I understand the hindrance that you and I to understand God's word that's right yes these of course a lot of people then believes that but around this come to make a way for them you know I need to introduce them not me in broad form one form you know to take over you've heard of those you've been around them you know that they claim to be the one brother random come to introduce well I don't I believe you come to introduce the Lord Jesus Christ and then tell us where that's at right because that's in you and I all right now you might find out then eventually that we're talking about you and I were talking about the bride all the way through there was never to be a group of people to understand this book we'll get to it in a minute would you believe if I could read to your word even in Jeremiah where it was sealed up in an Earthly vessel and that Earthly vest will become flesh lived upon this Earth we're still sealed up about him until the end time in this message that is brought to you and I what are we doing here 40 50 years after the prophet passing on me you know right around done a lot of typing and things and you remember the little white woman darling her son and said her husband had died during the drought and heard her little boy left alone you remember the two sticks and the gonna make the bread and eat you know and die he said her husband her denomination you remember a few weeks ago when I was trying to ask that question is our whole husband dead our old husband is our carnal thinking about the Bible that's our denominational husband is what we have figured out for ourselves well you don't believe in nothing but run around my eyes I'm glad you thought of that too because I believe in that's what it's bringing he brought us the message but now it's an individual Affair this is not a corporate thing you know where would you call it a group therapy this is an individual Affair yes right that's why one person sit right beside the other person and go in the Rapture and the other person totally missed it is not a group therapy it's not a husband and wife of Fire if your children are old enough for the age of accountability they must have the baptism in the Holy Ghost right or they don't go with you I've preached that those under the age of accountability will be under their mothers and fathers yes if they are born again Christians you know true bride but once you reach the age of accountability children teenagers whatever you are responsible you're not going because an automatic process that Mom and Dad is going that's right you're gonna have to have your own Holy Ghost that's right you know watch that as we get through because the background as I said the preparation for you and I to be able to understand the seals is to realize that he has chosen you and I yeah for a purpose and we must prepare ourselves for that purpose now what is our purpose the purpose of this end time right I thought according to the Bible a day without us cannot be made perfect I thought everything is waiting on somebody to reach a position I won't ask for a raise of hands but I hope I get back to the message at the end of it I want to just ask you a simple question do you believe Redemption is over do you believe Redemption is over what about you know the redemption's over the lamb had left The Mercy Seat you agree but you know if it's not over he hasn't left emergency now what are you going to do with all of your great ideas about the seals and the thing when the seals can't be revealed until the lamb leaves a mercy seat oh strange talking brother see what you're saying if you're saying that God come in 63 and the lamb left the mercy Seaton 63. then Redemption was over in 63. knocks out 98 of what's here doesn't it come on sure but if you believe that brother Branham saw this by revelation that it was not an actual happening it was revelation of what was to take place then you can believe Redemption is still here do I need to rethink that again how many of you believe redemption's over well you'd say no I don't believe it's over well then the lamb ain't left The Mercy Seat now if the lamb that left a mercy seat how did the seals get broke you see one of these days what I drove at for 40 something years profit can see things highest present and future before it ever takes place Pride can see ice present and future by way of the prophet's message and it ain't come to pass yet you need a quote run around and says the seals reveal what has been what is and what will be and write that down I put it in my memory bank to think about it brother see did the lamb leave the mercy see if it is the biggest portion of you sit down to earn me too because my salvation come later now I was a good Baptist under salvation in 63. but my salvation really born again experience was 69 so you know that just take all of us out just about it and you'd be lost so what do you believe so if you can't put that together and I think what you need to do is just to say let me just listen a little bit maybe this man knows what he's talking about as I said this morning when brother monk said that about going God to me I had no way to argue with him I knew that so it was time to shut up and listen maybe that's time are you trying to build yourself up good for you thinking that away because there's never been but one it just means they were exalted and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen but I know where it all comes from what I did and what it does and all I care so I don't worry about it but it just asked you a simple question gender strife the prophet said questions make some strong church now what are you going to do two quotes fighting each other what is your settlement in your mind sound left for you to be able to just sit down and talk about your own experience I love to hear people's experiences of how the Lord LED you and how you received him as your personal savior maybe you might find out and I'll get off of that then that I'm not talking about a future event I'm trying to speak something that is here amen a reality if not when will it be here right now then let me make a life statement we move on you know that the children of Israel could not leave Egypt Moses tried to free him the truth killed a dead Egyptian that's right you know he had to go even though he was God's prophet ordained a prophet even though he met the burning bush at the in the mountain and all of those things and saw God personal he set out there for 40 years you know what he's waiting on the prophet said he's waiting on the Readiness of the people he said the right Pharaoh had to be on the throne what would have happened if Moses had walked back down there with bro you know that was on the throne when you remember the story that thought he was one of them and raised him and honored him was going to make him the next ruler of Egypt no boy had to be dead new favorite had to come up he's like it was with Joseph they had to be wanted didn't know Joseph just talking what are we looking for and when are we going to start believing what is taking place now with all this in mind what does it say in Revelations 5. and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written Within on the backside sealed was selling seals all right let's talk about that book what kind of a book is it what kind of a book is back there I've heard people say I'm not joking you've heard it too probably I've heard people say that King James version of the good enough for Peter and Paul is good enough for me you ever heard that now that's a good saying I really show spirituality when in the days of Peter and Paul and them there wasn't no King James version that's right the King James version the 1611 is the original King James version and you can argue with me all you want to and say that Bible on the front of it is King James Version but you better look in the front either say a revised 19 and 11 or 19 and 9 1911 1917 and this is revised and revised and revised and you know I got one called it says right down here King James Version you ever seen the King James version 16 11. world and them used to have them but how much do they have so the church one time after I kept talking about the 1611 you know somebody I don't know who it was one on the internet and they found a 16-11 Edition they bought me one it's about that thick the original King James Version in 1611 it's about that thick surprising to me how big it was all right but you get what I'm talking about yeah yeah you see how spiritual we are if the King James version good enough for Peter and Paul it's good enough for me and I'll take that red letter Edition that's why no you run into these I'm sure that's why we baptized Fox I know he knows because Jesus said in Riddler he said well what about Peter I'll take what Jesus said over what Peter said you've heard that one see that's our spiritual we are you know what did we believe it so much that the way that we think God's going to change and fit that way of thinking you know what I don't think it will I'm just honest trying to be just as straight lying to you and me because you see when John wrote this with 1895-96 somewhere right in there at that time you didn't have what you call the book the original translation doesn't say book it says scroll this didn't come into existence until of a book form until just a few hundred years ago you know the printing press and the things we put out and they find it they made what we call the book form all right now so the original book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne without spending a lot of time to emphasize a lot on it it would not be uh Thompson Chain or Scofield Edition you know it'd be a scroll all right the word book would come into being later so when they translated it into the King James version then is when you pick it up where it come up with the word book because it had become into that form of understanding so it was a scroll we're familiar with those words and we talk about the Dead Sea Scrolls the things and when we were in Israel were wonderful to be able to go there and and view the places where that they the monastery type of thing that they had where they were there and they're doing the writings of those things and started you know stored up those Scrolls into the caves and the pain and you know that Israel not thinking anything about the New Testament because a lot of people when you say Dead Sea scroll they think in the Old Testament struggles there was only partial Old Testament Scrolls in the Dead Sea Scrolls go look it up those were the Scrolls or the writings of the basic what we call the New Testament it wasn't all together the Old Testament it went all together to do that some of the full body full books like Isaiah I think is one for certain that was in those what they call the Dead Sea scroll you know that Israel thinks so much of those things until they have this in this great big building and they have it and they have it kind of round where you can walk around and you know you can see the books and the things that was made and that was amazing to me but you know they thank so much until they just didn't put the Old Testament Scrolls in there they put all those Scrolls that they found and they have it almost bomb proof they said that any warning came whatsoever on attack that whole thing collapses Inward and to make it as bomb proof as possible they think that much of your new testament Scrolls all right now you know the Scrolls what they've done that the only way you gotta scroll if you're going to have a new church is you had somebody to write it and they say that that's actually what that um Lazarus was doing and and every time in the Bible that they come to that g Dash d they would get up and go take a bath before they would write that word because it was so honorable that's the story behind Lazarus that he died from taking too many baths because that's what he was doing he was writing those Scrolls or copying them I had to have everything just perfect because one little move would entirely change the meaning in the writings it was the Scrolls you've heard the story of how brother Brown was talking about the the mark you know was part of the torn off that's because those Scrolls had deteriorated around the end and you know because of the weather conditions because they were just stored up in a cave they were not in a vault or in this it was in caves amazing situation for God to be able to preserve those things you know to be able to keep them but it's a scroll all right now we'll read this in a minute from Brother random so yes you'll know it's not my idea so those Scrolls would be rolled up you know they're parchment or what you call animal skins you know and then they were rolled up all right then when it was rolled up see then you would tie it and you'd put a tag on there or what that was you can argue whether this roll is the tag or the tag on top of a roll that's and what you want to do ain't gonna argue with you about it I'm just trying to make us an illustration so each one of those Scrolls would be there and you just have a tag sticking out and it would say Isaiah no you wouldn't be going through having to unroll ever scroll to try to find out what the books were a lot of them show it rolling inward this way no a lot on show one roll I don't know but and a lot of us rolled out that way and it went I ain't concerned about that my point is to just illustrate something if you took this kind of a book and you put seven straps on it you put something outside the book and that's what people think that the great mystery of the settlement seal is something outside the book so they make it anything they want it to be huh I've Illustrated it by telling you what Margaret brother Gary's first wife you know was we were eating and we were talking about this situation and I said you know people believe that the great mystery that seal is that you know you can have all the wives you want and you know I said but now you can get you know your own Revelation is what they think you know and to Margaret she was very quiet didn't speak a whole lot but she simply looked over to me and she said if that be right brother Dale then I'll get to Revelation I take my 357 and blow Gary's head off I said sister I agree with you but if you could make it one thing you can make it enough right but see why would it be written I'm just saying this part about it but I'm not trying to argue with anybody about the written within on the back side or whatever I'm just saying and I'll read you a little bit if it was this kind of book you'd have seven straps added to it that's what he said no selling straps would be outside the book but if it's a scroll and simply rolled up you can tie it with a string like I said you wouldn't want to open every one of them and try to find out what it is so you would just put a little tag some way attached that would say Isaiah Jeremiah see then you could reach down and get the book that is the only way to understand what Revelations 5 says you notice I said the only way to understand what Revelation 5 says there's a book written Within and on the backside sealed was selling seals then when you come to the seals what is it unrolled it my horse rider do you make it a book and what have you got we'll read that in just a minute sometimes just get the point in your mind if you think about so it couldn't be an ordinary book you would be adding two and if you had something on the outside of the book then you would be contrary to what the book itself says the book itself according to the Bible and according to the prophet said it was in the beginning a sin caused a problem an adding to he said in the middle of the book they're trying to add two he said in the end of the book it says if you had to he'll add the plagues that are written in the book but if you take away you'll take away your name out of the book but just let it be a scroll let it be a scroll and just roll it up because every what you want to think that's what it was you see a tab to tell you what that is and now you haven't added to the book the tab is only telling you what's there you see we don't realize we're trying to add Cobble if it is something like this book and it's outside what are you gonna do you would add too so that then whatever your idea is of what's added to would be just as good as anybody else's idea the seals was written in the book you say only six of them I beg your pardon Revelation 8 1. said when the seventh seal was opened there was silence in heaven brother Ryan said see the Irish open of course you got a lot of doctrines in the message now that some say it's not open and some say it is open the bible plan he says it's open it was in the book but there was no writing was just silence in heaven all right but think about that now as we go along now we don't want to add to the book no we don't want to take away from the book now so look what your profit go ahead and pull up number one brother Bob I guess it's back there now let's read what your Prophet has to say paragraph 43-45 of the first seal 63 318 now the seventh seal roll book is now being released by the land we approach that place tonight God helpless as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed now you see this is a sealed book now we believe that do we not we believe that it is a seal book now we never known this before okay but it is it's sealed with Seven Seals that he is on the back of the book the book is sealed with Seven Seals now that's exactly like he said in this seven seal roll in the back right if we was talking about it it would be like putting a strap across it selling straps but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll and then when the scroll is Unwound that's one then laying right in the scroll is number two and right here it says what it is but it's a mystery but yet we have probe in it but remember the book is sealed and the book is a book of mystery of of redemption I'm Excuse me Revelation it is a revelation of Jesus Christ see a book of Revelation now you know down Through the Ages man has probed and tried to get into that we all have what is it look the next one breach 63 317. see a seal in the whole Bible was like a roll like this and here was here was a mystery and this mystery was hidden alrighty was sealed around and put here the claim to so and so then the next mystery was wrapped around of what this inheritance was and stuck out here on this side the claim to so-and-so and went on down until it made a scroll because people didn't have books like this then it was in a row how many knows that call it a scroll well I see a scroll you could break loose one year what the mystery of this was and turn it loose and you could see what the claim was and then break the other one loose and see what that claim was Twister scroll all right number three taken from the first cl318 paragraph six for instance if I had something here I'd show you what I mean here's one seal that's one and you roll it up like this the way it was rolled and you roll it up in this manner and at the end there's a little piece sticking out like that remember rolling a little time a little piece sticking out that's the first seal all right and that's the first part of the book then the next seal is rolled in this manner right by the side of it and it's rolled up in this manner like here and then at the end right here there's another sticking out means two seals and that's the way the whole Bible was wrote in scroll and so to break these seals it opens the Mysteries of the book look at the next one the breach 63 317 eating service but in the last age all these Mysteries are to be solved and handed out and the seals are to be opened by the lamb and revealed to the church and then time is no more still wonderful then the book then is the book of redemption where it goes ahead brings in later on 144 000 brought in so far now it's the book of redemption right and it's sealed with Seven Seals so when I ask you the question again is redemption owner and people are arguing right now probably but was it over in 63 when the seals broke to the prophet where would you be but see for it to be revealed to the prophet didn't mean the lamb had left The Mercy Seat because if you read the bridge you'll find these statements when he leaves The Mercy Seat he becomes down here right we'll get to it in the next service or so that the lamb is the one that breaks the seals right amen but John was told the line of the tribe of Judah right when redemption's over he becomes a lion and two redemption's overheating lamb what about it or was it what I've always tried to get you to see that in 1963 God revealed to the prophet what those seals were just like in 1958 he revealed to the prophet and he tied it together and preached a message called serpent seed is that right did he come here knowing everything or did it open as he went through so to save the day brother I want to preach on the opening of these seals does that mean redemption's over or does it mean it's revealed to us what is under those seals Abraham I cannot hold from you anything you know Isaiah wrote an entire Bible going down to the tribulation and the Millennium and the thing was it over because Isaiah wrote it and that name started just what we think that we think we're so smart we think we're so revelated but if we just get it down to the bases of seeing that those seals broke to the prophet because he was a prophet right and then he could tell us what they were but as I started off then it's got to be revealed to you and I amen right what kind of a book is it all right we know for certainly that brother Ryan said see there there was a book in the hand of the one sitting on the Drone and she said this lamb come up and took the book out of the hand he said now that wasn't no animal you remember that I gave it to you that had to be a man because the animal was not qualified but so that wasn't a lamb that took the book out of the hand of the one sitting on the Drone the lamb couldn't do it you couldn't qualify it had to be a kinsman redeemer right right so what are we thinking about to the point I want to just lay these down a little bit so we'll go ahead to number five and look what he calls it this is the breach 63 317 evening you talking about this forfeited Tyler need is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title did to eat to the Earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner of God himself thank you now that's enough right there with that one of those sentence is enough to let me know that we're missing the point of what it is if it had been a scroll book that you're just talking about those are for illustrations because if it had been just a scroll book Satan could have got his hands on it they could have marred it right so it's not just a book it's not just a scroll then it's the Plan of Redemption because what did he say it was we're going to find in just a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the bug he's right hand and what does he call it the Donald D oh that makes me feel religious friends the title need to eternal life Abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forwarded it for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty God what a great thing ain't no networking Waiting For redemption's claimed it's Redemption but in this book of redemption this title deed after that title deed you say abstract what does an abstract mean means it searched all the way back to its beginning like that little drop I'll eat this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and When sin had been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ only it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a son of God abstract child deed is held in the hand of the Almighty now he calls it an abstract title to eat it's a DD eternal life yes you don't have an abstract for your property I'm sorry you can claim your own your property I'm sorry you own as long as a government yes is doing the Indian has abstract we don't have an abstract if you don't have your home shirts back when you buy one be real careful they only run a possible 20-year connection to your Deeds unless you pay an extra amount of money you got to pay more money to get a form of what is even close to an abstract you can think this is crazy but I experienced it we got ready to build a house we had bought this land for the man we paid the man for the land we had the deed to the land as a matter of fact we paid him monthly payments and he wrote a receipt on the deed and we had every bit of that but we got ready to borrow money on our home 65 the early building in Gilson and the bank says you don't own it is it because somebody's got an older deed than you've got gonna find out the man that used to own the property and put the property up against a bill for buying food and and supplies for the farm you know and seed and stuff and the man that went to church with us the band that would actually he said I remember when a man done that but he said we were supposed to cancel that out but said we didn't do it see that man could have took my property see you better try to think about abstract now listen going to church and being good you get a deed to eternal life when you believe you notice the way I said it you get a deed to eternal life when you believe you remember see I preached on this many many years ago many times when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you get an abstract time to leave say you can't take it away right you can take it away from it justification and sanctification because you're just believing unto we can't take it away when you're born again abstract titled Eve so he calls this book in the handle the one on the throne an abstract title deed The Plan of Redemption all right let's see something else he talks about rule number six up the first C of progress 33. you see the book actually was planned and they talking about the book in the handle going on the throne right everybody understand me yes see the book I actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world right now the book in the handling one on the throne was planned and written before the foundation world this book The Bible this is good it was really written before the foundation of the world but the Bible says lamb slam before the foundation where all names were written were written for the foundation world right it's only a Bible was written before the foundation of the world Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world but it's been sealed up he's been sealed up about our names being written there we didn't understand that when we was in the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian we could read of predestination and foreknowledge and foundation of the world and allowance flame before the foundation world but what was our thoughts about that just be honest what you said what was your thoughts about that then the members of the Bride their names were put on the last book of life before the foundation world but it's been sealed up and now if it's being revealed whose names were in there all about him what a great thing oh John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything under the Earth everything heard him saying amen and blessings and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was Worthy now what kind of a book is it then or is it a scroll just asking a simple question see we wanted to put a defining statement upon a book or a scroll or something but we just read that wrote around and said that the forfeited time will be the abstract title deed when Adam forfeited it it went back to the hand of the original owner he said and we see him on the throne holding the book now do we need to read that again abstract time lead names is all that's in that book and it was called the Bible the Bible is only names if you took the names out of the book you got very few pages of writing right you know took them out and laid them out on them so what's doing it before the foundation of the world God had a book called the lounge Book of Life That's not the book of life it was a split sections in it to where your names can be transferred Etc we're talking about the Lamb's Book of Life the eternal life all right see then when you come forth Lord we didn't call today the Bible see the Bible would have only been Adam Eve Abel said right are you following me I run out of fingers and things to be able to illustrate Peter James John Paul okay Richard Chris Donnie Davy Julie Esther you know that's all there is in the Bible his names now but you said wait a minute there's a lot in there yeah you know what it is that's the record of your life did I say if you would only have Adam Eve Abel saying this for the point you know met with all the names but you see then God didn't leave us that way because he knew we'd need those need to point so he wrote what happened to Adam he wrote what happened to Eve oh what would they place on Earth right wouldn't he write that Judy's mind he could put it down before the world but why don't you get it this way that before the world he put the names down all right and in his mind he knew that Jesus Christ would have to die but that was not a physical dying and he knew he would write the rest of the book what church are you listening what you're reading is or even some had to have their names changed Saul to Paul cephas to Peter had to have a name change we talk about run around them William Mary and Branham 777 right do you know that brother Brown's original name was not Branham it was Braham how many of you know that his daddy added the m to it making her into it every one had to be put in make it brown them she goes on his daddy could do it he could change it himself if he'd have changed itself he's been making himself something but his father changed it I'm glad my father changed my name don't you I got a pretty good name my name's Samuel I like that it's in the Bible even the word Dale is in the Bible let's talk about a valley and they talk about people Kingsdale but see God has to make everything ready see brother random would have been William Marion in six letters on the inland so his daddy had to change his name make it Branham see this book on Earth then is going to match what's in heaven right are we still on the story of what I've been talking about looking up there to see what we are we're not up there yet you know what you know John was the top of the rapture but you know what until we go God we're not raptured that's right I just like saying Redemption was number 63. bruh do you see what I'm getting at the book in the head of the one sitting on the throne was the book of names then when life came down into being and God started recording and that's where you wind up that brought around and says there's two books but he said it's not two books he said it's only one book with two sections invisible Union bride of Jesus Christ come on to Saxon of the same book you got the book of life and Judas had even his name written there but his name was not written in the last book of life section of eternal life what you're dealing with the writings but these are names Moses Aaron Ezra Nehemiah Jeremiah David Solomon when they came to Earth and lived their lives upon Earth on Earth did an Earthly record was made that we call the Bible an Earthly record of all of those names see now you're gonna you listen a minute you'll understand something a why that we must so importantly so important to realize the Book of Revelations is talking about us because where would you name me come on where's your name there's no writing Matthew Mark Luke John Acts relations Philippians collection and I can't name them in order never have been able to you're a preacher you can't do that no I cannot do it because I've never tried to remember it that way I try to remember what's in the book that's right instead of where it's at because I can go and get me a little Tab and find out you know it's my Bible got a little tabs but listen Church without the Book of Revelations and the understanding that has been brought to you and I where would you find your name in the book oh some of you said that's right you realized it hey brother Dale has been saying something happening The Book of Revelations is where my name is at he said not Arman now fall down Armadale was not written in the book he said but what is happening at the time I'm a Neville is on Earth is written in the book should we go and then we read Revelations 2. and then three and we find a seventh Church age and we find where we're at and we're beginning to find her name in the book right now we went over in chapter four did you lose all the names and only had to named it was in the book no my name's in the book my because I'm beginning to see what's taking place so that book in the hand of the one does it have to have all the records of your life I hope not right it'll be hard to turn these Pages out are you listening yes and according to this book that's wrote about it it says my name was erased and my sins is put in the Seal of his forgiveness and according to a message called invisible Union the prophet says your whole name and your old record is gone so then it's not Richard Anderson is it it's not Samuel Dale but around and say it's the name that was written before the world amen what was your name that's what's going to be something that may be interested some of you coming to the next Bible said you know what the next one's going to be for next month what if your name mean the meaning of your name I know if one ain't here that had their name changed because was it another one don't go by the name one of them had it officially changed on record because she didn't like her name another one doesn't go by her birth certificate record s you don't like it what does your name mean not be interested to see what all of our names turn out to mean Samuel ask of God wait means Wanderer Dale means a Pleasant Valley ask your God while you're wandering to a Pleasant Valley but you know that's not my real name that's not my real name that's my Earthly name for Mom and Daddy my daddy was named Sam and everybody said well your name is saying well there's no way of proving no records because nobody don't know we just know whatever that's why I don't worry about it I don't mind you calling me Sam I love it or just my daddy in reflection but please don't call me Sandy I'm sorry now if I'd have been raised would some of you at the ages you're in I might not have done it but I'll bet you the people that are my age knows exactly what I'm talking about because there was a seller back in that age that you know I don't like him and his name was Sammy so don't call me Sammy if there's a lady on the horse she's still living or not in the Baptist Church if I seen her right now she'd say hey Sammy how you doing well you walk down the girls with women one day and you know what they'll say there's two or three of them there you know what they'll say hey what'd you say I said make sure that's little brown not little black but listen Church our lives are written and put in the Book of Life that makes up the Bible section of Our Lives but an allowance book of life there's nothing but names because there's nothing against anybody it's not it's only God's children you know so if it was the book of redemption so that's one of your foolish virgins and things is in the book of and called the book of life section they're not in the Lamb's Book of Life of Eternal section I see Eternal and Define it it's only a book so this Bible has a record of my life in the Asian time I live upon this Earth but there is a book there's only contained names and no book can fit what that is you can't be a scroll you can't be a Thompson Chain or a book that we call it you know that we used to have in our home and we still have the pictures we used to have in our home and everybody would really like it would have been at my home on the wall going down through the hallway and we had the children from the time they were born here was like Wade who was on top Wade and Terence and Anna all right and up there would be weighed when he was born and then in his little clothes coming along later changing being the four years old three years you know it went down his life like that what year was Terrance when he was born and went down his life and Anna when she was born and went down through there you want to go get Anna somewhere if she was born and look at Piggies when she was born and look at little Abby Grace when she was born and you'll see a lot of resemblance you know but my point is that we were trying to keep up with those things and you know one day I walked in there and I said Lord and just point it large Wade I wish he could have stayed right there I looked down and I saw Terrence and I said I wanted that place on there and I said wish he could have stayed right there now looked at Anna and I said I wish you'd stayed right there well you know that was a good daddy a good talk but they wouldn't made for that it was not made for that it was not made to stop you would be taking away their life they were made to live their lives out and write a book about them made to come to their own salvation listen just try to get it short in a hurry so then when we're looking at it it's the book of redemption and only names is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne now would you please then if there's only names written in the book of the hand one the one sitting on the throne would you please explain to me why so much emphasis is placed upon them one horse rider being the first seal my words right it's not the first see him the seals is a revelation of Jesus Christ we've done read that today did you remember the seals is a revelation of Jesus Christ it's not the revelation of the Antichrist you see Jesus Christ standing in the place that's what the fifth chapter is doing it's putting Christ in a perspective that when that seal does break you won't see him over there you see him standing here and there goes to one horse rocker but you see that's why I know I'm not understood about some of those things that'll make a statement but think about it the book is in the hand of the one on the throne it's just named but it's revealing those names and we come to Earth and live out our Natural Life but then we come to Salvation would that not be when that name is picked up and understood right and you wouldn't even know it you just know the call I hope you listen because you see then I would pull up the lines from number nine gotta get on Coppertone running late look number nine the breach paragraph 146 63 317e Jeremiah said this scroll must be kept yeah I don't have time to get into Jeremiah I've got it the thing that was what I was using for the thing you read your and I'll read Ezekiel when you get it better read it in Jeremiah but you get it in Ezekiel that even in Ezekiel um 2 and 10 and he said he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was writing their end limitations and mornings and woe you go to Jeremiah and you'll see what Jeremiah was doing when they went into captivity they took the records of who owned the land they brought them together and they buried him and put them in Earthly vessels and buried them the the tie the deed who owns this who want that what just your property in this belong to who they burying them honor and when they came back they went and Unearthed that and they began to get those Scrolls out and say here it is now James calling you on this here it is Richard Marlo you on this they begin to tell you who was what right that was only speaking of this right here Jeremiah said this girl must be kept as you read it there he'd say he must he must be kept in an Earthly vessel see oh what a beautiful thing that I could talk about a while this girl was kept in an Earthly vessel a vessel that once became flesh Glory died rose again and kept in an Earthly vessel until the time of the purchase Oh My beautifully all right and I keep reading now these messages he's talking about Jesus Christ right you know what Jeremiah's talking about that's what the example was back there of the earth and vessel that was when it was made flesh and dwelled amongst Jesus Christ in an Earthly vessel he was all the word right you know that all those names it was in the last book of life was in him when he was here I had to do my face a lot of foreign this is the Lord Jesus Christ now even after he's made known watch all right now these messages are all kept up until this Earthly vessel until the time of God's appointed time at the last messenger at the Earth and all that these people had judged that and said I know it's there I believe it's dark it's going to be brought forth down to these messages he says the seals are you catching on let me read you just a second chapter four The Rapture takes place chapter five you see the throne when sitting on the throne we found out that identically matches your new birth because he's on the throne in your heart that's right amen and ours the Bride of Jesus Christ in chapter four sitting not just on a throne like thrown here and all of us are sitting on it that was the people of God now Through the Ages who would receive eternal life that was his children that was their names then you enter chapter five and you see the throne in one city on the throne as our experiences what's taking place now and you see the right-handed Powers we ended this morning speaking about the power of God is now in his bride there is no power anywhere else amen that's why he said for us to ask for us to say the power of God has been instilled into the Bride of Jesus Christ you get anything now you'll get it through the bride amen now what are we saying the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne is the names of all of that bride I hope you're seeing it you're not seeing Jesus anywhere there by itself you're seeing where he's at he's in his church he's in his bride here up on Earth brother Brown said he would become visible Among Us and raise the Dead and we're going to rapture he said your Corporal body doesn't come back until the Millennium so don't look for that look for the visibility of God through the revealed word and the bride's sitting on the throne now remember the next stage of it is that there was a lamb came forth where does the lamb come from see your own Revelation has got to produce a lamb for you you can't be mine that'll be yours will your Revelation stand to test will it fit the Book of Revelation you might begin to find out I'll make this statement in the hush we are now in the scene of the Book of Revelations chapter 5. on Earth how positive we are in that I don't understand I don't know because I ain't worried about it but the scene is on Earth now remember all that we'll get to and we'll get into the seals and things but just remember one thing the seals are Broken Heaven handed down to the seventh angel ready to breach and then he breaks the seal here this book is CEO the prophet said in heaven but he said the thunder sound on Earth those are laying there on my desk so don't worry the sound on Earth what about it are you beginning to realize that What's Happening Here is matching what's happening what happens to Earth because it's beginning to come into the same revelation plain language the throne is in our heart the one sitting on the throne is almighty God who's given eternal life now we see that we are the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne are you ready we are the what we are the book that's going to be revealed to Israel honest people going to Israel don't get the wrong idea now out there somewhere else you better listen because you say something I don't say that's your business I said it the way I mean it we are the book that is to be revealed to Israel what about it you think that's a little too strong you want to quote for it it's over about the seventh sea over brother Randall's talking about the 144 000 and two witnesses and he tells you what they will tell Israel should you turned it down back there was sitting there with a gentile people become the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and said they're going in a Rapture now and you're in the tribulation because you've rejected that they turned down the right of sonship and they never will have the right of friendship again there will be servants to the bride try and we'll never have sonship allotted to him again we have that friendship the state come on music like on these things just because I'm not a straight emotional fast running to tangle your spine I like for you to think you're going to find out one of these days I've been preaching all these years about you hahaha about you if I see God anywhere I gotta see it in you know you'll see that I've been talking about you then Brother Gary can go back and give you page number and paragraph for the seals where I said it in 82 and 83. you used to call me he said I can tell you the paragraph you're in tell you the state what you're making all right you've done a lot of riding from Atlanta to Alabama and all over the place but you know God helped him
