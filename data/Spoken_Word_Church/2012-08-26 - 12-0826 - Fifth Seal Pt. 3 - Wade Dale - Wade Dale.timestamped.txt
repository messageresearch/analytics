[1:14] they or they go to the counter and when
[1:15] you're standing at the county you look
[1:17] over here and you got potato chips and
[1:18] you got chewing gum and this is where
[1:20] they make their most money everything
[1:22] right up next to the reg where you got
[1:23] to stand there that's right hey I went
[1:25] to Walmart and I had all in
[1:28] my all there you
[1:32] go hey Don Donnie's experiencing some of
[1:35] this he told me yesterday he said it
[1:36] hurts when you pay
[1:39] cash
[1:41] hurt all right let's go Revelation
[1:47] 6 okay he's
[1:51] trying today's subject is going to be uh
[1:53] dumping dead at the in the class and and
[1:56] man if some of y'all older ones want to
[1:58] come this is this is good you can come
[2:01] you can come if you want to Revelation
[2:06] 6
[2:08] verse
[2:09] nine when he had opened the fifth seal I
[2:13] saw under the altar The Souls of them
[2:16] that were slain for the word of God and
[2:18] for the testimony which they held and
[2:22] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[2:23] long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not
[2:26] judge and avenge our blood
[2:30] on them that dwell on the earth and
[2:32] white robes were given unto every one of
[2:34] them and it was said unto them that they
[2:36] should rest for yet a little season
[2:38] until their fellow servants also and
[2:40] their Brethren that should be killed as
[2:42] they
[2:43] were should be
[2:45] fulfilled all right now we know we're
[2:48] going to take the natural part today and
[2:50] just kind of go over the scripture show
[2:52] the natural part of what's going to
[2:53] happen then we'll get into the spiritual
[2:54] part a little bit later because the
[2:56] natural part has to
[2:58] happen so here you've got a group of
[3:01] people now the bride is gone right so
[3:05] this has nothing to do with the bride
[3:06] the bride's gone we provve that last the
[3:08] last several uh times that we've done
[3:11] this the Rapture takes place on the
[3:13] fourth seal as far as seeing the uh
[3:18] combat Beast go up and the combat Beast
[3:20] is what the Holy Ghost right so if the
[3:23] Holy Ghost leaves the Earth and you've
[3:25] got the Holy Ghost you're going with it
[3:27] all
[3:27] right it's the same spirit that raise up
[3:30] Jesus from the dead dwell in you which
[3:31] with the Holy Ghost he shall also
[3:33] Quicken your mortal body and take us in
[3:35] the Rapture all right by his spirit that
[3:37] dwells in you so we showed last
[3:40] Sunday the Rapture take place on the
[3:43] four seal and and showing on the
[3:46] chart or on the uh pyramid here too also
[3:50] if you want to look right here is where
[3:52] the Rapture takes place CU lay the see
[3:54] and church a in Rapture takes place and
[3:57] we're gone all right but we know know
[3:59] that that Capone has to come down and
[4:02] seal a group of people away according to
[4:05] the
[4:06] grace and we'll see the destruction of
[4:10] Nature and and somebody being given
[4:12] eternal life and didn't even want it all
[4:15] right and that's got to happen and blend
[4:18] in like I said
[4:20] here the fifth sixth and seventh seal
[4:23] has to come back around and be right
[4:25] here just for a moment brother Brown
[4:27] said just for a
[4:28] moment God is going to anoint a church
[4:30] when he anoints a church see he's going
[4:32] to anoint a a
[4:34] people excuse me but it's going to be a
[4:38] very small group of people all the other
[4:41] people that are dead and gone they don't
[4:42] they've never had this teaching all
[4:45] right so the Bible is never like Dad and
[4:47] I were talking about last night on
[4:48] Daniel 70 weeks just keep praying for us
[4:50] cuz we're we're you know getting uh a
[4:53] couple of weeks away from U from doing
[4:56] the the series on Daniel 70 weeks to a
[4:58] bunch of preachers
[5:00] which is going to be pretty tough but
[5:02] that's all right they asked us to do it
[5:04] so there's a lot of confusion in Daniel
[5:06] 7 weeks
[5:07] but the Bible tells you that it was
[5:10] sealed up to the end so nobody's going
[5:12] to understand it until the end time
[5:14] nobody's going to understand Daniel 7 we
[5:15] till end time cuz remember he told
[5:17] Daniel he said Daniel seal it up go to
[5:19] sleep with your people right right seal
[5:22] it up go to sleep with your people it'll
[5:23] be in other words it'll be made known at
[5:25] the time of the end or the end time
[5:27] which is now so people get probe at it
[5:30] and and these brothers can now say Well
[5:32] Clarence Lin did this and so and so did
[5:34] this and so on it wasn't
[5:37] open until that Prophet opened those
[5:40] seals and opened the Daniel 70 weeks it
[5:43] wasn't open to nobody
[5:46] zero right I don't care how Clarence
[5:48] Larin you get close to it I don't care
[5:50] and they they're great men brother rown
[5:51] said they were great Men You're A Smith
[5:53] and all them great men I'd say Born
[5:55] Again men or he wouldn't to listen to
[5:57] them Born Again men but they only had a
[6:00] partial understanding of what was going
[6:03] on their eyes were were narrow but now
[6:06] see when brother R come the book had to
[6:08] be open completely to allow us to
[6:11] understand this now us he did all that
[6:14] for us right so that we can be the ones
[6:17] that fulfill the prophecy Daniel go to
[6:18] sleep with your people because at the
[6:20] time of the end these things will be
[6:21] open and then in Revelations 10 you see
[6:23] the book is open the real book not to
[6:26] say all the books are false but the real
[6:28] book The Bible in Revelations 3:14 says
[6:30] the faithful and true witness not that
[6:32] all the other Witnesses were false but
[6:34] if you look up that word true it means
[6:36] last or the last truth that's coming to
[6:39] the end time the faithful and true
[6:41] witness the beginning of the creation of
[6:43] God and that's where it start and begun
[6:46] in and that's why the people don't
[6:48] understand the Daniel 70 weeks which is
[6:50] has a lot to do with the seal all right
[6:52] if you don't understand Daniel 7 week
[6:54] you can't really understand what's going
[6:55] on here as far as naturally and as far
[6:59] as as
[7:01] spiritually cuz most of the people do
[7:03] not understand Daniel 7 you people in
[7:06] our church know more about Daniel 70
[7:08] weeks than 99% of the preachers in this
[7:11] whole entire message there's only one or
[7:13] two preachers I've ever talked to
[7:15] brother claude's one of them brother no
[7:17] Johnson that knows what happened and
[7:19] that chart was right the quotes are
[7:21] right and can put it together that's
[7:22] only two people I know besides dad
[7:24] myself not bragging but my Lord Daddy's
[7:27] known this since 1974 this is old stuff
[7:29] D they're going to be really surprised
[7:30] when they see what goes
[7:32] on that
[7:34] weekend but it's got to be revealed you
[7:36] can't just teach it to somebody and they
[7:38] get it it's got to be revealed so pray
[7:39] that there's a revelation com amen not
[7:42] that we're trying to be something
[7:43] different or something important but
[7:46] it's just like I told
[7:47] you and it's like what in our in this
[7:50] financial peace course God's only going
[7:52] to give you what you can handle right
[7:55] and if you can handle he he sees you can
[7:57] handle more he'll give you more right a
[7:59] lot of people in the message can only
[8:00] handle a certain
[8:02] amount cuz they cut their your s off we
[8:05] cut oursel off from learning from God
[8:07] that's right right we limit the Holy
[8:10] Ghost we have the Holy Ghost to take us
[8:12] we have the Holy Ghost to change us
[8:15] change us and take us into Rapture but
[8:17] we are the ones because of enmity this
[8:20] division which is between your ears that
[8:23] will stop you from making the change of
[8:26] the body that's the only thing that'll
[8:27] stop you cuz you've got the Holy Ghost
[8:29] in inside of you that's Eternal but you
[8:31] as a human with your own ideas are going
[8:34] to stop God that's right and that's what
[8:36] you do you stop God yourself God don't
[8:37] stop that's right you stop that's right
[8:40] you stop God You Hinder God we're the
[8:43] biggest hindrance God ever had we are as
[8:45] our person but we have the Holy Ghost
[8:48] that's going to take us in a
[8:49] Rapture so in in the end time there had
[8:53] to be a Prophet
[8:55] come that broke the pure unadulterated
[8:58] word to us he couldn't be false he
[9:00] couldn't have this idea and it be
[9:03] contrary to this idea as they say in the
[9:05] Daniel 70 weeks you know the brother
[9:06] said we can't understand it because he
[9:08] made so many mistakes well if he made
[9:09] mistakes we need to find somebody that
[9:11] don't make
[9:12] mistakes and we know the Holy Ghost
[9:14] don't make mistakes right brother R
[9:16] might have said 700 instead of 7,000
[9:18] that was a human error he might have
[9:21] said one thing and meant another but
[9:22] when you take the overall picture of
[9:24] what he said that's right that Daniel 7
[9:27] leeks is a beautiful picture because you
[9:29] got to realize it is just exactly and
[9:31] Claude and I were talking the other day
[9:33] and it's exactly the truth you watched
[9:35] brother brand on the Daniel 7 weeks he
[9:37] said I don't know what that 70 weeks is
[9:40] he approached the Daniel 70 weeks just
[9:42] like he approached the seal I don't know
[9:44] what that second seal is I don't know
[9:45] what that third SE is he said that right
[9:48] well he didn't know what that 70 week he
[9:49] said I'm going to take this whole week
[9:51] and I'm going down and he said Daniel
[9:53] said he understood by books so brother
[9:55] Ryan went through the history the
[9:57] natural history of man and showed by
[9:59] books plus this book he showed by books
[10:04] that the time would be 70
[10:06] weeks that's what he said what he said
[10:09] in the
[10:10] book but to take then and preach the
[10:14] seals
[10:15] afterwards we get this one point and and
[10:18] you say well this is not on on the on
[10:20] the line of what we're talking about
[10:21] yeah it is
[10:22] really because
[10:24] remember brother Brown said six seals
[10:27] finishes Redemption right the seventh
[10:29] brings him back to the Earth to get
[10:33] us the Gentiles the sixfold
[10:37] purpose the sixfold
[10:40] purpose does
[10:42] what finishes Israel's Redemption and
[10:46] brings Christ back to Earth with us in
[10:49] the Millennium six seals finishes our
[10:52] Redemption the seventh seal brings him
[10:54] back to pick us up in this church age
[10:56] then you got another week left right
[10:58] here God takes that same word and goes
[11:01] right down to a group of Jews those that
[11:04] sixfold purpose to make an end of sin
[11:06] reconciliation iniquity bring
[11:08] Everlasting righteousness seal up the
[11:09] vision and prophecy anoint the most holy
[11:11] and they one in there I always forget
[11:13] but what does that six sixfold purpose
[11:16] do in Daniel 9:24 finishes Israel's
[11:20] Redemption right and then the seventh
[11:22] seal brings him out of the future I mean
[11:25] out of the wedding supper right down
[11:28] into the millennium
[11:29] right same thing so you can type the
[11:31] seals and the D and 70 weeks that's why
[11:33] brother R said you got to get them right
[11:35] you don't get them right you got gaps in
[11:37] there bad gaps a lot of people got bad
[11:39] gaps biggest gap between their
[11:43] ear CU they take what some man says not
[11:45] what God
[11:47] Said all right so but what we got to see
[11:49] is too that that this is talking about
[11:52] Jews so the raptures taken place the
[11:54] Gentiles were gone so this has nothing
[11:56] to do with the
[11:57] Gentiles this is all the fifth seal
[12:01] right now to show here is of course we
[12:04] know the first seal to the Jews second
[12:06] seal to the all this is to the Jews
[12:07] naturally we get the spiritual
[12:09] application of it that's why I talked
[12:11] about 1 2 3 and
[12:12] 4 typing justification sanctification
[12:15] baptism Holy Ghost and the word being
[12:16] made manifest all right same thing with
[12:19] here justification sanctification
[12:21] baptism Holy Ghost the highest form of
[12:23] the Holy Ghost right and I think I'm
[12:25] going to go back and do that series
[12:27] again because I'm going to probably do
[12:28] it at brother r Spen next month when we
[12:30] go because you got the new birth is
[12:33] justification sanctification baptism
[12:34] Holy Ghost puts you in the body right
[12:36] right some of you know this but we got a
[12:38] lot of new ones then justification and
[12:41] sanctification and the baptism of the
[12:42] Holy Ghost seals you in and adopts you
[12:46] seals you in and brings you to the stage
[12:48] of adoption
[12:50] right okay this is your journey it's
[12:53] just seeing brother R said see he say
[12:55] see you've already come up this far and
[12:56] you don't have the holy spirit yet well
[12:58] everybody thinks you got to go up
[12:59] through here to get the Holy Ghost you
[13:00] don't know how to get virtue without
[13:02] having the Holy Ghost the right kind of
[13:03] virtue right so you got justification s
[13:06] Bap the Holy Ghost puts you in the body
[13:08] of Christ by what faith cuz really
[13:11] there's seven ads it's not it says add
[13:13] to your faith one 2 3 4 5 6 7 all right
[13:18] it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or you leave him
[13:21] out that's right it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but
[13:25] when you get up this far God's going to
[13:27] seal that in
[13:30] and make you come to a stage of adoption
[13:34] by not giving you another Holy Ghost but
[13:36] giving you refilling we need refilling
[13:39] every day right you get baptized here
[13:43] but many fillings on the way up because
[13:44] really this virtue is an act of the Holy
[13:46] Ghost knowledge is an act of the Holy
[13:48] Ghost cuz these are the characteristics
[13:50] of who Jesus Christ who was the Holy
[13:52] Ghost right so we don't receive another
[13:55] Holy Spirit or we don't wait till we get
[13:57] up here to receive another Holy Ghost no
[13:58] just brother R preached three works of
[14:01] Grace all the way even to the Future
[14:03] home even at the future home he says us
[14:07] the Jews and the world right all right
[14:10] justification sanation baptism Holy
[14:11] Ghost justification sanation baptism
[14:13] Holy Ghost justification sanctification
[14:15] in the in the message in the in the
[14:17] virtues the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:20] seals you in then you start right back
[14:22] over again because he's going to cap you
[14:24] with a headstone these people are the
[14:26] ones that's going to take the body chain
[14:27] that's where justification say baptism
[14:29] Holy Ghost now brother R came to the
[14:31] headstone but there's got to be an apex
[14:33] to where that there's a group of people
[14:35] not just one person right brother R
[14:37] couldn't take a Rapture by itself it had
[14:39] to be a group of people cuz it's
[14:41] Gentiles is is individuals but it is a
[14:43] group of us that's going in the Rapture
[14:45] right so we'll get into that maybe a
[14:47] little bit later but that's something to
[14:48] really think about because that
[14:50] parallels and shows you what we were
[14:52] talking about last Sunday you got seven
[14:55] Church ages that parallel the seal
[14:59] right right
[15:01] right R will take place on the four seal
[15:05] right right I I I just I feel for the
[15:08] one that had had a background but you're
[15:10] really going to have to just catch up I
[15:11] guess they're just really sometimes you
[15:13] just keep looping back and trying you
[15:15] know but you know what if you got the
[15:17] Holy Ghost God will bring it to it amen
[15:19] you got the Holy Ghost God will bring
[15:20] he'll Quicken it real fast remember
[15:22] those 11th Hour workers they got paid
[15:24] the same as the people that worked all
[15:27] day that's right they got paid the same
[15:29] amount why cuz they work just as hard
[15:31] right cuz God's not a respect of person
[15:34] the 11 to people made the same as the
[15:36] people work all day you say that may not
[15:38] be that doesn't seem fair well God's
[15:41] Eternal that's right now God's Eternal
[15:43] he he can bring you he can bring you
[15:45] through justification Sanic baptism the
[15:46] Holy Ghost and birth those virtues in
[15:48] you cuz that's what happened on the day
[15:49] of
[15:50] Pentecost on the day of Pentecost they
[15:52] weren't right
[15:54] here those 120 have been tutored by by
[15:58] by the virtue himself and they were
[16:01] right here at the faith of the fathers
[16:02] they had these virtues working in their
[16:04] life okay so on the day of Pentecost
[16:07] when the Holy Ghost fell it Justified
[16:09] them Sanctified them during their walk
[16:11] remember they Justified Sanctified
[16:13] during the walk cuz even I was telling
[16:15] remember um Wednesday night I was
[16:17] preaching on justification then you go
[16:19] into sanctification even Judas was here
[16:21] but Judas never came to here if he did
[16:22] he'd be born again right but he was
[16:25] justified and Sanctified they were
[16:26] Justified and Sanctified the W well as
[16:27] soon as the Holy Ghost them on that
[16:29] Pentecost it sealed these virtues in
[16:31] them because they learned from the
[16:32] master himself they got the 3 and 1/2
[16:35] year Ministry of Jesus Christ pureing
[16:37] unadulterated right that's why they
[16:39] could come to the faith of the father
[16:40] that's why we have to be restored back
[16:42] that's why Elijah had to restore us back
[16:44] to the faith of the father because
[16:47] Luther wasn't in this part up here
[16:51] Luther didn't have all these virtues
[16:52] working in his life okay he had the just
[16:55] shall live by faith even though he was
[16:57] in this church age this is just
[17:01] paralleled it wasn't that Luther had
[17:02] patience and this was his church age now
[17:04] these are just like I said these lines
[17:06] are just for
[17:07] reference all right these lines are for
[17:10] reference cuz really you start brotherly
[17:12] kindness when you have faith you're
[17:13] kinder to the brother or you should be
[17:15] when you start at Faith you have a
[17:17] little bit of virt you have a little bit
[17:18] of this and then it begins to grow you
[17:21] got all your fingers when you're a baby
[17:25] but an old baby you'll just grab stuff
[17:26] and throw stuff and drop stuff and but
[17:28] when you get older you know not to drop
[17:30] that hammer on your toe that's right but
[17:32] it's the same set of hands that you used
[17:34] when you were a baby so you're growing
[17:35] in Grace and knowledge and that's what's
[17:36] happening all the way up through here
[17:38] being all right do what being being born
[17:41] again that's exactly what it is being
[17:42] born again then you come to this part
[17:44] where God can adopt you I said can cuz
[17:48] you receive the spirit of adoption down
[17:50] here then you come up to here then you
[17:52] got this Capstone that's got to set down
[17:54] on top of you which is the headstone
[17:58] which is what came back that's what the
[18:00] 3 and 1/2 year Ministry of Jesus was
[18:02] plus that's what the 3 and 1/2 year
[18:04] Ministry of brother Ram was that's why
[18:07] this was the Apex of his ministry was
[18:09] the seal cuz that brought Christ back in
[18:11] his purest form purest form and then man
[18:15] didn't have to look at this these seals
[18:17] and say I wonder is that Jew or is that
[18:21] Gentile or is that cuz see the souls
[18:23] under the altar brother randam you'll
[18:24] see him say many times Souls under the
[18:26] altar crying how long
[18:29] he'll say that's the bride the the dead
[18:31] Saints which it is the dead Saints to a
[18:33] degree but when you put it in this
[18:34] scripture this is definitely not anybody
[18:37] that's born again all right everybody
[18:39] got that this is not because this says
[18:42] how long it didn't say the testimony of
[18:44] Jesus Christ it says for the testimony
[18:46] which they held which in other words
[18:50] they were staunch Jews they did the the
[18:53] the Saturday Sabbath they did the
[18:56] washing of the pots they did the sacrif
[18:58] rice of the Lamb they did all this they
[19:00] did all these things all the way down
[19:02] and even during ieman and Hitler brother
[19:04] R said that's when most of them were put
[19:05] into this group was when Ian and Hitler
[19:08] killed 6 million of
[19:10] them cuz just because they were Jews
[19:13] just because they were Jews all right
[19:15] they'll be given white robes now we're
[19:17] we get white robes down here they're
[19:19] going to be given white robes later on
[19:21] but it says right here I saw under the
[19:23] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[19:25] for the word of
[19:27] God they they were put in the word of
[19:29] God they didn't know the word of God
[19:30] they were put in the word of God cuz see
[19:31] they had the Old Testament that is which
[19:33] is the word of God they just didn't have
[19:34] a revelation of that Old Testament all
[19:36] right and for the testimony which they
[19:39] held not the testimony of Jesus Christ
[19:41] it was the testimony that they held all
[19:43] right and they cry with a loud voice
[19:45] saying how long oh Lord holy and true
[19:47] Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[19:51] now when you come to that brother
[19:52] Brand's going we're going to read some
[19:53] in the seal book probably next not next
[19:55] Sunday but a few Sundays from now and
[19:58] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[20:00] on the earth now Christian people don't
[20:02] do
[20:03] that but see that was the attitude of
[20:05] the
[20:06] Jew that was in this Dimension that said
[20:09] hey they killed us for nothing they
[20:12] killed us just because we were Jews in
[20:14] other words Lord what are you going to
[20:16] do about it how long to avenge our blood
[20:21] all right and white robes were given in
[20:22] other words God said hey I'm going to
[20:25] give you eternal life because I
[20:30] I on purpose blinded
[20:34] you right so God could take a gentile
[20:41] bride I blinded you at Calvary so I
[20:45] could take a gentile bride but I'll not
[20:47] forget you I'm going to come over here
[20:49] and pick you up in 144,000 plus these
[20:53] people plus these people this is not the
[20:56] 144 p this is the people that were
[20:59] killed under Ian and Hitler that did not
[21:01] know that's why this is g r a CE because
[21:04] you're going to realize a group of
[21:06] people right here that are giv eternal
[21:08] life for just the
[21:11] testimony that they held which was they
[21:14] were Jews they were God's chosen people
[21:19] they don't know one thing about Jesus
[21:21] Christ they don't care one thing about
[21:23] Jesus Christ and you say that's pretty
[21:25] hard but they don't you go over there
[21:26] now and ask a Jew no he's not the
[21:29] Messiah he was just a good Prophet we
[21:30] don't care anything about him the
[21:31] Messiah is
[21:33] coming is that my brother said that
[21:37] what I don't know this but he said The
[21:40] Tender Mercies of God sure it's the
[21:43] tender hand of Jehovah down through all
[21:45] those ages but now when he made that
[21:48] quote it was back when the 68 million
[21:51] were
[21:52] killed in this Dark Age he said it was a
[21:55] tender hand of Jehovah being with those
[21:57] group of people and you can also apply
[21:59] that to this cuz it is the tender hand
[22:00] of Jehovah cuz he said I blinded you I
[22:04] did it right so I'm going to give you
[22:08] eternal life for your
[22:10] stand for that Old Testament gospel
[22:13] that's what he's doing but look that's
[22:15] why it's Grace that's why this is the
[22:18] greatest uh show of Grace because God
[22:20] gives somebody eternal life and didn't
[22:22] want
[22:23] it right he's given them white robes
[22:27] unto every one of them I'm reading
[22:29] scripture and it was said unto them that
[22:31] they should rest yet for a little season
[22:34] until their fellow servants also and
[22:36] their Brethren that should be killed as
[22:38] they were should be fulfilled so what
[22:39] are they waiting on they're waiting on
[22:42] 144,000 to be
[22:45] killed right in that last part of in the
[22:48] in the part the first part of 70 weeks
[22:50] or the last part of the Messiah week
[22:51] they're going to get a three and 1/2
[22:52] year Ministry over there right fellow
[22:55] servants
[22:56] Jews but they're going to have the
[22:58] testimony of Jesus Christ because the
[23:01] two prophets are going to go but they're
[23:03] all going to be killed so 144 and two
[23:05] th000 are going to be killed they're
[23:08] going to be put in the same place cuz it
[23:09] says right here and white robes were
[23:10] given unto every one of them and it was
[23:12] said unto them that they should rest yet
[23:15] for a little season in other words
[23:18] John's here in 2,000 years ago on patmas
[23:22] seeing this group of people God's
[23:24] telling them to rest a little while
[23:26] until their fellow servants
[23:28] also and their Brethren which were are
[23:30] Jews that's 144,000 that should be
[23:32] killed as they
[23:34] were they were killed for the testimony
[23:36] of being a Jew the 144,000 is going to
[23:39] be killed by their own
[23:42] people Ian and Hitler killed the Jews
[23:44] cuz they were Jews that was a gentile
[23:46] killing a Jew but in the end time it's
[23:48] going to be a Jew killing a Jew right
[23:51] 144,000 is going to be killed by the
[23:52] Jewish people cuz they're going to all
[23:55] be making sacrifices during that week
[23:58] that three and a half the first the last
[24:00] half of the of the Messiah week the
[24:03] prophets are going to prophesy 1260 days
[24:05] they're going to pull out 144,000 people
[24:07] that's going to be saved they're going
[24:09] to turn around and say hey we don't need
[24:11] to go into that Temple
[24:13] anymore Christ died for us remember they
[24:15] said showen said where'd you get those
[24:17] scars prince in the him the two prophets
[24:20] preached the same
[24:21] message they show the sign of the
[24:24] Messiah just like brother Brown showed
[24:26] the sign of messiah in the seventh
[24:27] Church
[24:28] they took us out of here he's going to
[24:30] show them the sign of Messiah through
[24:31] the two prophets 144,000 is going to
[24:33] believe him be saved and come out well
[24:36] then they're going to turn and say hey
[24:38] we don't need that Temple anymore you
[24:40] say how is that going to make now listen
[24:42] Jews are very weird people they're
[24:44] stomped right their belief is their
[24:47] belief is their belief right right we
[24:49] are still a bunch of dogs to them right
[24:51] so there's no way a Gentiles is going to
[24:53] tell Jew anything that's right all right
[24:55] so those Jews are going to come up and
[24:57] they're going to say we we have waited
[24:58] 2,000 years to get this all right and
[25:02] start making our Temple worship again
[25:04] and now you're telling us you 144,000
[25:08] and2 prophets you're telling us now that
[25:10] we're wrong and you probably helped
[25:13] us you probably helped us get the things
[25:16] together but it's just like us going you
[25:18] go to a Baptist Church when y'all went
[25:20] to a Baptist Church same thing sat there
[25:23] b Baptist Faith was it nobody else was
[25:25] going it going to be the Baptist
[25:26] Methodist Pentecost whatever it was
[25:28] we're going nobody else is going but
[25:30] somebody came in and preached you a
[25:32] message and got you out well guess what
[25:35] they did in the Baptist Church they said
[25:37] well they left us they wern't of us so
[25:40] they left us and praise God they were
[25:42] right that's right we weren't of
[25:45] them but that's the same way the Jews
[25:47] are going to be and those St Jews that
[25:49] said hey why are you breaking down the
[25:52] very thing we tried to we spent 2,000
[25:54] years trying to build this thing up now
[25:56] you're telling us it's worthless well
[25:58] they're going to turn around and kill
[25:59] the two prophets and the 144,000 they're
[26:01] going to physically kill them then
[26:03] they're going to become part of this
[26:05] group not exactly the same part okay not
[26:08] exactly they're not going to be lumped
[26:09] in the same cuz that fifth seal is just
[26:12] the Jews that did not want nothing to do
[26:14] with Jesus Christ but I believe the
[26:16] testimony of these others but they're
[26:18] going to be killed as they were should
[26:19] be fulfilled so when that's fulfilled
[26:22] whatever is going to happen in that
[26:23] period of time that they're dead they
[26:26] could talk to the people that are there
[26:27] or or I don't know what's going to
[26:29] happen but that fifth seal Jew does not
[26:31] care about God I mean does not care
[26:33] about
[26:34] Jesus they don't care about Jesus now
[26:36] they know God they know Jehovah but they
[26:37] don't care a thing about Jesus right so
[26:40] but God's going to give them eternal
[26:41] life because of their stand for what
[26:44] they believed in and he said I'll never
[26:47] forget Israel he said look up in the
[26:49] Stars count the stars look down at the
[26:51] sand he said same way you can't count
[26:54] the stars and can't count the sand I'll
[26:55] never forget it right don't though he
[26:57] divorced her though he put her away
[26:59] though he done all these things and took
[27:01] a gentile bride he's never going to
[27:02] forget Israel cuz there's going to be
[27:04] 144,000 that's going to be living with
[27:06] us in this new city right we're going to
[27:10] be living in the new city that's right
[27:12] they're going to be there as servants
[27:14] they're not wife anymore they they were
[27:17] divorced God married us but he's not
[27:20] going to forget cuz he's going to take
[27:22] 144,000 and put us all in the same place
[27:25] together they going to be servants in
[27:27] the Temple or in the new city and then
[27:30] these fifth sealed Jews let's don't
[27:32] discount them they're not going to be in
[27:33] the city they're going to be outside the
[27:35] city living outside Listen People
[27:37] there's going to be more people living
[27:38] outside the city than they are going to
[27:39] be living inside the city that's right
[27:41] there's going to be more people giving
[27:43] eternal life I think I read a quote the
[27:45] other night brother R said there's going
[27:46] to be more people giving eternal life
[27:49] than they are that's going to receive it
[27:50] here and be able to live in that 1500 m
[27:52] city cuz see they're going to fill the
[27:54] world the world that's 7 billion people
[27:58] in the world now and there still a lot
[27:59] of places that we ain't been cuz there's
[28:02] a lot of ice and and the climate but
[28:03] what if you turn this baby back up
[28:06] there's no ice there's no every all the
[28:08] climates the same you can live you can
[28:10] put 10 billion people on this world
[28:12] right so what are you worried about it
[28:15] might be 10 million people living inside
[28:17] the city but there's billions going to
[28:19] be living outside the city we're going
[28:21] to be able to go out and show them the
[28:24] gospel but we come back in the city cuz
[28:27] that's what we live they're going to be
[28:28] able to come into the city right take a
[28:31] leaf off of the tree to show the healing
[28:33] of the nation and the Bible says Kings
[28:36] so there must be something out there to
[28:37] where somebody is going to be a king
[28:39] somebody's going to be a prince see all
[28:41] this stuff you know we're not going to
[28:42] be just a bunch of people walking around
[28:44] a bunch of zombies walking around doing
[28:46] nothing there's a purpose to have
[28:49] eternal life there's a purpose for us to
[28:52] be here what about that fifth sealed Jew
[28:54] what about the guy that doesn't know
[28:55] anything about Jesus but God gives him
[28:56] eternal life for being good to you sit
[28:59] there for a million years and tell him
[29:01] how God saved your soul tell him how
[29:03] that man died for you cuz he didn't have
[29:05] a clue these fifth seal Jew don't have a
[29:07] clue what what what happened to God they
[29:10] just know he's Jehovah and there's a
[29:12] messiah coming well the 144,000 they're
[29:15] going to realize that they missed the
[29:17] Messiah they're going to accept him and
[29:19] they're going to go in a Rapture but
[29:21] these fifth seal Jews are going to be
[29:22] raised up somewhere and live outside
[29:25] that City but they're going to be the
[29:27] one
[29:28] they're going to be the ones that's
[29:29] going to show as a type though that
[29:32] fifth seal shows the greatest show of
[29:34] Grace because God give you eternal life
[29:39] when you didn't want it
[29:41] right there's your type God give you
[29:44] eternal life you weren't looking for God
[29:47] that's right you weren't asking God for
[29:48] eternal life well you said all yeah was
[29:50] no not at first you weren't that's right
[29:53] he called you and you answered once you
[29:55] answered you begun your journey toward
[29:57] receiving eternal life right all right
[30:00] that's why I said Wednesday
[30:02] night there's a lot of people that's
[30:04] going to be born again I think we ought
[30:07] to get people born again and not even
[30:08] mention the
[30:10] message cuz the message is not the birth
[30:13] right this is the birth out of this if
[30:17] you can prove Jesus Christ died for your
[30:18] sins out of this you got somebody hook
[30:22] but if you just start telling them about
[30:23] prophets and first one thing and another
[30:26] you're going to hear that little
[30:29] and they're going to think you're off in
[30:30] la la land somewhere that's right tell
[30:33] them about Jesus Christ right I didn't
[30:35] when I received the new birth I didn't
[30:38] receive it from William
[30:39] Brown I received it from Jesus Christ
[30:42] but then when I do receive eternal life
[30:44] that's why brother R said I I I don't
[30:45] believe we're getting them to Christ
[30:46] we're getting them to a
[30:49] book something written on a piece of
[30:52] paper no a birth that's why you see many
[30:56] people that some of you I'm going to
[30:57] tell you right now just before we leave
[30:58] I'm going to make you mad some of you
[31:01] I've sent you've come into the to the
[31:03] message after even I come in 98 never
[31:05] seen you in the altar crying for the
[31:06] Holy Ghost never seen it's a birth
[31:08] people it's not just coming to church
[31:09] and sitting down and going I believe the
[31:12] message the devil remember what I said
[31:14] Wednesday night don't talk to the devil
[31:16] about serpent seed he was the one that
[31:18] was there that's right he knows what
[31:20] happened that's right he knows there's
[31:22] only one God don't don't trick don't
[31:24] talk to the devil about stuff like that
[31:26] but we need birth in this church we need
[31:28] somebody get their life straightened up
[31:30] get a birth and then you know what it'll
[31:32] take you to this right here your birth
[31:36] will take you to the message of the hour
[31:37] it will not and cannot take you anywhere
[31:40] else cuz it's a birth of this word right
[31:43] here and of course this is this the
[31:46] Amplified version that's right know the
[31:48] Amplified version This Is The Love
[31:50] Letter this tell This Is The Love Letter
[31:51] but this is the BL between the lines
[31:53] this will tell you what's written
[31:54] between the lines that nobody's going to
[31:56] receive MH this book is absolutely
[31:58] sealed to anybody that's not born again
[32:01] amen it's sealed up you can't understand
[32:04] this book but when you're born again you
[32:07] understand what Jesus did for you amen
[32:09] you understand what the Holy Ghost did
[32:11] for you then you go back and say
[32:16] oh this is what it was talking
[32:19] about this is what it was saying to
[32:22] me love letter the between the lines
[32:25] that's right but I'm telling you and I
[32:27] if it makes you mad you're the one that
[32:28] I'm talking
[32:30] to I've not seen people in the altar
[32:33] seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:35] you just see people appear in church and
[32:37] they sit down then most of the time when
[32:40] that happens sooner or later you see
[32:43] them
[32:44] disappear but he didn't get a birth you
[32:47] got to go get a birth the birth is a
[32:49] mess a real
[32:52] mess it was a mess for me you're not
