brother Louise and the family they traveled back tomorrow I think tomorrow yeah okay tomorrow there'll be in uh youth service this week that Pat this past week and it just really Thrills our heart to see that many youth there and that right now that's really refreshing to see a lot of different youth from different places and um they still love the same God they still have the same problems they have the same demons they're just different names right everywhere you go it's supposed to say in Jamaica I said you got same demons they're just called by different names amen so we got to fight them we're going to fight them we win we've already won we just gotta fight the battle just keep fighting the battles don't put your sword down keep fighting um and also remember the sign up sheet

we'll say it one more time it's you think I'm gonna get in trouble and make you mad before we get started but you think you're so important I guess till you wait to the very end you say well I'm coming or a week after you can't do that if you've got a doctor's appointment tomorrow at nine o'clock guess what you prepared to go to that doctor's appointment because you know it's then if you're

together we have to get little things for every couple and for every person and gifts and prizes we give away a lot of money that day but we want to be able to um to have that banquet where we can have enough food for everybody and it would be embarrassing to have 25 people show up I mean uh 50 people you cook for 50 people and 75 people show up because they didn't want to write their name down all right so get you a babysitter you've known this I've been announcing it since December all right so next Wednesday that's today next Wednesday we're taking that sheet down and I'll promise you don't ask can you come after that time you will probably get mad at me I like it when it's quiet because listen we do it's it's an effort y'all just don't know the effort and a lot and I'm listen we're all built for that we're built to do that we don't begrudgingly do it we do it for y'all we pay for everything so just be real courteous and say yes I'm coming and go write your name down

about them you just make sure you write your name down if you're coming and then show up at the banquet make sure you wear a proper attire this is not blue jeans and t-shirts all right you need to somewhat dress up a little bit amen and I wanted one more thing before we get started I do not know how in the world and why a man would want to change himself into a woman I've had to dress Jim for four or five days I never put so many hooks straps pins hair clips sister Alicia I did a good job Wednesday night though I braided her hair how many you guys can do that ah yeah I didn't today because we were running a little bit late but but um I don't know why in the world just put on your G IGS in your shirt and come on to church you know no not with a sister you can't do that it will listen it will make me a little more lenient with some of you sisters that might show up a little bit late get your husband you might get it but we thank the Lord for prayers for sister Jim her her Pain's been minimal and she's uh she's a she's a good patient amen there's some that are not good patients she's a good patient so sign up Remember by the 25th that's coming all right brother Dutch Scott will be with us that weekend on February the 12th we'll have one service on Sunday also remember house house Kip she in his rehab so he's conscious oh praise God Amen man when we were there last Saturday he was not he was out and they were they were thinking the worst but we see that that the best we're gonna let we're gonna let God assist the assistance and let him do his work through the rehab people and we'll get a report that he'll come out of this and looking like death five days ago wonderful looking like life now amen that's the kind of God we serve you just go believing and keep believing keep pushing keep pressing listen the victory belongs to you and me the victory is not belonged to the devil it belongs to me and you so let's go to the word of God this would be part 85 and want to kind of move it over just a little bit and I was thinking yesterday about a certain thing about discernment so we'll get into that real quick so um remember all those that are out sick Mom Dad um sister Freda y'all know you've been keeping up with her we've been praying with her on the phone different things keeping keeping her on our prayers and you just keep doing that you keep fighting for her man keep fighting for I want somebody to fight for me if I had to if I had to fight like that and she's fighting so we are fighting with her and remember both Paul too taking care of her and all the different things it's just a devil maybe to see what we'll do about it man so let's go to the Lord in prayer dear Lord thank you for this day you give us forgive us of our faults and our failures we're human beings but Lord as you said through brother Ernie we always think about it we're we're not human beings having a spiritual experience we're spiritual people Lord having a human experience we've come to this earth Lord the Holy Ghost that's in Silas was before the foundation of the world it's a part of you uh we're going to read Lord we're we're the prophet of God says we are your righteousness because ours is filthy rags and Lord I pray that you be with us today we were the ones that are sick bless the ones that are on highways bless the ones that are that are doing the work in a foreign country father also remember brother Noel Johnson and sister Shirley Lord as she keep up we keep up with them Lord by email and they're over in India doing the work there for a few months we pray that you'd protect them keep the sickness away from them keep diseases Lord away from them and may their Journeys and travel be wonderful and then come back home with a good report father we pray that you would just take care of us now be with us in this service you give Revelation because we can't father just use us by your grace Jesus name we pray amen this would be part 85 when the son of man in the beginning was the word words with God and the Word was God and what the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can go ahead and sit down also remember Sister Monica and the kids and and them are over in Beaufort I think they had a shower or something for for Esther you know she's getting married in March so remember that to RSVP to that if you're going to go all right it's about four hours from here and it will be on the 25th of March I left my thing in the back but I'm pretty sure that's what it is so that's where sister Monica and them are today so let's just remember them in prayer Genesis 2 9 now we're going to talk today about knowledge and knowledge has two parts to it there's human natural knowledge and then there's a knowledge that came off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil get by with me all right there's two trees one is the Tree of Life God said if you'll eat from that tree you'll never die but the first bite you take off of this tree you're gonna die all right so that's one remember what happened we know what happened in the Garden of Eden we don't have to discuss that we're all Home Folks today we don't have to discuss what went on in the garden all right so we know that it was the fall of Man the fall of mankind and as soon as that happened man became became began to have to take a sacrifice Abel Cain there's many people in the message of preachers that that that I know that sadly think that Abel was so righteous he didn't need a sacrifice well you're gonna have to change the Bible you're gonna have to change your prophet's message he was born in sin he was born by an act that should have never been the same way as Cain Cain was born by an actor should have never been so they both needed a sacrifice they both were lost just Abel got a revelation and we're going to read here in just a few minutes to put brother around say about Revelation there's nothing more powerful than a revelation and I'll read it to you in just a little while because we're talking about knowledge today that's where Revelation comes it comes from a knowledge of what the truth but now you can keep a knowledge of the truth and die and go to hell those who have come to the knowledge of the truth remember we're going to read that in just a little bit so Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge me me and Whom Shall he make to earns to stand Doctrine me them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the brass in other words growth development that's what we're talking about we're in talking about adoption and and placing of sons God I was listening to a minister last night and he did a real good job you know brother Brown said this bride been Brides brides churches Brides churches he continues all the way down he said but they'll come one see listen we're a bride out of a bride we're a bride out of a church we're a church out of a church everybody with me because we're the bride but there's been Brides down Through the Ages there's been Brides there's been Brides in every Church age but he said they would come one there'll be a group of people that'll be the Bride of laodicea but there'll be a group that will be called out of that to a body change so there'll be a group of people inside of a group of people and that's us there's no more Church ages back that way I'm sure we're living in laodicea but we're not of laodicea we have listen if you got laid out to see your ideas you're lost well truth anyhow and then what Isaiah 53 where are we going to find this knowledge we're going to find it in Jesus Christ it's not our righteous this is not our knowledge I'll read it to you in a few minutes we're a very familiar scripture he says your ways are not my ways your thoughts are not my cause my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so if you think your thoughts were something you better match it to that one and if it's contrary to that one it's come from somebody else it comes from that other guy by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many who me let's make this personal today for he shall bear their iniquity he bore our iniquity he took our shame he washed us and cleaned us up listen if he picked that jar up praise God if God picks you up out of the world then he's got something to do with you he didn't pick you up and say I don't think I want to use that but I'll use another one listen God doesn't ever make a mistake he never makes a wrong move if he reaches sister Regina if he reaches he's going to do something with it you and I may reach for something not don't want to use that but he doesn't reach for something and not use it but remember he said there's vessels of what honor and there's vessels of Dishonor all right and that's made up with you you understand which one that is because you know what you can you can let God pick you up in justification you can let him clean you up in sanctification but you can say no I don't want you to use me fully you can say that yourself and stop and be the the quote where brother Brown says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit which is that sanctification part and die and go to hell you got to have the inside God the unclean Spirit has got to go out the inside guy and then we were talking um now today go and pull the chart up if you don't mind please we were talking the other day we know now that the unclean Spirit if you're born again today if you're born again baptized with the Holy Ghost the fire of God has cleaned your soul out you're perfect if he cleaned you out you're perfect your bride but he doesn't want to just put the baby in the closet Brother Anderson if they can't find it that's okay but if I can I appreciate you pulling it up we don't need to stay babies we need to eat we need to be a functional group of Believers not just well I'm in the message I don't cut my hair don't do this or do this I don't do that or do this don't do that you can be lost as Judas Judas had a Ministry cast out Devils went to church he was the treasurer of the church brother Brown said held the money back and he fooled everybody but one man he didn't fool the son of man he fooled every one of them but one guy and that's why we've come to a place where we we're going to start talking about the son of man a little bit later because the son of man never was fooled that's right never never was he fool never did he not have an answer and everyone never what did he back up from a challenge amen but some of us see that's what I mean about babies when we become babies we back up from a challenge sometimes because we don't know how to handle it we don't have enough knowledge we don't have enough virtue that's why I said there's going to be Christians that that praise God they're Christians but don't even go live in the city I said Christians I say bride bride lives in the city there's gonna be a lot of Christians a lot of people save because there's a group of people that believes John 3 16. they'll come to a Sanctified condition and that's as far as they can go that's as far as their teachers can teach them that's as far as their denomination to let them go but if they live the true word of God they will be saved but not full of the Holy Ghost read anointing ones at the end time folks like somebody said one time I read that first thing and it scared me to death it ought to scare you to death and I'll scare you to death that we've been sitting here in the message Church 50 or 60 years and ain't got enough discernment for stuff don't have enough discernment or no right from wrong um and you know I mean as we get closer to the headstone it should be easier for us to believe the word of God act on the word of God and become the word of God should be easier it's easier for you to be a functional human being a baby it's not a functional human being can they take yourself to the store can they can they drive a car can they make decisions about their life no what do they need they need an adult they need a five-fold Ministry to teach them how to get to there then if they become a baby and stay a baby it's your fault if you sit on the ministry though that teaches you the right thing like we have had for 50 years then there's no excuse for you to stay a baby good to be a baby we've got some of you that's told me that you've got you've got the holy ghost in the last year that's great you're a baby Christ but remember there isn't there is a oh it's just the door's wide open you don't have to say well do I need to go over here do I need to go over here is that right is this right no this is true and see that comes from your soul that's the faith or doubt that's all we got today then in the spirit realm is what we're working on these virtues because the spirit is what imagination conscious memory reason affection see that's where Satan got to Eve in that Spirit Realm because in her soul she was eternal God purpose that for a reason because Adam was eternal he put eternal life in Adam he put eternal life in Eve because she was a part of him listen the Reason God put eternal life in Jesus Christ is because he put it in you is he not the first Adam are we not the second Eve we're not going to fall like that first Steve did though but some has denominations back in the ages they fell that's why Christ had to put them away that's why I had Brides brides churches Brides churches listen he put her away and gave her a writing of divorcement that's why it's so important to understand marriage and divorce so much in the spiritual realm as you do in the natural realm you got to understand that we are and can be prostitutes to this word we can take on a new doctrine Hey listen I'm so glad a prophet came in the end time aren't y'all glad it Prophet came in in town because he stood there one day and he told us he said he said I was Discerning that's what we're going to get to I was Discerning this brother remember tells the story and he said I went to talk to that brother about what run around on his wife right he thought this brother was running around on his wife because he had an adultered Spirit on him am I with me what was his problem he was not an adulterer he was fooling with a denominational church now come on somebody that's that ought to tell you one thing's for sure be careful what you got stuck in your head oh that's out there no it's in here we have a denominational idea of sitting right here because if it's your own idea it's a denominational idea amen so now we're working then in the spirit realm and that's where Satan he can he can forget about the body the body only moves as I'm telling my hands to move if I tell them to stop they stop they just don't continue doing this right so don't worry about your body you might listen our body's falling apart there's nothing we can do about that at the moment oh yours okay brother Kylie I know he's smiling so am I my knee that never my knees never hurt I turn one way and found out I haven't a left knee that was hurting it was because I was outside playing football with somebody or just cause I was walking come on now but we have to take care of this body we understand that but but going out the other side he said you worry about what goes in the heart because out of the heart I'm speaking to you today I hope you believe that I hope you believe that out of the heart a holy ghost-filled person can teach you something not this world listen all those with my cicado uh James Thompson all them different ones they have their points they have their times but I listen to the prophet of God I know that's right I don't know what cause listen when they teach what they teach what's their idea God's three hell's eternal hello somebody you never thought about that have you when they speak their knowledge their discernment of the Bible is wrong amen because they're trinitarians that's why God had to send us a prophet to straighten all that out and praise God you've ever I read this the other day and read it different now behold I send you Elijah the prophet now remember we always say you he didn't say he didn't say I turned the head he said I turn your heart he went right down into the soul of man and to prove it he discerned the thoughts and intents of their heart what's discernment going on that was down in the soul part that wasn't in their Spirit he went way down in that throne room he said I can feel that you're a Christian or he says You're Not Safe son you need to get saved and God will heal you from that smoking or heal you from whatever that is and he even does old mama would stand there she'd be crying and he said I see you got a son that's lost now that went from her mind sure she was thinking about that was the filter that he came through but it was down in her soul that's my kids when Hattie Rock said that ain't nothing but the truth that came from her soul that did not come from her affection yeah you saw it was no it came from what it came from agape love that was inside the lady to speak and her kids were saved we ought to try that sometime but the unclean unclean spirits going out it's out of our soul now that's why that's okay we're good we're ready but the spirit realm is where the Bible is it's where the fight is you see those two swords up there that's where the fight is it's in the spirit realm it's in a place of discernment look discernment it's the kitchen it's where you eat it's where you get fed it's where you let out what's inside you ever heard that before but that's what we're working on now those of you that are born again we are working on the spirit Realm the one you live in 99 of your time because according to the Bible that your soul is now sitting in Heavenly places tomorrow's Monday right that's not a Heavenly place I'm sorry for those of you that need to work those you don't work don't worry about it we're going to work so we pay your salary okay keeping all afloat that's what I tell them men at the store they said where you going I said I'm going to work so you don't have to like I said keep going pay taxes but their Spirit realm affection reason memory conscious imagination that all listen when you were born you had those qualities because you're a human right but that affection was what the Bible says set your affections on things above so our affection was set where on things below our affection was we loved the world and the things of the world we reasoned away I'm not going to church I might get something amen listen if you have some of y'all are sick on on Sunday don't worry once you get up Monday you'll be healed maybe we need we don't need prayer line on Monday you just automatically get healed you go right on to work and everything's fine Sunday is oh okay we can't hardly make it I'll be working tomorrow though our memory our conscious in our imagination how many times have you seen heard people say I imagine that's you God don't imagine nothing he don't sit and imagine something and and what about a brain though but think about what we're going to have if we have the mind of Christ it's supposed to be heading toward that direction to where our thoughts are his thoughts our ways are his ways that's why Paul said we need the mind of Christ in the Old Testament he said your ways are not my ways but I'm coming to show you the way to think like I do you say we can't do that yes you can no I'm sorry you can't but yes you can through him if you get him in that control tower but what was all these virtues it was to obey what God Said is What brought the power so if we don't have power in our life we're not doing everything God told us to do okay that's what brought the powers what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God and remember obedience is better than sacrifice sometimes the word of God is sharp it's cutting we have emotions we have feelings we have all these things that's human the human but what does the word of God say that's the that's the top line that ain't the bottom line that's the Top Line what does the word of God say well I don't think I ought to have to go to church what's the word of God say just go back to the word of God I'd hate to have to know I couldn't go to church have you ever had that attitude tell me you already get that attitude that you what programs they can't wait for the doors get up that's exactly what I'm talking about my desire is to go to church now if I got the same Spirit you do you ought to have the same desire now when it's great Elijah comes what he'll be taking the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the face of the father's work in their heart van work on the outside guy or the middle guy they didn't look because they didn't keep the same faith that was back there at the beginning we read Abraham's Covenant but watch John appears he turns the hearts like I said before we'll skip through that I just said told you that that's what Elijah is to do come and change your heart not your head not give you head knowledge and I listen I've heard people in the message and I can't stand this one thing I can't stand is I know more than you do I know more than you do so I don't have to listen to you I know more than you do brother Brown sat down one time in lesson two who was it he listened to uh what was the president before Ford Nixon he sat down and listened to Nixon when he was in Washington before they had that video he sat down and listened no not to a sermon but he listened to a speech because in turn that that president came to want to Warner Brothers meet of course he wasn't president then he was like a senator or something brother Brown never said I'm not going down there to listen to that guy because I know more than he does now that's a totally horrible attitude to have all right I know some of us we did the same thing we have our favorite preachers and we have our ones that we don't want around anymore listen if they've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost surely they say sorry one thing that'll help you I'll clap for that one [Applause] I will restore to you the years that the locusts eat look what we have in the end time we have the ability for that bride tree to be restored to its fullness so it can grow fruit out at the end so it can have leaves so it can have Fellowship and have Fellowship not because everybody likes your ship now praise the Lord anyhow and you shall eat him praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed I am not ashamed of this Bible I'm not ashamed of this message of the hour I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed God sent a prophet I'm not ashamed to go to little church because I want to come to that right there I want to come to die I want you to come more than I do me because maybe God will put somebody that'll help me tell me y'all with your wings on you help me please the position of a believer now this is adoption real quick does everybody understand adoption or do I need to go over it anybody not okay now then I'll let you know then so what happens don't think Hey listen we're not leaving anybody we're brain taking everybody with us hey man we're going everybody's going we're not leaving somebody so listen adoption is not when you say that in your head as an American you think of that you can't have a child or you you see somebody in foster care and you want to adopt them into your family that's not what that means because listen God does not adopt Satan's kids he adopts his kids he already has if you'll grow to that you've all got the potential but look as soon as the boy is born in other words as soon as you're born again you're a child of God and you get all the potential everything God has in the Bible everything God has in the message of the hour you get that power inside of you amen well as soon as he the boy was born he was the son of that family he was born into that family but he was not adopted he was not somewhere to where he looked the the father looks over and says here run my Factory takes the keys and throws them out of the yard or takes him and sticks him in his mouth you see that's the baby but you don't say well that's not my kid anymore no once a son you're a son once you're born again God can't take that back he won't take it back he has a purpose for you somewhere down the line the father loved him of course then we talk about Galatians we've been over this before a little bit we're going to continue to go over it again so what happened when the Full Gospel Church began way under years ago they became sons of God listen if like I said before the bride has been in every Church age that's sons of God but they have not come to full adoption because full adoption is every word of God correct every word of God that precedeth out of the mouth of God not every word of God trinitarian every word of God eternal hell have a word of God baptized father son that's not the word of God am I with me on this that's not the word of God that's why God had to send us a prophet so there's no there's no excuse if you sit here and listen to whoever it is the holy spirit's your tutor the things you used to do you don't do anymore why because if you do the same thing you did before where's the spirit of the one that did it now we know that it moves out into the second round everybody with me then that's when we have problems too right that's when that's when the devil can can punch back listen the devil didn't punch me when I was in the world I wanted his he'd Pat me on the back said go buddy go buddy well guess what when I got born again God said go buddy I got on the right team and the Holy Spirit is the tutor to raise them in admonition of God not to raise you emotionally but spiritually that's why look they hated they hated Jesus Christ they hated him enough to kill him you're Beelzebub we don't even like you to be in this Temple come on somebody that was the son of man that was what you and I are supposed to be right now today the world eventually I promise you the world will hate you as much as they hate Jesus Christ if you become Jesus Christ if you stay with half the world and halfway look they don't care they don't care anymore it really doesn't matter you do whatever you want to and you're going to heaven my Bible says let's go back to the Bible my Bible says Hell hath enlarged its Gates hell happened for what cause hell wasn't made for humans it was made for the devil and his angels that's why the prophet of God said you crawl over the cross to get to hell and there's going to be a lot of good religious people in hell I'm sorry now so Tudor's been watching down Through the Ages he's watching and listen God knows your heart look at look at David I mean about any yellow murder I didn't mean to say that yeah turn the cameras off ain't y'all been a liar it more more than twice okay alter David was a liar it was an adulterer he didn't just murder his best friend he premeditated to murder his best friend to take his wife because he'd done what he did but God said he's a man after my own heart you know what he said and he said he said this guy there's the son of David why he looked at David's heart we've had the same you say well I've never killed anybody brother rapson you kill him with your influence we try to look at all the physical things a lot of times they're spiritual that's why we want to work in that Spirit realm more than we've ever worked before is have I have I offended my brother have I offended my sister am I doing the right thing am I doing the wrong thing listen God that's why God give us a five-fold Ministry to break these things down and and I appreciate these brothers that's been here that that break it down and the ones that are here today uh well one of them but the other the other two is overseas they couldn't get here this morning they have an excuse but look they've seen the age of birth you say born again that's right correct you're just as much a son as you ever will be when you're born again but but what brother Branham but the Tudor bringing word to the father then if the Father the tutor comes to the father and a boy becomes about age about where the church ought to be now age in other words able to drive able to write his check able to run the company when he comes of age brightened up praise God we all need that seasoned according to Time when the boy become of age the tutor come to the father who's the tutor the Holy Ghost now listen there's not three there's not a there's not a person down here that goes to a person up here and Holy Ghost is just God in another form and he's in the form where he's watching you to see what you'll do and see the boy being a son already but yet if he wasn't a worthy son the father could not adopt him or place him in his own family so remember it's not like the it's not like adoption like we think about adoption you adopting what you're doing is let me tell you what this is this is adopting what's in the father into the sun his father his own blood his own genetics his own person amen isn't that what the new birth is putting God in us all right so he puts God in us and then what we're supposed to act like that would be God if he wasn't a worthy son the father couldn't adopt him or place him in his own family look he couldn't do it because the boy would run through what he had he was a Restless child he didn't have the ability to carry on with his father's work look so the father didn't throw him out the father didn't throw the particles on out the prodigal son left so the father just let him go on as a son he was already a son but if he was a fine boy he was about his father's business and the tutor brought word to the father saying that the son is fine he's eligible he's all right then the father took the son out in a public place as a public testimony and he put a special robe on him and set him up before the people and father by doing this give the son of the son the authority over his kingdom over his business that's why God gives us power and authority we just gotta get it and listen then we got to know how to use it that's why power without character is what satanic the son had a right to go out and do certain things in the Kingdom listen we have a right to do things we have a right to pray for the sick we have a right to testify we have a right to baptize people doesn't take just a preacher can we find brother Dale or me or whoever no do it yourself here we set they're not we set but here shall a crowd of people the greatest healing campaign that ever been since the since Jesus Christ was here was William brownham right he was getting ready to call a prayer line and and I'm just saying all right this is us not adopting got to come up here and let me pray for you I'm this I'm Prophet you gotta come listen to me you got to come up here and let me pray for you I'm the one that did it all right and I'm gonna lay my hands on you no look girl come to the little lady comes to a prayer line with a baby he said oh sister I see you so and so on so and so he said oh he said your baby's healed see that sister's sitting right there was a mama she laid her hands on you and prayed and entered into that with you and you're healed he said give God praise he curse it all now women I still need to pray for you because I'm I'm a so-and-so no God would have never used William Brown if he had been that way he was the most humble man that ever was amen and he gave all the glory to God and please let us be that way to everything we have we give the glory to God not the glory to some man all right and do certain things in the Kingdom with the same kind of authority that his father had so now that starts with virtue and that virtue what is strength and Powers not being a virgin it's good to be a virgin but it means strength and power a virtuous woman a bride is a crown to her husband you and I are the crowning effect of Jesus Christ you and I don't worry we got you know the Bible says talk about crowns and crowns and crowns don't worry there's not gonna be cement crowns on your head because the Bible says we throw them all down at his feet and we crowd him king of kings and him Lord of lords I ain't worried about a crown that's right listen you know why they put crowns on people's head you know why Authority number one but in the Greek when they had an Olympics if you won the Olympics they gave you a crown that was your that was what you wanted for finishing the race a lot of times it wasn't a crown that you see but it was a crown it was something it was something what to say hey this guy he ran this race anyone listen when you were in that witness racing and and when you're not gonna get a great big Crown you are the Clown hello but he didn't maketh ashamed his rottenness in his bones so now let's talk about knowledge everybody with me are we good today hot up here and besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge what does knowledge mean knowledge means no cease now watch what it means too though in the big letters such as belongs to the more advanced okay you say well brother I'm I'm I'm I'm just a baby you have an opportunity to know more it has been presented to you it's given to you in Book and Tape form it's given to you on Sunday and on Wednesday if you want to know where to find God he comes in this door at night about 9 30 when y'all get down and sit down in the Pew and then he leaves with you and comes back at two o'clock Where's God well I just told you oh so you just believe this is just a place we come when we see it no Heavenly places is your position the prophet of God said your position in Christ that's Heavenly places is him being able to put you as a teacher and as a Sunday School director and as a song leader and as a piano player and a music player and thank God for all these musicians we got I wish we had a stage enough to put all of them but I you know what maybe we can do it and shifts or something maybe I don't know but we got so many musicians now I praise God for that because you're using your talent even a little Sarah in different ones they're being playing the piano amen I'm playing the piano and then Ryan jumps up here and plays the piano one day hmm such as belong to the more advanced especially if things look lawful and unlawful for Christians discern we'll get into that in just a second moral wisdom such as as seen in right living Psalms 139 23 says search me o God and know my heart my heart try me oh we don't want that part we don't want that part let's leave that one out no try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me I love that song too by the way lead me in the way Everlasting Isaiah 55 7 says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon listen we're all thieves murders Liars Stealers adulterers David he said right here he abundantly pardon you for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts that's the Old Testament but when we come over to the New Testament Paul says we need to have the mind of Christ we need to think his thoughts did we get brother Brown comes up and said you will think it starts when you keep coming up as Faith virtue and all the temple patience then you become a Powerhouse Powerhouse not a refrigerator that makes ice cubes you don't Ice Cube does you know what icicle does that's an icicle you get fire got built under you one day you'll see what's going on get out of the refrigerator and out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree and here we go with the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden now we know who is that that's Jesus Christ we're not we understand that all right it was a person it wasn't a tree growing in the ground it was a person the tree of life and immense look in the midst of the garden in the heart of the garden it's where that tree of life should be but we chose the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil to be in that place he said I didn't have a choice yeah brother Brown said you did by accepting what Adam and Eve did and the Lord said behold the man has become as one of us this is after the fall to no good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand he take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever in other words there was no Gap God had to take that and make a gap or an enmity he had to get away from man come on somebody he put He did he cut I can't stand that sin no more I can't walk in the garden with you I know what you've done and also taking the tree life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when she was taken so he drove out the man and he placed him at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and flaming swords which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life but he did not say that you'll never get back to the Tree of Life because he became the Tree of Life he said I am the way the truth and the life the cherubims didn't what brought brother Brown tell us he told us the cherubims were there to keep us from that but he said now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost those cherubims are what they're giving authority to lead us back to the Tree of Life to get us back in the Garden of Eden if y'all like this place I'm just sorry I do not like this place the Lord God commanded man instead of every tree of the garden you'll eat freely eat all you want but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that you eat it therefore Thou shalt surely die and we know that man has died ever since amen Adam died 900 something years old but Adam died Eve died probably 900 something years old she died my two's really different ones they all died every man's died we know there's anak and then you know that's another whole sermon and Jesus Christ even died oh Jesus died okay the Christ didn't die the Holy Ghost didn't die but Jesus the body died nobody with me on that all right he didn't become Jesus listen now he didn't become Jesus the human until 2000 years ago hello he was theophany God he was Jehovah how many times we've been preached on Genesis 1 26. that was theophany that was fair God but that Spirit God had to become flesh and dwell Among Us and be born from a virgin had to be born from a womb just like you were to take on what our sin he came down in the midst of this Garden to take away the mist from this Garden mist everybody with me some of you got that you smiled some of you still well you got to open your eyes to be able to smile they said these are in this right in the Book of Revelations I Know Thy works and thy labor is my patience and how count thou cannot bear them which are evil Corinthians and all the different ones they had false Doctrine back in the first church age and thou has tried them when say the apostles and are not and has found them Liars they were tried and found to be liars and that's born in patience and for my name's sake has labored and not fainted nevertheless I have something against it because I've left thy first love remember therefore from West our fault remember where you fell from remember where you you saw what you just said I couldn't fall I didn't say you couldn't backslide you're a Christian you backslide but like brother Brown said you sent us in you'll reap it up for look at David look at David murder liar Thief adulterer man after my own heart but you did what you did you can't build me a temple he said the sword will always be in your house remember the boys all his boys were every one of them almost were just Rascals they went in into their half-sister and they took over the kingdom and Absalon and all the different ones and all that was one it was really horrible come from David's loins but there wasn't Solomon that came to you so remember that therefore from which they are falling and repent and look do your first word turn your heart back yes or else I'll come until then remove your candlestick out of this place except I'll repair but this thou has that thou hated the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate God's a loving God yeah God's loving God but he hates nickel and spirit I'm reading you the Bible all right he didn't have to near let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches to him that overcometh well I give to eat of the tree of life oh now we can get back First Church age Holy Ghost found LED Pentecost started the first church age amen now we can get back to the tree of life that's what you're eating on now if you're born again you're eating on that tree of life you're eating he he told him he said eat my he might eat my blood which is in the Mist do you know what Paradise the God is right now sitting inside of you oh no you know and it's okay I I'm not gonna be uh mean but you know people die and they don't know the truth and they say oh so-and-so's walking the streets to go with Jesus right now well no he's not according to the prophet that don't happen until we get way over in the future home see thank God for a teacher we know they're in the sixth Dimension we know they're in a place of bliss they're in a place of what they're in a place of Eternity but guess what they said to brother Branham we gotta come back down yeah famous gotta come back here and pick up what connected them to this Earth was their human body praise God that we got a prophet to tell us that then these Earthly Tyrrell knuckle if it be dissolved you got one waiting where's it waiting it's inside of you yeah Isaiah 28 said Whom Shall he teach knowledge like I said before me and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine me then there are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast will continue with knowledge this is what man says about knowledge it's the fact or condition of knowing something with familial familiarity I always had a hard time saying that the other day it's in other words that's familiar gain through what experience our association acquaintance with their understanding of science art technique the fact or condition of being aware of something you have a knowledge of something there's a knowledge that something's going on in this building today there's a knowledge that something's going on in your everyday life there's a knowledge of something that's going on in your family life there's a knowledge of something that's that well praise God somebody say Amen it's God you say well I'm thinking the bad thoughts you need to start thinking the good ones your guardian angel does not take a vacation praise God we'd all be dead by now mine's gonna look like an MMA fighter they lost but praise God we got one brother said what Believers have angels and you know what they're not one of them if they're from God they're not contrary to God they have the mind of God so they're not going to steer you wrong if somebody steers you wrong that's the other guy got involved the fact they're conditioned to being aware of something the range of one's information or understanding now see that's man's knowledge of being a doctor or or or you know having all these degrees but not with God we had a seventh grade education man that couldn't say much he probably couldn't say that word either but you know what I understood everything he said there wasn't one time I said what'd he say no I know exactly what he was talking because he's talking like me the Bible said Jesus the Common People heard him gladly he must have spoke a very common language the circumstance or condition of what apprehending truth we're not going to be stabs to a perfect man apprehending false Doctrine or factory reasoning Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy as a man that findeth wisdom and the man that geteth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchand National Silver and the game therefore a fight goal listen it's good to have money but I'm going to tell you something it's gonna burn that's money's not going to get us out of here and if we love it it's the root of all evil not it's not bad to have it but it says the love of money is the root of all evil see it's more precious than rubies who is she now look I'll stop here just a second who's he talking about what you talking about he talks about wisdom talks about understanding and happy is the man that findeth this so this she is not the man this she is you Miss wisdom Miss Grace not disgrace Miss Grace she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou cast desire are not can be to be compared unto her Length of days is in her right hand and then her left hand riches and honor that's the kind I want her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life she is a tree of life not he we've been transformed she is him can you believe that she is a tree of life to them that what lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her you know what retain means hold so you can use it you put you give a lawyer a retainer and that in other words that makes him wear when you call him he's got to answer your phone call he don't blow you off you give him a retainer all right you give him something to hold on to what you got well happy is everyone that what retaineth her the Bible says that if you're good to a saint God to be good to you a cup of water in my name will not be forgotten that's why the the the the the glory and honor of God is inside of you today and the world is only being held together because we're still here only thing that's holding us together because I'm telling you the Gentiles will absolutely destroy each other they all they all want to destroy Israel anyway so they're destroying they're going to destroy their self and then they're going what circle around Israel and then who's going to come on and saying God's going to fight for Israel because he can't forget them even though he divorced him even though they went out and sinned and did the things they did God said I'll not ever forget Israel because I was once married to you and you turned away from me I had to give you a writing a divorcement so I can take a gentile bride knowledge now that don't mean world in all this because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge let me stop right here real quick you kids go to school get you a diploma a degree you can't make it in this world without it I'm sorry if the if time tarries I do not want to see you you're going to struggle enough with a degree hey man so get an education all right whether it be homeschooling or what I'm I'm not I'm I any time you can get a diploma it doesn't matter to me how you get it but you need to get a diploma you need to go to school because that's foolishness to God but now some of that junk they're teaching with creationism and are not creationism but Darwinism and all that stuff you can be a you got to be the Holy Ghost to your kids if they bring that stuff home go to that teacher say we don't believe in Darwin we're Christians We Believe see you stand up for if you'll stand up for me I'll stand up for you I'm reading the Bible knowledge to what judge what right from wrong how do you judge it you don't judge it by emotion don't judge it by feeling you judge by the word of God then if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong you judged one day that trinitarianism was right but it was a wrong judgment but one day when you saw the truth something inside of you just like sister had to write said that ain't nothing but the truth this message when you see this message and you see see the message you gotta say in your soul that ain't nothing but the truth now you're getting knowledge that's Supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man and woman of God all right all right let me continue let me get through some of this you don't add nothing because it ain't you ain't got it to add what you got to do you haven't got knowledge enough to know of God yet that the Bible doesn't contradict itself I think everybody's sitting in this room we don't have any strangers Among Us I think everybody in this room understands that the word of God's right amen and that's what we live by amen and we live by the enhanced version of the message of the hour with the Bible all right it's not another Bible it's not something instead of the Bible it's the Bible completely just like to me that's what this message is when you read the message and you get a revelation you're like pow man it can't be no way how many times you sit down look at something you go well it couldn't be no way other way than that but millions of other people think it's that way why Revelation we're going to get to that in a minute but when you can see that scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see by revelation of God look the whole world the whole word is written in mystery and only the knowledge of God can reveal it man can't do it like I said before when I was praying God you revealed to these people before I come out I said God you revealed something to these people that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say punctuated with a amen then add that to your faith but around us pray and Build Me Up Lord into this let Christ be my head that working through me on my Foundation my faith is in him that virtue and all his temper patience godliness brotherly kindness work in Me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sinkered around have we come to that this is I I'm sold to this message I'm sold to this message of the hour you can bring me something else that's okay you're wasting your time you know the old brother always said I rest my soul on Malachi 4. well I don't rest my soul exactly on what Malachi 4 says I rested on the whole Bible all right but I do rest it on Malachi 4 that he sent me a prophet for God has set in a church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists All For What the Perfection of the Saints and bringing all these virtues into it for the Perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are a material off of that one this is the material off this he's talking about the taxi perfect man belonging into them they're pouring out of him down through them amen real quick the prophet of God told us in the 70th week of Daniel he said the spirit of wisdom is coming into the church now if you look where brother Randall was standing just for a minute look where he was standing all right there was Baptist Pentecostal Methodist Oneness job Witness Mormons all sitting in the congregation they all thought they had the spirit of wisdom amen I think some people would kill you for their religion or at least hate you if you're against that religion but the prophet of God said the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in we're not living in Baptist day Methodist day Pentecostal day we're living in the day of the coming of the son of man that's what we're trying to get to but we've got to get the Son of God solidified and know that you know that you know that God can put that top on top listen building a house building a building make sure what Foundation is good first when somebody comes in to build something in the city of Gillsville we have a he stops at the foundation because we got an inspector that comes and inspects that Foundation to make sure it's up to code first then he puts the walls up puts the sticks up puts everything together and then he comes back out again and he inspects it to make sure it's sound then you put your roof on then you're stuck then after that he really don't have to come around until the very end of it almost what would it be really gay would be electrical and plumbing and stuff like that but that has nothing to do with the structure structure of the house at the two before is the foundation the two before is the blocks yeah and the rafters um we were talking one time about changing the roof of this and and it it sound as it is but like Brother Gary said we keep we add more thank God for somebody like really gay see somebody with some understanding because I'm like build it what's wrong two by fours two percents you got a nail gun I'll buy you some nails brother gas here bro waiting until then walks can't handle that pressure he said I'd have to put like pylons or something down the down the side of this building he said oh the walls would bow because of the most more pressure that we put on the ceiling well see it took somebody like him to stop some dummy like me or we'd all be flat as a pancake because I believe if I pushed him he might have built him but he'd be going um but you know what that's the Holy Ghost now you I believe he's got the Holy Ghost but that was just knowledge of what he was doing was telling me without that knowledge yeah they'd look really pretty to have a great big tall roof but the walls can't handle it thank God for a master builder that we go oh I want to do this Lord I want to do this I want to go get this job I want to do this I want to do that thank God for master builder says no you can't do that and I'm going to tell you why I'm gonna give you the code book and I'm okay you go back to this code book that code book will tell you how to build your house it'll tell you how to be a Powerhouse of God he's got to know your code and you know what code is code is a revelation you got to get the Revelation all right let's do this real quick and we'll wait until this afternoon the spirit of wisdom and understanding brother Brown said the spirit of wisdom will come back into the church Spirit of wisdom not just the spirit a spirit of wisdom will come into the church that we can say Amen to what amen and kick out what's not right the spirit of wisdom and understand the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge of the fear of the Lord Ephesians 1 verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom in Revelation in the knowledge of him look that the eyes of your understanding to be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the rich of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints real quick right here musicians come on in Revelation of Jesus Christ brother I was talking about the Book of Revelations the consummation of the scripture place right where it needs to be where at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it's a revelation of God to give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God no prevailing power nothing can overpower the word of God let's continue right here just for say everybody stand I admit it takes a real Revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the godhead these days when we're in the midst of perversion or perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God I've become expected we expect God to reveal his truth to us I expect that out of him because he's a good god he's a good father I just got to make myself available and quit being a renegade however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism wow it is right there staring you in the face wow one more the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding here have all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever the fear of the Lord is beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding trust in the Lord with all your heart and love lean not on to your own understanding we listen we lean we lean to the human part all the time we know that we need to lean back the other direction because we know through wisdom is a house building just like I said about Brother Gary and by understanding look by understanding it's established brother Garrett has never built a house that he just built and it's just sitting there right somebody occupies that place it's an established home we've seen many times when we were doing uh foreclosed homes and stuff you leave a house you take even a perfectly good house and you leave it empty uh everybody's shaking their head already you leave it empty for six months three months six months you leave it for a year get what you go by and drive by it starts doing this well it's family that house has life well praise God how about this house if you don't come to church if you don't read your Bible if you don't study guess what you start blowing out too your roof starts falling in your foundation's cracked let's get the master builder back and let him put this thing back together again God bless you let's sing a song oh you are awesome in this place [Music] and you are awesome
