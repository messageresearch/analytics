good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 14 Matthew 14 we're glad to have our visitors back there among us and we say welcome to you and I couldn't pronounce his name so I told him i' call him brother Abraham and sister Abraham I don't think her name is Sarah I think it's Jo joet but uh we we'll just call her sister Abraham cu it'll be it'll be good enough but glad to have them we always say when you come one time here a visitor you come two times you're just a part of us so we don't have anything to join up with and all but just remember that so we welcome you uh remember also now this coming Saturday will be Bible study 6:00 and pray the Lord would bless each one and Wade will be preaching the Lord willing Wednesday so we're getting everything out of the way getting the schedule mayate all right any other announcements so remember now to the brothers about the uh on the fishing trip on Father's Day weekend now make sure you read the the listings downstairs cuz it tells you what to do and it tells you what to bring so you know then you don't have no excuse to come up and say well I didn't bring no drinks everybody all the men are you responsible for your children to bring them drinks we Supply food and all kind of things but have tea and water we have tea and water but uh make sure you bring drinks for your kids because that way you don't want the kids going around and not being able to drink a drink cuz you didn't bring them and then some other kids has got drinks that they brought them so you know get everything straight and have it all do and we always have a wonderful time uh fishing and fellowshipping together it always turns out real good so we just pray that the Lord would bless okay Matthew 14 we'll begin with verse 22 father we thank you for all of the day and the time that we've had thank you for the word that you have given unto us we ask you now that you would just bless each and every one of us with your understanding and your grace and your love and father that we may be able to follow you in the opening of your word because that's a our desire more than anything is to walk in the light then that way we can have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ will atone for all of our sins we ask you now to just help us give us understanding ears and just bless each one Lord we commit it all to you now forgive our sins bless those that are not here and remember them and Lord remember the sick among us we pray that you would touch each one CU you made the promise you said you sent your word we believe you've done that so now come on the scene to touch and heal each and every one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen Matthew 14 we'll go with verse 22 everybody knows this scripture real well and uh we'll get to our point in a little while of what we're talking about verse 22 says and Je and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away and when he had sent the multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea talks with waves for the wind was contrary but in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus came unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come now I don't need you try to preach and you get caught with it uh remember we were talking about the coming of the Lord and it wouldn't do no good for for you to say come to somebody you know that wasn't standing there personal you know I tried to get the word come over to you to where you could see it all right and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and he began to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore this thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we'll get to our point in a minute but this is a a good favorite scripture of everybody you know Jesus walking on the water and ever a little Baptist preacher that ever started out preaching probably his first sermon was Jesus walking on the water you you know and you've probably heard that 49,000 times in your life of ministers using Jesus walking on the water and that's good not throwing off on it just making the point but we'll get down to what we want to talk about for a little bit but I want to review a little bit Wednesday night to make sure that you follow me and know what I'm trying to say and all cuz in that message we were covering on as I said the word come doesn't mean a traveling form as we talk about it literally means to be here it's not something over there when I say to you I say you know uh brother Danny uh come to see me I have that doesn't mean anything to do with the travel he's the one that's doing it so it's his presence I'm talking about not just a perusia parcia meaning as some of them had because that means someone standing beside of you I don't want God standing beside of me kill me he would have to I want him living inside of me and then that way I don't have to worry about it and see I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ to the bride started on the day of Pentecost in the new birth and when that new birth comes to each individual God is coming to you amen all right then he finishes his coming in the end time to take us away all right now but what I tried to get a point across was of how wonderful I thought and then you'll see why that we're going to start on a probably no telling how long series I thought I was going to preach one sermon and uh already got four so I ain't worried about it but we're going to be talking for a while about something that I believe is what we need and I believe we need a positive attitude now uh it's not a mental concept you'll see what I'm talking about it is a positive attitude because anybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything or anything happened they had to have a positive attitude something there so that's you know that will be our thought and speaking and talking about mental Faith leads to spiritual Revelation but we'll call it positive attitude and keep on to that point it's something I've been thinking on for 45 years and that's reason I'm pretty good on the point of positive if you think of something that long you can figure you you've thought it out pretty good and know because I believe that we should the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for then she will be an invincible Army you know Satan will not be able to conquer her because but she must believe it right amen that's right a statement is wonderful amen but somebody is going to believe it and it will manifest all right now we talked about the great position that this end time people must attain I remember uh son-in-law Richard talking about when he was reading the statue of a perfect man he had read the book and all and probably heard the tape but one day I emphasized a point out of there that brandom says You must have these virtues so it doesn't mean it's just half Hazard it's required all right this age it's required okay now we know what's required well why not try to attain to what's required so you don't get out of G's alac you know it's got to come out of the word of God Amen it have to be the word of God revealed to us amen if it's something greater than all that's been down through time then it would have to be something that would be specifically for this time all right we talked about how that the prophet of God brought the message unto us and we use that as an understanding to speak from not that we believe that brother brandham was God no but we believe the message come forth the proph Propet had problems in dates and times and seasons and and statements and and 700 instead of 7,000 and all cuz he was a human being he said one time the black and white will die will fight again and die like flies well you could go around with it thus sayith the Lord go to the next message he said I made that statement under my own understanding see it was not of thus sayth the Lord but everybody wants to make everything brother Brown says it thus sayith the Lord you know and then we wind up he like I said we wind up saying well the Lord can't come now because they ain't no woman in the White House and ain't no pop come out of the United States yet well like I told you Wednesday if you took off the president the vice president and a couple of people and blowed them all out in one time you could have a woman as a president in two minutes right cuz that's about how long it takes them to when it's finished they just take her and she puts her hand on the Bible she's the president that's how quick it could happen Pope out of the United States one of them lik did 30 days you remember that one Pope lasted 30 days maybe something like that it might have been 90 days but I know it was a very short time and see that could happen in a hurry but my point is we're looking for something like that and those little things uh um you know instead of looking at the message the prophet brought unto us all right now all of those things will take place because of the message that we believe amen that's it all right time would last long enough they would definitely be a president would be a woman president they got one now this you know Hillary's coming up you know all of that and that's none of my business cuz I don't even vote anyway but you know time Li there'll be a poke coming out of the United States right but is that what we're waiting on or is that what we're going to do is just sit down and wait on the bus to pull up and then we crawl on the bus because here it is you know no I believe we need to get into the word that the prophet has brought unto us and by that realizing who we are right and see by doing that then we can see who we are and recognize who we are and what's taking place among us all right then I gave you a lot of quotes and I have these here to anyone that wasn't here Wednesday we have about 10 if you want a copy of these things that uh hold up your hand if you wouldn't here Wednesday to get a copy of them to where that the prophet would be explaining things to us and saying these things things that I will just paraphrase and quite you know just take a part out of the prophet of God said the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily but see we don't believe that but does that change what he said does that mean it's not right well now you just misread well uh I've done the best I could and even giving you the quotes to let you read it brother brandham said on the Good Shepherd of the sheep 1957 that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was God was in Christ and all that Christ is poured out on the church but you keep refusing it amen now that's the way he said it you keep refusing it right but yet how many quotes is there that all God was he put into Christ and all Christ poured into the church all right but he says on the message Be not Afraid e79 now these are on the internet to the people and anybody else out there that needs them call us we'll be glad to send them to you he says do you believe that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all Jesus was he poured into the church he's the fullness of the god head bodily and all Jesus was he poured into the church the Holy Ghost is that so it's God in us God in you it doesn't make you anything it's not the Holy Mountain or the holy church it's the Holy Ghost amen all right now on the message Christ is the mystery of God reveal paragraph 160 God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwell was in his church the preeminent preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church but brother Dale I just don't believe it because I don't see it you never will because with that statement you'll never see it forget it on that same message paragraph 380 and there would come a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church having the pinenes in the church the Mighty God unveiled paragraph 130 131 God in man God in Christ God in man fullness of godhead bodily in of man God in man now it's God in men the fullness of God and the godhead bodily in his entire church manifest in himself fulfilling his word all right then what was it then we went in to where that I started in 1969 in Athens Georgia speaking on this that the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time would be the son of man brother brandom was not the son of man he was a son of man he said can't you get that straight he said it's not the he's the messenger he's not the God but yet all the bride together which would include brother brandom in the body of Christ would make it to fullness of the godhead bodily could be and in doing that it would be these on man God's only provided place of worship 65128 paragraph 264 no leav among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's day couldn't do it in Wesley couldn't do it in Pentecostal but in the day when the son of man will be manifested reveal brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people the prophet said he would become visible Among Us what is what the Holy Ghost given for become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go in Rapture but he doesn't come visible as a physical he doesn't become literal physical compound or whatever you want to call it 16 elements until we meet him in the air and then we'll go to the uh Millennium and then he'll be their physical all right just giving you these then we get on to our point he said on the message the Mighty God unveiled before us paragraph 147 and it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man did veiled in human flesh and remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God has been revealed in Luke 17th chapter I believe it is about the 20th 21st verse somewhere along there he said and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in in in the church again revealed in human beings right amen not Son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that in God's promises all right how is the son of man the word made flesh all right restoration of the Bride tree preached in 62 paragraph uh 541 promis to do in the evening time you promised to do and so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be God living in human flesh moving Among Us in the form of his church amen the form of his church okay but see everybody say said oh yeah we believe it brother R well amen we we believe that right God was made manifest in a human flesh right we believe that but he could not be the fullness of the godhead bodily but the bride around the world not just Lula Georgia I've never taught nothing like that but around the world something's got to happen to take us out of here right whatever you believe about it's got to be related to the bride sure as we would see Jesus 1964 paragraph 161 and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known God down in his church down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man be revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom message called a trial much more could we say as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people not Son of God not son of David but son of man amen the supernatural goes on down in that same message he says as the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of God coming now watch him when the son of man shall be revealed now you know he knows the scriptures in what he's bringing all right the son of man being revealed not the Son of God in the church he's put out of that now he's son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh Among Us the Harvest Time when the son of man this is paragraph 354 is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people the word itself made flesh in you you are refle a reflection of this hour the message reflecting it so I just want to make sure that you seen what I was talking about to some of you that wasn't here Wednesday and then you hear me make a comment I made these comments 40 something years ago and I surely believe it more today than I did then and I believe that God is waiting on you and I so the prophet says adoption time when God can pour in his fullness that's it and can raise the dead and we'll go into Rapture what the Holy Ghost given for all right waiting on you and I amen right amen well now in that when are we going to have and I want to get started now on the message I'm just doing that part to lay it over to where that people would hear what I said and they would not maybe get the quotes I think I read what the prophet said I believe I've tried to but see why can't we have a positive attitude then amen why are we so down at the mouth as brother forny likes to say wowy wowy woo you you just don't understand brother Dale my case oh my Lord you know you just don't understand my problems well what do you want the whole world to have your problems you know that's why most most crimes are solved is because people can't keep their mouth shut about the crime they done and they'll go out and tell somebody about it and then they go tell somebody else here while back we were loading a a refrigerator for brother Hank and I told him I said hey it's on my leg and uh they didn't know what had done my leg swell I didn't even tell me why my leg swell it's big I didn't even tell my wife my ankle turned black my toes turned black I didn't tell her why cuz she'd have been worried about it I knew it wouldn't broke it was just bruised right but you see we got to have somebody on our side down out I'm going to get into this I'm going to get into something and this message is going to run some of you off or do something because I'm going to be plain which I gener am and maybe blunt which I gen am but see I think it's time for us to have a positive attitude why not what age answer me please what age of time would you think of living in that the people of the message of that day you know and time should be any more positive than you and I am now you know I'm going to quote the prophet behind that don't you goz what did he say he said if there were in any age in time that he was asked to where that he would been able to live before the world ever begun he said it would be this day amen why would have been great to walk with the Lord Jesus but remember Peter was walking with him and lost his substance right it would have been great to been down through there on the day of Pentecost and all of those things and wonderful right but give me the day we're living no matter what we've got to endure no matter what we've got to put up with and the end time I want to be here because this is where it's all going to be finished this is where the scripture will be fulfilled that the end of all things has come upon us and I'm Heaven help you to think that I'm trying to if you get it in your mind I'll just take it out before we start to think that brother Dale is going to try to preach us and pump us up I wish I could I I wish I could do that and wish I had a peel that I could pass out you know to everybody and wish I had something that would make us all feel good and then we'd finally decide hey maybe we are Christians come we feel good but now how are you going to do that when the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord lead us out of them all am yeah but we just don't see the signs and wonders why don't you go out there then I don't mind talking like that you go out amongst organized religion and you find per Church per case more signs and wonders you'll find then you will find in message churches right what are we going to do let's quit and go over there you see where are we at folks you know the disciples came to a place one time and Jesus said why don't you go to can remember the 70 had left him and in plain language brother R said he just said why don't you go too you know this is this is not a py pad or petting party you know I know how to get people I know how to get in your bfold I know how to get in your car I know how to get what you got but the day I use my gift to do those things it'll be the last day I live why because that's not to be done that's right we've had a message we've had a prophet thank God yes sir am but like I told you over and over Martin Luther it was not him protesting the Catholic church that they got worried about they just laughed him off when he began to do those things when he nailed his thesis on the door they SED at him another fanatic it'll fade away yes but when the people begin to even though they even burn the buildings down cuz they thought that's what Luther was telling them read your history he said hold it I didn't tell you that see they thought he meant get out of the church just burn it down but it's when the people become one with what Luther had said the Catholic Church got concerned amen the devil's not going to get concerned until you and I begin to say what amen was it what the prophet may I quote him he said when you can say I and my father are one and these other things he said the shock could pull away well if we're all so lydy sweet and honey Parts you know that we just all of us are going brother Dale don't be down and out about all I ain't down and out i' I've been this way for 40 something years I've been up ever since I come in this message I don't know about you you don't find me with a down day do you every how you say them words I'm sorry you call me up I'm sick as a buzzard and what did I say how you doing wonderful right amen and it's not that I don't believe that you can't confess what you're got but see that's what we dwell on we were listening to a tape the other day and you'll see where I'm heading listening to a tape the other day day you know what brother R said he said we have too much information yes and I listen a minute think what he was saying CU I know what I've been thinking and he said we have too much information and I knew he was not saying we have too much word too much understanding of the Bible he was not talking to that it was the natural world you know the natural world was too much information and you know what you say here and I know you and some of you when I say this you're going to get upset go ahead but smile at me you can walk in here today and you can say I went to the doctor and I had a complete physical and they gave me a clean bill of health some of you will say yep and I read about three guys the other day that had a clean bell of help they died in three days that's unbelief that's unbelief at least let me know hinder you but but I'm just saying like the doctor say it yeah back years ago when they had the the dip theor is or went they had those diseases you know what was the problem a lot of the people that were so energetic and so wonderfully helping the people were the carriers of the disease because they wouldn't take the disease and they were carriers but they were passing it on and what are you going to say to them you know what they done with them they took them and locked them up because they were killing people but I was all the rest of the lazy Bunch sitting around wasn't doing nothing that person looked real good didn't they but they were killing people see our unbelief is what's killing us our unbelief is what's killing us it's destroying us we've got so much information show me where Peter would talk like that I thought we were supposed to have a positive attitude well I'm just being honest you an honest carrier of unbelief you say what I you suggest I do I suggest we shut our mouths when somebody tells us something we should be positive they say I'm sick we should be positive great the doctors can help you go to them we've never never been against doctors right blood of random sent people to H have operations right brother random was going to the doctor every day out in the 62 I believe it is series on Jehovah Gyra in California I believe that's right now but he was going to the doctor every day himself and out there praying for the sick the sick being healed and the dead being raised am but brother Dale I don't want to lie why you're a liar anyway yeah if you don't say by his stripes I'm Healed you are lying that's a lie because the Bible says you are does that do away with going to the doctor you know how it is you know what I've always said did my wife even get on to me I go down to the doctor's office and I'm sick as a buzzard and the doctor said how you doing I said I'm doing what great she said well they can't treat you if you're doing great okay I go in now they said what are you doing I said I'm wonderful I feel good but can you help his lag as sure is hurting me you know amen hey come on they tell me I got leukemia I go to a cancer specialist every 6 months he comes in he said how you doing I wonderful he said I love to come in here when you here I have me a good time with him you know they hunt for them glands see if it swelled up I know what he was doing I know what they t on you to see how you how you your insides are doing and everything he was just a pumping around on me like that looking at me GRE me him talk I said hey are you trying to find something are you just trying to make me think you know what you're doing he looked at me forget it well why not why can't we be he's a he's a human just like I am but church we got to have a positive attitude and a positive attitude is not I will not confess I'm sick now that's what people think's a positive attitude don't say you're sick cuz you will be sick don't say you got that or you'll have it you already got it say by strip I'm Healed I don't go around telling the world hey I got leukemia y'all pray for me I said they say I've got leukemia cuz they really can't prove it because it's supposed to be that white blood count it's supposed to be going up up up up and that doctor Le at Sam he said it's down about five points what it was the last time lord and he says it ain't something I'm giving you see make a confession be positive about it amen come on we're going to relate it this way when we get to it you believe in one true and living God right but I know where brother Brandon said let stand and address the third person of the trinity maybe he was a trinitarian and he finally told it you see what your information does for you when I look at those things I look at it in my life cuz he's a human being you know what according to the world Jesus is the third person of the Trinity so he's just saying what they're saying he's never taught nothing like that even when he was a Baptist he never taught nothing like that that's what he said come on but you see church we take the point that we think we have faith we think we have faith but as I saying could somebody come along and talk you out of the the the real true understanding of one true and living God now I'm going to make a bold statement if it's not a revelation they can right that's right you can quote brother random every day of your life and still not have a revelation amen amen oh brother Dale brother vam had the Revelation well great he had it but that don't mean you and I got it the Bible already said the things the prophet brought to us but we through our unbelief caught it incorrect that's right positive attitude positive about where we're at right we we we'll get to see job says I know and that's a man without the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right the Holy Ghost has not been given cuz Jesus has not been glorified is that scripture John 11 or 17 or 7 or something I'll get to it the me I got it written in here but anybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything had to have a positive attitude so that's my whole background to to study from see a positive attitude and see not to be negative no I mean wouldn't it be something for Anna to go to the kids at school and I kids want to teach you how to count but you never will get to be good at it well I ain't going to start counting right brother Gary his dad great doctor great friend of mine he said the first day they went to medical school said they told him said if you won't hinder your patience what was the percentage 50 or 80% or something like that of your people will get well if you don't hinder them that's that's pretty good ain't it you go into the doctor and the doctor you tell the doctor I'm hurting yep I had three guys this week hurting that when they all died so that means you going to die I said give me a money back at least I'll go enjoy it you if I'm going to die no that doctor told me he'd take my kneecap off it wasn't me speaking from here or nowhere but something inside of here says you will never take it off and I laughed at him I said forget it doctor you won't take my kneecap off he laughed and he said you will he said I can prove to you it's wor out I said so no problem I'm assume he's probably dead now because he's pretty good age but you see that's the point and I'm not going to be talking about a positive attitude other than one thing we will deal with that if you don't have a positive attitude there's no way for you to have a revelation so you see where that I'm basing it we are the ones that keeps the Revelation from coming you cannot be I will prove it by the prophet you cannot be healed you cannot be saved by mental Faith that's right but if you don't have mental Faith you can't be saved now you say well that's double talk no it's not it's truth right it's truth but see there's a difference between mental faith and a supernatural Revelation amen but you know what Brother Gary and I talking about this the other day going down to see Sister Mary if you've never experienced a real true Revelation you don't know what I'm talking about and yet you would stand in my face and deny it to the tee and say brother Dale I have faith if you've never been supernaturally even like just something like I said something come and it just tell you right there that's it and then you see it totally made manifest but don't make no difference when it comes you don't know what a supernatural Revelation is that's right if you've never experienced a new birth you can't tell nobody what it is amen I tell my own illustration that when I came into the message that I saw immediately I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet was talking about the new birth I was a good old Baptist so I was talking to this Baptist preacher about the message and one day I told him he said well what's your confessions of things I said well I'm confessing one thing for certain I don't believe that I'm born again you know what he said to me most of you know right you know what he said he said well that why are you trying to teach me cuz I believe I've got it and you say and you don't have it then you can't teach me because you don't have it I said you got a point yes that's right but I said one day I'll have it and I'll come back and talk to you amen that's right cuz he was telling me the truth so one day I came to him I said I talk to you now he said oh you've had an experience I said yeah now we can talk did you see most people people think well I you come into the message that preacher told me one day well you you believe the message don't you and yet you say you're not born again I said well you can believe every scripture in the Bible to not be born again that's right you can be able to quote every scripture in the Bible and not be born again if you've never had a holy ghost Born Again experience you don't know what anybody's talking about that's told you they had one right that's right yeah but I've done this I've done that I've done this done and Satan can impersonate every one of them now what you going to do right I've seen Angels I've seen this I did too 11 years old so God standing in the church never counted at a new birth and even speak to me personal things down through my life they never counted after I saw brother brandom and so what are he talking about right that the new birth is a person well now listen now let me show you illustrate something the minute I said just then that the new birth is a person how many of you had in your mind well brother Dale explain what a person is are you talking about a real person are you talk and not you don't know what I'm talking about if you'd had the experience of the new birth you'd know what I'm talking about I wouldn't have to explain that I'm not talking about a physical God coming down and physically coming into me but I'm talking about justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the people of this message has forgotten about right how many of them teach on it anymore oh you just believe the prophet will the devil beat you he believed in first right but you see Church what I'm trying to get to is a positive attitude and how to to look at it that there's a difference between a mental faith and a spiritual Revelation amen right but yet I read it I don't mean I done it every day now I didn't say that I ain't never said it but I have read six books brother brandham in one day and listen to two tapes that's a pretty good foundation to talk from but all that time I knew I wasn't born again that's a pretty good uh confession but remember it's not whether you accept him amen am I the message now the prophet said it's not whether you accept him or not he say where he said accept you right how come so many had followed the message for so long in the days that even on the takes you hear them say God's Prophet for this hour and yet where are there today right and them kind is not the ones that says he's wrong them the kind that just fell away years ago brother Charlie Cox told us about a certain brother BR that brother Brandon speaks of almost will never take he said in 6 months after brother brownon was gone they went back in the denominational church now that's his words my wife heard it so let forget it on tap he comes by denies it I'll say I still believe it that he said it but you see Church what is our confession that's why I said Wednesday night hard and strong how can you deny the word if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you tell me anywhere you can right you mean the Holy Ghost in you will deny the word well you know I don't worry about running people off cuz if people leave they don't have the Holy Ghost Brother D amen right you shouldn't say it like that hey I'm the pastor I can't well I was just planning on leaving brother Dale but now you made me embarrassed embarrassed about what I'm just talking plain language to me but what about it now we read in the scripture as I said many people preached on Peter and his experience and we just just read in the scripture that a man one day looked out on the water thought it was a spook spoke to The Spook now I'm just putting our terminologies right thought it was an angel or something finally he said he got to recognizing him he said Lord if that be thee bid me come bid me to come out there where you at he said we just come well you know what I don't know how many was in the boat but nobody else jumped up and took off right so evidently nobody else in the boat had the Revelation who that was standing out there at least to what they were thinking why didn't everybody jump up and take off right no Peter just gets down and starts walking he had a substance under his feet right cuz you can't walk on water I don't care how big feet big your feet are you walk on snow with snow shoes but you can't walk on water you know all right but he looks around at circumstances and he begins to sink now I had this point to bring out but I'm going to just say it and forget it there's no mentioning there that he had to fall back in the water and start swimming I'm not even marking with you about that cuz that's what people want to do they want to find out if Peter fell back in the water and started trying to swim the Bible just said he was sinking well if he was sinking slowly then something was holding him up right God he should immediately have went back maybe he never lost everything at one time you know he just started sinking but now look what your Prophet had to say everybody knows this everybody knows the quotes but when are we going to get down to really listening and thinking about it the message perfect Faith go ahead and pull up number one brother and the prophet of God is illustrating this and he comes through Peter was doing all right and he was got scared and then he so little note where we can read Jesus said come he stepped down and said it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he got a eye his eyes on the waves he got scared what come in his mind first thing he I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk that's the first thing and he started walking right and the next thing he he looked at his well he looked at his symptoms he looked out there and seen how big them waves was and he got scared and when he did down he went see what he feared happened what he believed that's happened when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed well he what when he believed got scared in his belief then his substance left him watch you see he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance y are you read he thought he did he thought he did he did it first he was willing to Adventure right out like I said none of the others got it wi why the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just steps right down out of the boat and he takes off he never thought about the the waves how contrary they was he never got that in his mind so he didn't lose his confession he lost his substance now that's Hebrews 111 isn't it yes where faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of things not seen right we'll get to those later but remember Peter walked on the water as I said none of the rest tried it so evidently they was a little unbelief in them where they were just got down and went you said oh no he just called Peter well no the rest of them didn't say now fact that that be thee either you know you understand yes and then we want to make a lot of light but you know what Peter walked on the water you want to make a lot of light out of him how he slipped and fell and he done this and that uh how many of you ever walked on water no we're like the father Divine orever which one it was done at that time but I've told you many times he went down to the ocean he said this day I'm going to walk on the water and they rolled out this big carpet right down to the water and he goes strolling down through there and he gets right at the water and he stops he turns around and he comes back he said there's one unbeliever in the crowd I can't do it well you know which one I think was the unbeliever what about you I'm not making Lie To The Man I'm just telling you where we stand where we're at talking about us not him amen Peter was doing something that none of us had ever tried to do he took God as his word that's what we just read right said the word says it all right now if he had a substance and was able to walk on it and the prophet says he lost his substance but not his confession what did he have he had a mental faith right Peter had a mental Faith he had a substance faith when he could walk he lost the substance where's he at now come on don't throw him off and make him an unbeliever and die and going to hell because he done this that and the other I've heard it preached about him you know now he still had that is confession profession now what's the prophet mean by that simply what Peter said right what did Peter say Lord help me still confessing him to be almighty God still knowing that he was standing out there that's right and knowing that there was only one hope for him to get back there he had a pretty good confession so he said Lord help me well you know it's not written in there how Jesus had to struggle to grab him and hold him and pull him up or whatever to do I like what one brother used to Illustrated he said when it says there the word com said really what Peter was saying he was saying now Jesus you put under my feet what's under your feet and I'll walk out there that's a good point cuz that's what he done but what we fail to see is that Jesus just took his hand and put the substance right back under his feet or what do you think he done went out and grabbed him and struggled and picked him up and carried him back to the boat that's the way they'd make a movie out of it but he still had a good confession his confession was Lord there's no hopes outside of you you know the disciples finally one day come to the point till Jesus even said about him said do you now finally believe do you now finally believe but what about it we want to throw off on him and how his doubts and his frustrations and his thing but Jesus just took him by the hand and let him back into the boat he said oh you of little faith but get my point before we continue any further he never lost his confession or Prof he was standing there looking and saying God help me right put back under my feet sir the thing that I can't do bring it back to Meen amen he put it back under his feet and he walked back in the boat with him that was God doing it right amen just remember one thing it's not me and you all I read about the bride being the fullness of the godhead body the son of man the the visible among that has nothing to do with you and I other than we are the what do you call it we are the reciprocans we are the people that these things take place in we are the Peters that have lost our substance when brother randam said it this is the way I believe it I believe him to be just like all the other prophets that when they said it it was not them saying it it was God saying it that's right so when brother Brandon was speaking of how great the bride would be he's not just trying to build you up and make you feel good until a big brother I told you he said the message that the third pool is only for the Lord Jesus and brother random and brother random said the third pool is for the bride and the church and to the totally lost well I don't understand that does that make it unbelief no it's unbelief in you and I right when we say anything contrary to God's word amen by his stripes I'm Healed that's what he said for me to say anything else I'm a liar Amen brother want L about it cuz I got just bad feeling you'll keep that bad feeling too amen I got a little gland back here on each side one of them's been my buddy for 50 years I guess they didn't even choose to take it off when they took the one off my neck talking about me having leukemia I call him a buddy cuz he's back there but every time I put my hand down like that and I do it constantly and I feel a little bitty fell over here and a big fell over here and I say by his stripes I am heal Hallelujah when you going to start doing that huh I'm H so bad by his stripes I am healed confess your way into it you know it might change from mental faith and become spiritual Revelation that's what I'm trying to get you to see amen sir yes amen what Peter had under his feet one minute he lost that that substance of his own self right but the god of Glory put it back under his feet and he walked into the boat that's right amen amen if not you're going to have to say he drugged him or toed him or done something and you're never going to be able to understand how the mental faith can become a spiritual Revelation you don't start with a spiritual Revelation oh God just pour that now I didn't hear nobody you liar you read the Bible you heard somebody say it mama said it I don't care who said you need to be saved amen I didn't hear nobody say I needed to be saved I just got saved one day may I stay in the scripture there's nobody in the Bible ever got the Holy Ghost I challenge you to come and show me nobody in the Bible ever got the Holy Ghost that didn't hear the word first come on CU I still believe Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord amen amen but do you see what I'm talking about he didn't have his substance left but God took what he had and walked him back to the boat Lord put under our feet what's in our head that's right do you understand put it in my heart and it's going under my feet mental Faith then can become a spiritual revelation so meal mental Faith now is a very wonderful thing now mental faith is not a substance is that that's where we get tied up at we see it happen for somebody else we see it work in their lives yes and brother R said it ought to put us in desperation right to see somebody else get healed ought to put us in desperation now there's a little sister sitting back here it's in close to 90 she's done a little over 80 anyway you know physically they tell her she was in perfect health you know what she eats right right she does right oh that's good but you know all of us can't be that because our bodies are made different we're you know but we know for certainty that we're deteriorating fast right the kids can't do like we do my kids can't even still work with me yet and I'm 704 years old they get tired and want to quit everybody thinks Hank can work he got down the house the other day we worked and he he had to go sit down all right see everybody a made that way the deterioration in the body you say what are you getting at I'm getting at one point I think we should do what we you know I don't eat I I eat pork and I don't misunder understand but I won't eat it for a long time because I got enough sense to know that pork cures problems with blood pressure yes but brother Dale if it's Sanctified by the word of God In Prayer now you can do all that you want to it just don't encourage me none if it really is there is no problem but common sense says don't eat too much pork well I know people that ate pork and died at 95 y but not today sure it did we used to have old lard bucket lard that was rendered out over a fire and we made biscuits and cornbread and stuff out of it but we worked it out of the body we didn't sit down lazily and play on computers and I can't understand how did I keep gaining weight I used to be able to lose weight now you used to work come on right just talking about mental Faith but you see we think mental Faith a lot of times is a spiritual revelation right like brother Al said one time he said why don't you go upart brother Dale let him talk you out of what you think is Faith remember him making that statement many years ago let him go talk you out of it I can talk you out of it it's not Faith amen if you go into that doctor convinces you that doctor is right now physically he's right statement he's right but if he convinces you you're dying you know what go buy you great plot yeah and I've never been one to be that way I know a brother years ago he said I ain't buying no great plot go me want to die well you know what somebody had to buy one when he died what's any problem with come on but see you just think well no no I'm saying it this way same brother I ain't going to pay no taxes I ain't going to pay none of them social security stuff about two years before he got old enough to draw he started paying what are you calling that progressive revelation or what you know I get tickled it families when they say we don't believe in birth control they have about six kids and all at months they don't have no more right now something went wrong somewhere you see what I'm talking about we'll read it this afternoon with a Prophet said the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith that's it but now don't let me hinder your mental faith I wouldn't dare go over here to this church right here beside of us and tell them they're all lost well run I tell you that's the way I believe they believe I believe you're lost I'm going tell you all I'm lost God told me to tell them that you show me brother random one time in any church that ever told them people in that church is lost come on that's reason I don't play games I want to know where he said it now he might tell an individual he might tells him listening to him the other day when he was talking about you know how the discernment would come you know that brother around him in his early Ministry was like Jack Cole he used to call him out but you know what he said one day he said God told me not to do that he said I had a wonderful preacher that had a big church that I called out something in his life and said it red a man he said I won't do it again which you see we think we're L of the Lord I've had people to tell me mean so I'm not going to take this medication no more I confess with you but the same time one certain brother I went over to another brother I said keep your eyes on him cuz he ain't going to take that medicine anymore you said that's unbelief no that was straight truth cuz your body chemically is going to react he came back and he said Brother D I messed up I should you're right don't do it again till the doctor tells you right that's why I tell you go to the doctor but when the doctor tells you you don't need that you quit it but I ain't no faith I get sick of people and their faith when you know for short they don't have it see some of you think that if I pray for it immediately healed I had Faith we're going to get in brother random where you can make go for a long long time before it is made manifest and then you're going to get upset when I read brother brandom where he said he loves to test you God loves to test you how can he test you if you ain't sick my Lord but then we go as I said you know my Point's always being you go to the doctor doctor says you got cancer I don't have cancer blessed God I'm Healed you go about 6 or 8 months you start getting worse and you can see the person just H their faith is dwindling and then after a while they'll say maybe the Lord let me have cancer where they can use my case to find a cure for cancer oh boy you got a supernatural good Revelation ain't you oh you're really oh you're really so wonderful you're like the lady I was talking about or the thing where they was in there taking care of everybody but they were the one giving them diseases but you see church we talk about faith faith is a substance right it's not just I think if you've never had it you don't know what I'm talking about if you've never been healed by the word of God that you know you was healed when you took it you don't know what I'm talking about don't let me hinder your mental Faith go confess it sir walked into the doctor's office come right here my blood pressure was running 160 70 over 100 110 J Motors kept up with it every day just about I'd go in there run it and it was still there I went to the doctor we came here to the church and and we prayed and I said God take that away you know what I how that I believe went to the doctor's office and run it up it 120 over 80 I said nurse would you believe that my blood pressure here's the paperwork to prove what it's been you believe God healed me she said no I walked in the doctor's office and he went through all of his routine said Sam your blood pressure is wonderful I said would you believe this report here they said my blood pressure has been running real high and God heal me he says no I got up and walked out of that there I said if you want me I told my wife you want me to go to the doctor you going to get me a Believer cuz I ain't going to him that's right amen walked in there one day when my eyesight was so till I just I just seeing waves like that I walked in there got glasses wor them for a long time walked in there again and it got getting worse than what it was even with the glasses I supposed to have been wearing and I walk in the doctor run his test and he looked at me and he said what are you doing with glces I said I've been wearing them for eight years why he said you don't need them I said what do you mean he said you got 120 I mean what do you call it 100 over 2020 okay I walked outside you know I went in there doing this way I walked outside and I looked it's kind of like what Richard said Richard the son-in-law he was in school and they got him for copying the papers of the people around him you know why cuz he couldn't read the board he couldn't see the board so he's coping well they took him in the office why are you copying I can't see the board they got him to go get GES he didn't know trees had leaves he just saw a glob he didn't know trees had leaves separate things on that's what I mean if God ever speaks to you you won't worry about nothing come on Brothers you won't worry about a thing you'll simply settle down and say my St I'm Healed don't ride on my Tombstone that I died of this that or the other that's right it's Faith but don't lose your mental faith yeah just because this message is not brother Brand's all the whole message is not I don't claim it's been revealed to me I don't claim this Bible that's been revealed to me but just because it's not revealed I'm not going to say it's not there I'm going to ask God to reveal it I've prayed about things for 20 years before I would ever preach one sermon on what I was talking about 20 years I studied that before I would ever preach it but then when I preach it I preach it as it and I said the other day this is that if this ain't that let me keep this till that gets here but let me keep quoting brother rown said this is that amen see I believe it what about you let stand what we got 372 mental faith can lead to a spiritual Revelation there's got to be a way of getting there positive attitude let me say what he said calary about it for good enough for me praise God my sins are gone the old where God came in my heart and my are the Lord took your possession the devil did depart I'm glad my sins are gone there underneath the blood on the cross of calary as far removed as darkness is from in the SE of God forness that's good enough for me praise God my are gone when Satan comes to temp me and tries to make

darkness is from amen praise God Amen you know if you're not positive how could you say your sins are gone that's what we're going to get to f folks to just say something with our mouths is good because we need to keep saying it but it's got to come down to where there's something inside of us speaks back when he speaks back then it'll be settled you can't be saved by mental Faith you can't be healed by mental Faith but yet you don't want to stop believing that's right I just want to pray till it comes right well you don't have much Faith cuz you lay your hand back there and say am I not in the scripture that I'm supposed to confess yeah but you really well I admit I don't have it or it wouldn't be there but I'm going to confess my way into it and all the time I'm going to take his word and then one day that'll be gone and then what are you going to do well I was just a mental mental Faith won't heal you but some of you may not be back to seing it but just remember how close mental faith can be do you know that mental faith can be so close that a human being can focus on a glass and believe in that glass will break that's not Hocus Pocus that's right pretty good mental faith is it amen what about the prophet where the little girl he told her he said can you make that bracelet swing around and around in the room and stop he said I wanted to let you know you don't have faith she said that's you know that's wrong he said I knew you'd say that cuz you don't have faith but he said fastening My Eyes Upon that bracelet he said it begin to move but he puts it together with the breaking of the GL and he says a cheap magician can do it was he using a cheap magician's trick in the basis of what he was doing but he was using it to help her faith mental faith is very strong could we have it just to that way to put our whole lives on it Peter was willing to put everything he had on whether or not that man out there could get him and put him back in the boat what about it mental faith is a strong thing we're going to realize one of these days that the biggest portion of the world is mental Faith but now you tell me those people right over there you call them mental Faith but you tell me that church right over there if somebody comes in there and gets healed who heals them there's no healer outside of God Don't Make of nobody just remember they may be making doing something you and I can't do you say them people that walks on the colds of fire I ain't stupid I ain't going to do that I agree with you ain't either but I'm not going to make fun of him doing it cuz you know what he got something I ain't got who takes care of him now remember the devil can't take care of you right so don't say the devil took care of him uh-uh the prophet says God knows their faith see we want to blame it on everything else instead of just being straight and Lord what have I got mental Faith or a spiritual Revelation yeah but if I admit I just got a mental faith I'm saying I'm lost I'd he'd rather say I'm lost and find out how to get saved then for me to go in my own concept and never admit I was lost cuz if you never admit you lost you can't be helped amen yeah when I followed this message from for 40 years amen does that save us no think about it father we love you Lord and we thank you for all things and we just ask you to go with us now as we go eat a natural meal bring us back together this evening in you Lord we ask you to help us to understand because father we we put everything we got upon you we don't have nothing left over just in case this don't work we've got everything based upon you and your word then there's nothing else for us as the disciples said maybe we could at least say thou Hast the words of eternal life work can we go we can't go nowhere else we have to stand in you we love you and we thank you bless each one be with everybody Lord just take care of us guide us in Jesus name amen you're dismissed he touched me oh he touched me
