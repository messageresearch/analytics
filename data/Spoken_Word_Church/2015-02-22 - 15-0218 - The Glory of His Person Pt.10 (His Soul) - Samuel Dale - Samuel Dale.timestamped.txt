[17:37] you we thank you for all things in Jesus
[17:41] name
[17:43] amen Revelations
[17:46] 1 we've been reading this for quite a
[17:48] while still don't haven't got around to
[17:50] our thought have we verse 10 I was in
[17:54] the spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[17:56] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[17:59] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[18:01] and the last and what thou see us write
[18:03] in a book and send it unto the seven
[18:05] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[18:08] and unto per Samaria and unto pergamus
[18:11] and unto Tara and unto Sardis and un
[18:14] Philadelphia and unto lady oil the age
[18:17] that we're living in right so it's
[18:19] written down to us if you think this is
[18:22] not it go look up the word lady oia
[18:25] you'll find that it means people's
[18:26] rights right if you can't look on the
[18:29] news and see everybody's wanting their
[18:32] rights if you can't see that means the
[18:34] end of it you know all
[18:36] right and I turned to see the voice that
[18:38] spake with me and being turned I saw
[18:40] seven golden candlesticks in the midst
[18:42] of the seven candlesticks one like unto
[18:45] the son of man clothe with a garment
[18:47] down to the foot and gir about the paps
[18:49] with a golden girdle all right let's go
[18:52] over to
[18:54] Romans
[18:56] 1 and we'll start with verse 19 because
[19:01] that which may be known of God is
[19:04] Manifest in them it's talking about the
[19:06] the people of the unrighteousness Wrath
[19:08] is revealed and all right for God has
[19:12] showed it unto them see they they're not
[19:15] blind people want to say oh the people
[19:17] just don't
[19:18] know no people know for the invisible
[19:22] things of him from the creation of the
[19:25] world are clearly seen being understood
[19:28] by the things that are made even his
[19:30] eternal power and godhead so that they
[19:33] are without excuse you may be seated the
[19:38] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[19:41] the word all right what about a people
[19:43] that are without
[19:48] excuse you know you can say well I don't
[19:51] know this and I haven't heard that and
[19:54] you
[19:54] know it's without
[19:57] excuse now what we've been doing for
[20:00] quite a while is building up
[20:03] a uh thing to or whatever you want to
[20:07] call it a scenario as those big old
[20:09] words are in our land today and I just
[20:13] call it plainly trying to unfold what
[20:16] has been a mystery since the foundation
[20:18] of the world that God has been trying to
[20:23] make your
[20:25] known and you know what we've been doing
[20:27] we've been trying our best to make it
[20:30] confusing because that's what we've got
[20:32] you turn on the radio today and you
[20:34] would hear one preacher talking about
[20:36] this way one talking about that way one
[20:38] going that way another going that way
[20:41] but everybody's got the
[20:43] truth you
[20:44] know
[20:47] well according to the Bible it says that
[20:50] you shall know the
[20:52] truth and the
[20:54] truth shall set you free all right so it
[20:57] have to be the truth if we don't know
[20:59] the truth then we're we're mly confused
[21:02] but trying to look at the things because
[21:06] we read there in the scriptures that uh
[21:10] you know you say well I can't understand
[21:12] the Bible I can't understand this I
[21:15] can't understand that but look at that
[21:17] scripture that we just read right of
[21:20] what it
[21:22] says says for the invisible things of
[21:25] him from the creation of the world
[21:29] are clearly
[21:30] seen what being understood by the things
[21:34] that are
[21:35] made by his eternal
[21:38] power and godhead even his eternal power
[21:42] and godhead
[21:43] all you said but we can't understand God
[21:46] it's a mystery that's what mankind has
[21:49] done to make it a mystery to where we
[21:51] would not seek after God to understand I
[21:56] agree that it has to be revealed to you
[21:58] because that's the only way that it can
[22:00] ever be done is to be revealed and to
[22:03] just you know take man's ideas and
[22:07] thoughts uh you can get into things that
[22:10] help you and a lot of commentaries has
[22:13] been made a lot of things has been said
[22:16] that have been good things you know to
[22:18] help us to understand but the main thing
[22:21] is to look right into God's word to me
[22:25] and as we look into the word of God we
[22:29] see
[22:30] that you know God can be understood yes
[22:35] amen as we read here right even his
[22:39] eternal power and godhead can be
[22:42] understood by
[22:44] what by the things that we see right
[22:48] amen all right we look around and we try
[22:51] to look at the
[22:53] creation and we see in the creation that
[22:56] everything was created perfect
[22:59] now I didn't say Eternal cuz you can't
[23:01] create anything Eternal that's that's a
[23:04] that's a point that we've you know tried
[23:06] to do you've got to have a impartation
[23:08] to have eternal life you can't have
[23:10] something
[23:12] created because you can't create
[23:15] eternity all right we see then we look
[23:18] at the look at the world and the things
[23:21] and we they in geneses you know and
[23:23] we've been kind of coming down to that
[23:25] point of the creation and we look around
[23:29] and we see how he created the world
[23:32] right all right I said he made it
[23:35] perfect I didn't say
[23:37] Eternal all right he made the animals he
[23:41] made the the the all of the things and
[23:44] as he was making those things they were
[23:47] made perfect amen cuz God cannot make
[23:50] anything
[23:51] imperfect you say well well it's God's
[23:55] fault that I'm like I am no no no I'm
[23:58] sorry why don't you try to find somebody
[24:01] else to blame it on cuz you're not going
[24:03] to be able to blame on God your problems
[24:06] that's what my brother one time he said
[24:08] you know he's talking
[24:09] about uh he's a Methodist Minister and
[24:12] he was talking about how that God made
[24:15] evil I said no he didn't make evil well
[24:18] the Bible says that he knows good and
[24:22] evil I create this he didn't create evil
[24:26] How could an eternal God create anything
[24:29] evil you don't don't even think about
[24:32] that don't even consider well well he
[24:34] made he made me like I am that's what he
[24:36] said he said he can't judge me for being
[24:39] like I am cuz he made me I said no no no
[24:42] no no now big brother he's got about 8
[24:45] years or close to 12 years in college
[24:48] you know over in the cemetery you know
[24:50] with him and uh so but I told him I said
[24:54] now you can't blame these things on God
[24:57] Amen that's right it's you that made
[24:59] yourself a sinner because he made you a
[25:01] free moral agent and then that way you
[25:04] choose and when you choose then you go
[25:06] the way you're going and and that way it
[25:09] it doesn't you don't blame God and don't
[25:11] blame Mama and Daddy and don't blame a
[25:14] uncle and whatever you know you just
[25:16] take it up on yourself and just look
[25:19] right straight at it and say well all
[25:21] right Lord forgive me and help me right
[25:24] cuz he couldn't create anything wrong so
[25:27] we can look back at to creation and
[25:29] that's the point I've been driving at uh
[25:31] in this last few weeks is to getting
[25:34] down to the
[25:36] creation all right and looking at the
[25:39] creation you know the by looking at the
[25:42] creation we can see the Creator amen
[25:44] right right right I mean you go down to
[25:48] the doctor's office today and he'll put
[25:50] you up there and they they run a few
[25:52] test on you and he says well you got
[25:53] this you got that but he's just dealing
[25:56] with what he's dealing with but he cuz
[25:58] he can't explain what all that is inside
[26:00] of you amen you know I mean they can
[26:05] take things out of one person and put
[26:07] them in another
[26:08] one right and it'll
[26:12] attach but you wouldn't want to put a a
[26:15] kidney attached to the liver would
[26:18] you why because it's not made to go
[26:20] there but yet you can take I don't know
[26:23] what those big old words that they've
[26:25] got there for it you can take some
[26:26] things out of one person put it in
[26:28] another person and it'll help them you
[26:30] know why because that's so designed in
[26:33] the human body until that human body
[26:36] when God made it that cells or whatever
[26:39] that you place there to help the person
[26:42] goes to one
[26:44] spot right and it helps that situation
[26:49] that's in that place because it's so
[26:52] designed that
[26:54] way I mean what keeps you alive while
[26:57] you asleep
[26:58] right that's right well you just go into
[27:01] this yeah you just got some kind of a
[27:04] sensible answer but what really keeps
[27:06] you
[27:07] alive what keeps you going what keeps
[27:10] all of these things is because God made
[27:12] you that way he made you perfect he
[27:16] didn't make us Eternal he made us
[27:18] Perfect all right then being made
[27:21] perfect then we have to receive eternity
[27:24] to be able to talk about something
[27:26] Eternal but now in the
[27:29] creation we can look at the creation and
[27:32] find the Creator or laying right there
[27:35] right science is going haywire and can't
[27:38] figure out a blade of Grace that's right
[27:40] they can go to the Moon they can go to
[27:42] this they can go to Mars they can go to
[27:44] all these places and just like the
[27:46] prophet said when they was doing all of
[27:49] those things I remember one of those
[27:50] statements he said well they're going to
[27:52] the Moon he said but when they get up
[27:53] there they ain't going to find nothing
[27:55] well that was a sensible answer me you
[27:58] don't find nothing why because you know
[28:02] here's where we're living so let's stay
[28:04] down here all right but thinking about
[28:07] looking at the creation to find the
[28:09] Creator if you can't see God do that
[28:12] part just look around you amen right
[28:14] that's right just think about you and
[28:17] the way you're living and the way you're
[28:18] doing the way your heart keeps beating
[28:20] how all of these things Works within the
[28:23] organism orever what you call them
[28:25] organs of the B of the body that you are
[28:29] and all of that works so perfect right
[28:32] right until it would have to be a
[28:34] Creator am all right if there is a
[28:37] creation there's no question of whether
[28:39] there's a lot of people that say they're
[28:41] atheists I say they're idiots but that's
[28:44] their opinion and their points if that's
[28:45] what they want to be you can be dumb if
[28:47] you want to but see they say well there
[28:50] is no God well then who started
[28:54] what well it all come from a pow walk
[28:57] word the PO what come
[28:59] from well it came from
[29:03] energy well where did the energy come
[29:09] from solves a problem the things that we
[29:12] see proves that there is a
[29:16] God all right and looking at the
[29:19] creation then we can see that He makes
[29:22] himself known through his creation amen
[29:26] as we've just read here in the scripture
[29:27] right even to understanding the Eternal
[29:32] godhead all right we make the
[29:35] illustrations a lot and all but it it
[29:37] really helps us see I'm a
[29:40] father I'm a human
[29:42] being you know I'm a grandfather a
[29:46] great-grandfather I've have many many
[29:49] titles right and things to
[29:52] me but yet I'm just one
[29:56] person so I just can't understand how
[29:59] there's one God there's got to be at
[30:01] least two you know they got the tuness
[30:04] people goes in there or maybe three
[30:06] anyway so I was talking to a person one
[30:09] day and uh we got to talking about the
[30:13] godhead and after a while he said well
[30:16] okay said if the father and the Holy
[30:19] Ghost is the self-sign spirit I said
[30:22] well would you explain how it can be any
[30:24] other way you know he said okay I guess
[30:29] we're down to two now I said well you
[30:33] done pretty good getting rid of one of
[30:34] your Gods why don't you just go ahead
[30:36] and hack off one of the others and we'll
[30:38] get down on some basic levels and talk
[30:40] about one God because you know the Bible
[30:44] says that the Commandments What right
[30:47] there's just one Lord the Bible says
[30:49] there's one Lord One Faith one baptism
[30:52] or one God one Faith you
[30:53] know all
[30:55] right looking at the creation
[30:59] to find a
[31:00] Creator if you ever question whether
[31:02] there's a God or not go look in the
[31:06] mirror and look at yourself and see how
[31:09] you got there like
[31:11] that just just look around amen that's
[31:16] right and see things right all right and
[31:20] then when you do see you can look back
[31:22] and you can see that all of that is what
[31:24] that's doing is God revealing himself
[31:27] amen amen cuz he's making himself known
[31:31] by the creation that he's there and and
[31:34] that way the the the human being can't
[31:37] say well I don't
[31:40] understand you don't have to be educated
[31:42] to understand the disciples none of them
[31:45] outside of the Apostle Paul could
[31:47] probably even write their name
[31:49] righten right they were ignorant and
[31:53] unlearned as far as worldly
[31:55] things but yet they were the ones that
[31:57] were chosen to write the word and
[32:00] probably on a lot of them some of them
[32:02] had probably even get somebody else to
[32:04] write it
[32:06] right you know somebody did you get in
[32:08] there and you find out that like Luke he
[32:11] was great you know in the writings and
[32:14] the things but just think about it
[32:17] now to understand this person that we
[32:20] read of in Revelations that it says that
[32:23] that one liken the son of man G about to
[32:25] pouch with a golden girdle and coming on
[32:27] down and and then it'll show his face
[32:30] and it shows his feet it shows all the
[32:33] things you know we look at God as being
[32:37] uh our B basic thoughts of God is like
[32:40] I've been trying to cover for about
[32:42] three months now how real is your
[32:45] god I ask you that question well he's
[32:48] just a
[32:50] spirit you know he's just a
[32:53] spirit he's just floating around he's
[32:56] just a spirit well now we found out that
[33:00] that can't be
[33:01] true now what's one of the reasons that
[33:04] it can't be
[33:05] true you know what's one of the reasons
[33:08] that it can't be true that God is just
[33:10] like the wind just blowing about well
[33:12] the prophet said okay we believe that
[33:15] right we believe
[33:17] that because he saw it but what did he
[33:21] do he saw God is real is a reason he
[33:24] said that he's not like the
[33:26] wind right saw him real had he just seen
[33:29] the wind he' said he was the
[33:31] wind all
[33:33] right but see we we look at it and we
[33:36] say well God is a
[33:39] spirit so we just have him as just just
[33:42] floats he just
[33:43] everywhere you
[33:45] know
[33:47] well you mean he created you right amen
[33:52] right greater than he
[33:55] is you mean you're more real
[33:59] come on we've been over in Genesis where
[34:02] it said let us make man in our own image
[34:05] well if God is just a spirit then we
[34:07] ain't nothing but spirit so what
[34:10] happened somewhere the poliwags got
[34:13] involved right right somewhere the human
[34:17] being got
[34:18] involved somewhere this body got
[34:21] involved you mean that that God is just
[34:23] nothing but just a spirit floating
[34:25] around and just I've tried to illustr
[34:27] rate that over so much because I know
[34:29] what the human mind
[34:31] thinks you know cuz I have one it don't
[34:35] work too good sometimes but I have
[34:38] one but you see we try to figure it all
[34:42] out but do you mean to tell me that that
[34:46] there is a
[34:47] God that is just a spirit but yet he
[34:50] created all of
[34:52] this well that wouldn't be in His image
[34:55] that's you're going in reverse
[35:00] right remember it says he created man in
[35:04] his own image and his likeness wellin
[35:07] some words there's got to be something
[35:09] that looks familiar to this type of us
[35:15] that he created it from or or brought
[35:18] forth right but see that's what I've
[35:20] been driving at for the longest try to
[35:22] get us to just look
[35:25] sensibly come on we if we just think
[35:29] sensibly about
[35:31] things if we're created in His image
[35:33] then we're supposed to just be spirits
[35:36] who got the rest of us here where did it
[35:38] come from who created
[35:41] it well he just made us more
[35:45] tangible well then the Bible's not right
[35:49] that's right that's right right come on
[35:52] cuz the Bible said we were created In
[35:54] His
[35:55] Image in his likeness yes all right if
[35:59] we're created in his likeness he's got
[36:01] to be look something like we
[36:03] are well I Brother D I've always just
[36:06] thought that God is just a spirit
[36:10] that's that's what you've been taught
[36:12] all of your life instead of sitting down
[36:16] thinking about something for
[36:17] yourself you just go back and take what
[36:20] somebody told you Grandma Grandpa
[36:23] preacher Pastor whatever you're just
[36:26] taking what's somebody else says instead
[36:29] of a
[36:30] reality but see God let some people look
[36:34] beyond the natural points to where that
[36:37] they can say
[36:39] well I've seen this I've seen that right
[36:43] all right and brother R said that is for
[36:45] the purpose of where that they can help
[36:47] you to help you to understand all right
[36:51] and like I said you mean to tell me that
[36:54] that this this pull pit is made of wood
[36:57] it's pretty
[36:58] hard it's it's pretty tangible you know
[37:01] it's pretty
[37:02] solid and you mean God is Not greater
[37:05] than
[37:07] that he's not more
[37:10] real than
[37:16] that why would we have any trouble with
[37:19] thinking about
[37:22] it if he was capable of in like Genesis
[37:25] 1 and one I think it is where it said
[37:28] God made the heavens and the earth now
[37:31] where did he get the material to make
[37:36] it well okay he spoke it into existence
[37:39] that's a good point he spoke into
[37:41] existence the material it would take to
[37:43] make the Earth right that's good but you
[37:47] mean that he's not more real than that
[37:50] yeah come on
[37:52] now what kind of a god do you have I'm
[37:55] not going to serve a God that that some
[37:57] kind of a thing that cannot help me if I
[38:00] need
[38:02] him and I'm not talking about going out
[38:05] and getting in trouble where I need him
[38:07] I'm talking about when I need him that I
[38:10] can call on him and believe he's
[38:12] real that's right if he's just a spirit
[38:15] he might be all somewhere else blowing
[38:17] around right when I need
[38:21] him
[38:24] right I know I make carnal illustrations
[38:27] but I want you to
[38:29] think what kind of a god do you
[38:33] have you remember years ago who was it
[38:36] with the man that put out the thing been
[38:38] back in the 60s I guess and said God was
[38:41] dead
[38:43] yes you remember
[38:46] that well you know to the biggest
[38:49] portion of the world right he might as
[38:51] well be right right but you know
[38:55] everybody jumped on the bandwagon and
[38:57] started saying well you know no God's
[39:00] not dead and they wrote songs I talk to
[39:03] him today well that's good
[39:06] right that's real
[39:08] good but did he ever talk
[39:12] back well God don't speak to
[39:15] us what's the problem right you know the
[39:18] reason he don't speak to
[39:20] us come on you know the reason he don't
[39:22] speak to us is because our brain is so
[39:25] full of all of the garbage can of the
[39:27] world
[39:28] right and he doesn't like to dwell in
[39:30] that oh but but but God only speaks to
[39:32] the prophet well you want where the
[39:34] Prophet
[39:35] said what's wrong we listening to him
[39:37] the other night he said what's
[39:41] wrong why can't we believe God can
[39:45] talk amen we're not talking about the
[39:48] word coming to you we're not in the
[39:50] garbage cans okay we're not talking
[39:53] about you're trying to be a prophet for
[39:54] God to speak something different we're
[39:56] talking about this simply being God what
[39:59] about the
[40:00] gifts what about the gifts that work
[40:02] amen what about God revealing to
[40:06] people are speaking in in in tongues and
[40:10] interpretation and and saying get out
[40:12] because there's a storm coming
[40:15] righten what about those things
[40:17] amen you see I I believe God is
[40:21] real not just the thoughts of your mind
[40:25] because if he's just a spirit then he's
[40:27] no more than the thoughts of your mind
[40:29] to what you are and you know what that
[40:30] makes you greater than he
[40:32] is come on do you realize why I scream
[40:35] so much at that our stupidity and our
[40:38] human doings we think we're greater than
[40:47] God
[40:49] well I thought maybe that he was going
[40:51] to destroy the biggest portion of the
[40:54] people of the world one day that's right
[40:56] right sir
[40:57] y right right right you know the Bible
[41:00] says Don't Fear him that can destroy the
[41:03] body right Satan can work on that right
[41:07] we got Adam bombs we got all kind of
[41:09] guns and everything going you know house
[41:11] was burning up the other day they said
[41:13] somewhere my wife was telling me about
[41:15] it and the people told me said Don't Get
[41:17] Around said there's ammunition in there
[41:20] well some hour later there were still
[41:22] bullets flying all over the place and
[41:24] finally it hit the gas tanks or
[41:26] something and it blowed up the whole
[41:27] place and burnt a house well you know
[41:30] you mean
[41:32] that see we're a bunch of dummies all
[41:35] we've done is created death and want to
[41:38] call it life all right but think about
[41:41] it just simply
[41:45] think if God is not more real than
[41:48] anything we see tangibly we look at you
[41:51] know then we better find us a
[41:56] God right
[41:57] right and you see why people like the
[42:00] man said that God was dead well you know
[42:02] what to him it
[42:03] was he wasn't aive right amen and that
[42:07] bumf fall is little the biggest portion
[42:09] of the people you know when they went to
[42:11] the moon you know the Russians said we
[42:14] went up to the moon and back and we
[42:15] didn't see no
[42:19] God but what they didn't keep up with
[42:21] was when they did go up there and back
[42:24] that they did make reports of a light
[42:25] following them
[42:27] all the way there and all the way
[42:29] back but they didn't want to tell that
[42:33] see because it means there something
[42:35] real I'm simply asking you a question
[42:37] what about your
[42:40] God is your god capable of taking care
[42:43] of you
[42:46] amen now if he's just a spirit he can't
[42:49] heal you
[42:51] right come on you say yes he can cuz he
[42:55] can oh he can create Hils okay now you
[42:59] trapped your own self cuz see you have
[43:01] to create something to heal you a spirit
[43:04] can't heal
[43:07] you see God had to come down and pay the
[43:12] price right to release his own life to
[43:16] be able to come back in us to give us
[43:17] eternal life and soul right and he had
[43:20] to take the stripes to let the blood run
[43:22] out to where that it would be for the
[43:24] healing Factor
[43:28] because there only life in the creation
[43:30] of sales all
[43:32] right but see think about
[43:35] him how real is he that's
[43:41] it is he real enough to talk
[43:46] to well if he's real enough to talk to
[43:48] why wouldn't you expect him to talk
[43:51] back oh we're still hung on that though
[43:54] you know we've got it all figured out
[43:56] nobody God don't speak to nobody but the
[43:58] prophets give me that in the
[44:01] Bible well it says in Amos 3 and 7
[44:04] that's the word coming to the People by
[44:08] way of God using the
[44:11] prophets
[44:13] right who was it that was over there in
[44:15] prison and it went over and opened the
[44:16] door and went out you know God could do
[44:19] all of that and he could do he could
[44:20] speak see we limited him to the basis to
[44:24] where that he cannot speak to us
[44:28] I'm not talking about that we have to do
[44:30] this that or the other but isn't it
[44:32] something wonderful every once in a
[44:33] while to just feel his
[44:37] presence maybe some of you have never
[44:40] failed it that way I'm
[44:43] honest maybe some of you have never
[44:45] walked down a road or at night or
[44:48] somewhere and just know that there's
[44:51] somebody right there beside you
[44:57] maybe some of you have never been like
[44:58] joshh in a car
[45:02] wreck if I could play I got a
[45:06] pick and like Josh was in a car and had
[45:09] a wreck and the people that were behind
[45:12] him when they when Josh got out of the
[45:15] car they wanted to know where the other
[45:17] person
[45:20] was because they said there was a man
[45:23] got out of that car besides him and
[45:26] walked down through the woods oh but we
[45:28] can't see God do we the reason you can't
[45:31] see him you don't know how to look for
[45:33] him you don't know where to look you
[45:36] don't what don't know what to look
[45:38] at
[45:42] right do you understand what I'm driving
[45:44] at see he said let us make man in our
[45:47] image right our
[45:50] likeness well what kind of an image and
[45:52] likeness did God have right well he's
[45:55] just a spirit so then we're just spirit
[45:56] so let's go
[46:01] home
[46:02] right do you realize what you're saying
[46:04] you're saying you're just a spirit
[46:06] because you're created His
[46:10] Image see you're not thinking about him
[46:12] being
[46:14] real you only have him as an imaginary
[46:17] position and especially something to
[46:19] just try to keep you from going to hell
[46:21] when life is over yeah right isn't that
[46:24] basically what most people want y i
[46:29] right they just want him down at the
[46:33] end right they want somebody to take
[46:36] them over down at the end when life is
[46:40] over is that the way the prophet said it
[46:43] he said most people don't serve him
[46:44] because they love him he said they serve
[46:46] him because they trying to keep him
[46:47] going to hell right is that your
[46:53] way you're just serving him because that
[46:56] you you you you you don't want to be
[46:58] destroyed one
[47:00] day well why don't you just get born
[47:03] again and then you don't have to worry
[47:04] about being
[47:05] destroyed why don't you just get his
[47:07] life in you
[47:10] amen right amen why don't you just die
[47:14] out to all of those stupid ideas that we
[47:16] have
[47:18] right and accept Jesus Christ as our
[47:20] savior and let him come and live in our
[47:22] hearts and our lives and then you find
[47:23] out in a hurry that he's real
[47:27] that's right but you know what most
[47:28] people come to the altar they come to
[47:30] the altar because somebody's begged them
[47:31] or pleaded with them that's why we don't
[47:33] do that away we don't walk down the
[47:35] aisle and say you need to come to the
[47:37] altar no make sure you're LED of God
[47:41] before you go do that because you're
[47:44] causing that person a problem right you
[47:49] said well I feel led to go talk to them
[47:51] no no you got good points in your mind
[47:57] right you you telling me I'm not L of
[47:59] the Lord no no you just told me you
[48:04] wouldn't because you don't know about
[48:07] God Amen if you knew about God then
[48:09] you'd accept the fact that you don't
[48:11] have to try to plead with somebody to
[48:13] get them to come to the altar to be
[48:17] saved if your God is real you don't have
[48:19] to plead with nobody
[48:22] amen see that's what it was done in my
[48:24] my brother-in-law got killed in a car at
[48:26] accident I was probably 18 17 years old
[48:31] and uh I've told you my life story of
[48:34] Parts you know that where I believe I
[48:36] met God and where I just went on my
[48:40] own but yet my sister done the greatest
[48:43] damage could ever be when she walked to
[48:45] all Li walked down through the church
[48:48] and told me said Sam you need to come to
[48:51] the alar you know JC didn't have no
[48:53] hopes he got killed real quick
[48:56] said you need to come to
[48:59] altar well I've told you this before I
[49:02] had more confidence in JC that was her
[49:05] husband as a Christian than I had in her
[49:08] as
[49:10] one yet she prayed she cried she said
[49:13] she felt the Lord she'd held on to his
[49:15] legs I don't doubt it I have no problems
[49:18] with her I'm just
[49:20] saying she didn't line up as much as her
[49:23] husband did and see that throwed me away
[49:25] from coming to the altar
[49:28] I had to get over the church to be saved
[49:30] that's right
[49:32] amen amen that's right come on can I
[49:35] quote the
[49:37] prophet he said the thing that was to
[49:39] bring us to
[49:42] Christ it's paraphrasing be very close
[49:44] on he said was what took us away from
[49:50] Christ you said well we Tau them little
[49:53] kids they need to come and get saved
[49:54] yeah father son Holy Ghost is going to
[49:56] save us yeah we need to get them saved
[49:59] that's that was good that was all right
[50:00] I'm not against that right I'm just
[50:02] saying what did we teach them
[50:04] right that come on later in our lives
[50:06] and has to be eradicated out of us and
[50:09] it's hard to get that eradicated
[50:12] today because we still have our thoughts
[50:15] about is there three gods or one God or
[50:17] what is it doing right because the devil
[50:20] if he don't talk to you he's yours be
[50:22] well I guess the reason he don't talk to
[50:23] you cuz he's too busy with me that's
[50:26] maybe it's the best way to say it I'm
[50:29] open and
[50:31] blunt see by the time you get it
[50:34] thoughts in your mind that you get it
[50:35] figured out that you see something about
[50:37] that time it goes Haywire right
[50:40] especially when I come
[50:42] along and you think you got it all
[50:44] figured out and then you come on and say
[50:45] well brother Dale I thought I knew what
[50:47] I was talking about till you started
[50:49] preaching
[50:53] right but you see Church
[50:57] to me God is
[51:03] real he's more real than we
[51:09] are he's more real than any of our
[51:12] thoughts could ever be of
[51:16] anything and he came into the world
[51:19] himself not sin and a son that we think
[51:22] yeah now where's that in the Bible I
[51:25] want it
[51:27] did he send a son no he came
[51:31] himself right he didn't send a son show
[51:34] it to him in the Bible he came
[51:38] himself would you send a son to die for
[51:43] you come on be
[51:46] sensible would you send one of your well
[51:49] somebody's got to die so we'll pick out
[51:50] one of the
[51:52] kids oh boy you're good mom and
[51:55] daddy no
[51:58] amen now see God came himself down to
[52:02] pay the
[52:03] price that you and I would be able to
[52:06] receive
[52:07] salvation
[52:09] am all right and being able to do that
[52:12] then it would bring us to an
[52:14] understanding about
[52:16] him of how real he is that's
[52:20] it oh but but but brother Dale all I've
[52:23] known all my life is just a spirit well
[52:28] I think it's about time to get rid of
[52:29] some of our
[52:30] thoughts you said but that's what the
[52:33] Bible
[52:34] says but the Bible says he has hands he
[52:38] has a heart he has a head that's right
[52:43] and he is a
[52:44] soul I'm not going to say it the way you
[52:46] thinking it you're still thinking that
[52:48] God has a soul no you're
[52:52] incorrect God doesn't have a soul he is
[52:55] a soul amen we'll get to that this
[52:58] afternoon all
[52:59] right but you see we don't read all the
[53:03] Bible we just read what we want to
[53:05] read right
[53:09] amen the Old Testament it asked to or
[53:11] talk about how that there would be a
[53:13] price to be pray paid for the life of a
[53:17] person and it would say a ransom for the
[53:20] soul
[53:27] well see then if we are a
[53:30] soul and the word soul is like a being
[53:33] or person or whatever you are I'll give
[53:35] you the definitions more this afternoon
[53:38] but save in
[53:40] time see a
[53:43] soul the Bible speaks a lot about a
[53:47] soul you know that Jesus in the garden
[53:50] said my soul is troubled
[53:54] that's you I no problems say didn't it
[53:56] did
[53:59] he the Bible
[54:02] says in acts coming over from
[54:06] Psalms that I'll not leave his soul in
[54:10] Hell neither suffer my Holy One to see
[54:14] corruption amen so we know that the body
[54:18] came out of the grave in Le in 72 hours
[54:21] in it where there wouldn't be no
[54:22] corruption set in to where it would be
[54:25] correct
[54:27] what about his
[54:31] soul what do you think about your
[54:35] soul what do you think about you how
[54:37] real are you
[54:40] right oh I'm you I'm just a
[54:47] spirit we get down to it eventually or
[54:50] to a point to where that we can look at
[54:52] it and see what a soul really
[54:55] is amen it's
[54:57] you it's your being it's your person
[55:00] that's Webster's definition right y it's
[55:04] the part of you that
[55:05] lives it's the part of you that distinct
[55:08] from the
[55:09] body amen and you know in the the Bible
[55:12] it don't say the spirit that sin us
[55:14] shall
[55:15] die the Bible says the soul that sinth
[55:18] shall
[55:23] die the soul is more real than and in
[55:26] your physical body amen yet we don't
[55:29] believe
[55:31] that we just think it's a nature of some
[55:37] Spirit we can quote that can't
[55:40] we but it's like I told you I want to
[55:43] quote where brother randam said the soul
[55:46] is just the nature of the spirit there
[55:48] is no such
[55:49] thing he says the soul is the nature of
[55:52] the spirit he said what's the difference
[55:54] because if you're just saying it's just
[55:55] the nature you got a dog being a bird
[55:59] dog a hound dog
[56:02] a right that's a
[56:06] nature what do you think about you how
[56:09] real are
[56:11] you maybe we might find out how real God
[56:14] is when once we ever find out how real
[56:16] we are that's
[56:18] right amen
[56:21] yep listening last night to the prophet
[56:23] talking about you know how that a man
[56:27] just set a GCE up and by looking at it
[56:30] and using his
[56:32] own vibes from his body broke the G in
[56:35] front of
[56:39] him look how real we are that you know
[56:43] the birds and the dogs and the cats I
[56:46] know some of you love your wonderful
[56:47] little dogs and cats that's fine that's
[56:49] okay but remember they don't have a soul
[56:53] that's
[56:54] right oh they're so h no that's not even
[56:58] good sensible they have a spirit within
[57:02] them that motivates them and guides them
[57:06] but they don't have a soul man is the
[57:08] only thing that has a
[57:11] soul that's
[57:15] right and being the human being as to be
[57:19] a soul then evidently God must amen if
[57:23] we have a soul if we are a soul if we
[57:25] are a
[57:27] then we're in the image of
[57:30] God then what kind of a god do you
[57:34] have yeah but we're looking at a we're
[57:37] just looking
[57:39] at I don't know I was thinking about
[57:41] this the other day how we look at the
[57:43] human body and
[57:45] things you realize that we know that
[57:47] there's a spirit within this body
[57:49] because my hands cannot go up and down
[57:51] unless something within this body
[57:54] motivates it from my brain that's right
[57:57] right but now my brain is not my soul
[58:00] right
[58:04] right my brain is just a
[58:07] computer yep bunch of sales and bunch of
[58:10] things got to be motivated by
[58:13] something my wife sit and look at a
[58:16] computer all day long she don't know how
[58:17] to turn it
[58:18] on Timothy brother dy's little boy one
[58:21] day was riding down the road piggy kept
[58:24] saying that I don't even how to turn him
[58:25] on he said sister Dale is at that own
[58:27] button you m it all got a good life but
[58:31] she was meaning I know nothing about
[58:33] operating it you
[58:36] know so the computer is smarter than her
[58:39] you know cuz it sets there and got a lot
[58:42] of
[58:43] information she just don't know how to
[58:45] get
[58:46] it that's all your brain
[58:49] is it's not your spirit it's not there's
[58:52] a spirit within us right
[58:56] that's motivating us amen that's it but
[59:00] you know your body and your spirit is
[59:02] not the real
[59:05] you that's what I'm driving at folks the
[59:08] soul is the real you because I quote in
[59:11] the scripture there a while ago it said
[59:12] the soul that sin it shall die it
[59:14] doesn't say the body because body can't
[59:15] sin right there's no sin in the body
[59:17] without the spirit that's right there
[59:20] about to be a motivational part makes
[59:21] that work all right but the soul is more
[59:24] real than the spirit cuz the soul lives
[59:28] on after
[59:32] death the best you can say about the
[59:34] spirit is it goes back to God who gave
[59:36] it but be careful once you use that
[59:39] because you're you're saying it goes
[59:41] back to God and be careful that sinful
[59:44] Spirit can't go back to God right now
[59:48] that's just don't play with words that
[59:51] way you can't put a sinful Spirit back
[59:52] to God he would annihilate it quick as
[59:55] it come into His presence
[59:57] so then there has to be something else
[59:58] maybe that scripture is only speaking of
[1:00:02] and it really was speaking of Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ if you go check your scripture
[1:00:06] where Spirit goes back to God who gave
[1:00:09] it but if it is we can talk about it if
[1:00:12] you want to talk about it as being a a
[1:00:16] Christian but remember no matter what
[1:00:18] whether you're sinner or Saint you are a
[1:00:22] soul amen that's right you're a person
[1:00:25] your being y your
[1:00:29] nature and you're a little
[1:00:31] Creator that's true right
[1:00:36] yep birds build their nest the same
[1:00:40] way right dogs do the same thing cats do
[1:00:44] the same thing but human is constantly
[1:00:49] learning right the dog has an ability to
[1:00:52] communicate with other dogs to a degree
[1:00:54] they know certain things they can follow
[1:00:56] a pack or whatever they want to do but
[1:00:59] they can't use it to reason
[1:01:03] out what's going on oh yeah you can
[1:01:05] teach a course to count but just
[1:01:08] remember he knows to hit three times and
[1:01:10] you're going to give him one piece of
[1:01:12] bread or four times you going to give
[1:01:13] him two pieces of bread he just learns
[1:01:16] by that smartness of those things all
[1:01:19] right but he has no soul of that's why
[1:01:21] the Bible says in there in Genesis and
[1:01:24] he God breathed into the of Adam and he
[1:01:27] became a living
[1:01:30] Soul all right when a baby is dropped
[1:01:34] from the
[1:01:37] mother there is a little life waiting
[1:01:39] for that amen baby to come into because
[1:01:43] God then Mom and Daddy by God you giving
[1:01:47] them the ability they can bring a body
[1:01:50] into
[1:01:51] existence but the Soul and Spirit has to
[1:01:53] come from almighty God yes amen
[1:01:56] right and see then by doing that that's
[1:01:59] that soul is the real you amen so then
[1:02:03] the Soul is if we talk about God that's
[1:02:07] the real himym right sorry for the
[1:02:10] terminologies that's I don't have the
[1:02:13] education but it's the real
[1:02:15] hym
[1:02:18] right right amen that's why he would
[1:02:21] stand there in the garden when he was
[1:02:23] actually
[1:02:26] getting ready to be crucified you know
[1:02:28] just abouted and he says my soul is
[1:02:32] troubled but go back in the Old
[1:02:34] Testament where you find out he says
[1:02:36] that my soul is fed up with
[1:02:43] you my soul is fed up with
[1:02:46] you look up the word soul and just see
[1:02:49] what it
[1:02:50] means so you could find out that you
[1:02:52] could look at yourself and see a soul a
[1:02:54] human being
[1:03:03] right by way of the prophit and the
[1:03:05] understanding of doing and seeing then
[1:03:09] we can see
[1:03:11] that that
[1:03:13] Soul lives
[1:03:17] on right you remember beyond the curtain
[1:03:20] of time when he saw the people
[1:03:26] he said that the scripture says Souls
[1:03:28] under the altar well we're so smart we
[1:03:31] think no that Souls under the altar
[1:03:32] can't be well I remind you that
[1:03:37] 1965 but you
[1:03:39] see what is the soul of an
[1:03:45] individual it's
[1:03:47] you it's what you are
[1:03:53] am I look at your body
[1:03:58] your spirit can display things through
[1:04:00] that
[1:04:01] body
[1:04:03] y but your soul is what really you
[1:04:09] are if it wouldn't that way why do
[1:04:13] you you ever talk to
[1:04:17] yourself brother hus used to say he said
[1:04:20] the only time I know that I'm caring on
[1:04:22] intelligent conversation is when I'm
[1:04:23] talking to myself
[1:04:26] that's right
[1:04:32] amen how real are
[1:04:38] you you are so real until I could remove
[1:04:43] from you by way of killing you or
[1:04:46] whatever the body that you
[1:04:50] inhabit
[1:04:53] right I could cause that spirit by
[1:04:56] taking away that ability for that body
[1:04:58] to live and do that Spirit could be
[1:05:01] removed
[1:05:03] away but that
[1:05:05] Soul no matter whether you're a sinner
[1:05:08] or a saint that Soul's going to live
[1:05:12] on because that's why the scripture I
[1:05:14] talking about while ago don't fear him
[1:05:16] that can destroy the body but fear him
[1:05:20] that can destroy the
[1:05:22] soul I cannot destroy your soul right
[1:05:26] right
[1:05:28] right you can take your own life but you
[1:05:31] can't destroy your soul and live on
[1:05:37] somewhere CU that's the real you
[1:05:42] right getting away from the part of just
[1:05:46] saying God is a
[1:05:48] spirit not meaning that's not right
[1:05:50] because it is right amen
[1:05:54] sure cuz it takes Body Spirit and soul
[1:05:57] to make an individual
[1:05:59] amen any part left off is you're not
[1:06:05] complete
[1:06:07] right and see then God had to come down
[1:06:09] as I said while ago he didn't send a son
[1:06:13] he came
[1:06:15] himself that's right he gave his own
[1:06:18] life
[1:06:21] am he gave his own soul
[1:06:26] right in the Tomb when he was laying
[1:06:29] there we have
[1:06:31] scriptures that tells you what he was
[1:06:33] doing that's right he went and preached
[1:06:36] to the
[1:06:39] spirits Souls right that were in prison
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:45] now he was a witness to those who did
[1:06:50] not accept him that was in the days of
[1:06:53] knowing the things you know amen
[1:06:56] but you know what he was something else
[1:06:58] while he was there because he went down
[1:07:00] and you go down to the regions and you
[1:07:03] get down to where the devil and his
[1:07:06] parts are and there were people there
[1:07:07] that he had to be a witness against
[1:07:10] those were Souls right people right
[1:07:13] right y who' they look like they look
[1:07:16] like the person that was living on Earth
[1:07:19] right right
[1:07:21] amen all right you move over into
[1:07:24] another real when he starts back back up
[1:07:26] and he's doing another thing he's coming
[1:07:28] forth to be a witness to
[1:07:30] those that are in the regions of where
[1:07:33] it talks about the bosom of ab Abraham
[1:07:36] you know
[1:07:37] paradise and he's a witness to them that
[1:07:40] he was the Seed of Abraham
[1:07:43] amen and you know what he brought them
[1:07:47] out of that place now not the ones that
[1:07:49] were in the regions of the
[1:07:51] Lost those Souls remain there until the
[1:07:54] day of judgment am right but he brought
[1:07:57] them out of that place their
[1:08:02] soul all
[1:08:06] right see because that soul is the real
[1:08:09] them so no matter what whether you're a
[1:08:12] sinner or Saint you are a being you're a
[1:08:15] person you're a soul that's my whole
[1:08:17] point to get it
[1:08:21] Y and you're looking at him to pay the
[1:08:24] price
[1:08:26] he has to pay the price for our sins and
[1:08:28] the thing and then come back not as just
[1:08:30] an anointing of a spirit because that
[1:08:32] anointing of that Spirit can anoint you
[1:08:34] every day of your life and you you still
[1:08:36] not be right cuz you got balum you got
[1:08:39] all the different ones in the Bible you
[1:08:41] even got kyus prophesying of the Lord
[1:08:44] Jesus that one would have to die for the
[1:08:46] sins of the people but Kus is the one
[1:08:48] that also cause the judgment to come
[1:08:50] upon the Lord Jesus right yes so you can
[1:08:54] have that anointing ing upon you that
[1:08:57] Spirit can anoint you
[1:09:01] right not to do wrong
[1:09:06] now but that's still not the real
[1:09:09] you the real you is that part that we
[1:09:12] talk about
[1:09:13] Soul
[1:09:15] amen I run into a group of people years
[1:09:18] ago
[1:09:19] that there is actually a teaching that
[1:09:22] man didn't have a soul until a law came
[1:09:24] into being
[1:09:27] and he was really making a good teaching
[1:09:29] out of it there at work and I didn't
[1:09:31] interfere with him while he was speaking
[1:09:33] I just waited till he got through and
[1:09:35] people left and I said well son the only
[1:09:38] thing I got to say is that uh you said
[1:09:41] the law didn't come into existence
[1:09:43] until the soul didn't come into
[1:09:45] existence till the law came and I said
[1:09:47] according to my Bible it says in
[1:09:51] Genesis 27 I think it is
[1:09:55] he breed into the nostrils of Adam and
[1:09:57] he become a living Soul he just looked
[1:09:59] at me I never thought of that I said
[1:10:01] well it'd be good for you to think about
[1:10:03] it he was spending a lot of time
[1:10:05] teaching era and never looked up
[1:10:07] anything about what the truth was he
[1:10:09] just had an idea sounded good sound good
[1:10:12] see that the law was what made you think
[1:10:15] about being wrong so that's the soul no
[1:10:17] no no
[1:10:19] no the soul is the real you
[1:10:24] right let me put it this way it's the
[1:10:26] instigator of your
[1:10:28] nature is that a good way of saying it
[1:10:31] all right y that's why the prophet would
[1:10:33] call the soul being the nature of the
[1:10:36] spirit then he get over in souls in
[1:10:38] prison he said the nature of your soul
[1:10:40] is God if you're born again said if not
[1:10:42] it's of the world that's
[1:10:45] right there's a nature within each and
[1:10:48] every one of
[1:10:49] us we all are made different
[1:10:53] irregardless identical to
[1:10:56] wins you keep on you'll find out one
[1:10:58] will be a little different than the
[1:11:00] other
[1:11:01] one sister Trudy used to how the
[1:11:03] magazine years ago where that this body
[1:11:06] was still you know was two people up
[1:11:08] here but only one body down it was
[1:11:12] actually proven to be true and this body
[1:11:14] up here was split and you know and there
[1:11:18] was two
[1:11:19] heads and one of them they were girls
[1:11:22] and one of them like boys and the other
[1:11:23] one didn't
[1:11:26] cuz it's a
[1:11:28] nature see when that soul of that baby
[1:11:31] comes into that
[1:11:34] body to make it a living
[1:11:39] being then a nature will be formed
[1:11:42] around that that will display what's
[1:11:45] within there
[1:11:47] right and that's why Jesus Christ had to
[1:11:50] come and
[1:11:51] die because there was no nature and no
[1:11:53] man even the animal we know that we know
[1:11:56] it couldn't it didn't have no soul it
[1:11:58] couldn't take away those desires and the
[1:12:00] things you would just go right back and
[1:12:02] do it again right oh you could be
[1:12:05] repentant become
[1:12:07] soft-hearted but it wouldn't be long you
[1:12:09] went right back into the same
[1:12:11] things but when Jesus Christ came that
[1:12:13] was the very soul of almighty God that
[1:12:16] came down in the human flesh right to be
[1:12:19] able to release that life that it could
[1:12:21] come back into you and I and giving us
[1:12:24] eternal life right and changing the
[1:12:27] nature of our
[1:12:30] soul
[1:12:34] amen I'm looking at something that'll be
[1:12:38] 20 messages down the
[1:12:40] road of how real that
[1:12:42] is what actually happened in that new
[1:12:49] birth you say it was a Spirit come in
[1:12:51] well if it was a spirit comeing in you
[1:12:53] could be anointed one
[1:12:58] what actually happened in your New
[1:13:05] Birth come on I'm just asking
[1:13:09] questions well brother Dale this Spirit
[1:13:11] came on me and I shouted Glory
[1:13:13] Hallelujah but you could be just an
[1:13:15] anointed one that's right
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:22] right right
[1:13:26] you better consider whether that Soul
[1:13:28] you have or you are whether it came from
[1:13:31] God in the correct way
[1:13:35] right that's what your New Birth has to
[1:13:38] do with it
[1:13:39] right it's just not a predestination and
[1:13:42] a flop flop and this fell here and that
[1:13:44] fell
[1:13:47] there that nature that you
[1:13:50] have if you'd have followed that
[1:13:53] nature and a sinner look what You' have
[1:13:56] been that's
[1:13:58] right y
[1:14:01] right I know you don't like for me to
[1:14:04] talk because it exposes
[1:14:07] things but when I was a sinner I would
[1:14:10] go out and do wrong and come back and
[1:14:12] cry and weep about it and think I
[1:14:15] shouldn't have done
[1:14:20] that I wouldn't
[1:14:23] saved I wouldn't save when to come on
[1:14:25] into the Baptist church and was a deacon
[1:14:27] for almost 10 years and Sunday school
[1:14:30] teachers and directors and everything
[1:14:32] and teaching adult Sunday School classes
[1:14:34] when I
[1:14:36] left but I didn't get born again till I
[1:14:38] come in this
[1:14:40] message cuz I didn't know what it
[1:14:44] was well I got this and I got to praise
[1:14:47] God I'm not telling you you didn't I am
[1:14:51] telling you to make
[1:14:53] sure make you're calling an election
[1:14:57] sure listen the other night where the
[1:14:59] Prophet said the devil used to tell us
[1:15:02] that we're
[1:15:04] lost he said now the same devil tells
[1:15:07] you that you're
[1:15:09] saved now which one you going to listen
[1:15:12] to that's right
[1:15:15] right better make you calling an
[1:15:17] election sure but you understand what
[1:15:20] I'm getting at this a simple point then
[1:15:22] we'll pick up this afternoon more
[1:15:25] if we're created in the image of God
[1:15:27] then we have to do away with the point
[1:15:28] of just saying well God is just a spirit
[1:15:31] we got to get down to a reality a
[1:15:34] realization of who we are and what we're
[1:15:37] doing you
[1:15:40] know but we got to get down to a basis
[1:15:42] of seeing that God is
[1:15:45] real not just the thought in our mind
[1:15:48] that's right that's a teaching that
[1:15:49] there's a great teaching that that God
[1:15:52] is just the good thoughts of your mind
[1:15:54] and the devil is the bad thoughts of
[1:15:55] your mind well I'd be in problem because
[1:15:58] I stay over on the wrong
[1:16:01] side you tell me you don't I'm going to
[1:16:03] call you a
[1:16:04] liar and then you're going to get mad at
[1:16:07] me cuz I tell you the
[1:16:10] truth right I'd love to be able to come
[1:16:14] up here and say the Lord dwelt with me
[1:16:15] all this week and I had a wonderful week
[1:16:18] and I never had a wrong thought I never
[1:16:21] I'd just be lying yeah
[1:16:25] right that's right but every once in a
[1:16:28] while he does drop down and say
[1:16:30] something to me and you know yes and
[1:16:33] gives me a while to think it over and I
[1:16:36] go pray a lot about it to see whether
[1:16:38] it's right or
[1:16:39] not and then I check it out in the
[1:16:42] word to see what it is right see we've
[1:16:46] got a Bible to check it with and we got
[1:16:47] a prophet's message to tell us what that
[1:16:49] Bible says so we've got something to
[1:16:52] check with we don't have to be like the
[1:16:54] world that's got what's your opinion
[1:16:57] well that's just your
[1:16:59] opinion no opinion don't get you
[1:17:03] nowhere but reality
[1:17:06] will what do you think about
[1:17:09] God I hope you understand the point I
[1:17:12] was making what you think about God is
[1:17:14] what you think about yourself right what
[1:17:16] you think about yourself is what you're
[1:17:18] thinking about
[1:17:21] him one day realize you are something
[1:17:24] real
[1:17:30] right and you know that God loved you so
[1:17:32] much until he gave that Soul a ransom
[1:17:35] yes
[1:17:38] right he paid the price as a ransome y
[1:17:43] right he so loved us until he wanted to
[1:17:46] join himself to us in a new
[1:17:53] birth I'll say it this way but I won't
[1:17:56] say my
[1:17:57] point see then I'd consider to think
[1:18:00] about what a soul
[1:18:02] is I'd consider to think
[1:18:06] about those words the prophet used
[1:18:09] called theophany logos
[1:18:12] speech I'd consider those things as to
[1:18:15] make it more into reality than into just
[1:18:20] thinking it might help us to understand
[1:18:23] who we really are
[1:18:27] you don't ever W wake up into night and
[1:18:29] just wonder well Lord who am
[1:18:32] I
[1:18:34] amen why did you choose me you don't
[1:18:37] never think that way amen you don't
[1:18:39] never think about why did you choose me
[1:18:44] amen that's right when you think about
[1:18:46] people that are so much greater and more
[1:18:48] marvelous in their lives and their
[1:18:50] doings and things you know but you think
[1:18:53] about what he didn't call them
[1:18:58] right yes Lord isn't it a statement
[1:19:01] there that many are the flaws of the
[1:19:03] ones that are chosen of
[1:19:07] God you look at the chosen of God and
[1:19:09] you don't find any of them that doesn't
[1:19:10] have
[1:19:14] flaws
[1:19:16] right name one it doesn't have a
[1:19:20] flaw well look at B yeah he was a
[1:19:23] murderer consenting to the the death of
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:26] people whatever you want who you want to
[1:19:28] name you're going to find out you're
[1:19:29] running in a
[1:19:30] hole you can't find out anything in this
[1:19:33] world is worth anything amen and why
[1:19:36] would God die for you and I amen thank
[1:19:40] you
[1:19:44] Lord why would he give his life that it
[1:19:47] could come into you and I
[1:19:51] amen and like I tried to explain it the
[1:19:53] other day you know for a little
[1:19:55] bit see we think of God like brother Mo
[1:19:59] used to describe him like a you got an
[1:20:01] apple pie and you cut it up you give
[1:20:04] away the pieces and you don't have no
[1:20:06] more pie left that's what we think about
[1:20:08] God
[1:20:11] but each piece that he cuts off goes out
[1:20:14] and multiplies into many many more we're
[1:20:18] in the expanding of
[1:20:20] God instead of the doing away with God
[1:20:23] that's right and expanding means you and
[1:20:26] I are his
[1:20:30] offspring we're his children amen that's
[1:20:34] what he's done for us come on Brothers
[1:20:37] amen think on these
[1:20:41] things is God
[1:20:43] real how real are
[1:20:48] you sometimes you sit down and think
[1:20:51] about that so you know brother Dale told
[1:20:53] me to Lord Let's help me just sit down
[1:20:55] here and think about it what am
[1:21:01] I I'm a body spirit and a soul right I'm
[1:21:06] created in the image of my father
[1:21:09] amen and you know when he was here on
[1:21:15] Earth that soul and that Spirit of
[1:21:17] almighty God lived in a
[1:21:20] body that we call Jesus right
[1:21:28] he said Philip have I been so long with
[1:21:31] you if youve seen me he said you've seen
[1:21:33] the father you know why because there in
[1:21:38] that human body that we call Jesus was
[1:21:42] the very nature that's
[1:21:45] it amen of almighty
[1:21:49] God he wasn't a son that was just done
[1:21:52] this or done that no he was the very
[1:21:54] nature of almighty God Amen and that
[1:21:58] body was very Soul and Spirit of
[1:22:00] almighty God
[1:22:02] Amen the Eternal godhead
[1:22:07] right to be able to be seen by the
[1:22:09] things we look at walk outside after a
[1:22:12] while and you'll look and see that even
[1:22:14] though it's right in the winter time and
[1:22:16] everything so bad you look around you'll
[1:22:18] find some green
[1:22:21] grass you'll find some Pine Tre trees
[1:22:25] that still have
[1:22:27] green thistle needles on them you find a
[1:22:31] lot of things amen that let you know
[1:22:34] about God am then if you fool around and
[1:22:36] mess up enough and turn around you might
[1:22:39] look at somebody and see God standing
[1:22:42] looking at you am amen amen you look at
[1:22:47] these little children these little
[1:22:49] babies

[1:22:57] sinceri and
[1:23:00] things and just remember
[1:23:04] then they are given to
