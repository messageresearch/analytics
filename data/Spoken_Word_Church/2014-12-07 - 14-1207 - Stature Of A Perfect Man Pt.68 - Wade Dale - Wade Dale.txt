TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know something else Proverbs is next so we just may continue right in The Book of Proverbs from her breeding now we've been talking on his tactical project man obviously for six this is now number 69. and um we have uh Richard is not working hello hello hello hello hello he had it working but it's not working now so anyway Richard came down here and fixed the thing and had it working and we both saw it it was working and now it's not so Richard walked out of the room that's probably why so we have been talking about the Statue of a perfect man now for a long time and we're we're not coming to a close but we're gonna come to a pause Maybe thank you because I you know like I was telling you um starting the first Sunday in January I'm going to be taking both Services through the month of January and into February so and then the first weekend in February we're going to be at brother Joe Greene so you'll be doing Sunday school the whole month of January so if they don't like you you're going to really prove it but you'll have the whole month of January and then then after that of course I'm going to Philippines for three weeks so the rest of you will get to fill in so be prepared and be ready that we want to go back to where we were and get my history up here because we were going through a bunch of stuff last night and I keep uh tagging my history and I got to get back down here to where we were gonna be reading that I'll be reading that everyone living I tagged a lot of things we start talking about stuff and I'll tag it and then we can go back see if we start talking about under the blood so you can mark it and there you are you're right back to what you need to this is the neat app so maybe you don't have it you need to get it it's free but it's a It's a Wonderful tool last night we were talking about free moral agent we were talking about representation and I was looking up the quote where Adam took Eve to himself and I couldn't find it because you've got to put in the the right thing it's not the person uh your soul was black you're born between Satan and need you can really look up a lot of things real quick to uh there it is to uh like last night in the Bible study we were talking about certain things and you could pull the quote up where brother Brown said it just like that and kind of kind of reiterate what's going on so here we are on the Statue of perfect man right here on this one this is the one-on-one right here at Broly kind of stand the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ and the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the true baptism I know we've stayed on that a long time but what I want us to see and we're going to do some more of that upstairs in in January with the whole congregation but the most important thing is the new birth knowing that you're born again knowing that God can even start putting these virtues in your life for those of you that weren't at the Bible Study last night that's what brother Dale's been that's his concern is that we may just be in sanctification all these years or we may just have a sensation that I've been in the message and I can see look like I said before at 14 years old I could tell you what serpent seed was I could explain to you what happened in the garden Through the Bible and I wasn't even born again that's just the ability to read we have a lot of people in this message that just have the ability to read because their life don't prove it they don't come to church half the time they don't do the things to the Lord all the time then you know it's the life is what's going to show because you can take as brother Brandon used the illustration in Blasphemous names about the the peacock with or the crow with the peacock feather stuck in it it's going to look like a peacock sometime but those feathers are going to get shook out one day and you're going to show your true colors what I want to do is I want us to I'm not I'm going to read them off the Capstone because we got to come here first well if we if we if we don't come to here let's let's just say for Surety you want to understand what the seals are you want to understand what those things are the true when I say the true message of brother Brown that doesn't mean that part of it was false but brother Brown came to do one thing or two things actually but one thing he came to specifically do that no man had ever done before is to bring this down to a group of people which is the seals the Thunders and the things of God that no man has ever looked at before right here man there's been many men come to this right here many men First Church age was full of these Brethren and sisters okay full of brothers and sisters they had all these working in their life so brother Branham did not come to bring us the Statue of a perfect man it's always been there he come to bring us the completion of the Statue of the perfect man because remember the Bible says The Headstone was rejected all right so if the headstone was rejected then that's all they had if the headstone was rejected they didn't it's just like the natural pyramid doesn't have a cap on it yeah right why does it have a cap on it because it's a type of right your journey so you and I must have these virtues working in our life and then the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost Christ and the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the true baptism of Holy Ghost and you get all these virtues sealed in you that says sealed in you it doesn't say it gives them to you read that you already got them right that Holy Ghost doesn't give you the virtue but it is the same holy ghost that gives you the virtue but at this stage or at this stage of development that Holy Spirit is sealing the virtues in it's making sure that that vessel will work and it'll work for God not for man all right so that's why he says see he says in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost not that this one's false but this one up here is more of the same one that gave you the virtues but this one doesn't come to give you any more virtue it comes to seal in what you have and you get all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building now he lived in it down here but remember he lived in it in the park that you let him live in and it's a seed plant that's right everything well this is you don't you can't plant up here all right you don't plant the seed in the air and it grows from seed to stalk I mean seed to stalk to leaf yeah she's planted here's your roots because that's your foundation just like a big tree it's got a big wide Foundation and then it grows up then what happens is all the fruit is where not Naruto it was at one time it was in the sea the root at one time as we're all that's what's so profound about nature I've got apple trees that apple tree comes from one seed but now out of that one seed that we planted in the ground or a man did we bought it when it was about this high hundreds of apples have come from that that has seed in it that if you plant it in the ground it'll bring forth another several hundred same thing with God that's the spiritual multiplication of God is remember it's not seized as of many but one seed which is Christ right so out of that one seed comes a many membered body now we got people in the body Wesley Luther Columbus Martin irenius and Paul and then this age Wesley and all those in here and they got to a certain part of this but they could not attain to this part of the cap coming down because when Jesus was walking on the Earth it was the whole pyramid the whole every bit of that pyramid there was nothing now when he was rejected man cut him off in that way said the Bible said he was rejected he was a rejected Stone in other words the stone was cut off so man couldn't attain to that right at that time everybody okay with that when he died and went to heaven The Headstone went with it he was The Headstone he was the head of the church all right and um like we were talking about last night we'll talk about the seed dolphins and um it just came to me that if if see Jesus was standing on Earth in his body and the little one at the well was standing there well now if he would imparted eternal life and I know what brother Brown said but you got to remember what he said but if he imparted he Colonel life to that woman standing there as the new birth that's two bodies standing there and you can't have that I don't know if anybody got that last night or not but you should understood that there's no way because remember Jesus breathed on her disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost well now they didn't get the Holy Ghost because he was the body If he if they would received the Holy Ghost they would have become his body right right exactly right so he had to go up though and send that Holy Ghost down to make them the body of Christ right so he was gone the world will see me no more but you'll see me in other words you're going to see me inside of you you're not going to see me physically because brother Branham explains many times that brother Brown can't um that Jesus Christ can't come back to this earth until the Millennium that's when all of his bodies together again that's when everything's done and redemption's over for the Gentiles and for the Jews you understand what I'm saying when you come back in the Millennium the the Redemption is over for the Gentiles of Jews I didn't say redemption was over because he's still Redeeming the foolish version at the white Throne he's given people eternal life so he's still redeeming right up to the Future home coming down and to me see the future home is the type of that where's it coming down it's coming down on the Earth all right the future home is coming down to me this is the future home that is the future home that's where everything lays is in that Capstone message so what we've got to do is though is with this year coming up if you want to make a New Year's resolution make this one that you're going to be standing right here by the end of the year and the virtues are going to be working in your life not trying to find them that's right all right and that's for all of us we all need to have this before we can even understand this that's why I don't that's why many people I believe in the message have false Doctrine is because they're presuming they're venturing without Authority that's what presuming is venturing without the so they're venturing way up here and maybe some of them have not even here yet you can't you can't teach a false Doctrine and be here that's right now you might could teach a false Doctrine when you're just born again and you're getting started as a baby because babies make mistakes hey how many of you kids said something that they weren't supposed to right same way with you and I you know you hear the old kids say something you go where'd that come from we'd see that that's just that's the growth development of the child same way with here you might say a few things but you know what once the true words presented to you you will turn from that because you'll have what you'll do is you'll receive virtue from whoever that was that's delivering it to you so we're going to break that down a little bit more when we do it upstairs with the whole congregation that virtue that strength has to come from a Spirit-filled person that's not just a baby in Christ because babies put five babies in this room leave them alone and come back five years later you'll have a problem right because this Baby's teaching babies babies do baby things right so you gotta have an adult there to lead those children up into adulthood same way with God God raises his kids the same way you raise yours it's just that he don't make mistakes when we do all right but as we come up through here that's virtue coming from someone you must get the correct knowledge they've got to have Temperance and patience with us with us as congregation got to have godliness and brotherly kindness you've got to have all those things working because I can't I can't tell you about virtue if I don't have it and virtue has to be something that's comes out that you pull from the minister upstairs you pull that virtue if he don't have anything you know what you're going to do you're going to sit there just like we do and we hear a false Doctrine upstairs watch something happen something clicks or something rings in your heart it's not really a true virtue right that's right I'm certain you're right you're tuned to certain things your tune to a certain thing and you're hearing you're hearing you're hearing all of a sudden boing and you know what you do you know you and your thought Hey listen we're humans and we're sitting there listening and then all of a sudden something comes forth that we have not been taught that maybe is not correct or even that we don't understand now see there's a difference between that that's right I've sat and listened to people that I didn't understand yeah yeah but you got to stay open enough that's right to listen consider the end of the conversation right but then there's people that sit there that you're on the line you're listening you're listening and all of a sudden he said all right there's a difference in that there's a difference because with the way you're taught is you come up to a certain place and you're drawing virtue sure you can draw Hey listen they drew a certain amount of virtue from Judas his character sure they I said a certain amount I didn't say Godly because it wasn't boring it I said but they drew certain amount of virtue from Judas because Judas preached the gospel and people got healed people got saved or not saved but come to the to the word of the hour right everybody understand that so Judas did have Judas was in tight was justified and Sanctified right joining even in a Sanctified condition that's why the anointed ones at the end time is so hard to see but it's really easy to see once you see it that they are here they're not coming they're here and they've been here since this first church age I know anyone's attend time is us but there have been anointed ones Paul said Grievous wool they've come among you and are now here he said but what brother random has done he has come to restore that bring that back up but then bring a message that no one else brought except the man that was standing here with the headstone Jesus Christ he was standing here with that anointing on him because he was the son of man all right so you get to the son of man Ministry this is the son of man Ministry this is the Son of God Ministry everybody okay with that yes yes this is the Son of God Ministry this is God in spirit form in a human being doing the work just like he did on the day of Pentecost Son of God this is the son of man Ministry but I want you to I want you to take this one point though if Paul was a holy ghost filled person and he had the Son of God living in him that was God in human flesh what is the son of man the son of man never left the Earth it just was hidden from man it was even hidden from Paul because he didn't come to the position but now that we've come up to here and we can look back down through here you see that is the Son of God Ministry but it was God in human flesh working through group people so it was the son of man Ministry the whole time yes they just was he just wasn't revealed brother remember said to be revealed now look to reveal something is not putting something together and then saying here it is now to reveal something it's there all the time that's right anybody got that it was here all the time right it just had to be made known or had to be revealed the seals listen Jesus preached the seals in Matthew 24 right but who knew that even Paul didn't know it but see it wasn't time for The Headstone Ministry to come it couldn't come down here right it had to come there had to be a bribe tree there had to be the tree eat down restored back and then the headstones come down everybody understand that right Paul couldn't preach the son of man Ministry like brother brownham preached it and put all this together now Paul was a pattern messenger right Paul was a prophet he was a patterned messenger he was the one you patterned everything by but he wasn't given the uh Revelations 10 7. in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished now Paul didn't finish that mystery Paul says in the Bible I finished the mystery in which I am called I think we read that last night Paul finished the ministry he was called for which was not the son of man ministry that's right all right so did Irene it's Martin Columbus Luther Wesley but when we come to this age the first part of Malachi 4 was the son of God of ministry from 1947 to 1963 was the son of God restoring the gifts back restoring and to me when I say gifts the first thing you think of is what being in tongues there's nine spiritual gifts those two are the least of the two of the nine there is these spiritual gifts that we must have in our church working to be a strong church that's why Ephesus was a strong Church there was 12 people but those 12 people were full of the Holy Ghost and had these virtues working in their life okay not to say they probably didn't have any problems but you know what they had a lot less problems all right because of that son of man I mean that Son of God Ministry being in their life all right so the Son of God Ministry down through seven churches brother around him say he died son of man raised Son of God why did he die son of man because that was the word in flesh that's right all right yes he raised back up the word in flesh but when he come back on the day of Pentecost he didn't bring his flesh back that's right that's right okay he didn't bring his flesh but his flesh didn't come back he sent back the Holy Ghost equipping the Flesh of the people that was on the Earth yeah so anyway he didn't send his place right that's why that's why the Holy Ghost couldn't be given while Jesus was still in the Earth that they'd be two bodies that's right yes it'd be two bodies it'd be Jesus and his own body right here on the earth same time now Heidi you say well that's going to happen in the Millennium that's when everything's over that's when all Redemption is over that's why the soul of man cannot have anything in it but sin and and death and sorrow until Jesus comes that's right and redeems that soul if any Soul that's standing on this Earth had Jesus in them that was two bodies and there's no way that can happen Jesus died son of man that flesh died but it raised back up the Son of God which is Spirit God is the one that went to hell and preached to those people there who else right Jesus says flesh didn't go to hell this is flesh stayed up here that's a sacrifice it stays in the Tomb right here but the soul went to hell preached to the people down here all right son of God he said I'm the Son of God I'm the one you turned down then he comes back and picks that body up quickens it all power and Heaven on Earth been given unto me so he had control over the Flesh and and in spirit how many Soul had control over the flesh at that time he said well they had control later no he said not my will but thy will there was a factor in there that he was human when he was here though it was almighty God there was a factor that he could be tempted and all these things when he come back up out of that grave he could not be tempted he was done finished and over with he was the almighty the one that stood before the foundation of the world he had just picked up a body of Flesh that he was supposed to have had there not been a fall he had to come down here get a body of Flesh take it back up glorified send back the Holy Ghost into a group of people then now that's God in human flesh on the Earth but the understanding was the son of God God Spirit God that's why Paul never called him son of man Irene has never called him son of man they didn't understand that that sure they said well I've got it Paul said I'm God in human flesh that's what he's telling us you'll be judged by my gospel if an angel comes from Heaven preaches anything besides what I preach let him be a curse so what was Paul saying whatever God was was standing right there in Paul speaking to those people but he never had the understanding see brother Brown then comes and God gives him the understanding 63-65 gives him the understands that hey that's me standing there in human flesh in yeah and that's what's going to change those people that's the only thing that's what couldn't change Paul Irene is because remember let me get this right the son of God is not commissioned to change your body until the end time right right that's right because Why didn't it change Paul's body down here when the Son of God entered in when he received a new birth the commission was just for remember I will restore you say Joel Joel is what kept me from doing I will restore what's that brother absolutely it wasn't all fulfilling Paul Paul never spoke of the son of man as Jesus spoke of himself but he did speak to Jesus in the pure form for that day but you keep coming up coming up the word was eat down word was being restored and it comes back up to Malachi 4. turn the hearts of the babies children to the fathers back here brother Brown had to bring them back to that Foundation he said you lettering people he said you think you've had the latter rain which is up here which is the Harvest drink you you think they think you you think you've had that rain he said you've never had the former ring first which is the teaching or the planting right here he had to get everybody back to right here then he could work them up right and it took 50 years after he's been dead for us to just begin to realize we need to amen after he died 50 years after he died to realize that that was not just a good sermon in Priest yeah it's like a brother said and I really enjoyed it and I think I mentioned it the other day brother brother Mike Ortiz I tried to you know bring it in a little bit but it's the centerpiece but you've got a table full of food but what does that centerpiece do that Center piece draws your attention to what's on the table right right and it draws it into the center of the table to me brother made a good point he said this is the center of the message that's right because of you and I'm going to try to draw that I'm going to try to do that and we're going to try to do it upstairs on the screen to bring us up because that's got to be the centerpiece before you get SEALS or chains of the body or son of man Ministry or anything over here that's got to be your Center focus that's right it's right there to me that's the hinge that's the hinge Point we've got people working down in here and that's fine and okay but brother Brown said God will have a mature Church a mature this is a mature church this is not but we got to go on beyond the mature Church part right Ephesus was a mature Church because they had all these working in their life yes but they didn't have this this was rejected this was left off the body wasn't complete there has to be a group of people that that Divine love has to come down on and that is adoption remember we see we we receive in Romans 8 we receive the spirit of adoption right whereby we cry daddy day our father father we don't receive adoption there there's a process that goes through that I was like the analogy we used with the the kids with the car now the kids got all the faculties that he needs he's a human you got a brain he's got arms he's got legs he's got eyes he's got an ear if you can see you can smell but why don't you give a five-year-old car the keys to your car he's not mature enough he's not mature enough to be able to handle the situation same thing with these virtues if you're not mature enough God's not going to give them to you so you've got a mature as God adds them to you on the way up through your journey and remember it's life and godliness so it's your life that you live bless the godliness that you show right that's true yes sir well it's not like it's not like uh you're pushing yourself into these things like I got to get some some virtue yeah you know so okay I got about you all right now you know and uh and that's how it kind of makes it makes you feel like you know that you can't right but I like what you just said that that you know God knows when you're mature enough to come to the next point and it's not like a like I said I've never liked these lines but it is lines there for a reference because it's not like you're gonna fill a tank up and you're gonna say well now brother Luis you got to buy a quarter tank of virtue there you need you know no no that's that to me they ought to turn them this way virtue goes all the way up and always goes all the way up Temperance you don't you don't get virtue and then say well I've done that you know Anna Anna is almost a doctorate got a doctorate degree now she can't she's not going to lay down what she learned in kindergarten no that's the foundation she's built upon all that to get those degrees same way with this like brother Brown said he said you try to jump up here he said you'll fall right that's right don't try to jump up here I've always said God will show you where you at at any time he'll make one thing happen and listen if you fail one time with God one time you know one thing for sure you don't have it that's right one time now God's gracious he'll give you some time but still there'll be one point you'll say I don't have that no more I don't have that awful feeling I have toward people or that awful this or that that or that you know Temperance I got a lot more Temperance I got one more patience okay Lord I'm becoming more like you you've shown me that I'm becoming more like you I'm doing the things of God instead of doing the things of the world so there's somewhere in there that you're going to know because God's obligated to tell you yes see just like just like the world I'm gonna make this point and then we gotta go the world says that when uh ibigen reaches 16 years old according to the books and according to history and according to uh you know doc they build it on all kind of things she can drive a car at 16 she has come to a point well now how did that come to man just didn't say well 16 is a good number we'll just no there's something that goes with that there's there's um research there's there's research and development statistics there's statistics what I'm looking for thank you there was their statistics well you know where your statistics are right there right here this is your statistics sheet brother Brampton when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues impersonate any gift God has you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when these virtues grow in so it's a growth development grow in and you added that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving item not a motionless person all right any questions Maybe this is a thing I mean when you have a set of page too there you go thinking of the event that's right you bring you understand that yeah you bring this is Christmas time so we have a theme we have a centerpiece that brings the theme of the event in well the theme of the event to get this thing right here and I call it a thing I'm sorry but this this headstone to come on this church this living it don't come on dead people comes on live people so it's got to come on the people that are alive you've got to see that that centerpiece has brought you to the the theme of this whole thing is it's getting the virtues then God can give us The Headstone which is the seal for the body change that's what the seals were given for was a change of this body there's not been a requirement in any other age but this one to have our body change while we're still alive everybody else had just enough word to get them in the grave and get them out of the grave in 63 brother Brown was the only man that had that right absolutely he was the only man him and Jesus Christ are the only two men that we know for a fact had it at that time in 63 up until 65 but Jim remember too he died last night you can be baptized you'll do this you'll do this I promise right if you've got to get these promises down here first or you can't that's the jumping up the ladder brother rush things and jump up three rounds to fall off the future
