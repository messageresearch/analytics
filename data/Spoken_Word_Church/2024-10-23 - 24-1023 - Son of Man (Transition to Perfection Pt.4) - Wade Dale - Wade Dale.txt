technology technology I told a little guy yesterday he was trying to ring me up at Walmart and we were at the uh in the pharmacy and we've got a card on file so every time we go there we just get our prescriptions put the card on file blah blah blah he couldn't find it I said okay you can't find it he said no sir I can't find it and I said okay look some more it's in there somewhere I mean I had 98 cents but I was wanted to put that on that card he said well you know sometimes it's it's um sometimes it's these Electronics I said them Electronics only do what you punch it's usually human error his face got red but I can't get this thing to move Josh yes that's exactly right that's why I wasn't going to say anything till right now we're going to reboot it we'll start over all right good to be in the house of the Lord just uh just pray for each and everyone uh the relief effort that's going on in um at brother Barry's and at brother um Donnie Reagan they not taking anything else they're done they've got plenty to uh for right now so maybe they need something later but for right now they've got plenty so um I appreciate all of your prayers I appre and I know they do appreciate everything that you done all the money you give brother Boyd and them and different ones taking things up there and um I know I'm punching it pretty hard aren't I why is it not doing it with my fingers boo devil everything's normal for this weekend it's still not moving um brother Luis will be speaking for us next Wednesday uh brother Aaron this weekend will be in Ohio uh with the group up there we sure do appreciate them love them with the love of the Lord and they they always send us greetings and always um send us accolades about all the things that our brothers are preaching here and we sure appreciate them um I appreciate their support and uh we support them also um remember the church dinners coming up in November the 17th it will be here the signup sheets downstairs so remember that other than that I think we're good you love the Lord in the eyes of God every step you take is a step closer to your purpose God never saw anything negative oh he hears he he see things through different different Avenues but for us that Genesis 1 126 man is going to stay the way he thought of it cuz that's what we're heading back to and I appreciate the Lord for uh giving us Grace as sister was was singing there I appreciate the gra Grace that God give us to be able to get back to him and that we have a message of the hour that that Luther had a message of the hour Wesley had a message of the hour Pentecost had a message of the hour all down Through the Ages but they never had one that says this is the end this is it for the Gentiles this is the last Gentile dispensation there's nothing else left for us and if that doesn't make you happy then you need to get to the altar because we're heading towards something way better than this we're heading towards something way better than this world and whatever it has like somebody said the other day this no nobody's going to dig us out nobody's going to make us better on this world in this earth I thinking today you know you um you see all these relief efforts and you know every once in a while there'll be a scammer show up and scam somebody out of something amen feed them a scam sandwich right but I'll promise you Word of Life Church and Bible Believers in uh in Hickory that ain't going to happen they never saw a more perfect group of people than they now they may make human mistakes but I was thinking today there's always scammers you always hear people scamming people out of money those people will never in their life ever scam anybody out of anything that's what God does when he goes inside here he takes care of all that worldly stuff and US wanting to have an angle to get by with something they had a they had two groups of people up there that were just Angels taking care of people that were humans and they're still taking care of them and still still U um regretfully finding bodies and and all that but just just keep them in prayer and uh ask a blessing on on the efforts that they're doing so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this evening Lord middle of the week Lord we've come to a place to where we want to talk about you for just a minute Lord so I pray that you'd move us out of the way and you do the speaking Lord if there be any sick among us may you heal them Father there be any sin sick Lord may you come to their heart Lord and prick their heart Lord as you did on the day of Pentecost to the group of people Lord that received you Lord father I pray that you'd bless the little bride around the world Lord be with the group there in Ohio Lord be with brother Aaron going up there Lord and ministering for them Father that little group up there Lord that we appreciate so much father we ask you just be with us now continue with us in this service in Jesus name amen I don't know what it's doing John just locked up turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you blessings it's Lage and I rebooted it so I can do it that way oh that's going to be tedious why that show up like that let's turn on the pre-service music and um let's have a time of solid reflection while we get this technology together h no I'm going to go do this thing this thing right here works oh take that back in and see what you can do with it all right good to be in the house of the Lord sorry about that well uh okay all righty then we're good all right let's read our scripture here me get this thing up here there we go fire me up Revelations 3:14 thank you Josh Revelation 3:14 unto the angel the Church of the L ofan right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that there are neither cold or hot I would thou were cold or hot God wants us to be one of the other he does not want us to be wishy washy right in the middle lukewarm willy-nilly all that stuff he wants us to be one of the two he wishes that we were one of the two all right so then because they lukew because what lukew says well I'm fine I'm lukewarm I'm okay I'm not too hot I'm not too cold I'm comfortable like some of y'all in here today you're comfortable so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and as I said before 22 million millionaires just in the United States and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich what richness are we looking for we're not looking for the richness of the world we're looking for the richness that Jesus promised us to have even on this side right and white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see we're going to be the only group of people though that really see see who Jesus Christ is the world can't they can pick at it they can look at it it's like Paul they look through a glass Darkly they think they know who Jesus is they know he died on a cross or some do and then they can't get him in their heart though to where he can work his way back out behold I stand at the door as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hears my voice and opens the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant in other words God now to him that overcometh will I who's speaking here Jesus Christ remember he's one is speaking this is all in red letter he's speaking to John on the aisle of patmas hisself all right to him that overcometh will I grant that Grant is something he's going to give he's going to give us something it's a gift that he's going to give us and remember as we said many times before well a long time ago that this this age is the worst age there ever is Right ever has been but it's the most intimate age with Jesus Christ that ever has been hello cuz it we can sit in not on in none of the other ones now you can get you'll get a stone and you'll get a this and you'll be in the temple of God and you'll know this and you'll know that no where it so intimate is that we're going to overcome and we're going to be absolutely right there with him as we were speaking Sunday about she is him we know she is him and we get to sit on that throne but he's the one that sits now watch he's the one that sits where on my father's Throne so there we're all there together now we have the true Revelation to one God no one else does all right the true Revelation to one God you got Jesus only you got different ones but this is the and what is a throne a throne is a Dominion it shows that you have dominion over something so Jesus Christ he got dominion over the devil right it's going to make come to a realization we are that we are the same as she is him that we going to get the same thing body change and everything just like him so he that hit in ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches you may be seated the Lord that His blessings of the reading of the word 1 Corinthians 13:8 says charity never faileth but whether there'll be prophecies they will fail you we're talking about this transition to Perfection whether there'll be tongues they will cease whether they be knowledge it'll vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part Paul being a prophet he could see things but he couldn't understand them brother Bram saw things that he didn't understand come on people brother Bram said God don't always tell prophets everything right all right but he tells us what's pertinent through a prophet he tells us what's pertinent to us all right all those people that that you know brother R told me this and that's a secret he told me and didn't tell somebody else well that may be for you but that's not for me buddy the 1100 sermons is when God was speaking to me all right I don't want no private Revelation that brother random whispered in your ear he wasn't that way that's right for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come or that which is complete or that which is made manifest is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but how when I became a man there's somewhere he had to be from a child to a man so he had to come and he had to grow to that is everybody with me for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the Great of this is what the headstone or charity or that thing says love that is agape love and that's what we're coming to the world cannot come to Agape Love without the new birth you can't have agape love agape love you have FAL love it gets all mixed in together and and Satan loves filo love he's about the author of fio love yeah he's the one that started in the garden everybody with me all right that FAL love is not in God's mind now God knew about it but toap love is God's perfect love that's that Genesis 1:26 man we've been talking about forever and ever and ever we're going to see that that whole thing everything when you say Genesis 1:26 you read that scripture that incompasses everything God wanted to do from the beginning and it will culminate because he said be blessed have dominion do this multiply and replenish he tells us what to do and subdue the world and we're going to do that that all it's all wrapped up in at Genesis 126 man and I believe we are understanding it more than we than we ever have before you know why because it's inside of you saying I'm him I'm it this is it this is what I am I am that Genesis 126 person being made manifest in its last form in its last form this is the last form uh brother Ryan he sent me a bunch of scriptures the other day and some I had and some I didn't have about the end time but man you look at all those scriptures and you say wow no wonder we're no wonder we can identify where we're at cuz the whole Bible speaks of here the whole Bible speaks of Christ living on the earth with a group of people that's his children and ruling and reigning over the 12 tribes of Israel and being us being Kings and Priests over the whole world everybody with me right and that's what we're going to do very shortly but we got to have dominion over this guy first and I believe that's what the prophet brought us the the ability he brought us the Revelation to come to that Perfection because if he didn't somebody else has got to come if it not him we got to find somebody else but I believe it's him and I believe he gave us everything we needed we just got to keep digging and digging and digging and polishing and smoothing and and and uh strive we just got to strive We Can't Stop we can't quit for no I mean if everybody falls around you keep going if everybody denies this message keep going cuz I'll promise you it'll take you to a body change am I promise you that we which are alive and remain could be sitting here in this building right now being the very scripture made manifest that Paul was talking about if we believe that right so here we are at the end of the we had a holy ghost we had a Pentecostal age brother Brown came at the end of the Pentecostal age as elij bringing the Elijah anointing and then he brought two things and we're going to look at at something today that that uh that I've been studying on for a little bit so I got a little bit of that together but cuz brother Bram tells us he says we can't measure on a minor all right so brother brandham came his first part of his ministry was a minor don't get quiet on me it was a minor divine healing is a minor it will not change your body Divine Healing will heal you may make you feel better but brother random said you could have cancer be healed and die tomorrow the same thing and be totally healed and it's part of the atonement you can't take it out but come on why why are we still majoring on a minor why we still looking for for people to speak in tongues and and long prayer lines and you know people getting healed and and that's fine there's nothing wrong with it but you can't major on a minor and I'll read this in just a minute where brother R said that but we're right to the end now we're at the end of these Church ages we're getting ready to usher in the age of the of the Jews right just close by talking to Brother Richard Wilson different ones brother Jimmy Harris yesterday and it's just it's just something that that we're all looking for we're all looking for that we're looking for that culmination not 10 years from now 5 years from now 3 years from now but coming up this year is going to change a lot this election is going to change a lot of things and people and then it's going to be just a very short time before we get out of here but you remember one thing once we start manifesting the son of man Ministry once we start manifesting the son of man they're going to hate us just like they hated him they're going to persecute us just like they persecuted him they're going to tell you your faults just like they told him he was false and he was God Almighty in human flesh and they turned him down so bad just like brother randam they turned him down in the last part of his ministry he preached to 30 people in a in a trailer out in Arizona somewhere over that way all right he'd been preaching to 200,000 people why that was his Healing Ministry they couldn't get out of that heal they couldn't get out of the prayer line I'm sorry they just couldn't get out of the prayer line amen now never never never will I say we don't need prayer lines but we got to quit majoring where we have all all these meetings and they M they put it all on that last prayer line give me some word give me some word give me something to make me where I don't need to be in that prayer line again like I said before give me a give me a true Minister and I fail miserably too but give me a true Pastor that'll stand behind the pull pet and we'll be able to pray for you instead of having to go somewhere to be prayed for I just believe that folks it's just too much minor too much minor going on stuck in a wheel and you know what Satan loves that as long as we stay right here he's fine Brother B told Pentecostals you stayed right here God moved on that's right but Pentecost was good there's nothing wrong with it and listen you can't take laying off the hands laying on the hands out of the Bible because it's part of the atonement if you need it absolutely if you don't need it do what the Gentiles just believe believe in your heart let God transform you sitting where you're at instead of having having emotion and a feeling what are you going to do when you can't find somebody when you have to call on God yourself with no emotion or maybe you're just in a in a pickle and you you can't know where to go but up I've been there before it's not fun but it's great when God comes down and speaks to your heart and takes you out of it right we must suffer persecution we must suffer that we can Reign now brother R told us that right so on the day of Pentecost which is the isua street this is modern times it was under the man anointing they had partial Revelation because they had partial revelation God could not Rapture them all the ages had partial Revelation now the first age had full Revelation but that corn of wheat had to go the ground according to the Bible am so that you and I could come forth thank God they didn't take a Rapture in the first church age thank God they didn't take it in the second Church age but believe you me the Antichrist was there working already Satan is never far away folks don't think we've got him whipped and he he went that direction and we did the Bob and weave and we over here no he's probably standing there waiting on you to make it he's a true adversary but he's defeated questions and answers 1963 oh I really appreciate y'all being uh patient for me with me Sunday we're going to try to cut that down a little bit and not be so long but I enjoy doing questions and answers and some of you did too the ones you didn't say am man didn't it's just not too it's not very long it's not bad I like questions and answers though and it settles people's mind that's why brother rown said a strong church is a church that asks questions cuz if you said sit there with questions in your mind you know what you're doing you're you're sitting there asking the question over and over in your mind and you're not hearing what I'm saying let's get that question answer then there might be another one we just keep going on and on so right here in 1963 in questions and answers on the seals brother M tells us specifically there is no Messenger to that age that the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism now that was to what bring back the gifts of God they had been done away with in the Dark Ages they had been done Away by the Catholics Luther come in and brought some things in Wesley came in and brought some things in Pentecost is now going to restore the gifts so that God can send us a prophet so that people can understand who he is and what he's what's going on all right but it's at the end of the age as always ends up a messenger is sent and all these Scruples and things will be placed in their place which we know that brother R speaking this and he he pretty much at this time is at the first seal no question on the seals he's already preached six seals he pretty much understands now what he's doing I believe he does I believe he understands that he's the messenger and there's a message and there's a group of people but that group of people's not here that group of people's coming which is US am cuz listen God can't Rapture something that's not perfect or he would have already raptured somebody else there's a place we got to come to that God's going to Rapture a group of people because they come to the completeness that he saw before the foundation of the world right so he had to he had to send us a message how's the Baptist going to make it saying that you just get a letter and once saved always saved you know you get saved at 9 years old you don't go back to church till you're 40 or 50 and you die at 60 I've been to many Baptist funerals and I know the people they didn't never go to church a day in their life but at N 9 years old they got saved signed a letter once saved always saved now once Born Again always born again but I don't I don't believe that you can get saved and then not show up at church so how's God going but now listen how's God that's not in the word of God that's their interpretation God is not going to Rapture interpretation that's wrong right right he had to send a prophet that had what divine interpretation that had that knew exactly the mind it wasn't it wasn't three or four or five denominations coming down and then brother no it was brother R God spoke to brother R and said this is that send him an angel said I'm an angel sent from God and this is what you're to do what a mighty God we serve and that word is transformed into me and you so the gifts were restored 1 Corinthians 12 which is wisdom knowledge Faith healing Miracles I love these twoo I the speaking in tongues is okay okay but I like I like to have the knowledge of the word of God and people to have faith and people to be healed and there be Miracles we've seen all these things amen right right but that's the minor the tongues and interpretations is the into the into the uh prayer line and it's discernment but it's the minor right now then there's these other gifts that come into the church now after the pastor then there's evangelist comes in then there's teachers prophets then there's Apostles all things together working together with the gifts now watch to keep the church perfected not a tape not a book right a Ministry a five-fold Ministry to keep the church clean to keep the church straight to keep the sheep in the right Sheepfold all right eating the right grass right and being protected by the right Shepherd keeps the church perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord like I said before he's going to come after a group of people without what spot or wrinkle now he's going to have to do it all right we can't do that but through the word we've got to be able to put our faith back into the word of God listen the same Faith you got today that when you got born again ever how many years ago use that same faith for whatever you need now cuz it brought God on the scene over here it brought something over here to you that you didn't have let's have have that same Faith let's go back and we can go back to that childlike Faith but we can't stay there we can't start walking and then go back and crawl but we can't go back and say God right here's where I met you at right here's where I got something from you this is the scripture this is my scripture I'm going to read it again this is mine this is for my kids this is for my people this is for what they need this is my word right here this is for me not for no one else you start doing that claiming that part of the scripture you'll be there with you all off Spring you're going to take a body change we which are alive and remain you all those different things start claiming it start walking in it you say well see here we go we're majoring on a minor again the minor is well I didn't feel a thing come on we're humans I didn't feel a thing it didn't ask you how you felt it actually you did you believe it and it may take weeks before it's manifested may take months before it's manifested and it may manifest in a miracle right there but you got to have what patience to wait on God remember what brother Brown said what patience who patience on who he didn't say your neighbor he didn't say your wife remember in statute perfect man he said the first thing you got to have patience with is who God you got to have patience with God that he'll do what he said he will do regardless if the World Turns Upside Down we were talking today and you know they got the cat and dog thing in the in the schools now where they can they can identify as a cat or a dog and you think it's crazy they do it take their own little litter box with them to school how crazy is that I said if my kid ever walked in and said he was a cat you know what I do I take him to the vet praise the Lord anyhow we found the study of the scriptures that's a m they treat cats a lot different than they treat people so we'll take them to the bat and see how see how much they want to they want to uh identify as a cat but that's the world and you know what though we were talking and they were they made a good point today we were talking about it we had a little downtime at the post office and one one lady and she's a good Methodist girl she said you know she said if this thing goes two more Generations that's we're looking at it as abnormal she said two generations from now that'll be normal that's right cuz every generation gets weaker and you you you start accepting things that's what Satan does he brings little things in and he pushes and you accept it he pushes it and you accept it that's why we shouldn't accept any of that junk we shouldn't accept what the devil brings us we shouldn't accept the world and what they give us so we found in study of the scriptures the messenger of the age comes right at the end of the age so what age did Brother Bram come at he came at the end of that Pentecostal age that we were talking about 1906 isza Street to bring us a message that's going to take us in a Rapture amen all right that's going to take us to perfection all right no other one none of these we see here now watch at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word God help me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive look not a message a messenger and then he's going to have a message that will take all these loose ends now what's the Loose Ends the Loose Ends is what's keeping us here right God can't Rapture loose ends or he would already done it he can't capture he can't do that he can't Rapture Loose Ends he can't perfect Loose Ends but God thank God he sent us somebody that could put that back together he could tie eternity back together oh praise the Lord listen we're the most privileged people in the world the world looks at us and we're crazy you believe a what and he did what like I said before I'm reading that book about the that Gordon Lindsay wrote so you brother brandom Gordon linday wrote a book about the Great Men of of of the era are back from I gu gu Luther Wesley sanki Calvin finny I mean he lists everyone and he just Praises him never List brother brandham one time and he knew brother brandham Gordon Lindsay was with brother ROM until he started preaching the truth I mean he wasn't preaching ER but he got out of that minor part and then started preaching Doctrine and Gordon Lindsay left him but he's that brother R's name is not in that book that's a shame that's a shame it's a shame and it's not a shame to quote these other brothers Moody sanky Calvin they had a part but they had part you and I are sitting today under the fullness we have no restrictions except what's between your two ears that's the only restriction you got you can't say I don't have this yes you have that I don't have enough yes you have enough of that I haven't found it you ain't look hard enough that's right it's all on us God laid it out there and we to find it if it was so easy then yeah the whole world would say yeah that's good that's all right we're good we got this message yeah but can you live it that was Gordon Lindsay's problem when brother R started preaching truth and Doctrine it was so far away that every from every all those other great men which were great men God winked at their ignorance he didn't need Perfection from them come on he didn't need Perfection for Dwight Moody but brother Ram said Dwight Moody sent millions of people to heaven preaching simple Doctrine but that his requirement was not to tie loose ends up or Roberts was not to tie loose ends up right Billy Graham was not to TI ends up it was to get people to Christ and get them to see enough for salvation at least get them out of Sodom as the two witnesses did down there get at least get one or two get three of them out four if Mama hadn't turned around looked back at Sodom so now look now Look at That Shook we've talked about this the other day I want to just kind of redo it for a minute there's a teeny butt of grain coming on there's the real thing see that's what God's been looking for all right if this went in the ground at nah this this black I mean this blue bottle cap if it went in the ground at Nia everybody with me and it got almost cut down the bride tree got cut down but it had power in The Roots You Got to kill the roots of a plan or grow right back up you can cut a great big tree down and if it's got all the sap still in the in the uh Roots it'll start sprouting again so what happened was that started sprouting again now what's God looking for he's not looking for stalk he's not looking for shuck he's looking for this again this was the original that went in the ground and Christ went in the ground to remember to come back to us on the day of Pentecost right but then the church had to go into the ground so that you could come to Perfection and get this out of the ground the life you you can't see it though Luther doesn't look like Perfection but he was perfect to God for what he had he had the stock which the life was coming up through it right then then Wesley had the two shoots still the life but none of this this is hidden in here somewhere right I love that the apple tree you take one apple and you put it in the ground it'll grow and produce more apples next year it'll produce more apples every Apple that was on that tree was in that little old seed that ain't much bigger it ain't as big as your fingernail every every seed has got that potential so the seed went in the ground seed the word god covered it up through the Dark Ages and then Luther now when it popped up it didn't pop this up but this is what God's looking for he didn't say I will restore the stock no cuz he know that worm ate all that stock down he ate all the plant down all but the life right I will restore what this and this what went in the ground was the son of man that's right the son of man went in the ground amen all right but now the life one in the ground now what's God looking for again he's looking for that son of man again that's why I see it more clear now than ever seen it in my life Jesus Christ not in body form like we were talking about Sunday he's not coming back in body form until the Millennium but he you and I are so much his part till we are him amen that's right this is what he's looking for this is it and this is me and you this is the end time bride in one little seed cuz what's it going to do it's going to come up now you're going to have a shook now what does a Shu do a Shu does this right here you gardeners know what I mean even and you look at wheat if you look at wheat and you look at little hairy looking thing on the wheat that's a shove that's not the seed that's why you have to wnow wheat which means you got to throw it up in the air you look on YouTube if you don't know what I'm talking about they take it overseas and instead of now America we we have blowers that blow that off but they don't have that over in the Far East and they take and throw it up in the air with the pitch Fort looking thing and you see the the chaff and the and the and the uh Chuck you see the the wind take it all way well what falls to the ground the wheat and that looks just like what was planted in the ground four months before amen so this this this seed that's here now looks just like the seed that went in the ground that's why it's a son of man Ministry folks it can't be can't be a spirit it's got to be a man and human flesh a man I'm talking about a many-membered body that that culminates into the one seed plant remember not to seeds that are many but to one seed which is Christ amen and you and I are Mage Jesus Christ I was thinking yesterday more and more we keep looking at these things and I keep studying a little bit more just on the common things like water baptism why do we take that name why did Jesus tell us in the name of he told us exactly what to do but the devil said no stay right there cuz that's not a name don't tell me brother don't tell me Jesus don't tell me God came up with the father son Holy Ghost baptism brother R said it was come from the pits of Hell direct quote he said that Doctrine came from the pits of hell it came right out of Jesus's mouth but it came from the pits of hell you had to have a re ation cuz them people sitting there was like you could have said anything but that brother BR we're gone you're saying Jesus was p no he wasn't he was saying they didn't have the right Revelation see you and I have the right Revelation so guess what check that off take that loose end and tie it up brother Bob and pull a pull it together cuz we've got that one remember we got to go to Perfection Paul said don't go back to this we don't have to keep proving water baptism now we do the younger ones we know that but now me and you if I come up Sunday and all y'all are pretty mature and here been here for a long time and I preach on water baptism then next Wednesday I preach on water baptism and then next Sunday I preach on water baptism eventually y'all find somebody that'll preach to you something else besides water baptism we got that you know you we got that amen so Paul said let's go on to Perfection brother B said let's go on let's tie the lot let's tie the loose ends together and that was the first part of his ministry that was the that was the bait on the hook and all the different things at the beginning but the real message was after all that was like I was going to read it but I don't have time I'm going to try to stop a little bit early tonight uh I said try I'm about to close that's what brother kri dig says I'm about to close but uh you go to Elijah on Mount Caramel remember those 400 prophets they tore that altar to Pieces that's right yeah now what did what did the Bible say Elijah put those stones back together he told him how this he he said look you've tore this thing apart brother Brown said you've tore this thing apart you prophets of Baal now he didn't say Baal he had a lot more grace than that but he was pretty much telling them they tore the they tore religion apart it just become a denomination but Elijah before God came on the scene though Elijah had to put them Stones back where they were right and he knew that cuz he restored them back he put those back to where they were supposed to go then God came on the scene well guess what brother R did the same thing he comes on the scene with all those prophets jumping up and down and say we got a we got a trinitarian Doctrine we got three gods and I was listening to somebody the other day on Moody and he tried to explain to Trinity and I know a lot but I was really confused when he got done I I started to call in not going down the road I started call in go could you explain that just one more time he was talking about this was a person and this was a person and and this person was this one and came over to this one and and I just didn't understand it I I thought man just believe in one God but you know what why can't we why you know why cuz it's the spirit of the age it's the spirit that came that trinitarian pulled it apart right n pulled it apart false Doctrine pulled it apart and give us three gods and they can't explain it they try but they just can't I just believe here Israel the Lord thy God is one and he and morphe's into different forms and right now he's in the last in morphe he's in me and you that's pretty much self-explanatory to me so there's a little teeny bit of grain coming in there's the real thing see we got to come back to the real not that it was false but remember partial to perfect partial to perfect brother R said here's my hand it's up against the wall that's a shadow of it but there had to be an original before there could be a shadow there had to be an original dollar before they could counterfeit a dollar off of it all right so there had to be a real and this is real but that got lost down Through the Ages the real got lost oh there was pieces but with me and you that which is perfect is come that which is imp part to be done away with we don't work work on counterfeit anymore we don't work on we hope this is right anymore I hope you don't if this ain't it I'm telling you as much fun as I've been having if this ain't it the one if it's coming a lot more fun that'll take us in Rapture but this is it right here this is going to Rapture us we're going to see this in the next if God allows another year or so we're going to see the culmination of everything God told us to that Prophet would take place there's some things that had took place yet and we know for sure those two prophets are over there in Israel right now they got to be and they may be fighting and they God may be protecting them but I mean they're they're throwing bombs at each other like crazy over there but I like Israel they stood up again the other day and said look we didn't ask for your permission we didn't need your help to begin with and the United States is going well you you need our no we don't need your help you can help us if you want to but we don't really need your help so they went over there and just took that one guy out and they even had a Drone footage of the guy they droned him they put that drone right in the room where the man was that leader saan or whatever his name was y y and they took him out I mean they showed it taking him out so don't mess with God's people they're still God's people God's still fighting for them he's still fighting with them and as long as we do we'll be fine but when we turn against Israel we're done and we're going to be out of here because that means that the man of sin is coming and he's going to make a contract with them and we're not going to be here to see it so don't worry folks it ain't going to be a long time but now what was that shook Pentecost protected the grain it allowed that grain to mature but what happened was the Shu fall fell away watch now it looks just perfectly no wonder Jesus said it would deceive the very elect if possible looks just like the grain right in the place the grain ought to be cuz it's so close it's right here it did the same thing that the others did before organized what did it become a carrier now let's read I'm going to read this real quick and we'll get back off of it back on again but brother brownman 1956 and here you here you him now watch what he says now I want to say to you last night we took tonight was Evangelistic call friends Divine Healing is just a minor we still believe brother Ryan was a prophet right and you can never do you believe what the prophet says he didn't say you can compromise and kind of he said you will never major on a minor as I said salvation of the soul is much greater than Divine Healing Divine Healing was included in the new atonement because the old atonement had healing in it and the new new one is much better than than the old if the old one could furnish healing what about the new one other words under bulls and goats they were healed they had Waters they had different things you know before the the Holy Ghost came on a group of people and they started praying for the sick that's right you didn't hear them praying for the sick in the Old Testament cuz they didn't remember what brother Brown said he said I he said I sure wished I could put my hand in Moses's script bag whatever he had in there to heal all and heal his hand and all that stuff that was just partial to what when Jesus stood there and said divide the Loaves and Fishes and raise up go do this go do that and everything just did what he said I'll get to something not this today but I want to get to something about that you got to read what Jesus said because if if we if we're to be the son of man in the end time we've got to do what that man did everybody with me I think Dad told us a long time ago read Matthew Mark Luke and John that's the son of man all right now now the manifestation of what he preached imp partial I'm sorry to say that but Paul said he's prophesied in part but read those four gospels that's the son of man Ministry so whatever happened to him is going to happen to us now listen the only part is we don't have we don't have to be crucified now we'd be crucified but not on a cross he was crucified once for all nobody we don't have to go to a cross but we have to bear a cross you understand that so partial to perfect the transition now the change from one thing to the next so we're changing now just like the Old Testament as John come on the scene and Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world the first coming of Christ right everybody with me brother brandom was the same thing he comes to the end of the beautiful he comes at the end of the church age Paul arenus Martin Luther Columba all the way up Pentecost he stands right here and tells the people Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you got to come here you got to come here because God has moved from here to here and then look he didn't point us to himself he pointed us to Christ which is the word of God everybody knows that so transition is a change from one to the next so John the Baptist stood and he took him from the Old Testament into the New Testament brother Rah took him from getting away from everything come on cuz he was to restore what was gone to bring the what faith of the fathers back because the faith of the fathers was what they didn't have these Loose Ends they didn't have them over here Paul never preached the trinitarian doctrine Luther never I mean um John never preached the trinitarian doctrine none of those first they didn't have that in their in their mind now there was people there that did but not them not the original one well we've come back now to the original thing but brother randam said I know what happened Satan said okay I feel that anointing too it's cool over here I think I'll stay right here I never found this spot before but they got an anointing and and Satan says I think I'll go over here this is where he knows what's true remember he was from the beginning he just don't like it and what he's doing is he's trying to get you not to like it he's he's he's really not trying to get us to worship him he's getting us to not worship God therefore we'll worship Him turn our eyes to him but Satan comes along and he comes right here and he he gets in that Pentecostal I'll read it he gets in that P OST and he starts breaking them up into all these different isms and schisms and Tess and threeness and Church of God of Christ Church of God there's thousands of different Pentecostal denominations and God never set a one of them up Satan said every one of them up that's why brother Bram said come out of her my people you and I are the ones that he came for to get us out of that that Pentecostal age and get us into the bride age well you can be happy about that if you want to but I'm sure I'm happy about it I'm sure I don't have to go to a church where you got to speak in tongues and and you got to shout to have the Holy Ghost we'd all be in trouble cuz y'all don't do that neither do I hello somebody but somewhere in that ugly caterpillar is a butterfly caterpillars are not pretty they're ugly but what's inside of that thing is really beautiful so what we got to do let it out all right Hebrews 6 verse1 said therefore leaving the principles what the Cornerstone of the doctrines of Christ like I said before we don't have to preach water baptism every service sure we can add it in when we got new people sure we can if anybody has a question we'll go back and answer it but you shouldn't have you should have that settled in your heart in this church right here today that water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only correct baptism so now we can move on so build on that don't go back to that don't go back three years from now or three years before and go I wonder if that's right no come on you got to have that established in your heart cuz we got to go on to Perfection let that be your foundation listen if you start right you'll end right if you don't start right you got to go back to right so you can get out here that's why brother brandom said listen I can lay a straight wall not a problem but when you turn a corner you got to get that angle exactly right cuz if you don't when you get from here 30 ft down that way what does it start doing it goes completely off the foundation you know how I know that come to my house me and daddy didn't read something right down one corner and we almost had to lay another Foundation it stayed on it but it was about that far off but we had we didn't we didn't have the thing done exactly right and you listen you can't go back once the mortar's already already dry so turning a corner has to be something that God does to make it perfect and God with a prophet he turned a corner with a prophet called William brandom all right so Paul said look therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection The Headstone the son of man who was the most perfect man on the world in the world Listen Christianity will tell you who was perfect the son of man the son of man was perfect they just don't know and hadn't been taught that that same Spirit of that son of man is inside of you and then the anointing for the end time is for us to be just like him oh no you can't see there you go H you think you're perfect in Christ yes I am that's right if you put it in him cuz what is the son of man what is perfection is the finisher it's the it's what whatever you're done is perfected one who has in his own p person rais Faith to its Perfection remember there's faith for the time right brother brother Dale preached that years ago that the little woman said well had faith for the time the woman at the him of the God had faith for her time she didn't have faith listen she didn't have faith for a body change because obviously she's dead somewhere laying in the Tomb over there so is Lazarus so is everybody except the people they're out here now right so she had faith for the time to get her where she needed to go you and I have got to be what the finisher cuz remember he's the author and finisher of our faith so faith has got to come to a raise Faith to its Perfection and so set before us the highest example of Faith then Paul continues on not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment this we will do if God permit and God has permitted 2,000 years am to get it right all right so the Cornerstone was the church ages partial Revelation The Headstone the son of man is the perfect Revelation now brother brandham worked under paral partial Revelation come on somebody brother brandham preached wrong Doctrine don't get quiet on me he said he did right he said if I would have made a horrible mistake if I have preached what I preached before when the angel came in the room and told me this boy people don't like that but you know what partial to perfect thank God he was man enough that whole week of the seals he was man enough to stand in that pull pit and say I was wrong this was wrong far beyond what I thought he thought the souls under the alt was y'all the dead Saints it went open amen it's on tape it's in books thank God for a man that was honest he didn't hide nothing but then that which is perfect came when no seals open that's when God turned that thing and said all right buddy this is what you preach that white horse rider is not the Holy Ghost like you preached it was the mighty conquer back in the ' 50s ain't that right those Souls under the altar they're not crying how long to avenge our blood H that's not saints Saints don't cry for vengeance but that had been hid but once that book was open and brother Ram could see when that angel came every day in that room and gave him Revelation and said look now remember let me get something straight an angel never gave him a revelation that's right right I can't give you one brother brandham can't give you one only God can give you a revelation so I believe as as Dad said many times before I believe that angel they've been with him I that angel was with him all the time and I believe he just said William Brandon what you been preaching been preaching one God and here it is right here he said so who's that guy riding that horse and you said it was me or or God who is that you got two people you always said if you had two people one was the devil and then it just clicked and brother Ram now remember cuz watch what he said if you go back to the seals he said I spent the whole day going through scripture after scripture after scripture what lining that thing back up to where now we can stand here today every minister in this gospel every minister in this church age in this message can preach the truth if we want to just like the prophet did cuz folks he's gone his body is laying up here in Jeffersonville his soul is in the sixth Dimension he's waiting on somebody to preach a Perfection that he preached while he was here right and I contend that's us I just contend that's every day I get up I somewhere during that day I think it's so good to be in this message and you know what I'm not a I'm not a brandom parakeet I had had a preacher one time said I'm just a I'm just a parakeet for brother brandom I said well now I'm not brother I just I just can't be that I can't be a parakeet cuz that's just saying what somebody else says I want God to speak to me through those tapes speak to me through those books and let me come to that Revelation let my Holy Ghost be so free to where it takes all that and says that ain't nothing but the truth well you know what he done to had it right it brought eternal life to her children just for just by saying that ain't nothing but the truth why don't we start saying that sometime I know when you say Amen you say it ain't nothing but the truth because you wouldn't amen if you didn't think it was true but we know what to amen for right some of you ought to try it exactly now look then we find out we've been studying that down Through the Ages we had reformers that's what we've been talking about pieces they've had pieces each office carried its own work but when the real thing is to be revealed at the last time look of the last part of the church that's us right there is no other bride Church coming this is it it's when God has said he would send to us according to the scripture we've searched it that he predicted the spirit of Elijah will returning some person it'll be profly properly identified and we know it was absolutely know it was properly identified so Malachi 4 he turned the heart of the children of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse that's brother brandom part the part before that was John the Baptist remember so brother randam was sent two Pentecostal babies to bring them to maturity amen now what they done with it was their business and you know what they did they loved him they loved him when they could get 25,000 people in an auditorium and they'd be healings one right after the other all the pent and then somebody pop up and speak in tongues and prophesying and all that they just that was that was their Glory Days but they said this is it brother randam stood one day and said listen you say this is it you lat rain people say this is it he said you a't had the know words I hadn't started teaching yet the truth the real I mean digging down and digging in the truth and telling them water baptism and Lord Jesus Christ was the only way to baptize telling them there was no eternal hell telling them that that that they come to a place of marriage and divorce where your sins are forgiven and all these different things and and where God gives Grace and then we look at all these other different things that they didn't want to hear that they left what me and brother Jimmy was talking about yesterday you know brother brandom when when he preached the seals he said he said all my friends are going to leave me I think he made it a mount but when he preached marriage and divorce I think he said thousands he said look out office he said here it comes you know why because that was the separating part CU remember the woman said afterwards remember brother Ram said she said brother brandham you forgive those people their sins he said she wasn't far off from that ain't that what she what he said right CU listen folks the Bible tells us whosoever sins you remit they're remitted whoever sins you retain they're retained that's in the Bible brother R couldn't come and bring anything outside the Bible it was already in scripture so now the Holy Ghost has got to have something to work with that's why you and I have got to get rid of the false Doctrine I believe we have but we need to see keep working on what Christlike nature that's why we're heading to let the life do it said I never let us say the great dummy teach me I bet somebody was saying that in his in their mind and he picked that up and said that and I bet could you imagine somebody be sitting there and thinking all that he all he just verba them tells you what you're thinking yeah you know he stood there one day and he said watch it he said I know what you're thinking good grief could you imagine no wonder he was only one man that could stand it I'd go crazy he said he have to pinch yourself to see if he was in this world or the next sometimes I have to do that but it's not because of that is this really where I'm at so the transition to Perfection has begun just a few minutes so after the burst pains comes instead of going on with the word they got a bunch of men together just like the first one did that's exactly right after the rocking of the apostles then we find her going off again like um ni all those different things then we find out Along come many of the others agabus and many of the Great reformers back in the beginning each age had done as you study the prena council the Nia fathers and all back you find it all in there each age was rocked every time a messenger came forth he had thus sayith the Lord now she is in the worst stage that according to scripture she's ever been we are in the leoty and church age a rich but blinded Church age that don't know it there wasn't nowhere in the Bible that Christ was ever put out of the church but the lay out of see and age she's in the worst age she's the rottenest she's ever was I said as a queen and have need of nothing and don't you know that you're naked miserable blind poor and don't know it yes sir I counsel thee to come in by Isa this message is the isaf the word of God preached through lips of clay anointed by God Is Isa amen that I might open your eyes the eyes myself of God will certainly bring light to the church if it wants to open his eyes to what God has said notice quickly now she's in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in the Le ofan Church age now our messenger is Promised in Malachi 4th the 4th chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word all right bring it back bring the people back to the word Pentecost partially did that they didn't come to forward though they come to a certain place or the Holy Ghost wouldn't fail itself right birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 now I've heard this preached many many times by people in the message one particularly that this is the new birth that we have today is you always was eternal you always had that seed you was all this I mean you was they don't talk about predestination by for knowledge it's just that you come to a realization this is the new birth from According to Malachi 4 you can't change the Bible brother brandham never said that brother brandham is not meaning that right that it's a new New Birth am it's a new birth from According in Malachi 4 because when you come to that Malachi for birth in the end time listen to me people you want accept false Doctrine now the new birth in the other ages God would wink at that ignorance and would accept he wouldn't accept false Doctrine he'd accept your sincerity for what was being brought at the time it was brought right thank God for Grace thank God for Grace with people Luther and Wesley and different ones and they'll thank God too because they made it but then you come over here in the end time word be delivered of a new birth from According to my for what do Malachi for to do restore that's right so we're to come to a new birth and when you get born again in this age you get born again in this age and you hear this message you got to come to it you got to come to it you can't deny it If you deny this message you're not born again amen that's thus sayith the Lord that's thus sayith the whole Bible That's thus sayith everybody in this building can say thus sayith the Lord you know brother Ram told us he said you you know the brid will have thus sayith the Lord as she'll sit step well we don't have to sit still anymore we have th sayth the Lord we know where the word is we know what it says we know how to get it so we can say thus says the Lord this is what it is this message is exactly the truth come straight from God to me if it come to you that's fine became straight to me in the church world today there's two systems working I want you to see if you're going to say Amen on this why one of the systems was set both systems were sitting in his congregation at the time there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder then I have to then have it over with we all know that that's the word of God and the denominational system there's your two systems denominational world word of God there's two systems at work just like Jacob and Esau just like who Judas and and Jesus and the only way Jesus knew who Judas was is cuz he was the son of man he had discernment he knew who he was I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it now look he said these men brother Bob black brother Aron Roberts brother luiso different ones Brother Richard Douglas and all those different ones those men those men you are there that is that is your quote these men if they pick up this capital T that's the message and goes out with it they can make more sense to it I think he makes really good sense but he said we'd make more sense of it right I just want to lay this seed and then hope they make it come to life and I believe we've done it amen now remember he'll restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body talking about the Malachi 4 message all right truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice be his voice Revelations 10 and perform his Works do you see it 1965 doing God a service now watch the Mysteries will be revealed in the last day now now listen Divine Healing is not a mystery it's been happening for since the dawn of time pretty much everybody with me all right there's a mystery maybe how it happens but there's no mystery to it we have it it's in the atonement it's in the Bible it tells us the mystery will be revealed on the last day when the seven angels seventh Angel's message not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not in the years of preparation not the bait on the hook not the partial everybody with me not the Cornerstone zerubabel laid that building again he swept the foundation off he didn't he didn't destroy the foundation he built what was on there already he built it back all right Elijah didn't get another set of stones he built on that same Foundation that they tore down not not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries will be revealed and here they are boy what a prophet here they are not knowing them and you people are witness of that Paradox now this is what we won get to and then we'll close right here 1965 healing is the children's bread we realize that it's in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to our soul get people born again I think sometimes they and it's good that you go through a prayer line but most people go through a prayer line they want to be healed with something and healing has always forerun every message and it's been also been a means to gather people together remember Jesus started out Healing Ministry and then he started preaching word brother Brown started out Healing Ministry started preaching the word all right many people will sponsor a healing meeting many will come to a healing meeting or a song festival I don't know what he put that in there for but when it comes to a poor lost soul there's not many people interested interested in it that's the main thing though Divine Healing and singing festivals and so forth is just as brother Bosworth said it's de baate on the hook and you show the the fish to bait not the hook and it's just the thing to get the people to listen till he can really present to them your message God has did that in every age through every age there's always been a healing campaign you know what that angel rebuke brother brandom for trying to explain that you know what he's saying you're wasting your time that's right you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things and the Pentecostals thought they was the most Supernatural people in the world and God had left them God has did that in every age there's always been a healing campaign and if it's a genuine healing campaign behind that campaign always is a message there never is a sign given just for a sign it's forerunning a message and see you and I have picked that up then there's a message we love the he we love the healing part right but give me the message but when he begins to tell them the truth of the Gospel who he was and what he come for he's talking about Jesus he was not popular after that and that's the way it's always been through every age and it will continue that way when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what was Wesley rebuke to the Lutheran Pentecost rebuke to the others where has the life gone now away from an organization no more shook it had to come back to the grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecostals to fulfill the scripture of this hour notice the very day when this message not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message you see the first pull was healing that started today out second pull was telling them the thoughts and intents of the heart but now remember you got to carry that on to where brother brandham was starting to preach his message all right he was starting to discern what they needed and give it to them third pull opening of the word the Myster is revealed so the first pull was healing second pull was that intermediate part and then the opening of the word the seals the mystery was revealed there's no more higher order to reveal the word than Prophets The Only Way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word remember the third pole was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word of God real quick right here all right now we're trying to place the Revival now watch this what year is this 1959 now listen here's a prophet 1959 he's been on the scene now since what 19 48 40 48 and that when everything started 47 48 47 47 12 years 12 years he's been on the field 12 years watch now we're trying to place the Revival just in the best setting that we can we do not what we call major on Divine Healing he's been preaching for 12 years because Divine Healing is a minor all right and you cannot major on a minor we know that so the great thing that we're after for any Revival is to bring lost souls to Christ first now watch He's put four things in here bring lost souls to Christ first if you bring somebody to Christ first and get them born again you ain't got to tell them the message is Right you've done your job it's God's job through the Holy Ghost Inside of them to take them right through you don't have to tell the Holy Ghost filled person to come to church that's why you get them born again you don't have to worry about preaching about people not coming to church it's the lost souls and that's the first thing revive the church back into a spiritual condition number two to where it should be close communion with God bring Fellowship among the churches that's not happening too much third and fourth pray for the sick last thing pray for the sick that's our aim our try Sinners first fellowship and with the churches a close walk with the church to God and then pray for the sick now that's the way it's lined up all right sin is on the Rampage worse than it ever was and moved right into the locks of the church and has tore it up what did our miracles do now watch this is 1959 same thing 12 years after he's been on a 12E healing campaign at this moment right here sin is on the Rampage worse than it ever was and moved right into the locks of the church and has tore it up what did our miracles do he's asking a question what did our healing campaigns question mark I believe in Divine Healing sure but you can never major on a minor Divine Healing is a minor we could never major on those things the church ought to be to maturity 1959 1959 and we've had rushing winds and we've had all kind of sensation where's the church at where are we at today I ask the same question to us still more denominations growing every day and colonizing and everything and still the same men evidence of the Resurrection 1958 what's the matter today you can preach repentance and hellfire Brimstone people laugh at it what's the matter our hearts are cold we are indifferent we've got too much we need less of the world and more of God our hearts are too cold we become interested in some emotion oh one more time we become interested in some emotion we become interested if we can dance now watch now watch if we can shout I believe in it we believe in all that too amen but you better get the word first you get the word first everything else goes in line if we can speak with tongues I believe in it I believe in every bit of that but if we have that and don't have have that agonizing weeping brokeup Spirit God can never use it them things are good but we got to have the other to go with it we've left off now watch we've left off the main thing and gone for secondary you see it in the message now too brothers and sisters oh yeah they've left off the teaching part they've left off trying to grow in God and they went to the secondary and you can never major on a minor we know that identified Christ of all ages 1964 let's get one after the seals and then we'll close now in this we do not try to say we major in Divine Healing because Divine Healing is a minor everybody understand what a minor and major is a minor is you can't become perfected minor is partial everybody with me minor is partial major is perfect so so you can never now he said never he said never 10 times you can never major on a minor but now watch but about 86% I think it's estimated of Jesus's Ministry was on Divine Healing right as Dr Bosworth used to say one of my associates went on to Glory a few years ago Divine Healing is the bait that's on the fish hook and you never show the fish the hook you show him the bait so he takes the bait and gets the hook the problem is sometimes when we go fish Mission I know me and brother Danny we have fed a lot of fish that never took the hook cuz we didn't put the we didn't put the worm on right maybe sometimes we ain't put the worm on right and catch fish I'm talking about in this message we want to catch the fish for the Lord's Glory catch them out of the world and bring them to the kingdom of God now watch read this right here and then we'll quit musicians come on So Divine Healing the main thing is Divine Healing of the Soul right the body of Christ it needs healing worse than anything that I know is the body of Christ it's been so broken up by men's Theology and denominational differences until it's a sick body I tell you it needs healing great healing now a gift like I said a gift is wonderful let's stand but you can't base your Eternal destination on gifts you cannot make on a minor and a gift is a minor and Satan can impersonate any gift God's got and he can make something just exactly like it but listen he can't put the word together he hates the word therefore we got to watch that he's seen demons shout speaking tongues same thing they do about Divine Healing they say well it's a hoca Pocus or something like it isn't it's genuine unadulterated faith in what God Said is the truth and that anchors and when it anchors there's nothing going to move it am now here's here's my stopping point right here brother R tells us in birth pains he said that's the same thing in the New Birth we never go back but we go forward when we're born again and that's why I think today we have so many so many not so many rather genuine new births amen because it's built on an emotion it's built on shouting it's built on going through a prayer line it's built on brother so and so told me I had it you going to be left behind but you get the Holy Ghost and he'll lead you and guide you into all truth he promised amen that's why I think today we have so many not so many rather genuine new births it's because the seed is maybe will sympathize with the word God is not a sympathizer Satan is a sympathizer will sympathize with the word or the person if my favorite preacher preaches I'll get something but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in amen and as I said again where's the new birth according to Malachi 4 it's not made in a prayer line right it could start but I thought we believe in justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost it's not getting healed to cancer though that's wonderful it's a healing of your soul be taught right the two systems they pull this whole thing apart and here we are standing here today we're trying to get ready to go in rapture we can't have minor we can't have minor minor can start Minor's okay but don't measure on that minor healing healing if I see healing I can get born again if I see that person or or if my favorite preacher says I'm Healed or says I'm born again you better watch it Satan can impersonate every gift that God has except the word of God being born in your soul Satan can't do that right God bless you let's sing a song Let's be wary let's be sensitive to what's going on right [Music] now when noach shall come no more clouds in the sky No More Tears to dim the eye all is peace forever more on that high Golden Shore what day glorious day that will be sing it to me oh what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be sorrow there no more bird to bear no more sickness no pain no more part over there and forever I will be with the one who died for me what a day glorious day that will be oh what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I I look upon his face the one who Sav Me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be [Music] but make sure our soul is healed make sure we got the new birth and then ask God say look God I don't have to go through a prayer line I can just say it I'm a gentile the Gentile way is not a prayer line Sorry even brother R tells many times laying on the hands of Methodist tradition call to the altar Methodist tradition what did the Gentile tell Jesus you just speak the word I'm of authority and you're of authority I tell people to go and come you tell people to go and come you know what he was saying I know you got authority over demons and there's a demon on my servant and as I'm coming to you as a somebody that has Authority and I can tell these men to kill you if they want to if I want them to he said you just speak the word and you know what Jesus said he said as you spoke it'll be done and we know that the very hour that they came running and said hey that's that's the best way to do it because you know why I'll promise you that dude that was in the I call him a dude that guy that was sitting in the in the house that whatever was wrong with him he's probably agonizing I mean he just and all of a sudden he didn't need a tape plate right he didn't need a preacher to shake him he would just lay in there and he had somebody of authority to speak for him amen and he just accepted the gift and I bet you when it happened he's like what in the world went on I've had that done one time I've been healed of something and and you're like and it shocks you shouldn't shock us but it does shock you because you're not expecting it maybe sometimes you're not even under the atmosphere of of an anointing that's like now an anointing that's going back and forth through the church you might be out there working somewhere you know brother Dale the greatest messages he preached he was working 40 to 50 hours a week at General Motors and he was writing notes on a piece of paper that was supposed to be for a job he'd write notes and stick them in his pocket that was God coming to him amen sometimes we think we have to have an atmosphere sure and it's good to have one amen love to feel the presence of the Lord but I sure like to feel him when I'm sitting down somewhere under a tree somewhere or sitting somewhere in the house and God just drops down and to me that's Sovereign brother Bob and that to me that's intimate that's intimate I'm the only one there and maybe I got maybe somebody's praying for me that's okay but at that time in that moment he just drops right down and he just gives you something that's the special part of God I mean he can do that while he's doing it to you I ain't special he do it to you too let him drop down and I've had him drop down in a car one time I was driving a a a a little small S10 white S10 back from we were we were building my house and I was listening to the radio and I was asking God about something and the atmosphere got so real inside that till I looked over to see if there was somebody sitting there and you know what I did I had a hat on and when I did I slung that thing off I said God if you're here I said this is what I need and he gave it to me but I throw that hat off I knew there was a Pres there that had not been there before but I've also been riding down the road and think the devil's sitting beside of me so don't get me wrong we we're not we're not always on the cloud by oursel either the devil's there or God's there one of the two but when the listen when the presence of God Comes The Devil can't stand it he leaves he can't stand being that close I'm going say this before we leave now listen look how special we are right look how special we are cuz Satan can talk to God anytime he wants to walk right up to him and talk to him but when you and I are [Music] involved Satan hates that he can sit there and talk to God he can accuse us but when you're standing there and God's on the scene Satan don't like that he don't like to feel that kind of anointing on an old sinner human being that we are he don't like that he don't like it because he wants us to be a sinner but praise God God can work through every bit of that and give us what we need let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for the word you give us tonight I pray that you'd bless us now on the highways as we leave bless us Lord in our work job for tomorrow in the different days Lord be with us and come back together on Sunday Lord that we'll worship you in spirit and Truth just be with the ones that are sick Lord sister Johnny and different ones that you'll touch their body Lord I pray that you would just bless each one on the highways that are traveling up there in North Carolina and Tennessee that you'll protect them Lord thank you for giving us a group of angels up there that took care of a lot of people and some of them even here father I pray that you just give them Supernatural strength and and a spiritual uplifting in our times of trouble father we ask these things in Jesus name amen God bless you go with God oh what a day that will be [Music]
