[45:45] praise for we ask it Lord in your
[45:47] matchless name the name of the Lord
[45:50] Jesus Christ amen amen let's read in
[45:53] Luke chapter 24 uh verses 1- 11
[45:57] and then we'll take one verse from acts
[45:59] chap 1 uh verse number
[46:01] 8 amen now on upon the first day of the
[46:06] week very early in the morning they came
[46:09] into the supper bringing the spices
[46:12] which they had prepared and certain
[46:14] others with him and they found the stone
[46:17] rolled away from the Seiler and they
[46:20] entered in and found not the body of the
[46:23] Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they
[46:26] were much perplexed thereabout behold
[46:29] two men stood by them in shining
[46:32] garments and as they were afraid and
[46:34] bowed their faces to the Earth they said
[46:37] unto them why seek ye the living among
[46:41] the dead he is not here but is risen
[46:45] remember how he spake unto you when he
[46:49] was yet in Galilee saying the son of man
[46:52] must be delivered into the hands of
[46:54] sinful men and be crucified and the
[46:57] third day rise again and they remembered
[47:01] his words amen many times that's what a
[47:04] message does is remind you amen put you
[47:08] in remembrance again of what he's
[47:10] already said what he's already purposed
[47:12] and determined to do amen and and and
[47:16] and they remembered his words and
[47:17] returned from the Seiler and told all
[47:19] these things unto the 11 and to all the
[47:22] rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna
[47:25] and mother and Mary the mother of J
[47:26] James and other women that were with him
[47:29] which told these things unto the
[47:32] apostles and their words seemed to them
[47:36] as Idol tals and they believe not what a
[47:41] place for his own chosen disciples to be
[47:45] and let's also read in Acts chapter 1
[47:47] verse uh number eight we'll just take
[47:49] this one verse of
[47:52] scripture and you shall receive power
[47:55] amen after that the Holy Ghost has come
[47:58] upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto
[48:03] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[48:07] and in Samaria and this is what captures
[48:10] us and unto the uttermost part of the
[48:14] earth amen may the Lord bless his word
[48:18] and the reading of his word is you're
[48:19] seated this afternoon amen I want to
[48:22] take for a title that phrase from the
[48:24] scriptures he is not here yeah he is
[48:27] risen amen and uh maybe we could just uh
[48:32] or subtitled this the witnesses of his
[48:36] resurrection amen I'm I'm reading here
[48:39] from a message preached in 1965 I have
[48:41] heard but now I see and he says could
[48:45] you think church that you are looking
[48:48] with your own eyes The Living Word of
[48:51] God made manifest the promise of the
[48:55] hour in the past days looking with your
[48:59] own eyes at the Living Word being
[49:02] interpreted in natural form God Among Us
[49:08] I see him with my own eyes the one I
[49:11] heard that he would do it all the old
[49:13] sages looked for this day now we see it
[49:17] manifested with our own eye how many old
[49:20] shouting Methodist Baptist and the real
[49:23] genuine Pentecostals in their age long
[49:26] to see this happened many of them know
[49:29] it would happen but we stand tonight
[49:31] seeing it happen oh don't you love him
[49:35] amen you know I I I just want to begin
[49:38] this afternoon by saying this if you're
[49:40] going to be a witness to the resurrected
[49:44] Christ it will require faithfulness when
[49:48] it seems he is
[49:51] absent amen amen while the disciples you
[49:56] know when we we we picked this scene up
[49:58] this this afternoon in Luke chap 24 and
[50:02] we see women coming to the Tomb of the
[50:05] Lord Jesus amen the disciples amen were
[50:09] disbanded they were scattered amen only
[50:12] a few remained faithful amen but uh uh
[50:16] you know these who came to the tomb that
[50:18] morning amen were there to perform a
[50:21] service to the Lord amen even with no
[50:25] hope that he would do anything more for
[50:29] them amen and I I believe what I'm
[50:33] seeing here is that Mary and these two
[50:36] that were with her amen were
[50:38] representing the believer in the end
[50:40] time amen I believe Mary was a type of
[50:42] the Bride I believe she was a type of
[50:45] the Overcomer and she had a faith or she
[50:47] had a quality of Faith amen that
[50:50] distinguished her even from Peter even
[50:54] from John even from James and all the
[50:56] other disciples amen she had something
[51:00] that would not let her leave oh my amen
[51:05] they came to the tomb and and and maybe
[51:07] I should um maybe I should also read uh
[51:10] there's a couple of accounts of this but
[51:13] let me uh let me just find out real
[51:14] quick and if you've heard me preach
[51:16] before you know this is how I am I I I
[51:18] never have it fully baked when I come
[51:21] out to preach it but let let me see I
[51:23] don't know if it's in Matthew's gospel
[51:25] um trying to see which one has the
[51:27] account I wanted
[51:31] to Yes
[51:33] um oh Jesus help me this
[51:37] afternoon it won't hurt us to read too
[51:39] much scripture will it Matthew 28:1 in
[51:42] the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[51:44] Dawn toward the first day of the week
[51:46] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[51:48] to see the supper and behold there was a
[51:50] great earthquake for the angel of the
[51:52] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[51:54] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[51:56] set up upon it his countenance was like
[51:58] lightning and his rment white as snow
[52:01] and for fear of him the keepers did
[52:03] shake and became his dead men and the
[52:05] angel answered and said unto the women
[52:08] fear not ye for I know that you seek
[52:11] Jesus which was crucified he is not here
[52:14] for he has risen as he said come see the
[52:18] place where the Lord lay and go quickly
[52:22] and tell his disciples that he is risen
[52:26] from the dead
[52:27] and behold he goeth before you in the
[52:29] Galilee there shall you see him lo I
[52:32] have told you amen now one of these
[52:35] accounts I I I I forget which one it is
[52:38] shows it may have been it is in John it
[52:41] is in John we'll get it later I got my
[52:44] message all turned around don't get
[52:46] nervous don't get nervous honey they've
[52:48] seen enough for me to know this is how I
[52:50] preach amen but we're looking at of
[52:52] faithfulness now because someone is
[52:55] going to get to experience amen before
[52:58] anybody else the news that Jesus Christ
[53:02] is not dead he's not in a tomb he's not
[53:06] cold he's not a victim of a conspiracy
[53:09] of the Romans and the Pharisees and the
[53:12] Sadducees amen but he has actually done
[53:15] everything that he said he would do
[53:17] before they did what they did so Mary
[53:20] and these other two come to the tomb and
[53:22] they they they they see there that the
[53:24] tomb is empty amen and and so they they
[53:27] they had a level of faithfulness and
[53:29] this is what I I want to capture this is
[53:32] what I want to make sure you see this
[53:33] evening amen they had a level of
[53:35] faithfulness that was determined to give
[53:38] honor to him that was determined to
[53:40] worship him that was determined to
[53:42] perform a service to him even if they
[53:45] didn't have any expectation that he
[53:47] could do anything for
[53:50] them they didn't think he was alive they
[53:53] didn't think he would ever perform
[53:55] another miracle they didn't think there
[53:57] was anything more that he as a as a as a
[54:00] natural person could ever do for them in
[54:02] a physical sense but they were
[54:04] determined to do something for him
[54:07] regardless and I want to tell you when
[54:09] you approach him with that level of zeal
[54:12] with that determination with that
[54:14] faithfulness you're going to get
[54:15] something that others do not get amen
[54:19] you're going to receive something and
[54:21] you are be going to become a witness you
[54:23] will have a testimony that exceeds
[54:25] others
[54:27] amen this faithfulness this dedication
[54:31] this
[54:32] steadfastness will be met with the
[54:34] reward amen amen real faithfulness isn't
[54:37] proven when it's known that he is
[54:40] present right but when it seems that
[54:42] he's absent or distant sir that's when
[54:47] real faithfulness is proven you can
[54:50] think about this in a marriage you can
[54:52] think about this even between parents
[54:54] and children that's right how do you
[54:56] know your your children are really
[54:57] absorbing and listening and and becoming
[55:00] subject subjective to your your your
[55:03] parenting when they behave in your
[55:10] absence when they don't know you're
[55:12] looking amen and they're still listening
[55:15] they're still behaving they're
[55:16] conducting themselves that shows amen
[55:19] there's a real
[55:20] relationship that shows there's a real
[55:22] faithfulness I wonder sometimes if God
[55:25] doesn't withdraw
[55:27] sometimes what we sense as his presence
[55:31] to prove our
[55:33] faithfulness man oh brother I wonder if
[55:37] that's not why Jesus
[55:39] didn't I'm sure it's why as a matter of
[55:41] fact when he reappeared on the emus Road
[55:44] amen he withheld their Vision or their
[55:48] understanding from knowing who he
[55:50] was amen he he he he veiled he veiled uh
[55:54] his he veiled his identity to their eyes
[55:58] and he took them to the word he took
[56:01] them to what Moses said he took them to
[56:03] what David said he took them to those
[56:05] Old Testament scriptures because he
[56:07] wanted to establish their faith and who
[56:10] he was as the word of God revealed
[56:13] rather than rely on what their five
[56:15] senses could declare to them because
[56:17] that'll fail your feelings will fail
[56:20] your senses will fail your emotions will
[56:22] fail the supernatural amen May Fail but
[56:26] his word will never fail and when your
[56:28] word when your faith is anchored in that
[56:31] there's nothing the devil can do to
[56:33] shake it sir amen so as a parent you
[56:37] know you may just pull them back a
[56:39] little bit and watch it are they going
[56:40] to still behave are they still I wonder
[56:43] if that's why God didn't allow his
[56:44] Prophet to leave the
[56:46] scene for the real bride to be
[56:50] proven for the real followers the real
[56:52] Believers the ones who were really
[56:54] caught by the message instead of
[56:58] enamored by the
[57:00] messenger because there were plenty of
[57:02] those and they dissipated when he left
[57:04] the scene and some of them are still
[57:06] waiting for his return then they're
[57:08] going to straighten up again but I want
[57:10] to tell you something if the word hasn't
[57:11] caught your attention and the word
[57:14] hasn't transformed your life if the
[57:16] message that the messenger spoke amen
[57:19] hasn't uh translated you and hasn't
[57:22] brought you into relationship with Jesus
[57:24] Christ I am very doubtful his return
[57:27] will do anything
[57:29] different but thank God there's a real
[57:32] bride there's a real people amen that
[57:34] aren't just looking for the prophet's
[57:36] return but they are preparing themselves
[57:39] for Christ's return amen he's going to
[57:42] bring his Prophet with him when he comes
[57:45] amen I believe that amen you know real
[57:48] real the the faithfulness of a marriage
[57:50] is proven when they're apart from each
[57:53] other that's when they can be real
[57:55] faithful
[57:57] real true the the the the saying goes I
[58:00] almost said the Bible but the Bible
[58:02] doesn't say that the saying goes absence
[58:03] makes the heart grow
[58:05] fonder absence can actually
[58:08] strengthen the bond make you long for
[58:11] one another even more make you
[58:13] appreciate you know you don't miss the
[58:14] water till the well runs dries the say
[58:16] goes but you know if you don't have a
[58:18] true Bond the absence will make you
[58:21] forget the feeling boy I'm way off my
[58:24] notes now but you know it's is all you
[58:27] had was an
[58:29] infatuation you like the way they looked
[58:31] or the like you just like the way you
[58:32] felt when you around the me but just get
[58:34] a little give a little distance give a
[58:35] little space and oh you get eyes for
[58:38] somebody else that's not real love
[58:40] that's not a that's not real
[58:42] faithfulness real faithfulness is proven
[58:45] amen when the two are apart and their
[58:48] love grows
[58:50] stronger the love grows stronger the
[58:52] bond grows greater amen oh my so Mary
[58:57] Joanna and and and and Mary it was Mary
[58:59] Magdalene Joanna and another uh sister
[59:02] named Mary showed this dedication and
[59:05] the devotion and they were the first
[59:08] living
[59:10] Witnesses of the resurrected
[59:12] Christ amen now Jesus Christ is none
[59:15] other than the revealed or manifested
[59:19] word of the hour and he's the same
[59:22] yesterday today and forever amen he's
[59:25] the same and yet his his word is
[59:27] continually unfolding or we could say
[59:30] advancing right amen God's word isn't
[59:34] changing but our understanding of his
[59:36] word is
[59:38] evolving because he has been unveiling
[59:41] himself to reveal himself to humanity or
[59:45] to his creation and it's a continual
[59:48] amen I believe the prophet of God says
[59:50] God God cannot decrease amen but he's
[59:53] always on the
[59:54] increase amen so is unfolding or
[59:57] unveiling the re revelation of himself
[1:00:00] to us and it's growing greater and
[1:00:02] greater and greater and greater amen so
[1:00:05] uh um um the these faithful
[1:00:08] followers amen went where he was or
[1:00:12] where he had been to the tomb and they
[1:00:16] had to hear an angel's
[1:00:18] message he is not here he's not where
[1:00:22] you left him he's not in the last place
[1:00:26] he was known to be this is where you
[1:00:28] left him but it's not where he is now
[1:00:31] and a real angel messenger amen will not
[1:00:35] point you to where Jesus was but he will
[1:00:38] point you to where he
[1:00:41] is his present day fulfillment his
[1:00:44] present day manifestation and it will
[1:00:47] validate what previous Messengers said
[1:00:49] it's not a departure from that but it's
[1:00:52] pointing you to the
[1:00:54] Fulfillment Hallelujah today of what
[1:00:57] they were saying even in their
[1:01:00] day he is not here but is risen and the
[1:01:04] angel put them in remembrance of his
[1:01:08] word didn't preach a new message to him
[1:01:12] repr preached what he had told
[1:01:14] him amen but the trauma and the grief
[1:01:17] and the tragedy brother Joe had made
[1:01:19] them forget what he
[1:01:22] said they
[1:01:24] forgot in Heat of the Moment and
[1:01:27] watching him amen surrender to the
[1:01:29] authorities and and surrender amen it
[1:01:32] was it as it would seem as divine power
[1:01:35] to place himself under the subjection of
[1:01:37] the Roman Empire am mean it it made them
[1:01:40] disillusioned friend think about where
[1:01:42] we are today some people are only
[1:01:46] disillusioned they have not lost the
[1:01:48] faith they are not in apostasy amen they
[1:01:51] have not blasting the Holy Spirit they
[1:01:53] have only become disillusioned
[1:01:56] because of the trauma of a pastor
[1:01:59] leaving the message a church splitting
[1:02:01] up the family being split apart all of
[1:02:03] these things can shake people but if
[1:02:06] they're Sons and Daughters of God the
[1:02:08] word of God will reach them and an angel
[1:02:11] will go to them and may involve you Amen
[1:02:13] to minister love and the truth amen you
[1:02:16] can be restored glory to God Peter was
[1:02:20] in this number amen there were there
[1:02:22] were 10 other disciples beside him amen
[1:02:24] who were also disillusion and
[1:02:27] disbanded but God raised up a
[1:02:30] mared to take the message to them and
[1:02:33] remind them of his
[1:02:35] words
[1:02:37] Hallelujah he was the same he was the
[1:02:40] same at his birth now I'm just going to
[1:02:42] hit a few places here and I hope I don't
[1:02:44] lose you along the way is this all
[1:02:47] right it was the same at his birth and I
[1:02:50] believe brother Solomon just mentioned
[1:02:52] it for a moment last night you know
[1:02:55] those maj were over I believe in the
[1:02:57] country of India and they saw they saw a
[1:03:02] development in the constellations they
[1:03:04] saw a
[1:03:05] shifting in those heavenly bodies and
[1:03:09] that shift or that alignment of those
[1:03:11] stars in those planets told them in the
[1:03:14] heavens something has happened on the
[1:03:19] Earthen it's not a future event it's not
[1:03:22] way up now right now God had
[1:03:27] condescended from the Realms of glory
[1:03:30] and had birthed
[1:03:31] himself in a little
[1:03:34] baby those Stars Lin up and they realize
[1:03:37] something has happened over there and
[1:03:39] they packed up they loaded up their
[1:03:40] camels they left the observatory amen
[1:03:43] they left there and they took their
[1:03:44] gifts and started on a on a on a journey
[1:03:47] of
[1:03:48] years and they were following the light
[1:03:50] of a star that's right Hallelujah they
[1:03:54] were following the message
[1:03:56] of a messenger that was reflecting a
[1:03:59] greater light but that would give them
[1:04:02] navigation Oh Glory from where they were
[1:04:06] to where he
[1:04:07] is and you won't find it without a star
[1:04:11] you won't find him without the messenger
[1:04:14] you won't meet Christ apart from the
[1:04:16] messenger or the agency that he employs
[1:04:19] on the earth to point you to where he is
[1:04:23] amen but they were traveling traveling
[1:04:25] TR and traveling and the light appears
[1:04:27] to be hanging over Jerusalem right now
[1:04:30] remember the the light was over in the
[1:04:32] west and they were coming from the East
[1:04:36] to find him and and and and he was all
[1:04:39] they
[1:04:40] wanted he was all they wanted they just
[1:04:42] wanted to to to find him Minister their
[1:04:45] gifts to Him worship Him He was the
[1:04:48] reason for it all he was the reason the
[1:04:50] Stars aligned and so then they they you
[1:04:52] know so so what I'm seeing in this
[1:04:54] brother Wade Jerusalem was somewhere
[1:04:57] along the
[1:04:58] way between where they were and where he
[1:05:03] was that's right but Jerusalem also
[1:05:06] happened to be the religious capital of
[1:05:08] the world of the Jewish faith that was
[1:05:12] looking for the coming of the Messiah
[1:05:13] the Fulfillment of the promises to
[1:05:15] Abraham so they get into the capital
[1:05:17] city you know surely it's here it's
[1:05:19] right there on the map lights hanging
[1:05:21] right over Jerusalem surely he's got to
[1:05:23] be there and that's where all the
[1:05:24] Scrolls that's where all the prophets
[1:05:26] it's that's where everybody that's
[1:05:28] looking for the Messiah that's their
[1:05:31] headquarters and they got in there and
[1:05:33] the star
[1:05:37] disappeared they got to the capital and
[1:05:40] there's a lot of there there's a
[1:05:43] Temple think about this friend there's
[1:05:45] the memories there's all the history of
[1:05:48] Israel all the great battles that been
[1:05:49] fought and one and God had come on the
[1:05:51] scene and King David and King Solomon
[1:05:54] and all these things all they had it all
[1:05:56] there that's right but when they got
[1:05:58] there they were still looking for him
[1:06:03] am where is he where is he born King of
[1:06:07] the Jews where is your king we know he's
[1:06:12] here we know he's on the earth his star
[1:06:15] has declared him the messenger did not
[1:06:18] come to declare he's coming he came to
[1:06:21] declare he is
[1:06:24] here where is he
[1:06:26] where is he and Herod heard this there's
[1:06:29] a King born on the Earth yeah there's
[1:06:32] another ruler there's another Power
[1:06:34] there's another Uprising there's another
[1:06:36] Dominion hey I want to know where he is
[1:06:38] too for a very different reason then
[1:06:42] they wanted to know he wanted to
[1:06:44] extinguish anything that was going to be
[1:06:47] a threat to his
[1:06:48] Empire so they all start asking around
[1:06:51] you know what they went back to the word
[1:06:55] they
[1:06:56] amen the Bible tells you and I've got it
[1:06:59] written down somewhere the Bible will
[1:07:00] tell you if you'll read
[1:07:02] it he consulted with the the the the
[1:07:05] priest and the
[1:07:07] scribes and they said well you know what
[1:07:10] we're going to go in our Scrolls and
[1:07:13] find out where this Messiah is supposed
[1:07:14] to be and when they went in the Scrolls
[1:07:16] they said he'll be born in Bethlehem of
[1:07:22] Judea they were
[1:07:24] close but they had found
[1:07:27] him the Magi followed what the heavens
[1:07:31] declared to them was his dwelling place
[1:07:33] on the earth hope you can follow this
[1:07:37] but it was the word that
[1:07:39] pinpointed his Dwelling
[1:07:42] Place not in Jerusalem and not in a
[1:07:45] stable at this point he was couple years
[1:07:48] old he was a young child he wasn't even
[1:07:51] in a stable any
[1:07:53] longer he wasn't a little infant
[1:07:55] drinking milk and eating his diapers
[1:07:57] changed he was a child now but the word
[1:08:02] pinpointed exactly where they would find
[1:08:05] him oh
[1:08:09] my now I want to I want to see this too
[1:08:13] and God help us if I don't get through
[1:08:14] this today I'll just stop somewhere and
[1:08:15] we'll pick it back up but I want you I
[1:08:18] want you to notice they all had an
[1:08:21] interest right Something's Happened on
[1:08:23] the earth we'd like to know what it is
[1:08:26] now now the the Magis or those wise men
[1:08:29] they were on a
[1:08:31] mission that was the whole reason they
[1:08:33] left their past yes
[1:08:36] sir that was the whole reason they left
[1:08:38] the what do they call those things the
[1:08:41] observatory they left the observatory
[1:08:44] representing the
[1:08:46] denominations they said we don't want to
[1:08:48] look from a
[1:08:49] distance we don't want to look at a at
[1:08:52] at at a Bible That's thousands of years
[1:08:55] old
[1:08:56] we want to know where he is we want to
[1:08:59] be joined with him we want to worship
[1:09:02] him we want to have an exchange we've
[1:09:05] got something Hallelujah to give him and
[1:09:08] we can't give it until we come into
[1:09:11] contact with him so they were on a
[1:09:14] mission and they were bound they were
[1:09:16] determined they' already left their
[1:09:18] homes their families their past their
[1:09:20] life their friends everything and they
[1:09:22] said we've left it all
[1:09:24] behind we don't care how far we have to
[1:09:27] travel we don't care what we have to
[1:09:29] give up we don't care what it involves
[1:09:31] as far as sacrifice or whatever the
[1:09:34] world thinks about us we will not be
[1:09:36] satisfied Hallelujah until we find
[1:09:41] him that was a
[1:09:43] revelation Revelation was driving
[1:09:47] them Amen brother and sister God put
[1:09:50] something in you that only he can
[1:09:54] fulfill amen and there's something in
[1:09:56] you that alone can fulfill God's desire
[1:09:59] for
[1:10:03] worship God will not be satisfied until
[1:10:06] you're back where you belong
[1:10:08] right in him so however far You' strayed
[1:10:12] or however dark or black your life may
[1:10:14] be amen he ain't even worried about that
[1:10:17] he's worried about getting you back and
[1:10:19] he's going to do whatever it takes to
[1:10:21] get you back because you fulfill him you
[1:10:25] are the missing part of himself amen and
[1:10:27] he cannot be complete without you back
[1:10:30] in
[1:10:32] him Hallelujah there's something drawing
[1:10:35] brother and sister it's beyond you it's
[1:10:38] beyond you you can't do it
[1:10:40] amen God have
[1:10:42] mercy but look at this they said we we
[1:10:45] we're going to keep going till we find
[1:10:47] him amen if he's not here we're getting
[1:10:51] out of this city and we're going to find
[1:10:53] him when they got out of the city the
[1:10:55] star
[1:10:56] reappeared and pointed him to the place
[1:10:58] where he was but now watch herod's
[1:11:01] attitude herod's attitude was well if
[1:11:05] you find
[1:11:06] him bring him to
[1:11:10] me isn't that the attitude of the make
[1:11:13] believer today well if it's
[1:11:16] true prove it to me
[1:11:20] yeah if it's true then what about all
[1:11:22] these websites yeah brother if it's true
[1:11:26] then what about this and what about that
[1:11:27] see you don't believe to begin with if
[1:11:30] you really believed you would forsake
[1:11:32] everything else until you find
[1:11:34] him but that was herod's attitude was
[1:11:37] well I'm going to stay right here I'm
[1:11:39] going to maintain my kingdom and my
[1:11:41] Affairs and all that I go I know I'm a
[1:11:43] king but if if there's another king
[1:11:45] that's supposedly rising up you bring
[1:11:47] him to me yeah and you you prove to me
[1:11:50] that he is who he says he is friend that
[1:11:52] he never got that
[1:11:54] proof he never became a Believer they
[1:11:58] never made the believer out of Herod
[1:12:00] that those Magis were and they said we
[1:12:03] don't have to bring him to us we're
[1:12:05] going to go to where he is we're not
[1:12:07] stopping until we find him
[1:12:11] amen friend I'm talking about
[1:12:14] Witnesses I'm talking about somebody who
[1:12:16] really is a witness amen they're not
[1:12:19] waiting for it to be brought to them on
[1:12:20] a silver platter they're going to go
[1:12:22] seek it out and search it amen until
[1:12:24] they find it to be the truth there's a
[1:12:28] difference oh
[1:12:31] my they were in the place where he was
[1:12:34] thought to be but discovered he wasn't
[1:12:38] there and when the chief priest says
[1:12:40] it's Matthew 2 4 and 4-6 that's where it
[1:12:43] describes when they consulted the word
[1:12:45] the word directed them to Bethlehem of
[1:12:49] Judea the word wasn't in Jerusalem it
[1:12:53] wasn't in a crib wasn't in a stable had
[1:12:55] matured and was being led by the Holy
[1:12:59] Ghost to bring it to its fulfillness now
[1:13:03] Christ is the revealed word of the
[1:13:06] hour in any age any period of time amen
[1:13:10] forever in history or even today Christ
[1:13:14] is the revealed word of the
[1:13:17] hour and the Holy Spirit was guiding the
[1:13:21] Lord Jesus amen even from infancy
[1:13:26] sir the Holy Spirit spoke to Joseph and
[1:13:28] Mary and said take him into
[1:13:31] Egypt until Herod is out of the
[1:13:33] picture it was protecting the life of
[1:13:36] the word amen it was protecting the word
[1:13:39] as it raised from infancy into its
[1:13:42] fullness into its maturity amen so the
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost will always guide the word or
[1:13:47] the Holy Ghost amen uh places the
[1:13:52] word where it
[1:13:54] belongs amen so um uh it wasn't in
[1:13:58] Jerusalem it wasn't in a crib it was it
[1:14:02] was in the home of Joseph and Mary and
[1:14:05] and the and and the the the the wise men
[1:14:07] found him there now now I want to go
[1:14:08] back to the scene and I I apologize I've
[1:14:12] been kind of jumping around is everybody
[1:14:13] all right amen let's let's uh I know
[1:14:16] what it was and maybe the Lord would
[1:14:17] just keeping me from it St John chapter
[1:14:21] 20 this is one of my favorite passages
[1:14:24] of scripture
[1:14:25] amen because I believe it shows us where
[1:14:28] we are
[1:14:29] today
[1:14:31] amen St John chapter 20 we'll just have
[1:14:34] a good Bible lesson today we're going to
[1:14:36] weave in some of the message amen sir
[1:14:39] the first day of the week I inan first
[1:14:42] one of uh St John 20 the first day of
[1:14:45] the week cometh Mary Magdalene
[1:14:50] early when it was yet
[1:14:52] dark to The Seer and seeth the stone
[1:14:56] taken away from the
[1:14:57] Seiler then she
[1:15:00] runneth and cometh to Simon
[1:15:03] Peter and to the other disciple whom
[1:15:06] Jesus loved that was
[1:15:09] John and saith unto them they have taken
[1:15:13] away the Lord out of the Seiler and we
[1:15:16] know not where they have laid
[1:15:18] him now Peter you know he was very
[1:15:23] Vigilant and very
[1:15:26] uh how do I want to say
[1:15:27] it uh he had a lot of
[1:15:30] energy when it came to defending
[1:15:33] Jesus this is a man who only days before
[1:15:36] had smoked the high priest servant's ear
[1:15:38] off and I'm guarantee you he wasn't
[1:15:39] aiming for his ear no he
[1:15:42] was but he was he was a vem supporter of
[1:15:47] Christ oh Lord I won't deny you oh not
[1:15:51] me Lord amen and he was very uh very
[1:15:54] energetic IC and very vocal but he
[1:15:57] lacked the
[1:15:59] wherewithal Amen to to uh uh to to carry
[1:16:03] through on his statements of Faith he
[1:16:07] made very bold declarations but he
[1:16:09] didn't have the wherewithal Amen to to
[1:16:11] carry through with it all he was he was
[1:16:13] needing something that's right but it
[1:16:16] was jesus'
[1:16:17] choice and sometimes that's probably the
[1:16:20] only thing that's keeping us is the fact
[1:16:22] that we were his
[1:16:23] choice and he don't make any bad ones
[1:16:27] praise the Lord oh my they see she they
[1:16:31] came early they told Peter they've taken
[1:16:32] him away so Peter therefore went forth
[1:16:36] and that other disciple and came to the
[1:16:38] Seer so they they they ran both together
[1:16:41] and the other disciple did outrun Peter
[1:16:45] and came first to The Seer and he's
[1:16:46] stooping down and looking and saw the
[1:16:49] linen clothes lying yet went he not in
[1:16:53] then cometh Simon Peter following him
[1:16:54] and saith unto uh and went into the
[1:16:57] supper and seeth the linen clothes
[1:17:00] lie amen there was some proofs that he
[1:17:02] had been there but he wasn't there but I
[1:17:06] don't want just the artifacts I want
[1:17:09] him yes
[1:17:14] sir and the napkin that was about his
[1:17:16] head not lying with the linen clothes
[1:17:18] but wrapped it together in a place by
[1:17:20] itself then went in also that other
[1:17:23] disciple which came first to the supper
[1:17:26] and he saw and
[1:17:30] believed now he
[1:17:32] believed okay he's not here he's gone
[1:17:36] he's not where we left him he's not in
[1:17:38] the last place he's not where we thought
[1:17:41] he ought to
[1:17:43] be so he he he he he he he believed what
[1:17:46] his eyes told him he believed what his
[1:17:49] five senses told him then went in that
[1:17:53] saw and believe verse 994 as yet they
[1:17:56] knew not the scripture right that he
[1:18:01] must Rise Again from the
[1:18:05] dead friends that's where real faith
[1:18:08] lies is when you're latched onto the
[1:18:12] word despite what your senses declare to
[1:18:15] you that'll come that'll go but that
[1:18:19] word is a constant and when your faith
[1:18:22] is anchored into that brother and sister
[1:18:25] you are Rock Steady nothing's going to
[1:18:27] shake you amen now watch this now we we
[1:18:32] all got to agree here today these are
[1:18:34] Jesus disciples this is not Judas this
[1:18:37] is the 11 other faithful disciples that
[1:18:39] he chose and gave him positions in his
[1:18:43] administration and and brother he don't
[1:18:45] make bad choices but watch what his
[1:18:47] disciples do and John and Peter were not
[1:18:50] the lowest they were probably the two
[1:18:52] you know most uh closest to him perhaps
[1:18:56] James Peter and John definitely were and
[1:18:59] the only one missing here is James watch
[1:19:01] this then the disciples went away
[1:19:04] again to their own
[1:19:07] home we're out of here don't know where
[1:19:10] he is no he's not here we're going home
[1:19:12] we're
[1:19:14] leaving it's over you
[1:19:18] know but I want to look at Mary cuz
[1:19:21] that's our
[1:19:23] type amen
[1:19:28] but Mary stood without at the supper
[1:19:31] weeping and as she wept she looked down
[1:19:35] she stooped down and looked into the
[1:19:39] supper and seeth two angels in
[1:19:44] white sitting the one at the head and
[1:19:48] the other at the feet where the body of
[1:19:50] Jesus had laid where were these angels
[1:19:54] only moments
[1:19:57] before John had just been there Peter
[1:20:01] had just been there Mary had even been
[1:20:03] there and there was no mention of
[1:20:06] angels but to the one who wouldn't go
[1:20:09] home come on to the one who wouldn't
[1:20:12] give
[1:20:15] up to the one who said I'm not here for
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:19] pastor I'm not here for his son I'm not
[1:20:23] here for the song leaders I'm not here

[1:20:38] here to give him something I came here
[1:20:41] because I prepared something for him yes

[1:20:48] anything more for me amen and she just
[1:20:51] kept going back amen she wasn't leave
[1:20:55] that tomb she wasn't going to leave that
[1:20:57] place she had a Zeal she had a
[1:20:59] determination she had something within
[1:21:02] her that said I want to see
[1:21:05] him I'm not going to be satisfied I'm
[1:21:08] not going to give up I'm not going to

[1:21:17] anything for me or not I just want to be
[1:21:20] with him
[1:21:21] again she saw angels
[1:21:25] she received a supernatural visitation
[1:21:29] to show him to show her where he
[1:21:32] was I believe he's that same Angel
[1:21:35] today I believe if you've got that
[1:21:38] determination brother and sister I
[1:21:39] believe if you've got that Zeal you've
[1:21:41] got that fervency and that's what you
[1:21:43] come to church that's what you come to
[1:21:45] worship God will send an
[1:21:48] angel God will send the power of the
[1:21:50] Holy Spirit God will send a messenger he
[1:21:53] may send two of them from North
[1:21:56] Carolina to say he's not dead he's not a
[1:21:59] memory he's not history he doesn't have
[1:22:02] to be a 10-year-old testimony he can be
[1:22:06] alive and real in your heart
[1:22:09] today God is still God he's still on the
[1:22:13] throne amen they said un her woman why
[1:22:16] weepest thou she said to them because
[1:22:19] they have taken away my Lord and I know
[1:22:23] not where they've laid him
[1:22:25] when she had thus said she turned
[1:22:26] herself
[1:22:27] back and saw Jesus
[1:22:30] standing saw Jesus
[1:22:32] standing and knew not that it was Jesus
[1:22:36] Jesus said unto her woman why weepest
[1:22:38] thou whom seekest
[1:22:41] thou and she supposing him to be the
[1:22:44] gardener said unto him
[1:22:47] sir if thou have borne him
[1:22:50] hence now she you know there was there
[1:22:53] was a rumor that he had been stolen
[1:22:56] there was such a thing as Grave
[1:22:58] robbers and for all she knows she's
[1:23:01] talking to
[1:23:02] someone who has stolen him
[1:23:05] away or moved him to another
[1:23:08] place right she said if
[1:23:11] you will tell
[1:23:13] me where you've laid him I'll take them
[1:23:18] away if you'll show me where he is I'll
[1:23:21] make him my responsibility amen
[1:23:25] amen if you'll show me where he
[1:23:28] is I'll take
[1:23:30] him
[1:23:32] myself if nobody else wants him I'll
[1:23:36] take
[1:23:37] him if nobody else wants to be
[1:23:40] identified with them I'll take them if
[1:23:43] everybody else is ashamed of them I'll
[1:23:46] take them if you'll just show me where
[1:23:48] he is I'll take him on my hands and I'll
[1:23:52] finish what I started when I came there
[1:23:55] this
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] morning there's some Mary somewhere that
[1:24:00] just wants to experience his presence
[1:24:03] one more time she don't care what the
[1:24:05] websites say she don't care about the
[1:24:07] history she don't care about the past
[1:24:10] she don't care about what his reputation
[1:24:11] is she knows what he did for her this is
[1:24:16] the marry that seven demons were cast
[1:24:19] out of and she said I know what I was
[1:24:22] before I met him

[1:24:29] thing for me he don't have to heal me he
[1:24:31] don't have to save me he don't have to
[1:24:33] do one more thing for
[1:24:35] me but I got something I want to do for
[1:24:40] him thank you
[1:24:43] Lord John and Peter were his chosen
[1:24:46] disciples and both loved him but neither
[1:24:49] of them had the Zeal or the
[1:24:53] determination that she had her attitude
[1:24:56] was
[1:24:57] this I came to see
[1:25:02] him I Came To Worship Him I have
[1:25:06] something to offer him and I'm not going
[1:25:10] to quit just because things didn't turn
[1:25:13] out like I
[1:25:16] expected I'm here yes for

[1:25:31] that'll go somewhere this approach this
[1:25:35] attitude this determination will get
[1:25:38] results when you're not doing it for
[1:25:41] what it does for you amen but instead
[1:25:44] you do it all for
[1:25:46] him when you do it all for him you'll
[1:25:49] experience something greater she didn't
[1:25:52] give up she didn't go home home she
[1:25:55] didn't go back to her old life Peter

[1:26:11] didn't hear amen she saw somebody the
[1:26:14] others didn't see she saw him the one
[1:26:17] who had freed her from Satan's change
[1:26:20] amen I'm sure one of the reasons she
[1:26:22] loved him so was she never
[1:26:25] forgotten what he'd done for her and
[1:26:28] that witness led her to a greater
[1:26:33] witness and that gave her a message a
[1:26:38] witness and responsibility to the
[1:26:43] others amen I'll pick it back up here
[1:26:47] she's supposing him to be the gardener

[1:35:55] unto you and when he had so said he
[1:35:58] showed unto them his hands and his side
[1:36:02] then were the disciples glad when they
[1:36:05] saw the Lord am then said Jesus to them
[1:36:09] again peace be unto you as my
[1:36:14] father hath sent
[1:36:17] me so sin I you am yeah now if you can't

[1:36:32] and with the same format that I was sent
[1:36:36] now you are being sent friend was there
[1:36:39] anything beyond his power come on
[1:36:41] now no he was God expressed in a body of
[1:36:46] Flesh and if he sent those disciples the
[1:36:49] same way he was sent and we're one of
[1:36:52] them today amen How can there be any
[1:36:56] difference there cannot be amen oh my I
[1:37:00] know I got to close but I don't want
[1:37:02] to even as my father had sent me so send
[1:37:06] I you and when he had said this he
[1:37:07] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[1:37:09] Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they
[1:37:13] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[1:37:15] sins you retain they are retained amen
[1:37:20] it was it was
[1:37:22] the amen it was the transfer amen of of
[1:37:26] his uh uh of his life his power and his
[1:37:29] authority he's now administering that to
[1:37:31] his
[1:37:32] disciples amen and he told them we know
[1:37:34] over in another gospel he said Terry ye
[1:37:36] in Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:37:40] power from on high that's right let me
[1:37:42] just find a few places I wanted to refer
[1:37:44] to we're bringing it to a close I want
[1:37:47] to show you the difference we've looked
[1:37:49] at Peter for a little bit this morning
[1:37:51] and brother bam is in a message called
[1:37:53] uh putting on the whole armor of God and
[1:37:55] he's he's talked about just he just been
[1:37:57] talking about how Peter had cut that
[1:37:59] high priest servant's ear off you know
[1:38:02] Peter wanted to prove he was a faithful
[1:38:05] disciple but every time the pressure was
[1:38:07] applied he he he yeah he he he
[1:38:13] disappeared so he didn't have it brother
[1:38:16] B said he could do he could say I belong
[1:38:20] to so and so I give you to understand
[1:38:22] but that wasn't what it was but when he
[1:38:25] seen the word manifested and denied it
[1:38:29] oh what a horrible thing that was but
[1:38:32] brother after Pentecost he went up and
[1:38:36] put on the whole armor of God he sure
[1:38:40] had courage then look at that same guy a
[1:38:44] Believer on Christ followed him hour by
[1:38:48] hour but he had only seen the word by
[1:38:51] letter he had only seen it manifested
[1:38:54] but now it was in Him Glory Hallelujah
[1:38:59] God's fiery word was burning in his own
[1:39:02] flesh what was it God in you amen Christ
[1:39:06] the hope of glory made manifest in a man
[1:39:08] in the church God know what he was doing
[1:39:11] yes sir it wasn't no more trust to this
[1:39:14] or trust to that or the other it was God
[1:39:16] himself then he stood up there and said
[1:39:18] ye men of Israel and ye that dwell in
[1:39:20] Judea heed my voice these are not drunk
[1:39:23] as you suppose this is that which was
[1:39:25] spoken by the prophet Joel it shall come
[1:39:27] to pass in the last days saith God I
[1:39:30] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:39:35] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:39:36] prophesy and upon my handmaids and made
[1:39:40] servants no intellectual about that he
[1:39:43] had something what was it he had put the
[1:39:46] whole armor of God on Amen not so much
[1:39:49] as the high priest dressed but he had
[1:39:51] something inside of him amen the armor
[1:39:54] of God comes inside the spiritual hidden
[1:39:59] power of God that the intellectual eye
[1:40:01] doesn't see at all am Jesus never did
[1:40:04] say did you see it he said did you
[1:40:06] believe
[1:40:07] it amen amen you love the Lord this
[1:40:12] afternoon friend I believe this
[1:40:15] afternoon I'm addressing some real
[1:40:17] Witnesses right real witnesses to the
[1:40:21] Resurrected manif Ed Christ the revealed
[1:40:25] word of this
[1:40:27] hour amen I I wanted to to deal with
[1:40:31] something very quickly how many
[1:40:34] believe the proof of the Resurrection
[1:40:37] was not an empty
[1:40:40] tomb the proof of the Resurrection was
[1:40:44] those 120 that came out of the upper
[1:40:47] room with his same life dwelling within
[1:40:51] what is the proof of this message is it
[1:40:55] the pictures is it the testimonies is it
[1:40:58] the artifacts or is it the people amen
[1:41:01] whose lives have been
[1:41:04] changed amen there has been a transfer
[1:41:08] there has been a transfer brother and
[1:41:10] sister the life has come from the page
[1:41:13] into the believer the prophet spoke it
[1:41:16] but there's an army that is stood
[1:41:18] up the prophecy went forth but it has
[1:41:21] called Witnesses am amen the the the the
[1:41:25] the sounding forth of the trumpet has
[1:41:28] called an echo to Echo back an amen to
[1:41:32] the trumpet sound amen is more than your
[1:41:34] statement your amen is your
[1:41:37] action so be it isn't a statement it's
[1:41:40] an action your action is saying Amen to
[1:41:44] the revealed word of this
[1:41:47] hour
[1:41:50] amen I will restore sayith the Lord L
[1:41:54] Hallelujah Glory praise be to God
[1:41:56] brother Brown was pretty Pentecostal one
[1:41:58] the four the fourth light is to come
[1:42:01] that will bring forth the same signs
[1:42:03] watch justification brought back the
[1:42:05] pulp sanctification brought back the
[1:42:07] bark the doctrine of Holiness what
[1:42:09] brought back the leaf Pentecostals what
[1:42:11] is it Pentecostal leaves clap their
[1:42:13] hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the
[1:42:16] fourth was the word
[1:42:20] itself he is
[1:42:22] risen he is risen from the dead the word
[1:42:26] made flesh fruits of the proof of the
[1:42:31] Resurrection sign that Christ has
[1:42:35] finally after justification been planted
[1:42:38] sanctification been planted baptism of
[1:42:40] the Holy Ghost and organizations died
[1:42:42] out and Christ has again centered
[1:42:45] himself like that cap of the pyramid sir
[1:42:49] first line justification sanctification
[1:42:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost then the
[1:42:52] coming of the cap what is it the Holy
[1:42:55] Ghost being honed out so that it can fit
[1:42:59] Oh Glory with the same kind of ministry
[1:43:03] that he had when he went
[1:43:05] away oh my friend I can't read it
[1:43:09] without getting excited that when he
[1:43:11] comes back it'll catch the whole thing
[1:43:15] in the Rapture where the Justified
[1:43:18] Sanctified and baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:20] that pyramid will stand again the house
[1:43:23] of of God will live again the tree of
[1:43:27] life is growing again praise the Lord I
[1:43:32] I looked up that word proof and what
[1:43:34] there's many definitions but one of them
[1:43:37] says a
[1:43:39] coin you know a coin is made by
[1:43:41] something that is
[1:43:43] stamped down they take a stamp and and
[1:43:46] stamp it down on metal and it forms that
[1:43:49] coin I I just uh was ministering
[1:43:51] Wednesday night over at a church in gast
[1:43:53] I gave the pastor there I pulled the
[1:43:56] change out of my pockets I'm a I'm an
[1:43:58] Apostolic preacher Silver and Gold Have
[1:44:00] I None but I had a little bit of loose
[1:44:02] change Brother Louis and I pulled out of
[1:44:04] my pocket and I had a 1946 wheat
[1:44:07] penny I said brother uh he's from Africa
[1:44:10] rich I said brother do you know what a
[1:44:11] wheat penny is he said I don't think
[1:44:12] I've ever heard of it I said a wheat
[1:44:14] penny is worth more than a
[1:44:17] penny it may say one cent on it but it's
[1:44:19] worth more than one cent and this was a
[1:44:21] 1946 week Penny then somebody told me
[1:44:24] said the reason they're worth more is
[1:44:25] because they're made of real copper
[1:44:27] right the pennies you have nowadays are
[1:44:30] an alloy of Cheaper metals that are
[1:44:33] given an an assigned value of one set
[1:44:36] but a wheat penny is real copper that's
[1:44:39] right amen so it's worth more than even
[1:44:42] a penny but they call one of the
[1:44:44] definitions of proof is a coin that is
[1:44:47] Struck from a highly polished diey on a
[1:44:51] polished planchet and is not intended
[1:44:55] for
[1:44:56] circulation that's right what do they do
[1:44:58] with that proof they frame it and put it
[1:45:00] on the wall and say that's a
[1:45:03] proof and sometimes differs in metallic
[1:45:08] content from coins of identical design
[1:45:12] struck for circulation right and I
[1:45:14] thought that sounds exactly like
[1:45:16] something Uncle Sam would
[1:45:18] do he would make a proof out of
[1:45:21] something valuable frame it and put it
[1:45:22] on the wall say that's a proof but Jesus
[1:45:24] didn't do
[1:45:26] that his are intended for
[1:45:30] circulation if you're the proof you need
[1:45:33] to circulate you need to be spent you
[1:45:37] need to be used you need to be poured
[1:45:39] out and you need to be refilled you need
[1:45:42] to be taken the message to your coworker
[1:45:45] to your husband to your wife to your
[1:45:47] family reunion you need to be
[1:45:49] circulated and you are not made of of a
[1:45:53] different
[1:45:54] material you are everything that he is
[1:45:59] he poured himself out brother and sister
[1:46:03] and you are the answer you are the proof
[1:46:05] and when you are tested you will react
[1:46:08] the same way he
[1:46:10] did Hallelujah now that's the proof of
[1:46:13] his
[1:46:14] resurrection as I live so shall you live
[1:46:17] also because I live you shall live also
[1:46:21] brother is that the proof you desire to
[1:46:23] be that's the proof I desire to be and

[1:52:26] believed what he said so I believe
[1:52:29] brother Tim believed what he said but I
[1:52:30] believe what he said also amen you know
[1:52:33] brother Tim there's a mystery
[1:52:36] yes and and and you you put a piece of
[1:52:39] the puzzle together that I've been
[1:52:40] looking for for a long
[1:52:43] time Mary Jesus's mother was not there
[1:52:50] right it was Mary Magdalene
[1:52:53] right right right she's the first person
[1:52:57] to see Jesus glorified yes
[1:53:01] sir he raised in his glorified body
[1:53:03] right amen if his mother had have been
[1:53:06] there she'd have known who he
[1:53:09] was cuz she saw him at 20 years old see
[1:53:11] I don't believe Jesus resurrected and
[1:53:13] looked 50 years old that's right I've
[1:53:16] always told him my God is not
[1:53:20] old amen my God's a young man if we're
[1:53:24] going to be 20 he's 20 and he ain't
[1:53:27] never changed he just took on a Corporal
[1:53:28] body so that he could what die for us
[1:53:32] but I believe when he come out of that
[1:53:33] tomb he didn't look like the Jesus that
[1:53:36] they knew that's right he looked like a
[1:53:39] young Gardener to Mary cuz Mary didn't
[1:53:41] see him at 20 years old his mama was the
[1:53:44] only one of that group that ever saw him
[1:53:46] at 20 years old the disciples that's why
[1:53:48] they couldn't believe it brother Solomon
[1:53:50] that's why they kept looking at Jesus
[1:53:52] the two from a mess they were they were
[1:53:54] Believers and he walked right there with
[1:53:56] them it wasn't so much that that Jesus
[1:53:58] changed their eyesight they were looking
[1:54:00] at a young
[1:54:03] man he didn't come out of that tomb
[1:54:06] old he come out of that tomb in at
[1:54:08] theophany body that stood and said let
[1:54:11] there be light and it wasn't an old god
[1:54:14] with an old stick you know and
[1:54:15] baldheaded and and gray my God ain't
[1:54:17] never been that way no you look at all
[1:54:20] the world though they depict him as that
[1:54:22] they depict him as an old man with a old
[1:54:24] beard you know uh-uh no if we going to
[1:54:27] have a youth
[1:54:30] camp we're going to have a youthful
[1:54:32] preacher there right called Jesus Christ
[1:54:36] he's never been old he got old because
[1:54:38] of
[1:54:39] you right he got old because of you and
[1:54:42] me but when he come out of that tomb he
[1:54:43] said all power amen and Heaven and Earth
[1:54:46] has been given unto me and then I'm
[1:54:49] going to give it to the bride to prove
[1:54:53] that he's not dead but he's alive and
[1:54:57] alive in a bride that I'm looking at
[1:55:00] today we're the only people that can
[1:55:02] respond to this most people just look at
[1:55:04] you like with this funny look on their
[1:55:07] face it's like brother Ram said they
[1:55:09] can't get him off the cross oh yeah we
[1:55:11] know Jesus died 2,000 years ago we know
[1:55:14] that that that he resurrected uh on on
[1:55:17] on Sunday morning back 2,000 years ago
[1:55:19] well what you doing for you now exactly
[1:55:22] amen right yes sir that's right Christ
[1:55:26] is the mystery of God revealed but where
[1:55:29] is Christ Paul said it's Christ in you
[1:55:33] the hope of glory that puts it all
[1:55:35] together you and I are little
[1:55:38] Messiahs you and I are the expression
[1:55:41] that God wanted before the foundation of
[1:55:43] the world he knew we'd be here he knew
[1:55:46] this light would cross your path and he
[1:55:48] knew you would respond to it one way or
[1:55:50] the other right amen still believe in
[1:55:52] predestination but I do believe in Free
[1:55:54] Will I believe you got a choice amen
[1:55:58] what is election God voted for you the
[1:56:00] devil voted against you you're the one
[1:56:02] that swings the vote two to one yeah
[1:56:04] you're the two to one on either side
[1:56:07] you're the tiebreaker you're the one
[1:56:08] that swings the boat so it's up to you
[1:56:11] today sir don't leave this place without
[1:56:14] knowing Jesus Christ don't leave this
[1:56:16] place without without without having the
[1:56:19] healing that you
[1:56:21] deserve the word that you deserve was
[1:56:24] given to you today
[1:56:27] amen the world don't deserve
[1:56:30] this oh we'd love to take it to them but
[1:56:33] they're not going to hear it that's
[1:56:34] right exactly but boy when somebody that
[1:56:38] knows the same daddy that the man's SP
[1:56:41] up standing up here talking about yes
[1:56:43] sir that same Daddy's inside of you the
[1:56:45] same man that stood here and talk to you
[1:56:46] was inside of you that's the way you
[1:56:48] respond
[1:56:50] yes you know brother Solomon you know
[1:56:52] how you know why we can read the Bible
[1:56:54] the way we read
[1:56:55] it cuz the one that wrote it's inside of
[1:56:58] you that's right so when you're looking
[1:57:00] down at it there's no mystery cuz your
[1:57:03] eyes he's looking through your eyes
[1:57:06] that's right we had an old brother here
[1:57:07] one time brother Sher and he said the
[1:57:10] devil would just beat on him and he said
[1:57:11] he'd open his Bible he said okay devil
[1:57:13] if you're going to beat on me he said me
[1:57:14] and you going to read the
[1:57:16] Bible me you going to read the Bible he
[1:57:18] said you look through these eyes we
[1:57:19] going to read this Bible right here and
[1:57:21] he said the dev would just go away from
[1:57:24] him he hates the word the devil hates
[1:57:26] the word of God and he hates it that you
[1:57:29] know what you're talking
[1:57:31] about he hates it he wants to keep us
[1:57:34] blind and keep us beat down no no no no
[1:57:38] amen listen this is not a cruise ship
[1:57:41] it's a battleship that's right we come
[1:57:44] with
[1:57:45] swords not spoons and forks we're fixing
[1:57:47] to go eat something with spoons and
[1:57:49] forks but you eat something with a sword
[1:57:51] today amen there was a sword pulled
[1:57:53] whatever you need whatever you need yes
[1:57:56] right here today there's a sword has
[1:57:58] been pulled yes and when there's a sword
[1:58:01] pulled there's a battle that's
[1:58:04] right whoever wins you know what brother
[1:58:06] R said he said he said you can take that
[1:58:09] uh to the enemy he said but it takes a
[1:58:11] strong arm of Faith that's right to jab
[1:58:15] it in there you can have the biggest
[1:58:17] sword in the world you can have the
[1:58:18] biggest you can have the biggest weapon
[1:58:19] in the world but if you don't know how
[1:58:21] to use it that's right right it's
[1:58:23] worthless you might kill more people
[1:58:25] than you know collateral damage than you
[1:58:27] if you didn't know what to do it but the
[1:58:28] bride knows what to do with the word
[1:58:30] right and when she draws a sword the
[1:58:33] devil ought to be shaking in his boots
[1:58:35] right cuz we know how to use it and we
[1:58:38] know where his heart is we know where
[1:58:40] his deception is remember brother Brown
[1:58:43] said we have Satan's answer right down
