[24:38] prophet to a group of people to destroy
[24:40] death and I truly believe that Lord and
[24:43] I pray that we would be the ones that
[24:44] see it Lord but if not somebody will we
[24:47] know that you already have that in your
[24:48] plan you it's already in the Plan of
[24:50] Redemption can't be changed you can't
[24:52] change your mind you knew this was what
[24:54] it was going to be and you knew who
[24:56] would be here Lord we're just preaching
[24:58] and praying Lord that that we just all
[25:00] rise up into that faith for the time
[25:04] that we need for the resurrection father
[25:06] just bless us in this service in Jesus
[25:08] name
[25:09] amen the Bible tells
[25:12] us in the beginning was the
[25:14] word the word was with God and the Word
[25:18] was God and that word was made flesh are
[25:23] we not hooked
[25:25] up and that word was made made flesh all
[25:28] right we know that was we know that was
[25:31] back in Jesus's day he was the word made
[25:34] flesh but now if that person is inside
[25:37] your
[25:39] flesh he's made your yes sir flesh the
[25:42] word of God you say oh no that no we
[25:45] ain't got far enough because this flesh
[25:46] right here's got to be changed by what
[25:48] the word of God all right so what's
[25:50] inside of you is the word and then it's
[25:53] being made flesh now and dwelt among us
[25:56] we come today to dwell among each other
[25:59] the word made flesh and we beheld his
[26:01] glory the GL the only begotten of the
[26:03] father full of grace and truth you go
[26:05] and be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[26:07] to the reading of the
[26:09] word John 3:3 I'll continue on Jesus
[26:13] answered and said unto him verily verily
[26:14] I say unto thee except a man be born
[26:16] again he cannot see or understand the
[26:19] kingdom of God I'm going to background
[26:21] just a little bit for for some of the
[26:23] ones that hadn't been here we believe in
[26:25] this church that we believe in
[26:27] justification ation sanctification and
[26:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the
[26:31] new birth all right not believing this
[26:33] message not having an emotion not having
[26:35] a come on
[26:37] somebody y'all can amen if you need to
[26:41] okay but he can't see the kingdom of God
[26:43] unless you're born again unless the
[26:45] spirit of
[26:46] God has come inside of you burnt your
[26:49] own nature out and put hisself inside of
[26:52] you that's the new birth all right
[26:56] because remember in this age we have
[26:57] anointed ones that can be anointed on
[26:59] your flesh and on your spirit realm and
[27:02] still be black in your soul die and go
[27:04] to hell that's right that's what the
[27:05] prophet said all right so we believe
[27:07] that the three stages takes you to the
[27:09] New Birth all
[27:11] right and I want to get get me and
[27:14] brother um who was the last one here
[27:17] brother George Quinn were talking about
[27:20] um people being saved and we covered
[27:23] this one time before there's a there's a
[27:24] group of people that's going to be saved
[27:27] all right believe on the Lord Jesus
[27:28] Christ and thou shalt be saved all right
[27:31] that's not
[27:33] bride that's that's beginning to be
[27:35] bride but that's not bride so there's
[27:37] going to be a group of people that say
[27:39] listen the world's going to have 10
[27:41] times a million times more people
[27:43] outside the city than they are inside
[27:45] that City cuz only the bride gets to
[27:48] live inside that City with 144,000 is
[27:50] everybody with me so there is a special
[27:52] group of people that that that God sent
[27:56] his son through him he told us you must
[27:59] be born
[28:00] again not you might or you might need to
[28:03] be no you must be to even see the
[28:05] kingdom of
[28:07] God so there's going to be a lot of
[28:09] people though that don't get the new
[28:10] birth cuz foolish version in the end
[28:13] time is a virgin of the word of God but
[28:15] just hadn't went any further our had
[28:17] some false teaching that just said oh
[28:19] just believe the message can't you press
[28:24] play I'm just me I'm just who I am so we
[28:27] part of this we part of the Bride but
[28:29] John 16:12 watch now he's going to
[28:32] separate this and when he separates it
[28:34] that's the reason we're going up to
[28:35] Statue of perfect man because only the
[28:38] holy ghost in your soul is going to take
[28:40] you up that statue of perfect man
[28:42] everybody with me that it's only the
[28:44] holy ghost in your soul because these
[28:45] are not the virtues of a human mortal
[28:48] man these are not the virtues of your
[28:50] DNA that come from your mom and daddy
[28:53] these come from your spiritual DNA from
[28:55] your soul working it it way out
[29:00] right so that we can display them and
[29:03] we'll talk about it this afternoon uh
[29:05] the psych service on adoption that's
[29:07] what we we are we are required we are uh
[29:10] and brother M tells us here in just a
[29:12] few minutes that your new birth and
[29:14] adoption is two different things I'm
[29:16] going to read you the quote we know
[29:19] that but sometimes the people in the
[29:21] message don't know that you receive the
[29:24] spirit of adoption but you are not
[29:26] adopted as soon as you come into to the
[29:27] you're a baby you don't know how to
[29:29] handle the word of God the Bible tells
[29:31] us Ezekiel said I'll give you a new
[29:32] heart and a new spirit and brother R
[29:35] tells us definitely that's not the
[29:37] spirit of
[29:38] God that's the spirit so you can get
[29:40] along with yourself or start getting
[29:41] along with God come to church read your
[29:43] Bible do those things and then I'll put
[29:46] my spirit inside of you all right now
[29:48] we've been through all these things but
[29:49] just
[29:50] background John 16:12 said I have many
[29:53] things to say unto you this is Jesus now
[29:55] but you cannot bear them now
[29:58] all right he didn't waste a lot of time
[29:59] telling them stuff that was going to be
[30:00] revealed because they didn't have the
[30:02] Holy Ghost all right the Holy Ghost
[30:04] wasn't given until the day of Pentecost
[30:05] right everybody that was anointing that
[30:07] was working during that time with
[30:09] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all those
[30:11] different ones and as brother uh was
[30:13] saying here you know he said there
[30:15] there's flaws like brother Bob said
[30:17] there's flaws in every one of them but
[30:18] if David would have had the new birth in
[30:20] his soul he would not have done what he
[30:22] did If Abraham had the new birth in his
[30:24] soul he would not have done what he did
[30:26] all right but that anointing under the
[30:28] blood of bulls and goats they'll be
[30:29] there they'll be in heaven amen right
[30:33] cuz that's the Old Testament but that's
[30:35] under bulls and goats which only covered
[30:36] sin it didn't do away with sin praise
[30:38] God in this time it's just like he was
[30:40] reading such were some of you but you're
[30:42] washed you wasn't washed by an animal's
[30:45] blood though come on you were Washed by
[30:47] the blood of a
[30:50] man the man Christ
[30:52] Jesus and that way he could wash you out
[30:55] and that he's the only one that can
[30:56] impart his soul into your
[31:01] soul that was the problem with with Adam
[31:03] Adam thought he could save
[31:05] Eve he couldn't save
[31:08] Eve he wasn't a savior but it was a type
[31:12] of the Savior coming on down here in
[31:16] 8030 and all the different things and
[31:17] preaching the Ser preaching the message
[31:19] for three and a half years to take a
[31:21] bride out of a group of people so the
[31:24] bride is what we're talking about today
[31:26] there are groups of other people that's
[31:27] going to be saved and and like I said
[31:29] they're going to fill this Earth
[31:30] completely full but there's only going
[31:32] to be a certain group inside that City
[31:34] all right cuz I'm going to read it to
[31:35] you in a minute brother Brown says there
[31:37] be there's Brides brides churches Brides
[31:38] but they'll come one that's right
[31:40] remember God had to divorce many people
[31:43] many groups Israel in the Old Testament
[31:45] he had to put her away brother R said he
[31:47] put the Baptist away he put the
[31:48] Methodist away why CU he was married to
[31:51] them at one time they had the truth at
[31:52] one time Wesley was a church age
[31:55] messenger he had had the truth but not
[31:58] all he had partial Truth All right so
[32:01] we're coming to a place to where as
[32:03] brother Ram said all the Loose Ends will
[32:05] be tied up all right and as brother
[32:07] George was I know y'all know that that
[32:09] was my favorite quote too where brother
[32:10] George was said the m j Malachi 4 will
[32:13] come to do two things number one turn
[32:15] the hearts of the children back to the
[32:17] fathers back to right
[32:19] here and then reveal the seven Thunders
[32:22] which are contained in the Seven Seals
[32:24] these divinely reveal mystery truths
[32:26] what to a group of
[32:29] people not to the world not to a
[32:31] denomination not to an idea but to you
[32:33] and
[32:35] me he'll bring that word and it'll make
[32:38] you make you
[32:41] absolutely be these virtues if you'll
[32:43] just yield yourself to it but remember
[32:46] we preaching the other day brother R
[32:47] said the Holy Holy Ghost is timid even
[32:49] the Holy Ghost you got inside of you is
[32:50] timid right read the sermon doors and
[32:53] doors brother Brown said once you let
[32:56] God in he said there still
[32:58] doors now you know how I feel about it
[33:00] if I was a holy ghost brother Mark I'd
[33:02] be going what's behind that door I got
[33:05] to quit doing
[33:06] that but what's behind that door no the
[33:09] Holy Ghost stands in front of the door
[33:11] he said if you want to let me in you let
[33:13] me in if you don't then but you're not
[33:16] going to live a fulfilled life you're
[33:18] not going to live a life that's that's
[33:21] mandated for this church age all right
[33:23] not another age this age right
[33:25] here Jesus said how be it he he the
[33:29] person the spirit of Truth is come he
[33:31] will guide you into all
[33:34] truth amen it didn't say a little
[33:38] bit it said all
[33:40] Truth for he shall not now see is what
[33:43] we was talking about the other day for
[33:44] he shall not speak of himself you know
[33:46] why cuz when he comes here he's speaking
[33:49] to
[33:50] you the voice now is in the bride he's
[33:54] speaking of his bride everybody knows me
[33:59] but they also know June and June's my
[34:00] bride and she's the one I want you to
[34:02] give all the accolades to not me for
[34:04] putting up with me she does a lot gets a
[34:06] lot of accolades from all of y'all that
[34:08] know me sister Regina
[34:10] says thank you sister bless your
[34:17] heart we're
[34:19] humans but he shall not speak of himself
[34:22] in other words we know one thing for
[34:23] sure Jesus is not here right now in
[34:26] corporal body he's not here right now so
[34:29] where is he if he's here he's in his
[34:31] bride he's not a spook that floats
[34:34] around he's inside of you and when your
[34:36] hand moves God hands
[34:38] move so whatsoever he shall hear that
[34:41] shall he speak and he will show you
[34:43] things to come praise God brother Ram
[34:44] said Revelation is the greatest thing
[34:47] that a bride can get the most powerful
[34:50] thing we have in our hands today is the
[34:52] true revelation of one God the true
[34:55] Revelation there's no eternal hell the
[34:57] true Revelation that we don't have to
[34:59] stand a
[35:00] judgment the true Revelation that that
[35:03] in the end time we're just not going to
[35:05] die and then not wake somebody to get us
[35:07] back up somebody in this age is going to
[35:09] get us out of the
[35:11] ground death will be destroyed in a
[35:14] group of people brother Brown says look
[35:16] you must be born again 1961 you're still
[35:19] what you are until actually you're
[35:21] actually born again of the spirit of God
[35:23] what mean he says it doesn't change you
[35:25] what your Creed coming to church reading
[35:27] your Bible on that don't change
[35:31] you hallu the new birth is an experience
[35:35] something that you experience something
[35:37] that takes place all right inside of you
[35:41] not just an emotion that can you know
[35:43] you'll be here one day and down here the
[35:45] next we have enough of that in the
[35:46] spirit realm but in your soul today you
[35:48] should know that you know that you know
[35:50] that there's something down in there
[35:52] motivating you besides what was out in
[35:54] the world as brother Bob was reading all
[35:56] those different things that Paul had in
[35:58] his
[35:58] congregation come on Paul was preaching
[36:01] that was his congregation that that
[36:02] brother Rob was talking about he said
[36:04] such for some of
[36:06] you but there's a way
[36:08] out you've been washed not by regular
[36:12] water you've been washed by what the
[36:13] water of the word which brother R now
[36:16] tells us that's the bleeding word so
[36:18] it's a bleeding word of God that we have
[36:21] in the end
[36:23] time and brother Brown tells us the
[36:26] reason we're going to have to get back
[36:27] to this statue of perfect man is because
[36:29] man has got
[36:31] involved all right so now remember this
[36:34] Christ in the true church is a con
[36:35] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[36:38] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[36:40] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[36:42] church
[36:44] church and defile it make it lukew
[36:48] formal and
[36:49] Powerless remember that word dunamis is
[36:53] the power that Jesus said we should have
[36:55] and that we would have on day of
[36:57] Pentecost it was taken away from the
[36:59] church or eroded by man's ideas I'm
[37:02] saying probably most in the message too
[37:05] they've diluted this thing down to where
[37:06] you can't even follow it
[37:08] anymore somebody say Amen cuz it is you
[37:11] we we fight it all the time all right
[37:14] now here's Jesus in John 17 now now
[37:17] there's a a Lord's
[37:18] Prayer which is for
[37:21] everybody all right that's okay this
[37:24] prayer Jesus was getting ready to go to
[37:27] the
[37:28] cross this is actually spoken Around The
[37:31] Garden of Gethsemane
[37:33] time and he's praying to the father
[37:35] about a group of people not the world
[37:39] cuz watch for I have given unto them The
[37:42] Words which thou gavest me and they have
[37:46] received them and have known surely that
[37:48] I came out from thee and they have
[37:50] believe that thou did send me now listen
[37:53] that wasn't the them 12 that was sitting
[37:55] there in front of
[37:59] they didn't understand who he was and
[38:01] one of them was
[38:02] Judas they didn't understand but after
[38:05] the Holy Ghost fail he did but he's
[38:06] praying a prayer in the future
[38:10] yes
[38:12] amen I pray for them I pray not for the
[38:17] world I'm reading the Bible but for them
[38:21] which thou Hast given me the children of
[38:25] God the progeny the Genesis 12627 of God
[38:30] we'll get into that in just a second I
[38:32] pray not for the world for them which
[38:34] thou has given me for they are thine and
[38:37] all
[38:38] mine are
[38:41] thine and thine or mine cuz it's the
[38:44] same person wait a minute and I'm
[38:47] glorified in you
[38:50] father oh it says I am glorified in
[38:55] them h
[38:57] right and now I am no more in the world
[38:59] in other words I'm getting ready to
[39:01] leave but these this group of people are
[39:06] in the world now he didn't pray to get
[39:08] us out of the world he prayed to keep
[39:09] the world out of
[39:11] us and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[39:13] through thine own name Those whom thou
[39:16] Hast given me that's why the name had to
[39:17] be restored in the end time amen we
[39:20] don't just baptize the name of the Lord
[39:21] Jesus Christ because brother R said do
[39:23] it it was already in the
[39:25] Bible okay all these major doctrines
[39:27] were already in the Bible we just
[39:29] couldn't see them because it took a
[39:30] prophet to unveil our eyes all right
[39:33] everybody with me cuz I know a lot of
[39:34] people said in here were
[39:36] trinitarians yes you were well I wasn't
[39:40] cuz I was
[39:42] nothing yeah me and you keep through n
[39:46] own thine own name Those whom thou Hast
[39:49] given me that they may be one yes now
[39:52] this is Jesus he can't lie right
[39:55] whatever he says the word of God
[39:57] God cuz he is a word of God this is not
[40:00] secondhand information this is not
[40:02] number two talking to number
[40:05] one that
[40:07] they may be
[40:10] one as we are now how was he in the
[40:13] father
[40:17] one I told you before in this message we
[40:20] are the biggest tunist people you ever
[40:21] seen in your
[40:24] life there's Jesus and there's this and
[40:27] there's that and he's coming and oh he's
[40:30] here no he's you
[40:33] yes he said that they may be one now how
[40:37] was him and the father one it wasn't two
[40:39] separate people that's right as we are
[40:42] yes while I was with them in the world I
[40:45] kept them in thy name praise God Amen
[40:48] and those that thou givest me I have
[40:49] kept praise God and none of them is lost
[40:53] except the son of predition that the
[40:55] scripture might be full F now watch and
[40:57] now come I to thee in other words he's
[40:58] leaving the the Corporal body
[41:00] everything's getting ready to leave but
[41:02] he's not leaving in the way we say leave
[41:05] cuz the world saw him leave and they
[41:07] don't know where he's at today we do and
[41:11] these things I speak in the
[41:13] world that they might have my joy
[41:17] fulfilled in
[41:19] themsel he put it right back to me and
[41:23] you that Soul inside of you never had a
[41:27] day that's all inside you never had a
[41:29] bad thought if you're born again today
[41:31] you are God made manifest in another
[41:33] form called a bride so you can't be
[41:37] lost our bad day is in our spirit realm
[41:40] and our flesh just manifest what that is
[41:43] cuz remember God can't change his mind
[41:45] if he ever loved you before the
[41:46] foundation of the world he can never
[41:48] unlove you don't ever tell me say oh God
[41:51] don't love me I'm going through all no
[41:52] that's a
[41:54] lie he loves you you just need to try to
[41:57] love him
[41:59] back John 17: 19 yeah I'm kind of
[42:02] preaching today sorry about that and for
[42:04] their sakes look for their sakes I
[42:06] sanctify myself yes could have had a
[42:09] wife brother Brown said could have had
[42:11] all these different things because he's
[42:12] a human man but he set himself aside so
[42:15] that he could be what an example of the
[42:17] statute of perfect man he is the statute
[42:19] of perfect man not an example he is that
[42:22] that they also might be Sanctified
[42:23] through the what through the truth
[42:26] neither pray I for these alone now
[42:30] watch but for them also which Shall
[42:33] Believe on me through their word now
[42:35] that's another group of
[42:37] people that's bringing another group of
[42:39] people in all right that they all may be
[42:42] one now when we all get to Glory when we
[42:44] all get over there in the in the new
[42:46] city we're going to be in the city
[42:48] millions are going to be outside but
[42:49] praise God they got eternal life just
[42:51] like you do all right even a cup of
[42:54] water in my name they'll be given
[42:55] eternal life but I don't want to stand
[42:57] at the white Throne judgment and be
[42:59] judged by my words or that I gave
[43:01] brother Donnie a glass of water and hope
[43:04] that's going to help me
[43:06] no no if you have the new birth today
[43:09] you're already judged how can the judge
[43:12] judge a
[43:13] judge if he's a righteous judge and he's
[43:15] inside of
[43:16] you that's where your judgment comes
[43:19] your judgment comes right
[43:20] here that's why it is a it is imperative
[43:24] that we come to church that we listen to
[43:27] a five-fold Ministry you can't get it
[43:29] out
[43:32] there oh you can get parts of it but
[43:35] you'll never come to that statue of
[43:36] perfect man without somebody looking you
[43:37] in the face and saying you ain't doing
[43:39] this right right or you are doing this
[43:42] right and we praise
[43:44] God that they all may be one as thou
[43:47] father art in me and I in thee that they
[43:50] also may be one what one in us that the
[43:55] world May believe that thou has sent me
[43:58] yes and the glory which thou gavest me I
[44:01] have given
[44:03] themen that's why Paul picked that up
[44:05] Paul wasn't standing there but by the
[44:07] Holy Ghost Paul picked that up and in
[44:08] Romans he said we're hirs yes and join
[44:12] HS with Christ join HS I I brother um
[44:16] hild debrand God bless his
[44:18] soul brother Harold he preached years
[44:21] and years ago and he said whatever God
[44:24] gets whatever Jesus gets you
[44:27] get if you're joint airs he said it's
[44:29] not like this he said you have joint
[44:32] Airship if this is Christ and this is
[44:34] you you get join Airship because of this
[44:37] right here all right cuz you're his yes
[44:41] that they may be one even as we are one
[44:43] that's the second time he said that in
[44:46] this prayer oh we're going to get to a
[44:50] third part right here I in
[44:52] them and thou in me is that two or three
[44:55] people running around
[44:56] no one that they may be what made
[45:02] perfect in
[45:05] one the world may and that the world may
[45:07] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[45:10] them look as thou Hast loved me there's
[45:14] your joint Airship again yes God canot
[45:18] love you that's right
[45:23] right brother R sh on the first seal
[45:27] we know one thing's for
[45:29] sure the brother Ry on that first seal
[45:31] when it opened it was contrary to a lot
[45:34] what he had already preached everybody
[45:35] with
[45:37] me don't get quiet on me he said he
[45:41] would have made a horrible mistake if
[45:42] he' had preached the notes that he had
[45:44] he said on the second third and fourth
[45:47] seal he said this is far beyond what I
[45:49] thought it was cuz he thought the souls
[45:51] under the altar were
[45:52] Christians he thought the wild horse
[45:54] rider was and the or was the Holy Ghost
[45:56] he preached Mighty conquer in
[46:01] 1959 progressive
[46:03] revelation he was brother rown was going
[46:05] through that Revelation and when he gets
[46:07] to the seals though he sees that first
[46:09] seal open and he's like I better be
[46:12] quiet and listen to what this Angel's
[46:15] telling me amen cuz I made a horrible
[46:18] mistake he just jumped down and preached
[46:20] it and it would have been wrong yes
[46:22] sorry about that but it's what he said
[46:26] but now watch this seal though is broken
[46:28] not to the world come on that's right
[46:32] now it's the greatest week of sermon
[46:35] since Jesus walked on the face of this
[46:37] Earth no doubt cuz he's the one that
[46:41] came and spoke it he said here stands a
[46:44] lamb with a book in his hand now where
[46:45] where was he pointing over there no he
[46:48] said here stands a lamb and there goes a
[46:50] white horse rider in other words
[46:52] something was riding off a a revelation
[46:54] that he didn't need
[46:56] was riding away but now watch what he's
[46:57] doing now watch he's he's been talking
[46:59] about church he talks about church and
[47:01] bride's whole sermon all right and then
[47:03] all back before church and then bride
[47:05] but watch he comes down to the opening
[47:07] the seals he said oh there's a different
[47:09] group of people
[47:11] here I've been preaching church and
[47:13] bride together he's fixing to separate
[47:14] it right here all right broken to who
[47:18] not to Christ but to the church now
[47:19] watch what he does but to the church
[47:21] notice now and he
[47:24] stops he's says oh my that just makes me
[47:27] tremble what he got a
[47:29] revelation right there I I I I hope the
[47:32] church truly understands it see what I
[47:34] mean you people I'm going to call you
[47:37] bride see that you'll understand so only
[47:40] the bride is going to understand the
[47:42] opening of these
[47:43] seals and even the bride that was there
[47:47] didn't understand them I'll read you a
[47:49] quote in just a
[47:50] minute and this is my quote never since
[47:53] Jesus Christ was on this Earth has Satan
[47:55] had such a form able opponent as the
[47:56] bride sitting right here today and the
[47:58] bride around the world brother BR said
[48:00] we have Satan's answer that was in the
[48:02] 60s we ought to be mature enough to have
[48:04] his answer now where he won't know what
[48:07] to do with us or how to or how to deal
[48:09] with
[48:11] us brother Ramy 1965 the rising of the
[48:14] sun now he continues now this is after
[48:16] the seals but he's the seals have been
[48:18] opened so he knows there's a bride and
[48:21] he knows there's a church cuz there's
[48:23] been churches churches look Bri Brides
[48:26] brides churches Brides brides
[48:30] wow but there has to come
[48:33] what Hallelujah there has to come a real
[48:37] bride now not the other ones were false
[48:39] they just didn't have all the
[48:41] Revelation there must come one that not
[48:43] only has got the mechanics but the
[48:45] Dynamics of it makes that church live
[48:48] moving the power of's Resurrection until
[48:50] we come to that place until we find that
[48:53] place look so you got to find it right
[48:56] it's not
[48:58] automatic until we find that place sir
[49:01] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[49:04] that's right amen Hebrews 4:12 for the
[49:07] word of God is quick and powerful and
[49:09] sharper than any two-edged sword
[49:11] piercing what now the word so the word
[49:14] of God in power is what separates things
[49:18] yes the word byself there's not it it's
[49:21] dead letter like I said the other day
[49:24] cheapest thing you can do is take a
[49:25] white piece of paper and put Black Ink
[49:27] on it that's cheapest thing you can
[49:29] do but you make that live that's on that
[49:33] page yes sir the devil can't do anything
[49:35] with that for the word of God is quick
[49:38] and powerful and sharper than any
[49:39] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[49:41] dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit so
[49:43] God sent us a prophet to divide the soul
[49:46] from the spirit and of the joint marrow
[49:49] which is your flesh amen and is the
[49:52] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[49:54] the heart so let's break this down just
[49:55] for a minute I know we've been through
[49:58] this before but let's just background
[49:59] for a minute let's look at the soul you
[50:02] have a soul you are a person everybody
[50:04] that's born from a womb has a soul yes
[50:07] right that is a human all right now
[50:10] animals do not we know that and thank
[50:12] God the brother Ram told us that that's
[50:13] right that they have a nature and
[50:15] they're part of Nature and and but they
[50:17] don't have a soul to discern good from
[50:19] Evil that's right all right we have a
[50:21] soul and that soul is what to do to for
[50:23] you to come to the age of account
[50:25] ability and discern right from wrong
[50:27] good from Evil all right so Genesis 126
[50:30] you know that's all of you know that's
[50:32] my favorite scripture genis 126 is where
[50:35] let us make man in our own image here we
[50:37] go back to the same man come on I just
[50:40] got this that's the same man that was
[50:43] talking to us in John
[50:45] 17 he was talking about that Genesis one
[50:49] man not Genesis 2:7 Genesis
[50:52] 126 at Genesis let us make man and our
[50:55] own image right and after our likeness
[50:59] and let him have dominion over the fish
[51:01] of the sea and foul of the air
[51:03] everything that creep is on the
[51:06] earth God
[51:08] said let us make man our own image God
[51:11] said you're perfect God said you're
[51:13] blessed before he put you in
[51:15] flesh this is before flesh this is in
[51:19] the mind of God this is the Genesis 126
[51:21] man that's in the mind of God before the
[51:23] foundation of the world and when took
[51:25] that Genesis 126 man and put it in the
[51:28] 27 man he knew Adam was going to fall
[51:31] yes he
[51:32] did but to make his plan and purpose
[51:35] work out he had to let that happen cuz
[51:38] you know why God wanted hisself in human
[51:45] flesh we're not going to live we're not
[51:47] going to be Iron and
[51:49] Steel our new body which is this body
[51:52] made new yes our glorified body
[51:56] is not going to be Iron and Steel it's
[51:57] going to be flesh you are going to have
[52:00] flesh cuz you are a
[52:03] human that Genesis 1:26 man is that
[52:06] picture that God took of you before the
[52:07] foundation of the world when you were 18
[52:09] to 20 years old
[52:13] right y'all think about the other day
[52:15] when Billy Paul passed
[52:16] away there's another Vision
[52:20] fulfilled I was reading it yesterday day
[52:22] before yesterday brother brandom on the
[52:24] Buckboard riding with either one of them
[52:26] hope or whichever one he was riding with
[52:27] and he pulls up to this beautiful
[52:31] woman his daddy she said he said who are
[52:34] you she said I'm Sharon Rose I'm your
[52:36] daughter said I'm waiting here for who
[52:38] Billy Billy that was in another
[52:42] dimension so that Vision has been
[52:44] fulfilled she ain't got to wait on Billy
[52:46] no more Billy's
[52:49] there we're getting close to the end
[52:51] folk yes
[52:53] sir if you don't feel the pull the end
[52:55] time I mean they got one and we got one
[52:59] pull the end time like brother Bob said
[53:00] pulling you away from everything that's
[53:02] Godly but there is a God that's pulling
[53:04] you John 17 said it was he's pulling you
[53:07] toward him back into what Fellowship
[53:11] like it was back in the Book of Genesis
[53:13] before the fall happened praise the Lord
[53:16] that's what he wanted he wanted you in
[53:18] human flesh we didn't come here in human
[53:20] flesh by mistake no sir no sir and
[53:23] that's I've said many times before your
[53:24] flesh don't sin right your flesh is born
[53:27] in sin it's dying because of that but
[53:31] your flesh only does what the inside
[53:33] Gody tells it to
[53:35] do so don't blame it why it's just my
[53:37] flesh I'm just human now there's
[53:39] something inside of you that could be
[53:40] different and it can motivate you to
[53:43] what you used to look at you don't look
[53:45] at no more that's right brother
[53:49] amen same hand that used to hold a beer
[53:52] now it holds a Bible same one amen where
[53:55] was it washed not this wasn't changed
[53:57] this was changed that's why the new
[53:59] birth is important most important thing
[54:01] you'll ever get and hold on
[54:05] to cuz Satan hates to lose people he
[54:08] hates to lose his subjects he feels
[54:11] comfortable inside of you if you're not
[54:13] born again I don't even want him
[54:15] comfortable in this
[54:18] building I want him to be the most
[54:20] uncomfortable person
[54:23] ever cuz when he goes to Lake of Fire he
[54:26] will be the most uncomfortable person
[54:28] ever and I hope that cancer demon
[54:30] sitting right in his head on his head
[54:32] amen I hate that thing Grace and peace
[54:35] be multiplied un you through the
[54:36] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[54:39] according to his divine power we've been
[54:40] through this before but just bear with
[54:42] me trying to get everybody caught up
[54:44] according as his divine power now listen
[54:46] you have nothing inside of you that's
[54:47] Divine without God that's right you can
[54:50] call the Divine Miss whoever or Mr
[54:52] whoever or whatever they're not Divine
[54:53] only one Divine person that's God but
[54:55] now when he puts himself inside of you
[54:57] come on John 17 says then we become
[55:01] one according as his divine power hath
[55:04] given unto us all things that pertain to
[55:06] life and godliness through the knowledge
[55:08] of him that has called us to glory and
[55:09] virtue you got to be called whereby are
[55:12] given unto us exceeding great and
[55:14] precious promises brother Bob was
[55:15] reading this this morning look that by
[55:17] these brother R said these promises you
[55:19] might be partakers of that divine
[55:22] nature that is the divine nature of God
[55:25] yes it is having escaped praise godall
[55:29] having escaped the corruption that is in
[55:31] the world through
[55:32] lust now that word divine is Theos
[55:35] godhead of Christ spoken of the one true
[55:38] only
[55:39] true only and true God now watch look
[55:42] whatever can in any respect be likened
[55:45] to God
[55:49] Amen second John
[55:52] 17 Romans 8 ver14 for as many there are
[55:55] led by the spirit of God they are the
[55:56] sons of God this is Paul preaching he's
[55:58] beginning to tell us how to come to
[56:00] adoption he's beginning be but you got
[56:02] to be born again first I'll read your
[56:04] quote here in a few minutes your new
[56:05] birth is not your adoption right it's
[56:09] separate listen you can have I I'm going
[56:11] to say it again you can be born again
[56:13] and not be
[56:15] adopted but you can't be adopted and not
[56:17] get born
[56:20] again pretty simple you cannot live this
[56:24] without the guy that is that living
[56:26] inside of
[56:29] you you just act like you own s for you
[56:35] have not received the spirit of bondage
[56:37] again to fear but look but you have
[56:39] received the spirit of
[56:41] adoption but remember adoption is not
[56:45] crying so this whoever this whatever
[56:48] this part of your journey or the plan is
[56:51] get born again and you'll receive the
[56:53] spirit of adoption in other words puts
[56:55] you in the family we'll talk about this
[56:57] afternoon listen just like brother
[56:59] Dale's always said God's not going to
[57:02] adopt Satan's
[57:03] kids he adopts his own children but you
[57:06] got to be in the family if you're not
[57:08] born again you're not in the family
[57:10] that's
[57:11] right but you have received the spirit
[57:13] of adoption whereby we
[57:16] cry daddy daddy amen when we first get
[57:20] born
[57:21] again it's a new thing cuz it talks
[57:24] about a new creation a new creature your
[57:29] old
[57:30] nature remember you that's why you can't
[57:33] divorce it brother Brown said or hang it
[57:34] up in the closet it's got to die cuz if
[57:37] you don't it's going to come back every
[57:38] time it's going to raise up every
[57:43] time but when the thing's dead see when
[57:47] it's dead ain't going to bother
[57:49] you CU remember we're dead in
[57:53] Christ we died in
[57:56] him but we receive the spirit of
[57:58] adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy the
[58:00] spirit itself bearing witness with our
[58:02] spirit that what that we are are the
[58:04] children of God yes look and if children
[58:07] here's Paul picking up the thought from
[58:08] John 17 and if children then HS HS of
[58:12] God and join HS with Christ listen when
[58:15] Jim's mother passed away she didn't
[58:17] invite Gary CR to come to the F to the U
[58:20] you know the lawyer didn't send brother
[58:21] Gary CR raise your hand up I'll tell who
[58:23] you are that Brother Gary CR
[58:25] they they didn't I don't know why I did
[58:28] that I know you hate that but I'm sorry
[58:29] I'm sorry you'll get used to it you'll
[58:31] get used to
[58:35] it I'm not saying nothing
[58:38] else but anyway the lawyer did not call
[58:42] Brother Gary CR to come to our uh to not
[58:46] our but their
[58:48] family you know reading of the well
[58:52] right did you get one brother Dy oh why
[58:56] why didn't you get one you wer part of
[58:59] the
[59:00] family only family members get to come
[59:03] to the reading of the well unless
[59:05] there's some circumstance where you like
[59:07] somebody else you want give them
[59:08] something else but today we have come to
[59:10] what we have come to read will yes cuz
[59:13] his will is his word this is the will
[59:15] this is what we get open it up and read
[59:18] it
[59:19] sometime or by the foolishness of
[59:21] preaching let him tell you about it
[59:23] sometime and if children then HS HS of
[59:26] God and join HS with Christ why he calls
[59:28] us today to this reading of the well
[59:31] because we're the children of God if
[59:33] you're not you're sitting close to one
[59:36] so just receive the spirit of God if so
[59:39] be that we suffer with him that we may
[59:41] also be glorified together so what he
[59:43] put that in there that we're HS and
[59:45] Joint HS with Christ we're in the family
[59:48] we're his kids now we know we were
[59:50] before the foundation of the world but
[59:51] listen you were lost when you got here
[59:53] yes sir they was nothing holy about you
[59:56] that's right they was nothing holy about
[59:58] me and what did Bob just read Hallelujah
[1:00:00] brother Bob said some of you were what
[1:00:02] hor
[1:00:03] mongers
[1:00:05] effeminate boy just read that whole
[1:00:07] list such for some of you well that
[1:00:09] ain't Holy Ghost filed people they are
[1:00:11] now but they weren't then that's why the
[1:00:15] new birth is God coming inside your soul
[1:00:17] and burning that thing
[1:00:19] out
[1:00:21] Hallelujah and you become a new creature
[1:00:24] am yes sir why we believe in the new
[1:00:26] birth in this church more than anybody
[1:00:28] you'll ever hear we believe in an
[1:00:31] experience with
[1:00:34] God 1 Peter 2 vers1 says wherefore
[1:00:37] laying aside all malice and G now we're
[1:00:38] still on the new birth we're still in
[1:00:40] the soul cuz listen your new birth is in
[1:00:42] your soul yes you don't get a new birth
[1:00:45] in your spirit you get a new birth in
[1:00:46] your soul then your spirit then is what
[1:00:49] it is motivated by the soul to live
[1:00:52] these virtues all right cuz they're
[1:00:55] already in there the prophet of God say
[1:00:56] you get everything you need for your
[1:00:57] journey well guess
[1:01:00] what guess
[1:01:03] what Hey sister
[1:01:05] Rebecca bring a visitor will
[1:01:08] you hey man God bless you enjoy yourself
[1:01:12] I may holler at you in a
[1:01:15] minute I just forgot my thought what was
[1:01:17] I talking
[1:01:21] about y'all weren't listening to either
[1:01:22] of you that told me what I was talking
[1:01:23] about
[1:01:26] huh talk about the new
[1:01:28] bir but oh now okay thank you but you
[1:01:32] got everything you needed when you
[1:01:34] started your journey right well why do
[1:01:37] we need this preach to us brother why do
[1:01:38] we need this preach to us
[1:01:41] really
[1:01:45] really give me c
[1:01:53] keys come here David come here David
[1:01:57] come here buddy this is Brother David M
[1:02:01] let's said give come here here I want
[1:02:04] you to drive your parents home today
[1:02:05] okay you drive the car and you be
[1:02:08] careful but drive them home because
[1:02:10] listen he's a human being is he
[1:02:12] not does he not have all the faculties
[1:02:15] that he needs for his journey but he's a
[1:02:18] baby he's not a baby now but he is not
[1:02:21] able to drive that car give that back to
[1:02:23] your daddy
[1:02:27] if he does we need to clear the lot
[1:02:30] first but that's an that's just a prime
[1:02:32] example we get everything you need at in
[1:02:34] New Birth but you got to grow
[1:02:37] up then then man I say man teaches us
[1:02:41] that when we get 16 or 17 we can drive a
[1:02:43] car I kind of doubt that myself already
[1:02:45] too where's Abby
[1:02:50] Grace oh she's in the back running the
[1:02:52] thing all right lay hands on the sick
[1:02:55] and they shall recover I hate this
[1:02:58] thing we'll get it changed but look the
[1:03:01] Bible tells us though look as newborn
[1:03:03] babes right here desire the sincere milk
[1:03:06] of the word that you may grow thereby
[1:03:08] there's a desire put inside of you to
[1:03:11] eat so Brother David when he gets
[1:03:13] Michael's age or or close to it he can
[1:03:16] drive a car he's a human right he has
[1:03:19] five fingers on each hand toes eyes but
[1:03:23] what's the problem
[1:03:24] his maturity has not come to a place
[1:03:27] where daddy can hand him the KY and say
[1:03:29] here drive us home that's right cuz it'd
[1:03:32] be a wreck it'd be a disaster God knows
[1:03:34] that about you
[1:03:35] too we're all a wreck and a disaster
[1:03:37] without
[1:03:38] God but as newborn babies desire the
[1:03:41] sincere milk of the word that you may
[1:03:43] grow thereby if so be that we have
[1:03:45] tasted that the Lord is gracious once
[1:03:47] you get born again you absolutely have a
[1:03:50] thirst for God that you never had before
[1:03:52] or you didn't get it
[1:03:55] or you didn't get
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:03:59] it there's something inside of you just
[1:04:02] like a human being you say feed me amen
[1:04:05] yes then when you get Michael's age your
[1:04:07] mama has to get three jobs to feed
[1:04:15] him but he's still a human but he's come
[1:04:19] to maturity you know what he's come to
[1:04:20] now where he can get buy his own food if
[1:04:22] he needs to we used to depend on Mom and
[1:04:24] Daddy for everything right but we come
[1:04:27] to maturity well
[1:04:29] some cuz see like some Christians won't
[1:04:31] come to
[1:04:34] maturity newborn babes Desiring send mle
[1:04:36] of the word now here here God here the
[1:04:38] Lord is in your house but you got that
[1:04:41] door locked of Pride you got that door
[1:04:43] locked of this you got that door locked
[1:04:44] of this you got that door locked of this
[1:04:46] and you say hey don't mess in my
[1:04:47] business but you're still a son cuz
[1:04:50] we're going to talk about adoption this
[1:04:51] afternoon where there's several sons in
[1:04:53] the family but really only one gets
[1:04:56] adopted cuz he is Head and Shoulders
[1:04:58] Above the Rest he gets a good report
[1:05:01] well that's the same way with the Holy
[1:05:02] Ghost with us and we'll read it this
[1:05:03] afternoon where brother Ram um
[1:05:06] dramatizes that the Holy Ghost you know
[1:05:07] is your tutor and he goes and sees you
[1:05:09] and he turns around tells the father
[1:05:11] said hey he's not doing what you said to
[1:05:14] do he's not coming to church he's not
[1:05:16] reading the Bible oh man well I can't
[1:05:19] use him check the next guy out so the
[1:05:22] next son you know he he does everything
[1:05:24] you know he does everything the father
[1:05:26] ask him to do he U he gets into the will
[1:05:30] sees what's his and says hey that's
[1:05:32] mine well then the Holy Ghost is going
[1:05:34] to say hey you going to be proud of this
[1:05:35] guy chip all off the old block is what
[1:05:38] he says we'll read it this afternoon but
[1:05:40] that's coming to adoption coming to
[1:05:41] adoption is not just coming to church
[1:05:43] and saying I'm born again I believe the
[1:05:44] message of the hour I got nothing to do
[1:05:46] with it because it's two separate things
[1:05:48] that's right to him coming as a living
[1:05:50] Stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:05:52] chosen of God and precious that's us
[1:05:54] we're still on the soul because the soul
[1:05:56] is different from your spirit abely your
[1:06:00] soul has Faith or doubt that's it that's
[1:06:03] it you're not half born
[1:06:07] again your sisters never get half give
[1:06:09] half birth to a child did you
[1:06:12] no you birthed a
[1:06:16] child just TR you can't give them
[1:06:20] back can't give them back you got to
[1:06:21] keep them they're yours that's what God
[1:06:24] says about us sometimes he they're mine
[1:06:26] I'm ashamed of them but they're mine
[1:06:29] praise God brother Bri says look when a
[1:06:32] man is Born Again of the spirit of God
[1:06:33] God gives him a checkbook now look God
[1:06:35] gives him a checkbook that'll last him
[1:06:37] all through life
[1:06:39] journey and at the bottom of each check
[1:06:43] has got Jesus's name signed why you're
[1:06:46] still a baby
[1:06:49] yes he can't trust you with
[1:06:52] everything he can give give you the
[1:06:54] check my name signed on it but I got to
[1:06:57] make sure this is
[1:06:59] right but there's going to come a time
[1:07:01] in adoption where brother Brown say he
[1:07:02] gives you the checkbook and you put your
[1:07:04] name on it all
[1:07:07] right so that's why this church has been
[1:07:10] built on and we believe in growth
[1:07:12] development we don't believe in just
[1:07:13] coming to church and being a message
[1:07:14] believer that's right my dad has fought
[1:07:17] for years to get people to see that
[1:07:19] there is a growth in this message all
[1:07:22] right and it's all in the Bible it's not
[1:07:24] some you know Samuel Dale Theory my
[1:07:28] dad and at the bottom of each check has
[1:07:30] got Jesus's name signed to it you just
[1:07:32] filling out for whatever redemp
[1:07:33] Redemptive blessing you need it's yours
[1:07:36] already prayed paid for and prayed for
[1:07:38] now surely you're not afraid that it
[1:07:40] won't be cashed if you're afraid you
[1:07:43] just hold that book in your pocket
[1:07:44] brother BR was talking about fixing to
[1:07:45] do a prayer line so now let's go to the
[1:07:47] spirit realm because remember in your
[1:07:49] spirit realm there's what five
[1:07:51] senses memory reasoning conscious n
[1:07:54] affection and
[1:07:56] Imagination contrary to
[1:07:59] God from the get-go
[1:08:05] amen what's hurt what hurts you more
[1:08:07] than anything your
[1:08:08] memory I can remember what I
[1:08:11] did praise God God can't
[1:08:16] that's
[1:08:18] reasoning sure the Bible says come let
[1:08:21] us reason together but there's sometimes
[1:08:22] we reason oursel away from the word of
[1:08:25] God and our definitely our conscience is
[1:08:27] not of God you ought to see all the
[1:08:29] filthy thoughts that goes through all
[1:08:30] our heads not me well you're lying so
[1:08:34] that's another one you got to get rid of
[1:08:37] all right memory reason conscious
[1:08:40] affection which is just what fio love
[1:08:43] right not agapy love fio
[1:08:46] love and then imagination is there an
[1:08:49] imagination in God Lord no well I
[1:08:53] imagine no God says this is the way it's
[1:08:54] going to be and we have to as brother R
[1:08:57] says we told the line amen so second of
[1:08:59] Peter 1 verse5 we're moving into the
[1:09:01] spirit Realm of the person and besides
[1:09:03] this besides what besides the divine
[1:09:06] nature besides the new birth giving all
[1:09:09] diligence add to your faith it says now
[1:09:13] it's your faith Right add to your faith
[1:09:16] amen virtue and to Virtue knowledge
[1:09:18] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[1:09:20] patience godliness godliness brotherly
[1:09:22] kindness and brotherly kindness charity
[1:09:24] brother Ram said some of these virtues
[1:09:27] you can just naturally live but these
[1:09:29] are god-given virtues that make you act
[1:09:31] like God not like the world all right
[1:09:35] Ephesians 4:14 says we henceforth be no
[1:09:38] more children so we move from that heirs
[1:09:40] and Joint airs we move from that crybaby
[1:09:43] stage right somebody with me you move
[1:09:46] from that crybaby stage you've let God
[1:09:48] work inside your spirit realm you've
[1:09:49] opened all the doors that you had
[1:09:52] closed let him start working through
[1:09:54] what by the word of God Amen that we
[1:09:57] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:09:59] and fro the look and carried about with
[1:10:03] every wind of Doctrine wow by the slight
[1:10:07] of
[1:10:09] preachers men and cunning craftiness
[1:10:13] whereby they line weight to deceive
[1:10:14] Satan's still there because remember
[1:10:16] Satan's playground is your
[1:10:20] spirit if he's in your soul you're not
[1:10:22] born again so you not even in the will
[1:10:24] that's right but if you're born
[1:10:26] again if you're born again child of God
[1:10:29] your soul is
[1:10:30] sealed your soul is sealed he sned in
[1:10:33] sealed in Satan sealed out but you got a
[1:10:36] spirit realm where Satan Works through
[1:10:38] your memory your reasoning your
[1:10:39] conscious effect imagination that's the
[1:10:41] greatest battle ever fought it's not in
[1:10:42] your gray matter or your
[1:10:46] head in other words it's not physically
[1:10:48] because you got a
[1:10:50] brain it's because you was born in sin
[1:10:52] that's right with a carnal
[1:10:55] nature and that carnal Nature has to be
[1:10:58] killed by the word of
[1:11:00] God that we henceforth be no more
[1:11:02] children all right we're moving up
[1:11:04] getting a little more um uh maturity
[1:11:07] talks to and fro carried about with
[1:11:09] every wi of Doctrine listen we should be
[1:11:11] to a place now to where where false
[1:11:12] Doctrine doesn't bother us and it's out
[1:11:19] there by the slot of men and cunning
[1:11:21] crafs will by their line weight to
[1:11:22] deceive look but speaking the truth in
[1:11:24] love may grow up into him in what some
[1:11:27] things all things which is the head even
[1:11:31] Christ all right is everybody with me
[1:11:33] got to rush through this real quick 1
[1:11:35] Peter 2 verse1 ye also as Lively stones
[1:11:38] are built up everything's building up am
[1:11:42] to a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[1:11:45] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:11:47] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] wherefore also is contained in the
[1:11:52] scripture behold I lay in a Chief
[1:11:54] Cornerstone elect and precious cuz
[1:11:56] remember the headstone was rejected so
[1:11:58] this was taken
[1:12:01] off that's what the Bible said The
[1:12:03] Headstone was rejected but he became the
[1:12:05] chief of the Chief Cornerstone and it's
[1:12:07] just a little bitty pyramid he started
[1:12:09] building his church on
[1:12:13] him but they couldn't get all the way up
[1:12:16] there because of their
[1:12:19] ideas behold I land Zion a Chief
[1:12:21] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:12:23] believe on him shall not look here's
[1:12:25] something in your will amen that he that
[1:12:29] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[1:12:32] that's right amen unto you therefore
[1:12:35] which believe he is precious but unto
[1:12:37] them which be
[1:12:38] disobedient the stone which the Builder
[1:12:41] disallowed is made the head of the
[1:12:43] corner he's going to start building his
[1:12:45] church regardless of whether you like it
[1:12:47] or not regardless of whether Satan likes
[1:12:49] it or not God's going to have a church
[1:12:51] and now he calls her bride right
[1:12:54] which is Revelations 19 it's not a bride
[1:12:56] anymore it's a wife his wife has made
[1:12:59] herself ready not the bride you're know
[1:13:01] June's not my bride anymore she was 44
[1:13:03] years ago she's my wife
[1:13:06] now I tell people brother Mark that I've
[1:13:09] been married to the same woman 44 years
[1:13:11] and she'll stop me real quick and said
[1:13:12] no you're not married the same woman
[1:13:15] that you were 44 years ago we've all
[1:13:17] grown yeah praise the Lord you got that
[1:13:19] right for me for me for me sister Junior
[1:13:21] for me have to be careful when you say
[1:13:26] stuff and a stone of stumbling a rock of
[1:13:28] offense even to them which stumble look
[1:13:30] at the
[1:13:32] word taking it right back to the word
[1:13:34] right back to the will you're stumbled
[1:13:36] at it because you don't understand it
[1:13:39] being disobedient that's why we're
[1:13:43] disobedient where to also they were
[1:13:47] appointed but you are a chosen
[1:13:49] Generation Now genealogy is a generation
[1:13:52] so we must be in the gene ology of God
[1:13:54] to be in this generation chosen
[1:13:56] generation a royal priesthood holy
[1:13:58] nation peculiar people that we should
[1:14:01] show forth the Praises of him who have
[1:14:03] called you out of

[1:14:15] people but now yes sir are now the
[1:14:20] people of
[1:14:21] God which had look not obtained Mercy
[1:14:25] but now have obtained
[1:14:27] Mercy 1 Peter 1:22 say look seeing you
[1:14:31] have purified your souls in obeying the
[1:14:32] truth through the spirit and under
[1:14:33] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[1:14:35] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:14:37] fervently as brother Rob was talking
[1:14:38] about tat you a perfect man when you get
[1:14:41] up to brotherly kindness It's not loving
[1:14:42] somebody that loves you that's
[1:14:46] right

[1:14:57] family but I've got two gay guys that
[1:14:59] live right beside me I got to love them
[1:15:02] just as much as I love me or that ain't
[1:15:04] brotherly
[1:15:04] kindness I got to love people Jesus

[1:15:40] there's a growth birth which is virtue
[1:15:43] knowledge Temperance patience godliness

[1:15:51] the order of mzc of whom we have many
[1:15:54] things to say and hard to be utter

[1:15:57] couldn't preach to a lot of people amen
[1:16:00] they didn't understand him hey even
[1:16:03] Peter that's right Peter the Holy Ghost
[1:16:06] filled Peter that wrote some of the
[1:16:08] Bible that we're reading right now he
[1:16:09] said Paul says things hard to be
[1:16:17] understood for when for the time you
[1:16:19] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:16:21] one teach you again which be the first
[1:16:24] principles of the Oracles of God just
[1:16:26] like brother um that was here the other
[1:16:28] day we were talking and he said you
[1:16:30] don't have to tell the Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:32] person to keep to come to
[1:16:33] church amen you can just slide that out
[1:16:36] of the way you don't have to tell the
[1:16:37] Holy Ghost person to read the Bible you

[1:16:42] filled woman to not cut her
[1:16:46] hair if you're not you're not born again
[1:16:48] okay just admit it and start from there
[1:16:51] at least you start from somewhere right
[1:16:54] amen cuz remember the word is what here
[1:16:57] to
[1:16:58] divide
[1:17:01] right be the first principles of Oracles
[1:17:03] of God and are become such as have need
[1:17:05] of milk and not strong meat Paul's
[1:17:07] looking at a group of people saying Hey
[1:17:09] Y'all ought to be more mature than
[1:17:11] this amen right remember he never
[1:17:14] preached this to the
[1:17:16] Ephesians the Ephesians brother it was a
[1:17:18] mature Church they could take this
[1:17:20] predestination they could take chosen in
[1:17:22] him before the foundation of the world
[1:17:25] and that was a big old strong Mighty
[1:17:26] Church 12 people but hey it was 12
[1:17:29] people with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:31] mature for everyone that uses milk is
[1:17:35] unskillful that's where we get in
[1:17:36] trouble we become unskillful Brother

[1:18:35] meat belongeth to them yes that are of
[1:18:38] full age even those who by reason of use
[1:18:43] that's the whole
[1:18:44] deal have their senses exercised to
[1:18:48] discern good from Evil today right now
[1:18:51] you're Discerning good from Evil yes all
[1:18:53] right there's a fight going on there's a
[1:18:55] battle in another dimension right now
[1:18:57] thank God we had a prophet that could
[1:18:58] explain that he could see streets of
[1:19:00] black going from one to the other what
[1:19:02] it was it was a demon screaming at
[1:19:03] another one all right he see the demons
[1:19:05] he said hanging on the
[1:19:07] Rafters that's real remember he said I
[1:19:10] wanted to see one of them it looked like
[1:19:11] aloop the the cartoon some of you young
[1:19:14] kids don't know that we used to have
[1:19:15] cartoons and they were black and
[1:19:19] white that's right now they got HD huge
[1:19:24] devil praise the Lord Ephesians 1 ver4
[1:19:28] says according here's
[1:19:30] Ephesians got to have got to be funny a
[1:19:32] little bit or you go crazy according as
[1:19:35] he has chosen what Us in him before the
[1:19:40] foundation of the world that we should
[1:19:42] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:19:43] love we weren't yes we were Unholy we
[1:19:46] were unlovable that's right that's right
[1:19:48] but now because of this chosen that we
[1:19:51] know that we were chosen we receive the
[1:19:53] new birth
[1:19:55] yes it's made us holy and Without Blame
[1:19:58] if you're born again today you will not
[1:20:00] go to the
[1:20:01] judgments you'll not go to the white
[1:20:03] Throne judgment sure there's a judgment
[1:20:05] of the Deeds Done in the body Paul
[1:20:06] explains that but you not go to the
[1:20:07] white Throne judgment praise God that's
[1:20:10] a good enough Revelation for me right
[1:20:13] now but if you're not born again don't
[1:20:15] claim that Revelation cuz you ain't got
[1:20:17] there yet look having predestinated now
[1:20:20] remember we know in this church
[1:20:23] predestination is not just setting Stone
[1:20:26] God's going to pull you through a tube
[1:20:27] cuz brother Ram didn't believe
[1:20:29] that cuz Paul explains he's by for
[1:20:33] knowledge those he forne he did
[1:20:36] predestinate so by for knowledge he knew
[1:20:39] what was going to happen saw you do it
[1:20:41] or not do it therefore he could
[1:20:44] predetermine your destiny only by for
[1:20:47] knowledge cuz listen you're still a free
[1:20:50] moral agent today you're a free moral
[1:20:52] agent the time we come to the change of
[1:20:53] the body you're going to be a free moral
[1:20:56] agan you can't take that away cuz that's
[1:21:00] the soul part the soul makes you a free
[1:21:02] mo Asia all right having predestinated
[1:21:05] us into the adoption of children now
[1:21:07] look he predestinated us unto adoption
[1:21:11] not adoption to
[1:21:13] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:21:15] himself according to the pleasure of his
[1:21:17] will adoption series brother Ram said
[1:21:19] look now what is adoption we'll stop
[1:21:20] right here what is adoption now let me
[1:21:23] get this now I don't know whether or I
[1:21:24] won't have time to get through this but
[1:21:26] I'll hit it if there's a question you
[1:21:28] can ask me a little later on something
[1:21:29] in the message listen your adoption is
[1:21:33] not your
[1:21:34] birth pretty plain isn't it that's black
[1:21:36] and white well with a little bit of
[1:21:38] yellow and a little bit red your
[1:21:40] adoption is not your birth your adoption
[1:21:43] is your placing so he's pulling it apart
[1:21:45] he's rightly dividing the word of Truth
[1:21:48] when you were born again St John 1:17 I
[1:21:51] believe when we were born of the the
[1:21:52] spirit of God we are sons of God all
[1:21:54] right put in the family but we were
[1:21:57] predestinated now here's what I'm trying
[1:21:59] to get to you for this sons of the last
[1:22:01] day we were
[1:22:03] predestinated unto adoption so only in
[1:22:07] this
[1:22:08] age could we come to adoption only in
[1:22:11] this age CU to be adopted you got to
[1:22:14] have full word all in line precepts from
[1:22:16] precept line upon line everything no
[1:22:19] false Doctrine that's right you say how
[1:22:21] can you do that we can't do that you
[1:22:23] believe this and I believe that did
[1:22:25] Jesus have a problem with his
[1:22:26] Doctrine did the father have a problem
[1:22:28] with his
[1:22:30] Doctrine where is that
[1:22:32] person where inside here is inside of
[1:22:38] you I read you where he said if you'll
[1:22:41] listen to what he's saying he'll lead
[1:22:42] you and guide you into some
[1:22:44] truth all Truth All right so let's read
[1:22:47] this real quick and then we'll then
[1:22:49] we'll stop right here and start this
[1:22:51] afternoon take a Peter 1:8 for if these
[1:22:53] things be in you and abound U brother
[1:22:55] Bob read it this morning for if these
[1:22:58] things be in you what if these things be
[1:23:00] in you and
[1:23:03] overflow abound means overflow when
[1:23:07] brother Bram had to dream sister
[1:23:08] Shepherd had a dream brother R
[1:23:10] interpreted the water was flowing out of
[1:23:12] the pyramid
[1:23:13] am but remember what was in that water
[1:23:17] sticks
[1:23:20] stones in other words when you get born
[1:23:22] again you still got
[1:23:25] trash it's called a spirit
[1:23:27] realm but as he pours the water in he
[1:23:30] said the stins came up to the top and
[1:23:32] run out that's what that right there is
[1:23:36] so because when we come to adoption
[1:23:37] listen the adoption is when when God is
[1:23:40] going to place everything in your
[1:23:42] hand and he's not going to back
[1:23:46] off no no no no
[1:23:49] no when Adam was naming the animals
[1:23:53] sister Cheryl when Adam was naming all
[1:23:55] the animals this big gray thing comes
[1:23:58] walking up with a trunk like this and
[1:24:00] Adam
[1:24:01] goes
[1:24:03] elephant next one comes by you know R
[1:24:06] got a big man and he Roars you know and
[1:24:09] big old long tail he said line and God's
[1:24:12] going Adam that's exactly what I was
[1:24:15] thinking cuz that's where it came from
[1:24:17] and that's what we're having now now is
[1:24:19] that moment of time when the second Adam
[1:24:22] come to get into his bride to give us
[1:24:24] that
[1:24:26] Authority hallu remember I read to you
[1:24:29] Genesis 1:26 man it's to given
[1:24:33] Dominion so when you call for it it'll
[1:24:36] happen we've seen it in a small portion
[1:24:39] here in our own
[1:24:40] church where brother Dell would call for
[1:24:42] things and it would happen a gun one
[1:24:44] time right brother klie stolen out of
[1:24:47] his

[1:25:57] the different things we've seen it in a
[1:25:58] small portion but I want to see it in
[1:26:00] the bigger portion not just one person
[1:26:02] it's you know one man message we come
[1:26:04] through brother Ram had a great get we

[1:26:13] being done in a worldwide uh uh space of
[1:26:16] time not just one person all right
[1:26:18] because this message is worldwide yes it
[1:26:20] is brother Brown did not take it all
[1:26:22] back home with
[1:26:24] him cuz you know why cuz Jesus Christ is
[1:26:26] here and that's the whole message is
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ if he's here he's the
[1:26:29] message and the message is here all
[1:26:31] right for if these things be in you and
[1:26:33] abound they make you yes that you shall
[1:26:35] neither be bearing nor and fruitful in
[1:26:37] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:38] but he that lath these things is blind
[1:26:41] you're still in the
[1:26:42] Kingdom but you're not going to be an
[1:26:44] adopted son and cannot see far off in
