[0:22] to say this morning I said in Jesus name
[0:34] okay
[0:42] that's all right
[0:47] uh
[0:49] today I want to continue my talk on
[0:51] Vision dreams and dimensions so I might
[0:54] read a couple of more scriptures and
[0:56] quotes that I I think I can read
[0:59] and uh
[1:01] so then Donna did a good job last week
[1:04] and so did brother Tim cross
[1:07] yes you did a very good job
[1:09] so I thank the Lord for the thoughtful
[1:11] Ministry amen
[1:14] if we all want to get out of here we all
[1:16] have to do it
[1:17] our part
[1:19] so as small as I am and I'll try to do
[1:22] my part
[1:25] okay I think uh last time I didn't read
[1:28] this uh on the little paper here that uh
[1:31] I want you all guys
[1:33] so I'm gonna read that first
[1:35] let me say look at here friends let me
[1:37] give this illustration I'm not done it
[1:40] before
[1:41] what color is that shirt it's white
[1:44] anyone that's got sight knows that
[1:47] shirt's White
[1:49] you say you have five senses on the body
[1:51] seed taste feel smell here
[1:54] now these will declare God when God made
[1:58] man he made him in his image instead of
[2:01] man's
[2:02] and he put him in a five sense to con
[2:04] contact his Earthly home
[2:07] not to contact god with those senses
[2:10] don't declare God they declare the
[2:12] Earthly home when a man had to contact
[2:15] his Earthly home
[2:16] he had to see tasteful smell here
[2:20] you say my faith is the stuff substance
[2:23] of thanks hope for the evidence of
[2:26] Things Not Seen
[2:28] you did not see it taste it feel it
[2:30] smell it or hear it but you believe it
[2:33] that's from the message faith that works
[2:36] is dead
[2:46] there's a couple of scriptures that I
[2:48] missed last time so let's go to
[2:52] numbers 24 1.
[3:13] numbers 24 1 and when Baylen saw that he
[3:16] pleased the lord to bless Israel who
[3:18] went not as other times to seek for
[3:20] enchantment
[3:22] but he set his face toward the
[3:24] wilderness
[3:26] and balen lifted up his eyes and saw
[3:28] Israel abide in his tents according to
[3:31] their tribes and the spirit of God Came
[3:33] Upon him
[3:34] and he took up his Parable and said Bala
[3:37] and Asana there that said and the man
[3:41] whose eyes opened had said
[3:45] he had said we heard the words of God we
[3:48] saw the vision of the almighty and
[3:50] fallen and into a trance but Heaven his
[3:52] eyes opened
[3:57] last time I kind of went a little fast
[3:58] and did a lot of quotes so if anybody
[4:00] has any comments or something just the
[4:04] brother Donna said he had a few comments
[4:06] but I was not I was on a road and I
[4:08] didn't give him a chance I'm saying it
[4:09] real good all right
[4:11] huh
[4:12] so you go ahead you did a bad job
[4:18] okay go ahead
[4:20] okay let's go to Daniel
[4:24] 8 18 through 19.
[4:38] okay
[4:42] 19 through
[4:45] eight
[4:46] 18 through 11.
[4:49] 8 18-11
[4:52] 8
[4:55] 18 18.
[4:57] to 11.
[5:01] because 18 comes before
[5:07] 18 19 oh I see I see what you're saying
[5:10] yeah
[5:13] well let's go
[5:15] let's do annual Daniel 18 through 19.
[5:19] okay
[5:21] and as he was speaking with me I was in
[5:23] deep Sleep on my face towards the ground
[5:25] but he touched me and set me up right
[5:28] and he said behold I will make thee know
[5:32] what shall be in the last
[5:34] and other in the nation for the time
[5:37] appointed the end shall be
[5:40] okay it's Daniel 10 7. 11 to 11 yeah
[5:45] that's one
[5:48] we'll see you don't help me out
[5:57] 10-7
[5:58] and then and I Daniel also saw the
[6:01] vision for the man that were with me
[6:03] so not division but a great great can
[6:06] fail upon them so that they flee to hit
[6:09] themselves
[6:10] therefore I was left alone and saw this
[6:13] great vision and there remained no
[6:15] strength in me
[6:17] for my communist was turned in me into
[6:20] corruption and I retained no strength
[6:23] yet I heard
[6:26] he had heard I the voice of his words
[6:28] and when I heard the voice of his words
[6:31] then was uh in a deep sleep on my face
[6:34] and my face towards the ground
[6:37] and behold a hand touched me it was set
[6:40] me upon my knees and upon the palms of
[6:43] my hands
[6:44] and he said unto me oh Daniel a man
[6:47] greatly beloved understand the words
[6:49] that I speak unto thee and stand upright
[6:53] For unto thee
[6:55] I am now sent and when he spoke on these
[6:59] words unto me I stood trembling
[7:03] oh
[7:12] I got a couple of quotes from her uh
[7:14] God's power to transform brother and
[7:16] says every move and the thoughts of the
[7:18] heart is recorded
[7:21] right in another dimension
[7:23] you see even the colors will be closed
[7:26] you wear television color
[7:28] television proves it right out it pulls
[7:31] it out and shows it see and that's just
[7:33] in one dimension from the three they
[7:36] believe and that we live and see
[7:40] and he also said look at Christ standing
[7:43] back here and David
[7:44] couldn't even think now his mind had
[7:47] gone from him as it worked and he was
[7:50] hanging on the cross like you see this
[7:52] statue here
[7:53] hang in on the cross crying my God my
[7:57] God why is Thou forsaken me
[8:00] all my bones they stared me they pierced
[8:02] my hands and feet they trusted my side
[8:04] see why or thou so far from me
[8:08] all the bowls the best come come by pass
[8:13] by they wag their heads at the same
[8:15] he he trusted in God that he would
[8:18] deliver him now let's see if he will
[8:20] deliver him
[8:21] speaking the same word so you see
[8:24] when God was made manifested and heard
[8:27] he said the same verse David did you get
[8:30] it so you see it it's not the word of a
[8:33] man it's the word of God that was God
[8:35] and David
[8:37] there wasn't David he didn't know what
[8:39] he was saying he was just so in the
[8:41] spirit that that's the way Moses was he
[8:44] was so in the spirit passed out of the
[8:47] Dimension that he was living in and
[8:49] stood there face to face
[8:51] and that burning bush talking to God
[8:53] himself said take off your shoes the
[8:57] ground you're standing on his Holy
[8:58] Ground
[8:59] he said I imagine when Moses left there
[9:01] he thought what happened what taken
[9:04] place what was it
[9:11] in the message be beyond the curtain of
[9:15] time brother everyone says I don't know
[9:16] if this one has anything to do but if I
[9:19] like this I don't know
[9:22] he says there it is we just got through
[9:24] speaking here a few weeks to go on how
[9:27] that the human system operates how that
[9:29] there's five senses that you enter the
[9:32] body by and then five Avenues we call it
[9:36] five Avenues
[9:38] such a subconscious imagination and so
[9:40] forth we enter the Soul by it and then
[9:44] when you enter the spirit there's only
[9:46] one Avenue and that is through self-will
[9:49] which spaces it back like Man was
[9:52] created
[9:54] you can receive it or you can just let
[9:57] it go you can accept Christ as a savior
[10:00] or you just let him go and you're still
[10:03] by that tree that one of life and one of
[10:06] dead every human being is set before
[10:09] that tree or God
[10:11] God would be on just to put one there
[10:14] and then not give the other one the
[10:16] equal chance to choose right or wrong
[10:19] and each one of us has that opportunity
[10:34] acts 10 9.
[10:40] sorry about your sleep up
[10:41] oh no sleep soon
[10:54] okay
[11:02] age 10-9 on the moral as they land on
[11:05] their journey and Drew Nye onto this
[11:07] city Peter went up onto the house stuff
[11:09] to pray about the six hour
[11:12] I just keep going on antenna to 16. and
[11:16] he became very hungry and would have
[11:17] eaten but while they made ready he fell
[11:20] into a trance and saw him open and a
[11:23] certain vessel descended unto him
[11:25] as it had been a great sheet net at the
[11:29] Four Corners
[11:31] and led down to the Earth
[11:34] when we're all men are for
[11:37] efooted beast of the earth and wild
[11:39] beasts and creeping things and Falls of
[11:41] the air and there came a voice to him
[11:43] rice Peter killed and eat but Peter said
[11:48] not so Lord but I have never eaten
[11:50] anything that is uncommon or unclean and
[11:54] the voice spoke unto him again a second
[11:56] time what God had
[11:58] cleansed that call Nada common this was
[12:02] done twice in the vessel The Vessel was
[12:05] received up again unto heaven
[12:27] now I've been I've been trying to get on
[12:29] the
[12:31] on Joseph so I'm gonna start with my
[12:34] Joseph
[12:35] today so we've got to go to uh
[12:37] Genesis 37.
[13:21] if you got a Scorpio Bob on the bottom
[13:23] how that brother said uh Joseph was a
[13:26] type of Christ and Schofield picks it up
[13:29] on the bottom on
[13:30] page 53 if you have a Schofield model
[13:35] he says well is nowhere a certain that
[13:38] Joseph was the true what was the type of
[13:40] Christ the honor analogic but too
[13:44] numerous to be accidental they are well
[13:48] for special updates of a Father's Love
[13:51] Genesis 37 3 Matthew 3 17 John 3 35 what
[13:57] goes on and on he said both were hated
[13:59] by their brother the Brethren Genesis 37
[14:04] John 15.
[14:06] this Superior claims that both were
[14:09] rejected
[14:11] let's see
[14:13] her brother and opposed conspire against
[14:15] them to slay them
[14:17] Genesis 37. Joshua was an intent and
[14:20] triggers Lane by his brother as was
[14:23] Christ
[14:25] it became a blessing among the Gentiles
[14:28] and gained a gentle bride
[14:31] as Joseph reconciled his brother to
[14:33] himself and had to work exalted them so
[14:36] will be with Christ and his Jewish
[14:38] brethren
[14:46] Jacob had 12 sons which is also called a
[14:50] 12 tribes of Israel
[14:52] and the names of uh all the all his sons
[14:55] was Reuben Simon Levi Judah Dan
[15:01] Natalie Gap Dasher
[15:04] he's sure
[15:06] Joseph and Benjamin
[15:13] okay let's go uh
[15:16] 37 let's start at 37 1.
[15:24] and Jacob dwell in Atlanta where his
[15:26] father was a stranger in the land of
[15:28] Canaan
[15:29] these are the generations that
[15:32] Jacob Josephine 17 years old was feeding
[15:37] the with his brother and the lab
[15:38] was with a Sansa
[15:42] his father's wives and Joseph brought
[15:45] them to his father their evil report
[15:49] yeah I wanted to go into Joseph because
[15:51] I think he was one of the biggest
[15:52] dreamers in the Bible I mean
[15:55] I mean the whole thing tell us about him
[15:56] dreaming about this and this and that
[15:58] you know
[16:02] now Israel loved Joseph more than all
[16:04] his children because he was a son of his
[16:06] old age and he made him a coat of many
[16:08] colors
[16:09] also he loved Benjamin too how come he
[16:11] didn't make him up
[16:13] according code
[16:15] I guess he was because he was a younger
[16:17] one or something
[16:21] and what is when his brother saw that
[16:24] their father loved him more than all his
[16:25] brother they hated him and could not
[16:28] speak peacefully unto him
[16:32] one brother is enough to hate you but
[16:33] you got 11 Brothers in here so
[16:38] and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
[16:40] it this his brother and they hated him
[16:43] yet the more
[16:45] and he said unto them here I pray you
[16:48] this dream which I have dreamed
[16:50] for behold we are binding she's in the
[16:53] field and low my sheath arose and also
[16:56] stood upright and behold yeshiv stood
[16:59] round about and made obedience to my
[17:01] sheep
[17:03] and his brother said unto him shall thou
[17:06] indeed Reign Over Us or shall die need
[17:08] have a dominion over us and they hated
[17:11] him yet the more for his dreams and for
[17:14] his words I'm working more and more and
[17:17] more
[17:21] and he dreamed he had another dream and
[17:24] he told his brother and said behold I
[17:26] have dream and dream more and behold the
[17:28] Sun and the Moon and 11 stars made a
[17:31] vision oh
[17:34] senses
[17:36] obedience
[17:39] to me and he told it to his father to
[17:43] his brother his father
[17:45] review came and said unto him what is
[17:47] this dream and now his dream shall I and
[17:50] my mother and my brother indeed come to
[17:52] bow down ourselves to thee
[17:55] to the Earth and his brother entered him
[17:59] and but his father
[18:01] observed the sand
[18:05] and his brother went to defeat their
[18:06] father's flocking should come and Israel
[18:09] said unto Joseph
[18:11] do not thy brother and Pete the flock
[18:13] and shall come come and I will send thee
[18:15] unto them and like he said
[18:18] him here I am and he said to him go I
[18:21] pray
[18:22] do you see whether to be well with thy
[18:24] brother and well with the flocks and
[18:27] bring me word again so he sent him out
[18:29] of it Bill a hippo and he came to
[18:32] shookum and a certain man upon him and
[18:34] behold he was wondering in the field and
[18:37] the man asked him saying what sick is
[18:39] thou and he said I seek my brother I
[18:42] pray thee where they feed their flocks
[18:45] and the man said they are reporting has
[18:48] for hear them saying let us go to do
[18:52] and Joseph went after his brother and
[18:55] found them a student
[18:57] and when they saw him after
[18:59] a far off even before we came here until
[19:02] then this conspire against him to slay
[19:06] him and they said one to another behold
[19:09] this dreamer cometh
[19:15] come now therefore let us slay him and
[19:17] cast him unto
[19:19] some pit and we will say some evil
[19:21] beasts that devote him and we shall see
[19:24] what he will become of his dreams
[19:28] and Reuben which is his older brother
[19:30] said
[19:31] and Reuben heard it and he delivered him
[19:34] out of their hands and said let us not
[19:35] kill him
[19:38] and Reuben said unto them shed no blood
[19:40] but cast him unto the spirit that is in
[19:43] the will Wilderness and lay no hand upon
[19:46] him that he might read him out of their
[19:48] hands to deliver him to his father again
[19:53] and a cake came to pass when Joseph was
[19:55] coming to his brother if they strive
[19:58] Joseph out of the school his coat of
[20:00] many colors that it was on him and he
[20:03] took him and cast him until Pitt and the
[20:06] pit was empty there was no water in it
[20:09] and they sat down to eat bread and they
[20:11] lifted up their eyes and looked and
[20:13] behold the company ishmaelites came from
[20:16] Hilliard with a camel's bearing spicier
[20:20] mom and myrrh born to carry down to
[20:22] Egypt
[20:23] and Judah said unto his brother what
[20:26] prophet is this we slay our brother and
[20:28] come seal his blood
[20:30] Come and Let Us sell him to this
[20:34] this
[20:35] not our
[20:37] and be upon him for he is our brother
[20:39] and our flesh and his Brethren were
[20:41] contact just like Christ was sold for a
[20:44] 30 pieces of silver so they sold Joseph
[20:46] too that's why he's a type of Christ
[20:50] that's right
[20:51] and there was
[20:53] that they're passed by the immediate a
[20:55] nice Merchant man and they drew and
[20:57] lifted up Joseph other pit and sold
[20:59] Joseph to the ismaelites
[21:01] for 20 pieces of silver
[21:04] and they brought Joseph onto Egypt
[21:07] and Rural government returned onto the
[21:09] pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit
[21:12] and they rented his clothes
[21:16] I guess his older brother carried a
[21:18] little bit about him
[21:19] so at least had 10 ahead brother this
[21:22] day
[21:30] and they took Joseph's coat and then the
[21:32] killer kid of goats and dipped the code
[21:34] in the blood and they they sent the code
[21:37] many clothes and they brought it to
[21:39] their father and said this head we found
[21:41] no now whether it be the son's coat or
[21:44] not
[21:45] and he knew it and said it is my son's
[21:48] code an evil Beast had they borrowed him
[21:50] Joseph is without dog ran in pieces and
[21:55] Jacob read his clothes and put sex cloth
[21:58] upon his Lawns and mourned for his son
[22:00] many days
[22:02] and all his sons and all his daughters
[22:04] rose up to comfort him but he refused to
[22:07] be comforted and he said for I will go
[22:09] down into the grave unto my son
[22:13] morning thus it's about a web for him
[22:15] and the meeting I saw him into Egypt
[22:18] into potiphar and officer apparel and
[22:21] and the captain of the Guard
[22:27] let's go to a chapter 39 because uh
[22:31] chapter 38 talks about
[22:33] Judah and talmar and all that and a lot
[22:36] of preachers
[22:37] talk different different stuff so I'm
[22:39] not going to get in the middle though
[22:41] I'm staying out of that
[22:49] and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and
[22:51] potiphar and officer that Pharaoh
[22:53] captain of that Gordon and Egyptian
[22:55] bought him uh the hands of Israelites
[22:58] which had brought him down hit her and
[23:01] the Lord was with Joseph and he was
[23:04] a prosperous man and he was in the house
[23:07] of a semester
[23:08] the Egyptian and his master saw that the
[23:11] Lord was with him and that the Lord made
[23:13] all that he did to prosper in his hand
[23:16] and Joseph fundraised in his sight and
[23:19] he served him and he made him overseer
[23:21] over his house and all that he had put
[23:24] into his hand
[23:26] and it came to pass from that time that
[23:28] he made him Overseer in the house and
[23:30] over all that he he had at the Lord
[23:33] blessed the Egyptians house for
[23:36] Joseph said and the blessing the Lord
[23:39] was upon all that he did in the house
[23:42] and in the field and he left all that he
[23:45] had in Joseph's hand
[23:51] and he knew not all he has
[23:54] saved the bread which he did eat and
[23:56] Joseph was a Godly person and well
[23:58] favored and he came to pass after this
[24:01] thing that his master's Wife cast arised
[24:04] upon Joseph and she said lie with me but
[24:08] he refused and said his man until his
[24:11] master's wife behold my master who was
[24:13] not what is with me in the house and he
[24:16] had committed all that he had to my hand
[24:19] and there is none greater in this house
[24:21] than I neither had he kept back anything
[24:24] from me but the because they are his
[24:28] wife oh then can I do this great
[24:31] wickedness and sin against God
[24:36] he didn't say against the
[24:37] powerful he said it against God
[24:42] and he can't pass as she expected Joseph
[24:44] day by day that he heard him not unto
[24:47] her to lie about her to be with her and
[24:50] it came to pass about this time that
[24:52] Joseph went into the house to do his
[24:54] business and there was none of the man
[24:57] of the house there with him and she
[24:58] caught him by this apartment saying lie
[25:01] with me and he left his garment in her
[25:03] hand and flee and God got him out and he
[25:07] came to pass when she saw that he had
[25:09] left His Garment in her hand
[25:11] and was three fourth
[25:14] yeah she called unto the men of her
[25:16] house and he spoke unto them say see he
[25:19] had brought in and he brought unto us to
[25:21] mock us he came in to me to lie with me
[25:24] and I cried with a loud voice
[25:27] lie lie lie sorry
[25:32] and it came to place when he heard that
[25:34] I lift my voice and cried that he left
[25:36] and she laid back she laid up His
[25:39] Garment Day by her until his Lord came
[25:42] home
[25:43] and she's back unto him according to
[25:46] these words saying the Hebrew servant we
[25:48] should have brought unto us came into me
[25:51] to mock me and he came to pass I lifted
[25:54] up my voice and cried that he left his
[25:56] garment with me and flee up
[25:59] and it came to pass when his master
[26:01] heard the worst of his wife
[26:03] which she spake on the AMC and after
[26:05] this manner did thy servant to me that
[26:09] this wrath was kindled and Joseph's
[26:11] Master took him and put him into the
[26:13] prison and placed
[26:15] with a king's prisoners were born and he
[26:18] was there in that prison but the Lord
[26:20] was with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[26:22] gave him favor and decide that keep her
[26:25] the prison and The Keeper of the prison
[26:27] committed to Joseph's hand all the
[26:29] prison that were in the prison
[26:32] and what's that whatsoever they did
[26:34] there he was the doer of it the keeper
[26:38] the president looked not to anything
[26:40] that was under his hand because the Lord
[26:42] was with him and that which he did the
[26:45] Lord made it to prosper
[26:52] let's see if we can do one more
[26:58] and he can't pass after this thing that
[27:00] the butler of the king of Egypt and his
[27:02] favorite had offended the Lord the king
[27:04] of Egypt and Pharaoh was brought against
[27:08] two of his officers against the chief of
[27:10] the Butters and against the chief of the
[27:12] Bakers and he put them in an award in
[27:15] the house of the captain of the Guard
[27:16] into the prison the place where Joseph
[27:19] was bound and the captain of the Guard
[27:22] charged Joseph with him he served them
[27:25] and they continue his season in the war
[27:27] and they dream a dream both of them each
[27:30] man his dream in one night he spent
[27:33] according to their interpretation of his
[27:36] dream the Butler and the Big Brother the
[27:38] king of Egypt which were Bound in prison
[27:41] and Jose came unto them in the morning
[27:43] looked upon them behold they were sad
[27:46] and he asked Pharaoh's officers they
[27:49] were with him in the ward of the it's
[27:51] Lord's House there wherefore look you so
[27:54] sadly today and they said unto him we
[27:57] have a dream
[27:58] we have dream and dream and there is no
[28:00] interpretation of it and Joseph said out
[28:03] to them do not interpretations belong to
[28:06] God
[28:07] tell me then I pray you
[28:09] and the sheep and the Sheep letter told
[28:12] his dream to Joseph and he said to him
[28:13] in my dream behold that mine was before
[28:17] me and in the mind were three branches
[28:21] and it was as though it had butted and
[28:23] her Blossom shot forth and the cluster
[28:26] there are brought forth ripe grapes
[28:29] and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and
[28:32] took the grapes and pressed them into
[28:34] Ferris cup and I gave the cup into
[28:37] pharah's hand
[28:39] and Joseph said unto him to him this is
[28:42] the interpretation of it the three
[28:43] branches are three days yet within three
[28:46] days
[28:47] shall Fair lift up thy hat
[28:50] I died in a head and restored me unto
[28:53] thy place
[28:58] and I shall deliver a Pharaoh's cup into
[29:00] his hand after the former manner without
[29:02] his
[29:04] thou has where's his Butler
[29:07] but think but think on me when it shall
[29:10] be well with thee and show
[29:12] kindness I pray thee unto me and make
[29:14] mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me
[29:17] out of this house
[29:18] for indeed I was stolen away out of the
[29:21] land of the Hebrews and here also I have
[29:24] done nothing that they should put me
[29:25] into a dungeon
[29:28] and when the chief Baker saw that the
[29:31] interpretation was good he said unto
[29:33] Joseph I also was in my dream
[29:36] and behold I had three white baskets on
[29:40] my hand my head in the uppermost basket
[29:43] there was all men are big meets for the
[29:47] Pharaoh and the birds he'd eat them out
[29:49] of that basket
[29:51] upon my head and Joseph Esser and said
[29:53] this is interpretation thereof the three
[29:56] baskets or three days
[29:58] yet within three days shall Fair lift up
[30:00] the head from thee and shall hang thee
[30:03] on a tree and the bird shall eat thy
[30:05] flesh from off that from alphabete
[30:09] and it came to pass the third day which
[30:11] was Pharaoh's birthday that he made a
[30:14] feast not to all the servants and he
[30:15] lifted up the head of the Chiefs Butler
[30:18] and the chief Baker among his servants
[30:20] and restored the chief
[30:22] but notice Butler began and he gave
[30:25] the cup at the pharaoh's hand but he
[30:28] hung the chief Baker and as Joseph
[30:30] interpreted to him he did not the chief
[30:33] Butler remember Joseph but forget him
[30:37] so get the chief baker said that's
[30:40] pretty good but then
[30:42] she also tells them well I got bad news
[30:43] for you you're gonna you're gonna be
[30:45] hung in three days just like uh when
[30:48] Jesus got crucified because one was
[30:51] saved I'm always lost
[30:53] so I guess the better
[30:55] thank you
[31:04] the news
