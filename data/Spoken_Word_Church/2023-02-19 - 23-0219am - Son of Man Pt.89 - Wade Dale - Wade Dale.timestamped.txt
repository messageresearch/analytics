[0:27] [Music]
[0:33] he's so good
[0:38] to me
[0:42] [Applause]
[0:49] I love doing this but I don't love doing
[0:51] it my brother College not here because I
[0:53] love his short stories
[0:55] he called me this morning and uh brother
[0:58] Doherty you know it's with covid so
[1:00] y'all remember him and that family and
[1:02] uh brother Kali he's like me he's
[1:03] getting a little old and he don't want
[1:05] to drive by himself sometimes and it
[1:07] gets scary driving down that road by
[1:08] yourself
[1:10] anyway uh I just wanted to say love you
[1:14] I'm glad to be here this morning and uh
[1:17] let's don't let these trials and
[1:18] tribulations knock us off of what we
[1:21] have they're ours folks
[1:24] hours to claim and hold and all we got
[1:27] to do
[1:28] is thank God for it because that
[1:31] tribulation let me tell you something
[1:33] it's building us right up the statue of
[1:35] a perfect man right to that headstone
[1:37] and we connect there as a bride we're
[1:39] going to be out of here but we're not
[1:41] going to get there if we don't ask for
[1:43] it
[1:43] because we have not because we ask not
[1:45] and I'm speaking to me
[1:47] nobody here
[1:49] and I don't say nobody left behind or go
[1:52] through anything I did
[1:54] so anyway before we go to his word we're
[1:57] going to be reading this morning in 61
[1:58] and when I read this this morning I said
[2:01] wow right on what brother Bob's bringing
[2:03] right what what the ministry here is
[2:05] bringing this spot on so anyway uh as we
[2:09] go to the Lord this morning before we
[2:10] read 61 and let's bow our heads
[2:13] fresh Heavenly Father what a glorious
[2:15] day it is to come and gather around your
[2:18] word and be with people of precious and
[2:20] light faith father I call them brothers
[2:23] and sisters because they are Christians
[2:25] and father I guess that those that
[2:28] couldn't make it through the door today
[2:30] you just bless them and be with them
[2:31] whatever their hindrance is Father God
[2:33] just move it out of the way that they
[2:35] can come and sup with you and you with
[2:36] them Lord
[2:38] and bless them wherever they are and
[2:39] bless the ones that's at home watching
[2:40] online be with them and lift them up
[2:43] father God
[2:45] and let your word father come into our
[2:47] lives that when people see us walking
[2:50] down the street they know we're
[2:51] different
[2:52] because we're you Lord and the rest of
[2:55] the world is blinded by a lot of things
[2:57] out there
[2:59] and I asked father God do this help us
[3:00] and continue sending your word to us
[3:02] most of all by Revelation that we can be
[3:05] what you have created us to be children
[3:07] of yours Lord
[3:09] as we go to your word now father you
[3:11] just come on the scene and Reveal Your
[3:12] word to us
[3:14] bless that little bride around the world
[3:16] and a little bride here at home
[3:18] we ask these things in your precious
[3:20] name Jesus Christ amen
[3:28] hear my cryo God and attend unto my
[3:31] prayer
[3:43] for thou has been a shelter for me and a
[3:46] strong tower from the enemy
[3:55] foreign
[3:57] for thou o God has heard my vows thou
[4:01] has given me the heritage of those that
[4:03] fear thy name

[17:27] let's all remember brother pageant too I
[17:29] know it's been announced but he is
[17:30] having some health issues and also the
[17:34] place where their church is has been
[17:36] sold so they're having to move by the
[17:38] 15th of March they have not found a
[17:41] place yet to have church service
[17:43] and um and with brother JT you know his
[17:46] hands messed up and then he's got a
[17:48] couple other issues that he's working
[17:50] with so we just need to really pray that
[17:51] they find a find a place to uh to
[17:55] worship over there in Jasper it's really
[17:56] hard to find I know some of you know
[17:58] this it's really hard real estate wise
[18:00] that they found a place to to a small
[18:03] place to worship is a a church
[18:07] guy wanted five thousand dollars a month
[18:08] to rent it so
[18:11] they couldn't even afford that you know
[18:13] to to rent that so let's just pray that
[18:15] hey we've seen Miracles we've seen
[18:17] things that look totally impossible and
[18:19] all of a sudden somebody walks and say
[18:20] hey you want to rent this building it's
[18:21] it's vacant you can have it for 300 a
[18:23] month or something so let's just pray
[18:25] that they uh

[19:07] tradition now but we're going to have a
[19:08] prayer service that Saturday night from

[19:13] get finished praying because the week

[19:24] study we're having Bible study every
[19:26] other month now and uh the one that in
[19:30] the odd months we're having a youth
[19:31] service so it would be something

[22:10] amen I also remember to
[22:13] keep brother uh Samuel Reyes
[22:17] in prayer it's okay Bojo
[22:20] he talks to brother Samuel and I called
[22:22] him the other day and uh he's been put
[22:26] out of his church
[22:27] up there in Gainesville the Hispanic
[22:29] Church somebody's come in and and took
[22:31] over and we know who it is but I'm not
[22:34] it's just the devil
[22:36] so brother Samuel's looking for a place
[22:37] to have church service he's looking for
[22:40] a building in Gainesville around here
[22:41] somewhere so keep him in prayer more
[22:44] than anything and uh and uh thank God

[22:57] that amen
[23:04] and sister Rebecca gave me this to to
[23:06] preach over today and we pray that
[23:08] whatever that needs to go to that the
[23:10] need will be met
[23:11] all right so here we go it's under man
[23:13] part 89 and we're gonna I told Brother
[23:15] Bob I said he's not he's not doing
[23:17] Sunday school no more
[23:19] because we're going to talk on
[23:20] Redemption today
[23:22] as a little side note all right in the
[23:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[23:26] God and the Word was God
[23:28] and God knew we needed both of us to say
[23:30] something about it today
[23:31] and the Word was made flesh Bob primed
[23:34] you so now you really ought to be able
[23:36] to listen
[23:37] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[23:39] among us and we beheld his glory the
[23:40] glory of the only begotten of the father
[23:42] full of grace and truth John 8 verse 31
[23:44] then Jesus said to the Jews who believed
[23:46] on him look believed on him if you
[23:48] continue in my word then are you my
[23:50] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[23:53] truth that's a promise if you're my
[23:55] disciple you shall know the truth and
[23:58] that truth will not bind you it will
[24:00] make you free you may be seated in the
[24:02] Lord and his Blessing and we're going to
[24:04] try today to get to temperance
[24:08] second Peter 1 says beside this giving
[24:10] all the diligence add to your faith
[24:13] virtue into virtue knowledge into
[24:15] knowledge Temperance the temperance
[24:16] patience and the patience godliness when
[24:19] we get into patience we're going to be
[24:20] there for a little while so have
[24:22] patience
[24:24] if I have some patience okay
[24:27] tribulation worketh what patience so if
[24:30] you pull the chart up we're gonna this
[24:32] morning I was thinking about something
[24:33] last night and this morning
[24:35] that we've covered pretty much all we
[24:37] need to cover but there's some side
[24:39] notes that we'd like to look at as
[24:42] brother Bob was talking about Revelation
[24:43] I want to talk a little bit about
[24:45] Redemption before we start up the statue
[24:48] of perfect man just one more time
[24:50] everybody with me all right one more
[24:52] time I want to talk about it in the form
[24:55] of the pawn shop
[24:57] because if we don't get if we don't get
[24:59] this out of the pawn shop
[25:03] then you're not born again
[25:05] you cannot have any of these virtues
[25:07] Holy Ghost virtues without having Holy
[25:09] Ghost inside your soul
[25:11] all right and then we want to also look
[25:14] that if you get out of the pawn shop
[25:17] now you can get yourself back in over
[25:19] here but you can't get yourself back in
[25:21] here
[25:23] I'll read you the quotient in just a
[25:25] minute I know it's far into some but
[25:27] we're going to talk about the soul today
[25:29] because that is where I said last Sunday
[25:33] add to your new birth you can only add
[25:35] to your new birth if you got it right
[25:39] right if if you don't have it you can't
[25:40] add to it all right so you got to get to
[25:43] it first but there was a problem and
[25:46] it's called it's not a
[25:48] problem but it's the Plan of Redemption
[25:51] and I was thinking yesterday you know
[25:53] you look at a plan we all make plans
[25:56] we have plans to do this and plans to do
[25:59] that and they change when God makes a
[26:02] plan cannot change that's why I said the
[26:04] other day if God ever loved you in the
[26:06] beginning he can't not love you through
[26:08] your journey you may fall out of love
[26:11] with him but he's never going to fall
[26:13] out of love for you all right because he
[26:15] can't change his mind and say oh no I
[26:17] made a mistake huh Matt Bro George play
[26:19] a lot blue I bless his heart I I just
[26:22] made a mistake no God don't make a
[26:24] mistake he brings you right here and he
[26:26] gets you and he puts it right in your
[26:27] face and said Hey listen I've been with
[26:30] you on this whole journey I'm going to
[26:32] show you by Revelation where you're at
[26:35] in the body of Christ didn't know what
[26:37] we're all looking for we're looking for
[26:38] adoption we're looking for what we can
[26:40] do to help somebody else we're not here
[26:42] to bash people
[26:46] brother Brown said what it is Spirits we
[26:49] fight Paul said it's Spirits we find
[26:51] amen
[26:53] not principalities and Powers it's
[26:56] Spirit where in that soul and in that
[26:59] Spirit realm is where we have our
[27:01] problem I don't my problems are not the
[27:03] White House
[27:05] your problem's not the White House your
[27:08] problems in your house
[27:11] me too
[27:13] my problems in my house your problems in
[27:15] your house
[27:16] what brother Brown tell us he said you
[27:18] can't blame the pastor if you don't make
[27:19] it
[27:21] why that takes a lot off of me but you
[27:23] know what without
[27:25] a plan
[27:27] without a plan brother Brian said God
[27:28] had a plan and a purpose now watch the
[27:30] plan you sit down and you draw out a
[27:32] plan God sat down and dried the plan but
[27:34] he threw out a plan that didn't need an
[27:36] eraser
[27:37] when he drew it down he went this is the
[27:39] way it is and this is the best way
[27:42] you'll ever get here
[27:43] and it's the best way ever trial every
[27:45] tribulation that you go through God knew
[27:48] that it's the best way to get you where
[27:50] you're supposed to be everybody with me
[27:52] so we're going to get into that with a
[27:54] little bit of patience because what's
[27:55] the first thing brother Brown said have
[27:56] patience with not your neighbor not your
[27:58] pastor not your brother he said have
[28:00] patience with God
[28:02] that he'll do what he said he would do
[28:04] now that we don't
[28:06] because what the problem is is right
[28:08] here we're going to talk about it
[28:09] brother I'm in 1953. we're going to take
[28:12] a little side trip for just a minute but
[28:13] I think it's important that we see why
[28:16] we're struggling and why do we need to
[28:18] struggling fight
[28:20] what are we going to need miracles in
[28:21] the Millennium when we're supernatural
[28:23] beings how are we going to need these
[28:25] now the Bible says now are we the sons
[28:28] of God
[28:29] not now is now is a present tense
[28:33] now are we the sons not we will be we
[28:37] are now we are this morning we are this
[28:40] very hour now are we the sons of God
[28:43] what seated together as I said before
[28:46] when when when Paul writes that sitting
[28:48] you together in Heavenly places in
[28:49] Christ Jesus he says resurrected sitting
[28:52] in Heavenly places that's where the
[28:54] people got that the resurrection was
[28:56] over with this is a spiritual
[28:57] Resurrection not a natural Resurrection
[28:59] all right this is the spiritual
[29:01] resurrection that what happens there's
[29:03] now watch right this very minute we're
[29:05] seated together in Heavenly places in
[29:07] Christ Jesus you know every person
[29:09] sitting in here today if you're born
[29:11] again
[29:12] your soul is eternal your soul is God
[29:15] your soul only thanks God your soul Only
[29:18] Knows God your soul is God what our
[29:21] problem is it's so Bound by that second
[29:24] man
[29:25] not your flesh your flesh just holds all
[29:27] your guts and everything together but
[29:29] that second man in the spirit realm is
[29:31] our problem
[29:32] and we're going to get
[29:34] remember
[29:36] two places he said Satan put you in the
[29:39] pawn shop but then he also said Adam
[29:41] went and put you in the pawn shop
[29:43] because remember folks we we bash Eve
[29:45] pretty bad but listen he didn't put us
[29:47] in a pawn shop
[29:50] Adam put us in the pawn shop Adam's the
[29:53] one that took on as the second Adam
[29:55] would take on our sin he took on Eve sin
[29:58] everybody with me say Amen
[30:01] every man by one spirit will all baptize
[30:03] into one body become the members of this
[30:06] body by the Holy Baptist Holy Ghost
[30:08] baptism that's right here
[30:11] not here here
[30:15] now we're seated together in Heavenly
[30:17] places free from judgment we can never
[30:21] go to the judgment
[30:23] we were yesterday
[30:25] and I'm not bashing brother he only knew
[30:28] what he knew and Jonas and uh Sophia's
[30:34] um archery shoot they had a little
[30:35] brother stand up and
[30:37] he was making his point his whole point
[30:39] was we all got to go to judgment
[30:41] we all got to go to judgment we all got
[30:43] to go to judgment we got to do good down
[30:45] here but we all got to go to judgment
[30:47] no we don't
[30:49] no we don't
[30:52] that's what I mean one of the greatest
[30:53] doctrines I know of
[30:55] he said I ain't got to go to judgment
[30:58] no time do I have to go to judgment I
[31:01] don't want to be Catholic where I get
[31:02] halfway in hell
[31:03] purgatory and I got to be prayed out
[31:06] well I'm sorry it's called paid out
[31:09] amen pay novenas the more you got the
[31:12] more you get out
[31:14] no I want it to be on this right here
[31:16] that a man came and had
[31:20] the goods as brother Tom Fox used to say
[31:22] had the goods to get me out of the pawn
[31:24] shop now what's our problem is we can
[31:27] accept whether to go out or we can turn
[31:28] around and walk right back in the pawn
[31:30] shop
[31:31] I'll read it right here in just a second
[31:33] you can never go to judgment how can you
[31:36] be judged twice
[31:42] upon Christ I want somebody to be a
[31:45] little happy today if you don't mind I'm
[31:47] not a little teaching I'm gonna do a
[31:48] little preaching but Christ paid our
[31:50] Judgment at Calvary if we're in Christ
[31:52] we're secured in Christ
[31:55] listen that that Soul if you're born
[31:57] again it does not have bad days and good
[31:59] days
[32:01] it has all good days
[32:03] that Spirit Round though is like a
[32:04] roller coaster like the Scream Machine
[32:07] it's Six Flags
[32:09] you scream on the way down you scream on
[32:11] the way up
[32:13] and you scream when you're done
[32:15] if you've never been on a screen machine
[32:17] you ought to try it one time
[32:19] and realize that's your
[32:22] life
[32:23] in the spirit realm all right
[32:26] how do we get into Christ by one Spirit
[32:28] we're all baptized into one body it's
[32:30] what we've been talking about the New
[32:31] Birth we're into the body of Jesus
[32:33] Christ and while we're in there look
[32:36] we've accepted his punishment in our
[32:39] Stead man
[32:41] we've accepted his punishment in our
[32:45] stead he knowing no sin yet was made sin
[32:48] for us and then he blew our sickness
[32:51] he bore our sins and we came into him
[32:54] and we are free from these judgments
[32:57] somebody that's what that's for you
[32:59] that's and listen that's for Monday too
[33:04] every day it is and why
[33:08] somebody asked me one time long time ago
[33:10] said
[33:10] how many days your brother play golf I
[33:12] said every day that ends then why except
[33:14] on Sunday
[33:16] so it's every day
[33:17] God look God cannot just
[33:21] the second time
[33:25] God cannot justly judge me or you the
[33:29] second time if he's already accepted us
[33:32] in Christ Jesus and punished his own son
[33:34] for us
[33:36] how can he punish us then when he's
[33:38] already had Christ pay the price
[33:42] if I go down to the pawn shop
[33:45] I've got something
[33:48] I'm in some trouble so I got I I want to
[33:50] do I'm gonna put that in the pawn shop
[33:53] right and they're gonna let me borrow
[33:55] some money off of that
[33:56] but they're gonna give me a receipt
[34:00] they're gonna give me a receipt you keep
[34:02] one
[34:04] the person gets a receipt
[34:06] everybody with me
[34:08] I've never been to a pawn shop you'll
[34:10] learn something today I was in one one
[34:12] time don't want to go back
[34:15] even brother Brown said he said I don't
[34:17] like pawn shops
[34:18] that's another quote for another day
[34:20] if I go down to the pawn shop and I've
[34:22] got something that's just like the human
[34:24] life
[34:25] put us in the pawn shop so that's you
[34:28] that's your soul
[34:33] that's right devil put us in the pawn
[34:35] shop because of transgression
[34:37] which basically we did ourselves
[34:40] but if you've got something pawned and
[34:43] you go down and get that out you hand
[34:45] that receipt and you get that out
[34:49] I'm not in the pawn shop anymore
[34:52] I have been redeemed or the ransom has
[34:56] been paid for my soul
[35:00] now the problem is is we've got a spirit
[35:03] Realm
[35:04] and we go and we throw it right back
[35:06] into pawn shop
[35:08] Spirit realm now Spirit realm Soul can't
[35:11] be judged anymore but we can be judged
[35:13] in our spirit realm that's why there is
[35:15] a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body
[35:18] where the good or bad that's why the
[35:19] denominational world says we all got to
[35:21] go to judgment because the Bible says we
[35:23] all got to stand before the Judgment
[35:24] seat of Christ amen but that's not the
[35:26] major judgment that's not white Throne
[35:28] judgment we're going to be judged by
[35:30] what we're going to be judged by how
[35:31] much we use are not used
[35:35] these virtues
[35:37] that's why these virtues are very
[35:39] important
[35:42] you say brother why do I have to
[35:43] struggle because I'm if you say I'm born
[35:45] again
[35:46] do you want to have a miserable life
[35:50] if you don't want to have a miserable
[35:51] life then you start doing these things
[35:52] right here
[35:54] but now listen that's not going to make
[35:56] everything go away Jesus was every one
[35:58] of these and they hated him
[36:00] they hung him on a cross because he was
[36:02] God remember they said we don't hate you
[36:05] because of the Miracles we don't hate
[36:07] you because of signs and wonders we hate
[36:09] you because you're telling us you're God
[36:12] in human flesh
[36:15] they will hate you because you tell them
[36:17] you are God in human flesh
[36:21] as we read the first scripture we read
[36:24] but if you got something Pond and you go
[36:26] down and get that out of the pond you
[36:28] get a receipt for it you have a right to
[36:31] take it out
[36:32] so there's no need of trying to go down
[36:34] look if I had my watch and Pawn
[36:36] and you went down and took it out for me
[36:39] there's no need of me for going down
[36:40] there paying it again
[36:43] I can't pay it again because it's
[36:45] already been paid
[36:47] oh when I think of that something on the
[36:50] inside of me under this fifth rib on the
[36:52] left side of somebody's heart leaps
[36:54] higher than the skies because I know the
[36:56] devil had me in the pawn shop one time
[36:58] because of sin and transgression but
[37:00] Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn
[37:02] shop and redeemed me back to God
[37:06] listen God could not go into that pawn
[37:09] shop and get you out
[37:11] oh be quiet
[37:13] Jesus Christ had to go in the pawn shop
[37:15] and get you out you sure it's the same
[37:18] person yes it is the same person but
[37:19] it's another form
[37:21] it's another form because remember the
[37:24] right of redemption is is that you got
[37:27] to be a Kinsman
[37:31] so the Kinsman became the god became
[37:33] human flesh to be our Kinfolk then he
[37:35] walked in the pawn shop he said I got it
[37:37] right now because that's flesh in that
[37:40] pawn shop I am flesh but I paid the
[37:44] price for that go Keith come on I paid
[37:47] the price for that it's mine
[37:50] and here we go
[37:54] I don't know if I want to accept that or
[37:55] not
[37:57] all you got to do is accept he did it
[37:59] the 650 did it
[38:02] because I know the devil had me in the
[38:03] pawn shop one time because of sin and
[38:05] transgression but Jesus Christ took me
[38:07] out of the pawn shop and redeemed me
[38:10] back to God he didn't just redeem you
[38:12] back to being a human
[38:14] you're a human already he redeemed you
[38:16] back to God Almighty he redeemed you
[38:18] back to Elohim
[38:22] somebody one of these days y'all might
[38:24] get excited about some of this but I'm
[38:25] getting more excited excited excited
[38:27] about just the Plan of Redemption Just A
[38:30] Simple Plan of Redemption because if you
[38:32] don't get it you forget about going up
[38:33] through there
[38:35] but Jesus took me out of the pawn shop
[38:37] and redeemed me back to God that makes
[38:39] me his son this morning and it is not
[38:42] yet appear when I shall be in the final
[38:44] end but I know I'll have a body like his
[38:46] own glorious body
[38:48] for I shall be
[38:50] for I shall see him as he is free from
[38:52] sickness free
[38:54] from sin
[38:56] so your soul is out of the pawn shop
[38:59] your soul has been redeemed there's no
[39:02] way it can go back in and pay that debt
[39:04] a second time already why would I want
[39:07] to go back and pay three or four times
[39:08] for something that I had to put in the
[39:10] pawn shop
[39:13] let God do it for you
[39:16] some of y'all that are struggling let
[39:17] God do it for you let God say God I'm in
[39:19] a pawn shop
[39:21] even say God I know I'm redeemed but God
[39:23] I'm still in a pawn shop because I can't
[39:25] get over this virtue and get this
[39:27] knowledge because you know what there's
[39:28] a flip side to all this to have patience
[39:30] you got to be angry
[39:33] first
[39:36] to have virtue you got to be powerless
[39:38] first
[39:39] then God gives you virtue
[39:42] you got to be have the knowledge of the
[39:45] world remember terminology good and evil
[39:47] is your first knowledge
[39:53] then you start eating off the tree of
[39:55] life when you get born again
[39:57] so the Redemptive Act is not so hard to
[40:01] do just accept that he took you out of
[40:03] that pawn shop and put you in his shop
[40:07] just accept that and then we can go on
[40:09] my soul praise God my soul and intellect
[40:12] but the Bible is talking about
[40:12] revelation
[40:14] we're going to see in just a few minutes
[40:16] we'll get to it
[40:17] that Revelation is something that's
[40:19] previously not seen
[40:21] it's there though
[40:23] like brother Bob said about the Statue
[40:24] statues underneath that that that rap or
[40:28] that tarp
[40:29] but you really can't tell what it is it
[40:31] could be a monkey it could be an animal
[40:33] could be a bird it could be something
[40:35] sitting on a log you know kind of call
[40:36] like this and something sitting on the
[40:38] top but when it's pulled off you see
[40:40] it's a human right
[40:42] you see what's been built
[40:44] God shop praise God he saw you built he
[40:49] saw you already made he's just now he's
[40:51] began to pull the wraps off so that you
[40:54] and I can see the pull is what's going
[40:56] to take us out of here we're going to be
[40:59] shown to God one more time God's going
[41:02] to pull the veil off of the world's eyes
[41:04] and let him see me and you the real God
[41:08] the real place where God dwells
[41:12] not in a house
[41:14] not in a church
[41:17] in you
[41:18] God chose by the right of redemption to
[41:21] dwell in you
[41:23] because he became you
[41:26] that you my what
[41:28] become like him now become him
[41:33] the puzzle his pieces are fit back
[41:35] together
[41:36] you're out of the pawn shop praise God
[41:38] when you get out of that pawn shop
[41:39] there's no way there's anything being
[41:41] held against you no way
[41:44] nothing is held against you we asked her
[41:47] isn't that that is oh it's it's coming
[41:49] no it's not coming it's already here
[41:52] hey when you get a true revelation
[41:57] the things that you think I have to do
[42:01] will become things I want to do
[42:05] things I used to do
[42:07] I do them no more
[42:09] things I used to why
[42:12] told me he's gone
[42:15] the real me
[42:16] has been redeemed
[42:19] let me I don't have this I just pull
[42:21] this up real quick let me read this and
[42:23] then we'll continue on
[42:26] this year's 1964. brother bear said now
[42:29] could a righteous judge judge a man
[42:31] twice
[42:33] remember that's even in the law of the
[42:34] land you can't it's called double
[42:36] jeopardy for those of you that know
[42:38] anything about the law you can't be
[42:40] tried for a murder and be acquitted or
[42:42] be found not guilty
[42:45] and then they call you back in two weeks
[42:47] later so we're gonna try you for that
[42:48] again no it's called double jeopardy you
[42:50] can't do that even the law of the land
[42:52] proves that God done it one time and
[42:54] that's it right
[42:56] How could a righteous judge judge a man
[42:58] twice for anything if the penalty's
[43:00] already been paid if I was in the pawn
[43:03] shop and you came by and said I'm going
[43:05] to redeem him and you went in and paid
[43:07] the price for my Redemption that's my
[43:09] penalty of being in the pawn shop you
[43:12] pay my Redemption then how can the pawn
[43:14] broker the devil claim you again
[43:19] you'll get a life when he comes to this
[43:20] guy
[43:23] unless I sold out again there you are
[43:26] when I reject listen when I rejected the
[43:29] fullness of the word I go right back in
[43:32] the pawn shop
[43:33] fullness of the word I go right back in
[43:37] the pawn shop again then fight my way
[43:40] out
[43:41] if I can he said
[43:43] but he redeemed me I hope that I just
[43:46] got so many here I want to get in other
[43:47] words he's trying to get to the people
[43:52] to write of redemption
[43:57] so let's add to that
[43:59] let's add to your new birth let's add to
[44:02] what I just let's add to that you're out
[44:04] you're free
[44:06] right you're out of the pawn shop
[44:09] you never have to go back in unless you
[44:11] want to go back in
[44:13] now you can't lose your salvation but
[44:14] you can go back in and not go up their
[44:16] statue of perfect man
[44:18] can't lose your salvation can't lose
[44:21] your soul but now we're talking about a
[44:23] spirit realm we're talking about the the
[44:24] mental guy the spirit realm and we'll
[44:27] look at that this afternoon I think I
[44:28] got a couple quotes on that if I get to
[44:30] them
[44:30] that Spirit realm is is like the soul
[44:33] but it's not exactly because remember
[44:35] anointed ones at the end time can be
[44:38] black in their soul but their Spirit be
[44:41] anointed by this Holy Ghost I'm talking
[44:43] about but what they did was they didn't
[44:45] come out of the pawn shop they just got
[44:48] washed up a little bit and said I'm just
[44:50] fine right here
[44:51] I'm good they didn't accept what you and
[44:55] I have accepted if you're born again
[44:57] they didn't accept that so they stayed
[44:59] in there but remember they stayed bound
[45:02] you and I when we come out we're free
[45:06] praise the Lord
[45:08] add to your new birth
[45:11] or Minister that word ad means Minister
[45:13] Minister nourishment what are we getting
[45:15] today we're getting nourished when
[45:16] somebody's telling you you're free
[45:17] somebody's telling you don't have to go
[45:19] back in the pawn shop you don't have
[45:20] accept that box of snake right
[45:24] but what do we do we do anyway
[45:26] we're trying our best though to shave
[45:28] all that off to where we can have power
[45:31] or virtue with God we can have the not
[45:34] listen if you don't have the knowledge
[45:35] of God
[45:36] the knowledge of this world is
[45:38] foolishness to the knowledge of God
[45:40] foolishness
[45:41] that's why they when the very knowledge
[45:43] of God stood on the Earth
[45:46] Jesus
[45:48] stood on Earth and he told them exactly
[45:51] how he was going to come he told him
[45:53] exactly as brother Bob was talking about
[45:54] the Torah and all the different town
[45:56] mute and all that they studied that and
[45:58] studied it they loved Hosea Jeremiah
[46:00] they all spoke Jesus looked at him he
[46:03] said they ever want to speak of me
[46:05] why are you killing me they said well
[46:08] you didn't come the way we thought you
[46:09] ought to come
[46:10] am right
[46:13] it came exactly he fulfilled the old
[46:17] the older man will be revealed you and I
[46:19] are going to fulfill the word so much
[46:21] they're gonna hate us
[46:23] are going to hate us
[46:26] I hate to say that but that's exactly
[46:28] where's the most persecution come from
[46:30] inside
[46:32] this was sitting right beside Jesus on
[46:34] the night he was betrayed nobody knew it
[46:36] but one guy and that was the son of man
[46:38] he had enough discernment to know what
[46:40] Judas was
[46:42] foreign
[46:44] to supply furnish
[46:46] to be supplied in other words add to
[46:49] assisted
[46:50] and why has this got to happen why is
[46:52] there a restoration got to come because
[46:54] we're in the pawn shop
[46:56] that's not where we were supposed to be
[46:59] we were supposed to be free Adam and Eve
[47:02] were supposed to have children by the
[47:04] spoken word of God we were to multiply
[47:06] and replenish this Earth not by sex we
[47:08] were supposed to not ever have a
[47:10] headache not ever have a disease not
[47:11] ever have a bad day
[47:14] it's laying right inside you today
[47:17] though what do you mean some kind of a
[47:19] story or history is where the Bible said
[47:21] you know it's something I think brother
[47:22] John he was talking about this morning
[47:24] it's something way I started what have I
[47:25] told y'all
[47:26] we're a bunch of Tunis
[47:28] Jesus is Way Out younger
[47:30] and we're over here just struggling
[47:33] no he's right here
[47:35] he's the same person
[47:37] I had a brother ask a question online
[47:39] I'm gonna cover it real quick
[47:42] but he said sorry I meant to say John 17
[47:44] 25 he said are you saying this is not
[47:46] another being because I said that when
[47:49] Genesis 1 26 he was talking
[47:51] he couldn't be talking to another person
[47:53] I know brother Brown verbatim quoted
[47:55] that he was talking to another being now
[47:56] look if you look the word being up that
[47:58] means person
[48:00] so he's not talking to another person
[48:05] if he is he's talking to the devil
[48:07] that's the only two people that was
[48:09] there when he was talking
[48:10] but you and I were inside of him
[48:13] and by him knowing that he could talk
[48:16] directly to me and you but he's not
[48:18] talking to another person
[48:21] he's talking to another form of himself
[48:25] that's what you and I another form of
[48:28] himself not another person
[48:31] another form
[48:33] so you can't be a being and when I don't
[48:35] I'm not trying to correct brother brown
[48:36] but that word being means person he
[48:39] wasn't saying that he was talking he's
[48:40] saying he was talking to and then morphe
[48:43] he's talking to a god that moved over in
[48:46] another form so that we could understand
[48:48] that the Son of God had unlimited power
[48:51] and now he's coming down and he's going
[48:53] to be in the beginning what's the word
[48:57] and the Word was God
[48:59] and the Word was made flesh Elohim
[49:02] became flesh not another person that's
[49:04] denominationalism that's where they get
[49:06] three Gods that's where they get the
[49:07] trinitarian idea
[49:09] they're the street persons in the
[49:10] godhead
[49:12] can't be
[49:14] can't be a step from being
[49:16] unless he's talking to the devil
[49:19] is everybody with me on that
[49:22] So when you say being you have to be
[49:24] careful but when a being is another
[49:25] person but it was not another person God
[49:27] was talking to person is a personality
[49:30] unless it's the devil and he's not
[49:32] telling the devil let us make man in our
[49:34] own image the devil didn't have a part
[49:36] of that actually you know what he hated
[49:39] that day that happened
[49:41] and he's been hating it for thousands
[49:43] and millions of years
[49:45] he hated the day God said something and
[49:47] some form came out of him that was him
[49:50] and Satan couldn't understand so he's
[49:52] like
[49:53] you come from
[49:56] hold on man I'm not done yet
[49:59] let there be
[50:01] I got to start making devil you go over
[50:03] Yonder I gotta start making stuff
[50:04] because that was a creator
[50:06] the Creator God but all that got lost by
[50:09] what Adam put us in a pawn shop
[50:11] I will restore to you though to you
[50:15] whatever Adam lost in the garden I'm
[50:18] going to restore it back and it's got to
[50:21] be in an entire people
[50:23] because only this time it's the true
[50:27] revelation of the son of man if you want
[50:29] we'll get into that though some maybe I
[50:31] understand that but
[50:32] but the son of man was a word made flesh
[50:35] son of man has got to be the word made
[50:37] flesh in me and you you and I have to
[50:39] become the son of man where what we
[50:40] speak is what God Said
[50:43] can't do that well you know go somewhere
[50:45] else
[50:47] you become an unbeliever
[50:52] I believe what God Said
[50:55] and I'm waiting on the manifestation of
[50:57] you say well you're waiting um see it's
[51:00] right here
[51:02] patience
[51:04] to wait on who did I say God
[51:07] that he'll do what he said he would do
[51:09] that's the problem with Eve she couldn't
[51:10] wait on God to get his plan fulfilled
[51:13] she had to help him
[51:16] that's the way listen that same spirit
[51:19] is in the church today
[51:22] remember brother random he was
[51:24] Discerning that brother walking through
[51:25] the house
[51:27] he went to the brother and said brother
[51:28] said you commit an adultery on your wife
[51:31] he said no brother grandma and then the
[51:32] angel remember brother Ryan said the
[51:34] angel took him over to the side and said
[51:36] no he's messing with organized religion
[51:38] that denominational idea is a
[51:40] system to God
[51:43] just like Eve was it's a horse system to
[51:45] God and it can't be brought back this is
[51:48] restoring me and you
[51:50] because we're able to be restored we're
[51:52] able for somebody to get us out of the
[51:55] pawn shop and we accept that and we
[51:58] gotta start believing that because he
[52:01] said I will restore to you
[52:04] the years the locusts eaten all the way
[52:05] down
[52:07] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[52:12] and praise the name of the Lord that
[52:14] have to dealt what wondrously with you
[52:17] and my people shall never listen if
[52:19] you're ashamed of this message if you're
[52:20] ashamed of this gospel you need a new
[52:22] birth
[52:24] you need a new birth
[52:33] I kind of was thinking about this the
[52:35] other day
[52:36] and I believe Lord want me to put this
[52:39] in here do you remember the dream or the
[52:41] vision brother Brown had about the bride
[52:42] coming into preview
[52:45] if not I'm going to read it to you
[52:47] everybody all right with this
[52:49] but this is part of you this is this is
[52:51] listen this is the vision
[52:54] that reveals to me where I am I'm the
[52:57] bride I'm not a church I'm the bride and
[53:00] the bride has to come into preview twice
[53:03] the church only comes into preview one
[53:05] time and remember she was naked she was
[53:07] twisting she was rock and roll
[53:09] that was the churches out there I'm
[53:12] telling you what brother Brown said I'm
[53:13] not making it up
[53:14] then I have to watch her watch he she'll
[53:17] get out of step with that word if I
[53:19] don't watch remember the second bride
[53:22] the second preview
[53:24] the women in the back
[53:27] got out of Step
[53:29] he said get back your line now look it
[53:32] didn't make her church
[53:34] she was still bright
[53:36] she just got out of staff
[53:40] she'll get out of step with that word if
[53:42] I don't watch
[53:44] and when she's passing by
[53:47] when she's passing by if she gets by
[53:50] maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see
[53:53] when I'm finished or whatever is
[53:55] what they were getting back trying their
[53:57] best and was getting back get in line
[53:59] because what happened now the first the
[54:01] first preview of the bride was beautiful
[54:04] everything was in order
[54:07] First Church ages there were no
[54:08] denominational idea there was no eternal
[54:10] hell there was no father son Holy Ghost
[54:12] baptism it was a pure bride
[54:15] but couldn't be complete without the
[54:19] Omega bride
[54:21] that's the two previews what happened in
[54:24] between that a church was born
[54:27] prostitutes came out of the mother
[54:29] sorry strong words but that's what the
[54:31] prophet said
[54:33] so what they were getting back trying
[54:35] their best so which one was getting out
[54:37] of line
[54:38] the second group
[54:40] first group was not
[54:41] they went on off brother Ramsey went on
[54:43] off into heaven he said now the church
[54:45] come into view the naked girls and all
[54:46] that they fell off and was swailing and
[54:49] screaming and all that he said he said
[54:52] he was like oh well Lord that's that's
[54:55] my American church and remember the
[54:58] angel said the bride will come into
[55:00] preview one more time
[55:02] praise God
[55:04] that's me and you I
[55:05] said he got our line
[55:11] they was looking out somewhere else look
[55:13] watching about that church that just
[55:15] went into chaos so what were they doing
[55:17] they were marching and they were looking
[55:18] at the church
[55:20] remember John admired the church it was
[55:22] beautiful
[55:24] but when she fell off into
[55:26] you read the whole thing chaos
[55:29] but the the front one's never the back
[55:32] ones just two or three of them
[55:35] was kind of stepping out a little bit to
[55:37] the right hand side
[55:39] not staying balanced stepping off to the
[55:41] right hand side and looked like was
[55:43] trying to get back in line as they went
[55:45] by
[55:46] they was just past me and oh as far as
[55:48] here to the wall passed me and I was
[55:49] standing there now I just seen it all
[55:51] move out and leave but you notice the
[55:54] church only comes into view one time
[55:56] each Nation the church but the bride
[55:58] comes into view twice
[56:00] see what it is or what it was now not
[56:04] knowing it but look at it with my
[56:06] message this morning not knowing that
[56:08] see the seed fell in the ground at Nicea
[56:11] so the first bride was what first three
[56:13] Church ages
[56:15] then what came along Nicea
[56:18] the church
[56:20] buy with me the church happened
[56:23] denomination happened
[56:25] man's ideas happen and then God sent a
[56:28] prophet
[56:30] to say now I don't call you church I
[56:33] call you bride
[56:34] I brought you out of that group that was
[56:36] naked blind wretched miserable and don't
[56:38] know it
[56:39] I praise God what a plan and it's your
[56:41] partner
[56:47] the seed fell on the ground and I see
[56:49] you that was the original seed that one
[56:51] false seed that was the original seed
[56:53] and she's come to the process of these
[56:56] denominations which only comes in
[56:58] existence once but the bride returns
[57:01] back again in the last day I will
[57:04] restore see the Masterpiece is brought
[57:07] up
[57:09] that's the reason she was in view
[57:11] reviewed the second time watch she was
[57:14] reviewed the first time
[57:16] then she was reviewed the second time
[57:19] and she was perfectly the second time
[57:22] like she was the first time oh God have
[57:25] mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain
[57:27] right quick now watch
[57:30] so you if you look at the pyramid
[57:34] you've got a preview of The Bride these
[57:36] three ages right here you've got a
[57:39] preview of The Bride walking just
[57:40] perfect everything right
[57:42] then you've got now see it happens right
[57:45] here the Dark Ages not that they're not
[57:47] bright it's just they were not complete
[57:50] they had their ideas and God winked at
[57:52] some of their ignorance amen anybody
[57:55] with me but to get right here
[57:58] that outpouring of the holy spirit that
[58:00] we're looking at there had to come a
[58:02] second preview
[58:03] there had to come a second part
[58:06] and then we kind of got out of line a
[58:08] little bit
[58:09] because you know what just like some of
[58:11] us we don't do everything God tells us
[58:14] to do
[58:15] I'm sorry I don't do everything God
[58:17] tells you do if y'all do that's okay
[58:18] pray for me
[58:22] you say that they look at you like well
[58:24] that happened to you
[58:26] and watch this ow
[58:31] L I have two kids
[58:33] I'm human
[58:37] Josh is in the back oh look all others
[58:40] never appear no more look they never
[58:42] appeared so when God was done with them
[58:45] he was done with them
[58:47] they went out never to come back again
[58:49] but the bride came back
[58:52] because she was Alpha and Omega God the
[58:55] great sculptor has made him a
[58:57] masterpiece for it is a peace of his
[59:00] first masterpiece
[59:02] in other words he got us out of the pawn
[59:04] shop because we were a part of him
[59:07] before the foundation of the world we
[59:09] just got caught
[59:11] remember between Satan and Eve
[59:14] Adam took on her sin so we got put in a
[59:17] pawn shop
[59:18] we didn't come the way God wanted us to
[59:19] come
[59:21] but thank God
[59:22] the restoration of the Bride tree real
[59:24] quick may not get too far but that's
[59:26] okay I wanted us to make sure we see
[59:28] this you've got to know not think
[59:31] and not hope hope is good but faith is
[59:35] the substance of things hoped for so you
[59:37] hope for it
[59:39] then there's a journey that's called
[59:41] faith
[59:42] then there's a reality
[59:44] I do not need faith brother George to
[59:47] get to church today I'm standing here
[59:50] now I had to have faith to get in the
[59:52] car some of y'all that drive Forge
[59:57] you had to have more faith
[1:00:01] pickup trucks basically
[1:00:04] boys going
[1:00:09] but you had to have faith
[1:00:11] your wife was going up early that that
[1:00:13] you know your kids was going to all get
[1:00:15] together at the same time
[1:00:19] you get
[1:00:20] do you get do you get dressed and all
[1:00:22] ready for you Mama does
[1:00:24] nope didn't think so
[1:00:26] hey look when a kid looks at you and
[1:00:28] goes
[1:00:33] I didn't pick on your sister okay I'll
[1:00:35] pick on you
[1:00:36] I bet you she gets ready for you do
[1:00:40] come on now you're left-handed you got
[1:00:41] to be able to do something more better
[1:00:43] than she can
[1:00:46] but you know what God looks that's the
[1:00:47] same way he says look come on get ready
[1:00:50] we gotta go quit messing around
[1:00:54] because here we are here
[1:00:56] that God is here to do exceeding it
[1:00:59] abundantly whatever we ask him for
[1:01:02] we need to ask him for what Revelation
[1:01:05] brother Brown said not not we sure we're
[1:01:07] sick sure we need financial sure we need
[1:01:10] a new job brother Brown said pray for
[1:01:12] Revelation more than anything
[1:01:14] why because what would Revelation do to
[1:01:16] show you who you are it'll show you
[1:01:18] where you're at it'll show you your
[1:01:20] issues it'll show you your problems and
[1:01:23] it'll do one thing for sure if it's a
[1:01:25] true Revelation it'll show you how to
[1:01:26] get rid of them
[1:01:28] it won't be a thought it won't be a hope
[1:01:31] anymore it won't even be Faith anymore
[1:01:34] it'll be a reality
[1:01:36] I'm gonna have faith that my body's
[1:01:38] gonna be changed but one day praise God
[1:01:41] it will be changed and I will not need
[1:01:43] Faith anymore
[1:01:44] we'll not need faith in the Millennium
[1:01:46] what do you need faith for when you're
[1:01:48] perfect
[1:01:53] but we had four Messengers killed that
[1:01:55] tree in between those that Dark Age time
[1:01:59] so with four death Messengers come and
[1:02:02] they suck the life out of that tree
[1:02:05] all the way down to the roots
[1:02:09] for God said I will restore he's going
[1:02:11] to restore it by four death Messengers
[1:02:13] killed it four life Messengers were
[1:02:16] restored
[1:02:17] not three
[1:02:20] four is the four is the number of man we
[1:02:22] know sometimes it's a bad number but
[1:02:23] four is a number of restoration that's
[1:02:25] what it is right here
[1:02:27] by four death Messengers killed it then
[1:02:29] four life Messengers will restore it
[1:02:31] what was the first Martin Luther
[1:02:32] justification what was the second John
[1:02:34] Wesley by sanctification what was the
[1:02:36] third Pentecost with the restoration of
[1:02:38] the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the
[1:02:40] Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word
[1:02:42] that was the prophet's message
[1:02:44] brought him out of Pentecost now
[1:02:46] Pentecost stayed where they were at they
[1:02:48] stayed in their own little pawn shop
[1:02:51] Christ came to a little man to say
[1:02:54] I can get you out not brother Branham I
[1:02:57] Jesus Christ can show you the word so
[1:02:59] that you can get out of that pawn shop
[1:03:01] speaking in tongues there's not the
[1:03:03] total evidence it's good
[1:03:05] restoration the gifts are good
[1:03:09] but getting out of that pawn shop way
[1:03:11] better than having gifts because gifts
[1:03:13] and callings are without repentance you
[1:03:14] can have all the gifts in the world
[1:03:15] still being the phone shop
[1:03:17] but once you come out of that pawn shop
[1:03:19] if Jesus Christ brings you out you're
[1:03:21] born again
[1:03:22] right there your soul is redeemed
[1:03:25] that's what I want you to see but as
[1:03:27] your soul is redeemed through
[1:03:28] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:03:30] Holy Ghost you've got to put the word in
[1:03:32] it
[1:03:33] you can't just well I'm born again I
[1:03:34] don't have to go to church anymore
[1:03:38] where'd you get that at
[1:03:43] unlike a preacher's Dead one time
[1:03:46] what most y'all ought to do is
[1:03:48] is you ought to look on your calendar
[1:03:51] and think today's Monday
[1:03:56] because most people get healed on Monday

[1:04:44] and I believe that's what we're under
[1:04:46] now with the preaching of brother
[1:04:47] Branham and then the preaching of what
[1:04:49] brother Dale's been preaching all that
[1:04:50] it's a progressive word
[1:04:53] it's being progressed we're being
[1:04:55] Progressive some I'm sorry I think about
[1:04:57] the other day all the people that left
[1:04:59] the church and I pray for them I don't I
[1:05:01] don't not like them I mean I will I wish
[1:05:03] we were the church was packed and we had
[1:05:06] to find another building with all the
[1:05:08] people that's left and they're wandering
[1:05:10] out in the world
[1:05:14] they will
[1:05:16] if you believe
[1:05:17] you become that word
[1:05:20] and didn't the word tell you you asked

[1:05:31] prophets will I I'll go a little bit
[1:05:34] further is that okay it's just 11 30.
[1:05:35] one of them Martin Luther he began to
[1:05:37] shine a little light
[1:05:40] it's a very small strength of
[1:05:41] justification Along Came Wesley stronger
[1:05:43] sanctification after Wesley come the
[1:05:46] stronger than him Pentecostal the
[1:05:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[1:05:49] great prophet we've been taught that
[1:05:52] remember the prophet the Pentecost was
[1:05:53] not brother random
[1:05:55] hey man it was the Holy Ghost himself
[1:05:57] that's what brother Brown said
[1:06:00] because if not you'd make brother a
[1:06:02] messenger to the Pentecostal people not
[1:06:06] the Holy Ghost come on today at
[1:06:07] Pentecost 1906 to restore the gifts that
[1:06:10] day cabbage down and said no this is it
[1:06:12] we're done later ain't former rain we're
[1:06:14] gone we're out of here this is the great
[1:06:16] Revival do you hear about that Revival
[1:06:18] that's going on in Asheboro Kentucky
[1:06:19] Ashbury College
[1:06:21] been going for days
[1:06:24] we can't get y'all to come one day
[1:06:26] it's been going days weeks I'm talking
[1:06:29] 24 hours
[1:06:31] there's somebody in that service praying
[1:06:33] worshiping God
[1:06:35] that's been going on for five six seven
[1:06:37] days solid
[1:06:41] but you know what
[1:06:43] without the true word of God
[1:06:46] sure God can save them
[1:06:49] but they ain't a bright one if they
[1:06:51] ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:52] it's just emotion it's just sensation
[1:06:55] it's just we're having a Revival that's
[1:06:58] why I want us to have a word Revival
[1:07:00] the word Revival will start in the soul
[1:07:03] teach us what to do and it'll work its
[1:07:05] way out then if we want to shout that's
[1:07:07] great if we want to run that's great for
[1:07:08] want to speak in tongues that's great I
[1:07:10] pray that we speak in tongue I pray that
[1:07:11] something comes into this church of
[1:07:13] Prophecy to stand up and say hey you're
[1:07:15] not living right or hey you need to go
[1:07:17] do this or hey you need to go do that it
[1:07:19] scares to death we'd all be halfway off
[1:07:21] the building before these come said
[1:07:22] stuff because I was junk in our life I'm
[1:07:24] me included
[1:07:27] we'll get clocked that's okay you better
[1:07:29] pay attention one day God's gonna bring
[1:07:31] something I promise you we're going to
[1:07:32] get cleaned up
[1:07:34] we're gonna get cleaned up because even
[1:07:36] the Bible says the congregation of the
[1:07:39] righteous there will be no one
[1:07:41] no sinner sitting in this congregation
[1:07:48] but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah
[1:07:51] to come with a very word the word of the
[1:07:53] Lord came to the prophet and the evening
[1:07:55] light is to come forth to restore and
[1:07:58] bring back turn the hearts of the
[1:07:59] children back to the faith of God fourth
[1:08:02] light four Killers took it four
[1:08:04] Messengers destroyed it four messages of
[1:08:06] death took it away what in Dogma
[1:08:09] Creed
[1:08:10] not word
[1:08:12] and then brother I'm saying it in
[1:08:14] non-word there's nothing to question if
[1:08:15] you're standing here today with non-word
[1:08:17] nothing is quickening today it's just
[1:08:19] going right over your head unless you
[1:08:20] pull it down and say hey that's for me
[1:08:22] hey that's for me
[1:08:27] for Messengers righteousness restored
[1:08:29] her back again prophesy son of man ain't
[1:08:32] what we're coming to son of man can
[1:08:33] these bones live
[1:08:35] wish we had time I got a rope down here
[1:08:37] but I have to miss it prophecy because
[1:08:39] these bones live what's the fourth stage
[1:08:41] that's coming forth of that church
[1:08:43] that's the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[1:08:45] bones remember the dry bones came
[1:08:48] together but they just stood there
[1:08:49] without number four
[1:08:52] what was number four breathe o Breath of
[1:08:55] God now breathe whole Breath of God now
[1:08:58] breathe what not the Holy Ghost
[1:09:01] your dad would dead without the Holy
[1:09:02] Ghost you are but I'm about to dry bones
[1:09:04] standing up you're dead without it
[1:09:06] but the life only comes not when the sin
[1:09:09] you skin was on them but when the wind
[1:09:11] blowed upon them that's when come back
[1:09:14] that fourth message of life
[1:09:16] I will restore us after Lord hallelujah
[1:09:19] Glory praise be to God the fourth light
[1:09:21] is to come that will bring forth the
[1:09:22] same sign listen we are living in that
[1:09:26] light now
[1:09:27] it's not coming it's here
[1:09:31] justification brought back to Paul
[1:09:33] sanctification brought back the mark
[1:09:35] doctrine of Holiness what brought back
[1:09:37] the leads what Pentecost what does the
[1:09:39] leaves do when the wind blows
[1:09:41] but you know what if it's dead you ever
[1:09:44] seen a dead tree below no it just does
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:46] then it breaks off
[1:09:49] but when you got life
[1:09:53] y'all want to try that sometime maybe
[1:09:54] I'll give you a little bit of life
[1:09:56] rejoicing I don't want us to be a bunch
[1:09:58] of Pentecostal people but I want you to
[1:10:00] be a little more joyful than you are now
[1:10:01] you've got
[1:10:03] eternal life and your soul
[1:10:05] and I hope you're listening to the word
[1:10:07] of God now it'll make you happy
[1:10:09] I'll put them to
[1:10:13] them too what the fourth was the word
[1:10:15] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[1:10:19] proof of the Resurrection sign that
[1:10:21] Christ says finally
[1:10:24] finally after justification been planted
[1:10:26] sanctification being planted baptism of
[1:10:29] the Holy Ghost organizations died out
[1:10:33] and Christ has again centered himself
[1:10:35] look like the cap of the pyramid
[1:10:38] first line justification sanctification
[1:10:40] baptism logos then the coming of the cap
[1:10:43] what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being
[1:10:45] honed what are we doing today we're
[1:10:47] being honed
[1:10:49] all the stuff we don't need should be
[1:10:52] shaved off
[1:10:55] so that it can fit with the same kind of
[1:10:57] ministry he had when he went away
[1:11:00] who went away the Son of God didn't go
[1:11:02] away
[1:11:03] the son of man went away
[1:11:05] got a human flesh went away so that he
[1:11:08] can send back the son of God
[1:11:10] in the Holy Ghost to be with the people
[1:11:12] number three
[1:11:15] justification application Son of God
[1:11:18] fourth is the son of man
[1:11:20] the word made flesh is the son of man I
[1:11:23] just read that to you in John 1 1.
[1:11:27] same kind of ministry he had when he
[1:11:29] went away when he went away was there a
[1:11:31] doctrine of of three gods
[1:11:33] when he went away was there a father son
[1:11:35] Holy Ghost baptism when he went away was
[1:11:37] there a Baptist idea
[1:11:40] it was a pure word
[1:11:42] but it was the infancy of it it was the
[1:11:45] beginning of it you had to have a Alpha
[1:11:47] and Omega according to the Bible the
[1:11:49] beginning and the end
[1:11:51] watch this
[1:11:53] same kind of ministry he had when he
[1:11:55] went away that when he comes back it'll
[1:11:58] catch the whole thing in the Rapture
[1:12:00] where the Justified Sanctified and the
[1:12:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[1:12:05] will stand again the house of God will
[1:12:08] live again whether you go or not whether
[1:12:10] I go or not this is going to be made
[1:12:13] manifest
[1:12:15] the Tree of Life
[1:12:17] is growing again where out in the field
[1:12:20] oh and you
[1:12:23] remember I read you the scripture she is
[1:12:25] a tree of life
[1:12:26] she is the bride is the tree of life
[1:12:28] that's the only Tree of Life this
[1:12:31] man I know y'all walk out in the world
[1:12:33] and rub shoulders with him so do I I
[1:12:35] feel sorry for them they have they have
[1:12:37] no idea what's coming
[1:12:39] they look toward government
[1:12:41] they look for the denomination the
[1:12:43] Methodist Church is getting ready to
[1:12:44] split there may be some Churches to
[1:12:46] empty we could buy real cheap but no the
[1:12:49] Methodist Church is fixing to split wide
[1:12:50] open
[1:12:51] they won't allow prostitute they won't
[1:12:53] allow uh prostitutes they won't allow
[1:12:55] gays some want some will
[1:12:58] right so they're going to split
[1:13:00] neighbor I was talking to a neighbor the
[1:13:01] other day and I said what are you going
[1:13:02] to do Jerry he said he said I might just
[1:13:04] start my own church
[1:13:07] I thought you might could try coming to
[1:13:09] your neighbor's church and see what's
[1:13:10] going on over here
[1:13:13] but you know what we got the same thing
[1:13:15] in the message folks I mean we can say
[1:13:16] well we're up here we got all this clean
[1:13:18] no we got all kind of denominations in
[1:13:20] this in the in the church too in the
[1:13:22] bride well not the bride but in the
[1:13:24] so-called the uh
[1:13:27] we call them the mixed multitude
[1:13:30] but listen brother Brown said this
[1:13:32] Brides brides churches Brides churches
[1:13:35] he makes a big long he said but there's
[1:13:37] going to come one
[1:13:38] there's gonna come one people one group
[1:13:42] that's going to take this message and
[1:13:44] live it
[1:13:45] not talk it
[1:13:47] live it
[1:13:49] and going to manifest watch this right
[1:13:52] here then we'll close
[1:13:54] I didn't even get to knowledge
[1:13:58] tell me my brother tell me my sister
[1:13:59] when was the time that the sons of God
[1:14:01] was ever to be manifested outside of
[1:14:04] this time
[1:14:05] this time right now
[1:14:07] where were there ever a time in history
[1:14:09] that manifests the time to deliver all
[1:14:12] nature
[1:14:13] nature nature itself has grown and
[1:14:15] waiting for the time of the
[1:14:16] manifestation why before the atonement
[1:14:18] was made before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:14:20] poured out all the Old Testament on down
[1:14:22] here there couldn't have been
[1:14:23] manifestation
[1:14:26] what brother I'm saying is let me
[1:14:28] interplay
[1:14:30] they were in the pawn shop and they
[1:14:31] couldn't get out because the blood of
[1:14:33] bulls and goats just covered them while
[1:14:34] they were in there
[1:14:36] didn't save a person
[1:14:38] Holy Ghost filled person in the Old
[1:14:40] Testament
[1:14:42] it just Cape older covered it so that
[1:14:44] God couldn't see it but you and I come
[1:14:46] to a place where you were taken out of
[1:14:48] the pawn shop and listen God's able to
[1:14:50] use this thing now
[1:14:52] it's not inside and locked up behind the
[1:14:54] devil's door you get out here where God
[1:14:56] can use this thing
[1:15:01] y'all be like an old chainsaw
[1:15:04] you look in the pawn shop and you see
[1:15:06] chainsaws I don't know why people they
[1:15:07] must not like to work that they put
[1:15:10] their chainsaws up for
[1:15:12] Pawn
[1:15:15] I hope the devil
[1:15:18] watches that and the Lord goes and gets
[1:15:21] that chainsaw
[1:15:23] and that's you
[1:15:25] and I hope he comes out and he uses it
[1:15:28] that's brother Ernie Villanueva said not
[1:15:30] just we're not just going to peck on
[1:15:31] this devil
[1:15:33] he said hack him
[1:15:36] went through all that
[1:15:38] uh I want to take the chainsaw with
[1:15:40] double
[1:15:41] double chains on it and cut that sucker
[1:15:44] to pieces
[1:15:46] you say oh you just aren't you tired of
[1:15:48] the devil beating on you
[1:15:50] aren't you just really tired of the
[1:15:51] devil just beating on you
[1:15:53] living in your house
[1:15:55] well guess what there's a provision if
[1:15:59] you do what God said the problem is we
[1:16:01] don't
[1:16:04] look it had to wait till this time now
[1:16:07] all things have been brought coming
[1:16:08] shaped into a headstone to the
[1:16:09] manifestation of the sons of God coming
[1:16:12] back and the spirit of God coming into
[1:16:14] these men what these fivefold Ministry
[1:16:17] not one take church right
[1:16:19] the spirit of God coming into these men
[1:16:22] so perfectly until their Ministry
[1:16:25] their ministry will be so close like
[1:16:27] Christ will join him in the church
[1:16:29] together
[1:16:31] I got to cover this because Bob covered
[1:16:32] it while it's fresh he knows mine I'm
[1:16:34] gonna scroll through here close your
[1:16:35] eyes if it's makes you sick
[1:16:39] see how far down it was
[1:16:41] right here revelation
[1:16:44] because brother Brown said look there is
[1:16:46] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[1:16:49] revelation of the word of God
[1:16:50] nothing
[1:16:52] nothing of such prevailing power not
[1:16:54] just up power one day and down the next
[1:16:56] prevailing power means all the time
[1:16:59] that means working all the time in your
[1:17:02] life
[1:17:03] there's nothing such prevailing power is
[1:17:05] the revelation of the word
[1:17:07] and what does that word revelation mean
[1:17:08] the act or process of disclosing
[1:17:11] something previously secret are obscure
[1:17:14] especially look something true
[1:17:18] so we know God's truth we know he's the
[1:17:21] truth we know he's the word so if
[1:17:23] there's anything covered by him when we
[1:17:25] uncover it it's got to be truth
[1:17:27] it can't be uh copy
[1:17:31] we see a lot of copies of Moses sitting
[1:17:34] on that throne with a little piece off
[1:17:35] of his knee but there's one original
[1:17:37] over there somewhere in the Louvre or
[1:17:39] wherever it is over in France somebody's
[1:17:40] got it over there there's an original
[1:17:42] but there's a bunch of little bitty ones
[1:17:43] you see them all over the place we're
[1:17:45] not that
[1:17:47] we're off the original that's why he had
[1:17:49] to Smite that they smoke us
[1:17:52] a piece of himself it's a PCU
[1:17:55] the active process of disclosing
[1:17:57] something previously secret or obscure
[1:17:58] especially something true a fact
[1:18:02] disclosed or revealed especially in a
[1:18:04] dramatic
[1:18:06] I like that or surprising way wow never
[1:18:10] seen that before
[1:18:11] listen this right here musicians come on
[1:18:13] let's stay God's disclosure of his own
[1:18:16] what nature
[1:18:19] listen when you get a revelation it's
[1:18:20] not some man's idea it's a revelation of
[1:18:23] God's nature
[1:18:25] God's wanting you to see him that's why
[1:18:27] the statue perfect man is so important
[1:18:29] it is him being made manifest or made
[1:18:32] known in a bride it's never been before
[1:18:36] just the beginning of time God's
[1:18:39] disclosure of his own nature and his
[1:18:41] purpose for mankind the plan
[1:18:45] especially through the words of human
[1:18:49] Not Angels
[1:18:52] do you say Angels no it says human
[1:18:55] intermediaries Apostles prophets pastors
[1:18:59] teachers evangelists Sunday school
[1:19:01] teachers
[1:19:03] something in which such a Divine
[1:19:05] disclosure is contained such as in the
[1:19:07] Bible
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] so there's no providing power the
[1:19:12] prevailing overcoming church is built on
[1:19:15] Revelation so we can expect God to
[1:19:17] reveal his truth to us however you
[1:19:21] actually don't need a revelation on
[1:19:22] water baptism is right there staring you
[1:19:24] in the face
[1:19:25] wow I bet you them people sitting in
[1:19:28] that Auditorium that day
[1:19:30] that we're trinitarians thought man this
[1:19:32] guy's crazy that's why they hated him
[1:19:34] that's why he kept hating him because
[1:19:35] why they kept hating Jesus he was
[1:19:37] wonderful Jesus had 50 000 people 25 000
[1:19:40] people
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:42] when he died there was one
[1:19:45] him
[1:19:46] was the only person left
[1:19:49] brother Branham when he started
[1:19:51] preaching us as a
[1:19:53] scrolling through YouTube the other day
[1:19:55] and it's some I can't remember The
[1:19:56] Minister's name
[1:19:58] um Roth
[1:20:00] David Roth anyway he's a he's a
[1:20:03] commentary you know he brings people in
[1:20:05] well he brought this guy in young kid I
[1:20:08] want to smack him in the face brought
[1:20:10] this young whipper snapper in and he
[1:20:12] talked about William Branham no greater
[1:20:14] gift
[1:20:16] the whole healing movement was by this
[1:20:19] William Marion Branham and I mean I
[1:20:21] thought man this guy's got to be a
[1:20:22] message preacher
[1:20:24] he got right to the end you know what he
[1:20:26] said
[1:20:27] he said but he was probably about the
[1:20:29] worst Bible teacher I've ever heard
[1:20:36] I thought dude
[1:20:38] you're totally deceived
[1:20:41] why would God that's why I want to ask
[1:20:43] these people that that's run away from
[1:20:45] the message
[1:20:46] brother Brian didn't preach he wasn't a
[1:20:48] flash in the pan
[1:20:49] he went in a 30 minute
[1:20:51] John the Baptist six months and he's
[1:20:53] gone he preached 30 years
[1:20:56] God Vindicated him for all 30 of them
[1:20:59] how could God
[1:21:01] a man can't keep it together
[1:21:04] I threw that prophet he kept everything
[1:21:06] together sure they hated him
[1:21:09] they hated Jesus
[1:21:11] Jesus preached three and a half years
[1:21:12] and the whole world was against him
[1:21:13] brother Brian Prince 30 years
[1:21:15] 30 years and you know what he tell the
[1:21:18] same story and that might be it might be
[1:21:20] a little different but every bit of it
[1:21:22] was he tell that same story
[1:21:26] he'd stand up there and he'd say if I've
[1:21:28] told you the truth tonight he said let
[1:21:30] God come and back it up
[1:21:33] let God now listen if he was a false
[1:21:36] prophet
[1:21:37] God didn't have to
[1:21:39] God didn't have to back him up
[1:21:41] he could have said no you're not
[1:21:43] preaching my word you're a false prophet
[1:21:46] and he could have been like bail and
[1:21:48] been a flash in the pan and had a little
[1:21:49] bit of a gift and calling whatever but
[1:21:51] 30 years
[1:21:53] Bro think of 30 years this man went on
[1:21:56] the field and preached
[1:21:58] to 20 30 40
[1:22:00] 000 miracles
[1:22:02] documented not just Word of Mouth
[1:22:04] documenting miracles
[1:22:06] and it just kept going until he had to
[1:22:08] come to preach what the Revelation that
[1:22:11] he come to preach and that was the seals
[1:22:13] and that's when they hated him that's
[1:22:15] when that little whippersnapper kid on
[1:22:17] the on the on the uh
[1:22:20] can't remember his name doesn't matter
[1:22:21] oh no YouTube says boy he wasn't a very
[1:22:24] good Bible teacher
[1:22:26] wow we're going
[1:22:28] to use and him not being good Bible
[1:22:29] teacher it's because you know what what
[1:22:31] brother Brown a preached same way with
[1:22:33] Jesus Jesus stood there he said if you
[1:22:35] don't believe I'm here you're dying your
[1:22:36] sins
[1:22:41] I was not born a fornication like you
[1:22:42] was I I I know the Torah I know the
[1:22:47] Moses quote book I got Abraham I got all
[1:22:50] Abraham's tapes well here we go
[1:22:54] I got all Abraham's books
[1:22:56] he said if you to believe Abraham you
[1:22:58] believe me he connected it where they
[1:23:01] couldn't unconnect it he has so much
[1:23:03] influence though with the people when he
[1:23:05] would say that that's what made him mad
[1:23:07] because it turned to people against the
[1:23:09] denomination of the day
[1:23:12] listen he didn't have a problem with
[1:23:13] Sinners and prostitutes
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:18] always there'd be one Pharisee walk in
[1:23:21] and he just tore the whole thing apart
[1:23:23] now that was the religious people of
[1:23:25] today
[1:23:26] that was supposedly the ones that had
[1:23:28] the truth
[1:23:30] supposedly had the truth
[1:23:32] and he said you're of your father the
[1:23:35] devil you're a snake you're a liar
[1:23:44] you know what he was doing
[1:23:46] he's trying to save their soul
[1:23:48] but he knew there was so much in them of
[1:23:51] hatred he couldn't save them
[1:23:53] he couldn't save them
[1:23:55] sure he died for everybody but he knew
[1:23:58] who he was going to get out of that pawn
[1:24:00] shop he knew who would come out
[1:24:02] he knew who wouldn't but he didn't get
[1:24:05] up there and say well bless God I'm not
[1:24:06] dying for them Pharisees no he said Lord
[1:24:09] father forgive him for they don't know
[1:24:11] what they're doing
[1:24:15] do we
[1:24:18] no father burn the house down destroy
[1:24:21] him they're against me make their car
[1:24:23] engine blow up
[1:24:25] that's kind of the way we are
[1:24:27] they don't believe what I preach
[1:24:30] let them be cast out well guess what
[1:24:33] Jesus never was that way so I don't
[1:24:35] think we should be that way
[1:24:38] he died on that cross for everybody but
[1:24:40] he knew being God he knew who wouldn't
[1:24:42] who wouldn't
[1:24:43] who wouldn't accept him so he died
[1:24:46] for me and you
[1:24:47] he died to get us out of that pawn shop
[1:24:51] praise God and then out of that pawn
[1:24:52] shop we still got work to do why would
