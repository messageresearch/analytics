[27:39] sister rachel canada always she would
[27:40] sing that song about the the seven
[27:43] compound names of jehovah and it would
[27:45] be nice if we could get her to do that
[27:46] again oh michael you're too big i can't
[27:49] see you

[27:57] healing not just healing healing and
[28:00] comfort god

[28:08] devil to be uncomfortable
[28:09] but i want god to be comfortable in my
[28:11] house as we were as we were singing so

[29:08] sorry to make keep you standing the
[29:10] heavenly father thank you for this day
[29:11] that you give us
[29:13] we ask you lord that you would just for
[29:15] a little time lord
[29:17] use this vessel lord to speak to your
[29:18] people
[29:20] and father give us revelation more than
[29:21] anything lord because that's what we
[29:23] need that's what we thrive off of lord
[29:26] the things of the world are the things
[29:27] of the world but lord
[29:28] your revelation when you come lord
[29:31] and give us that it is a power
[29:34] that the world will never understand
[29:36] is to get a revelation from the almighty
[29:39] so today i pray that you give us that
[29:40] revelation lord be with the ones that
[29:42] are saved truly lord be jehovah rapha

[29:45] lord you're the healer you're the one
[29:47] that comforts us lord in time of need
[29:50] and father i pray that you would bless
[29:51] us now and take care of the service be
[29:53] with the ones that are sick here and the
[29:54] ones that are at home lord the ones that
[29:56] are traveling thank you lord for giving
[29:58] them all travel and mercies to get to
[29:59] the where they're going and to get back
[30:01] and i pray they should be with us in the
[30:02] furtherment of this service in jesus
[30:04] name we pray
[30:05] amen john 1 1 in the beginning was the
[30:08] word the word was with god and the word
[30:10] was god
[30:11] and the word was made flesh verse 14 and
[30:14] dwelt among us
[30:15] now remember that's not that's not we
[30:18] know that that word was made flesh we
[30:19] know the son of man came on earth but
[30:21] the question is who is this son of man
[30:23] well now he's already gone he's already
[30:25] in another dispensation called the son
[30:27] of god
[30:29] he's not in the son of man dispensation
[30:31] unless we are in the son of man
[30:33] dispensation everybody with me all right
[30:36] so as we come into the son of man
[30:37] dispensation then the word was made
[30:39] flesh where in you
[30:41] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[30:42] among us and we behold his glory the
[30:43] glory the only begotten of the father
[30:45] full of grace and truth you may be
[30:47] seated let's give brother anderson and
[30:49] them a hand clap back in the back look
[30:51] at all this different they're trying to
[30:52] make it where you can see it see it
[30:54] better they're trying to get it to where
[30:56] we can be a little more active with our
[30:59] um
[31:00] in our sermons and our songs and it
[31:02] really
[31:03] it really um thrills my heart to hear
[31:05] you sing even a new song cause usually
[31:07] when we sing a new song it's real quiet
[31:10] because you mumble the words how many of
[31:12] us have mumbled through the verses
[31:15] we mostly know the course but we
[31:17] remember them through the verses well
[31:20] you we need to sing them saying the
[31:22] verses but now we got to where we can so
[31:25] we just appreciate brother dale for
[31:26] allowing us to do that amen and giving
[31:29] us the
[31:30] opportunity and then god give us the
[31:32] opportunity to put every all these
[31:33] brothers together
[31:34] to be able to help and because we sure
[31:37] couldn't do it ourself
[31:38] amen we love all of you with the love of
[31:40] the lord so now let's go to romans 8
[31:42] verse 18 and today we're going to talk
[31:44] i'm going to kind of piggyback on what
[31:46] brother aaron wednesday night
[31:48] that was a good one
[31:50] that was a good one
[31:53] they're all good but you know what you
[31:55] can have a good meal and then you have a
[31:56] great meal
[31:57] it's all food
[31:59] but you can go back and say i want that
[32:01] great meal again
[32:02] well i'm going to kind of piggyback on
[32:03] what he was
[32:05] um bringing wednesday and
[32:07] and i thank god for brother bob for
[32:09] doing that for doing this charter
[32:10] fiction to see here just a minute and
[32:12] kind of break it down for us and
[32:14] and kind of back up just a minute
[32:16] instead of rushing up the statue of
[32:17] perfect man let's kind of back up just a
[32:19] little bit
[32:20] and let's start at the foundation so
[32:22] romans 8 verse 18 says for i reckon that
[32:24] the suffering of this present time are
[32:25] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[32:27] which shall be revealed where
[32:29] in us so whatever is going to happen
[32:32] you're going to have to make it happen
[32:36] and god has predestinated a group that
[32:39] will do that
[32:42] plug yourself in
[32:44] plug yourself into that
[32:46] i like what brother ernie always said he
[32:48] said when you get born again you're
[32:49] plugged into the eternal
[32:52] you know a light doesn't do you any good
[32:54] let's plugged in a refrigerator doesn't
[32:56] do you any gun unless it's plugged in to
[32:58] the right outlet
[33:00] so i believe we're we're the right we're
[33:02] the right instrument and we got the
[33:03] right outlet so let's plug ourselves in
[33:05] today amen
[33:08] for the earnest expectation of the
[33:10] creature creation this whole world is
[33:12] waiting for the manifestation
[33:15] of us
[33:17] let's not say another age or all
[33:19] christendom it's not going to happen
[33:23] not going to happen
[33:25] only the predestinated to adoption is
[33:27] what is going to happen to you
[33:29] man is everybody okay with that
[33:31] all right so let's go to quote number
[33:33] one
[33:34] we've read it before
[33:36] we'll read it again but i like this
[33:37] because look we always talk about faith
[33:40] and we're going to talk about faith
[33:41] today at the bottom of the pyramid
[33:43] we always talk about having more faith
[33:46] how brotherhood how can i have more
[33:47] faith well brother brown said read the
[33:48] bible and pray that's one thing to do
[33:51] but also it tells you real plain right
[33:52] here teaching places a man positionally
[33:55] what he is and we we the bride
[33:59] can never rightly be able to have faith
[34:03] until positionally we know what we are
[34:05] now that's a faith that goes beyond the
[34:08] new birth
[34:10] [Music]
[34:13] have faith and be born again
[34:15] but does that end your journey no it
[34:17] just starts your journey
[34:19] so you've got to have add to your faith
[34:22] faith is the substance of things hoped
[34:23] for
[34:24] what something's pulling us up that
[34:26] statue of a perfect man it's taking us
[34:28] to a place and
[34:30] i told you the other day you know you
[34:32] look at those people over in israel and
[34:34] even the orthodox jew who thinks that
[34:36] god's coming that he's not already here
[34:38] all right they're doing this the whole
[34:40] time
[34:42] why because they say god is moving
[34:44] always and when they're talking to god
[34:46] they want to be moving all right so
[34:48] that's the same way with me and you
[34:50] some of you need to practice this if
[34:51] you'll do this more often you won't
[34:53] sleep in service
[34:56] now you might if you get your head down
[34:57] far enough don't hit the first person in
[34:59] front of you and please don't hit the
[35:01] bench because then we'll be praying for
[35:02] the sick again
[35:04] but just remember though
[35:07] you know what keep your mind working
[35:10] keep your mind working keep your mind
[35:12] working about god i
[35:14] i was watching brother donnie
[35:16] a couple of nights ago and he's
[35:18] preaching on the church and i wanted to
[35:19] kind of listen to what he was talking
[35:20] about
[35:22] he said you know what he said he's
[35:23] talking about his people
[35:26] he's you know what he said you
[35:27] grandparents he said you'll take your
[35:28] grandkids to a ball game
[35:31] and make them play
[35:33] they don't want to be there
[35:34] they don't even want they standing out
[35:37] there and it's supposed to be batting
[35:38] left-handed they're right-handed they
[35:39] got a glove instead of a bat
[35:42] but you're out there going white come on
[35:44] man
[35:44] come on let's go
[35:47] and he gets up there and and you know
[35:49] johnny finally does get the bat right
[35:51] hand and he hits it and it goes two feet
[35:54] and he said now johnny doesn't look over
[35:56] at grandparents and they're going
[36:03] they're going whoa johnny go go johnny
[36:06] go
[36:07] he said that's what we ought to be doing
[36:09] doesn't matter if you hit the ball that
[36:11] far doesn't matter the preacher don't
[36:12] even hit the ball
[36:14] you ought to be alive
[36:16] you ought to be able to say sick them
[36:18] a good amen
[36:21] amen means so be it
[36:23] you know what you're doing when you say
[36:24] so be it it's according to you it's it's
[36:26] going back to you
[36:28] if we talk about healing you say amen
[36:30] then you know what it's coming back to
[36:31] you
[36:34] i don't know if you ever thought about
[36:35] that or not but you know it's a two-way
[36:36] street you know
[36:38] but let's get into he let's go to
[36:40] hebrews 6. we're all in hebrews brother
[36:43] bob and
[36:44] myself
[36:46] and
[36:47] i i really i love the book of hebrews so
[36:49] let's read hebrews 6 verse 1. therefore
[36:51] leaving the principles now so that's
[36:53] what we're gonna we're gonna talk about
[36:54] coming today is moving therefore leaving
[36:57] the principles of the doctrine of christ
[36:58] let us go on into what perfection we're
[37:01] gonna see what that means because a lot
[37:03] of times
[37:04] we look at perfection and we think can't
[37:07] get there
[37:09] i got all this i got all that
[37:11] i got this baggage
[37:13] remember i told you put it in the seat
[37:15] of god's forgetfulness and quit fishing
[37:18] quit trying to fish it back up
[37:20] but we're going on to perfection which
[37:22] is completion and we'll read what the
[37:23] greek lexicon
[37:25] is going to say about perfection so
[37:27] let's not look at perfection as what you
[37:29] think perfection has been
[37:32] all your life
[37:33] the bible says be there for perfect we
[37:35] know that's complete but only in the
[37:37] bride in the end time can we be complete
[37:40] amen
[37:43] they are waiting on us
[37:45] they without us can't be made perfection
[37:49] but without us
[37:51] they're not but with us
[37:54] they can be perfect
[37:56] so it says let us go on into perfection
[37:58] not laying again the foundation of
[38:00] repentance from dead works and of faith
[38:02] toward god of the doctrine of baptism a
[38:04] laying on of hands resurrection of the
[38:06] dead and of eternal judgment and this we
[38:08] will do if god permits
[38:11] all right with this we will do if god
[38:13] permits so let's go to first corinthians
[38:15] 13 verse 9
[38:17] just kind of lay a foundation for this
[38:19] for we know in part
[38:21] and we prophesy in part
[38:23] but when that which is perfect
[38:26] perfect perfection same thing perfect
[38:28] it's come
[38:31] now we know jesus christ is the only
[38:32] perfect one
[38:34] but remember he had problems
[38:37] bob just read them
[38:39] bob just read the problems that he had
[38:41] he was tempted he was tried all these
[38:43] different things listen
[38:45] and we're going to talk about this a
[38:46] little later but i want you to see two
[38:47] words fall and fail
[38:50] they're not the same word
[38:53] by you getting up this morning and
[38:55] needing to eat and having the thoughts
[38:57] in your mind you have failed
[39:03] ah
[39:05] that amen is not coming from anywhere
[39:12] we all fail we fail god
[39:16] by having to eat
[39:19] to sustain our energy
[39:21] because it wasn't so in the garden
[39:25] we're gonna have to get up and go to
[39:26] work you know you know what you're not
[39:27] going to have to think about thoughts
[39:29] that we think of carnality during the
[39:31] week
[39:32] that's where we fail
[39:35] but i'm going to read you a scripture
[39:36] here maybe it'll be this afternoon where
[39:38] peter says if you get these virtues
[39:39] working in your life you'll never fall
[39:43] you can't fall if you're born again if
[39:46] you're born again you there is no way
[39:48] you can go past that what we're going to
[39:50] talk about today backwards
[39:53] you can fail
[39:54] but you can't fall
[39:56] amen we fail all the time so you say
[39:58] well brother what are you now you're
[39:59] talking about us failing and you're
[40:00] talking about us being perfect let's
[40:02] just hang on a minute
[40:04] but what the when that which is perfect
[40:05] has come then that which is in part
[40:07] shall be done away now look not done
[40:09] away like we don't need that anymore
[40:11] that's your foundation that we're
[40:12] building on
[40:13] all right
[40:14] when i was a child i speak as a child i
[40:17] understood as a child i thought as a
[40:18] child but when i became a man hello
[40:20] somebody we have got to become men in
[40:23] god you can be an 18 year old man in god
[40:26] you can be a 15 year old man in god if
[40:28] you got the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:30] all right so man is not just age it's
[40:33] maturity
[40:35] i put away childish things hello i put
[40:37] away
[40:38] childish things
[40:41] and don't pick them back up
[40:44] all right the greek lexicon let's go to
[40:46] the next one now those two words mean of
[40:48] full age
[40:49] look
[40:50] brought to its end
[40:54] that's why the bible says they without
[40:57] us
[40:58] cannot be brought to
[41:01] an end
[41:02] he saw brother the end that's death
[41:04] death at the end what brother brown said
[41:05] the seventh seal was
[41:08] the end of all things
[41:12] not an end like falling off and here's
[41:14] the end of the cliff no it's just the
[41:15] beginning of something else
[41:18] it's bringing us to completion of
[41:20] perfection and we add this and we add
[41:22] that and we add virtual knowledge
[41:24] temperance we'll get to that in a little
[41:25] bit we got to stay down keep me down at
[41:27] the foundation here brought to its end
[41:30] finished
[41:31] wanting nothing necessary to
[41:33] completeness now you and i
[41:35] are in that position today
[41:38] you are not wanting for anything to
[41:41] complete your birth or to complete your
[41:45] journey in life
[41:47] you've been given the word of god you've
[41:49] been given the divine interpretation of
[41:51] the word of god the correct
[41:52] interpretation by the prophet of the
[41:53] hour and you've been given a five-fold
[41:56] ministry that
[41:57] knows what they're doing
[41:59] you gotta decide whether you're in the
[42:01] right place or not
[42:02] wanting nothing necessary to
[42:04] completeness perfect that which is
[42:07] perfect consummate human integrity and
[42:10] what
[42:11] virtue
[42:12] of men full grown adult of full age and
[42:16] mature so let's go to the next one i
[42:18] like this next one this is
[42:20] what perfection means go to the next
[42:23] greek lexicon let's go up there we go
[42:25] finisher
[42:29] it doesn't say perfect it says a
[42:30] perfecter
[42:33] someone that's going to perfect you
[42:36] you can't perfect yourself
[42:38] but when you come to this completeness
[42:40] of this fullness then you have a
[42:42] perfecter you have the holy ghost that
[42:43] comes inside of you and molds you
[42:47] vulcanizes so much you can't pull it
[42:49] apart and he's sitting there waiting on
[42:51] what your faith
[42:54] one who has in his own person
[42:57] raised faith to its perfection
[43:00] and so sent before us the highest
[43:02] example of faith listen the highest
[43:04] example of faith is when we take a body
[43:06] change
[43:08] that's the highest example of faith
[43:10] and the ones that are going to take a
[43:12] body change without death that's what
[43:14] we're looking at and that's what we need
[43:15] to be but
[43:17] everybody's not going to get there
[43:19] but get the new birth
[43:21] get the new birth that's your journey
[43:23] that's what that like i said before you
[43:25] it doesn't matter
[43:26] it does matter about these virtues but
[43:28] if you if you become a christian and god
[43:30] wants to work with you and and you just
[43:32] really you know got the wildly well as
[43:33] you would and i can't do this and i
[43:35] can't do that then you know what god's
[43:37] gonna say okay well that's fine
[43:38] he's a high priest of what your
[43:40] confession
[43:42] he goes off what you confess
[43:45] regardless it doesn't matter if you're
[43:47] having the worst day of your life
[43:49] confess
[43:51] that god is inside your soul
[43:55] and listen
[43:57] we'll get to in just a second but once
[43:58] you realize something
[44:00] to come to perfection like i said before
[44:03] we can fail but we can't fall once you
[44:06] get born again you can't fall like
[44:08] hebrew says fall away those people that
[44:10] fall away never got the new birth
[44:12] okay but but but let's go back on our
[44:15] side if you are sealed in
[44:18] then the confirmation that you got the
[44:20] new birth is you can look through your
[44:21] life and see virtue knowledge temper
[44:23] space of the godliness working in your
[44:25] life
[44:27] testimonies
[44:31] life
[44:32] where god does something in your life
[44:36] because you're his child
[44:38] and he's always going to help his child
[44:41] more than he helps the world
[44:44] so let's go to ephesians 4 11. we've
[44:45] read this many times before
[44:48] but we're going to read it again
[44:50] and he gave some apostles and some
[44:52] prophets and some evangelists and some
[44:53] pastors and teachers
[44:56] for the perfecting are the bringing
[44:59] us to an end
[45:06] like i said before when i said a minute
[45:08] ago
[45:09] your end you thought death
[45:13] no
[45:15] you can't end the christian's life
[45:18] there's no way you can end the
[45:19] christian's life no more than you can in
[45:21] god's life
[45:23] sure he had a human body that had an end
[45:25] it died
[45:27] but guess what that same body sitting on
[45:29] the throne today
[45:30] interceding for us
[45:32] amen
[45:34] so ephesians 4 is for the perfecting of
[45:36] the saints
[45:37] for the work of the ministry for the
[45:38] edifying of the body of christ
[45:41] i don't see how in the world people
[45:43] think they can get edified any other way
[45:45] if i hurt your feelings i'm sorry but
[45:47] press and play is okay
[45:48] but it ain't gonna get you
[45:50] much full maturity
[45:52] four maturities gotta come through a
[45:54] five-fold ministry i didn't say it the
[45:55] bible did
[45:56] all right find the bible don't fight
[45:58] people listen we're not finding people
[46:00] find the bible if you want to fight
[46:01] somebody give it to the bible say here
[46:03] read this
[46:04] what do you say see law it's in the
[46:06] bible
[46:09] unto the measure
[46:11] until we all come into the unity of
[46:12] faith wow unity
[46:15] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[46:16] that's not knowledge
[46:18] human knowledge
[46:20] we'll talk about that when we get into
[46:21] the virtues a little bit later unto a
[46:23] perfect man there's that word again unto
[46:25] the measure of the stature stature not
[46:27] statue
[46:31] that's a statue god doesn't want a
[46:32] statue
[46:33] he won't stature height development
[46:35] growth he wants you to grow up
[46:38] that we henceforth be no more children
[46:41] now this is paul and and peter all these
[46:44] different ones are trying to say look
[46:46] you need to be more mature you need more
[46:48] we all need to be more mature
[46:50] now if he's saying that back in the
[46:51] first church age what about the seventh
[46:53] church age when we are what
[46:54] predestinated unto adoption
[46:57] and you've got to come to this before
[46:59] you can come to adoption you got to come
[47:01] to a stature or growth development we'll
[47:04] talk about that in a minute
[47:06] that we henceforth be no more children
[47:08] toss to and fro i'll read a quote here
[47:09] in just a minute brother brian says you
[47:11] know you got you need to quit
[47:12] stop going from church to church running
[47:14] around
[47:16] find you a good place and stay there
[47:20] i'm not telling you that brother brown
[47:21] told you that
[47:23] because you can't be settled
[47:26] we can't be wandering stars
[47:29] wondering whether this is right and
[47:30] wondering whether that's right
[47:32] and carried about with every wind of
[47:33] doctrine there we go again every wind of
[47:35] doctrine
[47:38] like brother aaron was talking about man
[47:40] i'm telling you
[47:41] i like that where the bible says
[47:43] considering the end of your conversation
[47:46] amen
[47:48] like i said before there was
[47:51] there was a preacher years and years ago
[47:53] that preached a memorial service or yeah
[47:55] memorial day service for brother homer
[47:57] and he preached the best sermon on the
[47:59] millennium i have heard in my life
[48:01] until today until you know till now
[48:04] things that he brought out and the
[48:06] little intricacies and the little things
[48:07] that he brought out
[48:10] two months later
[48:11] he was put in jail
[48:13] for sleeping with a 14 year old girl
[48:18] and now i think he's back preaching
[48:20] again
[48:23] that ain't failing that's fallen
[48:26] okay we all fail
[48:28] but you see what i'm saying when you get
[48:30] the anointing on somebody it's the true
[48:31] anointing of god and he can preach his
[48:33] heart out
[48:34] and be an anointed one
[48:40] but to put the word together and just
[48:41] keep going it's like brother brown said
[48:43] he wants time-tested christians he wants
[48:45] somebody that the time has tested us
[48:48] listen
[48:48] you and i
[48:50] look way different than we did 20 years
[48:51] ago
[48:52] because time has tested us
[48:55] we have we have things that are used to
[48:58] not be there and things in places that
[49:00] never used to be amen
[49:03] but that's time-tested humans now what
[49:05] about time-tested christians
[49:07] you need to be not babies anymore we
[49:10] need to grow up
[49:11] that's right
[49:13] but look
[49:14] what they do though they slide of men in
[49:16] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[49:19] wait to deceive
[49:22] but speaking the truth in love what may
[49:24] grow up into him in all things
[49:27] which is the head even christ and he's
[49:29] the church he's the head of the church
[49:30] right he's building his body he is the
[49:32] head he doesn't need a head that's right
[49:34] he is the head
[49:36] he is the husband he is not looking for
[49:38] another groom he knows who he wants
[49:40] all right i mean another bride he is the
[49:42] groom and you're the bride that's it
[49:44] there's no you know as brother brown
[49:46] said many times there's been bribes
[49:48] brides churches brides but he had to put
[49:49] them all away
[49:52] he had to put him all away until he got
[49:54] the right one and he we are the right
[49:55] one because we are the ones called to
[49:58] perfection amen from whom the whole body
[50:01] fitly joined together and compacted i
[50:03] like that word compacted
[50:05] it's not just loosely fit
[50:07] it's compacted because on that statue of
[50:09] perfect man when you see this holy
[50:10] spirit right here we'll see it on turtle
[50:12] you see this right here that's not
[50:14] getting the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:16] we know that
[50:17] but that is sealing or compacting all
[50:20] these inside of you
[50:22] and then he's able to use you by
[50:25] adoption he's be he's able to watch say
[50:27] here here's the keys
[50:29] here his here's my word
[50:32] you speak it and i'll back it up
[50:35] then the word goes to speaking
[50:37] everybody all right
[50:38] according to the effectual working if
[50:41] effectual
[50:43] we got to work
[50:44] all right
[50:45] in the measure of every part make us
[50:48] increase of the body into the edifying
[50:50] of itself
[50:51] and what's that very top one up there it
[50:53] is
[50:54] love
[50:56] that is love
[50:57] the stature of the fullness of christ
[51:00] but you gotta you gotta start somewhere
[51:02] let's look at the greek lexicon on the
[51:04] next one excuse me
[51:06] and let's see what that means stature of
[51:08] the fullness of christ that's age adult
[51:11] age maturity look suitable age for
[51:14] anything
[51:16] it didn't say just certain things
[51:18] suitable aids for anything
[51:21] metaphorically of an attained state fit
[51:23] for a thing in other words you're going
[51:25] to attain a certain thing
[51:28] you're going to attain to virtue
[51:30] knowledge temperance patience that's
[51:31] what our god has given us
[51:35] uh it's kind of strange how brother
[51:36] branham preached
[51:37] the god
[51:38] the night he preached that you're a
[51:40] perfect man in the daytime
[51:42] because we needed that guide
[51:44] i don't i don't see how in the world
[51:46] that that people think that we have to
[51:48] go all the way up here to get the holy
[51:49] ghost i'll prove it in just a few
[51:50] minutes there's no way for you to know
[51:52] who these what these virtues are unless
[51:54] you've got the holy ghost the bible says
[51:56] you can't even call jesus to christ
[51:57] without having the holy ghost so i don't
[51:58] know how in the world if you can't call
[52:00] jesus to christ which these are all his
[52:02] attributes how in the world are we going
[52:04] to be able to do that
[52:05] no you get the car before the horse
[52:08] hey man cow eating grass in the top of
[52:10] the tree
[52:10] you got the cow right you got the grass
[52:12] right but he's in the wrong place
[52:14] amen
[52:16] so let's watch what we're doing all
[52:17] right so let's pull that chart the first
[52:19] chart is going to be everything this is
[52:20] the one that bob did that he pulled up
[52:22] this morning we're going to pull it up
[52:24] and just kind of give an overview and
[52:26] then we're going to break it apart all
[52:27] right so they'll get it look watch how
[52:29] they fade that out and watch that feeder
[52:30] up again
[52:36] there we go
[52:39] but now this is the chart brother brown
[52:41] and drew faith versus knowledge
[52:42] temperatures godless brother kindness
[52:44] and the capstone is love and then we
[52:46] just broke this apart
[52:48] as bob did and then i'm just stealing it
[52:50] from him
[52:51] so then he did something else for me
[52:53] because look as we see this this is this
[52:56] is the this is to me if you look at this
[52:58] chart you will see a body change you
[53:01] will see the son of man being walking
[53:03] and breathing and talking again in human
[53:05] beings
[53:06] the headstone has come the seals has
[53:08] been opened to you we know they're open
[53:11] in 63 but they got to open to you
[53:13] individually to see the plan of
[53:16] redemption the full plan not just this
[53:18] plan here
[53:20] right
[53:20] not just this plan here
[53:23] but we are supposed to come to the
[53:24] headstone that is our mandate for today
[53:28] is to let god
[53:30] be preeminent in our life
[53:32] and in our flesh
[53:34] amen he's preeminent in our soul down
[53:37] here
[53:38] everybody with me say amen
[53:40] he's preeminent in our soul old nature's
[53:42] gone we'll talk about in just a second
[53:44] but then we got a what look at this
[53:46] little baby right here
[53:47] see the little shadow you're a little
[53:49] baby
[53:50] but then you got to grow up more then
[53:52] grow up more
[53:54] i mean man look at your own life
[53:57] your own life proves that there's a
[53:59] statue of a perfect man
[54:00] brother branham just brought everything
[54:02] together to show us exactly what was
[54:04] going on and then we got we're listen
[54:06] you're not a son and daughter of god
[54:08] until you're born again
[54:10] everybody all right with that
[54:12] you're not can y'all see that
[54:15] i'll step over here
[54:17] you can't be
[54:18] a son and daughter of god until you're
[54:19] born again but once you get born again
[54:21] you are son and daughter of god
[54:23] we'll read it in just a minute
[54:25] in in romans but then you are a son of
[54:27] god well now that son of god is what
[54:30] that's as we were typing through the
[54:31] church ages and the different things we
[54:33] see this ministry coming up and it's
[54:35] coming up to what is more narrow more
[54:37] narrow more narrow
[54:39] until it comes to the holy spirit that
[54:41] wells everything together and then god
[54:45] according to luke 17 30 revelations 10 7
[54:49] the different ones
[54:50] that son of man's got to come back
[54:53] and it's not that person
[54:55] in his flesh
[54:56] it's his person in your flesh
[54:59] amen because his body can't be on earth
[55:01] and him have a bride on earth at the
[55:02] same time he'd have two he'd have two
[55:05] brides two bodies can't have two bodies
[55:08] but he told us in john saint john 17 he
[55:10] said lord i pray that they be one that
[55:12] like we are one
[55:17] so when his hand moved god's hand moved
[55:20] when your hand moves god hands move
[55:23] oh brother wait that don't see we'll go
[55:25] back again
[55:26] there's the failures
[55:28] but i believe the one inside of me is
[55:30] perfect
[55:32] and when he tells me to move that hand
[55:35] it's perfection
[55:38] sometimes you can't swallow that but you
[55:40] better start learning how to eat
[55:42] so you can't swallow
[55:44] hey man let that mother eagle chew it up
[55:46] a little bit and and come on wednesday
[55:48] and come on sunday and come on sunday
[55:50] again and and come on bible study and
[55:53] you just keep eating and guess what's
[55:54] gonna happen
[55:56] you're gonna get fed amen
[55:59] all right so look so may grow up in all
[56:01] things adult full age maturity suitable
[56:04] age for anything
[56:06] so now let's look at first corinthians
[56:09] take that back off
[56:10] and we'll put the other chart up in just
[56:11] a second so let's go to first
[56:13] corinthians 14 verse 19. i love
[56:16] scripture i haven't i usually read a lot
[56:18] of quotes i haven't read many quotes i
[56:20] just read scripture because listen
[56:21] scripture
[56:22] if you look at scripture we see the
[56:24] divine interpretation the brother brown
[56:26] gives us the divine interpretation of
[56:27] the scripture right
[56:28] but now remember then he goes off the
[56:30] scene and that in the divine interpreter
[56:33] or perfecter
[56:34] is now in you
[56:37] it's not one man standing behind the
[56:38] pulpit that has the perfect word of god
[56:42] he's gone done his job and gone off the
[56:44] scene now he's in a five-fold ministry
[56:46] the professor is now speaking through a
[56:49] five-fold ministry that should be more
[56:51] mature than they were ten years ago two
[56:53] years ago or six months ago
[56:56] all right now look
[56:58] yet in the church i'd rather speak five
[57:00] words
[57:02] like brother bob was talking about i you
[57:03] know
[57:05] i ain't gonna say it never mind
[57:07] it's just become a dance show now
[57:10] bob knows what i'm doing it's become a
[57:12] dance show go online and look at some of
[57:14] these places some of these camps and
[57:16] stuff it's become a dance show i'm sorry
[57:20] pretending to dance to god is wrong
[57:23] dancing in the spirit is a whole
[57:25] different thing
[57:26] amen and you can tell the difference
[57:29] someone told me a long time ago he said
[57:31] he said you know i remember when my mama
[57:33] and my daddy used to he's out he's not
[57:35] he's out in the world he's a deer
[57:36] hunting friend of mine he said my mom
[57:38] and daddy used to run the benches and
[57:39] said one time mama fell and broke her
[57:41] leg
[57:43] i said well
[57:44] you know me
[57:46] i said well that wasn't god
[57:48] that was your mama
[57:50] that's right
[57:52] because god ain't gonna let that happen
[57:53] if it's god
[57:54] and man you walk on coals of fire but
[57:56] let me tell you something you better be
[57:58] careful make sure it's god
[58:01] just say it
[58:03] yet in the church i'd rather speak five
[58:05] words with my understanding amen this is
[58:09] paul
[58:09] that by my voice i might teach others
[58:12] also than ten thousand words in an
[58:15] unknown language
[58:17] not just ten words paul not just a
[58:20] thousand ten thousand words in an
[58:23] unknown language let me speak
[58:26] five words of understanding
[58:29] brethren be not children in
[58:31] understanding
[58:33] how being in malice be your children but
[58:35] in understanding be men
[58:38] wow
[58:39] and the law it is written with men of
[58:41] other tongues and other lips while i
[58:43] speak into his people and yet for all
[58:45] that will they not hear me you hear what
[58:48] that is and the law it's written with
[58:50] men of other tongues and other lips well
[58:52] i speaking to the people he says okay
[58:54] but hang on a minute
[58:56] and yet all
[58:57] that will not hear me they're not going
[58:59] to all hear me they're just going to all
[59:00] start shouting and speaking in tongues
[59:03] wherefore tongues are for a sign look
[59:06] not to them that believe
[59:10] i'm sorry i'm reading the bible
[59:12] everybody believe the bible's right
[59:14] okay all right just want to make sure we
[59:15] had a good congregation here today
[59:18] what brother brown say i'm in the right
[59:20] one now there's believers here
[59:23] wherefore tongues are for a sign not to
[59:26] them that believe
[59:28] but to them that believe not
[59:32] but prophecy
[59:36] prophecy
[59:38] service not for them that believe not
[59:40] but for them which believe
[59:43] today we're hearing prophecy
[59:46] and prophecy is being made manifest
[59:50] paul is prophesying of a group of people
[59:52] to come
[59:53] we're the people
[59:56] peter prophesying of add to your faith
[59:59] you'll never fall if you do these things
[1:00:01] but he the lack of these things is blind
[1:00:04] and can't see it far off in other words
[1:00:06] can't see revelation
[1:00:08] everybody with me today
[1:00:10] now let's go to quote number two and
[1:00:12] it'll tie every business together now
[1:00:13] remember i said look prophesying
[1:00:14] servants not for them that believeth not
[1:00:16] but for them which believe the
[1:00:18] revelation of jesus christ in the church
[1:00:20] age book we still believe in that book
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] you'll recall that i mentioned at the
[1:00:25] beginning of this message that this book
[1:00:27] we are studying is the actual revelation
[1:00:29] of jesus himself in the church and his
[1:00:31] work in the future ages
[1:00:34] that's here
[1:00:36] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:00:38] spirit
[1:00:42] the holy spirit
[1:00:43] not the one up there
[1:00:45] down here that to begin with then it
[1:00:47] takes you up to there
[1:00:49] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:00:50] spirit to give us revelation or we will
[1:00:53] what fail to get it everybody with me
[1:00:57] now listen
[1:00:58] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:01:00] will see that it won't take just
[1:01:02] ordinary study
[1:01:04] right god's son of prophet
[1:01:08] believe one lord jesus christ and thou
[1:01:09] shalt be saved
[1:01:12] paul said leaving the principles of the
[1:01:13] doctrine of christ let us go into
[1:01:14] perfection bringing these two thoughts
[1:01:16] together you will see that it won't take
[1:01:17] just ordinary study and thinking
[1:01:21] to make this book real
[1:01:24] it is going to take the operation of the
[1:01:26] holy ghost come on everybody do this
[1:01:28] because some of y'all falling asleep
[1:01:29] give me right
[1:01:31] put your hands together
[1:01:32] do this
[1:01:34] you're not doing it to me you're doing
[1:01:35] it to god you need to say god keep me
[1:01:37] awake
[1:01:41] it will require supernatural
[1:01:44] instruction
[1:01:48] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:01:51] verse i like that's like me that's like
[1:01:53] me and albert einstein
[1:01:55] okie dokie
[1:01:57] me trying to explain
[1:01:59] the theory of relativity to him
[1:02:04] i believe you missed it my son
[1:02:08] so it's not a student comparing verse
[1:02:10] with verse though that is good
[1:02:12] though that's okay
[1:02:15] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:02:17] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[1:02:22] can't see
[1:02:25] blind
[1:02:26] it never becomes clear
[1:02:29] let's read number three
[1:02:31] is this a sign of the answer
[1:02:33] um get ready to pull that chart up
[1:02:35] brother the first one i mean the second
[1:02:37] one
[1:02:38] the mysteries here is the mystery i read
[1:02:39] this last weekend a mystery is scripture
[1:02:42] all right
[1:02:44] hello a mystery of scripture
[1:02:47] scripture is written with different
[1:02:48] layers to it
[1:02:50] everybody with me
[1:02:51] brother brown says compound meaning dual
[1:02:53] meaning
[1:02:54] okay
[1:02:56] a mystery of scripture is a previously
[1:02:58] hidden truth
[1:03:00] now
[1:03:01] divinely revealed
[1:03:04] but
[1:03:04] which a supernatural element still
[1:03:06] remains despite the revelation
[1:03:09] all right here's what we're going to do
[1:03:10] you see this right here we see that all
[1:03:12] even even all of christendom from paul's
[1:03:16] age of peter's age and all down all the
[1:03:18] way up to where i'm standing today
[1:03:21] the bible says believe on the lord jesus
[1:03:22] christ and thou shalt be saved he tells
[1:03:25] nicodemus he said ye must be born again
[1:03:27] that's not god away from that
[1:03:30] it's not got away from that
[1:03:33] but
[1:03:34] man has put his own interpretation to it
[1:03:38] and got away from it
[1:03:40] god didn't get away from it
[1:03:42] but see they believe on the lord jesus
[1:03:44] christ as a second person
[1:03:49] i'm going to take this water baptism in
[1:03:51] matthew versus the one in acts because
[1:03:53] this is what jesus said i thought he
[1:03:55] wrote the whole thing
[1:03:57] right i thought he wrote all of it is he
[1:04:00] that confused
[1:04:01] he's really confused because you know
[1:04:02] what he's done on top of that he gave
[1:04:04] the man that said that in the book of
[1:04:06] acts the king of the kingdom
[1:04:10] peter
[1:04:11] no no no don't say that no when it
[1:04:13] clicked on earth it had to click in
[1:04:15] heaven
[1:04:16] but man's theology their knowledge not
[1:04:19] the knowledge of the of that knowledge
[1:04:22] but the knowledge of man has interpreted
[1:04:24] and and deluded the word of god
[1:04:28] down through the church ages even good
[1:04:29] people
[1:04:31] you know luther was a trinitarian but
[1:04:32] god's never been a trinitarian
[1:04:35] the holy ghost has never been see that
[1:04:36] to me is a paradox
[1:04:39] the holy ghost has never been a
[1:04:40] trinitarian
[1:04:42] but he was inside of luther and luther
[1:04:44] was a trinitarian
[1:04:46] because you know what man's thoughts got
[1:04:48] involved
[1:04:49] memory reason conscious affection
[1:04:51] imagination
[1:04:52] and it wasn't time for him to get it
[1:04:55] he saw what he could see and that was it
[1:04:57] all right everybody with me
[1:05:00] remember let's be not children let's say
[1:05:02] we listen even brother brown some in
[1:05:04] another quote he says we are prophetic
[1:05:06] people
[1:05:07] with prophetic insight
[1:05:09] this prophetic insight has done what it
[1:05:12] has opened this new world to know
[1:05:14] there's a dispensation of the son of god
[1:05:17] as dispensation of the son of man a
[1:05:19] dispensation of the son of david and
[1:05:20] thank god he sent a prophet
[1:05:23] everybody believed god sent a prophet
[1:05:25] okay that was kind of weak but that's
[1:05:27] okay
[1:05:28] we'll get through them
[1:05:31] but there's a supernatural element
[1:05:34] besides the revelation listen
[1:05:36] when god revealed itself to you to get
[1:05:38] the new birth this is to get the new
[1:05:40] birth all right
[1:05:41] when he come to you and said be my child
[1:05:45] all right that's a layer
[1:05:48] that's god fulfilling this promise
[1:05:51] acts 2 38
[1:05:52] all right
[1:05:53] you go be baptized the name of jesus
[1:05:55] christ for remission and sins and you
[1:05:56] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:05:58] and you can receive the holy ghost
[1:06:00] without being baptized
[1:06:02] but you won't receive the holy ghost and
[1:06:04] not be baptized
[1:06:07] the correct way
[1:06:08] in this end time all right that make it
[1:06:10] that right
[1:06:11] all right okay
[1:06:13] but the supernatural element is is that
[1:06:16] i mean you know and and i hate it in
[1:06:19] most
[1:06:21] realms
[1:06:22] when you say perfection
[1:06:25] talk to somebody
[1:06:28] really nail it down to even just a good
[1:06:30] baptist or a good pentecostal
[1:06:33] say god told us to be perfect
[1:06:37] he told us to be perfect be there for
[1:06:39] perfect
[1:06:40] first thing out of their mouth you ain't
[1:06:42] perfect now ain't perfect
[1:06:44] you got problems and i got problems you
[1:06:46] got this and you got that you got this
[1:06:48] the problem is
[1:06:49] hearing hearing lies the problem is like
[1:06:52] brother brown said in marriage and
[1:06:53] divorce it's misinterpreted theology
[1:06:58] because the baptist is like one saved
[1:07:00] always saved so if you ever get saved
[1:07:01] one time it doesn't matter what you do
[1:07:02] afterwards
[1:07:04] pentecostal said oh just come on make
[1:07:05] sure you make sure you
[1:07:07] remember speak in tongues you got the
[1:07:08] holy ghost now
[1:07:10] how many wives you got
[1:07:13] will you talk to you at the liquor store
[1:07:19] you understand what i'm saying
[1:07:20] i'm saying not talk to you but talk to
[1:07:22] people
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:26] but the supernatural element is to me
[1:07:28] and you
[1:07:29] because we're prophetic people
[1:07:33] the seals have been open
[1:07:35] and we have been required not to just
[1:07:37] see them but to walk in them
[1:07:39] we've been required to be them we we
[1:07:41] we're required to not just read the word
[1:07:43] but be the word
[1:07:45] that is our requirement our mandate is
[1:07:47] to be prophetic people
[1:07:50] knowing that god listen even
[1:07:52] even if you suppress the holy ghost all
[1:07:55] right and you can because remember you
[1:07:57] can grieve him
[1:07:59] he's still sitting there going if you'll
[1:08:02] open that door i'll walk through it
[1:08:05] the doorknob's on your side buddy
[1:08:09] the doorknob's on your side i can't do
[1:08:11] nothing but knock
[1:08:13] i can't do anything but take a five-fold
[1:08:15] ministry and knock at your door
[1:08:18] please let me in but you know what he's
[1:08:20] not gonna do he's not gonna knock that
[1:08:21] door
[1:08:22] down he's a timid god
[1:08:27] he's a good god
[1:08:28] but he's just
[1:08:31] you don't get in on your goodness i
[1:08:32] promise you that
[1:08:35] all right let's go to the chart number
[1:08:36] two this is how we're gonna break it
[1:08:39] apart brother bob helped me with this or
[1:08:40] he didn't help me he actually did it
[1:08:43] so
[1:08:44] now if you can't see that
[1:08:46] come on up toward the front
[1:08:49] some of us that are a little bit older
[1:08:52] yeah i see that
[1:08:57] but this just begins your journey
[1:08:59] piggybacking off of what brother aaron
[1:09:01] was talking about this begins your
[1:09:02] journey
[1:09:04] you cannot have a journey with god
[1:09:06] without being justified sanctified and
[1:09:09] filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:11] no way
[1:09:13] because you are born in sin shaping an
[1:09:14] iniquity you are contrary to god just
[1:09:17] like i said before listen you were born
[1:09:19] contrary to god
[1:09:24] so i don't know what all this you know
[1:09:27] we were this great something listen we
[1:09:28] were great in god's mind
[1:09:32] but when god's mind listen god's mind
[1:09:34] got sealed
[1:09:36] when adam and eve couldn't produce a son
[1:09:39] or daughter of god god sealed that up in
[1:09:41] his mind and said i'm going to bring
[1:09:43] them but i got to bring them a different
[1:09:44] way
[1:09:46] to be a healer to be a savior to be a
[1:09:48] redeemer i've got to let him make a
[1:09:50] choice
[1:09:51] and he knew their choice would be to get
[1:09:53] lost
[1:09:55] and the womb of her mind and then her
[1:09:58] body was so polluted he could not use it
[1:10:01] anymore
[1:10:02] everybody with me
[1:10:04] to me that's a simple plan of redemption
[1:10:07] but we were always in the mind of god
[1:10:10] waiting for our time to come through sex
[1:10:13] through brother brown said take this one
[1:10:15] and breathe to this one and bring this
[1:10:16] one how'd y'all get here
[1:10:20] it's a mystery
[1:10:22] how you got here i'm talking about here
[1:10:23] in this building
[1:10:25] it's a mystery
[1:10:26] boy
[1:10:28] it's a mystery
[1:10:29] had to come through some things
[1:10:31] had to come a little different way
[1:10:34] but it's a testimony
[1:10:36] it's a life that brings you what right
[1:10:38] here
[1:10:40] to a foundation of faith
[1:10:44] believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:10:47] and thou shalt be
[1:10:49] saved let's read this one more i kind of
[1:10:50] got a little ahead of myself
[1:10:53] so let's go to
[1:10:54] ephesians 1 verse 10 but leave that up
[1:10:56] there and put it up over here if you
[1:10:58] don't mind
[1:10:59] man we got all kind of cameras and stuff
[1:11:01] going on around here that's good
[1:11:03] yeah i'll put the scripture up over
[1:11:04] there and leave that over there
[1:11:06] because we got to go through
[1:11:07] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:11:09] holy ghost before god will start even
[1:11:12] using you
[1:11:14] everybody with me
[1:11:16] now
[1:11:17] now sanctification is is cleaned and set
[1:11:19] aside for service but the prophet of god
[1:11:21] said not in service
[1:11:23] he can't trust you with the keys to the
[1:11:25] car
[1:11:26] everybody with me
[1:11:29] all right
[1:11:30] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:11:32] of times he might gather together in one
[1:11:34] all things in christ both which are in
[1:11:36] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:11:37] him and him also we have obtained an
[1:11:40] inheritance all right what's your
[1:11:41] inheritance eternal life
[1:11:44] all right let's just stay let's just
[1:11:45] stay you all know my hold on stay down
[1:11:48] here
[1:11:51] your inheritance is eternal life
[1:11:53] your inheritance is not what you get
[1:11:54] from your mom and dad down here your
[1:11:56] inheritance is what you get from your
[1:11:57] father in heaven
[1:11:58] it's an eternal inheritance it's one
[1:12:00] that won't go away everybody with me
[1:12:03] being predestinated according to the
[1:12:05] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:12:07] after the counsel of his own will that
[1:12:09] we should be to the praise of his glory
[1:12:11] who first trusted in christ
[1:12:14] in whom you also trusted look after
[1:12:20] after
[1:12:22] not after up here
[1:12:26] after right here
[1:12:29] after you heard the word of truth
[1:12:31] the gospel of what
[1:12:33] your salvation
[1:12:35] in whom also after
[1:12:37] that she believed oh brother wait i
[1:12:39] always was this and it just you know i
[1:12:41] heard preachers say the other day it
[1:12:42] just it just come alive well that's okay
[1:12:44] that's fine
[1:12:47] but why didn't it come alive before
[1:12:50] because you had to hear the word
[1:12:52] you had to physically hear the word of
[1:12:53] god you had to hear god calling your
[1:12:55] name
[1:12:56] from the mind of god he's calling your
[1:12:58] name knowing that you were going to come
[1:12:59] to this place and be sick and tired of
[1:13:02] being sick and tired
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:06] done with this stuff
[1:13:08] i'm here lord
[1:13:11] and that happened to me i know what
[1:13:12] happened to y'all
[1:13:14] after that you believed after that you
[1:13:16] believe you got to believe in something
[1:13:19] oh this listen this up here is not
[1:13:21] believing at first
[1:13:24] you don't even know what virtue is you
[1:13:26] don't even know what knowledge and
[1:13:27] temperance is without having to hold the
[1:13:28] ghost
[1:13:33] but look after
[1:13:34] that you believed you were sealed
[1:13:37] with that holy spirit of promise sealed
[1:13:41] with that holy spirit of promise
[1:13:43] like i said before
[1:13:45] if you're
[1:13:46] if you're filled with the whole if you
[1:13:47] have a new birth
[1:13:50] right here you can't fall any further
[1:13:52] back
[1:13:54] all right
[1:13:57] you're a christian
[1:13:58] you don't have to go through the
[1:13:59] tribulation
[1:14:01] you don't have to stand to watch on
[1:14:03] judgment
[1:14:05] you get a free ticket
[1:14:08] cause you accepted him right here
[1:14:10] not up there at the top
[1:14:12] everybody got me
[1:14:15] your journey begins right here
[1:14:17] now listen
[1:14:19] then brother brown says your eternal
[1:14:22] destination begins at the altar do you
[1:14:24] know what he said begins at the altar
[1:14:26] where right here
[1:14:29] god knows where you're going to be on up
[1:14:30] this way but your eternal life begins
[1:14:32] what begins begins
[1:14:35] the journey
[1:14:37] begins the journey
[1:14:39] listen before you were born again you
[1:14:41] didn't know how to do this
[1:14:44] you didn't care
[1:14:48] i'm sorry you almost went somewhere i
[1:14:50] didn't
[1:14:51] some of y'all no i didn't care i care
[1:14:54] about god
[1:14:56] i'll be honest with you
[1:14:57] i knew of a god
[1:14:59] i knew that he was doing good for mom
[1:15:01] and dad and different ones but
[1:15:03] me
[1:15:04] i didn't care
[1:15:06] he was the furthest away from my
[1:15:08] thoughts
[1:15:09] at one time
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:13] let's just come listen this is one big
[1:15:15] confessional booth today
[1:15:19] hey if we don't get it right we can't
[1:15:23] i start somebody one time i said look if
[1:15:25] you start something wrong you can't make
[1:15:28] it right five years down the road
[1:15:31] you got to make it you got to go back to
[1:15:33] the foundation and make it right
[1:15:36] with anything
[1:15:38] that you do
[1:15:40] if you start it wrong it's like brother
[1:15:41] branham most of you know
[1:15:43] about hunting
[1:15:45] you start right here and you have to
[1:15:46] line those sights up if you're you might
[1:15:49] be it from here to that wall you might
[1:15:50] be off just maybe
[1:15:53] maybe a quarter of an inch
[1:15:56] but that bullet will never as he get
[1:15:59] further and shoot further and further
[1:16:01] away that bullet never
[1:16:04] comes back to where it's supposed to
[1:16:06] unless you come back here
[1:16:09] and adjust it
[1:16:11] go back to the table to the bench that
[1:16:13] you're shooting on you gotta adjust it
[1:16:15] that quarter of an inch because a
[1:16:17] quarter of an inch at this distance from
[1:16:19] here to that lady's house or the
[1:16:20] neighbor's house up there you might be
[1:16:22] off this far
[1:16:24] if you're 100 yards you may be so far
[1:16:25] off you you're hitting you're hitting
[1:16:27] the neighbor's cow
[1:16:29] instead of hitting the target
[1:16:31] but remember that bullet never never
[1:16:33] comes back
[1:16:35] you have to come back here
[1:16:38] you have to come back here
[1:16:41] and get it right to start with
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:44] focus that thing in right get it right
[1:16:46] together and put the front sight with
[1:16:48] the backside
[1:16:53] and then shoot the bullet
[1:16:57] which is the earnest
[1:16:59] see you're sealed right here
[1:17:02] and what is an earnest it's your down
[1:17:04] payment
[1:17:06] if you're born again
[1:17:08] the day you got born again you got a
[1:17:10] down payment
[1:17:13] on the possession of the whole house
[1:17:17] but you've got seven payments to make
[1:17:22] one two three four five six seven
[1:17:25] you got seven payments to make
[1:17:27] to get to your
[1:17:29] payoff
[1:17:30] of the home
[1:17:32] or your body change
[1:17:34] i think some of y'all more excited about
[1:17:35] your home mortgage being paid off than
[1:17:37] your body change
[1:17:40] it would help
[1:17:41] but that's temporal
[1:17:43] this is eternal
[1:17:46] now look
[1:17:47] let's go to first corinthians 3 verse 1
[1:17:49] and read it
[1:17:50] and paul admonishing the corinthians
[1:17:52] again
[1:17:55] and i brethren
[1:17:56] could not speak unto you as into
[1:17:58] spiritual but as into carnal so he comes
[1:18:00] to the corinthians he sees them doing
[1:18:02] all kind of things that that the
[1:18:04] ephesian church is not doing
[1:18:06] but you know what paul didn't say
[1:18:09] y'all bunch of
[1:18:11] bastards bastard children get out of
[1:18:14] here
[1:18:14] no he finds out there's fornicators
[1:18:17] there's whoremongers
[1:18:18] read corinthians
[1:18:22] right
[1:18:23] a boy living with a stepmom
[1:18:26] in the church
[1:18:28] and he goes on over in corinthians he
[1:18:30] said such for some of you
[1:18:34] but you are washed
[1:18:36] but you are sanctified
[1:18:39] we'll read that maybe later on my
[1:18:41] brethren could not speak unto you as
[1:18:42] into spiritual but as a carnal
[1:18:44] even as an even as unto babes in christ
[1:18:48] i have fed you with milk
[1:18:50] and not with meat
[1:18:53] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[1:18:55] it neither yet now are you able
[1:18:58] that's a question you need to ask
[1:18:59] yourself
[1:19:00] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:19:03] is among you envying strife division
[1:19:08] are you not carnal and walk as men
[1:19:11] he's asking the corinthians this is his
[1:19:13] church
[1:19:14] this is not the corinthians that's
[1:19:16] running around outside
[1:19:18] this is the people that paul is
[1:19:19] preaching to
[1:19:21] his congregation
[1:19:25] i couldn't speak to u.s spirits in other
[1:19:27] words he goes to the ephesian church and
[1:19:29] he speaks to them about predestination
[1:19:31] and about all these different things and
[1:19:32] and how they're like praise god
[1:19:35] and then he comes over to corinthians
[1:19:37] and and he sees this and he says y'all
[1:19:38] babies
[1:19:41] a bunch of babies but i'm going to take
[1:19:43] you babies though and i'm going to teach
[1:19:44] you
[1:19:45] because he goes back to corinthians
[1:19:47] strict corinth three times
[1:19:49] you all know that
[1:19:50] he went the car in three times
[1:19:52] so you know what paul didn't first time
[1:19:54] he didn't say all right i'm done with
[1:19:55] you i'm out of here
[1:19:56] no he goes back again
[1:19:58] he goes back again
[1:20:00] and he goes back again
[1:20:02] you know why because he sees some seed
[1:20:03] there
[1:20:04] he sees he sees it working but it's not
[1:20:06] coming you know the seeds laying in
[1:20:08] there
[1:20:09] we know that
[1:20:10] but it's the word that they heard
[1:20:13] misinterpreted theology is what got us
[1:20:15] all in trouble so it got the corinthians
[1:20:16] in trouble they were believing i think
[1:20:19] they were kind of
[1:20:20] uh heathens anyway
[1:20:22] believing in no god or anything like
[1:20:25] that so paul brings him a message like
[1:20:26] we're trying to do today we're trying to
[1:20:27] bring a message and break it down to
[1:20:29] where you can see this so the chart here

[1:21:24] said oh that way bro no he did not know
[1:21:26] what to call it
[1:21:28] paul did not know how how to call it the
[1:21:31] stature of a perfect man
[1:21:34] but he's preaching it
[1:21:38] to whom coming as into a living stone
[1:21:40] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:21:42] god and precious no that's jesus christ
[1:21:44] then he also as living stones are built
[1:21:46] up a spiritual house a holy priesthood
