TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and remember remember just a treated in trinidad so i love it so we got slim crew today but anyway we're on brotherly kindness part two now if you remember last sunday we were talking about oh let's go back to that let's go back just a second runway kindness i'm telling you this is going to be the hinge to the whole thing is brotherly kindness like brother claude now we're talking about because it's really brotherly love so that love and the capstone there's your hands to bring the cap down you can have we'll read it next sunday paul said you can have all the mysteries have all these things working in your life and have not charity which is love you're as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so without that love coming down but look what holds it off brotherly kindness that's the last one that we've got to overcome so last sunday we were talking about the statue of perfect man it says then sixthly let's add the bible said adding brotherly love brother kindness now that's a good one right here the sixth seventh all right adding brother kindness when we get to that brother kindness put yourself in his place on the matter my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him seven times a day he said seventy times seven all right that's 490. brotherly kindness now you see if her brother's all out of tune don't be impatient we didn't see be kind to him go anyway he said somebody said not too long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god in oneness all the rest then put seed brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient within seed temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believed remembers in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday god will bring him in now he uses every one of the virtues right there all right so to me brother kindness is bringing all those virtues together all right let's go to now and read according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness to the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue for by giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this besides all that giving all diligence add to your faith virtually the virtual knowledge and all these templates temper patience patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity here's one we didn't read last sunday verse nine but it says for if these things being you have bound this promise they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind it's not that you're not born again but if you like the virtues you're blind you're blind to the other things of god and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin all right and i want you we're going to read these quotes right here and then we're going to make a few comments because this is pertaining this is his wife this is sister mita people don't even know used to be a long time ago we'd go out if the neighbor when he was on the farm and somebody got sick we'd go over and cut the corn cut the wood and bring it in nowadays while you don't even know your neighbor's dead unless you read it in the paper is that right unless you read in the paper there's something wrong this is the prophet talking brotherly love has ceased it's awful here the other day i went downtown with my wife and there was some lady said how do you do sister brown i looked over to meet i said well you didn't speak to that woman she said yes i did i said well i didn't hear you she said i smiled i said oh that little old silly grin i said that's not speaking to somebody get out there on the street and shake your hand and say hello sister i'm glad to meet you amen brother that's what get back to the old-fashioned hewing line again where men are christians or christians and men and women live like they ought to so here's an example i want you to read this one right here with me real close it says 1956. now we are faced in the day that when it's prophesied to us that brotherly love would become a strange thing among people so it's the prophesy that brotherly love is going to be done away with now so only the true bride will have brotherly love then is that correct all right only the true bride that that has that in the pyramid that's what he's talking about here listen to this and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in god's bible if the lord jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say i'm gonna give you your choice you can be a great person a great minister i'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel i'll give you a gift of teaching the word or i'll give you the gift of divine healing i'll give you the gift of prophecy or i'll make you a prophet or any of the fine gifts of faith any of the gifts that's in the bible i'll give them everyone to you but then i will withhold love from you or either i'll give you love and withhold the gift from you i say lord take all the gifts and let me have the love for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of god is the motive behind the gift now that's pretty good list of things that most people would take that but remember the uh the prophecy of danny henry remember the prophecy of danny henry the god said it's the the way you chose a greater portion of heaven to be given to you all right now let's read this one right here now pentecost was god's vine which was the new vine that has grown up and these four destroyers has been the one that he's divine down now let's find out what pentecost had and find out what we got lacking then we ought to find out what the destroyers are who they are well what's did it now the first thing that pentecost produced was brotherly love now he's talking about original pentecost everybody got that he's not talking about azusa street he's talking about on the day of pentecost acts 2 38 he's talking about that group of people because watch because the first thing that pentecost producers probably love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a brotherhood to such a way they had everything in common in the bible now you remember what they did they sold all their possessions and brought it in to peter in them and then they distributed it out to the people that's the apostolic way in the starting of the new testament because remember adam and i since the fire the problem that god had with landonite since the fire they didn't give all that's right they only give a portion and kept the portion and paul peter tells him says why do you sin against the holy ghost he didn't sin against peter he has sinned against his apostles he has sent they said against the holy ghost now my question to you is if we got to go back to the apostolic way then we got to start selling everything we got and give it to brother dale and let him distribute it out as needed now are we willing to do that i don't see any head shaking that's what he said tore down the middle wall petition and made a brotherhood in such a way that they had everything in common in the bible days the brotherhood paul spoke of this brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the pentecostal church and then said in first corinthians 13 though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not this love which brings the brotherhood i am nothing and though i have the knowledge to understand all the mysteries of god i am still nothing without love the love of the brethren right right here jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have loved one for another that's the only way god's going to know this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other pentecost had it i'm speaking pentecost meaning the first group of the apostles and disciples they had that brotherly love they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church everybody reading this but when i said that did something inside you say i ain't gonna do that now where was that been if that was the holy ghost then they had the statue of a perfect man up to brotherly kindness right they had all those virtues working in their life paul peter and james john all those first original disciples they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together till even when one heard the other one died they said let's go and die with him such a feeling now jesus spoke of that paul did rather and said let brotherly love continue that was in the first church but something taken place and there was a fellow come in by the name of palmerworm and when he began to eat on that vine of brotherly love he cut the very sap line of it okay now there's nobody going to ask to do that in this age okay even brother brown see they they in back in the 60s uh gene goad and and all them went out to arizona who was it goatee yeah mercer mercier and go they went out of arizona and started to commune had their own money had their own they were commune they lived in trailers and brothers told them not to do that see they were going to try to do it that way but you know what they did not have the same motive as the ones in the first church age or it would have worked because if it would have happened with the same motive in the first church age it would have to work the same way in this age everybody understand that so if something doesn't work it's because your motive and objective is wrong and god knows that god's the only one that knows your inner part of you that is wrong of what you've done all right but they let the palmer worm get in now let's read this right here he comes and preaches the palm worm locust caterpillar in jeffersonville the next thing that we'd like to say for is brotherly luck has been eaten away from the vine brotherly love jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another the reason they were called christians and antioch because they acted like christ right well just what scripture said well let's just take an example if a man don't believe the same as i do i'll go right into his congregation and preach with him just preach what he believes and go right ahead and let it go because i love him by the fruits you know them if they don't believe it and they haven't got brotherly love they drop out disagree fall away i'll have nothing to do with it why don't you come to me and talk to me about it you don't know what i believe to see what difference does it make anyhow well i believe it's who i believe jesus christ i've never left a meeting yet with a bad taste as i know of now remember that's what billy paul said about brother brown he never knew who his enemies you never knew he knew who they were but you never knew who didn't like brother brown and who did he treated him all the things but by discernment i know he he knew exactly who liked him and who did i've never left a meeting yet with a bad taste as i know of but you see brotherly love has been all discarded and paul saying it in corinthians let brotherly love continue but brotherly love has been taken away now if the prophet said it's been taken away then there's got to be a restoration of that because we got to be restored back to the faith of the fathers right that was the message of the hour to bring back he was the prime example now come upon this scripture in leviticus because jesus quotes the scripture we don't know many times that jesus is called the old testament it's not something fresh he's just taking the old testament and expounding on it in leviticus 19 18 thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people now spiritually this is the children of thy people right okay but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself that was in leviticus that was under the law i am the lord now in matthew 5 43 jesus as you have heard you have heard that it has been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy see they put this in when the pharisees come they put that in all right because it does not say here to hate your enemy it says love your neighbor as yourself okay it doesn't say love those who love you and hate those who hate you you know me it says love but i say unto you see he's bringing it thou shalt love thy neighbor and they have interjected in from the old testament and hate that enemy because you know you can pull things out of the bible says an eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth you know you can bring those things in under the law and and said if somebody murders you then you go murder it murders your brother you go murder somebody you know they so they interjected this but i say unto you love your enemy that's what he brought you have to love your enemy as a human being but you don't you don't have to that's correct no we'll get into that in just a minute or either next sunday but we need to go up a little early love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward heaven that's easy it's easy to be around somebody alive what reward is that do not even the republicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the republicans so and he summed it all up matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect or complete but let's get back to what sister trinity's talking about because remember there's a point here you do love everybody but remember i've heard i've heard people in this church say well i'm going to go to church with them so they'll come to church with us you can't do that right you cannot compromise by doing that there is no compromising to that you don't do that if they want to come here that's okay but to go there and miss the service here i i don't see so what you're doing is you're compromising with them no stay where you are be an example i promise you if you become the example what is virtue strength if they can't draw virtue off of you they're not coming anyway they're just gonna come because you come and when you see that many times they just you know you you you go visit somebody and say well i'm i'm gonna go visit so-and-so and then they feel like they need to come visit you because you ain't visit them well not in the spiritual world brother branham loved those people and he did go and preach for him because listen brother brown was in a unique situation he was coming out of the old pentecostal age amen he was trying to restore the faith of the father through those people because remember you and i his people were not here yet you understand what i'm saying his people that are going to understand the end time message and know the end time message and take the the whole word we weren't even in we weren't even setting any denominations at that time some of us weren't even born you understand what i'm saying yes 56 57 so most of us in this room well a lot of you were but i wouldn't most of y'all cathy and all them i was born for that but uh we really did miss you right now ray said he didn't take and that's sweet see he didn't have no clothes where you had to buy him something from south dakota so we can wear it where it's closed this is going on the internet you know all right yeah love your enemies we'll bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you this is all contrary to human nature that scripture right there is contrary to your human nature you have got to override everything in your life that you've heard all the hatred all that i do you know don't talk to them people don't do that but remember find a line here by the line we're brotherly kindness brother brown preached to those people but he never entered into their doctrine he went to the assemblies he went to the church of god he went and he said they're fine brothers and they were born again believers in those buildings at that time did everybody understand that say amen they weren't not that we're just born again and they were all off no when a sister would come to the platform in 1949 and he said sister i see that you're a christian you're born again well she was probably a pentecostal 40s pentecostal even maybe a baptist or a methodist but remember as it gets closer watch how that pyramid gets smaller and smaller so we've come to this time where we don't take our group of people and go to a denominational church you can't convert denominational churches you can convert denominational people yes but you cannot say well we're going to go to the baptist and we're just going to close shop and we're going to all go start going to a baptist church that's not you can't do that but brotherly kindness is though that god not looked down on them say well they're nothing well you know they might be something right they might be given eternal life for what they believe for what they see and we may miss it because we see it and don't believe it or live it one of the two all right but we don't go out there with it you say well sister says well i don't feel comfortable about going to your church if you'll if you'll wear earrings with me i'll go to church with you know so i won't feel some no you don't enter into that we still have a lot of holiness that we keep okay and to me that's where the true love comes from you keep your love to god first then you take that love and when you give it to somebody else if you give that love not your love or the love of something else if you give them your love that you have the godly love you have if you give it to them and they accept it they're going to automatically act like you do right you're not going to convert to them and really they're not converting to you up there where it says jesus christ is who we believe in brother brown said right here in this quote right here it's who i believe in jesus christ now we know that under the revelation that we have it's not the same jesus christ that they they're in a trinitarian doctrine okay they're believing that jesus the second person of the trinity but so did you at one time yes so did we have other gods you know to understand the meaning of love the way god means it it's really hard because what did god do with his enemies he destroyed them and abraham lincoln said the best the best way to make uh to get rid of your enemies is to make them your friends abraham lincoln said that right you remember the story the south was defeated and one of the congressmen from the north was standing there beating his hands on the desk in congress and he said they're our enemies they're our enemies they're you know how we gonna you know because abraham lincoln wanted them to show brotherhood that everything was coming back together he said they're our enemies we should treat them like the enemies and abraham lincoln said if we treat them like their enemies they'll continue to be our enemies but if we treat them like our fans our friends we have destroyed the enemy without destroying the physical person right now we read in psalm 78 that was a perfect example now god destroyed the amalekites and all the amorites and all those people because they sinned against god but now so did israel did israel stand against god just like they went after baal they went after i've been reading in judges man in judges they went after everything when there was no king or when you know between the time of between the time of abraham and all them and and david you had a gap in there where it was ruled by judges and man they were putting up groves for baal and all these things god has sent a prophet in like gideon or somebody destroy it guess what it raised right back up to it again but what i'm saying here i forgive them of their iniquity because they're his children they were his children from the beginning same way with you and i were his children from the beginning that's what that's why you see all that summation even after all that he gives you a summation you can be perfect even as your father in heaven is purpose because that's that's a commandment be therefore perfect as your father never but we do not have to and i don't think we ever should compromise on our belief we should never compromise on our belief we should be so salty until they see now see what what the confusion is in this end time is that you go out and i'm going to talk about you don't talk about you and most of message people they go out and act like the devil in secret at work play or whatever say a little bad word wear a little something different than you would at church put your whatever put whatever in there they see that and that confuses them more than it helps them there's your confusion is if they look at you and can't see the christian life but you profess the christian life and come to this church or whatever message church there's the confusion that's what confuses people more than anything is for you to live one way here and another way out there and somebody see that and go well why are you doing that and you're supposed to be doing this you know what why are you out here breaking the law xyz doesn't matter put whatever in there and then you come here and profess you're a christian to me to me that is well really probably not born again probably not even at the bottom of the pyramid okay because because you're supposed to act this way all the time and you know what there's times that we slip up and do make mistakes we do maybe break the law or or something but but it's not out of it's not out of every time we go to the store we try to cheat somebody out of something or you know i've heard people even in the message we go eat somewhere and they wouldn't put a tip down because that person wasn't a christian or that person would have tattoos or earrings or whatever of course me and jim we always slip a little extra money on the plate or on the table before we leave i've seen 20 people in a message church get up leave a table and leave two dollars for a tip happened in miami i'm sorry it happened in miami with us and that girl worked her fanny off for about 20 of us and they left two dollars now you'll be ashamed of yourself to me that's not and you know what you said while the girl well you know what that girl saw with you sitting there she saw you were talking about the lord i hope and you had your lung you had the long hair the dress and you're supposed to be a church group and then you get up and do that you know what puts a sour taste in her mouth she said whatever they got i don't want that's right okay so and that's just one thing leave a tip you know if you leave 15 that's fine but we always believe 20. but you know what they're hard-working people that's brotherly kindness that's showing no barriers i don't care if the woman's got tattoos tongue ring or if her ears are pierced 50 times to me that makes no difference that's right now we do judge by looks don't we we do as human judged by looks we shouldn't do that that's what jesus said love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you i'll leave you with that we'll follow up next sunday i told you this is going to be the toughest one for it they only paid 20 10 30 or vice versa no no the fact that they did give say they sold a piece of property for a thousand dollars they said oh we get 500 for this and here's our five hundred dollars well they kept 500. that was the problem they kept 500. and the lord just earned that yeah and said no you didn't give all you only
