TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay good morning everybody god bless y'all got a lot of technology to catch up to so taking me a minute here all right this morning i'm going to teach y'all about picture perfect once i get the slides open here all right picture perfect is a phrase that we use commonly in our society and everybody knows what that means basically like a picture like this like i took it one of the chicken farms that i go to just a beautiful picture and it's something we say is picture perfect but what i'm talking about this morning is our revelation forgotten to pray hold on one sec dear heavenly father we pray you just bless the services today we pray bless brother bob ministering here brother wade of their ministry in ohio just give glory to yourself in the service lord and bless again all the spoken requests sister freda specially pray you can continue to manifest your healing in her body all the other requests were mentioned lord and just anoint brother bob and help us to hear and understand as your word comes forth through your servant this morning and we love you and thank you for all your blessings in jesus name amen so i'm going to talk about picture perfect and i'm referring to our revelation and you see i've got a canvas up here does everybody know what a canvas is anybody doesn't this is what a artist will use to paint on it's just like a fabric material stretched over a wooden frame but in our minds the way our minds work there's kind of like this picture a lot of pictures in our minds and we the way we see things the way we perceive things our minds work that way and but what i'm talking about this morning is our revelation because brother bannon said we need revelation more than anything it's so important and what revelation does is it paints this picture on our canvas in our mind it paints us a picture of god of the redemption plan of his all of his program and our part in that so we want our canvas and our mind to match that of god's the difference being mainly of course his is infinite he's going to be always unfolding through the endless ages of eternity and we'll continue to understand more about him his character his ways but even though ours is finite ours kind of has a limit but it still needs to match his we need unadulterated word we need as close we need it to be exact an exact match of the original which is the mind of christ so picture perfect means that phrase means lacking in defects or flaws or it means ideal and one reason i want to talk about this is because when i came to the message in 2002 straight out of the baptist church i had kind of a stumbling block i had never heard of revelation and when i heard people talk about divine spiritual revelation i thought wow that seems really profound and brother brandon talked about how important it is and i thought well i don't know if i'll ever be a candidate for that it's just over my head turns out god reveals himself in simplicity so if you just attach yourself to that by reading the bible and praying every day and seeking god with all of your heart he'll do the revealing you leave that part up to god we're all a candidate for it if we just make ourselves available it's not over your head and revelation has a lot to do with so many things in our life your growth and your the things you do in your natural body you know it um the things that you do like for example eve or we call her the woman before the fall in the garden she got a wrong brush stroke painted on her canvas she came out from behind the fortification of the word and that caused the fall because of that one wrong brush stroke the rest of the picture might have been perfect and ripe because but because of that cow getting in the tree in the grass it messed up everything so the things in your body a lot of times the things we seem like we can't control in our body if we just keep studying the word and seeking god for more revelation sanctification will be going to take place all right from the message who is this in 1959 but yet to know him his eternal life to know him the person christ that's where eternal life lays knowing him personally yourself know his nature what he does is acts and then when you do that you'll have a knowledge of his word and what he wants you to do that's where faith comes from and this is eternal life that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent i've got a few scriptures to get out of the way here and then we'll get to i've got a lot to say actually so i'm going to talk really fast colossians 1 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding colossians 1 further along in that chapter i say whether they be things in earth things in heaven and you who are sometimes alienated enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath to be reconciled the body is flesh to the death to present you holy and blame will not approval in his side see we come here with a wrong canvas we come here with a lot of preconceived ideas about god and a lot of things that we need corrected so god does two things he opens up and he expounds on our revelation but then also he's correcting all those errors those flaws on our picture because like i said we want our picture perfect if you continue in the faith ground and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherever i paul made a minister who now rejoiced in my sufferings for you and philip that's behind the affliction of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church okay and wherever i made a minister let's see let's get on down to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the gentiles that's us which is christ and you the hope of glory and proverbs 29 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and envision there means prophetic vision or revelation um recently i actually thought of this this uh sunday school lesson back in a couple months ago and have been kind of rolling over my mind since then and since that time it seemed like almost every minister is touching on something that i'm fixing to talk about but but recently brother matthew and brother wade talked about predestination and talked about how much it ties into our free moral agency and i love what brother matthew brought out about how basically i don't remember exactly how he worded it but basically from your birth even from the time you're in the womb the lord is beholding you he's watching you he's watching as you develop and all the while through your life there's this anointing or this position that god is calling you to that's ready for you to receive it once you make the decision it's just following you through your life and when you choose to connect to that by your free moral agency you choose to accept christ as your savior and start following him reading the word every day and saturate yourself in the word of god you're connecting to that you're hearing from your theophany and all these things and it's really a profound thing but it's all tied to your predestin to your free moral agency like brother tom falbo said we trigger our predestination i love that okay if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ and he is the word and then on down that's i think that same sermon there is no place for denomination no place for creed outside of the bible so when you see these things they'll come into the picture and that's why people has added other things got their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up can't make it come out right the same yesterday today and forever but if the thing is put together right there is the entire picture of the fall regeneration the whole picture of creation and god's whole plan revealed right in jesus christ it's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together he says that's why we got picture today it looks horrible say we're believers in the cow in the top of the tree in the grass it don't work you say the same yesterday today forever all but a certain thing then you ruin your picture so we know in the picture here we have a cow we've got a tree we got some grass got some mountains in the background all that looks good but the position of the cow is wrong the cows up in the tree trying to eat some grass it's no problem if we're wrong the problem is if we stay wrong when the word comes to correct us okay that's where we mess up at it's our attitude toward the word there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert talking about somebody say uh the works that he did will do also that's for another age that's what people say well anyway he was fishing at galilee getting where he's fishing together there's plenty of fish you see you got to make the picture look right that's god's great picture there we have a man in the desert the desert looks good the man fishing he's got a good fish there that looks all normal it's just the placement of the man in the desert catching the sand fish doesn't make sense so let's suppose that when we first come to christ here we have the initial part of our picture which is right and it's from god and it's basically however you want to think of it it's you it's it's calvary is christ on on the cross he's dying for your sins and for the first time in your life the truth strikes your heart with a conviction and you say wow i'm a sinner and i need salvation you might have heard the word many times growing up here we live in the bible belt we're all around people in church and things and especially if we grew up in church but then at one point in time it convicts your heart and that paints the original the initial part of your picture which is christ's on calvary and you kneeling there for forgiveness of sins and that part never goes away i believe that we'll always remember christ died for our sins we are sinners once and need of salvation so then what happens is he continues to expound on that when you come to sanctification about from the holy spirit and you understand the oneness of the godhead and understand serpent seed all that is going around this central thing which is christ on calvary questions on genesis now yeah what i'm trying to do let's just i'm going to read this quote okay now the next thing we begin to see my eyes are supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there this is before john 1. before in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word made flesh dwelt among us brother bran is talking about right before that how did we get from this elohim that god dwelling on his attributes to that john 1. and right in there he's he's kind of painting a picture he's saying let's stand on the banister of heaven you go back and read this and question answers on genesis 1953 he's standing there like on the banister looking letting us you know we're just kind of looking over and watching this happen watching something come that we can begin to understand god we see a little white light forming out there and what is that is called by bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing orders i was going to say the part of god began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea of what it was it's a little like a little light moving that was the word of god so here we are we're watching this unfold and we can't see anything there's no atoms no air to make uh uh no molecules to even make air no space no time no nothing and it's just god dwelling on his attributes and how can we understand that we really can't so he says well i'm going to condescend into a form where i can begin to be understood i'm going to say we see a little white light like a halo i'm just doing my best to illustrate this to paint a picture in your mind logos speech language was born god invented language this process what is language it's where one entity has a thought and can transmit that thought or transfer that thought to another entity god can transmit his thoughts to man or man to man like i say banana and instantly everybody here thinks of a curved yellow and very tasty fruit and all i had to do is say one word and i took that picture of banana transmitted it to your mind that's how language works and god made it for a reason he invented that one thing that's phenomenal to me is that we get language we get our first language for free the second one's hard to learn but we get our first one free when you're a baby god programmed you to start to learn language whatever you're exposed to that's what you're going to learn it's language and later on in life you can begin to receive god through faith kung by hearing through hearing the word of god so god condescended into a word form or a i like to say like this and i might be wrong for saying this i believe you could say it that it's a word description of who god is god chose to do it that way he chose to condescend and then brother ben goes on to say it's like a child playing for his father's door with all eternity before him and begins to create and all these worlds roll off of his hands philippians 4. brother dale's quoted this for years at the end of every sermon think on these things i want to just break that down for a few minutes and then get to a story that i want to tell y'all that's really exemplifies all this i didn't reorder these these are exactly the order that paul puts them in if i'm wrong about saying this this proce this process still works even if paul didn't intend this if god didn't intend this i might be wrong okay for interpolating whatever this way but look if you go right up the line at the bottom we start with the very bottom on the left side where it says finally brethren whatsoever things are one two three four five six seven eight right up the page you see eight things eternity right first thing paul says is truth this is our meditation scripture this is what i use all the time in meditation it's a process you think of two things basically you can think of your natural journey how god got you to where you are naturally speaking in life and think of your spiritual journey how he got you where you are today in your spiritual journey first thing we all hear is truth some point in our life when we were a sinner we were going in the wrong direction a downward trajectory we were trending down for our whole life until salvation when the word convicted our heart we started on an upward trajectory so the first thing that intercepted us was truth when it convicted our heart yes i didn't read the scripture romans 10 so then faith coming by hearing here by the word of god that word that logos that speech when you first hear that and it comes with a conviction in your heart then it calls you to be honest the second thing paul mentions there honesty for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation it's like that mirror and i think it's in the book of james when you're looking in the word of god and you see yourself the law that was our schoolmaster the word that tells you you don't match this and you first realize and it's like it's so surreal you're all of a sudden sees you're a sinner needs salvation it's not because you're afraid of hell it's because you realize you need god okay you really need god in your life and you begin to be honest then you go through justification and sanctification he says what's everything that are just what other things are pure whatever things are lovely the baptism the holy ghost the love of god shed abroad in your heart makes your life a good report he says if they're whatever things are of good report that's where god gives you the token the baptism of the holy spirit and it puts you in faith in the pyramid and you're still just starting your journey you still have a lot of growth to go and he says if there be any virtue the virtues virtue knowledge temperature patience god and kindness brother uh godliness brother kindness and if there be any praise the capstone us united with god so god has the preeminence in flesh like he always wanted to the ultimate praise to god we can praise him and worship and get in the spirit but then what he really wants is to inhabit flesh he wants to inhabit us now think keep in mind you can think well i'm right i believe the revelation of the word i believe my pastor i believe everything the ministers preach i sit here come every sunday and listen to the word good now it's possible to believe something wrong and not know it proverbs 20 the spirit of man is the count of the lord searching all the inner parts of the belly i'm telling you why it's so important to study and pray and seek god hebrews 4 for the word of god is quick and powerful sharpening any to his sword pushing the dividing sun or soul and spirit of the joint submarine is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when you don't even realize you're wrong the word of god is coming in because you're reading it taking it on day by day it's coming and doing its supernatural work of sanctifying taking all those wrong elements out of your canvas and painting the right picture search me oh god and know my heart this is david try me and know my thoughts see if they're being wicked away in me and leave me in the way everlasting this thing takes a long time to go the next slide who do you say this is brother brandon said the evidence of the holy ghost is believing his word always been in every age if you can receive the word i'll skip that one and then they got down there and blow up like a toad frog eating buckshot i don't know if any girl ever encountered this than anybody i have how can you believe when you've got nothing to believe with if god's in your heart's throne i tell you he will agree with every word i've encountered people in and out of the message they usually come to me i'm not going to them trying to correct them in doctrine people have come to me try to straighten me out and then i tell them something that's contrary to them and they look like this they absolutely swell up in the neck and get mad and angry and i'm thinking why are you so upset if you know what you believe don't worry about it i know what i believe so i'm not scared when i blow up like a tow truck getting a buck shot uh cats turn sideways i swell up in their back you know because they're trying to when they feel intimidated they're trying to look big and bulky and i guess maybe frogs do do it for maybe the same reason around a predator or something trying to look tough and mean why are you so scared if you know what you believe don't be afraid but anyway that just shows the wrong attitude much like cain had the wrong attitude abel had the right revelation had the right sacrifice god accepted it cain's main problem was not that he had the wrong painting he had a beautiful painting with fruits all over it and he said god i want to give you such a beautiful offering you have to accept it and god said that's not according to the original painting i can't take that but if you do like able you'll be accepted or won't you be accepted and then kane said nope i've already took in my canvas i've hung it on the wall i've framed it don't touch it i like it the way it is leave it and you blow up like a bullfrogging buckshot and killed abel right wrong attitude hateful mean murder and everything else totally the wrong attitude mainly because he wouldn't take truth when it was presented to him and we're actually told in scripture first john 4 believe not every spirit betrays the spirits were there of god but we are supposed to try them when we're going down in one way in life and then god sends someone whether it be a laity or a preacher or even just a friend or whoever and tries to give you correction you have to consider it that's all i'm saying you have to consider it don't paint frame your painting so i believe this for 40 years blessed god but if our gospel will be hid it's head to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of damage believe not lest the light of the boy's gospel should shine to them let me try to speak through this i still got my story to tell i got down in a few more minutes john 5 and the father himself which i sent me as boring witness of me you never have heard his voice anytime or seen his shape if not his word abiding you for and then you think of eternal life search the scriptures he told us this thing is so slow if revelation is beyond you look up and seek god for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it a revelation has to come from god you have to receive the holy ghost and then only in the spirit god give you revelation jesus is the christ god the anointed one i want to tell y'all a little story and i've been leading up to this the whole time okay once upon a time that was a little girl oh yeah he said i need to call him god for revelation more than anything else in the world there's a little girl named jesse and this little girl was born in an alcoholic family she was the middle of three girls there they are jessie jackie and jennifer this was the middle of three girls now she was born alcoholic home poor home and grew up living sometimes in a tent sometimes in a car sometimes in a an old run-down house with an outhouse that didn't work so they had to use a bucket in the closet that was their bathroom much of the time growing up like third world country kind of scenario begging on the street for food um all of them that mom and dad made them little signs hold up signs and we're hungry you know feed us and then the mom and dad will take some of that money and go buy more alcohol totally addicted to alcohol just ruin that home well eventually they wound up in jail these uh the oldest of these girls jennifer went to live with their grandma the little two the uh jessie and jackie went to live in foster care they were orphans so now she's growing up as an orphan from age 10 to about age 17 and all that time tossed around from home to home into home and a lot of them foster homes actually bring in these orphan kids and make them like little slaves a little cinderella she had to pull up weeds and scrub the floors and all that kind of stuff and then hoping at the end of it that they'd keep her and then they turn around again no go to another home and all that time she was praying god i just want a family please just give me a family and this little girl grew up that way and age 14 the longer she spent in this foster care system the the the more she gave up she began to give up hope and around 14 she started trying to kill herself and and who wouldn't in that scenario when she had grown up really rough sexually abused emotionally abused physically abused on every form of view of abuse before with foster care and and then um some not so good things in foster care too she's trying to kill herself and then but i have to mention this her name was jessica which means god beholds remember what i said at the beginning god behold your life from the time you're in the womb to the time you're born he's watching you waiting for you to come to what you're predestinated to so there she was little jessica which means god beholds how likely how unlikely is it that she would ever come to eternal life to salvation to accept the message but today she believes the message and she studies and prays and sees god with all of her heart how did she come to that how unlikely is that of that home you know i was born raised to baptist it was kind of in my programming i was already going to church when i came to message it was hard to receive it but yet not as hard as it would be it seemed like for someone from that kind of background as little jesse but yet god beholds and then one day came this message family this husband and wife that wanted to adopt a boy they came to this picnic the foster system put on this picnic of all the little foster kids could meet some potential adoptive parents here they came this message family and they said well we want to get this boy we've adopted a bunch of girls we want a boy they took a picture of this boy they got to know him a little bit they took the picture home developed it developed the film and it was jesse and jackie but they took a picture of the boy but jesse and jackie showed up in the picture and they said well maybe the lord's dealing with us so they they uh prayed about it and said lord this your will and he wanted evidence to adopt these two girls the mama picked out she said i want this one and you can have that one she started already picking them out who's whose is whose so they went adopted these girls and totally still wearing pants makeup and everything you would be surprised that a message family bring someone like that into their home but they didn't care they wanted to adopt them give them a home and love them so age 17 jesse got to pick her new name when she got adopted she said i want to be called gabrielle and i want to go by the name of gabby and this is what she looked like when she came into that home when they adopted her now you talking about what if what if there she is on the left jesse and on the right is gabby my wife what if when she got adopted and they presented her with the message and with christ what if she kept her canvas and said you know what i've been all these different denominational churches in the foster care i'm going to frame my picture like i understand of god already i'm going to frame it hang on the wall you can't touch it musicians come please i'm going to frame my picture and nobody can touch it what if she did that what if she didn't keep an open mind and let christ in what if she just hardened her heart and said no i won't have it i won't have it but instead she opened her heart in her mind and she said lord i want you more than anything and today she stays up half the night studying and praying and seeking god with all of her heart so my point is in this whole lesson is keep your canvas open keep your mind your heart open and one of the ways to do that is read the bible and pray every day such a simple process god bless you all thank you
