pray that you'd guide each one now have your way and just come and speak to our hearts and lives in Jesus name amen seem like we have a up and down a little bit of the feed I don't know what it is Josh but I can tell a little bit up here maybe it's not back there but kind of going up and down some so all right Revelations 1 I was thinking you know I've preached on this many many times out of here but I hope it's never got to where that becomes uh you know tiring or whatever I don't know where it's that or where it's the sound like we get the off of it a little bit but we have spoke on this and we'll continue I guess to speak on it because I love it it's the bride's book Amen in the time you know in the doing so we just appreciate it amen Revelations 1 revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now the time is at hand I just picked up a couple of these and didn't give them to put on the uh you know the internet but uh you know the time is at hand see it's this time that's where he's pointing to is this time it's it's right here all right in brother says in in the revelations book of symbols uh 1956 617 paragraph 49 so the time is at hand said this book is to the Servants of God for the last time when the time is at hand when this book will be revealed the time is at hand when the book is to be revealed do you understand it that's where we're at now all right then he goes down to um paragraph that was paragraph 49 goes down to paragraph 78 of the same book and he says then the time is at hand and never a time since that day until this has the mystery of Jesus Christ ever been revealed until these last few years then which means that that time or shortly there after you know then the time is at hand right then page 16 of the church age book he said the time was not at hand previously the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of God this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God could not come forth hither to thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age age only and at a specific time all right he said this L age Lady of see the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think of this and heed it well for we are at the in time all right so the time is at hand the time to what the time to understand this is the day when it was to come forth and we was to understand and see the hour that we're living amen and I don't think that there could be anything any greater than for us to uh find out who we are right Amen to see who we are and what it is you know is in the understanding I just don't see how it could be any uh there's not anything could be any greater than to realize the Revelation you know of who we are and what we're doing here and and that way with Revelation then we will be able to withstand Satan and this is the most horrible age of all for Satan to try in every way and now he's using the message against you and I yes because we were talking last night about it in the the Bible study and different things I just don't understand when you can read something in the Bible brother the Ryan asked a question there at the end last night about how could these people kind of believe doctrines with that scripture that he gave you know that he that believe that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh see that's right here now that's got to be right present tense and how could they believe those doctrines with with that type of scripture and I said I don't understand it because that's the what I believe you know that when I can look at the scripture and I can see it that simple that I can read this like the Book of Revelation read it oh we say well what is the time at the hand what did that mean right there did that mean over here did that mean over there you know what it means the time when this book is being revealed right the time is at hand all right so then that's a simple simple thing of knowing and seeing to understand the hour that we're living now I gave you one this morning and I want to repeat that again to us as we begin to look it this because this book is the book now remember it's we gave you the quote where brother around said it's it's the revelation of Jesus Christ but it's not just the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in his bride amen down through the seven Church ages now that's the Book of Revelation so it's our book it's speaking personally yes to you and I if you want to read any book you would ask me Brother D what book in the Bible would be good to study on The Book of Revelation well now all of them symbols all we just listen to the prophet right and if you can't find it ask somebody and we'll try our best to help you to understand you know the uh the the the things of the where it's at or find it for you to see what brother brandham has said about these things and then see that would bring it to us all right now we ended up kind of speaking on the life say saying that he said in the book so go ahead and pull up number one brother of what we were using this morning that you know look what the prophet had to say he said it's like a voice of a trumpet say it unto me I am Alpha and Omega now we'll get to it in a minute the the Alpha and Omega ties into to where that we're at in today you know the end time all right the first thing I want to introduce it here I'm the the the I am the first and the light the first thing when the trumpet of God sounded I he turned and said I am Alpha and Omega I am from A to Z I'm all of it stand and listen to me as while now listen to that one amen it goes for the other one that I brought you know we'll get to it in a minute he said stand and listen to me a while all right now he's saying I'm the alpha and omega I'm the all of it I'm the complete Revelation now if you understand I'm the complete Revelation now stand and listen to me a while what brother around say that is being said to John on pmas see now who's this addressed to were addressed specifically were about back to the age now watch no to the church to the church it's not just to an age because an age can't receive anything and we know the message goes to the age the age of ly or the age of Philadelphia the age of Ephesus no but it's being specifically addressed to the Bride of Jesus Christ now nobody can understand the book unless they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right now you can word out the words and express something to somebody you know was speaking and explain something by intellect that's right but if you don't have the Holy Ghost and the person you're talking to don't have the Holy Ghost one if one has the Holy Ghost other one don't one speaking in one language one the other one right that's right one is a natural language the other one is a Heavenly language so God says now listen you understand who I am now listen to me a while that's right stand still and listen go ahead pull the next one up brother CU there one I gave this morning and before I show you anything I want to let you know who I am right I am the Alpha and Omega he says the beginning and the ending right so now listen for a while listen to the words of authority because that's what he's expressing then he starts talking about who not addressed to even the age itself because the age gets a split message right the age gets to the false and to the TR it's a split message to the ages all right one to the true one to the false and coming down all right but this is not this is to the bride this is the bride's book this is the book of you and I telling about you and I yes some of you may like to read novels you know and and and do it I I read them this way I read few words the front and I turn to the back I read John and Mary and then at the end of it I read and they got married and rode off into the sunset you know well I done got the whole story you can go through all the rest of it you want to but I done got the whole story because I done found out who it was and find out what they doing you know all right but see God keeps unfolding his word and my whole point now is to try to get us to see one thing the Bible is revealing you and I amen right now these are helpful notes and points for later on cuz you see the the Believers in the book we we look at it like this kind of book and see that's what we're doing over in Revelations 5 when we talk about the seos and the taking the book and that we're like trying to look at a book like this you know some form that we can make and then say no no no it's not that it's Scrolls you know well we've been all through those things but I I thought the Bible was written about the people on Earth yes right you know what I thought it was written about Mo uh about Moses and his life while he was here amen it was written about Paul in his life while he was on earth right it was written about Jesus and his life well why can't we see that it's written about you and I Amen in our lives we are we'll get to it after a while we're we under our messenger will be the final voice to the final age well why can't we believe that right why can't we believe who we are well just just just you know it's just so hard cuz there's so many things that's going wrong see you're still hooked on if everything was going right so let me quote brother Rand uh I may Mis phrase it a high but it won't be much but he said the starry Skies you know and the great things that are happening are no sign of God's approval he said neither is the stormy thing a sign of his disapproval that's right he said his approval is in the elect amen right cuz that's his children that's right now no matter what you think about your family you know you still have a closer connection to your family than you do to anyone else right that's right I mean you may love other people and and all like that but still it's your family that's right well I believe that's the way God is it's just not a book written down that this is the act actually you know you could take this Bible and and put it into a movie yes and let the players act it out that's right you I mean you could see all of that you can see the I'd love to watch The Ten Commandments and you know and see what who is it Char and H they playing Moses yes and all and and I thought he done a good job in the the basis of portraying pretty close about what it would be like you know in a lot of respects you know and but still my point is the whole Bible could be put in movie form that's right to be able to be seen yes what would be our part of it we can look back and see other ages but why can't we see Who We Are that's right you know that they're waiting on us yes it's not us waiting on them that's right they're waiting on you and I to come to a place for a change to be able to take place amen go to Hebrews 11:40 without us they cannot be made perfect like brother dick was saying the other day see now brother Bram died and went to the Grave so he's one of them waiting on us all right but so is brother Tatum sister Tatum you know Paul saying that then a few days later Paul had head chopped off you know what he was waiting on us yes well why can't we believe that church why can't we see who we are in the hour that we're living and see then the revelation of Jesus Christ is not now listen is not just a revelation of seeing Jesus Christ that's right that's the key that I'm trying to get us all to see amen we said well I see him he was there 2,000 years ago and there he was beautiful we've seen we got pictures of him and we we've got all of these things you know and uh that's well and good but where's Jesus Christ see it's not just talking about Jesus right that would go into a on that's form amen and if you stop only trying to reveal Jesus then you're one that's preaching that's right but I want to see Jesus Christ in that way then I'll be seeing myself right amen and learning who I am all right now so in the Book of Revelations he's never saw alone he's always in with the bride or in the bride and that way then we cannot we don't have to look at it to try to figure it out we just read the book that's right amen we just read the book let's go let's start just a little bit now and just read some turn in your Bibles I didn't give them this one to pull up but turn in your Bibles to Revelations we got down to about verse 8 this morning let's go over to Revelations 1:9 and let's just read if they catch up with us we'll have it up there in a minute if they want to we'll go over to verse n and just read a little bit I John who Al who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ all right now as I said that testimony of Jesus Christ is three times in the Book of Revelations the testimony of Jesus is another one that makes it four times that God is talking about and when he writes something to us multiple times it means to pay close attention to that point all right so there it is I'm your brother fellow companion by the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now watch this and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now the voice was saying voice he didn't hear a voice introduce a voice right right right the voice was saying yes huh yes are you are you following me yes see what he heard was the voice right not a voice introducing a voice may be carnal but my point of illustration is why because look a voice saying the voice is saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia to Ephesians what the voice now is in red letter right so we were taught in in uh Baptist Bible school you know that if it was red letter it meant that was God speaking yes right yes I believe it's all God speaking but it emphasizes that it means the the voice of God is speaking to us all right and look look what he say now I love this scripture go watch what he said and I turned to see The Voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks he turned to see The Voice he knew the voice yes right this is John see John knew that voice amen it was not a strange voice that he heard that's right he knew that voice he said and I turned to see The Voice you know what he was expecting to see Jesus amen right now I call down there to you know marks them and if Donny answers the phone I know who that is if Mark answers the phone I know who that is you know why because I've heard that voice yes the voice then and the person is the same yes right it's hard for me to disguise my voice right but most of you have heard it so long until when I call you you know who it is without having to ask who is this you know that's right why because you've heard it yes but by hearing it you know who is speaking to you amen now get the point John knew who was speaking he was expecting to see Jesus when he turned yes right and that's what he saw Yes but he didn't see the physical Lord Jesus standing there that's right so I guess that was a surprise to me because if if you like I said if you were turned away and I say you know brother collie you just he knows who's there amen you know then if he turned around and saw brother Donnie or maybe Brother Gary he do a good job okay and where where's Timbo where's he Timbo can no not Timbo excuse me Tyler Tyler he can he can imitate the biggest Force n he can say went there this is my wife and he said other thing everybody knows who he's talking about or who he's imitating you know but it'd be surprised if he if you turned around and saw him when you know the voice personally that would make a surprise to you so I guess John was surprised when he turned now listen to what I'm saying I don't think John was expecting in any symbolics are you following me what it symbolics is yes when he turned to see The Voice he saw what now being turned i s seven golden candlesticks now he knows there's something about that because I mean you hear a voice of a man and you turn around and there's seven candlesticks and you know the voice came from there all right see then if that voice came from there he knew there was some problem now he he knows it's got to be broke down what that symbol is that's right right see because the symbol has to be interpreted right that's why people don't like the Book of Revelation see because it's in symbolics all right but see the prophet told us what the symbolics were now watch what he said no he saw seven candlesticks watch it we know that he saw and we can cover it we have over and over did he saw the candlesticks would be the church ages you know all right and it would be the messengers to the age right yes yes amen all right everybody understand that's what he knew that would be that what it would be he could understand that but here's what surprised him what and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one L un to the son of man mhm now he's not seeing Jesus yet he knew that was Jesus's voice that's right are you listening yes he knew the voice and he was expecting to see Jesus amen but he didn't see Jesus when he turned that's right the first he sees seven candlesticks when we get over to Revelation where you see that you'll see that Revelation 4 you know a little further where we're at and get over to four and start seeing the throne then he sees one on the throne then he seees people around the throne this unfailing like that we have the uh what you call it overlays you know I always like that in school because I always wondered who draw the body out but I love them things you know where overlays where that you can see a human body all right you know skin and all and you turned one over when you did they took the skin off yeah right then you turn another one over and there you can see the intestines and the heart and everything you know see it was unfolding what you're seeing that's right all right so that's what's taking place now the acts of a play that's right all right so he turns to see and he sees the seven scandles sticks maybe his understanding is that you know it's going to be the church ages and the things okay maybe God revealed that whether he did or not that's okay with me but I'm just saying that was probably what he was showing you but look now here he gets another opening and the Overlake opens up and here he said one La un the son of man notice it didn't say the son of man was standing there that's right it was one liken to the son of man that's right now one like the son of man to me is would be the son of man in another form right you know what we mean to change an imorph Fe yes you see the son of man in another form okay what form did he see him in see like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot he knows the symbolics and G about the PS with a golden girl now he didn't see a male image okay cuz you would not emphasize the P that's right amen he was seeing a female image okay right right heard about the PS I know it where it goes to because it was moved from the center part as a servant down to the times and ages of the the high priest and move up to the shoulders but it would still move to the PS this son of man was standing this one liking of the son of man would be in a female image so who is he seeing why it says one like the son of man don't say the son of man right see he's still in the point that it's got to be revealed to him no matter if a prophet sees something it's got to be revealed to the prophet what that is right all right so now let's get a couple of quotes and just listen to what's being said go ahead to number two on your notes brother and let's see what he's talking about this is uh patas Vision 60204 the even service paragraph 151 now it's the the King James version which you probably have either Scofield or maybe a Thompson Chain or some of them it isn't correct there cuz it says seven candlesticks the correct way is seven l stand right cuz a Candlestick see is it would it would burn out it's a lampstand coming up from the Old Testament you know U and it it's a lampstand cuz they kept pouring the oil in it wouldn't like a candle it just burned out and gone see that's what he's saying see it isn't correct there it does not say candlesticks it says lamp holders lamp stands I believe is the right correct word said in the original translation see in other words these seven golden candlesticks were seven churches all right it goes on describing it what it is being turned I saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of the the middle of the seven lampstands now I know the doctrine years ago and a lot of people had brought it of the Alpha and Omega and they'll say he was in the first church age and he'll be in the last Church age that's the Alpha and Omega but he said he was all the way up and down in between right now you describe that to me and I'd like for you to draw me a picture I'd like for you to draw me seven golden candlesticks and draw me whatever you want to put in the middle but put a feminist form standing in the midst now if it said six you could do it pretty easy that's right right you could just pull them apart that's right right that's right and draw it in the middle but how are you going to get it in 70 so there goes back to Hebrews 13 and8 and what we've been talking about that it was the same holy ghost in every Church age that's right right all right the same holy ghost in every age that's right can put him in the midst of seven golden CLE that's right where it can be in each age now you can comprehend what's being said that's right now so then that's where he's put it at now look to the next one this is the patas vision same message paragraph 257 he's talking about and laid his right hand upon me saying to me fear not fire I am the first of life oh my not a prophet God that's not a prophet back there in Revelation 1 that's God Amen all right that's right God in what another form that's right true this is God you're looking at cuz he goes on down you know into the scripture of verse 16 15 16 sowh he fell at his feet not a Prophet this was God and let's get a little more picture of that go ahead with the number four John does not this is page 49 Church book that John John does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard want you he turned to see the voice that's right amen oh I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word John one he turned to see John does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard right so by now see you'll see that he's catching on that when he turns when he first hears the voice he's thinking I'm going to see Jesus when I turn around right right but that's not the way that it done it see right so when he starts turning he realizes things are appearing that is not Jesus standing there in flesh right no the prophet said he didn't turn does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard that's right but he turned to see the voice that's right amen the voice in the person now he realizes what he's looking at he seven golden candlesticks left holders you know and he sees one like un to the son of man but he realizes that what he's looking at is almighty God Amen right the one he was expecting to begin with to see when he turns now it begins to unfold to him yes where Jesus is at that's right amen now remember at this time on patmas all right the Holy Ghost is already come with the death Pentecost yes and brought it into bride form right right look at the next one now just a few things to get it on your mind uh page 340 lady you see in church AG when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last age there is a again another people in the land people who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's right under their messenger that's right uh we talking about it last night you know and somebody said well we need to go back and do it so higher higher you remember that last night somebody says do that so higher high okay you you know okay so you understand I I'm glad of one thing y'all know I'm crazy but I'm glad of one thing science says that you can put a tape on and listen to it and learn a language while you're sleep I'm glad of that I just wonder how much you can learn but I'm still proud of the fact that that science says it can be done okay all that gives me Comfort you know all right but see under her messenger she will be the final voice yes right but whatever voice was protruding protruding out of the candlesticks was the voice of almighty God Amen all right that's right but he was in another form yes that's the title of this you know put a little second title to everybody the title is what bride form under her messenger she's the final voice to the final age that's right she's the bride form there's not going to be another Voice come down to condemn this age that's right it has done been condemned and under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age all right and who is that then let's go on to the next one seven Church ages 54 512 what one like him so he reading the scripture in the midst of the seven golden cand one like him the son of man look what one like him now he's expressing what I said this is not him standing there in person physically seeing him that's right right one like him that's right now watch what he who was this and he answers it it's the bride that don't need interpreting does it no he just answered he asked the question in other words who is this if one like the son of man he said it's a bride one like him what how it was clo with the Garment down the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right G about the pouch not a man a woman all right the bride of Christ is what he saw all right now watch what I'm say he saw the candlesticks yes he could have got the symbolics and seen the church ages right right amen God could have open to him what that was that's right that that was the church ages that was coming down amen all right that's right now but that wasn't all he showed him that's right he showed him one in the midst of the seven golden C like another son of man he showed him the bride amen the Bride of Jesus Christ all right now just a couple more and we'll get back to preaching a little look at just the next one uh page 52 patas Vision which is church age book there he stands one like unto the son of man now what's the description of this son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge a golden girdle is no longer gir around the waist where the priest must wear as he ministers to God in the holiest place but is now around his shoulders or for he is not now the priest but the judge all right now I thought we believed that we would judge Angels that's right right right right see then the same one you're looking at is one day going to be sitting on the throne that's right judging angels and if it shows now listen if it's showing him in his judge form and we will be sitting on the throne with him so you go over to Daniel we can get into that Revelations get to White throne and see that there's one sitting on the white throne and then there's many sitting with that one amen that's right which is the Bride of Jesus Christ to judge the world that's right all right now then at the time of judgment to those that are sitting on the throne judgment is complete you agree right I mean come on now we know they can do it today you know because of crooked judges but really the judge is supposed to be the final Authority not necessarily today but still he's supposed to be the final Authority amen that's right especially if you go to the Supreme Court and get to the justice and all they're supposed to be the final Authority all right so you understand what I'm saying yes before he shows the church ages and what we are he's already took us in the symbolics yes and brought us even to the white Throne judgment yes the where that we sit on the Judgment with him amen judging everybody else that's right right amen now if that's true how can we F right you know the only way you can fail is to be a failure yourself I don't know where that's the right way to say it but we're the only ones that can mess this up that's right right but if he seen us we're going to be there am amen that's right now if not he have to rewrite the book that's right that's right but he's not going to do it okay one more this is why we're not a denomination 1958 927 paragraph 180 now if you notice in Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing in seven Church ages in the seven Church AG seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one like another son of man standing clothed with a how it was it was a bride standing in the candlesticks draw out amen all right now there's two or three times that he tells us who this is in Revelations one John finally falls down to reading on down in the scriptures he falls down to worship this one that's right and he said see you don't do it and the red letter says I'm the alpha and omega amen I'm the beginning and the end yes but where's he speaking from that's the the key right yes he's speaking from you and I that's right right we're going to be the final voice of this final age there won't be no court of appeal if people turn us down that's right we're not trying to scare nobody that's right it won't work that's right you we were talking this morning about it that there's actually people and that wouldn't want the wording but you know there's actually people there my wife and I coming up the road you know that you can't you can't correct that's amen and brother R says you can't tell that woman that it's wrong for her to wear her shorts and cut her high and time now why and remember that said anointed once in time right or is that no it not it's because she's Anointed with the Holy Spirit right how can you tell these preachers about the land in the message out of the message or whoever that they're wrong about their Doctrine when they are Anointed with even the genuine Holy Spirit that's true is that the prophet's message but now the on that he sees remember there's two churches there's a bride yes right the bride is not just an anointed one that's right sure she has the anointing and that's what she is she is the anointed I mean the anointing so when you go over to Daniel and pick it up and I mean over to Daniel 70 week and pick it up brother around and say we ride back in the Millennium as the anointing to the Temple of people that's our personal church I'm trying to make it but now get what I'm saying the church I'm trying to divide church and bride okay right Milwaukee is on to me all time about when I use the word church but I'm using what brother R says because she likes me to use the word bride which is good you know the bride cuz there's a difference the bride and the church but you know what they're sitting right there together in the church right there together in the age that we're here each age had wise and foolish virgin he said AG had false Vine and True Vine right the bride down Through the Ages is what John is seeing on patas yes he's not seeing the church right right he's not seeing the anointed ones right even though the anointing is a genuine Holy Spirit that's right right dwelling on man's spirit and makes him religious when to go to church signs and wonders taking place but that's not his bride that's right his bride is shown in the midst of the seven golden kind that's right right the church is not shown there that's right the church comes up later in the writing in the book now you might not like this one either but I won't spend much time on the church ages because I don't feel it's necessary to govern each age but I will make this statement when you look in the church age we know that he was speaking to two Vines mhm right yes all right you know looking at that false Vine she's the church she's the anointed one yes right she claims to be the people of God yes and God speaks to her just as well as he speaks to the bride that's right and you read Revelations 2 and 3 because we won't try to cover those we'll go to the Lord willingness coming Wednesday nothing don't come up we'll go over to Revelations 4 so read that cuz I'm not going to spend much time in the church ages because my emphasis today is the point that's right in the church ages you know that what we do let's get a little bit of little bit back there off of some of the other message brother rman invisible Union said you're your name is transferred okay remember that yes right and brother Gary do you realize when the church ages when we started out we was a church come on but when we got born again we become the bride that's right you agree but you started out it's a church that's right under justification and sanctification before you receive the new birth you are a church that's right that's good just like all the other churches that's why Brother D you don't hear me throw off on them people right why because we everyone got our start there that's right amen whether you like it or not whether you ever went to a denominational Church justification and sanctification has to clean out that old thing that's right amen right so read the church ages and you'll see that he's speaking brother says to two Vines but just remember you and I used to be of the wrong Vine that's right right you can believe all you want to about all these seed doctrines and all these things but you still started out lost that's right amen Right started life lost right amen but God saw that God put a seat in me where was it and what was it that's all I've ever asked anybody what it's a word well okay Paul said the letter kth the word that's in an individual will destroy you and I if it's not Quicken and made alive that's right amen all right so we started in the ages so don't feel so bad you know don't look at it wrong oh that old false Vine that's way people are today you know that old denomination out there them old M this Badness and them more Pentecostals just remember whether you agree with it or not you better listen to it amen we started out lost that's right and being lost we was the church amen a religious Society that's right but the new birth makes you the bride of Christ amen right and when you get the new birth you're going to come out of the church that's right that's right so then you name is transferred amen from churchy to bride that's right praise the Lord all right that's why I don't choose to go through the ages I don't think it's necessary to just take the ages and express what they are we should know that if you don't go get your church age book and read it that's right I'm dealing with the symbolics of the things that the prophet is expressing to us to show us what this is yes because to me now listen this Revelations chap 1 goes from Genesis to Revelation okay it picks you and I up as what we was yes and brings us to what we are amen it shows our start as the church amen a religious Society yes amen I say that with words in a religious society and then it shows us transferred amen to show us as the bride of Christ and before he started chapter 2 which would start the church ages read chapter one over and then you'll see that no matter what it says we are and we realize we done that we was that God already said was perfect amen God already showed us at the sitting on the white throne with us because G about the PCH with the golden girl that's going to from the waist to to Servant to to Ministry to the to to the shoulders and I thought we believe that we were the shoulders I thought we believe Isaiah said what upon his shoulders amen and you know his so shoulders is the bride cuz that's where you carry the weight from you know that's the bride of Christ amen Lord so we're looking at oursel as God sees it and what was that one that brother BR gave that a diamond so beautiful and all of this that and the other and he says that's what we are and I said it like I did this morning no matter how bad your children are you don't look back down at them and every time they come in the house don't don't come in my house like that now there's people that have done those things and that's that's true it's your life to live not mine my kids are welcomed in my home no matter what they ever do now I want agree with what they're doing and I let them know in a hurry I don't agree what they're doing and there's certain things I tell them don't bring in here right but they're welcome to come right because they're my children and I count my daughter-in-laws as to be my children count my son-in-laws to be my son he number three you know he number three son some of you come along you going to have to be number three number four I mean number four number five and all like that and Rachel she's number you know she's daughter number two she's got to fit in there because she's adopted we old our she but you see church I'm trying to get us to see what God says about us and for us to quit saying what the world says about us I know I'm a sinner I admit it saved by the grace of God see then that's why I can't look down on nobody else I don't agree with people but still that's human beings do some of the most horrible things that could ever be thought of even a good Baptist would never do things like they do in this message and I say that cuz it's where I come from the Baptist but I remember in the Baptist when they wouldn't let a devil married preacher preach the Baptist church and I'm just 72 years old so that means it's still had to be in the 50s and up into the 60s before they started changing I haveen sit on the Deacon board and the deacons in the Baptist Church is the one that calls the preacher right they go visit him they have a preachers committee but it's always made up of the deacons and they go visit the preacher that was question number one how many times you you been married we did believe a few times but you see now it's just what does it make any difference we're under grace don't make it disgrace right make it the truth of God Amen and walk there in all right are you listening I ain't Turn the Page yet but now listen see it was not a prophet brother emphasized that was shown there so it wouldn't have been brother Bram standing in the seven golden Candlestick see now listen to what I'm saying because this is what I believe when you see the bride of Christ brother brandom is part of the bride of Christ so you get the emphasis of what I'm making he didn't turn and see brother Brandon standing there he turned and saw the bride you know what that put brother Brandon standing there do you understand that language cuz he's part of the body of Christ so when you're dealing with the body of Christ he was part of the body of Christ so when he turns to see The Voice first off he's expecting to see Jesus but when he realizes that he he's not seeing him he begins to see the symbolics and it symbolics his opening up to see the the bride of Christ and then he sees one like under the son of man brother randam was not the son of man that's the first message I preached 1969 in Athens Georgia that was that the first message I preached in a church i t Sunday school and thing but the first message I preached that brother random was not the son of man I still got the notes written in the front of my Bible always transfer them this for the purpose because it was part of what I had back there brother around was telling us who the son of man is the son of man is the word that's why Jesus was called the son of man he was the word made flesh right now what we look at see and naturally it came down to the ages yes but when God is looking at the seven golden candlesticks he's not seeing the church ages now you going to think I'm totally turned around but listen he's not seeing the church ages as described in chapter two and three I give a minute plunder that one because he's not seeing the wrong you listening to me when John turns to see he sees what God sees and he sees the bride right he don't see the wrong that's right or else how could you even speak a son of man okay see you wouldn't even speak a son of Cu there is no I challenge you come and show me there's nobody in the Bible Paul and them didn't use the phrase son of man mhm it was not for them to be used that's right Matthew Mark Luke and John used the phrase because that was what Jesus was amen but Paul and them never mentioned son of man that's right but when brother Brandon starts out in 47 or something he starts out talking about the son of man but he was not that the son of man he was a son of man that God was using he said if he don't come I can't do nothing I'm waiting on him he said and even there's a tape there where that I'm just using his voice right right how close would it get to seeing him but yet he wasn't de son of man but when he goes here to patmas he sees one liken to the son of man right and I believe he saw Paul Iranians Columbo Martin Luther Wesley Pentecost in this day right right he saw this day now he didn't just see this day are you following me he saw the bride down Through the Ages all the way through CU she's always been him amen he is the son of man he said well wait just a minute now you made hurt greater than brother brandham no brother brandham in the body now you you lost that one CU I made that emphasis before I made the statement brother Brandon being part of the Bride of Jesus Christ can be revealed in the Book of Revelation as one lik un to the son of man cuz he's in the body of Christ the body of Christ is no different from the Christ that's right are you following me yes so when John sees what he sees you know what he sees now listen so you don't think oh he crossly said he sees Jesus no I done been through he didn't see him standing there in flesh but he sees Jesus who is almighty God right and he's in Bride form so he sees you and I but he sees all the bride of Christ down through Seven Ages yes but if we had to come forth in the end time if we don't come forth into this word then the son of man can't be brought back again like it was oh but brother Brown that was a Ministry yes right someone had to introduce to on of man right and that's what he was doing am one time brother R said it like that he said that he'd be pointing to the sky at a word born bride the messenger of this age will be pointing to the skies amen see the word born bride thank you Jesus now notice here he shows how perfect we are and writes it before we ever even started the journey a that a beautiful book amen that's right I mean you want to John and Mary live happily ever after my Lord to show us already there and shows us even up as far as the white Throne judgment sitting there with the government Upon Our shoulders sitting on the throne with him now hold on to this one so swaller then he could get down and walk away there wouldn't be no empty Gap you get it he could get down and walk away and reveal himself to somebody else he wanted to because when we go to the marriage supper you know he's going to be there for a while I'm going have to quote scripture brother Rand R said he'd come down through there we'd be sitting at that table and he said he'd wipe away the tears from her eyes that's s marage supper said say Well done th good and faithful service enter into the joys of the Lord but you know what our husband does then before we go on the honeymoon now come on I hope you're thinking spiritual and not carnality that's right he will be in our midst to wipe away the tears from our eyes we will see him he will serve us communion right right you know what he does he just simply steps aside now what are we going to be doing where'd he go where'd he go no maybe we might be having a good old fashion meeting you know and he just steps away and brother brother says and goes and reveals itself to the Jews now that's not the Corporal body so maybe he can stand in the middle of it and still be down there talking to the Jews at the same time okay but you skip my point if he stepped out from our midst it wouldn't leave a vacuum that's right because if you see him you see us amen you know you see the bride you see Christ amen but said when you begin to see the word you're seeing Jesus amen think on these things bride form then he's not left without a form that's right now you want to go back through and all of the things of the voice of the many things I looked at this week and thought well that's all right I won't try to bring it when brother Brandon was talking about the voice he said it's the voice of many ministers carrying the message to the world what God showed John was the bride living upon Earth not just sitting on a white throne but living reality of on Earth and what we're doing and the age that we're living in right showing us how perfect he sees us to be that's right that there's no flaws you said what I just got some many problem well okay let's see if you believe the scripture there was a man one time got hired you know pay a price to curse Israel you remember B old ba paid him to go down and curse Israel well he goes down there and he shows God theer parts now that's the words that use there but you going to have interpret that you know where the hinder Parts the worst Parts you can see right and what does God say that bam is calling God there look at what they're doing you see what they're doing down there they're making golden C they're dancing around them they all in this that is doing like everything in the world do you see all that he said I can't see him mhm he just sitting there grinning he said I can't see him I B said now you know you can you're omnicient let you know it he said but you don't see what I see brother said he could tell bam you don't hear the shout of the king in the camp bam heard the shou and dancing around the idols but there was a king in theing camp and he couldn't show him that you know what I love to put with that it was really great to understand it brother Brown said if somebody repents of their sins he said even with the gift I have I'm paraphrasing it he said I can't call that out ain't that something why because it's gone yes right it's in to see if it's forgetfulness right so then all that we're doing and all of the problems we've got today is in the sea of his forgetfulness but you mean that would make you think well I can just get by with anything well I just go on and do this or do that cuz I can get by with it you're not even born again when you think like that that's right I A A good anointed one why has it been lost the Christian Life Of The B message Believers you know what I mean to Christian Life right do you know that people used to be so honest and do it and de brother been about man that used to have that little store out there right behind Wade's house well he was gone farming he was gone working you had a little story there you just went in the store and you got what you wanted and you just laid the money down on the counter and nobody getting steal it or either you wrote down sound there I got so and so on this day left it there you know well now you can't even leave nothing laying around you know they going to get in and steal everything they can but that was the days when we lived I told you about when I sold my home uper gu for it my brother offered me $5,000 profit before I even in $5,000 in 1965 was a lot of money he offered me $5,000 profit and I had never signed any paperwork with my brother that or my nephew that I sold it to I not signed any paperwork I just give him a word and even my nephew said just give me high for the money and you take half of it and we'll let him H the place I said no Terry can't do it I said my word ain't worth $5,000 it ain't worth nothing right you got my word see that's where I want to be how much more does God want us to believe his word right think on these things what form is God in today from Calvary he went up you know went down up paid the price come back on the de P he's been in Bride form now for 2,000 years that bride form is the one I'm talking about that's standing there on patas Martin Luther was there just as well as anybody else and the son of man wouldn't even spoke of in his ages but he's part of the word see because he was only seeing the bride he was seeing the church she's busy somewhere else he was seeing the bride the form of God the imorph where he changes his form to live in you and I and you know what people do with you and I is how they're treating God that's not a fear you don't hear me going out bless God you better be careful what you say about me that's right no but it's like I've always said if I sin you got a right to go tell the world I've done wrong you watch the preacher this message you ain't going to tell it to you that way that's right you better watch that you're touching God's anointing if I go out and commit adultery and you put it in the Atlanta Constitution and the journal morning evening both I guess we still going and you put it in the paper and send it around the world you know you're not going to get in trouble with God because I done it that's right I'm the one that's in trouble that's right but if I didn't do it okay and you go tell it that's right you're in trouble with God that's right there is where you touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm the little bride of Christ I hope you understand what I'm trying to drive the Lord willing Wednesday we'll pick up and try to get into Revelations 4 cuz I don't want to get into the church ages I don't think it's necessary to cover each age I think I've made I'll review just a little bit Wednesday to make sure you understand in those Church ages you see the false Vine and the True Vine and you even see the True Vine that's got problems yes but at the end of every age to him that overcometh that's right it's all been taken care of let's stand again anybody have a need before we go into the the communion just to get rid of everything let's just sing brother dick I love him I lovebody out the way and just my Sal you believe it I love I because he love me just now the Bible says that they when they came in and all went through it and said they tered one for another we generally do this at the last of the doing but let's just do it now let's just have a moment of solid prayer if anybody has any need any problem to get rid of Now's the Time to get rid of it because that way then you don't have no problem if you get rid of if you have something you need to get rid of now is the time to do it you know and then we'll just take a time of taring one for another praying one for another all right all mind's clear cuz see it's not how much worthy I am to take the communion there is not one person in this building worthy to take communion all right there's not one person in this world that is worthy to take communion there is a God that has made all True Believers worthy to be able to take it cu no matter how good you think you are that's right the goodness is not County that's right right but the Badness don't make you good either you know we don't emphasize that we emphasize the atonement that's right of Calvary to make us all clean and worthy all right okay let's pray silently before the Lord father we love you we thank you for making us worthy we rest upon you for what you have done for us we love you now as we go through the the furtherment of the communion you just have your way with each one and lead each and every one of us in Jesus name Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do is of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself we're not worthy so examine ourselves and depend upon him right but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we're judged we're chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to T to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose this afternoon to be able to receive it it's unleavened nothing to do any hindrance or problems with it but it represents your body which is your word Lord we just ask you to sanctify the bread under partakers we know this is not your body but in symbol form but we just got through talk talking about how great a symbol really is to see one lik un to the son of man standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks and actually seeing God standing there in Bride form and Lord Jesus we ask you to just bless and sanctify each one with this bread in Jesus name what about when we get there one day and we'll have a married supper be taking communion having a wonderful time you can come by and draw all the tears from her eyes you see Tears in Heaven I didn't think there was anything wrong with being so happy that you cried right you know have you ever seen people that literally just get so happy to till they just start crying you know well there's anything wrong with that I just you know sorrow is not what you're considering you know you're not considering it being sad we're considering the fact that we're D you know what brother rown said he said then we'll look across the table and see one another and realize who made it we see each other and we realize with our old brother so and so you know what does it matter if it's a table 49 mil long if you're able to see all the way to the end of it without s what's the problem what are we worried about you can spend all of your time trying to figure that out instead of accepting it right okay well we're taking their communion remember brother boy and them because they're going up to try to visit Rick there in the jail to see if there's anything you know can be done or whatever that you can say well what did he do what is this I don't know though that's my answer I don't know I understand some things they said they come to probably arrest him about something and and then there was problems but you know I don't know but he could be spacing at least 40 years years or maybe 50 in in jail you know you say well they can't do that well they can you know if they get the cases against you and God's the only one that can handle it and we will be praying for the Lord to help him yes you know and deliver him from those signs just like we pray for the brother over there in Iran you know because you know we want to believe it all right father father we thank you for this wine It's Made for This purpose today that we can take it and we can receive from you and understand that the stimulation of the Revelation into our hearts and lives comes by the blood of Jesus Christ being shed for each one the spirit of God releasing from that blood and can come back upon us uniting us together in you Lord we thank you so we pray that you would just bless this wine make it to be Lord for each and every one of us the things that we need this day we thank thank you for it all and we commit it to you Sanctified and the partakers in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for sometimes I'm desp and rejected and I question oh Father then and I take one more look at calary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by

to go come morning I by the river I me theen green tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight morning amen and amen you think about it what an opportunity that you and I have to understand the things that have been given unto each and every one of us understand the message he said but there things brother R says that's what you're trying to do you're trying to figure out what he's talking about but the problem is you're trying to use the old mentality of organ organiz religion in your minds to figure out what is being said you're trying to do it by what granny said what mama said what daddy said instead of just reading the book and listen I mean was there any trouble with the things I read today that the prophet said for you and I to be able to understand I mean come on just simple language simple Point simple language and believe in it let all again you can be seated if you like while we getting ready we got it's okay it's working everything are let's just read our scripture and go into the foot washing then we go to John the 13th chapter verse 2 in reading our scripture and so for being the ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is cared Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rising from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and WIP them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter sath unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betrayed him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master that washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for
