[2:28] well we ain't trying to run them off
[2:32] trying to do neither one that's they're
[2:34] they're doing but you know they're
[2:37] leaving the Lord willing after we would
[2:39] have kind of like a thing we should have
[2:42] planned it and everybody just forgot it
[2:45] cuz it come up so quick we couldn't had
[2:47] a dinner or something like that
[2:48] but we did get to take them out to eat
[2:50] last night and everything for supper and

[2:55] knowing that we do love them and like I
[2:58] said we we're not trying to run them off
[3:01] we're not trying to win them up we're
[3:03] trying to have the Lord to do his way
[3:06] and what he desires for them to do and
[3:08] he'll work it out it'll it'll do but we
[3:11] certainly have enjoyed the time that
[3:14] we've had with her
[3:16] fellowshipping with us you know so you

[3:22] saying it tonight we'll say it again
[3:24] Sunday morning but make sure you you're
[3:27] not gonna be here something with them
[3:28] that you shake their hand a night and
[3:30] tell them you in Jordan being here
[3:31] because we try to be friendly try to
[3:34] that's one thing they said it was nice
[3:36] about us and I said well we did have
[3:39] been a few places sometimes back years
[3:41] ago when I was at one time I've told you
[3:44] about it and and I actually was the
[3:46] preacher and I shook hands with one
[3:48] person out of the congregation and that
[3:51] was the only one out of the whole thing
[3:52] while I saying I was the preacher you
[3:54] know in the visiting of preacher and all
[3:57] but I came home raising Cain about
[4:00] telling the people to be friendly
[4:02] and that's what we need to be but just
[4:04] tell them how much you appreciate them
[4:06] being with us and and having a good time
[4:08] fellowshipping together and they will be
[4:11] coming back together
[4:12] with us and fellowship you know all
[4:14] right then we'll get into a scripture
[4:16] father we thank you for your grace in
[4:19] your lovin to each and every one of us
[4:21] and we pray that you would just guide us
[4:24] Lord and help us to understand you in
[4:26] your under ways and things of doing Lord
[4:30] and we know without you there is no
[4:32] hopes in any of us but we pray that you
[4:35] would just bless and guide each one be
[4:38] with those that are sick we were really
[4:40] digging our lord and knowing that he's
[4:41] still having problems and just reach
[4:44] down and touch each one there's many
[4:45] among us that are sick many sicknesses
[4:48] and things that Lord we believe your
[4:51] word that by your stripes were healed
[4:53] and we pray that you would just help us
[4:56] to follow there in until it becomes a
[4:59] manifestation we love you and we think
[5:01] you got us now as we read your word you
[5:04] come and speak to our hearts in Jesus
[5:05] name Amen
[5:10] 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified
[5:15] your souls and obeying the truth through
[5:17] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[5:19] Brethren see that you love one another
[5:21] with a pure heart fervently being born
[5:24] again not a corruptible seed but of
[5:27] incorruptible by the Word of
[5:30] and how are you born in by the Word of
[5:33] God which liveth and abideth for ever on
[5:37] so now we'll go over to pick up in our
[5:40] thought into the statue of a perfect man
[5:43] in chapter 2 verse 1 Simon Peter is
[5:47] servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[5:49] them that have obtained like precious
[5:51] faith with us through the righteousness
[5:53] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[5:56] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[5:59] through the knowledge of God and of
[6:01] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[6:03] divine power had given unto us all
[6:08] things that pertain unto life and
[6:10] godliness has it done now through the
[6:13] knowledge of him that have called us to
[6:15] glory and virtue so remember we are
[6:19] called to these all right whereby we are
[6:22] given whereby are given unto us
[6:25] exceeding great and precious promises
[6:27] that by these you might be partakers of
[6:30] the divine nature having escaped the
[6:32] corruption that is in the world through
[6:33] lust and beside this giving all
[6:36] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[6:38] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[6:40] temperance and to temperance patience
[6:42] and to patience godliness and to
[6:44] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[6:47] brotherly kindness charity amen and you
[6:50] may be seated
[6:51] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[6:55] of the word now we didn't give out any
[6:57] new notes tonight because you've had
[7:01] them Sunday so if you got him you got
[7:03] the notes of what we were doing Sunday
[7:06] and they have that in there on the
[7:08] system of doing what now what are we
[7:12] talking about background a little bit
[7:14] especially to you know the new ones
[7:17] that's not been with us and and
[7:18] everything - to not just leave you
[7:21] dangling and wondering we've been
[7:24] speaking for probably now about four
[7:28] months or three or four or five on the
[7:30] stature of a perfect man all right and
[7:34] you'd say well you know I agreed that
[7:36] book in an hour well I wanna read it and
[7:38] look unless but that don't do no good
[7:40] it's whether or not you understand
[7:42] what's being
[7:43] all right and and that's the point
[7:47] and the statue of a perfect man I've
[7:49] tried to get you to see is not just a
[7:52] message of telling us you know this and
[7:55] that or the other about Christianity it
[7:58] goes all the way from the new birth
[8:00] because you've got to like the scripture
[8:04] says do that you know with of like
[8:07] precious faith
[8:08] all right the born-again experience is
[8:11] like precious faith all the way back to
[8:14] the book of Acts all is like precious
[8:16] faith the new birth all right but then
[8:20] the growth development of Christianity
[8:22] was kind of eaten away by you bugs
[8:24] through the dark ages and the things the
[8:27] caterpillar cankerworm and all and it
[8:29] left the church standing on the basis of
[8:32] the new birth in the book I mean in the
[8:36] point of of Luther Wesley and starting
[8:38] over there and but it's I will restore
[8:40] so it was coming forth to bring forth
[8:44] that church again to back to the faith
[8:48] of the fathers all right
[8:50] so it's the statue of a perfect man is
[8:53] the faith of the fathers and it starts
[8:55] by the new birth the Prophet says how
[8:58] faith and be born again and then these
[9:01] are the things that God expects us to
[9:03] add all right so it's not something that
[9:07] we just say well you know well yeah
[9:09] we're Christians would I don't
[9:11] understand brother Dale coughs you know
[9:13] we're Christians we we go to church we
[9:16] do this all right why did your prophet
[9:18] say he said to the Pentecostal people he
[9:23] said that's where you made you biggest
[9:24] mistake he's because you thought you got
[9:27] everything and he said you didn't he
[9:31] said you just come to a place to start
[9:33] all right see because the statue of a
[9:37] perfect man is teaching us a growth
[9:40] development in Christianity it's not to
[9:44] just a good thought or a good message or
[9:46] something the prophet priest it's
[9:48] telling us those things because that's
[9:50] what I've emphasized over and over to
[9:53] you about these things
[9:56] and the Prophet said it's a requirement
[9:58] that we have it this day this time
[10:00] because we believe that the the
[10:03] restoration of the word has come all
[10:07] right
[10:07] and with that restoration of the word it
[10:10] will come to the point that we can see
[10:11] Jesus Christ now in the word you know
[10:15] unveiled unto us and we can walk then
[10:20] into that and what is going to bring a
[10:22] rapture haven't you ever thought about
[10:24] we've been here almost 50 years now just
[10:27] the going of the Prophet I mean what is
[10:29] gonna bring the rapture are we gonna
[10:31] just wire out or what's gonna be you
[10:34] know well I'm waiting on this well okay
[10:37] praise God if that takes place but what
[10:43] if it don't take place well it's the
[10:46] word well there's a lot out there right
[10:48] now this going off the field and going
[10:50] out into the world and back slid that
[10:53] was screaming and hollering for 40 years
[10:55] that they believed every word the
[10:56] prophet said so let's just don't be in
[10:59] that crowd we need to be in the crowd
[11:02] that's fully dedicated no matter what
[11:06] you're looking forward to I don't care
[11:08] what you're expecting I don't care if
[11:11] it's a woman in the White House or if
[11:13] it's return ministries or what it is I
[11:16] don't care what it is if you're
[11:18] expecting I'm trying to be set for where
[11:21] we are right now because that's not
[11:24] going to take place if you and I are not
[11:26] into the word if we're not in the word
[11:29] it's gonna take place and we'll miss it
[11:30] anyway
[11:31] I'm all I'm trying to do is get us to
[11:34] the point that we've got to be as my old
[11:37] faithful saying is what don't go down to
[11:40] the bus depot to try to catch a train
[11:43] now you've heard that for 40 years right
[11:46] you get where the bus is supposed to be
[11:50] so if you say well this is what we're
[11:52] expecting alright be in line be it set
[11:55] for that to to where that we can walk
[11:58] into that and see what's going on all
[12:01] right because see we don't want to think
[12:07] about maybe this day but Hebrews 11 40s
[12:10] is they without us all back behind us
[12:14] cannot be made perfect without us we'll
[12:18] get to that more Sunday into the
[12:21] understanding but church it's in the
[12:26] Bible the day without us could not be
[12:30] made perfect alright they're waiting the
[12:33] Prophet said on you and I well is that
[12:37] true then well all I'm trying to do is
[12:39] just give you a nod to the place to
[12:41] where that we can be fulfilling what
[12:43] they're waiting on what else could we be
[12:46] looking for you regardless of what you
[12:50] call it returns or what you call it
[12:52] anything whatever it be and we've got to
[12:56] be ready see that's all I've ever
[13:00] hollered to screamed at you about and I
[13:02] know it puts you to place it makes
[13:04] people not understand but to get into
[13:08] this situation I've been in four for
[13:10] three or four months and then you tell
[13:11] me I don't understand what brother
[13:13] Dale's talking about well I certainly
[13:15] certainly said it over and over and over
[13:17] enough in the past three or four months
[13:20] you're at least know what I believe
[13:22] about the new birth you ought to know
[13:25] what I believe about the statue of a
[13:27] perfect man you ought to know what I
[13:29] believe and what I'm expecting because I
[13:32] put it in just about every service and
[13:34] everything and if it is true that they
[13:38] without us well you know what they're
[13:41] saying how long right no no no brother
[13:47] Dale I know the message because how long
[13:49] how long is a this sealed you yeah you
[13:52] don't know brother runs message he's the
[13:55] one that tells you how long and he's one
[13:57] it takes you beyond the curtain of time
[13:59] to that group of people over there
[14:00] that's saying how long and that ain't
[14:04] feels seal Jews that he went to see
[14:06] beyond the curtain time and they're
[14:08] saying how long because they're waiting
[14:12] on you and I to come to that place all
[14:14] right now I hope you caught our Sunday I
[14:16] want to repeat this because I want you
[14:19] to see what I believe I believe
[14:23] these virtues our requirement or why
[14:26] would God put it in his word it's
[14:28] required for somebody might not be me or
[14:31] you but it's required for somebody
[14:34] because this is the age of the full
[14:36] requirement of all things to end it all
[14:38] up all right so it's required uh
[14:42] somebody well why can't we believe where
[14:44] those people if not who's going to be
[14:48] yet we're just not putting our
[14:53] confidence and part into listening to
[14:55] what the prophet has to say we're
[14:58] putting it in what we think he said well
[15:02] none that we thinks that don't I won't
[15:05] do no good it'll be what God vindicates
[15:08] you remember what we were talking about
[15:10] this past Sunday you realize if it's
[15:15] right what your prophet had to say
[15:17] that's an odd way of saying it to people
[15:20] and people are claimed to be following
[15:21] the manatees if it's right
[15:23] that's this point that's the plain
[15:25] language to you if it's right do you
[15:28] believe what he taught is the truth
[15:30] within its right so do you believe the
[15:35] Bible that is right so the Bible said
[15:37] without us they cannot be made perfect
[15:39] so now what are you expecting I lived
[15:44] that brother what was his name was it
[15:47] wouldn't brother Theo was it they
[15:49] preached that message anyhow he said the
[15:52] name Jesus and and he took it and he
[15:55] said see if you take us out of Jesus
[15:57] said you just got Jess but to put us
[16:01] into it you got Jesus so that's that's a
[16:04] good thought we need to dwell on Jesus
[16:07] all right now listen do you realize like
[16:10] I said if you believe it I hope the
[16:13] brothers can start with these because
[16:14] they're they don't have no new notes I
[16:16] just left them with these but I didn't
[16:18] explain it to them so I hope they'll
[16:20] follow along with go to number 1 which
[16:23] is statue of a perfect man which is you
[16:26] know paragraph and the main thing is
[16:29] paragraph 354 all right and watch
[16:38] what's what your prophet says but each
[16:42] age God has placed these things into his
[16:44] church and pattered it by showing that
[16:47] each individual has these possesses
[16:50] these qualities and this being when it's
[16:55] completed now listen to what he's saying
[16:57] is the Church of God going to rapture
[17:02] now this that's the church that's the
[17:05] whole that's all the church the bride
[17:08] right all right now look what he says
[17:11] and this being when is completed is a
[17:15] servant of God in the Church of God
[17:18] that's going into rapture you see what I
[17:22] mean now so do you realize that I made
[17:27] the statement Sunday do you realize that
[17:29] if somebody doesn't does not attain unto
[17:33] these virtues and come out to the
[17:36] position to where it's supposed to be
[17:38] there will never be a rapture the
[17:42] rapture is waiting on a group of people
[17:48] no you said well why don't know we'll
[17:52] come on read read some times but read
[17:56] without getting your intellectual
[17:58] thoughts in your mind and get it already
[18:01] figured out before you ever read is that
[18:04] what he said did he say that the church
[18:07] is waiting on these things to be brought
[18:11] into being to bring a rapture all right
[18:18] no then did he say the individual see
[18:24] when he's completed he's gonna be the
[18:27] one to go in the rapture no I've said a
[18:30] lot of things and I know I leave
[18:32] dangling places and things and I'm sorry
[18:34] cuz it like I said if you if you can't
[18:36] go back and listen to the messages and
[18:38] think and listen to what I say then
[18:40] you're just trying to argue points and
[18:42] you've got some petty P the idea of your
[18:43] own so go ahead but listen Lutheran
[18:50] Wesley
[18:51] Azusa Street they did not have these
[18:54] virtues right they didn't have these
[18:59] virtues because they did well the
[19:01] prophet has to preach it to us to the
[19:03] town where he was and why would he say
[19:07] that that's what God is expecting us to
[19:09] have we see Lutheran Westland is going
[19:14] in the rapture yeah they're going to go
[19:16] in a change of the body yeah but they're
[19:21] not going to be the ones standing at the
[19:24] moment of the twinkling of an eye that's
[19:26] what I was trying to get across to you
[19:28] Sunday you couldn't take Martin Luther
[19:33] them put them up here where we are move
[19:35] us back where they are and this thing
[19:38] take place it's waiting on somebody that
[19:45] can come to these isn't if somebody
[19:47] don't come to these verses and it
[19:49] doesn't have to be the one person so
[19:53] Enoch was only one walked off but think
[19:59] about it they wouldn't be no rapture now
[20:03] what's he meaning there wouldn't be a
[20:04] rapture
[20:05] what's he meaning the church going to
[20:08] rapture you've got to have we got to
[20:11] have these virtues to go in out of
[20:13] change at the moment in the twinkling of
[20:15] an eye right Luther and Westland
[20:19] Pentecost
[20:20] didn't have these virtues right because
[20:26] if he did now where's your restoration
[20:27] so you say well I think maybe they may
[20:30] have had it back there they didn't have
[20:32] it why was your prophet call them babies
[20:36] but yet he said they were born-again
[20:38] Christians why would he tell us who the
[20:41] street Pentecostal people their mistake
[20:44] was facto thinking they had everything
[20:46] he said when you just got to the
[20:48] beginning of starting did you say the
[20:51] latter Ryan he said you ain't even had
[20:53] to form a reign yet he was rough on
[20:56] those people but he was telling the
[20:59] truth
[21:02] so you see the Lutheran Western him
[21:05] couldn't come to a place to be changed
[21:08] in a moment weakling life but somebody's
[21:10] going to do that why can't we believe
[21:13] we're part of it if not we floated out
[21:16] all these years for so for no reason
[21:18] whatsoever
[21:19] I'd be like training for war and then
[21:21] sit down and say well y'all go ahead I
[21:24] won't say can wait up but it's not going
[21:29] to be a rapture unless somebody attains
[21:32] to these virtues then I don't think that
[21:38] well then what do you think you got the
[21:40] pulpit
[21:44] men women children whatever if you can
[21:48] express to me what can take us to a
[21:51] change of these bodies the pulpit is
[21:56] open to you
[21:57] women and all we know everything clean
[22:00] for well then we'll let you stand out
[22:02] and from the pulpit or we'll let you
[22:04] write it down on a piece of paper hand
[22:06] it in anything you want to go do you see
[22:10] Church we're getting too old you realize
[22:13] a lot of us sitting in this building
[22:14] today
[22:15] a 10-year period it's gonna be a wipeout
[22:18] of a lot of people here come on and
[22:24] besides in that ten-year period it'd be
[22:27] probably more died than ever that are
[22:29] not an old age they did a lot of us
[22:31] Rolaids here we better start getting
[22:35] concerned right but what about now
[22:42] that's what is waiting the rapture is
[22:46] waiting up on oh no brother Dale we've
[22:49] all preached here I know it and I don't
[22:51] make ridicule nobody what everybody's
[22:54] looking for that life seed everybody
[22:57] looking for that life seat
[22:59] thank God praise God glory hallelujah
[23:03] but I didn't know finding the life seed
[23:06] was gonna make us a change
[23:07] I thought we hadn't got to reading all
[23:10] of it yet I've asked you to read the
[23:13] statue of perfect man how about going on
[23:15] our reading worries
[23:16] about yes and this and this and then it
[23:18] finally comes to a ministry just like
[23:21] Jesus Christ did the Prophet teach you
[23:25] that one they'd have to be a ministry
[23:27] just like Jesus oh that was brother
[23:29] Branham thank God amen glory hallelujah
[23:32] we know that was right but you know he
[23:37] ain't all of it because if it's right
[23:43] according to the scripture says they
[23:44] without us and us means at least to I'm
[23:49] not degrading nobody I'm just trying to
[23:53] be plain to where you listen what is
[23:57] your hope build on what about somebody
[24:02] standing up and telling you there ain't
[24:04] going to be no rap certain less we have
[24:06] these virtues well you know what
[24:07] everybody ought to do there to fall on
[24:11] their knees and start praying for these
[24:13] virtues I asked you to start with I said
[24:20] are you serious about your experience do
[24:24] you know you're born again because the
[24:29] born-again experience is just the
[24:30] beginning of the statue of a perfect man
[24:33] of faith the new birth it's just the
[24:37] beginning I serious are we what was the
[24:42] next one that we brought go ahead
[24:43] Russian
[24:44] paragraph 367 and once you get it these
[24:50] people who died in here are depending
[24:53] and waiting on us so this church has got
[24:58] to come to perfection in order to bring
[25:03] the resurrection no any time do you need
[25:09] for us to read that what did he say
[25:14] they're depending and waiting on us so
[25:17] this church has got to come to
[25:20] perfection we're still arguing over five
[25:26] Matthew 5:48 what being perfect means
[25:29] well I think it means you I think it
[25:32] means that and I'll tell you up front
[25:34] Matthew 5:48 has nothing to do with the
[25:37] fact or trying to have bad good you are
[25:45] it doesn't have anything to do how good
[25:48] you are
[25:50] we'll get to that wing and finishing the
[25:53] message but listen and they're listened
[25:57] and they're under souls under the altar
[26:00] waiting for this church to come to its
[26:03] perfection that when Christ does come in
[26:07] this church you see is coming smaller in
[26:11] the minority pyramid coming up right
[26:13] refers to the chart board drawing it's a
[26:16] whole lot sharper than that but just
[26:18] like to write that cross Darcy it's come
[26:22] up to a needle point until the church in
[26:25] the minority has got to get into a place
[26:29] until it's the same kind of ministry
[26:32] that lists left because when this
[26:35] headstone comes what Liam got up to the
[26:41] headstone talking about it yet how but
[26:44] now we're saying that's what I say in
[26:46] Sunday was weren't you listening
[26:47] I figured somebody nailed my hide when I
[26:50] went outside are you trying to say
[26:52] there's nothing to be no rapture not
[26:54] these virtues that's what the Prophet
[26:56] said are you going to say they ain't
[26:58] gonna be no resurrection without
[26:59] somebody with these verse what's your
[27:01] prophet said have I become your enemy
[27:05] because I tell you the truth I've tried
[27:11] my best to get the truth to all of us to
[27:13] look at it if the prophet said its
[27:17] requirement then alright let's get at it
[27:21] alright then we come to the basin and
[27:24] said okay now if it's necessary we have
[27:27] these virtues how do we get them
[27:34] tribulation worketh patience so take my
[27:36] belt out come on look line up I don't
[27:39] think that's what it's talking about
[27:43] see that's that word definition things
[27:47] that we read and that's what I've tried
[27:50] to get you to see about the stature of a
[27:51] perfect man virtue the Prophet said is
[27:57] not to live a virgin life you know to be
[28:01] a virgin he's given us Holy Ghost
[28:06] revelation understanding of what the
[28:09] meaning of the word virtue is it's not
[28:11] to just try to be a know you know to be
[28:16] a virgin he says that's not what it is
[28:18] in this case he says he said that's
[28:21] nothing then we got on over to
[28:23] temperance on the last message and what
[28:27] about temperance temperance he said is
[28:31] not just stop drinking alcohol he said
[28:34] not in this case
[28:36] another what I liked is what he said in
[28:39] it he didn't just say the controlling
[28:41] temper he said to controlling that
[28:42] tattling tongue you need to read that
[28:45] again he said to control that tattling
[28:49] tongue what's tattling tongue got to do
[28:52] with difference it must have something
[28:59] to do with it because he's the one who
[29:01] said it you need to reread it again
[29:06] what you see we take words and try to
[29:09] understand a prophet is giving you by
[29:11] revelation what the meaning of those
[29:13] words are irregardless of how they
[29:16] spelled and our natural way of
[29:20] understanding it the natural way of
[29:24] understanding virtue is a virgin our
[29:27] natural way of understanding temperance
[29:29] is to not drink alcohol and in the
[29:33] statute of perfect man the Prophet says
[29:35] that has nothing to do with it where do
[29:40] we get it maybe Sunday when we get up
[29:42] there to where the Prophet said we've
[29:43] come all this way ain't got to holding
[29:44] those yet we got a long ways but trying
[29:53] to get us to the place to work
[29:56] what the Prophet says is what it is he's
[30:04] the one that says it right - how
[30:05] temperance and the things What did he
[30:11] say let's see
[30:12] temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[30:16] alcohol here either in other words here
[30:19] in this message either
[30:23] it's the that's getting the glasses
[30:32] temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[30:34] alcohol here either no no temperance
[30:36] doesn't mean alcohol cure not in this
[30:39] case this is Bible temperance holy
[30:42] spirit temperance that's just one of the
[30:45] lusts of the flesh we're talking about
[30:48] Holy Spirit temperance see we don't need
[30:50] temperance of the natural I the new
[30:54] birth order took care of the alcohol
[30:57] right the new birth in the Baptist or -
[31:01] took care of drinking alcohol you see
[31:04] well I had a new burden the Baptist but
[31:06] I still drink I don't I ain't going
[31:08] arguing I won't just say that ain't
[31:10] according to Bible terminology Bible
[31:13] terminology don't not even be thought of
[31:15] like that Bible terminology or to be to
[31:17] the point that when the Holy Ghost comes
[31:19] in the devil goes out if the devil goes
[31:21] out his liquor goes with him well we
[31:25] didn't know it was wrong car come on
[31:27] don't be silly with me I'm too old I'm
[31:31] 78 years old that don't I don't make no
[31:33] sense for me to say we didn't understand
[31:35] it was wrong
[31:36] you didn't understand it was wrong to
[31:38] commit adultery when you had the new
[31:40] birth in the Baptist or Patera
[31:44] Presbyterian or Pentecostals I'm just
[31:48] gonna tell it to where it is we didn't
[31:49] have it that's the reason we had trouble
[31:52] with things is that solved it enough I'm
[31:56] playing I know it but I ain't gonna play
[31:59] ain't gonna be no blood on my hands
[32:01] wouldn't we get out of here you ain't
[32:04] gonna be what brother Dale didn't tell
[32:05] us yeah it's gonna be I'm gonna tell ya
[32:09] care what it calls it scopes my life so
[32:13] far so I'm gonna put it on it
[32:16] you see Church why would the Bible why
[32:21] would it be a statue of a perfect man if
[32:24] that was not the key to it all
[32:26] and what is your prophet say on the
[32:28] stache on about the statue of a perfect
[32:31] man on 327 Church age book this
[32:33] messenger Malachi for Luke 17 32 do two
[32:36] things
[32:36] turn the hearts of the children back to
[32:38] the faith of the Father and reveal the
[32:42] seven thunders which is a revelation
[32:43] contained in the seven seals and it'll
[32:45] be these divinely revealed mystery truth
[32:47] that literally turn us back so you want
[32:49] to be turned back to the faith of the
[32:50] father we got to get into the seal the
[32:54] thunders we don't need to know this
[32:56] underscores we might get confused and
[32:59] only the Prophet you watch the thunders
[33:00] work that's how great we go when he was
[33:04] out there 1963 everybody said that was
[33:07] the coming of the Lord
[33:08] well there was only one man in the world
[33:09] and understood the coming of the Lord in
[33:11] 63 and that was brother Branham out in
[33:15] the desert nobody else understood it so
[33:19] if that was the coming of the Lord then
[33:21] you missed it come on why don't we get
[33:28] playing people say well the Lord come to
[33:30] 63 Lord come to 63
[33:32] where's he at that's what they told me
[33:37] when the first coming the message said
[33:39] you can't be saved because the
[33:40] redemption was over to 63 that's what
[33:45] your preachers preach it you know what I
[33:47] told I said according to my Bible and
[33:49] the Prophet I've studied so far on as
[33:51] much as I can I come to find out that
[33:53] Redemption was old for the Foundation's
[33:55] world so they kind of knew whether of
[33:58] the Prophet was in 63 in Arizona why did
[34:01] they attack that so much why did they
[34:04] attack him as being at the wrong date
[34:06] because if they can destroy the wrong
[34:08] date they can destroy what God done in
[34:10] Arizona to start him and what did he do
[34:13] there come on you show me I'll show you
[34:16] what he said you showed me where
[34:18] anything was told him in Arizona because
[34:22] you're gonna have to buy
[34:23] the one quote I'm gonna bring where the
[34:26] angel told him should go back to
[34:27] Jeffersonville those angels said it'll
[34:30] be told you what to do ix our he come
[34:34] back to Jeffersonville he said I don't
[34:37] know what the first seal is did the
[34:39] Angels tell him out there what the first
[34:40] seal was if they did and he come back
[34:43] he's a liar and we're fun too were found
[34:45] following a false prophet no in the
[34:49] knife three got to steal number one he
[34:51] said I don't know what steal number two
[34:52] hit but he knew everything no he didn't
[34:56] know everything he did he lied you can't
[35:01] go that away I'm sorry I'm just -
[35:04] blowing I know it that's maybe I need to
[35:09] get me a greeters at Walmart you know
[35:15] what I mean by that I have what we make
[35:18] a living and forget it no I can't do it
[35:22] the code I done spent my life fighting
[35:25] for this thing and ain't nothing gonna
[35:27] keep me from going with it because it's
[35:31] in him anyway if not in me all right
[35:33] listen
[35:36] he goes to blasphemous names and starts
[35:40] talking about
[35:41] temperance and he says there's two
[35:44] different kinds of faith there's two
[35:45] different kinds of virtue two different
[35:47] kinds of knowledge two different kind of
[35:49] temperance and he said now that's the
[35:52] same point is right here see one thinks
[35:55] it's prohibition but that ain't the kind
[35:58] of temperance that God is talking about
[36:01] it's that uncontrolled ungodly
[36:05] uncontrollable temper you got in things
[36:12] and that's what he said about what you
[36:17] see that's where you you're not gonna
[36:19] take what he says one way or the other
[36:21] somewhere down the line we're gonna fall
[36:23] off right because we can't keep going
[36:27] now I'm trying to tell you what's
[36:29] happening and you're not gonna listen to
[36:31] it and you're not gonna take it to heart
[36:33] all these years all them people falling
[36:36] away they had to
[36:37] come up to be somewhere before they
[36:39] could fall because the Bible says that
[36:41] that they'll come a falling away well
[36:43] you can't fall off the house until you
[36:45] get on top of it all right so you can
[36:48] see all these years at all them people
[36:49] spent coming to the message and
[36:51] hollering about it and believe in it and
[36:53] spending their money and doing and
[36:55] traveling the world in it and look at
[36:57] him now
[36:58] falling away why because things didn't
[37:04] go the way they thought it ought to go
[37:08] that right you tell me any other good
[37:12] answer to it things didn't go the way
[37:14] they didn't they wanted it to go on it
[37:19] they fell away well what do you think is
[37:24] gonna happen to the rest of us yeah I'm
[37:32] sorry Church I'm not sorry for the truth
[37:36] I'm just sorry for the fact that I've
[37:38] tried to screamed and hollered and I
[37:40] don't I don't mean to say I don't get
[37:43] respect now that's because this man
[37:45] don't need no respect this man has
[37:48] always walked on his own when others
[37:52] went after all the other doctrines and
[37:54] I'm telling you plain you come and let's
[37:56] talk I had the opportunity to go and be
[37:59] with these doctrines the toothed old man
[38:02] invited me to come to his church I said
[38:04] I can't come I got a job I have to work
[38:07] for a living but I said there's one
[38:09] thing for certain I don't see what
[38:11] you're talking about and but I'm not
[38:14] saying you're wrong I'm just saying I
[38:16] don't see it so you pray for me and I'll
[38:18] pray for you I had to change to be in
[38:21] all of those things but now I've walked
[38:24] alone on one thing this message is right
[38:27] I don't care what we think about it if I
[38:30] miss it and die and go to hell
[38:32] I'll be in Hell happy about it because
[38:34] I'll know for sure this message is right
[38:38] they don't have to be interpreted it
[38:40] don't have to have nobody to pick it up
[38:42] and prop it up or do anything with it
[38:44] it's right
[38:46] if we ever get that settled in when the
[38:48] Prophet said something we won't argue
[38:51] about what he's saying you know what I
[38:54] mean we won't take our own concepts and
[38:56] thoughts he said they're two different
[39:00] kind of faith he said one of the nature
[39:04] given to never kind of virtue knowledge
[39:07] temperance patience no the one of them
[39:12] is natural things there's good people in
[39:17] this world you work with somebody around
[39:19] somebody something and you know they're
[39:21] just as nice as they can be just make us
[39:23] blo ashamed of ourselves for being nice
[39:27] right but there's two different kind one
[39:35] of them is the nature given the other
[39:36] one is a Holy Ghost given by the new
[39:38] birth but listen after he comes to
[39:47] virtue knowledge temperance I want to
[39:51] get this little bit until night anyway
[39:53] he comes to patience faith virtue
[39:59] knowledge temperance patience now what
[40:03] is patience well that's just being
[40:08] patient nice that's good I mean that's
[40:10] that's a commendable straight answer but
[40:13] what is patience that's to believe
[40:19] guards when it's all when it's
[40:21] impossible to be ever to be true that's
[40:24] the best way I can say it is to believe
[40:26] God to know that it'll take place when
[40:28] it's totally impossible
[40:30] we know it's impossible there's no way
[40:31] it could ever be the way we've got it
[40:33] figured out but yet God can take care of
[40:37] him and what did brethren say the first
[40:39] patience would need
[40:40] he said patience with God right he said
[40:45] when God tells us something and we wait
[40:48] on it I believe this message is the word
[40:54] of God
[40:57] right I believe this message is God's
[41:01] Word all right and I believe this
[41:03] message is telling us what God wants us
[41:06] to know about ourselves so we put it all
[41:11] on knowing about God and that's good but
[41:16] then he turns around and puts it all
[41:18] back trying to get us to see who we are
[41:27] what you see you try to preach something
[41:29] and people to just sign up on it and if
[41:31] they don't understand it and they well I
[41:33] just can't understand what he's talking
[41:34] about why talking today with somebody
[41:40] about why is it so much in the Bible
[41:45] about the son of man when the Prophet
[41:52] said even Jesus never called himself son
[41:54] of God so he called herself son of man
[41:56] now there is one quote come on I can
[41:59] quote we there is one quote where he
[42:01] talks about him call so you say he never
[42:03] called himself son of God
[42:04] Cinci right there he did but the major
[42:08] of son of man is what it is why do you
[42:13] know what a son of man means you realize
[42:20] son of man means the Word of God made
[42:23] flesh that's the son of man it has a
[42:30] greater meaning than that brother
[42:35] Branham was not the son of man he was a
[42:38] son of man revealing the Son of Man the
[42:41] Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ but
[42:43] when Christ comes into his church - now
[42:46] I'll use this word perfect until Sunday
[42:48] when he comes into his church in perfect
[42:51] form or complete brother Branham calls
[42:54] the bride the son of man the Bible calls
[43:00] earthy Son of Man if you don't believe
[43:02] it go in revelation 1 and read it one
[43:04] standing in the midst of the seven
[43:05] golden candlesticks like unto the Son of
[43:07] Man Girt about the paps for the golden
[43:09] girdle
[43:10] he said that ain't no fit no masculine
[43:12] man that's a feminist he said that's a
[43:14] bride of Jesus Christ but you know what
[43:19] I've been trying to have patience with
[43:20] people to get them to see do you know
[43:23] that when I first preached this bride of
[43:25] Jesus Christ would be the word made
[43:28] flesh in the end time was in 1969 in
[43:33] Athens Georgia it's what I thought the
[43:38] first sermon I preached in this mess I
[43:40] still got the notes in my Bible you say
[43:45] you've been sarcastic no telling the
[43:47] truth because God showed me the quotes
[43:53] of the Prophet that the bride would be
[43:55] the word made flesh Jesus Christ was not
[43:58] a second person he was not a son of man
[44:02] Jesus Christ was the son of man right
[44:07] the bride is not to be a son of man she
[44:13] is to be the son of man made word flesh
[44:15] in this day that's what's going to bring
[44:17] a change could you think I'm just
[44:21] playing with the word because listen
[44:25] they ain't gonna be a rapture unless
[44:29] somebody has gets these virtues did you
[44:31] follow that one what did you follow the
[44:34] next one that the Prophet said no
[44:40] resurrection remember that without these
[44:46] virtues there'll be no resurrection why
[44:49] because according to my Bible the dead
[44:52] in Christ shall rise first and we which
[44:54] are alive and remain she'll be changed
[44:57] in a moment of twinkling high so we're
[44:59] not looking for a rapture right now
[45:01] we're looking for a resurrection why is
[45:09] it that your prophet would stand at a
[45:14] situation a position and he said bring
[45:18] me what was it 24 was it 24 cases
[45:22] was it 14 bring me in 24 I thought he
[45:25] said bring me 24 your worst cases and he
[45:29] said I'll guarantee you healing for them
[45:32] all now who could stand in that place
[45:37] ain't no need of you thinking you can
[45:40] and I sure flat ain't thinking about
[45:41] being it cuz it ain't gonna work with me
[45:43] and I ain't even gonna try it you know
[45:50] what I found out by listening that was
[45:53] in the early part of brother Brendan's
[45:55] ministry that he was trying to nail that
[45:58] thing down and that's why he said it
[46:01] God gave him the right to say it because
[46:05] it was nailing down his ministry putting
[46:08] it perfectly in order for the scripture
[46:13] do you know what son of man really is I
[46:17] come on church I'm sorry we studied this
[46:23] in the Baptist Church the son of man is
[46:30] the resurrection the son of man is the
[46:39] resurrection that's why brother Branham
[46:41] could stand and say God guarantee you
[46:43] healing
[46:45] there was nothing could stand before
[46:48] that man that God told him to speak it
[46:50] you agree why because I was the
[46:55] resurrection why did they have to go
[47:00] forth as a healing campaign according to
[47:05] Mel Akkad had to be the son of
[47:07] righteousness rising here in his wing it
[47:09] went for it with a healing campaign why
[47:12] because the son of man the Lord Jesus
[47:15] Christ came to visit you and I to a
[47:23] little man called William Branham the
[47:27] difference between him was the flesh now
[47:30] that's the best for him to say it
[47:32] the difference was the flesh
[47:35] because he his flesh was not perfect or
[47:39] complete it wasn't virgin-born it
[47:42] wouldn't work and even the Lord Jesus
[47:46] Christ himself
[47:47] the son of man his body had to be
[47:49] redeemed but not because it was sinful
[47:52] but because it had a beginning
[47:55] come on Church I'm sorry what was you at
[48:00] you said well brother Lu you've talked
[48:03] about these things of the Son of Man
[48:05] back in 69 come on church a dis come out
[48:09] of the bad mister we've we taught the
[48:11] son of man is the resurrection that is
[48:13] it you want to get in the Bible and take
[48:15] the son of man and just go scripture
[48:17] after scripture after scripture you see
[48:20] that the Lord Jesus Christ was the son
[48:23] of man and he had the resurrection he
[48:29] saw week what did he say
[48:31] he said I am the resurrection and the
[48:36] life no brother Branham couldn't say
[48:40] that because he wasn't the resurrection
[48:45] and the life but he had the authority to
[48:48] use the name and he would stand there
[48:53] sell guarantee you healing because he
[48:59] had contact with their son of man do you
[49:04] see what I'm talking about
[49:05] without these virtues there's not going
[49:08] to be a resurrection because you're not
[49:11] gonna come to the Son of man
[49:18] anytime you want to sit down and read a
[49:20] while save and just run ups on a man in
[49:24] the computer just run it up they won't
[49:35] go that far
[49:38] anytime you want it you come to me and
[49:40] we'll shut down the run I'll let you
[49:43] just take my Bible and write down
[49:45] because I wrote them down along that b69
[49:48] how many years is that for next year
[49:53] would be 40 years 50 year next year will
[49:56] be 50 years and I could I said was the
[49:59] first sermon I preached in 1969 or the
[50:07] Mansfield went some words and wanted me
[50:09] to minister because I saw then what it
[50:16] was see the resurrection I thought now
[50:20] come on now listen am i quoting brother
[50:22] Branham where's the resurrection and
[50:26] thank you sister
[50:29] she said it's in here I thought that's
[50:33] where the Prophet said it was a he said
[50:35] the resurrection is inside of you in
[50:36] your spirit
[50:37] now that's not in your human reasoning
[50:39] memory conscious affection no it's in
[50:41] the Holy Spirit that's inside of you
[50:46] your resurrection is inside of you all
[50:50] it's doing is waiting on us to come to
[50:52] the basis that we can believe it that we
[50:57] can speak it and move forward but we've
[51:02] had to have patience we'll get to it
[51:04] when we get on to the next messenger so
[51:06] we're brethren said they said to him
[51:08] said how can you do it brother Branham
[51:10] how can you put up with this need nine
[51:13] too few of the big church name Joe he
[51:16] said faith to believe that it's in their
[51:24] heart and patience virtue and not to
[51:29] believe that it's in their heart
[51:30] I have nothing against this people right
[51:33] over here this church sitting there here
[51:34] beside of us I know in their heart and I
[51:45] know that that's the reason the people
[51:47] this message are not going to take the
[51:49] message but really what it is because in
[51:51] their heart they can't see it I mean
[51:58] you're talking to a bunch of baby
[51:59] Pentecostal people for the random was
[52:02] talking to a bunch of babies and he said
[52:05] if they don't understand he said how you
[52:07] going to get it what does that quote if
[52:10] they did in other words if you can't
[52:12] teach them Pentecostal times he said
[52:16] what can you do with the deeper things
[52:17] another word think of all he was doing
[52:21] and he would go to those meetings and
[52:23] cry out and God would come so present
[52:26] until he would just tell him you call it
[52:29] and that's it he's dead over here
[52:33] they'll be dead the healing called it
[52:36] that's the way it'll be and yet he knew
[52:41] standing there they wouldn't nobody
[52:42] seeing what he was talking about
[52:53] what about it do we see what he was
[52:57] talking about that these virtues are
[53:03] required for us to make a change these
[53:07] virtues are required for us to come in a
[53:09] resurrection
[53:18] but are we gonna raise up and and meet
[53:21] the challenge or the hour are we gonna
[53:26] be like everything else cuz there's two
[53:28] ways of going you can slip out the door
[53:30] ain't mean enough to build Endora but I
[53:32] mean you can slip out and go with others
[53:34] and just follow all these lines with all
[53:36] these people you know that's turned
[53:37] against the message now you can go with
[53:41] them and say well I don't know profit he
[53:44] said so-and-so but I don't believe that
[53:47] okay between you and God as to what your
[53:53] answer will be if I told you and you
[54:03] believed it you know you really believed
[54:06] me and I told you tonight I want to give
[54:09] everybody in this building a million
[54:11] dollars and I want to meet you at the
[54:16] bank tomorrow at ten o'clock
[54:23] Thomas Becker just dying laughing
[54:26] because he knows where he'd be at ten
[54:29] o'clock he wouldn't be sitting listening
[54:32] to a teacher cause his mom and daddy
[54:36] would be sitting at the bank and he'd
[54:39] have a perfect right to being out of
[54:40] school that day a million dollars worth
[54:46] let's see you know for certain that if I
[54:50] told you that I would have to have that
[54:53] back up to do it or I wouldn't tell you
[54:55] right but you know true that if I told
[54:58] you it'd be there you got that much
[55:02] confidence in me as a human being that I
[55:05] would do all I could well how much more
[55:08] confidence should we have in God who has
[55:12] given us everything there's nothing that
[55:15] we like that's why I keep emphasizing
[55:18] 3:27 church age book he's give us the
[55:21] way to come to the stature of a perfect
[55:23] man because it'd be these two finally
[55:27] reveal mystery truth that literally
[55:29] turns back
[55:32] but people don't want to read nothing
[55:34] about the thunders or the the seals or
[55:36] the 70 weeks of Daniel or this that it
[55:38] is no they don't they're afraid of it
[55:41] what are you afraid of well I don't
[55:46] understand it well that's no problem
[55:50] but if you won't make it available and
[55:52] they're a big problem at least we could
[55:58] read a lot no problem with people that
[56:02] are well read because there's one thing
[56:04] for certain when I make a quote I can
[56:07] look at your face and tell whether or
[56:09] not you've ever read that because your
[56:13] face will turn you know you're green or
[56:15] something you said yeah I've read that
[56:17] well thank God what do you see
[56:26] God made a requirement for us to have
[56:29] these virtues it has to be made away
[56:31] where we can receive it it's hard for me
[56:39] to stay away cuz I got the notes laying
[56:41] there it was hard for me to stay away
[56:42] from gardening and so study that one
[56:44] first
[56:45] till Sunday just read what the Prophet
[56:48] talks about godliness to be like God and
[56:56] what about him he said I looked and
[56:58] listened he was looking for something he
[57:02] said I looked and four or five or
[57:03] something like that dictionaries and
[57:05] said cut and find the definition of to
[57:09] be like God what it meant
[57:11] he said that down his brother sewing
[57:13] souls and we got this Dixon or out and
[57:14] said it said to be like God godliness is
[57:18] to be like God well you know he knew
[57:20] that he knew that for he picked up the
[57:23] first Webster but he couldn't find the
[57:28] wordings are you listening
[57:31] he knew virtue meant the natural meaning
[57:36] of the word virtue means to be a virgin
[57:39] the natural meaning of temperance means
[57:42] to not alcoholic
[57:45] didn't use that he said that's not in
[57:48] this case and see to be like God
[57:58] well it just means to be like God but
[58:02] what does that mean what does it mean to
[58:06] be like God
[58:07] well you just act like him no the
[58:11] Antichrist does that you don't act like
[58:15] him devil knows better than that it
[58:19] ain't acting like God it's being God the
[58:23] other we can't be God you making it
[58:25] worse we read in the Bible that sons of
[58:32] gods was God in the Baptist Church and
[58:36] believe that where was you that what was
[58:41] you doing oh he was putting all this out
[58:43] boy hallelujah we was running with who's
[58:44] doing you out and then you just kept
[58:45] running kept doing the prophet called
[58:47] you babies you don't listen he said
[58:52] you've been leaving Baptists alone now
[58:55] you need that quote I don't mean it to
[58:57] be sarcastic I mean it's what he said it
[58:59] he said you better leave him alone he
[59:01] said cuz they know that word see we just
[59:04] couldn't get it together we was the
[59:06] people that had the money in the bank
[59:08] right you remember the story what's the
[59:12] difference in the Pentecost from the
[59:13] other he said one of us got the money in
[59:15] the bank but Cain try to shed got some
[59:17] bad news he don't know worried that how
[59:19] to handle it
[59:20] Pentecostals don't have no money to bite
[59:22] which they've got all the shout and
[59:24] glory hallelujah
[59:25] he said neither one undried let's see we
[59:30] studied a lot of things I can remember
[59:33] right now and then brought it up one day
[59:35] and he said you ever noticed where it
[59:37] says the way go home tonight and just
[59:39] type into your computer and see how many
[59:42] times it speaks of Jesus Christ and
[59:44] being the way the way just the way he
[59:51] said I'm the way the truth and the life
[59:53] just look at how many times it says the
[59:55] way I remember when that man said that
[59:58] I'll never wear Sunday School class
[1:00:00] but I thought hey I've read a little bit
[1:00:03] I know he's dry I can find a lot of
[1:00:07] words are but you see Church that was my
[1:00:15] background the were when the message
[1:00:20] came I didn't have to throw down all of
[1:00:23] these things I just walked right into
[1:00:26] the message he willing you this and I've
[1:00:32] told you my whole story and you won't
[1:00:34] listen because he you won't listen to
[1:00:36] the rest of what I've said to order to
[1:00:38] show that out is what I said was right
[1:00:40] because he I was two years in this
[1:00:41] message for I received the baptism in
[1:00:44] the Holy Ghost I've told you that for 44
[1:00:47] almost fifty years now I didn't come in
[1:00:50] this message claiming that I had the
[1:00:52] Holy Ghost God I believe the Prophet if
[1:00:55] you do that be careful there's plenty of
[1:00:58] them on these youtube sometimes it's out
[1:01:00] there or what they've got all these
[1:01:01] things there's plenty of them that said
[1:01:03] I've got the Holy Ghost coat I believe
[1:01:05] the Prophet and a lot of them ain't here
[1:01:08] today don't put it on something that
[1:01:16] Satan can impersonate like the brother
[1:01:24] said today he and George something I
[1:01:25] said to him because what we were talking
[1:01:27] about was a simple little point you said
[1:01:32] well I haven't felt the presence of the
[1:01:33] Lord in months I just feel like I'm back
[1:01:36] slid ain't gonna ask for a raise of
[1:01:40] hands I'm gonna put mine up both of them
[1:01:43] because that's pretty well where I stay
[1:01:45] how about you I ain't asking you to
[1:01:48] raise your hand I'm just asking to be
[1:01:50] truthful I stay at that place being
[1:01:52] brother Gary Atkins used to life and
[1:01:54] talked a lot about an old brother Gary
[1:01:56] he said that one thing about it brother
[1:01:57] Dale we don't fit no one knowing it ones
[1:02:01] that's true we don't fit in that
[1:02:04] category or know anyone go in too much
[1:02:06] anointed
[1:02:09] I preach Sunday after Sunday and
[1:02:12] sometimes I go munch without feeling the
[1:02:15] presence of God praying crying out to
[1:02:19] him to give me something but he's never
[1:02:21] failed to give me a message he's never
[1:02:24] failed to meet me when I ask him he's
[1:02:29] never failed to heal when I really got
[1:02:31] serious about that point of thinking
[1:02:34] he's never failed well which one you
[1:02:37] draw the high you draw the house the
[1:02:40] ceiling that Satan can impersonate and
[1:02:43] we all love the presence of the Lord
[1:02:45] come on I can talk to you about smelling
[1:02:48] God's presence I can talk to you about
[1:02:51] seeing God and I can talk to you about
[1:02:53] all of them things
[1:02:54] because it's in my experience but you
[1:02:56] know what there's none of that that's
[1:02:59] one time when I see this and this come
[1:03:07] together this message in the Bible
[1:03:11] because I didn't throw down the Bible
[1:03:14] want to come into message that's what a
[1:03:19] lot of people's doing that's where the
[1:03:20] trouble and see now they've gone back a
[1:03:22] lot of going back to the Bible and
[1:03:24] throwed the message town I didn't have
[1:03:27] to do that it's been the Lord all the
[1:03:31] time down through there he's always
[1:03:33] guided me and he promised me and he's
[1:03:36] took care of me well which one you draw
[1:03:38] the high oh the anointing of the feeling
[1:03:41] of God's presence or him speak to you
[1:03:44] about his word which one do you want
[1:03:52] well you can call it and you say all you
[1:03:55] want to about this award but remember
[1:03:57] one time you want to talk about the
[1:04:01] presence of the Lord I can talk to you
[1:04:03] about it I can talk to you when I chased
[1:04:07] him through the house with a pistol
[1:04:08] trying to catch up with him I can talk
[1:04:12] to you about seeing him in the church
[1:04:13] not 11 years old I can talk to you about
[1:04:16] many experiences but see I put none of
[1:04:20] that
[1:04:22] that is my experience of the new birth
[1:04:29] the new birth is the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ personally to you
[1:04:34] that's what brother Moke told me he said
[1:04:37] brother Dale I don't know what you're
[1:04:38] doing I said I don't either for two
[1:04:40] years I saw God every church we went to
[1:04:42] I went to the altar had him to cry and
[1:04:44] praying for me and all but he told me
[1:04:48] one day he said you you everything
[1:04:50] they're looking at something it ain't
[1:04:51] right I'm sorry we bought is it what it
[1:04:53] don't understand
[1:04:54] he said well they've one thing for
[1:04:56] certain the new birth is a birth of the
[1:04:59] word just go to him as the word and
[1:05:02] you'll see the birth of the word come
[1:05:05] forward that was all I needed right
[1:05:09] there my wife and I both received the
[1:05:11] baptism the whole goes right there side
[1:05:12] by side it was the birth of the word
[1:05:18] because I saw him as he was coming all
[1:05:20] the way down through my life
[1:05:22] as he would appear at different places
[1:05:25] in my life you won't talk a little bit
[1:05:29] about you don't talk about a promise
[1:05:30] that he gave of late coming to the Lord
[1:05:32] and how that I asked him for a sign and
[1:05:37] I asked him to give him a deer I asked
[1:05:41] him for said give him something where I
[1:05:44] can talk to him about I had a dream and
[1:05:49] I saw the deer with a foot cut off one
[1:05:53] of them was no cover what you'd call it
[1:05:54] we were at a certain place there's an
[1:05:56] old church there and we were back behind
[1:05:58] it my neighbor even knew about it and we
[1:06:01] were walking around and I said jury I
[1:06:02] said that same footprint was in my dream

[1:06:08] of me he never been that kind of guy he
[1:06:11] went around her and told from the others
[1:06:13] he said Sam had a dream of the day of
[1:06:15] seeing a dear foot and said its back on
[1:06:16] the back of the church I saw it he
[1:06:19] didn't have any trouble and you know

[1:08:14] him for something unusual he said dad
[1:08:17] before we start talking let me tell you
[1:08:19] he said we got to the woods that morning

[1:08:57] talk about the Lord I don't know I'm not
[1:09:00] bragging and I'm just telling you the
[1:09:02] truth
[1:09:02] I like to talk about your experiences of
[1:09:06] what happened in your life is what
[1:09:07] you've seen I believe it because God is
[1:09:09] real but after all of that I'd still
[1:09:14] rather sit down and read his word and
[1:09:18] just be sitting there reading this word
[1:09:20] and I just see it all tie together and
[1:09:24] he's speaking straight to me I'd rather
[1:09:29] have that than all of the glory could
[1:09:33] ever be God in all of the world for
[1:09:35] everything see somebody's going to
[1:09:41] attain you know why because God said it
[1:09:47] you believe the Prophet you believe the
[1:09:49] Bible you believe it alone chain the
[1:09:51] moment wink of an eye you believe the
[1:09:52] Scriptures well then it's got to come to
[1:09:54] Pais why can't we believe we're part of
[1:09:57] it let's then come on come on musician
[1:10:09] we get done a little early and I thought
[1:10:11] it'd be later what we're doing pretty
[1:10:13] good at least his clocks early thang on
[1:10:18] these things somebody has got to
[1:10:22] manifest the Word of God I like that
[1:10:25] little thing that they've made for me
[1:10:26] one day and what's in there on the desk
[1:10:28] where it's talking about the word coming
[1:10:32] forth and it shows you a pilot of a
[1:10:35] Bible and it shows that Bible as it
[1:10:38] comes forth the next stage next stage
[1:10:39] next day then it finally comes up to a
[1:10:41] man standing over here because then the
[1:10:44] word was made flesh and dwelt among us

[1:10:50] that God could speak his word who to
[1:10:54] tell us his mysteries you really realize
[1:10:59] that in that
[1:11:01] you realize that what God was doing
[1:11:04] speaking his mystery to a prophet that
[1:11:11] was his greatest way of doing it because
[1:11:15] we wouldn't believe if he come himself
[1:11:17] started talking straight to us he said
