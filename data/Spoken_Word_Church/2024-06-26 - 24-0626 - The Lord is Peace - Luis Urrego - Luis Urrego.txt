and so it's definitely hard hard to be up here you know after this week's events so but I know it's harder for the family and so you know I love if I could just say that you know I would I would say probably on behalf of all the other ministers here I don't think we would ever be able to fit the shoes of brother Dell take the place of brother Dell I I just he had he was special in his ministry and what God gave him you you know and uh I can definitely say that I was helped a lot by his ministry I don't think that I would be in the place that I would be in now if it wasn't for the word that he preached and he definitely as I was telling brother Wade he definitely loved this messag he loved the prophet and uh and so I have confidence that what we have heard here in the last 40 or so years or the time that you all I know you all have been here longer most of you all that word will take us to the other side amen because it was the word that brother Brandon preached and brother Brandon preached what Paul preached amen so I I I I definitely I'm I'm confident in that amen and I know that each and every one of us continue to serve the God that he served amen we will see him there on that other side amen and it's not it's not it's not a time uh I I don't think he would probably want to come back in the state that he was in and so we're actually rejoicing amen the have that he's graduated amen amen and I I just I'm I'm ready to see him too am amen and so I just ask that you all just pray for the family and continue to keep the family in prayer Nanny needs your support needs needs prayer and and and just support her in whatever way you can amen I know that that that would definitely encourage her amen just put yourself in her shoes what would you what would you want people to do for you you see so so with that uh um I just I just uh just also just want to let you all know we got Brothers all over the world just messaging brother Wade messaging me we got the Saints they're in Central America and Canada they've just been messaging us uh in South America brother brother ner from from Chile he messaged brother brother Fabian Palma they've theyve they send

for sure amen praise the Lord Jesus if if you want to let's go to the word tonight and I I my intention is not to keep you all too long tonight but um you know I I it's it the Lord I felt the Lord just just put on my heart you know brother Brandon preached a message two messages called Shalom and um so we just kind of taking a little bit some pieces from that but U I want to title this tonight the Lord is peace which is what the word shalom means Jehovah Shalom the Lord is peace and then uh a subtitle having the great shalom in times of pain amen so let's turn to Romans 5 1-6 and and if you

your way here tonight help us to receive something that would give us Comfort Lord God we pray we ask your blessings upon these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord let's just read Romans 5 1-6 and then I'll have you be seated it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ because he is our peacegiver amen he is the source of Peace by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us thank God for the holy spirit for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly amen amen praise the Lord you have your seats this evening amen amen the Lord is peace amen the Lord is peace you know we we we we read we read um we we get that that word Shalom from from um I apologize because I'm having to do H this here and this here at the same time so I didn't even scroll the screen while we were reading but there you go we were we read we get the word uh Shalom from from uh from Judges chapter 6 and let's just read this here real quick and and it was Gideon that that that said this in in the scriptures and he it says then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the UNL cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the UNL cakes and the angel of the Lord departed out out of his sight if you remember uh uh Gideon was in a state of fear at the moment he was in a state of turmoil the people uh his people were in the state of of of fear that they were having to fight uh I believe it was the uh the um H forgot the people that were fighting against at the time uh the Philistines I believe and uh and so they were always constantly in a struggle and they were in and Gideon came to a point where he was in fear but the Lord come to Gideon amen and told him amen you're are a mighty man of Valor even though he was in fear even though he was in turmoil in his mind and tribulation he still spoke to him in a peaceful way and told him positive news gave him positive positive things amen because I I I just want to say that sometimes amen that's that's what we need amen we sometimes we don't need a a rebuke amen what we need sometimes is just peaceful words or just to be heard amen just to be listen listen to you know just to have someone to listen to you that just does wonders to you amen the person may not even say anything to you but that is the therapy within itself just listening to somebody amen causes It's a Wonderful therapy within itself cuz you and I can't fix everybody else's problems you and I can't fix the world's problems amen God is the one that gives the solutions amen but but this is this is what Gideon needed and the angel of the Lord came and and and told him this and and and Gideon gave a a fleece a put of fleece before the Lord and and and and and this was one of the the the fleeces that he put before the Lord then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and There Rose up a fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the UNL cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight and when Gideon perceived that he was that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shallal not die amen then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet an Oprah of the aites amen so shalom means Jehovah is peace amen and he is the peace amen when when when we feel like there is no peace he is the the the the the peace that passes all understanding amen and so we we if we can just keep in our mind that nothing happens amen just to happen all has a purpose amen the the the the steps of the righteous man are ordered by the Lord and He Delights in his way amen and so we we we find ourselves in in in in the in in in what we in in what we're in today amen because God deemed it deemed it to be that way amen for whatever reason I he knows we don't know we don't have to know all the details about it amen but as long as he knows amen as long as he is in control amen then we could just rest and have peace and shalone on that amen praise God and and and and sometimes you know we we feel like we we need to explain everything we need you know there's lots of things in the scriptures that we can't explain amen they're there amen even in brother bram's Ministry amen there was things that he couldn't even explain but it happened but as long as God has them in his hands amen as long as God knows all about it amen I want to put my burdens upon him and let him control the the the situations amen praise God and so Saints you know sometimes uh you know Jesus he allows us through to go through painful things amen uh some shame and suffering amen because he knows our expected end if we read in Jeremiah in in Jeremiah CH 29:1 he says I like the way the way he says here he says for I know this is God talking through Jeremiah says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you now think about that he knows know every detail every thought that he's thinking of you from the be from from before you were in the mother's womb when you were an attribute of of his he was already he knew exactly what you were going to go through he knew exactly what brother Dale was going to go through amen Seth the Lord so it's the Lord saying it amen thoughts of what thoughts of Peace thoughts of peace and not of evil so we might think oh my this is happening and this it's evil it's tearing me apart but his thoughts of you are not of evil he just said it my thoughts of you are a peace and not a evil what to give you an expected end in other words an end that he he already knew before the foundation of the world and he mo took you in your life amen to come to the point where you are at now amen and it didn't take him by surprise it might take us by surprise but to him amen nothing takes him by surprise amen because he knows the beginning from the End Amen praise God so he knows all the details of our of our of our lives and everything that you're going to go through every every aspect of your life amen the schools that you're going to go to the the jobs that you're going to work every single thing amen he knows and he's guiding the footsteps of the righteous amen praise God you're not here at this moment amen by just because by accident that's right and nothing that has happened Amen in the last few years has happened by accident it was in the plans of God Amen so uh we can rest on that amen the the lives the events in in our lives that they're not surprises amen but they're expected by God because it's what he's seen it's part of predestination amen praise the Lord Jesus amen Colossians 3:3 tells us this it says for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God now notice what it says it's hid amen how many how many played hide and seek before when we played hideing and seek you know and and it was it was you're hiding and and that person is counting and and you're you're away and you're looking for a place to hide and you get down to a certain place and you know they're not going to find you there eventually they're finding everybody else and then eventually either you're going to have to go run to base or they'll find you right but not with God Amen Satan can't even find amen where you are it's it's it's it's a mystery to him how you are HID in Christ Jesus amen that's the reason why your life is coming to an expected End Amen an end that that he had from from the beginning amen from the foundation of the world why because you are HID in him if you are in him amen praise God and your life is hid with Christ in God Amen so nothing that can happen to you nothing that happened Amen to brother Dale amen was unexpected amen God knew all about it before the foundation of the world Amen and it pleased him amen that he had he he went through that Amen in order to get to where he's at now amen praise the Lord Jesus and I and you know sometimes we think death is terrible and I know it is I've seen my in-laws they've passed away I've seen them there with death rattles and my my wife she she took most a lot of the burden with her sisters on that so we know what what the Dell family has gone through in that regard but you know death isn't pretty death isn't pretty but at the same time what a what a gracious thing to have amen a vehicle of death that we can pass from this life amen to graduate to the other side amen what what if we were stuck in in in in in a body amen and just just feeble and getting feeble and getting feeble and older and older and older and there was no way out of that think about that who who would want to live that way amen and so but I'm thankful amen that there is a a that you know from the beginning death it wasn't the intention of God it wasn't his perfect will amen but but it had to happen that way Amen in order because if if if we see death now then that means we can enjoy life amen we we we're we're we're Desiring life amen because we're seeing death all around us you know but brother Brandon preached this message Shalom he talked about the darkness that was squeezing upon the the the the Earth and upon the land that we see all kinds of Darkness taking place in the land uh and and if it's just the darkest age that we've ever lived in total chaos total insanity if brother Brandon thought it was that way back in 1964 when he preached this how much Us in the hour that we're living in people just their minds have have been totally is totally insanity and there's nothing that you can say or do to change their mind people are going to go do what they have been anointed to do in order to fulfill the scriptures amen but there's a bride in this hour amen that they're anointed to also fulfill the scriptures amen praise the Lord Jesus they're anointed amen for a resurrection they're anointed for a body change amen they're anointed Amen to to to tell death amen like this and shrug it off and keep moving on Amen there's a people that's going to come to that place amen a and and and it's just as sure as I'm standing here because the why the word declares it and I believe it and that settles it amen so the things that have gone on before us amen we're expecting to see him again because the Bible says so amen we're expecting that we're expecting that brother we're going to see brother Dell again and he won't be the way he left that's right amen we're going to see him Amen in in in Young I never really got to see him how really young amen but I'm going to see him that way when I see him again amen praise the Lord Jesus and some of the other saints that have gone on before us amen they're going to be young praise God so God he has a vision for each and every one of us and he and he knows what it will take to get us to that place amen praise God it's like the Potter amen that's building that out that Clay Pot amen he has a vision before he actually starts working on the pot before he even goes and grabs the water and grabs the clay he already has a vision of the end finin product amen and that's the reason why God Amen he has he knows you from the beginning to the end he has a vision of how you are at the expected End Amen praise God it's something that he expects amen I expect that when I go out there to the car amen this this evening that the car is going to crank amen it's expecting something amen is that you know it's going to happen praise God and so God in his mind he he he just he knows that it's going to happen he knows because it's the expected End Amen praise the Lord Jesus and so that Potter amen he's building this pot he's he's he's working on it amen but as he's working on it amen it's not not looking pretty sometimes sometimes it looks very messy and remember he's he's part of that mess as well the Potter is part of that mess amen he's working and molding on and he's getting dirty himself and I'm so thankful amen that he took the curse before we before us amen he got his hands dirty before we we get our hands dirty amen and he's the one amen who took our place amen and went to hell be for for us amen that we don't have to go hallelujah amen he's the one that did it amen because why he had he did it for an expected end in your life amen praise God and so he's working on this pot amen and then eventually right before right before the pot might be saying if the pot could talk if the vase could talk he would be like wow I've gone through this this pain this this this molding this this this handle that he's made me and I'm gone through this now he can set me aside the Potter will leave me alone no amen you're going into the oven buddy you're going into the oven because we're going to toughen you up amen you that's not the the the soft little pot you know it's got the the the the molding of what it's going to look like but it's not the expected end amen and so in the expected End Amen is for us Amen to go through the fire amen and it's in the fire amen that's going to try us amen it's the fire amen that's going to that's going to keep you or it's going to it's going to keep you there or or or you're going to give up amen because sometimes when the pot goes in the fire it can't handle the fire amen but if the if the Potter has done the right job if it's done exactly what it needed to do that that that pot's going to withstand the fire amen and so we're confident that the the work that God has done in our lives amen he is going to finish it to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he is going to finish the work that he started in us hallelujah amen I'm confident in that that I'm expecting that praise God because he has an expected end of me hallelujah amen so don't let sometimes and I say this for everybody amen don't let the fire crack you up the fire is to make you better amen know that the Potter have confidence that what the Potter has done and that he's done a good work in you that you will withstand the fire Amen Let Me Tell You Saints you know we're we're we're all of us Amen brother Brandon talked about a squeeze amen if we if you might be saying well I'm feeling a squeeze right now look at these gas prices squeezing the money and the change everything out of me I just look at and but tell you what there's other there's other things that are coming about that way Beyond gas prices amen and if you can't handle amen problems right now how are you going to handle that amen because it's it's coming the prophet talked about it amen but thank God Amen that we have amen the winner the Victorious One in US amen the one that has molded our lives and has given us the holy ghost that we can conquer amen during that time amen I don't know what's going to happen sometimes I don't even care to know what's going to happen it's so uh daunting and so uhhh overwhelming the things in the media and in the news it's just constant bombarding of something bad happening all the time amen that is trying to lose our focus on the word it's really what it's doing and so amen just stay in the word saint stay in the word stay with the vision of that he has for you praise God so we know that pain amen is part of that Vision that God has for you that expected end pain is part of it amen there's a little story a little story that I was reading one time of a of a of a bear that was that was stuck in a trap and there was a a a a hunter that was going by he was hunting hunting deer and uh he saw the the bear was stuck in the Trap and he went over there to try to grab the bear from the trap and and and and was wanting to help the bear out of the Trap but the bear just would not stay still would not let would not let go just would not let the the hunter do what he needed to do to get him out of the Trap and so the hunter he's like well I have a tranquilizer gun so let me just pull that out and when the bear saw that he went Bonkers and just would not let the the the the the the hunter uh shoot him up with the tranquilizer gun so that he could stay still he had all intentions the the the hunter had all intentions to let him go but the bearer thought that he was doing something bad to him and he was already in a in a in a in in a mess and and so the hunter what he was trying to do he couldn't he couldn't get him to to s still he was trying to press more on that trap amen so the more he would press it would hurt him more but that was the only way that he could loose it and the more it would hurt the the more the bear would try to growl at him the more he would try to bite him and unfortunately the hunter wasn't able to let him L and that's how sometimes we are Saints when problems and situations and Trials Come amen we're like the bear God wants to has given us his word to let set us free I believe every answer that he has for us is in this word this is peace but sometimes we don't think that it is sometimes we think that we can fix the situation ourselves with our own ideas and our own thinking when God has given us a source of peace and he he he is peace and if we turn to him amen and just sit still and let and let let go and let God have his way amen stand still when when when Moses came to the Red Sea what did God told him he said stand still let me take care of the bear trap man let let me pull this out I'll I'll think of something I'll know what to do amen you just stand still and that's what we should do amen and in the hours and The Temptations and the tribulations amen just stand still and see what is it that Lord you are trying to do in my life with this situation with this with this problem amen problems are going to come problems we have them every day but as always say problems are not Eternal problems have a beginning problems have have an end they don't have eternal life I'm so thankful for that amen praise God Psalms 23 1-6 tells us this it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul amen praise the Lord Jesus Psalms and and so it continues saying yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise God Amen he even though we're walking through the Valley of the shadow of death amen he says we don't have to fear any evil I know that's tough but it takes walking through the valley of the shadow of death to prove whether you're going to fear evil or not otherwise you wouldn't have the opportunity to not fear evil if you didn't go through that Valley amen for thou art with me how many believe God is with you amen how many believe God is in you amen praise God thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen praise the lord it's like the word it Comforts us amen praise God you know let's talk about the permissive will and the perfect will of God you know sometimes God allows us sometimes he allows us to make a fool of ourselves amen before we can understand his perfect will for our lives amen and and and it makes me think of uh of of that of that uh one door that that oneway mouse trap that that has the door that opens amen and the mouse goes in and he thinks that he's got it made but he can't come out and you as the homeowner yes but he is in there like I can't get out and I had the piece of cheese right there or the PE the peanut butter you know ready to go you know and God allows us sometimes amen that we go we go through that one-way door amen so he allows it he allows us so you can see the foolishness in your life amen sometimes we're just foolish in the way we think and in the way we talk he's like okay go ahead go right through there and you'll see that you won't be able to get out thinking the way you're thinking amen instead of holding on to my word and putting all your your your faith in the word amen because your ideas and my ideas your opinions and my opinions amen don't mean nothing for before God as long as they align amen with the word amen they're you're good to go you could you'll be able to get out of that mouse trap amen but if they don't align with the word of God you're stuck and you're going to dep Lord you take me out of here I can't do it I I can't I can't I can't I I've tried I I've done it all all everything that I could on my end Lord you the one who's able to open and you know what that Mouse can be freed from that mouse trap if the owner all he has to do is just open the door himself and the mouse can walk right out right but now if the mouse is sitting there leaning against the door you know trying to get out trying to get out the owner won't be able to open the door and sometimes that's what we do we're saying they're just leaning leaning on our own understanding leaning on our own opinions leaning on on our on what we think it's right amen and God is not able to open that door for you to be released free Amen in his in his word amen so let's not get stuck in the mouse trap in the spiritual mouse trap praise God Amen I it reminds me also of when when brother Brandon was lost how many read the story when brother Brandon was lost in the woods he took his wife a hunt a hunting for a hun mooon and Billy Paul was there with him and he thought that he could kill two birds with one stone because he was a Trapper he was a hunter I mean and and he was also a husband and a father and I mean he just thought he had it made everything was was I mean he was Unstoppable a amen and and and and when he got up there and he got lost he couldn't find his way back down to the mountain Amen to get back to his family to get back to his wife to get back to his son and there he was getting worried because he was said that he was he in his testimony he was given you you can go back and read it in the message uh a guide or and uh and he's uh he's there right walking around and he calls it the Indian death walk and so he's there doing circles and doing circles and and finally he gets to a point where he gets afraid and he realizes that he is not as as as tough and as strong and as he thought that he was and God allowed him to be in that position so that he could realize that he was limited in what he could do and sometimes God allows us Amen to get in positions in our lives so that we realize that you are not capable AP of changing every situation amen you and I can't amen but God can and God has the expected end for everything and everybody amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so God knew exactly where brother brandham was at and how to get him out of that situation amen but God wanted brother brandom to realize that amen so he had him walking in circles for hours until finally he said Lord I just he prayed and just listening to a testimony and his testimony he said he just prayed and when he and said Lord you guide me I can't do it on my own he looked up and he said I'm just going to take this direction and when he did he said something stopped him and got touched him in the back and said go this way because that was after he gave up his own thinking his own understanding and let go go and let again God was able to guide him amen he was able to guide him down to the line to the electrical line and using that electrical line and he was able to get down to the bottom of the mountain to everything that he loved his wife and his family amen praise the Lord Jesus so God allows us Amen to go through pains and sufferings in our lives so that we can recognize that God is our only help amen that we can let him lead us otherwise we just continue in our own stubborn ways amen praise the lord we can look at the life of Peter amen Peter walking on water and and he sinks but at least he walked on water amen but he sunk when he was looking at the his his problems amen Peter also rebuked Jesus one time did you know that he said Lord no you're not going to uh you know you're not going to die you're you're going to be here always amen he got rebuked by Jesus and said no it's not your will it's my will let my will be done amen praise the Lord and then Peter of course denies Jesus after he said he wouldn't a big bad Peter you know he said no I'll never deny you Lord and that was what he did because why God ultimately is his will amen his perfect will praise the Lord and he'll allow us to walk in permissive will for a while but eventually it would lead us to his perfect will amen praise God Amen as parents we have to let our children suffer sometimes did you know that yeah just let them suffer sometimes amen they may not understand it at the moment they but in in time they will let them suffer let let Let Them Fall let let them let them do so obviously you know you know uh the limit because you're the adult let them let let them go through that then they realize okay it's not as um as wonderful as I thought it'd be you know there's pain that goes behind it it's like the story that the the little story that that brother Eric told here about about his son when about touching the fire you know he realized then if he touched that flame it was hot amen and so that's what sometimes our kids need to know for our for themselves you know if you try to just keep them covered from everything they'll never learn anything in life right amen they'll never know anything in life and and and and and and they'll just be just stuck in a room forever and won't ever want to go out to out there in the world Amen and you're you're doing more damage to them by doing that you're harming them as a parent see God doesn't want to deal like that with us that's why he allows you to make mistakes he allows you to go ahead Peter deny me because I said I know you would he allows you Amen to make the mistake so that you realize that you're not on all control but he is amen praise God hallelujah I'm going skip skip this here amen Hebrews 5 amen see if we are children of God Amen we will learn what God needs for us to learn by what we suffer look what brother brandham says here in this quote I know you all have read this quote before he says he says in the sperian church age why does he stand by speaking of God the reason is in Romans 817- 18 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that that we suffer with him when you became a Christian he didn't say that you're never going to suffer he already told you in the Bible that you were going to suffer so that's an expected end that's expected amen if so be that we suffer with him that we may also with that suffering be glorified together amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed not over us but in US amen because the work is From the Inside Out hallelujah amen and then he continues to say this unless we suffer can you all read that okay unless we suffer with him who Christ we cannot reign with him so if everything is easy and honky door in your life you are not a candidate to reign with Jesus because Jesus suffered amen you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering you want to have character in your life right you're going to suffer suffer away but Christ has suffered already for you amen so he knows what you're going through because we all want character we all want want to be like Jesus but we don't want to suffer like Jesus character is a victory and not a gift we don't come here to this world with character in our lives amen it is built upon your life's experiences right A Man Without character can't reain because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule Hallelujah so character is important in our lives right how many how many believe that character is important get ready to suffer suffer but suffer for the Lord amen and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame the reason why he overcame is because he suffered and they sat down in his father's Throne then we we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation W so we've got to have tribulation in our lives amen so these are four blessings that come from Pain one it often brings us to repentance when you have pain you start checking your life Lord where have I failed you what do I need to do to draw closer to God so that is one of the purposes that God allows pain in our lives and that God and that God puts allows trials in our lives trials drive us to our knees instead of to despair CS Lewis he wrote and said pain is God's megaphone to Rouse a deaf World a megaphone you know like a bullhorn so God allows painful and hurtful situations in our lives Amen to Rouse you to draw you closer to him not to not not to separate you from God he doesn't not allow pain in your life so that you can walk away from God he allows pain in your life so that you can come closer to him amen Another Blessing that comes from pain is pain and hurt strengthen our faith it can break us or build us amen I put there like a seed falling on the rock or in in the middle or in the middle of the Thorns you see so that pain it can either break you or whatever or it can it can mold you it can make you a better Christian amen God wants the latter praise the Lord Another Blessing is that hard times increase the effectiveness of our witness a person going through drug rehab becomes an empathetic counselor amen a person that that has been in the the streets that has been in drugs that has that has has lived the life of the streets knows how to be able to help another person that's going through the same situation so if you've never experienced any hardship in your life you won't ever be able to help anybody else in that same hardship amen so we've got to have pain because the pain is not just for us it's for also to affect the others around us praise the Lord PA Paul spoke effectively to the Pharisees because he used to be a Pharisee amen praise the Lord and and the fourth blessing is that it helps us to step back and look at the big picture and that God truly is in control amen it helps us to look look look at the whole picture and say Lord what is the ultimate goal amen behind this what is the ultimate goal and that's very important because sometimes we're just very narrow-minded and we get we we we we get used to the routine and we get used to the to the to just how things are at one point and and God wants to expand your vision God wants to expand your your your horizon Amen to look amen at what at what God has in store for you but you can't see what God has in store for you if you got blinders on right and he's got he's got something right here ready for you amen see I can't see that water right now and and I'm I'm a little thirsty but see if I if I got these blinders on I I can't I won't be able to benefit from the water CU I won't know the water is there and it's right there and because it's right there I'm going to take a sip I hope you're enjoying this tonight maybe it wasn't what you came to look a little for but amen what we talking about is peace shalom praise the Lord amen we're finishing up brother brandom says here and I guess if I want to if I want to finish it is is is let's finish it with with what brother brandham said amen this is what brother brandham says in the message Shalom he preached two this was in January 12th 1964 and then he preached another one January 19th the same year and he says and remember when the full Bible listen in closing when this full Bible has been thoroughly a Vindicated then there will be an eternal Shalom an eternal peace amen what is he saying in other words when the full word has been fully uh uh Vindicated or or or or fulfilled amen because nothing is going to go amen Jesus said this world will not pass until every jot every TI every eye is dotted everything passes exactly the way he thought about it the expected end that he had amen nothing's going to end until that's when an eternal Shalom will be praise God how many would desire that Eternal Shalom Eternal peace but you got to have the Eternal Peacemaker inside of you first amen if you don't have the Eternal Peacemaker inside of you you're not going to be able to enjoy the Eternal peace out here cuz you won't be there I'm sorry to say you won't be there to enjoy that Eternal peace so enjoy the Eternal peace maker right now praise God I know that sounded a little rough amen but we all need to be born again amen we all need an experience with God that's right amen I say that from the pulpit to the janitor room praise the Lord I want to see you there I I I and I hope you want to me to see you want me to be there too praise God cuz I want to be I want to see brother again I want to see brother Gary I want to see all these Saints amen uh all these saints that have gone on Amen I I want to see them again there saints that from Brother Jee Williams Church in Anderson that I miss so much brother Cleveland brother banister those those Saints amen that that that that touched my life and had such an impact in my life as I was growing up in in this message amen I want to see them again amen and I want I want to live the way he wants me to live so that I can see them praise God but there's more word to be a Vindicated brother brandham says he's got to vindicate more word and when the last word is Vindicated is Vindicated rather then death is swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah and the dead in Christ shall rise amen the Millennium will set in and it'll will be one great peace Shalom amen why because the the the Satan will be bound amen for a thousand years and then later he'll be thrown into a lake of fire let's live for that day brother Brown says brother sister for that one great Shalom remember the Bible is the Fountain of all wisdom and holds all hopes of the future to the church shalom then he says in in in a few days later he says this face the new year with this put him as David said I'll put him always before me because he is on my right hand I shall not be moved if you meet death this year what difference does it make God promised he would raise you up if an accident kills you what difference does it make you have eternal life all raise him up at the last days amen what if anything happens no matter what it is nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ hunger Peril nakedness no matter what it is nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ and he is the word Shalom amen John 16:33 jesus' own words I love this scripture he says these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace Amen in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen be of good cheer Saints man you're going to have you're going to have tribulation it's expected right we just talked about that you're going to have you're going to have problems you're going to have trials as you're walking in the Christian walk but be of good cheer he's overcome that tribulation already praise God no matter what you have to go through listen Saints maybe that wasn't in God's will to heal brother Dell but let me tell you what he's healed right now so his word his word it wasn't it wasn't his will to be healed here but he he's healed on the other side and as as a matter of fact more than healed praise God so either if God doesn't uh do something for you or something that you're expecting right now maybe for your body or or whatever your request is amen let's just say for a sick body or amen if he doesn't do it right now amen and you have to go by the grave you're still a winner that's right you're still an overcomer amen because you're you the he overcame for you and he made a way for you amen praise the Lord Jesus so with that I say shalom Saints Shalom let God be the peace let God be the peace for the the Dale family and and like I said you know just encourage them and and in any way that you can pray for them but most of all I think I think just keep nanny in prayer amen because Saint and I know we will'll come in and real B her in her mind and she needs that Shalom praise the Lord Jesus and you have the shalom in you amen that can that can help bring that Shalom that atmosphere in her life amen praise God how many love the Lord amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet amen let's just have a word of prayer I have the musicians

thing let's honor brother Dale by doing what he said doing what the word said cuz like brother Louise said he loved the word of God he loved a message of the hour more than anybody probably I've ever known he he he dug in when some didn't want to dig in he preached some things sometime people didn't want to preach but he did did such a good job doing it he's left us a legacy he he's left us something to look forward to I told June today and I we hadn't cried much and we were looking each other coming down the road and I said when I see Dad I want to ask him one [Music] question who met

death right and just carry you right on the cross that's first thing I'm going to ask him when he comes back here I'm going to ask him I say hey who was the first one to mess you at the river that's awesome and he'll tell us oh what a wonderful time don't be sad oh we can cry we cry tears of joy but don't be sad he fought his whole life for this and there's so many people that I was telling brother Buster over here I went and told him and he said your dad preached a long time I said yeah he preached over 50 years I said now he's getting to meet some of the people that lived under his

a Joy's time it is sad but let's make it a Joy's time let's um let's move forward remember I told you brother Dell's greatest gift you could ever give him is to do what he says do what he walk into what he preached amen if you walk into what he preached he's a he's the happiest man in the world you can give him gifts that that means a lot but what did he take with him he didn't take gifts with him over across the other side he took what was in his heart and what he preached he took it with him let me tell you one let me tell you two things before we leave and I'll be telling probably Saturday dad in 1998 when I came back to the Lord um and I know he told it here some he told a dream and um he um he told a dream that that he saw a spaceship I know some of younger ones won't remember this his own tape probably in in the '90s but he had a vision or a dream that there was a spaceship come over his come over his head and landed on a hill landed on a hill and the lights were on you know and dad said remember in the dream he's helping people up that hill helping them pulling them pushing them up to get in that spaceship and they all got in the spaceship except him is that him it left without him well now we all going to leave without him but I believe he's got a group of people that he put in that spaceship that's going to bring that man back to Earth in a glorified body and about 3 months ago and I was telling brother Luis I have dreams but some of them you couldn't tell by the pull pit don't you can laugh cuz you've had the same ones and you don't know where in the world that came from so I'm not a hard dreamer but I had a dream about 3 months ago and the vision popped open and and I was sitting in a like a booth and it was all white behind me and I turned and put my arm up over the booth like this and I turned it look like over the the white banister and here come a man walking there's a picture of me him holding me he was 20 years old he was almost 20 when I was born in January he was 20 in um April so he was 19 when I was born and it's a picture of him holding me on the back of a of a Chevrolet um truck a car and it was I was about 6 months old so he would have been right at 20 years old and that was the exact man that walked up black hair tall skinny and he always smiled a lot of times like this and he was just smiling looked at me and smiled and then the vision left don't worry he's more alive than we are now and he left that old pest house and that's what we're going to put in the ground but he will be back all right I'll promise you he'll be back but he's left us a good Legacy and and there's no way I can fill his shoes I don't want to I want him to have his own shoes his own legacy but I just want to be able to help everybody we need to get through this we get through this and then we'll continue on soldiers fall that doesn't end the battle you do the best you can for the ones and then you take you keep going forward let's be some of those people that Dad was pushing up to hell up the hill a progressive message he preached a progressive message he was one of the first ministers in this gospel in the 70s when everybody was preaching God sent a prophet hair and dress you know and all that legalism he stepped forward and said hey there's more to this right he's preached statute of perfect man different things way in the 70s when other people didn't even know what it was you're a recipient of that so what are we going to do with it there's many people that's coming Saturday that's uh that's a um has a direct he's had
