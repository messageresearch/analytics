[33:23] Good to see everybody in the house of
[33:25] the Lord. If you'd like turning your
[33:26] scriptures, turn back where we've been
[33:28] reading in Hebrews 8.
[33:30] and Ecclesiastes 12.
[33:34] And remember that way tonight, the Lord
[33:36] willing, be leaving early Saturday
[33:38] morning to go to brother Bill Yiance for
[33:40] the uh ministers meeting. And also
[33:44] remember that going to be with us. And
[33:47] then remember also the next weekend, the
[33:49] 18th will be the fellowship meeting.
[33:52] We'll be at brother Homer Lori. So if
[33:54] any of you want to go, make sure you let
[33:56] us know. I know you already have, but
[33:59] remember to pray for brother Narcissus.
[34:01] Said he had bronchitis and I think they
[34:04] was wanting to keep him in the hospital,
[34:06] but yet they uh you know, he said he
[34:10] couldn't afford it or something. Anyhow,
[34:12] so just pray that the Lord would would
[34:14] bless him and take care of it. All
[34:16] right.
[34:19] I reckon that's all the announcements
[34:22] coming. Yeah, we'll probably be bringing
[34:24] a brother back with us from the
[34:27] ministers meeting for the weekend. I've
[34:29] never met him, but uh we'll we'll see
[34:33] and have him to come back with us. All
[34:35] right. So, if you'd like to turn in your
[34:36] scriptures, Hebrews 8 and Ecclesiastes
[34:39] 12. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[34:42] your love and your grace unto us. We
[34:44] thank you for peace and joy and thank
[34:47] you for love and Lord for all things. We
[34:51] ask you to just bless now as we read
[34:54] your word that you would come and speak
[34:56] to our hearts. Lord, forgive our sins
[34:59] because we want to stand complete in
[35:01] you. We ask you to be with the sick ones
[35:03] among us, Lord, and just reach down and
[35:06] touch us. You said you sent your word
[35:08] and healed us. So, we believe it.
[35:10] And Father, we commit it to you. Now, be
[35:12] with Brother Narcissist, our Lord, that
[35:14] you'd touch him with that bronchitis
[35:16] that all would be well. And Lord, we
[35:19] believe your word. So now come among us
[35:21] to not be a recorder but to be a
[35:24] preeminent one in our hearts and lives.
[35:26] We love you and we thank you in Jesus
[35:28] name. Amen.
[35:31] Hebrews
[35:34] 8:1.
[35:43] Now the things which we have spoken this
[35:46] is the sum you know all from chapter 1
[35:49] through chapter 7 all the great things
[35:51] that he spoke of he's summing it up to
[35:54] do so to say what we have such an high
[35:57] priest that is sit on the right hand of
[36:00] the throne of the majesty in the
[36:02] heavens. Now go back go over to where
[36:04] we've been reading in Ecclesiastes and
[36:08] after he's finishing up all that he has
[36:10] said about the Lord and the the ways and
[36:14] things verse 13 said let us hear the
[36:17] conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God
[36:20] and keep his commandments for this is
[36:22] the whole duty of man. You may be
[36:26] seated. The Lord had his blessing to the
[36:29] reading of the word. Now
[36:33] you know what we've been doing and wait
[36:36] somebody fell down. We've been talking
[36:39] about the things and uh going from you
[36:44] know partial to perfect you know partial
[36:47] realization about something taking a
[36:49] topic and studying that topic to try to
[36:53] bring it out to a conclusion
[36:55] uh in the day that you and I are living.
[36:58] And uh you remember I told you to not
[37:01] think that we were backing up because I
[37:05] believe that we're here now where that
[37:08] the head and body can unite and bring
[37:11] its own message, you know, and I believe
[37:14] that. So, you know, that's just what I'm
[37:17] depending on and keeping it in the line
[37:20] to try to bring everything out to a
[37:23] perfection
[37:26] to see, you know, uh, what is revealed,
[37:29] not to just stay on partial realization.
[37:32] That's fine. It's great to partial
[37:35] realization, partial understanding. But
[37:38] why would we want to stay on that when
[37:40] the Bible
[37:42] is coming to a conclusion? And I believe
[37:45] that. I believe we're in the end of the
[37:47] world. Don't you
[37:48] now? Nobody's saying what day, what
[37:50] hour, what we're talking about. That
[37:51] that see that's where people, oh, you
[37:53] think the end of the world. No, I
[37:55] believe we're in the end of the world.
[37:57] Cuz you look around you and you'll think
[38:00] too that we're in the end of the world.
[38:02] But yet, uh, still see, I believe
[38:06] there's a lot of things that God is
[38:07] going to do among us and all. And I'm
[38:11] looking forward to that, you know,
[38:13] because there is a rapture to come and
[38:15] things like that. But I believe we're in
[38:16] the end of the world. Well, if we're in
[38:18] the end of the world, then we're in the
[38:21] point to where that uh you know, the
[38:25] word is coming to uh full maturity
[38:30] to where we can can understand, you
[38:32] know, and not still think about, well, I
[38:35] wonder why this or wonder why that, you
[38:37] know, we can see it as a uh truth and a
[38:41] reality in in, you know, in doing
[38:46] now.
[38:50] We talked about this along the way and
[38:52] we've mentioned it. So, what I wanted to
[38:55] do is for us to just think on the
[38:57] subject tonight of be ye therefore
[39:01] perfect.
[39:03] All right. Be ye therefore perfect. So,
[39:06] let's go over there while we're at it to
[39:08] Matthew 5
[39:11] 48.
[39:13] Yeah. Everybody knows that scripture.
[39:15] It's, you know,
[39:17] it's been argued among mankind is up and
[39:21] down and backwards and forth. You know,
[39:23] well, what was meant and what was that?
[39:25] Well, if it's in the Bible,
[39:29] some way somehow,
[39:31] there must be a time come that uh things
[39:35] can come to a position to understand how
[39:38] that that is fulfilled.
[39:40] Right?
[39:41] All right. Now, I believe that about the
[39:42] whole word. So, what does it say now?
[39:44] Matthew 5:48, "Be ye therefore perfect,
[39:48] even as your father
[39:51] which is in heaven is perfect."
[39:54] Amen.
[39:55] All right. Now, you remember what we
[39:56] were talking about uh our Sunday
[40:02] and we were talking about the new birth
[40:05] and how that you know that new birth
[40:08] Jesus said you must be born again. The
[40:12] original translation says you must be
[40:14] born from above. All right? And being
[40:19] born from above. See, you would have to
[40:21] be born where God come from. Cuz there
[40:24] would be no need of us being born again
[40:27] as Nicodemus said from a natural extent
[40:31] to go back to the mother's wound and
[40:33] come out again in some way try to to
[40:35] make us better. No, that wouldn't work.
[40:38] But to be born from above, from wherever
[40:41] God came from is where you and I have
[40:44] got to have our birth to come from. So
[40:46] then it's not a natural thing that
[40:48] you're talking about. But now, so now
[40:52] let's just take something
[40:54] and you know, look at it. Look at uh now
[40:57] just remember that scripture.
[40:59] Now I believe that scripture. Be it
[41:02] therefore perfect even as your father in
[41:04] heaven is perfect.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:06] Now I believe that scripture. I believe
[41:07] that's the Bible.
[41:08] Amen.
[41:09] All right. And I believe it has to be
[41:11] fulfilled.
[41:13] All right. Now, but now let's go and and
[41:16] pick up a couple of more scriptures. So,
[41:18] drop over in Psalms
[41:22] 53.
[41:32] And uh
[41:35] look at verse
[41:37] 2 and three
[41:40] says, "God looked down from heaven
[41:44] upon the children of men
[41:47] to see if there were any that did
[41:50] understand
[41:52] that did seek God." Right? Now,
[41:57] every one of them is gone back.
[42:01] They are allto together become filthy.
[42:05] There is none that doeth good.
[42:08] No, not one.
[42:12] You'll find almost the same phrase over
[42:15] in Psalms 14 and verse three, 2 and
[42:19] three, right in there.
[42:22] But see, one says, "Be you therefore
[42:25] perfect."
[42:27] All right.
[42:28] him. We'll get to it in a minute. If
[42:31] you're not perfect, you're not going to
[42:33] heaven.
[42:35] Some way has to be made for us to be
[42:37] able to reach that.
[42:39] But here we find that there's none good.
[42:42] No, not one. All right, let's look over
[42:45] while we're at it into
[42:48] You'd say, "Well, that brother Dale is
[42:50] an Old Testament." Okay, we'll go over
[42:53] into the New Testament and we'll see
[42:55] what Jesus had to say from Matthew 19
[43:00] and verse 17
[43:02] and see what he had to say.
[43:10] Matthew 19:17
[43:15] And he said unto them, why callst thou
[43:17] me good?
[43:19] There is none good but one, that is God.
[43:25] But if that thou will enter into life,
[43:27] keep the commandments.
[43:29] Now Jesus said there's none good. Know
[43:32] not one.
[43:34] You know, now that's Bible
[43:37] just as much as be therefore perfect
[43:42] is Bible.
[43:43] Amen.
[43:43] All right. So now while we at it, let's
[43:47] go over to see what Paul had to say
[43:51] in conclusion of picking up from uh go
[43:55] to Romans 3.
[43:57] From picking up from what was said in
[44:00] the Psalms
[44:02] about there was none good, know not one.
[44:06] Romans 3 and10
[44:10] says it as it is written there is none
[44:14] righteous
[44:17] know not one
[44:20] now that's Bible
[44:23] okay you say well I don't like that I'd
[44:26] like to take this
[44:29] you know I I want this scripture
[44:33] well now what are you going to do with
[44:35] this scripture Yeah.
[44:38] See, now they both got to be right.
[44:40] Right.
[44:41] Right.
[44:42] Or it wouldn't be in the Bible.
[44:44] Right.
[44:48] See, but you say, "Well, now ah what it
[44:50] was uh Jesus just said it that way and
[44:53] and it's just wrote by Paul just to, you
[44:56] know, just to to be something to be
[44:58] said." You know, that's what Eve said.
[45:03] Right. Right.
[45:05] She said, "God didn't mean what he
[45:07] said."
[45:08] That's right.
[45:09] Right. Amen.
[45:10] Right.
[45:12] Was that what she said? God didn't mean
[45:14] what he said.
[45:15] Right.
[45:16] She didn't deny that he said it.
[45:18] Right.
[45:20] She just said, "Well, he didn't really
[45:23] mean it." You know? All right. Now, what
[45:28] do you think about it? You say, "Well, I
[45:29] know how we come to this. I know it."
[45:31] But just follow with me a little bit
[45:33] tonight.
[45:35] And let's see what we can come up with.
[45:38] Now there in Matthew
[45:42] that we were reading
[45:46] where it says for us to be therefore
[45:49] perfect even as your father which is in
[45:51] heaven is perfect. Now how can a human
[45:55] mortal being?
[45:57] Right.
[45:58] Now we should all easily admit that
[46:00] there's none good know not one.
[46:02] Right.
[46:03] You know,
[46:04] I mean, like brother Brown said it one
[46:06] time in the Hebrew series, he said that
[46:10] I'd hate to think that I was born 5
[46:12] minutes ago and had to go to heaven upon
[46:15] my merits.
[46:17] He said, "Because I was born in sin,
[46:19] shape iniquity."
[46:20] Right?
[46:21] Now, what is a five minute old baby
[46:23] done?
[46:25] Nothing. But it's none good.
[46:27] Right?
[46:30] It's not because it was born from
[46:32] special mama, special daddy gets a
[46:34] special trip to heaven. No. Now listen.
[46:36] We all know the truth.
[46:39] All babies go to heaven. Don't worry
[46:41] about it.
[46:42] Under the age of accountability, all
[46:44] babies go to heaven because Jesus paid
[46:47] the price.
[46:48] Yes, sir.
[46:49] So, he's not an unjust God.
[46:53] But I'm just trying to get you to look
[46:55] at a point.
[46:56] What good thing do you think you could
[46:59] do? Is it says there in the scripture
[47:01] that you might inherit eternal life?
[47:06] Well,
[47:07] I I if I don't break the law, I'm in
[47:10] good shape. Well,
[47:13] that's the way the Pharisees, we'll get
[47:15] to it in a minute. That's what they
[47:16] rested in,
[47:17] right? Amen.
[47:18] And Paul even said concerning the law,
[47:21] blameless.
[47:24] Other words, he wasn't guilty of any
[47:26] breaking of the law.
[47:29] But yet, he found that to be death
[47:31] instead of life. That's right.
[47:33] You know, he found it to be the wrong
[47:35] thing. But look back while you're there
[47:37] in Matthew at 5:20 and let's read that
[47:40] scripture
[47:45] and see how much it's got to come to.
[47:48] For I say unto you
[47:51] that except your righteousness
[47:54] shall exceed
[47:58] in other words go over be greater
[48:02] the righteousness of the scribes and
[48:04] Pharisees
[48:06] you shall in no case enter into the
[48:09] kingdom of heaven.
[48:12] Now,
[48:15] where would there be any of us than
[48:16] anything that we could think about, as I
[48:18] said, that would make us worthy?
[48:24] When the psalmist, he summed it up by
[48:27] saying that
[48:31] none good.
[48:34] Paul sums it up in Romans 3:10 by saying
[48:37] that
[48:39] there's not any of us righteous.
[48:45] And Jesus said, "Unless our
[48:47] righteousness exceed
[48:50] the righteousness of the scribes and
[48:52] Pharisees,
[48:54] we can't enter the kingdom of heaven."
[48:59] See now first that's meaning the kingdom
[49:03] of heaven which is the baptism of the
[49:04] Holy Ghost
[49:05] right
[49:06] then we'll read some scripture in a
[49:08] minute if we don't we'll tell it to you
[49:09] like it is that it goes on to the basis
[49:12] that you won't enter heaven with sin
[49:16] that's why I tried my best to preach
[49:18] there you know to show us that we
[49:21] Christians are the only ones that have
[49:23] sins
[49:24] and we better repent of them Cuz if we
[49:27] don't, we're going to have to give an
[49:29] account.
[49:30] That's right. Amen.
[49:34] Now, it's like I told my wife the other
[49:35] day, we were talking. See, I know the
[49:38] Bible this way. If I do something to
[49:40] brother Collie,
[49:43] you remember brother Brandham said about
[49:44] the lady when she said uh he told her
[49:48] said, "You committed adultery on your
[49:50] husband." She said, "But I confessed
[49:52] that to the Lord." Right?
[49:55] He said, "But you didn't do that to the
[49:57] Lord."
[49:57] Right?
[49:58] You done it to your husband.
[50:00] Right?
[50:00] See, if I do something to brother Collie
[50:03] and I won't go make that right,
[50:08] I'm going to have to make that right one
[50:10] day.
[50:11] So, if I was all of us, we need to be
[50:14] real careful in our walk and our doings
[50:16] and all things.
[50:18] You're talking about me, Brother Dale.
[50:21] I wouldn't be talking about you if you
[50:22] weren't guilty,
[50:27] right?
[50:29] So that solves that problem.
[50:32] But now think about it. What is
[50:34] righteousness?
[50:38] And righteousness is it means like
[50:41] integrity, you know, great position. It
[50:44] means virtue.
[50:47] It means purity of life.
[50:51] It means rightness
[50:53] you know rightness.
[50:56] It means
[50:59] correction of thinking or feeling
[51:02] and acting.
[51:05] Now Webster says righteousness is really
[51:10] the state or act of being right.
[51:15] See? All right. Now then you can see
[51:18] that the Pharisees
[51:22] under the law
[51:25] there was a righteousness which was in
[51:27] the law
[51:29] and that righteousness which was in the
[51:31] law was the fact that if you didn't
[51:33] break the law
[51:36] it wasn't a righteousness in the law
[51:40] it was a righteousness in the fact that
[51:42] if you didn't break that law
[51:46] you were not guilty. Right.
[51:50] It doesn't bother me whatsoever for, you
[51:52] know, we could have 50 brothers coming
[51:55] through preaching whatever night for 50
[51:58] nights and they all preached on
[52:02] It's wrong to steal.
[52:04] You know, that wouldn't bother me
[52:06] whatsoever.
[52:08] Would it you?
[52:09] Right.
[52:10] No, cuz I'm not guilty of stealing.
[52:13] I would I wouldn't have no problem. me.
[52:17] Well, you know what I'd be? I'd be as
[52:19] far as concerning the what the man was
[52:21] talking about, I'd be righteous because
[52:23] I'd be right.
[52:26] So, now get the definition and then
[52:28] we'll get on into the rest of the point.
[52:32] The fact or state of being right.
[52:38] And you know that we we will if we have
[52:40] time, but you know that justification
[52:44] chops off your ped sins,
[52:46] right?
[52:47] Right.
[52:47] Mhm.
[52:48] And you know that you'll never have to
[52:49] give an account for that.
[52:51] That's right. Amen.
[52:54] So now as far as that is, you're right.
[52:57] Right.
[52:57] Why? Because you done confessed it.
[53:01] And it's like I told you there Sunday,
[53:03] what I love to hear that day was when
[53:05] the prophet of God said, "If somebody
[53:07] commits a sin and repents,"
[53:10] he said, "No matter what it is, when
[53:12] they come through the prayer line," he
[53:13] said, "I can't bring that up."
[53:16] He said, "Because God won't let me see
[53:18] it."
[53:19] He said, "Because they've repented."
[53:21] Amen.
[53:22] Now, that's a wonderful state.
[53:24] So get what I'm talking about. If you
[53:26] want to talk about justification, talk
[53:28] about the state or fact of being right.
[53:32] Right. Amen.
[53:33] You've repented.
[53:35] You've confessed your fault.
[53:38] So, you're right.
[53:41] You're righteous
[53:44] because you're you're not blamed.
[53:48] Paul said in Philippians 2 and 6 that
[53:51] touching the righteousness which is in
[53:53] the law that he was blameless.
[53:57] That's right.
[53:58] Now those Pharisees, you've heard the
[54:00] prophet tell especially the high priest
[54:03] that if anything could be brought up
[54:04] against that high priest, he was taken
[54:08] out and killed.
[54:09] Right. Amen.
[54:12] I mean it was just instant death. There
[54:14] was no court of appeal,
[54:16] right? It was death. Amen.
[54:18] Why? Because he had a mark against him
[54:20] and the high priest couldn't have one.
[54:24] All right. So then we need to think
[54:26] about it.
[54:32] How could a human mortal
[54:36] ever think of
[54:39] being perfect?
[54:43] And you know those Pharisees, now I keep
[54:46] laying that down because I want you to
[54:47] think about it.
[54:50] As far as concerning the law,
[54:54] they were blameless.
[54:58] They were righteous. Why? Because they
[55:00] were right.
[55:03] They hadn't done wrong.
[55:07] But Jesus said one day, he said, "Now
[55:10] if I hadn't spoken to you,
[55:15] you deny no sin."
[55:18] Now scripture, now read your Bible.
[55:20] Right?
[55:21] But he said, "Now that I spoken unto
[55:23] you,
[55:24] said your sin remainth."
[55:28] In other words, they became sinners
[55:29] after facing
[55:31] the living word.
[55:34] Right? All right. Now look at a
[55:37] situation.
[55:39] How could Jesus tell a man, how can you
[55:42] today? How can you tell somebody,
[55:45] right,
[55:46] that
[55:48] you sin every day? Danny said he had a
[55:51] buddy said he didn't sin every day.
[55:54] He said, in other words, you say you're
[55:56] selectively sinning.
[55:59] You know, you know, you just sin when
[56:01] you want to or whatever you want to do
[56:03] selectively. But you see,
[56:06] we do sin every day.
[56:08] Amen.
[56:09] That's why we must repent.
[56:12] Well, that's what I can't understand
[56:13] about you, brother Dale, is you'll say
[56:15] we're perfect, then you'll say we're
[56:17] sinners.
[56:22] Both of them got to be right.
[56:24] Cuz it's what God said. That's right.
[56:29] God said there's none of us,
[56:32] no man perfect except God.
[56:37] Huh? Said, "Now, if you're going to get
[56:39] where God is, you got to be that
[56:41] perfect,
[56:42] right?"
[56:45] He said, "Well, I I tell you what, I
[56:47] don't know." Well, let's read what your
[56:49] prophet had to say about it
[56:52] while we're on this line because I like
[56:54] to lay it down.
[56:56] I got mine sticking in here somewhere.
[56:59] I thought I did.
[57:06] Somebody may have to give me a copy of
[57:08] what you got out there cuz I I got
[57:10] Sundays.
[57:11] Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. I know I
[57:14] got Sundays already in here, but maybe
[57:16] we won't have to use them. But, uh,
[57:20] let's just read.
[57:24] Now remember this is the man that is to
[57:27] explain to us these things and from the
[57:30] message the lamb's book of life 1956
[57:34] 603
[57:37] he's coming down talking about
[57:39] perfection and things and he says uh
[57:43] people say there's none perfect. That's
[57:45] right. You can't be perfect in the sight
[57:47] of your fellow man,
[57:50] but you've got to be perfect or you'll
[57:53] never go to heaven.
[57:56] That's right. He said
[57:59] the Bible said Jesus speaking in the
[58:01] biatitudes said, "Be you therefore
[58:02] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[58:05] perfect." Then you got to be just as
[58:07] perfect as God is
[58:10] or you're lost.
[58:13] Now, how are you going to do it? See,
[58:17] now one little mistake and you're lost.
[58:22] One little flip of the eye and you're
[58:25] gone. Cuz nothing can enter in to those
[58:30] places
[58:31] but perfect.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:36] You believe that?
[58:37] Amen.
[58:38] Okay. Going down law having a shadow
[58:40] 1954 1203.
[58:45] The law having a shadow of things to
[58:47] come could not make the comer there
[58:49] comer perfect.
[58:51] What's the subject Paul speaking of
[58:53] here? Perfection.
[58:55] God requires perfection. No one could
[58:58] ever come to heaven outside of being
[59:00] perfect. Perfect. You must be perfect.
[59:03] And yet the scripture says none is
[59:06] perfect.
[59:08] So if you must be perfect to come to
[59:10] heaven then, and the scripture says none
[59:13] is perfect, and we've all sinned and
[59:16] come short of the glory of God, how are
[59:19] we ever going to enter God's living
[59:22] place and dwelling place when he
[59:25] requires perfection?
[59:28] Jesus said, I believe in the in the
[59:30] sermon on the mount, he said, "Be ye
[59:31] therefore perfect even as your father in
[59:33] heaven is perfect."
[59:35] Think of the perfection that God
[59:37] requires of the person of perfection.
[59:43] Now, God requires perfection.
[59:49] Yeah.
[59:50] Now, how are we going to get there?
[59:55] You see why I'm so much against the
[59:57] people of the message of the hour and
[1:00:00] the way they come down at always was
[1:00:02] eternal,
[1:00:03] right?
[1:00:04] Don't need to be saved cuz I'd always
[1:00:06] saved.
[1:00:10] All of this would be in vain,
[1:00:13] right?
[1:00:14] To think about.
[1:00:16] So you would be saying that
[1:00:20] one scripture is all right, but the rest
[1:00:22] of it we don't know about.
[1:00:25] So we'll take over there in the little
[1:00:27] John's where it said he that's born to
[1:00:29] God does not commit sin.
[1:00:34] The seed remainth in him. We take that.
[1:00:38] But what do you think about
[1:00:42] what do you think about the fact that
[1:00:46] we've got to be perfect to go to heaven?
[1:00:52] I'm going slow.
[1:00:54] I don't want you to think.
[1:00:58] Then we say, "Well, now wait a minute. I
[1:00:59] know what this I know what that is. I'm
[1:01:02] you. I'd probably just slow down a
[1:01:03] little bit and listen. Ain't going to
[1:01:05] hurt you. You're not going anywhere.
[1:01:09] I don't think
[1:01:12] of course it's like
[1:01:14] way told about one time he went to a
[1:01:16] place and they had a
[1:01:19] before this between the something
[1:01:21] service and the other one they had a
[1:01:23] 15minute smoke break.
[1:01:26] Well, we was in a church one time where
[1:01:29] that uh
[1:01:31] never seen that one, but you know, they
[1:01:34] just all at once we sing and I thought,
[1:01:36] well, you know, all at once they said,
[1:01:38] "Okay, fellowship time." They just
[1:01:41] stopped and
[1:01:44] everybody just started going around
[1:01:45] among the church just shaking hands.
[1:01:47] Heidi, how you doing? Everything doing
[1:01:49] all right? Sie, is this this week been a
[1:01:51] good week? You know, everybody just And
[1:01:53] then it went on into the church service.
[1:01:56] Well, I told my wife, I said, "What I'm
[1:01:57] going to do is
[1:01:59] I'm going to come out one day and
[1:02:02] read my scriptures, and then we're going
[1:02:04] to have a pea break
[1:02:09] and give you 15 minutes to go to the
[1:02:11] bathroom."
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:20] Hallelujah.
[1:02:21] Sounds funny, but
[1:02:23] I think we need to check on there. And
[1:02:26] it's not just the children.
[1:02:27] That's right.
[1:02:28] But now it's kind of like his brother
[1:02:30] told me one time. He said, he said, "I
[1:02:33] just can't stand it sitting in church
[1:02:35] for an hour."
[1:02:38] Okay.
[1:02:40] He said, "But I can sit and whale for 5
[1:02:42] hours in one place."
[1:02:46] He said, "Just sit there."
[1:02:49] I said, "Well, that don't match too good
[1:02:50] for me,
[1:02:51] right?"
[1:02:52] You know, but uh everybody check on it.
[1:02:55] You know, the bathrooms are back there.
[1:02:57] When you come upstairs, take the kids to
[1:02:59] the bathroom and make sure that they're
[1:03:02] through and then when they come in, you
[1:03:04] know, they don't have to worry about it.
[1:03:06] And uh you know,
[1:03:09] um it won't interrupt the services,
[1:03:12] right?
[1:03:13] You said, "Well, my kidneys, Brother
[1:03:15] Dale, well, that's all right. We pray
[1:03:16] for the sick. None of you have come told
[1:03:18] me you had kidney problems.
[1:03:20] We pray for the sick,
[1:03:23] you know. So, you need to work on that.
[1:03:26] Okay. Not only the kids, but see in just
[1:03:29] a minute they look the doors open and
[1:03:31] then you'll go some adults and they'll
[1:03:33] get up and go back and forth. You know,
[1:03:35] the bathrooms are back there. You want
[1:03:37] us to move a porta potty beside your
[1:03:38] seat?
[1:03:43] You shouldn't talk like that, brother. I
[1:03:45] agree. We But truth is truth, right?
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:50] That's right.
[1:03:50] That's right.
[1:03:51] You said, "Well, I just feel this urge."
[1:03:54] Well,
[1:03:56] I've been going to church for
[1:04:00] coming in this message over 40 years,
[1:04:03] you know,
[1:04:05] and I'm one of those that has them
[1:04:06] bladder problems,
[1:04:08] but you know, I never get up and go to
[1:04:10] the bathroom.
[1:04:16] I think some of you just want to be
[1:04:17] seen.
[1:04:21] Well, we'll start do that. So, instead
[1:04:23] of having a pee break, we'll have a
[1:04:24] stand up break. Wait, stand up. When
[1:04:26] brother call, we just go one. Everybody
[1:04:29] sees you. Okay.
[1:04:32] All right. Get you upset and then you
[1:04:34] won't hear a thing I say.
[1:04:38] Right.
[1:04:39] But now, is it the truth? Amen. Yes,
[1:04:42] sir.
[1:04:43] You see, if you was up here in my place,
[1:04:46] That's right.
[1:04:47] things would be a whole lot different,
[1:04:50] you would have already been screaming
[1:04:52] and hollering and doing it. I try my
[1:04:55] best to, you know, let it go. And
[1:04:59] but just check on it, you know.
[1:05:02] I mean, we don't want nobody wetting
[1:05:03] their pants.
[1:05:06] Look.
[1:05:10] Well, you're going to do what you're
[1:05:12] going to do anyway. So, it doesn't
[1:05:13] matter. It ain't going to change it cuz
[1:05:15] I save it. Okay, let's get back to our
[1:05:17] message.
[1:05:19] How can we have any thoughts
[1:05:23] of being righteous?
[1:05:25] Now, we can have thoughts of being good,
[1:05:28] right?
[1:05:29] Right. You know,
[1:05:32] we can have thoughts of being good. We
[1:05:34] should do that.
[1:05:36] You know, I mean, we're Christians.
[1:05:40] We're supposed to be happy. We're
[1:05:43] supposed to be, you know, people around
[1:05:45] us are supposed to know that we're
[1:05:48] Christians. You know, like I told you at
[1:05:51] work one time, and this was I was a
[1:05:53] Baptist then. And the lady, she said
[1:05:55] something about having a bad day. I
[1:05:57] said, "Oh, we all have them." She said,
[1:05:59] "SI, I'm going to work with you for
[1:06:00] about 4 years. I ain't never seen you
[1:06:03] have one yet."
[1:06:05] I said, "Well, thank you."
[1:06:08] Because why should we be? Now we can
[1:06:12] think about we ought to be good.
[1:06:15] But still none of that will save us,
[1:06:17] right?
[1:06:17] Amen.
[1:06:20] None of those things will save us.
[1:06:25] But they can be an outward manifestation
[1:06:28] of an inward work.
[1:06:31] Right.
[1:06:33] to be good, to do good, and act right is
[1:06:36] supposed to be a outward manifestation.
[1:06:42] But there's no way that you and I
[1:06:46] could ever think about being perfect,
[1:06:51] of being righteous, of being right.
[1:06:53] Right?
[1:06:58] So then what are we going to do?
[1:07:03] It's required of us.
[1:07:06] Well, like I said, he just he he didn't
[1:07:08] really mean that. He he just just saying
[1:07:11] that try to make you scared a little
[1:07:13] bit. Now, we don't try to scare nobody
[1:07:15] into heaven because it won't do no good
[1:07:16] anyway.
[1:07:17] That's right.
[1:07:19] It ain't going to scare nobody into
[1:07:20] heaven. You can preach hellfireing it
[1:07:22] hot every service, whatever. You're not
[1:07:24] going to scare anybody out of hell.
[1:07:27] cuz you're going to hell by your own
[1:07:28] choice.
[1:07:30] Right?
[1:07:31] But now your prophet said
[1:07:35] that we've got to be perfect to go to
[1:07:37] heaven.
[1:07:39] Now there was a doctrine years ago
[1:07:41] started I'll just bring this out while
[1:07:42] I'm at it. But there was a doctrine
[1:07:44] years ago started out that was called no
[1:07:46] Holy Ghost doctrine. And they said that
[1:07:49] you you had to have all of these virtues
[1:07:52] in you and that the headstone would
[1:07:54] finally be your new birth.
[1:07:57] And uh their point was that
[1:08:01] nobody could go. And brother Brandham
[1:08:03] went beyond the curtain of time. He said
[1:08:04] there's nothing there but perfection.
[1:08:08] And the brother kept making the
[1:08:09] statement that you know you got to be
[1:08:12] perfect to go there.
[1:08:14] So I agree with you.
[1:08:18] I agree with you. He said, "Well,
[1:08:20] there's nobody in this day outside of
[1:08:22] brother Brandon." Well, now that when he
[1:08:23] made that, he made a mistake
[1:08:28] because
[1:08:30] my brain computer began to calculate
[1:08:33] that brother Random saw
[1:08:36] millions there,
[1:08:38] right?
[1:08:43] But he didn't call no names. what the
[1:08:46] brother said. See, try to be smart.
[1:08:48] I was trying to be smart. We just being
[1:08:50] honest. So, I just pulled out a book and
[1:08:52] showed him where brother Brandham's
[1:08:55] first little girlfriend, he saw her over
[1:08:56] there.
[1:08:58] She was there.
[1:09:00] He said, "What about this lady here?"
[1:09:03] Said, "She was 90 years old when she was
[1:09:05] converted under your ministry."
[1:09:08] Said, "Look at her now."
[1:09:11] But you see,
[1:09:14] it doesn't make no difference whether it
[1:09:15] be the end of the world or what it be
[1:09:19] in the days of Martin Luther for you to
[1:09:22] be able to go to heaven required that
[1:09:24] you be perfect.
[1:09:25] Right?
[1:09:27] The days of John Wesley, I'm just using
[1:09:30] those because people use those times as,
[1:09:34] you know, saying they didn't have
[1:09:35] nothing. Let's see. The book of Acts,
[1:09:38] they had to be perfect, right?
[1:09:41] to go to heaven.
[1:09:42] Amen.
[1:09:43] If anybody ever goes to heaven, you're
[1:09:45] going to be perfect.
[1:09:46] Amen.
[1:09:47] Now, a white throne is not in heaven.
[1:09:49] So, don't go thinking wrong.
[1:09:54] White throne, people will be made
[1:09:56] perfect to be able to enter there in
[1:10:00] enter you into the joys of the Lord. But
[1:10:02] now, remember, we're not supposed to be
[1:10:04] talking about going to the white throne
[1:10:06] judgment,
[1:10:06] right?
[1:10:07] And get our perfection. We're supposed
[1:10:09] to be talking about that our perfection
[1:10:12] has got to be revealed to us now.
[1:10:16] Because I believe it this way, you got
[1:10:18] to be as perfect here as there is
[1:10:20] perfection in heaven. Cuz that's the
[1:10:23] matching pieces I preached about 10
[1:10:24] years ago on
[1:10:27] when it matches up, brother Dick. What
[1:10:29] we are here with what we are there, we
[1:10:32] going there.
[1:10:32] Amen.
[1:10:34] True. Y
[1:10:36] that's a simple point.
[1:10:38] So it's based upon you and I, right?
[1:10:44] But then God required that we be
[1:10:46] perfect.
[1:10:48] That's right.
[1:10:49] Now, how can we start the fact of even
[1:10:51] thinking about it?
[1:10:54] Don't worry about it.
[1:10:56] You get one thing straightened out real
[1:10:58] good. It's what I've always tried to
[1:11:00] tell everybody. You work on one thing at
[1:11:01] a time cuz once you get that
[1:11:03] straightened out, you do pretty good.
[1:11:04] But as quick as you get that
[1:11:05] straightened out, devil's going to have
[1:11:07] another one.
[1:11:09] You know,
[1:11:10] you may quit this or quit that, quit
[1:11:12] lying, quit stealing, what you may quit
[1:11:14] all that, but then he's going to have
[1:11:16] something he going to throw in front of
[1:11:17] you.
[1:11:19] If it's nothing but an oldfashioned
[1:11:20] preacher talking about going to the
[1:11:22] bathroom, he's going to figure out
[1:11:24] something to put in front of you.
[1:11:28] But now listen,
[1:11:30] as I said, we asked, we believe that God
[1:11:32] sent us a prophet. Amen.
[1:11:35] And believing it that way, then we don't
[1:11:38] have no problem. We just ask him,
[1:11:40] right?
[1:11:40] You remember what we done the other day,
[1:11:42] brother Brandham? What is the new birth?
[1:11:46] So, we read what he said.
[1:11:49] We done that in the ministers meeting
[1:11:50] one time cuz that was what it was on.
[1:11:52] And I just took about four quotes, ones
[1:11:55] we use here, and I just laid it out
[1:11:57] there and I just read it. I said, "Okay,
[1:11:58] now that's my five minutes." You know,
[1:12:00] right?
[1:12:03] I just read it.
[1:12:06] I said, ' Now you can argue about what
[1:12:07] this is and what that is, but the
[1:12:10] prophet just told you what the new birth
[1:12:12] is,
[1:12:12] right?
[1:12:14] So now, Brother Random, how can we have
[1:12:17] any thoughts about going to heaven and
[1:12:20] being perfect? All right, look at number
[1:12:22] three on your notes. Everybody knows
[1:12:24] these quotes, but a lot of them out
[1:12:25] there don't know them, maybe, but
[1:12:28] you should know them.
[1:12:34] How can a man say that the bride of
[1:12:36] Christ goes into the tribulation?
[1:12:39] I can't understand it. See, she took
[1:12:42] away from the tribulation.
[1:12:43] Amen.
[1:12:45] If the church has been judged and they
[1:12:47] have judged themselves and have accepted
[1:12:50] the blood, how can God judge a man
[1:12:53] that's perfectly totally sinless?
[1:12:56] You supposed to say there's no such
[1:12:58] person.
[1:13:00] ever born again believer. That's right.
[1:13:02] True believer is perfectly absolutely
[1:13:05] sinless before God.
[1:13:06] Amen.
[1:13:09] He's not trusting in his works
[1:13:13] in the blood of Jesus. That's his
[1:13:15] confessions dropped in two.
[1:13:17] The Bible said so. See, he that that is
[1:13:19] born of God does not commit sin for he
[1:13:22] cannot sin. Amen.
[1:13:24] How can you make a man a sinner when the
[1:13:26] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:13:28] between him and God? That would scatter
[1:13:31] sin till there be nothing left of it.
[1:13:35] See, how can that pure blood of Christ
[1:13:38] ever let a sin pass there? You cannot.
[1:13:41] Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even
[1:13:43] as your father in heaven is perfect."
[1:13:46] And how could we ever start the thought
[1:13:48] of being perfect? But Jesus required it.
[1:13:53] And if Jesus required it, he's got to
[1:13:55] make a way for it.
[1:13:59] He has
[1:14:01] his own blood.
[1:14:02] Right.
[1:14:03] Amen.
[1:14:06] Now,
[1:14:08] how are you perfect
[1:14:14] within yourself? No. No.
[1:14:19] cuz the best we could do wouldn't be no
[1:14:22] good.
[1:14:24] But through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:14:29] that's the only way you can think about
[1:14:31] being perfect
[1:14:33] is through the perfect blood.
[1:14:35] So if you have accepted the blood of
[1:14:38] Jesus Christ, if you have accepted Jesus
[1:14:40] Christ as your savior and he's given you
[1:14:43] the new birth now,
[1:14:50] Then it's impossible for you to be a
[1:14:52] sinner and a saint.
[1:14:55] That's right.
[1:15:00] It's impossible.
[1:15:02] Right.
[1:15:03] It's all right. He's made a way.
[1:15:06] He said, "I know that it's through his
[1:15:09] blood."
[1:15:11] But just remember now
[1:15:15] that through that blood also at this
[1:15:18] present time there is no one a sinner.
[1:15:22] Right.
[1:15:22] Right.
[1:15:23] Did you know that?
[1:15:24] That's right.
[1:15:26] Amen.
[1:15:28] There's no one a sinner
[1:15:31] because the bumper blood covers
[1:15:34] the whole world.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:36] Right.
[1:15:37] If he seen our sin, he would kill us.
[1:15:39] Right.
[1:15:39] Amen.
[1:15:40] Right. So would it be with anybody
[1:15:45] now?
[1:15:47] So there's no sin there
[1:15:51] because he's looking through the blood
[1:15:54] at you and I
[1:15:57] look through red at red and you see
[1:15:58] white.
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:02] Look through the crimson and blood of
[1:16:03] the Lord Jesus.
[1:16:05] When he dropped that blood down, he made
[1:16:07] a bumper blood for the whole world.
[1:16:10] No,
[1:16:13] but who wants to depend upon it as just
[1:16:16] a covering?
[1:16:19] Because see, one day
[1:16:22] that covering will be removed,
[1:16:25] right?
[1:16:26] That's why tribulation sets in. See,
[1:16:28] tribulation, why the bride doesn't go to
[1:16:30] the tribulation is because tribulation
[1:16:32] is a wrath of God poured out upon the
[1:16:35] world for rejecting Jesus Christ.
[1:16:39] That's right. Amen.
[1:16:41] That's why there'll be a tribulation.
[1:16:44] Amen.
[1:16:45] But see, when the bride leaves out of
[1:16:47] here,
[1:16:49] the blood of Jesus Christ is gone. And
[1:16:52] the only ones that can depend upon any
[1:16:54] form of the blood is the 144,000.
[1:17:01] Cuz he goes to dealing with them.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:04] All right.
[1:17:05] But you see what I'm saying now?
[1:17:08] The prophet said he's made a way
[1:17:12] through his own blood.
[1:17:16] Now, if we don't accept that, remember a
[1:17:20] pardon is not a pardon
[1:17:23] unless received as one.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:27] But now, if we don't accept Jesus Christ
[1:17:29] as our savior,
[1:17:32] then where are we?
[1:17:36] We're still lost.
[1:17:38] We're just like the rest of the people
[1:17:40] being protected by the blood.
[1:17:46] Well, brother Dale, I just really don't
[1:17:47] know whether I'm saved or not. Well, the
[1:17:50] prophet said that was the most important
[1:17:52] thing in the world.
[1:17:54] Right.
[1:17:54] Right.
[1:17:56] So, I would spend the rest of my life
[1:18:00] praying,
[1:18:01] for God to reveal to me that I'm saved.
[1:18:05] Right.
[1:18:06] Well, I just take it by faith. That's
[1:18:08] all right. But be careful because that's
[1:18:11] what they wanted to do in the book of
[1:18:13] Acts
[1:18:15] before the Holy Ghost fell.
[1:18:18] They wanted to just take it by faith and
[1:18:20] walk out.
[1:18:22] Somebody had enough Bryce to say, "Hold
[1:18:25] it."
[1:18:27] It's not been fulfilled what Jesus said.
[1:18:32] Well, you know yourself, we're still a
[1:18:33] bunch of scared chickens,
[1:18:35] right?
[1:18:36] And he said they'd be power from heaven
[1:18:41] and it's not come yet.
[1:18:44] What good would it have done them to
[1:18:45] walk out by faith?
[1:18:52] But you understand what I'm getting at
[1:18:54] now?
[1:18:55] God made a way.
[1:18:58] But if we don't accept that way,
[1:19:01] right?
[1:19:06] Then where are we?
[1:19:09] See, but we can say like I said the
[1:19:11] other day, we can talk about we can say,
[1:19:13] but look what all I've done. I've
[1:19:14] shouted. I've spoke in tongue. I've
[1:19:16] believed the message. I've done that.
[1:19:18] I've done this. I've done that. I've
[1:19:20] seen this. Seen that.
[1:19:23] Paul said you can do every bit of that
[1:19:26] not be born again. That's
[1:19:27] right.
[1:19:32] What can we depend upon then?
[1:19:35] Like I was saying the other day,
[1:19:38] all we can depend upon is whether or not
[1:19:40] we've got the new birth.
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:43] Cuz we're not born again. He's not
[1:19:46] responsible. That's
[1:19:48] right. Yeah.
[1:19:51] Mhm.
[1:19:53] Because we turn it down.
[1:19:56] We see he made a way, but we must accept
[1:19:58] that way.
[1:19:59] Right.
[1:20:01] Now listen,
[1:20:03] as I said a moment ago about what Eve
[1:20:05] said in the garden.
[1:20:11] She thought she was getting by. And
[1:20:14] brother Brandham said, "Even after,"
[1:20:17] now you think about it, "Even after what
[1:20:21] had happened in the garden,
[1:20:24] the thing that had took place,
[1:20:29] she still thought she was right." That's
[1:20:30] right.
[1:20:35] She still thought she was right.
[1:20:38] She thought she was helping God do what
[1:20:41] he wanted done. Yeah.
[1:20:43] Could we be that way?
[1:20:48] Could we believe be to the places that
[1:20:50] we believe that we're so righteous or so
[1:20:52] something?
[1:20:58] I'm going to get down to something in a
[1:20:59] minute. All right. Just hold on to it.
[1:21:02] Look at the next one. Number four in
[1:21:03] your notes. Israel at the Red Sea.
[1:21:05] Number one,
[1:21:07] 53 326.
[1:21:12] Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect
[1:21:14] even as your father in heaven is
[1:21:15] perfect."
[1:21:18] How could you ever be perfect? Listen.
[1:21:21] But in the sight of Christ tonight,
[1:21:24] every bornag again Christian is perfect.
[1:21:34] I'm just as perfect in God as Christ
[1:21:36] was.
[1:21:38] You are too. every other believer.
[1:21:42] Now, that don't mean ever other
[1:21:44] believer.
[1:21:45] All right? You know, like you got one
[1:21:47] and two and ever.
[1:21:49] All right.
[1:21:52] Sorry for being carnal, but I just read
[1:21:54] that away.
[1:21:58] For it's not my holiness, it's his
[1:22:00] holiness.
[1:22:02] God can't accept mine. I have none.
[1:22:06] But I come in Christ by faith and by
[1:22:09] Christ by Christ I'm in him and perfect
[1:22:14] in the sight of God.
[1:22:17] He said, "Well, Brother Dale, I believe
[1:22:18] that."
[1:22:20] Do we
[1:22:23] do we really believe
[1:22:26] that by being born again
[1:22:31] that you're just as perfect as God is?
[1:22:33] Amen.
[1:22:36] See, now it flops on the other side of
[1:22:37] the coin, doesn't it?
[1:22:39] Right?
[1:22:39] Because now you'll start condemning
[1:22:41] yourself. Whereas a moment ago, you was
[1:22:43] upgrading yourself and saying, "Come on.
[1:22:46] Come on. We're perfect because we're in
[1:22:48] Jesus Christ. Now we come over the
[1:22:51] hump." And what's the devil doing?
[1:22:52] Trying to put you back on the other
[1:22:54] side,
[1:22:55] right?
[1:22:57] Cuz you know what he's saying?
[1:22:59] Well, in a way, you're perfect.
[1:23:04] Now you're making God a liar and you're
[1:23:05] making the prophet a liar.
[1:23:07] Amen.
[1:23:12] Come on.
[1:23:15] If you say you're not as perfect as
[1:23:16] Jesus Christ is
[1:23:20] by the new birth, we went through that.
[1:23:24] That's not dealing with anything of your
[1:23:26] righteousness.
[1:23:30] It's dealing of what God says.
[1:23:35] Okay, let's keep reading.
[1:23:42] Law 1955
[1:23:45] 115 number five on your notes.
[1:23:48] Now the blood could not be perfect by an
[1:23:51] animal,
[1:23:55] but the blood in Christ was perfect.
[1:23:58] Amen.
[1:23:59] Now, I will never be perfect.
[1:24:03] And you will never be perfect.
[1:24:07] I will never be perfect in your sight.
[1:24:12] You will never be perfect in my sight.
[1:24:21] You agree with that?
[1:24:23] I do.
[1:24:27] Look, but let's lay that aside.
[1:24:31] Now, I emphasize that by making little
[1:24:34] knots around, you know, little things
[1:24:36] around it.
[1:24:37] What about in God's sight?
[1:24:40] I look at you as a human. I look at you
[1:24:43] as a brother. But God looks at you
[1:24:46] through the blood of his son as a
[1:24:47] redeemed one. Jesus said, "Be therefore
[1:24:50] perfect, even as your father in heaven
[1:24:52] is perfect." And now what you've now not
[1:24:57] not what you've done you have nothing to
[1:25:00] merit it but it's what Christ did for
[1:25:03] you. That's right.
[1:25:08] My brother has so many problem. Okay.
[1:25:09] Let's read the next one then. Water of
[1:25:12] separation 55121.
[1:25:15] God looking through the blood. He
[1:25:16] doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He
[1:25:19] sees you redeemed. Amen.
[1:25:22] You're redeemed because he's all always
[1:25:24] sees you through
[1:25:27] Christ.
[1:25:27] Amen.
[1:25:28] That's the reason we can be perfect.
[1:25:31] Now, what'd he say? Not perfect in the
[1:25:34] sense of sinless.
[1:25:39] Now, we don't went through that. Why?
[1:25:40] Because Christians sin
[1:25:42] and we must repent,
[1:25:45] right?
[1:25:47] We're perfect in the eyes of God when
[1:25:49] we're in Christ. That's the reason he
[1:25:52] said, "Be therefore perfect even as your
[1:25:53] father in heaven is perfect." Goes on
[1:25:56] telling about Paul speaking of
[1:25:57] perfection comes by Jesus. Now I'm not
[1:25:59] perfect in your sight. You may not be
[1:26:02] perfect in my sight, but what about in
[1:26:04] God's sight? There's where it lays. And
[1:26:06] if you're born again into the body of
[1:26:09] Christ, then God looks upon you as a per
[1:26:12] as perfect as Christ was himself.
[1:26:15] Amen. goes on to say, "You got to accept
[1:26:18] it.
[1:26:21] You got to accept it."
[1:26:24] Lounge Book of Life 56 603 number 7.
[1:26:28] Now, you got to be perfect. Jesus said,
[1:26:30] "Be therefore perfect, even as your
[1:26:31] father in heaven is perfect." Now, how
[1:26:33] are you going to be when you're
[1:26:35] continually sinning when you're
[1:26:37] continually doing what's wrong?
[1:26:40] Now, this will kind of put a little kink
[1:26:42] in the legalist. See, legalists believe
[1:26:44] that if you you sin, you're going to
[1:26:46] hell.
[1:26:48] In other words, that's legalistic.
[1:26:50] Calvinist goes on the other side and
[1:26:52] said, "It don't make no difference what
[1:26:53] I do. I'm going to heaven anyway." Both
[1:26:55] of them wrong cuz neither one of them
[1:26:58] line up.
[1:27:01] This will kind of put a little kink in
[1:27:02] the legalist, but notice it isn't what
[1:27:04] you do, it's what God has done. It's not
[1:27:08] what you do, it's what he It's what he
[1:27:11] done.
[1:27:13] See, you can't be perfect. You can't be
[1:27:16] in yourself, but in Christ, you're
[1:27:19] perfected.
[1:27:20] You're not trusting in your own good
[1:27:22] works or your own church you belong to,
[1:27:24] but you're trusting in the shed blood of
[1:27:26] the Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, there you
[1:27:29] are. That's what makes you perfect.
[1:27:32] That's what anchors you in faith.
[1:27:39] So, he's made us perfect if we accept
[1:27:40] it.
[1:27:43] But can we really believe that?
[1:27:48] Can we really believe God has made us
[1:27:50] perfect?
[1:27:54] Heaven, help us to try to think about
[1:27:57] anything we could do or not do.
[1:28:04] And heaven, help us to not think about
[1:28:06] that it has something to do with what
[1:28:08] you do or not do.
[1:28:10] Because if we have problems, we must
[1:28:12] confess them.
[1:28:15] Cuz there's no sacrifice for a sin that
[1:28:18] you sin after you're a Christian.
[1:28:22] You must repent.
[1:28:24] I've done been through that.
[1:28:27] But that doesn't mean you're going to be
[1:28:28] lost.
[1:28:29] No,
[1:28:31] you can't be saved and lost at the same
[1:28:34] time.
[1:28:35] But do we believe what God says? Five
[1:28:38] identification 196911
[1:28:41] evening service. You talking about not
[1:28:43] by one handshake or anything like that.
[1:28:46] Not by one church letter but by one
[1:28:48] spirit Holy Spirit. Jew, Gentile,
[1:28:51] yellow, black, white. Have all you been
[1:28:53] baptized by one? Have all been baptized
[1:28:56] by one spirit into that one body through
[1:28:59] the blood of his own covenant?
[1:29:02] And when I see the blood, I pass over
[1:29:04] you and you are free from death, free
[1:29:07] from pain, free from sin. He that's born
[1:29:10] of God does not commit sin
[1:29:14] because the seed of God remains in him
[1:29:16] and he cannot sin. No sir, be therefore
[1:29:20] perfect even as your father, heavenly
[1:29:22] father is perfect. Jesus said, how can
[1:29:25] you be perfect? Then Jesus said he said,
[1:29:28] how can you be perfect? You can't do it.
[1:29:32] You was born in sin, seed in iniquity,
[1:29:34] come to the world speaking lies. But
[1:29:36] when you accepted Christ as your sin
[1:29:38] barrier, when you accept him by faith
[1:29:41] and and you believe that he saved you
[1:29:44] and he died in your place and took your
[1:29:46] sins, then God accepts you and baptizes
[1:29:49] you into the body and cannot see no more
[1:29:51] sin.
[1:29:52] How can I be a sinner when there's an
[1:29:54] atonement
[1:29:55] on the altar for me?
[1:29:58] How can I be
[1:30:04] How can I do it when
[1:30:06] I'm depending on what he said?
[1:30:11] Look at number nine on your notes.
[1:30:15] Things that are to be 1965 120 5. He's
[1:30:19] gone to prepare a place, a perfect place
[1:30:21] where no evil exists, no sickness
[1:30:22] exists, no old age exists, no death
[1:30:25] exists. It's a perfect place calling you
[1:30:28] to that perfection and you have to be
[1:30:30] perfect to get there. The Bible said so.
[1:30:33] Jesus said, "Be therefore perfect even
[1:30:35] as your father in heaven is perfect."
[1:30:37] It's a perfect kingdom. So, it must be a
[1:30:40] perfect people come because you have to
[1:30:43] stand and be married to a perfect son of
[1:30:45] God.
[1:30:46] And you you must be a perfect bride. How
[1:30:50] can you do it through anything? Through
[1:30:54] anything else but the perfect word of
[1:30:56] God, which is the waters of separation
[1:30:58] that washes us from our sins. Amen.
[1:31:01] That's right. The blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:03] Think of it. The dripping bloody
[1:31:06] dripping bloody word. Amen. The blood
[1:31:09] the the word of God. Bleeding blood to
[1:31:12] wash the bride in. Amen. Yes, sir. She
[1:31:16] stands perfect, virgin, unadulterated.
[1:31:19] She never sinned in the first place.
[1:31:21] Amen. She was trapped into it. See,
[1:31:24] there's the father's house that he's
[1:31:25] gone to prepare.
[1:31:28] Now, in these last couple of quotes,
[1:31:32] did you notice I slowed down just a hair
[1:31:36] because of what I was reading?
[1:31:41] He's talking about the new birth,
[1:31:43] right? Amen. That's right. And then he's
[1:31:45] talking about
[1:31:47] healing,
[1:31:50] sickness.
[1:32:00] Now,
[1:32:03] do you believe that
[1:32:06] Jesus Christ died for your sins?
[1:32:07] Amen. Yeah.
[1:32:11] Amen.
[1:32:17] Do you believe that he's a healer?
[1:32:26] I won't get through this tonight.
[1:32:29] Hit a little of it.
[1:32:33] If you accept the fact
[1:32:39] that Jesus Christ died for you,
[1:32:45] you have no choice.
[1:32:48] I emphasize no choice
[1:32:52] than to believe
[1:32:56] that you're healed. Amen. Right.
[1:33:05] Because
[1:33:08] there are seven compound names of
[1:33:10] Jehovah.
[1:33:13] You remember
[1:33:15] it's in your quotes down below there
[1:33:19] when brother Bosus was discussing divine
[1:33:21] healing with that Dr. Bess.
[1:33:25] Oh, Dr. Bess was a good Baptist guy that
[1:33:27] was going to put him down and show that
[1:33:29] there was no healing or anything. and
[1:33:31] run around told Dr. Bosworth said, "Now
[1:33:34] you can go."
[1:33:35] Yeah.
[1:33:36] But don't argue with him.
[1:33:39] He said, "I'm not going to argue with
[1:33:41] him."
[1:33:44] So he was going to show the world that
[1:33:46] this old man was wrong about divine
[1:33:48] healing.
[1:33:50] What was the question brother Bodsworth
[1:33:52] asked the man?
[1:33:55] He said, "Sir, I want to just ask you
[1:33:56] one question."
[1:34:00] He said, "Does the seven compound names
[1:34:02] of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ?
[1:34:08] Yes or no?"
[1:34:12] The man would not answer him. He was
[1:34:14] educated
[1:34:16] and he knew that he was trapped and he
[1:34:18] would not answer him.
[1:34:22] Because you see, even Dr. best believed
[1:34:27] that he was a savior.
[1:34:32] So, brother Bosworth had him over a
[1:34:34] barrel. If he's a savior,
[1:34:36] Yep.
[1:34:39] then
[1:34:42] if the seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:34:44] apply to Jesus Christ,
[1:34:46] then he's got to be a healer.
[1:34:48] So, he had him trapped. He didn't have
[1:34:50] to ask him no more questions. The
[1:34:52] meeting was over as far as concerned.
[1:34:53] Sure. You remember Dr. Best jumped up
[1:34:56] and oh he run around preaching about
[1:34:58] this that and the other and all and
[1:35:00] shaking his fist. You remember there was
[1:35:02] no picture taken.
[1:35:03] That's right.
[1:35:03] He ordered a photographer to take all
[1:35:05] the pictures.
[1:35:07] But when brother Brandham came down out
[1:35:09] of the up in the top and came down, he
[1:35:12] run up there one more time wanted to
[1:35:13] shake his fist
[1:35:16] and wouldn't
[1:35:18] that was a picture of angel the Lord.
[1:35:19] The old light Christ came.
[1:35:21] Amen. That's right. to prove what was
[1:35:23] right.
[1:35:25] But I'm just asking you a simple
[1:35:26] question.
[1:35:30] If you believe he's a healer,
[1:35:32] you must believe that he's a savior.
[1:35:35] I'm not going to go through those. I'll
[1:35:38] get back to it. But first John 2 and1
[1:35:41] says
[1:35:44] that we have an advocate.
[1:35:46] Amen. If we sin,
[1:35:49] we have an advocate which is Jesus
[1:35:52] Christ the righteous.
[1:35:56] Now,
[1:35:58] one of those names
[1:36:01] of Jehovah is Jehovah Tiskanu.
[1:36:05] Now, there's two different ways of
[1:36:08] spelling that word
[1:36:11] and it is used in Strongs two different
[1:36:14] ways.
[1:36:17] But it has the same meaning.
[1:36:20] One of them ends up with a W, the other
[1:36:22] one ends up with a U.
[1:36:26] But you say, "Well, Brother Dale, what
[1:36:28] does that got to do with this?"
[1:36:35] If he's our healer,
[1:36:38] then he must also be our savior.
[1:36:42] If he's our savior,
[1:36:46] he must be our righteousness.
[1:36:48] Amen.
[1:36:49] Now, what was our point? The prophet was
[1:36:51] saying we must be just as righteous
[1:36:56] as God is to go to heaven.
[1:37:00] Now, how are we going to ever do that?
[1:37:03] So, we must accept his righteousness,
[1:37:05] right?
[1:37:05] You remember what the Bible says about
[1:37:07] ours, don't you? Yeah,
[1:37:09] they're filthy rags. Our righteousness.
[1:37:13] So even if we're right, we're still
[1:37:15] wrong
[1:37:17] cuz it wouldn't do us any good.
[1:37:20] But we accept what he done.
[1:37:26] You'll say, "But brother Dale,
[1:37:29] I've accepted what he done for me."
[1:37:33] All right, let's read one more.
[1:37:37] Look at number 9A on your notes there.
[1:37:41] Page 31 of the church age book.
[1:37:48] No man knows the things of God say the
[1:37:50] spirit of God and to who he to whom the
[1:37:52] spirit of God reveals. We need to call
[1:37:55] on God for revelation more than anything
[1:37:57] else in the world. We have accepted the
[1:38:01] Bible.
[1:38:02] We have accepted the great truths of it.
[1:38:06] But it is still but it still is not real
[1:38:10] to most people because the revelation by
[1:38:13] the spirit is not there.
[1:38:17] The word has not been quickened.
[1:38:21] The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[1:38:25] that we have become the righteousness of
[1:38:27] God by our union with Jesus Christ.
[1:38:30] Right?
[1:38:33] Did you get it?
[1:38:35] It says that we are the righteousness of
[1:38:38] God himself
[1:38:40] by being in Christ.
[1:38:42] It says that he Jesus
[1:38:46] became sin for us.
[1:38:48] It does not say he became sinful
[1:38:52] but became sin for us that by our union
[1:38:56] with him we might become the
[1:38:58] righteousness of God.
[1:39:02] If we accept the fact and we must listen
[1:39:07] that he literally became sin
[1:39:10] for us by his substitution for us. Now
[1:39:14] do you believe that?
[1:39:17] Amen.
[1:39:17] Do you believe that God Almighty come
[1:39:20] down in human flesh upon this earth and
[1:39:23] gave his life
[1:39:26] to pay the price for sin?
[1:39:29] Do you believe that?
[1:39:30] Amen.
[1:39:31] Amen. Now listen to it.
[1:39:35] If we accept the fact and we must that
[1:39:37] he literally becomes sin for us by his
[1:39:39] substitution for us, then we must also
[1:39:44] accept the fact that we by our union
[1:39:47] with him have become the very
[1:39:49] righteousness of God.
[1:39:55] Now you believe he come paid the price,
[1:39:58] right? Even the Baptist preached that.
[1:40:01] See, you understand why he's using that?
[1:40:03] Dr. Bess believed
[1:40:08] in Jehovah Gyra,
[1:40:10] the Lord's provided sacrifice,
[1:40:17] but he didn't believe in Jehovah Rafi
[1:40:19] that I am the Lord that heal all of thy
[1:40:21] diseases.
[1:40:23] So now are we in that situation
[1:40:27] that we believe
[1:40:29] that he died for sin?
[1:40:34] Do we believe he ever existed?
[1:40:38] Do we believe that this man Jesus was
[1:40:41] ever even in the world?
[1:40:44] Then why did he come into the world?
[1:40:48] And do we believe that he died?
[1:40:52] Amen.
[1:40:53] Do we believe he died for us?
[1:40:59] To ever be a Christian, you got to
[1:41:01] accept it that way.
[1:41:02] Amen.
[1:41:04] Get away from how good you think you was
[1:41:07] that he saved you cuz you didn't do
[1:41:09] something.
[1:41:10] That's
[1:41:10] right. Amen.
[1:41:15] Get on to the basis of just saying,
[1:41:16] "Thank you, Lord."
[1:41:18] For saving my soul.
[1:41:20] Amen.
[1:41:22] Now, do you believe it?
[1:41:27] Let's read it again.
[1:41:31] If we accept the fact, and we must, that
[1:41:33] he literally became sin for us by his
[1:41:36] substitution for us, then we must also
[1:41:39] accept the fact that we by our union
[1:41:42] with him have become the very
[1:41:44] righteousness of God.
[1:41:47] Amen.
[1:41:48] Now you believe you're just as righteous
[1:41:50] as God is by the new birth.
[1:41:52] Listen, to reject one
[1:41:57] is to reject the other.
[1:42:04] To accept the one
[1:42:08] is to accept the other.
[1:42:16] If we reject
[1:42:18] that he come into the world and died for
[1:42:20] our sins, then we automatically reject
[1:42:23] that he's our righteousness.
[1:42:27] But if we think that there's some way
[1:42:29] that can we can become righteous outside
[1:42:31] of the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:42:34] then we're totally rejecting his
[1:42:36] righteousness.
[1:42:38] We certainly don't have any of our own.
[1:42:39] Right.
[1:42:42] You see, I'm coming back to the seven
[1:42:45] compound names. But
[1:42:48] see,
[1:42:50] Dr. Best refused to answer
[1:42:54] because he knew that if he said he was
[1:42:56] Jehovah Gyra,
[1:43:00] then he would have to admit that he was
[1:43:02] Jehovah Rafa. That's
[1:43:03] right.
[1:43:07] Now, I'm saying to you and I tonight, if
[1:43:09] we believe that he was Jehovah Gyra that
[1:43:12] come into the world to die for our sins,
[1:43:16] we must believe that he is Jehovah Rafi,
[1:43:19] the Lord who health all of our our
[1:43:21] diseases.
[1:43:23] Not a hard thing to accept that. Then we
[1:43:26] must believe that he is Jehovah Tishkan,
[1:43:31] which means our righteousness.
[1:43:38] You see, to accept one is to accept the
[1:43:40] other. To reject one is to reject the
[1:43:44] other.
[1:43:46] Now, we know the Bible says that it
[1:43:49] can't be denied. But the revelation of
[1:43:52] it is missing. It is not real to the
[1:43:55] majority of God's children. It's just a
[1:43:57] good verse in the Bible. But we need to
[1:44:00] have it made alive to us. That will take
[1:44:02] revelation.
[1:44:08] That will take revelation. I'm not going
[1:44:10] into the the others. You keep those
[1:44:11] notes, but I'll bring them back
[1:44:14] next time I minister on be on the seven
[1:44:18] compound names of Jehovah.
[1:44:20] But just get my point.
[1:44:24] If he's Jehovah Gyra,
[1:44:29] if we believe he come into the world to
[1:44:32] die for sin,
[1:44:35] then we must believe
[1:44:38] that if we accept him as our savior
[1:44:41] that we're just as righteous as he is.
[1:44:44] Amen. Cuz if we reject the fact that
[1:44:47] we're not as righteous as he is,
[1:44:50] then you automatically reject the fact
[1:44:52] that he died for you.
[1:44:54] Simple.
[1:44:58] That should not need a great banging
[1:44:59] over the head for a great revelation.
[1:45:04] Should just be simple. Amen.
[1:45:08] If you believe that he died for your
[1:45:10] sins, why would you not believe?
[1:45:14] about him wiping away those sins that
[1:45:17] you're right. Why wouldn't you believe
[1:45:19] that
[1:45:22] you're right and the fact that you
[1:45:23] didn't do it? That's right.
[1:45:26] I gave you the quote where brother said
[1:45:28] we was trapped into it. Where? In the
[1:45:30] garden by mom and daddy.
[1:45:36] We was trapped in this situation we're
[1:45:37] in.
[1:45:39] But we'll never get out of here
[1:45:42] thinking that there's something we've
[1:45:44] got to do
[1:45:46] other than accepting what he's already
[1:45:49] done.
[1:45:52] Brother Dell, you mean that we don't
[1:45:53] have to live right? No, we don't have to
[1:45:55] live right.
[1:45:56] That's right.
[1:45:56] I'll plainly tell you that way.
[1:45:59] But I'll tell you, every born again
[1:46:00] Christian wants to live right.
[1:46:02] Now, you put yourself in which category.
[1:46:04] That's right.
[1:46:09] I don't have to preach to go to heaven.
[1:46:13] That's right.
[1:46:14] Cuz it's not based upon my preaching.
[1:46:18] But rewards come by what I'm doing.
[1:46:23] See,
[1:46:26] salvation is what God does. Works is
[1:46:29] what I do
[1:46:31] in thanks
[1:46:34] that he's given unto me.
[1:46:36] What else could we say it?
[1:46:40] But I hope you understand the
[1:46:41] connection.
[1:46:44] The brother Bass could not say a word
[1:46:47] because he was trapped. Even brother
[1:46:49] Brandham said, you remember what he said
[1:46:51] about it? He said, "I never even thought
[1:46:54] of that myself."
[1:46:55] Mhm.
[1:46:58] He had the man trapped because if he
[1:47:00] admitted that he was Jehovah Gyra, he
[1:47:03] would have to admit that he was Jehovah
[1:47:04] Rafa.
[1:47:08] If we admit that he's Jehovah Gyra, we
[1:47:11] must admit that he's Jehovah.
[1:47:14] Now, if I pronounce that wrong, you get
[1:47:16] it all straight.
[1:47:22] But you see it means our righteousness.
[1:47:26] We don't have any righteousness.
[1:47:29] It's his righteousness imparted to you
[1:47:31] and I.
[1:47:32] Right. Amen.
[1:47:33] Why? Because we accepted him as Jehovah
[1:47:36] Gyra.
[1:47:37] Yes.
[1:47:40] We accepted the fact that he died in our
[1:47:42] place.
[1:47:44] Hallelujah.
[1:47:46] And we accept that he died in our place.
[1:47:49] Then
[1:47:52] I accept the fact that I'm just as
[1:47:53] righteous as he is. Well, brother Dale,
[1:47:56] I seen you. I read you the quotes. Your
[1:47:58] prophet said he's not talking about
[1:48:00] sinlessness. Sinlessness.
[1:48:04] He said, "In my eyes, you're not right.
[1:48:06] In your eyes, I'm not right."
[1:48:09] We don't read one-sided view. That's why
[1:48:11] people don't like the way I preach. They
[1:48:14] want to hear one side. Oh, look how
[1:48:16] righteous we are. Look how righteous we
[1:48:17] are. Amen. and I believe it.
[1:48:21] But then when you turn around and say,
[1:48:22] "They don't matter what I do, I'm
[1:48:24] righteous." Now then you got a problem
[1:48:27] with the word
[1:48:30] and you're denying what he says.
[1:48:34] He says our righteousness comes through
[1:48:37] accepting Jesus Christ.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:39] Right.
[1:48:41] Not what we do or don't do.
[1:48:43] Amen.
[1:48:44] What we do or don't do, I told you, is
[1:48:46] the limitations. It's not before you
[1:48:48] because salvation is of the Lord. Jonah
[1:48:51] 2 and9.
[1:48:53] But we must accept it.
[1:48:55] Right. Amen.
[1:48:56] He will not make us take it.
[1:48:59] Right.
[1:49:04] He won't force it on you.
[1:49:07] You got to accept it.
[1:49:11] But when you accept that he died for
[1:49:12] you.
[1:49:16] Now what is it? What was it done in the
[1:49:18] Old Testament? I'll end it.
[1:49:21] Man didn't just walk up to the high
[1:49:22] priest and say, "I sinned.
[1:49:27] Go back there and get me forgiveness."
[1:49:32] No.
[1:49:35] He brought something in his place.
[1:49:39] Right.
[1:49:40] He brought a lamb. He brought an animal
[1:49:43] in his place.
[1:49:44] Right. And when they slid his throat,
[1:49:46] your prophet said his hands was laying
[1:49:49] on that animal. Said blood splattering
[1:49:52] everywhere.
[1:49:56] Of course, back there that couldn't
[1:49:57] enter into the man to take anything away
[1:50:00] because it was not a soul of a human
[1:50:02] being. But Jesus was the very heart soul
[1:50:06] of God cuz he was almighty God. Right.
[1:50:12] See, that's what I'd say to people that
[1:50:14] believe that he didn't become God till
[1:50:16] the River Jordan. Well, then my Bible
[1:50:19] said he was Emanuel. So, that'd make him
[1:50:21] God.
[1:50:23] And that would be at least one of the
[1:50:24] seven compound. So, he'd have to be the
[1:50:27] rest of them.
[1:50:29] Amen.
[1:50:32] Amen.
[1:50:32] Cuz it can't just be one.
[1:50:37] If he's one, he's all of them.
[1:50:42] He's our banner. He's our all and all.
[1:50:46] He's our peace.
[1:50:48] All of those are throughout the Bible.
[1:50:53] But he's our savior.
[1:50:54] Amen.
[1:50:55] Go ahead, brother.
[1:50:59] Take on these things.
[1:51:02] Being ye therefore perfect,
[1:51:05] it's required.
[1:51:08] All right.
[1:51:10] Now,
[1:51:12] is the last illustration is what?
[1:51:15] If we were in a court of law today and
[1:51:18] they were trying us for murder
[1:51:25] and there before the judge that stands
[1:51:26] in the prosecuting attorneys proved you
[1:51:29] guilty. He's proved this that or the
[1:51:31] other.
[1:51:34] But you know if somebody walked in the
[1:51:36] door
[1:51:38] and said he's not guilty.
[1:51:42] That's right.
[1:51:43] Because I done it.
[1:51:47] You'd be tickled to death, wouldn't you?
[1:51:51] Right.
[1:51:56] Now, God didn't do the sinning,
[1:51:59] but he took our place.
[1:52:01] That's right.
[1:52:02] Wipe the slate clean.
[1:52:06] He's not guilty.
[1:52:09] You'd sure be tickled to death about
[1:52:10] slate being clean.
[1:52:12] Amen.
[1:52:13] But look what he's done for us.
[1:52:17] And I like that scripture there in in
[1:52:19] the communion. Even if I've done wrong,
[1:52:21] he'll condemn me and I'll straighten it
[1:52:23] up. Understand?
[1:52:26] Because where is my perfection? Comes by
[1:52:28] being in Jesus Christ.
[1:52:30] Amen.
[1:52:31] And I'm just as perfect as he is.
[1:52:34] When are we going to start saying that?
[1:52:36] Amen.
[1:52:41] And quit talking about our problems.
[1:52:45] God said, "What is the song?" I love
[1:52:46] that one. You know, what sin are you
[1:52:48] talking about?
[1:52:50] Somebody had a good point, didn't it?
[1:52:52] 138
[1:52:54] spiral book
[1:52:55] 138. Anybody have a need
[1:53:00] just come and let's believe and see.
[1:53:02] My hope is
[1:53:05] nothing.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:13] Can you believe your judge is righteous?
[1:53:19] You see, I'm not dependent upon
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] what I've done.
[1:53:27] My own dependence is upon what he done.
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:33] But I know that all I can do
[1:53:38] if I crawl all the way across the whole
[1:53:41] United States on my knees
[1:53:44] and all the way there.
[1:53:48] I was trying to do something to save me
[1:53:52] no good.
[1:53:55] But if I just simply believe
[1:53:58] what are you doing?
[1:54:02] Well, brother Dale,
[1:54:06] that makes it so loose. The
[1:54:08] prophet said one day,
[1:54:12] he said, I always do
[1:54:15] what I want to do.
[1:54:19] Why can't we believe it?
[1:54:23] Why can't we just say, "Lord, forgive
[1:54:25] me."
[1:54:26] Don't let me do that again, Lord.
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:34] When all the time believe
[1:54:38] he paid the price,
[1:54:41] he shall come with trumpet. Anybody need
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:50] his rightous
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:56] before the throne on Christ
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:03] other
[1:55:11] fires we send them bleeding.
[1:55:14] So that whatever it takes, whatever it
[1:55:16] is, he's asking that it be made manifest
[1:55:20] because we believe you.

[1:58:05] I'm defeated. God said mercy.
[1:58:11] He said, "I'm righteous and let me act
[1:58:14] like it."
[1:58:14] Jesus.
[1:58:16] You remember the story about the the son
[1:58:19] of the king that was over here from
[1:58:21] Africa.
[1:58:23] And over there in Africa, he's the son
[1:58:24] of a king. Now here, he's acting like
[1:58:27] one.
[1:58:30] That's what we're supposed to do.
[1:58:34] Act like what we're supposed to be.

[1:59:40] shine all around
[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:46] [Applause]
[1:59:48] Jesus
[1:59:52] the world. Amen. Just remember wait and
[1:59:55] I'll be running up to brother Bill Yster
[1:59:58] for the ministers meeting Saturday and
[2:00:01] driving back down. So remember that and
[2:00:03] the brother to be coming with us maybe
[2:00:05] and just pray that the Lord would bless
[2:00:06] and and help us. I I did ask the brother
[2:00:10] I said he he sure ain't tired with
[2:00:12] something. We got we got some books this
[2:00:15] week and Terrence got one cuz they
[2:00:17] couldn't find none of us. and a big old
[2:00:20] book about this thick and it looked like
[2:00:22] probably cost $100 to make the sucker
[2:00:24] and that much to get it over here from
[2:00:26] India and the man believed that brother
[2:00:28] Brandham was was the Messiah and oh he
[2:00:32] was bringing it down real good and doing
[2:00:34] then after a while he started saying
[2:00:36] that brother Brandham died and went off
[2:00:38] so Elijah's got to be alive and he's
[2:00:40] alive over here in India you know
[2:00:42] and they call it Christ brandom
[2:00:45] you know and so I got another one today.
[2:00:48] I guess it was this morning or yesterday
[2:00:50] one. Anyhow, I didn't open it. So, I
[2:00:52] just took it back. Took two of this.
[2:00:53] Just send that on back. Well, come find
[2:00:55] out there's already another one been
[2:00:57] sent somewhere here in Lula that was
[2:00:59] supposed to come to us and they sent it
[2:01:01] back. So, you know, I don't care nothing
[2:01:04] about getting involved or something like
[2:01:05] that. You know, it's called a super
[2:01:08] church if we'll believe all about it,
[2:01:11] you know, but that's up to them. They
[2:01:13] can believe what they want to. I just
[2:01:15] keep believing that there's this one
[2:01:16] true and living God
[2:01:18] and the prophet was here to bring us the
[2:01:20] message.
[2:01:21] Now we must become that message
[2:01:25] and we don't need an eighth church age
[2:01:27] messenger.
[2:01:29] Now there's only seven church age
[2:01:31] messages.
[2:01:32] But there's eight manifestations of God.
[2:01:34] See how they can take a truth and twist
[2:01:36] it
[2:01:37] and then put their self up there.
[2:01:38] That's right.
[2:01:40] But see, I ain't concerned about that.
[2:01:42] I'm just concerned about getting out of
[2:01:44] here, aren't you?
[2:01:46] You know, we're all getting older and
[2:01:47] wore out,
[2:01:49] you know. So, we better be worried about
[2:01:52] getting out of here,
[2:01:54] you know, cuz we don't want to get much
[2:01:56] older.
[2:01:58] Father, we thank you, Lord, for tonight.
[2:01:59] We pray that what we said has been
[2:02:01] worthy. We ask you to forgive us when
[2:02:04] it's not, Lord, and just help us cuz
[2:02:06] we're just human mortals trying to
[2:02:08] express you. And Lord, sometimes we get
[2:02:10] ourselves in the way and problems and
[2:02:12] all, but yet what we try to do is right,
[2:02:16] Lord. So just look over our faults and
[2:02:18] failures and bless us. But reveal your
[2:02:20] word unto us. Show us a revelation that
[2:02:23] we're born again. And by that revelation
[2:02:26] that we're born again, Lord, that we're
[2:02:28] just as righteous as you are. And oh
[2:02:31] Lord, the devil don't like to hear those
[2:02:33] words, but yet it's true
[2:02:36] and we believe you. and we commit it now
[2:02:38] into your hands, Father, and just bless
[2:02:41] us on the way home. Take care of
[2:02:42] everybody. Give everybody a safe
[2:02:44] journey. And we love you, Father, in
[2:02:46] Jesus name. Amen. You dismissed.
[2:02:50] There's a blessed time that's coming.
