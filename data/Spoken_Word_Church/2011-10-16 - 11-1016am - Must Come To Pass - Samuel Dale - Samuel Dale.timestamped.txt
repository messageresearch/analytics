[40:46] read over like to verse 14 but 1 through
[40:49] 14 and um now we're not on the seals or
[40:52] anything but this is the the reading of
[40:54] the seals you know the the seals was
[40:56] revealed what what has been what is and
[41:00] what will be is all revealed in the seal
[41:02] so that's that's the purpose of reading
[41:04] this
[41:05] today and Jesus went out and departed
[41:08] from the temple and his disciples came
[41:10] to him to show him the building of the
[41:11] temple and Jesus said unto them see ye
[41:15] not all these things verely I say unto
[41:17] you there shall not be left here one
[41:19] stone upon another that shall not be
[41:21] thrown down and he said upon the Mount
[41:24] of Olives the disciples came unto him
[41:26] privately saying tell us when shall
[41:28] these things be and what shall be the
[41:31] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[41:34] world and Jesus answered and said unto
[41:37] them take heed that no man deceive you
[41:40] for many shall come in my name saying I
[41:42] am Christ and shall deceive many and you
[41:45] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[41:48] see that that ye be not troubl for all
[41:51] these things must come to pass but the
[41:54] end is not yet and Nation shall rise
[41:57] against nation and Kingdom against
[41:59] Kingdom and there shall be famines and
[42:03] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[42:05] places
[42:06] right all these are the beginning of
[42:09] Sorrow then shall they deliver you up to
[42:12] be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[42:15] must be hated of all Nations for my
[42:17] name's sake and then shall many be
[42:20] offended and shall betray one another
[42:22] and shall hate one another and many
[42:25] false Prophet shall rise and shall
[42:27] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[42:30] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[42:33] but he that endureth to the end the same
[42:34] shall be saved and this Gospel of the
[42:37] Kingdom must be preached in all the
[42:40] world for a witness unto all nations and
[42:43] then shall the End come you may be
[42:46] seated you may
[42:49] be now verse six I want to pick out of
[42:53] that and it says and you shall hear a
[42:55] war wars and rumors of War see that you
[42:57] be not troubled for all these things
[43:00] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[43:04] amen right
[43:06] amen so what we're going to talk about
[43:11] is what it's saying the said the seals
[43:14] cover the complete Plan of Redemption
[43:17] and we just got through uh speaking
[43:19] about that on this past uh Wednesday to
[43:24] talk about a complete Plan of Redemption
[43:28] and all and that's what we want to do
[43:30] here is to just take a thought from this
[43:34] and and the thought today will be out of
[43:36] that sixth verse it says must come to
[43:40] pass now I want you to just follow with
[43:43] me for a minute and then we'll get down
[43:44] to a real
[43:46] thought we as I said we we finished or
[43:50] we're coming down to the end of U kind
[43:53] of a series that we've been on and
[43:56] talking and and expressing what our
[43:58] thoughts has been of heaven and and uh
[44:01] things like that and bringing it down to
[44:04] earth and our journey and all like that
[44:06] and then we came over to to talk about
[44:09] just a few simple things that you know
[44:13] uh like whatever is we see in
[44:18] heaven what we've been talking about
[44:21] right to find would be in heaven and all
[44:24] like that then it also must come to
[44:27] Earth to be made manifest that's right
[44:30] we can read a lot about you know that
[44:32] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[44:34] of the world that's wonderful but if
[44:36] that had not taken place upon Earth see
[44:40] some 2,000 years ago then it would make
[44:42] that a false prophecy right that you
[44:45] would be looking at see and that's
[44:47] that's the point that was my point
[44:49] Wednesday night was trying to get you to
[44:51] to look into the word and and to find
[44:55] our day in its message because I believe
[44:58] that's what you know the disciples uh
[45:00] they were looking I mean the the the the
[45:03] the ones that we took which would be all
[45:05] you know from job and we were bringing
[45:08] out how that the Morning Star s together
[45:10] and the sons of God shouting for Joy
[45:13] when they seen the Plan of
[45:15] Redemption all right now they seen all
[45:17] the way down because they didn't see
[45:19] just a partial thing of redemption they
[45:23] saw a completed Plan of Redemption
[45:26] which would mean for Body Spirit Soul
[45:29] world for everything amen so they were
[45:32] rejoicing so that was us there in the
[45:35] portion of eternal life amen that was in
[45:39] God before the world that as we were you
[45:41] know uh uh studying about that we were
[45:44] chosen in him so it was in Christ you
[45:47] know it wasn't little people running
[45:48] around little identities like that we
[45:51] were in Christ Jesus all right but see
[45:54] if then Now We're Here manifest upon
[45:57] Earth yes righten but as I made a
[45:59] statement coming to the end of the
[46:01] message that see we must uh I believe
[46:04] it's time to get away from looking back
[46:07] right to try to figure out what we were
[46:10] and to try to comprehend what we are now
[46:14] and if we can comprehend where we are
[46:15] now and see our day in its message we
[46:19] believe the message the prophet brought
[46:21] but see our day then we can realize
[46:25] realization about ourselves and and
[46:27] what's taking place in the end time
[46:30] because remember the whole point was
[46:33] every who that was was looking down here
[46:37] right amen all right looking right down
[46:39] here to where we're at in this day amen
[46:43] in this time to see the complete Plan of
[46:46] Redemption come into view that's right
[46:48] through the opening of the seals by the
[46:50] way of the Prophet messenger you know
[46:53] and then what we're waiting now is for
[46:55] God to make the those things
[46:57] manifest all right now if it's not made
[47:03] manifest then it would be false prophecy
[47:06] right that was the whole point I wanted
[47:08] you to get in other words it would be uh
[47:11] uh it would not be right it would be
[47:13] it's what a lot of people think the
[47:15] Bible is it's just what some man wrote
[47:17] you know what somebody just wrote that
[47:19] but I don't believe that right I believe
[47:21] it's the word of God I believe it was
[47:23] written before the foundation of the
[47:25] world but then it was just transmitted
[47:27] down y because it was what was in God's
[47:30] mind and transmitted down to mankind
[47:33] upon Earth to pin it down to where you
[47:35] and I could have it because see then
[47:37] you'd go back and the Bible was written
[47:39] in the stars y all right the Bible was
[47:42] written in the
[47:44] pyramids but then finally it was made
[47:47] into uh you know ink as we call it paper
[47:51] written down but really we are the
[47:54] living Bible amen right we are the word
[47:57] that's made manifest written Epistles
[47:59] made known of you know and and all but
[48:02] there's a time that it must come to
[48:04] manifestation right all right as one
[48:06] believer I believe in a manifestation of
[48:09] God I don't believe in just going to
[48:11] church and being good and say we're in
[48:13] the message and you know and that's
[48:15] that's been my desire ever since I've
[48:17] been in the message is to try to preach
[48:20] the word as I told you the Lord said one
[48:22] day he said you you preach it and I I'll
[48:25] back it up
[48:26] well I thought then well hey I'm I
[48:29] thought you know I'm doing the best I
[48:31] can do Lord but I've come to realized
[48:34] that you know that there was a whole lot
[48:36] more to be revealed than where we were
[48:38] at at that time so then you know that
[48:41] brings it to uh bring it on down to
[48:43] where we live recognizing your day
[48:46] message to see who we are see all right
[48:49] soever who that
[48:51] was and I say it that way because you
[48:54] know people don't like you say we was
[48:56] back there and and all like that cuz
[48:58] they get their minds tangled up into
[49:00] what were we yeah right who were we what
[49:03] was going on you know write it down
[49:06] where I can read it off of what I was
[49:08] yeah well you was in God right amen or
[49:11] you never will be in God you was a part
[49:14] of God the Eternal life you have today
[49:17] is the life of God correct right so then
[49:20] if it's the life of God then we're God
[49:23] made manifest in human flesh
[49:26] upon the Earth again in the end time and
[49:28] see there was a day you couldn't have
[49:29] said that right there was a day they
[49:32] were just about crucified you if you
[49:34] have said where God made
[49:36] manifest right and I ain't talking about
[49:39] back down through the a I'm talking
[49:42] about somewhere along about the 60s and
[49:44] 70s and ' 80s you know of coming forth
[49:48] into the message of the hour right that
[49:52] they just about crucify you and some
[49:54] probably would even yet for you to talk
[49:57] about that we're God made manifest but I
[49:59] believe that see because that new birth
[50:02] is that's what makes us God in human
[50:04] flesh all right so then every who it was
[50:07] back there was looking down
[50:10] here see because they seen the completed
[50:13] Plan of Redemption amen as I said if
[50:15] Jesus Christ hadn't died on the
[50:18] cross see then somewhere he would have
[50:21] to to make that scripture right or else
[50:25] was not the Scriptures it was not the
[50:28] Bible that should be sensible to us so
[50:32] then you know that's what we want to do
[50:33] we want to take that point and try to
[50:36] see our
[50:38] day and its message right all right now
[50:41] I'm talking
[50:44] about and I know bear with me for a
[50:47] second because you're not going to like
[50:49] this point maybe some but you know I'm
[50:51] talking about all over internets and
[50:54] everything but I I believe we're down
[50:56] here at the
[50:57] end now I sure hope that there's not a
[51:00] whole lot left right I'm just honest
[51:03] about that I just sure hope that there's
[51:05] not a lot left never been one about
[51:08] times or dates or Seasons but I have
[51:11] always been one wanted to be ready
[51:13] against the day you know of whatever and
[51:17] and I believe that I bringing out there
[51:18] the other day when I was asked the
[51:20] question do you believe we have the
[51:21] faith of the fathers I said yeah I do I
[51:23] believe we have
[51:24] it
[51:26] well I I just don't see it made manifest
[51:28] well right now there's where the
[51:29] trouble's at so I can't make it manifest
[51:32] you can't either right and see that's
[51:34] what people do that's right as the old
[51:36] saying goost don't judge my bushel of
[51:39] apples by your one rotten one that might
[51:42] not be exactly the quote but that's my
[51:44] way of quoting it but that's what people
[51:46] will do they won't have signs and
[51:49] wonders following them but yet you say
[51:52] something about the Bible and the truth
[51:54] and the message and we believe we should
[51:56] be the word made manifest then they
[51:58] start saying but I don't see no signs
[52:00] and wonders among you well I don't see
[52:02] them among you come on brother what did
[52:04] that
[52:05] change you know I can't make it manifest
[52:08] and you can't either that's right God is
[52:10] the only one that can make manifested
[52:12] work but now you and I are the ones that
[52:15] can
[52:16] hinder him making it manifest come on
[52:18] brother now that's where we want to get
[52:20] out of the way where he can make it
[52:22] manifest all right and I believe that's
[52:24] going to take reveal word to do that
[52:27] part for us but now here's the point I
[52:29] want you to
[52:31] get and we said about the seals being
[52:34] the complete Plan of
[52:35] Redemption all right to me the Bible as
[52:39] I brought out the other day this
[52:42] Bible was to us to a degree was
[52:47] open right sure to the basis that we
[52:50] could read
[52:51] it uh we could comprehend salvation Etc
[52:56] Y and that was done by mankind down
[52:59] through Y and then your Prophet came
[53:01] alone and it be to open further right on
[53:05] into the basis of understanding like we
[53:09] look at the pyramid call it the face of
[53:10] the fathers all right he began to preach
[53:13] that the one God the water baptism the
[53:16] no eternal hell it begin to open unto us
[53:20] by way of the Prophet down through his
[53:23] ministry all right don't throw away the
[53:26] old parts of the message you know and
[53:28] then say well we just take what's after
[53:30] the seals well I'll just tell you up
[53:32] front you can't understand what's after
[53:34] the seal if you don't see what was
[53:36] before because that before has got to be
[53:38] dealing with faith of the father that's
[53:40] right all right now but see then it
[53:43] didn't stop with just the faith of the
[53:45] fathers
[53:48] right then the seals were broke off the
[53:50] book right and when the seals were take
[53:53] off taken off the book then it became an
[53:56] open book amen that's right it wasn't
[53:59] fully open down through time no it was
[54:01] waiting for the prophet to come to bring
[54:04] the message and for God to come on the
[54:06] scene and take off the seals off the
[54:08] book right all right now that that we
[54:10] all understand that cuz then the the
[54:12] seals then would be the complete Plan of
[54:15] Redemption that's right for man world
[54:18] everything you know would be revealed in
[54:21] the seals and that Prophet brought it to
[54:24] us and that's why I read this depart
[54:25] there from Matthew 24 cuz I wanted to
[54:28] just read that one part where it says
[54:30] you know must come to pass as the
[54:33] thought that came to me but I want you
[54:36] to see that the Bible is now
[54:39] open I didn't say we understand all of
[54:42] it right right it was open to the
[54:45] prophet it was open to us in a degree of
[54:48] a lot of things coming down through time
[54:50] but that didn't mean we understood it
[54:52] all that don't mean I understand it all
[54:54] now right cuz I believe that there's a
[54:57] message to cheer down to the endless
[54:58] ages the prophet said after we leave
[55:00] here all right so then don't worry about
[55:03] it but let's get down and get away from
[55:05] back there right that's right all right
[55:09] now I wrote my own a note where I
[55:11] remember this part get away from back
[55:14] there but don't look at that that way
[55:17] right right what's back
[55:20] there is
[55:22] fine and what's coming is fine mhm but
[55:26] let's stay with what is here because now
[55:29] listen if God revealed something to you
[55:32] for that out
[55:33] there all right that's
[55:36] fine okay that's wonderful was listening
[55:39] to way last night when he preached out
[55:40] there and wiard T really enjoyed it and
[55:43] he was talking about how that David was
[55:44] anointed to be king well you know there
[55:47] was nothing could ever happen to him
[55:49] until he sat on the throne now he might
[55:51] not have been on the throne but one
[55:52] minute still he was going to be on that
[55:54] throne because that the prophet had
[55:57] anointed him for that job well why can't
[56:00] we believe that somebody in this in time
[56:04] somebody is ordained to stand here and
[56:08] these bodies be
[56:10] changed all right then why can't we
[56:12] believe we're part of
[56:14] it why can't we just accept it and say
[56:17] well there's not more to
[56:20] come I I don't say now there's more word
[56:23] to come all through the n but I'm
[56:25] talking about we're not looking for
[56:26] another Prophet to come we're not
[56:28] looking for something else to happen
[56:30] we're not looking even for somebody to
[56:32] come along and be able to correct the
[56:34] profit that we had right that's what
[56:36] they're all trying to do now you know
[56:38] but y we're not looking for that we're
[56:40] looking at it right now amen what's
[56:44] being behind us can be Faith Builders
[56:48] right cuz that's what David said he said
[56:50] I killed the lion I killed the buyer and
[56:52] you'll be just like that see it the same
[56:55] God it was there would be with him but
[56:57] he lived in a world of present tense
[56:59] right now what if he said now the bar
[57:02] and the
[57:03] line that would have been good
[57:06] faith I think I can take on Goliath you
[57:10] know I believe maybe I can whip it let
[57:13] me go try anyway let's don't be a bunch
[57:15] of shiftless bums out here you know just
[57:17] running around everything let me at
[57:19] least stand up you know and and be and
[57:22] and go forth no
[57:26] see he seen the
[57:29] future whatever was the past he seen the
[57:31] future that's fine right but you know
[57:34] what he had to do he had to back up into
[57:36] the present temp's time
[57:38] right and he had to go face Goliath
[57:41] right right and believe it all right see
[57:44] let's let's just deal with where we at
[57:46] now yes see get away from back there get
[57:50] away from for the future deal with what
[57:52] we're doing right
[57:53] now all right see then what we're
[57:57] looking at is the Bible as we read here
[58:00] said it must come to pass
[58:03] right all right must come to
[58:07] pass now in God there is no such thing
[58:11] as saying something without it being his
[58:15] word he's not like you and me he's not
[58:18] something that we can talk about
[58:19] something and maybe not be able to do it
[58:21] because of of things happening or events
[58:24] in place and you know that's why the
[58:26] Bible said the Bible don't say well tell
[58:28] brother colie you see him tomorrow it
[58:30] said it says the Lord
[58:33] willing the Lord
[58:35] willing because see you you you can't
[58:37] determine that something can go wrong
[58:39] but in God there's no such thing amen
[58:42] right now that's what you I want you to
[58:43] keep your mind on
[58:45] today is the Bible must come to pass
[58:50] amen all right now as I said about what
[58:54] was back down
[58:57] if it doesn't come to pass it would mean
[59:00] that was not written correctly right
[59:03] right all right now the things that
[59:06] we're looking forward to
[59:09] happen they must come to
[59:12] pass
[59:14] or what was
[59:16] written is not true now watch and our
[59:20] testimony right yeah now come on our
[59:24] test testimony yep of what we're saying
[59:27] present
[59:29] tense you know Christ is alive in
[59:33] us we believe the
[59:35] word see then that would mean that would
[59:38] be false prophecy right right see as
[59:42] well as the written right so now it's
[59:44] all hinged on you and I
[59:48] right this whole thing is hinged on
[59:50] whether or not don't worry about whether
[59:52] there's going to be 144,000 boy I'm glad
[59:55] we got that figured out I am too to hear
[59:57] about it but I'm not worried about them
[1:00:00] that's right I'm not worried about the
[1:00:02] future I'm concerned with right now
[1:00:05] because there won't be a future if
[1:00:07] there's not a now right that's right and
[1:00:11] if we can't take it here and say here it
[1:00:13] is right and that's what I kept trying
[1:00:16] to say about healings and everything you
[1:00:18] got to confess it to
[1:00:19] be you got to confess your salvation
[1:00:23] somebody's going to have to confess to
[1:00:24] be to stand here in human bodies that
[1:00:27] are getting older and and you know more
[1:00:29] deteriorating and everything but yet say
[1:00:33] y there's a change in the moment TN
[1:00:39] amen the Bible said it
[1:00:42] amen all right that's what I want us to
[1:00:45] look at look at it in a positive
[1:00:49] attitude that no matter what we see
[1:00:53] right like what said one time we talking
[1:00:55] about Abraham he said talking about
[1:00:57] Abraham and and what he done is
[1:01:01] fine but if we don't talk about God
[1:01:05] today right of Abraham that's right then
[1:01:08] we might not have the god of Abraham
[1:01:11] right we might be just blabbering our
[1:01:14] mouths about something but I believe
[1:01:16] that we're here at the end time how much
[1:01:19] time is left who worries we're not
[1:01:20] concerned about time we're Eternal
[1:01:23] creatures right amen Eternal creatures
[1:01:25] don't worry about time elements right I
[1:01:28] it's over in Jamaica and you've heard us
[1:01:30] tell about you know we went over there
[1:01:33] and you know first time I was when
[1:01:35] brother Harris went together you know
[1:01:37] and he had been over there but I hadn't
[1:01:39] but we got over there and we were going
[1:01:41] to do something the next morning I said
[1:01:42] brother Harris We'll be up early in the
[1:01:44] morning you know we we'll be on the road
[1:01:46] we got to take some material and do some
[1:01:50] things okay so quick as light come you
[1:01:53] know man I
[1:01:55] I got up I got ready brother haris got
[1:01:59] up and got
[1:02:01] ready it was about
[1:02:04] 6:00 you know we sitting on the
[1:02:08] porch well about
[1:02:12] 9:00 sister Brady come
[1:02:15] through I'll fix you some
[1:02:18] coffee he said breakfast be ready at a
[1:02:23] while
[1:02:24] well about 10:00 we ate
[1:02:28] breakfast I mean all it felt well and
[1:02:31] good but I was thinking we was going to
[1:02:33] be going in a hurry you know and all
[1:02:36] like that but they're just kind of slow
[1:02:38] so we were going to um when I preached
[1:02:41] over in Kingston and we were heading
[1:02:44] over there I looked at my watch you know
[1:02:46] and I thought well we're we're running
[1:02:47] pretty good on time for what time they
[1:02:49] said the service started and we we look
[1:02:52] and brother Reed said we got to eat eat
[1:02:54] and there was a happened to be a
[1:02:56] Kentucky Fried Chicken or a McDonald's
[1:02:58] or something and he said we got to eat
[1:03:02] something I thought it's time for
[1:03:05] service he said oh that's all right
[1:03:07] they'll be
[1:03:08] singing so we will in we go in just just
[1:03:12] just casual just eating not no big hurry
[1:03:14] you know I mean I keep licking up with
[1:03:16] watch I why brother he said brother Dale
[1:03:19] he said you don't understand that's
[1:03:20] black
[1:03:23] folks he said we're never on
[1:03:25] time he said we're
[1:03:28] slow you know what he's right we got
[1:03:32] over there they're
[1:03:34] singing you know what hour later they're
[1:03:37] still
[1:03:41] singing well I begin to get to kind of
[1:03:44] the idea the next morning I didn't jump
[1:03:47] up as early you know and everything
[1:03:50] that's right but what I'm talking about
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:55] right life and not worried about the
[1:03:57] future not worrying about the past right
[1:04:00] see if we were more like that we
[1:04:02] wouldn't be having heart attacks and you
[1:04:04] know and ERS and and all kind of things
[1:04:07] is woring us you know we wouldn't be
[1:04:09] doing that but I still can't do it I
[1:04:11] still you know I'm still concerned you
[1:04:13] tell me to wake you up at 2:00 and I'll
[1:04:14] wake you up at 2:00 I don't have to set
[1:04:17] the clock to do that I just wake you up
[1:04:19] but still it's just you know maybe we
[1:04:21] need to slow down maybe we need to learn
[1:04:22] some things anyhow amen but what I'm
[1:04:24] trying to do is to get us today to see
[1:04:26] ourselves okay that's right amen now to
[1:04:28] see what brother random was was
[1:04:30] wonderful that's right to see what the
[1:04:32] Saints has done behind us is wonderful
[1:04:34] to look to forward to other things is
[1:04:37] wonderful but what about what we are and
[1:04:39] what we're doing now that's right that's
[1:04:41] it where at cuz you see that's the point
[1:04:43] I want you to get see it must come to
[1:04:45] pass if God said something I heard a man
[1:04:49] one time on tape and he said me and Bill
[1:04:52] was talking about some scriptures that
[1:04:54] would never come to
[1:05:00] pass I'm not going to argue with you
[1:05:02] brother but the man that you say y'all
[1:05:05] were talking about it says that all
[1:05:07] scripture must be
[1:05:10] fulfilled so you evidently misunderstood
[1:05:12] him somewhere you know I'm not going to
[1:05:14] call you a lie just say you
[1:05:15] misunderstood what he said about
[1:05:18] something but see I believe every
[1:05:21] scripture must be fulfilled that's right
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:25] but now here's the point if you don't
[1:05:26] get nothing out of the
[1:05:29] message as I said about David his his
[1:05:32] faith was buil in he killed the V he
[1:05:34] killed the
[1:05:35] line all right now my faith today is
[1:05:40] building the journey that God has
[1:05:43] allowed me to
[1:05:46] follow the time that I've been here I
[1:05:49] enjoyed being in the Baptist I found no
[1:05:51] problem sure I never jumped up and run
[1:05:53] out of there are you a bunch of lost
[1:05:55] demons going to hell and everything no I
[1:05:57] got up and told him I just couldn't
[1:05:59] agree with him on the word and I walked
[1:06:01] out but you see I've enjoyed the journey
[1:06:03] that I've been on Amen
[1:06:06] right and and and everything and done a
[1:06:08] lot of studying about what we was and
[1:06:11] what we will be and what we're already
[1:06:13] now and that's
[1:06:15] great but I want to see the god of now
[1:06:18] come on the scene you and I right and
[1:06:20] that's our hindrance is we're stopping
[1:06:22] ourselves we we're we're keeping God
[1:06:25] from being able to fulfill his word
[1:06:27] right now so then we need to search
[1:06:29] ourselves and see what's going on and
[1:06:32] study the Bible now I wrote it like
[1:06:36] this we need to stop looking and
[1:06:38] spending our time at looking to see what
[1:06:40] we was before the
[1:06:43] world and not trying to worry about what
[1:06:46] we will be in the future right
[1:06:50] amen but to see what's taking place amen
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] now when job saw the morning stars
[1:06:58] singing together and the sons of God
[1:06:59] shouting for
[1:07:01] Joy see somewhere that must come to pass
[1:07:05] right amen all right now all this behind
[1:07:08] you're following me see that must come
[1:07:10] to pass if God says anything it has to
[1:07:14] come to pass amen cuz if not it wouldn't
[1:07:17] be what God Said it' be what we thought
[1:07:20] he said or what you know we thought
[1:07:22] somebody else said about it brother Joe
[1:07:24] let's get a little reading out of the
[1:07:25] way and then we'll you see you shouldn't
[1:07:27] have to have these I really didn't have
[1:07:29] these they look so down and out that I
[1:07:31] wouldn't going to let them do their job
[1:07:33] today
[1:07:35] so I went in I knew what quotes and
[1:07:39] everything so I just ran them off and
[1:07:40] let let them have them but look what
[1:07:42] look what the prophet of God had to say
[1:07:44] about it this is from a message called
[1:07:46] pardon that's preached in
[1:07:48] 1963 uh 1028 paragraph
[1:07:52] 43 then we can rely upon this whatever
[1:07:55] God says is true it must come to pass
[1:07:59] God cannot take his word back
[1:08:02] see because he's infinite and he's
[1:08:05] Eternal and his first decision is
[1:08:08] alltime decision he doesn't have to to
[1:08:12] take it back because he learned more
[1:08:14] about it he's infinite to begin with and
[1:08:17] therefore When God says anything it's
[1:08:19] perfectly that
[1:08:20] way it can never be changed because
[1:08:23] because it's the perfect decision that's
[1:08:27] right now whatever God that's the point
[1:08:29] look at the next one modern events made
[1:08:31] by prophecy paragraph 5765
[1:08:35] 1206 and this book is the book of
[1:08:39] Prophecy it's Believers are commanded to
[1:08:42] honor it and to read it and believe its
[1:08:46] author forever word that's written in
[1:08:49] there must come to pass everything
[1:08:51] that's been promised to come to pass
[1:08:54] because it's Jesus Christ in each day
[1:08:56] the same yesterday so he goes on talking
[1:08:58] about knowing Jesus in different on all
[1:09:00] right look at the last one we'll get he
[1:09:02] reading out of the way which is page 49
[1:09:04] Church age
[1:09:05] book The patmas Vision says you telling
[1:09:09] John write the Visions John make a
[1:09:12] record of them for the Ages which are to
[1:09:14] follow for they are the true prophecies
[1:09:17] and must come to pass write them and
[1:09:20] send them out making them known now
[1:09:23] we've got the profit behind what we're
[1:09:25] talking
[1:09:27] about and we not have to have that to be
[1:09:30] said but we've got it there to honor
[1:09:31] that heart that what the Bible says is
[1:09:36] true
[1:09:38] amen and if we would read it that way
[1:09:41] and not read it as about somebody else
[1:09:44] amen but read it as about ourselves
[1:09:47] that's right how are we supposed to read
[1:09:49] it by his stripes Samuel Dale is healed
[1:09:54] make it something personal he was
[1:09:56] wounded for my put my name there make it
[1:09:59] personal because it is written to me as
[1:10:03] I always say this is my
[1:10:05] Bible was GI to me but it's my Bible
[1:10:08] right it belongs to me the letters on
[1:10:11] the page then would belong to me right
[1:10:13] amen all right then the god of the or
[1:10:16] the author of The Bible would be
[1:10:18] speaking to me that's right about me
[1:10:23] that's right
[1:10:24] see that's what we're failing to see in
[1:10:26] the Bible we read it about somebody else
[1:10:29] and then we say we wish that God would
[1:10:31] be here as he was in Paul right as he
[1:10:34] was in
[1:10:36] Peter see and in doing those things and
[1:10:39] and and I've always been the one that
[1:10:41] always destroys everybody's bubble but
[1:10:43] it's like I've always said you take the
[1:10:45] life of
[1:10:47] Paul and you think boy it would have
[1:10:49] been wonderful to live in that world
[1:10:51] like he
[1:10:52] did what kind of a world did that man
[1:10:55] live in to be what he was right sure you
[1:11:00] know John was on Patman for two years
[1:11:02] out there with snakes and alligators I
[1:11:04] mean snakes I'm
[1:11:06] sure for two years right wri in the Book
[1:11:10] of Revelation boy it be something to
[1:11:12] write the Book of Revelation but what
[1:11:13] about the horror that he went
[1:11:16] through look at Paul what did he say
[1:11:18] beaten uh how many times I forgot five
[1:11:21] times or
[1:11:22] something
[1:11:24] shipwreck all kind of things happen to
[1:11:26] the man right over his writing in the
[1:11:29] Bible it wasn't all Glory Hallelujah
[1:11:33] that's right amen right right look at
[1:11:36] our Prophet here in the end time and all
[1:11:37] the things that happened to him amen of
[1:11:40] losing his wife and losing his
[1:11:43] daughter because he wouldn't step out
[1:11:46] right on the word of God right come on
[1:11:50] he wouldn't deny his gifts and all this
[1:11:52] that and the other
[1:11:54] right he just wouldn't move when God
[1:11:55] told him to Y and God had to remove
[1:11:58] things out of his
[1:12:00] way to where he could be out on the
[1:12:02] field right he had to wait until his
[1:12:04] mother-in-law pass cuz he promised his
[1:12:06] wife you know he said now we
[1:12:10] leave now what about a promise of God
[1:12:12] waiting on the death of your
[1:12:15] mother-in-law right it's
[1:12:19] true God's up in heaven
[1:12:22] waiting
[1:12:24] when his mother-in-law FES he'll get up
[1:12:26] and go I mean I'm just being honest
[1:12:29] right right see but what I want us to
[1:12:32] think about don't worry about these
[1:12:34] things just read the
[1:12:37] Bible and see what the Bible says about
[1:12:43] it there's a lot in the Bible you
[1:12:48] know what about the scripture this is
[1:12:51] just the way I write down things but
[1:12:54] what about the scripture says be
[1:12:55] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:12:57] Heaven is perfect right now that means
[1:12:59] somebody's got to do that right right
[1:13:02] now we can argue over how to get TI CU
[1:13:05] that's what we've done for all the years
[1:13:07] right the Baptist had their
[1:13:08] interpretation of that me just that
[1:13:10] there presbyter well this really
[1:13:12] wouldn't meaning perfect it was meaning
[1:13:14] this or it didn't mean this it meant
[1:13:16] that then we argued over what it
[1:13:19] meant instead of realizing that it was
[1:13:22] true amen
[1:13:26] so somebody has to be perfect why cu the
[1:13:29] Bible
[1:13:31] says and just as perfect as her father
[1:13:34] is
[1:13:38] right so why don't I believe that that's
[1:13:41] me why can't I accept that that's
[1:13:44] me the prophet of God made a lot of
[1:13:47] things of the Bible come into a reality
[1:13:50] of taking the Bible and bringing it but
[1:13:52] what about when he would speak about say
[1:13:55] that in the end time there'd be a
[1:14:00] bride y they would not fall like e right
[1:14:06] amen now what about that right you know
[1:14:09] what that means
[1:14:11] somebody has got to fulfill
[1:14:15] that or else it's false
[1:14:18] prophecy are you following me the things
[1:14:21] brother brand said about you and I and
[1:14:23] who we are and what we are if somebody
[1:14:26] don't make that manifest then he was
[1:14:28] wrong and if he was wrong the Bible
[1:14:30] would be wrong so now you know I'm not
[1:14:33] believing that he was wrong not
[1:14:35] believing the Bible was wrong right
[1:14:38] wrong is you and I Amen to not accept
[1:14:41] what God says right
[1:14:45] right by being in Jesus Christ by the
[1:14:48] new birth we're just as perfect as God
[1:14:50] is amen amen that's right why because
[1:14:53] God's living in us right but do we
[1:14:56] really believe that that's
[1:15:01] it there's a lot of things in the Bible
[1:15:04] that see points down to where we
[1:15:06] are and we studied a lot in the book of
[1:15:09] Revel I mean they're talking about the
[1:15:11] Heaven and the and the you know in the
[1:15:13] things and we found out one day there's
[1:15:15] going to be a future
[1:15:17] home that's going to come down out of
[1:15:19] the sky land on this
[1:15:21] Earth well you know if that don't take
[1:15:26] place then that means the Bible's wrong
[1:15:31] right you follow me
[1:15:35] right why
[1:15:37] not set our
[1:15:39] goal
[1:15:41] now we not set our goal to be one
[1:15:46] thing when we reach the moon you've
[1:15:49] heard me Express
[1:15:51] this when man reached the Moon
[1:15:53] you know the interplanetary travels
[1:15:56] Etc he kind of reached an
[1:15:59] apex remember what you call in a
[1:16:02] height and there's not a lot of
[1:16:04] development now there's a lot of
[1:16:06] scientific advances don't misunderstand
[1:16:09] me but yet the surge for to get dark we
[1:16:14] had to beat the Russians we had to beat
[1:16:16] them we had to beat our first we had to
[1:16:18] do this so it made a push to to go
[1:16:22] forward
[1:16:24] but now it's just kind of oh we got a
[1:16:27] rocket up there you got a rocket up
[1:16:28] there watch out for my rocket is coming
[1:16:29] by you know we'll help you fix yours you
[1:16:32] help us fix ours you know we just all go
[1:16:35] up together and work on these
[1:16:37] things even though we are our
[1:16:41] enemies wanting to destroy each other
[1:16:43] but yet we still got some Russians and
[1:16:45] and Americans probably up up there right
[1:16:48] now that's working on scientific
[1:16:52] achievements
[1:16:53] but you
[1:16:56] see the people have no gold
[1:17:00] anymore we were talking the other day
[1:17:02] about kids and what's doing see and
[1:17:04] looking at where it's at and you just
[1:17:05] see them you just see the kids they just
[1:17:08] out there they don't care they don't
[1:17:11] care about a job all they care about is
[1:17:13] a dollar to be able to buy them some
[1:17:15] dope or you know something to eat and
[1:17:17] every one of them you know you can see
[1:17:18] that they don't eat because you hardly
[1:17:20] ever see I'm talking about you know I'm
[1:17:21] not talking about going to school seeing
[1:17:23] all the fat ones now misunderstand me
[1:17:25] you go on I'm talking about that you see
[1:17:29] these that are out on the streets and
[1:17:31] they're all real skinny because they
[1:17:32] don't eat yeah cuz they don't
[1:17:35] care that's right they're just living
[1:17:38] day
[1:17:41] today just have a good time why cuz
[1:17:43] there's nothing to be achieved anymore
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:50] right but now why can't we as the PR of
[1:17:53] Jesus
[1:17:54] Christ set a goal you know go a goal in
[1:17:58] our
[1:18:00] mind a plan in their mind a way yep to
[1:18:04] say I'm going to do this
[1:18:07] right I'm going to achieve this it says
[1:18:11] that somebody will right
[1:18:15] right why not me be the
[1:18:20] one Abraham Lincoln learned to read the
[1:18:22] Bible
[1:18:23] and that he had what foxy book of
[1:18:25] Martyrs and had the Bible I believe is
[1:18:26] the two books he had and he taught his
[1:18:28] own self to read turn not to be
[1:18:30] president of the United States yeah
[1:18:36] right but you see because he said in his
[1:18:38] mind that's it that he was going to
[1:18:41] achieve that's right I was over in
[1:18:44] Jamaica and they didn't like it at all I
[1:18:45] know it cuz you see a lot of it over
[1:18:47] there they hear this they understand
[1:18:49] it's
[1:18:49] true a lot of that is just down because
[1:18:53] they don't have anything to go and do
[1:18:56] and just eating and scrunching for the
[1:18:58] best they can and I told the church
[1:19:00] people there I talk there just like I
[1:19:03] talk here I don't change when I'm anywh
[1:19:05] there I said your problem is is you're
[1:19:08] lazy you go out and get you a
[1:19:11] job well we don't have no jobs over here
[1:19:14] create
[1:19:16] one move this rock over there and then
[1:19:20] put it back over
[1:19:21] here
[1:19:25] you can find something to
[1:19:27] do right here in America you know that's
[1:19:30] ain't no job what it means is it ain't
[1:19:32] no job going to let you work from going
[1:19:34] at what go to work at 12:00 and off at 1
[1:19:37] then you want two coffee breaks in the
[1:19:43] middle it's becoming this shiftless lazy
[1:19:48] bums that's I don't like that I'm just
[1:19:51] honest it doesn't matter me what
[1:19:53] countryes
[1:19:54] in if somebody's got a can fill out
[1:19:57] there that's what I telling them get you
[1:19:59] a job cutting I ain't cutting can see
[1:20:01] you're
[1:20:04] lazy all right but see set let's set a
[1:20:07] goal in our mind a thought in our head
[1:20:09] amen is nothing else because I believe
[1:20:13] that God's word is here amen amen and I
[1:20:16] believe we need to start saying it's
[1:20:18] here get away from this well one of
[1:20:21] these days you know one these days one
[1:20:23] these days it's going to happen no why
[1:20:26] not say today is the day of
[1:20:29] salvation walk into
[1:20:32] it say that we're changed walk into it
[1:20:35] say we're healed walk into it say we're
[1:20:38] saved walk into
[1:20:40] it amen cuz the Bible says these things
[1:20:43] must come to pass
[1:20:47] amen see the Bible must be fulfilled
[1:20:51] that's right
[1:20:53] right yes sir I hope you're listening to
[1:20:55] the point of what I'm trying to make see
[1:20:57] it must be
[1:20:58] fulfilled it's not something that we
[1:21:00] talk
[1:21:01] about we're not supposed to be messages
[1:21:04] Baptist I'm not throwing off on them
[1:21:06] right but you know how it is we're all
[1:21:09] going to
[1:21:10] heaven we're all we all we're good yeah
[1:21:13] there little group over here they got
[1:21:14] their and we got we we well now now
[1:21:18] we're not going to have different groups
[1:21:19] when we get to heaven that's right you
[1:21:21] we that's what they say now yeah but
[1:21:23] we're you know that used to be we're
[1:21:25] going to have it used to be that
[1:21:27] everybody T we're going to have a
[1:21:28] Baptist Corner Methodist Corner
[1:21:29] Presbyterian Corner
[1:21:31] whatever but see now they don't say that
[1:21:34] because they moved into other Realms and
[1:21:36] talks and they say well now you just
[1:21:38] talk to somebody and they'll say well
[1:21:39] there's not going to be them them little
[1:21:41] groups in heaven we're going to all be
[1:21:43] one we get there you know well they
[1:21:45] change you know why cuz somebody come
[1:21:47] along to tell
[1:21:48] them I told you how that the the water
[1:21:51] baptism came to me I had to go get it
[1:21:53] done when that Baptist preacher preached
[1:21:55] all you do in word and deed do all in
[1:21:57] the name of Jesus
[1:22:00] Christ the church started praying in
[1:22:03] Jesus Christ if you ever in a Baptist
[1:22:06] Church back in the older days when we
[1:22:07] was there 40 years
[1:22:10] ago you prayed for Christ's
[1:22:12] sake in his
[1:22:15] name the name of the
[1:22:17] Lord come on I there lifted and watched
[1:22:21] them but after that man preached that
[1:22:24] they started praying in Jesus
[1:22:26] name but see I went to the water of
[1:22:28] baptism
[1:22:29] amen y well you know what they're doing
[1:22:31] today you go there and you listen they
[1:22:33] pray in Jesus
[1:22:35] name because somebody opened up a can of
[1:22:39] a position to them that would would
[1:22:42] bring them into a different thought of
[1:22:46] Life why don't we just sit in our mind
[1:22:49] and think about the
[1:22:51] Bible
[1:22:54] if it was written it must come to pass
[1:22:58] amen if we can find it written it must
[1:23:01] come to pass right the prophet of God I
[1:23:04] was looking for this in the other day
[1:23:05] and there's a little different wording
[1:23:06] in it but it's our he said if you can
[1:23:08] find the promise in God's word and he
[1:23:09] don't rank the pass you can call him a
[1:23:12] liar right I remember when I first heard
[1:23:15] that I thought boy that's strong but
[1:23:17] didn't I realize what he was saying
[1:23:18] that's right
[1:23:20] amen there thing I have has to be based
[1:23:23] upon what this Bible say right that's
[1:23:25] right you say I'm based on the prophet
[1:23:27] well you can't do it by one that's right
[1:23:30] now he said
[1:23:32] right the front side and the rear side
[1:23:34] of the
[1:23:36] gun y he wasn't using Old and New
[1:23:39] Testament to just Express that he was
[1:23:42] using the message right and the Bible to
[1:23:45] line you up on target right cuz either
[1:23:47] one of them messed up and You' missed it
[1:23:50] right right man but he come to show God
[1:23:52] came to and used the prophet to
[1:23:54] vindicate that this Bible is right or
[1:23:56] what it say he said we don't need nobody
[1:23:59] to interpret it to
[1:24:01] us brother brandham that's what people
[1:24:03] say and I've said it too and it's it's
[1:24:05] true to what you're thinking if you get
[1:24:07] it right brother brand come to bring us
[1:24:08] the interpretation of the Bible that's
[1:24:10] all right right but you know really he
[1:24:12] didn't come to bring us the bring us an
[1:24:14] interpretation he come to tell us what
[1:24:15] the interpretation
[1:24:18] was you said when it said back there in
[1:24:21] Genesis
[1:24:23] and there was light he said there was
[1:24:26] light he said there's your Vindication
[1:24:29] or
[1:24:31] manifestation well why can't we just
[1:24:33] study it to the point to say this must
[1:24:36] come to
[1:24:39] pass God gives you a
[1:24:42] promise it must come to pass does he
[1:24:45] ever give you a promise about something
[1:24:47] and then you seen it come to pass have
[1:24:48] you you ever done that I mean him just
[1:24:50] really tell you something and then you
[1:24:51] see it come to
[1:24:53] back you know what there ain't enough
[1:24:55] devils in hell to keep that from taking
[1:24:59] place I don't care how many they are are
[1:25:01] devils or preachers either there ain't
[1:25:03] enough of them to keep it from coming to
[1:25:06] pass when I first came into this message
[1:25:08] it was always the preachers that
[1:25:10] preached you don't have to understand
[1:25:12] the message you just believe what the
[1:25:14] prophet said you don't have to have no
[1:25:17] understanding you don't need to do it
[1:25:19] and if there's anything changes we'll
[1:25:21] tell you where it changes
[1:25:25] oh my uhhuh so now what are they doing
[1:25:29] they're telling you we're changes cuz
[1:25:31] they got the two Souls of s00 Virtues
[1:25:33] Bru is River Jordan they got the Telly
[1:25:36] where all the changes come
[1:25:39] right you
[1:25:41] know but see I wonder what brother
[1:25:44] random would do if he back here
[1:25:46] everybody said brother's coming back if
[1:25:49] it took him 3 32 years to preach statute
[1:25:52] of perfect man I believe that's right
[1:25:54] the number wise of it 30 something years
[1:25:57] how long would it take him to preach it
[1:25:59] over again to get it
[1:26:05] right that's what I've always said I've
[1:26:08] always told you what I believe about
[1:26:10] these
[1:26:12] things but I stand on what God has
[1:26:14] spoken to me
[1:26:17] yes see these things must come to pass
[1:26:20] that's right if God tell you something
[1:26:22] don't worry about it that's right I told
[1:26:24] my wife something one
[1:26:26] time you've heard me say it I was
[1:26:28] sitting up in the garden I never told
[1:26:30] what it was cuz I told her I said
[1:26:32] that'll take place she said no it won't
[1:26:35] I said it'll take place or I'll quit
[1:26:36] preaching won't preach another
[1:26:39] seron and but I meant every word of
[1:26:42] it she said well you preached your last
[1:26:46] mes because she didn't believe it take
[1:26:49] life well it did yeah I've told you many
[1:26:54] things here and said stood right here
[1:26:55] from the pull pit and said I'm basing
[1:26:58] that upon my own
[1:27:00] right you know what God spoke to me
[1:27:02] about
[1:27:06] it said you'll
[1:27:09] rain when we call for
[1:27:12] it I've also told you it won't rain
[1:27:14] until I call for
[1:27:16] it see that's all on tape I don't have
[1:27:18] to worry about it that's people out
[1:27:20] there you know they they're playing
[1:27:22] around and they got these preachers that
[1:27:23] come through and say I said this and I
[1:27:24] said that but how many of them got the
[1:27:26] tapes from 82 to where we stand today to
[1:27:29] back it up and even some earlier than
[1:27:35] that but listen
[1:27:38] Church these things must come to pass
[1:27:41] that's my whole point of bringing this
[1:27:43] about heaven and seeing how it is and
[1:27:46] wants to take
[1:27:47] place but now we're down here where
[1:27:50] these things must take place here y
[1:27:52] That's
[1:27:53] Right Heaven Don't Need No Redemption no
[1:27:57] that's right right I don't get all into
[1:28:00] other with the reconciliation cuz that
[1:28:02] that's carrying you back to reveal work
[1:28:03] righten Heaven don't need
[1:28:09] Redemption is you and I that need
[1:28:11] Redemption right
[1:28:13] amen when job said the morning star sign
[1:28:15] together the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:28:17] and the prophet said that was when they
[1:28:18] saw the Plan of Redemption they were
[1:28:20] looking down here right right
[1:28:24] amen told you that time nobody been lost
[1:28:28] right looking down here to where we
[1:28:30] would be on earth and rejoicing about
[1:28:36] it you ever just get happy and rejoice
[1:28:39] about God saving you amen
[1:28:43] right do you ever just wonder why he
[1:28:45] saved you amen when all the rest of the
[1:28:48] world was so much whole lot better than
[1:28:50] we are we and are
[1:28:54] yeah why did he save us
[1:28:57] right why did he choose
[1:29:04] us but
[1:29:06] look what about all of the
[1:29:10] scriptures that we could go
[1:29:13] through I just wrote down thing and I'd
[1:29:16] write down and then WR must come to pass
[1:29:19] must come to pass must come to pass the
[1:29:22] Bible said he'd open the windows of
[1:29:23] heaven and pour out a blessing upon you

[1:33:21] things

[1:33:26] at the promises in the Bible that there
[1:33:28] would be earthquakes in diverse
[1:33:30] places and we're seeing them
[1:33:33] today you know earthquakes and and

[1:33:46] said he would right all
[1:33:49] right the Bible then telling
[1:33:53] us and see the prophet didn't as I said
[1:33:56] have to come and interpret that he come
[1:33:59] to tell us that that was
[1:34:02] right
[1:34:04] right see he didn't change the Bible
[1:34:06] where that in verse three of what we
[1:34:08] read in Matthew in Matthew
[1:34:11] 24 there was three questions asked right
[1:34:14] we just didn't read it correctly right
[1:34:16] yep and that's three questions yep see

[1:34:22] things he come to tell us the Bible says
[1:34:25] there's just one God Amen right well you
[1:34:29] know the Bible already sat
[1:34:31] that but we got in our self
[1:34:34] interpretation and got it so out of line
[1:34:37] until it could not be fulfilled the way
[1:34:39] we see things
[1:34:41] right but the way God says it it must
[1:34:44] come to pass right
[1:34:47] amen see those Towers had to fall to
[1:34:50] fulfill the scripture right but the
[1:34:52] towers would fall but yeah we can look
[1:34:55] at The Towers falling but do we do we
[1:34:57] understand and follow after that in that
[1:35:00] day the light of the sun will be seven
[1:35:02] times and the bride the moon would be as
[1:35:05] the same as the sun
[1:35:08] am that's the things that we don't
[1:35:12] follow
[1:35:13] after by seeing ourselveses and
[1:35:17] saying
[1:35:19] you there is per things in the Bible
[1:35:24] yep one day there will be a change in a
[1:35:27] moment the twinkle of an
[1:35:29] eye that must come to pass because it
[1:35:32] has been written right
[1:35:35] right but it'll only come to pass when
[1:35:37] somebody right stands here right and
[1:35:41] says it
[1:35:44] right cuz it must come to pass let me
[1:35:47] say it right this message was not
[1:35:51] brought to be argued over our doct
[1:35:54] doctrinal issues or
[1:35:55] situations this message was to
[1:35:58] be to bring forth a stature of a perfect
[1:36:01] man amen and the Bible says it will come
[1:36:05] amen and it must
[1:36:08] come but then our choice is whether or
[1:36:11] not we'll accept it and believe it like
[1:36:12] I've always said I told you 30 years ago
[1:36:14] or more I said there'll be a lot of
[1:36:16] people in this message will die because
[1:36:20] they will not be able to stand here and
[1:36:21] take a change of the body so thereby
[1:36:24] they are Christians Born Again people
[1:36:26] they can't climb the statue of a perfect
[1:36:28] man that's what I saw 30 years ago or
[1:36:31] more and I haven't changed when IA since
[1:36:34] then on that
[1:36:35] point that's right you see a lot of
[1:36:38] young people in the message you see a
[1:36:39] lot of old people sure you say well old
[1:36:41] is supposed to die you see a lot of
[1:36:43] young people dying in this
[1:36:45] message I'm not de christianizing
[1:36:47] anybody
[1:36:49] right I wasn't n then my point never was
[1:36:52] to De Christian my point is I said then
[1:36:55] I may be one of them that won't be able
[1:36:58] to take that change in know word I've
[1:37:01] got to go by the grave I have no other
[1:37:02] choice the Bible says that that's right
[1:37:05] see the Bible says we've got to come
[1:37:08] like Richard said about said he'd never
[1:37:09] seen that brother random said we've got
[1:37:11] to have the stature of a perfect man y
[1:37:14] right we've got to have it it's not
[1:37:16] something that that's we talk about it's
[1:37:18] a
[1:37:20] requirement
[1:37:22] somebody's going to be changed to do
[1:37:24] that we're going to have to walk in the
[1:37:25] Statue of perfect man
[1:37:27] right and to see those
[1:37:31] things when are we going to start saying
[1:37:33] it though right must come to
[1:37:36] pass it must it it it's not a it's not a
[1:37:40] thought it's not an
[1:37:41] idea it's What God Says amen that's
[1:37:45] right now all I spent about up in heaven
[1:37:47] was to be able to say this message today
[1:37:50] all I talked about when we were talking
[1:37:51] about in heaven about 6 minutes of what
[1:37:53] we would see and what would take place
[1:37:55] and and the things now this afternoon
[1:37:57] we're going to take the things we miss
[1:37:59] because of who we
[1:38:03] are but you see this must come to pass
[1:38:09] right because God said
[1:38:12] it well if God just told me like it did
[1:38:17] Abraham
[1:38:19] PR come on he if God was just me like
[1:38:22] with me like he was brother
[1:38:25] Brandon come on brother you wouldn't
[1:38:27] want to walk in his shoes that's right
[1:38:30] amen for one day let alone a year or two
[1:38:32] that's
[1:38:34] right any true preacher of God you
[1:38:36] wouldn't want to walk in my te no that's
[1:38:41] right because sometimes they're pretty
[1:38:46] hard sometimes it's pretty
[1:38:49] rough but I've never regretted it and
[1:38:51] I've always enjoyed it that's right am
[1:38:54] because the one goal I've got in mind is
[1:38:56] get you to
[1:38:58] see this
[1:39:00] Bible the prophet's message that we were
[1:39:03] reading must come to
[1:39:07] pass it's not whether it will or not or
[1:39:09] hoping it will well I hope that's a good
[1:39:12] thought you bringing there I just I just
[1:39:14] hope it'll be no there's no such
[1:39:16] thing it must come to pass right why
[1:39:20] because God said it right and if he
[1:39:24] doesn't keep his word on one place how
[1:39:25] can I expect him to keep it in another
[1:39:29] right if you can prove that God didn't
[1:39:31] keep his word in one place how do you
[1:39:33] know whether or not he keep it any words
[1:39:35] else
[1:39:37] right you know what I
[1:39:39] like I like things like brother R say
[1:39:42] that that was Moses and Moses he said I
[1:39:44] could understand Moses how he can tell
[1:39:45] God a better way of doing
[1:39:48] something he said I come find out it was
[1:39:50] Christ in and Moses right cuz I remember
[1:39:54] the Bible back there and I used to think
[1:39:55] about it I'm talking about I used to
[1:39:58] think about it well back right the
[1:40:00] Baptist and
[1:40:01] thing you know that Moses come up there
[1:40:04] and he actually went before God and he
[1:40:05] said now Lord I'm just kind of
[1:40:07] paraphrasing it you
[1:40:10] read he said
[1:40:14] Lord he said we're out here with
[1:40:16] problems we got troubles we're we're
[1:40:18] heading to the land and all these things
[1:40:20] is in the way
[1:40:24] and said Lord you come on the scene and
[1:40:26] take care of these things or else it
[1:40:29] will be said yeah that's pretty close to
[1:40:33] paraphrase right or else it will be said
[1:40:36] that God was able to bring them out so
[1:40:39] far but not able to take them
[1:40:45] in I
[1:40:47] thought then when I heard that Prophet
[1:40:49] say that that was Christ
[1:40:53] I thought oh Lord now I see it right
[1:40:56] right but you know that man was dealing
[1:40:59] with God
[1:41:01] yeah sure you know the Bible says who is
[1:41:04] it is it Isaiah or is Elijah which one
[1:41:07] that was praying for the people or you
[1:41:11] know all of those prophets prayed for
[1:41:14] the people of their time amen you know
[1:41:16] what God heard your
[1:41:19] words you mean you tell God watch and
[1:41:21] listen if you don't if you don't take
[1:41:23] these people into the
[1:41:25] land it's going to be said that you
[1:41:27] couldn't do it
[1:41:29] y God didn't say I'm mad at him I'm
[1:41:33] upset cuz he he's doubting me he
[1:41:39] said you're
[1:41:41] right and I'm going to do it y That's
[1:41:47] right yep
[1:41:49] Moses you're going to take them in
[1:41:55] right he took them as far as he could go
[1:41:58] didn't he but you know the same Christ
[1:42:00] that was in Moses to tell God A Better
[1:42:02] Way was right over in Joshua that's
[1:42:06] right to take them in right Joshua was
[1:42:10] the man I used to love to read that I
[1:42:13] thought where did this guy Joshua when
[1:42:14] day I was thinking about where this guy
[1:42:16] Joshua come from and I begin to kind of
[1:42:18] run a study on Joshua com find out he
[1:42:21] was right there with Moses get back
[1:42:22] there and read it sometimes and just
[1:42:24] read Joshua and his doing you got to get
[1:42:27] you know what I mean you you you got the
[1:42:29] Kings and you got the uh the Chronicles
[1:42:31] and the things that you got to read
[1:42:33] different accounts and some of them will
[1:42:35] explain more and I was thinking you know
[1:42:38] you come find out Joshua was standing
[1:42:40] right there side of Moses sure and when
[1:42:43] it come to the Tabernacle or what it was
[1:42:45] the congregation and what the thing was
[1:42:49] Joshua was told you go in there go you
[1:42:50] come
[1:42:52] out it wasn't a tent and doing a
[1:42:55] different thing you know it was
[1:42:56] a Joshua's job was to stay right
[1:43:01] there he was watching
[1:43:04] Moses being trained yep then one day God
[1:43:09] said as I was with Moses so I'll be with
[1:43:11] thee
[1:43:13] right he said okay I seen it work with
[1:43:17] God so it got to work
[1:43:19] again cuz he believe what God said
[1:43:22] that's right you understand
[1:43:25] come must come to pass I hope you get my
[1:43:29] point you see up in
[1:43:32] heaven you'll see that I I haven't
[1:43:34] finished my talk but just too much
[1:43:38] time you see something up in heaven
[1:43:41] that's got to happen here right right y
[1:43:44] you say I was back there well then we
[1:43:47] got to be right here right m
[1:43:51] true now if my life back there will
[1:43:53] showing one thing and my life here show
[1:43:56] something else right where am I right
[1:44:00] something's wrong
[1:44:02] right somebody's wrong somewhere
[1:44:05] right but if I could see myself years
[1:44:08] ago see preached that matching
[1:44:12] pieces when God seen that come across
[1:44:15] there and seen that angel sweep across
[1:44:17] and preach the message you to just you
[1:44:19] live by faith they had to be man on
[1:44:21] earth right and there was a man named
[1:44:23] Martin Luther that would take that
[1:44:26] message right he recognized his day and
[1:44:30] his
[1:44:30] message because God seen it come across
[1:44:33] well he's seen it come across that's why
[1:44:35] I like Christ M of God reveal brother
[1:44:37] said see how it's unfolded down to the
[1:44:41] present hour that we're living I love
[1:44:43] that go look how much further it's
[1:44:45] unfolded that's right amen it's unfolded
[1:44:49] now from being a prophet that it came to
[1:44:51] a bride is to take that message and walk
[1:44:54] off this Earth in the same message the
[1:44:57] prophet brought how much more honor
[1:44:59] could we give to brother brandham oh I
[1:45:01] want to honor I know people and I'm not
[1:45:03] so come on folks now I've been around
[1:45:06] and he listen to a lot of people you
[1:45:08] know the prophet said if we'd honor his
[1:45:10] family oh I want to do everything I can
[1:45:11] good for his family well that's
[1:45:14] fine that's
[1:45:17] fine but what about doing something for
[1:45:19] the Living God that's living now amen
[1:45:22] right
[1:45:26] y be a little blunt lot of people send
[1:45:29] their ties up to Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:45:31] because they want to do that that's
[1:45:32] their money ain't nothing business to me
[1:45:34] I don't care cuz they going to get me
[1:45:35] one more dime might cost me
[1:45:39] some but they want to send their money
[1:45:41] up to
[1:45:44] Jeffersonville but what greater honor
[1:45:46] could you give a
[1:45:48] prophet than to pay your tith to to a
[1:45:50] five-fold Ministry minister to fulfill
[1:45:53] the Bible that's
[1:45:56] right you can't send it there to fulfill
[1:45:59] the Bible that's right now come on you
[1:46:04] know I'm not a money man and been after
