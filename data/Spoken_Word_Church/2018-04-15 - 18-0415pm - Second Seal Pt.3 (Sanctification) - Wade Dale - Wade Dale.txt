think F let's do F key of F [Music] there's a country far beyond the starry sky there's a city where there never comes a night if we're faithful we shall go there by and by in that city where the lamp is the line in that city where miss de la that city were there comment no no I've a mansion over there and when free from tolling care I am going where the lamp is the line here we have our days of sunshine but we know that the Sun which shines upon us now so bright we'll be changed to clouds and rain until we go to the city where the lamp is the line in that city the lamb is the line that city where they're coming though ever mention over there and when free from tolling care I am going where the lamp is the line they're the flowers bloom forever and the day I shall be one eternal day without a night and our tears shall never be wiped away in that city where the lamp is the line in that city where the is the LA that city where they're coming [Laughter] of a mansion over there and

city where the lamp is the line that city where there cometh known I mention no glare and when free from Toland when [Music] [Applause] and then wonderful city you know what it's just ahead of us just keep walking amen there's gotta make a little vote and announcement I first off it'd be hard to keep up with a record of what birth that we were because everywhere I went all I had to prove I was born was a family bible and there was 13 names on that list Sam and Hannah Dale and children and I was the last one so I was the 13th one and that's why the mix-up was that they went by the 15th because it wouldn't another day to the next day when the doctor assigned him the birth certificate he put April the 16th 1 a.m. so among them didn't count it till the next day so it didn't matter but that was a reason I had that and see that way I get two birthdays you didn't catch that Terrence was paid to say that but he didn't do it I supposed to get to presidency you know and now let's stand up and then we'll finish self cuz we got a little vote our sound system not to sound system in here as much but our video system that we're using to transmit the messages you know throughout the internet system is you know is it needs to be updated because that some of you you know you you're listening in and doing when you do you have a lot of of doings that you know it don't work too good and also we're gonna try to get in to get a new system to put it to where you can get better to do it called part of it is one time parts another so it's gonna cost a good bit of money so I've already talked with the trustees and they said okay everything's fine for us to go ahead and do it but we do we vote to make it a official to work that somebody don't come along so well this that we make it official for you you know that we do so all in favor of upgrading our sound system would you signified by the raising of you and all opposed any other same sign okay then we'll go ahead and the brothers can get set on doing it to try to get everything coated well expensive you think this is a small operation but it's really not it comes with a lot of thousands of dollars to change the system around to get everything to go in but you know it's it's dire so we'll take care of all right game that so let's just saying open the eyes and my heart brother this white comes to minister the word of the Lord unto it open I want to see open the eyes of my heart the warm open the eyes of my heart I want to see [Music] I wanted to see you to see you shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy high and lived a love shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy hey man you love him today holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy holy holy I want you to see a man a man gonna be in the house of the Lord good to have everybody back everybody doing what you're supposed to do taking care of what's going on brother right Gabriel's here with us today blessings and heart good to see him today it seemed every day yeah good to see you buddy good to be here today got all the musicians here playing and like brother Louie said it is kind of when you tell people that your pastors been the pastor for 40 some-odd years they they kind of don't believe you you know because you know especially a little hometown we're from we got one church that we came out of in 1968 I mean they they don't even get them into parsonage till they get them out so and that's the truth yeah they go through a preacher about ever two three years probably and that's that's probably a long tenure in that church so it's good to be here and know that like brother Louie said that though that the message has been preached and hadn't been deviated since that time I tell you I if you read that thing that we got and it's a woman it's not a man it's a sister in Tokyo but she's the Filipino and Wow you ought to read some of the doctrines that she's been exposed to and it's same old no Holy Ghost thing it's like you know until 1963 it wasn't you didn't have the Holy Ghost that you but you didn't have the Holy Ghost until you died this is in the message you got the Holy Ghost when you died and that puts you in a sixth dimension now how easy is that Wow you know you live the way you want to I guess and then I don't have a clue it to me to me to me a false doctrine is rough but the truth is the truth the true stays all the way through Genesis from Genesis to revelations and I was I'm not on Facebook but I do have a Facebook page for my beekeeping then something popped up from a believer not too long ago and I couldn't believe what the believer believed was that when you got the Holy Ghost just like you know like brother Dale said some people's when you got the Holy gone you do get everything you need for your journey but this statue of a perfect man thing and all this other stuff I mean they the guy even said that Peter listen to this how this even Peter was under stress when he wrote first Peter about add to your he was under stressed by the Romans or somebody in that area to cause him to write that I'm like my heavens and this is a message believer this ain't somebody out in the in the in the world you know it and it just thank God for the truth thank God for the truth I don't want to stay a baby you want stay a baby I don't want that baby I mean like neither staying with us you know Nellie yeah I'd hate to have to you know bottle feeder at 14 years old 15 years old sorry see she's saying 15 there cuz why she wants to drive she's mature same way with a Christian I want to be you know I want more of God and I think if you have God in you you'll have a desire to want more of God amen so we we're just fortunate to to have the truth so let's get started with the Book of Revelations I hope you still enjoying the the seals the second seal that to me is a very wonderful seal it's red it talks about sanctification and and today we're going to kind of get into it just a little bit deeper enough I saw something they I'm kind of weird like Ryan's not here but he said that my lawnmower last year you know my lawnmower I always preach them a lawnmower and get things I'm sitting on a lawn mower so that's my holy of holies I guess there's the mail Jeep now because I saw something other days I wasn't even thinking about it and it just come to me so we'll try to share it with you maybe a little bit this afternoon some but just remember this Saturday guys and gals bring you ball bugs and bats and all the things and we'll have some fun down at the down at the park and also remember may the 4th through the 7th June and I are gonna be at brother Chris Long's Church in Arizona for a few days so we're gonna get de visite to Grand Canyon which I've never been there before so we'll get to visit that and the Sedona mountains and stuff like that so just keep us in your prayers so revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we pray today Lord that you would be with us as we speak about you Lord we know one thing's for sure you didn't go to heaven and just stay up there and tell us the thin for ourselves no you came down here and you're leading and guiding us Lord in all truth you said you'd have a people and we're just going to believe that you will have a people that is mature that knows how to handle the Word of God that knows how to live this life and then not be just a book of rules but it would be you living in human flesh again on the face of the earth Father forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are sick sister Trudy they're in the hospital Lord just touch our body just keep her safe Lord the baby doing well be a brother Kern - Lord just touch him father and bless him and touch him in his body Lord we know that things we get weary in the body sometimes and we know that you created this thing so we pray that you'd help us to to lift it up Lord all of us are getting older we're all having aches and pains and father we pray this you just help us make it through you said you would you said you'd be here you never leave us or forsake us so if we all if anybody feels forsaken remember one thing that's not true that's the devil I said a lie because you said you'd be with us even unto the consummation father give us this day our daily bread bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them a fruit for their labor father you do the speaking today bless each one is here ones that are not here Lord be with them father just take care of us in Jesus name Amen I still can't get over somebody saying that that Peter wrote first Peter or second Peter out of duress please good heavenly day he was being influenced by somebody to write the Word of God oh please no well you know what that does that makes you lazy if you got everything when you believe then you don't have to go to church you don't have to study because you got it no you're just deceived and you ain't got it I'm sorry cuz if you got it whatever is inside of you is gonna make you want more when you get to where you don't want no more of God you're either going on into another dimension or you're just lost hey man that alright revelation 6 verse 1 didn't get you standing here by saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now I want you to correlate this and make sure you remember what brother Dale is talking about the for life messengers that restored the word are these beasts that we're talking about the lion the ox the man in the eagle that's what restores what the cankerworm pom worm locust and caterpillar eat these guys which is the holy ghost in the believer is restoring the truth now the truth never left it just remember I read you the quote word brother Branham said the that the Holy Ghost had been bound by Creed's and dogmas for 2,000 years a man at the door of Creed's and dogs in the door he meant a door he met a church amen of Creed's and dogmas but it's been to be released hey man so this message at the end is a release it's to get us out of here it's not to go into another church age there's no more hey man so we can't shovel it back I guess that guy that was on the internet he just wanted to shovel it back you know well I don't need it I'll just shovel it to somebody else I don't know I just I just understand that it commits baffles and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given him he went forth conquering and to conquer and we know what that is that's that white righteous church now this is where we had today and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which was what the Ox say come and see and there went out another horse that was red now same rider but another horse which horse is the power it's the power of the people a man and power was given to him that sent their own to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword or a great word and you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the work brother Danny help me get this right here thanks sir hey bye all right say ma'am hey ma'am good day today got some liquid sunshine going on outside good song Louie sang let it rain rain rain and I was listening to it raining out the back that's all right I just hope it quits at about 5 o'clock because I got about 30 something packages of bees I got to pick up and deliver and put it in the mail tomorrow so you pray that they'll all get there safe I never had a problem before but you never know so now we've looked at the first seal in the first seal covering the first three ages amen and then we've got a lap over here because remember this one ended 606 so we were laughing it over bringing the second seal in excuse me and that will be the ops which was what was this age here that was that dark age or that was the age that Columba was the messenger and we'll read all that in just a minute but let's pull this back up one more time and see Redemption we got to see the plan of redemption now I want to show you something today that we want to that I don't think I made to clear the other day now what are we dealing with here this is what the three rings now this is all for illustrate old though I'm sorry the same guy was talking about saying that this was some kind of pyramid message listen the reason this is here is for illustration that alright this is for illustration purposes only we don't believe in a pyramid scheme or a pyramid teaching even brother Branham that was one when he said he said now I'm not talking about this pyramid teaching that's rotten okay so this is not pyramid teaching this is something comes from God it took a prophet though to place this is that Alright Paul I mean Peter couldn't place it he could live it but he couldn't place it in place that encodes look remember Peter was right down here this had not happened yet the church ages and whether and if he had not ever conferred could converse with John John hen went to Patmos when he preached second Peter I say priest he was preaching it right so he didn't know anything about these church ages he probably never even heard that he was in a these interchange I mean we got to think things like that he just knew that God gave him a commission to preach the Word of God feed my sheep feed my sheep feed my lambs Peter Peter Peter preached to my people and then and he said Peter I prayed for you because he knew Peter had a problem he said Satan is gonna sift you like sand but Peter what about Almighty God prayed for a man o mighty God prayed for you hey man before the foundation of the world he prayed for you hey man so let's don't worry about this and say this is some kind of a well My heavens this is this in the Bible he gave some apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the body that we may want grow up right I don't I just baffled who said that it's just so too simple is what it is it's too simple listen folks God can be understood by the things you do or you can't understand it amen the Godhead the Bible says is even what explained are are given to us by the things we see I'm a father I'm a son I'm a preacher I'm a postal employee I've got many many titles but today when I ride a $3,000 check I'm not going to put postal worker I'm gonna put Samuel wait down the second thankfully I'm gonna make Jim do it but I mean what would they cash it hey I'm gonna catch the title God's not gonna catch the title gonna cash your check with his name on it so this is the statue of a perfect man this man that's our example I like the one I wish we had the one I think Joe and hims got it were Christ is standing in here coach because he's the but where the body and he's the head I don't have a problem with this I just I just know that some people do have a problem with it I don't have no problem with it I like to see that I have a path that I can grow up in God and that God brought a seventh grade education man to put this together for a seventh grade education man to put it together for us I don't have a problem with that amen so now as we look I don't like to use black not when it comes to God no more use red because we're on the red horse but when you're born again you're filled out right you're sealed in a man look you're so sealed Satan can't get in and got King leave you now he's working his way out but he can't leave you I'll never leave you or forsake you so we're filling up with God that's what I said here look the breaking of the cells is not an answer serving for the Soul souls were deemed by the new bird now what is redemption of the new burnt one is the part of the new birth justification just can't st. kids baptism the Holy Ghost amen that all right this is your holy of Holy's right so look I believe yes that's the Holy Ghost that's God Almighty in human flesh your flesh right here perfect perfection amen eternal those who he's justified he's already glorified I think another day that was one thing I was thinking when I don't know what I was thinking about nice thing about male I guess and that power lays within you and you say well so-and-so went by the grave that power that he has or she has never diminished we get it opposite we think always so we know that's the power that's the power that lies inside of a person to know that you rest in an eternal condition and you got it while you were here you didn't have to get the Holy Ghost after you died heavenly days where did that come from well I do know where it come from that horse rider that's still riding in a white righteous church called a message so truth anyhow because look when the sales break it reveals Jesus Christ but it exposes the Antichrist it shows you where he is if what he's doing now we're talking we say why you're talking about these ages you ain't even got days number seven please it all culminates in our age everything culminates in our age the seals afterwards you look at Jerusalem then you look at the plays then you look at the vials and you look at the wolves it's all right here we're at the door we're at the threshold of this thing amen so now what are we talking about now listen two-fold thing God if you're born again your soul is complete like I said you're resting you're resting you're not even resting in homes but I'll hope you spent on him oh no I'm gonna spit all over and you said that does that go right yeah that part yeah I was about to he's about to get spit all over but we rest in and you should rest now where's fear in this where's fear that that's why that's why that and I'm gonna be just real honest with you down to the church agents there was a fear there was a well maybe well I don't know well there was a shadow there was a exist riders this from we come to the age in this message where this is right there's nothing else this is right what we're telling you is right whether you hear from me or whoever else it doesn't matter this message in his purity is right there's your silver sure that doesn't say statue of an imperfect man it's the stature of a perfect man this man's perfect amen cuz he pushed the old nature out and he'd come right in amen so the old you is dead there actually is no old you if there's an old youth and you've got I may be getting off a steal a little bit but it's gonna fit I promise you that's why I said divorce means listen I'm just going to be marital imagine if you're divorced today naturally you got to live in something somewhere else a man I know I got people sitting here the same way but listen and they ain't physically dead they're still alive so you can't marry again I'm just what the Prophet said amen but now if that person's dead then you're free to marry then there was it just a divorcement of a person moving him out and putting them over here no it's called eradicate it's called killed like Louise says it was taken by force and the old you is dead there is nothing left of you Jim you don't have to wash my clothes but there's nothing left of you it's all him but now look that's where we're standing at the breaking of these seals because your soul is redeemed amen right now if you're born again your soul is just as eternal as God is one day we're gonna realize that and see the power that lays inside but what's our problem here's our problem we got this big old crust that we build and it's called memory reason conscious affection imagination I never could remember imagination Jim told me one time she said imagine that so I can remember imagination now cuz I run them through I go memories and conscious affection she says imagine that so I know what imagination is but look that's not in here now that all works together listen kids if you're taking cut yourself horizontally you're not gonna see three rings we're not like a tree hey man because your body is what your soul your soul that you everything's connected alright now what we got to deal with and remember we're not going to deal with this let's take this out of the picture all right cuz it only does what that says do so we're not worried about the boat the skin of the boat we're not worried about the metal we're not worried about the the mast and up no that's just that's just a part that holds everything together actually this skin is holding what is inside me together and then you know it's your biggest organ in your body science class this is your biggest organ is your skin because it holds everything together alright joy can be a vessel for honor or dishonor remember we got it in the Bible so this is the realm that we got to deal with now look Satan can penetrate because of the fall nice thing about this the other day because remember Adam Adam was sealed in his soul was eternal he was sealed in but something happened in that next realm that's so close it's not way out here it's right that's my brother M do the three circles okay there's no gap I like what Paul said I think I got it in here where Paul says I pray that your whole body soul and spirit be made blameless hey man so he knew that there was coming a time that because he stood there one day and he said the things I would not I do the thing now what's he talking about this man no sir no ma'am he was talking bout this guy this guy's the things I would not I do the things I do it would not it's not in the flesh it's in the spirit realm so the spirit realm is what this is dealing with and then it's God trying to do this remember brother mom said flus what God's trying to do is make little avenues I'm gonna make five of them so what so he can get out cuz remember Satan can't get in there he can play in this court right here amen he can't go in this way but he sure can't get in this and play so that's what the part that's the only part way out to deal deal with you say well I'm grieved in my spirit okay what are you talking about or you agreed because of something that that you see is wrong or is it something you did wrong because you can't do wrong in your soul if you're born again you can only do wrong in your spirit realm so the spirit realm to me is what's causing God to open the seal so that we can see that not that this man look this man this man is not developing then inside the inside is not developing he's not God in a in a portion yet he said well yeah yeah but the look the same teaspoon of water you've got the full ocean in your hand but you've got a portion but remember it doesn't have to develop another chemical to be the ocean water it still has all those chemicals in it it's just that you can't put a whale in it but you can put a whale in the ocean that's what God wants God wants us to what put a whale in this ocean he wants to have enough water where he can work amen that's why I said when you're when you're born again my folks rest have no fear right what can you fear but fear itself Christian didn't say that amen but what is there to fear but let's open the doors and let gone out Wow listen you're still a free moral agent amen you're still a free moral agent and the Holy Ghost is very timid he's gonna stay right here remember the woman with the three behalf she's satisfied she's satisfied she's got the Holy Ghost she goes to church she loves God but there's more of God to want and down through the church ages like we're showing now down through these church ages they were satisfied sure they wanted more of God you understand what I mean but but you look even the songs that were developed over in here when I die hallelujah by and by all these things about dying they knew they were gonna go to grave Paul even knew he was gonna go to a great because that was the call of the age but now that thing inside of Paul never said that there's no death speaking of death in God none he didn't create death but death is the product of what the sin that man did in what in this part right here so this is what we're working on we're working on this spirit realm of man in these seven seals because remember that man right there when Adam lost fellowship with God he lost it because this came became stronger than what was inside of him that's all I can say it just became where it overwhelmed what he was thinking because we're look people you can't make God a sinner you can't make you even think bad thoughts God never had a bad thought now he knew you would but it was never a part of him he never had a bad thought he never sinned now he knew of sin but all down to the church ages man knew sure everybody knew there was coming a time when God was going to be able to work through a group of people and to work through that group of people like brother Nels preaching the word came alive straight from God in this first church age straight from God Almighty the first three and a half feet the last three and a half years of his ministry he laid it in those disciples knowing he was leaving but knowing that they were going to pick it up and carry it on they meant so he had to lay it in him so there was no like we've thought about there's there's no denomination Amen because listen I stay but this is what I was thinking about the other day when I was driving down the road I was trying to put the second seal in with the Ten Commandments now look the second seals right here right what did they do watch the second seal thou shalt have no graven images no idols what did they do in that age right there they took mercury down and put Paul up they took one down and put another one up then the Pope became their Idol they did exactly what God told him not to do in that second seal is exactly what happened they started putting up when that red horse rider remember he was given a sword so he was given a word to tell the people well that's what elevated a title all right like in like in the case of of the children of Israel Moses said we're not golden calf come from Aaron you're my preacher I'm the Prophet I've been gone for a little while I'm back now and there's this image standing here in my camp where did it come from Aaron said said now brother you're not gonna believe this but my doctrine is hello somebody my doctrine is that thing just jumped out of the fire and I'm sure Moses went you preaching a false doctrine Aaron let me straighten you out so you instead of just throwing it into the fire I believe he sprinkled it and made him eat it right didn't he sprinkle ashes and made him eat - hey you make it you eat it same way today you make it you eat it but the breaking of the seals then is not necessarily for the soul so we're coming to a place to where no one else has been before it's aware that your spirit can be can be used of God to get you somewhere why it will bring full fellowship why can't I fellowship with God my memory comes up my reasoning comes up imagination there's no imagination in God but there is memories and conscious affection imagination all right the man so to me that's what I want us to instead of just looking at these seals like we were talking about you know this is the seal right here that's okay this is the seal but the seals been broke the seals been broke now I want to see what God's gonna do behind the seal I want to see what he's because look the seal us knowing what the seals are is not going to change our body but it will help us to see that God's already done stuff for us that we haven't realized that's why I was thinking - that went brother Dale was talking about cuz it's reading the reading the questions and answers on the seals this was Saturday before he preached the Seventh Seal on Sunday he said it's gone from you you're not getting it in other words so you're you're not you're not an astronaut you're your your mental ability now not naturally but your mental ability of the word that's been preached to you you've got some comes remember when brother bottoms up there preaching he's talking about one God everything you restored back to the faith of the fathers but you've got 90% of the congregation Trinitarians so what are they going back to they're leaning back to their own understanding that they had before and he's not doing them any good unless they accept what he said that's why I told him on the sing sale he said you're not getting it's not for you networks there's too much messing up your spirit realm you have the Holy Ghost I'm not 9 they didn't have the Holy Ghost cuz remember I read you one quote we said yesterday Christian yes there Christian and now are going to heaven but worked on my body chain we're talking about seeing something that no one has ever seen before is to live it's not God everybody all right I thought I might stop for a second just to let us realize that that middle realm memory reason conscious faction imaginations that's our problem so that's what these sales are for is their loss for the redemption of the body listen when your spirit realm gets turned and it becomes more of God your body will change you know why your body's not changing now dick can get up out of the seat and tell you why you know that song the things I used to do I do them no more there's a lot to that right I mean really so what is it it's our memory it's our reasoning we our reasoning that we're dying somebody's gotta break that Abraham ninety nine years old he tried his whole 25 years to produce what God said he was going to produce finally when he got to where he could not produce nothing his body was dead I believe one day he finally said god I can't do this he said if you'd have said that 25 years Abraham you two had that child 25 years ago amen so he's got to get us to a place to where we're dead and the memory reason conscious affection listen we're not going to be zombies Louie we're not gonna be zombies like the world is but you take what the world is cousin is dead they're alive while they're dead do you know what the Bible says but I want to be that way I want to be allowing Christ while I'm dead the life that I now live I live by what the faith of the Son of God I want to tell you something here and I'm gonna put it in then we'll go back over it one more time if you'll notice as we come into sanctification now remember justification under the seals is the real you didn't do it right so now that has nothing to do with you God did that God can only justify you you can try to justify yourself all right but ain't gonna do no good but when God says when God says you're justified then it's nothing you done you accept what he did but now watch though when we get a sanctification I'm a region scripture you've got something to do right you got something to do because if you want that unclean spirit to stay where it's at it'll stay right where it's at but if you're tired of it it'll go away hey man it's something these are these are these are God's virtues but you know what it's something you do you can do it or not three beehives or 300 amen whatever why it's the same thing but I want more fellowship I want to be able to where God can use me more don't you and what are you stepping a pulpit or not I want God to be able to use me I want God to be able to use you in the capacity that you're in because let's be honest he can't if we don't let him we can't if he don't if we don't let him and the reason we're gonna let him is he's like I'm fixing to tell you the Bible says washing of the water by the word we were talking last Sunday about the red heifer but that to me that was he it was outstanding now that Israel listen folks even under bulls and goats the water of the red heifer sanctified those people the washing of the water physical water Moses had to wash Aaron from the top of his head to the sole of his foot but God accepted that nasty old man you said no he was clean no he was even his soul was dirty but he came the way God told him to come and when he did he could walk into that Holy of Holies whether he was whether he was sweating or shaking in his shoes or remembering what he did two weeks ago he walked in and said God you said if I wash if that Moses washes me I put on blue I put on green I put on this I put on that I put on this that you will justify me right and that I am sanctified by the red heifer and I hope you got that like Sunday listen folks that red heifer is a female always considered talking to the church I read you and will read it again because we're going to go over just a few minutes the church house this world gonna be sanctified we know Jesus we know that Noah when the waters came in Noah's time brother Brian said that was a type of justification right now what did he type sanctification Jesus spilt his blood at Calvary - what cleanse and claim the earth your body was in here but remember the physical chemistry of his blood is lost somewhere they couldn't collect all of his blood naturally it spilled on the ground went under Layton you know they had to clean it with water so I'm sure it wouldn't anyway but you're saying I'm saying it was the life that was in that boy and then but he had to show that to sanctify but remember he left sowho Deeley vit - he left it dies you said all they look so bad no that's what God wanted when he's sanctified and cleansed and claimed this earth to Calvary he cleansed it for every person but he knew who wouldn't in you who wouldn't and I'll promise you he was looking down through time he's got almighty in human flesh he was looking down through time and he said there's gonna come a day where they're gonna really realize what happened on this hill because they're not going to just be it's not just going to be here safe it's gonna be an absolute part of me walking on the face of the earth sanctifying this earth because when we get to the sixth seal ya God's gonna rain fire yeah God's gonna rain hurricanes and tornadoes and all by the sound of who two prophets two prophets hey six seals so sanctifies this earth what he cleans it off through two prophets amen so yes Christ died Christ did all these things amen but he left it to finish with a red heifer without spot a church oh yeah it look bad there was some black in here but that was pure white righteous people in every church age now we come to the end where it looks so bad but I promise you the bride in this age does not look back right all this other riffraff may look bad all this you don't get the Holy Ghost till you die how foolish how foolish you wait till then I promise you you gonna have a look swamp you're gonna have a moment like the Pope does you remember that guy that kills herself and he get 72 virgins when he you know that kills herself to me that's a nuts moment cuz within about two seconds after he died blows himself up he's gonna say oops the Pope is gonna say oops right why because of their teaching though it's what they've been taught but people put their life on that amen but now we've got the pure message that will bring back full fellowship between us and God God can't fellowship with error sure he waits at the ignorance of Martin Luther but he was pleased with that one little place that Martin Luther you know I was thinking as brother Dale was talking Martin Luther you know we're talking about this fourth Age Dark Age I mean pitiful sixty-eight million Christians were killed by Christians remember you know really 68 million Christians were killed by supposedly Christian you know okay so what God was doing there's the red there's the thing to find God is sanctifying that group of people to bring a church out of the ground unless the corner we'd die now look inside that to shoot his life amen there's life in there there's life in that roof and like my brother never and I like that quote the predestinated seed laid in the root listen the predestinated see the lure in those two shoes you couldn't see it that's why you you plant one apple seed every Apple that will ever come on that tree brother Larry is in that little ol bitty seed same way with God but you gotta plant it in the ground you gotta plant it in the ground Christ had to go in the ground why so we could come up sure he came up but what do you do he brought all of us with him but I like this steel but it's very rough to stay in a sanctified condition you know that we've talked about many many times before because the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in and Dry places seeking rest find this nun it's in the scripture but what does he do he comes back finds it swept and garnished what cleaned and set aside the glass was cleaned and set aside for service but if you don't put it in service if you leave a hole up here he's gonna bring and come right back in and make it worse amen make you religious you got to go on with God sure Methodists that was fine the method of doing things the church that's what I was saying before you got Martin Luther drank beer of course it was a German they drink beer like we drink tea he drank beer and smoked the pipe talked about God God said no that's not all of it that's got to be cleaned up cuz that's still closed to the world thereby all right when they say man some of you that went off to the land and I'd come back grief so anyway you got Martin Luther God was satisfied with that for the time but he said I got this I can't stay in this it's not clean as I want it so I'm gonna bring it to John Wesley and John Wesley's gonna teach a sanctified life so God said hey that's getting better cuz we need to get all this junk out we got to clean the closets out get all the junk out but remember he wasn't satisfied with that now those people have the Holy Ghost but God still couldn't work that was that big crust around that where he couldn't work right so he says why the Pentecostals oh my back into the Bible gifts tongues interpretation people haven't what joy shout praise God we might want to try that sometime listen if you don't know I've been more I'm more passionate now than I ever have been you need to be passionate about God you need to be you need to be where you think man there's more there's more you know why you know there's more cause somebody standing behind a pulpit telling you there's more you can't get it sitting at home oh you'll get more all right it won't be more God it'll be more popcorn and tea and those of you that have TVs and internet and whatever and tell about nothing like that you know that but God said okay I'm back in my church okay but I'm still like brother Dale said you know the start of sardis an agent was an unfulfilled age honestly every age was an unfulfilled day they came to a place brother Brown said they come to a place couldn't get them on way out why didn't have enough work to get them out the river they didn't have a preacher listen they didn't have a prophet like brother bright of the mouthpiece of God comes remember when God speaks it's always truth I can rest you can rest your soul I can if God speaks it's the truth whether you like it or not whether I like it or not it's the truth that's why I you know they talk about brother Branham that's not in the other I hear God I hear God and like sister Johnny you didn't know that I was gonna talk about this but since Johnny come in studies and she said somebody we were talking about you know layers 1,100 sermons she said do I have to read every book no you don't have to read every book I've got to read one book you know what God said then to read 1,100 not no word he said we're not looking at quantity this day and time we're looking at quality hey man so listen but read to understand right don't read for volume we'd understand no you don't have to listen that it'd be nice to listen to 1,100 sermons start from 47 go all the way to 65 you would be tired when you got finish and it would take you a long time but when God speaks to you to go I said when God speaks to you to go read a book or listen to a tape then he's probably wanting to talk to you through that message I didn't say probably dinner I'm sorry he is going to talk to you through that message hey man that's the same thing with these seals we have been so caught up with the white horse rider and the red horse rider and the black horse rider and the pale horse rider and we're not looking and that's what I'm trying to bring to you I'm not looking at what God's doing every step of the way it's God doing everything not Satan it's God doing this it's God realigning mind and you're thinking because I thinking in our soul is not wrong it's our thinking in our middleman it's what's wrong you ever mentioned memory reason conscious affection imagination okay well think about I want you to sit down one day and see where your biggest trouble is if your biggest trouble if your biggest trouble is that your memory says that you did something wrong and you know all that stuff that's the last like I told her she said well the devil tells me I said when the devil's lips were moving his line even when he's telling you the truth he's lying because he's got a little slant to it hey man when we start saying everything God said about us when we start saying everything God's already said about it that's when we'll big back into full fellowship so these seals to me is insurance breaking back it's showing that that Satan had all this bound because of all this junk all these different doctrines and all these different ideas all these idols all these graven images amen that's my problem I'm Idol ID le an ID oh l will make you ideally because you you know what they do is I said ten look at that I'll be whatever it may be hey man but God's not an idol he is a man he is a moving breathing living human being I don't know if you knew that or not but these seals reveals the full plan of redemption not just for the man inside he's already redeemed listen if you're born again you can't be any more Reedy in that man than you are right now you cannot there's no way if you got the whatever elements of the ocean if you got that as a tea spoon in your soul that's gone but now the outside guy or the next guy I don't say outside this is the earth that middle guy is the one we got to work with those remember sanctification under the seals is not cleaning your soul you suppose already clean that's why I'm thinking it's why brother Dale brings it so long and I read it too there's mr. Malachi 4 do two things amen restore the heart of the babbling Pentecostal babies back to the original faith of the Father and then where God can work like he never worked before they said back then but that wasn't it in his total he's to do two things the second thing is to literally turn us back you know what literally is I've reached this before literally is not an idol it's not figuratively it's not assuming literally this is listen I'm not a type of me you literally see me standing here all right so that's what brother Branham was here to do he wasn't here he was here to literally turn us back like I said before he will that bridge he reached in the warm of our mind yes we were going in the wrong direction he reached in a room of our mind and he turned us around so that we could have a birth that was correct by Malachi 4 amen so the head could comfort not be a breech birth they've had breech birth all down through here but literally turn us back man ah me brother he's gonna literally reach in your mind and change the way you think everybody but you can go hold on I don't want you in there yeah you say yeah yes you can yes you can you can say that's too rich for my blood we've been saying it for a while because we still here somebody has me but when we come to these seals though we see that rider he rides off well let's think about this other day when that wild horse rider rides off Donny who's left yeah who's left if you're already born again and this is you these people already live these ages folks so we're not talking about them people in the ages we're talking by today right now so if that white horse rider has rode away from you who's left God Almighty and he won't just standing there at the door waiting for you to say come on come on teach me something today Lord teach me something teach me because he told him and every one of these ages right but look there was a stopping point hey man there was a stopping point then another age came with another message but we don't get over here to number seven there's nothing left brother brown said we're either going down or up hey man we're going down and we're going up I don't think of I'm not even ready to quote we all right but to me this is the sanctification under this seal like I said justification we preach 10 or 11 sermons and that's gonna be a bunch this one maybe just one more now think this one was gonna be it but they made us do one more but sanctification has something for you to do you can't justify yourself brother Bramson you can't pull yourself up by your boot strap in a walk wait a minute now you say put that in the message faith in what what you did no faith in what God did for you that bursts you to me when you understand that God Almighty died so that he could kill you and come back and live inside of you you have to have faith but once you have faith once you have faith I mean how many ever saw Jesus down the cross who's Paul who's Peter who's James he's gone I don't know these people have you ever seen them no but I see the manifestation of God through them and then the manifestation of the man called Jesus because Peter and Paul can't get in you but that man can that man through the new birth that's why I see birth it's a birth if something new sister Trudy didn't have Chloe three times she had her once why it was a birth right amen but remember once you start here though this was my point for the day then being born again being born again where that memory that used to bother us don't bother snow more that reasoning that we used to reason with this don't bother some more oh my and you know what then that to me that makes me satisfied then I'm in the right age at the right time at the right place doesn't have to be Lula Georgia I'm talking at the right place in God the man the right place in God and now God you know what because what you do is it's when you do what God said he's got to do what he said he's got to do what he said it doesn't matter he's got to do what he said even if there's a prostitute that walks up in the prayer line filthy laughs but she had faith in what that little man said she said whatever he said that's what I'm gonna do and boots you get her his wife cuz her memory reason conservation imagination waiting well she knew she was a sinner but a Christian would walk up and now guarantee this is what happened brother Brown baby and he'll say you're nervous well yeah you're nervous you're standing before somebody's face to tell you what you did yesterday right so then your memory goes to work in your reasoning conservation imagination and you lose your healing because you don't have faith in what that man said you're trying to have faith in what you're trying to work up I'm sorry but let me be like the prostitute she got something hey man I once was I was a prostitute in the world but I believe what somebody told me so there I have what that's the faith of God then when you get it it's yours then add to your face add if it's not an ADD what's one plus one Danny what's one plus one what's one plus one you got to be kidding me add to your faith virtue add you add it you got something to do your sanctification I die daily why all got these scriptures been when rim yet but I want to read one and then we'll just close and I'll pick this up again well Joe y'all will use the same thing all over again sorry I got off my y'all know me I usually don't do that all right maybe I swore to you at your eye maybe it's him that today and not me but look at this pull up let's start I'm gonna read just a few at the end then we'll close first Corinthians six only been going about an hour go to first Corinthians 6:19 it's a long way through there so you'll have to get right to the end there you go now watch this this is this is Paul speaking to a group of people the watch no you're not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind look don't look those words up it ain't good just believe what it says it ain't good just believe what that says it ain't good nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners how many of y'all have I missed have I mixed anybody yet I didn't think so shall shout nut shell not now it's not be not deceived neither fornicators shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you well you think we're tough that was in Paul's congregation at one time and such were some of you but you're washed but you were sanctified now but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now that's the inside man now let's bring it out to the outside man now we know for a fact you better not be any of these in the natural form but we can be idolaters in our spirit amen thieves yes covetous yes drunkards yes drunk on the things of the world and on the things of God you understand so let's bring this up I I'm like brother Dale you have to watch what if you'll watch what brother Branham says he is talking in layers so it's Paul they're talking in layers you said he's all about talking in layers he's talking to one group of people this way another group just like the woman the two women walked out and she said he called me a buzzard the whole service and the other sisters said well he called me an eagle the whole service they heard the same thing they heard the same service but what that lady over here did is she didn't have the Holy Ghost she wasn't listening but she heard him say something that she didn't like but this sister over here was maybe in a little position that she could take what he said and she so he called me an eagle that's the same way with you and I my brother Browns preaching a message he's preaching to people in the congregation and people in the future you remember that because we weren't sitting there but we are recipients of what was saying amen so we were there in the form of the word that alright we were there in the form of the word I just got that at least thank you that's good all right let's go the next and first Thessalonians 4 1 through 4 furthermore that we beseech you brethren in his or see by the Lord Jesus that you have received of us how you ought to walk look he's preaching and to please God so you would abound more and more does that not mean grow get more and more of God Paul I'm talking to you Thessalonians you've got something but now you're gonna get more and more for ye know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is you won't know what will of God is we know what the other one is for this is the will of God even your sanctification wait a minute that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess this is something you got to do you can't justify yourself but you sure can't sanctify right at what he said and that's what he said then every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor is that all right how you gonna do that 1st Timothy 4 tells you exactly for every creature of God is good nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer you shall ask for food well--that's for everything sanctify my vessel now I tell you a little story about that we were listen when you pray over your food to bless your food do you really let's be honest don't show you him how many of you really through your mind thank God if they something wrong with that food you change it [Music] called I'll promise you you say Lord bless this food snakes find a nurse for our bodies amen you ain't thinking about that but I'll tell you what happened in my experience when I got first when I got born again back in 98 99 me and two of the other co work or two of the co-owners went with me to a restaurant and we ordered the same identical thing see how this works we order the same thing State and gravy green beans and okra same thing I said two blessing over my food they just went right on the eating course they were you know they weren't nothing but they just went around eating got a phone call six o'clock the next morning bob says are you okay I see I'm fine he said I've had state said I've been throwing up and had diarrhea since three o'clock this morning ten minutes later Barry calls they said you okay I just talked to Bob he's having the same problem I'm having throwing up diarrhea I said nope I have no problem [Applause] go change that food he changed what was in it he changed what was in it and made it honorable for me to eat and every time we went to eat afterwards they would stop and they'd say what you blip says would you bless this food so when we pray you pray that you don't know folks I won't get a restaurant you would listen you sent something back don't ever send something back they'll spit in your food they'll push I'm telling you this world is not my home but I know what these people think cuz I was part of their thinker at one time oh they used to order fillet a fish at McDonald's and I'm not gonna tell you what they put in there well it was horrible but don't but you know what if I pray and I don't know that but if I pray God will change that food if he'll change food why won't he change you and I why by the Word of God in prayer I knew to pray over my food I didn't know there's anything wrong with that steak but there was because two people testified anything right amen and they were out for the whole day and part of the next day I think they just humble I mean it was a it was a foodborne illness and it was strange we never ordered the same thing we ordered the same I did you know if I'd order chicken and they'd order steak they said well it was our state we all ordered the same identical play because we were all going to the language the man that looks good yeah that's good we'll have three of them so you know God did that yeah to testify so when you say a prayer over your food but that same prayer that you pray over your food you pray for God to sanctify you second Timothy 2:20 verse 22 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver blocks of wood and of Earth and some of honor and some dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use and prepared unto every good work 1st Corinthians 15 31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ our Lord I die daily daily sanctification Co based memories that I won't die I want to die right don't you have memories you want to die please people we should be hey man we got met but look take that thing and say look Satan God's already put that in a sea of God forgiveness that's why I'm telling you as this as this foundation of justification if you look back to where those he is justified is already to look like you look back to that justification if you put in God's ear forget if he put it in his sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again he can't put it in your memory so who does Satan all the time that's right but you know what it ought to be just a record just it's just going to turn over and you know you know how sometimes you turn on music you never listen to it you just need it for background noise just you Satan for background noise seeing you seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit but they'll read this other thing unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by what by the Word of God which liveth into by the forever now keep reading for all flesh is grass okay and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth we're withering we're withering some of us are withered some of us are withering the kids are going what's he talking about the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away look but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you let's stand our feet I'll start back over again if ice alright a couple of Sunday's the sanctification to me is a wonderful thing because you do and listen I'm just going to tell you the way I see it I know there's nothing you can do to be safe it's not by works lest any man should boast but you know what he that overcometh it feels good to overcome something hey man honestly in my humanity I feel good I felt good when I didn't have to scoop stick that stupid tobacco in my mouth and I wanted it bad till the day God saved my soul and I didn't want it no more I keep telling the guy that works down there Willis it's a post office I said Danny every time you put their stuff in your mouth you gotta spit quit putting your mouth but you know what it's a desire God put it a desire there and Satan filled it but if you take that desire and put God there that stuff will go away that's right but remember one thing folks sanctify your house sanctify your car God will actually change and you know what I just got this more shared with you that's the same thing he's gonna do with this guy if he changed the atoms in that piece of meat from being rotten to be appear enough to eat that's what's gonna change your body and it's just believing what God's already said it's not something strange we we there's no strange doctrine sanctification a red horse rider sure he rode through and he killed people literally killed sixty-eight million Christian people for what they believe in brother Bram said untold billions by his doctrine but that had to happen for that to go down and to start back up and now it's not going to go back down again folks we're going up or we're gonna take a good drastic fall all the way down so you just keep this in your prayers the brother will be here Wednesday night and then we'll have brother Sampson shady here Sunday so you'll get a break from us but we sure are enjoying these these seals I really enjoy I enjoyed my brother Dale preached him in
