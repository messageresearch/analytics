[2:43] day today and lots of things going on
[2:46] and you know there's one thing we can be
[2:49] confident of that God is still the same
[2:52] yesterday today and forever things

[2:56] a little out of sorts but he's still the
[2:58] same amen let's turn to Matthew chapter

[3:13] uh we'll we'll start on Matthew chapter
[3:15] 6 and then we'll go over to Matthew
[3:20] 13 but before we read let's go to the
[3:24] author Lord Jesus we thank you God for
[3:27] your grace to us to be able to come into
[3:29] your house
[3:30] to gather around your word Lord and I
[3:33] believe that everyone here tonight has
[3:35] one thing in common that we want to be
[3:38] more like you Lord Jesus Lord as we look
[3:41] into the mirror of your word to see
[3:44] where we stand and where we are and the
[3:46] hour that we live in Lord I pray God
[3:48] that you'll help us to achieve that goal
[3:51] to be more like you to grow more and
[3:54] Grace and stature to be to to until we
[3:57] come into the fullness of of perfect man
[4:00] Lord Jesus God that's my prayer this Mo
[4:03] this tonight Lord Jesus and I pray God
[4:05] that you'll meet every need that you'll
[4:07] meet every desire Lord tonight Lord meet
[4:11] every secret every secret desire and
[4:13] need in our hearts Lord Jesus as we come
[4:16] Lord and Lord I barely know what to say
[4:19] Lord Jesus but you know all things you
[4:22] have the end in the be in the beginning
[4:25] everything in your hands Lord Jesus you
[4:27] got Lord we just put tonight in your
[4:29] hands Lord Jesus that you'll come and
[4:31] you'll have the preeminence in our lives
[4:34] and in their service Lord as we read
[4:37] this scripture Lord that you'll just
[4:38] come and open it to us Lord because how
[4:40] could we have any understanding how
[4:42] could we have a relationship with you
[4:44] how could we know anything about what
[4:46] your word says unless you come and
[4:48] reveal it unless you come and Quicken it
[4:50] with your spirit Lord we come believing
[4:52] and trusting in you that you'll open it
[4:54] to us and cause us to catch the message
[4:57] we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:59] Christ
[5:00] thank him for his presence here
[5:04] tonight Matthew chapter 6 verse one take
[5:08] heed that you do not your arms before
[5:11] men to be seen of them otherwise you
[5:14] have no reward of your father which is
[5:16] in heaven that's right therefore when
[5:19] thou doest thine arms do not sound a
[5:22] trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do
[5:24] in the synagogues and in the streets
[5:27] that they may have Glory of men verily I
[5:30] say unto you they have their reward but
[5:33] when thou doest arms let not thy left
[5:35] hand know what thy right hand
[5:38] doeth that thine arms may be in secret
[5:42] and thy father which seeth in secret
[5:44] himself shall reward thee openly
[5:48] amen and when thou prayest Thou shalt
[5:52] not be as the Hypocrites are for they
[5:54] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[5:57] and in the corners of the streets that
[5:58] they may be seen seen of men verily I
[6:01] say unto you they have their reward but
[6:04] thou when thou prayest enter into thy
[6:07] closet and when thou has shut thy door
[6:09] pray to thy father which is in secret
[6:12] and thy father which seeth in secret
[6:14] shall reward thee openly amen now let's
[6:17] turn over to Matthew chapter
[6:28] 13
[6:36] 33 another Parable spake ye unto them
[6:39] the Kingdom of Heaven is like un 11
[6:42] which a woman took and hid in three
[6:45] measures of meal till the whole was
[6:47] living you may be seated the Lord at his
[6:49] Blessing to the reading of the
[6:51] word every time that you read the word
[6:55] you get a blessing even if you don't
[6:57] understand it all it's still a blessing
[7:00] right and this morning this tonight I uh
[7:05] let me get the time of day
[7:07] straight tonight I I want to take a a
[7:10] maybe a strange topic but I I got to
[7:13] thinking on the the lonely Christian and
[7:17] maybe that almost sounds like a a topic
[7:19] for a
[7:21] western you hear that western music
[7:24] playing but the the lonely Christian and
[7:28] you know I I when I stand outside the
[7:31] door you know shaking hands and and
[7:33] whatnot I I there's that picture that
[7:35] right across from where I stand where I
[7:38] usually stand and and and I I got to
[7:40] where I love looking at that picture of
[7:42] the pillar fire over the children of
[7:45] Israel and all the all the children of
[7:47] Israel are encamped around about the
[7:49] children of fire and they you I I got to
[7:54] thinking about what they you know you
[7:57] just stand looking at that picture and
[7:58] think about what what they must have
[8:01] thought as they sat there and they could
[8:03] see the pillar of fire they could see
[8:05] the signs and wonders made manifest in
[8:08] their midst they could see God among
[8:11] them and then the years began to roll by
[8:15] right and you know each each they were
[8:19] all gathered around the pillar of fire
[8:21] all of them together but if you look
[8:23] closely there's little individual tents
[8:27] and each one of those tents has a little
[8:29] light inside of it that's right am and I
[8:32] want to kind of narrow down because you
[8:34] know we if I I'm looking out at the
[8:37] crowd tonight and we're all gathered
[8:40] around maybe kind of like how they were
[8:42] gathered around that Pillar of Fire
[8:44] we're gathered around the word of God
[8:46] the shed blood gathered around the
[8:49] carcass and but each each one of us is a
[8:54] little individual liqu of fire that that
[8:58] is May maybe the the lonely Christian
[9:01] you're you're going through life and
[9:04] each one of us has to work out our own
[9:06] salvation with fear and trembling each
[9:09] one of us has a lonely Journey but maybe
[9:13] I could prove to you today that we're
[9:15] not lonely because he said he'd never
[9:17] leave us or forsake us he'd always be
[9:20] with us he promised us a comforter that
[9:22] would come and take us through this
[9:24] journey of life now now let's go back to
[9:27] that little picture because because as
[9:30] as the years began to grow by I believe
[9:33] and and you we can see by scripture that
[9:36] that they began to lose sight of what
[9:39] they were there for and you know now in
[9:43] this day it kind of parallels their
[9:45] Journey how just about time they were be
[9:48] they were ready to cross over and claim
[9:51] their inheritance what God had given
[9:53] them they god-given right then God began
[9:57] God sent something allow something to
[9:59] come that would shake things up and we
[10:02] know in Isaiah that it's promised that
[10:04] that the heavens and earth will be
[10:06] shaken everything will be shaken and
[10:09] everything that can be shaken will be
[10:11] shaken except that which is anchored in
[10:16] something that cannot be moved that is
[10:19] immovable and I I remember uh years ago
[10:23] standing in the supermarket line they
[10:24] had a a uh one of those little pamphlets
[10:28] about different things different strange
[10:30] happenings around the world it was just
[10:33] a a little thing maybe for little
[10:34] kitties to read and what struck my
[10:36] attention that it still holds yeah I
[10:39] still remember it to this day was a
[10:41] little article that about this uh a post
[10:45] in
[10:46] England that they they came across and
[10:49] they they dug down and they begin to dig
[10:52] and dig and it went further and further
[10:54] into the ground and and after a lot of
[10:58] uh asking around they found on the
[11:00] opposite side of the earth there was
[11:03] another post and as far as they dug that
[11:07] post went down into the ground as far as
[11:10] they dug they couldn't get to the bottom
[11:13] of it now I I've tried to find uh that
[11:16] story uh later on so I don't know if
[11:21] that particular story is true but I I
[11:23] kind of compare that to how faith is
[11:26] when you become when you receive the new
[11:28] birth because faith is anchored down so
[11:31] far that it is not shakable you cannot
[11:34] what what are you going to come up
[11:36] against with some kind of theology some
[11:38] kind of new new doctrine new thing that
[11:41] will disprove what God has given to you
[11:44] in a personal relationship that's right
[11:46] what he's given to you like those little
[11:49] camped out Believers around the pillar
[11:50] of fire should have had an a personal
[11:53] experience just like Joshua and Caleb I
[11:56] believe Joshua and Caleb knew something
[11:58] they knew something something personal
[11:59] when they all the other ones came back
[12:02] from kades barnea and said we can't do
[12:04] it and Joshua and Caleb rent their
[12:06] clothes and everybody else tried to kill
[12:08] them and then the fire came out and and
[12:11] uh and and began to devour and things
[12:14] because they knew that God was still the
[12:17] same yesterday today and forever they
[12:20] knew who he was they had something
[12:23] person a personal experience they had
[12:25] seen God working in moses' life they had
[12:28] seen him there manifesting himself and
[12:30] they knew that there was no way that
[12:32] they could come could come out of
[12:33] bondage without God delivering them that
[12:36] there was no way he could have done it
[12:38] without him making a way for
[12:41] them Lord and God I think back to how
[12:47] loneliness first began to play a role in
[12:51] the Christian story loneliness is what
[12:53] started the whole thing because God way
[12:56] back Bey beyond the be beginning of the
[12:59] beginnings was alone and he wanted and I
[13:04] got to thinking about this because he we
[13:07] were inside of him but we weren't he
[13:10] wasn't like some grotesque figur you
[13:12] know like half man half woman or
[13:15] something like that but we were we were
[13:17] attributes that were waiting to be
[13:19] expressed within from him and he was
[13:22] longing and lonely for that attribute
[13:25] those attributes to be made manifest he
[13:27] was something within was craving to to
[13:31] to fellowship with what was within him
[13:34] am and when that was made manifest and
[13:38] Adam and Eve took leevan took some other
[13:42] idea something that's from something
[13:45] that was contrary to God then God looked
[13:48] at what at his attributes expressed
[13:51] walking away from his word from himself
[13:55] and he
[13:57] saw y'all excuse me yeah he saw he he
[14:03] saw what he had longed to see made
[14:06] manifest leaving and deserting going
[14:09] going the opposite direction and there
[14:12] was there's real
[14:14] loneliness and look look at this picture
[14:17] now God looked upon the scene and he
[14:20] didn't just sit back and sit back in
[14:22] like the proverbial recliner and say
[14:25] well I'm going to leave well enough
[14:26] alone but he was fervent to do whatever
[14:30] it took whatever the cost was to get
[14:34] back into fellowship with us whatever it
[14:37] takes whatever the cost is he was
[14:40] willing to pay it all to lay down
[14:43] everything so that he could come back
[14:45] and reclaim to to pay the P Price so
[14:49] that he didn't have to be lonely
[14:51] anymore loneliness and a the believer
[14:56] the whole relationship with God comes
[14:58] down to an individual Affair an
[15:00] individual relationship with God back in
[15:04] the Garden of Eden when Adam every every
[15:06] even and Adam would come and and he
[15:08] would wait for God to come down and and
[15:11] pay him a visit and I don't believe that
[15:13] God would have to maybe God just to
[15:15] paint a little picture maybe he was
[15:18] looking at the calendar waiting counting
[15:21] down the time counting down the time for
[15:23] when he could come and fellowship with
[15:25] Adam and maybe ad Adam was doing the
[15:28] same thing counting down the hours until
[15:30] he could come and fellowship with God
[15:33] and and and hear the word and now Adam
[15:36] in that situation longing to have
[15:39] fellowship with God despairing to be
[15:42] alone wanting to have wanting to be one
[15:45] with God uniting around the word and now
[15:47] today we can't even come to church we
[15:49] can't even sit we can't we we count the
[15:52] hours that we're away from church we
[15:57] uh we're we should be long and we should
[16:00] be fervent not in Sunday School uh we
[16:04] were looking at how Jesus uh talked
[16:07] about when John came on the earth that
[16:09] the believer the people began to be so
[16:11] fervent that it was almost like violence
[16:14] that they became so violently in fervor
[16:17] of of the word and of trying to hear the
[16:20] word that they would sit for hours
[16:22] longing to listen longing to get just
[16:25] one little Glimpse that maybe they
[16:27] didn't understand when he began to speak
[16:29] about the Deep things maybe they the
[16:31] many of the things that he talked about
[16:33] were so far over their head or just so
[16:36] mysterious because he said he he spoke
[16:38] in Parables and spoke in a way that many
[16:42] couldn't understand but yet they were
[16:44] they knew that this man spoke from from
[16:47] a a way that wasn't from theology it
[16:50] wasn't from some he didn't learn it from
[16:52] some Seminary but he knew it because
[16:55] something within him within him was was
[16:57] whirling that will in the middle of the
[16:59] wheel that was spoken throughout all
[17:01] scripture was that would the the great
[17:03] teacher that will would one day come and
[17:06] live inside of the Flesh of Believers
[17:08] and teach us was there to teach them and
[17:11] they hungered and longed for it and they
[17:13] sat on the hill longing until they
[17:16] didn't care if they did if they were
[17:19] hungry they didn't care if they were
[17:21] tired but they came regardless they came
[17:23] because there was something in them
[17:25] drawing and they were violently enthus
[17:28] to whatever it takes whatever it takes
[17:31] if I have to leave my family leave my
[17:34] job leave whatever to go and sit on this
[17:37] Hillside and listen to this one that
[17:39] I've been longing to hear my whole life
[17:42] and
[17:45] they I I was looking down through
[17:48] scripture and this is a common trait for
[17:52] everyone that come comes to God comes
[17:55] individually and comes with a fervency
[17:58] that God will satisfy now in the Old
[18:01] Testament Jacob it is we the story of
[18:05] Jacob is told how he when when he was in
[18:09] the the depths of Despair and so lonely
[18:13] he was coming to meet his brother who he
[18:15] was afraid was going to kill him because
[18:18] of what he had done to him how he had
[18:19] stolen the birthright and and did
[18:21] according to the Natural ey did horrible
[18:24] things to his brother and you know Esau
[18:26] had even decare that he would do Jacob
[18:29] harm he had every right to think that
[18:31] Jake that Esau was going to do him harm
[18:33] and and so he sent in his wisdom he sent
[18:37] uh his family over and and little groups
[18:39] to to kind of soften Esau's heart and
[18:42] then he stayed behind and camped the
[18:44] night over because he wanted to be alone
[18:47] with
[18:49] God and I uh here here we go I knew I
[18:52] had the scripture somewhere written in
[18:54] Genesis 32:24 and Jacob was left alone
[18:59] and there Wrestled a man with him until
[19:01] the breaking of the day and Jacob was
[19:04] left alone that might be some of the
[19:05] most powerful words there just little
[19:07] four little words in the Bible because
[19:10] that is how we meet God alone alone
[19:14] brother Brenham came down to that little
[19:16] shed and he had an experience where the
[19:19] he saw that light that cross come into
[19:21] his his heart because he was alone and
[19:23] Jacob was alone he was longing for
[19:26] something that where could he turned who
[19:29] could he turn to he was in he was lonely
[19:32] and the only man that could satisfy that
[19:35] longing was the man that he met that
[19:38] night when he was alone and wrestled
[19:40] with him and wrestled with him that's
[19:42] that's an instance in the Bible of real
[19:45] violence a man that turned so was so
[19:48] desperate for something from God that he
[19:50] became violent and he became and he
[19:52] wrestled with God and he said I'll not
[19:54] Turn You Loose until I get my
[19:57] blessing that's how you get a blessing
[19:59] from God is when you're so longing so
[20:02] desperate for something and I I wonder
[20:04] how many times we don't get the
[20:06] blessings that we seek and the blessings
[20:08] that we need because we're not desperate
[20:11] enough to do anything to lay down
[20:13] everything we're not desperate enough to
[20:16] stop looking at the clock long enough to
[20:18] get down on our knees and pray and seek
[20:21] God for a blessing for our children and
[20:23] for our church and for our families and
[20:25] for our homes and for ourselves that God
[20:28] I know that in this Bible these
[20:30] blessings that you spoke about are here
[20:32] waiting for me to receive now God give
[20:35] them and make them manifest in my life
[20:37] make them manifest make them live in me
[20:40] make the stature of a perfect man that
[20:41] brother Dale brother Wade and and all
[20:43] these brothers have spoke about Let It
[20:45] Be Alive in me let it be real and how I
[20:49] believe that if we'll do that if we'll
[20:51] come with aacy with a a longing in our
[20:54] heart just like Jacob did just like
[20:56] these men of old that were were alone
[20:58] with God like Abraham and Isaac the the
[21:01] Father the foundation of the church was
[21:04] built upon these brothers faith if we'll
[21:06] come like that then God is HonorBound to
[21:10] to to meet us based upon his word he's
[21:12] HonorBound to give us what's been
[21:18] promised it's
[21:20] not when we look at God's
[21:24] word you know plenty of theologians have
[21:27] studied the script
[21:29] and have no life right plenty of
[21:32] theologians have looked at the scripture
[21:33] it's not just about how much you know
[21:36] but it's about how much you know him and
[21:40] you know we think about how if I if I
[21:43] can just study enough but look at all
[21:46] the uh I now don't get me wrong studying
[21:50] is a has a place right of course it does
[21:54] but now look at all the the men and and
[21:57] and and people singing Austine and all
[21:59] the other ones that that had a deep
[22:02] understanding according to the theology
[22:05] according to school according to what
[22:08] they what they did they could they could
[22:11] understand according to Baptist Theology
[22:13] and take any denomination any sect and
[22:15] could understand it and explain it in a
[22:17] way that uh would just confound the wise
[22:21] but yet had no understanding look look
[22:24] when on the day of Pentecost these
[22:26] little fishermen little the the the just
[22:30] the offs scour of the Earth according to
[22:32] the world suddenly had a deeper
[22:36] understanding than men and women uh that
[22:38] had that had labored under theology
[22:41] under Galeo and so forth because they
[22:47] had something they had a a relationship
[22:51] with God a personal
[22:53] experience
[22:55] now in the Old Testament
[22:58] the priest when he would go into the
[23:00] holy of
[23:02] holies he would check up with that and
[23:05] make sure that everything was right as
[23:07] he approached in to the holy of holies
[23:09] and I I compare this now with this
[23:14] checking up time as the the the children
[23:17] of Israel were they were encamped around
[23:20] the pillar of fire and they failed I
[23:23] believe to keep checking up every hour
[23:26] to keep checking up and comparing what
[23:28] they believed with the message that
[23:31] Moses preached with the message with the
[23:33] word that was being carried in the Ark
[23:35] of the Covenant they failed to check up
[23:38] and before long balum came in with
[23:41] something a little bit off that seemed
[23:43] correct that seemed right and and they
[23:46] became sidetracked and they they the
[23:50] shaking came and they fell they they
[23:53] were shaken because of what
[23:56] happened
[23:59] now the Old Testament priest would get
[24:01] it go into the holy of holies and he
[24:03] would check up everything on him
[24:06] everything to make sure that everything
[24:08] was correct everything was in line that
[24:11] everything was uh was just perfectly uh
[24:16] not one pomegranate off not one little
[24:18] bell not one little little piece of an
[24:22] anointing oil or one uh little piece of
[24:24] His Garment because if one little thing
[24:27] was off then he had he had no right to
[24:30] begin with to go into that holy of
[24:32] holies but it was God that had made a
[24:35] special provision for him to go beyond
[24:37] that Veil that was sealed off until the
[24:40] day that the atonement had been made
[24:43] then then all the Believers could go
[24:45] Beyond the Veil but God had made a way
[24:48] so that that priest could go Beyond the
[24:50] Veil as long as he met every one of
[24:54] God's requirements right every one of
[24:57] God's requirements had to be met and
[24:59] just in case he missed one he had to
[25:02] leave that string hanging out that rope
[25:05] so that they could pull his dead body
[25:08] back from Beyond the Veil if he failed
[25:10] to meet every single requirement now
[25:14] what about us in this day when we have a
[25:18] uh a standard laid before us we have a
[25:20] goal and the goal is a goal that has
[25:23] never been met before in the history of
[25:27] Christian om of of judum whatever you
[25:30] want to call it and the goal is to take
[25:32] a body change the goal is to take for
[25:36] our flesh to be changed to be like him
[25:40] and now I believe I I said in my prayer
[25:42] that I believe that everyone in this
[25:44] building tonight our desire is a common
[25:48] desire a desire to be more like him and
[25:52] that's what our common goal is to grow
[25:55] closer and closer and closer to to him
[25:58] until one day our bodies will all be
[26:00] changed and if if that is our goal then
[26:04] shouldn't we be checking up every hour
[26:06] shouldn't we be checking up every hour
[26:08] with the same fervency that Jacob did
[26:11] that all the saints of old had such a
[26:14] fervency to be close to God to get to do
[26:18] to meet every requirement that's right
[26:20] to get to to uh to take care of things
[26:25] to meet God's word but God the the devil
[26:29] in this in this late hour gives he gives
[26:31] us so many distractions so many things
[26:34] to get in the way and he get and we many
[26:38] times will accept we we create all these
[26:41] little excuses but I I that I just want
[26:44] to encourage you to not to to to be
[26:48] fervent to be violently fervent fervent
[26:51] like Jacob was that would wrestle with
[26:53] the angel until he got what he want now
[26:56] uh Abraham when that angel came to him I
[27:00] I believe uh if I remember right Genesis
[27:03] 17 was was the type of the new birth
[27:06] walk before me in Genesis and then after
[27:08] he got the new birth then in Genesis 18
[27:12] the angel came to him the uh the the
[27:14] Lord himself with the two angels and
[27:16] began to open to him the secret
[27:19] Mysteries the Hidden Mysteries and when
[27:22] the angel came to Abraham Abraham made
[27:26] three uh he made uh he he he made it
[27:30] three measures of fine meal is what he
[27:33] told Sarah to go and prepare and now we
[27:37] want to I want to turn over to
[27:40] um Matthew
[27:45] 13:33 and we'll kind of look at
[27:51] that because down through scripture
[27:53] these three measures of
[27:55] meal right are
[27:58] used in in different
[28:01] places and they have a common meaning I
[28:06] believe another Parable speaky unto them
[28:10] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
[28:12] leaven which a woman took and hid in
[28:14] three measures of meal y till the whole
[28:17] was living
[28:18] right and my what a controversial topic
[28:22] this is right this has been debated and
[28:25] and bounced around in so many different
[28:27] ways
[28:27] will say well this this uh this leav
[28:32] represents in the in the fourth Church
[28:34] age is what I I I I like to see what
[28:37] other people have to say about it and
[28:40] and one person said well this this leev
[28:42] represents in the fourth Church age the
[28:44] everything was eaten down in the in the
[28:46] Dark Ages that everything was eaten down
[28:49] until there was nothing left but you
[28:52] know brother brandham said that there
[28:53] was there was still a root right and and
[28:56] a little bit of stem that was left it
[28:57] wasn't all eaten it wasn't completely
[29:00] done
[29:02] away and uh it it it escapes me right
[29:06] now some of the other things but so many
[29:08] different things but now he says the
[29:10] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven
[29:15] like unto Le and we're comparing we're
[29:18] comparing two things leaven now brother
[29:20] brandham said that the church won't have
[29:22] any living in them right there won't be
[29:24] one spot of living but the kingdom of
[29:27] heaven is like under living and if you
[29:29] go back to your English class you'll
[29:31] remember this is a simile because a
[29:34] simile uses like you stick like in there
[29:37] and you can have you you can say Well
[29:39] when he's angry he's like a fierce Tiger
[29:44] but he's not actually a fierce tiger
[29:46] he's like a fierce tiger and we can look
[29:49] at a tiger and learn a little bit about
[29:52] what this man is like when he's angry
[29:54] amen by looking at the tiger that's
[29:57] right and you can say that about a lot
[29:59] of things this uh uh well right here the
[30:03] Kingdom of Heaven Y is like under leaven
[30:07] right which a woman took yeah and hid in
[30:10] three measures of meal till the whole
[30:13] was leav exactly amen she took the leav
[30:16] and she hid it in three measures of meal
[30:19] one 2 3 until the whole thing was
[30:23] completely consumed by the leaven the
[30:27] whole thing after this process was
[30:31] completed was took on the nature of the
[30:34] leaven now if you look at what leaven is
[30:37] down through scripture leevan is the
[30:39] teaching is the doctrine and in the be
[30:42] very beginning in Genesis they Adam and
[30:45] Eve took the leaven of The Serpent and
[30:50] that leaven produced it it produced
[30:53] loneliness and and despair and
[30:56] everything that we see today but now
[30:59] this is not that leaven this is a secret
[31:02] teaching a hidden Mystery that God has
[31:05] given to us in this last day to overcome
[31:09] now this is speaking of the church and
[31:12] an individual because now when we look
[31:14] at that little picture of the of the
[31:16] children of Israel camped around the
[31:19] pillar of fire we can see the
[31:21] relationship of the whole church of all
[31:24] of the children of Israel together
[31:26] surrounding the pillar of fire with a
[31:27] pillar of fire in the middle and we can
[31:31] see in each camp in each individual tent
[31:34] there's a light in each individual tent
[31:38] now on the day of Pentecost something
[31:41] happened that United began to unite the
[31:44] church it began to unite all of the all
[31:48] of the Believers that before they were
[31:50] bickering and fighting and trying to
[31:52] figure out who was going to be the
[31:53] greatest and who was who was going to
[31:55] sit on his right hand and and they had
[31:58] so many differences and now look around
[32:01] today and you can see in every it's
[32:03] almost like there's there's uh I was
[32:06] reading how that um in the early 1900s
[32:09] there were something like 23,000
[32:11] different denominations in the year
[32:13] 2,000 there's
[32:14] 43,000 if you just look at the
[32:16] denominations everybody has a little
[32:19] something a little bit different idea
[32:22] about it and they're trying
[32:25] they're how can you take all these
[32:28] 43,000 different
[32:30] beliefs how are they United well they're
[32:33] not they're divided by their little
[32:35] their little differences their little
[32:38] their little uh disagreements now maybe
[32:41] you could almost say that about the
[32:43] message today because if you look at
[32:45] each little church where uh you know we
[32:48] you can
[32:50] almost we used to talk about how when
[32:52] you when you'd introduce yourself to
[32:54] somebody they would check to see what
[32:56] church you're from from because then
[32:57] they' put you into a peg hole of what
[32:59] you believ cuz every little church it
[33:01] seems like has a different belief has a
[33:04] different idea about things but we're
[33:07] supposed to be uniting and how are you
[33:09] we uniting how are we
[33:12] uniting now exactly right
[33:16] now you you may have noticed in the news
[33:20] that the pope is trying to unite he's
[33:24] trying to unite the world now look look
[33:26] how doing it now now we're looking at
[33:29] the three measures of meal now this same
[33:32] way that God is uniting his church is is
[33:37] paralleled by the way that the pope is
[33:40] trying to unite let's go back in history
[33:43] in
[33:44] 1999 the pope put forth uh this document
[33:49] called the J DDJ and I forget what the
[33:52] first two letters mean but the last two
[33:54] are the doctrine of justification yeah
[33:57] and he put forth this document that the
[34:00] lutherans and the Catholics signed
[34:03] together and they said now we believe we
[34:06] come together and we believe that we can
[34:09] we can agree on the doctrine of
[34:11] justification now Martin Luther said
[34:13] that the doctrine of justification and
[34:15] I'm paraphrasing but the doctrine of
[34:17] justification was the hinge on the re
[34:20] Reformation that's what the whole
[34:21] Reformation was about how can the Luther
[34:25] how could the Lutheran and the Catholic
[34:27] agree together when everything that
[34:30] Martin Luther fought for was so
[34:32] different from what the Catholics
[34:34] believe Works versus justified by the
[34:36] blood of Jesus Christ but yet they came
[34:40] together with this document and they put
[34:42] their pin and and they they signed it
[34:44] that now we believe now now look we go
[34:49] from
[34:50] justification to
[34:52] sanctification to Pentecost and that is
[34:55] just what the pope is doing doing
[34:57] because in
[34:59] 2006 he took that same document the jddj
[35:03] and he took it over to the Methodist and
[35:06] they signed it we believe that we have
[35:09] the same doctrine of justification and
[35:12] we are united with you in belief of this
[35:16] doctrine that we we believe that we have
[35:19] the same kind of Fellowship that we
[35:21] believe the same thing now
[35:24] he's he's he the you know I I don't know
[35:28] if anybody any of you have seen that
[35:30] that video that the pope made for
[35:32] Kenneth uh copelan that where where he
[35:35] he's now he's coming with the Pentecost
[35:39] to unite with them in that same process
[35:43] of
[35:44] Lutheran methodists Pentecost and he's
[35:48] trying to unite together on around
[35:52] living around some theology around
[35:55] something that's you can't if you dig
[35:58] far enough down you'll find the bottom
[36:01] but if you dig far enough down with the
[36:04] revelation of God's word somebody that's
[36:06] planted and rooted in him you'll you
[36:09] can't find the bottom it'll just go and
[36:11] go it's so you're anchored in something
[36:13] that's Eternal that cannot be
[36:16] shaken and now we'll find that the
[36:20] church on the day of Pentecost began to
[36:24] be United around a personal experience
[36:27] that God was doing something for each
[36:29] individual believer and he visited them
[36:32] when when they came together they they
[36:35] they were not United they they were
[36:38] United around just just following God
[36:41] let he told us to go and wait in this
[36:44] upper room and so that's what I'm going
[36:46] to do but in the natural they still had
[36:49] their little differences but when they
[36:51] came together in the in one Accord then
[36:54] they put aside all of their differences
[36:56] because because they met something there
[36:58] they met something that was real and I I
[37:01] know and you know as we leave the doors
[37:04] tonight many of us we in the flesh we
[37:07] still have differences in things but
[37:10] there's something that's uniting us the
[37:12] same thing that United them the same
[37:15] thing that United them is uniting us
[37:17] today it's the revelation of God's word
[37:20] it's a personal experience with God is
[37:23] so God doing something in our
[37:25] midst
[37:27] Amen Let me find out where I
[37:35] am he unites Us by visiting us
[37:40] individually one at a
[37:42] time and takes us from being a lonely
[37:45] Christian right to one that has a
[37:47] comforter right and that comforter grows
[37:50] in us uh grow that as as we partake of
[37:55] the word
[37:57] as we uh now I I was thinking about this
[38:01] today this little uh as I was sitting in
[38:03] a meeting supposed to be
[38:07] listening but now this
[38:10] woman she took this leaven and hid it
[38:14] into three measures of meal and and
[38:16] think about now how Bread is made Bread
[38:19] is made by you take the ingredients and
[38:22] you put it all into the dough and you
[38:24] begin to knead and punch it and move it
[38:27] and roll it until you get it in just the
[38:30] right consistency and just the right way
[38:33] now when a Believer needs the bread I
[38:37] believe the way that they need instead
[38:39] of punching and rolling is they get the
[38:42] Bible out and they turn the page and
[38:45] they turn the p and they get the message
[38:47] book out and they turn the page they get
[38:50] the tape out and put it in the player
[38:52] and press play and they get their knees
[38:55] down on the floor floor and they put and
[38:58] that's how they need they get their
[39:01] hands and their feet in the car and they
[39:05] drive to church and they're needeing
[39:10] they they're needing that bread and when
[39:14] you get that you take out the message
[39:17] book and you take you open it up and you
[39:20] read and you you're getting a secret
[39:23] something that was hidden from before
[39:25] the found of the world now we have
[39:27] something so special I wonder if maybe
[39:30] we realize how special it is how special
[39:34] the messenger that we have is how
[39:37] special of people we are to have have
[39:40] heard the message that God gave us in
[39:43] this last day to take us to the goal of
[39:46] a body change now the
[39:49] messenger the messenger that we have in
[39:52] this day was so special because he he
[39:55] brought a hidden message that unveiled
[39:58] that opened up everything that that tied
[40:01] up every loose sin all the all the
[40:04] previous ages they had little questions
[40:06] about how exactly this works scriptures
[40:09] that the preachers wouldn't touch aren't
[40:12] you glad that we have we have authority
[40:15] and and the right and the understanding
[40:16] that we don't have to skip over
[40:18] scriptures that I don't understand what
[40:20] that means that we got to skip over it
[40:23] but we can we can touch on every
[40:26] scripture from the beginning to the end
[40:29] how Abel's sacrifice was accepted to the
[40:32] uh all the way to the Seven Seals has
[40:34] been opened what a blessed people we are
[40:38] and how all these things that God has
[40:41] given us and the Bible says that we
[40:44] should redeem the time I believe we'll
[40:46] be held accountable for that one day if
[40:48] brother brandom said that we'll be held
[40:50] accountable for uh throwing food away in
[40:53] the trash can without eating it then
[40:55] what about the time that we don't redeem
[40:57] that we waste by watching TV and reading
[41:01] comics and filthiness and when when we
[41:04] should be Redeeming the time to meet the
[41:07] goal that God has predestinated us for
[41:10] based on for knowledge of our desire I
[41:13] believe it that if we'll have if we have
[41:15] a desire for it that God has put
[41:18] everything in place he's put everything
[41:20] right in our laps he's laid it out for
[41:22] us he's laid it out just like the
[41:25] children of is at it yes sir you know
[41:27] all they had to do was step outside
[41:30] their door every morning and there on
[41:33] the ground was the Mana it was laying on
[41:35] the ground right there for them and what
[41:38] did they do they begin to complain what
[41:40] complain there there's too many message
[41:43] books there's too much stuff to read
[41:46] there's too much
[41:48] blessing there's too much I do is that
[41:52] how we feel that I wish I was back in
[41:54] bondage with that old oh nasty
[41:57] denominational filth I wish I was back
[42:00] in that excuse me for speaking plain
[42:04] but when all of these blessings that we
[42:07] have and we'll squander it now just like
[42:09] they did they would rather have the old
[42:11] Gars garlic and bitter herbs and things
[42:14] then and what do we do we have all the
[42:17] message books lined up on our shelves
[42:19] Gathering dust we look over there and we
[42:22] yeah we've got the message books just
[42:24] like yeah they had they had the killer
[42:26] of fire in the camp but did they have a
[42:30] personal revelation a personal
[42:32] experience that would carry them over
[42:34] the river Jordan that would carry them
[42:36] over and when when balum came with his
[42:38] doctrines and all the midianites and
[42:40] moabi women's a distraction when they
[42:42] came in were they sealed in enough were
[42:46] they was their faith rocked solid enough
[42:49] that that distraction would not be a
[42:52] distraction and I believe that that's
[42:54] how we've got to be we've got to be just
[42:57] like God was in the beginning when he
[42:59] came down and said I don't care what it
[43:02] takes now he came down and and and just
[43:08] abandoned every pretense of any kind of
[43:11] uh restraint whatever it takes for me to
[43:15] take these people to reclaim my
[43:17] possession and now that's how we have to
[43:20] be to approach
[43:22] him to
[43:24] uh to get our
[43:27] blessing
[43:30] now I'm going to take a break and get
[43:32] some
[43:34] water I feel like a Thirsty
[43:53] Camel I love y'all amen
[43:59] but now in the Old
[44:02] Testament the the Believers just like
[44:05] this three measures of meal typifies a
[44:09] journey the Believers in the Old
[44:11] Testament started on a
[44:15] journey under the shed blood of the lamb
[44:18] and where did they start their Journey
[44:20] but they started it alone and Moses came
[44:23] forth with the Commandment if you're not
[44:26] under the shed blood then then God will
[44:29] come through and the Death Angel will
[44:31] will come through and and and take your
[44:34] first born but now they didn't all come
[44:37] under a great big building they didn't
[44:40] all gather under a great big tent or or
[44:43] even out in the open or anything like
[44:46] that but they went each into their own
[44:49] home
[44:51] alone and they put they had to put the
[44:53] blood over the Len of them their
[44:57] door now if the door if take this into
[45:01] today if the if the blood is over the
[45:03] door of this church then that's not
[45:06] going to do you any good because it's
[45:09] got to be over the door of your heart of
[45:12] your individual Rel you've got to have a
[45:15] personal relationship and God has to see
[45:19] that relationship on display it's got to
[45:22] be made manifest it's got to be visible
[45:26] right it's got to be where God can look
[45:28] at you and say I see myself reflected
[45:30] back when I I see what I saw what was in
[45:35] me in the beginning I can look at you
[45:37] and see that you're hungering and
[45:39] thirsting after righteousness that
[45:41] you're hungering and thirsting for a
[45:42] relationship with me my imagine how what
[45:45] a what just a horrible almost a slap in
[45:48] God's face that all these things that
[45:50] God has done for us and yet we all uh
[45:53] maybe he'd come down into the garden and
[45:55] the cool of even of the evening and find
[45:57] it empty and nobody's there waiting on
[46:00] him nobody's there is that how we treat
[46:04] God but now the journey of the believer
[46:07] starts with the blood it starts there
[46:11] and the journey of the believer back
[46:13] then was so the beginning of their
[46:16] Journey was so important that God took
[46:18] the calendar and rewrote it he said the
[46:21] month of ab will start your calendar he
[46:23] he just he started everything from based
[46:26] on the Journey of the believer there and
[46:29] I I I I I really debated whether to
[46:33] share this with
[46:35] you but um this is something that's
[46:38] really personal to me and you know when
[46:41] people share dreams and things it um you
[46:45] know people begin to get all kinds of
[46:47] ideas but now I believe that these
[46:49] dreams I I had right after I received
[46:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe
[46:53] God gave me three dreams that showed me
[46:55] my journey
[46:56] and uh I believe they're very simple
[46:58] they're so simple that they really don't
[47:00] even need an interpretation the first
[47:02] dream was I was asleep and Jesus walked
[47:05] in the room and said get up it's time to
[47:07] go and that you know that's really the
[47:10] first part of the Journey of the
[47:12] Israelites was they got under the shed
[47:15] blood and it was time to go they came
[47:18] out of the shed blood the next day they
[47:21] with you know typifying uh they were
[47:23] still under the shed blood they were
[47:25] still under the covering because the
[47:27] sacrifice was continually offered and
[47:30] and so forth but they they came out and
[47:31] they began their journey and they went
[47:35] you know through all the the three
[47:37] stages of justification sanctification
[47:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now
[47:42] look at look at your journey and I
[47:44] remember years ago brother way preached
[47:46] this sermon three pools of your journey
[47:48] which I I is still I I heard a brother
[47:52] years ago say you know when you preach
[47:55] don't don't don't worry about what you
[47:56] say because people won't remember it but
[47:58] I remember that
[48:01] sermon and
[48:04] uh but now the second dream that I had
[48:08] was that I was putting on white garments
[48:11] now I believe the bride makes herself
[48:14] ready she has to make herself ready by
[48:17] taking on reading the words spending
[48:20] time with God every day now now these
[48:22] dreams are not not big complicated
[48:25] things I I believe they're very
[48:27] straightforward and it parallels every
[48:29] believer every one of us in here every
[48:32] every one of us our our Liv our our
[48:34] journey just like the Israelites and
[48:37] that's the only reason I'm telling that
[48:39] because I believe it it was a great help
[48:41] to me to just kind of compare that with
[48:44] these three measures of meal and and the
[48:47] three pools of your journey and what the
[48:49] Israelites went through and now now the
[48:51] last dream was really special to me and
[48:54] I I I'm not even going to tell you all
[48:56] of it because it was that special but I
[48:58] was all alone and now in these other
[49:01] dreams I was there was other people in
[49:04] the dream but now in this dream I was
[49:07] alone and I was walking toward a white
[49:10] tree and someone clothed in white
[49:12] garments was walking toward me and
[49:14] something happened that is well it's
[49:18] what we've all been waiting for and and
[49:21] I believe that those dreams kind of
[49:23] parallel the life of a Christian in this
[49:26] day that we're Justified we're
[49:29] Sanctified we're filled with the Holy
[49:30] Ghost but then you know God takes us on
[49:33] up even to a higher form of that that we
[49:36] first we first hear the call just like
[49:39] in my dream Jesus walked in and said get
[49:42] up it's time to go and I got up and went
[49:46] and then then the next stage of your
[49:48] life is that you began to feed upon the
[49:51] word and he cleanses you now remember
[49:53] just before the children of Israel
[49:55] walked over the r River Jordan God said
[49:58] sanctify yourselves for I will do
[50:00] wonders they had to be clean they had to
[50:03] be and what makes us clean what makes us
[50:06] just what justifies us is his word I
[50:10] heard the word and I believed it I was
[50:13] just what what sanctifies US what uh
[50:17] what are all these three pools is the
[50:20] opening of God's word to us it's the
[50:22] word that washes us we're Washed by the
[50:24] Water of the word we're Sanctified by
[50:27] his word by believing it by by accepting
[50:30] it we're cleansed that makes us the word
[50:33] makes us live a holy life that's why in
[50:37] Pilgrim's Progress uh he told the story
[50:39] of how the Christian was just beat on by
[50:42] when he started his journey he was beat
[50:43] on by Moses which typifies the law and I
[50:47] it seems like many many beat on one
[50:51] another trying to get us to to live a
[50:54] life live life live a life but if you'll
[50:58] accept the word and receive it inside of
[51:00] you and let it come let it grow like
[51:03] this L until God can see his reflection
[51:07] back in himself in you then then that is
[51:11] what makes you live a life it's not
[51:14] because and I I have so many
[51:17] conversations with my M wife about this
[51:19] just in the car grieving about how
[51:22] people are so legalistic today trying to
[51:25] work up something that's not real that's
[51:28] not genuine trying to work up something
[51:31] based on a rule book and that's what the
[51:33] same thing that the Israelites saw when
[51:35] Moses came down with a revelation of the
[51:38] attributes of God that will be made
[51:40] manifest in their life if they would
[51:41] believe it and he came down with those
[51:44] attributes in t in two tablets of clay
[51:47] and they took it instead of the way that
[51:49] it was intended for them they took it as
[51:52] laws that they had to something they had
[51:54] to do something they had to to meet on
[51:57] on their own natural
[51:59] ability but God and today today he's
[52:03] making those attributes those uh make
[52:06] manifest in us that we believe that we
[52:09] know there's one God not just by uh uh
[52:13] by theology or by uh by teaching but
[52:16] because we've had a personal experience
[52:19] with that one God and not just because I
[52:21] can explain it but because I know down
[52:23] in the depths of my soul that there's
[52:25] one God and I I can I can relate with my
[52:29] experience the same things that Jesus
[52:32] went through how he prayed to the father
[52:33] in The Garden of Gethsemane and I can
[52:36] see I can see how that there's one God I
[52:38] know it's not just a table of stone
[52:40] anymore but it's a living reality I I
[52:45] know that he's my father the Bible says
[52:47] call no man father because um I I can't
[52:50] give this to you but only God can reveal
[52:53] it to you I can tell you about it but
[52:55] only God can give you a revelation
[52:57] there's only only God as your
[53:00] father so they started their
[53:03] journey and they began to go through
[53:06] labor pains through a
[53:11] journey that came in the Old Testament
[53:14] came by the death of a lamb right that's
[53:17] right exactly and now you know Moses he
[53:20] had to tell them about the lamb he had
[53:23] to tell them that you need to Pro
[53:25] kill a lamb and put it over the little
[53:29] of your door excuse me one more
[53:36] time I'm sorry but it'll go better if
[53:38] I'm not
[53:43] thirsty now Moses Moses identified the
[53:46] lamb and told him what to put over the
[53:49] door over the
[53:51] doorpost how would they know what to do
[53:53] right unless they had a man
[53:55] that God sent to come and explain to
[53:59] them what to
[54:01] do now a few thousand years
[54:05] later all the Earth was looking for the
[54:09] Messiah to come y for him to come
[54:12] walking right and come upon the scene
[54:16] and redeem us from our sins the whole
[54:18] earth was was looking for that but how
[54:21] would anybody know who that was how
[54:24] would they know until one day he came on
[54:27] the shores of of uh the Jordan
[54:30] River and there a man that God had sent
[54:34] was there to identify that lamb and he
[54:37] pointed to him and said this is the one
[54:39] that you should be following this is the
[54:41] one that you've been looking for now in
[54:44] this day how would we know how would we
[54:48] know how would
[54:51] we understand how would we we we were
[54:54] trapped wrapped inside of denominational
[54:57] theology inside of our own ideas and our
[55:00] own conceptions how would we know the
[55:03] second coming what it would look like
[55:05] what the Rapture was what the what the
[55:08] shout of the voice of the Trump was how
[55:10] would we know all of these things except
[55:14] someone would come and introduce them
[55:16] right and that's what Elijah was today
[55:18] to us to introduce to to introduce to
[55:21] lamb as we came out in the Third Exodus
[55:24] because there was the first Exodus back
[55:26] there as they came out from Egypt a
[55:29] second Exodus as they came out with John
[55:32] and came out from their from that Old
[55:34] Testament from the old from the the old
[55:36] way to the new a new testament a new
[55:39] life and now today God is leading us
[55:42] into a new testament a a new leading us
[55:47] out of denomination into into a life of
[55:51] where the word is being open the word is
[55:53] being made plain to us
[55:55] right
[55:59] now so in Matthew
[56:02] 13:33 the word is being open to us the
[56:05] word is being open in three
[56:08] stages until the the the word completely
[56:12] consumes completely consumes the
[56:15] worshipper now it's completely consuming
[56:18] the church as well and when the church
[56:21] is completely consumed and United
[56:24] together United together around the word
[56:27] by the word United together under the
[56:30] shed blood then we'll go in the Rapture
[56:46] right Matthew
[56:48] 13:33 is God revealed in the flesh of
[56:51] his
[56:52] people now in Steph's sermon in the book
[56:57] of Acts he he talked about he kind of he
[57:00] was leading up as he as he talked about
[57:02] his defense of the faith he was he was
[57:05] giving account of the reason of the hope
[57:07] that lies within him and he was telling
[57:10] about what had happened to him and he
[57:13] talked about how Solomon built a house
[57:16] and you know it was in David David had
[57:19] that great desire to to build a place
[57:21] where God could come and dwell and as
[57:24] they journeyed through the Old Testament
[57:25] they made that that Tabernacle of badger
[57:29] skins and and God was hidden veiled
[57:31] behind those Badger skins you know when
[57:34] he went beyond Behind the into the ark
[57:38] and he was veiled back in that behind
[57:41] within the Ark of the
[57:43] Covenant he wasn't that pillar fire
[57:46] wasn't seen again until one day it
[57:48] Walked In the Flesh veiled in Badger
[57:51] skins veiled beyond the Flesh of a man
[57:54] Christ Jesus Jesus and
[57:56] then then the next time we see it is
[58:00] veiled behind the Flesh of the people
[58:03] that were there in the upper room of
[58:04] that Pillar of Fire the little licks
[58:06] over over each one of them as they they
[58:09] went forth because God the his great
[58:12] plan and purpose was not just to Veil
[58:15] himself inside of a building but to Veil
[58:18] himself behind the Flesh of his people
[58:21] and that was his great purpose the the
[58:23] the purpose that
[58:25] that is typified by this three measures
[58:28] of meal because man is not just man is
[58:31] made up of of body and spirit and soul
[58:35] and you got to have three measures to
[58:37] deal with all the different parts you
[58:39] got to have three measures to fill up
[58:42] the man completely fill him up until
[58:44] he's walking and talking in the image of
[58:46] his creator
[58:48] right and what happens when
[58:53] when when when someone says that they're
[58:56] veiled veiled that God is veiled behind
[58:59] their flesh but yet they continue to
[59:02] preach the traditions of man that that
[59:05] speaks of something's off right there
[59:07] you know only 11 of the disciples knew
[59:10] who Jesus really was and one of them had
[59:14] he had a mental conception right and you
[59:16] know I because God was God was hidden in
[59:20] our midst and today he's still hidden
[59:23] hidden behind the flesh of badger skins
[59:26] now I want
[59:28] to I want to read some quotes
[59:34] here just to kind of
[59:37] solidify brothers let's
[59:44] um let's read that first quote Jehovah
[59:53] Gyra
[1:00:00] we're talking about a lonely Christian
[1:00:03] who live who lives maybe a a lonely life
[1:00:07] because you know you really got to find
[1:00:10] out for yourself you got to find out on
[1:00:13] your knees you got to find out with a
[1:00:14] person in relationship you know when I
[1:00:17] when I started ministering there many
[1:00:19] brother I got many many brothers telling
[1:00:22] me different things and giving me
[1:00:23] feedback and uh saying different things
[1:00:26] but there's nothing like experience
[1:00:29] right when you when you do it a little
[1:00:31] bit when you have experience then it it
[1:00:36] it it's so much greater than when
[1:00:38] somebody just tells you something about
[1:00:40] it and you can be told about but you can
[1:00:44] be told about what the inside of the
[1:00:46] holy of holies looks like all the
[1:00:48] different the different Furnitures and
[1:00:50] things but when you really become
[1:00:53] experiencing right I believe when that
[1:00:55] high priest went behind there and he saw
[1:00:57] the furniture for the first time the
[1:01:00] first time he went beyond the veil and
[1:01:01] he saw all the the gold and Laden things
[1:01:04] and the the Furnitures that it just the
[1:01:08] things that he had heard about became
[1:01:11] just so much greater just beyond real it
[1:01:14] was the sparkle on the instruments and
[1:01:17] just the presence the all steer holy of
[1:01:20] holies oh yeah where the presence of God
[1:01:23] dwell there right and you've got to
[1:01:26] experience it now Jehovah Gyra e29 1956
[1:01:31] 129 and we find him then that God told
[1:01:34] him to separate himself from his all of
[1:01:36] his Kindred and to walk among a strange
[1:01:37] people he's talking about Abraham
[1:01:39] speaking a strange language and we went
[1:01:42] through it how God called separation
[1:01:45] when you become a Christian you've got
[1:01:47] to separate yourself from your sinful
[1:01:49] Associates that's exactly right come out
[1:01:51] from among them my people be separate
[1:01:53] sayth the Lord it's a different walk
[1:01:55] it's an individual walk it's a walk
[1:01:58] between you and God alone and just you
[1:02:01] and he just two can travel the road
[1:02:05] that's you and he speaking a strange
[1:02:08] language do you know when brother
[1:02:09] Brandon began to speak when the when the
[1:02:12] pools when the seals were open and as
[1:02:15] things began to unfold he began to speak
[1:02:17] in a strange language he began to say
[1:02:20] say things like first pull second pull
[1:02:24] third
[1:02:25] things that things that are in scripture
[1:02:29] but nobody had ever heard before a new
[1:02:32] language a new language that's drawing
[1:02:35] us and pulling us into a closer
[1:02:37] relationship into unfolding all these
[1:02:40] Hidden Mysteries like like brother Claud
[1:02:42] said why why should we be afraid to talk
[1:02:45] about these Hidden Mysteries because
[1:02:47] these Hidden Mysteries are what will
[1:02:49] take us into a body change into a closer
[1:02:52] walk with him it's say hidden mysteres
[1:02:54] that now it seems like everybody's
[1:02:56] afraid to talk about and the things that
[1:02:58] brother Brandon was sent to uncover and
[1:03:01] now we're forbidden to speak because
[1:03:03] we'll offend somebody or or uh uh well
[1:03:08] I'm speaking
[1:03:11] plain and uh let's go to number
[1:03:16] five the revelation of Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ now remember this Christ in the
[1:03:23] true church
[1:03:25] right is a continuation of the book of
[1:03:28] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:03:31] how that the Antichrist spirit will come
[1:03:33] into the church and defile it that's
[1:03:35] making it lukewarm formal and
[1:03:37] Powerless now now this is reason I'm
[1:03:40] reading this is because really look what
[1:03:44] look what the devil's doing is he he
[1:03:45] throws in little things to get you off
[1:03:47] and and distracted and little little
[1:03:49] things in your own mind well I believe
[1:03:51] it'll be all right if this I believe
[1:03:53] it'll be okay but if you stay with the
[1:03:55] real word then look what you get look
[1:03:58] what the promise is as we keep reading
[1:04:01] now it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:04:04] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:04:05] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:04:07] down to the time he has cast into the
[1:04:09] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[1:04:11] stand it he knows that if the people get
[1:04:13] the true revelation of the true church
[1:04:17] and what she is what she stands for and
[1:04:19] that she can do the Greater
[1:04:21] Works does everybody believe am that the
[1:04:24] church can do the Greater
[1:04:27] Works that she can do the Greater
[1:04:30] Works she will be an invincible
[1:04:34] Army if you just give Place give give
[1:04:38] room to God meet him in the garden right
[1:04:43] when he shows up you be there and this
[1:04:46] is what you get you be an invincible
[1:04:49] Army amen if what if they get a true re
[1:04:53] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:04:55] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:04:57] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:04:59] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:05:01] powerless before her now I know this is
[1:05:04] a very familiar quote to everybody we've
[1:05:06] all read this but I I wonder you know
[1:05:09] many times we read quotes over and over
[1:05:12] and over and then one day it'll just
[1:05:14] something Sparks and then you go try to
[1:05:17] share it with somebody and there yeah I
[1:05:20] yeah I already got that brother but
[1:05:24] maybe they didn't maybe they have just
[1:05:26] read it over and over and over but one
[1:05:29] day it will spark it'll catch and it
[1:05:32] becomes not just a quote on the page not
[1:05:35] just a commandment on two tablets of
[1:05:36] stone but an attribute of God May
[1:05:39] manifest in your life something that's
[1:05:42] real the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:44] number six let's go to uh
[1:05:46] 162 is I have already said this book
[1:05:50] Revelation is the consummation of the
[1:05:52] Scriptures it is is even placed exactly
[1:05:55] right in the Canon of scripture at the
[1:05:56] end now you can know why it says that
[1:05:58] Anyone who reads or even hears it is
[1:06:01] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[1:06:05] will give you authority over the
[1:06:07] devil I believe that we're all seeking
[1:06:10] to to grow closer to God to be more like
[1:06:14] him and this is how we do it exactly by
[1:06:17] getting getting a revelation like you
[1:06:20] can't just get a revelation but you can
[1:06:22] make yourself available to God Amen you
[1:06:25] can study and read and pray and meet him
[1:06:29] in the garden it is a revelation of God
[1:06:31] that will give you authority over the
[1:06:33] devil and you can see why they who would
[1:06:35] add or take from it would be cursed it
[1:06:38] would have to be so for who can add or
[1:06:41] take away from the perfect revelation of
[1:06:43] God and overcome the enemy it is that
[1:06:46] simple why why is that so because if you
[1:06:49] add something then you don't have a
[1:06:52] foundation that is so rooted that you
[1:06:54] can't find the bottom of it there's
[1:06:56] somebody can come in with an idea about
[1:06:58] healing that just just destroys the
[1:07:01] faith that you rooted in and there's no
[1:07:03] there's there's no ground to it but if
[1:07:06] you stand upon God's word then you can
[1:07:08] stand with faith and say well I didn't
[1:07:10] say it God said all things are possible
[1:07:13] them that believe it's not my words it's
[1:07:15] his words he spoke it and I'm just
[1:07:18] resting upon it even if I don't
[1:07:21] understand it maybe let me just claim it
[1:07:23] and stay with until God quickens it to
[1:07:26] me uh where am I it would have to be so
[1:07:29] for who can add or take away from the
[1:07:31] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[1:07:33] the enemy it is that simple there is
[1:07:35] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[1:07:37] revelation of the word how about that
[1:07:40] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:07:43] power exactly as the revelation of the
[1:07:46] word let's go to the sisan church
[1:07:52] age number seven
[1:07:54] now I am sure that you have noticed that
[1:07:56] those whose names were in The Book of
[1:07:58] Life were part of the religious order of
[1:08:00] that day that centered around the true
[1:08:02] God and worship worship of him though
[1:08:05] they did not worship according to truth
[1:08:06] word like Judas they didn't go all the
[1:08:09] way right see how Judas was chosen of
[1:08:12] God he was instructed in truth he shared
[1:08:14] knowledge of the Mysteries he had a
[1:08:17] Ministry of power granted unto him now
[1:08:20] see that's my what a dangerous place to
[1:08:23] sit in a his church and share knowledge
[1:08:25] of the Mysteries but not actually take
[1:08:28] take part of the of fellowship with God
[1:08:32] now think about so
[1:08:35] many my you come to come to church here
[1:08:37] and you're going to hear about the
[1:08:39] Mysteries you're going to hear about
[1:08:40] these secret things but have you really
[1:08:44] have you partaken have are you in
[1:08:46] fellowship with God or just just hearing
[1:08:48] about the Mysteries just uh that was a
[1:08:51] dangerous place that Judas was he heard
[1:08:54] All The Parables explained when the
[1:08:56] disciples said well explain to me what
[1:08:58] this Parable means and Jesus would take
[1:09:00] the time to sit down with them and Judas
[1:09:02] was right there among them and he was he
[1:09:05] was sharing knowledge of the Mysteries
[1:09:08] he had a Ministry of power granted unto
[1:09:10] him and he healed the sick and cast out
[1:09:12] devils in Jesus name but when The
[1:09:14] Showdown came he sold out for gold and
[1:09:16] political power he did not go up to
[1:09:18] Pentecost to receive the spirit of God
[1:09:20] he was devoid of the spirit make no
[1:09:23] mistake about a person that is truly
[1:09:25] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:09:27] of Christ receiving the fullness of the
[1:09:30] spirit will be in the word all the
[1:09:36] way that is the evidence of being
[1:09:39] baptized with the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right
[1:09:44] there and when they fail to go on in
[1:09:45] that word their names are taken off the
[1:09:48] Book of Life a fervent walk somebody
[1:09:51] that's just craving the word somebody
[1:09:53] that's
[1:09:54] uh the books are not sitting on their
[1:09:56] shelf Gathering dust but they're
[1:10:00] kneading down on their knees going
[1:10:02] through turning every page searching for
[1:10:06] hidden mysteries for that bread that
[1:10:08] came down from God out of Heaven the
[1:10:10] uniting time in PM number eight God is
[1:10:13] uniting his bride she is coming together
[1:10:16] from the East and the west and the North
[1:10:18] and South there is a uniting time and
[1:10:20] that's on right now now what United the
[1:10:23] early Believers at
[1:10:25] Pentecost what United them was the word
[1:10:29] that they heard being quickened in a
[1:10:32] personal relationship the power of God
[1:10:35] in their life right and that's the same
[1:10:37] thing that will unite us today that's
[1:10:40] unite us together so that we can take a
[1:10:42] body change she's coming together from
[1:10:44] the East and the west and the North and
[1:10:46] the South there is a uniting time and
[1:10:48] that's on right now what is she uniting
[1:10:50] for the Rapture amen God's getting her
[1:10:53] ready yes sir uniting what is she
[1:10:56] uniting with with the

[1:11:01] skip down tonight prag 92 and the church
[1:11:03] and the bride and the word is becoming
[1:11:04] so one until the very word itself is
[1:11:08] working out the work of the brid
[1:11:10] Grom amen you see it a
[1:11:13] uniting not no more or join the church
[1:11:16] not no not more of this but flee from
[1:11:18] everything and tied to Jesus Christ see
[1:11:21] it's the uniting time God uniting his
[1:11:23] bride together bringing it back just
[1:11:25] exactly uniting the words of his promise
[1:11:29] the saints that are asleep in the dust
[1:11:30] of the earth will wakeen and then we
[1:11:32] will Unite with them the living ones
[1:11:34] with the ones that's been dead will
[1:11:35] unite before we even even get up there
[1:11:38] because the bride will be complete when
[1:11:41] she get there the ones that's living
[1:11:43] that's uniting them themselves with the
[1:11:44] word and those that are gone already did
[1:11:46] that and it all comes together make one
[1:11:48] great Union of the uniting before going
[1:11:50] up there and I I'll be finishing in just
[1:11:53] a second
[1:11:55] just be patient for just a just a few
[1:11:57] more minutes amen number nine the
[1:11:59] uniting time and sign
[1:12:02] 1963 uh we see the Nations uniting we
[1:12:05] see the world uniting we see the
[1:12:07] churches uniting we see the bride
[1:12:09] uniting uniting with the word why the
[1:12:12] word is God and as the word as the
[1:12:14] bridegroom being the word and the bride
[1:12:16] being the hearer of the word they come
[1:12:18] together in Union they unite like a
[1:12:20] wedding see they're getting ready for a
[1:12:23] wedding and they they become one the
[1:12:24] word becomes you you become the word
[1:12:27] Jesus said at that day you know what all
[1:12:29] the father is I am and all I am you are
[1:12:32] and all you are I am and that day you'll
[1:12:34] know that I in the father father and me
[1:12:36] I and you and you and me see at that at
[1:12:38] that day what day this day we find out
[1:12:40] the great hidden mysteries of God being
[1:12:43] revealed oh how I like that and I I'm
[1:12:46] kind of reading this because uh to
[1:12:49] explain maybe the way sometimes things
[1:12:53] are preach maybe uh maybe this will help
[1:12:56] to explain why uh here we value the word
[1:13:01] so much and how why we put so much
[1:13:04] emphasis on Revelation and on the word
[1:13:07] is because of where it this is taking us
[1:13:10] what's what is happening in the life of
[1:13:12] the believer is we're studying and
[1:13:15] reading and waiting on God for
[1:13:16] Revelation so that the that that hidden
[1:13:19] Mystery can blossom out and and produce
[1:13:23] the same thing the same thing that was
[1:13:26] in God's plan back there in the
[1:13:28] beginning this will produce himself will
[1:13:31] produce himself in flesh veiled in flesh
[1:13:35] and number 10 Souls that are in prison
[1:13:37] now three is perfe the ministry come to
[1:13:41] it its Perfection when it reproduced
[1:13:43] Christ again in natural amongst human
[1:13:46] beings as was predicted as it was in the
[1:13:49] days of lot
[1:13:51] right so that are in prison now number
[1:13:55] 11 but it's the word living amen there
[1:13:59] it is if they' only have looked he was
[1:14:02] Messiah he was the Living Word made
[1:14:05] manifest and a man that's got the spirit
[1:14:07] of God in him or a woman lives that word
[1:14:09] lives right out in them that's the
[1:14:11] heartbeat that predestinated for the
[1:14:13] word of the Lord comes to them and they
[1:14:16] are the words of the people written
[1:14:18] Epistles read of all men is that right
[1:14:20] could the third pool be on right written
[1:14:23] Epistles WR read of all men because the
[1:14:27] word of God is made manifest in their
[1:14:30] life and I I'm just finishing up here so
[1:14:33] The Magicians can go ahead and come but
[1:14:35] God is uniting us around his word by his
[1:14:38] word uniting us together so that we are
[1:14:42] in His image and we can take a body
[1:14:44] change and I just want to as the
[1:14:46] musicians come I want to read Psalm 86
[1:14:50] 1-11 a prayer of David bow down thine
[1:14:54] ear oh Lord hear me for I am poor and

[1:15:15] is and mercy unto all them that call
[1:15:17] upon thee give ear oh Lord unto my
[1:15:20] prayer and attend to the voice of my
[1:15:21] supplications and the day of my trouble
[1:15:24] I will call upon thee for thou will

[1:15:43] God Alone amen teach me thy way oh Lord
[1:15:47] I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart
[1:15:51] To Fear Thy Name Glory unite my heart
[1:15:54] that's the that's the scripture that
[1:15:56] brother random read when he preached the
[1:15:58] uniting
[1:15:59] time and I I I wonder as we just close
[1:16:03] if if you would just stand to your feet
[1:16:05] and
[1:16:07] I just we've heard I preached a little
[1:16:11] message about what's uniting Us and how
[1:16:13] the the the Le and the three measures of
[1:16:15] meal is making us grow in into the
[1:16:19] stature of God's into the into his
[1:16:22] stature and maybe if if we just lift up
[1:16:25] our hands if if you want to if you want
[1:16:28] to grow more be more like God and and uh
[1:16:33] and and I lift up my hand too I I just
[1:16:36] want to pray for everyone here real
[1:16:38] quick and you pray and you heart because
[1:16:40] it's a personal walk a personal prayer a
[1:16:43] personal life a personal experience and
[1:16:46] that's what I believe let's bow our
[1:16:47] heads just before we close Lord God lord
[1:16:51] Jesus I I didn't really know know how
[1:16:53] this is going to go but I thank you Lord
[1:16:56] God for your grace Lord Jesus Lord we
[1:16:58] thank you for your word Lord God I
[1:17:00] remember Lord that pilot came to Jesus
[1:17:02] and said what is truth and Lord you've
[1:17:05] shown us what truth is that what the
[1:17:08] world is searching for and has no idea
[1:17:11] about Lord but you've shown us these
[1:17:13] Hidden Mysteries the hidden truth that's
[1:17:15] been hidden from all down through these
[1:17:17] ages now Lord it's quickening us Lord to
[1:17:20] be more like you and Lord you've seen
[1:17:23] every every hand raised Lord that has a
[1:17:25] desire to be more like you and I pray oh
[1:17:28] God that you'll just prick at the on the
[1:17:30] hearts of the ones that maybe are
[1:17:32] lagging a little bit behind Lord like
[1:17:34] that Vision that brother Ram saw where
[1:17:36] he screamed out get back and step Lord
[1:17:39] that we'll keep in line with your word
[1:17:41] and stay perfectly in step with everyone
[1:17:43] every JW every T that we'll constantly
[1:17:47] be checking up every hour scouring the
[1:17:50] word searching and looking Lord for
[1:17:52] anything that might indicate a problem
[1:17:54] in our lives Lord God I pray that you
[1:17:57] will booler US Lord and help us to be

[1:18:21] make sure that every garment every thing
[1:18:23] was perfectly in line that we'll do the
[1:18:25] same Lord with our lives because you
[1:18:28] said Lord before they crossed the river
[1:18:30] Jordan to sanctify yourselves and Lord
[1:18:33] You're about to do a great wonder I
[1:18:35] believe Lord that the signs are
[1:18:36] testifying that something great is in
[1:18:39] the midst is in the works that you're
[1:18:41] preparing your bride for a transition a
[1:18:46] you're preparing us for a Rapture for
[1:18:48] something that the world has never seen
[1:18:50] Lord and I pray God that you remember
[1:18:52] everything hand raised Lord Jesus Lord
[1:18:55] that you'll touch every heart tonight
[1:18:56] Lord Jesus and Lord maybe if maybe this
[1:19:00] was maybe Lord if if it didn't sink in
[1:19:03] night Lord that maybe when they get home
[1:19:06] by their bed and lay put their knees to
[1:19:09] the floor Lord God that you'll begin a
[1:19:11] work Lord Jesus to cause them to become
[1:19:14] more consecrated more fervent for you
[1:19:16] Lord Jesus that as every hour Ticks by

[1:24:39] to teach us the
[1:24:40] word he gave the prophet to bring itto
[1:24:44] us now all he's doing is waiting on the
[1:24:48] bride waiting on the
[1:24:51] bride
[1:24:53] just realize who she
[1:24:56] is what we're do
[1:24:59] here we're here to strip Satan of the
[1:25:02] power that he thinks he has upon these
[1:25:08] bodies we're here proving
[1:25:13] wrong he
[1:25:16] claims we belong to
[1:25:20] him God say we belong to

[1:25:27] true don't
[1:25:31] you
[1:25:33] savior live and rain
[1:25:46] forever we're in the end of all things
[1:25:48] is coming down and closing out like our
[1:25:51] brother was mentioning a lot of you
[1:25:52] you've hooked on now if you're not then
[1:25:55] I'd advise you to click on the internet
[1:25:58] and kind of see what they're talking
[1:26:00] about that's right you know we don't
[1:26:03] worry about that too
[1:26:04] much but when you see the pope speaking
[1:26:10] to the Pentecostal
[1:26:12] people and telling
[1:26:15] them that we're
[1:26:17] one and the the Protestants there's no
[1:26:21] more
[1:26:23] protesting he says it the man said it
[1:26:26] ended in 1999 or 98 what it was when the
[1:26:30] Lutheran I remember when they went
[1:26:32] through all of
[1:26:34] that see it's
[1:26:37] there he says we're all one that's right
[1:26:42] well let them go ahead and say what they
[1:26:44] want to you know I do believe we're all
[1:26:46] one but not one like he's making it
[1:26:51] we're one in Christ
[1:26:53] but it's very very
[1:26:55] shrewd if you listen to the man talking
[1:26:59] very
[1:27:00] shrewd you can see they're gaining very
[1:27:02] much ground as a
[1:27:06] Unity but you see the bride is gaining
[1:27:08] ground also that's right so just be
[1:27:13] ready amen amen anybody anything for we
[1:27:16] go remember the Bible study Saturday
[1:27:19] pray one for another remember the
[1:27:20] fellowship meeting will be the third
[1:27:22] Saturday in March brother Vernon manahan

[1:28:02] time to think it over I love it that way
[1:28:06] let him get on the spot I told Brother
[1:28:08] collie one time I said one of these days
[1:28:10] I'm going to get you in the biggest

[1:28:13] said I'm going to walk off and leave
[1:28:15] you I said I want to see how you'll
[1:28:18] handle it so that's that's pretty good
