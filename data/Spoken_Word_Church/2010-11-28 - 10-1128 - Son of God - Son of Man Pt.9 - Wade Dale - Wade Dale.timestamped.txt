[0:00] okay
[0:02] good to be back
[0:04] good to meet you
[0:05] today
[0:07] i slept good last night because all my
[0:09] babies were there we were all in the
[0:11] same state last night state of shock
[0:21] man did have a thing to pray about so
[0:22] she just went on to sleep
[0:29] all right
[0:31] revelations 3
[0:33] 14. now what we're doing is
[0:37] we're going through this son of god the
[0:39] son of man now we i think we kind of got
[0:42] the gift of who the son of god is the
[0:44] son of god the spirit god
[0:46] god before the foundation of the world
[0:47] jehovah
[0:49] the word the logos the speech the
[0:51] theophany all those words
[0:53] um
[0:55] is bottled up in this one person
[0:58] the son of god
[1:00] now to become a son of man
[1:04] remember he had to first be the son of
[1:06] god
[1:07] and then that son of god could
[1:11] take his
[1:13] word
[1:14] in the old testament
[1:17] and he could make it manifest in the new
[1:19] testament in the body of flesh
[1:21] he didn't do it in the old testament the
[1:22] old testament he would use man
[1:25] anoint come off the man anoint he'd even
[1:27] anoint balaam
[1:29] you know a hireling prophet a false
[1:32] prophet he would even anoint balaam
[1:34] but see if balaam ever got born again or
[1:36] if god was able to get down into the
[1:38] soul of that man
[1:40] he wouldn't have done what he did by um
[1:44] taking israel to whoredom
[1:46] you know
[1:47] god told him to don't mix your race and
[1:50] satan told balaam said hey
[1:53] you can't go against god
[1:56] but let me tell you a different way
[1:57] that's the same way did eve right you
[1:59] know
[2:01] adam and eve were going to multiply and
[2:02] replenish the earth there was no doubt
[2:04] they were going to
[2:06] but they were supposed to do it the way
[2:08] god wanted them to do it not the way
[2:09] that they did it
[2:11] afterwards so
[2:13] that's the same way with balaam balaam
[2:15] was a prophet of god he knew what he was
[2:18] doing he knew how to do the sacrifices
[2:20] he knew how to talk directly with god
[2:22] and god talked directly to him
[2:24] okay
[2:25] those kind of prophets are they born
[2:27] prophets like
[2:29] absolutely they got a gift just like
[2:31] they got a gift just like brother brown
[2:33] yeah
[2:34] now i said just like the reason i say
[2:36] just like
[2:37] is like jeremiah isaiah and all those
[2:40] they all have a gift
[2:42] see because you can be a gift brother
[2:44] brandon i was reading the other day i
[2:46] think was on the plane coming back
[2:48] things that are to be
[2:51] they were talking about satan casting
[2:53] out satan and then this one guy told
[2:55] brother branham said when i
[2:57] what about this witch that we got that
[2:59] lives in chicago and she goes and
[3:02] you know does all these she's a diviner
[3:04] uh she does devination
[3:07] he said well now that's of satan brother
[3:08] brown said now that's satan he said but
[3:10] now the healing that the people get
[3:12] that's of god right
[3:14] so she had the gift
[3:16] but see she was only 60 right
[3:19] like jeannie dickinson they can enter
[3:20] into a law god's got a law well see god
[3:23] had a law of reproduction but the law of
[3:25] reproduction was that he was supposed to
[3:26] be spoken word so what did satan do he
[3:28] just took that and perverted it because
[3:30] god had already showed the animals
[3:32] reproducing sexually okay but no problem
[3:36] with the male and the female in the
[3:37] animal kingdom because there was no
[3:39] conscience
[3:40] it was just she came into heat every so
[3:41] often and you had babies and that's all
[3:43] it was for read marriage and divorce and
[3:45] it'll explain it very well
[3:47] but
[3:49] we come down to somebody like balaam
[3:51] balaam could hear from god
[3:54] well he did
[3:55] because remember even balaam told
[3:57] bailout said hey
[3:59] i can only say what god tells me to say
[4:03] and he did
[4:05] he said curse israel balaam went to god
[4:07] and did the altar did the sacrifices and
[4:09] he approached god just like just like
[4:11] moses did
[4:14] but in balaam's heart the end of bala
[4:17] was the problem
[4:20] because balaam
[4:21] turned toward money women and popularity
[4:25] which was the money part brother around
[4:26] city with a higher length
[4:28] so
[4:29] satan just entered into balaam because
[4:31] balaam was a he wasn't a born-again
[4:33] believer
[4:34] but he was a prophet
[4:36] but satan entered into that man and gave
[4:38] him an idea i said hey you can't curse
[4:40] israel
[4:42] like this man wants you to curse him
[4:43] right
[4:44] and you can't curse israel because god
[4:46] won't let you curse israel the way you
[4:48] are in in your in the way you you
[4:51] approach god
[4:52] but now watch what satan does say just
[4:54] like he did eve he said oh you won't
[4:55] surely die he told balaam he said off he
[4:58] said
[4:59] i got a way to do it
[5:02] let's take these more bite women
[5:04] let's take these
[5:06] israeli men and let's mingle them
[5:08] together well as soon as they did that
[5:09] guess what
[5:10] god said that's it i'm cutting you off
[5:12] right there
[5:14] so he got his way yeah satan did
[5:18] but it was in a
[5:20] perverse way and that's the same way
[5:22] with
[5:23] with with diviners and people uh fortune
[5:26] tellers they can be right some of them
[5:28] and have a gift
[5:29] because remember gifts and callings are
[5:31] without repentance there's your
[5:32] scripture right there that answer your
[5:33] question right there gifts and calls it
[5:35] without repentance you'd be a rank
[5:36] center and have a gift you have a gift
[5:39] of healing because you're not the one
[5:40] that does the healing right right how
[5:42] could the beatles the beatles had a
[5:44] healing campaign
[5:46] they were a
[5:47] devil himself
[5:49] brother
[5:50] he must have had an open channel with
[5:52] god because when god told him don't go
[5:54] with him sure he did and then he said
[5:56] later on he said let me go back and ask
[5:58] god again see if you'll let me go sure
[6:00] absolutely right that's what i said he
[6:02] see god god in the old testament said
[6:05] okay you do you make seven altars with
[6:08] seven realms
[6:10] which brother brown said that was the
[6:11] type of jesus christ he said balaam knew
[6:13] the approach to god
[6:15] he knew to do those seven sacrifices and
[6:17] then see god under the blood of bulls
[6:19] and ghosts god had to come down and he
[6:21] had to he didn't have to honor that
[6:23] prophet he wasn't honoring balaam right
[6:26] he was honoring what he said
[6:28] balaam just entered into that same law
[6:32] and could get
[6:33] a an audience with god what about the
[6:35] witch of endor
[6:37] there's another example which of endor
[6:39] was just absolutely uh
[6:42] you know a devil
[6:44] she got samuel out of paradise didn't
[6:46] she
[6:48] it's like your dad was talking about
[6:50] brother right homes don't shoot himself
[6:52] oh sure but the gift was protected the
[6:54] freedom of agency was still honored
[6:56] exactly see brother branham could
[6:59] see god was protecting the gift because
[7:01] he knew that man and that gift was going
[7:03] to become one right
[7:04] all right but see balaam and his gift
[7:06] never became one as far as that because
[7:08] there was no blood of jesus christ to
[7:10] clean balaam up
[7:12] balaam was just
[7:13] it was just
[7:14] he can't say he was a sinner but
[7:16] or an unbeliever but he was
[7:19] a center and an unbeliever you know he
[7:20] just wanted according to the old
[7:22] testament
[7:23] what he done was is he got uh
[7:26] he got him to you know remember god said
[7:28] don't marry out of your ranks marry the
[7:30] you know marion israelite married you
[7:31] know in your lineage
[7:33] and
[7:35] balaam took them off to one side
[7:37] and
[7:39] they couldn't ever get back
[7:41] they went in to hoard them and god told
[7:43] them in ezekiel and jeremiah he told him
[7:45] you've committed order against me you've
[7:47] done what i told you not to do
[7:49] so
[7:51] that's why i've said many times and and
[7:53] i don't back down one bit before this
[7:55] thing's over with you're going to see
[7:56] somebody raise up with a gift
[7:59] that's going to be so close
[8:02] and it's going to drag a lot of message
[8:03] people
[8:04] they don't care people let me tell you
[8:06] something people will not this is on the
[8:07] internet
[8:08] people will not care what a man preaches
[8:11] as long as he's got a gift that's right
[8:12] right they will not care if it we're not
[8:14] saying that's balaam
[8:16] ain't that balaam that's balaam
[8:18] he can be black and son inside and have
[8:21] a gift and go around the world
[8:23] and and preach this message
[8:26] and have a gift of divine healing now
[8:28] not the gift but a gift
[8:30] because there's gifts of healing in the
[8:32] bible gifts and callings are without
[8:33] repentance those people will
[8:36] they'll drag them something's got to
[8:38] happen that's going to drag all these
[8:39] people that are that want to look for
[8:41] signs and wonders only
[8:43] i said only
[8:44] if you only look for signs and wonders
[8:46] to know that this message is true you're
[8:48] going to be
[8:49] swept away
[8:51] right brother i believe that brother i
[8:53] really do because in matthew 25 it says
[8:57] false christ
[9:00] false anointed ones
[9:04] they're false
[9:05] the gift they have is true but remember
[9:08] the people in the in the beatles
[9:10] campaign the people that got healed they
[9:12] weren't dependent on the beatles to heal
[9:14] them
[9:15] they inherited a law of faith i believe
[9:17] that those people are have some way to
[9:19] intercede that's what brother brown said
[9:21] about the pope
[9:22] some people get their healing through
[9:24] the pope because they believe he's an
[9:25] intercessor to you know he's a direct
[9:27] contact to god
[9:29] and let me go a little bit closer
[9:31] why do y'all call brother dale
[9:33] to pray for you all right
[9:36] right mm-hmm why don't you call danny
[9:38] sometimes right
[9:41] once you call brother ray sometime
[9:44] no joe brother donny myself why you call
[9:46] brother dale you want him to intercede
[9:48] for you right because you think he's got
[9:50] direct contact to god and that's not
[9:52] saying any and i believe he does
[9:55] ain't no doubt
[9:56] but what are we believing in
[9:58] we believe in him brother dale's going
[9:59] to give us our healing we better not
[10:02] rise right
[10:03] we better believe that he can cut that
[10:04] he's got a you know he's got a uh
[10:07] lift-to-ear relationship with god
[10:09] but you and i should have a religious
[10:11] relationship to god
[10:13] it's okay knowing somebody else they'll
[10:15] believe myself
[10:24] brother claude were talking about this
[10:26] last weekend or weekend for last
[10:29] we have come to a time and it's all of
[10:31] us it's going to slap us all in the face
[10:33] we've come to a point in time to when we
[10:35] have become a catholic organization
[10:37] because what we do is we don't study we
[10:39] don't pray we don't read our books we
[10:41] don't read our bible we come to church
[10:43] one time a week most of you
[10:46] we on sunday
[10:47] and guess what we do
[10:49] brother dale you do the studying for us
[10:51] you do the praying for us you do the rea
[10:53] what is that all right go to catholic
[10:55] mass that's exactly what you do you go
[10:58] to catholic mass and you do this right
[11:00] here and you say you go talk to god
[11:02] right point to the priest of the pope
[11:04] we've become just a catholic
[11:06] organization i mean
[11:08] sure i mean even born again people
[11:10] but it's that spirit of this ages you do
[11:13] it for me you go do it it's that
[11:15] catholic dogma that come all the way
[11:17] down through time and it's worked its
[11:19] way in the message same thing
[11:21] we sit there like a bump on a log
[11:24] we go to georgia game we scream and
[11:25] shout
[11:35] who can't get to church on time
[11:39] and that's all of us that's me too
[11:40] that's all of us i mean it's just it's
[11:42] we cut it i've always told you on people
[11:44] it's gonna come down to the life you
[11:45] live it ain't gonna come down to how
[11:47] much you know in this bible right or how
[11:48] much you know the message that you can
[11:50] physically know in your head
[11:53] quote
[11:56] if we don't believe that we're this book
[11:58] not a part i mean not not not not a or
[12:01] being able to read it but be a part of
[12:02] that book right that's just what i'm
[12:04] saying wednesday night for those who
[12:06] weren't there wednesday night you need
[12:07] to listen that message even though i did
[12:08] preach it but
[12:11] the author
[12:14] in some way if i
[12:16] wrote my commentary of my life
[12:19] i could give it to brother donnie and
[12:21] brother donnie could read that
[12:23] and he said oh well that's a good story
[12:26] but i wonder what he meant about this i
[12:27] wonder what he meant about that i wonder
[12:29] what happened in between all this
[12:32] and that's the same way with this that's
[12:33] what we're doing now but if you some way
[12:35] you can take my
[12:37] persona my being
[12:39] and transform myself we were talking
[12:41] about transformed by bothering you and
[12:42] the mind if i took and transformed
[12:44] myself
[12:45] into brother donny because that's what
[12:47] god wants to do and the new birth he
[12:48] wants to take his mind to give it to you
[12:52] so
[12:53] i'm the author
[12:55] of the book
[12:57] donnie's reading the book as a second
[12:58] person
[13:00] if you read it as a second person you're
[13:01] the devil
[13:03] talking about the bible
[13:05] you got to read this first person's
[13:06] right but you've got to get into the
[13:08] same brother brother never made these
[13:09] little comments for nothing you know if
[13:11] i was beethoven i'd write a symphony but
[13:13] what was he telling us he said if you've
[13:14] got god in you you understand this book
[13:16] because what have you done you've become
[13:18] god all right
[13:21] you've become the author of the book
[13:23] right right and that's what god wants us
[13:24] to be he wants us to be part of the
[13:26] author of the book he don't want just
[13:27] because
[13:28] millions of people read this bible like
[13:30] a commentary like a history like a well
[13:33] it happened back then well
[13:35] and most denominations are that way most
[13:37] people in the message are that way they
[13:39] read this as a good story book but until
[13:42] we see our name and when we read that
[13:44] scripture we see our name
[13:46] and that we're identified in that
[13:49] then what have we done
[13:51] see if i take what i am and i give it to
[13:53] brother donnie and some way he moves
[13:54] himself out of the way remember that
[13:55] book i read uh the word made flashing
[13:58] india trip you need to read that book
[14:00] that is a powerful book from 1954 that
[14:03] the prophet preached
[14:06] but he said if you never get the mind of
[14:08] god he said then you say to this
[14:10] mountain then you say to this cancer
[14:12] then you say to them you say to that
[14:14] all right but if i can transpose myself
[14:17] into donning donnie can move himself out
[14:19] of the way then when donnie reads my
[14:21] book he's living it just like i lived it
[14:25] and that's what he wants us to do in
[14:26] this word of god he wants us to live it
[14:28] just like he lived
[14:31] and if we don't then we miss him if we
[14:33] read it as a second person second person
[14:35] is always the devil right
[14:38] this is why i appreciate this ministry
[14:40] here i thanked and i thank the lord on
[14:42] the way down because
[14:44] we're told the dangers
[14:46] that we're amazing even as bride we're
[14:49] told we're becoming a catholic
[14:51] organization
[14:54] oh if you told people that they run you
[14:55] out of church that's why i never say it
[14:57] in another church
[14:59] so i'm here on the internet that's their
[15:01] business
[15:02] but that's the way it's become
[15:04] we sat down on sunday and we look up at
[15:06] the preacher and we say
[15:09] we're here
[15:10] fill us up
[15:12] yeah
[15:13] study for me
[15:16] okay that's right
[15:18] but we've got to become this new race
[15:20] that we're talking about you know some
[15:21] of us don't even open our bibles when
[15:23] he's reading the scriptures yeah that's
[15:25] to me that's disrespectful but whatever
[15:28] yeah they we got preachers to get in the
[15:29] pulpit now that don't take their bible
[15:31] that's true they read it they take and
[15:33] run it off on the computer and they read
[15:36] but that's little
[15:37] that's just little things that
[15:40] bother you susan if everybody's like you
[15:42] we'd all be
[15:44] like you
[15:48] and that's not pointing at soothing
[15:50] that's not pointing that suit at that
[15:52] point at all
[15:54] tyler settle down
[16:01] i was thinking something a minute ago
[16:02] and he picked up my thought over there
[16:06] but that's what that's why he come down
[16:07] to here
[16:09] from this great person we can't
[16:11] understand
[16:13] that truly
[16:14] honestly
[16:15] back when they first wrote the bible i
[16:18] would say
[16:20] that a lot of people didn't understand
[16:22] it
[16:23] and the latin vulgate had they brought
[16:26] that latin vulgate and they brought it
[16:28] into the that's why the roman catholics
[16:30] have it in latin it's the pure
[16:32] it's what was written off the scrolls
[16:34] and you know brother brown said god
[16:36] preserved that through the catholic
[16:37] church catholic church put all that
[16:38] together well see it got to a point
[16:40] where the catholic church says well you
[16:42] can't understand this
[16:45] we're the only ones that can interpret
[16:46] it
[16:47] well that's satan because that's two
[16:48] people see but we have a group of people
[16:52] called a bride that was that that a lot
[16:54] of them got in the same
[16:56] realm as the composer
[16:58] and picked these thoughts up
[17:00] and let's read revelation 3 14 to the
[17:02] angel of church of the land to see and
[17:04] write
[17:05] these things said the amen
[17:08] excuse me the faithful and true witness
[17:10] the beginning of the creation of god
[17:13] now see let me explain something about
[17:15] here
[17:17] isaiah was not the beginning of the
[17:19] creation of god
[17:23] adam was not the beginning of the
[17:24] creation of god
[17:29] abraham was not the beginning of the
[17:30] creation of god
[17:33] jeremiah was not the beginning of the
[17:34] creation of god
[17:36] malachi was not the beginning of the
[17:37] creation of god
[17:39] john the baptist was not the beginning
[17:40] of the creation of god
[17:42] yet jesus told the disciples that the
[17:45] least in the kingdom
[17:47] that's what we're going to talk about is
[17:49] greater than john
[17:50] but john was the greatest of all
[17:52] prophets
[17:54] he preached six months didn't have no
[17:56] healing campaign
[17:58] stood in mud for months
[18:02] teaching teaching repentance
[18:05] eating locust and wild honey
[18:09] he went to cracker barrel
[18:13] locust and wild honey exactly what he
[18:15] got
[18:16] but that's where he ate at he ate locust
[18:18] and wild honey
[18:20] listen he didn't have no church
[18:25] the holy ghost quickened him in the womb
[18:27] of his mother
[18:29] he didn't have the baptism of the holy
[18:31] ghost he didn't have the new birth sorry
[18:34] brother branham will confirm that i
[18:35] actually found a quote the other day
[18:36] where he said that john the baptist
[18:38] didn't have any birth
[18:40] but he was quickening his mother's womb
[18:42] by the holy ghost which is an anointing
[18:43] you have an anointing like that we
[18:45] understand that life only comes after
[18:47] the baby's born okay
[18:50] but it was showing you one thing for
[18:52] sure
[18:53] john and jesus had a connection
[18:55] somewhere they were connected together
[18:57] you know even earthly they were
[19:00] cousins you know by the by the sisters i
[19:03] mean by the mom but
[19:04] see that's immaterial because he wasn't
[19:06] right he wasn't the cousin of nobody
[19:09] right
[19:10] but the beginning of the creation of god
[19:12] was in acts 2
[19:15] started
[19:16] actually jesus was the beginning
[19:19] and then there was
[19:20] more to come
[19:22] because jesus was the beginning so if
[19:23] there's a beginning there has to be a
[19:25] continuation so now let's read acts 2.
[19:42] acts 2 verse 1 when the day of pentecost
[19:44] was fully come there were all with one
[19:46] accord in one place and suddenly there
[19:48] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[19:50] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[19:52] where they were city
[19:53] they appeared under them cloven tongues
[19:55] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[19:57] them and they were all filled with the
[19:59] holy ghost
[20:00] now this wasn't an anointing upon these
[20:02] people they were filled
[20:05] their cup was running over
[20:07] and began to speak with other tongues
[20:08] that the spirit gave them
[20:10] utterance all right
[20:13] and
[20:14] they weren't cowards anymore they threw
[20:16] the door open and run downstairs and
[20:18] what did they do peter preached them a
[20:20] sermon
[20:22] verse 14
[20:24] peter standing up with the eleven lifted
[20:26] up his voice and said unto them you men
[20:27] of judea and all you that dwell at
[20:29] jerusalem be this known unto you and
[20:31] hearken to my words and he wasn't a
[20:34] scared coward anymore that's right
[20:38] for these are not drunken it's supposed
[20:40] singing but the third hour of the day
[20:42] but this is that which was spoken by the
[20:44] prophet joel
[20:46] and shall come to pass in the last days
[20:48] saith god i will pour out my spirit upon
[20:50] all flesh
[20:52] your sons and your daughters shall
[20:53] prophesy and your young men shall see
[20:54] visions your old men
[20:56] shall dream dreams the same time
[21:00] let's go to verse 37.
[21:03] now when they heard this who the people
[21:04] outside
[21:06] because 120 had already been filled with
[21:07] the holy ghost all right
[21:10] they were pricked in their heart in
[21:12] other words
[21:13] a message was preached
[21:16] there was a conviction
[21:18] and they said well in other words how
[21:20] can we act like you
[21:21] or how can we do what you're doing how
[21:23] can we how can we get this knowledge
[21:26] because actually peter preached him for
[21:27] all the way from joel all the way till
[21:29] the present time
[21:30] because in verse 36 he said that god has
[21:32] made that same jesus whom you have
[21:34] crucified both lord in christ
[21:36] they were preached in their heart what
[21:38] they were convicted in their soul
[21:40] god called they answered they heard a
[21:42] sermon
[21:44] and they had to hear a sermon now why
[21:46] didn't that happen before the day of
[21:47] pentecost
[21:48] holy ghost hadn't been given
[21:50] seed life only comes through the body so
[21:52] you have to hear a holy ghost preacher
[21:54] receive the holy oak right
[22:00] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[22:01] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[22:03] do
[22:03] and peter said unto them repent
[22:06] and be baptized everyone in the name of
[22:08] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[22:10] and you shall receive the gift of the
[22:12] holy ghost what is the gift eternal life
[22:15] for the promise of them to you and to
[22:17] your children and to all that are far
[22:19] off
[22:20] that's us right even as many the lord
[22:22] our god shall call
[22:24] and with many other words did he testify
[22:26] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[22:28] this untoward
[22:30] generation
[22:32] then they that gladly received his words
[22:34] were baptized in the same day they were
[22:36] added unto them
[22:38] about three 000 souls now here is the
[22:42] key verse 42. we always stop at 41.
[22:47] and they who those 3
[22:49] and 120
[22:51] continued steadfast in the apostles
[22:55] doctrine and
[22:56] fellowship and in breaking of bread and
[22:59] in
[23:00] prayer
[23:02] that's the difference
[23:04] probably there was more than 3 000
[23:06] people listening
[23:08] because see that was the feast of
[23:09] pentecost everybody come in from the on
[23:12] the feast of pentecost everybody came
[23:13] into jerusalem
[23:14] from all over the country
[23:17] so what happened to the other ones
[23:20] they didn't stay steadfast
[23:24] they did not continue in the faith
[23:27] remember i read the quote last
[23:28] wednesday where it said why did god pick
[23:30] abraham because he knew abraham would
[23:32] continue down through the generation he
[23:34] would continue what god had told him
[23:37] in other words he didn't count it not
[23:39] probably he spoke to you know john henry
[23:41] is
[23:42] his neighbor and john henry said hey god
[23:44] i believe you
[23:46] but he knew that he wasn't gonna
[23:48] he knew in his heart that john wasn't
[23:50] going to carry it down through right
[23:52] they didn't go on being right
[23:56] being born again exactly
[23:57] all right
[23:58] so there now we start in the book of
[24:00] acts now that was the beginning of the
[24:01] creation of god is when jesus ascended
[24:04] came back on the day of pentecost he was
[24:06] the first fruits he was the one that
[24:08] that said all power in heaven and earth
[24:10] has been given unto me
[24:12] and then if you'll terry in jerusalem
[24:13] i'm going to give that some of that
[24:14] power to you i said son because you
[24:16] didn't give it all to him he gave some
[24:18] of it to him all right
[24:20] but all is all they had all that they
[24:22] needed
[24:23] but it's like i was telling them and
[24:25] like i've used the example before
[24:26] remember you know you look through your
[24:28] hands here and i see brother and sister
[24:29] kathy but that doesn't negate that all
[24:32] of you are not in this room no you're in
[24:34] this room but i'm going to see but as my
[24:36] vision is
[24:38] pulled back i see there's a room full of
[24:40] people that's what god god's word's
[24:41] always been eternal god word's always
[24:43] been salvation god's word's always been
[24:45] perfect god's word's always been for all
[24:47] generations but luther saw this much of
[24:49] it
[24:50] he looked through glass darkly like paul
[24:52] said same way with paul
[24:54] so here started this great creation or
[24:57] this new creation or new race of people
[25:00] started in the book of ice you said in
[25:01] your race yes god started regenerating
[25:05] he started taking sinners
[25:07] um
[25:08] didn't care what their background was
[25:11] and told them like paul said you're a
[25:12] bunch of you know he told the
[25:14] corinthians he went through that whole
[25:15] thing fornicators assemblers thieves
[25:18] robbers
[25:20] all these things he had a man in his
[25:21] congregation that was living with his
[25:23] mother
[25:25] he had to get rid of all that this was
[25:27] in the church
[25:29] this wasn't out in the ghetto this was
[25:30] in the church
[25:33] so he took care of all that but what did
[25:34] he do when he took care of all that the
[25:36] people didn't say bless god i'm right
[25:37] and leave
[25:38] no they repented
[25:40] they got right and they had a church
[25:44] so this started the new creation new
[25:45] race of people the new race of people is
[25:47] there never was a race of people on the
[25:49] face of the earth that had the new birth
[25:51] in their soul
[25:53] like started on the day of pentecost
[25:56] book of acts
[25:57] nobody had been that's why it was a new
[25:59] creation
[26:00] the beginning of the creation of god
[26:01] that's the way god wanted it to happen
[26:04] when that holy ghost fell on 120 that's
[26:07] exactly what god saw from the beginning
[26:10] he wanted that from the beginning
[26:12] and then here it came to pass
[26:16] but now let's turn to matthew 17
[26:19] because down through the ages
[26:23] this revelation of one god water baptism
[26:27] all those things got eroded like we said
[26:29] the catholic church took the bible and
[26:31] said well
[26:32] we can't understand it you can't either
[26:34] so we'll do the best we can with it
[26:39] and let me tell you something
[26:42] uh if you read things that are to me i
[26:43] believe that's where i was reading
[26:45] brother brown he said i know catholics
[26:48] that are saved
[26:51] now that was back then i don't believe
[26:53] ken now but i believe i was back then
[26:54] there was a time that you could be born
[26:57] again brother brown so you could take an
[26:58] egg and put it under a dog and it
[27:00] hatched but that's what he said but i
[27:02] don't believe they stayed in the roman
[27:03] catholic church i believe he talked
[27:04] about they got converted coming in the
[27:05] message
[27:06] okay
[27:07] so
[27:08] who had her hand up
[27:11] i always said that the catholics that
[27:13] the hierarchy in the catholic church
[27:14] took that
[27:16] word away from the people so they had no
[27:18] way of knowing
[27:19] sure they could tell them what they
[27:20] wanted them today they'd have to be
[27:22] leaving
[27:23] well you had to me you could do the
[27:25] indulgences you can the roman catholic
[27:27] church was in it for the money
[27:30] so they said okay
[27:32] believe on the lord and you'll be see
[27:34] that's what hit luther
[27:37] watch that movie martin luther the the
[27:40] new one it's it was done very well
[27:43] because it was done according to what
[27:45] the prophet said now they probably
[27:46] didn't know that but it was done it was
[27:48] done right according to history and
[27:50] that's where brother brown got history
[27:51] the history of martin luther
[27:54] but martin luther come out with a just
[27:55] show led by faith well martin luther
[27:58] would still lay on the floor
[28:00] prostrate himself on rocks
[28:02] and lay there and just pound his head
[28:04] trying to get those thoughts out of his
[28:06] mind
[28:08] because he had come under such a
[28:09] conviction but he was trying to do
[28:11] penance
[28:13] beat himself on the back you know
[28:15] got on his knees and crawled on you know
[28:17] on the on the rocks
[28:19] he was trying to do penance
[28:21] and even one of the priests told him
[28:23] said luther
[28:25] you're going to go crazy
[28:28] stop it
[28:30] one time i think he said trust in god
[28:31] and then i believe you know that was
[28:33] kind of where
[28:34] that god started dealing with him i
[28:35] believe
[28:36] you say from a catholic priest there was
[28:38] some good catholic praise
[28:40] i mean
[28:41] at least back then they knew what they
[28:42] were talking about maybe some of them
[28:44] did
[28:45] but uh
[28:47] but martin luther was catholic
[28:49] and uh
[28:51] when he wrote those 95 thesis
[28:53] what he was wanting to do was want the
[28:54] catholic church to just quit doing all
[28:56] these indulgences and quit fleecing the
[28:58] people because that's what they do
[28:59] they're going to community if you watch
[29:01] a movie go on a community
[29:03] you've sinned you've done this you've
[29:04] done that you've had a bad thought
[29:07] pay two dollars and we'll
[29:09] sign you a little paper
[29:11] remember the little girl had it you know
[29:12] the had a little girl on her back that
[29:14] was a or something
[29:17] and they said well you know give some
[29:18] money and we'll you know make it better
[29:21] no it was just like a sideshow thing
[29:24] but martin luther finally caught that
[29:26] the just shall live by faith now martin
[29:28] luther had great signs and wonders
[29:30] follow after that
[29:32] so he did come out of the catholic
[29:33] church i mean there was no doubt about
[29:35] that but he was
[29:36] he was still you know sacrament father
[29:38] son holy ghost all those things he was
[29:40] still
[29:41] connected to the church but it was god
[29:43] trying to get the people out
[29:45] it's just like us
[29:46] i mean you didn't come in overnight he
[29:48] didn't come and use that overnight he
[29:50] had a lot of stuff happening still
[29:54] but god as he moved along god had to get
[29:57] that out of it and that's what it you
[29:59] know people say well i'll come in
[30:01] overnight no you did no you had a lot of
[30:04] fun hanging on
[30:05] right yeah
[30:07] yeah we all did even people growing up
[30:09] in the message the same way you got a
[30:12] lot of baggage
[30:13] all right let's read matthew 17 let's
[30:15] let's see how this is going to become to
[30:19] where we have to have the son of man
[30:20] back again just give me a few minutes
[30:23] chapter 17 and after six days
[30:25] in other words after six thousand years
[30:27] something's going to happen
[30:29] a day is a thousand years thousand years
[30:31] a day right
[30:33] in other words in the seventh church age
[30:34] this is what's going to happen
[30:36] jesus takes peter james and john his
[30:38] brother and brings them up into a high
[30:40] mountain apart and was transfigured
[30:42] before them and his face did shine as
[30:44] the sun
[30:44] and his raiment as white as snow
[30:47] now you know brother branham i don't
[30:48] have the quote here but brother branham
[30:50] said he said
[30:51] and behold there appeared unto them
[30:53] moses and elijah there was three of them
[30:55] moses was the law
[30:58] elijah was the prophet
[30:59] right
[31:00] and jesus represented us
[31:04] glorified jesus represented us
[31:07] all right
[31:09] so we were represented there you say
[31:10] well there was moses elijah where were
[31:12] we we were in jesus christ we were
[31:13] standing that we were in him
[31:15] in eternal life
[31:19] if you have eternal life today you were
[31:20] represented there let me put it that way
[31:22] then answered peter and said jesus lord
[31:24] is good for us to be here if that will
[31:26] let us make your three tabernacles one
[31:27] for thee one promoting one for lies
[31:30] when he spoke behold a bright light or a
[31:32] bright cloud overshadowed them and
[31:34] behold the voice out of the cloud which
[31:35] said this is my beloved son
[31:38] in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[31:41] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[31:42] their face and were so afraid and jesus
[31:44] came and touched them and said arise and
[31:46] be not afraid when they lifted up their
[31:48] eyes they saw no man save jesus only
[31:50] all right and as they came down from the
[31:52] mountain jesus charged them tell the
[31:54] vision to no one until the son of man be
[31:56] risen again from the dead
[31:58] now on the rising of the sun brother
[31:59] brown says that that's at the end time
[32:03] because
[32:04] it says tell the vision to no man until
[32:06] the son of man be risen again
[32:10] from the dead again
[32:12] in other words the son of man rose one
[32:14] time easter morning right right
[32:16] he's gonna he's not gonna be killed
[32:18] again they're not gonna put him on a
[32:19] natural cross but they're gonna kill his
[32:21] effect
[32:23] joel same thing with joel joel said
[32:24] he'll pour out a spirit upon all flesh
[32:26] but he did also talk about the palm warm
[32:28] cankle worm caterpillar locust eating
[32:30] the tree down and that's what happened
[32:32] in the church ages
[32:33] and his disciples asked him saying why
[32:35] then say the scribes that elise are
[32:37] elijah
[32:40] verse first come and like claude said
[32:41] they're looking for elijah to come and
[32:43] we went through that series they
[32:45] they leave a place for elijah they leave
[32:47] the door open for elijah all right
[32:49] elise truly shall first come and restore
[32:52] all things
[32:54] period now elijah go and get that
[32:58] brother
[33:00] okay
[33:02] well brother joel get it in
[33:04] elijah
[33:06] elijah did not or the spirit of elijah
[33:10] through john the baptist did not restore
[33:12] all things
[33:14] right right he didn't he preached
[33:16] repentance he didn't preach baptism in
[33:18] the name lord jesus christ
[33:21] so lives truly shall first come and
[33:23] restore all things
[33:25] and that to me shall is future right
[33:28] that's now
[33:30] right that's the elijah that we have
[33:34] but i'm saying to you that elijah has
[33:36] come already
[33:40] john the baptist
[33:42] and they knew him not but have done it
[33:44] to him whatsoever they listed likewise
[33:46] shall also the son of man
[33:48] suffer
[33:49] of them
[33:54] god
