[19:50] pedigree so let's look and see what what
[19:53] God Said Today to the th tyan Church age
[19:57] and part three will be death
[20:00] by death and we'll explain that here in
[20:02] just a minute but death by
[20:07] death so let's read Revelations 1 I was
[20:10] in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[20:11] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[20:13] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[20:14] first and the last and what thou see us
[20:17] in a book write it in a book and send it
[20:19] to the seven churches it was so
[20:20] important they wanted it he wanted John
[20:22] to write it down and give it to the
[20:23] churches all right why because it set
[20:25] the tone for every Church it set the
[20:27] tone for every um star is set the tone
[20:30] for every person that lived in those
[20:32] ages is set the tone for them all right
[20:35] Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra the one
[20:37] that we're talking about today Sardis
[20:39] Philadelphia and leosa I turned to see
[20:42] the voice that spake with me I saw seven
[20:43] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[20:46] the seven golden candlesticks one liken
[20:47] to the son of man clothed with a garment
[20:50] down to the foot and G about the PS with
[20:52] a golden girle you may be seated in the
[20:53] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[20:55] the
[20:57] word Josh I can't get
[21:00] this view off of here get that header
[21:03] off of there brother Anderson are you
[21:07] closer where you
[21:17] tapping one button just push
[21:21] it how
[21:25] simple Revelations 2 Verse 18 thank God
[21:29] for
[21:30] support and to the angel of the church
[21:32] in th write these things saith the Son
[21:35] of God which has lies has eyes like into
[21:38] flames of fire and his feet like fine
[21:40] brass and I Know Thy works and as we
[21:42] were reading this morning how many times
[21:43] did he say Works four different times he
[21:45] said your Works your works and then my
[21:47] works not withstanding I have a few
[21:49] things against thee because thou
[21:51] sufferest that woman Jezebel and we'll
[21:53] talk about that in just a minute which
[21:54] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[21:56] and seduce my servants to commit 40
[21:59] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[22:01] and I gave her space to repent of her
[22:03] fornication and she repented not God has
[22:07] given every Church age that that
[22:10] Darkness the Blackness that you see on
[22:11] the on the circles he gave them a time
[22:14] to repent he sent him a messenger he
[22:16] sent us a messenger he sent us time to
[22:19] repent my word we've been 60s something
[22:21] years since the prophet's been gone off
[22:23] the scene we ought to be getting
[22:24] something by now
[22:30] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[22:32] them that commit adultery with her into
[22:33] Great Tribulation we talking about he's
[22:35] talking about the what the great
[22:37] and her Harlot children right except
[22:40] they repent of their deeds and I will
[22:42] kill her children with death if we were
[22:46] going to talk about now I will kill her
[22:48] children with death not kill her
[22:51] children and they die I'm going to kill
[22:54] them with death and we'll see what that
[22:55] really means in the in the Greek in just
[22:57] a minute and all the churches shall know
[22:59] now he's talking about then all the
[23:00] churches shall know that I am he which
[23:03] searcheth the Reigns in heart and I will
[23:05] give unto every one of you according to
[23:07] your works but unto you I say unto the
[23:09] rest of thyra as many as have not this
[23:12] Doctrine in which have not known the
[23:13] depths of Satan as they speak I will put
[23:16] upon you none other burden in other
[23:17] words he's not going to like I said
[23:18] before there's not going to be this
[23:20] great Teaching Ministry there's not
[23:21] going to be this um there's not going to
[23:23] be a a a former Reign and a latter Reign
[23:26] all those things are given in the other
[23:27] ages but in their age it's just to
[23:31] survive be a Christian survive do their
[23:33] works and they got stronger as they
[23:36] seemingly got weaker to the world they
[23:38] got stronger right as they kept getting
[23:41] killed they got stronger in their faith
[23:44] that that's that's not common for me and
[23:46] you that that's totally contrary to our
[23:48] human nature come on somebody it is it's
[23:51] totally contrary to our human nature as
[23:53] we get we get more and more beat on us
[23:56] we get more and more
[23:57] worse but they get more better are
[24:00] better than what they were and he that
[24:02] overcometh and keepeth my words all
[24:04] right unto the end to him will I give
[24:06] power over the Nations and he shall rule
[24:08] them with a rod of iron and the vessels
[24:10] of Potter of a Potter shall they break
[24:13] be broken to Shivers even as I received
[24:16] of my father and I will give him the
[24:17] Morning Star we'll talk about that next
[24:20] Sunday he that hath an ear let him hear
[24:23] what the spirit says to the churches and
[24:26] like our brother said Wednesday night
[24:29] it's it's say what set on tape not
[24:32] repeat what set on
[24:33] tape
[24:35] amen get the essence of the message the
[24:38] essence of the message of the hour is
[24:40] what's going to take us out of here the
[24:42] letter will kill you you can sit here
[24:44] and read me quotes until the Rapture
[24:46] takes place and you're going to die and
[24:48] go to hell if you don't have a
[24:49] revelation of what that quote says a
[24:52] revelation of not what brother Brandon
[24:55] meant well he meant to say this well who
[24:58] you to tell him what he meant to
[25:00] say God and him were like together okay
[25:04] so we there's nobody between him to
[25:06] correct him only God himself but now
[25:10] when he comes down to me and you we have
[25:12] to be corrected because we're not
[25:13] prophets we didn't get sure I think we
[25:16] get the things from the mind of God as
[25:17] we were talking about last night the
[25:19] back part of God's mind was not shut up
[25:21] it was it was for each one of us to go
[25:23] into the back part of God's mind because
[25:25] we need to get that Vision the Bible
[25:26] says without a vision the people perish
[25:29] without a vision that you and I have
[25:31] listen our goal is to come to
[25:34] Perfection our goal is to come to where
[25:37] death will be destroyed and the Saints
[25:39] will come out of the ground and come
[25:41] here with us that's our goal that's our
[25:43] mandate it's not just to live a nice
[25:45] Christian Life and see how long we can
[25:47] live and see how long we can say amen
[25:49] and how long we can go to church and how
[25:51] long we can that's not it right there's
[25:54] a goal to this message of the hour and
[25:57] that's the revelation of the Rapture and
[26:01] then back it up to the revelation of the
[26:04] Resurrection all right and what it's all
[26:07] about and that we are part of that
[26:09] listen we're recipients of that of that
[26:12] Resurrection Paul's already told us
[26:14] we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[26:16] places in our soul but boy the other
[26:18] part is not it's sitting here wanting to
[26:20] go to sleep right so and you're not yet
[26:23] I'm just saying you know that's but
[26:24] that's the contrast that thing in your
[26:26] soul is just running m million million
[26:29] million miles an hour it's it's
[26:32] Eternal but now when you get to the
[26:34] spirit realm it's much slow down a
[26:36] little bit then when you get in the body
[26:39] it just reacts to what the rest of it
[26:43] is but remember we got to let it out we
[26:47] got to let it out and let it
[26:49] live do not keep it in let it out
[26:52] whatever it is if you want to start
[26:53] shouting and screaming and praising the
[26:55] Lord please do so please please do so do
[26:59] not say well I'm I will when brother Dy
[27:02] does well you may wait a
[27:04] while
[27:05] okay but maybe
[27:07] not but I hope that I I pray that the
[27:10] that the holy spirit that was that was
[27:12] here just now that it would saturate all
[27:15] of us and we'd all start screaming and
[27:17] shouting and we we not going to be like
[27:18] Pentecostal we're not going to say well
[27:20] we couldn't preach because because you
[27:23] know we just sang and no there's a time
[27:25] for worship there's a time to hear the
[27:27] word of God there but there is a time
[27:29] that the Holy Ghost will fall on a
[27:31] building and it just as brother George
[27:33] Quinn I never seen it till just a few
[27:35] minutes ago brother George Quinn said he
[27:37] said it becomes a Milky it's like it's
[27:38] it's like you lose your it's like it's
[27:41] fuzzy he's seen it several several times
[27:43] even here well that's what happened just
[27:45] a few minutes ago it's like I lost my
[27:47] contacts it just became
[27:50] fuzzy I hope somebody got something amen
[27:54] and you just claim it if you didn't feel
[27:55] it don't worry about it if you didn't
[27:57] see it don't worry about it
[27:58] I didn't see that but I believe it
[28:00] happened I didn't see the pillow of fire
[28:02] over brother Brown's head or the pillow
[28:04] of fire the other day uh somebody said
[28:06] they saw it going through the building
[28:07] not here but another place I didn't see
[28:09] that but remember we
[28:12] believe to
[28:14] see we don't see to believe we believe
[28:18] and then we see all right so let's look
[28:21] at this the tiing church age just for a
[28:23] minute it was the longest Church age it
[28:25] was the Dark Ages but God was still
[28:27] working God was still moving he was
[28:30] happy to be in those people that were in
[28:32] prison he was happy to be with those
[28:34] people and he knew what was going to
[28:36] happen to him and and as brother Bram
[28:38] said whoever that commentator was back
[28:39] way back when he was alive that that
[28:42] said brother brandham said said God just
[28:44] looked like he folded his arms up and
[28:46] sat back and watched everybody get
[28:48] killed in the Dark Ages you know what
[28:50] brother Brown said he said he didn't
[28:51] know what he was talking about he said
[28:53] that was the tender hand of
[28:56] Jehovah we don't understand that now
[28:59] when you read that quote you're going
[29:01] wait a minute but you see that that's
[29:03] God had to let that happen to let that
[29:06] go in the ground to die so that it could
[29:09] come back up in the next three Church
[29:11] ages so it had to be the continuity of
[29:13] God he said the seed's got to go into
[29:16] the ground there's got to be a time of
[29:17] planting well God was planting these
[29:19] people but it was the seed that came out
[29:22] in Luther Wesley and Pentecost and now
[29:24] in the message of the hour that's the
[29:26] only way we're going to get it it's for
[29:28] it to go into that Dark Age and for us
[29:30] to see though that even during that Dark
[29:32] Age there was a
[29:35] bride that physically got killed if they
[29:37] said they were bride physically you're
[29:39] not physically dead here
[29:42] today spiritually if you don't if you're
[29:44] not born again you are spiritually dead
[29:47] but you're dead while you're living
[29:49] we'll read that in just a few minutes
[29:51] cuz you're going to God's going to kill
[29:53] them with death by death right wow
[29:59] all right we'll look at in just a minute
[30:01] but we know that was Columba and we
[30:04] talked about this morning we know we
[30:05] talked about work so let's talk about
[30:06] that just one more one more minute
[30:08] because people there are a lot of people
[30:10] that does say well now you know if you
[30:13] got one side over here that says if you
[30:15] don't have any emotion you're
[30:17] dead Okay anything you can't move is
[30:20] dead that's what they say and then over
[30:22] here you got these people that just
[30:24] toled out a whistle and they shout and
[30:25] scream and and you don't get anything
[30:27] done
[30:29] wordwise but what do we do we bring it
[30:31] to the
[30:32] middle to where we have faith if we have
[30:36] faith it will show
[30:39] itself because the scripture says in
[30:41] James 2 course this is the ox age or the
[30:44] age of Works what does an ox do an ox
[30:46] works all right even so faith if it hath
[30:49] not works is dead being alone so if you
[30:52] separate the two oh I've got
[30:55] works oh I've got faith
[30:58] it's like car and
[31:00] gasoline they do you no good separate
[31:04] but when you put them together they fire
[31:06] the car so now we look at Faith I've got
[31:10] faith and my works are going to show
[31:12] that I got faith or that I don't all
[31:16] right so now listen yeah a man may say
[31:19] thou Hast faith and I have Works show me
[31:22] thy faith without thy works and I will
[31:24] show thee my faith by my works all right
[31:27] for as the body without the spirit is
[31:29] dead so faith without works is dead
[31:33] also all right look at what brother
[31:34] Brown says now here again we find the
[31:36] same introduction I Know Thy works the
[31:38] Son of God himself said believe me for
[31:40] the very Works sake he put an emphasis
[31:43] on his own Works while on Earth The
[31:46] Works that he did but now remember he
[31:48] stood one day and he said the works I do
[31:51] you shall do also all right so he has
[31:53] transferred that that that we're going
[31:56] to have healing we're going to have Hey
[31:58] listen we're going to have
[31:59] multiplication of bread we're going to
[32:01] have limbs restored we're going to have
[32:04] dead
[32:07] raised and we've had had it before we
[32:11] have had it so so it's not something
[32:12] uncommon we have had it all right so he
[32:15] puts an emphasis on his own Works while
[32:17] on Earth The Works that he did were
[32:18] ordained of God look to inspire faith in
[32:21] him all right it was a great part of his
[32:25] ministry but now remember it was a first
[32:28] part just as brother brandom's first
[32:29] part of his ministry was
[32:32] Works hello somebody the first part of
[32:35] his ministry was 50,000 people thousand
[32:39] people in every service would be healed
[32:41] or hundreds of people would be
[32:43] healed right but he had faith and having
[32:47] the faith he had the work showed that he
[32:50] had faith and what is he doing he said
[32:52] get the people he said get the people
[32:55] the angel said get the people to believe
[32:57] you right then you'll see the
[33:00] works see but that was a special
[33:02] Ministry I don't have to stand here
[33:03] today and said now look you got to
[33:04] believe in
[33:06] me no you got to have faith for
[33:09] yourself I'll bind my faith with yours
[33:11] and everybody else will bind their faith
[33:14] and then what we'll see the works that
[33:16] comes from that I believe that truly
[33:19] believe that for we are his workmanship
[33:22] Paul said now work workmanship we
[33:24] working for it all right created in
[33:27] Christ Jesus under good works which God
[33:29] hath ordained that we should walk in
[33:31] them Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to
[33:34] inspire faith in him as they would show
[33:36] forth that relationship to him that Paul
[33:38] described as created in him now works
[33:40] will never take the place of Faith now
[33:42] watch it will never take the place of
[33:45] God of faith in God for our Salvation
[33:49] right CU remember here's where we stand
[33:52] to where we say
[33:55] Okay XYZ I did as the Pentecostal said I
[33:59] spoke in tongues I must have the Holy
[34:01] Ghost no brother Brown said the great
[34:04] what was the great um mystery in the end
[34:06] time was to receive the new birth
[34:08] without what
[34:10] sensation ah no
[34:12] works but once you get born again oh
[34:15] come on works here we go and it's the
[34:18] true works it's not you're trying to
[34:20] work it up right we're not trying to
[34:23] work it up Pentecostals tried to work it
[34:24] up brother BR said they tooted it after
[34:27] whistle another words they they put so
[34:29] much emphasis on the works and emotion
[34:31] and all that till they didn't even they
[34:33] didn't want to hear Brother Ram's sermon
[34:35] come
[34:36] on many people that was in his in his uh
[34:41] Services said we were just waiting to
[34:43] the end to get to the to see the signs
[34:45] and wonders well they missed the whole
[34:48] sermon that's why it took us 60 years to
[34:50] get everything back
[34:53] together no offense to anybody but it
[34:55] just wasn't time it time it's time now
[34:58] though yes but works will show forth our
[35:02] faith already placed in him so you got
[35:04] to have faith first yes are your works
[35:07] are no good like I said there's many
[35:10] people work work work work work work
[35:12] work ain't got the new birth well
[35:13] somewhere they're going to run out of
[35:16] gas but you and I that are born again we
[35:19] should never run out of gas they should
[35:22] always be we should always be looking
[35:24] for works we should always be looking to
[35:27] let hands on the sick and they shall
[35:29] recover we should always be looking at
[35:31] well that person needs something in
[35:33] their life God let me pray with
[35:36] them that's what we're here
[35:40] for but they will come forth oh good
[35:44] works won't save you all right but they
[35:46] will come forth out of a saved life yes
[35:50] as fruit unto the
[35:52] Lord I believe in good work brother
[35:55] Brandon was very one I know he did
[35:56] believe in good work
[35:58] even if a man is not saved he ought to
[36:00] do good works and do the best he can
[36:02] that's right what is horrible is the
[36:05] sight of God in the sight of God is for
[36:07] men to do evil works and then say
[36:10] they're doing the will of God now just
[36:13] as the pope stood up and said if you
[36:15] don't fall before the Catholic church
[36:17] and if you don't pray in front of this
[36:19] crucifix you're going to die that's what
[36:22] happened that's where the 68 million
[36:24] people
[36:25] died it wasn't drunk fighting
[36:29] drunks it wasn't the unsaved fighting
[36:32] the saved so to say it was the church
[36:35] fighting the church are the church
[36:37] fighting a
[36:39] bride and they say they're doing the
[36:40] will of God in this verse he is
[36:42] commending his children because they
[36:44] were living changed life listen get your
[36:47] life changed first and the quietness of
[36:50] the hour ask God to come into your
[36:54] life don't worry about if you hear bells
[36:56] and whistles
[36:58] and and and works comes that's great
[37:00] that works would come I I would and Paul
[37:03] even said I would that you would speak
[37:04] in tongues but you don't have
[37:07] to ain't that what he say in the Bible I
[37:09] would that you do that I would that you
[37:11] would do that that let God utter through
[37:13] you something that nobody else can
[37:15] understand it should be for yourself in
[37:17] a church sitting but brother Bram spoke
[37:20] in tongues remember in the room he said
[37:21] I heard somebody and I thought they was
[37:22] speaking in tongues he said it was me
[37:25] well he was that was speaking in tongues
[37:26] for himself all right you say what are
[37:29] you saying about speaking speaking in
[37:31] tongues listen speaking in tongues is
[37:32] part of the is part of the seven
[37:35] spirits okay tongues and interpretation
[37:39] we should be able to use them
[37:42] all but I think sometimes listen just
[37:44] for a second I think sometimes we're
[37:46] scared I think sometimes we're scared
[37:48] because there was so much brother R said
[37:51] about order of speaking in tongue right
[37:55] and how it should be used and how it
[37:57] should not be used and how that if it's
[37:59] used wrong there's a spirit in the
[38:01] church I think we're all like I don't
[38:04] know if I want to do this or not you
[38:05] know and you might have the unction to
[38:07] do
[38:09] it well if it's of God you're quenching
[38:12] the
[38:14] spirit let it rip amen we'll correct it
[38:17] if he needs correcting I think we know
[38:19] enough a conduct order and Doctrine to
[38:20] tell when it needs to be corrected or
[38:22] not amen just let the Spirit fall like
[38:25] it did a few minutes ago and I'll
[38:26] guarantee if we stayed here long enough
[38:28] somebody would have probably started
[38:29] speaking in tongue cuz it was just so
[38:31] strong it was it was a u I hadn't felt
[38:34] it in a long time but praise God I hope
[38:36] you did
[38:37] too men saw their good works and
[38:39] glorified God their Works testified to a
[38:42] new spirit within yes sir if you are a
[38:45] Christian you are going to do what is
[38:47] right okay your Works will show that
[38:50] your heart is right and it won't do
[38:52] something it won't be something that you
[38:54] put on for you will do his will when no
[38:56] one but God God sees
[38:59] you and you will do his will even if it
[39:03] cost you your
[39:04] life brother Brown said works is Faith
[39:11] expressed the Lord tells us that I Know
[39:13] Thy works and the last to be more than
[39:15] the first brother R said this is
[39:16] certainly remarkable as the darkness of
[39:19] the age increased as the honor rooll of
[39:21] the martyrs grew lengthier day by day
[39:23] they worked all the harder they served
[39:25] all the more and their faith in increase
[39:28] that's just really a paradox that's just
[39:29] something that we're not used to cuz
[39:31] when we we start getting beat on what do
[39:33] we do find a place hide we don't stand
[39:37] up bold and say hey
[39:38] satan I'm
[39:40] here all right we're no match for him I
[39:43] know that but their Works their faith
[39:47] with the works attached to it defeated
[39:49] the devil in that church age because
[39:51] Satan would have wiped them out Satan
[39:54] would wiped me and you out Satan wants
[39:56] us all dead this whole building he would
[39:58] love for it to disappear he would love
[40:01] for it to
[40:02] disappear but praise God we find
[40:04] somebody else that's in love with us
[40:06] more than the devil is the Lord Jesus is
[40:09] in love with us so much he ain't going
[40:10] to let that happen he ain't ever going
[40:13] to let that happen but we got to attach
[40:15] oursel to him as brother Ernie says we
[40:18] plugged oursel into the
[40:22] Eternal the harder they worked all the
[40:25] harder they served all the more in their
[40:27] Faith increased how tragic it was in the
[40:30] in the Ephesian age when love W remember
[40:32] it said you've lost your first love and
[40:34] truly nothing has said of the increased
[40:37] labor of love in the other ages so
[40:39] there's nothing talked about in other
[40:40] ages about increasing as the church age
[40:43] gets longer remember all the other ones
[40:45] decreased as the church age got longer
[40:47] remember went up then the church age
[40:49] came in and it started going what
[40:51] started going down then God sent a
[40:53] porter to catch the message and pick it
[40:55] back up
[40:57] but in this age he says but in this age
[40:59] in the darkest of all ages they served
[41:01] him even
[41:04] more what a lesson that is there's no
[41:07] ceasing of this gracious service of Love
[41:10] unto the Lord but rather an increasing
[41:12] of it that is the secret let the enemy
[41:15] attempt to thwart our service to the
[41:16] Lord our reply is increased
[41:22] service nobody likes to get sick right
[41:24] we do not like to get sick you you know
[41:27] you just can't get up in the morning and
[41:28] say all right devil if you're going to
[41:30] make me sick just go
[41:32] ahead
[41:33] no usually we get up feeling pretty bad
[41:36] anyway if we're older and got some um
[41:39] ailments about us but say Lord increase
[41:42] my faith increase my faith right
[41:46] remember that remember that story that
[41:47] brother R told and I love that story
[41:49] that guy's coming in you know he's he's
[41:51] coming into a community and he's getting
[41:53] all this building ready and he's putting
[41:55] hammering nails and he's nailing stuff
[41:57] up the guy goes by and says you better
[41:59] be careful said that guy over there said
[42:01] said you uh you going to have to speak
[42:03] to him because he's he don't like
[42:05] preachers and he don't like the Lord and
[42:06] he don't like church service and you
[42:08] better watch what you're doing well
[42:10] remember he met the guy and the guy come
[42:13] in he said look buddy if you going to
[42:14] have something in this community you
[42:16] going to have to go through
[42:18] me well the old preacher didn't say well
[42:21] I'm just let me go pray about this he
[42:24] rolled his sleeves up and he started in
[42:27] the guy and he said I must fight to rain
[42:30] I must fight to rain and he kept beating
[42:33] the guy and finally got the guy saved in
[42:35] one of the meetings so don't cow down to
[42:38] the devil like that don't do that just
[42:41] say Lord increase my faith teach me Lord
[42:44] how to wait upon you but our reply
[42:48] should be always increase
[42:52] service when the faint are crying in
[42:55] fear that is the time to shout the
[43:01] victory that is time to shout the
[43:07] victory brother R said I want to give
[43:09] you a warning here it says concerning
[43:10] the last day now he's he's come up to us
[43:13] that because of abounding iniquity the
[43:15] love of many will watch cold and the L
[43:18] ofy and or last AG self-love and love
[43:20] for material things will take the place
[43:22] of the true love of God we see it
[43:25] everywhere everywhere
[43:27] we need to guard against the power of
[43:29] sin in these last days so many are
[43:31] getting so hard because they haven't
[43:33] realized the effect of this last day
[43:36] Spirit have you and I been caught up in
[43:38] that think about it have we been caught
[43:40] up in that in that lay out of sin LAX
[43:44] easy go whatever happens you know no you
[43:47] got to fight to
[43:50] win so many are getting so hard because
[43:52] they haven't realized the effects of
[43:53] this last day spirit it's time to draw
[43:55] nigh to God and let him our lives with
[43:57] his love or we will feel the coldness of
[44:01] the last day Church oh please don't let
[44:03] that happen please let the P I want the
[44:06] power of God like it was a few minutes
[44:07] ago in every church service I want to
[44:10] expect it in every church service and I
[44:12] want I don't want me to be the one that
[44:14] brings it I want you to be the one that
[44:16] brings it you bring it with you you
[44:18] bring your
[44:21] fire let's see what
[44:24] happens or we will feel the coldness of
[44:26] the last State church and we'll reject
[44:28] the truth of God which alone is able to
[44:31] help us the truth that help us we reject
[44:34] it like I said before the first time we
[44:36] get in bad situation or or um there's
[44:39] two things if you get in money trouble
[44:41] which is your fault anyway Amen Brother
[44:43] John amen your fault anyway there's one
[44:47] thing the devil can't do either he can't
[44:48] get in your
[44:49] pocketbook you got to let him in I'm
[44:52] going to preach now
[44:54] okay okay he's the one that get he he's
[44:57] not the one that I don't even have my
[44:58] bill phone he's the one he's he's not
[45:01] the one that reaches in and gets them
[45:02] dollar bills out of your bill phone who
[45:04] does that you do it right amen you do it
[45:08] and usually ain't dollar bills usually
[45:10] it's a credit anyway credit card so
[45:15] anyway so who's our biggest enemy we are
[45:19] we're our biggest enemy we're our
[45:20] biggest we're our biggest issue what
[45:22] issues do you
[45:24] have me
[45:29] everybody say me I heard some of you say
[45:34] you no it's all of us but it's like that
[45:38] quote just said it can you live it
[45:40] though when nobody sees you but
[45:44] God see to me that's the fire that's the
[45:48] Thunder as brother Brown said that's the
[45:50] Thunder that makes the devil back up he
[45:52] cannot stand a lived life of God even
[45:57] though be whacked and beat he can come
[45:59] and and like job I'm sure the devil was
[46:02] like just let me add him I'll make him
[46:06] curse you and the Lord's going okay all
[46:09] right you just can't take his life and
[46:12] the more he put on job the more job
[46:13] stood up and said I know my redeemer
[46:15] liveth it's just something Satan can't
[46:18] understand he's said listen he has a
[46:20] defeated mentality but he has tried to
[46:23] to uh trick himself into believing he
[46:25] can win
[46:28] cuz he's not the Creator the Creator's
[46:30] inside of me and you I want you to
[46:33] understand that there's not a God
[46:34] standing up here in Heaven There is but
[46:37] there's not a god up there and he's
[46:38] nowhere
[46:40] else he shed abroad his heart his life
[46:43] he shed a broad out into me and you to
[46:46] what to defeat the Devil no other
[46:48] purpose but to defeat him and we're
[46:50] going to defeat him in the flesh that
[46:52] Satan supposedly defeated Us in in the
[46:55] garden hello somebody right we're going
[46:57] to take a body
[46:59] change Satan can't take a body change
[47:01] Satan can't raise the
[47:03] dead Satan can't kill
[47:07] you so let's look just for a second then
[47:10] we'll get into
[47:11] this it was a dominating female or
[47:14] church now watch how it started remember
[47:16] we went to Ephesus it started in Ephesus
[47:19] as the worship of Diana all right which
[47:22] is a woman and a female types to what
[47:24] the church and th now that was a
[47:27] propheus that sat on a three-legged
[47:28] stool three legs three-legged stool and
[47:32] prophesied supposedly what God or who
[47:36] whoever it was said and then in our age
[47:38] look how it's come up to now it's the
[47:40] great wh and her
[47:41] daughters it's always a she it's always
[47:44] the
[47:46] church so the city of thyra had many
[47:48] rivers and they look very beautiful the
[47:50] the commentator said but by the time you
[47:52] dived in and come out you had leeches
[47:53] all over you think of the leeches that
[47:56] were in that church age it was called
[47:59] the Catholic
[48:00] Church they tried to suck the life out
[48:02] of Satan tried to suck the life out of
[48:04] you doesn't he that's what a leech does
[48:07] a leech attaches itself to you does you
[48:09] no good but sucks the life out of you
[48:11] the worship was of Apollo the son
[48:14] God spoke to a propheus who sat on a
[48:17] three-legged chair and delivered a
[48:18] message and you had to belong to that
[48:20] Temple or you were persecuted you can't
[48:22] according to the history you couldn't
[48:25] have a a a business
[48:27] unless you were attached to the church
[48:29] that church that Temple that worship not
[48:32] the worship of God the worship of their
[48:34] God which was
[48:36] Apollo now watch not withstanding I have
[48:39] a few things against thee because thou
[48:40] has sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[48:43] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[48:44] and seduce my servants to commit
[48:46] fornication and eat things sacrificed
[48:49] unto
[48:50] Idols I was talking brother um Bautista
[48:54] in the back Wednesday night
[48:56] and his his his thought was exactly true
[48:59] we know that for a fact but you realize
[49:02] something that Elijah all right now
[49:03] Elijah Elijah stood one day and said the
[49:08] dogs will lick your blood right he
[49:12] didn't see
[49:15] that he didn't see that but he
[49:17] pronounced judgment on
[49:20] her brother Ram stood and pronounced
[49:24] judgment on the church
[49:27] amen but who saw her
[49:30] defeated who saw her
[49:33] die
[49:35] Elisha the
[49:37] bride we see the
[49:40] culmination of he indicted this
[49:43] generation but we see the end he gave
[49:45] these prophecies but we see the end
[49:48] Elijah made these promises but Elisha
[49:50] saw the end of Jezebel so that's what
[49:52] we're going to see we're going to see
[49:54] the end of Jezebel in US now we know
[49:57] that's going straight through into the
[49:58] tribulation but it's going to be away
[50:01] from us this Jezebel system is not going
[50:04] to touch the bride of
[50:07] Christ so they suffered that woman
[50:10] Jezebel which we should not which means
[50:11] they allowed it to
[50:13] happen they got a little
[50:16] LAX and I gave her space to repent of
[50:19] her fornication and she repented not
[50:21] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[50:23] them that commit adultery with her into
[50:24] Great Tribulation except they rep repent
[50:26] of their deeds and I will kill her
[50:29] children with death all right everybody
[50:32] with me Bible says in first Timothy
[50:35] we're going to get in the Bible here in
[50:36] just a minute we're going to run through
[50:37] pretty quick 1 Timothy 5:6 but say she
[50:40] that liveth in pleasure is
[50:45] dead while she liveth that's a paradox
[50:48] we look at people and if they've passed
[50:50] on they ain't breathing they're in a
[50:51] casket they're
[50:52] dead
[50:54] right but this quote is telling us that
[50:57] there is there is a
[50:59] she that's going to be
[51:01] breathing moving
[51:04] doing but she's
[51:08] dead so let's read what will the
[51:11] punishment of the Harlot be and her
[51:13] children well it's going to be twofold
[51:15] first he said I will cast her into a bed
[51:18] according to the last part of verse 22
[51:19] it will be in a bed of tribulation or
[51:22] the Great Tribulation we know that the
[51:24] great and her children are going
[51:25] through the tribulation
[51:27] all right you know what they even know
[51:29] they're going through the
[51:31] tribulation remember you left behind in
[51:33] all those different movies it's all a
[51:36] lie it's all a lie it's all doctrinal
[51:38] issues that come from a pull pit that
[51:40] says we're going to have three and a
[51:42] half years of major Tri tribulation
[51:43] three and a half years of minor if you
[51:45] don't make it in the first three and a
[51:46] half you'll make it in the next one well
[51:48] that's a lie if you're here when the
[51:51] bombs start falling you have missed it
[51:53] you will be here until you die and you
[51:55] go into the white Throne judgement
[51:57] you ain't going to try to figure out how
[51:59] to make it we had a a guy in the message
[52:01] he said he's trying to figure out how to
[52:02] make it through the tribulation I said
[52:03] so am
[52:06] I but mine ain't like yours I ain't
[52:09] building bunkers and buying silver and
[52:12] gold I'm figuring out how to just
[52:15] completely miss the whole thing all
[52:17] right amen we all are I mean it's kind
[52:19] of crazy you an ounce of gold is what
[52:21] $3,000 something dollars and it's just a
[52:23] little old piece about this big right
[52:25] that an ounce I said 'what are you going
[52:27] to do I said you got an ounce of gold
[52:28] what are you going to do you're going to
[52:29] go to the you're going to go to the gas
[52:31] station and say I need about $20 worth
[52:35] of no they're going to take that whole
[52:37] bar away from you so let's just figure
[52:40] out how to make it before the Rapture I
[52:43] mean before the tribulation takes place
[52:45] and we ain't got to figure out how to
[52:47] make it and buy all these meals ready to
[52:49] eat and all that other garbage come on
[52:52] we got a message that'll get us out of
[52:54] here we got a word of God that'll get us
[52:56] way above that promised we'd not even
[53:00] bomb fall till we got out of here now we
[53:03] might be persecuted we might be shot we
[53:05] might be put in prison but praise God
[53:08] we're not going to go through the
[53:12] tribulation that is exactly what Jesus
[53:14] said in
[53:16] Matthew 25 1-13 there were 10 versions
[53:19] five were wise five were foolish the
[53:21] five wise had oil the Holy Ghost but the
[53:23] other five did not when the crowd went
[53:25] out behold the bridegroom cometh the
[53:27] five fool now listen the five foolish
[53:29] heard the
[53:31] call are you with me the five foolish
[53:35] heard the call and they were
[53:41] virgins unless the Bible's Wrong five
[53:44] foolish virgins now they may have been
[53:46] virgins but they were foolish but they
[53:48] heard the
[53:50] cry the world outside go out there and
[53:53] go to YouTube and put in end time oh
[53:55] you'll get hundreds of videos of this
[53:57] one's this one's opinion of this and
[54:00] this one's opinion of that and you got
[54:02] one guy looks like a rabbi you got one
[54:03] guy looks like a goon you got you got
[54:07] you got women you know with hair short
[54:08] as mine and they're they're all got
[54:10] their opinion but they're all saying one
[54:12] thing it's
[54:14] near it's
[54:16] close they see some of the pieces of the
[54:18] puzzle coming together and they're
[54:20] hearing the cry but remember they're
[54:22] hearing the Cry of not a bridegroom
[54:25] they're hearing this
[54:26] but it's not to
[54:28] them we marry him cuz we Are Born Again
[54:32] by the Holy
[54:34] Ghost praise the
[54:37] Lord the five foolish had to run seeking
[54:40] oil while the five wise virgins went on
[54:42] into the marriage the five that remained
[54:44] outside were left to the Great
[54:46] Tribulation that is what will happen to
[54:48] all who do not go up in the Rapture that
[54:51] is what will come upon the Harlot and
[54:53] her daughters secondly it says that he
[54:56] will kill them with death now watch this
[54:58] the literal translation is let them be
[55:01] put to death with
[55:05] death let them be put to death with
[55:09] death this is a strange saying we might
[55:12] say let a man let a man be put to death
[55:14] by hanging by El execution or some other
[55:16] way but this says let them put be put to
[55:19] death by death death itself is the cause
[55:24] of their death
[55:27] right think about
[55:30] that I want you to see this clearly so
[55:32] I'll take our illustration again of the
[55:34] daughter of Jezebel marrying into the
[55:36] house of Judah and thereby bringing it
[55:38] right into idolatry and causing God to
[55:40] deliver Judah to death you remember that
[55:42] happened in the Bible this is what balum
[55:45] did so here was Jezebel with her
[55:46] paganism over there was Judah look
[55:49] properly worshipping God and living
[55:51] under the word but when when Jezebel
[55:54] sent her daughter to marry what happened
[55:56] watch this over there in Judah properly
[55:58] worshiping God so Jezebel marries her
[56:00] daughter to jehoram the minute that
[56:03] happens jehoram causes the people to
[56:05] become idolators the minute that
[56:07] marriage took place Judah was
[56:09] dead we look back in that third Church
[56:12] age it means thoroughly married when
[56:14] that church age got married when church
[56:16] and state come together they died never
[56:19] will they resurrect again spiritual
[56:21] death came in the minute the First
[56:23] Church of Rome organized it died right
[56:27] the minute that the lutherans organized
[56:29] death came in and they died the
[56:31] Pentecost was boy now he stirred up a
[56:33] hornet's nest right
[56:35] here cuz about 90% of them in his
[56:38] congregation was
[56:39] Pentecostals the Pentecostals came up
[56:42] but he didn't mind saying it did he the
[56:44] Pentecostals came along last last and
[56:46] they organized the spirit left though
[56:49] they don't believe
[56:52] it that's right but he did that marriage
[56:56] brought death then the light of the
[56:59] Oneness of the God had come they
[57:00] organized they died now watch him watch
[57:02] him watch him bring this in show who he
[57:05] is but never mention his name watch so
[57:09] they organized and they died now this is
[57:11] a Pentecostal age then after the fire of
[57:14] God fell on the Ohio River in
[57:18] 1933 a healing Revival swept the world
[57:21] but it never came through any
[57:23] organization God went outside the
[57:25] Pentecostal group outside of
[57:27] organization and what he's what he is
[57:30] going to do in the future is going to be
[57:32] outside organization too God can't work
[57:36] through the dead he can only work
[57:39] through the living members those living
[57:42] members are outside of Babylon so you
[57:45] see death our organization came and the
[57:48] church died or to make it plainer death
[57:52] became a resident wherein shortly before
[57:56] only life
[57:58] reigned as the original Eve brought
[58:01] death to mankind so now organization has
[58:03] brought death for organization is the
[58:05] product of the double
[58:08] corruptors
[58:10] nanism and
[58:12] bism
[58:14] propagated by Jezebel got to have
[58:18] three Now Eve should have been burned
[58:20] along with a serpent for her awful deed
[58:23] but Adam intervened taking her quickly
[58:24] to himself in other words took upon
[58:27] himself her sin so that she was saved
[58:30] but when this satanic religion has gone
[58:32] to the full course of the ages now
[58:34] that's what we're looking at right now
[58:37] yes there will be no one to
[58:42] intervene right and she will be burned
[58:44] with her Seducer for the and her
[58:47] children and the Antichrist and Satan
[58:49] will all find their place in the Lake of
[58:52] Fire amen Hall all right now we're going
[58:55] to read some scriptures now look under
[58:57] the law let's set the stage here for a
[58:59] minute we're going to talk about death
[59:00] by
[59:01] death all right strange thing but that's
[59:05] what brother bam said and that's what it
[59:06] means in the scripture and I will kill
[59:08] her with death all right let's see what
[59:10] this death is now we know for a fact we
[59:13] are looking at death now as far as quit
[59:16] breathing we got to put you in in a in a
[59:18] casket and put you in the ground or
[59:20] cremate or whatever more and we don't
[59:22] see you you
[59:23] disappear all right so that's that's
[59:25] what we call humanly we call death all
[59:28] right but the Bible then tells us that
[59:30] we're dead while we're alive you could
[59:32] be sitting here today without a new
[59:33] birth you're dead and you're just
[59:36] breathing and you can go run 200 miles
[59:37] or whatever you do you're dead all right
[59:41] so now look let's look at what the law
[59:43] tells
[59:44] us about death everybody with are you
[59:48] ready come cuz you fixing to get an eye
[59:50] opener some of you need one
[59:54] already under the law
[59:57] Exodus
[59:58] 21:12 he that smiteth a man so that he
[1:00:01] die he shall
[1:00:03] surely be put to
[1:00:06] death no
[1:00:08] court now we know there's Provisions we
[1:00:10] know as that we go on the further
[1:00:12] there's cities that you can run into
[1:00:13] Refuge cities but you got to wait till
[1:00:16] the priest dies before you get out of
[1:00:17] that City so you still got to wait till
[1:00:19] somebody
[1:00:20] dies all right he that smileth his
[1:00:22] father or his mother shall be surely put
[1:00:25] to death well that's thinning the crowd
[1:00:28] out a little
[1:00:29] bit hey we fixing get and he that curses
[1:00:33] his father or his
[1:00:36] mother
[1:00:39] what this is the Old Testament if they
[1:00:41] heard you cursing at your parents you
[1:00:45] died physical death right cuz you got to
[1:00:48] remember in the Old Testament remember
[1:00:50] there was Grace we know that but it
[1:00:52] wasn't Grace like what we got when since
[1:00:54] Jesus Christ all right cuz were born he
[1:00:56] was born under the law under the law you
[1:00:59] do this you don't do that all right keep
[1:01:01] keep reading you ready it gets better

[1:01:07] you everyone who don't come to
[1:01:11] church amen some of y'all going to
[1:01:15] die shall surely be put to death and I'm
[1:01:18] not I'm I'm I said that to make it a
[1:01:20] little bit softer but if you didn't go
[1:01:23] if you did something listen there was a
[1:01:25] guy picked up
[1:01:26] sticks on the Sabbath day and they
[1:01:29] stoned him because the law said to do it
[1:01:33] what every time this happened though it
[1:01:35] wasn't just because God loved death he
[1:01:38] wanted to keep his church clean come on
[1:01:40] somebody he wanted to keep it clean
[1:01:42] that's why he got rid of the hor mongers
[1:01:44] he got rid of the people that killed
[1:01:45] people he got rid of the PE the sorry he
[1:01:48] got rid of the kids that were
[1:01:49] disobedient to their
[1:01:53] parents everyone that defil it shall
[1:01:56] surely be put to death for whosoever
[1:01:58] does any work therein that Soul shall be
[1:02:01] cut off from among his people six days
[1:02:04] may work be done but in the seventh is
[1:02:07] the Sabbath of rest holy to the Lord
[1:02:10] whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath
[1:02:12] day he shall surely be put to death
[1:02:16] everybody all right with that you
[1:02:17] shouldn't be all right Leviticus 20: 10
[1:02:22] but this is the Bible listen folks this
[1:02:25] is the this is what they lived under
[1:02:26] just like we live under the laws now all
[1:02:29] right speeding drinking driving blah
[1:02:31] blah blah killing murdering actually a
[1:02:34] lot of our laws come from this right
[1:02:37] most of our laws were designed from the
[1:02:39] from the Old Testament everybody know
[1:02:41] that I mean they were modified a little
[1:02:43] bit but they surely were taken from the
[1:02:45] same thing cuz you look now watch this
[1:02:46] right here now we fixing the thin the
[1:02:48] crowd out just a little bit more and the
[1:02:50] man that committeth adultery with
[1:02:52] another man's wife even he that
[1:02:53] committeth adultery with his neighbors
[1:02:55] wife wife the adulterer and the
[1:02:58] adulteress shall surely be put to death
[1:03:03] whoa A man also or woman that hath a
[1:03:06] familiar Spirit
[1:03:08] uh-oh or as a wizard shall surely be put
[1:03:11] to death they shall Stone them with
[1:03:14] stones their blood shall be upon them
[1:03:17] Leviticus
[1:03:18] 24:16 he that blasphemeth the name of
[1:03:21] the Lord now we really thin in the crowd
[1:03:23] out now amen you talk about how they use
[1:03:26] the lord's name in vain and all that
[1:03:27] stuff out in the world if you'd have
[1:03:30] heard that in the in the camp of the
[1:03:31] Jews you'd have
[1:03:33] died and he that blasphemeth the name of
[1:03:36] the Lord he shall surely be put to death
[1:03:38] and all the congregation shall certainly
[1:03:40] Stone him as well the stranger as he
[1:03:43] that is born in the land when he
[1:03:44] blasphemeth the name of the Lord he
[1:03:46] shall be put to
[1:03:48] death that was the people outside the
[1:03:51] camp now watch this and when the
[1:03:54] Tabernacle sth forward the Levites shall
[1:03:57] take it down in other words when they
[1:03:59] got ready to
[1:04:00] move all right cuz remember what
[1:04:02] happened to the man with a cart David
[1:04:03] brought it in by the cart instead of by
[1:04:04] the by the priest and he he tried to he
[1:04:07] tried to do
[1:04:09] Works he tried to do Works he put his
[1:04:12] arms on that Arc and died immediately CU
[1:04:15] God said Whoever touched it even an
[1:04:17] animal touch it they die and the Levites
[1:04:19] shall take it down when the Tabernacle
[1:04:21] is to be pitched the Levites shall set
[1:04:24] it up and the the stranger that cometh
[1:04:26] nigh shall be put to death pretty
[1:04:30] stringent Joshua 1:16 and they answered
[1:04:33] Joshua saying all that thou commandest
[1:04:36] us we will do and whether soever thou
[1:04:38] sendest us we will go according as we
[1:04:41] hearkened un Moses in all things so will
[1:04:43] we hearken unto thee only the Lord thy
[1:04:46] God be with thee as he was with Moses
[1:04:49] whosoever he be that doth rebel against
[1:04:52] thy commandment
[1:04:55] whosoever he be that in other words
[1:04:59] becomes contrary
[1:05:03] to H
[1:05:07] Joshua whosoever he be that doth rebel
[1:05:10] against thy commandment and will not
[1:05:12] hearken unto thy words in all that thou
[1:05:15] commandest him he shall be put to death
[1:05:19] only be strong and of good courage
[1:05:20] judges 16:30 Samson said let me die with
[1:05:23] the Philistines and he bowed himself
[1:05:24] with all of his might and the house fell
[1:05:26] upon the Lords and upon all the people
[1:05:28] that were therein so the dead he slew at
[1:05:31] his death were more than they which he
[1:05:34] slew in his life but because of his
[1:05:38] transgression he had to die that
[1:05:40] death because of his transgression it
[1:05:42] stayed with him because they poked his
[1:05:44] eyes out his eyes didn't come back but
[1:05:46] his strength did his his hair grew again
[1:05:49] he said Lord just one more time so in
[1:05:52] his death he slew more he killed more
[1:05:55] then he slew in his lifetime Psalms
[1:05:58] 56:13 for thou Hast delivered my soul
[1:06:01] from
[1:06:02] Death wil thou Wilt not thou deliver my
[1:06:06] feet from falling that I may walk before
[1:06:08] God in the light of the living Psalms
[1:06:10] 11615 says precious in the sight of the
[1:06:12] Lord is the death of his Saints proverb
[1:06:16] 14:11 says the house of the wicked shall
[1:06:18] be overthrown but the Tabernacle of the
[1:06:20] right shall what flourish there is a way
[1:06:23] which seeth right unto man but the end
[1:06:25] thereof are the ways of
[1:06:29] death there is a way that seeth
[1:06:33] right but the end thereof are the ways
[1:06:36] of death Ecclesiastes 7 verse1 a good
[1:06:39] name is better than precious ointment
[1:06:41] and the day of death than the day of
[1:06:43] one's
[1:06:44] birth Isaiah 28:18 says your Covenant
[1:06:47] with Death Shall be dis anold and your
[1:06:51] agreement with hell shall not stand when
[1:06:53] the overflowing Scourge shall pass
[1:06:55] through then you shall be trotten down
[1:06:57] by it your Covenant with Death Shall be
[1:07:00] disowned now let's go over in to the New
[1:07:04] Testament now we know what Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] did he brought what he brought as in his
[1:07:09] death he brought life yes right all
[1:07:11] right verily verily I say unto you he
[1:07:13] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:07:14] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:07:17] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:07:19] is passed from Death unto
[1:07:22] life y'all must eat a lot of pasta today
[1:07:25] John 8 verse 51 verily verily I say unto
[1:07:28] you if a man keep my sayings now
[1:07:32] watch now Jesus lied if we take it like
[1:07:36] that read it ver verely verily I say
[1:07:39] unto you if a man keep my says he shall
[1:07:42] never see
[1:07:45] death we got Graves full of them if
[1:07:48] that's what he's talking about he's not
[1:07:51] talking about that he's he said y'all
[1:07:54] gonna fall asleep but you're not going
[1:07:56] to see death cuz you're going to die now
[1:07:58] you're going to die now the dead in
[1:07:59] Christ arise first yes then said the
[1:08:03] Jews unto him now we know that thou Hast
[1:08:05] a devil Abraham is dead and the prophets
[1:08:07] and thou sayith if man keep my sayings
[1:08:09] he shall never taste of death see they
[1:08:11] didn't get the they didn't get the
[1:08:12] Revelation acts 2:23 him being delivered
[1:08:16] by the determinant counsel and for
[1:08:18] knowledge of God you have taken and by
[1:08:19] Wicked hands crucified and slain whom
[1:08:21] God hath raised up having loosed the
[1:08:24] Pains of death they talk about Christ
[1:08:26] loose the Pains of death oh death
[1:08:28] where's your sting oh Graves where's
[1:08:30] your Victory because it was not possible
[1:08:32] that he should be holding of that death
[1:08:35] in other words acts
[1:08:37] 22:4 Paul
[1:08:38] says now talk about Grace we were
[1:08:41] talking about Grace the other
[1:08:42] day Paul
[1:08:45] persecuted this
[1:08:48] way unto
[1:08:50] death binding and delivering into prison
[1:08:53] both men and women
[1:08:56] he
[1:08:57] persecuted this way the Christians unto
[1:09:01] the
[1:09:02] death binding and delivering into prison
[1:09:05] both men and women Romans
[1:09:07] 5:10 for if when we were enemies we were
[1:09:09] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:09:11] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:09:14] be saved by his life and not only so but
[1:09:16] we also joy in God through our lord
[1:09:19] Jesus by whom we have now received the
[1:09:21] atonement wherefore look as by one man
[1:09:24] sin entered into the world world and
[1:09:26] death by sin that was who Adam all right
[1:09:30] and so death passed upon all men for
[1:09:32] that all have sinned for until the law
[1:09:35] sin was in the world but sin is not
[1:09:37] imputed when there's no law nevertheless
[1:09:40] death reigned I just read it to you from
[1:09:44] Adam to Moses even over them that hath
[1:09:46] not sinned after the similitude of
[1:09:48] Adam's transgression who is the figure
[1:09:50] of him that was to come but not as the
[1:09:53] offense now watch this gets confused if
[1:09:55] you don't stop from a minut so also is
[1:09:57] the free gift for if through the offense
[1:10:00] of one Adam many be dead much more the
[1:10:05] grace of God and the gift of Grace which
[1:10:08] is by one man Jesus Christ had abounded
[1:10:11] unto
[1:10:12] many and not as it was by one that sin
[1:10:16] so is the gift for the Judgment was by
[1:10:18] one to
[1:10:20] condemnation but the free gift is of
[1:10:22] many offenses to justification in other
[1:10:24] words Jesus Christ died one time all
[1:10:26] right died once for all to justify us
[1:10:29] for If by one man's offense death Reign
[1:10:31] by one much more they which receive
[1:10:33] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:10:35] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:10:37] Jesus Christ Romans 5:19 for it's by one
[1:10:40] man's Disobedience many were made
[1:10:42] Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall
[1:10:45] many be made righteous now watch
[1:10:48] moreover the law entered what I just
[1:10:49] read you the law entered and it was full
[1:10:52] of
[1:10:53] death pure like real death like killing
[1:10:56] you that the offense might abound but
[1:10:59] where sin abounded Grace did much more
[1:11:03] abound praise God that has sin hath
[1:11:07] reigned unto death even so my grace
[1:11:10] Reign through righteousness unto eternal
[1:11:13] life by Jesus our lord praise God for
[1:11:17] Paul know you not that so many of us
[1:11:19] were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[1:11:21] baptized into his death this is the
[1:11:23] baptism of scripture therefore we are
[1:11:25] buried with him by baptism into death in
[1:11:27] other words the dead in Christ yes all
[1:11:29] right that like as Christ was raised up
[1:11:32] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:11:34] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:11:35] of life for if we have been planted
[1:11:38] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:11:40] shall also be in the likeness of his
[1:11:42] resurrection as Brother Anderson and
[1:11:44] different ones said their scripture
[1:11:46] their whole scripture they couldn't pick
[1:11:47] one but it was Romans
[1:11:49] 8 it takes you from from the from the
[1:11:52] new birth to adoption to a body change
[1:11:55] change just in one just in one chapter
[1:11:57] there in Romans 8 so Romans 6:8 says now
[1:12:01] if we be dead with Christ all right now
[1:12:03] listen that's not not breathing that's
[1:12:05] right that's not killing like they did
[1:12:08] in the Old Testament that's dead to
[1:12:10] yourself The Old Man Died all right Dead
[1:12:13] with Christ we believe that we shall
[1:12:15] also live with him knowing that Christ
[1:12:18] being raised from the dead dieth no more
[1:12:20] death ha no more dominion over him death
[1:12:23] doesn't have dominion over a Christian
[1:12:25] if you look at it right like sister
[1:12:27] Johnny looked at us just yesterday and
[1:12:29] she said I am not afraid to
[1:12:33] die see I am not afraid of
[1:12:35] death I am just
[1:12:38] not when you come to
[1:12:43] that as brother Tom F Bush says you got
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:47] goods if you're afraid of dying you need
[1:12:50] to get born
[1:12:51] again knowing that Christ being raised
[1:12:53] from the dead dieth no More Death hath
[1:12:56] no more dominion over him now where's he
[1:12:58] living at now he's living inside of me
[1:13:00] and you for in that he died he died once
[1:13:03] under
[1:13:04] sin but in that he liveth he liveth un
[1:13:07] God likewise reckon you also yourselves
[1:13:09] to be dead now here we go dead not dead
[1:13:12] not breathing dead
[1:13:14] right but alive unto God through Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore
[1:13:20] reign in your mortal body that you
[1:13:22] should obey it and the lust thereof
[1:13:26] neither yield you your members as
[1:13:28] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:13:30] but yield yourself unto God as those
[1:13:32] that are
[1:13:34] alive from the
[1:13:36] dead those that are alive from the dead
[1:13:40] right and your members as instruments of
[1:13:43] righteousness unto God for sin shall not
[1:13:46] have dominion over
[1:13:48] you do you believe that say that with me
[1:13:51] those of you that are awake for sin
[1:13:53] shall not have dominion over you for ye
[1:13:57] are not under the law but under grace
[1:14:00] cuz by law you commit them things I told
[1:14:04] you I'm not going to say it but it thin
[1:14:06] a crowd
[1:14:07] out it really would it thin a crowd out
[1:14:10] you all that I mean that wasn't all of
[1:14:11] it there was a lot of other things in
[1:14:13] there that I could have brought in
[1:14:14] different things you do and you just
[1:14:15] died you know but thank God for Grace
[1:14:19] What then shall we sin because we are
[1:14:21] not under the law but under grace God
[1:14:23] forbid in other words Paul said we're
[1:14:25] not under the law as far as that death
[1:14:26] is but he said now wait a minute you
[1:14:28] can't just do what you want to over here
[1:14:31] all
[1:14:32] right God forbid know you not that to
[1:14:34] whom you yield yourself servant to obey
[1:14:37] his servant you are to whom you obey
[1:14:40] that's right whether of sin unto death
[1:14:43] or of obedience unto
[1:14:45] righteousness Romans 6 verse 21 for what
[1:14:49] fruit had you then in those things
[1:14:51] wherein you are now ashamed for the end
[1:14:54] of those things
[1:14:55] is
[1:14:56] death all
[1:14:58] right but now being made free from
[1:15:02] sin and become servants to
[1:15:04] God you have your fruit unto Holiness
[1:15:07] and the end everlasting life for the
[1:15:10] wages of sin is what death but the gift
[1:15:13] of God is eternal life through Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ Our Lord now what did Brother
[1:15:17] Bram say sin
[1:15:19] was unbelief right there not smoking
[1:15:23] drinking it's not even false Doctrine
[1:15:25] that's it's not believ in the true
[1:15:29] Doctrine sin equals unbelief now watch
[1:15:31] now here we go death by death and we'll
[1:15:33] be finished right
[1:15:36] here because in that th tyan age God
[1:15:38] said I'm going to kill
[1:15:40] them with
[1:15:42] death death for
[1:15:45] death kind of
[1:15:47] unusual and I will kill her children now
[1:15:50] remember what we were just talking about
[1:15:52] all those scriptures there was an actual
[1:15:54] real
[1:15:55] death right where your your your soul
[1:15:58] went out of your body your body went
[1:16:00] into the ground uh you died all right
[1:16:04] then there was a part over here that you
[1:16:05] were dead while you were living in other
[1:16:07] words you were breathing living human
[1:16:08] being but you were dead inside and then
[1:16:11] there's a group over here that if you're
[1:16:12] dead in
[1:16:13] Christ hello somebody if you're dead in
[1:16:16] Christ you have eternal life that's
[1:16:19] right all right so you got your three
[1:16:21] now but now watch what he's going to do
[1:16:23] and I will kill her children
[1:16:25] with death whose children the horse
[1:16:27] children the harlots and all the
[1:16:29] churches shall know that I am he which
[1:16:31] searches the Reigns and hearts and I
[1:16:33] will give unto every one of you
[1:16:34] according to your Works Romans 7:4 says
[1:16:38] wherefore my brethren you also are
[1:16:39] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:16:43] Christ so remember Grace Grace is
[1:16:46] abounding now right that you should be
[1:16:49] married to another even to him who is
[1:16:51] raised from the dead in other words your
[1:16:54] first husband the Dead all right that
[1:16:56] you should be married to another who
[1:16:58] Christ even to him who is raised from
[1:17:00] the dead that we should bring forth
[1:17:01] fruit unto God for when we were in the
[1:17:04] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[1:17:08] the
[1:17:09] law do and don'ts by the
[1:17:12] law did work in our members members to
[1:17:15] bring forth fruit unto this kind of
[1:17:17] death which was death while you're still
[1:17:20] alive everybody with me all right I'll
[1:17:23] be just a minute then we'll take
[1:17:24] communion
[1:17:25] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:17:28] not doing away from doing away with it
[1:17:30] am all right but magnifying it making it
[1:17:34] where you can live it because it's got
[1:17:36] Grace on it all
[1:17:40] right but now we are delivered from the
[1:17:42] law that being dead wherein we were
[1:17:46] held that we should serve in newness of
[1:17:48] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:17:50] letter all right what shall we say then
[1:17:53] here's the great summation
[1:17:55] is the law sin God
[1:17:58] forbid nay I had not known sin but by
[1:18:01] the
[1:18:03] law just like we were talking about last
[1:18:05] night the age of
[1:18:07] accountability you say when is that age
[1:18:09] of
[1:18:10] accountability when
[1:18:12] you we can't judge it you kids you all
[1:18:15] you got to know when you come to the age
[1:18:17] of
[1:18:19] accountability cuz remember the age of
[1:18:22] accountability is knowing right from
[1:18:23] wrong and having a conscious about it
[1:18:26] that's right as I said before like
[1:18:28] little little Khloe back there Khloe's
[1:18:31] only you know four years old or so or
[1:18:33] five six oh my word six years old she
[1:18:36] getting there but if she steals a cookie
[1:18:39] and lies and tells Mama that she didn't
[1:18:42] steal
[1:18:43] it she's
[1:18:45] covered cuz she don't have a conscience
[1:18:47] of that but she is getting too a
[1:18:49] conscious of that though that something
[1:18:52] inside of her is going if I don't tell
[1:18:54] this lie I'm going to get with it
[1:18:57] right but now that's not the age of
[1:18:59] accountability the age of accountability
[1:19:00] is when you get to your age of 12 13 14
[1:19:03] 15 years old when you really know that
[1:19:06] you shouldn't do
[1:19:08] that that you should not do that and you
[1:19:10] should not say those words and you
[1:19:11] should not do the look at the things you
[1:19:13] look at you should not go to the places
[1:19:15] you
[1:19:17] amen that's when your conscience Comes
[1:19:21] Alive N I had not known sin but by the
[1:19:24] law for I had not known lust except the
[1:19:27] law had said Thou shalt not covet now
[1:19:29] this is Paul but sin taken occasion by
[1:19:32] the Commandment wrought in me all manner
[1:19:35] of concubines which is different things
[1:19:39] for without the law sin was
[1:19:41] dead in other words if there was no law
[1:19:44] back there in in um Moses's time think
[1:19:48] what would have
[1:19:49] happened they would have been
[1:19:51] disorganized they would have they would
[1:19:53] Tor you know they' let anybody in the
[1:19:54] temple they let they let people commit
[1:19:56] adultery let let they just be killing
[1:19:58] each other and there'd be no law right
[1:20:01] but there was a law given because there
[1:20:04] was not Grace yet through Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] you understand what I mean there was
[1:20:08] Grace but there was not grace through
[1:20:09] Jesus Christ cuz he had not come yet but
[1:20:13] sin taken occasion by the Commandment
[1:20:16] wrought in me all manner of concubines
[1:20:18] for without the law sin was dead for I
[1:20:20] was alive without the law once but when
[1:20:24] the command commment came sin revived
[1:20:27] and I died now Paul
[1:20:31] didn't
[1:20:32] right different kind of death and the
[1:20:35] Commandment which was ordained to life I
[1:20:38] found it to be
[1:20:39] death doing the wrong thing not death
[1:20:43] but death
[1:20:46] here listen folks when Paul was
[1:20:48] persecuting those Christians he was dead
[1:20:49] in his
[1:20:51] soul you can't tell me there was eternal
[1:20:53] life in Paul's soul and him persecuting
[1:20:55] those
[1:20:56] Christians no he was evil he said he was
[1:21:01] evil he said he did those things it
[1:21:04] wasn't a commentation from somebody else
[1:21:06] or thirdhand information he wrote in the
[1:21:09] Bible and told us that he was that
[1:21:11] way Romans 713 says was then that which
[1:21:15] is good made death unto me God forbid
[1:21:19] but sin that it may appear sin worketh
[1:21:22] death in me what death not
[1:21:27] dying but worketh death in Me by that
[1:21:30] which is good watch that sin by the
[1:21:34] Commandment might become exceeding
[1:21:38] sinful in other words you're going to
[1:21:40] die you're going to die the death if you
[1:21:42] sin that way all right Romans 8 verse5
[1:21:45] watch this for they that are after The
[1:21:47] Flesh do mind of things of the flesh but
[1:21:49] they that are after the spirit the
[1:21:50] things of the spirit for to be carnally
[1:21:52] minded is death what kind of death
[1:21:57] not in here
[1:22:00] yes so what's God telling us when he's
[1:22:02] going to kill them with death by
[1:22:10] death he's going to let death reign in
[1:22:12] their
[1:22:13] members and then what she's going to do
[1:22:15] is he's going to kill them for being
[1:22:20] dead death by death for I will kill them
[1:22:26] with death he's going to let death reign
[1:22:28] in their members but he's going to give
[1:22:30] them a time to repent but he knows
[1:22:32] they're not going to come on now he
[1:22:34] knows they're not going to he gives them
[1:22:36] a
[1:22:38] time but the death that they have is
[1:22:41] what's going to kill him he's going
[1:22:42] they're going to come to the Judgment
[1:22:43] with that death inside and God's going
[1:22:46] to kill them because remember we'll read
[1:22:48] it in just a minute we'll talk about it
[1:22:49] watch hang on minute just real quick for
[1:22:51] to be carnally minded is death but to be
[1:22:53] spiritually minded is life and
[1:22:56] peace 1 Corinthians 15:21 for Since By
[1:22:59] Man Came Death Adam but my by man came
[1:23:02] also the resurrection of the Dead Jesus
[1:23:04] Christ for as in Adam all die even so in
[1:23:08] Christ shall all be made alive while
[1:23:10] you're
[1:23:11] living alive alive James 1:15 then when
[1:23:15] lust hath conceived it bringeth forth
[1:23:19] sin and sin when it is
[1:23:23] finished bringing forth
[1:23:26] death not this
[1:23:28] death but the death in
[1:23:32] here Revelations
[1:23:35] 2:1 he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:23:37] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:23:39] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[1:23:42] the second
[1:23:44] death he that overcometh shall not be
[1:23:47] hurt of the second death what is the
[1:23:49] second
[1:23:52] death Revelations 20:6 says blessed and
[1:23:55] holy is he that hath parted in the first
[1:23:56] resurrection on such the second death
[1:24:00] hath no power but they shall be priest
[1:24:02] of God and of Christ and shall reign
[1:24:04] with him a thousand
[1:24:06] years Revelations
[1:24:09] 2014 death and hell were cast into the
[1:24:12] Lake of Fire this is the second
[1:24:17] death I thank God that the Holy Fire of
[1:24:21] God has burned us out yes
[1:24:25] we've been to the lake
[1:24:26] fire the fire of God not that fire but
[1:24:30] remember tongues of what fell on them on
[1:24:32] day of Pentecost Tong of
[1:24:37] fire death and hell were cast into the
[1:24:39] Lake of Fire this is the second death
[1:24:42] and
[1:24:43] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:24:45] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:24:49] Fire that's the second death we as a
[1:24:53] Christian we
[1:24:56] die and then we don't die
[1:24:59] anymore we fall asleep we read that last
[1:25:02] night in Thessalonians it talks about
[1:25:04] being asleep talks about Steven falling
[1:25:06] to sleep and brother R said a Christian
[1:25:09] can't
[1:25:10] die we fall
[1:25:13] asleep this thing
[1:25:15] dies but remember this has no Dominion
[1:25:18] if this thing inside is the is the Holy
[1:25:20] Ghost yes sir cuz this inside of me is
[1:25:24] what's going to bring me up Amen in this
[1:25:27] that was corruptible that's
[1:25:30] right oh praise God what a mighty God we
[1:25:33] serve somebody used to say that what a
[1:25:36] mighty God we
[1:25:37] serve that we look and see that God's
[1:25:40] going to kill literally kill people by
[1:25:42] their own
[1:25:44] death but when we die to
[1:25:46] ourself we're alive in Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ listen we die to
[1:25:52] live yes we die to live Jesus Christ
[1:25:58] lived to die so that we can die to
[1:26:02] live if we die
[1:26:04] here not there because the second death
[1:26:08] you go into the Lake of Fire you're
[1:26:11] done that's Pastor that's white Throne
[1:26:14] judgment you don't go n that you're
[1:26:16] done why because you died here and
[1:26:20] stayed dead listen we're all dead huh
[1:26:24] we're all dead while we're
[1:26:27] living but when we will put our faith in
[1:26:30] who died and Calvary so that we can live
[1:26:34] we walk now in newness of life and we're
[1:26:37] more alive now than we ever have
[1:26:40] been you say oh brother Tatum's in the
[1:26:42] grave no his his shell is but he's not
[1:26:46] that's
[1:26:48] right sometimes we don't understand that
[1:26:52] we get it wrong just like what we said
[1:26:53] just now now the Bible says
[1:26:56] that just have a have a party at the
[1:26:59] death of a saint but cry when a baby's
[1:27:01] born we just do it totally
[1:27:03] backwards pretty little baby bless his
[1:27:05] heart well it's dead it's dead while
[1:27:08] it's alive but praise God they get
[1:27:11] eternal life if they come to if they
[1:27:13] don't come to the age accountability we
[1:27:14] understand that all right that's by the
[1:27:16] grace of God Amen but when they come to
[1:27:18] the age of accountability if they don't
[1:27:19] give their life life to God that death
[1:27:22] that's inside of them God's going to
[1:27:23] kill them with that death and that's
[1:27:25] what he did in that third in that fourth
[1:27:27] Church age he killed them by the very
[1:27:29] death that he let them go through listen
[1:27:32] he lets every one of us go through that
[1:27:35] we're all
[1:27:37] dead if you never come to the knowledge
[1:27:40] of the truth there's no sacrifice for
[1:27:42] that you're
[1:27:43] dead and if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:27:46] there's no life for you anyway let's
[1:27:49] stand to our
[1:27:50] feet he kills them
[1:27:54] by death and when God kills
[1:27:58] you be
[1:28:00] careful but when the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:28:02] burns that out of you kills the old
[1:28:05] man that's a lot
[1:28:08] different love the Lord God's good isn't
[1:28:12] he to give us a
[1:28:14] revelation of what's going to happen and
[1:28:17] how we
[1:28:19] die you look in the Bible that ain't
[1:28:21] even that's not even just I think 490
[1:28:23] something times it talks talks about
[1:28:24] death I didn't even look up dying died
[1:28:26] and dead I just look up death it was 490
[1:28:29] something times death's all in the Bible
[1:28:31] but if you'll get over here on this side
[1:28:33] of death get this death the death of
[1:28:38] self then you'll be alive in Christ you
[1:28:41] stay over
[1:28:42] here and you stay over here you're dead
[1:28:45] while you're living and God will
[1:28:48] actually kill you by the death that's
[1:28:50] inside of
[1:28:52] you cuz remember who killed kill a soul
[1:28:54] only one person can kill a soul right
[1:28:56] who is that the
[1:28:59] Lord and that's what's going to
[1:29:02] happen is we're going to be killed by
[1:29:05] death can you pull the scripture up or I
[1:29:07] or I can read it but if you pull it up
[1:29:09] we can all read
[1:29:10] it he love the Lord thank God for the
[1:29:14] word thank God for what he's give
[1:29:16] us and you know what I thank God for
[1:29:19] what he's going to give
[1:29:20] us cuz we're sitting here right here in
[1:29:25] just in
[1:29:27] the moment of time when Anything Can
[1:29:31] Happen 6 months from now this PL this
[1:29:33] thing could collapse and we' have
[1:29:35] nothing be
[1:29:37] nothing or we can go on a little while
[1:29:40] that's for the Lord to decide but you
[1:29:41] know what you and I better get ready for
[1:29:44] that
[1:29:45] moment get ready now CU remember the
[1:29:50] bride went in and got married the other
[1:29:55] ones went somewhere else they were too
[1:29:59] late even though they were virgins even
[1:30:01] though they're going to be given eternal
[1:30:03] life they're going to have to go through
[1:30:04] the tribulation
[1:30:06] period whatever you do don't
[1:30:09] don't don't don't go through the
[1:30:11] tribulation
[1:30:13] period let's
[1:30:16] read for I have received of the Lord
[1:30:18] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:30:20] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:30:21] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:30:24] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:30:25] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:30:27] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:30:30] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:30:33] the cup and when he had s saying this
[1:30:34] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:30:37] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:30:38] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:30:40] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:30:42] show the Lord this death till he
[1:30:45] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:30:48] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:30:50] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:30:54] in Blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:30:56] examine himself that's what we do every
[1:30:58] month when we take communion we examine
[1:31:01] oursel and we we let we let our um we go
[1:31:05] back into our hard
[1:31:06] drive and we see all the things that
[1:31:08] we've done some of the things that we
[1:31:10] needed to take care of some of the
[1:31:12] things we already took care
[1:31:14] of but you only know that yourself you
[1:31:17] you have your own hard drive we can't
[1:31:19] get into yours and you can't get into
[1:31:20] ours but God can
[1:31:24] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:31:25] unworthily eateth drinketh Damnation to
[1:31:27] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:31:30] for this caused many are weak and sickly
[1:31:31] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:31:34] judge ourselves that's what we talking
[1:31:36] about this morning we should not be
[1:31:38] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:31:40] chasen to the Lord what we read the
[1:31:41] scripture we read the Bible that we
[1:31:44] should not be condemned with the world
[1:31:46] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:31:48] together to eat t one for another and if
[1:31:50] a man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:31:52] you come not together under condemnation
[1:31:54] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:31:56] come the Corinthians were making a great
[1:31:58] big Feast out of it they were getting
[1:31:59] drunk they were eating they were making
[1:32:01] a mess out of it and calling it The
[1:32:03] Lord's table and Paul had to come in and
[1:32:05] say hold on a minute this is what the
[1:32:08] Lord did when he was in the upper room
[1:32:10] so this is what you need to do all right
[1:32:13] so let's have a moment of Silent
[1:32:16] prayer praying for each
[1:32:18] other getting our sin out of the
[1:32:21] way and being able to take Comm
[1:32:26] Union with a contrite
[1:32:39] heart help us Lord through this
[1:32:42] furtherment of the service Lord and help
[1:32:43] us as we continue on in life and Lord as
[1:32:46] we come together Lord each time lord may
[1:32:48] we remember you father not even the days
[1:32:50] that we take communion but let us
[1:32:52] remember you Lord that you died for for
[1:32:54] us you died so that we could live you
[1:32:57] died a death that there was no breath in
[1:32:59] your body so that you could live because
[1:33:02] you were the soul of God you couldn't
[1:33:04] die Lord you raised from the dead with
[1:33:08] that same soul and then on the day of
[1:33:10] Pentecost you poured it back into your
[1:33:12] people and Lord we stand here today to
[1:33:14] do the ordinances that you've commanded
[1:33:16] us to do the water baptism the the
[1:33:19] communion and the foot wash and
[1:33:20] different things that you commanded us
[1:33:22] to do Lord that keeps the worshiper
[1:33:24] clean and keeps the church running Lord
[1:33:26] and functioning father I pray that you'd
[1:33:27] bless each one sanctify us for the
[1:33:29] journey that we're on Lord and the one
[1:33:31] that we're continuing forgive us of our
[1:33:33] sins Lord and give us Grace father for
[1:33:36] the things that we that we are not doing
[1:33:38] right Lord that that are wrong in your
[1:33:40] eyes Lord just Lord forgive us Lord for
[1:33:44] being humans and help us Lord and teach
[1:33:46] us to do the right thing father we love
[1:33:49] you and we thank you in Jesus name amen

[1:34:13] were beat like as the prophet said
[1:34:14] hamburger meat but you did it all for us
[1:34:16] Lord but just a few days later you came
[1:34:18] out of that grave Lord and you were not
[1:34:20] broken anymore but you did still show
[1:34:22] the scars but those scars are for us

[1:34:27] can go to to Glory father in the
[1:34:29] glorified body that's not scarred Lord I

[1:34:59] Lord I like that song by Casting Crowns

[1:36:33] and visit us father just bless us now in
[1:36:35] the furtherment of this service in Jesus
[1:36:37] name
[1:36:42] amen come
[1:36:45] morning I
[1:36:47] walk by the
[1:36:50] river I'll rest Neath the Ever Green
[1:36:58] Tree I'll
[1:37:00] carry my
[1:37:02] cross through the
[1:37:06] midnight come
[1:37:08] morning there's
[1:37:11] glory for
[1:37:14] me sometimes I
[1:37:18] despised and
[1:37:21] rejected and I
[1:37:24] question oh
[1:37:26] Father how
[1:37:30] long but I take one more
[1:37:34] look at Mount
[1:37:38] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:37:43] go
[1:37:45] on come
[1:37:47] morning I'll
[1:37:49] walk by the river
[1:37:54] I'll rest neath the Ever Green
[1:38:01] Tree I'll
[1:38:04] carry my cross through the
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:09] midnight come
[1:38:12] morning there's
[1:38:14] glory for me if you feel
[1:38:18] bad sometimes I'm
[1:38:21] despised and re
[1:38:24] the world hates us and I question oh
[1:38:29] Father how
[1:38:33] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:38:41] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:38:46] go
[1:38:48] on I would say that the the martyrs
[1:38:51] during this church age they gave their
[1:38:54] physical life because they'd already
[1:38:56] been born again so they they knew that
[1:38:58] they were protected of the second death
[1:39:00] but I wonder what they
[1:39:02] saying I don't believe they were sad if
[1:39:05] if the Bible tells us that they got
[1:39:08] stronger as they got thrown into the
[1:39:10] liones den their faith got stronger I
[1:39:13] believe they sang a little louder they
[1:39:15] might have had an a few apprehension or
[1:39:17] a few times that they were at first that
[1:39:21] when they started putting them in prison
[1:39:23] and and then they sentenced them to
[1:39:25] death that there was a little
[1:39:27] apprehension but but I believe somebody
[1:39:29] stood up and preached him a sermon and
[1:39:31] said hey this is what we're called to
[1:39:34] just like I'm telling you today this is
[1:39:36] this is what we're called to we're
[1:39:39] called to come to adoption and then to a
[1:39:41] change of a body get the dead out of the
[1:39:43] ground and then take a body change and
[1:39:47] then as the Bible says we can just meet
[1:39:49] together and we'll go up to meet the
[1:39:51] Lord in the air we'll just move into
[1:39:53] another dimmension a faster
[1:39:56] Dimension and we will uh have
[1:40:00] fun while the world goes through a Great
[1:40:09] Tribulation does that make it clear
[1:40:11] where he says I'll kill him with death
[1:40:13] I'll kill him with
[1:40:15] death absolutely he told us exactly what
[1:40:17] he was going to do but what what the
[1:40:20] whole thing is was he let them do it
[1:40:24] because of the death that they took on
[1:40:26] false Doctrine he let them die he gave
[1:40:29] them a chance to repent you read the
[1:40:31] Bible I gave him a chance but they
[1:40:32] didn't so I'm must I'm going to you know
[1:40:34] God's a good God but God's a god he's a
[1:40:36] just God you turn him down you die just
[1:40:40] the way it is let's take
[1:40:57] okay okay while they're taking up the
[1:41:01] uh
[1:41:04] um rest of the communion bow sister Anna
[1:41:08] Mara wants to come get a prayer cloth
[1:41:11] and uh we'll pray over that while
[1:41:15] uh while they're taking up the communion
[1:41:20] cups dear heavenly father our sister we
[1:41:23] don't have to explain what it this
[1:41:26] prayer cloth is Lord she doesn't have to
[1:41:28] even tell us what it's for Lord
[1:41:30] but it will
[1:41:32] accomplish by the faith that we have it
[1:41:36] will accomplish what it said in the
[1:41:37] Bible that many of the claws from Paul
[1:41:39] were laid on people and and many
[1:41:41] healings were wrought demons were cast
[1:41:43] out and the different things Lord I pray
[1:41:46] that when this cloth is laid wherever it
[1:41:47] needs to be laid Lord that it'll do
[1:41:49] exactly what our sister said it would do
[1:41:51] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:41:55] you know the Bible tells us whoever sins
[1:41:58] you retain they retain whoever sins you
[1:42:00] remit they're remitted do do you believe
[1:42:03] that when Steven was dying when Steven
[1:42:06] was getting ready to fall
[1:42:08] asleep Paul was standing just a few feet
[1:42:11] away he didn't pick the stones up but he
[1:42:14] held the coats and the and he says I
[1:42:17] consented in other words I didn't say
[1:42:19] now come on guys we don't need to do
[1:42:20] this this is a nice guy no he consented
[1:42:22] he had a little fire in his belly said
[1:42:24] all well we get rid of that one ah come
[1:42:27] on he was right there consented to the
[1:42:30] death holding the
[1:42:32] coats Steven looks up into heaven and he
[1:42:35] says
[1:42:36] father forgive
[1:42:39] them that was for Paul all those other
[1:42:42] ones I don't know if it was or not but
[1:42:45] it was for Paul whatever sins you retain
[1:42:47] they retain whatever ones you remit they
[1:42:49] remit he released Paul you say oh that
[1:42:52] was just Steven that Steven was
[1:42:56] Christ at that moment he was portraying
[1:42:58] Christ to the people one of the first
[1:43:01] Martyrs that that was a believer that
[1:43:03] was a a born again
[1:43:05] believer and he meant it from his heart
[1:43:09] he said father don't hold that against
[1:43:12] them that was for Paul and you know what
[1:43:15] I believe old Saul later on in his life
[1:43:18] he probably heard that same word
[1:43:21] again and it by re ation he said
[1:43:25] wow that was for
[1:43:29] me that was for me when Jesus Christ
[1:43:33] said forgive them Father they don't know
[1:43:34] what they're doing that was for
[1:43:37] me that was for
[1:43:39] me in my sin in the first part of our
[1:43:42] Lives all of us we sinned fell short of
[1:43:44] the glory of the Lord Paul said he
[1:43:47] did but when we realize it though we
[1:43:50] look back and we can see as you see
[1:43:53] Steven that life had to come through the
[1:43:55] body and that forgiveness not only comes
[1:43:58] through Jesus Christ it comes through
[1:44:00] you and me who ever sends you remit
[1:44:02] remit whoever remain there remain or
[1:44:05] remit one of the two they asked brother
[1:44:06] BR said brother BR you you told them
[1:44:08] people their sins were forgiven talking
[1:44:10] about marriage and divorce he
[1:44:12] said not too far from being
[1:44:16] God the Bible says that we can forgive
[1:44:19] them
[1:44:21] amen I mean he was just reading the
[1:44:23] Bible he wasn't trying to be a great
[1:44:25] prophet outside the Bible you could just
[1:44:26] turn the Bible over and said hey man
[1:44:28] right here's where it says whoever sins
[1:44:30] you remit they remit whoever say you
[1:44:32] retain they're retained or remit one of
[1:44:34] the two it's up to you you see how
[1:44:36] important we
[1:44:38] are not to pass judgment so fast on
[1:44:41] people let's read the scripture for the
[1:44:44] for the uh foot

[1:44:53] having now put in the heart of Judas his
[1:44:54] car at Simon son to betray him Jesus
[1:44:57] knowing that the father had given all
[1:44:58] things into his hand and that he was
[1:44:59] come from God and he went to God he
[1:45:01] rises from supper and laid aside His
[1:45:03] Garment took a towel and GED himself and
[1:45:06] after that he poured water in a basin
[1:45:07] and began to wash the disciples feet I
[1:45:10] don't know about your sisters downstairs
[1:45:11] but upstairs when I hear that water
[1:45:13] going into that Basin it takes me back

[1:45:27] after that he pth water into a basin and
[1:45:29] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:45:31] WIP them with the towel who withth he
[1:45:32] was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter
[1:45:35] and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou
[1:45:37] wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I
[1:45:39] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:45:42] know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou
[1:45:44] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:45:46] and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no
[1:45:48] part with me Simon Peter said unto him
[1:45:51] Lord not my feet only but also my hands
[1:45:53] and my head Jesus said unto him he that
[1:45:55] is washed Heth not saved to be washed
[1:45:57] but is clean every with and you are
[1:45:59] clean but not all he knew Judas was
[1:46:01] there for he knew who should betray him
[1:46:03] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[1:46:06] so after that he washed their feet had
[1:46:08] taken His Garment was sat down again he
[1:46:10] said unto them know you what I've done
[1:46:12] to you you call me master and Lord and

[1:46:21] don't he should worship God but when he
[1:46:23] comes here to the end of his life when
[1:46:25] he comes here to where he knows that he
[1:46:27] don't just have few hours to live he
[1:46:29] said now if I then your Lord and Master
[1:46:33] have washed your feet you ought to also
[1:46:34] wash one another's feet for I've given
[1:46:36] you an example that you should do as I
[1:46:37] have done to you he said you call me

[1:46:41] I am so he was telling them identifying
[1:46:43] him before he was leaving that he was
[1:46:44] their Master he was their Lord but if I
[1:46:46] your master should wash your feet you
[1:46:48] should wash each other's feet the
[1:46:51] servant is not greater than his Lord
