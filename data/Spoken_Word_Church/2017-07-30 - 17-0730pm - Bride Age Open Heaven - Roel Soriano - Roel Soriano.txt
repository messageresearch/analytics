that uh that blessed you and uh Lord willing we're going to ad Minister again tonight uh from the message of the hour I just love the word of God Amen and uh uh I just uh I will formally invite brother uh way Dale I actually invited him last year but I don't know what what his excuse was but he I could interpret what you were saying at first he was saying he didn't get my email and then he

also waiting for you am amen amen I'm just so so glad to be a part of this L connected to the assembly and thank you brother Dale for the confidence sir and uh thank you for being patient with me because I've I've always thought you know what can a Filipino tell the Americans who you know the message came from here that's all right and I don't even I can't even speak the the language right but I believe God will help me amen but thank you for your patience uh uh tonight I'm going to show a uh another aspect of our ministry in the Philippines and uh it's about the demolition of the message Community a whole message community in Antipolo resel in the Philippines 60 families are now without a home and struggling to survive on a daily basis because they were demolished first slide please this is the church I'm talking about back in 19 uh I think 1996 is was when I led the whole group to the Lord you know we do Expo seminars which is uh nothing but uh message presentation seminars to denominational ministers and uh I met the former pastor of this church and so he set up a Mr Expo seminar for me uh he invited all his ministers uh because he start he started a uh mobile Bible school it's Bible school on Wheels they go from place to place and train the uh ministers and so they uh he invited them over to attend the seminar and at the end of the three-day seminar they all saw the light of the message and decided to be baptized as a whole congregation 87 people thank the Lord for that right and uh this is a very vibrant Church you know they have many outreaches different part of our country and uh they have now been all been um uh influenced by the message a lot of them have come to the message because of their Witness that's me the next next slide that's me preaching to the congregation there uh 87 Believers were baptized in the name of the Lord as they saw the light of the message that I presented to them next slide but in March March 1 this year this thing happened the whole church was demolished along with 60 houses of people that live in the community it's a property um uh of about uh 14 acres and all every single house in that Community was demolished it is a case of a um land dispute it's between uh uh Bene beneficiary tenants of Our Land Reform program and Rich business you know in in a country like ours Rich business they have the power and the the brothers and sister they lost the case and the property was awarded to somebody that they don't even know they don't they haven't even seen this person but it was awarded to them by the judge so armed with a court order they start demolishing the church and instead in in spite of our pleadings you know they still went ahead and demolished the church next now this was what what left of the beautiful Church you know we helped that church a lot we uh drilled the well and made a uh water supply system for the whole Community but we can't have access access the people can't have access to that um as well the water supply see this is a case of poor farmer beneficiaries of land reform program versus Rich business next it was a whole day of Destruction it was a probably three dozens of people men uh which were the which was the demolition staff and they did it illegally uh there was a private Army not 50 yards away from the demolition side and it's illegal in our country to do that they were not given enough notice they were not even offered uh resettlement or even given any Financial assist assistant from the mayor's office no they they just uh destroy their homes next not a single house was spared next now this child wonders why people tore up their house and she said this they destroyed my my bedroom and in our bathroom and now I don't even know how I can take a bath yeah next Believers sto as scattered all over the place can you imagine 60 families uh they say what what are we going to do with our lives now next uh this was the day after the demolition I came there and met with the people and asked them you know what they feel what they but they want to do of course they want to keep on serving the lord we're never discouraged but how can we do it we don't have a church now so we we talked together and came up with a plan next this is Brother Jose Cano is's an evangelist and we started uh having Services Sunday afternoon out on the street and this was one of the services and it said when we first moved in 37 years ago in uh we had the hardest time um hard for me to be the text there okay he said often we had to sck Kon Roots that's Grassroots a saon uh to ease hunger pains while we wait for our first harvest of sweet potatoes other times we had to eat wild berries from The Lone Tree in the land I mean they had a hard time sure 37 years they till the land and planted all the trees there next and now they lost everything Sister Lisa here is one of the used to be a woman preacher by the way yeah you know I love women preachers because there are good women preachers once they find out they can't preach they [Laughter] stop so Sister Lisa testified that they planted every tree on on the 14 acre track of land we were the first settlers on this Wasteland she said which was later named Sito charismatic think about it the the village was named after the group their charismatic situ charismatic in reference to Believers known as charismatics next see the church equipment D dumped out on the street you you see the barb wire and they put the sign up no trespassing next so it was this was what was left the the believer's house 30 believing families now live in cramped spaces in near by Villages others were forced to pay high rent or move far from their jobs and schools to make ends meet next we started holding Services out on the street to manifest our indignation of the illegally illegally implemented demolition you see we were having service right on the street amen that's a tricle right there next it's illegal to demolish houses without relocation or financial assistance given to the affected families that's why we protested out on the street right next and Believers from different local assemblies plock to the streets to support the meetings because of the street services that we did we caught the attention of media some government and non-government agencies who are now helping the displaced families praise the Lord for that amen amen next yeah so the Bible says Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that that weep and be of the same mind one toward another amen mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate and be not wise in your own conceits this was the very reason that we cancelled our anniversary me meeting not because by the way didn't show up but you know uh there's no point in celebrating well this thing happened to 60 families and so I want you to just uh pray that uh the brothers and sisters can rebuild their homes especially their their church so uh they can continue on serving the lord amen and to be a witness to this uh Community am God bless you [Applause] amen and now we go to the word amen I'm going to preach on open heaven we can actually look heaven in the face how many believes that yes sir amen because of the message of the hour amen Heaven has opened widely right Amen to us and we can actually look heaven in the PA that's all stand read the word of God Hosea chapter 2:1 16 and it shall be at that day sayith the Lord Lord that thou shalt call me isi that's right and shall call me no more B Amen in case you don't understand what isi means it means husband that's right and Bali means Lord amen you know Lord to Servant relationship is a good relationship yeah but it wasn't good enough for God you know that's why in John 15:15 he said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all the things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you right yes revealed himself completely to us no secrets between us and the Lord is trying to elevate our relationship with him into a more intimate one sir amen that's right that's between a a bridegroom and a bride right Hallelujah we are living in the Fulfillment of this prophecy glory amen before I let you sit down let me quote the prophet modern events made clear by prophecy he said we are not living in a Pentecostal age we are living in another age you see we're not living in a Methodist age right we are living in in another age we're living up here to the bright age amen the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture amen you believe that amen I believe that absolutely and that's the age that we're living in butam said to my honest opinion that's exactly amen the truth amen let us pray Heavenly Father help us once again Lord open our understanding open the windows of Heaven Lord and pour us out a blessings such as we are not able to contain this afternoon just meet every need let's represented in this congregation and bless our souls we pray in Jesus name amen may be seated next slide please Heaven open to John amen Revelation 4:1 says after this I looked and behold what happened the door a door was open in heaven amen and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter this was right before the opening of the seals right what happened there was a door open came open in heaven amen hallelujah next slide please we all know John types the believer who will be summoned absolutely or called up right Better B him quotes the same scripture Revelation 4:1 he said after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be Hereafter amen now how many times did we hear Brother bam say come up higher right it's actually come up hether but the way the prophets were saying is come up higher am means come from the place where we're setting in to a higher Place Hallelujah he said caught up in the vision Believers are caught up in the vision amen like John was caught up in his vision he said he was caught up into what into Glory we find then that John was the type of every True Believer that will be summoned by Christ Christ on high amen right I believe that by my heart that's right sumon come up higher amen right hallelujah amen exactly the message clarifies the concept of heaven but said chrisis is revealed in our in his own word you're going to find find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you are still right here amen two just in another dimension faster than this Hallelujah you believe that hallelujah amen right amen only in this message have I heard this right I've never heard it from anywhere else no Theologian has ever said this amen that heaven is right here amen right it's just another dimension and the elements there move a lot faster than the than we do here amen in this world Hallelujah and and B says Heaven consists of the world of the word amen yes sir If Heaven is open to us what is in heaven right amen Heaven consists of the word yes sir amen as I said if God speaks and sends you did he send you amen right he backs out what you say whatever you say he backs it up see notice if you're an ambassador from heaven and I believe we all are we came from Heaven we're going back to heaven in the meantime we're representing heaven on Earth right and if you're ambassadors from Heaven All Heaven is behind you right right amen and Heaven is consisted of the word meaning it's made up of the word am Heaven is full of the word amen hallelujah Matthew 5 verse 18 says for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or title shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled and then he said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will never pass away this is what backs us up right amen yeah the word which consists of Heaven you see brass represents judgment but says in Deuteronomy 28:23 and thy Heaven that is above over thy head shall be brass and the Earth is that under deed shall be Iron right now brass represents Divine judgment amen right and this whole world is right for the Judgment of God that's right not Earthly judgment or mental judgment but Divine judgment see the brass altar the altar where where the sacrifice was burnt was made of brass right the Brazen Altar and all means that it was divine there is word the divine price was paid at the brass right right now uh why I showed you this quote is because I believe that heaven is full of he uh Heaven is full of angels right it's full of them Matthew 18: 10 take heed that you despise one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their theophanies exactly their theophanies their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven brother calls it our representation in heaven they always behold the face of the Father in Heaven as we sit here this afternoon we have something representing Us in heaven right amen hallelujah and we didn't know about this until we heard message right why because this message opened heaven to us amen Hebrews 12:22 let me show you what we have come to when we came to the message it says but ye are come unto Mount Zion right unto the city of the Living God unto Heavenly Jerusalem right and to an innumerable company of angels we have come to that right I'd like to hear an amen amen I mean I mean we have come to an innumerable number of angels and I can't get a reaction from you praise the Lord in Second Kings we can recall that Elisha was to be kidnapped by the syrians if you remember because they had a dilemma you know they set up an ambush but the Israeli soldiers they stay away from the Ambush side and the King started suspecting that uh uh one of his generals is is for the Israel Israelites and uh you're supporting Israel but they said no we're not we're not supporting Israel we're all for you our problem is they got a prophet in Samaria before we even set up our Ambush this Prophet tells them what to do to avoid these places that's why you know they always win right so the solution was to kidnap Elisha yeah and so a battalion of soldiers Syrian soldiers came to Elisha to try to kidnap him yeah we read and Elijah uh and and they were around the uh around the mountains thousands of soldiers probably and Elijah prayed and saw and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes because gesi he saw this all the Syrian soldiers and he thought that was their end you know we die right here but but Elisha doesn't seem to be concerned he said Relax there's more that are with us than are with them Hallelujah and Gesa Lo looked around and said but Master it's just you and me here and so Elisha prayed to God to Open the Eyes of his young servant his young man and then he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha the Paradigm changed right there amen absolutely amen because uh there were more Angels chariots uh driving Chariots of Fire around them than all the Syrian soldiers amen that would want to do them harm Hallelujah and so and for instance Elijah when he went out and the skies was just brass and he s he said Divine judgment was upon the people because they went away from God in the days of Ahab and gesi went up to look and see that the skies what the skies look like and he come there and said it looks like brass see Divine judgment right isn't it amazing that God opened the eyes of gesi and he blinded the eyes of the syrians Hallelujah what am I telling you this world is right for judgment right Heaven is closed Upon This World hallelujah amen when they look upon the heavens they see judgment but we see something else amen amen we see the doors of Heaven open hallelujah hallelujah it's salvation to the bride but destruction to the people who don't know the Lord let's consider brother brandman's Ministry Angels ascending and descending upon the son of man Ministry let's take his birth you know in the in that kentaki L house where brother Bon was born an angel actually protected the mother and the child from freezing to death angel from heaven what about the first baptism in 1933 at the start of his ministry we we see that heaven opened and a great light Shone from heaven right and a voice was heard as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so are you sent to forun the second coming of Christ what about when he was commissioned by the angel the angel said you have been called to bring a gift of Divine Healing to the world Amen and it's and he said if you can be sincere and cause the people to believe in you right then nothing can stand before your prayer not even cancer right Hallelujah and then the pillar of fire was photographed in 1950 what was that angel of the Lord hallelujah what about when he was caught behind the curtain of time Hallelujah Heaven actually opened to brother brandham right as the Lord showed him his converts I believe he saw me there you saw Brother Sam there you saw all of us there Hallelujah because heaven open what about the opening of the seals right A mysterious Cloud appears and as if you look at it the appearance of it is it it as if a hole was Bor through heaven and seven angels formed the face of the son of man in the clouds over Arizona it's like a big opening in heaven Hallelujah why because heaven opened to us yes sir right hallelujah what about the death of our Elijah he was taken away by a chariot of fire right I was told that the when the car accident happened that there was a birst of fire yeah and he our Prophet was taken away by by a charot of fire which according to the Bible was driven by angels do you see Angels ascending and descending upon the ministry of the son of man Hallelujah see obedience opens Heaven Mark 1:10 and straightway coming out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him this happened during the baptism of the Lord Jesus you know John the Baptist uh was refusing to baptize the Lord Jesus yeah he said I can't baptize you you need to baptize me but the Lord said suffer it amen let us suffer it so we can fulfill God's righteousness all all of God's righteousness and because of John's obedience and the Lord's humility Heaven opened amen amen and that dove all lighted upon Him amen Matthew 3:1 15 And1 17 says and Jesus answering unto him said and said suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh or behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness and then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased right right this means judgment to the world yeah but blessings to the believer amen and brother B told about the painting in Germany that he saw in Germany said once I saw a picture and it always stuck with me a German painter has painted a a picture that's called the the cloud land and when you see it off a distance it's the horriblest looking Gloom you ever seen just clouds matted together when you're looking at it from a distance but when you get real close to it it changes right it's Angels Wings beating together singing Hallelujah to the Lord amen so that's that's what the Gloom is sometimes if you look at it at long distance it's gloomy and dark but take God at his word and be certain that he's God and move up close to it and you'll find out it's just Angel swings are beating together hallelujah amen that's why we see the headlines on the papers and we read of the news online of the big one they say uh we've always talked of the big one taking place in California but one scientist said but now we can quantify it that's the difference we can quantify it when the big one hits at least 50,000 people will be dead right away right and it said 200 billion pesos worth of Dage will be uh inflicted in California amen hallelujah so when they hear about earthquake in California people are scared to death yeah but when the Believers hear about it we look up and we know that our Redemption drove it n Hallelujah just this morning I was looking and there was a minister an Israel it uh Minister who is pushing for the rebuilding of the Third Temple right on uh the Temple Mount they wanted to rebuild the Temple Hallelujah and the people they uh they're worried about it because that it would mean more mean the Muslim people will not uh will not let it happen it would mean War some people say that could even start the Third World War nuclear war Hallelujah but but when when we hear these things happening we remember better man I'm saying it will be built it will be built this is signs of the times this is prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah amen that's right amen judgment to the unbelievers to the world but blessings to the believer am Glory well now did didn't the bible say that uh Authority was both given to the Lord in heaven and on Earth amen by opening heaven to us God is given us access to heaven after Heaven uh you can alter you can actually alter heaven I'm Sorry by altering things on earth Matthew 16:19 says I will give you unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven right amen you can alter Heaven by altering things on earth and whatsoever thou shallal lose on Earth shall be loose in heaven Matthew 28:18 says and Jesus came and spake unto them all power is given unto me both in heaven and on Earth amen hallelujah amen this kind of power is in the bride today you see Heaven opened because of Prophecy am Acts 2 verse 1-4 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing thongs like as of fire and it sat upon each one of them it's like heaven opened and these tongues of fire appeared and uh settled uh on each one of them amen and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other things as the spirit gave them utterance Hallelujah why because all powers of heaven was poured down to earth yes and the Lord even said ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you exactly Hallelujah yes you see what happened God ripped his son apart yeah brother said I said but Jesus did die and Rise Again amen he sent his Spirit back upon the church that spirit that was in him is the very same spirit in the church now and it can and it will produce what Jesus produced I believe that with all my heart he said in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself amen but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth there Al these also doeth the son likewise and then B says what was God showing what was he doing to Abraham God was showing that he was going to do by Christ was was making a covenant and God taking his own son to Calvary and he tore him apart and he took one part and set it in his right hand above which was his body and sent his Spirit back to earth right so this was what God did when Jesus Jesus died on the cross he ripped him his own son apart set his body on high but he sent his Spirit to us hallelujah and here's the same Messiah today he was then only without a Corporal body here on Earth he sent his Spirit back to use your body and my body oh my I say Amen to that yes amen hallelujah yes this is what the message did amen hallelujah and we're writing a book of Acts like I said this morning I'm saiding if that first Branch came forth that Branch out of the vine that wrote a book of Acts behind it if that Branch ever put forth a Vine put forth another branch that will write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life if one of your grape wines out there brings forth blue grapes if it puts forth another Branch it will bring forth blue grapes Hallelujah you know what kind of Life they manifested right in the book of Acts Acts chapter 2: 43 and 47 and I read and fear fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together amen and they had all things in common don't get quiet on me now and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need amen and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved amen we start doing this people will start leaving the church amen but no it didn't happen that way the Lord added to the church such what that were predestinated before the foundation of the world Hallelujah that's right acts 4:32 and 35 I'm not done yet and the multitude of them that believe were of one heart and of one Soul amen neither said any of them that thought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common amen nobody said that big house is my house that big car is my car this is my food these are my clothes this belongs to me these are my property but they had all things common right I'm telling you this is the first original communism the book of Acts is the first original communism because it's powered and enforced by the love of God not by the barrel of a gun but by the love of God hallelujah this can only happen if Heaven opens right amen if you can appreciate what is happening behind the corridors of heaven right amen this can happen here on Earth amen right right shared lives right Hallelujah and great grace was upon them oh my I've heard it said that because the message came there's no more grace oh no the message is the word amen where there is more word there must be more grace Hallelujah am that's why this morning we heard that the headstone when it came it cried Grace Grace double Grace right hallelujah amen the more word we hear the more grace we experience Hallelujah glory to God yes sir brother and great grace was upon them all neither was there anything among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of land and houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made upon every man according to their need what am I telling you my brothers and sisters am I telling you to go ahead and sell your properties now I'm not telling you to do that I'm just saying you must be ready to to do that because the squeeze is coming amen and there will come a time you won't be able to say that's my house that's my car it's for everybody right amen this is the secret to opening the flood gates of Heaven Malachi 3 amen lot of you are allergic to this scripture No many many Filipinos are allergic to this scripture Malachi 3:10 let me just read it bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house amen and prove me now here with said the Lord host if I will not open to you the windows of Heaven listen now I'm showing you how to open the windows of Heaven Hallelujah and pour you out a blessing so that there shall not be room enough to receive it right I know people that give expecting to receive you know people give their tithes because they believe in the principle that God would restore it to you a h hundredfold that's their motive well if that's your motive you better just go go in business start a business not give to the church start a business because we don't give expecting to receive from God we give to open heaven let me say that again we give to open heaven right amen amen says open the windows of Heaven God will open it and I said Lord by why windows I thought you were going to open the doors of Heaven by why windows and I looked at my house there are more windows than doors I I pour you out the blessing such that you will not be able to contain hallelujah what about Jacob's letter the promise of access to Heaven is to Abraham said listen to this and then he dreamed and behold a lad was set up on the earth and the top of it reached into heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it amen amen and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land where werein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy sin yes it was not only promised to Jacob was not promised only to Isaac not only to Abraham but to Abraham sa amen and we are the Seed of Abraham by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a ladder set up for you and Heaven has been open and angels are actually ascending and descending on this L to your life amen you see Jesus was ministered to By Angels right in the time of Temptation in Matthew chap 4:1 then the devil liveth him he tried so hard oh yeah but he just couldn't trap him right and behold the Angels Came and ministered unto him he had a hard time and the angels came and helped him strengthened him think about it reinforcement from heaven will always come every time a child of God is in trouble believe that below my heart amen when you seem tired and weary and discouraged and ready to give up angels can now easily come to the rescue because the heaven has been opened hallelujah what happened in Gethsemane Luke chapter 22 and he was withdrawn from them about the stones cast Jesus was asking for strength from his disciples and he couldn't get them he he he couldn't even get them to pray not one for one hour and then so he was withdrawn from them about the stones cast and kneeled down and prayed and saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done what an Agony amen right and Watch What Happens Next and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven and strengthened him glory to God we believe in the strengthening power of the Holy Ghost but the Angels give us that extra push when we need it I believe that with know my heart Hallelujah I believe in angels sir before coming to this message I thought Angels were part of the fairy tale Hallelujah came to find out they were true amen came to find out they are descending and ascending upon the son of man Ministry Matthew 26 53 thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my father as he was hanging on the cross and he shall presently give me more than 12 Legions of Heaven I don't know what a legion is how many thousands probably th 6 thousands 6 thousands is one Legion 6 thousands time 12 that's 12 * 6,000 Legion of angels well aren't we empowered to do the same amen hallelujah we are let me tell you we are empowered to do the same Hallelujah this is a a very nice scripture so let me show it let let me just share it with you Psalms 139 and verse 16 Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet they were none of them right meaning your body parts your personal Parts whatever it is mental parts has been written in the Book of Life in God's book even when they were still unperfect even in your imperfect State God saw them already amen and yet he chose to bless you he chose to open heaven to you amen exactly Romans 8:30 says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified Pence amen amen hallelujah amen amen John chap 1 verse 51 I'm closing now if few minutes and he said unto them to them to him verily verily I say unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man you see the premise is because you believe in the ministry of the son of man son of man is Prophet amen God being a prophet God manifesting himself as a person who who knows all things Hallelujah and this is this is what happened in this message amen you see if Heaven is open to you you will be able to see your name in the new book right this is the main difference between denominational teaching and the message teaching denominational people they preach from a close book amen and when a preacher preaches from a close book they get nothing the people get nothing Hallelujah but thank God we are preaching for an open booken amen and when the books when when when when when when the book is open then you can see your name that's the reason John actually jumped for Joy he stopped weeping and he started rejoicing because he saw his name in the book Hallelujah amen now what does it name what does it mean to see your name in the Lamb's Book now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed right all that was Redeemed by the lamb is written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate amen hallelujah where your Eternal through through Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold amen now your not only forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 said yeah Romans chap 5:1 said therefore being justified by faith amen hallelujah he said this in invisible Union right this is the legal proof of your eternal security right sir you say you're married show proof that you're married and this is your marriage certificate if you see your name in the book that's the seal that's the legal proof of your eternal security Hallelujah so the bright AIDS is the AIDS of open Heaven would the bride of Christ have would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture this was the question hallelujah oh will will we just be playing tapes Better B said sure sure we'll have a Ministry that's right oh yeah and that's what's going on right now right amen see the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour that's the ministry that's the bride AGS the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she's consistent of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry amen it's the ministry of the hour but it will be so humble amen amen that's right what is the ministry of the Bride that's right Revelations 10 says it all right the minister of rbde is take the little book Y and so John I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up now this is the brid's ministry after you see the book come open you need to take it and eat it up exactly amen you're not to argue about it and discuss differences in doctrines Hallelujah you have to eat it meaning make it a part of your life you see in your in your lips it will be so sweet oh it's it's so good to talk about the message of the hour when you talk about the message of the hour the word time just flies Hallelujah but when you start applying it in your life you'll have some bitter experiences hallelujah amen as soon as I had it eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me this is the ministry of the Bride now thou must prophesy again before many people nation and tongues and Kings this is our ministry this is what should be taking place right now you must prophesy again why did it say again because this message has already been prophesied all you have to do is to repeat it right right prophesy again amen don't add your interpretation to it amen the message don't need your opinion predestinated seed don't need to hear uh uh uh your opinion Hallelujah but you need to prophesy again amen right Hallelujah yeah to many tongues this reminds me of the time that I went to taipe in Taiwan there was this Frenchman was working at the railway in taipe and he was a message believer and uh he looked around and there was there was not one message Church in taipe and so he heard about me doing the message presentation seminar and he wrote me and said brother roel will you be willing to come and hold a Mr Expo seminar here in taipe I have a lot of Minister friends here and I can gather them together and you present the message to them I said all right you know of course I prayed first and you know I felt good about it and so I went to Taiwan to taipe and he rented a nice uh Hall in a nice hotel like a four fourstar hotel and um ordered food for about uh how many 50 50 ministers he said easily 50 ministers will show up you know uh he printed advertisement in the paper and the announce over the radio and give out LIF flets to his friends and he was expecting 50 ministers to come well right when the date came we were all ready we were all set up nobody showed up not one Minister showed up but then there was one one man his name is I can never forget it David Chang and he showed up because of the money this Frenchman promised to pay him if he would interpret my presentation in Chinese so he was the only one that showed up but I was kind of having second thoughts because there was nobody there I said brother what are we going to do should we go on with the presentation and he said brother you know I have all the the the uh recording system set up because I want to to record your presentation and I want I want it Translate ated into Chinese Mandarin and so uh let's go ahead just pretend that there are people and it was the hardest thing to do you that no nobody there so I started uh with my presentation and and Brother David Chang he interpreted for me in Mandarin by the middle of the presentation but David Chang a learned man he is a theologian he said he stopped and said brother roel wait a minute where are you getting all this he said I spent 12 years in Bible School I've never heard any of this and so he went on with the presentation but David Chang ended up accepting the message Hallelujah one soul is worth 10,000 worlds Hallelujah and this is our ministry right better Ben said you know you're always in the will of God if you go to foreign Mission I went to foreign mission to preach to [Laughter] one am but praise the Lord after that that he took me to his church and they gladly received the word amen it's a
