60 Overcomers we getting pretty full on Wednesday nights so Lord bless your heart if you got your Bibles let's turn to the book of Philippians and get started real quick and uh Lord bless each and every one of you I've got a coming up in May of course we got bible study on the first Saturday of May then we got the fellowship meeting May's going to be a pretty pretty full month we got ministers meeting the week before the fellowship meeting but the week of the fellowship meeting I'll not be here and I want you to put it on your calendar so you can pray for me because I'll be in Miami Florida on the 15th of May which starts Thursday night from Thursday till Sunday be five straight services Thursday night Friday night Saturday night and two services on Sunday to I don't know it's a they say it's a large group of Haitians that are in Miami and we're going to be doing their convention for them so just keep me in your prayers there and let the Lord be with us I hate it I miss brother Ernie but we had this scheduled sometime before so Philippians 3 we're going to talk tonight on something since we've got a lot of new ones uh coming in and I was hoping maybe brother Paul would be here the the other brother but for uh if most of you didn't realize that we got a couple more family members this weekend brother brother Hank sister Martha joined the family they were baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ Zach black was already part of the family he just wanted to affirm a little more of his of his baptism so we thank for that you know a lot of times you see you try to uh I think everybody got it but you really you want them to see that name because it's a name that we're identified with we're identified with the name of Jesus and if we'll not shun it here see in other words he'll take our name there you know so we we just thank the Lord that that we have grace and mercy and I want to uh call a brother's name out in Oklahoma his name's brother Tim and Tim fugit he's a solid member of the umbrella claude's Church they put a couple of stents in his heart either last night or first thing this morning so he's doing okay and uh but just keep him in your prayers his name is brother Tim Fugate so we're going to speak tonight on a subject that sometimes words are are being used and I know brother Dale's trying to fly through a lot of things and and he's trying to to uh to get a thought across to us which sometimes we don't get it it's not that he's sometimes we don't get it it's not that he's not getting it across it's just we don't get it but uh when we put out words but tonight we're going to speak on a new body a new body all right just to maybe help some of the young ones and and I've never seen it not help the old ones either right right so word's Eternal right right amen same yesterday today and forever so I believe it'll help us too and I think some of you that were in the Sunday School Sunday school class this past weekend you're going to get another taste of what we were talking about which had nothing to do with the subject matter but we got on it so I believe the Lord kind of wanted us to stay on on that line so Philippians 3 verse 20. let's buy our heads before we get started Heavenly Father we pray tonight Lord that you would come Among Us in a special way that you would come down in the hearts of the Believers and Quicken the word that's being spoken and let it not be my words Lord but let it be the words of the Almighty father we're going to read your word we're going to read what your Prophet had to say Lord and I pray that somewhere in there that that we'll see as the song goes I want to see you and that means understand I want to understand you it many people saw you when you were here on the Earth and and they didn't understand you but on the day of Pentecost when you came into the hearts of the believer Peter understood he could see you Lord because he knew that there was something different in his life that he'd been made new father we pray that you'd be with the sick ones Among Us Lord just you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction so I pray Lord that you would just touch them tonight as we endeavored to speak about you Lord and be with the ones that are not here be with the ones Lord that are sin sick we pray for the ones lord always that are down below our feet right now on the wall lord of the ones that are away from us Lord away from the Lord but Lord Jesus we we were all on that wall at one time and then we come off that wall by your grace and father we're believing these these names will materialize into the building father we pray now that you'd be with brother Tim Lord bless him we count him as a bosom friend and a good brother Lord there brother Claude we pray now that you just continue to be with him lead him and guide him by the Holy Spirit Lord we ask just bless us take care of us lead us and guide us here tonight in Jesus name amen Philippians 3 verse 20 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior of the Lord Jesus Christ there's that name who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned now that word fashion you remember if you'll remember we're still on Genesis we're going to read Genesis 1 26 at the last of the service this has a lot to do with the Genesis 1 26 man so we're still on Genesis 1 26. if you can remember that remember we looked at the word created the word created is not in that form was not bringing it from nothing like God did the Earth and in bringing something it was fashioned the word created means fashion all right so who shall change our vowel body that it may be created we can say the same thing like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto itself now let's read First Corinthians 15. then you can be seated so also as a resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption right that's what we do when we when people die we plant them we sow them we sew them back into the ground all right but if they've got the Holy Spirit go back to the Romans 8 it says if the spirit of him to raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in your law so quick in your mortal body so it'll bring you back out it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power boy when this thing comes back up something's going to happen it is sown a natural body now we know that because I'm looking at it all right it is sown a natural body it has raised the spiritual body there is a natural body and there's a spiritual body you may be seated in The Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word laughs now I feel a little handicapped remember I told you one time about my iPad that I always brought my Bible up here because this thing doesn't need batteries well my iPad needs batteries today so it's back there healing is sick it needs hands laid on it not swiftly though you might break something but we look at this phrase and we we see where our conversation is in heaven from which we also look for the savior of the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body now we all know for one thing everybody's sitting here tonight was born the exact same way let's be loudly 60 of us in here tonight let's be loud Say Amen okay but we all know we came from the same place from the same act and we got the same flesh all right our bodies are made of the same 16 elements of the earth yours is not different than mine it may look different but it's the same 16 basic elements of the Earth all right let's read that quote there number one in Hebrews chapter one and then we'll get started brother Brown says now our bodies are made out of 16 different elements of the world we know that it's made up potash and a little calcium and petroleum Cosmic light and atoms and so forth all bundled together and makes this body comes from the dust of the Earth now does everybody understand how that happens your mother and your father eats beans and taters for those of you that are watching tonight taters is potatoes but your mama eats beans your daddy eats taters they eat good old deer meat they eat steak and all that goes into their body and guess what that's where you come from right there's no other way the chemical elements go into your body your body separates you what a wonderful thing this body is even in a fallen condition that it breaks those elements down puts it into blood it goes into highly congealed blood which is sperm and then when Mom and Dad gets together boom there you are you come from every person on this Earth came from the 16 elements of this Earth all right that's why brother Branham could say that your body was in this earth in the beginning is everybody okay with that this if this break when this breaks down because the Lord told Adam said from thus you came and from dust you'll return all right so you'll go right back to the dust that was on the earth now now listen we were not made for that so keep this in your mind this is permissive will this is the permitted way of God but I'm going to read you an outstanding quote here in a little while where brother Branham takes that apart and watch how he watch how he words it but it'll be the last quote on the page from this part Karen said I've got 45 minutes because all these other preachers have took off all my time that's been preaching so I'm just only get 45 minutes but he says you eat food I don't listen to what he says either you eat food as you eat the food that turns from dust and it it turns from the dust and it comes from the dust and it just goes right on your flesh as far as your flesh is no different from a horse from a cow or anything else it's still just flash does everybody understand that as I was explaining to him in the in the Sunday school class Sunday this is the highest form of animal flesh now look the Genesis 1 26 man it's not this flesh everybody got that say Amen that's the spirit man that come from God that was eternal that was created by God or fashioned by God that had nothing to do with your first birth amen but it has a lot to do with your second birth amen and it has a lot to do with getting you back into the Garden of Eden because the Bible says flesh and blood will not inherit the Kingdom right so look I want to show you something and I it's let me finish this quote it's still just flesh and boy you glorify the flesh but that Spirit has a soul in there my brother that's right but your flesh is just dust of the earth like the animal so what I was explaining to him for those of you that are new and you know the Garden of Eden we don't believe it was an apple we believe it was a sexual Affair between Eve and the Beast well the Beast is the missing link all right the Beast had animal flesh so when God put that 126 man into the 2-7 man which was the flesh man Adam and Eve and boy I got a revelation on that today but I'll leave it for something else because remember Eve was fashioned after who Adam she had to come forth from Adam in order to reproduce Adam way with you and I the Bride of Jesus Christ must be made in His image to come back to bring him forth he can't do it by himself you say he can't he said he couldn't he's got to do it with a bride Adam couldn't reproduce himself is that right Adam's alone he's standing by himself he can't reproduce himself God said I'll make you help me I'll make you somebody that can reproduce you well that's what he's doing to you and I when he made that Genesis 1 26 man same thing as when he took Adam and parted Eve out of her out of him there stands God the male and he just Parts the female sure we say male and female created he them but it's his bride it's us it's male and female in gender but remember we're all female in the body of Christ so I got a little bit on that which is which is really good but we're animal flesh and that animal flesh was put in on the Earth and it was just a higher form so you had you had the animals you had look at your creation you had your lower form then you had your walking animals and then you had the upright then you had man so this is in the image of animal flesh the soul is not in the image of animal flesh okay that soul don't I don't say it doesn't have anything to do with it but it's not made the same way as the flesh man's made all right so you got two things that you got to deal with but I want to deal with something tonight because I don't want us to be and I was talking to brother Bob in the back and he'd looked up the exact same word I don't want you know you say well you're I'm dogmatic about something have you ever looked that word up dogmatic means expressing personal opinions our beliefs and you know where that work dogmatic come from look at the one above it brother Brown said what has been bound the Holy Ghost has been bound by what Creeds and Dogma for two thousand years of belief or set of beliefs that is accepted by the members of a group without being questioned or doubted so when we talk about a new body and somebody points to this thing right here let's be careful let's be careful let's don't be so dogmatic yeah I like that word dog except with a W on it somebody will catch that somebody won't but anyway but listen but most do so let's don't be so dogmatic when we point to this thing right here because remember Flesh and Blood can't inherit the Kingdom we got to go back to scripture we got to go back to scripture and see something here because scripture says flesh and blood will not inherit the Kingdom but now we've got to go through a transformation or a change are let's just read this from number two I I just don't want us to be so when we have new ones come in and and we point to this thing and say this right here is going to be changed well it makes your minds Wonder well this thing is is stinky smelly It's gotta eat it's rotten it's anybody understand what I'm talking about okay so let's don't be so dogmatic and say it's got to be this right here the whole thing all right because let me ask you one question if you do that then it's like brother Bob and I were talking in the back brother uh hantus preached a sermon on me about 35 or 40 years ago when I was a young kid in this church when it was this way and he proved that every seven years your body goes to a transformation but every seven years also there's more of you in the septic tank than there is standing here right hello now realize that when you wash everybody else is thinking the other thing I'm talking about washing the skin off now look if God brings all that back and every fingernail I clip off and every hair I clip off through my life that ain't gonna be right so let's be don't be so dogmatic when we say this thing right here has got to be it's what's got to be changed okay now I want to make one thing clear this body is going to be changed amen this body is redeemed amen but remember brother Brown I'll read you in just a minute let's read this right here what is these bodies made out of a little Cosmic light a few atoms and a petroleum so forth put together that God brought out of the Dust of the earth and painted a picture and we're only living in the negative now so this is negative right amen there's nothing positive about this that's what's on the inside and we're only limiting the negative now in some Glorious Day death will develop the picture right right and we'll return again in a new glorified body to never be old never be sick never have a heartache now it's going to Isaiah 65. and let's look at that word new for behold I create new Heavens right and new earth in the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind now most denominational people preach that we're going to heaven and this world is going to be destroyed because they take says behold I create new heaven in the earth then we're going to read Peter second Peter where it says behold the day of the Lords as a thief in the night seeing that all things shall be dissolved what man or person are we to be you know don't you don't go to it yet so we got to bring these things together we got to see when God says I create new heavens and new earth remember that word create is fashion now that word new in that context there in the Hebrew lexicon strong number 2318 you can bring it up to be new renew or repair everybody got that so it's not Annihilation right right all right I want to get that in your mind it's not Annihilation we do not believe that anything of this I cannot be annihilated if I'm born again okay if I'm born again like I said about Paul poor Paul they put his head on a shopping block they chopped his head off when he stepped over into that sixth Dimension he didn't have to pick his head up off the floor right so man couldn't hurt that soul that was Paul that person that he was right can we say that person that was the real Paul the real Paul was inside there but look it says to be new renew or repair to make a new to repair to renew oneself and keep going to the next one I like this one go to the next one this is new new thing are fresh so what's God going to do he's with somebody I created in new heavens and a new Earth well the denomination says well he's going to do away with the Earth and do away with the heavens and we're gonna go live on a cloud Isaiah 44 says I made this Earth to be inhabited now if the word of God is eternal there's an eternal thought Eternal thought of God being expressed he made this world to be made eternal right all right so if our bodies were in that Earth they're going to be made eternal got it all right so now let's go to Second Peter verse 3. but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also so he's saying the Earth's going to pass away well now that word passed away I didn't bring it because it's a big old long word it starts with a P but it's not as we say pass away in other words do away with all right it's something God's made I've always said in the six days of creation whatever God created that's eternal are you wouldn't have said it right the Earth the Sun the moon not exactly the same animals come on people but when he spoke something how are you going to make it any go any other way all right because the animals they're going to be made eternal they fell because we fell right right when we make it back they're going to automatically make it back all right but a day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise the element shall melt with fervent Heat the Earth also in the works of the therein shall be burned up The Works look at that word works seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what things Heavens earth right see and then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person thought would it be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness all right so it says new that word new remember means renew we're gonna he's gonna take this Earth and he's going to burn it over right and then he's what's he gonna do we're going to come back on this Earth but remember this is the first Earth that's going to be changed right amen this okay so it's not a different Earth it's not we got to go to another world to get a body we're not aliens We're Not Angels either we're human beings all right Revelations 21 1. I want to you know just for the ones that kind of you know you for the first time when I read the Bible you you have a lot of questions and I thank God for Bible studying and things like that all over the years that we're in a prophet that could tell us because you look at Revelations 21 I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away now that word passed away is that big old long word pair of whatever it is and it just me it doesn't mean to annihilate it just means to burn over all right what's going to happen is this is what this is what I was looking for when I was studying over this and and realizing that maybe sometimes we when we say the word new our mind goes to throw this one away and get another one most people denomination and most people in this message believe that you're gonna this one's gonna be done away with and you're going to get a brand new one well then brother Brandon will say we'll get a new one got to know what that new means got to know what that knew where that new comes from too all right and I John saw the holy city where's it coming now if he annihilated A New Earth or if he made a new or if he annihilated the Earth where's this holy city coming this New Jerusalem is coming down out of heaven and it's going to set down on this new Earth all right now look at number three future home these processes make us clean he's talking about us going through justification sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire that does the cleansing of our this Temple so as old world frame did not destroy now let's hang on to that word frame By the Waters when it was washed off the frame of the planet the old frame all the dirt all the stuff that God put on the Earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed and the Bible said it was destroyed but it never destroyed the frame it just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it the framework remained all right so the framework remained this is your framework your body is made of Bones and flesh that is the framework of you it's what holds you together right so this is the framework so the framework stays the same you go down black-headed you're going to come up black-headed well if you go down gray-headed and you was black-headed You're Gonna Come Back black-headed all right let me clear that up so if but if you go down brother Brown says short tall the framework's going to stay the same right and I'm going to show you something here in a minute that'll really help you on that but let's go to the Greek Lexicon we were talking about this downstairs and and I it's it's easy to see this process but that it goes through a change this Greek Lexington if you go to the word baptizo all right now have you ever looked this up kind of funny but makes a point to dip repeatedly to immerse to submerge we did that we baptized our brother right right all right but now he's got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost to change him all right so that's what the baptizo is to baptize wash now look around here too overwhelmed look at number three to overwhelm not to be confused with which is 9 11 which is bapto Baptist the baptism service the bat the bad putting them in the water and bringing them out all right the clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is the text from the Greek poet and physician nikander who lived around 200 BC it is a recipe for making pickles and it's helpful because it uses both words nikander says that in order to make a pickle the vegetables should first be dipped right it's still a cucumber it looks like a cucumber tastes like a cucumber acts like a cucumber amen the Frameworks of a cucumber's there but you put it in a process you put it into boiling water and then baptized our baptizo which goes back to where bro where Jesus said I baptized you with Holy Ghost you'll be baptized with Holy Ghost and Fire all right so that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost you Bab type baptizo in the vinegar solution both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in a solution but the first is temporary look like a cucumber act like a cucumber you wash it with a little water you're still going to look like a cucumber you're still going to act like a cucumber you're still going to taste like a cucumber but the first is temporary the second the act of baptizing the vegetable produces a permanent change once you take a cucumber through the pickling process it can never turn back into a cucumber again yet it looks like a cucumber may still act like a cucumber it's not going to taste like a cucumber but it does taste a little like a cucumber so it's the framework it's meant what I'm trying to say is it's the framework when we baptize with the Holy Ghost we've still got the same framework all right but let me ask you a question brother Brown makes a point of saying that when we reach a certain age that that's the age that you know we're full of life and he said you know 20 or whatever I'm going to read it in just a second but I want you to realize something I want you to think did he take a picture of you at your youth here how many of your sisters that 20 year old had short hair raise your hand I mean your sisters at 20 had earrings in your ear oh boy how many of you never mind how many of you had tattoos never mind don't worry about don't answer that don't raise your hand I don't want to know but is that what you're going to be changed back to so is it this thing right here Jim's hair was as short as mine when she was 20 years old is that the picture God saw all right she's not going to be in glory with short hair amen some of you at 20 years old already had children that gonna happen no that changed you a little bit right is that what's coming is that what God saw I don't think so he's dealing with the framework though he's dealing with the framework that you are I'm going to read you some quotes here you you make your choice I I'm just telling you when we get so dogmatic that we have to we have to hone in on something that's our idea and then we let the prophet in the Bible tell us that not exactly the same gases are going to come back then is it this very thing I don't think so but now remember let me make a point we don't believe in getting a new one right we're going to keep this framework this framework stays we're gonna have hands we're going to be a human we're going to not turn into angels we're not going to be Spooks we're gonna have flesh and one of our sisters in the Sunday school class she'll remain it the person will remain nameless how to shout and fit this this Sunday she figured that we could eat when we come back to the future home and they're not going to be no calories I said somebody ought to penicillin there'll be no calories in glory we are going to eat aren't we right remember they're not in the sixth Dimension they're not in flesh so they're not in their right to be conditioned right they're not in the right framework right is that okay they're not in the right framework they're not in their framework there is spiritual right Supernatural in another dimension but they're coming back here to pick up their body their framework man they're not coming back here to pick up short hair sisters right so where do animals come from let's read a quote though in demonology let's read paragraph 43 just save time I made I made no I won't I was going to say 45 minutes is enough when God gave you this life and you was at your best at about 23 when you come into the resurrection you'll come back just exactly like he was when you was 23 years old or 25 four deaths and then death will have everything that it can do it is set there but you'll come right back the way you were now if you leave that the way it is then it looks like it's this same one coming back can't be everybody understand that are you quiet but that's fine with me I want you to think about it if you bring your 20 year old body back that you lived in down here on the earth the exact same one I'm telling you I just gave you 100 examples you're gonna have tattoos you're gonna have holes in your ears so maybe you'll have holes in your nose you understand what I mean I mean there's things that goes on in this human life that happens that it's like brother Danny you know getting all broke up and got pins and and all kinds of things in them you know and I'd love to go to the airport with him I'd love to see that thing go off in the uh in the uh go through the line there I'd love for them to say come back here just a minute what is that you know he's got that big old rod in his in his leg but you know what that is not going to Glory right that's not going with him there's not going to be a scar if you were 20 years old and you had a scar over an injury that's not what you're coming back to all right but we gotta look though and we got to see where that Genesis one man fits in this whole thing because remember the Genesis 1 26 man never sinned never had an earring never had short hair sisters never had tattoos never had a baby right all right so let's put this thing together let's look at number five why are my people so tossed about did you ever think that when your spirit leaves you if you was in a gas chamber if he was in the bottom of a well bottom of the sea or wherever it may be when your spirit leaves you water fire nothing can hold it it moves right through the building it's like a vapor it hangs there it's alive it can't die it's got eternal life it can't perish now he's talking about your soul he's not talking about your body all right then when you die and your loved ones are Weeping they think you're dead but you're not even if you're a sinner you're not I put that in you're still living up here the old body's past faded away but it's put down into the ground all the adamance things that you once was has broken up and gone back into the cosmic light and petroleum or whatever it was gone back into the Earth and someday the great king of these spirits will come Jesus coming from glory in his body amen let's keep going he'll turn loose the power of God and every person that's in him their bodies them atoms will start going together the cosmic light will start making this autumn this is wonderful we'll start making up and in a moment's time every person that's in Christ will be changed and made a young man and woman again standing on the Earth everybody got that same man oh my what what a wonderful time that God has laid these things out for us but I want you to see I want you to look at this one this is 1964. this is after the seals all right just think of the arena in the days of the early martyrs that when those Christians were thrown into Lion's dens and those lines killed the Christians and eat up their bodies see yet they were scattered their body was in the wastage of the line across the face of the Earth no matter where it is you can't see you're made up of a substance that's unseen made material and God will give that substance back see now like you take a cell you break it down from a cell it comes in a Cell in a Cell an atom and a molecule and on down like that finally it ends up into the Unseen it goes from a natural something you put your hands on to gases from gases into acid acid into gases and gases on back like that this is a seventh grade education man explaining this and the scientists are going how does he know that it's just simple to me really ashes into gases and gases on back like that until it finally all winds up to one little thing in that is Spirit and their Spirit who has occupied these gases it might not be the same gases right but the features of what you are right framework will be exactly what they are again see the spirit has control that what spirit the Holy Spirit right if you don't have the Holy Spirit you're going to come back up in the whole body that you lived in because you ain't got nothing to change you but what is that spirit I said Genesis 1 26 man amen amen the one God saw before the foundation of the world right and now in other words when you become a young man or a young woman and like God takes a picture of you now no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it will be that will wind right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lines whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the Earth that was calcium and potassium petroleum and consonant light and so forth all goes together to make up the body all right pretty simple now no matter that's the whole Earth is filled with that see in other words those 16 elements are common elements they're everywhere all right but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and Ashes and things comes right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best right praise God you ought to say pray to God when was it taken right right when he said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish let's see in the foul the air that's what he's looking for that's what I enjoyed when Daddy preached matching pieces that's what we're going to match amen amen but it's going to be the same framework that you lived in down here because it can't be another person it's got to be the same frame right foreign I don't know whether we're going to be real tall or short or big or I don't know don't care I just know I'm gonna be 20 years old it ain't gonna matter because there's no calories in heaven or Earth there should be a song there somewhere before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice right foreknowledge right it has to be by foreknowledge if it's just by predestination it is God pulling you through a tube but for him to foreknow what you'd look like those who he foreknew he did predestinate to look like that right to look like what like you look now because I'm gonna read you a quote in a minute and then the only thing he did was featured himself here for you to make your choice then you become a servant of God him foreknowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative right therefore if this is a negative and there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing he can say ain't all he wants to I love that this ain't the real thing you reading that this ain't the real thing right we pamper and it ain't real black brother Harris you say this ain't so because this ain't what God wanted this is the permissive part of what God's letting happen all right but it's going to work right after this perfect will now you got it so I don't care what they would do with you that picture in God's Great Gallery up there it cannot destroy it it's in heaven now it's not hanging up in the cubicle somewhere right it's your theophany it's the real you 's who you are if you're born again you could burn it up feed it to the lines this is talking about the Natural Body now do it any way you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as I know he can spell two twos is four you heard me say spell no most of you didn't even hear what it said he can Cipher two twos is four just as sure as God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are the framework in Ephesians 1 proves all this Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before he ever puts you in flesh amen amen can I say that or before the foundation of the world that we should be holy I I was looking up the scripture and I'm sorry I forgot I lost a little bit of time back there but the word preserved see that's the pickling process preserve we've been preserved God's preserved this whole thing and absolutely on God's side of the whole picture he saw us already changed already in glory already glorified those who he's Justified he's already glorified but we're on this side that's why you got to watch be careful don't be so dogmatic because we still living in a natural body we're still living the Natural Things of the Earth and we need a redeemer amen we need a redeemer until this body right here is changed amen amen so don't you forget that don't think you're something special something but you are God did preserve you he did he put you in a file you read that you know what his file is exactly this is his file it has 66 different files in it and when you find yourself in this file you got yourself in the family you find yourself that's why we have to be identified with the name the Lord Jesus Christ because if we were chosen in father son Holy Ghost who's that do you understand that who's that who's father who son who no but when you say Lord Jesus Christ you know that you were preserved in him before the foundation of the world and in his mind it is it is all finished because remember he can't change his mind so when we when we were caught up in the fall that didn't change God's mind let's read this the interval 1956. here not long ago I was Coleman what Little Couple hairs I have left my wife said to me Billy you're getting bald-headed I said praise God I hadn't lost to one of them she said where are they at honey and I said I want to ask you and then I'll answer you I said where was they before I got them right you tell me where they was before they was here I'll tell you where they are waiting for me when I get there right Hallelujah that's right certainly there was one time they wasn't than they were then they wasn't yeah you read that one more time there was one time they wasn't before he was born then they were when he was young then it wasn't when he got old everybody okay with that and and where they was at the beginning when God put the body here in a shadow right hmm they'll be waiting for his second coming in glory when he will appear the second time in every item that holds me together excuse me every bit of cosmic Cosmic light will come together not in a sexual desire or a natural birth but through a recreation amen new I create a new Heaven and a new Earth same framework William Branham he's not going to look any different amen is everybody okay with this all right I just want everybody to see that what God has done for us already oh my this ain't enough oh my If That Ain't Enough wait a minute but through Recreation where almighty God will speak and the spirit will turn to the body and will live forever oh my if that ain't enough to set every Christian's heart into roaring with joy God has so ordained it so he proved it in his first miracle now I didn't think about this but this is correct he proved it in his first miracle he turned water to wine now you can through the process showing he bypassed the vine he just spoke from the water to the wine it actually would have been wine think about it put the water in the ground let it water the grates comes up through the grapevine goes out into the heads out in the grapes they take the grapes they mash it up and they make wine out of it most of your grapes is water melon are mostly water but God just bypass that see it actually would have been wine went up to the Grapevine and infirm it and ferment into that and turned into wine sure but God just spoke it and bypassed all that so will he in the resurrection of all the sexuals in marriage and things it'll all be done away with and God will just speak and we'll live again amen unveiling of God this is where I want you to see something because watch this master builder brother Dale's been preaching on the Masterpiece family but I want you to realize one thing that big piece of Rock the tech statue of Moses was in that statue was always in that piece of Rock I don't care if it was still laying down in the earth and they had to excavate it and dig it out right but that image of Moses was in that rock amen think about that like a man building Chimes or making Chimes the motor each Bale has got a ring different from the other the same materials but so much iron so much steel so much brass to make it give the team that's the way God did he bred this one to that one to this one to that one to this one to that one until he got exactly what he wanted that's how he come down God unveiled himself in the pillar of fire through the prophets then into the Son of God which he was God see it's the same God bringing out exactly from Perfection to Perfection from glory to glory he didn't stop there he said that's the way the church goes to get you here for that Genesis 1 26 image to be developed he brought this one to this one this one to this one because what you have to do when you get here enough do you have anything to do with you getting here no God did right that's why he preserved the whole thing that's why if you look at predestination in that way it looks like God did predestin but he did predestined by what he saw you would do when you got here so that Genesis 1 26 man comes to you and it's not a different looking person amen that's why God took that picture so now what are we going back to we're going back to what God saw in that picture not what man took a picture of you on the earth at 20 years old you're going back to that image because it's going to mold together your theophany is not tall and you're short or blackhead and you're brown-headed it all has to come together I wish you would understand something not talking about the genetics of God this just proves the whole thing we come straight from the genetics of God and God so much thought about it he took the natural genetics I told him up in Virginia and they're still preaching on it I told him I said you guys in Virginia I said you were in the Civil War 600 000 men boys most of them that had never been married never had children died in that war six hundred thousand Generations were wiped out and most of them was from Virginia and I looked at them as about 300 and I said somehow you got here somehow you got here because man destroyed 600 000 Generations but somehow you made it through somehow that Guardian Angel kept your kinfo I believe that people I believe if God preserved it if he saw it before the foundation of the world he's obligated to get it here for us to make our choice that way we can tell Satan hey we made a choice man right right we were we we are different but yet we're not different right we are different in that we chose and God knew our choosing before the world and he can go all the way across time and put how many of you how many of you brothers and sisters don't even know how in the world you got together Boyd for sure June got both hands up if she had three she'd have been up but look do you understand what I'm saying God's preserved us he did make a way to get us here but remember he made a way to get us back what was lost was the way back Adam and Eve couldn't produce us or we wouldn't have needed Samuel and Peggy Dale but I need it after the fall I needed Samuel and Peggy Dale to put that same genetic line together to get me here to match that Genesis one man that's why this is a negative and that's the positive and that's what we're going to we're going to that positive so it's not a it's not brothers and sisters it's not a body that's new that's we're going to throw this one down and and God's going to just mold us another one no he thought so much of you somehow Brother Don he likes you brother dick Brother Dean there's something about your character that was in him not that he liked let me put it this way not that he'd like it was him because that Genesis 1 26 is the very attribute of almighty God there's no God had a relation with this one to bring we come straight from God so if that genetics hey if the genetic Line's strong down here what do you think about an eternal genetic what do you think about an eternal genetic code that can't be broke right that God's going to do everything he can when he gets you here he's going to lay it out there in front of you and you're going to have to make a choice but he sure knows what choice you're going to make so we're molding into that image that's the image we're looking at we got it backwards if this is a negative and that's the positive which one was first how many times did Brother around tell us that story which one's first the real picture or the negative he says to have a negative you already got to have the positive so that positive of Richard Marlow that he knew he was going to accept him he knew that he was going to accept God he knew he was going to be a child of God he got that he brought that genetic line down through human beings Brother Gary and there he says to make his choice but he's not going back you understand he's not going back to the 20 year old man he was on this Earth per se the framework is right but the earrings and the whatever he did at 20 and whatever you did at 20 years old that's not what God saw remember brother Brown said if God sees you without the blood he's got to kill you Christian or not because this right here can't inherit the Kingdom of Heaven flesh and blood as we speak now cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven it's got to be changed it's got to be made new it's got to be an I create a new Heaven and a new Earth it's going to be the same framework let's read this right here at the end time 1954. I picked these up because this is where brother round said we don't have to read Genesis one do we have to read Genesis 1 26 again we've read it enough we were made in God's image right oh I'm so glad to be on earth now this is the prophet just before the break of day heard the message of his blessed appearing lo and behold the Fig leaves now are becoming green this is 1954. how many years ago that 60. well I'm glad to be on earth now just before the break of day Herald the message of his blessed appearing lo and behold the Fig leaves now are becoming green the gospel of the kingdom is sweeping to every nation and we're near the end can you and the end can be seen amen our heavenly father as we bow in thy presence to thank thee for Jesus thy beloved Son who gave his life a ransom for us coming down and saving us from a life of sin that he might resurrect us in a new body at that great day restore now remember when he put that word restore in and see it brings that new right back everybody got that when he says restore because because you can't if you take this and throw it away and pick up this that's not restoring this back this is what fell this is not restoring it back so you're not getting a new body you're getting the same framework not exactly the same gases doesn't have to be 16 elements of the earth your image of what God saw right everybody okay with this they really enjoyed it in Sunday school class I don't know where it came from either because it sure didn't have nothing to do with patience maybe it did restore us back to Perfection because we got a match the word here we know what the word is there it can't change Genesis 1 26 man cannot change it never has changed never will change it's a paradox you're sitting here all of us are most of us are over 20 some of us three times that some of us close to four times that but yet if you're born again you're 20 years old it's hard to see but I believe that's what's going to help us in the change we got to see that that thing is already here it's not something we got to go get sin denominational World they got to go get some I'm sorry to say about denominational and most of the message people believe that you're going to throw like right here it says he says oh now brother Brown said a new body but keep reading restore us back he should have said annihilate us and get rid of this one and bring another one no it's not what he said now let's look at Fellowship 1955. now if you speak of heaven or when we die that we go off to a place somewhere where you can't even see up there can't you see that God has hid the glory from the Natural Life we are sitting here in Heavenly places now the holy spirit is here now Christ is here and the body that we receive when we go out of here we go into another dimension into a blessed place with the Lord Jesus said at the returning of Christ in his physical body come back to earth he spiritually turned back and picked up a brand new body what sounds like it's going to be brand new still same framework though right right still the same you right picked up a brand new body that's going to live forever oh my people could get the idea right now the Angels walking up and down these aisles of Christ the son of God moving around in the building what a difference you're in his presence I don't believe that's any different than now questions and answers 1959 what difference is between Body Soul and Spirit now I'm going to read this one and then we'll be finished and I'll be do what my Deacon said be done by 8 30. ain't that wonderful the body is the flesh that you look at that must rot it was born by sexual desire of father and mother it must rot it is no good therefore in the new birth in the resurrection when you're brought forth again in a new body okay everybody all right with that one now when brother Brown says new or somebody says new okay it'll be God's creative power that'll speak like he did to Adam and you'll come forth see because remember I want to you know we always use um Abraham and Sarah as a type changing back these bodies but remember God changed Sarah's body back but he had to do something else to her so he didn't just change her back to the 20 year old girl she was right because she couldn't bear kids right so he must have had to change something else so it wasn't just this right here got changed back no God did a work right in that body to bring her back see so that's why we need to just watch what we're watch what we're doing all right look adoption I like this one then we'll go back to the 64 questions and answers and what is it when you're way out fishing with a brand new body you've turned back to a young man all together again or a young woman you're never going to die no more and you look down on Earth and think I can enjoy some grapes and some good cold water but you know I don't need it here see that's when they're over in the sixth dimension right right that's what he's talking about but someday Jesus is coming and this Angelic body this theophany that I'm living in will not come through the womb of a woman anymore it'll not come through sexual desire anymore but because that he was born without sex desire I'll be resurrected without it and he will speak someday and the dead in Christ shall rise and that body that I once lived in huh he's pretty playing here right right same framework I once lived in will resurrect into a glorified body amen so a change and I walk I'll talk I'll live I'll enjoy Hallelujah and they must be rejoicing because you can't understand what he's saying the ages to come through Jesus Christ Our Lord there you are brother that's the gospel all right questions and answers 1964. now listen to this this is the last one this first conscience controls this body with sea taste fill smelling here everybody understands you got three different aspects of your body you got body which is flesh spirit and soul okay you got a body which is this man C taste feel smell and hear that's what this body was given to us for it to contact this Earth that's why it's down here on this Earth in flesh okay then we got a spirit that has memory reason conscious affection imagination all right you got that then inside that is a soul that's either Faith or doubt you either have God in you tonight or you have the devil now God works from the outside in to get you born again then he works from the inside out to redeem this guy yeah this guy okay right so you understand that you got to go through justification outer Court sanctification the spirit realm intercourt inside and the holy of holies is where nobody can get to because nobody knows you but you that's right nobody nobody even your wife doesn't know you but you she can't think your thoughts thank God you can't think hers either thank God but you can be one but it's two people so she has a body spirit and soul you have a bodies everybody has a body spirit and soul even Jesus had a body spirit and soul amen all right but remember Jesus's Spirit was not Fallen because he was not brought by sex desire he was brought by creation all right this is for the new ones but I wanted to get this last quote in I got to bring this back out so you got sea taste feel smelling here and that's what animals have see taste feel smell in here so this is animal flesh this is what God give us to contact the world with same thing as the animals then there's a spirit in there memory reason conscious affection imagination now the dog can have a little bit of that or a cat but they can't love okay they can't have a soul they can't choose right or wrong right they don't have a soul they don't have a conscience to do that but you do right that's what we're talking about God works through justification what you do out here remember sanctification is what's inside cleans all that out all that unclean Spirit right then in the inside man it's either the Holy Spirit or Euro or your own nature or your new nature one of the two you know I've got two souls in there you're an individual you're one person you've got one soul that's soul by you being born into this world that Soul has a fallen nature because it was born in sin shaping and iniquity that's the pattern but see God knew though that if he puts you down here give you a soul to make a choice then you're going to turn around and make a choice that he already saw everybody all right that he already saw you're going to make that choice then he comes to that Burns that old nature out the things of the world the smoking the drinking all that should go out it's sanctification I'm talking about inside man wants to feed on the word he wants it more than anything he wants that word to be born down inside of him I don't understand a lot of people in the message you know they said boy quit smoking quit drink no just get born again like Dave said just get born again you'll quit that business what happened to me and that's what happened to Mo those of you that are born again know what I'm talking about but remember you still look like a cucumber right you still look like the old you the old you just doesn't do is went through a process a pickling process where you don't taste the things of the world anymore you don't want the things of the world anymore but you still are a human right still look like a cucumber but you went through the baptismal the pickling process where it has changed you all right that's where you talk about a new body well there it is the pickle the pickle is new it's got a whole new name doesn't it you don't go pick up some cucumbers and just assume they're pickles no you go to the grocery store and you get cucumbers over here then you go over here to the jar that says pickles but you know in the back of your mind that used to be a cucumber right and you get it over here right but it's been changed and you can't ever take that pickle and make it a cucumber anymore Hallelujah you'll never go back you may look like a pickle but you're not gonna act like a pickle I mean a cucumber You're Gonna Act Like a pickle you may look like the frame will be the same now look watch this right here this first conscious controls this body with sea taste feel smelling here and that's just got us all scrupled up we reason and everything else but that new body that comes from this born again not this first conscious it'll pass away everybody got that right this conscious will pass away all right it's that inside something that lives everybody understand it say Amen congregation says amen it's not this outside see taste feel smelling here let me stop here for a minute it that only reacts to what's inside right the Cucumber looks like a cucumber but when you bite into it the inside is a pickle right same way with God it looks like still this but when God comes inside it makes that cucumber act like a pickle amen all right so it's come from this born again not this first conscious it'll pass away it's that inside something that lives it's not this outside sea taste feel smell and here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person they calls it a person that is the person that cannot die amen amen see that's the person that the New Life Starts from can we interject Genesis 1 26 in there amen so that's the new person and that's the person that the New Life Starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life you get it so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world right the family album Genesis 1 26. God's preserved you he's put you up and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word see and the same thing is or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word because this is not a word body remember we go back to who is this Melchizedek he says you didn't come word first you become the word that's why I don't understand these preachers the message think we come here with eternal life if you come here with eternal life you come here with the word right and you don't need a new birth but I need a new birth because I didn't come here with eternal life I don't care what anybody said I know what I did and that wasn't nothing to do with God right right the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word and the same thing did by Sarah when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a son you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the Sun all this done was just talking strong God's plan out just a little bit longer now listen didn't it didn't bother him because he ain't any longer than he was when he spoke it he ain't any older than when he spoke that's what I was telling him downstairs I said uh how many of you seen pictures of the world where they they draw a picture of God what does he look like does anybody ever seen a picture of God that looked like about his 20 year old man in the prime of his time and how do they picture God oh man gray-headed sorry I am too stoop shouldered Jen brought a book home from when she was going to the Baptist church and they were going through this wonderful and I'm not throwing off them but they they brought this wonderful subject of Experiencing God and she brought me the he said Experiencing God the man that lucky is 150 years old he was stooped over and had it didn't he had a cane he was stooped over and looking like this now I don't want a God Like That if I Made In His Image I don't want to be in that image right he's a 20 year old man when he looked at Adam when he looked at Adam Adam said hi Dad but they were the same age God wasn't 40 and Adam 20. they were both 20. they were both in the prime that's one of it when we see that when we see that when when Jesus came back in his glorified body that Mary May doing had a problem they say you got to watch that too because remember Jesus's body three days before that was beat so much so you couldn't tell who he was the canine Tails ripped flesh out he had stripes on his back he had bruises they pulled his beard out now when he resurrected that body didn't come up you understand what I'm saying that body that went down like that didn't come up that body changed that framework changed because I'll promise you remember brother Brown said it's not the it's not the chemistry of the blood Jesus's blood dripped on this Earth he didn't have any bud Lottery left in his own body but now I'm just you know I believe he shed the blood on the earth and left it here amen so when he comes back and talks to Mary Magdalene he's went through a change same framework bruises are gone flesh is not torn but he's got the nail prints because of the Redemption Factor he showed he died and they weren't putrid Shores they were there they were holes because remember Thomas put his hand in his side he didn't just touch it he put his hand inside but remember they thought he was a spook right he said give me something to eat he ate it didn't fall in the floor it went somewhere it went into that body just like we'll eat forever and not need the things of the world and we'll eat because we enjoy eating right right amen well I figured I'd got more praise God than that but you know what didn't brother Brown say that God will give you the desire of your heart I like to eat too if my desires to eat that's not going to go away over there I'm gonna sit down and eat we're just going to be glad that it multiplies real fast you understand but do you see what I'm saying this this Earth is going to go through a process but your body right now God's going to come down and the ones that take the body change you're going to be changed in your very atoms because our atoms are deteriorating right now we're blowing out gases and I'm not trying to be funny but we are as human beings we're given off gas stuff because we're dying it's corrupt that's why he was they wouldn't let Jesus's body because we got to have a body like his glorious body remember he said I won't leave my holy one seed corruption corruption is the breaking down of gases Jesus's body wasn't that way because we're going to have one like his we're gonna have a body like his glorious body and when he came up in that Resurrection the only Marx he had was a March you and I put on him right I thank God that he's going to let us live for an eternity like brother Danny he could left brother Danny like that there's your marks of Shame there's your marks of sin any of us there's your whatever your mark is your you know you're taken out of something or or your hair or tattoos but you know what he's going to do he's going to wipe that all away he's going to take you and put you in your Perfection but yet he's going to walk through Glory and still show the marks I've always said he's going to have a marked body for eternity just so you can have a perfect one just so you can have a perfect body he's going to stand there and he's going to prove to everybody that he paid he didn't know let's sing that song Let's stand he paid again he did not oh I owed a death I could not pay I needed someone to wash my sins away and now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a dead that I could never pay he paid again a Cavalry he cleansed my soul and set me free I'm glad that Jesus cause we couldn't do it in our sin we couldn't do that but he was a silliest one no brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus not just gonna stay up there one day he's coming back for me chilling with him eternally only being glory to see him on that day I think we'll sing I'll bring you song Amazing Grace all day long crashes Jesus say it again I could not pay I needed someone to wash my sins away we were trapped down here it couldn't be a spirit it had to be a man a human a cancer oh every time you think of Jesus Christ it ought to make you just be free millions of people in this world Glory to see him on that day oh it won't be quiet that's for sure he gave us something new how many of you when you get something new man you know I'm a Dave Ramsey fan so I don't buy new cars but new cars have a good smell to them everybody likes to have a new car smell you know what Jesus Christ done for us is 10 billion trillion zillion times better than any thinking new car smell he gave you something new your mom and daddy couldn't give you anything but a life here but God so loved you and so saw that you would so want him he took somebody from California and somebody from Georgia that there's no way they should have ever met no way they put them together Gary look at your family Why'd You Come the way you did God knew it and he preserved that whole line he brought that whole line down because you know what if you're if one of your fathers would have died if your great-great-grandfather would have died anybody in your line listen this is how perfect this is anybody in your line from the foundation of the world died you wouldn't be here right right but God so preserved all the way from the foundation of the world Mr Gale you are important you're important to God he changed everything to get you here and then you know what he'll leave you this way he's going to change you right back right right because you're going to be made in the image of what he saw before the foundation of the world so you don't have to exactly get your picture out one day and say boy that's what I'm going to look like I'm going to be but I got short hair and I got earrings I got makeup on I got pritches on for the women man I got on shorts I got hair down to my navel yeah Gary and I got a beer in my hand you know Gary yeah can I tell them some yeah we're at his birthday party and they were putting up some of his old pictures and you saw some of mine when we did June's uh collages for her birthday you saw some of my legs but Gary a lot of pictures there's Gary and he's got a beer in his hand well that was about the 20 year old that looked that right on it now that's not the that's not the guy that God saw is everybody okay with that you see what I'm trying to explain that's not the guy that God saw God saw that 20 year old man in his prime doesn't matter how old he gets down here he's not coming back to the beer drinking hippie right right bro Gary it's not coming back to that you know what the desire of this man is not to go back to that your desire should not be that you go back to the 20 year old man you were walking on this Earth with are women you should not right any of us I mean as holy as any of us might have been at 20 years old I still don't want to be that I want to be born In His Image the one that he saw and then when I see my reflection you know what I do I just open up every once in a while I get the family album out and I flipped it right open and says there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit there's therefore now no condemnation how many of you got condemned today come on okay all right so what's he talking about listen to this there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Genesis 1 26 man yeah who walked not after the 2-7 man but after the 126 man because that's what God's looking at and when we match that according to the word now it's not going to be that we match that Samuel Dale at 74 years old but when the word matches that word that he is when that matches it's got to come right right they got to come together they can't it's Eternal so it's got to come together you love the Lord everybody all right man we did good tonight I think we learned male learned a little bit we we're we're not let's just don't be dogmatic Maybe say it again no that's like me and brother Bob and said that's the difference because this is eternal there's nothing dogmatic about eternal there's nothing dogmatic about the word of God it's the real thing remember the dogmatic said it was your opinion right it said your opinion of what you thought was real this is not what tonight this wasn't my opinion what I thought was real I brought it from the word and I brought it from The Prophet's message so it was eternal so I'm going to quit saying dogmatic because it comes from Dogma but we are sure about the word of God Amen Jesus was sure of who he was because he knew who he was I want to I want to bring a sermon about the anointing because Jesus the greatest anointing on the in the whole world brother Brown said it wasn't when Holy Ghost fell into that Pentecost it's not what he said brother Brown said the greatest anointing was when Jesus Took the Bible Scrolls set down and read them right and the Bible said he closed the book set down in Precious words proceeded from his mouth that was the greatest anointing the prophet said that ever struck the Earth you know what I believe it was it was a man identifying himself in the word right right if a man can identify himself in the word that's the greatest anointing because that's what's going to change our bodies brother it ain't going to be this we're not going to it's not going to be a great glorious shouting and running around you know that was all Pentecostal and good and that's okay if we still want to do it right but that's not going to bring about the anointing to get us out of here because that's happened down through time the greatest anointing is is to identify yourself in the word then let that body build inside what did he just say build around that Born Again experience built around that built on that's what we're doing downstairs in the Statue of a perfect man we're building on the new birth we're not building the new birth we're building on the new birth because
