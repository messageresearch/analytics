[0:16] the world Listen The Whole World's
[0:18] waiting on somebody to live those
[0:19] virtues whether they know it or not
[0:22] whether they're the most ranked
[0:24] Christian I mean rank Center in the
[0:25] world they want somebody to be different
[0:28] they want somebody to say thank you
[0:31] please remember what would come about
[0:32] when we first started this even in our
[0:35] human life we should make this world
[0:36] better
[0:38] you know I just started by going through
[0:40] Walmart like you're talking about you
[0:41] know I go through Walmart and they start
[0:43] playing on the floor I think if I put it

[0:46] than when I left it well you know what
[0:48] somebody may see that right you never
[0:51] know somebody may see that and then say

[0:55] goes somebody that really cares you may
[0:57] never know that but hey
[0:59] at least you didn't walk by and do like
[1:01] most and kick the thing out of the way
[1:05] I don't this is the state
[1:08] for me the worst part of
[1:12] of this whole thing is
[1:15] the regrets I have of people seeing and
[1:18] knowing things that I was supposed to be
[1:20] a Christian friend
[1:22] there's really nothing you can do about
[1:23] a bag of feathers you can't go get it

[14:26] they said all of their media Outlets

[14:32] to get in and find out but there are a
[14:34] lot of message Believers there a lot of
[14:36] our churches there yes it was over 10
[14:39] 000
[14:41] because I said it was in the clouds
[14:47] so the beginning of Sorrows
[14:50] well I don't know if your brother
[14:52] coming right then and he was screaming
[14:56] you know right right or whatever I don't
[14:59] know if he was 300 miles
[15:03] okay all right so we're on the Lord's
[15:07] time now
[15:08] all right turn to let's go to Peter and
[15:11] let's read that we haven't been reading
[15:13] it let's read Saint Peter we've been on
[15:15] the Statue of perfect man now 28
[15:19] Parts here and we're on almost the
[15:21] temperance
[15:25] yeah we're on Temperance here and I want
[15:27] us to
[15:30] now remember we're going to read today
[15:32] for brother Ram said that's not quitting
[15:34] drinking that's your
[15:36] ungodly temper
[15:39] so anyway let's read this
[15:43] Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus
[15:45] Christ it's on but I don't have one
[15:46] thing on I'm fine we're okay
[15:48] Simon Peter servant the Apostle of Jesus
[15:51] Christ to them that have obtained light
[15:53] precious face or something that we
[15:54] obtain we've already been through all
[15:56] that something we obtained and um we
[16:00] were standing outside
[16:01] and I'll tell him because he'll be he'll
[16:03] be watching
[16:05] the guy across the street brother Buster
[16:07] he's watching this series
[16:10] so
[16:12] okay okay
[16:15] come up on his golf cart and he said I'm
[16:17] sure I'm enjoying I said I've been
[16:18] wondering about the second perfect man
[16:19] he said I like the way you draw that
[16:22] chart but if you're listening or
[16:26] watching in that it's not my idea
[16:29] that comes from Brother Brown that
[16:31] didn't come from me we wasn't smart
[16:33] enough to do that
[16:37] but he is watching in so we're gonna
[16:39] we're gonna really you know dig down and
[16:42] and see how that this is going to have
[16:44] to be it's a requirement the model
[16:47] required these virtues brother Brown
[16:49] said it was a requirement so Peter
[16:52] didn't just put it in the Bible to fill
[16:53] up his face these are requirements these
[16:55] are things to be a perfect man we must
[16:57] have these verses all right and like
[17:00] Roselle was talking about Wednesday
[17:01] night which is so true to get to seal of
[17:04] God in your forehead
[17:07] this is the city of God in your forehead
[17:10] this is the Seal of God in your heart
[17:13] everybody do you understand that we need
[17:14] to know if you didn't that's just about
[17:15] the simplest way in your plant this is a
[17:17] seal of God in your heart baptism of the
[17:20] Holy Ghost got it in yourself
[17:22] okay this is the Seal of God in your
[17:25] forehead
[17:26] which is not it's not all this but it's
[17:28] all this combined this is the synagogue
[17:31] in your forehead around here this is the
[17:32] statue of a perfect man or it is the
[17:35] Apex or
[17:41] the Seal of God has never been in an
[17:43] individual
[17:45] except for I say Jesus Christ from
[17:47] William Brandon because those are the
[17:48] only two that's reached adoption on the
[17:50] earth so they come to a full stature
[17:53] where the Capstone comes down and they
[17:55] have the fully revealed word all right
[17:57] so that's what brother Dan was talking
[17:59] about that's why it says the Seal of God
[18:01] in their forehead all right and uh I'm
[18:05] sure he'll expound on that much more so
[18:07] let's read this though so to get that
[18:09] seal of God to make that scripture come
[18:11] to pass
[18:13] and by what look at me to make that
[18:15] scripture come to pass you've got to
[18:17] have these virtues working in your life
[18:21] because you won't have the seal the guy
[18:22] in your forehead without those virtues
[18:24] working in your life
[18:26] God's not going to seal in something
[18:28] that's going to break over here or break
[18:30] over here right all right he's not going
[18:32] to seal that in he's going to seal it in
[18:34] when you become a complete package or a
[18:37] complete
[18:39] stature
[18:40] of a perfect man how do we get perfected
[18:44] fivefold Mastery you're going to hear it
[18:45] today
[18:46] all right
[18:48] they have light precious Faith with us
[18:50] through the righteousness of God and our
[18:52] Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[18:54] multiplied unto you through the
[18:56] knowledge of God you're there knowledge
[18:58] of God and Jesus our lord according
[19:00] against his divine power have given unto
[19:03] us all things that pertaineth unto life
[19:05] and godliness so what we're talking
[19:06] about here in the Statue of perfect man
[19:07] we're talking about natural life
[19:11] and godliness the natural life we live
[19:15] is affected by that and the life we live
[19:18] with God should be together but remember
[19:20] we live a natural life and we live a
[19:22] spiritual life everybody understand that
[19:24] say amen amen you don't you don't
[19:26] realize that you're in bad shape all
[19:29] right so we realize that all right
[19:31] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[19:33] exceeding great and precious promises
[19:36] that by these you might be partakers of
[19:38] the divine nature having escaped the
[19:40] corruption that is in the world through
[19:41] lust
[19:42] besides this in other words besides this
[19:45] receiving of the new birth all right
[19:47] and to your faith
[19:50] and what I've always told you add to
[19:52] what you believe
[19:55] you can't add something that you don't
[19:57] believe
[19:58] sure you're looking unto something but
[20:01] you got to believe that God's going to
[20:02] give you virtue
[20:05] you got to believe that
[20:07] but you can't be like a lot of people
[20:10] like long now we're talking coming home
[20:11] yesterday we're talking about the third
[20:13] pull and the third pull ties into this
[20:15] but the third pull is a manifestation of
[20:18] the word but it's not something that
[20:20] we're gonna everybody's saying oh when
[20:22] it comes oh when it comes
[20:27] but when it comes and you ain't got it
[20:29] here
[20:30] you're not going to understand it there
[20:33] at that spot we got to have it now
[20:37] see we can't just one day say well oh
[20:39] one day we're going to be a perfect man
[20:41] there's someday in your journey you got
[20:43] to start that
[20:44] and then you got to work your way up to
[20:45] it all right you can't say oh when that
[20:48] third pull comes into manifestation it
[20:49] is to somebody but it's gonna it's going
[20:51] to be in manifest manifestation of
[20:54] somebody that can handle it
[20:56] power without
[20:58] yeah
[20:59] power without
[21:01] character is satanic but Power with
[21:05] character the prophet said it's fit to
[21:07] rule all right so here we go
[21:11] the third pull is is very dangerous
[21:15] very dangerous if you have it and you
[21:17] don't have character
[21:19] you can zap your boss out of existence
[21:21] you know if you're having a bad day you
[21:22] see God's not going to give you that
[21:24] that's right
[21:26] you got to have the character first and
[21:28] then the third pull is just going to be
[21:30] a manifestation it's going to be a
[21:31] happening of what you already have so we
[21:33] can't say well the statue of perfect
[21:34] man's to somebody else or it's to
[21:36] somebody that's here or somebody who's
[21:37] to you if you have the new birth you are
[21:40] in that pyramid
[21:43] City
[21:45] because all with a new birth is going to
[21:46] be in the city right right all right so
[21:48] if you got the new birth you're in the
[21:50] city but there are things in that city
[21:52] that you can have like I told you before
[21:53] my illustration with a pill
[21:56] the pill is wonderful the pill is great
[21:58] the pill has everything inside of it
[22:00] that you need
[22:02] but it's got a coating around it you got
[22:04] to take that pill put it in the
[22:06] environment
[22:08] then what's inside that pill is going to
[22:10] do you good so what you got to do is
[22:12] just do just like we were talking about
[22:14] the other day you got to make yourself
[22:15] available
[22:17] for God to be able to reveal these
[22:20] things to you all right I can't reveal
[22:22] one thing to you brother today I'm going
[22:24] to Claude nobody can reveal anything to
[22:26] you
[22:27] we can spark your interest
[22:30] open your eyes or or brother Brown said
[22:33] knock the scales back so that you and
[22:35] God can talk to each other
[22:37] that's why as message people we become
[22:41] we've become Catholic
[22:43] brother Dale go get it for us
[22:46] and we'll just believe what you say
[22:48] that's Catholic
[22:50] priest go get it for us you intercede
[22:52] sure he's an intercessor but he's not
[22:54] the intercessor he's a brother Branham
[22:58] absolutely yes ma'am absolutely sister
[23:00] you're exactly correct brother Brown is
[23:03] not he was he sure he was interceding
[23:05] for the people that Moses did but it was
[23:06] Christ in brother Branham interceding
[23:08] for the people sure sure but brother
[23:11] Branham is not my stand between between
[23:13] me and God that's right
[23:15] there's only one the Bible says amen
[23:19] intercessor between God and man and
[23:21] that's the man Christ Jesus now if we
[23:22] preach Jesus Christ
[23:24] see then that's where Jesus can come
[23:25] down
[23:29] question the the out the third pole the
[23:34] opening of the word which brings us to
[23:36] that place where we can change exactly
[23:39] because the Capstone has to come down on
[23:41] brother Brown says that the city comes
[23:43] down on a redeemed entire Earth
[23:45] so that's the way the city is is the way
[23:47] you and I are we're going to have to be
[23:49] ready for this thing to come down on us
[23:52] everybody got that that's what we're
[23:53] talking about the Seal of God in the
[23:55] forehead see where it says holy spirit
[23:57] that seals brother Brown we'll get to it
[24:00] one of these days we'll get up that high
[24:01] where he said it seals all these virtues
[24:04] in
[24:06] then God has a moving breathing stature
[24:10] of a perfect man which is himself
[24:12] this is all that God's working that's
[24:15] correct what do I play you make yourself
[24:19] available okay
[24:23] you cannot manufacture any of that run
[24:26] around we'll we we probably have already
[24:28] skipped through it but he talks about
[24:30] the peacock feathers and the and the
[24:32] crow
[24:33] what's going to happen is what's going
[24:35] to happen is the same way with me and
[24:37] you because it's happened to me remember
[24:38] I've told you many times before about
[24:41] Temperance and and the things that that
[24:43] I used to have a temper and I used to be
[24:45] able to spot off at the mouth and just
[24:46] you know cut you to pieces with my with
[24:49] my mouth but then I came up one day and
[24:52] and I was on the phone with a friend of
[24:54] mine and
[24:56] I said the word s-h-i-t many times sorry
[25:00] and it was free and it just flowed and
[25:03] it just did it just happened
[25:05] and I was talking to him
[25:07] and the word AWS all those things that
[25:10] we always said before
[25:12] well you know you still got the human
[25:14] mind but God said he remember him said
[25:17] God's obligated
[25:19] to help you because you can't help
[25:21] yourself like you said you can't help
[25:22] yourself I was on the phone with him and
[25:24] I was going to say those words just as
[25:26] plain and I've been a Christian for just
[25:28] a year or two maybe still in my you know
[25:31] young journey and I was on the phone
[25:33] with Ken and I we were having a
[25:35] conversation and I was going through and
[25:36] I just when I come to those words that
[25:39] came into my brain brother Danny before
[25:41] they got to here
[25:43] it was like something took its fist I
[25:45] was driving down the road called
[25:46] something hit me right here
[25:49] and just knock the breath out of it so I
[25:52] couldn't say it see God was saying
[25:54] that's where God's going to show you hey
[25:57] that's over
[25:58] hey that's over I'm not going to slip up
[26:00] and say that anymore God's going to
[26:02] protect me because he knows I used to
[26:04] say those things to people and it really
[26:06] hurt them and I don't want to do that
[26:08] anymore see God knows that desire in you
[26:10] if you say well I can't do nothing about
[26:12] my temper I'm not going to do anything
[26:14] about my temper you know what you've
[26:16] done you've just cut God off you've cut
[26:19] the preacher off you cut the word off
[26:21] you said I can't do nothing about my
[26:23] temper
[26:24] well you know what you're going to keep
[26:25] your temper and you're going to stay
[26:27] right there at 10 person you're not
[26:28] going any further
[26:30] right
[26:32] yes it's like just like Kane and that's
[26:34] what's coming up take it early what
[26:35] you're doing you're saying God I can't
[26:37] well now you can say you can say God I
[26:39] can't do nothing about it you can say
[26:41] that but when you say I ain't gonna do
[26:44] anything about it
[26:46] you cut yourself off God can't help you
[26:49] he will not override your free moral
[26:51] agency your Primal agency doesn't finish
[26:53] or end at the new birth
[26:57] that's right right you're a free moral
[26:59] agent to the time you passed away or
[27:01] your body's changed your Primal agent
[27:17] but as far as the rapture
[27:20] the ride as far as the bride
[27:23] um do you have to be the full statue no
[27:27] your bride as soon as you're born again
[27:28] as soon as you're born as soon as you
[27:29] get the new birth that puts you in the
[27:31] body totally inside that's correct
[27:34] but now there's one thing that will
[27:36] happen you'll never go huh
[27:41] you'll never go on with God any further
[27:44] there'll be a lot of promises that God
[27:46] will not keep and doesn't have to keep
[27:48] listen you understand what I'm saying no
[27:53] there's promises that God has for people
[27:56] that goes on up further
[27:58] that he don't have to keep
[28:00] if you say I'm just born again and then
[28:02] you just go lay down on the bed I know
[28:04] you don't I know you know I know you
[28:06] don't but I'm just for others for other
[28:08] people you know it's not like if you're
[28:11] born again you're just as Eternal as God
[28:13] is in your soul
[28:15] but God's still working on that outside
[28:17] guy
[28:18] but he's not gonna remember what I said
[28:20] Power without character satanic that
[28:22] doesn't mean you're of Satan it means
[28:24] that you will use it wrong and he's not
[28:26] going to give it to you just like the
[28:29] car keys
[28:30] my son was my son when he was born but
[28:33] now at five years old I didn't have any
[28:35] parking but he was my son Josh was my
[28:38] son read in the Bible the Bible a son is
[28:40] always a son charm what son was born
[28:42] into the body son and daughter
[28:44] born into the body of God you've got all
[28:46] the promises of God but God doesn't give
[28:48] you the keys
[28:50] to the Statue of a perfect man and just
[28:53] say here take off no
[28:56] you have to grow the Bible says in what
[28:58] Grace and knowledge
[29:01] being born again okay go ahead the Holy
[29:05] Spirit at the top he said is
[29:08] that's what Seals Everything in that's
[29:10] what makes everything work correctly
[29:14] a seal of God is in your forehead that's
[29:16] what the Bible says it's your knowledge
[29:19] it's nothing to say is it is it like
[29:21] like yeah
[29:24] that means you can understand more okay
[29:27] you understand more of God but what as
[29:31] we get further I'll explain it to you
[29:32] more because brother Ryan explains it
[29:34] very well he says see you get all the
[29:36] way up here and temperatures one of them
[29:37] he'll tell you you get right up here
[29:40] and you may fall off
[29:43] well that doesn't mean you fall from
[29:44] eternal life that just means that
[29:46] something in your temperance that you
[29:48] can't handle or you won't let God handle
[29:52] you people know as well as I do there
[29:55] are certain things in your life in my
[29:57] life that we like
[30:07] I'm talking about yourself there's
[30:09] certain things in yourself yes come on
[30:11] people there's certain things in
[30:12] ourselves that we're like that's just me
[30:15] well you know I said to me it's a
[30:16] cop-out if it's wrong that's right right
[30:18] that's right I mean I'm not gonna sit
[30:21] down next Sunday and say I'm not gonna
[30:22] say anything anymore
[30:31] that was not your why I heard that was
[30:34] another one with a straight face yeah I
[30:36] just want everybody to know you know
[30:38] outside when you giggle your hair
[30:41] balances
[30:46] I'm up here just shoot at me
[30:48] but no there's things in our life
[30:52] that we are that is molded into our
[30:55] character that we can't do anything
[30:57] about
[30:58] but we can take that and let God use it
[31:02] for the glory of God
[31:04] see like me I like to talk and that when
[31:06] I was out in the world I talked about
[31:07] things that were horrible that were not
[31:09] good I used the words out of my mouth to
[31:12] destroy people with well now I hope and
[31:14] pray that God takes that same
[31:16] characteristic
[31:18] molds it into this and lets me have
[31:21] knowledge have Temperance have patience
[31:24] with the people that's what brother
[31:26] Brown said you have patience you have
[31:27] patience see
[31:29] okay and I fall and I fall on a lot of
[31:32] these things but there are certain times
[31:34] that you've got to say hey
[31:36] God I know
[31:38] I got a temple
[31:41] and I want you to get rid of it for me
[31:44] not me trying to get rid of it because
[31:45] remember we're not reformers right Freda
[31:48] we're not trying to reform people we're
[31:50] trying to transform
[31:52] because she when Jesus walked on the
[31:54] earth he drove people out of the Temple
[31:56] he had a small temper the Bible says
[32:00] Don't Let the Sun Go Down your wrath it
[32:01] doesn't say don't have
[32:04] don't have anger he just said Don't Let
[32:06] the Sun Go Down you got to have a temper
[32:08] you're right you've got to have a
[32:10] certain amount of people but let me tell
[32:12] you that's correct if you ask God to get
[32:15] ready get in your temper he's going to
[32:17] sing you situation
[32:19] that's how you grow well see that's
[32:21] what's going to happen just be ready
[32:23] what's going to happen is is God's gonna
[32:25] test you and try you remember he tests
[32:28] and tries all his children he don't test
[32:30] the devil's kids he knows what they're
[32:32] going to do he tests his own children
[32:34] now look not for his good
[32:41] because the more I think about that that
[32:44] day when I was driving down the road and
[32:47] I hear people people struggling about
[32:49] you know things in their life that they
[32:51] used to do and that God helped me get
[32:53] through that because he knew I didn't
[32:54] want to ever do that again I don't want
[32:56] to ever say a bad word
[32:57] I don't ever say a bad word in my life I
[32:59] don't even want to say somebody says
[33:01] well I let one slip no I'm a witness
[33:04] that if you put your mind to it mine you
[33:07] put your mind to it
[33:09] and you say God I don't want to ever say
[33:11] another bad word even if Satan comes in
[33:14] and brings a thought
[33:16] I mean it was just like somebody went
[33:19] punched me right here and my breath went
[33:23] and Ken said what happened
[33:25] and I started to say well you wouldn't
[33:26] understand but I went ahead and
[33:27] explained it to him because he knew what
[33:29] kind of life I'd lived before you know
[33:30] we were we were friends of course he
[33:32] just kind of chuckled and laughed but
[33:34] that's okay that's fine but God wouldn't
[33:36] let me say those words
[33:38] they were coming out they were coming I
[33:42] was getting ready to say them and it's
[33:44] like it's just like somebody pushed me
[33:46] right here and all the air went out of
[33:47] my went out of my mouth and it was just
[33:50] like
[33:52] and that was it but you know what that
[33:54] got me through that and I know thou then
[33:56] that I can testify that if you have had
[33:58] a bad
[34:00] temper
[34:01] mouth
[34:02] whatever God can take care of it if
[34:04] you'll ask him that's right he knows
[34:07] your heart that's what I mean he knows
[34:09] what you want to keep and what you want
[34:10] to get rid of
[34:11] remember doors and doors brother Brown
[34:14] said even though you let God in the door
[34:16] of your heart there's still this door
[34:19] here this door here this door here and
[34:22] you know what
[34:23] brother Branham said the Holy Ghost is a
[34:25] gentleman
[34:26] he will not go in there unless you ask
[34:29] him to go in all right see he didn't
[34:32] make these little illustrations just for
[34:34] fun he when he said the Holy Ghost was
[34:36] timid the Holy Ghost was a gentleman
[34:37] well that's what he wasn't meaning by
[34:38] this the Holy Ghost is not going to pour
[34:40] these virtues on you sure he's sitting
[34:42] there waiting
[34:44] he's waiting to pour these things out on
[34:46] you but he's waiting on you to say hey
[34:49] I want that door open and I want that
[34:51] part of my life cleaned out you know we
[34:53] all got those things but as we go with
[34:54] this statue of a perfect man maybe what
[34:56] we're trying to do is it just make us
[34:58] aware
[35:00] that we need virtue we need knowledge we
[35:03] must have that to survive to the
[35:05] Christians especially in this world
[35:06] because you know what we got two hundred
[35:08] thousand thousand demons that's trying
[35:10] to get us to slip up
[35:12] that's what they're given for right to
[35:14] drive us back to the Homeland what's the
[35:16] Homeland it's got you a perfect man to
[35:18] me that is the city that comes down
[35:21] and we're part of that City she had her
[35:22] hand up firsthand too
[35:24] well my question was on this reader
[35:27] at three we have a lot of people who
[35:29] believe in about choice but they don't
[35:32] go on that's right
[35:34] correct
[35:36] what about those people maybe they never
[35:39] really got born again if you're born
[35:41] again you have a new life in you and it
[35:44] will pull you toward right but what
[35:47] she's saying is they truly believe and
[35:49] see you don't how you know that no no no
[35:52] you got to remember if they truly
[35:54] believe they're going with God if it's
[35:56] just a natural human belief they never
[35:59] got the new birth you can't have the new
[36:02] birth and set home
[36:04] exactly you can't have the new birth and
[36:07] then go do the same things you used
[36:08] today you can't do it no way your fruits
[36:13] will show what you got or not that's
[36:15] right if you got the new birth then you
[36:18] are changed right
[36:21] just like me those words still came into
[36:24] my brain
[36:27] and when I didn't have the Holy Ghost I
[36:28] had that blackness in me which should go
[36:30] ahead and say it
[36:31] there was no filter there I just went
[36:34] ahead and he just came right on out just
[36:36] as easy as me talking to you now
[36:38] but when you come down and there's a
[36:40] stopper in there
[36:42] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost will
[36:44] check you right he said he'll you'll
[36:46] feel that little
[36:47] I should have done that well now we're
[36:49] human we do those things but you know
[36:51] what
[36:53] with Temperance we're not we're gonna
[36:54] may not get into all of it today but in
[36:56] Temperance
[36:58] we all have a certain amount of temper
[37:00] we all have a certain amount of switches
[37:02] that
[37:03] controls that temper
[37:07] you know some people said well I can I
[37:09] can tolerate this and I can't tolerate
[37:11] this well this is what you got to work
[37:13] on then don't work on what you can
[37:15] tolerate well that's just human
[37:16] Toleration right but you work on this
[37:19] over here the rough part that's the
[37:20] rough part you got to work on and work
[37:22] on it you mean pray about it absolutely
[37:30] we'll have to catch it real quick next
[37:32] time
[37:36] you make yourself
[37:41] there you know there's not a
[37:45] um I got in trouble one time for saying
[37:47] message 101 but there is a well I mean
[37:51] that's just the simple part baptized
[37:52] name Jesus Christ there's no eternal
[37:54] hell uh you know there's only one God
[37:56] and you know you need to go to church
[37:58] you need to read your Bible That's
[38:00] message 101. that gets you started but
[38:02] if you don't do message 101
[38:04] are you born again no you're not even in
[38:07] school yet well I mean even if you it's
[38:09] not a desire if you just keep doing it
[38:13] I have found that it becomes a desire
[38:17] yes I keep doing
[38:20] the one-on-one yeah sure wait what that
[38:23] has to be is when you come to Faith
[38:27] that's the new birth that's the baby
[38:29] form now your baby form not God but
[38:31] nothing I ever made it for me I
[38:33] understand everybody knows that but it's
[38:34] your baby form you have it in a baby
[38:37] form
[38:38] you must feed it to nurture it
[38:41] remember what brother Brown said the the
[38:43] old uh the old Indian
[38:46] said when me born again
[38:48] may have now white dog and black dog
[38:50] well see remember he had black dog to
[38:52] start with when he got bored again he
[38:54] got the white gold so now there's two in
[38:56] there fighting it's not too in the soul
[38:59] you understand what I mean it's that
[39:00] it's New Soul not new as far as you
[39:03] understand we know that it's not too
[39:04] sold or killing One Soul it's this soul
[39:08] with the nature change well you still
[39:09] got a nature of Hamish nature still got
[39:12] the nature of safety sorry you did
[39:15] brother Brown said we were born between
[39:16] Satan and Eve
[39:20] so we have an adamic nature that we have
[39:22] to get rid of and it keeps what brother
[39:24] Brown said this is going to be sticky
[39:25] until the day weekend out again so
[39:27] you're fighting this thing where brother
[39:28] rounds says the old Indian said me now
[39:31] have white dog black dog
[39:33] and you don't remember the guy said well
[39:34] which one wins he said the one I feed
[39:36] the most that's right the one I feed the
[39:39] most so if you feed the white dog you
[39:43] gotta come to church you gotta study you
[39:44] gotta read your Bible do the little
[39:46] simple things of God all right
[39:48] then you will see a result to me that's
[39:53] the results right growing in Grace and
[39:56] knowledge to me the Statue of perfect
[39:58] man those virtues are the result
[40:00] but now I'm telling you a lot of times
[40:02] I'm telling all of you
[40:04] you see somebody comes in here and they
[40:06] get baptized and they and they they lock
[40:09] a house on fire daddy said on a windy
[40:11] day
[40:12] most of the time about six months later
[40:15] they'll burn out and go home well they
[40:17] never got the new birth because the new
[40:19] birth will never do that
[40:21] and God's not an Indian giver he won't
[40:22] give it to you and knowing you're going
[40:24] to lose it
[40:25] if you get the new birth you're gonna
[40:27] start
[40:28] you might not hit first you're going to
[40:29] stumble and follow your child that's
[40:31] right
[40:32] but you're going to gravitate towards
[40:34] the things of God
[40:36] because surely we gravitated toward the
[40:39] things of the world before we started
[40:41] but now if we and even if we are still
[40:44] doing some of the things of the world
[40:46] you understand what I'm saying yes
[40:48] there's a check there there's something
[40:50] that's saying you're guilty of that yes
[40:54] and you feel you feel bad to me I felt
[40:56] bad even though I didn't say that I felt
[40:58] bad but then I then I was crying
[41:02] actually going down the road saying well
[41:03] thank you God
[41:04] I know that part's over with all right
[41:07] say and I won't have to worry about that
[41:09] again because if God will ever check you
[41:11] one time he'll check you the second time
[41:13] with her whatever he'll keep you from
[41:15] that now there's a lot of those things I
[41:16] need but that one thing I'm sure you're
[41:19] not going to say well I slipped up and
[41:21] said a bad word the other day no I don't
[41:22] I don't agree with that but
[41:35] tech support
[41:37] and you got on your side I'm too blessed
[41:39] to be stressed so when you pick up the
[41:42] phone you're so Grandma will answer the
[41:43] phone
[41:44] and so you start you listen to the
[41:46] person talking what's going on because
[41:48] I'm not going to get angry I'm going
[41:49] this is what I have to say I need to
[41:51] listen when you're listening so wait a
[41:53] minute please
[41:53] uh you called me for a problem once you
[41:57] decide if you have a problem call me
[41:59] back thank you hang up your phone and
[42:02] then you start talking to God you know
