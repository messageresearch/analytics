========================================

okay we're online good morning good morning morning uh let's uh let's open that the Ser with prayer Lord we thank you for this day Lord we're a very needy people Lord there's a lot of people there sick just uh by your stripes they are healed especially we pray for sister seding and brother seding they having a hard time Lord that they're little boy and her still not doing very good so we pray for her and we just pray for all the ones here just help me what I have to do is say this morning I ask in Jesus name amen uh Second Corinthians 12 starting the first first verse chapter second Corinthians 12 1 he said is not expedient for me thess to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knows such in one and one cut up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in body or L of the body I cannot tell God know it how that he was cut up into the into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such and one will I Glory yet on myself I will not Glory but in M infirmities the kind of Lord is the Lord is kind of putting me in all kinds of different ways so I really don't know I'm probably going to be jumping back and forth here and uh when when when I passed this paper about the dimensions I saw a place where brother said there's uh there's uh after after set all the dimensions he said there was uh three going down yeah below below this the spirit he said below this there's three going down and three going up and uh I want to thank Brother Joseph for the quote that I've been looking for said God perfect in his church he says look he said the first thing when you here when you're going out of this line now get this straight here's where Mortals live a whole conation is Blackness and darkness and there is light little lights place now and then this Christians Born Again of light ye are your light that is set in a hill a candle that is set in a room and gives light to all the room that's what a Christian is among Darkness you're supposed to shine where it's dark now notice the wicked and the believer is influenced from beneath there is a trinity of hell like there's a trinity of Heaven that's why he couldn't understand because he was Paul that's caught in the third heav they're influenced by evil Powers now the first thing when you start down you find there a RM here that's got the unsaving it that's right that's where Jesus went and preached to the souls that were in prison they repented not in the Longs suffering the days of no the next is demons and the next is Hell itself the world is influenced by these demon powers through this Trinity and the Christians are influenced by a spirit too the Holy Spirit now the firstly the holy Holy Spirit above for Christians the next the layer is angels and the next Heaven is in God Holy Spirit angels and God the Holy Spirit come pass Angels come down to redeem sinners now what that woman done she only broke into the rim of them dead men a sinner does doesn't die I mean cease to exist when he goes out of this life he goes into a place of chains of Darkness and when the Christian dies now after the death of Jesus he did go into Paradise but when Jesus died he took away paradise and he goes in the presence of of God now notice like Jesus if you could get it this way look at here when Jesus died looked at him when he come people were captured they they were they were in doubts they were all SED up they didn't know what to do Satan had a Reign Over them and when Jesus come because the blood of bulls and Golds would take away sin Jesus come to give his own life that his own blood would take away his sins let's get a little picture here a minute I can see when Jesus when he come onto the Earth my what a person he was he was born according to the will of God he was for ONN by God and he came in the time of God and the will of God to do the will of God and the Hebrews 42 he said say yes no Jehovah Witness of friend i' like to ask you about that see if hell is a place like I say I don't know why God is kind kind of going towards hell so I'm going all over the place so Hades chill whatever you wish to call it if that seizes at the grave then why did he say I not leave my soul in Hell neither will I ser for the Holy One to seek corruption how about that see here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also and was witnesses to them they repented not in the long suffering he in other words he knocked at the door and when the door swung open and all those Souls that repented said I'm the seed of the woman I'm the one that en here over in Paradise another place don't never lose them three places now the place of the wicked the place of the righteous and held sh just like a trinity of Heaven like Father Son and Holy Ghost like the Trinity of the Beast the false prophet the Beast and the mark of the beast and all that remember it's all in Trinity trity makes one perfect one is perfect you're perfect one in three soul body and spirit water blood and nerves see whatever you was you have to take three to to make a perfect one take a three corner piece of glass and put the sun on it and you got a perfect rainbow see everything you have to have three to make it perfect this is the same message and con on the bottom says oh there's people in eternity tonight out in Hell screaming if you we could walk and pull open the gate like this and let you look down there I'll never have to make much of an altar call they would be screaming and climbing over one another for the opportunity but they have passed Beyond the Veil and Beyond Mercy it's too far they can never be redeemed they're gone forever they will never never never be redeemed they had the same opportunity that you have you wouldn't want to take their place tonight would you so why not take the place at the right right hand of Christ This is a little little off the I heard some people talking on the radio but uh Angels you know and uh they were talking about the fourth dimension and he was kind of right he said uh television is in the in the fourth dimension but then he said every time you turn the channel it means you're another another dimension so that 1 2 3 four how many dimensions by brother saying there's fourth dimension he didn't say all those dimensions and then this this is this is really I mean the people on the world have it right but they're I think they're a million miles off right they were talking about angel he said the the word sarapin comes from the word Serpent and he said the there the serin skin is kind of like a the way the snake It's kind of you know anyway he said and and he also said that Brother D was talking about this uh last week about the flying saucers he said the Angels live in the center of the universe and they take some kind of spaceship to get back over there he said even Jesus when he was send into heaven he used some kind of spaceship but then he talks about Elijah uh 2 Kings 2 verse he says that Elijah was carried on a you want to look it up yeah yeah which kind of makes you think a little bit you know but but yet like I said there're still a mile million miles off did they say anything about Enoch second second king chapter 2 2 to 11 it said it came to pass they still went on and T that behold there appeared a Char of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both s Elijah went up by World R into heaven so like I said they got had a clue but I mean that's still like a million miles off a clue what is a vision brother said when Jesus raised Lazar from the grave it was far more of a miracle than what the woman was that touched that touched His Garment and was healed of the blood issue you admit that he never said one word about getting weak and virtue going out of him because God was using his gift there is those kind of vision that is a type of vision but when people use the gift to God what makes me weak at the platform he says you yourself that's what's is doing it you your yourself or doing the work uh operating it that's the reason is pulling through it's either you using God's gift or God using his gift in the uncertain sound brother say and when This Woman's Soul catches up with her and she said my God I'm lost and they think oh it's Delirious they shoot a hypo in the needle into her and she begins to numb off she can't speak no more she's trying she's rolling she's in agony and the doctor said give her the other one deaden her until the dead Angel sweeps her spirit from her but that hypon needle might deaden the flesh it might deaden the mind but it can't deaden that soul that knows is seen before God it hunt her through ceaseless ages and through eternity that Soul was still hunt and hunt and Hunt as the ages roll on now some Pastor will come up to the woman and say well our dear beloved sister she was such a loyal member in our church she came every sabath day she helped the poor she helped the needy she done all these things today she's in glory but if the truth was only known as out in a hunting place place called hell that soul that separated from her on the earth she listened to an uncertain sound and she went off into eternity without knowing god without knowing Christ as the new birth she believed it in her heart she believed it in her mind she thought she was right but she was wrong it's your soul what it does oh God have mercy yeah every time we go to funerals I feel bad because you know you don't know the people that passed away whether they know God or they don't you know would say oh yeah well everybody say oh yeah he's going to be in heaven you know he it was a good person or something the faith of Abraham brother said and I can see when that obedient son when he died he went over there and knocked on the gates of of the souls that were in prison that repented not the long suffering days of Noah all Abraham then was waiting for that promise and when he knocked on the door and all those wretched maybe at one time beautiful people back in the HS of hell he screamed and said I he Hallelujah I'm he that was prophesied by Enoch that should come and I done it I fulfilled F every promise that was made of me and I'm God's sacrifice Don across there he went to the gates of hell when he went to hell devil said ah said here you are I thought I H you when I killed Abel I Almost sure I had you when I killed John the Baptist and all these others but said now I got you you're here I got you I can see him reach over and get the Devil by the neck and said Satan you've been a buff for a long time H Allelujah but I'm the Virgin born Son of God the sin question is over my blood is still waiting calvary's cross Y and the father has accepted it you got no right to hunt and fool people anymore so give me them keys of death in hell I'm taking over down there slapped him over to one side and slammed the door in his face started back up there was another group sitting over there yonder waiting of that righteousness in Paradise I can say I don't know why God's going this way now that Trump giv an uncertain sound brother said and as soon as Satan got around eeve he began to reason with her now surely surely God won't do that the people say to their there's not no such thing as as hell a lot of a lot of them tell them that they say oh surely God wouldn't hurt would burn his children certainly he doesn't burn his children but the devil will his whose child are you that's the next thing hell was created for the devil and his children not God's children not one of them is going there that's right it depends on Whose child you are said from that time on said you pass by that church and you hear the people singing gospel song you really want to go in but oh my you light up another cigarette and shake your head what are you trying to do you're fighing your way into right through every barricade he said same thing he said God doesn't send you to hell you send yourself to hell right break every barricade run every stop like trying to make sure make yourself go to hell and then say that God's good I won send you to hell you're sending yourself to H to Hell God sends nobody to hell it was created for the devil and his angels not for you but you fight your way right into it men and women do people say you make too much noise this is the quietest place you will ever live in if you go to heaven even angels are singing day and night night holy holy holy unto the Lord if you go to hell it's weeping and wailing and nashing your teeth this is the quietest place you'll ever be the message part said when man sinned in the garden of Eve he crossed a great Chasm separating himself from the Eternal one man at that time was eternal with God he had no sickness sorrow or death man was not made to die hell was not made for man hell was created for the devil and his angels not for mankind because they were created on Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God but when God with man but when man sin and stepped across the boundary line between right and wrong he separated himself from God leaving himself no way back he was totally lost he could not come back because he had sinned but God rich in Mercy accepted a substitute because he had said the day you eat thereof the day you die God's justice and his Holiness requires dead because it's his word and he must keep his word in order to be God the message why he had to be Shepherd but said sin came in a moment by a transgression of God's law by breaking one word tonight my brethren your soul is over in Hell on a chain and that chain is not some Theological Seminary teaching that chain is not some denomination or some Creed that you're living by that chain is God's word Jesus gave the human race his word to live by and he only broke one little link of it any chain is no stronger than his weakest link when you take the word out that was the first of the book Jesus came in the middle of the book and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God that's the middle of the book The Last of the book he said whosoever shall take one word Miss Mist translate one word take one word out of here I will take his name part from The Book of Life you're passing over hell hanging on the word of God don't you let somebody squeeze something into you that that's not thus say the Lorden yes he was talking about angels I I think I have an angel too me driving a big old tractor trailer in Atlanta so and I don't have no serpent sitting right next to me you know one time I was coming on 285 I was getting 85 north and it was kind of wet and slickery so I got on there and boom the St trailer a jack knife so I I HD my brakes and I was going the same way he was going but the little words said let your foot off the break and as soon as I did I straightened up and I just went so we all have Angels like the children of God angels brother Dale and brother way listening to a tap yesterday from 1962 on evangelism and uh brother brandom said that when you're born you're born you have a guardian angel right there when you're born and I don't think I don't think they have a little spaceship to go whever they have to go no I don't think believe they I I I think like I don't know said I'm not going to say you quot but he said we can uh travel like a thought right right right don't quote me because I don't have the quote I like to have Pro an exposition of the seven Church ages said we all know that the second death is the Lake of Fire and and dead and hell were cast into the lake of far this is second de of course that means all those who were there were cast in the Lake of Fire well then there might be those who say that eternal life signifies their welfare the children of God it is their welfare and enjoyment that is a state on the other hand The Sinner go to his punishment so that we can reduce the second death to a matter of punishment and place eternal life means heaven and eternal punishment means hell you would be surprised at the man who have been exalted as theologians that believe that but do you know what that does it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person eternal life is God the Lord Jesus Christ how anyone could believe such a thing that eternal life is a matter of place is more than I know it makes me stagger to think of it I don't let anyone say that I don't believe in the Lake of Fire and in punishment I do I don't know how how long it will last but it will eventually be removed it says that those Sinners mention will have their part in the Lake of Fire but the true interpretation of the word is not part but it is time see there you have it so the Wicked the wicked shall be cast into hell Hades or the grave and H into leg of fire separated from God what a terrible thing that will be the Mage what does here like the old color woman said down in the sou she had an she had an accident a car hit her and it hurt her pretty bad and the lawyer said do you want to sue for damages this is a really good she said lordy lordy Mercy noan he said I had enough damage he said I want some repair I thought that was Prett and I think she spoke well for this community and this church tonight and this Hellbound America it a it ain't backsliding it's already gone it ain't on the road to hell it's already met help it isn't lost or going to be lost it's already lost lost it doesn't need to sue for damages it needs to repair it's the truth right wow that's strongly he said in 19 we're going by head yeah we going by head you got time you know he said in in that message yesterday in 1962 that that Rome was already in the White House Kennedy got elected he said it's done okay we we were talking to Joseph last time then we're going to finish up a little bit on on Joseph it still take us forever to finish that after he after he told the dream to the Butler and the the baker he was still in jail two years uh Janice said is 41 chapter 41 Genesis 41 411 Genesis 411 I was kind of kind of paraphrased it a little bit but I started working on this other stuff and the Lord kind of threw me the other way all works he said he can't pass at the end of twofold years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up of the river seven well favor K and fat flesh and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other king came up after them out of the river ill favor lean flesh and stood by the other king upon the brink of the river and the ill favor and lean flesh can did eat up the seven well favored and fat kin so Pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven years the corn came up upon one one sto Rank and good and behold seven thin years and blly with the East Wind sprung up after them and the seveners the V the seven Rank and full years and Pharaoh woke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his Spirit was trouble and he sent and called for All The Magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them into Pharaoh then spec the Sheep Butler into Pharaoh saying I do remember my fault after two years he remember his fault that Joseph told him his dream he said Pharaoh was brought with his servant and put me in a warden the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief Baker and we dream and dream in the one night and he and I and he we dream each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was there with us a young man a Hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him interpret to us our dreams to each according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass that he interpret to us and so it was me He restored unto my office and him he hung then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him hly out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his rayment and came into pharaoh and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have a dream I have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee that thou can understand a dream to interpret it and Joseph answered Pharaoh said is not in Me God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace and Pharaoh said unto Joseph in my dream behold I stood upon the bank of the river and behold they came out of the river seven King fed fled and well favored and they fed in the middle he talks about the same thing right there let's go to 25 and Joseph said unto Pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good King are seven years and seven good ears are seven years the dream is one and the Seven thin and Ne favor kin that came up after them are seven years and that seven empty years left bled with a wind shall be seven years of famine this is this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh what God is about to do he showed unto Pharaoh we we don't have time we have to cut it off you
