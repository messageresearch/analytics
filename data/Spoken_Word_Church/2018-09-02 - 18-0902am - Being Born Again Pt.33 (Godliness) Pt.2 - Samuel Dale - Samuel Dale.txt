TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right that's the best way to put it I guess I don't Trump you know where I know we're having a lot of problems with our system and trying to get all of it worked out I know that may not have them to do what they're doing but we do have that with a lot of things in the system that's messed up and trying our best to correct it but I would I would suggest that you listen to the services last night and you might find some things that would be very interesting that I have known one point for a long time withholding it to her that Hebrews 1140 if you place it to only the Old Testament in Hebrews 1140 you're missing the whole story you got to bring it from the Old Testament and then divide it just a little and bring it into the New Testament if you don't you're just gonna say well only the Old Testament is made perfect and there is a doctrine now there is a doctrine out there and if I call the name you would be amazed but that's all right there's a doctrine out there that the Old Testament Saints was perfected by Jesus Christ and that would be without us they cannot be made perfect but the New Testament would have to be perfect by the bride of Jesus Christ well I don't agree with that now it can't be you and me perfected nobody when it says they without us cannot be made perfect I've preached it over and over to you that word perfect means complete are finished we'll get to that in the message describing it it has nothing to do with any perfection it has nothing to do with with anything in relation to how good you are it has to do in relation to how good he is to keep his word the Old Testament Saints were dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ the New Testament is dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ but worse the blood in the bride now you got it right now without us you cannot be made perfect they nobody can be brought into the correct order of completion not to raise somebody and preach to them and make them perfect or are they do it now no it's in completion or you know wrote it to the finish the seventh seal to the end of all things all right now so just read that I mean listen to that and go through it okay any other announcements next week in the Lord willing awaiting them will be all going to Alabama and we will be here the Lord willing and we will be ministering both services and then Wade will be taking the next weekend to come up to her called we will be leaving this not today but next weekend we'll be leaving to go on a little vacation for a few days and then we'll be back at the end of the week but bringing that the Lord willing and brother Bob will be ministering this coming Wednesday and then we'll go ahead and put on let's see that would be brother Lewis to fall in to the next week okay so you got it this coming Wednesday brother Bob the next windy with brother Louise coach we will be gone during that period of time and but waiting then we'll be here so just get every week right and get everything that going okay all right father we thank you for your grace in your love thank you for everything and we pray that you would just bless us now with understanding that our eyes Lord may be open to you and your word that we may walk in the light of your grace forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in the light of your understanding that we may see you Lord and you just come among us and manifest yourself in a mighty way as to your little Bride of Christ to bring us to that place of perfection that a resurrection can be brought we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you in Jesus name Amen so we're still on first Peter 1 verse 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright then we go over to 2nd Peter 1 verse 1 Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God in our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so were we call to we're called to glory our glorification right we're called a glorification and virtue which is the strength the power the matching things so we're called to that all right now we are the last ones in the group now others are called to their position but we are called to finish the whole thing up because they without us cannot be made perfect whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge and their knowledge temperance the temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word so we've we spent some time trying to talk about you know the stature of a perfect man Peter and it's reading you know you know and trying to bring it to a place to see what God has been you know trying to make manifest among us okay and we know that we brought out in the past couple of messages a little quote from the Prophet off the statue of a perfect man talking about the church and how that it must come to these virtues all right see now if you possess these things then it's a possession but if you're confessing it it's just a confession people can read anybody can read second Peter but it's only written to those that are in Christ Jesus who have the new birth to start with the Bible is not written to a sinner it can only tell a sinner that they're lost it is written to the born-again believer cause the born-again believers only one that can comprehend it you know or know what it's doing so that should be a wonderful thought in itself to think of what God thinks of you and I to give us the entire Bible and that's what we've tried to talk about the faith of the father's the statue of a perfect man Peter nem had these virtues all right and they made it manifest in their time and they wrote the word right but see then it was lost down through the ages and it's so hard to try to follow a lot of times on the losing of it until we thought we know they didn't lose it then you never lost the new birth the new birth was in every age it was never an age without the new birth I don't care what you think of what it's doing or whatever well they didn't have this they didn't have that they had the new birth all right because they had the morning in experience all right they had to faith that's why I said that life's not about Peter I mean the Paul in talking to those that were dire you know they without us cannot be made perfect you look at all of those down through there I'm just encouraging you to listen to that because you look at although by faith Paul I'm by faith Abraham by faith nor by faith Moses by faith by faith by faith and then we say one of the faith is a new birth well look at that they all had a new birth no they didn't they didn't have the new Berko Jesus Christ had not died they had faith for the time and that was enough to hold them in the position under the blood of Jesus Christ right they had faith for the time of what they were doing but it doesn't mean just because you read something look like that fight that's what I'm talking to you about these virtues see we read the verses we get a definition of wording and we think we'll look they had this they had to had no no it's not there without the new birth understand the new birth first look that's the most important thing in our lives to understand what it is to be born to you well I believe the message praise God so does the devil now does that make you any different if the devil believed it and I like the scripture goes with it said the devil believed in trembled he trembled about what he believed it it made him afraid of what he could read in the Word of God or know about the Word of God alright let's see we've got to come to these things in other words to bring the prophet said to bring a rapture all is dependent on you and I all right and it's dependent on us to come to a place to bring that rapture back to the faith they had all right see then as to that then we read to from the statute of perfect man that the prophet said that there'd be no resurrection all right there's no rapture without these virtues because that rapture means chain that son died down through the ages that did not have the full amount of virtues and things right but they're not held accountable for that but in the end time is going to be held accountable that we all come to the place of these virtues well I didn't know we had to have it you know it now well I don't know any cuz I did heard you say that well you're gonna be responsible that's a white throne judgment if that's where you're standing because you're gonna answer for that statement wherever who it is to bring the Word of God and we don't believe it you're gonna stand at that throne throne to answer for what you heard if a dumb donkey tells you the truth you got to believe it right so then that that that don't put it into a place well I don't have to believe it cuz well you don't have to believe it cause I say it but when I read what he says now you're gonna have to answer so he said the church would have to possess these qualities before they could be a rapture the church would have to possess these things before there could be a resurrection because somebody's got to call the dead out of the ground and see we we look at it in the wrong respect I wish you would get simple sometimes and think about the things that what we're trying to say and just simply think about it you realize that this is talking this morning about it do you realize that the world is dependent upon you to come to the possession of these qualities not just talk about them but to come to it that's why we're here fifty years after the Prophet left us thing God's waiting on you and I now if that's true then where do we have the right to play around dilly-dally and not walk it in the word okay all right but now listen if you possess these qualities you got to see the whole stature of your being and quoting from the statute of perfect man paragraph 357 the whole stature of your being is governed governed and controlled by these things but it cannot be completely controlled till it completely possesses these qualities now you listen to that statement the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things these virtues but it cannot be completely controlled until it is completely till it completely possesses these qualities so what's God waiting on you and a huh to do what to possess these qualities to have what he has provided all right we've been over and over and over God didn't leave us if he requires us to how something what did the Prophet say it's his responsibility to provide the way for us to receive that okay it's up to him if he requires us to be perfect it's up to him to meet the requirement but it's up to you and I to receive what is done and how are we to receive these virtues this mission of Malachi for that 17:30 revelation 10 7 do too tight turn hearts of the children back to the faith and fathers the reveal the thunders which is revelation containing the seven seals and there will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts by 327 church age book he just told us how to get it how see that's what we were trying to do and we'll get down to it in a minute how are we to get these things if God supplied it then how are we to receive it well I don't have to depend on nobody else I got it myself okay go ahead see he says if you say well I got this I got that and he said if you don't have these things he said dollars worth she breaks you remember that but the chain is strongest at its weakest link darhk's work breaks and if we don't have these things in incompletions and what do we got when you're surrendered your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues and then you are a living Tabernacle a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there's a Christian is scanning down when a man or woman possesses this now you want to know what's gonna bring the headstone to the church is it taught by everybody that there's got to be a headstone to the church we're all taught it down through time and everything you're talking about a headstone what did he say okay when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and seals you into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost right he said well we need to headstone heart how do we get it we got to come through these qualities first well we don't have to have that to go that's what your prophet said it would take that person to go in the rapture he said it would take that person he said to bring the resurrection 367 statue a perfect man these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us and so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and thereunder souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come until the church in the minority gets to into a place until it's the same kind of ministry to dis left because when the headstone comes by what's it to be when Christ unites with a church and how or what is what is the reason for him to you're not with a church he's reuniting with his own being right I thought we were two houses versus I thought these virtues was his purchase I didn't know it was our virtues human people have great virtues that are good people right but that ain't nothing talking about statue of perfect man this is not talking about your virtue in my version he's talking about diversity of Jesus Christ that he has given unto us because that he promised it all right what are we waiting on the What did he say from well I'm against organized religion if what is supposed to the church what is purposed to the church the life that was in Christ now listen isn't refracting in you don't you stand deal unto you and we've got patients virtually all these things in temperature thing and godliness brotherly kindness to these things are we seeking after these virtues no no we don't have to have this we're just ready for the rapture how do you get ready for the rapture if these virtues are required to bring a resurrection why should we we looking for something else to bring the resurrection other than this message to be revealed to you and me are made alive in our hearts and lives why would we not want the word to be true God has given us all of these things and told us how that it would take place do we believe the messenger has brought the message within us these things that will bring that to Pais that he has brought unto you and I we don't have to look for something else well I just don't I don't think we're what we needed we need a whole lot more emotions brother Dale praise God but now how much do you want me to read if you've read the statue of a perfect man if you haven't don't talk to me about it is that plain enough I've asked you probably thirty times in this series to read the statute of a perfect man if you hadn't done don't talk to me about perfection don't talk to me about Christianity don't talk to me about anything if you're not going to study the word I'm trying not to give you my idea I'm trying to read what he says I'm asking you to read what he says but if you refuse to read what he said don't think that God's coming back after you is that plain enough proposal Rep so that's one we don't like you because you just might I make it straight and playing if you don't like it that's up to you but is it the truth if you've read the statue of a perfect man you realize these things these virtues are required and if they're required why would not we want well brother bill then how do we get it the Prophet told you how to get it by studying the message he said it would be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn us back then why would not people want the thunders and the seals and the things we're afraid to get confused honey don't worry about getting confused we was born confused don't worry about that the thing we need to worry about is trying to get rid of our confusion right well I don't like that because I've always been I've always believed the message yeah you don't want to talk to me then okay you don't want to talk to me about it because that's there's no need enough for none of it but now listen what did we get to the life thing now of what we were talking about last Sunday there that we were talking about coming to godliness and what is godliness well brother Brennan said godliness that he looked for the dictionaries and about four or five of them till he finally found the definition like I was saying I've listened already twice this week to that same message so I know what I said Sunday okay you say well I didn't hear you say that well I don't listen to it twice I mean times if you listen to but you see godliness is to be like God why would brother branham say he couldn't find the definition of godliness in a dictionary when you pick up any dictionary and it's got the word godliness in it right have you looked in the dictionary and to see it's got godliness in it but it was not the definition that he was knowing would fit this in the stature of a perfect man godliness in the natural or the wording is to be Pais or to be like you know being God night here or this it's got that to do with it well when the prophet brought it he said if godliness is to be like God well don't worry about being pious and things like that you're not gonna be in any way its to be like God as to how his nature in his ways to where the world can see God in you and me well what do they see what do they think of you at work what do they think of you is your neighbors what do they think of you oh they think we're just a bunch of calls well you know what I don't blame a lot of people for thinking the people of this message or cause because I think they are I've told you over and over I believe the fivefold ministries for the perfecting their science but they said a lot of people that claim to be preachers I don't care about listening to because they're not bringing God's Word so their bio how time to fool with them well brothers l if you listen to until lately no I've done heard too much about all of them times like I said I don't try to bring out things to make deliberately to her but I do hear enough until I can express something to you you know I try to have a decent memory and we're doing it like not waste promised to get me a copy of what was doing life not I've always tried to that adoption was not a thing that the Jews come up with they didn't come up with it the Romans and the Greeks and things come up with the adoption and when the Israelis went under captivity to him they took a lot of those things into their own understanding I said that all along trying to get you to look at the things different whoa no no worry well let us we'll find it because he's somewhere back down through there I heard that I might have heard that in the Baptist Church because you know what we studied adoption when I was in the Baptist Church that's one you you can take brother branham do once you want to he said you better leave him Baptists alone he said they'll tear you apart with the word now that's what he said so we studied the Bible I knew for I left the Baptist Church that being born again been a process of development I knew like I'd ran out the other day where the Bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be say I could read that in the Baptist Church where was you at I'm talking to the ministers of the time who bless God we don't know no you're sitting back are being deceived it's like it is now but what does godliness mean why would a prophet turndown dictionary definitions until he found the one he wanted just like I said why would he say virtue is not to this live a virgin life or be a virgin that didn't fit the terminologies or thoughts it's being portrayed in the stature of a perfect man for virtue that means power or strength or God's own life a virtuous life not just a virgin you me a virgin be mean it's rattlesnake that's not what he's talking about see your profit then was taking what God was showing him that these virtuous men when he come to temperance our definition is what don't drink alcohol he said that ain't got nothing to do with what we're talking about on this he said it doesn't come to that he said it's that uncontrollable temper for honey now don't it ain't got no temper your face gets red this is leaving me for this a little bit I'll cross you know if it's gonna work the face red or something right sorry but it's true the then we come to those definitions it took a prophet to get the correct definition of what the stature of a perfect man was talking about natural man could read that but he gets the wrong definition so why did he come up with godliness and say well it doesn't mean to be pious it doesn't because the word garland listen you know deals with those forms to our natural understanding but godliness is to be like God you know what it means to be like God is to have the nature of God right the nature of God is to be like God and godliness see then lays it onto the basis that what I love is what your prophet had to say and I've brought this out and I told you that for months I waited to bring last Sunday's message I'm just saying it and you can do what you want to because you're not anyway how many of these listen to life Sunday service over when I told you that I waited four months to bring that I've done listen to it twice and almost I don't believe you're gonna listen to it I understood what you say you did you understood what I was just saying come on say brother branham said when he talks about godliness he said you've come all this way before God expects you to be perfect come on bring it up number five brothers it's natural perfect man let's just read what your prophet had to say about a few thought and what's this point you get genuine faith genuine virtues you and one another Tim you're moving right on up the line all right fearfully add Garland it's oh my now godliness is six but a random is capable of incorrectly giving numbers that's all right he just human all right fearfully add godliness oh my god leanness to be added what does God in this mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant are you listening he says he couldn't find what it meant whenever different that ever dictionary has the definition of godliness but it was not the definition he was looking for it was not what Peter were talking about as godliness in the stature of a perfect man that form of godliness is man's understanding this is a prophet giving you what God has decided that's where I love it he said he was down in two brothers and he found in a dictionary godliness means to be like guard oh my after and once actually you got faith virtue and all the temperance in place didn't be like God after you've got these things didn't be like God you understand what I'm saying we say oh I just I just get this anywhere I want to see I just needed verse I need knowledge so I don't worry about having virtue you know how no place to put your knowledge if you don't have virtue you mean I can't have knowledge for yeah you can have knowledge first head knowledge you ain't gonna get Holy Ghost knowledge of the true understanding of the Word of God until you get Holy Ghost virtue and you're not gonna get Holy Ghost virtue of the true Holy Ghost until you get Holy Ghost nuber that's where you're studying Paul the man said to him Paul you're much studying has made you my head and that's true if that's all you've got his man's ideas so listen Bert you're not even didn't be like God you say I can't do that brother branham he said oh yes you can I can't be like God he says oh yes you can that's what your prophet said so it's possible to be like God but not the kind that we bring we think of godliness is the past of this daddy I don't drink I don't you I don't smoke at home so I'm like God that ain't what it's talking about it's talking about the reason you don't drink smoke and Jude is what makes you to be like God cuz there's an inward work right come on now watch him you say I can't do that okay but he says now let's read you a few scriptures now he's talking about how to be like God now how are we to be like God brother branham how are we to be like God that's what he said right we say we can't do it he said oh yes you can you can be like God if you have the right understanding of ugliness if you have the wrong understanding of it you'll never be like God so you listen to his understanding if we won't trust him about bringing us words and understand why can't we trust him on the whole thing what's the very scripture he goes to when he's talking about being like God or does he go just let you read a few scriptures here just a minute Matthew 5:48 will take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God according to Matthew 5:48 right so let's meet Matthew 5:48 to see if we're supposed to be like God see you know the Bible says you're gods jesus said so one all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you there's a new birth there's growth development of the statue of a perfect man it's getting him in us it's not us in him it's him in us right now listen why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you Matthew 5:48 well we are only read Matthew 5:48 is we don't know how to be perfect we know the Bible says be is our four perfect but we can't be perfect nobody human is perfect you start talking to somebody right now just notice it you start talking about what god when we can't all be perfect you know we all got problems you know we all do wrong you know so nobody can condemn the other person because we're all in the same shape you hadn't heard that talking to people the Bible says we've got to be perfect now how are we going to be perfect listen to them be therefore perfect PE spelt it out what's that perfect even your father in heaven is perfect now this is what I love faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness now this is what I love you got way up here now before you're asked to do that to do what he just read B therefore perfect so you got all the way up to godliness before God expects you to be perfect come on church why don't you read so then that means at faith you're not at the perfection you need to be at virtue you still have problems did we go through that that it's not that it's the Verte not to virgin it's C in other words you look at the pyramid you come to godliness so that means there's problems in here that God needs to deal with oh but I don't have no temper brother Dale well the Bible says temperance and the Prophet said it's not to stop drinking alcohol he said it's that uncontrollable temper yeah but I don't have an uncontrollable temper I have you know I don't have no temper no no brother I didn't mean to say that way spitting all in your face what I'm saying is you need right I'm saying he needs ain't saying I need come on just be honest and be sensible don't you understand why would a prophet make a definition that you come all this way you got way up here before you're asked to be perfect so when you're born again as a baby he doesn't expect you to be perfect he's the advocate that takes care of all the time and when we come through that see we come all the way up to godliness now it's being required we're gonna get to some statements brother animate and then you'll see or either we'll get to them next Sunday they were what it takes but you got up here now before you're asked to be perfect God knows that your tempers is not right he knows your patience is not right he knows all of those things are not right right babies growing in grace and knowledge but by the time we come to godliness we ought to start thinking about perfection none of us can be perfect see forget it you're not even in the show you're still in the old Baptist that's what we've done we argued over the word perfection in the Baptist Church Matthew 5:48 was read in the Baptist Church as well as anywhere that where were you at we talked about it we had the definitions correctly I knew in the Baptist Church that the word perfect meant complete because I could read and I knew it had something to do with something that we wasn't gettin because agreed with you we cannot be perfect in ourselves there's no way we can be perfect that's why that brother Adam when he picked the word or the definition of godliness is to be like God he's not in no way referencing the how pious are the deity of God or that you're not supposed to be this are we're supposed to be good people we're supposed to do that the new birth is supposed to take care of those thing we should be those things but God knows we don't always fulfill them yeah with that brother Dale we just don't see these because you you all right you just go ahead and do what you want to of me I passed that fifty years ago what you think about me I'm sorry I don't want it to be I don't want you to think wrong about me but there's one thing I'm gonna do is tell the truth whether you believe it or not I'm gonna tell it like it is I'm gonna read what he says I didn't make that statement he said you got up here now before you're asked to do what to be perfect you come to garland that's before you're asked to be perfect so it's not trying to be good and good and good no it's to be like God as to how these virtues what did we read right above the all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you so how are you made perfect by accepting what he has done for you and I gives us the new birth and he comes and lives in us and brings forth his virtues these are Holy Ghost virtues they're not just virtues of a man that's a good man a good person if Holy Ghost virtue see that's why when he come up with a definition of godliness he could see that we have troubles you know what brother when I got born again I had no trouble since then you just lied not enough like I said to our Wednesday night a woman asked her tobho you know they don't you pray for my tongue he said that's poor fit over 14 foot I think was the word of you he said if not long enough to get your tongue on your tongue longer than this pulpit that's pretty rough but was it the truth she admitted her tongue was her problem he was just analyzing how big it be take whole lot more than 14-foot right let's see if we think one well he would just be in a smarty because he had a bad tongue come on do what you don't but you got all the way up here and listen all these things has to be added first now look then when you get up here up her godliness when you get to godliness he's asked you now to be perfect godliness sons and daughters of God that's right to be perfect because as I said he knows that we've got problem with the virtues he knows we got I meant to stage about six months on that little word knowledge because God knows we've took her own knowledge that's not the knowledge of man that's the knowledge of God we've took her own knowledge to figure it out we're not going to listen to nobody out Scott we got her own understanding well how do you feel since that's fine but look he comes all the way up to godliness now he's telling the church that we need to be made perfect is that enough to verse to understand he's asked you you got all the way up here he's asked you now to be perfect and we're going to get to some things in here in a minute we're brother Branham cuz I've been over over it with you but Ron said the Holy Ghost has not been correctly taught did we teach it as the nuber we teach it as this we teaches is that we teach it but he said it's not been correctly told what's he mean we've got a statement right in here that will read it for how time brother Branham says you come up here to godliness and he said you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet that's what he said are we gonna believe what does he meaning you see that's where I don't worry about my job I don't worry about the fivefold ministry I don't worry about my job as a minister because see I know what my job is then when you read that the Prophet said we got all the way up here to godliness and we ain't got the Holy Ghost here you realize what kind of doctrines that started they've started an O Holy Ghost doctrine that the world is deceived by to believe you ain't got the Holy Ghost that ain't what the prophets talking about well he said it that's true but what do you think he's talking about I think he's talking about just what he's saying you come all this way up to godliness now God expects you to be perfect which is complete he expects you to start coming into a completeness not a perfection of daily lives those things should have been taken care of in our new birth now I am NOT talking about somebody living like the devil lying cheating stealing all kind of things murderers adulterers and things like that that ain't what he's talking about in here that we have problems with if we have problems with adulteries and things like that we need the new birth if we have troubled with adult reason and fornication we need the new birth it is not that well God overlooked sometimes now he just knows we're gonna have them well they don't matter about me being a little bit I got a little bit of temper I know but everybody's got a little bit well what does that justify does that make it okay right everybody picking on Trump because Trump got this from my dad and we got right to me that do you understand what I'm getting there he said we've come all this way now God expects us to be perfect okay now how does he expect perfection to come I ain't gonna ask him it was here like Sunday I don't want to ask this two simple question don't raise your hand just leave it down because you don't want to get trapped but how many of you call to order are the layout of last Sunday that would bring the church to perfection just don't raise your hand don't cuz they don't need to but just admit in your own mind well I didn't really hear anything about it well at least you're being honest so you can be on that side with God I don't remember what you say it well that's all right just don't lie to yourself you know you know you're not going to deceive nobody lying to yourself only yourself right so just be honest and say I was I didn't understand would you please explain it again how are we going to become to the point of being perfect we know it's not talking about perfect as of godliness type of a form of deities or lives or sinless perfection it will never happen it is whether or not we can rest in him for what had I'd rather have a perpetuation for my sins than to have no sin at all it's over you're strong I'm strong I draw the note that I got something to cover it then to not know whether I got anything at all let me at least how the perpetuation for my sins let me keep it that away all right go ahead come on let's read a little bit further now I gave you this last Sunday I think that you know that's what comes up be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven now what does that word perfect mean what does that word perfect we've got to be perfect what does it mean so you're gonna go to a sinless perfection or some great thing to be what does it mean here's your definition the definition of the word perfect is a full age bra to its end now see if you can find anything in here to make us good wanting nothing necessary to completeness you know what I'm saying in other words there's not anything to be added to this to make it whatever it is it's gonna make us perfect okay be nothing added to it huh it's not me and you added see that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full-grown adult of full age was there anything of the word perfect that has any definition of any sinless form because we think B therefore perfect even as a father in heaven is perfect well he didn't sin so we don't sin no he didn't sin but we are seeing you ever get to the point do you think you don't see in your the biggest center there is in the building can I be that way all right so then words any definition of perfection they would have anything to do with anything in our lives it's fully dependent upon a full-grown it's alright so now look you come all the way up through here God knowing you and how trouble with your faith your virtue your knowledge your temperance your patience and then when you come to godliness now he's knows that you're beginning to get to a state of being perfect because by then you've done realized God's taking care of it that is not my faith that's his faith given to me that is not my virtue that is his virtue given to me that is not my knowledge that's his knowledge given unto me right that's the only way I can have a perfection is what he imparts not what I do or don't do come on you want to go with the rich young ruler what did he say what did Jesus say to him when he said if anything I can do didn't hurt the kingdom jesus said don't do this don't do that do this do that do this he said I've done every one of them from my youth now Jesus never argued with him and said now wait a minute now you done this over here you pull this dirty deal here he agreed with him he never thrown off on him he said the only thing I see wrong with you you need to sell what you got and give it to the poor because he knew where his heart was his heart was in his back pocket his money his money was worried heart was that and the love of money is a root of all evil money's not so then he understand for our understanding of the rich young ruler he was perfect in our eyes right because he didn't do he done what he was supposed to do and didn't do what he's supposed to not do he was perfect Jesus never said you're perfect he just hit him with one thing that he knew that would cross him he knew there was no need of arguing with him on a perfection because he had done these things what about the Apostle Paul naming all his life and said according to the law blameless you know God didn't come to him because of his blindness you know not being not being wrong he came to him because he predestinated it they knew what would take place and what Paul would be he never come to him because he was perfect don't you ever think you could be good enough to even be saved there's where the trouble is people tries to get good enough let's say if I could just quit all these things then God would save me that is not Bible there is no scripture for any of that the scripture is us to realize we're lost then God can do something about it but listen to be like God he goes to Matthew 5:48 right when he's covered to be like God he goes to Matthew 5:48 alright what's the next scripture well I don't do this and I don't do that under stage no no no he doesn't go to that what's the next scripture come on Jules you listening what's the next scripture that brother Branham used you're supposed to read the book you supposed to have been in the service life Sunday listening to what was saying what's the next scripture that he goes to come on run it up brothers he goes to Ephesians four where we don't want him to go is it all right now with all the choices you had brother branham why you're going to Asians for what's the seasons for how are you gonna become perfect how are you gonna become perfect how are you gonna match up Matthew 5:48 and be perfect how're you gonna do it the Prophet we just read are men to go take all these virtuous put it in the individual you've got God right what does he go to he goes to Ephesians 4 and find out over here what in the book of Ephesians it says about this thing what's the thing he's talking about being therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect let's go to Ephesians 4 to find out what it's about here in the book of Ephesians see what Ephesians says about this thing to be about how we should how we should do it how can we come to it in other words been seasons the 4th chapter and begin with the 12 verse alright let's begin here 2:11 her and he gave some apostles how are you going to be perfect now do we believe that a pastor minister of powerful ministry is to be the connection between God and man now there is a question I'm asking you you gonna shake your head and say you don't believe it now brother Branham is my connection between God and man that's what everybody says yeah well brother Browns not here no that's not derogatory or against anything he's not here so we can't go to him right how about the fivefold ministry how we gonna be made perfect and he gave some apostles and some prophets remember lies not don't take the other man's office he's on adoption right and some evangelists some pastors or some teachers for the perfecting of God does it read like that congregation says no the perfection of what who are the Saints the sanctified ones amen the ones that started from down here the ones that started that faith you say I don't depend on thoughtful okay forget it forget it if I ain't going to depend on the FIFO ministry I'll paint on cars and nobody I ain't gonna be into nothing I'm just gonna tell everybody forget it and see you can't pay you talk to a tape recorder you can only pay your tithe that where you get fed you're supposed to get fed from a pastor yeah but I don't believe that okay I'm no problem you believe what you want to ain't trying to do that I'm trying to get you to see one thing the truth will cut every one of us to pieces don't come to me then I don't believe this under don't come to me and don't let this now let's tell you forget it take your money and go on do what you want to I told the man the other day about money I said I give you a perfect right to take your money and put the house roof on the Widders house I've done that many times I've done it through this church so many times and not telling nobody just tell them say okay take this and do that we didn't do that as far as I'm concerned that's your tithe now you can't go do it yourself without my permission first off number one because you're doing of your own presumption would you come to me I'll give you a perfect right to go build a house for somebody you know long as it's right the because I don't care about you money I don't care about what you do in your life and your money and your doings that's between you and God because this church is gonna operate and God's gonna take care of it he always has without having to take an offering from the people right okay pull it back up to where we're at all right so he's going to her he's going to Ephesians forward what's Ephesians 4 he gave some apostles some prophets some pastors some evangelists what far what did he give it far what does it say in Ephesians he gave some apostles prophets teach what for the perfecting of the Saints the words their perfection any other way outside the fivefold ministry now you tell me that well I don't like your ad okay I don't like you either is that solve the problem we got to get into the popularity form you know we just leave it that way I like what he says then let me follow what he says voluntarily not because of a book of rules this got to be done look for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ for the edifying building it up edifying until till we come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and how are you gonna come that without the fivefold ministry if that's Christmas to the perfect man unto the assurance oh my to the measure of the stature how we're gonna come to the statute of perfect man it's gonna be through the fivefold ministry I don't have to have fivefold ministry I'll make it on my own okay well no problem I'm not gonna disown you or throw you out of the church because you don't believe what I say because it's up to God to reveal it to you anyway let's see that's where it's come to that point the ones that started down here continue on perfect takes godliness you have to add to your faith God in this see you start off down here with virtue yeah is that enough plain dumb well I went back and porn dad you say I don't leave brother branham didn't do that now blows around was doing it now because he's putting their virtue right you start down here with virtue then you go to knowledge then you go to temperance then you go to patience now your own godliness godliness oh my and my time is getting away but you know what godliness meant you sung it to be like God on so what now look what he says after he comes down after you done come from here to here to here to here to here to here now because he count them coming up okay now you're coming into the full stature now the son of God work at godliness because you're taking on his nature his ways you've gotten away from your own temperance and your own virtues and your own patience isn't that now you're going to go because that's when we hit the next one you're gonna hear me screaming holler that much more on brotherly kindness but brother Brennan said is not too bad to keeping an individual but he said to keep brotherly kindness in a group he said it's hard to do now you're coming into the full stature it now of a son of God but you've got to have this plus all this and you can't even start until you get this now what's he saying you got to have this you got to have this but you can't start until you get this you can't start till you get the new birth because that's what brings in the body get down here at genuine born again duh then you don't have don't add nothing it adds to you see come throwing up all right coming into perfection now we still got brotherly kindness and we got a little thing your prophet called the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's in the stature of a perfect man so you need to read you know I'm trying to encourage you to read what he says because that's what's good about it what he says is what I say now but what does he say all right he says you're birthed into this into this into this that's on blasphemous name so let's just read this one and then we're gonna stop cuz we're gonna make a flop and then we're gonna stop we're gonna give you a whole week to think over and get it all figured out what you think it is because what did he say now you know yourself blessing yes name statue of perfect man are the same thing that's a perfect man he did not describe the lady's dream he goes to blasphemous names to describe the lady's dream of what he taught in the stature of a perfect man so it's the same time so now here we're going to blast eNOS not to my knowledge I had temperance or self-control I like that my country tis of the crown my soul will self-control from sea to shining sea patience oh my tested don't you worry Satan will count them for you but look what he said I'm coming up the ladder now I've had adverse your knowledge temperance and now I got to add patience now as he named in it coming out and he said now I've got to add patience and what does he say I still ain't got the Holy Ghost now that sounds totally contrary to everything that he taught in the statute of perfect man and everything I've talked for 50 years is up on that basis that that statement that he made is right and when brother Branham say it the Holy Ghost is not correctly taught he makes no statement he said I ain't got the Holy Ghost yet I teach and believe this was brought up last night and I thank God for because off the message you must be born again brother Brennan said I teach and I believe and believe can sufficiently proved by the scripture that would be 10 11 12 if you're trying to bring it up they might already have it up there it would be like two more it's you must be born again I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently proved by the scripture that you are born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit I teach and believing can sufficiently prove by the scriptures that you're born again to the spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit how could that be how could that be because that sounds like two or three different things that sounds like brother Brennan was contrary to it believe that you're born to the spirit and then baptized into the bottle but I thought the baptism was the Holy Spirit I thought this was that I'm gonna say it and you ain't gonna like it that's why you gotta have a fire four minutes can I do this I trying to make myself to be one of them but you've got to have a five fold ministry to understand the things brother Brown and see it because some of the things he said or it's blind into the natural point as could ever be when he said I believe you are born again and then baptized into the body there's plenty of statements that brother running mate that sounds so wrong but yet are so right I say with him that I can prove other scriptures that you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit do we believe that I don't believe what he said to her well okay now are you gonna correct him and it's up to you just remember what you say is up to you you say I don't believe he's right there we'll show me why he's not right but I got all these other quotes are you saying that quote is wrong it sure does sound like it is then without a fivefold ministry to put it together you're still just as confused because remember what the powerful ministry is supposed to do take the things the prophets say it and break it down to the congregation come on musician break it down to the congregation if the fifo ministry is right and is for the perfecting of the saints according to the prophet of god then we have to depend upon the fivefold ministry no by dependence upon brother Branham upon what was he a prophet that was massively confused about the new birth when he says you believe unto eternal life you believe unto eternal life but then you're baptized into the body for the gifts of the time which is exactly right you see P don't want to say what brother branham said I like it like this was I've speaking of the ministers meeting with Salman and this brother he got up behind me he said there's one thing I don't like is when a guy gets up and asked the question and said he's the only one in the building that's got the answer because I when I asked the question I said come and explain it now come bring your understanding and explain it I was being as honest as I could I wasn't trying to be sarcastic or hateful I just made a statement brother I know mate I said come down and show me it's wrong they knew better than to get up and show that brother branham was wrong they wanted to get up and show I was wrong but there's afraid because I'd already caught him what he said and I wasn't saying this is what I say I said this is what the Prophet says now come up here and showed me the Prophet was wrong oh they weren't gonna do that what does that make you something yeah that makes me just hard to hit it enough to believe God's Word is right and hard-headed enough to know this message is right this message is perfect now the one that brought it had imperfections in his speech and in his errors and dates and times and parts because he was a human being but his message is right and I don't have to go to this message to this message to prove he's wrong he's right he just needs somebody to believe it and wait for God to give the answer to the truth that doesn't make it a statement then while they're getting ready on Daniel 70 weeks brother Branham says six or seven times that there's one week left after the rapture but the people is this message angle and quote that for nothing in the world are you gonna say he was seven times wrong because he's the one who made a statement no they threw it high for your threat - wait let me see he didn't say that you're correcting him next when you and Lord I've often said the devil don't need he's went on vacation when the pre pull of this message come up and started trying to follow and teach the message in their way the devil went on vacation because he don't need nothing he just goes off to itself and lets the people fight it out because that's all it's been is if I come on yet brother where we got what are you saying godliness is to be like God the greatest definition your prophet could give was all of these virtues within us but he said you could come all of this way before God expects you to be perfect you come all the way up to godliness now he expects you to be perfect you come up to godliness you can have an understanding your growth development starts in your understanding that you can follow what he's saying then you'll see why he said you're born again and then baptized into the body he said I don't believe that what are you saying the Prophet was wrong I'm saying he said what he wanted to say and what he said was the truth give you a whole week to think about the things brother Branham said that sounds so contrary if you'll just wait on God they'll come forth and the most beautiful picture that could ever be done now humanly speaking he made mistakes speech he made mistakes right that's not the message the next message he's not brought around him when he says on one message the white and black will died again died a fight again and die like flies the next message people won't listen the next message he said that was not God telling me there that was my own idea we see we won't go like that we just quote I got this quote quote she'll kill you it quotes yourself to death it'll kill ya well what do we got any buddy having a DD alders open the way he was unto there's just no again one two to just know all right good the [Music] I want to live he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no I want to love to just [Music] and we love you Jesus name she is believing display what he said want to live away wants me to live I want to do let me lay out some time now just know and be willing to stand on God don't let them be like people a brother my brothers tighten up and hit one time brother George was talking to a man that 3/4 of the Bible are more by memory but he was a trinitarian come to straighten them out and they're they just in a little bit talking to him about the scriptures and they had him so tired up till he would not even say the name Jesus he knew where he was tied up and he wouldn't even use the name of Jesus at least he knew worried that he knew he had no hopes and he didn't want to say Jesus cuz they just said who is he he's the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end and he's all in all his name of Jesus the man was afraid to say it yet he could come in there he came in deliberately to straighten them out but when they asked him a few questions about Jesus he couldn't answer their question is that over our hearts and our life as this message brought Jesus to you what does it matter we're dates and times and seasons out there of them talking about this and that was wrong this was wrong that was wrong as this message brought you to Jesus Christ glory hallelujah then the word is right [Music] you said well they've got this they got that they got their own ideas I heard one the other night where they was proving brother Brian said his mother was like 13 years old when he's born and this lady proved by census report that she would have had to been about 22 years old what's that matter what does it matter you know sensors are not always right sistahs is made by people that just have a knowledge of things I've got an aunt that all she ever knew about her children one of them was born in cotton ticking time she couldn't give you the month when I was born in corn picking time when I was born when that great storm come through she never knew any other birthdays now you asked her a census report and what would it look like well JC he was born in cotton pickin time will write that older census report you understand what I'm saying we want to put on all of these great things that we hear up when it's watch somebody come up with all of these things has been burnt down the buildings were burning Atlanta and destroyed all of your records and things [Music] you know the greatest record there is in all forms how many knows what it is the greatest record of anything that there is about people you know where it's at the Mormon Church if you want to know where your family come from contact the Mormon Church they have the greatest records their records are the purest records of all records because they kept up with it they mighta kept up with it a storm blow the way and done this out of the other but they got two records you say what do you say we can't depend on anything it's not whether this was a date writer that was a date right it's whether or not Jesus Christ has been brought to you and I buy this message in the in turn thank God for that that he's given us his own life in doing and he's come to prove it what do I care whether they can prove this that or the other I just look them in the face and say thank God for the truth you may be right about what you talking about but that didn't bring me to Christ but this prophet message has brought me to Christ then you go out to argue with God about it cuz I gonna argue II we face these doctrines in the seventy's church this is not new doctrines they're the old doctrines of we had ministers meetings in 1970 over whether or not brother Branham was wrong on his dates out in Colorado and things like that but see people don't want to go with those things they want to go with what they think somebody said and they're just breaking the people the message apart because if you can touch that mind of the human being to stop them from believing that the message is right you got two people defeated they're totally defeated but we want to fit in those classes that's why I holler and scream like I do I want us to be to the bases at one thing we can stand on God's Word and don't care what anybody says the word is right yeah but that Bible can't be trusted well who gave you the right to say that I'd have to first learn to trust you right what about it father we've tried our best to dismiss sincere and always have been to believe your word is true and forever settled in heaven and then we doubt our doubts when it comes to mankind trying to prove this that or the other we come to back to the Word of God and what God has to say about all the things and you said it would be here and the people would fall away and now this falling away but yet your little bride is going right on down the road saying thank you Lord we believe you thank you for being right and taking care of us guiding us through the truth we don't have to worry about it we just committed to you lord thank you for all things got us now forgive us of the things we'd say or something that would be contrary to any thoughts or whatsoever and just help us to anchor in you and let your word have the preeminence in each one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you just mean it's probably one for another member Wade this afternoon away I want to get under years just know - what to do No
