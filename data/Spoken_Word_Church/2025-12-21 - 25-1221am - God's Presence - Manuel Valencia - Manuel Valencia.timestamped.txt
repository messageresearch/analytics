[0:00] God bless you all. That was mighty,
[0:02] wonderful preaching there.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; I was enjoying it so much. Praise the
[0:07] Lord. All righty.
[0:11] Get this going.
[0:14] God, that's good. Let's bow our heads
[0:16] and um and pray. Dear heavenly father,
[0:19] we're so grateful, Lord, to be alive one
[0:21] more day, to be um
[0:24] to have God's revelation this day, to
[0:26] have your rest, your priest, to have
[0:28] your presence with us. Lord, we're so
[0:30] grateful, Lord, that we can call upon
[0:31] your name. We're so grateful that we can
[0:33] come with anticipation and believe for
[0:35] all things and that we can, Father God,
[0:38] uh, still receive revelation of your
[0:39] word that we can know that we're called
[0:41] in this last age, Father, as your bride,
[0:43] Father, to accomplish your will on this
[0:44] earth, Father, and to believe your word
[0:47] and to rest in your word, to let rest in
[0:50] your promises.
[0:51] And we're so thankful we have thus, say
[0:53] the Lord, that we have a sure word of
[0:54] promise and that we have, Father, such a
[0:57] sure sound of trumpet, that we have just
[0:59] such a sure word of prophecy that we
[1:01] have such a a true message this age,
[1:04] Father, that you brought through your
[1:05] prophet prophet, Father, we believe it,
[1:07] and we just ask um that you enlighten to
[1:09] us this day or your precious words and
[1:12] that you would teach us, Father, more in
[1:14] the revelation of your truth and in your
[1:16] message in the name of Jesus Christ, our
[1:18] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29] God is good.
[1:34] Praise the Lord. So today on topic of u
[1:37] God's presence, God's presence and I
[1:40] think it'd be uh
[1:42] wonderful to uh to share the scriptures
[1:45] here. I've been God has shown me and
[1:48] it's um it's just a beautiful topic to
[1:50] me. Um I was going to teach on the topic
[1:53] of of believe and um just surely last
[1:57] night the Lord um guided me to to this
[1:59] precious topic. It's I think it's so
[2:01] beautiful, right? It's just God's God's
[2:04] presence in his presence. So his
[2:06] presence is an expression of his
[2:08] attributes. It we're talking about the
[2:10] sa selfsame presence of the divine being
[2:13] of God. Think about it like when you
[2:15] have a a little child or someone coming
[2:17] near to you and you just you're in that
[2:19] presence of someone. They're you're
[2:21] perceiving you're expressing that the
[2:23] the attributes the August presence the
[2:26] warmth and and the comfort that comes
[2:29] with being personally with someone.
[2:32] And in Psalm 16:11,
[2:36] I love I love that it says, "Thou wilt
[2:39] show me." It's something that gets
[2:41] demonstrated, revealed that the paths of
[2:43] life, the path of life in thy presence
[2:47] is fullness of joy. That's a joy that is
[2:49] complete, that is full.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; God's joy. At thy right hand there are
[2:54] pleasures forever more. And I think it's
[2:58] special that we have a God that just
[2:59] doesn't just give a word, doesn't just
[3:01] give a manual and instructions, but he
[3:03] actually comes and indwells the person.
[3:05] He comes and he carries out the the the
[3:08] same power, the same um his his being,
[3:11] his presence, right?
[3:13] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the for his
[3:14] comforter. And in first uh Chronicles
[3:17] 16:27, it actually gives four precious
[3:20] words here uh associating with God's
[3:22] presence. So it's talking about his
[3:25] presence. Glory and honor are in his
[3:28] presence. Strength and gladness are in
[3:32] his place.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; I think about just
[3:38] I I had a little struggle yesterday and
[3:40] all I did is just I yielded to the Lord
[3:43] and affliction of pain and and just
[3:46] instantly um God's presence came by
[3:49] &gt;&gt; and it it just changes everything. It
[3:52] does give you a strength. It does put a
[3:53] gladness in you and and you experience
[3:56] God's honor and glory, something that's
[3:59] divine and something that no medicine
[4:01] can do in you.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; And to me, it's precious, right? when
[4:04] you're spiritually delivered from your
[4:06] afflictions, when his presence comes, uh
[4:08] fullness of joy comes healing and brings
[4:11] about uh the restitution, the
[4:12] restoration of what we need. I think
[4:14] first as as a spirit being, you know,
[4:18] and we're going to do a study uh and get
[4:21] to the good part of his presence, but I
[4:22] just want to touch upon what it is to be
[4:24] away for his pre presence a bit about
[4:27] the also how his enemies, you know,
[4:30] tremble at his presence and are melt at
[4:32] his presence and what that does and also
[4:35] how there's a there's really a reverence
[4:37] and a respect, a trembless and people
[4:39] that are troubled at his presence that
[4:41] comes by and then there's an approach to
[4:43] his presence, you know, and then by
[4:45] God's grace, we have been able to
[4:46] experience the the goodness of his pre
[4:48] presence.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; So, you know, it does it doesn't come by
[4:52] just like that. Of course, there's an
[4:53] approach. And we see in Genesis 3:8 when
[4:56] it first talks about the presence
[4:58] or God's presence and and in this case
[5:01] it says and they heard the voice of the
[5:03] Lord and of God walking in the garness
[5:07] in in the gu garden in the cool of the
[5:09] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[5:12] from the presence of the Lord.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; See amongst the tree of the garden. to
[5:18] see his presence is something to to be
[5:20] sought out for, but it is also something
[5:22] to that kind that can come with the
[5:24] tremble, with the with the with the
[5:26] fear.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; So, in Genesis 4:16, we also see Cain
[5:29] went out of the presence of the Lord and
[5:32] dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of
[5:35] Eden. So, see, he's he went out of the
[5:38] presence. It's interesting to know that
[5:40] at some point he he was actually in or
[5:42] about or around his presence, right?
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the presence of
[5:46] the Lord. The Lord spoke to him at some
[5:49] point too, right?
[5:52] And brother Brandham speaks in 62 in the
[5:54] message in his presence. It says, "May
[5:57] the Lord bless his word." I think that's
[6:00] the most striking scripture. We find
[6:02] that in the presence of God, men
[6:05] recognize themselves to be sinners.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; See, it's a it's a miracle for us to be
[6:09] able to even uh recognize. I remember
[6:11] when when um I actually for the first
[6:14] time, this kind of sounds like an
[6:16] oxymoron, but believe that I was a
[6:18] sinner, you know, because I was a sinner
[6:20] back then, living in sin. And I remember
[6:24] I had an uncle of mine who would testify
[6:26] and said, you know, um you're living in
[6:28] sin and all that. And and after a while,
[6:31] you know, you the first things you say
[6:33] is like, I'm not a bad person. I don't
[6:34] go robbing banks. I don't go doing that.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people say the same
[6:38] thing. And I said that I said that
[6:41] right. I justified myself. So I didn't
[6:43] believe I was a sinner. But when I first
[6:46] believed that I was a sinner or or or
[6:49] kneel or recognize like I say recognize
[6:52] that you're a sinner, that's a miracle.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; And I think that's when you're God's
[6:56] getting closer to you. You're getting
[6:57] closer to the Lord because that's got to
[6:59] come with his presence. It's got to be a
[7:01] miracle.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; We pray that over our children, right?
[7:03] of our youth that um when they're gone
[7:05] astray that may may God's presence go
[7:08] start working on them and then just
[7:09] bring that conviction
[7:11] &gt;&gt; that's we may feel pretty good when
[7:13] we're um out different places and feel
[7:16] like that we're pretty good people but
[7:18] whenever come into the presence of God
[7:22] then we see how little we are
[7:24] &gt;&gt; then we recognize right that we're
[7:26] sinners so enemies do perish at his
[7:28] presence we know um when my enemies are
[7:31] turned back, they shall fall and perish
[7:35] at thy presence. So picture this. It
[7:37] says, "As smoke is driven away, so dry
[7:40] them away. As wax melteth before the
[7:43] fire,
[7:45] they have no they stand no chance,
[7:46] right? Wax stands no chance before the
[7:47] fire. So let the wicked perish at the
[7:51] presence of God,
[7:53] &gt;&gt; you know, and that that's also your your
[7:54] enemies, your foes, you know, the the
[7:56] bad influences, the spirits that battle
[7:58] us." And I just think that God does that
[8:00] sometimes. He does that um to and I'm
[8:04] thankful that he does, right? Because
[8:06] our enemies are are are not flesh and
[8:08] blood. They're spiritual principalities.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that he can do
[8:13] that to our enemies. In Isaiah 64, it
[8:16] says, "As when the melting fire burneth,
[8:18] the fire causes the waters to boil to
[8:22] make thy name known to thy adversaries."
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Makes the name known to them. Can you
[8:28] imagine just them devils and then all of
[8:30] a sudden says I am the Lord Jesus
[8:32] Christ.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; They must flee.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Says that the nations may tremble at thy
[8:37] presence. Tremble at this presence. So
[8:40] and here we have this is a pretty
[8:42] interesting question the Lord poses in
[8:43] Jeremiah 5 as a prophecy. He says fear
[8:46] ye not me
[8:48] say the Lord.
[8:50] Will you not tremble at my presence
[8:54] which have placed the sand for the mound
[8:57] of the sea
[8:59] by perpetual decree that cannot pass it.
[9:03] You know the the waves cannot actually
[9:05] go over that. And though the waves
[9:08] thereof to toss themselves, they yet
[9:12] they cannot prevail. Can they not
[9:14] prevail? Though they roar, they cannot
[9:19] they can. It says yet they yet can they
[9:22] not pass over it. So I just think the
[9:24] Lord um the Lord's presence is something
[9:26] to be uh you know reverence about
[9:28] because it it's a itself being coming
[9:31] near and manifesting. I I think Job u
[9:34] describes it here well. This is Job
[9:36] speaking for he perforth the the thing
[9:40] that is appointed for me and many such
[9:42] things are with him. It says therefore I
[9:46] am troubled at his presence.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Right? See, when there's affliction,
[9:50] when there's such, you know, we we
[9:51] recognize when I consider, I'm afraid of
[9:54] him, for God maketh mine heart soft
[9:59] &gt;&gt; and the Almighty troubleth me.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; So, see, take don't take for granted,
[10:05] you know, now that you're a mature
[10:06] Christian and you can come into God's
[10:07] presence, you know, it came because of
[10:09] all of this.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; It came because of the Job experience.
[10:12] It came because, you know, his presence
[10:14] allowed us to recognize that we were
[10:15] sinners. came with that with with that
[10:18] growth and that progression and his self
[10:21] same presence is him right but the same
[10:23] god will come and separate divide and
[10:26] cause these uh these things to be moved
[10:28] away from our lives you know these costs
[10:30] of battle you know cause the nations to
[10:32] tremble against you know the god of
[10:33] Israel and such the god of Jacob it says
[10:35] in the bible as well but for you they
[10:37] know it starts then to realize you know
[10:41] but this is who I am think about like
[10:42] god coming in the presence and defending
[10:44] a little child of in front of a bully or
[10:46] something or big brother and you know he
[10:48] basically first comes and and he you
[10:50] know he strikes fear at the and mel like
[10:53] fire burns away you know at his presence
[10:55] and then the little boy goes like now
[10:58] he's afraid of the one that defended him
[11:00] and you basically says like I didn't
[11:02] know you can do that and then now he you
[11:05] know after your heart is soft and and
[11:07] you're troubled at him then then you're
[11:08] in a position to come approach his
[11:10] presence right in respect and reverence
[11:13] &gt;&gt; and then you can experience his sweet
[11:15] fellowship, his august presence, his
[11:17] comfort, all the the good the good
[11:19] benefits of his presence that come with
[11:21] the selfexisting one. Right? Psalm 68:8,
[11:25] the earth shook, the heavens also
[11:27] dropped at the presence of God. Even
[11:28] Sinai itself was moved at the presence
[11:31] of God, at the God of Israel. So this is
[11:34] in the natural, right? Tremble earth at
[11:36] the presence of the Lord, at the
[11:38] presence of the God of Jacob. See that
[11:41] no flesh should glory in his presence.
[11:43] Right.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; I I I can attest to that, right? It's
[11:46] not our flesh, of course, but that glory
[11:48] is in his presence. But boy, our soul,
[11:50] you know, that's been redeemed,
[11:51] regenerated from God. It does. It did
[11:53] say that his presence comes with a glory
[11:55] and an honor and strength and gladness
[11:58] and say uh I like this little section
[12:00] here about just one verse about so
[12:03] fleeing from the presence of a foolish
[12:05] man. So see the fresh the foolish man
[12:07] can also comes with the presence and it
[12:08] says go from the presence of the foolish
[12:12] man when thou perceiveth not in his lips
[12:17] um of it says when thou perceiveth not
[12:20] in his the lips of knowledge
[12:22] &gt;&gt; so that he there's no knowledge in his
[12:24] le lips the presence of god brings a
[12:27] conviction so that's that's uh one of
[12:29] the message quotes I have here is in his
[12:30] presence the same message in 62 but the
[12:32] random says then we realize how little
[12:34] we are when we realize how great he is
[12:37] and how close we come in of his of
[12:40] coming to his presence. Somehow or
[12:42] another, it's always throwed a great
[12:45] effect upon people to come into the
[12:47] presence of God. I've seen the time in
[12:50] my ministry when you would see the
[12:53] presence of God come into such a place
[12:56] that it would bring a person up and just
[12:59] reveal the life to them,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; right? and call out their sins of all
[13:04] kinds of immoral acts. And it brings
[13:06] such a holy hush
[13:09] &gt;&gt; amongst the people till they drop out of
[13:11] the prayer line. Look at this
[13:14] illustration. Before they ever come out
[13:16] to be prayed for and run to the altar
[13:18] and get right with God, before they come
[13:22] unto his presence.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? And God's presence
[13:26] was so perfectly there
[13:30] &gt;&gt; next to the prophet when he was um in
[13:33] the uh discernment that the people just
[13:37] feared at his presence. You know, as
[13:39] they came close in the prayer line, can
[13:40] you picture that? They would just go to
[13:41] the they would just go to the altar and
[13:43] make it right first
[13:45] &gt;&gt; before they came in any much closer to
[13:47] that presence. See, there's something
[13:50] about coming into the presence of God.
[13:51] It causes things to happen. Yes.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; You know, either to the enemy or to the
[13:55] devils or, you know, to ourselves the
[13:57] believer as as we surrender to his
[13:59] presence.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; In Psalm 140 and 13, it says, "Surely
[14:02] the righteous shall give thanks unto thy
[14:05] name, the upright." So, this is not
[14:06] talking about the believer, right? Shall
[14:08] dwell in his presence. I love that word
[14:10] dwell because that word dwell is is it's
[14:14] um it's like a such a a um trusting word
[14:19] where you can be with someone but dwell
[14:22] means like you're sitting back taking
[14:24] off your shoes like in your house in
[14:26] your living room
[14:28] &gt;&gt; and and you're dwelling and when you're
[14:31] you're just at ease you're you're you're
[14:32] comforting and trusting the in whose
[14:35] presence you're in.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; I love dwelling you know. I love like a
[14:39] dwelling your home, right? It's it's
[14:41] it's a dwelling and and that is how we
[14:44] should abide or dwell in in God's
[14:46] presence. And this is the verse that we
[14:48] read uh just just a reminder, glory,
[14:50] honor in his are in his presence.
[14:53] Strength and gladness are in his place.
[14:56] Another of the opening scriptures. So,
[14:58] thou shalt show me. And we'll find here
[15:00] with Mary is that when the angel of the
[15:02] Lord um came
[15:04] from the presence of God, he says, "And
[15:06] I will show you things." I just love the
[15:08] revelation of God because it says here,
[15:10] "Thou will show me the path of life."
[15:12] &gt;&gt; He shows us the way that we should go
[15:14] where the life is in. In thy presence is
[15:16] fullness of joy. At thy right hand there
[15:19] are pleasures forever more.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; In this Psalm 17, he says, "Let my
[15:24] sentence or my vindication come from thy
[15:26] presence. Let thine eyes behold the
[15:29] things that are equal.
[15:33] whether shall I go from thy from thy
[15:35] spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[15:38] presence? You know, if I go here, you're
[15:39] there. If you go up there, you're there.
[15:42] I just think that once you've been
[15:44] impregnated, right, once you've been um
[15:45] entrusted with God's presence and and
[15:47] experience God's presence,
[15:50] I believe it we're in there for the long
[15:52] haul because, you know, like I said,
[15:55] God's presence does bring a separation
[15:56] of division or it does bring a a fight.
[15:58] It does bring a burning that melts the
[16:00] enemies away and it does bring a
[16:01] trembling. It does bring an approach but
[16:04] you know once you go through all that it
[16:05] does bring that that that rest and that
[16:07] peace.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; So rest in his presence here I have and
[16:11] he said my presence shall go with thee.
[16:13] This is to to Moses and I will give thee
[16:16] rest.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; So this a rest as a company as we talked
[16:19] about couple month a month ago on God's
[16:22] rest. So I just love that his presence
[16:25] comes with a rest something that you can
[16:28] again lay back dwell trust.
[16:31] See look I this verse is very dear
[16:34] because it says in Psalm 31:20, "Thou
[16:37] shalt hide them in the secret
[16:41] of thy presence."
[16:43] So isn't that amazing? Is thy his
[16:45] presence being a secret place, right? In
[16:48] the secrets of thy presence from the
[16:50] pride of man, thou shalt keep them
[16:54] secretly in a pavilion from the strife
[16:58] of tongues. Isn't that a a a comfort
[17:02] comfortable place to be with to know
[17:04] that
[17:05] God hides them in the secret of his
[17:09] presence
[17:10] and from the pride of man and thou shalt
[17:13] keep them secretly in a pavilion from
[17:17] the strife of tongues. I say, you know,
[17:20] sometimes I don't take that for granted
[17:22] what it's like just to be um
[17:25] covered, to be shielded
[17:28] uh from uh from a strife of man, from
[17:30] the strife of tongues, from the pride of
[17:32] man. You know, it's
[17:36] don't take it for granted, right? All
[17:37] the things you're that you've been um
[17:40] protected from that you all the comforts
[17:43] in knowing his presence. Cast me not
[17:45] away. Since I'm 51, you know, it's um
[17:47] created in me a new heart, oh Lord. Cast
[17:49] me not away from thy presence and take
[17:51] not thy holy spirit from me.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; That's everybody's prayer here.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; The hills melted like wax at the
[18:00] presence of the Lord at the presence of
[18:01] the Lord of the whole earth. See, in all
[18:05] their affliction, he was afflicted. Look
[18:07] at this. And the angel of his presence
[18:10] saved them.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; In his love, in his pity, he redeemed
[18:16] them. Isaiah. and he bar them and
[18:19] carried them all the days of old.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; All the good things God's presence does
[18:25] for them. You try it one time. It's it's
[18:28] wonderful when you just surrender and um
[18:31] it does take a it does take an effort,
[18:34] right? He had to go set aside and but
[18:36] boy, when you enter into God's presence
[18:38] through prayer,
[18:41] hearing the the preaching of his word,
[18:42] hearing a message,
[18:45] singing a song,
[18:47] &gt;&gt; hearing a song. That's that's what it's
[18:50] about is just being in contact with your
[18:52] heavenly father. The burden of Egypt.
[18:55] See, this is talking about the burden of
[18:57] Egypt.
[18:59] Behold, the the Lord writeth upon a
[19:01] swift cloud. We have a message. And
[19:05] shall come into Egypt and the idols of
[19:07] Egypt shall be rem removed at his
[19:09] presence.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; This is what his presence does. And the
[19:12] heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst
[19:14] of it. I'm thankful that we have a word
[19:16] and a presence of God that the Lord can
[19:19] ride in a swift cloud and and that can
[19:21] melt away just move all the idols in our
[19:24] life,
[19:25] &gt;&gt; right? and that he can um he can melt
[19:28] the the presence of with our heart the
[19:31] heart of Egypt the heart of the world
[19:32] right get is melted in the in the the
[19:35] midst of it 2 Chronicles we have and all
[19:39] the kings of the earth sought the the
[19:42] presence of Solomon so this is the God's
[19:45] presence in a believer now you know
[19:47] someone that who trust in him to hear
[19:49] the wisdom that God had put in his heart
[19:53] &gt;&gt; right So remember, we knew about God's
[19:57] wisdom. I mean, Solomon's wisdom, but
[19:59] God's presence was with him, with him.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful we have God's
[20:04] presence in us.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; And greater than Solomon was here, said
[20:08] Jesus. Isn't that amazing? So
[20:10] approaching his presence as we wrap up
[20:12] here in 2 Chronicles,
[20:15] it it says, "And they dwelt therein and
[20:18] have built the sanctuary therein for thy
[20:20] name." So think about the word thy name
[20:23] saying if if when evil cometh. So this
[20:25] is the approach. If when evil cometh
[20:27] upon us as a sword or judgment or
[20:30] pestilence or famine or really bad
[20:31] things we stand before his this house
[20:35] and in thy presence and it says for thy
[20:38] name is thy in thy house in thy presence
[20:42] and cry out unto thee in our affliction
[20:46] then thou will hear and help. Isn't that
[20:49] amazing? The approach is it's
[20:51] repentance. It don't it does come
[20:52] through through that approach. Let us
[20:54] come before his presence with
[20:56] thanksgiving and make a joyful noise
[20:58] unto him with psalms with singing. Amen.
[21:02] Praise the Lord. Serve the Lord with
[21:04] gladness. Come before his presence with
[21:07] singing. That's God's approach. And
[21:10] &gt;&gt; and here's the account on Mary. And the
[21:12] angel answering said unto excuse me, not
[21:15] Mary. Uh and the angel answering said
[21:17] unto him, I am Gabriel. that stand in
[21:20] the presence of God,
[21:22] and I'm sent to speak unto thee and to
[21:25] show thee glad tidings.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is just amazing how there's
[21:31] there's an angel that stand at his
[21:32] presence. And what it does is it reveals
[21:35] to show glad tidings in in Jude 24 uh to
[21:39] 25, we have now unto him, this is the
[21:43] last scripture here. So unto him that is
[21:46] able to keep thee from falling.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us Lord.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; And to present you faultless before the
[21:55] presence of his glory with exceeding
[21:59] joy.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; To the only
[22:03] God our savior. He says to you only God
[22:06] our savior be glory and majesty,
[22:09] dominion and power both for now
[22:12] and ever.
[22:14] Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; And just as we wrap up here, God's
[22:17] presence um to the believer is something
[22:20] that it really comes with the with the
[22:22] goods. It comes with uh it it's where
[22:25] we're healed. It's where we're
[22:26] strengthened. It's where we're equipped.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; It's where we um God's word comes alive.
[22:32] It's when the uh you know, it's the it's
[22:35] the evidence that God is is near and
[22:37] with us, that he's he's still along the
[22:40] way encouraging us. And it's a
[22:42] visitation, right? It's a self it's self
[22:45] being ever present. And just to know
[22:48] that the God that created us all,
[22:50] created everything is is able to come
[22:53] and manifest in the believer
[22:55] and is able to come. And I love the word
[22:58] August presence because
[23:01] in Spanish, the word August means or
[23:03] austo means that you're very well
[23:06] comfortable. It actually means like
[23:08] you're comfortable, but you're like it's
[23:10] like expressing the the feeling that you
[23:13] get when you're comfortable. It's a it's
[23:14] like think about when you put that nice
[23:16] sweater or the nice coat on and it's
[23:18] just this August. It's uh it's amazing
[23:21] how brother Bon talk a lot about the
[23:22] August presence of the Lord and just
[23:25] really um comforting his people, you
[23:28] know, and uh we go through a lot. So,
[23:30] I'm thankful that we have God's presence
[23:32] to um make all things right.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you, brothers.
[23:37] Have a wonderful service. Praise the
[23:39] Lord.
