[28:32] that this morning Lord that you're still

[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] 22 sure appreciate the presence of the
[28:50] Lord this morning and the worship amen
[28:53] it's it's good to have Liberty in the
[28:55] Lord in amen
[28:59] I want to I want to take a little topic
[29:00] this morning that you you can't stay
[29:02] here am pressing toward God's purpose
[29:06] amen you you can't stay
[29:11] here so let's read in uh this is the the
[29:14] story of the uh the Rich Young Ruler and
[29:17] we'll just read this one verse and then
[29:20] when Jesus had heard all these things
[29:21] that the little Rich Young Ruler had
[29:23] told him all the things that he had kept
[29:24] from his birth and all those things he
[29:26] said he he said unto him yet thou
[29:28] lackest one thing right seal all that
[29:32] thou Hast and distribute unto the poor
[29:35] and thou shall have treasure in heaven
[29:38] and come follow me God bless the reading
[29:41] of his word you can have your seats
[29:45] amen and I I I just uh I I began
[29:49] meditating on the on this kind of
[29:50] thought because um you know you hear
[29:53] sometimes preachers say a little line in
[29:56] in a sermon and they're just kind of
[29:58] kind of stick with you but I I think one
[30:00] of the one of the worst things that
[30:02] happens is happening in today in the
[30:05] this layout of spirit Creeps in and it
[30:07] gets a hold of people and they just
[30:09] begin to get comfortable with where they
[30:10] are right absolutely and you can see
[30:13] this really uh playing out in the story
[30:15] of the Rich Young Ruler he had maybe
[30:17] maybe he could be a type of of somebody
[30:19] living in this age that he was rich he
[30:22] had he was a ruler he had everything
[30:24] that he needed and he was fine just uh
[30:27] just stay in right where he was and and
[30:30] and of course Jesus laid out that
[30:31] challenge for him you know it really
[30:35] really what he's asking is where's
[30:37] where's your treasure what's the most
[30:39] valuable thing you got is it all all of
[30:41] that laid up uh in your barn and your
[30:44] all the property and things that you got
[30:46] or or are you willing to just uh forget
[30:48] all the uh wealth and everything you've
[30:50] got right and and and follow me
[30:54] amen and and really that this this kind
[30:58] of thought can apply to anybody that's
[31:01] here that's sitting here alive no matter
[31:03] where you are in your journey if you get
[31:06] comfortable with where you are then
[31:07] you're not doing what God you're not
[31:09] fulfilling God's purpose that we've got
[31:12] to continually press on towards God's
[31:14] purpose for so that it would be
[31:16] fulfilled in our life and you you even
[31:19] reminded of you know that story of
[31:21] Abraham where he was uh down there in
[31:24] that in the Fertile Crescent in the land
[31:26] of us and and God come and and spoke to
[31:28] him and told him to get it what a what a
[31:30] strange thing that it seemed like he'd
[31:32] have everything that he needed just
[31:34] situated real good and God told him get
[31:36] up and leave all of your uh families
[31:39] Idols all of that just get up and get
[31:41] going Y and there there in Hebrews 11:
[31:45] 13 it talks about all of those that uh
[31:48] that uh that died in faith not having
[31:50] received the promises but it says that
[31:52] they say they that say such things
[31:55] declare plainly that they seek a country
[31:58] yeah in other words they were minded
[32:00] that I I ain't staying
[32:03] here you know you can look you can look
[32:06] around and see all of the things that
[32:07] are happening in the earth and and it
[32:10] seems like everybody kind of gets in a
[32:11] in a tizzy every time election season
[32:14] comes around everybody gets frightful
[32:16] and Afraid and and you you know the
[32:18] hurricanes come and disasters happen and
[32:21] we begin to wonder what's what's
[32:23] happening but you know really really it
[32:25] all comes down to this this this is not
[32:27] my home
[32:29] of course you know we know that that
[32:31] God's going to clean the world off and
[32:33] we're going to we're going to eventually
[32:35] after it's been purged and purified and
[32:37] going through the process that we're
[32:38] going to live here forever and ever but
[32:40] not not like this this world is not my
[32:44] home and brother Ram said in taking
[32:46] sides with Jesus he said now what my
[32:48] thoughts is if it could be possible that
[32:51] when I start going somewhere I don't
[32:52] know where I'm going but I can't sit
[32:55] still I ain't going to stay here here
[32:58] right come on that's right amen I just
[33:01] can't do it I got to move somewhere
[33:04] that's right now now see doesn't that
[33:06] play out exactly the same spirit that
[33:09] was in Abraham the same thing the same
[33:11] motives that were moving all of these
[33:14] old Saints of old that they got to go
[33:16] somewhere that's that's why as they were
[33:17] journeying through the Wilderness that
[33:19] there was the prophet said it looked
[33:22] like there was a wheel in the middle of
[33:23] the wheel cuz they were rolling on they
[33:25] can't they can't you can't sit still you
[33:27] got to keep going somewhere amen and he
[33:30] said I got to move somewhere and I
[33:32] probably won't stay there but a few days
[33:34] be moving somewhere else I got to go
[33:36] somewhere I don't know where I'm going
[33:37] neither did Abraham know where he was
[33:39] going he just crossed the river and
[33:41] started off and you know sometimes we're
[33:44] we're on the road it seems like we
[33:45] travel a lot lately but we you know we
[33:47] always joke well this is how this is how
[33:49] the spirit of an eagle an eagle's got to
[33:51] get to moveing that eagle that's why you
[33:53] find believers they got to go to youth
[33:55] camps they got to get up and they're
[33:56] going to do something because there
[33:58] there's something in them that longs for
[34:00] Revival and a Revival is not something
[34:02] to just get started a Revival is
[34:04] something that where you it refreshes
[34:06] what you already got and and it gets to
[34:08] kindling something and and what what is
[34:10] it it's something within you that's
[34:12] longing and seeking for a seeking for
[34:15] another country seeking for something
[34:17] that's not here so now when you look
[34:19] when you maybe maybe if you got a TV in
[34:22] your home or whatever your situation is
[34:24] if you're listening to the news and you
[34:26] see all of these
[34:28] all of the stuff going on about the
[34:30] election just remember this world is not
[34:34] my home
[34:39] now I I I I I I I really just want to
[34:42] frame up your mindset I think sometimes
[34:44] we we start looking at this candidate
[34:46] over here and this candidate over here
[34:48] and we think which candidate is going to
[34:50] save us now now come on now let's let's
[34:53] be real Christian about it which
[34:54] candidate is going to save us and and if
[34:57] I want to mind you let's take it back to
[34:59] what brother random said he said if I
[35:00] and and we all we almost laugh at this
[35:03] it seems like the reaction you get is
[35:05] people almost laugh when you make
[35:06] statements like this but he's the one
[35:08] that said if you put a George Washington
[35:11] and an Abraham Lincoln in every office
[35:14] all the way down to your local County
[35:16] government your Mayors all the way down
[35:18] this nation is still going down so there
[35:21] ain't going to be somebody to come set
[35:23] it up so you're going to be a real happy
[35:26] Christian and be real well situated and
[35:29] not going to have any problems it's not
[35:31] going to be set up like that I'm sorry
[35:34] to tell you on the one side and I'm not
[35:36] preaching politics but on the one side
[35:38] you're going to have uniting of church
[35:40] and state and the other other side
[35:41] you're going to have a woman Spirit
[35:43] ruling so whichever way it goes it's
[35:45] going to fulfill the plan and purpose of
[35:47] God that ain't up to me but I know one
[35:49] thing that this world is not my home and
[35:52] neither one of these candidates are
[35:54] going to make it so so that so that it's
[35:57] going to so that so that I'm going to
[35:58] want to stay here let's put it like
[36:04] that we see we see people they they you
[36:07] frame up even people they're looking for
[36:10] something so horrible that well I got to
[36:12] store up all these baked goods I got to
[36:14] store up all these things and we get to
[36:16] frame it up in our mind well I'm going
[36:17] to be here I'm going to be here and and
[36:21] I'm I'm almost to the point where it
[36:23] seems like people well I'm going to be
[36:24] here through the tribulation no no now
[36:27] when when the six seal opened up it
[36:29] revealed that the the foolish virgin and
[36:32] the 144,000 and all them have to go
[36:35] through those kind of rough times but
[36:38] now the bride is purified by the word so
[36:41] now we've already got everything that we
[36:42] need to be changed we and I ain't
[36:45] looking for nothing else but the secret
[36:47] calling and catching away for one day
[36:50] the bride is going to come come turned
[36:52] up missing and the rest of the church
[36:53] world is going to be what happened but
[36:56] but another words I'm not looking to
[36:58] store up all this stuff so that I can go
[37:00] through a tribulation period I'm not
[37:02] looking to store up all these things so
[37:04] I can plan out what's going to happen
[37:06] what I'm doing as I think brother
[37:08] brandom gave us a storehouse didn't he
[37:10] he stored up all of this food so you
[37:12] could have everything you need and you
[37:14] don't need a bunch of baked goods and
[37:15] things but what you need is a revealed
[37:17] word for the hour that you can anchor
[37:19] your soul to and anchor your whole
[37:21] journey and
[37:22] everything that's the thing that'll
[37:24] carry you across the river I'm not
[37:27] making plans to stay we can't stay you
[37:30] know whether are you not whether or not
[37:32] you believe in global warming or things
[37:33] like the Earth the Bible says that the
[37:35] Earth will burn with a fervent heat in
[37:38] other words that the Earth is getting to
[37:39] a place where you can't stay somebody
[37:42] we're going to have to get out of here
[37:44] and we and there's there's got to be
[37:46] something within our hearts that's
[37:48] laboring and pressing to get out of here
[37:51] and get out of here now you know we're
[37:53] talking about moving but I'm not really
[37:56] talking about moving naturally it seems
[37:58] like sometimes you you look at people
[38:00] the way that they live and they feel
[38:01] like they just got to hustle and bustle
[38:03] and go around every doing everything but
[38:05] you can be
[38:06] moving and sitting
[38:08] still now that's what I'm talking about
[38:11] you can go out and sit at the coast and
[38:13] you can see watch and the water will be
[38:15] evaporating and turning into clouds and
[38:18] raining maybe a thousand miles away and
[38:20] looks like nothing's happening and
[38:22] that's that's a different kind of moving
[38:25] than when you're hustling and bustling
[38:26] and trying to to work something up but
[38:29] that that's what I'm talking about this
[38:30] morning that that if God can if we can
[38:32] yield ourselves to God to where we're
[38:34] moving spiritually that you can't stay
[38:38] where you are spiritually I don't want
[38:40] to stay we got to move now what gets us
[38:43] to moving it it's the life that gets us
[38:46] to move you know even when you when
[38:48] you're out in the world you come to you
[38:50] get around church people and you start
[38:51] seeing something real I I've saw that
[38:54] work out in I've seen it in my own life
[38:56] I've seen it work out in my children's
[38:58] lives that time Zach was at the at one
[39:00] of the camp meetings and he was
[39:02] wondering is the message true or not is
[39:05] it real and he looked up on the prayer
[39:07] line and and there was a pillar of fire
[39:09] actually there like I'm I'm talking
[39:11] about not something you could just look
[39:13] at on the picture but the pillar of fire
[39:15] there in the camp meeting what what was
[39:16] it it's a life the life and you see
[39:19] brother brother Ram would say that's why
[39:20] the devil gets so upset when people
[39:23] begin to receive their healing and signs
[39:24] and wonders begin to happen in the
[39:26] meeting CU it's the life actually
[39:28] demonstrating vindicating that the word
[39:30] is not something that we're just
[39:31] learning about it but it's something
[39:33] real and you get you get sit on on the
[39:36] old rock and chair porch with with an
[39:37] old timer and where you can actually
[39:39] listen to the real life Echo forth from
[39:42] their lips and tell you about their
[39:43] experience and then something begins to
[39:45] draw you because that's what happens to
[39:48] maybe an unbeliever they get around a
[39:50] Believer and and and the life is what
[39:52] you begin to see it's the attraction on
[39:53] the mount God's word is being fulfilled
[39:56] in that person's life and it begins to
[39:58] attract you it begins to draw
[40:00] you it's not just it's not just a desire
[40:03] to to learn things so that we can hold
[40:05] it in front of somebody else and say
[40:06] well look how much I know but it's the
[40:08] life oh it goes it all goes back to that
[40:11] like John in the Book of Revelation he
[40:13] saw one set on the throne and round
[40:14] about that one on the throne was a
[40:17] rainbow that went around and it was
[40:18] green why Emerald why cuz it symbolized
[40:21] life the whole story is about life
[40:24] brother said why did it have to be
[40:25] Shepherds cuz Shepherds know about life
[40:27] life when when the when the bride tree
[40:30] was eaten down it was eaten down all the
[40:31] way down to the roots but there's life
[40:33] in the root what kind of Life have
[40:34] predestinated seed germ life that's
[40:36] going to come up and and it's life life
[40:39] is the thing that drives the church
[40:40] that's the spirit that quickeneth life
[40:43] and and this is a living gospel not
[40:45] something that's dead not something
[40:46] that's buried in the ground up there in
[40:48] Jeffersonville or something but it's a
[40:49] living gospel and what's this gets us to
[40:52] move is the Life of Christ that actually
[40:54] is actually drawing us now now the thing
[40:56] though if you want to if you want to get
[40:58] to the life there here's the thing if
[41:00] you want to get to the life then you got
[41:02] to get you got to come through the word
[41:06] am you got to come through the word
[41:09] amen you know one of the one one of the
[41:11] most compelling reasons to move is the
[41:13] Life of Christ amen what's the life I
[41:16] want to be
[41:17] changed you you start coming it's like
[41:20] coming into the outer Court you come to
[41:21] the outer Court I I see them offering
[41:23] their sacrifice I see the blood driven
[41:25] down from that lamb I want and you begin
[41:27] to realize I I want to be changed I want
[41:29] to get into that into that holy of
[41:31] holies I want my guilt to be taken away
[41:34] I I want to be free I want to be
[41:36] righteous and that's what the life does
[41:39] it the life begins to work on you and it
[41:41] begins to change you to be like Jesus
[41:45] it's the Life of Christ that's what like
[41:47] like brother Michael was saying this
[41:48] morning it's not the message is not a
[41:50] bunch of rules a bunch of things that
[41:52] we've got to follow a a list of
[41:54] doctrines but it's actually the Life of
[41:56] Christ living himself out in you to make
[41:59] your life match up with the word and
[42:01] it's God's life fulfilling his word in
[42:05] you now in the queen of the South
[42:07] brother Brown was say he said if you
[42:08] went to a pumpkin vine you'd expect to
[42:11] find
[42:12] pumpkins if you went to a watermelon
[42:14] vine you'd expect to find
[42:16] watermelons you went to a grape vine
[42:18] you'd go to grapes and if you come to
[42:21] the church you don't expect Theology and
[42:24] arguing and fussing y right what you
[42:27] expect to see you expect to see the
[42:30] Life of Christ the vine moving in the
[42:34] branches
[42:36] amen bringing forth The Same Spirit yes
[42:40] that lived in the Lord Jesus absolutely
[42:42] amen for he lives amen he's alive today
[42:47] if he is he will do the same Works Jesus
[42:50] said if I do not the works of my father
[42:52] that sent me then believe me not amen I
[42:55] think that again Echoes what brother
[42:57] Michael was speaking on this morning
[42:58] that if you got faith it's going to
[43:00] manifest oh and we know all we know the
[43:03] pattern we've been taught that faith is
[43:05] Faith is something inward that only
[43:06] really only God can see it's something
[43:08] between you and God me your works is for
[43:10] others why is it for others because it's
[43:13] an attraction it's your salt it's the
[43:15] salty Savor that makes somebody else
[43:17] thirsty that makes somebody else want it
[43:20] they're they're not looking at or your
[43:21] mean attitude or whatever but they're
[43:23] looking at the Life of Christ The Life
[43:25] of Christ is what draws calls them and
[43:27] the message conferences he said we could
[43:29] scream and shout and do whatever we want
[43:31] to it'll never influence man until they
[43:33] see the Life of Christ being projected
[43:36] in you someone who's I I I like reading
[43:39] these things because he lays out kind of
[43:42] what I I almost like the measuring stick
[43:45] of what we're trying to trying to get at
[43:47] someone who's tender and merciful and
[43:51] forgiving you know to get to a place
[43:52] where you're tender sometime it's like
[43:54] meat sometimes you have to be wonked a
[43:56] little bit through life to get to get
[43:57] tenderized a little bit you got to go
[43:59] through some experiences and challenges
[44:01] in life some you lose some things that
[44:04] are valuable one and and go through some
[44:07] rough some rough battles get tenderized
[44:09] to a place where you can really he said
[44:12] and ready to turn the other side of the
[44:13] cheek or give the second coat or go the
[44:16] Second Mile Christianity and action not
[44:18] just taught from the pulpit but acted
[44:20] among the members among the pastors
[44:23] that's when you see Christ Living in
[44:24] this church decisions
[44:27] but but if you want if you want that
[44:30] life you got to come by the
[44:32] word it's the life that attracts us I I
[44:36] sure remember when I was a young man
[44:37] growing up and I I'd look at different
[44:39] Believers and I think my I'd see their
[44:41] reaction to situations just real genuine
[44:44] Believers that I held in high regard and
[44:46] I'd see their the way that they reacted
[44:47] to things and i' my there's no way that
[44:50] you could be patient like that except it
[44:53] would be God working in you there's no
[44:56] way that you you could react and it
[44:58] begins to it all you get around somebody
[45:00] like that and it'll begin to convict you
[45:02] you begin to get around the real life
[45:05] well that's that's actually why people
[45:07] in the world you go to Walmart and it
[45:09] seems like they hate you because you
[45:11] sisters because you're wearing a dress
[45:13] because the life is on display the life
[45:16] gets it begins to confront your your
[45:18] sinful nature and the way that you are
[45:20] and you begin to you get pricked and
[45:22] you're like I but but to get that life
[45:25] to get that Deliverance that you you''
[45:27] got to come by the word because the word
[45:30] what is the word the word is
[45:33] actually maybe it's it's like maybe this
[45:35] would be a carnal illustration but if
[45:38] you could take the spirit and dehydrate
[45:39] it put it into a form another form and
[45:41] read it on the page there's it's the
[45:43] word it's the spirit in letter form and
[45:46] then you Quicken it and you rehydrate it
[45:49] again and it's just the spirit so the
[45:51] word actually is the spirit it's the the
[45:54] word is when you're reading the word it
[45:56] is the spirit all you got to do is
[45:57] believe it and then it will produce what
[45:59] it will Express the God's thought it
[46:01] will Express the spirit in your life and
[46:04] that's why Jesus would say in Matthew
[46:06] 4:4 he said he answered it is it is
[46:08] written man shall not live by bread
[46:11] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[46:14] out of the mouth of God that word is
[46:16] what we're living by because the word
[46:18] actually will produce the life of God in
[46:20] you and John 6:63 he said it's the
[46:24] spirit that quickeneth the flesh Pro of
[46:27] nothing my the carnal outside that you
[46:29] see the words that I speak unto you they
[46:32] are spirit and they are life the word
[46:35] that falls into the good ground of your
[46:37] heart actually produces the life and
[46:40] brother R would say this he said and I I
[46:41] think this is the foreal he said the
[46:43] word itself is spirit it's spirit in
[46:46] word form and then you see when it is
[46:48] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[46:51] of the word goes to work and acts
[46:54] absolutely so the point I'm trying to
[46:57] make here is we're trying what are we
[46:58] pressing forward we're pressing toward
[47:00] the life actually lived out in us and
[47:03] we've got to no matter where you are
[47:04] you're pressing forward and you're you
[47:07] you can't stay where you're at if you're
[47:09] in a state of justification this morning
[47:11] you can't stay there if you're in a
[47:13] state of sanctification this morning you
[47:15] can't stay there and if you're in if
[47:17] you're born again you can't stay there
[47:20] you got to keep moving you got to keep
[47:22] pressing on don't ever get satisfied
[47:24] with where you are amen amen
[47:27] and and and you know uh you know
[47:29] sometimes when when you go out preaching
[47:31] and things you'll hear people Express
[47:33] express what they believe and little
[47:35] quick statements and things right and
[47:37] one of the things you know I've heard
[47:38] people say I as long as we can get
[47:41] somebody to the baptismal pool we've got
[47:43] them to
[47:44] Salvation now what now let's think about
[47:47] these things this morning cuz I you know
[47:49] teaching really places and it helps us
[47:51] to understand where we're at and whatnot
[47:53] sure you get somebody to believe in in
[47:56] Jesus Christ Christ and and they're
[47:58] they're they're they're at a spot yeah
[48:02] where they're
[48:04] saved
[48:05] amen but then IR like irenius he
[48:09] compared
[48:09] baptism baptism to uh to justification
[48:13] if we can and you you'll see so so many
[48:16] people come to a state of justification
[48:18] just like they come to the baptismal
[48:19] pool and they come and they they start
[48:21] off real good and they're they're
[48:22] they're real excited about it and but
[48:24] then they don't they don't linger they
[48:25] don't wait until but they don't hang on
[48:27] to the word and then they go right back
[48:29] out from right back out into the world
[48:32] right back out into the condition so
[48:34] that that my point this morning is I'm
[48:36] not satisfied getting somebody just to a
[48:38] place of
[48:39] conception it's just it works just like
[48:41] a natural birth there's different stages
[48:44] first there's a conception and then the
[48:46] little muscles begin to Twitch and
[48:47] there's a form of life down in that b in
[48:50] that mother's womb and there's a a form
[48:51] of life working and moving but the baby
[48:54] ain't there yet life doesn't come until
[48:57] you're born and you can't hold that baby
[48:59] in your arms until it's born there there
[49:02] might be a miscarriage and so we don't
[49:04] want we don't want spiritual
[49:05] miscarriages we don't want to get
[49:07] somebody to the baptismal pool and then
[49:09] Wonder like sometimes happens in the
[49:11] natural what happened you
[49:14] know brother I'm I'm I'm steered away
[49:18] from something
[49:20] like we want we don't want to get
[49:22] somebody to just to a conception but we
[49:23] want to get them to a birth amen and and
[49:26] brother will say in the second coming of
[49:28] the Lord he said listen you're not saved
[49:31] until you're born again that's right you
[49:34] just turned your face toward something
[49:36] now that's what justification it's like
[49:37] coming into the outer court and there's
[49:39] the Altar and there's the labor the
[49:42] labor where you can come and get
[49:44] baptized the altar where your sacrifice
[49:46] is and you're believing well the
[49:48] sacrifice is going to make me righteous
[49:51] because I'm looking at the sacrifice I'm
[49:52] looking at the shed blood but you're not
[49:54] in the holy of holies yet you're not
[49:56] saved until you're born again you just
[49:58] turn your face toward it you just turn
[50:01] your face toward something but when you
[50:02] accept Christ you're born again in 1
[50:06] Corinthians 12:3 it says wherefore I
[50:08] give you to understand that no man
[50:10] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[50:12] Jesus a cursed and that no man can say
[50:14] that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[50:17] Ghost now many people say he's the Lord
[50:19] but you can't actually say it by
[50:21] Revelation until you've gone into the
[50:23] holy of holies you can't say he's Lord
[50:25] of your life that you can't say that
[50:27] he's living on the throne of your heart
[50:29] until you're born again so he said he
[50:32] said you're complete in Christ and
[50:33] you're not saved because that you pack a
[50:36] crucifix now that's a good Justified
[50:38] person maybe you you got a crucifix in
[50:40] your car and and you're saying well this
[50:42] is it I I've come I've I've been
[50:44] baptized and this is it no you are just
[50:46] getting started you're not saved because
[50:49] you go to church you're not saved
[50:51] because you know your catechism or your
[50:53] textbook you're not even saved because
[50:55] you know the Bible you you are saved
[50:57] because you know the person Jesus Christ
[51:00] and what does he say to know him is life
[51:04] now there's the thing we're getting to
[51:06] is life life when the when deity is
[51:09] expressed in your members and you're not
[51:11] just you're just not memorizing things
[51:13] and going through an act and trying to
[51:15] make something work but Christ is
[51:17] actually living in you not even to know
[51:19] his word is life but to know him the
[51:22] person is life there's only one way to
[51:24] know him that's to be born again of the
[51:27] spirit of God Amen something begins to
[51:30] work at
[51:31] justification oh yeah amen but but
[51:33] you're not born again yet you still got
[51:36] the same habits amen right brother amen
[51:39] you still got the same see that as those
[51:42] those habits are the things I'm I'm
[51:43] trying to get away from those habits are
[51:46] those things I remember years ago that
[51:47] you you don't have you'd have when I was
[51:49] coming to the Lord you'd have these bad
[51:51] habits you're like well how can I get
[51:52] rid of these things how I I I want to
[51:54] get rid of these thoughts in my mind I
[51:56] want to get rid of all the the my incl
[51:58] it's your inclination to do wrong how
[52:01] can I get rid of that so that there's
[52:03] something in me that magnetizes me to
[52:05] the word and magnetizes me to the right
[52:08] instead of magnetizes me to the wrong
[52:11] there you got to have something on the
[52:12] inside that changes you so that you're
[52:14] not leaning toward the wrong but you're
[52:16] leaning toward the right and then even
[52:18] if you mess up even if you fall down in
[52:20] the mud you get back up again cuz you're
[52:21] leaning to the right you want to be
[52:23] right that's what the Holy Ghost life
[52:25] inside of a believer does and and an
[52:28] unbeliever you or a person still in a
[52:30] state of justification they got the same
[52:32] habits the same old thoughts the same
[52:35] old desires the old man is still there
[52:38] that unclean spirit is happily living in
[52:40] your soul what's the unan spirit it's
[52:43] that thing that gives you that
[52:45] inclination it's leaning you toward the
[52:49] wrong now listen I know we've got people
[52:52] sitting here this morning in different
[52:53] stages of their journey and if you're at
[52:55] a stage of maybe a a more stage of
[52:58] maturity or something where maybe you
[53:00] feel that this doesn't quite apply to
[53:02] you draw don't draw up on me but pull on
[53:04] it because you want somebody else to get
[53:06] a blessing don't go to sleep on me
[53:08] because you don't think it applies to
[53:09] you or your situation don't don't draw
[53:12] up on me because maybe you've heard it
[53:13] so much before but this is a time for
[53:15] you to pull and say preach it brother
[53:17] because if I've already got it somebody
[53:19] else can get it
[53:21] too in John 3:5 he said Jesus answered
[53:25] verily very this is what Jesus telling
[53:27] Nicodemus verily verily I say unto thee
[53:30] except a man be born of water and of the
[53:33] spirit the washing of the water of the
[53:35] word the word and of the spirit he
[53:37] cannot enter into the kingdom of God in
[53:40] other words he's saying you might be
[53:42] living a good clean life you might be
[53:44] good living a good Pharisee life you
[53:46] might know all about the scriptures
[53:48] because you've been going to synagogue
[53:50] and you've been taught and everything
[53:52] but that ain't good enough you got to be
[53:54] born of water and of the spirit
[53:56] in other words there is no sh at
[53:59] justification there's no shity at
[54:01] sanctification you got to be born of the
[54:04] water in the spirit you might have a
[54:06] measure of life in your spiritual
[54:07] journey you might have like a a little
[54:09] baby beating the muscles twitching in
[54:11] this Mother's Mo womb but you don't have
[54:14] life yet life has not come into you I I
[54:18] was sharing this little video with
[54:19] Esther of this doctor that this little
[54:22] baby was born and the little baby was uh
[54:24] laying there and that doctor was just so
[54:27] calm that baby was born still born and
[54:30] he would just got to working on that
[54:31] baby and he had just work for minutes
[54:34] and minutes and that baby wasn't
[54:36] breathing but all of a sudden what he
[54:38] was doing began to take effect he you
[54:40] know massaged the muscles and and he he
[54:43] knew how to do it and all of a sudden
[54:45] that little baby took a break of Life
[54:47] Breath of Life now that same thing will
[54:50] happen to you in the Supernatural in the
[54:53] natural that happens when you you take
[54:55] that breath of natural life and and the
[54:56] life enters into you but there's
[54:58] something else has got to happen to
[55:00] bring you to a state that what it brings
[55:02] you back to what we lost in the Garden
[55:04] of Eden that eternal life brings you
[55:06] back to where we we we come where we're
[55:08] supposed to be at it brings you back to
[55:11] the place where God where because of our
[55:13] Disobedience and because of our sin we
[55:15] were severed from relationship and
[55:17] fellowship with God and restores us back
[55:19] to that and there'll come a time in your
[55:21] Supernatural Journey when you'll take a
[55:23] breath just like that and it's it let me
[55:26] PE people try to explain way something
[55:28] happening when you're born again but
[55:30] something Supernatural happens in the
[55:32] same way that something happens when
[55:34] that natural baby takes a breath of
[55:37] life and life comes in now now this is
[55:41] what I'm getting to you might not run or
[55:42] shout you might not leap about you might
[55:45] not do many things but I tell you what
[55:47] you will believe God's word and your
[55:50] life will begin to change you will begin
[55:52] to be regenerated because the express
[55:55] you are the express of the attributes of
[55:57] God and the same characteristics that
[56:00] were in Jesus Christ are expressed in
[56:02] you and you might not always run around
[56:04] and Shout like everybody does and you
[56:05] might not do all the things that maybe
[56:07] the religious world says that you should
[56:09] do but nevertheless you are an
[56:11] expression of deity God living in you
[56:14] and that's why you can't stop at
[56:17] justification you got to keep going on
[56:19] don't be satisfied with a state of
[56:21] sanctification you got to keep going on
[56:24] never be satisfied you got you do you
[56:27] realize that's what the fivefold
[56:28] ministry is to do is to continually push
[56:31] and encourage you don't stay where you
[56:35] are don't get to a place where you think
[56:37] this is good enough you got to keep
[56:39] pressing
[56:41] on he said and you must be born again he
[56:44] said no matter how much that we think we
[56:46] try to think we are right and saying a
[56:48] Creed or joining a
[56:50] church you're still what you were right
[56:53] until you're actually born again of the
[56:55] spirit of God
[56:57] hallelujah amen you're still what you
[57:00] were until you actually born again in
[57:03] the spirit of God
[57:05] Amen saying a Creed joining a church I
[57:09] you well we're not a denomination we
[57:10] can't just say a Creed and join a
[57:13] church come on now my
[57:17] friends he said it doesn't change you
[57:20] right your Creed joining church or
[57:22] changing your ideas or your good
[57:24] intentions look look let's really
[57:26] examine this changing your ideas that's
[57:30] not good enough no good intentions
[57:33] that's not good enough although as good
[57:36] as it might seem it's still not right
[57:40] there's something got to happen amen the
[57:44] new birth is an
[57:46] experience something that takes place
[57:49] amen and we've always heard the you know
[57:51] pre Preachers preached on it for years
[57:53] that when when you're born again it
[57:55] naturally birth you know when that baby
[57:57] starts crying and the spiritual birth
[57:59] the baby's going to come forth crying
[58:01] out ABA father it's going to come forth
[58:03] with a desire for his daddy amen what
[58:07] what kind of experience are we talking
[58:09] about a personal encounter with Christ
[58:12] where you've read about it and you you
[58:14] learned about it but then now then you
[58:16] meet him you meet him it's a revelatory
[58:21] experience that transforms you deep
[58:23] within because Christ has become
[58:26] personally known you know him it's not
[58:29] it's not that you're just reading about
[58:30] it but now you know him I tell you what
[58:32] when you know him then you can fall in
[58:34] love with him when you begin to know him
[58:36] in those dark moments you praying beside
[58:38] your bed at night like David tossed
[58:40] around to deep call to the deep as what
[58:42] he would say then you begin to know him
[58:44] it's not just something that you've
[58:45] heard about but you know him it is a
[58:48] deep internal change a complete shift of
[58:51] your nature now now reg the the new
[58:54] birth let's not get this wrong the new
[58:55] birth is a start of your regeneration
[58:58] you're going to begin to grow in a
[59:00] stature of a perfect man but I tell you
[59:02] what when you're born again it starts
[59:04] something it's going to start a change
[59:06] something begins to change and it makes
[59:07] you different deep internal change a
[59:10] complete shift of nature desires and
[59:13] your thinking you know you're not
[59:14] Desiring the things of the world but
[59:16] what you want is you want more of God
[59:18] because you know the way to the life is
[59:21] the is through the word if you're going
[59:23] to get more life you got to come to the
[59:24] word you tell me a born again Christian
[59:27] don't want some some more word you tell
[59:29] me a born again Christian don't want to
[59:30] be in the house of God there something
[59:32] that changes when you're born again and
[59:34] you want more of the word because it
[59:36] brings you to the life not just a change
[59:38] in Behavior but a transformation of
[59:40] identity amen right there might be
[59:43] physical and emotional
[59:46] reactions there probably are going to be
[59:48] little spots and spits and Spurs here
[59:51] and there crying in the shower crying in
[59:54] the car praising God on the way to work
[59:57] something's going to happen when when
[59:58] life comes in and I don't believe in a
[1:00:01] go cold dead formal religion where you
[1:00:04] just come to church and sit on the Pew
[1:00:06] and say well I got it I believe that
[1:00:08] when life comes something begins to
[1:00:09] happen something begins to transform
[1:00:12] your being it's the death of the old
[1:00:14] self and when your old self begins to
[1:00:16] die out you tell me that something can
[1:00:19] happen with with when you're dying you
[1:00:22] got to die to your old self before you
[1:00:24] can be born again the old has got to die
[1:00:28] you're moving away from all those
[1:00:29] worldly desires and sins and when you're
[1:00:32] filled with the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost will Empower you to be to live a
[1:00:37] Christian Life of service right it
[1:00:40] empowers you to live a life for others
[1:00:42] amen and brother R will say a new birth
[1:00:46] can be without
[1:00:49] sensation why because he's saying that
[1:00:52] the new birth does not
[1:00:54] necessarily rely
[1:00:56] on outward signs and Sensations and
[1:01:00] emotions when you're born again you
[1:01:02] might not necessarily see all of those
[1:01:06] things that the religious World
[1:01:08] typically likes to label you know the
[1:01:10] Pentecostals used to wonder well they
[1:01:12] used to say well if unless you speak in
[1:01:13] tongues unless you do this we're always
[1:01:16] trying to find a thing that we can label
[1:01:18] unless you do this thing unless you cry
[1:01:20] unless You Weep unless you shout unless
[1:01:21] you run the a but he's saying the new
[1:01:24] birth will be without sensation you
[1:01:25] might see all those different things but
[1:01:28] what you will see is a faith and a
[1:01:31] regenerated life
[1:01:33] amen faith and a regenerated life in
[1:01:36] Christ are at the core of the new birth
[1:01:38] amen even if you don't see emotional
[1:01:40] displays it's about being filled with
[1:01:43] God's spirit and transformed in
[1:01:45] obedience to his
[1:01:47] word which might not always come with
[1:01:49] outward actions or immediate signs that
[1:01:51] other people can look
[1:01:54] at and it all starts with justification
[1:01:57] MH right justification starts when a man
[1:02:00] realizes he is justly under God's
[1:02:03] condemnation and wrath and there might
[1:02:05] be some of you sitting here this morning
[1:02:07] that are realizing God's got a right to
[1:02:10] judge me to send me to hell right God's
[1:02:14] got a right to send me to hell now
[1:02:16] that's when justification actually
[1:02:17] starts something begins to click and you
[1:02:20] begin to realize I I ain't the way that
[1:02:22] I should and if I were to die right now
[1:02:25] I would not go to heaven y I would not I
[1:02:29] something needs to take place and what
[1:02:32] what begins to take place is when that
[1:02:34] really begins to click you become
[1:02:35] consumed with a desire to return to
[1:02:38] God's Divine favor you realize that if
[1:02:41] God would have judge you right now that
[1:02:43] you would go if if the floor were to
[1:02:45] open up you'd go right down to Hell and
[1:02:48] and there wouldn't be nothing to stop
[1:02:50] that and I tell you what that that'll
[1:02:52] get the wheels turning you begin
[1:02:55] consumed like like David crying out on
[1:02:57] his bed the Deep calleth unto the Deep
[1:02:59] at the noise of thy water sprouts what
[1:03:01] is it is something within you crying out
[1:03:03] there's something wrong with me there's
[1:03:05] something wrong and it can only be
[1:03:07] satisfied by the sacrifice of a holy God
[1:03:09] a holy God making an atonement for me
[1:03:12] amen you know and and Jesus said I think
[1:03:14] that's why he said in Matthew Chapter 5
[1:03:16] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:03:18] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:03:20] should be filled if you just got a
[1:03:23] hunger down in your soul to be made
[1:03:26] right then there's a promise that God
[1:03:28] will fill you that he will feel that
[1:03:30] appetite and in John chapter 6 he said
[1:03:33] Jesus answer answered them and said unto
[1:03:34] them murmur not among yourselves no man
[1:03:37] can come to me except the Father which
[1:03:39] has sent me draw him and I will raise
[1:03:41] him up at the last day it is written in
[1:03:44] the prophets and they shall be all
[1:03:45] taught of God how does God draw us he
[1:03:47] draws Us by demonstrating his power and
[1:03:49] his life so that we can see that life
[1:03:52] and then he begins to preach the word to
[1:03:53] bring us into condemnation and it's is
[1:03:55] actually God this morning drawing at you
[1:03:58] and pulling at you pulling you into that
[1:04:00] holy of holies to draw you and to compel
[1:04:03] you to come in F the hedges and the
[1:04:05] byways to come in and to not stay where
[1:04:07] you are there's a promise in Ezekiel 36
[1:04:10] of justification that God can take that
[1:04:12] heart that Stony heart and begin to
[1:04:14] soften it up he said a new heart also
[1:04:16] will I give you and a new spirit I'll
[1:04:19] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:04:20] flesh and I will give you an heart of
[1:04:22] Flesh and that's what justification
[1:04:24] begins to do to to a to to to just a
[1:04:27] little worldly person it begins to
[1:04:29] soften up their heart to where God can
[1:04:31] and brother Ram compared it like like
[1:04:33] like a apple that gets all bruised up
[1:04:37] over time it gets bruised and becomes
[1:04:39] mellow so mellow that a little baby
[1:04:43] could sit down and eat it now this
[1:04:45] morning aren't you glad that God's
[1:04:47] working on us that he don't lead us
[1:04:50] leave us all Hard Hearted sitting out
[1:04:53] there in the world coming home from work
[1:04:55] drinking your alcohol and going to sleep
[1:04:58] getting up the next morning with a
[1:04:59] hangover and think this is all there is
[1:05:01] to life but you come and get around
[1:05:03] Believers or somebody begins to testify
[1:05:05] to you at work and you begin to realize
[1:05:07] that there's a purpose in your life that
[1:05:09] you ain't supposed to go through life
[1:05:11] like that that there's a purpose and a
[1:05:13] calling for your life and it begins to
[1:05:15] soften up your heart and God begins to
[1:05:17] draw you soften up your heart it's like
[1:05:19] a little bruised Apple the little baby
[1:05:21] could eat a baby don't that doesn't have
[1:05:23] teeth could just so soft and tender now
[1:05:26] that's that's somebody dealing with
[1:05:28] somebody in justification what does a
[1:05:30] justifi Justified person look like it
[1:05:32] looks like somebody that puts their
[1:05:34] faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] that's job on his Ash sheep he had
[1:05:39] confidence in those ashes of the ashes
[1:05:41] of his sacrifice no matter what came in
[1:05:43] his life he was going to he he wasn't
[1:05:45] looking at what he had done but he was
[1:05:47] looking at his sacrifice and a Justified
[1:05:50] person will turn
[1:05:51] around it's going to have a strong
[1:05:53] desire to repent and live differently
[1:05:56] a Justified person is going to start
[1:05:58] Desiring to come to church and what does
[1:06:00] a Justified person do they've had their
[1:06:02] guilt of sin removed offering peace with
[1:06:05] God Amen although the person is yet not
[1:06:08] yet fully Sanctified they can now
[1:06:10] approach god without the burden of guilt
[1:06:14] that once weighed them down what does
[1:06:16] justification do it's legal and we're
[1:06:20] talking about life this morning
[1:06:22] justification don't have nothing to do
[1:06:24] with your character that's right that's
[1:06:26] why you can't stay at justification you
[1:06:29] go into the courtroom and because you're
[1:06:31] Justified the the judge can't swing as
[1:06:33] gavel and send you to the prison cuz
[1:06:35] you've been Justified and Justified is
[1:06:38] more than just a a pardon of all of your
[1:06:40] sins but it's actually it affects how
[1:06:43] God looks at you it's how God looks at
[1:06:45] you that you are righteous in God's
[1:06:47] sight because he's paid the price for
[1:06:49] you oh this morning aren't you glad that
[1:06:52] you've got a lamb that's over there in
[1:06:54] Revelation when when we preach on that
[1:06:56] we've got a lamb to make us worthy to
[1:06:57] read the seals and it wasn't by our own
[1:06:59] doing it wasn't by our own works but
[1:07:01] we've got a lamb they had a lamb in the
[1:07:03] Garden of Eden to pay the price God come
[1:07:06] down and killed a lamb and the whole
[1:07:08] scripture testifies that God would come
[1:07:10] down a holy God that required that a god
[1:07:13] of Integrity that required Justice that
[1:07:16] satisfied Justice through a lamb that he
[1:07:19] offered on the on the cross what is it
[1:07:21] justification changes your legal status
[1:07:24] but not your character that's right
[1:07:27] justification is an acquittal from guilt
[1:07:29] y as though your innocence has been
[1:07:31] proven y right it was as though somebody
[1:07:33] come running in there and said he's not
[1:07:35] he's actually not guilty because God
[1:07:37] looks not at you but at your sacrifice
[1:07:40] at what Jesus did for you on the cross
[1:07:43] justification is solely an objective
[1:07:46] change in your standing in relation to
[1:07:49] the law and it's immediate it's an
[1:07:51] immediate legal Declaration of
[1:07:53] righteousness it don't take long workup
[1:07:56] but you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] and you are Justified amen it's the
[1:08:00] opposite of to condemn it is a legal
[1:08:03] change from a state of guilt and
[1:08:05] condemnation to a state of forgiveness
[1:08:08] and acceptance but it has nothing to do
[1:08:11] with your nature that's right it has
[1:08:13] nothing to do with your character amen
[1:08:15] it only has to do with the way that God
[1:08:17] is looking to you from a legal
[1:08:19] perspective legal righteousness is not a
[1:08:22] habit infused into your heart but a gift
[1:08:24] transferred to your account it's not a
[1:08:27] habit transferred into your in your
[1:08:29] heart and that's why you got to come to
[1:08:32] it but you can't stay you can't stay at
[1:08:36] justification it it's what we're talking
[1:08:39] about is where is your anchor hooked on
[1:08:41] if you're at justification your anchor
[1:08:43] is not clipped on to the Rock of Ages
[1:08:45] yet it's not clipped on to something and
[1:08:47] that's why so many people their ship
[1:08:49] drifts back out into the world after a
[1:08:52] while because they're trying to live by
[1:08:54] their little faith they puny little
[1:08:56] faith they're they're looking to the
[1:08:58] Cross oh but when God gives you his
[1:09:00] faith that's an anchor that will hold
[1:09:02] you forever the anchor of his faith at
[1:09:04] the new birth will anchor you to the
[1:09:06] Rock of
[1:09:07] Ages justification is perfect for
[1:09:10] deathbed confessions it's it's great for
[1:09:13] that that that last little moment where
[1:09:14] you say well I you confess your sin
[1:09:17] there and a soldier on the battlefield
[1:09:18] that's been shot in the stomach and just
[1:09:21] there in that moment he begins to
[1:09:22] confess all his wrongs and say I'm
[1:09:24] looking to Jesus Christ and and and
[1:09:26] they're just like the thief on the cross
[1:09:28] this day you'll be with me in
[1:09:31] Paradise oh what a
[1:09:33] great but see in this hour in this hour
[1:09:36] where that we're living in you got to
[1:09:38] keep mve this treacherous hour where
[1:09:41] there's there's foolish foolish virgins
[1:09:44] and and and fakes and and and all these
[1:09:47] things you got to keep moving you can't
[1:09:49] stay at a con stage state of conception
[1:09:55] and questions and answers La law having
[1:09:57] a Shad brother Ram said you're born
[1:09:58] again when you receive the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost that's when you're
[1:10:03] converted you might be in process of
[1:10:06] conversion but you're not converted
[1:10:08] until it's completed amen and you're
[1:10:10] sealed into the kingdom of
[1:10:13] God plenty of Fallen away from
[1:10:16] justification plenty of turned around
[1:10:18] and then turned back turned back around
[1:10:20] plenty of started and and stayed
[1:10:23] put but we can't stay where we are no
[1:10:26] and the basis of Fellowship he said I
[1:10:28] want to ask you
[1:10:29] something if justification is all God
[1:10:32] requires I'd like to ask you this when
[1:10:36] the man was separated By the Waters of
[1:10:38] Separation sprinkled then he could not
[1:10:40] yet enter into the worship of the glory
[1:10:42] of the Lord he could not do it because
[1:10:44] he was only sprinkled from his sin right
[1:10:47] it separated from his sins but did not
[1:10:49] put him in Fellowship that's right it
[1:10:51] only separated from his sins now
[1:10:54] Ephesians said we are Washed by the
[1:10:56] Water of the word now hearing the word
[1:10:57] and being just as religious as you want
[1:10:59] to be and your pastor a scholar and your
[1:11:02] doctor of divinity a scholar still that
[1:11:04] don't put us in Fellowship no sir it
[1:11:07] will not do it now I got 10 more minutes
[1:11:10] so I'm going to try to Leap Frog let's
[1:11:13] let's
[1:11:14] see it's like it's like the children of
[1:11:16] Israel going through the Wilderness of
[1:11:18] the Wilderness of sin when they when
[1:11:20] they come across that uh across the Red
[1:11:23] Sea it they were in a state of
[1:11:25] justification look back and see all of
[1:11:27] your sins passed away and Mariam got her
[1:11:29] tambourine and she began to dance and
[1:11:31] praise God all those things that used to
[1:11:33] plague me all that all my past is going
[1:11:35] away but what if they had have stopped
[1:11:37] there they they had eaten the lamb they
[1:11:39] had the blood over the lentil of their
[1:11:41] door but what if they had stopped and
[1:11:43] not keep going on they would would never
[1:11:44] have reached that promised land they
[1:11:46] were in a place like real justification
[1:11:48] let makes you look back and you can say
[1:11:50] well what sin you can really have have
[1:11:52] have a h h have true confidence that
[1:11:55] come to God and all of your sin has been
[1:11:58] washed away when the Devil comes with
[1:12:00] all his accusations what sin are you
[1:12:02] talking
[1:12:03] about but you got got to keep going on
[1:12:06] because your character has not been
[1:12:08] changed and a hidden life in Christ
[1:12:10] brother R said there's many people today
[1:12:12] that's never went any farther than the
[1:12:14] outer Court the veil yet they are
[1:12:16] Christians they by the millions they
[1:12:19] enjoy Christ in an outward form coming
[1:12:23] to church Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:12:25] Christ in a Justified State they go to
[1:12:28] church with a consolation of knowing
[1:12:30] they belong belong to church but they
[1:12:32] have never become hid away with him in
[1:12:34] the inner court but out there they eat
[1:12:37] Mana see it matters it matters where
[1:12:40] you're eating you can eat the same word
[1:12:42] in the outer court and it won't have the
[1:12:44] same impact that it does in the in in
[1:12:47] the holy of holies that's right you can
[1:12:49] be sitting here in the same word but it
[1:12:51] matters where you are when you eat it
[1:12:53] amen you eat it and the holy place and
[1:12:56] it'll have a different impact than it
[1:12:58] does in the outer Court sir but it still
[1:13:00] won't have the same impact that it would
[1:13:01] if you're in the holy of holies right
[1:13:03] you got to go on to where the Mana keeps
[1:13:06] where it keeps and it doesn't grow stale
[1:13:08] and it doesn't have to keep being
[1:13:10] replenished we have to keep relighting
[1:13:12] the candlesticks and and massaging your
[1:13:14] experience going to a little Revival
[1:13:17] meeting to have a quick pickme up but
[1:13:19] you go on into the holy of holies and
[1:13:21] the Mana will keep justification is a
[1:13:24] change of legal state status but
[1:13:26] sanctification begins to produce a moral
[1:13:29] transformation of character and this is
[1:13:31] that little spot that is so dangerous
[1:13:34] and this is really the Crux of what I'm
[1:13:35] getting at that you can't stay you you
[1:13:37] sure can't stay at just you can't stay
[1:13:39] at justification but you definitely
[1:13:41] can't stay at sanctification
[1:13:43] sanctification is that spot that you got
[1:13:45] to go but you can't stay there you can't
[1:13:48] stay there what salv
[1:13:51] sanctification salvation from sin
[1:13:53] requires both a
[1:13:55] clearing justification and a cleansing
[1:13:59] amen and why are you being cleaned up M
[1:14:02] cuz the whole house is getting swept and
[1:14:04] and cleaned out because the king is
[1:14:06] coming you got to get everything PR
[1:14:08] prepared before the king can come first
[1:14:11] you got to get your name cleared first
[1:14:13] you got to be justified you got to have
[1:14:15] your name cleared and then then let's
[1:14:17] get this place cleaned up so you have a
[1:14:19] good a good moral life you're trying to
[1:14:21] do things you're trying to trying to
[1:14:23] clean things up because God is Not going
[1:14:25] to come in a filthy
[1:14:27] place and something's moving at at
[1:14:30] sanctification something's moving but it
[1:14:33] ain't yet alive right now that's that
[1:14:36] that's that whole debate about abortion
[1:14:38] in the world it's moving it's moving in
[1:14:41] Mama's womb but it's not yet alive it
[1:14:45] hadn't toen that taken that breath yet
[1:14:47] it's moving it's alive but it's not yet
[1:14:50] alive it's not that life that we're
[1:14:53] getting to now that's the same thing in
[1:14:54] the spiritual birth it's moving but it
[1:14:57] ain't alive yet am in sanctification
[1:14:59] something is actually imparted to us but
[1:15:02] in justification it is only imputed
[1:15:04] sanctification imparts a love for God a
[1:15:06] capacity to worship Him acceptably and a
[1:15:09] meekness for heaven justification is by
[1:15:12] a righteousness without us
[1:15:14] sanctification is by a Holiness wrought
[1:15:16] in US justification removes the
[1:15:19] obligation to punishment and
[1:15:21] sanctification cleanses you from
[1:15:23] pollution amen cuz you got to be made
[1:15:25] holy for the king aren't you glad that
[1:15:27] the king wants to come and sit down on
[1:15:29] the throne of your heart come down and
[1:15:31] make your heart his seat his Mercy Seat
[1:15:33] where he can set himself down and begin
[1:15:35] to transform you from the inside but
[1:15:37] before he can come you got to be cleaned
[1:15:39] out you got to be and what does the
[1:15:41] clean and it's the word it's the word
[1:15:43] that made you want to be justified it's
[1:15:45] the word that began to mold your life in
[1:15:48] a state of sanctification it's the word
[1:15:50] that made you want to be a Christian
[1:15:52] it's the word that made you want to
[1:15:54] worship and of sanctification because
[1:15:56] God is cleaning up the place so that he
[1:15:58] can come and take his Abode in
[1:16:01] you you got to get rid of that unclean
[1:16:03] Spirit though in the power of God
[1:16:04] brother R said there was a young lady
[1:16:06] came out of a store that was immorally
[1:16:07] dressed little bitty old clothes like
[1:16:10] you wear here and everywhere else you
[1:16:11] know just
[1:16:12] indecently he said what makes somebody
[1:16:16] what makes the world dress the way that
[1:16:19] do they do what makes people act in the
[1:16:21] way it's an unclean Spirit right it's a
[1:16:24] spirit Spirit a little devil down in
[1:16:27] their heart that's making them act the
[1:16:29] way that they do and he said the unclean
[1:16:31] Spirit what does it do he goes over and
[1:16:34] gets into this person and begins to tell
[1:16:36] him this and you know what he does it's
[1:16:38] just like what Jesus said you can pass
[1:16:40] the Seas to make one price of light and
[1:16:43] what easy when you get through with him
[1:16:46] he's talking about that unclean Spirit
[1:16:47] goes out comes and returns back with all
[1:16:50] of his buddies and now you got just a a
[1:16:53] more two-fold child of hell than he is
[1:16:55] to start with but now let's meditate on
[1:16:57] that this morning don't get tired on me
[1:16:59] hold on just a minute goad you got an
[1:17:01] unclean Spirit when you're when you're
[1:17:03] out in the world sir and you ain't
[1:17:05] living for God there is a spirit in your
[1:17:07] brother will say there's a spirit that
[1:17:09] keeps you from responding to the word
[1:17:12] and that Spirit when you come into a
[1:17:14] real Holy Ghost filled meeting you come
[1:17:16] up for prayer and a and a real Holy
[1:17:18] Ghost anointed preacher can lay hands on
[1:17:20] you and we're we're called to cast that
[1:17:23] Spirit out and then when that spirit is
[1:17:26] cast out then you can really begin to
[1:17:29] respond the way that God always wanted
[1:17:31] you to you can respond and you can begin
[1:17:33] to believe and you can be you can come
[1:17:36] and sit in church in a real Sanctified
[1:17:39] condition yes sir Sanctified because
[1:17:41] that Spirit has been cleaned out but the
[1:17:43] danger of sanctification sir is that you
[1:17:46] start off in a good clean moral
[1:17:49] condition but if you stay there too long
[1:17:52] yes sir come on the danger is that
[1:17:54] unclean spirit will go out and get all
[1:17:57] his buddies and bring them back and find
[1:17:59] the place all nice and clean it's been
[1:18:02] cleaned out for the king but you stopped
[1:18:05] you stopped and you stayed where you
[1:18:07] were you because you thought that you
[1:18:10] had the new birth you stopped you were
[1:18:13] going to church and you were worshiping
[1:18:14] you were crying in church and all those
[1:18:16] things and you stopped and what the
[1:18:19] devil does he'll go and he he'll leave
[1:18:21] you in a nice clean moral State oh yeah
[1:18:24] but what he'll do is he'll bring all of
[1:18:27] his buddies back and he'll make you
[1:18:29] worse and you become like a like a
[1:18:31] horrible old Pharisee right and that's
[1:18:34] why brother Brandon would preach those
[1:18:36] sermons about the meanest man I know
[1:18:38] that Pharisee sitting there mocking
[1:18:40] Jesus over in the corner he was a
[1:18:42] religious person a religious hypocrite
[1:18:45] you couldn't put one finger on his life
[1:18:48] and that's why you know the the longer I
[1:18:51] live as a Christian the less I care
[1:18:53] about all the dos and don'ts it's about
[1:18:55] your character it's about your life we
[1:18:58] come and we we try to compare things
[1:19:00] that we're doing and what everybody else
[1:19:02] is doing but that that's what a old
[1:19:04] Pharisee will
[1:19:06] do I don't want to be like that Pharisee
[1:19:09] sitting over there you caused the blind
[1:19:11] man to be healed on the Sabbath you went
[1:19:14] down to the bull of Bethesda and you
[1:19:16] raised him up on the Sabbath day and and
[1:19:18] all the you all these accusation we we
[1:19:21] we pay ties of all these things but we
[1:19:23] yeah we don't pay ties of mint and cumin
[1:19:25] but we're doing all these other things
[1:19:27] that we're supposed to be doing and it
[1:19:29] that mean those mean what is it pride
[1:19:31] and enity and jealousy and all those
[1:19:34] things sat down in your heart and you
[1:19:37] begin to look with a crooked finger at
[1:19:39] other people and say well I'm doing
[1:19:41] things that you're not and it turns you
[1:19:44] into that now that's that's a worst
[1:19:46] state that's what the first seal is
[1:19:48] about a genuine Holy Ghost filled
[1:19:50] believer and a fake that go reding out
[1:19:53] and how you to tell the difference in
[1:19:55] until you come to a place of maturity
[1:19:57] and you can look and see well there goes
[1:19:59] there's the lion and there's the white
[1:20:01] horse rider a faker that's sitting there
[1:20:04] in the house of God and faking all this
[1:20:07] time all these years and as fake as
[1:20:10] anything
[1:20:11] fake brother would say that white white
[1:20:15] horse rider is what it is it's a it's a
[1:20:17] foolish virgin that sits and acts like a
[1:20:20] real believer but the whole time it's
[1:20:23] just feel it's a house of Devils
[1:20:25] whitewashed on the outside but all of
[1:20:27] those Devils have come and incarnated
[1:20:30] thems in that person and made them made
[1:20:33] them what a mean person
[1:20:37] amen Matthew 12: 43 he said when the
[1:20:40] unclean spirit is gone out of a man he
[1:20:42] walketh through Dry places seeketh rest
[1:20:45] and findeth none right then he saith I
[1:20:47] will return unto my house from whence I
[1:20:49] came out and when he has come he findeth
[1:20:51] it empty swept and garnished then go
[1:20:54] goeth he and taketh with himself seven
[1:20:56] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[1:21:00] and they enter in and dwell there and
[1:21:02] the last state of that man is worse than
[1:21:05] the first now if you could just picture
[1:21:07] in your mind if you could look at my
[1:21:09] notes I've got a picture here of this
[1:21:10] spook going out of a house the unclean
[1:21:13] Spirit leaves out of the house but if
[1:21:15] you stop and you don't keep going on
[1:21:18] here comes that spook back with seven of
[1:21:21] his
[1:21:23] friends m what is mere moral Improvement
[1:21:26] without true spiritual transformation am
[1:21:30] can leave a person vulnerable to worse
[1:21:33] demonic influence cuz why you got to get
[1:21:36] the you got to get Faith there to stand
[1:21:38] at the door and keep that devil out
[1:21:41] because if if faith if the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:44] not in your house that it's been
[1:21:46] prepared for then the devil will bring
[1:21:49] all of his buddies back and you will
[1:21:51] still be in a state of moral a good
[1:21:54] moral Christian and you'll be sitting
[1:21:56] there like like I'll use this as an
[1:21:58] example Ron Spencer with all he's going
[1:22:00] through all this cancer trouble and yet
[1:22:03] preaching the gospel and and suffering
[1:22:05] through it an example of faith and S
[1:22:07] people will sit there writing their
[1:22:08] letters the reason you got cancer is
[1:22:11] because you ain't living for the Lord or
[1:22:14] because you got secret sin or whatever
[1:22:16] that is it's it's meanness and mean mean
[1:22:20] that's why all these times that brother
[1:22:22] Ram would hammer on how that the devil l
[1:22:24] loves church just as much as you do the
[1:22:27] devil will come and sit down and make a
[1:22:29] a lot of critical that critical spirit
[1:22:33] criticizing the movement of the Holy
[1:22:35] Ghost criticizing a good Holy Ghost camp
[1:22:37] meeting criticizing the real baptism of
[1:22:39] the Holy Ghost Pride imity a bunch of
[1:22:42] jealous preachers pointing fingers at
[1:22:44] one another and it's actually it's what
[1:22:46] is it the same battle that's been going
[1:22:49] on from the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel
[1:22:52] Jacob and Esau Judas and Jesus all the
[1:22:55] way down God camped out in his church
[1:22:58] and the devil camped out right there
[1:23:00] with him right alongside of
[1:23:03] him what is it Pharisees I'm I'm going
[1:23:05] to keep going just a little bit longer
[1:23:07] Pharisees seated themselves in positions
[1:23:09] of
[1:23:11] authority this is what the Pharisee does
[1:23:14] all their deeds were done for show
[1:23:16] seeking praise greetings in Marcus and
[1:23:18] the title Rabbi they they wanted that
[1:23:20] title Rabbi and you'll see the the mark
[1:23:23] of the devil
[1:23:25] the devil always wants he's got these
[1:23:27] characteristics he always wants power he
[1:23:30] wants praise and he wants recognition
[1:23:33] the devil ain't going to take the
[1:23:37] backseat he wants people to be telling
[1:23:39] him how good he's do it and telling him
[1:23:42] this and setting him up on a pedestal
[1:23:44] because that's the characteristics of
[1:23:45] the devil and you watch it compare that
[1:23:48] the characteristics of Christ is he's
[1:23:50] fine with a Manger he's fine he's fine
[1:23:52] with a little manger but the devil got
[1:23:54] to have the first place that was what
[1:23:57] started out in the in in heaven the
[1:23:58] devil come out and he wanted all the
[1:24:00] angels to come to him because he wanted
[1:24:02] to usurp Authority he wanted to be the
[1:24:04] big shot and that same
[1:24:07] characteristics oh brother that's why
[1:24:08] brother R would say God is always
[1:24:10] identified by his characteristics
[1:24:12] because when you look at a real Born
[1:24:13] Again cre Christian you can see the same
[1:24:16] characteristics of Christ in that person
[1:24:18] and the same way you can see the devil
[1:24:21] moving and and and working in the church
[1:24:23] he said that's
[1:24:26] right the devil loves to come to
[1:24:28] church
[1:24:31] amen you can't stay where you're at if
[1:24:34] you remain in a state of sanctification
[1:24:36] you become susceptible to
[1:24:39] self-righteousness always seeking honor
[1:24:41] and titles and status while neglecting
[1:24:45] real sincerity and Faith amen if you
[1:24:47] stay in a state of sanctification too
[1:24:49] long you become susceptible to a neglect
[1:24:52] of inner Purity you're focusing on all
[1:24:54] these outward things let's make sure the
[1:24:56] outside is is painted white the outside
[1:24:58] looks real good but inside you're
[1:25:01] lacking real inner Holiness and
[1:25:03] commitment to God brother outside
[1:25:06] outside you're you're always placing
[1:25:08] judgment on others while you're failing
[1:25:11] to examine your own sins and your own
[1:25:14] faults all the you look at all there's a
[1:25:16] reason why all these things that the FES
[1:25:18] were laid out plainly for us in
[1:25:20] scripture you healed a blind man on the
[1:25:21] Sabbath day you didn't wash your hands
[1:25:24] you didn't wash your hand you refused
[1:25:26] they refused to enter Pilot's residence
[1:25:28] to avoid ritual defilement while they
[1:25:31] were putting a man to death this
[1:25:34] hypocrisy despite witnessing all these
[1:25:37] Miracles they continue to demand signs
[1:25:40] from Jesus as proof of his
[1:25:43] authority worse than being
[1:25:46] clean is being clean and mean yeah right
[1:25:49] amen and if you stay in sanctification
[1:25:51] you are susceptible to being clean and
[1:25:56] brother R would say there is Devils but
[1:25:58] Jesus cast them out and he gave his
[1:26:00] church authority to do
[1:26:02] so cast out devils in my name he cast
[1:26:06] Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one
[1:26:08] day and he said when the unclean Spirit
[1:26:10] has gone out of a man he walks in dry
[1:26:12] places returning back then bringing
[1:26:14] seven other Devils with him now that
[1:26:17] goes to show that if the man was cleaned
[1:26:20] of devils there was something in him had
[1:26:21] gone out yes right a devil had gone out
[1:26:26] now when the devil moved out God gives
[1:26:29] an
[1:26:30] opportunity to move in amen right and
[1:26:34] when he goes out let the Holy Spirit
[1:26:37] come in amen it it's all he's he's
[1:26:41] operated by our will right right we sit
[1:26:43] there and we're like well I'm fine and
[1:26:46] listen I've I've observed a minister
[1:26:48] can't help but observe you go through
[1:26:50] life and you look and you you just see
[1:26:52] you you can't stay you you can't stay
[1:26:54] where you are we can't stay on this
[1:26:56] Earth I got to get out of here you can't
[1:26:58] stay at justification you got to keep
[1:26:59] moving on you sure can't stay at
[1:27:02] sanctification because sanctification
[1:27:04] just opens up your whole psyche to all
[1:27:07] of this danger
[1:27:08] amen when he goes out let the holy
[1:27:11] spirit in don't just leave it there yes
[1:27:13] if you do just repent of your sins and
[1:27:15] go on then you're going to be worse off
[1:27:17] than ever but get that place where Satan
[1:27:20] once lived and occupied get it filled
[1:27:22] with the holy spirit of God and then
[1:27:25] you'll have the strength of God's word
[1:27:26] in you manifest it and cast out Devils C
[1:27:30] contest is on the evening lights are
[1:27:32] shining God's holy spirit is present how
[1:27:36] how do you get born again first you got
[1:27:38] to want it like those people out there
[1:27:41] on the day of Pentecost men and Brethren
[1:27:43] what what are we supposed to do you and
[1:27:46] and what makes you want it is you see
[1:27:47] the life if you heard the word preached
[1:27:49] to bring you to a state of condition and
[1:27:51] you begin to look at Jesus Christ not at
[1:27:54] you begin to look at his life and what
[1:27:55] he did for you and not not anybody else
[1:27:58] and not your own works and then you
[1:28:00] begin to press in and that's what I'm
[1:28:02] encouraging you this morning to press in
[1:28:05] never stop pressing in I remember my own
[1:28:08] spiritual battle I would pray through
[1:28:10] the night I would I would lay there
[1:28:12] until 2 or 3:00 in the morning because I
[1:28:14] wanted something from God and listen you
[1:28:16] don't have to pray it's not that we're
[1:28:18] laying out all these instructions you
[1:28:20] all you got to do is believe but there's
[1:28:22] something going to be in you something
[1:28:24] pulling you and drawing you that you'll
[1:28:26] press in you'll take the kingdom by
[1:28:28] force according to what the Bible said
[1:28:30] the Bible says you got to take the
[1:28:32] kingdom of Force if you want it like
[1:28:34] John took the little book then come on
[1:28:36] and take it if you want it you might as
[1:28:38] well take it why don't we stand to our
[1:28:40] feet as the musicians come there's a
[1:28:42] promise here laying for you and it's a
[1:28:44] promise of not just to act like a
[1:28:45] Christian but to be the real expression
[1:28:48] of deity what is the real Holy Ghost
[1:28:50] Field believer going to be like they're
[1:28:52] going to be the expression of every
[1:28:53] attri every characteristic of God
[1:28:56] expressing himself in your life
[1:28:58] expressing himself in the way that you
[1:28:59] talk and the way that you think and the
[1:29:01] way that you move in the way that you
[1:29:03] function to believe God's word and to
[1:29:05] regenerate your life that's what I'm
[1:29:07] looking for this morning is for the
[1:29:10] life you got to keep moving you can't
[1:29:13] stay in the same place
[1:29:16] amen you can't
[1:29:18] stay it's a life this morning as the
[1:29:22] musicians play thank you
[1:29:25] everything that brother Brown taught us
[1:29:26] was about the life David said that he'll
[1:29:28] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:29:31] water why you got to be planed you can't
[1:29:34] be stuck out like in a
[1:29:37] greenhouse maybe in justification you're
[1:29:39] like in a little pot still being moved
[1:29:42] about but when you're born again you are
[1:29:45] planted by the rivers of water and you
[1:29:48] get your nourishment from that
[1:29:51] water you ain't going to fall away if
[1:29:53] you're born again we sing that song
[1:29:55] something keeps holding me it's not that
[1:29:57] you're you're holding on but it's Christ
[1:29:59] is holding on to you cuz your roots have
[1:30:02] been planted way down in the earth and
[1:30:04] are soaking up the moisture from that
[1:30:07] River of Life it's a River of Life
[1:30:10] That's flowing through
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:14] us it's the River of Life I wonder if we
[1:30:17] if we'll turn our heads to the
[1:30:19] Earth if we'll just bow our heads this
[1:30:22] morning maybe there'll be somebody here
[1:30:25] this morning that felt that pricked in
[1:30:27] their heart by the word that was
[1:30:30] preached maybe you're realizing that
