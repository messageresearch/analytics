[0:00] you've killed back into 14 1,300 1,200
[0:05] somewhere and and they were all gathered
[0:09] into a that's where you get to work
[0:12] ghetto from right the word ghetto come
[0:15] from them ghetto means a gathering of
[0:19] undesirable people or something like to
[0:21] happening so they would round up all the
[0:23] Jews put them in a ghetto and and they
[0:24] would either turn the women to
[0:26] prostitution the men that would turn
[0:27] them into thieves and it was pretty
[0:30] horrible what they didn't do all right
[0:33] let's go
[0:34] Romans 12:1 talk about that in this
[0:35] afternoon I beseech you brethren ye
[0:38] therefore brethren oh why don't you
[0:41] bring your daughter you simply I mean
[0:43] eww you bring your mom away
[0:49] you brought your mama's favorite
[0:51] daughter good to have y'all with I
[1:07] beseech you therefore brethren oh this
[1:09] is Paul in Romans we're in verse in
[1:11] chapter 12 I beseech you therefore
[1:15] brethren by the mercies of God to
[1:18] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:20] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:22] reasonable service
[1:24] and that means rational it's a
[1:29] reasonable service right and be not
[1:32] conformed to this world because that's
[1:36] what we were when we were born here we
[1:38] were conformed to the world
[1:39] come it was done by a Bible study last
[1:41] night you know you don't you you in
[1:44] nature he give you memories and
[1:45] concentration imagination that's what
[1:47] you give that to you because they can
[1:48] give it to you but Satan comes in and
[1:50] perverts all that and then that nature
[1:53] attaches to your soul and if it stays
[1:55] that way and you make a wrong make
[1:57] decision after the age of accountability
[1:59] then that's all if that would pull on
[2:04] its way to Hell in black whatever we're
[2:06] going to call it because the spirit
[2:10] realm of man is
[2:12] say it works with where God works buddy
[2:14] okay even you'd be born again and you
[2:18] have bad dogs and do bad things okay
[2:22] that's why I thank God for a prophet
[2:24] that said you could be born again and
[2:26] you know be suicidal or are things like
[2:30] that go I hear mine he saw that I know
[2:32] he did remember he saw that one woman
[2:34] that was in them in the insane asylum
[2:37] but because of something that she had
[2:39] done back in her previous life and once
[2:42] all that came out she she became alright
[2:45] then you got rose out of the one that
[2:47] was a prostitute and drunk you know now
[2:49] she was some of my testifying in the
[2:52] glory of God but don't think for one
[2:54] minute Rosella didn't every day Satan
[2:57] remind her of what she did so that was
[3:00] in her memory that's what we were
[3:03] talking about during the whole point is
[3:06] that there's no way that your spirit
[3:09] realm can be totally born-again like
[3:13] your soul while you're still alive here
[3:15] you always got brother wrapped in and be
[3:17] sticky till the end all right so it's
[3:20] going to be sticky but something's going
[3:21] to change that you know the soul's gonna
[3:23] work its way out and change that but
[3:26] there's really you can't do anything
[3:27] about them even Jesus Almighty God
[3:31] himself he has the Holy Ghost in his
[3:33] spirit and he was still tempted brother
[3:36] best attempt among women same even
[3:38] coming Tim did father say to walk up to
[3:40] Almighty God and say hey you of you say
[3:43] you are do this do this do this then so
[3:46] on so don't be conformed to this world
[3:48] but be transformed by the renewing of
[3:52] your mind that you may prove what is
[3:55] that good and acceptable and perfect
[3:56] will of God because you will prove who
[4:02] you are we're continually doing that so
[4:06] why is the perfect will of God
[4:07] his will is his word it will is his word
[4:11] all the ways that when I look at that
[4:13] Bible I see that as just like you go and
[4:17] have a big family and we all go to a to
[4:21] an estate attorney and that attorney
[4:23] section
[4:24] he opens up the wheel and what does that
[4:27] will do that will tells you what you got
[4:33] because somebody had to die the testator
[4:35] had to die so you know without Jesus
[4:39] Christ dying the Bible's worthless
[4:40] anyway then you wouldn't be just a good
[4:44] prophet and just walked among men but
[4:46] since he died he brought the Old
[4:48] Testament the life and the New Testament
[4:50] Wow that's why Jesus Christ the will of
[4:52] God and you say well who's the executor
[4:54] of the will the Holy Ghost eat what is
[4:56] the executor doing the executor make
[4:58] sure that the will is carried out so
[5:01] when you get to baptism the Holy Ghost
[5:02] you get the executor of the will inside
[5:04] of you which is the Holy Ghost which is
[5:08] the one that says it tells you what's it
[5:11] what the will says all right and then
[5:14] you do then then it performs that for I
[5:18] say through the grace given unto me to
[5:20] every man that is among you not to think
[5:22] of himself more highly than he ought to
[5:24] think in other words you know don't put
[5:27] yourself above but think soberly let's
[5:32] look at that word right there because
[5:34] that word does not mean not a drunk all
[5:39] right all right
[5:41] it means let's do the school bell here
[5:44] you know over into onto to towards or
[5:47] among to in other words think sanely
[5:55] think according to the will of God all
[5:58] right because we remember a drunk person
[6:01] if you do use that allegory a drunk
[6:03] person doesn't think right there's a lot
[6:05] of things that they wouldn't do it they
[6:07] were in their sober mind
[6:08] so thanks same way with with with the
[6:11] world and truly the world's bunch of
[6:13] drunks now I'm not talking about liquid
[6:14] drugs yeah they're drunk on everything
[6:17] else right they're not sober you and I
[6:20] are the only sober people in the whole
[6:22] world that we have come to a place that
[6:24] God has give us something internally
[6:26] because the world thinks its externally
[6:29] you see these women on TV shows and
[6:31] stuff did that work 40 years ago and
[6:34] they think they're still that 40 year
[6:37] girl you know oh they look horrible sad
[6:40] well that's what they're doing they're
[6:41] living and I want progressive living in
[6:43] a rear view mirror yes and you and I
[6:47] should never live in a rear view mirror
[6:49] because what happened when you look in
[6:51] the rear view mirror and you drive it
[6:52] you have wrecked yeah reg so we don't
[6:58] want have a wreck we want to think
[6:59] soberly Cortney has gone as Delta every
[7:03] man the measure you see that which is
[7:04] measure every person has a measure of
[7:07] faith that's why we've been talking
[7:11] about laying on of hands or just
[7:13] speaking the word there's a measure of
[7:14] faith some are weak in faith some are
[7:18] strong in faith some are right in the
[7:20] middle but not everybody has the same
[7:23] measure because God had dealt to every
[7:26] man the measure of faith for as we have
[7:29] many members in one body and all the
[7:32] members have not the same office in
[7:34] other words everybody's not the finger
[7:36] are you body would just look like a
[7:38] banger no you've got all your different
[7:40] parts but not the same office or the
[7:47] same function see that word means
[7:49] function so you got this they don't have
[7:52] the same function if if your whole body
[7:54] was a with a heart you know you couldn't
[7:58] function you need all the other organs
[8:00] for everything to function together so
[8:04] we being many the body of Christ being
[8:07] men are one body in Christ when you go
[8:10] back to the scripture says not seeds as
[8:12] of many but one seed which is Christ
[8:15] because when we get into that future
[8:18] home and it's nothing but the bride
[8:20] excuse me in the 144,000 in that new
[8:23] city that is one body
[8:27] now you exclude 144,000 they're not a
[8:30] part of the body they're servants to the
[8:32] body but that one body of every how many
[8:34] millions of born-again people that live
[8:37] in that city they're one body
[8:39] all right now many members but one body
[8:44] same way now I mean you know a little
[8:48] millennium I'll be in the future
[8:49] but I'm saying now we're scattered among
[8:51] the heathen yes you know so but then man
[8:55] it's gonna be all brought into one place
[8:57] and it's gonna be a wonderful time
[9:00] so being many are one body in Christ and
[9:02] everyone everyone members of another
[9:06] can't do it without we gotta help each
[9:08] other having then gifts differing
[9:11] according to the grace that is given to
[9:15] us now we'll talk about that in just a
[9:17] minute
[9:18] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[9:20] according to the proportion of faith
[9:23] because not everybody's not everybody's
[9:26] prophecy gift of prophecy
[9:28] everybody has look gifts differing
[9:30] according to the grace that is given us
[9:32] now brother Brown said that we could you
[9:37] know he called it laying under the water
[9:40] spout long enough you can speak in
[9:41] tongues and others you can force
[9:42] yourself into it but there are some
[9:44] people that can speak in tongues they
[9:46] have the gift of speaking in tongues
[9:48] they don't have to work yourself into
[9:50] the gift but not everybody you got nine
[9:55] you got wisdom you have faith you got
[9:57] this you got that you got the nine
[9:59] spiritual gifts that's nine of them that
[10:01] work in the body and like always said we
[10:04] major on a minor the bottom two is
[10:07] tongues and prophecy are tongues and
[10:10] interpretations that's the bottom answer
[10:12] that's the least of all those what about
[10:14] the other seven okay the other seven
[10:17] gifts
[10:17] let's work down through the other seven
[10:20] gifts and once we work down through the
[10:21] other seven gifts you get down to
[10:24] tongues and interpretation because Satan
[10:28] can interpret a lot of those yes okay
[10:31] one thing he can't interpret though and
[10:34] that's the will of God he cannot
[10:35] interpret that word now he can
[10:37] misinterpret yes but he can't interpret
[10:40] it word for word he makes it come out
[10:42] right he's always gonna make it come out
[10:43] wrong somewhere all right so have
[10:46] anything gets different according to the
[10:48] grace that is given to us whether
[10:50] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[10:52] the proportion of faith our ministry let
[10:55] us wait on our ministry
[10:57] you've heard of a old many of many of us
[11:00] you know you you see these people that
[11:02] come out gung-ho and they come right out
[11:03] of the world we'll even brother Brown
[11:05] says come come out of the barroom on
[11:07] Saturday night and preach on sin any
[11:08] morning
[11:10] that might work one another ten million
[11:13] but uh but a ministry has to develop now
[11:17] you're born with the gift but that gift
[11:21] has to develop because you can use it
[11:23] wrong we see a lot of people using
[11:24] things wrong you know because you have
[11:27] to be careful with money women in
[11:30] popularity now you watch all three of
[11:32] them somewhere a ministry is going to
[11:35] have a problem with one of those three
[11:37] and if you're not solid behind the stay
[11:39] behind the Word of God one of them will
[11:41] get you okay even being a born-again
[11:44] Christian one of them will hurt you yeah
[11:46] I'm telling you it will happen it'll
[11:48] happen mining women in popularity
[11:51] because it says here you own don't be
[11:53] popular because you come up here to the
[11:55] top it says we're not I I always make
[12:02] this statement about you know patting
[12:03] yourself on the back that's okay but I
[12:05] was somewhere the other day and a
[12:07] preacher friend of mine told me that
[12:08] another preacher he sold does that from
[12:10] the pulpit he passes on back Pope in a
[12:14] back seat is using it a little bit cuz I
[12:20] use it as if ain't nobody gonna fetch in
[12:22] the bag you might want pat yourself on
[12:23] the back now I'm talking about you know
[12:25] doing stuff out here I ain't talking
[12:26] about standing in the pulpit oh you know
[12:28] thanks yeah yeah I've heard that before
[12:34] 10 so be careful because you got money
[12:41] women in popularity popularity is one
[12:43] that really hurts you ministry let us
[12:48] wait on our ministering or he that
[12:50] teacheth on teaching so wait let God
[12:54] develop the gift because you can have a
[12:59] gift of prophecy probably picked it be
[13:01] prophecy and be wrong you can promise
[13:05] our wrong Balaam was wrong but he was a
[13:07] prophet he could
[13:08] sigh right we're brother Brown said the
[13:13] guy was that he meant was speaking in
[13:16] tongues and yellow and interpreting one
[13:17] speaking in tongues he discerned to be a
[13:20] Christian the other one of the
[13:21] interpreting we living with another with
[13:23] another woman yeah
[13:25] alright so that's why I did all those
[13:31] non spiritual gifts those two at the
[13:33] bottom of the one that's gonna that
[13:34] everybody loves
[13:35] you know they write the way I said is
[13:38] they write then that spiritual gift they
[13:40] write selling them so little you can't
[13:41] see them didn't in last two of the tones
[13:44] and interpretation they write and grab
[13:45] big fun you know worth tongues and
[13:50] interpretations well that's the two of
[13:52] the least gifts and that's the one that
[13:54] can get you in the most trouble
[13:55] we saw him brother rounds ministry to
[13:57] God you know remember that woman that
[13:58] was going to get up and thinking towns
[14:00] and all that she was getting ready and
[14:01] she well now that's kind of like pat
[14:05] yourself on the back
[14:06] you know that's brother brother brother
[14:07] Ram discerned that spirit and called it
[14:10] out well then then what happened when he
[14:12] got finished with the sermon all those
[14:14] spiritual people that believed in the
[14:17] two likes gifts more than any of the
[14:19] other come up to brother Brown to you
[14:22] you equates to spirit or whatever he's
[14:24] sitting you know what he went apologetic
[14:27] about it right
[14:28] he said that woman was out of line that
[14:30] woman was out of order so you know what
[14:33] gift he was using one day mother seven
[14:35] wisdom faith knowledge and all those
[14:37] with all that up here at the top instead
[14:40] of using them to it to bother me I've
[14:44] seen tones coming interpretations
[14:46] I've seen people speaking tongues with
[14:49] no interpretation but a lot of times
[14:51] brother Brown said you speak in tongues
[14:52] you do it free stuff you know you're
[14:54] speaking to the Lord for yourself I
[14:57] another house I'd rather have somebody
[14:59] would you get the wisdom and with the
[15:02] gift of faith and all those others we
[15:03] may go through those spiritual gifts
[15:05] sometimes don't have that and have all
[15:07] the other okay
[15:13] discerning of spirits II see it if that
[15:16] guy down here that was interpretation
[15:18] appealing even if the guy speaking in
[15:21] tongues then people have congregation
[15:25] thought that guy was up you know so they
[15:29] didn't have that gift of discerning of
[15:31] spirits if they ever have that gift that
[15:33] brother Branham had you say Willie had
[15:35] come to the prophet
[15:36] I don't always happen you know God can
[15:39] tell you a lot of things and you're not
[15:41] being the Prophet but if you use that
[15:43] gift instead of the other ones
[15:45] thanks I've told that gossip hey you
[15:47] need to get your life straight for your
[15:48] stress going all this so I don't believe
[15:53] in gifts I believe all nine but they
[15:54] should all not operate according to the
[15:56] Word of God they should operate
[15:57] according to and you know what I believe
[16:00] they do
[16:01] I believe they dead well deserting your
[16:06] spirit yeah that's the last thing but
[16:30] you got all those others that we don't
[16:33] use we just get brown them down to the
[16:34] bottom too you know
[16:36] mmm but you know that's just the way we
[16:41] are watch the way you've been tall I'm
[16:44] brother Graham said that's the way y'all
[16:45] been talking y'all been talking to just
[16:46] jump up and start speaking in tongues
[16:47] and he said but if you'll do it in over
[16:49] a corner in the Bible one he was a
[16:51] prophet he was Elijah he was restoring
[16:54] the order of the church he said if
[16:56] you'll do it this way it'll work
[16:58] properly and I believe it did from
[17:00] brother Branham was that because you
[17:01] know you had brother Neville brother
[17:05] Neville was not only a minister he had a
[17:06] gift of prophecy or prophecy but you
[17:10] don't hear him
[17:11] when brother Browns preaching you don't
[17:13] hear him stand up and start giving a
[17:15] prophecy
[17:16] you never hear him to end up been given
[17:18] Ralphie why because I believe you had it
[17:20] in order and he had brothers around
[17:22] there too teaching you know that's what
[17:24] he said he said we start teaching these
[17:26] babies and then you'll come to a place
[17:28] and he even told the Brown Tabernacle
[17:30] y'all stand up speaking tongues you
[17:31] hearing preaching now thanks a lot time
[17:33] Tina pay attention to some times now at
[17:36] the very end of a service and being a
[17:39] prophet you watch on those tapes he
[17:41] pauses just for a few seconds then you
[17:44] hear he sees that thing fall he sees
[17:46] that light of that spirit come down
[17:48] following that person because you said
[17:50] let's just wait a thing or let's just
[17:52] wait a minute you'll pop but him up
[17:54] preaching you hear some sister jump up
[17:55] he never even acknowledges that they're
[17:58] speaking they don't why they're out of
[17:59] order in other words they're out of
[18:01] order so in other words you got to move
[18:03] that out of the way and they keep on
[18:06] doing what you do in ministry or he that
[18:09] exhorteth on exhortation let's see what
[18:12] that word means that means to call them
[18:19] near and vote to call them one side call
[18:21] for to address or to speak to all right
[18:28] so let him that exhorteth only
[18:30] exhortation in other words speak to a
[18:33] person and give them them you know give
[18:35] a little boost you know that's the way
[18:39] we do in ministry you know you said with
[18:41] your bride this is what you're your
[18:43] bride and god this is what God s
[18:45] exhortation you're telling the person
[18:47] your bride if you're right
[18:49] what are they doing they going back to
[18:51] the will and telling you what you got
[18:52] okay cuz I'm telling you to be the bride
[18:57] of Jesus Christ is the greatest thing on
[19:01] the face of the earth there's nothing I
[19:03] said on the earth there's no greater
[19:04] than being the bride of Jesus Christ but
[19:09] now that we're telling you what God said
[19:10] I'm not telling you that you're the
[19:12] greatest cuz I said you're the greatest
[19:14] I'm just reading the well the Holy Ghost
[19:16] is telling you the executor of the whale
[19:19] is telling you what the world says about
[19:21] what about you because you
[19:22] under this number I love being the bride
[19:25] right so we do exhort well he did give
[19:30] it let him do it with simplicity he that
[19:33] ruleth with diligence he that show us
[19:37] mercy with cheerfulness and see how you
[19:40] can and you know what as I read that
[19:43] several individuals come to my mind so
[19:48] see they've used that gift in my life to
[19:52] help me so you should read the same
[19:54] thing and look back to your life and see
[19:56] and and pull a name out I think a robber
[20:00] title now some of you didn't know
[20:03] brother tell him I did in my younger
[20:04] life all the way up but right there he
[20:07] that showeth mercy with children it he
[20:09] did it was simply a Geordie with
[20:11] simplicity he was a simple man and he
[20:15] that you know what though that part of
[20:18] him was right here so you got to see
[20:21] that part of you for whatever it is
[20:23] maybe not that one okay I have to learn
[20:26] to be an exhortation that's because it's
[20:28] not up I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the one
[20:31] to cut you know and see this is that
[20:50] this is a sticky one here rule it would
[20:53] diligent I snag one time I said how do
[20:57] you put up with some of them people in
[20:58] that church and it's been 20 years ago
[21:00] not now cuz I seen that wife was over
[21:02] but back then I did he said give them
[21:07] time most patient mail and faces the art
[21:10] that man got facing law well what that
[21:13] diligence is patience yeah the only
[21:17] justice pay you just either standing
[21:18] right and you let the people do what

[22:47] brother kindness is right there at the
[22:49] headstone right in honour preferring one
[22:53] another brother man I'm always
[22:56] television and many men you've met that
[22:58] have been real successful in business
[23:00] and stuff now there are the arrogant
[23:03] ones but you see the ones that are there
[23:06] they're just good people they actually
[23:09] ask you how you're doing ask you how
[23:11] your family is ask you how you're
[23:12] terrible things going with you instead I
[23:14] mean me I did this I did that in case
[23:17] I'm weighing and
[23:19] it's it's beautiful to listen like daddy
[23:25] always says it's beautiful to listen to
[23:26] your texture month you know listening
[23:28] what God has done for you not slothful
[23:31] in business and that's in any business
[23:32] that's building Christian business
[23:35] fervent in spirit serving the Lord
[23:39] rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation
[23:44] in other words that patient when
[23:47] everything's going haywire persevering I
[23:52] read you the scripture the other day
[23:54] that in Matthew where brother Claude
[23:59] really enjoys that night I'm beginning
[24:01] to like it myself those who endure to
[24:03] the end shall be saved those who endure
[24:06] to the end shall be saved because
[24:07] there's a lot of people in this way
[24:08] that's going to fall off there's a lot
[24:10] of people but if you endure to the end I
[24:14] want to use a Dave Ramsey quote because
[24:16] they Randy says you're getting rid of
[24:18] your dead it's not a microwave it's a
[24:21] crock-pot so the same thing in
[24:23] Christianity Christianity is not a
[24:24] microwave you see these people that come
[24:26] in like a microwave they go out like one
[24:29] right but they come in like a crop block
[24:33] you know what a crock pot does for those
[24:34] who don't know what a crock one does
[24:36] me man slow cooker you put it on in
[24:41] your way all day but boy at the end is
[24:44] the best roast and potatoes mama fix
[24:47] them Jim roasted lot of character like
[24:53] heirs but that's what it is in
[24:55] Christianity it's not a it's not a
[24:57] microwave it's a crock pot mentality you
[24:59] gotta endure to me and you got to step
[25:01] there and you know why you may be hungry
[25:03] but it may take 12 hours for that to
[25:06] cook the boy at the end
[25:09] it's good stuff rejoice in Hope patient
[25:12] in tribulation continuing instant in
[25:15] prayer that's from you interpreted that
[25:17] pray without ceasing all right and and
[25:21] and you know what you do that
[25:24] unconsciously as a Christian you do that
[25:28] unconsciously you don't say no we do
[25:30] have our prayer time now I don't have
[25:33] I'm just gonna be honest I don't have a
[25:35] prayer time where I go in and I pray for
[25:36] 30 minutes no I pray for a little while
[25:39] then I'll sit down on my tablet and I'll
[25:40] read I've been went back to Ezekiel now
[25:43] I'm going back to Jeff to me that's my
[25:44] prayer time but then you know what just
[25:46] like that right there that I saw I can
[25:49] see people in the Bible not not Caroline
[25:51] and these on y'all and us people that
[25:54] have influenced me and done bad things
[25:56] are good things you can read the Bible
[25:58] same minutes that's just like songsong
[26:00] see to me that puts the Bible real for
[26:02] me still like data you know like daddy's
[26:05] been saying you know it's not - it's not
[26:07] that letter that Bible that you're
[26:10] looking at is the written official known
[26:14] and read of all men so if somebody's
[26:15] like that somebody in your life you've
[26:17] read their life and like I said it's not
[26:21] a sum of it's a short story and some of
[26:24] us were warned peace version you know
[26:25] it's a little short some of it takes a
[26:27] long time but still continuing instant
[26:32] in prayer cleaving drama down the road I
[26:36] hate this is my one of my pet peeve I
[26:39] hate to see people broke down on side of
[26:41] the road that may not bother you one bit
[26:42] but I just can't
[26:44] inside me something works and I don't
[26:51] stop all the time I don't stop probably
[26:54] maybe one out of 500 but when I pass on
[26:57] the Lord just send somebody clap
[27:00] couldn't help they ain't got jumper
[27:02] cable I couldn't I don't know what a key
[27:04] is and I don't where to stick it in the
[27:06] car that's about it thank God for
[27:07] mechanics you know right man all right

[27:15] lord send them a wrecker or send them
[27:17] somebody that knows
[27:18] we don't ride but everybody I don't
[27:20] think I've ever missed anybody might
[27:21] have but even going down a road and I'd
[27:23] be sitting there driving and talking
[27:24] y'all are thinking about something else
[27:26] so that distract you everybody see that
[27:40] if I didn't want to tell you almost
[27:42] matching know why not my my most massive
[27:46] spider that's what mama saying oh you

[28:05] a million fleas in your house wrong
[28:08] voices wrong okay he takes it outside
[28:29] let's get back to what we're doing here
[28:32] continuing instantly in prayer so that's
[28:35] what I mean about a few driving down a
[28:36] road even if somebody comes do you mind
[28:38] what do you do you should Lord bless
[28:40] that person Lord be with that person if
[28:42] someone comes to you about what is
[28:43] continuing in prayer because I'll
[28:45] promise you the truck driver this own
[28:49] camel 19 on the CB is it 9 19 whatever
[28:54] they made their cuts they're talking
[28:55] about their girlfriends about what
[28:56] they're gonna do to their you know
[28:58] you're still I'm say they ain't
[28:59] continually in prayer but you as a
[29:02] Christian you're aware of your
[29:03] surroundings and you're continually in
[29:06] prayer
[29:06] some of you were praying I didn't kill
[29:09] that spot early
[29:10] work flies my daddy kills millions of
[29:20] flies and he wastes all of them were
[29:21] dead so a little firing that hurt me but
[29:25] he's dead oh well I'm not worried about
[29:32] that either rejoicing in Hope patient in
[29:36] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[29:41] well let me give you a point on that
[29:44] brother Brown the angel said everything
[29:47] you love they'll be there I don't love
[29:49] my daddy don't love what so they may be
[29:55] there for somebody else you may see them
[29:57] in look like somebody looks like PPM
[29:58] with the Flies going around you know
[30:00] going around the head but not my brother
[30:01] Dale walks up giggles he flies know
[30:03] where the last knot his desire he didn't
[30:07] lot of them cuz brother brown horse was
[30:10] there because he loved their brother
[30:11] grounds dog was there now that's fine
[30:12] that's fine but now all this other
[30:15] nonsense is just nonsense
[30:19] everybody up killed not gonna be there
[30:21] that's just nonsense that's not having a
[30:25] lot of wisdom dish distributing to the
[30:29] necessity of saints
[30:31] now that's us that's us in our fight
[30:35] that's us in our environment that loves
[30:39] y'all okay wait you know what that's
[30:41] okay patient in distributing to the
[30:56] necessity of saints given the
[30:59] hospitality and now Jim loves to be
[31:02] hospitable a love but we're not gonna be
[31:04] hospitable
[31:09] bless their with persecute you unless
[31:14] debate yeah that's what you mean all the
[31:18] time the others came out with one or
[31:20] sixty thousand of them in a box you just
[31:21] can't help watching the baby but I don't
[31:24] think that bees don't buzz up me at the
[31:25] future home and don't you tell me why no
[31:30] everything will be in harmony over there
[31:32] don't worry I'm not gonna worry about
[31:33] you just worry about getting yeah you
[31:41] know what go create your own world and
[31:42] go live with all the bugs but I'm not I
[31:47] mean short visit but not real and if you
[31:51] got flies there brother down never see
[31:53] you again
[31:53] and they're gonna be the same I mean
[31:57] I've never if you ever seen Bella don't
[31:58] change the fly it's like I mean he's on
[32:01] a mission
[32:01] yeah mama knows and he's only he's got
[32:03] to I'm telling this someone finally he's
[32:07] got to and he's going hurt
[32:11] train you feel that and we'll talk to
[32:20] Moses about cream well I think the flies
[32:33] were already there even just a little
[32:34] meal at Moses for making Selenia yeah
[32:47] creative block for a creative life which
[32:51] I am it so everything's gonna set it
[32:53] something assess to do that we have you
[32:55] know you've done you've got germs on you
[32:58] they're good jerks that you need you
[33:02] read about that sometime never grossed
[33:04] you out how many boats you got already
[33:05] on you yeah they need your Flash you
[33:09] need to this when he takes care of that
[33:10] and now ya think but that's not being in
[33:13] harmony with nature
[33:15] alright listen but let's talk about
[33:17] humans because listen we have a soul God
[33:21] created us to worship Him now in us
[33:24] being listened and us being the worship
[33:27] part we are all the creation behind us
[33:31] worship the god thing so we are
[33:33] connected to them to nature to the
[33:35] creation but as because we fell they
[33:37] fell so you see the dead animals and
[33:40] stuff laying on side of the road and all
[33:42] that stuff and you know what I I hate
[33:44] that I don't I don't like yeah I had a
[33:47] friend of mine one time he'd run off the
[33:49] road hit squirrel that's just being mad
[33:52] I've just been made her about I know I
[33:54] tried my best to swerve and miss him now
[33:58] I'm not gonna run off the road and kill
[33:59] myself and who's riding with me but I'm
[34:02] gonna try to avoid it at all cost so
[34:04] that's the difference my brother Graham
[34:05] said he goes nut and he killed thousands
[34:07] of animals but he couldn't stand him
[34:09] guys who just want to print slaughter
[34:11] okay so there's a difference you know
[34:13] what it is the only difference is it's
[34:15] the psyche or that mentality of that
[34:17] person what's in that person okay
[34:20] bless them are giving the hospitality
[34:24] and we should we should be the most
[34:26] hospitable people on the face of this
[34:29] earth we should be the most
[34:30] accommodating people on the face of the
[34:33] earth all right
[34:33] bless them which persecute you do you
[34:39] bless them Lord for running out in front
[34:41] of me and cutting me off
[34:42] no that's usually not won't be there
[34:45] because what would Jesus say said it's
[34:48] really easy in other words it's easy to
[34:51] bless somebody that blesses you
[34:52] he said it's real hard to bless the
[34:54] people that curse you yes
[34:56] and to me that's what brotherly kindness
[34:58] is because you could if you couldn't
[35:01] tell who brother Browns friends or foe
[35:03] were he was blessing the ones that
[35:06] persecuted him and him being a prophet
[35:08] knew they persecute knew they didn't
[35:10] like him right through the discernment
[35:12] he knew spiritually they didn't like him
[35:14] but he did not let that bother him now
[35:18] humanely I bet it did cuz remember he
[35:20] says I'm a neurotic and I have to go get
[35:22] along well you know why he had a complex
[35:25] but he overcame those things because he
[35:28] had a job one job today we all need to
[35:29] find out our job what our job is unless
[35:32] all good yes
[35:33] bless them which persecute you bless and
[35:36] curse not rejoice with them that do
[35:39] rejoice and weep with them that weep in
[35:42] other words brotherly kindness being
[35:44] together be of the same mind one toward
[35:48] another minds not high things see what
[35:54] that means do not set your mind on high
[35:57] things but condescend to men of low
[36:01] estate that's what it's talking about
[36:02] somebody's that's a really successful
[36:05] person they have a young if they're
[36:09] really a Christian and a successful
[36:11] person they when they walk into a room
[36:14] it's not like I'm 6 feet taller than
[36:16] everybody else you know I'm gonna
[36:17] postpone my walk around no be not wise
[36:20] in your own conceits in your own
[36:25] estimation ok don't think yourself
[36:30] better and you know what it's hard today
[36:34] let's be honest it's hard to do that
[36:37] it's hard to see somebody that's doing
[36:39] wrong or doing you wrong and knowing
[36:41] that they're not born again and you're
[36:42] standing here a child to God morning in
[36:44] heavy turtle life in your soul you're a
[36:48] liar look at me in the face
[36:50] you're a liar if you sometimes don't
[36:53] think that personal just not as good as
[36:58] me
[36:59] hello it just seemed a little a little
[37:02] small even even if it happens in your
[37:05] humanity just for a second because I do
[37:08] the same thing but you know what you do
[37:09] you cast down that imagination and you
[37:12] say God if they had to bend for you
[37:16] saving me that's the only difference
[37:18] between me and prosecutors I'm saying
[37:20] that she's not that's the only
[37:22] difference
[37:22] not that I'm up here and she's down here
[37:24] no recompense no man evil for evil now
[37:29] you see how the Bible says now look in
[37:31] the Old Testament it was eye for an eye
[37:33] tooth for tooth arm for an arm life for
[37:37] a life comes remember for man kills you
[37:41] brother you don't kill you kill him
[37:42] that's why they made defense cities
[37:44] where those people could run into the
[37:45] city and not be killed until they were
[37:47] tried but if you were called outside the
[37:49] city you can kill them and be justified
[37:51] under the law but the law says thou
[37:54] shall not kill but the law says you can
[37:58] kill that person if he kills your
[38:00] brother all right so you see you have to
[38:03] you come up here and yo do not wreck the
[38:05] pants recompense evil for evil now how
[38:08] many times have we said not now but in
[38:11] our in our old life that I'm going to
[38:13] get back at that person for whatever you
[38:16] want to say all right anything family
[38:18] member friend whatever you know they
[38:20] they wrong even they so I'll get back at
[38:22] that person cuz that's whole world
[38:23] that's what this world mate is both of
[38:25] I'm gonna get back at that person
[38:27] because you did this to me I'm gonna do
[38:28] this to you
[38:29] you don't do that when you're Christian
[38:31] you try that's why you don't take your
[38:34] brother to court you don't take your
[38:35] brother to Allah he's your brother
[38:37] you're supposed to work those things
[38:38] actually if you have a partner business
[38:42] partner or anything
[38:43] it's church member it needs to be
[38:46] settled in a church
[38:48] that's what we got all the way from that
[38:49] now they said no I'll just hire a lawyer
[38:51] to them you know so you pants off no no
[38:55] you need to handle that right hand
[38:56] I read that long you know several months
[38:58] ago when we were in the statute person
[39:00] then we talked about taking the brother
[39:02] the car the Bible says don't take a
[39:04] brother the court take him before the
[39:05] elders of the church and judge the
[39:08] situation because the Bible says Paul
[39:11] says how can you not judge this if
[39:14] you're going to judge angels in judge
[39:16] the whole world if you can't judge among
[39:18] yourself right so that's why we but the
[39:22] easiest way to see the easiest way to go
[39:24] I'll hire a lawyer let him handle it
[39:26] because it's kind of not face to face
[39:28] you come in here it's the pastor in a
[39:31] couple of Deacons and the two guys or
[39:33] two girls whatever and you're face to
[39:35] face but now we're not supposed to do
[39:39] that let me read this and we'll go
[39:41] provide things honest in the sight of
[39:43] all men if it be possible
[39:46] look at Paul he's not making this the
[39:49] cutting Drive thing if it be possible as
[39:52] much as lieth in you live peaceably with
[39:55] all men we can't always do that because
[39:58] they won't let you all right
[40:01] they won't which is not to you that but
[40:02] as long as you say it for them then
[40:04] that's their problem not your projects
[40:06] go ahead
[40:06] all right let me get on here
[40:13] kind of a life lesson today thank you
[40:16] group all
