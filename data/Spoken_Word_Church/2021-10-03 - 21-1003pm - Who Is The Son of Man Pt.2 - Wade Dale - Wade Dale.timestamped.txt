[18:56] okay
[18:57] also
[18:59] the bethel camp will be the 28th through

[19:13] much together who's taking who and
[19:15] what's taking what see anna and richard
[19:17] about that
[19:18] and also remember for a future event on
[19:22] 11 14 that's 11 14 not this coming not
[19:27] 10 14. we'll be having our church
[19:29] thanksgiving dinner we're in service and
[19:31] a meal we'll get that all together as we
[19:34] get closer to the time and also we will
[19:36] not have church on wednesday before the
[19:38] day before thanksgiving it will be on
[19:40] tuesday
[19:41] so just keep that in your prayers let's
[19:42] go and
[19:43] to the bible there's john 1
[19:47] this morning is
[19:49] we set up
[19:50] kind of set a little stage and talked
[19:52] more of the son of god but
[19:55] we want to continue on that because the
[19:58] son of man kind of shows itself
[20:01] in forms in the old testament and we'll
[20:04] talk about a little bit in melchizedek
[20:08] it will be in the captain of the host
[20:10] and the different uh ways he appears
[20:13] but that was not the son of man
[20:15] because the son of man is a virgin
[20:18] born god
[20:21] that comes to the earth for the purpose
[20:23] of redemption
[20:24] okay melchizedek didn't redeem abraham
[20:27] he brought him a message and he
[20:29] prefigured or showed that he would come
[20:31] in human flesh in the end time all right
[20:34] because the son of man came 2000 years
[20:37] ago but he's also promised to come now
[20:39] so this is the time of the son of man
[20:42] amen this is the time that the son of
[20:43] man is to be revealed according to the
[20:45] bible not in any other age
[20:49] ever in any other age he was the son of
[20:52] god he built his church on that as we
[20:54] were talking about this morning he built
[20:55] his church on
[20:56] the revelation of the son of god the
[20:58] baptism of the holy ghost and the souls
[21:00] of the believers all right so john 1
[21:04] 1 let's bow our heads
[21:06] remember all the ones that are sick the
[21:07] ones that are for the howl and the
[21:09] different ones lord brother
[21:11] uh dean
[21:12] let's remember those lord that are
[21:13] getting older
[21:15] and
[21:16] age doesn't mean anything to god i
[21:18] when we always my mind goes to that well
[21:21] they're just old
[21:23] well they're just oh well you know what
[21:25] brother bill dowell was 92 years old and
[21:28] brother brown he because he was healed
[21:31] of whatever it was he had and he's
[21:33] brother brown said i'll shake your hand
[21:34] again
[21:35] amen so at 92 years old god still
[21:38] delivers amen
[21:40] so let's bow our heads do you heavenly
[21:42] father lord
[21:44] this day has been set aside lord to
[21:45] worship you now father i pray that you
[21:47] would come among us in a special way may
[21:49] the worship be
[21:50] about you and for you lord not not just
[21:53] a mere mortal man but father you were
[21:56] god in human flesh and now you are
[21:58] showing yourself now as god in human
[22:00] flesh and abrid now pray lord that we
[22:03] would get a revelation of that that our
[22:06] eyes will be
[22:07] opened and that we will be enlightened
[22:10] to this revelation that you wanted to
[22:13] live with us in human flesh from the
[22:15] beginning of time and now you're able to
[22:17] do that
[22:18] through the redemptive plan lord that
[22:20] we've been talking about for months
[22:22] lord the right of redemption
[22:24] you came and became human flesh to buy
[22:27] us back
[22:28] father thank you for that lord thank you
[22:30] for the healing of the body thank you
[22:31] for the healing of our mind lord we pray
[22:33] that you just touch each one lord it's
[22:35] not here and the ones that are here in
[22:37] the building father we pray that you
[22:38] will just sanctify us for this journey
[22:40] that we're on give us a good day in you
[22:42] father in jesus name we pray
[22:44] amen john 1 verse 1 says in the
[22:46] beginning was the word
[22:48] and the word was with god
[22:49] and the word was god
[22:52] the same was in the beginning with god
[22:55] all things were made by him so there's
[22:57] that logos the creator of the word that
[23:00] we were talking about this morning there
[23:01] he is right there
[23:03] he stood wherever he stood he was
[23:05] standing on faith it doesn't matter if
[23:07] there was nothing created he was
[23:09] standing somewhere because he's a man
[23:11] all right he wasn't just floating around
[23:13] like like a fog or a cloud no he was a
[23:15] man he was standing in one place his
[23:17] intelligence was saying let there be
[23:19] his intelligence his mind have the mind
[23:22] of christ is what the the bible tells us
[23:25] he was a creator he was standing and he
[23:27] was looking at his plan and he was
[23:29] creating
[23:30] by the spoken word of god amen and
[23:32] that's what i believe that he's standing
[23:34] in the end time trying to do the same
[23:35] thing amen
[23:37] in him was life
[23:40] no all things were made by him and
[23:41] without him was not anything made that
[23:43] was made so there's nothing new under
[23:45] the sun everything was made there in
[23:46] genesis
[23:48] the sea chapter of the bible in him was
[23:50] life
[23:51] and the life was the light of men so
[23:53] there's no other life besides jesus
[23:55] christ and the light shineth in darkness
[23:57] and the darkness comprehended
[23:58] comprehending it not
[24:00] there was a man sent from god whose name
[24:02] was john that's john the baptist the
[24:04] same came for a witness to bear witness
[24:05] of the light that all men through him
[24:07] might believe
[24:09] he was not that light john wasn't but he
[24:11] was sent to bear witness of that light
[24:14] that was the true light which lighteth
[24:15] every man that cometh into the world he
[24:18] was in the world and the world was made
[24:19] by him in the world
[24:21] knew him not
[24:22] remember the bible says in the day that
[24:25] the son of man is to be revealed that
[24:27] was not two thousand years ago
[24:31] no one knew who he was
[24:34] in his fullness no one
[24:37] even on the day of pentecost
[24:40] the baptism of the holy ghost came the
[24:41] son of god revelation which was the holy
[24:43] ghost the comforter came and went into
[24:46] the believers and they still
[24:50] didn't have a complete revelation
[24:51] because the headstone hadn't come yet
[24:52] the headstone had been taken away the
[24:54] headstone left when he ascended up but
[24:56] now he said he was going to come back
[24:57] the way he ascended right he's going to
[25:00] come back the way he ascended in a cloud
[25:02] that's why they hate that cloud so much
[25:04] because they don't want god to be back
[25:05] here the way they want him back here
[25:08] right they want to do away with that
[25:09] cloud thing they don't want having to do
[25:10] with that well the bible says he'll come
[25:12] back in the cloud because he took off in
[25:13] the cloud all right he came unto his own
[25:16] and his own received him not
[25:18] but as many as received him to them gave
[25:20] he power to become the sons of god even
[25:24] to them that believe on his name
[25:26] because see you have to start you have
[25:27] to start son of god you can't start son
[25:29] of man you can't
[25:31] you have to be born again sons and
[25:33] daughters of god and then you grow into
[25:35] adoption you grow into the headstone
[25:37] which is the son of man
[25:39] which were born not of blood nor of the
[25:41] will of the flesh nicodemus
[25:44] okay you must be born again nicodemus
[25:46] said oh got to go get back in the flesh
[25:47] or blood and all of my mama and get no
[25:50] nor of the will of man in other words
[25:52] there had to be a conception here on
[25:53] earth nicodemus was saying no jesus said
[25:55] no no no no
[25:57] the word was then made flesh and dwelt
[25:59] among us and we beheld his glory the
[26:01] glory of the only begotten of the father
[26:03] full of grace and truth you'll be seated
[26:06] and the lord has blessing for the
[26:07] reading of the word we'll just kind of
[26:09] go through a little bit this morning
[26:12] on the let's go to genesis 3 15
[26:15] because before this
[26:17] before the fall
[26:20] god would walk in the cool of the day
[26:23] with adam and talked to him
[26:25] face to face
[26:28] and eve there with them and they had no
[26:30] problems there was no enmity there was
[26:32] no division god was happy to walk down
[26:36] there in the cool of the day and talk to
[26:38] his creation
[26:39] there was no there was no fear
[26:42] there was no condemnation
[26:46] that sounds familiar there's therefore
[26:47] now no kind see what we're heading back
[26:49] to it was what that was before we're
[26:52] heading back to that there is therefore
[26:54] now no condemnation well there was no
[26:55] condemnation when adam and eve before
[26:57] the fall walked in the garden of eden
[26:59] talked to god
[27:00] face to face
[27:03] and he brother brown said he'd say hey
[27:05] how y'all been doing today
[27:06] how's my children
[27:08] then what would he do he said he would
[27:09] lay them down on some
[27:11] on some pine needles or something and he
[27:13] would put him to sleep
[27:15] he said okay enjoy your rest i'll be
[27:16] back in the morning
[27:19] man
[27:21] that's bliss
[27:24] but that's what we're getting back to
[27:26] we'll be able to talk face to face with
[27:28] him
[27:29] and not have any fear amen all right so
[27:32] now genesis 3 15 though is where
[27:34] adam right before this says i was afraid
[27:38] because something had happened that he
[27:41] knew there was a problem he knew that he
[27:43] wasn't supposed to be that
[27:45] uh get caught in that situation but he
[27:47] did by eve telling him and him partaking
[27:50] of what she
[27:52] gave him so god is here saying okay i'm
[27:54] going to put enmity between thee and the
[27:56] woman see right here is the promise that
[27:58] he's going to bring it all back but also
[28:00] in this promise is is that i'm going to
[28:02] have to drive you out
[28:04] because here's the place that you're
[28:06] supposed to be at and you have fell from
[28:09] that and you can't get back to that by
[28:11] yourself
[28:12] see that was adam's problem adam was a
[28:14] shrunk of god
[28:16] adam had complete control of the earth
[28:18] but he wasn't the savior
[28:21] he had no saving quality that was not
[28:24] one of his attributes
[28:27] that's why he thought that he could take
[28:30] eve
[28:31] and
[28:32] cover her
[28:33] and then they could just go right back
[28:35] but see he couldn't save her
[28:37] he went out himself the prophet said he
[28:39] stepped they had to get out of the
[28:40] garden and man he had to go with eve
[28:43] because his attribute was not savior or
[28:45] healer or any of those attributes that
[28:47] was for god alone
[28:49] that was for
[28:51] jehovah or elohim or whoever you want to
[28:53] call whatever his name was then we know
[28:55] his name was jesus christ but he had
[28:57] attributes the different attributes
[28:59] there was father
[29:00] and he couldn't be
[29:02] and there is no way that adam
[29:05] you see uh there are several quotes
[29:07] where brother brown says uh there
[29:09] there's uh certain doctrines in the
[29:10] message that said adam
[29:12] adam's natural seed is what saved eve
[29:14] but i i can't see that that's what
[29:17] killed her
[29:20] adam's natural seed killed her if adam
[29:21] would have just said hey
[29:23] i don't want that anymore give me
[29:25] another one god and i'll start speaking
[29:27] the word and she'll start having these
[29:29] children
[29:30] spoken word
[29:32] but not but remember being that she was
[29:34] so much a part of him she couldn't do
[29:36] that he couldn't do that
[29:39] because she was him
[29:41] same way with jesus christ
[29:44] he couldn't not go to calvary
[29:47] he could not save us
[29:49] because we were part of him before the
[29:51] foundation world when he spoke and said
[29:54] that's why genesis 1 26 you just keep
[29:56] pulling the onion peel back when he's
[29:58] when he spoke that he had to die
[30:02] when he spoke that genesis 1 26 man and
[30:05] said that you know that's an eternal
[30:07] person but i'm going to have to die to
[30:09] get them back
[30:11] he proclaimed death on himself
[30:15] but he was happy but
[30:17] he was happy to do that
[30:19] he knew that listen to genesis 1 26 man
[30:22] didn't fall
[30:24] but humanity fell
[30:27] even with the genesis 1 26 man inside of
[30:30] you you're still in a fallen condition
[30:32] we've not been fully restored back
[30:34] that's why the son of man came because
[30:36] he was fully restored
[30:38] when he walked out of that grave he was
[30:40] fully restored
[30:42] the the end of his redemption
[30:45] was his body becoming
[30:47] glorified
[30:49] we talked about that in the plan of
[30:50] redemption or the eternal plan of
[30:52] redemption that's what that's all that's
[30:53] the part that he was that wasn't eternal
[30:56] he had to go through the process of
[30:58] death
[31:00] to receive eternal redemption and then
[31:02] turn around and give it to me and you
[31:05] so i'll put enmity between thee and the
[31:07] woman
[31:09] the serpent and the woman and between
[31:10] thy seed and her seed see separating
[31:14] and thou shalt bruise i mean you shall
[31:16] bruise his head and thou shalt bruise
[31:17] his heels saying telling us that i'm
[31:20] going to have to separate i'm going to
[31:21] have to drive you out of the garden of
[31:22] eden but i'm not going to forget you i
[31:25] am i already have the plan in place
[31:28] remember god didn't have to develop a
[31:30] plan
[31:31] he already had the plan in place because
[31:33] if he didn't have the plan in place
[31:34] number one he wasn't god
[31:36] because he didn't know all things and
[31:38] number two adam he'd had to kill adam as
[31:41] soon as they did what they did
[31:43] because adam was adam was the problem
[31:46] remember
[31:47] he wasn't deceived she was and the bible
[31:50] doesn't say and evil die it says and
[31:52] adam all die
[31:54] amen so what he did killed us
[31:58] in flesh but it didn't kill that genesis
[32:01] 1 26 man but as soon as god spoke that
[32:03] genesis 1 26 man
[32:05] and said let us make man our own image
[32:07] and when the fall happened he knew he's
[32:09] going to have to die to redeem that
[32:10] because listen god didn't doesn't
[32:13] god can't redem i can't say can't god's
[32:15] not going to redeem anything outside of
[32:18] genesis 1 26 man
[32:21] except at the white throne judgment you
[32:23] understand what i mean that's not
[32:24] children that genesis 1 26 man is not
[32:28] abraham
[32:30] it's not isaac jacob joseph john the
[32:33] baptist is not included in that genesis
[32:35] 1 26 man
[32:37] that is only god's children who have his
[32:40] own life by a redemptive act of the
[32:43] baptism of the holy ghost that takes
[32:45] your own nature and kills your own
[32:47] nature does away with your first birth
[32:50] and gives you a new birth that's why
[32:52] it's calling you
[32:55] amen
[32:56] what a plan
[32:58] but that genesis 1 26 man that's the
[33:00] only ones considering redemption
[33:04] even though it's connected to you you're
[33:06] still in a fallen condition but that
[33:08] soul inside of you is just as eternal as
[33:10] when he spoke in genesis 1 26
[33:14] that's what we got to realize
[33:16] it's already inside of us
[33:18] it's not coming
[33:20] it's here
[33:23] the coming of the son of man the coming
[33:24] of the son of man is here it's god in
[33:26] human flesh
[33:27] aren't you sitting here today god in
[33:29] human flesh
[33:34] i believe it too brother
[33:38] but what are we doing about it
[33:42] if jesus had to grow in grace and
[33:44] knowledge so do we
[33:46] amen and we'll read that later on but
[33:47] not today all right because we're not
[33:49] going to get too far deuteronomy 18
[33:51] verse 15 says the lord thy god shall
[33:53] raise up unto thee a prophet we're going
[33:55] to talk about moses in a minute
[33:58] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[34:00] a prophet look at that capital p that's
[34:02] not going to be any profit
[34:04] that's not a major prophet or a minor
[34:06] prophet that is the prophet
[34:09] that's christ
[34:10] that's the prophet but now what look but
[34:13] then he connects it
[34:15] and he says the lord thy god will raise
[34:16] up unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[34:18] thee if he stopped right there he could
[34:20] have come a spirit
[34:24] because he would have been he could have
[34:25] been he could have been different than
[34:26] moses but remember god only works by his
[34:29] word
[34:31] he continued on
[34:33] instead of thy brethren
[34:35] boom brought it down here to earth
[34:38] like unto me boom definitely moses is a
[34:42] human being
[34:44] jochebed and whoever the two was
[34:46] definitely had moses so he was an
[34:48] immaculate conception
[34:50] right he was a human mortal man that was
[34:52] actually a murderer at one time
[34:54] amen
[34:57] so he brought it to this
[34:59] and then he's condescending of thy
[35:01] brethren like unto me unto him you shall
[35:05] hearken
[35:07] all right so that's the promise of what
[35:09] promise of the coming of the son of man
[35:11] the promise of god being in human flesh
[35:14] coming to the earth fulfilling the rite
[35:16] of redemption we'll get to that in just
[35:18] a little bit because boaz had to be a
[35:20] near kinsman he had to be human flesh he
[35:23] had to even be born of a woman and and
[35:26] listen he had to be born connected to
[35:29] the line
[35:31] of naomi
[35:33] naturally he had to be connected to that
[35:36] line or he couldn't do the act of
[35:37] redemption so god there's no way he
[35:39] could stay up in heaven and continue to
[35:41] be the father
[35:43] and continue to be spirit
[35:45] and be my redeemer
[35:48] he had to come down in my line
[35:54] he had come down in my line
[35:56] because that's where i fell
[35:59] i fell in my line
[36:01] this guy
[36:03] you fell in your line
[36:04] amen everybody okay with that
[36:07] that's where we fell from
[36:10] but unto him
[36:11] you shall hearken so there's the promise
[36:13] that god's going to have to come down
[36:15] like i said when he spoke to genesis 1
[36:17] 26 it just was a snowball it come into
[36:20] deuteronomy now you're going to have to
[36:21] god's going to have to come down here
[36:22] god's going to have to be ken folks to
[36:24] us god's going to have to be
[36:26] actually in my line
[36:28] a human being
[36:30] not a not a cow or a horse or anything
[36:32] like or even an angel
[36:35] no he had to be he had to become a human
[36:37] being
[36:39] ever went human being
[36:41] there was not a part of him that wasn't
[36:42] a human being except for saul
[36:46] he grew
[36:48] he ate
[36:51] okay
[36:52] same way with me and you that's why
[36:53] melchizedek could prefigure that we'll
[36:55] see it in a minute but melchizedek
[36:58] couldn't save you
[37:00] even though the savior was in
[37:01] melchizedek
[37:02] amen there's the paradox the savior was
[37:05] in melchizedek it
[37:07] he didn't change
[37:09] he still had that attribute but he was
[37:11] showing that he could appear in human
[37:13] flesh
[37:14] and speak to ada i mean to abraham and
[37:18] give him a promise
[37:20] and we'll see that in just a few minutes
[37:21] because remember there was two others
[37:23] that went to sodom why didn't god go why
[37:25] didn't abraham go they didn't go
[37:29] they stayed
[37:32] god didn't go to sodom
[37:34] i'll read it to you in a minute the
[37:36] bible said god went on his way
[37:39] he went my way
[37:41] hey man he came my way
[37:43] amen amen
[37:46] we'll read that in a minute matthew 16
[37:47] verse 13 says when jesus came to the
[37:49] coast of caesarea philippi we talked
[37:50] about it this morning whom do ma men say
[37:53] i the son of man all right what do you
[37:55] think about this
[37:57] that's what he's saying what do you
[37:58] think about this what is what are people
[37:59] saying about me
[38:02] what are people saying about me well
[38:04] somebody says well you're john the
[38:06] baptist resurrected
[38:08] all right
[38:10] some say you're elijah
[38:11] because elijah's got to come compared to
[38:13] the messiah
[38:15] and jeremiah or one of the prophets he
[38:16] said but whom say ye that i am and simon
[38:19] peter said thou art to christ
[38:21] the son of the living god
[38:24] jesus answered and said in him blessed
[38:25] art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and
[38:27] blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[38:29] but my father which is in heaven and i
[38:32] say also unto thee that thou art peter
[38:34] and upon this rock i will build my
[38:36] church so he's going to build his church
[38:37] on the revelation of the son of god we
[38:39] talked about that this morning we've
[38:40] been talking about it
[38:42] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[38:43] against it and i will give unto thee the
[38:45] keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever
[38:47] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[38:48] in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on
[38:50] earth shall be loosed in heaven so
[38:52] peter's got a key well he's going to use
[38:53] it here in a little while
[38:55] we don't get to it today we'll get to it
[38:57] later that's when the son of god came
[38:58] down into this dimension
[39:00] and went into the believers when peter
[39:03] said this is that
[39:05] this is that
[39:07] that key turned that keep turned we
[39:09] always talk about the key turning when
[39:10] he said repent and be baptized in the
[39:11] name of jesus christ which is fine
[39:13] but when peter stood up and said this
[39:16] i'm sorry this
[39:17] is that
[39:19] the key turn
[39:21] and whatever that was
[39:22] it had come to peter
[39:24] that's what me and you got to do with
[39:26] the word of god whatever the word of god
[39:27] says that's what's got to come to you
[39:30] because you hold the key
[39:33] you have the key inside of you
[39:36] you don't need a natural key to get in
[39:38] the kingdom of god
[39:40] i thought it was by the baptism of the
[39:41] holy ghost
[39:43] it'd be real easy to have a natural key
[39:44] if you could find one
[39:46] that's too easy no
[39:48] the key is in the bible
[39:50] the key is getting in the word of god
[39:53] but upon this rock i'll build my church
[39:56] and like i said before
[39:58] what did they build it on like i said
[40:00] you've got to take joel
[40:01] because remember that's what peter said
[40:03] this is that which said the prophet joel
[40:06] i will pour out my spirit my spirit
[40:09] upon all flesh
[40:11] anoint in other words
[40:14] at that time
[40:16] listen to me at that time peter said
[40:19] with the key
[40:20] if you'll believe on the lord jesus
[40:22] christ repent and be baptized in the
[40:23] name of jesus christ for the remission
[40:25] of sin you shall receive the gift of the
[40:26] holy ghost that key turned anybody in
[40:29] the world could receive the holy ghost
[40:32] before that they couldn't
[40:36] it was locked up
[40:38] but now anybody can get it so now even
[40:41] the people that just have an anointing
[40:43] can be anointed with the true baptism of
[40:45] the holy ghost but be raw inside
[40:48] everybody understand that how many times
[40:50] it took a prophet to tell us anointed
[40:52] ones at the end time that they're
[40:54] anointed by the true
[40:56] joel baptism joel 2
[40:59] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[41:03] old man will see dream or dream dreams
[41:05] young men you know see visions you'll
[41:07] see all that
[41:08] but when you lay it out just in a
[41:10] blanket
[41:11] everybody can receive the holy ghost now
[41:13] now god knows who will and who won't
[41:15] but we don't
[41:17] see remember they asked brother brown
[41:18] said well brother brown but
[41:19] predestination is the way you say it is
[41:20] why are you preaching god's just going
[41:22] to save them anyway they got this seated
[41:24] nope nevermind
[41:26] see anyway
[41:27] he said i preach
[41:29] god brings them in
[41:32] right
[41:32] i do i just keep preaching and god's one
[41:34] cause remember what is it paul says i i
[41:37] preach or somebody waters and somebody
[41:39] gets the increase god gets the increase
[41:41] amen so that's what you got to do you
[41:43] got to preach believing i preached today
[41:45] believing there's not one person in this
[41:47] building that doesn't have the holy
[41:48] ghost
[41:49] that's the way i have to preach
[41:52] now what's god got to do
[41:55] he's got to deal with you
[41:59] remember the preacher just gets the
[42:00] scale off of your eyes so that god can
[42:04] talk to you
[42:06] this holy ghost person
[42:08] can talk to you
[42:10] this i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[42:12] flesh can talk to you and listen
[42:15] he will talk to every person in this
[42:17] world because see that's going to be the
[42:18] condemnation at the day of judgment
[42:21] he's going to say i told y'all i'm going
[42:22] to pour out my spirit upon everybody
[42:25] and you could have received it at any
[42:26] time and i came to you right here and
[42:29] you you rejected it
[42:31] it was for everybody
[42:33] but god only knew he knew only certain
[42:36] ones was going to get it but listen so
[42:39] now wait a minute
[42:40] he said oh now wait
[42:44] god couldn't be a righteous judge if he
[42:46] didn't
[42:47] let's go back to this judgment thing
[42:49] that just struck me just now
[42:52] if he said i'll pour out my spirit upon
[42:53] all flesh
[42:55] and then you go to the day of judgment
[42:58] and god says when i didn't do it for you
[43:01] i didn't pour out my spirit on you
[43:03] see then that person can just look at
[43:05] god and say well then you're a specter
[43:06] of respect to a person you can't judge
[43:08] me
[43:11] but since god said i'll pour out my
[43:12] spirit upon all flesh and somewhere the
[43:14] holy ghost is going to meet every person
[43:15] has ever was born in this world
[43:17] amen
[43:19] because that's the judgment it's going
[43:20] to be i gave it to you and you return
[43:23] you returned it to me or you turned it
[43:25] down
[43:26] okay everybody got that
[43:28] all right so that's the god that we
[43:30] serve that's the see now that's what god
[43:32] built his church on
[43:34] okay
[43:35] justification
[43:36] baby justification which cuts off your
[43:38] past sin doesn't does nothing for your
[43:41] soul at the moment
[43:43] right
[43:45] sanctification
[43:47] in your soul the unclean spirit goes out
[43:49] of a man
[43:51] now how can an unclean spirit be in
[43:53] there and a clean spirit being there at
[43:54] the same time
[43:58] let's go with the bible in luke i
[44:00] believe it is it says the unclean spirit
[44:02] goes out of a man it don't go out of
[44:04] your flesh
[44:08] it don't go out of your spirit that's
[44:10] memories and conscious effects of
[44:11] imagination
[44:12] it goes out of your soul
[44:16] so how can
[44:18] two be in there at the same time
[44:20] you're almost a two soul doctrine
[44:23] you got you got an evil spirit inside of
[44:25] your soul and you got god's spirit if
[44:26] you say you had this seed in you before
[44:29] you i mean when you were born
[44:31] no the unclean spirit goes out
[44:36] in dry places seek his rest findeth none
[44:39] comes back
[44:40] and finds your soul
[44:44] swept and garnished
[44:45] your soul swept and garnished
[44:48] cleaned out sanctification cleans you
[44:51] and sets you aside for service
[44:54] you're not born again at that time
[44:55] anyway
[44:57] see that's the problem you can receive
[44:59] an anointing of the holy ghost and think
[45:01] you got the new birth
[45:04] when your soul is what's going to happen
[45:06] this guy right here that made you do all
[45:08] them things that you used to do
[45:10] that made you do all them things that
[45:12] motivator
[45:14] comes back into that soul
[45:17] and he don't bring seven demons that are
[45:20] cursed worse and
[45:22] fornicate worse and whatever just
[45:24] whatever list you want to call it don't
[45:26] you don't drink seven times worse
[45:28] he brings a spirit so close
[45:32] to the real
[45:34] he be he brings his anointing which he
[45:37] was the anointed cherub
[45:39] he brings his anointing back into that
[45:42] soul
[45:44] and god can anoint you with the holy
[45:46] ghost
[45:47] and you think you got it
[45:49] and and satan's sitting in there going
[45:51] you're good
[45:53] yeah make sure you sit in the message
[45:55] church okay
[45:56] just make sure you come in sit in the
[45:58] message church you're fine you're okay
[46:01] but your soul brother brown said
[46:02] anointed one's end time your soul is
[46:04] still as black as such
[46:06] because you've let that unclean spirit
[46:08] come back in you and make you seven
[46:10] times worse than you were before
[46:13] that's why folks
[46:14] if you ever come to a place of
[46:16] sanctification
[46:17] absolutely do not rest until you know
[46:20] that the good man of the house
[46:23] has entered that in part of you and
[46:25] sealed it up not just went in and
[46:28] anointed but sealed it up put it inside
[46:30] there and steal that jar
[46:32] it can't get out then
[46:34] oh come what may that doesn't matter to
[46:35] me anymore
[46:37] all that doesn't matter all the little
[46:39] frivolous stuff doesn't matter anymore
[46:41] i'm sealed in this water cannot get out
[46:46] [Laughter]
[46:48] bad example
[46:52] stop that
[46:53] i screwed that on there tight
[46:57] they are you ain't kidding they're bad i
[46:58] thought that would seal that thing never
[47:00] mind anyway
[47:01] okay all right well
[47:04] let's
[47:04] can you erase what i about three minutes
[47:06] back let's start all over again
[47:09] but you're sealed
[47:11] if you had a true jar
[47:13] if you had a true jar
[47:14] i did this in um in jamaica when we had
[47:17] a youth camp
[47:19] and remember brother adam makes the
[47:20] analogy of god walking through the
[47:22] garden picking up the dirty
[47:24] jar
[47:26] all right and says i'm gonna use this
[47:28] well see i did this i did the whole
[47:30] thing i i put it in a bunch of dirt and
[47:32] i picked it up you know and i said okay
[47:33] this is you
[47:35] you got all this junk inside of you
[47:37] because there's no seal
[47:39] you've got all this dirt all this mud i
[47:42] mean i had it in mud
[47:43] and when i picked that thing up it was
[47:45] just
[47:46] dripping mud everywhere i said this is
[47:48] you as a sinner
[47:50] this is me and you as a center
[47:53] i said you got anything in the world can
[47:55] get inside
[47:57] all right so we took it to the next step
[47:59] where i got some really clean water and
[48:01] i did some dish washing i washed dishes
[48:04] i did some dishwashing i washed that
[48:05] thing out cleaned it out and i said oh
[48:07] man that looks good doesn't it
[48:10] but still
[48:12] the unclean spirit can get back in there
[48:14] all i got to do is drop that jar
[48:17] back into that mud
[48:18] and guess what it'll fill right back up
[48:21] with mud
[48:22] see that's the unclean spirit goes out
[48:23] of a man walks and drives places comes
[48:25] back
[48:27] fills the jar back up with the same mud
[48:29] that he filled it up with but he's more
[48:31] smart now he makes you religious he
[48:34] makes you feel that anointing that he
[48:36] felt
[48:38] remember he was anointed cherubim he got
[48:40] that anointing from god
[48:42] and then he perverted it
[48:45] i don't know why i'm doing this but it's
[48:46] for somebody
[48:48] okay all right but that anointing that
[48:51] satan had is so close
[48:53] to when he comes back in you think like
[48:55] i said before here we go oh man i don't
[48:58] goodness i don't smoke no more thank the
[49:00] lord i don't i don't chew i don't
[49:03] listen when i
[49:04] when i got born again
[49:07] i had already lost those desires
[49:15] now somebody
[49:16] could lose them when you get the holy
[49:18] ghost
[49:19] i'm not saying you can't listen you'd be
[49:21] justified sanctified baptism holy ghost
[49:23] within a day or
[49:24] a time
[49:26] but some of us it takes a little longer
[49:29] but i knew the unclean spirit was gone
[49:33] okay
[49:34] because i it had resided there for a
[49:36] long period of time
[49:37] amen
[49:39] all of us yes
[49:41] it was happy there
[49:43] we were happy it was there
[49:48] it was comfortable right
[49:50] oh yeah
[49:53] but when it left
[49:55] a wet tore out of me like you wouldn't
[49:56] believe
[49:59] but i knew it wasn't in your birth
[50:02] i knew because i quit smoking i mean i
[50:04] didn't smoke but i chewed like you
[50:05] wouldn't believe chewed the back and
[50:07] cursed that was my two worst things
[50:09] and
[50:10] i knew that it went away
[50:14] but i knew by the teaching of that man
[50:16] right there and by the teaching of the
[50:17] prophet's message i wasn't finished yet
[50:22] i had just the battle had just begun
[50:25] because them demons are going to want to
[50:26] get back because you know what i made
[50:28] them uncomfortable
[50:30] i made them uncomfortable i said no you
[50:32] need to go out
[50:34] you're not going to make me do that
[50:36] anymore
[50:37] but see that's debate for the devil
[50:38] though if you're not taught right that
[50:40] you say well
[50:42] how did you get born i'm like how did
[50:43] you get born again i quit no
[50:46] that's sanctification
[50:49] that's cleaned and set aside for service
[50:52] that's holding the jar up even god hold
[50:55] the jar up and said hey i'm going to
[50:57] drink out of that
[51:00] but not right now
[51:03] all right right now i got some work to
[51:04] do i may have to sanitize it a little
[51:07] bit more because there might be still a
[51:08] little bit of stuff inside there there
[51:09] might still be a little bit of you left
[51:13] because there was a little bit of me
[51:14] left
[51:15] but when god says okay i'm gonna get
[51:19] this clean water pure as ever because
[51:22] god's pure
[51:24] and then i'm gonna
[51:25] seal it
[51:30] tighten it down
[51:32] and i'm gonna use this thing now
[51:35] see that's when it can't get in or out
[51:38] you know what when you get sealed by the
[51:40] holy ghost god can't even get out
[51:43] we don't want him out but he can't get
[51:44] out
[51:46] you're sealed until the day of your
[51:47] redemption like brother brown said the
[51:49] box car
[51:50] you're sealed the goods have been sealed
[51:52] until the day of your redemption what
[51:54] goods the goods that god put in there
[51:56] not the devil
[51:58] amen
[51:59] i don't know what i hope somebody needed
[52:01] that
[52:02] okay because that's not in my notes
[52:06] but it is good
[52:09] because we need it we need we need to
[52:11] know and then when it listen even when
[52:12] it is sealed remember that that means
[52:15] now it's put in service yes
[52:18] not what i said you know boy i'm sealed
[52:23] god listen god does not want that jar to
[52:26] sit on a shelf
[52:29] he wants what
[52:30] is in that jar
[52:32] to project to the world
[52:35] what's in that jar
[52:37] which is god now
[52:39] we projected what the world had in there
[52:42] now we're going to project what god put
[52:44] in there
[52:46] we can't lose if we seal by the holy
[52:48] ghost you can't lose
[52:52] amen
[52:54] all right
[52:56] so there's the rock that he built his
[52:58] church on maybe that's the point i was
[53:00] going to make that's the rock
[53:03] the revelation
[53:05] that the holy ghost
[53:07] is going to burn you out
[53:09] clean you up
[53:11] seal you and put you in service
[53:14] all right so there's your there's what
[53:16] he built his church on everybody that's
[53:19] the bride of jesus christ from the day
[53:21] of pentecost until this very moment came
[53:24] the same way
[53:27] might have took a year might have took a
[53:29] week might have took a month it does not
[53:31] matter
[53:32] if you're born again you went through
[53:34] that same process
[53:36] and now you're going through that
[53:38] process again
[53:40] because you got to remember when we come
[53:42] to a full revelation boy i'm way ahead
[53:45] of myself now but
[53:46] you got to realize
[53:48] that jar never was in the mud
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] i'm going to be like andrew glover
[53:57] you gotta realize that jar was never
[54:01] in the mud
[54:03] because the real you didn't do it
[54:08] but you had to go through the process
[54:10] because of redemption because you came
[54:11] from there to here
[54:13] but when you go from here to there
[54:17] it never did it in the first place
[54:23] that genesis 1 26 man was always to be
[54:26] put in use
[54:28] but what happened was
[54:30] there was a fall
[54:33] then god had to redeem
[54:35] by the three processes he had to redeem
[54:38] you back to where at least your soul
[54:42] is sitting in heavenly places
[54:44] at least your soul is like that jar
[54:46] where everything's clean
[54:48] but now remember too you got to be you
[54:50] got to be careful because i remember i
[54:52] took the jar
[54:54] in the analogy i was using with the kids
[54:56] i took the jar though and i socked it
[54:59] back down in that
[55:00] muddy water
[55:03] but when i pulled it out
[55:05] it was only dirty on the outside
[55:08] because we do have problems
[55:10] we have memory reason conscious effects
[55:12] and imagination we have all these things
[55:13] that we have to deal with because we're
[55:15] still dirt out here
[55:17] but there's no way if you seal that
[55:19] thing right
[55:20] when june pressure cooks those cans of
[55:23] beans and stuff if that thing seals
[55:25] right
[55:27] my how old how old green beans we got
[55:31] 2012.
[55:34] we got green beans that mama sealed in
[55:36] 2012.
[55:39] and you know what as long as that seal
[55:41] stays down and it doesn't pop up
[55:45] pop them babies open and eat them
[55:46] anytime you want to because they were
[55:48] sealed right the first time
[55:50] you get sealed right the first time
[55:52] you're going to be sealed until the day
[55:54] of your redemption ain't going to matter
[55:56] what date it is ain't going to be my
[55:58] ain't going to be mad or whatever
[56:01] it's going to be sealed
[56:03] since 2012.
[56:05] we got green beans that i'd eat today
[56:08] we might eat them anyway we might go to
[56:10] the house and eat them anyway
[56:12] but that's the way god is though once he
[56:13] seals you in you can't get he can't get
[56:15] out satan can't get in but if you still
[56:18] got problems because you're still going
[56:19] to be in the mud
[56:21] god's going to what i die daily paul
[56:23] says pick it up clean it off
[56:26] clean it off i make a mistake god just
[56:30] says okay i'll clean you off but inside
[56:32] of you is never dirty again
[56:35] never will be dirty again
[56:36] that's why that that that that jar will
[56:39] never have to go to judgment
[56:40] because what's inside of it's been
[56:42] changed
[56:43] what's inside of it is now god
[56:45] not the devil that's what's going to
[56:47] seal you to the day of your redemption
[56:49] and carry you all the way through
[56:52] to where one day
[56:54] you're not going in the mud anymore
[56:56] we're not putting people in the ground
[56:57] anymore
[56:58] no no no
[57:00] that thing is going to rise
[57:01] and never go down again
[57:04] amen
[57:05] that's redemption
[57:10] but upon this rock i'll build my church
[57:12] that's what he's built it like said on
[57:13] the day of pentecost until today the
[57:16] gates of hell are going to be against it
[57:18] but it will not prevail because once he
[57:20] seals you in like i said you he can't
[57:22] get out and satan can't get in all right
[57:24] so that's what he built his church on
[57:26] but now he's not finished though because
[57:28] that jar is made to be drunk from
[57:32] or used
[57:34] to put precious green beans in
[57:37] or whatever you know whatever you really
[57:39] like but god likes you
[57:42] enough to where he put himself in there
[57:44] and don't want to get out
[57:46] that's why when jesus in in tight when
[57:49] jesus come to the river jordan
[57:51] god said this is my beloved son in whom
[57:53] i'm pleased
[57:55] to be in your jar
[57:59] and that's the same thing you did at
[58:00] your new birth
[58:02] he said now i am pleased to dwell
[58:05] in your jar
[58:07] because i've sealed you by the baptism
[58:09] the holy ghost burn everything out
[58:11] because see even even when we're working
[58:13] with jars
[58:14] for the real canning process what do you
[58:17] do mom you boil them first you if
[58:19] there's any impurity inside that jar if
[58:22] you've left it sitting on the counter
[58:23] and a bug gets in it and
[58:25] or a spider or a piece of dust or a
[58:27] piece of lint gets in that jar
[58:30] see it messes it all up
[58:32] so you got to burn it with fire
[58:34] you got to boil it
[58:36] and once you boil it and get it all good
[58:38] and sanitized inside then you put
[58:39] whatever you want in there and it will
[58:41] not do anything but preserve what's in
[58:44] there now mom
[59:01] when you pressure cook it
[59:02] okay well same with us
[59:05] you put us in a pressure cooker
[59:08] tomorrow's what day
[59:10] what's tomorrow
[59:12] for those of us that have to go to work
[59:14] it's a pressure cooker
[59:16] it's already started but you know what
[59:18] god knew that though and he pressurizes
[59:20] for it because you know what those cans
[59:21] are made to be pressurized
[59:24] they're made for that
[59:25] they're not made to burst they're made
[59:27] to be pressurized
[59:28] and they're just thick enough to where
[59:30] they don't burst and god knows the same
[59:33] thing
[59:34] he knows what you can take
[59:38] letting off the pressure
[59:40] i don't know where in the world i'm
[59:42] going to go with this maybe if we get so
[59:43] far we'll quit then we'll start over
[59:45] again but let's look at number one
[59:48] but see that's but look one more time
[59:50] that's what he built all the church on
[59:54] all church
[59:56] paul
[59:57] irenaeus martin columba
[1:00:01] luther wesley
[1:00:03] pentecost the prophet of god every
[1:00:06] church age has been built on that
[1:00:07] revelation
[1:00:09] that's the son of god revelation that
[1:00:11] that son of god is going to come down
[1:00:12] burn you out put himself inside of you
[1:00:15] and put a steel on it
[1:00:17] and then you're going to act like him
[1:00:20] okay but now as we do that though as i
[1:00:22] said about going further we got to go
[1:00:24] further with that to make that jar him
[1:00:33] make the jar
[1:00:34] the same material
[1:00:37] as the creator
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] because see we're all separate we're
[1:00:43] we're going to be used and put in
[1:00:45] service
[1:00:46] but what about when you become
[1:00:49] the one that puts you in
[1:00:53] you're going to become him that's the
[1:00:56] son of man
[1:00:58] because god wasn't the second person
[1:00:59] when he became jesus christ
[1:01:02] remember and then in standing we're
[1:01:04] going to get well ahead of here but when
[1:01:06] jesus was standing on earth as the son
[1:01:08] of man he said father
[1:01:12] i pray that they be one
[1:01:15] like me and you're one
[1:01:17] the glass became the same
[1:01:20] it's not two glasses
[1:01:22] it's not two jars it's become one jar
[1:01:26] all you see
[1:01:27] is jesus christ
[1:01:29] all right so look first it was god
[1:01:30] jehovah let's picture now a little drama
[1:01:32] we talked about it this morning where
[1:01:34] god's not this he's a light but he's not
[1:01:36] a light to where that's all he is
[1:01:39] like i said before if moses had a
[1:01:41] revelation an updated revelation when he
[1:01:43] met the burning bush and the burning
[1:01:45] bush talked to him he should have saw a
[1:01:47] man
[1:01:49] because that was a man inside of there
[1:01:50] talking to him it was not a botany life
[1:01:52] bush
[1:01:53] talking to to moses that was god
[1:01:56] that had something in front of him fire
[1:01:59] in front of him because moses couldn't
[1:02:01] see him at that time
[1:02:02] even he told moses he said you can only
[1:02:04] see the back part of me why
[1:02:07] old testament
[1:02:08] blood of bulls and goats blood of calves
[1:02:12] remember it didn't take away sin so
[1:02:13] moses couldn't see his face
[1:02:15] remember the bible says he said moses
[1:02:17] you can't see my face unless you die so
[1:02:20] he saw the back part
[1:02:22] what a pre-figure of brother brown said
[1:02:24] that was jesus christ
[1:02:26] not in human flesh yet
[1:02:28] right that's what he said that was the
[1:02:29] theophany
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:33] that's why i said when when when god
[1:02:35] takes that genesis 1 26 man and he
[1:02:37] imparts or says let there be and then he
[1:02:40] says let us make man our own image make
[1:02:43] them in our likeness
[1:02:46] it wasn't a second person
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:51] it was him
[1:02:52] made manifest in another form called a
[1:02:54] bride
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:56] not another jar
[1:02:59] our problem is we see two jars
[1:03:01] because we're human beings because we
[1:03:03] are in a fallen condition
[1:03:05] we're just earthbound
[1:03:08] and we're listening from heaven
[1:03:12] i thought he was here
[1:03:14] i thought he was down here well he's if
[1:03:16] he's down here he's not just in a
[1:03:19] he's not wood
[1:03:21] he's in human flesh again
[1:03:23] me and you that's what we're getting to
[1:03:24] with this son of man because listen
[1:03:28] truthfully if you sit down and analyze
[1:03:31] it
[1:03:31] when peter and the 120 in the upper room
[1:03:34] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:37] that was god in human flesh yes
[1:03:41] but it was called the son of god it was
[1:03:43] a revelation of the son of god because
[1:03:44] it only went so far
[1:03:46] everybody got what i'm saying
[1:03:48] because it was god in human flesh when
[1:03:50] god ever puts his soul inside of you
[1:03:52] that's god in human flesh
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] but the revelation was that that was the
[1:03:58] holy ghost
[1:04:00] entered into peter james and john and
[1:04:02] they began to build a church
[1:04:06] listen me and you are not building a
[1:04:07] church right now
[1:04:09] we're at the end of this thing the
[1:04:10] church has already been built
[1:04:14] we're getting the man back here that
[1:04:16] started the church
[1:04:19] because we're not to the place to where
[1:04:22] upon this rock i'll be on my church no
[1:04:24] we are back to the place where the man
[1:04:26] standing there that said upon this rock
[1:04:28] i'll build my church that's where he is
[1:04:29] now
[1:04:31] see they didn't have that revelation
[1:04:33] the headstone or the head revelation
[1:04:36] remember was taken away what it went to
[1:04:38] heaven
[1:04:39] or it went over another dimension
[1:04:42] and this is for the church to build
[1:04:44] upon this rock
[1:04:47] i'll build my church
[1:04:50] so now there was a logos that went out
[1:04:52] of god in the beginning we don't need to
[1:04:54] cover that anymore i think we've covered
[1:04:55] that enough let's go to genesis 1 26
[1:04:57] let's just read that anyway because i
[1:04:59] like reading it anyway and god said let
[1:05:01] us make man our own image
[1:05:03] in our image after our likeness
[1:05:07] so if he's inside of you today what are
[1:05:09] you supposed to act like
[1:05:11] okay
[1:05:12] think of that yourself
[1:05:14] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:05:15] of the sea and found the air the cattle
[1:05:17] earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:05:19] creepeth upon the earth
[1:05:21] so god created a man his own image and
[1:05:23] the image of god created to him male and
[1:05:24] female
[1:05:26] created he them so there's the imparting
[1:05:28] of god or the or the expanding of god
[1:05:31] but it didn't make him a second person
[1:05:33] it didn't make this part that's
[1:05:34] expanding a second person
[1:05:36] it didn't make it two jars
[1:05:39] we made it two jars
[1:05:42] satan sold us a
[1:05:44] bit of goods and we bought it
[1:05:47] so god created a man his own image and
[1:05:48] enemy god created him and the female
[1:05:50] created in them all right go to the next
[1:05:51] one
[1:05:54] genesis 3 15.
[1:05:56] so he's going to put enmity now that
[1:05:58] genesis 1 26 man cannot come the way he
[1:06:00] wanted it to come
[1:06:02] okay
[1:06:04] can't come the way he wanted it to come
[1:06:06] he wanted to come spoken word children
[1:06:08] he wanted them to be in the garden of
[1:06:09] eden that there not be any sin there'd
[1:06:11] not be any um sickness that they're not
[1:06:13] being but still remember
[1:06:16] brother brown said one time he said that
[1:06:18] would be discomplementary to god because
[1:06:20] he had these attributes in him
[1:06:22] that that being god they have to be
[1:06:24] displayed
[1:06:26] all right so he had to display these
[1:06:28] attributes of savior and healer so he
[1:06:29] had to he knew he the prophet said he
[1:06:32] knew when he put him in human flesh they
[1:06:34] were going to fall but he couldn't not
[1:06:35] put him in human flesh
[1:06:37] because that's what he said he was going
[1:06:38] to do
[1:06:40] he said he was going to put him in human
[1:06:41] flesh genesis 2 7.
[1:06:44] but then you see this and we see the
[1:06:45] fall and then this happened so he had to
[1:06:48] divide it out again and then remember he
[1:06:50] had to be
[1:06:53] jehovah god
[1:06:55] father
[1:06:56] remember it was god above us god with us
[1:06:59] god in us
[1:07:00] all right we got to keep that straight
[1:07:01] god above us because remember sure god
[1:07:04] was there with the people but he
[1:07:06] couldn't enter the people and use them
[1:07:08] as bride
[1:07:11] so i said even the great ones like
[1:07:12] abraham different ones they were under
[1:07:14] bulls and ghosts they god couldn't clean
[1:07:15] their soul up under the blood of bulls
[1:07:17] and goats
[1:07:19] but he covered them for a period of time
[1:07:22] until christ did come the great lamb
[1:07:25] came and died and eradicated all that
[1:07:28] all right
[1:07:29] nobody got that
[1:07:30] all right
[1:07:32] let's go to the next one
[1:07:38] all right genesis 3 22.
[1:07:43] and the lord god said
[1:07:45] behold the man has become as one of us
[1:07:47] to know good and evil
[1:07:48] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[1:07:50] take also the tree of life and eat and
[1:07:52] live forever
[1:07:53] in other words you couldn't stay in the
[1:07:55] garden he had to leave
[1:07:57] he had to get out of the presence of god
[1:07:58] in that condition all right therefore
[1:08:01] the lord god sent him forth because see
[1:08:02] they had sinned
[1:08:04] they had sinned
[1:08:06] and that sin couldn't stand in front of
[1:08:07] god so he had to make a barrier or the
[1:08:10] enmity he had to get them away from him
[1:08:12] knowing he was going to bring him back
[1:08:15] but he had to get away because he was a
[1:08:16] right he's still a righteous jaw god
[1:08:18] he's not a god that can look at that
[1:08:20] filth and say well that's okay don't
[1:08:21] worry about it no there had to be a
[1:08:23] consequence
[1:08:25] by the sweat of your brow you're going
[1:08:27] to die you're going to go back to dust
[1:08:29] eve you're going to start having babies
[1:08:30] and it's going to hurt
[1:08:33] it's going to be sorrowful you're going
[1:08:34] to have all these problems you're going
[1:08:36] to have your 28 days and you're going to
[1:08:38] have all you're going to this is the way
[1:08:39] you're going to live because you did
[1:08:40] what you did
[1:08:42] but i'll get you back don't worry
[1:08:43] i'll redeem you back therefore the lord
[1:08:46] god sent him forth from the garden of
[1:08:47] eden to till the ground from which he
[1:08:49] was taken
[1:08:50] so he drove out the man
[1:08:52] and he plays the east of the garden of
[1:08:54] eden cherubim's a flaming sword which
[1:08:55] turned every way to keep the way
[1:08:59] of the tree of life
[1:09:01] to keep the way now what did jesus say
[1:09:04] when he came i am the way
[1:09:07] the truth
[1:09:08] and the tree of life
[1:09:10] i'm that person that y'all been trying
[1:09:12] to get to that you can't get to because
[1:09:15] of blood of bulls and goats because of
[1:09:16] sin i've i've now come to put this thing
[1:09:19] back together amen i'm the second adam
[1:09:21] i'm not going to fall
[1:09:23] i'm going to redeem this thing back
[1:09:25] because i said i was going to
[1:09:27] and i'm going to do it through a prophet
[1:09:31] like unto me mo the prophet like unto
[1:09:33] moses
[1:09:34] listen jesus was not was not a prophet
[1:09:36] he was the prophet
[1:09:38] man he was the prophet to come to the
[1:09:40] earth to put this thing together
[1:09:42] so now
[1:09:44] let's go to genesis 6
[1:09:46] can't get anywhere genesis 6 5 and god
[1:09:49] saw that the wickedness of man was great
[1:09:51] on the earth and ever we read it this
[1:09:52] morning and it repented the lord to him
[1:09:54] made man in his ear in earth and it
[1:09:57] grieved him at his heart and the lord
[1:09:59] said i will destroy man whom i have
[1:10:00] created from the face of the earth both
[1:10:02] man and beast and creeping things now
[1:10:04] look
[1:10:06] i forgot this morning now look
[1:10:09] and the lord said i will destroy man
[1:10:13] whom i have
[1:10:15] created
[1:10:19] he didn't say he's going to save noah
[1:10:25] he didn't did he he said now i'm going
[1:10:27] to kill everybody but this one guy
[1:10:31] but
[1:10:33] noah but
[1:10:36] put your name right there
[1:10:39] because he's going to destroy the rest
[1:10:40] of this world
[1:10:43] and if you take that in revelations and
[1:10:45] all the different places
[1:10:47] he didn't say i'm going to destroy the
[1:10:48] world and save you
[1:10:50] he said i'm going to store the world
[1:10:52] i'm destroying this world with water i'm
[1:10:53] going to do away with them
[1:10:55] and i repent from even making them
[1:10:58] now that was not the genesis 1 26 man
[1:11:03] no
[1:11:04] that has nothing to do with that
[1:11:09] because we're part of
[1:11:10] this but noah found grace
[1:11:14] in the eyes of the lord
[1:11:16] noah found grace
[1:11:19] in the eyes of the lord so luke 17 verse
[1:11:20] 26 says it was in the days of noah so
[1:11:23] shall it be also in the days of the son
[1:11:25] of man they did eat they drank they
[1:11:27] married wives they were given in
[1:11:28] marriage until the day that noah entered
[1:11:29] the ark and the flood came and destroyed
[1:11:32] them all only eight people were saved
[1:11:34] out of seven billion people
[1:11:38] how about that seven billion people
[1:11:41] and then we said this morning genesis 7
[1:11:43] verse 4 they don't have it up there so
[1:11:45] for seven days i will cause it to rain
[1:11:47] upon the earth
[1:11:48] forty for yet seven days so noah was in
[1:11:51] the ark for seven days
[1:11:53] so we had seven church we've had seven
[1:11:55] church ages to try to get this thing
[1:11:56] right
[1:11:58] we're the last
[1:12:00] so that's why it says as in the days of
[1:12:02] noah as it was in that day it's gonna be
[1:12:04] the same here we've come to an end and
[1:12:08] facing destruction
[1:12:10] facing all
[1:12:12] humanity dying
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:16] so now let's skip over
[1:12:19] let's look at genesis 18.
[1:12:24] because this is the
[1:12:25] first appearing
[1:12:28] of god in human flesh
[1:12:31] in a man called melchizedek now i know i
[1:12:33] left the one out to save time that he
[1:12:36] met him at the slaughter of the kings
[1:12:37] and gave him
[1:12:40] communion okay
[1:12:42] but this is where he made a promise
[1:12:44] this is where he made a promise to
[1:12:46] abraham
[1:12:47] because he met him as abram same way as
[1:12:50] god's going to meet you in your journey
[1:12:52] but you listen
[1:12:54] do you understand more about god now
[1:12:56] than you did when he was born again
[1:12:59] this is yes
[1:13:02] don't even say no this is yes
[1:13:04] if you don't know him yet you can say no
[1:13:07] because you don't know him yet
[1:13:09] but even in your christian journey you
[1:13:11] know more about god so that's what
[1:13:12] happened in abram abram's journey he was
[1:13:16] walking in justification and
[1:13:17] sanctification
[1:13:19] and god met him
[1:13:21] and gave him communion and abraham abram
[1:13:23] gave him tithes
[1:13:25] but he really didn't understand who he
[1:13:26] was because remember they just kind of
[1:13:28] went off the scene there was nothing
[1:13:29] really
[1:13:30] ever said after that
[1:13:33] but after he becomes abraham
[1:13:37] after he's walked into his journey and
[1:13:39] he's 99 years old still holding on to
[1:13:42] that promise he was made 25 years ago
[1:13:46] god finally meets him face to face
[1:13:48] in human flesh
[1:13:51] now this i'll read you this quote in a
[1:13:52] minute
[1:13:53] but brother branham tells this story and
[1:13:56] who is this melchizedek and he says
[1:13:59] every son of the faith
[1:14:00] has got to meet this same situation
[1:14:04] at the final end
[1:14:05] so if you're a son and daughter of god
[1:14:07] today you got to meet this
[1:14:10] i'm just going to tell you what the
[1:14:11] prophet said
[1:14:12] and the lord appeared unto him and him
[1:14:14] who abram abraham in the plains of
[1:14:16] memory and he sat in the tent door in
[1:14:18] the heat of the day and he lifted up his
[1:14:20] eyes and looked and lo
[1:14:22] three men stood by him
[1:14:25] now they all have a
[1:14:26] place all right and when he saw them he
[1:14:29] ran to meet them
[1:14:31] he was still looking at three
[1:14:34] he ran to meet them from the tent door
[1:14:36] and bound himself toward the ground and
[1:14:39] said my lord
[1:14:42] now that meaning is adonai
[1:14:45] adonai
[1:14:48] go to the next
[1:14:49] say look says my lord if now i found
[1:14:52] favor in thy sight pass not away i pray
[1:14:54] thee from thy servant
[1:14:55] let a little water i pray that he'd be
[1:14:57] fat see look he didn't have a problem
[1:15:00] he wasn't scared to meet god in human
[1:15:02] flesh because he called him my lord
[1:15:06] brother brown said he wouldn't have
[1:15:07] called him that if he didn't know who he
[1:15:09] was all right so he knew that was god in
[1:15:11] human flesh
[1:15:15] he did he said my lord
[1:15:17] so he didn't have a problem with giving
[1:15:19] him some water and
[1:15:20] washing his feet and rest yourself under
[1:15:22] the tree now let's go to the meaning of
[1:15:24] this word it's adonai which is close to
[1:15:27] adonai
[1:15:28] but look what it means
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:33] when he said my lord he was telling that
[1:15:36] person
[1:15:37] i know you're god and i know you're in
[1:15:39] human flesh
[1:15:41] it wasn't a theophany it was a human
[1:15:43] flesh person that theophany was inside
[1:15:46] of that person but it's of men or lord
[1:15:48] the title spoken in place of yahweh and
[1:15:51] jewish display of reverence
[1:15:53] so abraham was getting a revelation that
[1:15:56] there was god
[1:15:58] in human flesh
[1:16:00] and he didn't have a problem with it
[1:16:02] he didn't run off and ask his
[1:16:04] anyway
[1:16:07] he didn't have to get a quote
[1:16:13] genesis 18 verse 20.
[1:16:16] now we know what happened
[1:16:18] we know that he told abraham he said
[1:16:20] okay according to the time of life
[1:16:22] you're going to have a child and you're
[1:16:23] going to have it through sarah
[1:16:25] and you're going to have it you know
[1:16:26] you're going to have it by this time
[1:16:28] next year you're going to have a baby in
[1:16:29] your hands
[1:16:30] all right so that continues on but then
[1:16:32] watch what happens here because
[1:16:35] we're going to read
[1:16:37] where this is also coming up in the day
[1:16:39] of the son of man
[1:16:41] so watch and the lord said
[1:16:43] because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is
[1:16:45] great and because their sin is very
[1:16:47] grievous
[1:16:48] i will go down now and see whether they
[1:16:50] have done all together according to the
[1:16:52] cry of it which is coming to me and if
[1:16:54] not i will know now what does he do
[1:16:57] he doesn't go down there he sends two
[1:16:59] prophets down there
[1:17:01] he sends two men down there all right
[1:17:04] and they were angels the prophet said
[1:17:07] they weren't human beings
[1:17:08] they had human flesh but they weren't
[1:17:10] human beings they were they were angels
[1:17:12] all right
[1:17:13] and the men turned their faces from then
[1:17:16] from thence what the two men and went
[1:17:18] towards sodom but abram stood yet before
[1:17:20] the lord so the lord stayed there with
[1:17:21] abraham
[1:17:23] all right because we're going to see a
[1:17:24] situation here in just a minute all
[1:17:26] right so let's continue on
[1:17:31] let me read this real quick
[1:17:33] because i want to interject this and who
[1:17:34] is this melchizedek brother brown said
[1:17:36] god
[1:17:37] in this stage now they don't have it
[1:17:38] here i'm going to read it to you it's
[1:17:40] this stage of his creation later formed
[1:17:42] in the flesh jesus from the great
[1:17:44] beginning that's where i've been taking
[1:17:46] you to spirit then came down to be the
[1:17:48] word bringing itself out the word
[1:17:50] doesn't yet make itself it just spoke
[1:17:52] out in morphy later he becomes flesh
[1:17:55] jesus now when abraham met him he was
[1:17:58] melchizedek
[1:17:59] all right
[1:18:01] he was melchizedek he unfolds here what
[1:18:04] all the attributes will do in the final
[1:18:07] end now what are you you're an attribute
[1:18:08] of god
[1:18:11] every son of abraham every son of the
[1:18:13] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[1:18:17] you're going to have to meet god in
[1:18:18] human flesh
[1:18:19] and he's going to have to give you a
[1:18:20] promise of a body change because that's
[1:18:22] what he gave a promise to abraham
[1:18:26] huh
[1:18:27] their body got changed somewhere after
[1:18:30] this time right here after god left
[1:18:32] communion with abraham
[1:18:34] their body got changed i don't know if
[1:18:36] it was the next day or the next month
[1:18:38] but i promise you he said within this
[1:18:41] year
[1:18:42] 12 months
[1:18:43] a baby takes nine months
[1:18:46] something had to happen pretty quick
[1:18:48] they were changed pretty quick after
[1:18:50] this situation
[1:18:52] so after we meet melchizedek same thing
[1:18:54] is going to happen
[1:18:56] so now look
[1:18:58] genesis 18 33 watch the order now look
[1:19:01] and the lord went his way as soon as he
[1:19:04] had left communion with abraham and
[1:19:06] abraham returned unto his place
[1:19:09] now
[1:19:11] something went to sodom
[1:19:13] watch genesis 19 1 which is the next
[1:19:17] chapter next verse
[1:19:18] and there came two angels to sodom and
[1:19:20] evening and lot sat in the gate of sodom
[1:19:23] and lot seeing them rose up to meet them
[1:19:25] and he bowed himself with his face
[1:19:27] toward the ground same thing abraham did
[1:19:30] abraham bowed
[1:19:32] and said my lord
[1:19:36] lot
[1:19:38] said now behold now
[1:19:40] my lords
[1:19:41] two of them
[1:19:46] lukewarm church
[1:19:49] revelation
[1:19:50] of a trinity
[1:19:53] abraham didn't have a revelation of the
[1:19:54] trinity abraham had a revelation that
[1:19:56] there was only one god it didn't matter
[1:19:58] how many were standing around that one
[1:20:00] man
[1:20:02] that man is my lord
[1:20:05] i know that's god in human flesh these
[1:20:07] two over here don't know anything about
[1:20:08] them because remember those two were not
[1:20:10] to him
[1:20:13] those two were for sodom
[1:20:15] those two were for the world
[1:20:17] those two were not for the elect
[1:20:21] abraham was the elect
[1:20:24] god came to the elect
[1:20:30] there came two men and then he said
[1:20:32] behold now my lords
[1:20:34] turn in i pray you into your servant's
[1:20:36] house
[1:20:37] and tarry all night and wash your feet
[1:20:42] and what's the difference there
[1:20:45] he told them to wash their own feet
[1:20:48] abraham said let me wash your feet
[1:20:52] when he talked to
[1:20:53] my lord
[1:20:55] he said uh
[1:20:57] you know
[1:20:59] lot said go wash your own feet i don't
[1:21:02] have a revelation of who you are
[1:21:06] and you shall rise up early
[1:21:08] and go on your way
[1:21:10] now abraham didn't want that man to go
[1:21:12] on his way he wanted melchizedek to stay
[1:21:15] right down because he even said he said
[1:21:17] lord he said if you can find
[1:21:19] down to 10 people in sodom
[1:21:22] he said will you not destroy it he said
[1:21:23] nope i won't destroy it if i find 10
[1:21:25] people
[1:21:26] but we know he didn't he didn't find but
[1:21:28] a few and they were they were lukewarm
[1:21:30] church believers they weren't true
[1:21:31] believers
[1:21:32] we'll read that in just a minute all
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:35] so behold my lords
[1:21:37] now what happened here is we're going to
[1:21:39] read luke 17 verse 28 but you're gonna
[1:21:42] see that what happened in sodom
[1:21:44] what was outside of the door of sodom a
[1:21:46] bunch of sinners perverts they wanted to
[1:21:49] take these two angels and get to know
[1:21:51] them and that no ain't just knowing and
[1:21:53] shaking hands that's what the bible says
[1:21:56] remember lot even gave his two daughters
[1:21:58] up
[1:21:59] so you can have my daughters don't touch
[1:22:02] these men don't do this
[1:22:04] so you got sinners you got lot the
[1:22:07] lukewarm church that didn't come
[1:22:08] completely out god had to get him out
[1:22:11] god had to tell him through them two
[1:22:12] witnesses or two people
[1:22:15] billy graham or roberts whatever you
[1:22:17] want to say
[1:22:18] because brother branham said he smote
[1:22:20] the blind remember he spoke the people's
[1:22:22] eyes
[1:22:23] through
[1:22:24] billy graham and oral robbers the
[1:22:26] nominal church or the lukewarm church
[1:22:28] and brother brown said i didn't bring
[1:22:29] the quote but he said there was three
[1:22:31] groups of people sinners on the outside
[1:22:33] lukewarm lot on the inside that didn't
[1:22:35] really want to leave he kind of liked
[1:22:36] sodom but you noticed abraham was afar
[1:22:39] off
[1:22:40] he wasn't even close
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:44] and there was the elect abraham god
[1:22:46] stayed with the elect
[1:22:48] and the two witnesses went down to sodom
[1:22:50] now let's look luke 17 verse 28.
[1:22:53] likewise also it was in the days of lot
[1:22:56] they did eat they drank they bought they
[1:22:58] sold they planted they build it sounds
[1:22:59] like today
[1:23:01] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:23:02] sodom it ran fire and brimstone from
[1:23:04] heaven
[1:23:05] and destroyed them all so right at the
[1:23:07] brink of destruction if you'll read that
[1:23:11] i didn't bring it but if you'll read
[1:23:12] that situation lot wanted to stay
[1:23:16] aaron's shaking his head he's ready
[1:23:18] before lot wanted to stay he said hold
[1:23:19] on a minute
[1:23:22] he said let me go talk to my two
[1:23:24] son-in-laws
[1:23:25] i didn't even realize his two daughters
[1:23:26] were married i thought they were virgins
[1:23:28] no they were married they had so they
[1:23:29] had two son-in-laws he went and talked
[1:23:31] to them and they didn't want to come out
[1:23:33] and the angel finally the bible says
[1:23:35] they grabbed them
[1:23:37] and said get out of the city
[1:23:41] lot kind of wanted to stay around a
[1:23:43] little bit
[1:23:44] we don't want to
[1:23:47] god comes to us to get us out of this
[1:23:48] thing i'm not going to say hang on a
[1:23:50] minute
[1:23:57] i don't have nothing extra to go get
[1:24:01] i want to leave this place
[1:24:03] i don't want to be tied to the world but
[1:24:04] see lot was that lukewarm church that
[1:24:06] was tied to the world his revelation was
[1:24:08] that he was okay right where he was at
[1:24:11] because remember now listen the bible
[1:24:12] says that it vex lots righteous soul
[1:24:15] brother murmur said he was saved
[1:24:18] he wasn't born again you don't stand by
[1:24:20] type but he was a saved lukewarm church
[1:24:22] member
[1:24:25] but he wasn't bribed
[1:24:26] the elect was up there on the hill
[1:24:28] that god had visited
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:31] so we had that same visitation because
[1:24:33] it says even thus shall it be in the day
[1:24:38] now look when the son of man is revealed
[1:24:41] he was not revealed two 000 years ago
[1:24:45] he was not revealed to abraham as the
[1:24:47] son of man
[1:24:48] only in this day
[1:24:50] by the opening of the seven seals did we
[1:24:53] get a revelation of the son of man
[1:24:56] not in the years of preparation
[1:24:58] amen
[1:25:00] not in the years of preparation but
[1:25:02] right now
[1:25:04] when the seven seals is open we're
[1:25:05] getting ready to look at we're right at
[1:25:07] the door of destruction
[1:25:09] we got to make a choice to get in or get
[1:25:11] out
[1:25:12] quit hanging around
[1:25:15] i bet you there was a lot of claw marks
[1:25:17] on those doors that noah that ark
[1:25:20] when he pitched that thing on the
[1:25:22] outside with tar there was a bunch of
[1:25:23] fingernail marks because she there was
[1:25:26] always a bunch that hung around the door
[1:25:29] well i don't know about if if i don't
[1:25:31] know if noah's gonna nah come on it
[1:25:33] ain't gonna rain
[1:25:35] that that prophet y'all said he's not
[1:25:41] he's not real
[1:25:43] he's a deceiver
[1:25:45] he's a false prophet
[1:25:47] god proved to the world
[1:25:50] that noah was the prophet of the day
[1:25:53] shut the door
[1:25:56] because you know what noah being a
[1:25:59] graceful person probably wanted to do
[1:26:01] like jesus christ and wanted to save
[1:26:03] everybody out there in that world
[1:26:05] so god finally said no i'll do it
[1:26:09] so god took his mighty hand and he
[1:26:11] slammed that door shut
[1:26:14] and left everybody else because he said
[1:26:15] i give you 120 years
[1:26:18] because remember this same god
[1:26:20] that shut the door
[1:26:23] four thousand years later
[1:26:26] went visited them people again
[1:26:30] what do you mean brother wade the bible
[1:26:32] tells us he went to hell and preached to
[1:26:34] the souls that were in prison in the
[1:26:36] days of noah
[1:26:39] he told those seven billion people i'm
[1:26:42] what noah was trying to get you to talk
[1:26:44] they talked to you about
[1:26:47] 4 000 years ago
[1:26:50] he said but i can't do anything for you
[1:26:51] now
[1:26:52] he said i'm just down here for a witness
[1:26:55] i'm telling you
[1:26:56] i'm the one that he preached about
[1:27:00] don't ever let him tell you that
[1:27:02] don't ever let him go to another
[1:27:04] dimension and tell you i'm the one
[1:27:07] that that brother or that
[1:27:09] prophet preached about
[1:27:12] it's going to happen
[1:27:14] there's going to come a time
[1:27:15] they're going to meet
[1:27:17] that person they turn down
[1:27:19] but even though shall it be in the day
[1:27:22] when the son of man
[1:27:23] is revealed let's let's look at one more
[1:27:25] situation and then we'll close right
[1:27:26] here
[1:27:28] everybody all right
[1:27:31] let's look at moses
[1:27:34] now look moses is the one that said
[1:27:36] god will raise up a prophet like unto me
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] he's the one who said that so there will
[1:27:43] be
[1:27:45] a prophet in human flesh
[1:27:49] come to a
[1:27:50] generation of people
[1:27:53] and call them out
[1:27:54] yes
[1:27:56] what did moses do
[1:27:58] moses was sent to a generation of people
[1:28:00] to call them out
[1:28:02] right call them out of egypt
[1:28:03] so jesus christ is the same thing he's
[1:28:05] going to raise a prophet like unto me
[1:28:07] that prophet is going to come and do the
[1:28:08] same thing and you'll hearken to his
[1:28:10] voice or you should
[1:28:12] but now look that was jehovah
[1:28:15] and i'm trying to cut some of this out
[1:28:17] to save time that was jehovah in a
[1:28:18] tabernacle they built a tabernacle that
[1:28:21] was an outer court justification
[1:28:23] inner court
[1:28:25] right
[1:28:26] sanctification there was just a little
[1:28:29] bit of artificial light the prophet said
[1:28:30] a little bit of shoe bread right
[1:28:33] but then the holy of holies see that
[1:28:35] many people could go many people will
[1:28:37] get justified
[1:28:40] many people because there's a lot of
[1:28:41] area out here
[1:28:44] but you go into that next room and the
[1:28:46] room gets smaller
[1:28:48] you can only fit so many people only the
[1:28:50] priest and the high priest could go into
[1:28:51] that room
[1:28:53] right but when you go into the third
[1:28:55] room
[1:28:56] one person
[1:28:59] one person meets one person
[1:29:02] that's where god resides
[1:29:04] and the priest high priest once a year
[1:29:07] went behind that veil and gave blood for
[1:29:11] the people the blood of the of the lamb
[1:29:13] for the people
[1:29:16] and look
[1:29:18] they didn't see god the whole time
[1:29:22] sure they saw his manifestation
[1:29:25] fire smoke
[1:29:27] lights
[1:29:28] whole built i mean the whole mountain
[1:29:30] was on fire
[1:29:31] they heard the thunder
[1:29:33] they heard the rumbling
[1:29:35] but they only listened to moses
[1:29:38] and they didn't listen to moses of very
[1:29:40] much anyway because listen what did
[1:29:41] moses have to do once or twice i know he
[1:29:43] did one time he throwed himself in front
[1:29:45] of the door of god and said look if
[1:29:48] you're going to kill them you got to
[1:29:49] kill me because god said get out of the
[1:29:50] way i'm going to wipe this bunch off and
[1:29:53] i'm going to start all over again
[1:29:56] but moses through himself the prophet
[1:29:57] said in the breach and became as christ
[1:30:01] became as christ he wasn't christ he
[1:30:03] came as christ and said look you're
[1:30:05] gonna have to come over me to get to
[1:30:06] them
[1:30:08] wow
[1:30:09] you know that's what jesus said
[1:30:12] jesus told the heavenly father he said
[1:30:14] you're gonna have to come over me to get
[1:30:15] to them
[1:30:17] you can't get by me
[1:30:19] i'm going to die
[1:30:21] i'm going to give my life
[1:30:24] so that i can save them people that's
[1:30:26] what moses said moses said god if you're
[1:30:27] going to kill them you've got to kill me
[1:30:30] have we ever thrown ourself in the
[1:30:32] breach through that have you ever got
[1:30:33] that desperate for your kids and said
[1:30:35] god
[1:30:37] you're going to take me
[1:30:39] take me lord
[1:30:41] save my kids
[1:30:44] but listen this is what god said about
[1:30:45] these people that followed the cloud and
[1:30:48] they followed the fire and they followed
[1:30:50] listen
[1:30:51] we were talking the other day
[1:30:53] you know the bible even tells us
[1:30:56] that god was so much around these people
[1:31:00] to when they were born
[1:31:02] they wore diapers
[1:31:04] and they wore onesies
[1:31:06] most of you know what onesies are
[1:31:09] right
[1:31:10] but that same person
[1:31:12] 40 years later
[1:31:15] who's wearing the same clothes
[1:31:17] not a onesie
[1:31:19] and what the bible say the bible said
[1:31:21] their their clothes never got worn they
[1:31:24] didn't have to change or make clothes it
[1:31:27] grew with the person
[1:31:29] they're shoes
[1:31:31] i think i did me and michael were
[1:31:33] talking about i mean michael's got like
[1:31:34] a size 15.
[1:31:36] and so is andrew glover they both wore
[1:31:38] the same size shoe i mean it was four
[1:31:41] cows
[1:31:43] worth of shoes out there
[1:31:45] four full cows
[1:31:48] but think about it though their shoes
[1:31:49] grew
[1:31:52] their clothes grew
[1:31:54] god said here's you some clay i mean
[1:31:55] here's you some manna
[1:31:57] hears you some quail
[1:31:59] i i'm gonna just like make a stream that
[1:32:02] runs beside you and all you gotta do is
[1:32:04] reach down and get you some water
[1:32:07] and and and you and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:32:09] water two million people plus animals
[1:32:13] every day for 40 years
[1:32:17] and they did not like him
[1:32:20] they died in the wilderness dead
[1:32:24] jesus said they're everyone eternally
[1:32:26] separated from god
[1:32:29] but this is what he said about them i
[1:32:30] want you to put yourself in this place
[1:32:32] for thou art a holy people now this is
[1:32:34] deuteronomy this is what god is saying
[1:32:36] as they get ready to enter their journey
[1:32:39] for thou art a holy people unto the lord
[1:32:41] thy god the lord thy god has chosen thee
[1:32:45] to be a special people
[1:32:54] unto himself
[1:32:56] above all people
[1:32:59] that are on the face of this earth
[1:33:03] the lord
[1:33:06] did not set his love upon you
[1:33:08] nor choose you
[1:33:09] because you were special
[1:33:12] or you were more in numbers
[1:33:14] that's what it says here
[1:33:17] because you were more in numbers
[1:33:19] than any people
[1:33:20] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:33:25] but because the lord loved you
[1:33:28] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:33:31] he had sworn unto your
[1:33:34] fathers hath the lord brought you out
[1:33:37] with a mighty hand
[1:33:40] and redeemed you
[1:33:42] out of the house of bond men
[1:33:45] from the hands of pharaoh king of egypt
[1:33:48] put yourself in that place this is what
[1:33:50] he's done for you he's took you out
[1:33:55] delivered you out of what your bondman
[1:33:58] whatever bounds you you know that's what
[1:34:00] a bondman is somebody that bound that
[1:34:02] binds you all right
[1:34:05] know therefore that the lord thy god he
[1:34:08] is god
[1:34:09] the faithful god which keepeth
[1:34:12] commandment and mercy with them that
[1:34:14] love him and keep his commandments
[1:34:19] to 1 000
[1:34:22] generations
[1:34:24] wow
[1:34:26] that's what he said about a group of
[1:34:28] people that didn't even do what he said
[1:34:31] that group of people gave him trouble
[1:34:33] because they didn't have the baptism of
[1:34:34] the holy ghost
[1:34:36] but you by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:38] that's to you and you can do that amen
[1:34:41] you and i can do that listen the rite of
[1:34:43] redemption has been claimed and that's
[1:34:45] what we'll talk about next time we'll
[1:34:47] come to boaz at the rite of redemption
[1:34:51] let's stand to our feet
[1:34:54] boaz had to be in the same line as naomi
[1:34:59] or he could not redeem
[1:35:02] naomi's property
[1:35:04] so jesus christ had to become the son of
[1:35:07] man
[1:35:09] to redeem
[1:35:11] or to
[1:35:12] play the part
[1:35:14] of the rite of redemption
[1:35:16] what did boaz do he took his feet took
[1:35:18] his shoe off
[1:35:19] and he held it up and he said today i
[1:35:21] redeem
[1:35:24] jesus christ put both hands out
[1:35:27] he said today i redeem
[1:35:30] all my property
[1:35:33] satan
[1:35:35] death where'd you stand
[1:35:38] grave where's your victory
[1:35:41] we have all things
[1:35:43] take that promise i thought that was a
[1:35:44] real neat promise there you i'd put that
[1:35:47] thing and read it again deuteronomy
[1:35:48] there
[1:35:49] in seven verse six
[1:35:52] for thou art a holy people
[1:35:54] the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a
[1:35:57] special people
[1:35:59] unto himself above all people that are
[1:36:01] upon the face of the earth
[1:36:03] listen
[1:36:04] that genesis 1 26 man
[1:36:08] he did everything
[1:36:10] even died for that group of people
[1:36:14] and that's me and you by the baptism of
[1:36:16] the holy ghost
[1:36:18] not by our natural birth
[1:36:20] but by new birth that's what god did for
[1:36:22] us
[1:36:26] he was going to have
[1:36:28] i read it in blasphemies names
[1:36:31] brother brown said god's going to have a
[1:36:33] bride
[1:36:34] and he said i hope i'm part of it. he
[1:36:36] said but i'll say again god is going to
[1:36:39] have a bride
[1:36:41] so listen god is going to have
[1:36:44] a group of people that will manifest the
[1:36:47] son of man
[1:36:49] in the end time
[1:36:50] he promised it as it was in the days of
[1:36:53] noah as it was in the days of lot so
[1:36:55] shall it be when the son of man is being
[1:36:58] revealed
[1:36:59] now just show up
[1:37:02] jesus christ didn't just show
[1:37:04] up he came with a plan and a purpose
[1:37:08] from his birth to his death there was a
[1:37:10] purpose for that man to be here
[1:37:12] and now where is that man
[1:37:16] in you by the new birth
[1:37:18] flesh becoming word word becoming flesh

[1:39:27] amen let's go ahead in the communion
[1:39:29] first corinthians
[1:39:32] 11 verse 23
[1:39:34] and we're just going to take communion
[1:39:35] and then we'll do foot washing in
[1:39:37] november all right
[1:39:40] you love the lord
[1:39:42] what a mighty god we serve
[1:39:45] all right first corinthians 11 verse 23
[1:39:48] for i have received of the lord that
[1:39:49] which also i delivered unto you now this
[1:39:51] is paul he received the revelation paul
[1:39:53] wasn't in the upper room
[1:39:56] to receive communion amen he wasn't
[1:39:58] there but the lord gave him a revelation
[1:40:01] and must have gave him a vision brother
[1:40:02] bob because he wrote it just like it was
[1:40:05] said
[1:40:06] he gave it to paul because paul had a
[1:40:08] deeper revelation of what was going on
[1:40:10] amen
[1:40:11] for i have received of the lord that
[1:40:13] which i also i delivered unto you that
[1:40:14] the lord jesus the same night in which
[1:40:16] he was betrayed took bread see that was
[1:40:18] a night before he was betrayed and then
[1:40:20] the next day was
[1:40:22] was the feast and when he had given
[1:40:24] thanks he broke it and said take eat
[1:40:26] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:40:28] that's due in remembrance of me
[1:40:30] after the same manner also he took the
[1:40:32] cup which he had saying
[1:40:34] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:40:36] blood see the old testament was the
[1:40:38] blood of bulls and ghosts the old
[1:40:39] testament was covering or capoed their
[1:40:41] sin the old they had to depend on one
[1:40:43] man to go behind the holy of holies this
[1:40:45] man right here is fishing to do away
[1:40:46] with all that
[1:40:48] he's fixing to say now you can come
[1:40:52] to me all you that labor in heavy laden
[1:40:54] and i'll give you rest after the same
[1:40:56] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:40:58] stopped saying this cup is the new
[1:40:59] testament in my blood this do you as
[1:41:01] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:41:03] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:41:05] and drink this cup you do sure of the
[1:41:06] lord's death till i come that's why i
[1:41:08] like for us taking communion every month
[1:41:11] because it reminds us
[1:41:13] it reminds us of what god did for us
[1:41:15] amen
[1:41:18] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:41:20] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:41:21] unworthily
[1:41:23] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:41:25] the lord
[1:41:26] but let a man examine himself so let him
[1:41:29] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:41:31] so it gives you a way out it gives you
[1:41:33] it gives you a way to repent
[1:41:35] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:41:36] unworthily either to drink of damnation
[1:41:38] unto himself not discerning the lord's
[1:41:41] body now who's the lord's body it's not
[1:41:42] that right there
[1:41:44] it's this right here
[1:41:46] it's this body not not the symbols
[1:41:49] not his natural body
[1:41:51] but his spiritual body on earth called
[1:41:52] the bride amen
[1:41:55] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:41:56] among you in many sleep
[1:41:58] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:42:00] should not be judged but when we are
[1:42:02] judged we are chastened to the lord that
[1:42:05] we should not be condemned with the
[1:42:06] world
[1:42:07] remember we've been called out we've
[1:42:09] been a special people
[1:42:11] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:42:12] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:42:15] and if any many man hunger let him eat
[1:42:17] at home
[1:42:18] you know the situation with that paul
[1:42:20] come up to the corinthians and they were
[1:42:22] just having like a feast and getting
[1:42:23] drunk and eating all kind of stuff and
[1:42:26] just they were just having a
[1:42:27] thanksgiving dinner
[1:42:29] he said no
[1:42:30] he said it's way more solemn than that
[1:42:32] folks
[1:42:33] this is a solemn time it's not something
[1:42:36] you know this is okay but i wouldn't
[1:42:37] want to have this as a meal
[1:42:40] right but jesus christ suffered
[1:42:44] so we're to show that that he suffered a
[1:42:48] blood and flesh
[1:42:50] and give it for me and you wherefore my
[1:42:52] brother when you come together to eat
[1:42:53] terry one for another and if any man
[1:42:55] hunger let him eat at home
[1:42:57] not here letting me at home that you
[1:42:59] come not together in the condemnation
[1:43:01] and the rest will i set an order
[1:43:03] when i come in other words he was coming
[1:43:04] back to see the corinthians and he was
[1:43:07] going to set all this in order so let's
[1:43:08] tarry for just a few moments the prophet
[1:43:11] of god said pray for your pastor
[1:43:13] and he'll be praying for you
[1:43:26] jesus name we pray
[1:43:27] amen the bible said he took bread and
[1:43:29] blessed it dear heavenly father lord
[1:43:31] this bread has been made lord
[1:43:33] with holy hands it's not been bought
[1:43:36] it's not been took out of a box
[1:43:38] lord but it's been made with sanctified
[1:43:40] hands lord
[1:43:42] and it's been made the way you wanted it
[1:43:44] made so lord i pray that as we take this
[1:43:46] communion today
[1:43:48] that this bread and this wine will
[1:43:50] absolutely lord help us
[1:43:52] lord become closer to you father
[1:43:54] and lord to do the things that we're
[1:43:56] supposed to do lord and not let the
[1:43:58] devil have any place
[1:44:00] from this day forward in jesus name we
[1:44:02] pray
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:10] yeah as i've told you before we
[1:44:12] when we were younger we
[1:44:14] uh
[1:44:15] i guess terence was a baby back then but
[1:44:18] we'd sit on the counter there and up on
[1:44:20] top of the hill and had a little bitty
[1:44:21] counter a small kitchen
[1:44:23] and we'd sit there and we'd watch them
[1:44:26] get all this grape juice ready and watch
[1:44:28] them get all this
[1:44:30] stuff out of a box and it was a little
[1:44:32] absolute i a perfect square wafer
[1:44:36] and they would all have to thaw it out
[1:44:39] because it was held over
[1:44:41] because we didn't have that revelation
[1:44:43] that it's not to be held over that it
[1:44:45] wasn't they didn't take it you know
[1:44:47] seriously not sacred not have wine i
[1:44:49] guess they figured that wine was too
[1:44:51] strong for them
[1:44:53] i guess they thought the holy ghost was
[1:44:54] too strong for them
[1:44:56] you know
[1:44:58] but we know
[1:44:59] the truth
[1:45:01] we know the truth we know the truth has
[1:45:03] set us free it's give us lord it's give
[1:45:05] us liberty
[1:45:07] and we've seen people healed taking this
[1:45:09] communion
[1:45:11] we have seen people literally healed
[1:45:13] uh
[1:45:14] i believe dad somebody spoke in tongues
[1:45:16] one time when they were you took
[1:45:17] communion to somebody that was uh
[1:45:18] brother dean i think it was was speaking
[1:45:20] in tongues when he started taking the
[1:45:22] communion so listen
[1:45:24] this is not just a ritual folks
[1:45:27] god told us to do this till he comes and
[1:45:30] if he didn't then he's a liar and he's
[1:45:32] not a liar he said his word will not
[1:45:34] return void
[1:45:35] so when we take this thing if you've got
[1:45:36] something in your heart that you need
[1:45:39] physically spiritually whatever you want
[1:45:41] take this is the same thing as it being
[1:45:44] not the body and blood of the lord but a
[1:45:45] symbol
[1:45:47] what is communion intimacy
[1:45:49] it's becoming closer to god
[1:45:52] listen the first communion was ever
[1:45:54] given was given by the man himself
[1:45:57] right
[1:45:58] to a group of people he said this is my
[1:46:00] body
[1:46:01] which is going to be broken for you
[1:46:03] this do ye in remembrance of me to
[1:46:06] heavenly father lord this wine has been
[1:46:08] made
[1:46:09] by holy hands father
[1:46:11] and it's true wine that gets better with
[1:46:13] age
[1:46:14] it doesn't
[1:46:15] it doesn't get worse and it doesn't
[1:46:16] ferment lord it becomes lord wonderful
[1:46:20] clear wine lord that even actually helps
[1:46:22] us even in our healthy part of our body
[1:46:24] lord so i pray lord as we partake of
[1:46:26] this lord it will remember that the
[1:46:28] blood flowed at calvary
[1:46:30] it flowed out of your body lord and it
[1:46:32] hit the ground and lord you sanctified
[1:46:34] us lord
[1:46:35] and you give us a journey to go on the
[1:46:37] lord and now we are coming forward to
[1:46:38] the end of that journey and i pray lord
[1:46:40] that we receive more revelation
[1:46:42] as the days come lord we pray this in
[1:46:44] jesus name
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:51] come morning
[1:46:53] i'll walk
[1:46:55] by the river
[1:46:58] i'll rest near
[1:47:00] the
[1:47:01] evergreen tree
[1:47:03] [Music]
