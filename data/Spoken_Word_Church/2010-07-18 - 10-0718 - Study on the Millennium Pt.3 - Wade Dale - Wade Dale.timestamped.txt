[0:01] now
[0:03] okay how's that 65.
[0:05] thank all y'all that came yesterday and
[0:07] cooked and fixed i want to thank you
[0:08] daddy will probably thank you
[0:11] 140 people 139 exactly
[0:15] there last night at the fellowship
[0:17] meetings so
[0:18] that was a record that's the most
[0:20] anybody ever
[0:22] come so we
[0:23] hope everybody's gonna get time
[0:29] isaiah 65.
[0:31] now what we've been doing just for
[0:32] background again what i've been doing is
[0:34] we've
[0:36] we started talking about the millennium
[0:37] and then it kind of struck me to
[0:41] kind of do a comparison between what is
[0:43] in the millennium and what is
[0:45] in the future home what is the
[0:46] similarities and what's the total
[0:49] difference
[0:50] between each one
[0:52] the millennium for one thing is still in
[0:54] time
[0:56] so sin is still here once you if you
[0:58] ever have time you have sin because
[0:59] remember in the garden of eden
[1:02] time started when they sinned right
[1:05] so time and sin is pretty much close
[1:08] together
[1:09] uh so as long as you have time you're
[1:11] going to have sin so there will be a
[1:13] thousand years that we live and rule and
[1:15] reign in the millennium
[1:16] and it will be a 360 day
[1:20] 1000 years all right
[1:22] the future home is totally different
[1:25] because
[1:26] i say totally but it's not totally
[1:28] different it is different in the sense
[1:31] that the millennium has time the future
[1:34] home has eternity so
[1:36] that's not going to bother me and you
[1:39] mean you are eternal on this side right
[1:41] here on this earth
[1:43] but and even in the millennium you and i
[1:45] will be in glorified bodies but there's
[1:48] a process like i said god is
[1:50] so wonderful that that we can't digest
[1:53] all this at one time so he puts things
[1:55] in stages human beings like things in
[1:57] stages
[1:58] all right
[1:59] are in revelation which is the revealing
[2:02] part all right
[2:04] so he reveals his self to us down here
[2:07] as the son of god
[2:09] then as the son of man to take us in a
[2:12] rapture
[2:12] then he's promised and we read it before
[2:16] of the son of david
[2:18] david was promised that his son would
[2:20] rule and reign on the throne of david
[2:24] so this is where the millennium temple
[2:25] comes in
[2:27] and
[2:29] he sits on the throne his son of david
[2:30] you and i are there just on a honeymoon
[2:32] we have no connection the son of david
[2:35] he's already our all in all
[2:38] but there's a group of people that's
[2:40] having to come through a developmental
[2:42] stage
[2:43] just like the earth the earth brother
[2:45] branham said the earth was formed
[2:49] it was void
[2:50] then light came
[2:52] god created the world and he stopped
[2:55] but then what happened sin happened in
[2:57] the garden
[2:59] it threw the earth off started throwing
[3:02] the earth off
[3:03] then when you got to knowing the flood
[3:05] it really tilted the earth and it hadn't
[3:07] been right ever since all right so as
[3:09] the earth is trying to get itself
[3:11] straightened back up
[3:12] god is straightening a group of people
[3:14] redemption remember what i said it's
[3:16] it's not taking this pin people say oh
[3:18] you take this pin and drop it pick it
[3:20] back up that's redemption
[3:22] to a degree that's right
[3:24] but if i drop if i hold this pin here
[3:26] and i drop it
[3:28] and then i pick it up and hold it here
[3:30] that's not for redemption that's a
[3:32] process i've still got to bring it back
[3:34] up to the exact place where
[3:36] god saw it in his mind if you if you'll
[3:38] think about that
[3:40] in what god saw you and i before the
[3:42] foundation of the world that's what he's
[3:43] going to bring us back to at this point
[3:44] right here not this point but there has
[3:47] to be a process reach down
[3:49] pick up and bring it up through a
[3:51] process to bring it to right here
[3:55] that's god's way of doing things right
[3:57] so in the flood what happened in the
[3:59] flood
[4:02] earth tilted
[4:04] but brother brown said god washed it
[4:05] with water
[4:07] justified it
[4:08] wiped all the sin off of it remember he
[4:10] said that man evil has been continually
[4:13] in in man's mind they just continually
[4:15] were evil
[4:16] so what god's doing is he's starting to
[4:19] bring it back up he sanctified him when
[4:21] jesus christ came shed his blood on the
[4:24] earth cleansed and claimed the earth
[4:27] all right and then in the millennium i
[4:28] believe it's going to all come right
[4:30] back
[4:31] to this
[4:32] all right
[4:32] because that's
[4:34] restoration but it's still going to have
[4:36] sin
[4:38] as far as spirits or our souls that are
[4:41] going to have to be dealt with and evil
[4:43] spirits
[4:44] so even though it's in it's coming up in
[4:46] its rightful condition it's not in its
[4:48] total perfect condition until this thing
[4:50] right here comes down onto the earth the
[4:53] future home comes down on the earth that
[4:56] will make it brother brown said then a
[4:58] redeemed entire earth that's what he
[5:00] said in a future home
[5:02] that's why he didn't i don't believe he
[5:05] he preached
[5:06] one service
[5:08] on the millennium because the millennium
[5:10] is a process
[5:11] so they asked him brother brown could
[5:13] could children be born in the millennium
[5:14] he said it looks like it can looks like
[5:16] it can but seeing that future home when
[5:18] he brought that message to the future
[5:20] home down he brought it right down to
[5:22] where it was going to be
[5:23] the dimensions what it looked like and
[5:26] everything
[5:27] see he was positive that that was going
[5:29] to be
[5:31] the culmination of everything earth
[5:33] and man and nature all three all right
[5:36] now what's what's god doing god is
[5:39] bringing man back first
[5:40] because he's the one that fell
[5:42] all right then he's going to restore
[5:44] nature because in romans 8
[5:47] it says the whole world is groaning and
[5:48] waiting now
[5:50] the creation and groaning and waiting on
[5:52] who man to come back first to redemption
[5:55] then he's then the
[5:57] nature's going to follow
[5:59] because we're going to read it right
[6:00] here what's going to happen
[6:03] isaiah 65
[6:05] verse 21
[6:07] they shall build houses and inhabit them
[6:08] and they shall plant vineyards and eat
[6:10] the fruit of them what's god doing he's
[6:12] he's he's cultivating the earth back
[6:14] again letting us have something still to
[6:16] do with it
[6:17] all right because he put man on he put
[6:19] man on earth to till the soil
[6:22] before the fall
[6:24] right before the fall that's what the
[6:26] bible says before the fall he put man in
[6:28] in flesh
[6:29] to till the ground right
[6:32] so we're going to do that again
[6:35] they shall not build in another inhabit
[6:36] not shall plant in another eat
[6:39] for the days of the trees the days of my
[6:40] people and my elect shall long enjoy the
[6:42] work of their hands
[6:44] my elect shall enjoy the work of their
[6:46] hands
[6:47] we're not going to get callouses
[6:50] i wouldn't say why wouldn't get dirt on
[6:51] our hands
[6:53] that washes off okay we're in glorified
[6:55] bodies it's not going to matter to us
[6:57] they shall not labor in vain or bring
[6:59] forth for trouble for they are the seed
[7:01] of the blessed of the lord and their
[7:02] offspring with them and it shall come to
[7:04] pass that before they call our answer
[7:07] and while they yet speak i will hear
[7:10] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[7:11] together and the lion shall eat straw
[7:13] like the bullock now what he's talking
[7:14] about
[7:15] the earth's being restored back to an
[7:17] eating condition
[7:18] but it's not a total eating condition
[7:20] because even in the garden of eden the
[7:21] devil was there right
[7:23] walking around
[7:26] in spirit form
[7:27] not in the beast yet because remember he
[7:29] come into the beast later he incarnated
[7:31] the beast and then talked to eve but the
[7:33] devil was standing right there when all
[7:34] this was being created he was
[7:36] formulating his little plan
[7:39] the wolf and the lamb should feed
[7:40] together and the lion shall eat straw
[7:41] like the book thus shall be the
[7:43] serpent's meat they shall not hurt or
[7:44] destroy all my holy mountain
[7:46] saith the lord all right
[7:49] so now
[7:50] and then the bible talks about beating
[7:52] their uh swords in the plow in the plow
[7:54] stops
[7:56] that is in the millennium the prophet
[7:57] said so in the millennium
[8:00] we are going to
[8:05] black build houses
[8:20] all right but what's gonna happen over
[8:22] here
[8:25] let's go to revelation
[8:31] 20
[8:37] 1.
[8:40] and what happens in revelations 21
[8:45] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[8:47] for the first heaven and the first earth
[8:50] were passed away and there were no more
[8:51] seed all right everybody understand that
[8:54] the new heaven and earth doesn't mean
[8:55] he's going to annihilate it what's he
[8:57] doing he has
[8:58] um
[8:59] during the millennium
[9:01] or before the millennium man is going to
[9:04] destroy the world he always does
[9:06] but the second fire that falls is the
[9:08] holy ghost and fire that burns
[9:10] everything out of you you receive the
[9:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[9:13] uh say
[9:14] 10 years ago
[9:16] but what's he doing now he's taking the
[9:18] fire and he's burning the droughts out
[9:20] he's burning he's burning these things
[9:22] into you right he's burning virtue he's
[9:25] burning knowledge temperatures guys
[9:26] brother kindness
[9:28] all right what's he doing though he's
[9:29] actually burning you so that those
[9:31] things can come in
[9:33] because we still have the ability to
[9:35] shut those doors
[9:37] you can be a born-again christian and
[9:39] never have
[9:40] knowledge like in a pyramid
[9:43] okay but you're gonna die
[9:45] you're gonna go by the grave
[9:47] you're not gonna you're not going to
[9:49] take a body change
[9:51] all right
[9:54] but does god give us enough word to do
[9:56] it that's right does god give us enough
[9:58] preachers to do it yeah yeah and you
[10:00] don't do it whose problem is it right
[10:02] your problem that's right that's why i
[10:03] was preaching last sunday
[10:05] now there's something it's unconditional
[10:07] god saves you unconditionally by faith
[10:10] but this right here all the way up
[10:12] through to love is your condition
[10:15] it you do have something to do with it
[10:17] in that sense right
[10:18] you do have something to do with
[10:20] shutting the door and not letting god in
[10:22] right right
[10:24] not in your heart is being in your soul
[10:26] but brother brandon preached the message
[10:27] doors and doors
[10:29] one door you open to let christ in
[10:32] but if i let you in my house and you go
[10:34] down my hallway there's
[10:36] three doors down my hallway if i don't
[10:39] want you in josh's old room i pull the
[10:41] door shut right
[10:43] because i know there might be something
[10:44] in there you don't want to see but
[10:46] you're still in the house
[10:48] right you're still living there you're
[10:50] still coming in you know you understand
[10:51] what i'm saying you're still eating
[10:53] you're still doing like brother gerald
[10:54] this don't do away with nothing he
[10:56] preached last night with the kitchen the
[10:59] living room in the bedroom
[11:01] but there's not there's there is just a
[11:02] three-room house but
[11:04] even in the spiritual even in the
[11:06] natural you don't have a house that just
[11:07] has a kitchen mom and daddy used to live
[11:10] in one when i was born and just had a
[11:11] kitchen living room and a bedroom
[11:13] but there's more than three rooms in
[11:14] your natural home so there's more than
[11:16] three rooms in that spiritual part of
[11:18] your heart which is open the door for
[11:20] virtue knowledge temperatures godly
[11:22] brother and kindness and all that so you
[11:24] do have something to do with it when it
[11:25] comes to
[11:26] that abraham had an unconditional
[11:29] covenant god said i'm going to save you
[11:31] because you believed in me
[11:33] all right and then abraham went through
[11:36] a journey but he never went through the
[11:38] journey of a statue of perfect man that
[11:39] was given for you and i because the the
[11:42] the teachers inside to do it
[11:44] but like i said before and it's really
[11:47] hit home here recently
[11:49] how that you can grieve the holy spirit
[11:52] be born again we must just born again as
[11:54] as god is right you can grieve that holy
[11:57] spirit away you cannot come to church
[11:59] you can do you know do the things of the
[12:01] world i'm not talking about do the
[12:02] things of the world like you used to
[12:04] let me don't get me wrong if you were
[12:06] smoking you didn't go back smoking again
[12:08] all right that should be dead but it but
[12:10] like brother gerald was saying
[12:12] fellowship leads to relationship that's
[12:15] right okay
[12:16] fellowship you got to start learning how
[12:18] to have fellowship with god all right
[12:20] don't always have fellowship with god
[12:22] still the word that's right but you can
[12:24] you can have you can be born again and
[12:27] and like i said not have knowledge or
[12:29] temperance or patience some people are
[12:30] not going to get rid of it so they're
[12:31] going to go by the grave right
[12:33] okay
[12:34] so you can you grieve it away but now
[12:36] that doesn't mean you
[12:37] lose it right
[12:39] that just means god can't use you like
[12:40] he wants to
[12:42] and you're gonna be you know the reason
[12:43] how you're gonna be held accountable
[12:44] you're gonna have to die that's right
[12:48] you're gonna have to die and go by the
[12:49] grave
[12:50] there's no way you can stay alive
[12:53] and remain to the coming of the lord and
[12:55] not have all those virtues working in
[12:56] your life
[12:58] if not then you've got to go by the
[13:00] grave that's just the way it is
[13:03] all right let's see why don't come
[13:08] no they don't come some come to 30 some
[13:11] come to 60 but there is a group promise
[13:13] to come to 100.
[13:16] the ones that come to 30 fold they're
[13:17] just as righteous as the hundredfold
[13:20] but
[13:21] there's a position here on this earth
[13:23] that you gotta reach
[13:25] a statue a mountain of a perfect man
[13:28] that has not been required in all the
[13:30] other ages unless it was this age
[13:32] because somebody's gonna make the
[13:33] hundredfold when he spoke hundredfold
[13:36] if he just said thirty see
[13:38] that's the continent thank you brother
[13:39] right that's the continuity of got it
[13:41] because remember it's 30 60 90.
[13:44] if you go in you're 30 60 90
[13:47] that's not 100. if he just hit 30 60 90
[13:50] nobody would have been able to take a
[13:52] body change right without death
[13:54] but he said some 30 some 60 some hundred
[13:58] so a hundred fold is the ones that go on
[14:00] the rapture without death
[14:03] but no shame to the ones that are dying
[14:04] now they you know god sees you come to
[14:06] one place and
[14:08] and um
[14:10] and we don't worry about things like
[14:12] that
[14:13] right
[14:15] we think pearl's sister irene
[14:17] um wilson but she's had a lot better
[14:20] time we are right now
[14:21] uh brother hugh wilson's wife that died
[14:23] a while ago she's she's having a better
[14:26] time than we are we don't we gotta get
[14:27] him to go to work tomorrow and pay the
[14:29] bills and
[14:30] all she got to do is sit there and wait
[14:31] on us
[14:33] talk to god talk to brother brown talk
[14:34] to all the people in that dimension
[14:37] rotate him i'll guarantee you he looked
[14:39] at william branham the first man he
[14:40] looked for when he went across that
[14:42] curtain of time well his wife i believe
[14:44] she went and got him i believe she's the
[14:46] one to come got him at the river and
[14:47] took him
[14:48] you know because she died first brother
[14:49] brown said he'll send somebody
[14:52] to the river to get you that you know
[14:54] that'll lead you across that river all
[14:56] right
[14:57] from from natural to supernatural it's
[14:59] not a river people it's not a running
[15:01] water it's just it's just a crossing
[15:03] over
[15:04] from one dimension to another dimension
[15:07] and sister tatum walked over there and
[15:08] just brought him right over and said hey
[15:10] here's brother branham and i don't
[15:11] guarantee you
[15:13] he was shocked yes
[15:17] all right let's finish
[15:18] and i saw in you heaven and your earth
[15:21] chapter 21 verse one
[15:23] for the first heaven and the first earth
[15:25] will pass away
[15:26] and there were no more sea
[15:29] see that's what happened that's what
[15:30] happens at death
[15:33] the first earth one your mom and daddy
[15:35] gave you passed away but everybody
[15:37] thinks well it's going to pass away
[15:38] means it's going to go back to the dirt
[15:39] and you god's going to give you a new
[15:40] one
[15:41] did god destroy did god destroy the
[15:43] earth
[15:45] he destroyed the outside of it
[15:47] changed it
[15:50] didn't didn't blow it up because in our
[15:52] old ideas we thought well
[15:55] we're going to go live in heaven and
[15:56] this earth's just going to be
[15:57] annihilated because that's what the
[15:58] bible said
[15:59] earth's going to pass away but i
[16:01] recognized that 40 with 40 40 somewhere
[16:04] in there
[16:06] i created and brother gerald um
[16:09] said it yesterday
[16:10] i created this world to be inhabited
[16:12] that's the eternal word of god it cannot
[16:14] go past that right if he said i made it
[16:17] to be inhabited and god said it that
[16:19] makes it eternal there's nothing there's
[16:21] nothing god can't go against his word so
[16:23] he made that earth to be inhabited
[16:26] now it's going to be cleaned off
[16:28] and i john saw the holy city
[16:30] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[16:32] of heaven now that's not this city right
[16:34] here
[16:37] because remember when we come back in
[16:38] the millennium we build houses and
[16:40] gardens and all that down here
[16:44] got it
[16:45] john right here sees a new city coming
[16:48] down from god out of heaven
[16:52] prepared
[16:54] where
[16:55] coming down from god out of heaven
[16:56] prepared
[16:57] as a bride adorned
[17:00] for her husband
[17:03] so where was he coming the city was
[17:05] coming
[17:06] to this earth right all right
[17:08] city was coming to this earth so this
[17:10] city
[17:12] is a heavenly city
[17:14] coming the earth coming to earth
[17:23] let me do
[17:25] one more thing
[17:29] this is temporary
[17:51] this is not even the one
[17:53] that abraham saw
[17:56] he didn't see a
[17:57] he said we have no continuing city
[18:00] but we look for one whose builder and
[18:02] maker is god god made this one right
[18:05] here
[18:06] man is going to make this one
[18:08] that's why it's going to be it's going
[18:09] to be creative evolution just like god
[18:11] did when he started i don't believe in
[18:13] evolution like darwin did but i believe
[18:15] in creative evolution where god created
[18:17] one specie and then a higher species and
[18:19] a higher species and a heart species
[18:21] same thing with here we're going to take
[18:23] you say well how are we going to it
[18:24] don't matter how we're going to do it
[18:26] don't don't worry about where we're
[18:28] gonna get nails
[18:32] you miss this whole thing sitting there
[18:33] with your mind going way off over into
[18:35] space somewhere
[18:36] wondering what
[18:38] what's it gonna look like where are we
[18:40] gonna get glass
[18:43] i'm just dumb enough to believe
[18:45] that there was no glass
[18:47] in the garden of eden
[18:49] and somebody
[18:52] somebody
[18:53] took sand
[18:54] and fire
[18:57] and heated it hot enough and made glass
[18:59] out of it
[19:00] guess what we're going to have fire
[19:01] still here we're going to have sand
[19:03] still here and we're going to have
[19:04] people and we're going to have a
[19:06] thousand years you say that's not very
[19:07] long
[19:09] people this united states of america is
[19:12] less than 300 years old and look how far
[19:14] we've advanced from 300 300 years ago
[19:16] there wasn't nothing but indians and
[19:18] farmers in this land
[19:22] right
[19:23] look where we've come in just 300 years
[19:25] what we've built up out of this earth
[19:27] think about a thousand years that's
[19:28] right
[19:30] a thousand years man has come from
[19:32] from just barely out some way to print
[19:35] to put print on paper
[19:38] so now we can instantly through our
[19:42] cell phones and anything if you got a
[19:44] wireless printer
[19:47] and no sin
[19:49] and no sin
[19:54] right
[19:55] so you know
[19:57] i don't worry about what my house is
[19:59] going to look like i just worry about
[20:00] getting there that's right
[20:02] all right
[20:04] but if we're get if we get here this is
[20:06] the whole point i want to make if we get
[20:08] to the millennium
[20:13] you're guaranteed a free trip right here
[20:17] i've always said if you're born again
[20:19] today you'll have this city already in
[20:21] you right right
[20:23] your house
[20:24] your garden
[20:26] because brother randall said he made it
[20:27] according to your desire right
[20:30] okay
[20:32] but he made it according to your desire
[20:33] this is going to be built according to
[20:35] maybe our desire that we have on earth
[20:38] uh whether we build them with stone or
[20:39] brick or water doesn't matter to me that
[20:41] doesn't think a little trivial thing
[20:43] like that makes no difference to me at
[20:44] all
[20:46] because you know what
[20:50] god's got this all in his mind but god
[20:52] still got all this in his mind too he
[20:53] knows what we're gonna do he knows what
[20:55] we'll need right and he'll put it there
[20:58] if he knew what man needed naturally and
[21:00] put all the minerals and vitamins and
[21:03] everything in this earth that man would
[21:05] need a man could put it together and
[21:07] make an aspirin or make this or make
[21:09] that
[21:10] um guess what
[21:12] this is going to be a piece of cake
[21:13] right compared to how we're living on
[21:15] this earth right now okay
[21:17] because like brother donnie said our sin
[21:19] will be gone there'll still be sin
[21:21] around somewhere but it won't be any
[21:23] there won't be any greed or my house is
[21:26] bigger than yours or
[21:27] or you didn't help me make my barns i'm
[21:29] not going to milk you make you help your
[21:31] barn there's nothing be that right
[21:36] i just like to look at the natural
[21:39] you know remember what they used to do
[21:41] back in the old times they used to have
[21:43] a barn raisin
[21:47] you'd have a barn raisin and they almost
[21:49] help each other now anyway right now you
[21:51] say well i don't care if they're dead if
[21:54] they're ranked centers that doesn't make
[21:55] any difference to me but the type that
[21:57] they show
[21:59] that man
[22:00] goodness of man always comes out what
[22:02] i'm trying to say so
[22:04] take that times 10 billion
[22:07] times 10 billion the prophet said
[22:10] billions of billion and put that love in
[22:13] here
[22:14] and you see what the amish do for each
[22:16] other times all that is what we're going
[22:18] to do for each other in a millennium but
[22:20] now remember when we come to this future
[22:22] home there's no working involved
[22:26] god's already built it behold the
[22:28] tabernacle and heard a great voice out
[22:29] of heaven saying behold the tabernacle
[22:31] of god
[22:32] is with men
[22:35] all right
[22:36] and he will dwell with them and they
[22:38] shall be his people and god himself
[22:40] shall be with them
[22:42] and be their god
[22:43] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[22:45] their eyes and there shall be no more
[22:46] death no sorrow no crying neither shall
[22:49] there be any more pain for the former
[22:50] things
[22:51] are passed away
[22:53] and he that set up on the throne said
[22:54] behold i make all things new and he said
[22:56] unto me right for these words are true
[22:58] and faithful
[22:59] and he said unto me it is done i am
[23:01] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[23:02] end i will give unto him that is the
[23:04] thirst of the fount of the water of life
[23:06] freely
[23:06] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[23:08] things and i will be his god and he
[23:10] shall be my son
[23:12] then now you see what happens to all the
[23:14] others feel fearful unbelieving
[23:16] abominable
[23:19] murderers whoremongers sorcerers
[23:21] idolaters and all liars shall have their
[23:23] partner in the lake which burneth with
[23:25] fire and brimstone
[23:26] which is the second death which is going
[23:28] to happen right here at the white throne
[23:30] judgment
[23:31] he throws them over into the lake of
[23:32] fire all right
[23:35] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[23:36] a great high mountain
[23:38] showed me that great city the holy
[23:39] jerusalem descending out of heaven from
[23:41] god
[23:42] having the glory of god
[23:44] and her life was likened her
[23:48] her lot
[23:51] why did john see the city it was looked
[23:53] as the bride adorned her husband
[23:58] her light was like into a stone most
[24:00] precious even like jasper clears crystal
[24:03] it had a wall great and high and had 12
[24:04] gates and at the gates 12 angels
[24:07] and names written their own
[24:08] which are the names of the 12 tribes of
[24:10] the children of israel
[24:12] on the east three gates on the north
[24:14] three gate south three gates and on the
[24:16] westbrook gate and the wall of the city
[24:18] had 12 foundations and in them the name
[24:20] of the 12 apostles was the lamb
[24:22] so you got your apostles you got all
[24:24] those things coming in here now that
[24:27] that never was explained the bible
[24:29] doesn't explain
[24:31] a city and throne and walls except for
[24:34] the
[24:36] jews
[24:38] right because remember
[24:39] there's a millennium temple to be built
[24:41] here and it does have dimensions
[24:43] ezekiel
[24:44] 40-44 but this right here is built
[24:48] specifically for me and you
[24:50] everybody else is going to live outside
[24:52] that city whatever they do if they have
[24:53] to build their own house which i believe
[24:55] they will
[24:57] and all those things and have gardens
[24:59] they will but this eternal city that
[25:01] god's talking about right here
[25:04] is something that god made special for
[25:06] me and you
[25:07] and he's the only one that holds that in
[25:09] his bosom until
[25:11] where john saw everything was finished
[25:13] white throne's done sin has done away
[25:15] with
[25:16] and then an eternal city a mountain
[25:18] pushes up the prophet said 1500 miles
[25:21] square
[25:22] so it's at an incline
[25:24] 1500 mile square
[25:26] and then that city is going to sit down
[25:27] now what's going to sit down on top of
[25:29] that mountain
[25:31] you and i
[25:33] you and i are going to sit down because
[25:35] he saw that it was as the bride adorned
[25:37] for her husband
[25:38] so it's going to be us coming back
[25:40] after all this has been wiped over god's
[25:42] fire wipes everything off kills all the
[25:44] sin killed all the devils
[25:46] all the spirits that's floating around
[25:48] then that mountain's gonna push up
[25:51] and god's gonna set that city you and me
[25:53] are gonna come right back down and when
[25:55] we sit down it's all going to sit right
[25:57] in its place right
[25:59] that'll be eternal city see what the
[26:01] difference is now
[26:03] the difference is in the millennium
[26:05] the earth is being renewed being born
[26:08] again
[26:10] the earth is being born again right here
[26:13] because remember we're building things
[26:14] we're doing all that but once you go
[26:16] through all this
[26:17] this is not being born again this is
[26:24] all in all
[26:26] right here in verse three behold the
[26:28] tabernacle of god is with men and he
[26:29] will dwell with them and they shall be
[26:31] his people
[26:32] and god himself shall be with them
[26:35] and he be their god
[26:38] that's going to happen to us should have
[26:40] it's happening to us down here but see
[26:42] that's the process we go through it the
[26:43] bride goes through it first we're sealed
[26:45] in
[26:46] all right
[26:47] 144 000 gets sealed in and we come back
[26:50] in this millennium everybody else is
[26:52] dead
[26:53] all the dead live not for what a
[26:55] thousand years
[26:58] right the bible says in 19 of
[27:01] revelations i believe it is and the rest
[27:03] of the dead lived not for a thousand
[27:04] years so the millennium is going to be
[27:07] us and the jews and whatever the the
[27:10] heathen or whatever that's raised up
[27:12] you know that's between god and and and
[27:15] what he does and not us
[27:17] but we know one thing's for sure the
[27:19] foolish virgin and all sinners and
[27:20] everybody that is died and does not have
[27:23] the holy ghost in their soul
[27:25] are going to stay dead until this white
[27:28] throne judgment then the bible says the
[27:29] earth
[27:30] the sea
[27:31] everything gives up the dead right in
[27:33] other words everybody that's ever died
[27:36] is going to be alive at one point in
[27:38] time
[27:38] what's god doing
[27:40] he's bringing this thing back up
[27:43] getting rid of all the trash
[27:46] and then guess what's going to happen
[27:48] this is what he wanted
[27:51] to happen in the garden of eden
[27:53] this is a show of it
[27:55] kind of a preview you know you get a
[27:57] movie trailer
[27:59] you know you get about two minutes a
[28:00] little snippet of what's going to happen
[28:02] in the movie they'll show you a few
[28:03] action scenes a few love things a few of
[28:06] this that's what god's doing
[28:08] he's showing a few things he's showing
[28:10] himself a few few ways here but right
[28:12] here this is all in all right everything
[28:15] he's got is going to be poured out on
[28:17] this earth
[28:18] which is the bride
[28:20] then it'll be the bride the 144 thousand
[28:23] foolish virgin cup of water in my name
[28:26] babies that have we sometimes we forget
[28:28] about those babies that didn't make it
[28:29] to
[28:30] to um
[28:31] the age of accountability they're going
[28:33] to be in heaven they're going to have to
[28:34] be given eternal life because they never
[28:36] knew jesus christ but he died for their
[28:38] sin
[28:40] they'll be given eternal life
[28:42] all dad's going to be dead and all i was
[28:44] going to be live right here now right
[28:45] here you got a difference
[28:48] there's some dead
[28:49] some alive some of these are going to
[28:51] stay there you know they're going to
[28:52] come up but god's going to you know take
[28:54] care of them but there's some of these
[28:55] going to be come over into here so see
[28:57] that's why the millennium doesn't
[29:00] it's not everything
[29:02] everybody understand that because
[29:03] somebody that's down here that's dead in
[29:05] these dimensions somebody's going to get
[29:07] to
[29:09] live for
[29:10] eternity right here that's not the case
[29:13] right here that's the case
[29:15] they're going to get
[29:17] get eternal life imparted to them but
[29:19] this eternal city
[29:21] was made for you and i
[29:23] and next sunday i need to hook brother
[29:25] gerald up but next sunday we will uh
[29:29] kind of try to finish this up and then
[29:31] i'll
[29:32] then we won't be here the next sunday
[29:34] brother joe won't either and donny you
[29:36] won't either so we just may not have
[29:38] sunday school but on the uh
[29:42] first of august because most of us will
[29:44] be gone
[29:45] to the uh
[29:47] to the youth camp
[29:57] you
