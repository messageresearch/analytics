[0:01] all right good to be here good to be
[0:13] here this morning
[0:14] wanna make sure we pick up make sure
[0:19] that we are up and running
[0:23] Lord bless you good to be here in the
[0:25] house we're good to have all the room is
[0:27] just full of empty chairs so we've got
[0:34] everybody here today that didn't come
[0:43] with us so we're still doing the 10
[0:46] people and still doing the distant
[0:48] singing washing our hands so you just
[0:51] hang in there
[0:53] we're going to make it through this so
[0:56] they want to do some hard times in the
[0:59] church seems all the different church
[1:00] and dozens of Church ages and they got
[1:02] killed for what they believe we I got
[1:04] them that parts yet so world k at the
[1:07] moment we might have to do little I've
[1:12] been out walking mile two miles every
[1:14] day and every day in every Indian we
[1:16] kind of eat a little bit better so make
[1:19] out all then a whole lot out there but
[1:23] we're gonna start here I think we got
[1:24] down to like verse 4 and but we'll start
[1:28] again to the angel of the church in
[1:29] Sardis that's the third evening church
[1:31] age is the one two three four number
[1:36] five church age it was a time of of
[1:41] Martin Luther when he was protesting the
[1:44] Catholic Church so did people in this
[1:46] era our time our church age was
[1:49] persecuted for over a thousand years by
[1:51] the Catholic Church
[1:53] and you read foxes Book of Martyrs
[1:55] that's when all that happened
[1:57] Columbus time that things be Martin
[1:58] Luther's coming at the end of that age
[2:01] and he's bringing his message to the
[2:04] start easy in church but this is what
[2:07] God has to say to that church into the
[2:09] angel of the church in Sardis right
[2:10] because you got to remember that angel
[2:12] was Martin Luther so God was directing
[2:14] whatever he was saying he was saying
[2:17] through Martin Luther going through the
[2:20] angel of church in Sardis write these
[2:22] things saith he that hath the seven
[2:23] spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[2:25] melech Seven Fishes art seven starts
[2:28] with Roman Church ages I know thy works
[2:31] that thou has a name that they'll live
[2:33] us than our dead remember we talked
[2:35] about that last Sunday where the first
[2:40] three Church ages there wasn't a such
[2:42] thing as the father mode of baptism only
[2:44] in this Catholic age of the age of
[2:47] Columba did they develop they I mean the
[2:50] Catholic Church and then everybody
[2:51] accepted it that the Father Son Holy
[2:54] Ghost baptism was the correct method we
[2:56] know it's not you have a name that I'll
[2:59] live it than our dead and it wasn't even
[3:01] a name
[3:02] it was titles to a name but God winked
[3:05] at her Ignis because the book was not
[3:07] open the book that working under a
[3:09] closed book being watchful and
[3:12] strengthen the things which remain in
[3:14] other words Martin Luther was getting a
[3:16] remnant that was coming out of the
[3:18] Catholic Age Martin Luther was getting
[3:20] that group of people they still had a
[3:22] Catholic reign for a thousand years or
[3:24] more
[3:25] so the Catholicism in the brain or in
[3:29] the psyche of the people was that it was
[3:32] right so here comes Martin Luther who is
[3:35] a Protestant who protested that's where
[3:37] you get Protestant from protested the
[3:39] Catholic Church said be watchful and
[3:42] strengthen the things which remain so
[3:45] when Martin Luther comes on the scene
[3:46] God reveals to him that to just show
[3:49] them by faith not by penance not
[3:52] I know Binion not by the sign of the
[3:55] Cross of the Hail Mary for praying the
[3:57] dead Saints but it was what believe in
[4:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[4:05] strengthen the things which remain that
[4:08] are ready to die so that we're still in
[4:10] that church he's coming out at Turf days
[4:11] they were still persecuting the
[4:13] Christian where I have not found thy
[4:15] works perfect before God now this is the
[4:18] church so they will do work they were
[4:20] not in a perfect sense but in God's eyes
[4:25] that were perfect for their time their
[4:28] makeup that they were perfect for their
[4:30] time because the just shall live by
[4:32] faith that's what put them in the body
[4:34] of Christ with you and now that's not
[4:36] all included it's part of it but at this
[4:40] point in time I have not found thy works
[4:43] perfect before God remember therefore
[4:46] how thou has received and heard and hold
[4:49] fast and repent in other words you're
[4:51] fixing to hear a message from this man
[4:53] called Martin Luther and he's going to
[4:55] tell you some things that you haven't
[4:57] heard previously because the previous
[5:00] thousand years was we're on the Catholic
[5:02] Church decided and holiness independence
[5:04] and now he's fixing to tell you
[5:06] something from God to repent from that
[5:09] hold fast to it and repent if therefore
[5:12] thou shalt not watch I will come on thee
[5:14] as a thief and thou shalt not know what
[5:16] hour I will come upon thee telling the
[5:19] people look turn back to God get away
[5:22] from what you're doing
[5:25] he's not talking about coming this is
[5:28] not the coming to the Lord
[5:29] okay coming to the Lord was not the
[5:32] third Church at our fourth birthday all
[5:34] right but he's telling me to bring a
[5:37] message yeah okay I'm coming to bring a
[5:40] message and thou shalt not know what
[5:42] hour I will come upon thee thou hast a
[5:47] few names even in sardis which have not
[5:51] defiled their garments
[5:52] no where's Hilda this was the Dark Ages
[5:56] but look that was bride in that dark
[6:00] gate they weren't all it
[6:02] sure they would get a little bit but
[6:04] they would still bright they kept their
[6:06] garments white and that had lived
[6:09] through this turbulent time some had to
[6:12] give their life during that time but
[6:15] there was some that made it through and
[6:18] they show what was being white for they
[6:20] are worthy he's overcome saying shall be
[6:23] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[6:27] blot out his name out of the book of
[6:28] life but I will confess his name before
[6:30] my father and before his angels in other
[6:32] words it was such a horrible time they
[6:34] were coming out of God's promising the
[6:37] people if you'll live right to your
[6:38] messenger live correct by the Word of
[6:42] God through your messenger then you're
[6:45] gonna be robed in white I'll not forget
[6:46] you
[6:47] he's not gonna forget that church agent
[6:48] because he's not gonna forget this look
[6:50] for the church oh you just because they
[6:52] had all the Catholicism and all those
[6:54] things God still had his little bride in
[6:56] there somewhere all the way through all
[6:58] right mm-hmm
[7:00] and I will confess him confess his name
[7:02] before my father before example even
[7:04] happen here lady hear what the Spirit
[7:06] says to the churches so we know for sure
[7:09] that Martin Luther was the turkic
[7:11] messenger it was from 80 1520 to 1750 a
[7:18] couple of hundred years and there was a
[7:21] lot of times in there that that did look
[7:23] really good but now that was the
[7:28] beginning of restoration now remember
[7:32] you got to remember this
[7:33] it was Reformation because he was
[7:35] reforming the people not doing away with
[7:39] all the doctrines of the Catholic Church
[7:41] he was accepting Father Son Holy Ghost
[7:43] baptism he even accepted the Eucharist
[7:46] for a little while and he had a lot of
[7:49] things he brought out of the Catholic
[7:50] Church that he used in even in
[7:53] Lutheranism now you see the difference
[7:57] that you see it's emblems of the
[7:59] Catholic Church because the ritual they
[8:01] did he brought some of them with it so
[8:06] that means they weren't perfect they
[8:07] weren't all doing the right thing but
[8:10] they were doing one
[8:11] the time they were doing it in their
[8:13] break up that the Martin Luther was a
[8:16] mighty powerful trkage messenger a lot
[8:19] of things went on in its life that would
[8:21] you go through but we're going to
[8:22] continue on through I read a church a
[8:24] book and read Martin Luther he see what
[8:26] what God meant did Martin Luther because
[8:28] he protested the Catholic Church are
[8:31] that's why you see again that's where
[8:34] the Protestant message began you see
[8:38] that there was a group over here that
[8:40] protested the Catholic Church and they
[8:43] didn't sometimes they basically
[8:44] protested them but a lot of times even
[8:47] in close to like in the 1700 you'll read
[8:49] back in history where the King of
[8:52] England team James and different Kings a
[8:55] freaking King James Version about okay
[8:59] though Kings were some of them were
[9:01] totally Catholic but then you had King
[9:04] James and the different Kings Henry the
[9:08] eighth
[9:08] and all those different ones in history
[9:10] that you read in the history books
[9:12] because I remember we were at a
[9:13] Constantine back in in these we read
[9:15] when Constantine came and made all the
[9:17] took all the riches that he had he made
[9:20] churches out of them they took out this
[9:21] one they put it in this one you read
[9:23] that history because the history reads
[9:25] that Constantine was a good guy but we
[9:29] know brother Brown says he he used it
[9:32] for his own political gain and he he put
[9:34] church and state together like they have
[9:36] a Jezebel did and that didn't work out
[9:38] very well so but he was one of their
[9:42] Crusades
[9:42] they put crosses on their shirt and they
[9:44] went to kill him if you didn't believe
[9:46] in the Catholic Church on this end
[9:47] coming up you didn't believe in the new
[9:50] part coming to got the Turk
[9:52] then you were killed so now you were
[9:55] coming out of that age of the physical
[9:57] killing in turn now a spiritual killing
[10:01] which you got you you got your white
[10:04] horse here red horse and black horse in
[10:08] these two church pages because the
[10:10] blackness was not the physical killing
[10:13] this was Ben
[10:14] kill him down here going into the safe
[10:16] but then the spiritual killing is where
[10:19] it all came from because well hapless
[10:22] Catholic state tattling Protestants yeah
[10:23] sure God used him for a time but God you
[10:26] can see in a minute God moved on to this
[10:28] next trkage in this next church a
[10:30] messenger and a lot of people said oh
[10:32] we're Lutheran's we're standing right
[10:34] here well then God moved away from them
[10:36] they became part of the Protestant move
[10:39] but they were reformers not restorations
[10:43] but it was a start of restoration
[10:46] because remember the corn of wheat went
[10:48] the ground died he'd come up stay dead
[10:53] they put in the ground a new you can see
[10:56] it from here a bit but when you come
[10:58] back to Martin Luther it's like the seed
[11:00] went back in the ground it stayed there
[11:01] for a thousand years research a book
[11:03] stayed there for a long time but all of
[11:05] a sudden the sunlight started shining on
[11:08] a new message of protest to protest the
[11:11] Catholic Church that all these things
[11:13] were wrong but now remember to you got
[11:16] to remember the reason it's not total
[11:18] restoration my brother around come to
[11:21] restore is that when Martin Luther come
[11:25] out he brought the father son Holy Ghost
[11:26] baptism with him he brought the
[11:28] Trinitarian doctrine with him he brought
[11:30] different things that the Catholic
[11:32] Church came up with gun didn't cut
[11:36] didn't come up with these things the
[11:37] Catholic Church did but getting there
[11:39] was some things that started a
[11:41] restoration because he should know when
[11:43] I'm praying did thinks anymore
[11:44] we don't have to flaunt ourselves and
[11:46] walk down the street with our knees to
[11:49] try to do penance he left some of those
[11:51] things and came out why the Bible says
[11:53] come out over my people when he came out
[11:55] but what he does he brought some living
[11:57] same way we're gonna talk about John
[11:59] Wesley he was part of restoration but he
[12:02] was under Reformation because he left a
[12:04] little bit of what Luther had Lutheran
[12:06] ISM not look there's pure message but he
[12:09] left some of that and said ok the just
[12:11] shall live by faith but you can't stand
[12:13] the pub and drink beer and smoke a pipe
[12:16] and talk about God anymore
[12:17] God has brought us to something
[12:18] different okay because you got to
[12:22] remember to in this sardian church age
[12:26] it's when ten Bell Wycliffe and all them
[12:29] started putting the model together so
[12:31] they were able and now with a big thing
[12:33] with King James and all the different
[12:35] teens the different Kings is like we
[12:37] can't understand they go to Mass and
[12:40] look at your history they're so good on
[12:42] the History Channel there's something
[12:43] you can see the underlying religious
[12:45] part being a being a spiritual person
[12:47] you can see how God's working even
[12:49] through those Kings to get the Catholic
[12:52] Church over here and the Protestant
[12:53] Church over here to protest because
[12:56] because one of the Kings I think it was
[12:57] King Henry he come down he says I'm the
[13:01] new leader of the church the Pope can be
[13:05] the leader of the Roman Catholic Church
[13:06] I'm gonna be the leader of the Church of
[13:09] England
[13:10] so buddy that started another little
[13:13] beauty war in itself but they were so
[13:17] strong they prevailed and you see them
[13:20] making their own Protestant churches to
[13:25] be against because that's what protest
[13:27] what do you do when you protest you're
[13:29] saying that ain't right and we've got a
[13:32] voice and we're saying that's not right
[13:33] so we're protesting that all right so
[13:36] that's where the Protestants came from
[13:39] but it wasn't a fool like I said
[13:41] restoration because Martin Luther
[13:43] brought some of the bags with it and
[13:45] then John Wesley brought the same pretty
[13:48] much father son Holy Ghost Trinitarian
[13:50] all the different little dolphins but
[13:51] when we get over into our church age
[13:53] we're gonna say a full restoration of
[13:56] pushing all that back and we take the
[13:59] floor word of God which is just like it
[14:01] was in the first church age that's why
[14:02] you've got the Alpha and Omega bride
[14:05] being the same basically the same
[14:06] brighter plus we're plus they need to
[14:11] take the river right now resurrection
[14:12] interactor we take the resurrection in
[14:14] the Raptor we're plus our plus is the
[14:16] headstone
[14:17] nobody got there now our plus is the
[14:19] seals the the no eternal health because
[14:23] see that still came up
[14:24] cat litter little girl Leslie might have
[14:28] done away with purgatory but they still
[14:30] believe they wouldn't become Pam
[14:31] all right so but if when you see that
[14:34] you see the property god company says no
[14:36] that's that's got to stay back down but
[14:40] Luther brought someone with him Wesley
[14:41] brought someone with him even Pentecost
[14:43] brought son with them but when we see
[14:46] the full restoration of the word coming
[14:47] in the end time that's why God had to
[14:50] send a prophet at wedding he wasn't
[14:52] going to send a property just to say
[14:53] what William branham's the Prophet we're
[14:54] going when he believes him and he's
[14:57] right here balance is wrong you could
[15:00] say that but that's not really the way
[15:02] to approach it approach it in a way that
[15:05] look read revelations 3 there's
[15:10] something wrong with every Church 8 and
[15:12] the last one is totally wrong he's going
[15:16] to spew out his mouth God is standing on
[15:18] the outside of church when you get back
[15:19] in and he didn't say that here he's
[15:23] saying okay I got a little bit against
[15:25] you but I'm gonna take a group of you
[15:27] out I love you but there's something I
[15:31] don't love about you it's like we're
[15:33] gonna say the same thing here but you
[15:34] got to hear what the Spirit says to the
[15:36] churches
[15:36] so Martin Luther had a baptism the Holy
[15:38] Ghost many many many many many many
[15:42] people
[15:42] dr. baptism the Holy Ghost under
[15:44] Luther's message of their just shall
[15:46] live by faith come out of that kind of a
[15:47] church showed God that his words race
[15:53] and show God yeah well he show it down
[15:55] here that we look at that to just show
[15:57] that my faith with Martin Luther it was
[16:00] the seed word for the time because that
[16:02] Steve had went the ground and died
[16:04] couldn't abide alone it had to come back
[16:08] up we wanted to come back up into to
[16:10] shoot Robert explains as many hundreds
[16:12] of time it comes up into two shoes now
[16:15] hmm we're fixing to plant stuff out here
[16:19] now
[16:19] in the spring you put the seed in the
[16:22] ground it warms it bursts and get the
[16:24] moisture it bursts open and it puts up
[16:26] what I don't care if you plant corn
[16:29] beans or whatever most of the time it's
[16:33] either one little shoot or two some
[16:35] dense two suits come up just like this
[16:37] now that's very important couldn't you
[16:39] say oh I got corn I got corn less
[16:40] harvested you will not get anything but
[16:46] two greens you three green shoots of
[16:49] grits you that's all you're gonna get go
[16:54] ahead
[16:54] but there's life and that the life of
[16:56] the seed is in that but it's been it's
[16:59] been held inside the to shoot so then
[17:02] when Martin Luther's message Martha's
[17:05] message never died there's no message
[17:07] ever died the messenger died one way but
[17:10] parts of his message moved on through
[17:12] John Wesley and then there's the stock
[17:16] comes up look you gotta help you know
[17:19] this was okay but it can be kind of
[17:21] tossed in the wind and you can almost
[17:23] trampled it over you see how window but
[17:25] now when that's shooting the middle of a
[17:27] piece of corn it's a big old stock right
[17:30] it comes out of that middle in a big
[17:32] stock and it leaves these down here how
[17:35] the life was in this but all of a sudden
[17:37] now the life is going to come out into
[17:39] that stop these are gonna die put them
[17:43] in the ground die looters people looters
[17:48] in the ground they die physically died
[17:51] not spiritually dying they physically
[17:52] died had to like them but that life has
[17:55] moved into the what the Church of
[17:59] Philadelphia which is a little more
[18:02] closer you just got to see this
[18:08] in chemistry all you see is cells and
[18:11] photosynthesis going on in and and green
[18:15] and but inside there somewhere is the
[18:18] light that's going to make that little
[18:20] PCC you just can't find them that you
[18:24] you take when I planted my of course
[18:28] they were already big but some way or
[18:30] somebody had to put one one little seed
[18:33] had to go in that ground if first opened
[18:35] up may have tree about this tall I've
[18:37] planted it and now I get hundreds of out
[18:40] without put one seed that was in one
[18:42] Apple that came off of another dream so
[18:46] where's the life the life in the sea the
[18:49] life goes up through the trunk the life
[18:52] goes up through the trunk but then what
[18:55] happens when the corn eat now we harvest
[18:57] corn to eat when it's wet we say wet
[19:01] because you put it for corn on the
[19:03] column things like that but now in
[19:05] Illinois we're hunting that they have to
[19:08] wait a little the market content in that
[19:11] seed is the less coming that is less
[19:13] than 10% so it's almost dry because what
[19:16] will happen with their process is then
[19:18] that don't the stock dies first
[19:21] you see it just as brown they said man
[19:23] they get this but you see the old farmer
[19:25] not an old farmer but he goes out there
[19:27] and he pulls the ear back pull the grain
[19:29] out and does some little process to it
[19:32] to see how much moisture contents in it
[19:33] if there's too much moisture content if
[19:37] they harvest it and put it in a grain
[19:38] bin you're gonna have out probably you
[19:41] have a corn sweet if everybody knows
[19:44] what that is on the south you're gonna
[19:45] have a wildlife in liquor why because it
[19:48] ferments we don't want that permit he
[19:50] doesn't want to firm it so he wants that
[19:52] tank completely look like it's dead but
[19:55] let me tell you something though there's
[19:57] life in that scene whether we look at it
[20:00] like now when we look like man word
[20:02] there's a hammer there's life in that
[20:04] seat where and then he'll put it in the
[20:07] bin and guess what if this is a heirloom
[20:08] seed if it's not that GMO junk they're
[20:10] doing there but if it's an heirloom seed
[20:12] you can take that seed that came off of
[20:14] that corn cob
[20:15] take that seed next year he'll put
[20:18] hundreds of them in the ground and make
[20:20] thousands of corn that's the way God
[20:23] does with spiritual multiplication in
[20:25] the same way does with when he started
[20:28] with one seed Martin Luther comes up
[20:30] shoot that was very important don't do
[20:33] away with it you can't go from seed to
[20:36] seed there's a process you guys have
[20:40] what green shoots then you gotta have a
[20:43] stop and then the life comes out of that
[20:45] God moved on to the Philadelphia Church
[20:48] they put through the good great powerful
[20:49] church not just to just shall live by
[20:52] faith but let's get Saints and petition
[20:54] right let's not smoke drink cuz let's
[20:57] live a clean life john wesley says clean
[21:00] life but that's still he still brought a
[21:03] lot of that old stuff with it right
[21:06] because he wasn't Steve but inside there
[21:09] is every cornstalk this every time sorry
[21:11] every courtier is inside that stock
[21:14] actually Elkhorn stop that record one
[21:16] day in Institute so the line has to move
[21:19] through all that to get to you and I
[21:22] which is the seed grain it's got to go
[21:26] back to seed again but where is the
[21:28] original seed but black brother Brown
[21:34] said you potentially help an arrow
[21:37] Corning come if you cut that down you'll
[21:39] never have another elysee say that's
[21:41] what he wants to do one cut it down
[21:43] no doctors boomed over and sit all I
[21:45] meant stop I'm gonna make John Wesley
[21:48] come out of this I'm gonna fill him with
[21:50] the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna run that
[21:51] life all the way up that stop I'm gonna
[21:53] make some more leaves up here because
[21:55] they put they got to be able to praise
[21:57] the Lord and get sunlight into that make
[21:59] it green photosynthesis to put it down
[22:01] into the ground roots and all the other
[22:03] things working together that's why you
[22:05] can't cut any of these turf changes out
[22:07] and you you hear people sometimes will
[22:09] be little Church ages no there's the
[22:11] life of God started when he went McGrath
[22:14] when Christ went in the ground died he
[22:18] said if it stays there buys along but if
[22:20] it what it becomes 4 which is
[22:21] resurrecting this is Palm Sunday
[22:23] resurrection next week he resurrected so
[22:27] that what so that you and I steve's
[22:29] could be planted in the
[22:31] ground of our hard enough the ground of
[22:33] our Monday because the spoken word is
[22:35] original see what's inside is what works
[22:38] this outside guy is too it's just like
[22:41] all humanity but the inside guys what
[22:43] makes a difference but there's the seed
[22:45] word back again inside of you so that
[22:48] when brother they'll preach it brother
[22:49] Brown preaches any minister preaches and
[22:52] you receive you're receiving the pure
[22:54] seed word you're not you know receiving
[22:56] stops anymore you might mean you first
[22:59] start cuz everybody's journey just like
[23:01] we were coming up a broom if you'll
[23:04] notice in Athens time when he first
[23:06] started in this journey under
[23:08] justification has a tight he made a lot
[23:11] of mistakes he didn't love because he
[23:12] what he didn't know he knew that God
[23:14] give him a promise and he knew that that
[23:16] promise would come to pass but he didn't
[23:19] know how God didn't tell him at first he
[23:22] saw you at ninety nine years old are
[23:25] going to have a baby with samurai which
[23:29] now will be Sarah
[23:30] he didn't give him all that information
[23:32] he didn't need that you don't need all
[23:34] this information to begin with you just
[23:36] need to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:37] and thou shalt be saved a man and when
[23:42] you do when you receive the life of God
[23:44] he comes out with two suits coming out
[23:46] now not born again but the tissues is
[23:48] part of it which is justification like
[23:52] we said in church a ceased he let me sit
[23:54] thou hast a few names which have not
[23:57] defiled the garment
[23:58] remember that for that one time
[24:00] receiving hurt and hold fast and repent
[24:02] what's the first thing you do when you
[24:04] in justification you repent of your sin
[24:07] okay that's that's justification under
[24:10] Martin Luther justification the to shoot
[24:12] you don't really you know see you don't
[24:16] really see the stop yet or you don't
[24:19] really Steve that ear of corn yet but
[24:22] you got it right there the life that's
[24:24] gonna make it is right here so the wife
[24:26] is gonna make you from Abraham's a
[24:28] neighbor
[24:29] is already there if you're truly
[24:31] justified and you didn't justify
[24:33] yourself that's what we've been talking
[24:34] about stairs but if you continue on then
[24:39] we come in to to the angel of the church
[24:42] in Philadelphia right now now think
[24:44] about it let's remember let me get this
[24:49] point straight Martin Luther had the
[24:52] same new birth you got not different now
[24:56] the word he had to work with was
[25:00] different than what you have today
[25:02] because under justification to just show
[25:05] them my faith that's what God for that
[25:07] time said I'm gonna click on that it's
[25:11] like I said about this you know you look
[25:12] at brother's back I want to see if those
[25:14] that right now well that's all Luther
[25:16] could see but now that doesn't do away
[25:19] with the whole world but all I see right
[25:23] now is going back him God said ham I'm
[25:25] happy with that because you see me dot
[25:27] you see me but then Wesley God just open
[25:31] up one more he's not that's for people
[25:33] sitting in here would even Sam when he
[25:35] hit this right here Martin Luther did
[25:36] but when you come to John Wesley he
[25:38] opened his eyes a little bit more for
[25:40] the word because if they would read it
[25:42] number one because that was a problem
[25:44] with a lot of the kings had with the
[25:46] Catholic Church
[25:47] I missed that point a minute ago what
[25:48] happened was is they were glad they
[25:50] didn't speak Latin so they go to these
[25:54] masses and they were doing all dirty and
[25:56] pardon the expression but you know
[25:59] saying this in a foreign language and
[26:02] the King for life what did you say what
[26:05] I mean God is supposed to talk to us you
[26:08] know the Catholic Church is what we're
[26:09] yeah we're God's represented you do what
[26:11] we say and some of the Kings were like
[26:14] nah man my common people thank God for
[26:18] some of them I know it's
[26:19] rotten but someone really good thank God
[26:21] for some of the Kings that said no I
[26:23] don't want people to be able to read
[26:25] this Bible that you say you've got in
[26:28] this Latin ballgame you sitting there
[26:30] you yelling yawn yawn yawn yawn the
[26:31] whole service hey listen
[26:33] nobody thought anything of it yeah you
[26:35] were just doing doing works but then
[26:40] King James and all the different King
[26:41] says no I will select a print that will
[26:44] see the Catholic Church then said no
[26:45] that's when that thing separated when
[26:47] the Catholic Church says no this is the
[26:49] way it is remember even the Catholic
[26:50] told brother Brown city well God's give
[26:54] us the church we can rewrite the Bible
[26:58] or do whatever we wanted to programs
[26:59] like no you know that's not what she's
[27:03] going to be doing so anyway so that's
[27:05] where the separation is let's read this
[27:07] we just sent in we'll build from because
[27:09] the angel the Church of Philadelphia
[27:09] write these things says he that is holy
[27:13] he that is true sees coming more from
[27:15] justification and sanctification coal
[27:17] with its truth he the have two keys of
[27:20] day that you can open no man shutteth
[27:22] and shutteth no man open we're getting
[27:24] ready to see a missionary age regards
[27:26] going to send them a seed out all over
[27:27] the world I know that works behold I
[27:29] have set before thee an open door and no
[27:32] man can shut it for thou that's a little
[27:34] strength what a little strength what the
[27:36] stock now lives little strength and has
[27:39] kept my word and have not denied my name
[27:42] we'll stop right there let's go play god
[27:44] bless you well at your service in just a
[27:47] minute
[27:52] [Music]
[27:58] [Applause]
