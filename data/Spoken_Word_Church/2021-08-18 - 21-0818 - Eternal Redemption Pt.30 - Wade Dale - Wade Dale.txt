holy holy holy holy holy i want to sing just want to make sure you're here hey man good to be in the house with lord good to have you never everyone here and look at these smiling faces yeah good well don't scare me like that hey man a couple of announcements and then we'll get started wonderful time everybody's all frustrated about the goings on to the world and we just keep going on listen we can't stop we got to keep moving there is no way that we're defeated there is no way that we don't win there is no scripture that says we lose amen every scripture i read says we've already won so we just got to come to that and i want to read you this quote that brother bob um sent me and the message why in 1961 now they won't have it but go ahead and pull it down the prophet of god says oh yes they got real men in there and they got some renegades too and don't holler at them because we got some others renegades that call themselves reverend that's exactly right so sauce for the goose is for the gander yes sir a man's got toxin and salt vaccine is for these little children and now polio i pray daily that god will send us something for cancer this is a prophet all right listen to this if we can't have faith let's get something else faith is the first let's take the next best if we can't get that now this is the prophet 1961. we still believe what he says right it's not one of these that we believe it because we want to and then we throw them out because we don't like it all right look at the world and the condition it's in poor suffering humanity help everybody you can everything that helps is of god let's help let's do everything we can and pray for men how many of you prayed more in the past month two months than you've ever prayed in your life if you hadn't then you're not a christian amen let's do everything we can to pray for men the things to do brother is get our arms together both medicine doctors hospitals nurses church and all together and put our faith in god and move forward that's what we need god's going to ask us why we didn't do it some of these days god's going to ask us well why didn't we do that but brother ryan says look faith is first but lest if you can't have that let's take the next best thing if you can't get to that so the question that that you know we're talking about and and you know you uh my blood pressure has been high still for the past week and you kind of feel bad and and you don't even have anything for it but you know what if i had a pill there i'd take it to feel better i do have faith you have faith but when you've got a headache i know we pray but when the headache keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger what do we do we take an aspirin right so i'm just telling you that that we need to just stand back and look at what's going on we do have faith we do have faith i believe every time i come up here to this pulpit that god's going to heal somebody spiritually or naturally either one i hope spiritually first but also naturally and we've seen it done a few times where the people would come up after service and they'd say hey i was you were preaching and i was praying and my back quit hurting or this quit hurting or that quit hurting and that's the way it should be the gentile way same thing in the world when i go to the doctor tomorrow i want y'all to pray that he finds what's going on because you know what i can't look inside my body and god give us this body to live in so i'm going tomorrow to see what's going on with this blood pressure that i've never had a problem with ever in my entire life ever had a problem with it so we'll like dad always says take the doctor's program but we're going to anoint it with oil and we're going to we're going to pray for that whatever we take the aspirin the blood pressure medicine anxiety whatever you take somebody everybody in this building takes something or has taken something okay so let's have faith you know brother branham said god gave the uh ability for jonah salt to get that vaccine so it could cure polio why didn't he just pray for everybody to get rid of polio because there's things in our body that we need to get rid of immunities that we need to build up so i'm not saying this for anything i just love that quote that brother bob found for us and um brother brown knows that we're human beings and if we had super duper faith we'd already be in the rapture amen but we got to carry it from the toothache though like you said we got a carrot from the toothache and carried on there's going to be a day when we're going to stand in eternity and i believe it's going to be made known to us what we didn't get how much we've messed with this world and i don't mean that you know mingled with the world all the whatever you want to say you get on your hands or you get on this or you get on that that god has protected you from he put an immunity in your body but he also gave you five senses to use that those five senses so let's use those five sentences and go from there but just pray for me tomorrow i'm gonna go to the my primary physician and see what uh see what's going on so you just pray i told them i've had every test except for a few and they've all turned out well so we're just praying that the lord will reveal to the doctor what's going on and and it will be that will be made whole so you just pray for me tomorrow at 11 o'clock and also brother aaron you will be preaching next wednesday which will be the 25th remember september the 25th we're going to have our youth service with brother andrew glover keep that in prayer and also some of you have said you can play we can go do putt-putt on saturday some said you can't go sunday i haven't had anybody say they couldn't go on saturday but i've had a few said they couldn't go on sunday afternoon so would saturday be okay if we tried to get it at like five o'clock or or so or six on saturday or earlier so we're gonna today we need to vote saturday or sunday saturday raise your hand sunday raise your hand we're going saturday popular vote sorry but we'll try to figure that out and figure out a date it will not be next saturday it'll be in the future so you can arrange a time to be off had you'd rather do it early in the day or later in the day early in the day like say 12 1 that's hottest day of the you know hot time brother direct's going no no so maybe six o'clock five o'clock because i think what we'll do is we'll we'll get some pizza or we'll eat later we'll do something to eat and then we'll play putt-putt for a couple hours that okay we'll do that on a saturday then all right well we'll figure that out and let you know um all of you that want to go all right and we'd like for everybody to to go so let's go to hebrews 9 11. and let's continue our thought i'm going to back up a little bit from sunday i kind of flew through if you noticed i was flying through because it was hot so we're going to back up just a little bit and i saw a few things that i want to bring a point in about the tribulation and then we'll we'll probably not get to the millennium until this weekend coming up because the millennia listen the millennium is a complex issue because there are scriptures that covers both the millennium and the future home but now some of them only covers the millennium only covers the future home they're separate because we're going to read we won't read tonight but remember in the millennium they will build and inhabit and not give it to somebody else now remember the future home is that's not the future home that future home is built for me and you already in another dimension and it's going to come into view and come down into heaven and from heaven to earth and it's going to be according to your desire so you're building it but you're not physically building it like you will do in the millennium now we will not in the millennium but the jews will everybody got that it is a jewish 1000 years it is not for the bride we're there on a honeymoon now think about that when you go on a honeymoon what do you do you rest you enjoy your your spouse you have a good time you you want to just settle down because you know the cares of life is going to hit you when you get to the end when you get to the end of it all right but now not that way when we get to the millennium then we see the future home coming so listen the millennium is not to me and you but it is important that we know what's there when we get there all right so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us i pray now lord for this journey forgive us our faults and mistakes and our ideas that are against you lord we pray for the ones that are sick lord the ones that have the that the seems like the kovid's coming back into some of the churches father i pray that you keep it away from this one lord we pray in the mighty name of jesus christ that you'll cover us lord by your blood you said you would you said whatever we ask believing that you would give to us lord so we are believing we're having faith lord that you'll take care of this little sanctuary that we have here of people that when we go out in the world truly we'll see i believe when we get to that future home it'll be told how many times that we were almost at death's door or something almost happened lord that saved our life and father by your providence we're here lord and as we're going to speak in a few minutes there's got to be an alive and remain on this earth to fulfill that scripture father and that means there is no death in that person father we pray that you just give us that revelation may it be a not be a mystery anymore the mystery will become history as the prophet of god said just bless us now give us revelation more than anything in the world we love you lord with all of our heart and we pray that we'll all continue up that mountain called the statue of a perfect man father just bless our pastor keep him strong give him strength give us all strength lord to make it through the times and the hours that we're living father we pray in jesus name amen just cover me tomorrow how many of you all had blood pressure problems man it ain't fun i i'm with you now i can now i can groan with you man and your face feels like it's about to fall off of course mine it could and it wouldn't bother anything but uh top of your head gets all hot and your arm starts hurting and devil because it's lie but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered and once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us let's read the lev revelations 11 3 and i give power unto my two witnesses they shall prophesy how long one thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth and then we know we'll we'll read the rest of it that happens we may be seated now we've been talking about i want to go back to this one thing go ahead and pull up matthew 16. this was really striking i was reading a commentary by scofield this week and this struck me because remember we've read the quote several times that brother brown said in the feast of the trumpets said he's been revealed to the church ages now to the church ages as the son of god is that right amen so let's read matthew 16 verse 15. i want you to see something that i bet you didn't know and i'm fixing to tell you he says unto them i'll get them before they fall asleep bob so you've got to get them you got to pale he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am now remember they said he was this he was a prophet he was a good man he was this he was that he said but i want to know what you think and peter spoke up and said thou art the christ the son of the living god now remember he asked who god the son of man am he answered to the son of god but listen watch and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven in other words simon peter tapped into something that he needed for a future event because he was getting ready to get the keys to the kingdom all right so now watch though and i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock now we we know what that rock is it's not peter it's not the church it's a revelation but watch and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it do you know that's the first time the word church is spoken in the bible it's spoken 145 times after that 144 but that's the first time and jesus is saying i will build my church on that revelation now we know that the revelation that we get is that that that is not his church is not out there his church is not a building his church is a body of believers called the bride but it took a prophet in the end time to come and tell us i don't call you church anymore i call you bride because you've come out of the church come out of her my people amen and but upon this rock i will build my church so listen now let's read the feast of the trumpets what did he build his church on not the revelation of the son of man he built that church on the revelation of the son of god that god the holy ghost was going to come back on the day of pentecost and was going to indwell a group of people they were going to go all over the world and preach the gospel the acceptable year of the lord you know in luke 4 there when he talks he says i have been anointed to do this and and preach the acceptable yield of the lord remember he stopped you know that's a comma that comma is me and you because in other words after that it says then bring judgment so see that goes all the way over to the tribulation that we're going to talk about here in just a minute but that little comma is me and you because he stopped because upon this rock i'll build my church the revelation of the son of god not the revelation of the son of man now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages that son of god god being a spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church age as in the congregation as the holy spirit among the people now most of them as even paul paul would say and i'll i'm not going to read it i'll paraphrase it paul says it's better to be absent from the body and present with god you know what he said but to fulfill it's the same paul that said we which are alive and remain you see what he's talking about he's got he really wants to be with the lord and i know we really want to be with the lord but somebody's got to press their way through this thing and not die to fulfill that scripture now some people are going to fulfill this one that it's better to be present in the body than absent with the lord right that's what he said but i had rather be present with the lord and absent from the body but he said it's expedient that i stay here he had to stay until his work was over then he could leave so through the church ages as the baptism of the holy ghost even from paul to now almost now people believe they got to die everybody is born to die this is kind of what i want to bring out we we talk about the son of man we're going to go back on the son of man but look at the son of man look at the difference the son of man though has already died buried resurrected himself it didn't take somebody to resurrect him he resurrected himself he said you destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days what man can say that no one could say that amen and then he came back on the day of pentecost as the baptism of the holy ghost but there was a peace there that was missing it had to be told in the end time because the son of god was where i will build my church or i will build my bride on the revelation of the son of god but right at the at the end time there's got to be a mystery paul said behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep now listen if you talk to any denomination uh we were talking about this today me and somebody oh me and brother russ was talking about on the phone every denomination talk to him talk to him and say hey man we're going to be alive when the rapture takes place and they'll go no we all got to die and we all got to go for judgment no you don't you might fulfill with that scripture but the fulfillment of the scripture i'm looking at is that we which are alive and remain the revelation of the son of man because he's already died been buried resurrected went to heaven has a glorified body and promised us that we would have one and paul caught the revelation and he wasn't there when jesus said i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it he wasn't there but he caught the revelation that that church was the bride of jesus christ and there would be in the end time we which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord so that's where me and you are at and just by and i don't want to do it you know you say well throw those scriptures out you can't throw them out they've all got a piece together but somebody's not going to die somebody's going to come to a place that death has been destroyed while you're standing in a body that your mom and daddy produced that's what this message is all about sure this message is going to bring us salvation and redemption but eternal redemption in our body spirit and soul is what this message is all about that's why this message is different than all the other messages you had a prophet stand one day and he said you're not all gonna die well paul died even the prophet that said it died but there's got to be a group of people fulfill that scripture it's got to be fulfilled you can't skip over it can't go around it you've got to sign somebody to fulfill it and i just contest that we are the ones that are going to do it luke 17 verse 24 for as a lightning that line us out of one part under heaven and shineth unto the other part so shall also the son of man be in his day who can who can tell me where lightning starts from oh it starts in a cloud give me the exact point can't give me the exact point that it lands cain it bounces everywhere that's the same way no one's going to understand this mystery of the son of man now look this is him this is the person like i said before so shall the son of man be in his day did they know who jesus was they're stood the son of man he was trying to tell him the whole time this is i'm the son of man the lightning was standing in front of them where it where it emanated from and where it came back to and they didn't see him well you know what same way with me and you even the christians of his day hated him because he said who he was they hated him because he said i'm the son of man they understood that he was a little bit different because remember they read ezekiel jeremiah all the ones lamentations prophesy son of man prophesy son of man not son of god son of man and we keep telling them i'm the son of man i'm the son of man that's come to save the world and they're like wait a minute where's this guy where did he come from and where is he going that was what i was trying to get back up a little bit that i kind of skipped over sunday so shall it be in the s when the son of man be in his day but now look we got to continue down because look but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of his generation we know that that was isaiah 53 he was what rejected of his own people who shall declare his generation well obviously the jews didn't we're declaring his generation because he had to put them away so verse 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall be also in the days of the son of man what were they doing they did eat they raise the donut please they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all it was a lawless generation that grew up without god the whole world is that not what's going on right now but god promised he wouldn't destroy it with water he's going to destroy it with atomic fire amen because he's not going to destroy it anymore by the flood because he said he wouldn't likewise also it was in the days of what now when the days of light see we come up now to our day we had a we had a a melchizedek god in human flesh went and talked to a prophet that familiar talked to a prophet we had two witnesses or two prophets minor prophets that went to sodom and gomorrah and blinded their eyes billy graham or roberts so see we're right here in this scripture all of us are likewise also it was in the days of what they did the same thing they eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it some of y'all's doing we've done that all most of them all of our life but the same day that lot went out of sodom it ran fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now said the coming of the son of man this is the revealing of the son of man amen there's a difference in his coming and his appearing listen he can be here and nobody know him but somebody that's got a revelation that's what i contend we are in the day of the son of man now and only a few people are going to get it and that's not negating that you don't have the holy ghost because that's the son of god revelation believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved you must be born again but then there's growth development there's something you got to do you got to continue on and continue on and then when we see the revealing of the son of man now who is it revealed to me and you it is not revealed to the world no one in the world will know just as the lightning went from here to there and just as he stood on earth declared who he was man there's something that that i'm going to bring and let some let you read where scofield now he's proven who the messiah is and he takes it all through scripture brings it all the way down and pinpoints right down he said it's got to come from judah yes right got to come from judah the lawgiver it's got to be born in bethlehem that's what the bible says god be born a virgin it just he said it just keeps now that funnel keeps narrowing down to only just a few people that was born in bethlehem during that time so here we are you don't have to prove it to us but it's like the jews you see how far they missed it they were reading those old testament scriptures that he would be born in bethlehem this would happen and this would happen and this would happen and there's the star and there's the wise men and they still said uh illegitimate child right well same thing they're saying me to you illegitimate children they just don't know what they don't fit over here and they don't fit over there they just i don't care you can call me whatever you want to as long as god calls me a child in his i don't care what the world calls him amen but so who's the son of man going to be revealed to a funneling a very small amount of people is going to get the true revelation of who this son of man is so now let's go to first corinthians 15. let's read this behold paul behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the last trump for the trumpet shall sound we know it's not a to do to do it's a message and the dead in christ shall rise be raised what incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality listen that is a promise that you're mortal you're corruptable sorry if you're going to be raised incorruptible you've got to have been corruptible at one time for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality right now look the other scripture that i took off was we which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord shall what shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep now the alive and remain and this mystery is not a mystery of who the son of god is the live and remain is not a mystery who the son of god is it's a mystery of who the son of man is and then the brother brown said the bride of jesus christ is the son of man in the end time as a collective body not one person amen am i all right with that because listen we're not virgin born so we're not the son of man these son of man had to be virgin born and that negates all of us all right so there you go you narrow it down again but by the transforming power of the lord jesus christ he called us the son of man in the end time through a prophet so let's start living it all right revelations 4 1 says look after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven first voice which i heard was elijah was a trumpet talking with me says come up hither now we're going to see this in a minute and i will show these things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now let's take to pull the chart back up just for a minute and we'll not get all this done tonight that's okay the ones you that keep this don't worry there's a bunch of pages but some of that will be for for sunday also so we got the church ages over with right the rapture is going to take place yep there you go church age is over with the revelation of the son of man has been made real to somebody it doesn't have to be but one person but somebody's got to be alive and call the dead saints from all these wow seven church ages call them all uh paul irenaeus martin all the different ones in the different church ages think about that you said it's impossible the bible says it's possible all things are possible to them that believe we've just got to start believing that you say well i'm just i just come in the message and i don't know nothing there's a lot of people been here not here but in the message 30 years and still don't know nothing i didn't say here i'm in the message and still don't know nothing you got to get born again look because look all born-again believers are going to go in the rapture no born again believer is going to get left here there's no left behind sorry world i like that song goodbye world right goodbye i stay not here i'm not going to stay here any longer so when we leave what's god going to do he's not he's got that comma he preached the acceptable year of the lord comma and then the day of vengeance it's going to start as soon as we leave there will be tribulation beginning on the earth is everybody all right with that so let's read now we're going to talk matthew now look this is a no go back again one more time sorry rapture we just revelations 4 1 we were caught up all right caught up in a rapture then the two prophets are going to come and preach three and a half years or 1260 days at 30 days to a month everybody got that three and a half years or 42 months you're going to see that word in just a few minutes now the millennium's not yet we're still in time time doesn't end time end for you when you got born again right that's right time shall be no longer but now remember we'll read in daniel where though they that they're given a time times and a dividing of times because the jewish the jewish age listen the gentile age as many tongues many nations get born again it's an individual affair with god but israel god has always dealt with israel as what a nation so he's going to deal with them in 12 tribes twelve thousand to a tribe and give them three and a half years to get saved because what did brother brahma always tell us the jews were god's timepiece okay watch the jews watch the timing of the jews watch their timepiece because these two prophets once 1260 days is over they know they're going to die because the bible says they're going to die all right look they don't get a promise of alive and remain because they turned god down as a nation long time ago but god's not going to forget the remnant that he's going to take out of that and we were talking uh last week being brother donnie i believe it was it's those orthodox jews there's jews in this world that do not care a thing about god never have and never will carry anything about god it's just that orthodox jew that sits there every day at the wailing wall and he tries his best to get the messiah on the earth but they're blinded and then when it's going to be lifted off there's only going to be 144 000 it's going to listen to those two witnesses and everybody else is going to do just like me and you get persecuted from within where does persecution come from your family usually it comes from your family amen what are you talking about boys i mean you just talked about that didn't we but really it is so what's going on because it's common it's common for us to be message believers but if brother donny gets the anointing of adoption he needs a gallon of gas in his car when it's wearing the persecution and he says lord i need a gallon of gas and a gallon of gas appears in his car or he said lord i'm hungry and a good old pork chop falls in his lap you think that's that's not strange that will happen but see you got me that's dilly-dallied around and comes to church half the time and does whatever we want to do in the world and then i think i'm bride and i'm gonna go lord why are you not he's gonna say what depart from me i never knew you i'm not gonna get the pork chop because i didn't come to the place that brother donny did so who's gonna be the maddest the neighbor out here or this guy that's standing right here right who's going to be the worst mad i'm in the message god why can't i get the same thing he gets then he's going to turn his persecution on you so you see what i mean i'm not saying that toward family i'm in the church family and i'm not saying y'all i'm just saying where does our biggest persecution come from though your neighbor don't care if you're a manifested son of god right he might at one time but he really don't care because he don't even know what a manifested son of god is if he's not a believer but when you've got a made believer and an unbeliever that thinks they're believers this is not my sermon but if you've got made believers and unbelievers and true believers who's going to persecute not the neighbor the mate believers and unbelievers they're going to persecute the true believers same thing with these two prophets they're not going to be killed by the jew that owns the diamond shop on the corner in jerusalem no they're going to be killed by the orthodox jew that has spent his life putting that temple back together and when those two witnesses stand in front of that temple and say god is not in that temple hadn't been in there for 2 000 years and will not be in that temple what are they going to do they're going to try to kill them two prophets they're going to try to kill the people that follow those two prophets so talk about tribulation yes it's going to be a tribulation for the whole world but then it's going to begin in the jewish community because i'll read it to you in a few minutes everybody all right say amen all right so matthew 24 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be it's the wrath of god and except those days should be shortened thank god there should no flesh be saved flesh be saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened what month are we in august wasn't in january just a couple weeks ago we're just getting over christmas christmas will be back here in just a few months how many of us have said time's fine well that's why god is allowing that for it to fly why would we be why would be here we go man it seems like this year's three or four years no it's we've never done that except when you were a kid right when you were a kid christmas came over three years if that felt like now it comes every three months to an adult right amen that's god god's providence giving us time and it seems short all right now let's go to the next one revelations 2 20-22 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel a woman which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication now that's not literal that's spiritual all right and to eat things sacrificed unto idols now he's talking about the church age and i give her space to repent he gave her 2 000 years to repent 2 000 years i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds revelations 13 4 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power and to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is likened to the beast see this guy's going to raise up on the scene when we leave and he's going to be like god he's going to be the prophet they needed he's going to be the president that they needed or the head of the government that they needed or the head of the u.n that they needed because he's going to be able to do miracles and that's what people are looking for folks people are looking for miracles they don't want to see it in you right they want to see it in some government head so that everybody can benefit from it all right so who is likened to the beast and who is able to make war with him in other words the nations are powerless and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 42 months what is 42 months three and a half years 42 months 12 312 is 36 right and then half of that would be 42. and he opened his mouth and blasphemed me against god into blasphemous name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and overcome them and power was given unto them all kindred tongues and nations now this is revelations 13 8. everybody got that revelations 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth all will worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world is hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what they turned down then brother brown saying say eve eve lost it on hebrews 13 8. and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book yeah they love the jesus of the past but he's like a second person and the holy ghost is the third person they really don't know where the father's at see how messed up it is but whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb's claim from foundation the world they all are going to fall under his rule you're not going to be able to help it unless you are a foolish virgin who has just a little bit of knowledge not to do exactly what he says but you know what's going to happen to them they're going to get killed amen is that right now look revelations 11 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days there's your twelve hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth now these are what the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth that would be the spirit of what moses and the spirit of elijah we know that right and if any man will hurt them fire not literal fire they look like a flamethrower what their words are powerful they will mean something listen you and i are going to have that same fire before we leave this earth you and i brother brown said for just a moment god's going to come on the scene to us and we're going to be able because some whoever's going to be alive and remain is going to have to shun death away from him it doesn't matter if they've trained a 50 caliber machine gun on you if any man will hurt them fire proceed out of their mouth and devour because remember like i said before they're going to make the whole world mad not just a few people they're really going to make the whole world mad and the whole world's going to want to kill them the mossad the c.i.a the fbi the kgb they're all going to want to kill these two people but they're going to have an anointing on them where they do not die because god said they're going to live 1200 1260 days now see if we can get that anointing on us with our listen with our anointing that says we which are alive and remain we won't die we're looking for that we're searching listen folks that's what i come to church for i come to church so that you'll get something that'll help you be that alive and remain every service not just to be a good christian or be a good this or be a good dad or be a good person out in the world i want somebody to be that alive and remain you i want somebody here i'm not preaching to the world i'm not preaching to the other place right here [Applause] i want somebody to enjoy enjoy looking at death and going nobody's ever done that oh death where'd you stand graves were your victory paul died sure we know he got the victory but he had to die i'm talking about somebody standing brother john and saying death you have no part with me listen we are we have been trained all of our life that we're going to die when i die hallelujah by my i'll fly away that was a that was a that's okay that was a revelation back then that was a revelation under the son of god message but not under the son of man message you can't kill the son of man he's done died for you so you don't have to and if any man will hurt them fire proceeds out of their mouth and devour their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed what about you see somebody a covert guy you know that looks kind of like zach black a little middle eastern leaf looking no somebody walk up to you and he's got this poison dart and he says hey how you doing two witnesses you know and he's sitting there filling them full of poison and they're going remember what paul did one time paul was picking up sticks picking up sticks and one like a black mamba come out of the thing and beat him on the arm and they all was watching him see how long he'd take him to die isn't what the world doing to us they're doing the same thing they're looking for us to mess up and they look and say well they really don't have what they say they have no we have got what the bible says we have and man that's what i'm looking for i'm not looking for all this other stuff i'm not looking for all this frailty that we have in the body i'm looking at a promise that god give us already not one coming one now so that so what's gonna happen if they sit there with that dart and they're going hey man how you doing they got that ring you know it's got that little sticker in it you know it's just they have those you know did you feel that okay you'll be gone in a minute okay pray for you but in that manner they got to be killed so somehow that turns around on them and they die boy what a god i'm just reading scripture but there's a reality to this sometimes we think well this is scripture and it's going to happen and sure it's going to happen when we're out of here but it's going to be god that's going to be leading these two prophets and they can't be killed i don't care what they do to them they can feed them poison for 20 days in a row actually they can feed them poison for three and a half years and they're not gonna die these have power to shut heaven and it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn into blood to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will keep going please and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them look when they have finished their testimony the beast will kill them and they'll lay in the streets we know that for three and a half days and they hate these two people these two people have absolutely turned the world upside down and they can't do anything to them until now i got you but guess what's going to happen they're going to rise after three and a half days and 144 000 too and they're going to disappear they're going to be caught up just like we were called up all right so let's read daniel 12 7 and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the water of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand into heaven and swear by him that liveth forever that had a beast for a time times and a half that's one two that would be one plus two plus a half that's three and a half years when he shall have accomplished look to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not then i said oh my lord what shall the end of these things listen it wasn't as great a prophet as daniel was this wasn't meant for him to understand but it was for me and you we had a prophet coming in time to tell us exactly what that meant and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed didn't brother ram stand up on the questions and answers of the seals and he said it's not for you it's gone from you you're not even supposed to get it same thing it was closed up to those people because they were they were living under the son of god message and that's where they were going to die and go by the grave which is listen no problem with that they're born again just as born again as you are okay for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified what from daniel's time that's about 4 000 years from when daniel prophesied this till the end of this age so many shall be purified made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the bride but the bride shall understand the wise shall understand daniel 9 24 70 weeks god never ever will forget those jews as bad as they did think of the things that they did to him being idolaters and all the doing exactly what he told them not to do yet he still loved them and he said i'm gonna take a group i'm going to redeem a group of people and they're going to live a millennium and i'm going to have a promise son of david i'll read it in just a minute there's a promise a promise to david a natural man that was a murderer and a an adulterer he promised i'll have a seat that you'll sit on in the millennium and you'll you'll not david himself but the son of david all right we'll rule the 12 tribes of israel that's a promise just like the promise is what you'll be there with your offspring see that's part of the millennium but it's also part of the future home all right so what's going to do 70 weeks are determined now just been reading going back i've been reading in jeremiah how jeremiah was in captivity and then remember daniel is going over jeremiah's book he's reading jeremiah just like we're reading jeremiah he's reading jeremiah he's seeing that 70 weeks are determined or 70 years at that time there were 70 years in captivity 68 years daniel said two more years lord what's going to happen the prophet of god said he didn't just only show daniel what was going to happen when they got out he showed him all the way to the consummation which would be battle of armageddon all right or coming into the millennium does everybody got that 70 weeks are determined upon thy people who jews and upon thy holy city so remember it's to the jews and the city everybody got that we've been over this time and time again but remember there's got to be a connection to the people and the city you and i don't have a continuing city abraham we're looking for a city whose building maker is god we know it's the future home we're not going to get there for another thousand in whatever years we've got left here but they're going to get a millennial temple because god promised it so 70 weeks are determined upon by people and upon thy holy city to do six things to finish the transgression of israel to make an end of israel's sin how is that that's through a message they've turned everybody else down the two prophets they're going to preach justification sanctification and to make reconciliation for their iniquity then it's going to stop for the people and then you got to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision in prophecy and anoint the most holy everybody got that you've been through this before but there's some new ones here and they they need to get it so what's two prophets gonna do the two prophets they're they're not commissioned to build a millennial temple they're commissioned to get 1260 days of preaching and call 12 000 of each tribe 12 times 12 is 144 000. that's their job but i believe in calling those 144 000 out them going up in a rapture then armageddon happens that that 144 000 is going to come back here and build that temple because you and i don't have a temple we don't know how to build temples amen we are the temple of god all right so let's go now to zechariah 12 and i will pour upon the house of david see look house of david jew and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem people and city the spirit of grace and of supplications you know what we just said and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn we know that's what it is that's when jesus christ is revealed to the 144 thousand that they killed him 2000 years ago all right and that day shall be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hadrimandan in the valley of where armageddon all right let's go to jeremiah 30 verse 7. i picked these up in reading in jeremiah so i included them in because i didn't bring this out the other day i want to bring it out now because it's called jacob's trouble everybody got that watch alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it there's 144 000 going to be saved out of that look for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and that will burst our bones sounds like somebody's getting free from something a man gets free from bondage and strangers shall no more serve themself of him lot watch this but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king that's not to us folks that's the son of david not literal david it's the son of david whom i will raise up unto them therefore fear they are not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee look from afar now listen i was reading a commentary from scofield and he made a real good statement i want to read this everywhere the jews have been dispersed in the world now this is schofield in in the early 1900s not even they haven't come back in 1946 because he spoke this in like the 20s he said they have been dispersed all over the world everywhere a jew goes there's prosperity think about it but everywhere a jew goes there's persecution they went to russia two and a half million of them went to russia early in the in the early 1900s and they got persecuted completely out but what were they jewelers they were business owners they had the money they owned the banks now look in america when they got dispersed where'd they go some of them come to america that's why hitler hated him he didn't hate him because they were jews folks i really don't think that he hated them because they had all the money and remember what they would do they would take their suitcase jew's not going to be far from his money he'd take their suit he wasn't going to put the suitcase in there to get burnt up get leave your suitcase right here because he knew there was probably thousands of dollars in that suitcase take all your clothes off and get into here we're going to give you a shower that's what he said and they put them in a gas chamber and killed them by the millions but they took even it was told that they took the gold out of their teeth after they died that's how bad hitler hated them but see they got dispersed and they got well look who owns wall street they're jews they're not americans sure they're american jews but they're jewish people so everywhere the jews go are dispersed because look watch this neither be the tomato israel for low i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their what captivity god knows he told them you're going to be dispersed into every country in the world you're going to be driven out of jerusalem because see i can only deal with you when you're here and i'm not ready to deal with you because i got what 2 thousand years of gentile rule that i've got to bring a bride out of that 2000 years and i don't want you back in your homeland but now when they leave i'm going to bring you back and jacob shall return and shall be in rest now are they unrest over there now no they sleep with one eye open and one eye closed thinking the palestinians or anybody else is going to drop a bomb on them shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end look now what's he promising he says i scattered them but i will destroy every nation remember the ten kingdoms won't won't be a jewish kingdom folks those ten toes that's all gentile right for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered these so in other words he scattered them into the nations made those nations prosperous but what did those nations do listen in russia read your history in russia they put them that's where the first word ghetto came from they herded them into ghettos no bathroom horrible living conditions just because they were jews now we know hitler persecuted them worse than that because he killed them but they've been persecuted everywhere they go why people hate them don't they hate them now people hate jews why they hate jews because they're jews you know why because right down inside people know they're god's people and god's given so many promises in the old testament that he's going to one day return back but he said i will make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of you he's going to save a remnant but i will correct thee and measure and will not leave thee all together unpunished we know why they're going to be persecuted they're going to be killed six and a half million of them during the holocaust which by the way was real some of you might want to look on the internet and see where they say it's not it was real all right now look he's going to destroy those ten toes remember what happened to the ten toes the ten toes was the last ten gentile nations after we're gone who destroys them the stone that comes down out of the mountain not made by hands christ comes and destroys those ten nations the battle of armageddon but see the hundred forty four thousand is going to be gone the ones that he dispersed and the ones that he brought back the ones that he said would be in jacob's trouble they're going to be sent up in a rapture revelation 6 verse 12. and that'll be held when he had opened the sixth seal a low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sack cloths of hair and the moon became his blood stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig casters her untimely figs when she is shaking of a mighty wind now this is the sixth seal brother brown said who opens that sixth sail two prophets all right and then the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together like i said a nuclear expo explosion and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and all the kings of the earth oh there's those kings and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains instead of the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand prophet god said those two witnesses interrupt nature they call all these things down on the world for a tribulation a time of tribulation while they're going through jacob's trouble and then what's going to happen we're going to have a battle of armageddon but let's read revelation 7 verse 1. i like the way how we stay in scripture everybody like we're staying in scripture i want you to understand not just what brother brown said this is bible this is what the bible says about it now it took a profit to put these pieces together don't get me wrong but now that he put the pieces together like i said many times before if we get the essence of the message when we read the bible when we read the bible we hear the prophet of god in the background telling us what that is amen don't you and that's the way it is to you you don't have to go but i don't know if that's what it is let me go see if i can find a quote you shouldn't have to do that you should look at it and go that ain't nothing but the truth and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds now water winds wars that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea and on any tree that's brother claude was preaching the other day you know you got your woes well there's four angels and what are the winds wars right that the war remember he stopped world war one or the prophet of god said man would have destroyed the whole world but he stopped world war one nobody knows why do we have veterans today on november the 11th do you all not know what that is aaron do they not know what that is why do we have veterans day on november 11th 11 11 because first world war ended on 11 11 on the 11th hour of the day the prophet says they don't know why it stopped it just stopped so they have veterans day on 11 11. just a little history lesson don't ever forget that okay now i saw another angel descending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice of the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants not bride servants everybody got that say amen till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads not a stamp oh lordy you know a preacher called me the other day and said you know what so there's a preacher in this message that's preaching the vaccine is the mark of the beef i'm going to sit down [Music] we have gone this long and even our kids right here in the front row don't believe that the vaccine is the mark of the beast a preacher in the message he needs the holy ghost i'm sorry we know what the mark of the beast is it's not a vaccine it's not a number stamped on your forehead it's not the barcode remember when the barcode came out everybody remembers when the barcode came out and everybody said that's the mark of the beast they're calling it everything but what it is because remember what i read you the whole world is going to be deceived by that beast and take that mark if you're not sealed by the holy ghost and it's not a vaccine and that's the truth somebody somebody called me said you believe what this brother's preaching and i said no i said tell me he said he's preaching at the mark of the beast is the vaccine so anyway well i have it so anyway so i heard the number of them which were sealed what is sealed by the holy ghost that was sealed how many forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel what's promised twelve thousand from each tribe twelve times twelve what 144 thousands she wins 144 thousand i knew left-handed people would know what was going on we have to stick together don't we sister somebody found her she's about to but that's all that's coming they called out 144 000. that's all okay now daniel 9 27. everybody all right we it's 9 28 24. and it's 9 24 it's 8 24. so we're good i feel good i feel a lot better than i did sunday that's for sure thank god and he shall confirm the covenant now who is that he that's that beast there's an antichrist that's that deceiver okay everybody got that we are not here when that covenant is signed so we know this is after the rapture of the church amen that he is not god because that he is fixing to break this covenant and god does not ever break a covenant who does man and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week so how many years are left after the rapture seven years or one week okay and in the midst of the week what's the mist of seven three and a half plus three and a half is seven so that must be when the two prophets prophesy for three and a half years when they get finished prophesying he is going to break that covenant he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate what is the consummation the consummation is the battle of armageddon the building of the temple and ushering in the millennium that's the end of the consummation everybody got that say amen all right now look revelations 11 7 and when they the two witnesses shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascended this is where we were at a minute ago the beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which spiritually is called sodom which that would be jerusalem all right and egypt where also our lord was crucified so we know where he was crucified in jerusalem and of the people in kindred and tongue and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half i wonder why it's three and a half days coincide with three and a half years maybe and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in grace why people want to humiliate them and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another they're fixing to regret sending them gifts to each other because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet cnn fox news abc cbs nbc reuters they're all there because they hate these two guys and they're going to see a miracle and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither isn't that what revelation 4 1 says come up hither let's take a rapture and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them everybody okay so they're going to take a rapture just like we took a rapture they're going to be carried away now what's going to happen after they're carried away listen to this now let me stop right here just a minute that you might know beyond one shadow of a doubt i just wouldn't take that one place i can take it through the entire scripture and prove to you that seven days that seven one week is seven years we understood that from jacob right jacob marion working seven years for leah working seven years for rachel and the bible says he fulfilled their weak all right so brother brown is not just grabbing straws it was in the bible already all right i just did it over here in revelations chapter 11 chapter and third verse then prophets will prophesy one thousand two hundred three score days which is in the midst of the last week of the jews then they're cut off or killed and the armageddon sets in now what is armageddon that is man killing man that is atomic fire not god's fire everybody got that that is man hating man so bad until they want to destroy each other off the face of the earth all right let's go the first seal we've read this one we're going to read it again now when he gets the money all under control then he will break this covenant with the jews now listen he doesn't break it with 144 000. they're never part of that covenant just like me and you we're not part of this world when you get born again you're caught out you've caught up out of this world it's not the 144 thousand this is the whole of the nation of jews that he's going to break that covenant with as daniel here said he would do in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of daniel and then brother what will he do he will have all the world trade and the commerce a pact with the world because he will hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time them two prophets will rise on the scene and call that 144 thousand then what will take place then the mark of the beast of revelation 13 will set him because he holds all the commerce trading everything in the world and what will take place then the mark of the beast will come in that no man can buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory don't have to go through that don't have to go through that now listen i wrote myself a note stop for a minute what is the mark of the beast i kind of got ahead of myself it's a doctrine it is not something on your forehead it's not something you eat it's not something they're going to shoot in your veins it's not something going gonna take you to the tattoo parlor it's it's in your forehead not own it's in in your intelligence he is going to deceive the whole world by his intelligence what satan took what the head god took the heart amen so he's going to go through this intelligence and he's going to deceive everybody at this time after the two witnesses leaving 144 000 he has deceived the whole complete world but somebody's going to get mad at him because he's holding everything and he's saying i'm god and you know what somebody's going to say prove it let's see if you let's see if you can make it through these three or four rounds of nuclear explosions right i mean that's the way man is going to be now look but revelations 19 6. and i heard it where's the voice of a great multitude it was the voice of many waters now look as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah the lord god on omnipotent reigns now look that's not a set group of people that's not 144 thousand it's voices great multitude bible says one time which no man can number right so it's got to be the bride as the voice of lightning saying alleluia the lord god i'm an impotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give him honor for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready that's what we're doing now but it's showing that we are going into a married supper and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god so while we're gone god's going to come down to the jews and reveal himself just like joseph took his gentile wife into the palace he comes back down and he reveals himself to his brethren the 144 thousand right the type of joseph all right he's going to come back down here he's going to reveal himself through two prophets but we're going to be enjoying the marriage supper and like i said before there is nowhere in the bible that it says it's for exactly three and a half years brother branham is putting together that while they're getting the three and a half year ministry down here on the earth we're enjoying three and a half years of a marriage supper somewhere in another dimension is everybody got that right and man because a lot of people have a contention about well it's only going to be three and a half years well the bible doesn't say that brother branham is just putting it together to overlap the three and a half years of of ministry down here that we're going to be gone somewhere because we're going to be glorified it's not going to matter what we're going to eat it's not going to matter where we're going to stay does it we could go sit on mars and be there just like that they want to go and it takes some months to get there we'll be going mars so it really doesn't matter so don't get caught up in that but we're not going to be here during that time of jacob's trouble and we're definitely not going to be here when the battle of armageddon starts we're coming back into the millennium after that we'll get to that in just a second then we'll quit and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god revelation 16 verse 13. amen all right and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs what was that there's your mark of the beast there's your trinitarian doctrine that has destroyed the bible sorry that's what the prophet said he said father son holy ghost baptism come from where the pits of hell i didn't say that he did because what it was cleaning three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet they all preach the same sermon 13 000 denominations pretty much believe the same thing thank god we're not part of that for they are the spirits of devils oh look working miracles yep which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them together to the battle of that great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth his garment unless he walked naked and they see his shame and he gathered them what the nations not these people the nations he interpolated he interjected that who's he coming as a thief and tonight for me and you all right because look keep your garments lest he walk naked and they see a shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying what it is done hallelujah it is done it is finished it's over and there were voices and thunders and lightning and there was a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the earth you think california is going to be bad don't be around for this one either so mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell this is the wrath of god folks this is not an amateur tribulation this is the wrath of god poured out on people that do not care about god and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and there fell upon men of great hail out of heaven sounds like a pretty good nuclear war every stone about the weight of a talent men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great wow let's don't be here during that time just a few more victory day we talk about it we've had several wars the wars and rumors of wars v days v days and v days in other words victory day and it finally winds up into the great battle of armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth she re-purifies herself with what this atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and things sink this soaked blood of men and upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic braids out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for people to live here amen i like that see there's coming a time when it will be great let's go to ezekiel 40. now after the battle of armageddon somebody's come and got to build a temple according to the bible between that time and the time that we ride in revelations 19 when we ride back into the temple there's got to be a temple built sometime to finish daniel 70 weeks because what it is to daniel's people and the city thank you they're going to build a city because they need a city not you say they need well they're jews god promised he'd raise up the people and the city amen in the five and twentieth year of their captivity the beginning of the year and the tenth day of the month and the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten and the self same day the hand of the lord was upon me now this is ezekiel and brought me thither thither in the visions of god he brought me into the land of where what in new york when chicago israel and set me up on a very high mountain by which was at the frame of a city on the south and he brought me feather and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand in the measuring reed and he stood in the gate and a man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that i shall show thee in other words don't miss what i'm telling you because i'm going to give you the exact if you'll if you read ezekiel 40 through 44 it's not boring to read that but it's dimensions and rooms and where this is going to be placed and where that's going to be placed that temple is going to be built in before the millennium by somebody and it can't be us we don't build temples the jews build temples son of man behold thine ears and hear without hear eyes and hear with our ears and set the heart upon all that i shall show thee for to the intent that i might show them unto thee are thou brought hither declare all that thou see us to the house of the gentiles no to the house of israel has nothing to do with us nothing to do with us all right revelations 19 11. now remember we read revelations 19 where the marriage of the lamb has come and the bride has made or his wife has made herself ready right now we're reading the last part of revelations 19 and i saw heaven open so we must have been in another dimension and behold a white horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes was a flame of fire on his head many crowns and he had a name written that no one knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and that word was made flesh which was who jesus christ so that's who that is if you didn't know that and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean that's me and you and out of his mouth goes with a sharp sword word that with it he should smite the nations he shall rule them with rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press of the fearless and wrath of almighty god i'm trying to hurry and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh name written king of kings and lord of lords and we know those are all capital letters so we know he has come to a position that he had not ever come to before why you and i are right there with him look at number five we're gonna read five and six and then we'll stop right there and the musicians get ready to come now notice there's what we've seen are coming back to the millennial temple over here at the end of the jewish age in other words at the end of the 70 weeks at the end of the 70 weeks all right the anointed here he comes riding on a white horse he's reading revelations 19. those followed him on white horses horses or powers dressed in white blood vesture dipped in blood wrote him wrote on him the word of god he cometh the mighty conqueror to set up the millennium cometh to the temple glory there he meets that hundred forty four thousand well where's 144 thousand they're built in the temple so he's coming down from heaven to meet that 144 thousand that are on the earth built in that temple there he meets the 144 thousand let's read number six real quick musicians come oh the church age ending is blacked out the bride is called we have already entered the tribulation that's the question no no no i wish that i could just have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory to the marriage supper and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgins what the five foolish for three and a half years while israel is getting its prophecy which is what three and a half years then the tribulation sets in upon israel jacob's trouble then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes the white throne judgment after that the new heaven and the earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together now we'll head into the millennium on sunday and we'll see how glorious the time let's stand our feet how glorious the time that is because when we come back onto this earth folks in revelations 19 it ain't going to look the same it's going to look totally different there's not going to be there's not going to be sin devil we're going to read he's going to be bound for a thousand years and all his little amps are going to be bound you're not going to worry about no virus you're not going to worry about going to work you don't have to worry about pains or aches everything's going to be put back the way it's supposed to be but now remember the millennium is still in time everybody got that the millennium is still in time so it's not it's eternal redemption is not over yet okay has everybody got that a thousand years is gonna have to be lived by somebody to prove the sin curse is over with so there's gonna have to be day night day night 1000 years and then at the end of that thousand years we'll see that there'll be a another battle then there'll be a white throne judgment then there'll be a future home that's when eternity eternal plan of redemption will be over people be given eternal life at the white throne judgment and they'll enter into eternity that's the last group of people that's going to make it but i'm going to tell you something with all of us sitting here you better hope you don't make that part amen because you know too much right we're at a place to where we you say well that scares me it shouldn't scare you if you're born again if you're sealed by the baptism of holy ghost nothing should scare you like that like i said before what a wonderful revelation that we don't have to go through the judgment all that awful stuff i just read you that is going to come on this earth will happen to human beings that turn god down if you don't turn god down you're not a part of that you're revelations 19 you're up here with the wife has made herself ready and you're at a great um
