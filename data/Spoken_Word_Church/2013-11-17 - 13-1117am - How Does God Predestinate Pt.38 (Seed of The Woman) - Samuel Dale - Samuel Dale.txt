fellowship meeting and all and fellowshipping together we heard yesterday too there's a brother Sammy k ker I I know him by just you know meeting him in in times past but he passed away yesterday so remember his family and he had a church I think down in North Carolina but I'm thinking he lived in the virginas but uh he had two churches that he was trying to pastor and they said that he was running backwards and forth and he went home from what we heard and to try to get back home to deer hunt with his Grand kids I think they said and he uh had a heart attack and passed away but just remember the family and just you know the churches there the Lord would would bless and all and just one more of those great warriors that's gone on you know and I told you many years ago there'd be a lot of people passing on and that would would be it right remember that member Brother Dean is preaching down at brother Harris's keep him in mind uh my wife's not here this morning but she's coming on a little later she's not feeling real good this morning remember her and they can't figure out what it is cuz she gets up of a morning she's real nauseated and really uh you know got a lot of problems doing that and then her neck hurts and the different things but just remember her and pray the Lord to bless and little abig Grace she's had strep throat but she should be over with it by now

she's going to be gone uh over into the Christmas period time so remember that remember the the Thanksgiving and the Christmas time of eating will be together this time and it will be on December the

Earth we thank you for your grace and your love unto us and we pray that you would just bless each and every one of us in thine understanding because that's what we desire more than anything else is for you to come on the scene and open your word we know and for assurity that if you're opening your word unto us then that is you being on the scene with us so we just thank you Father forgive our sins and guide each one remember the sick among us and and all and you promised it so we believe it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from dest instruction so we believe you father and just bless each one be with Brother Dean there as he's preaching brother hares and father remember each one and one and just Lord guide each one of us that we may be what you want us to be we ask it all now in Jesus name amen back on our scripture in Romans 8 then we'll go to Genesis 2 Romans 8 28-31 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's go over to Genesis now and take remember Sister Freda they said sick this morning too so remember her Genesis 2 we'll just read verse 4 through n says these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth where when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plet of the field before it was in the Earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was a not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man out Mo man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life and he became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been on during Genesis and trying to cover a lot of things and oh yeah let me read a let me read a testimony that we received about we were concerned about him and been praying about him I know everybody has about brother Collins and this is the testimony that came in uh today from I guess it's the oldest girl and it really blowed me when I see I said who is that you know because I didn't recognize the name but it's the oldest girl Anna and she says this is thankful day number 16 I am thankful that God still works miracles amen amen and I'm thankful for his healing blood mom called last night to say that Dad had all his color back in his face and hands he went months looking pale and God sent him to the right doctors to get him the help he needed and God placed his blood back into his body to flow normally and the anism the doctor said he would always have on his main artery this doctor couldn't even find it yeah amen and the x-rays amen that ain't all that ain't all just hold on and the first EKG showed his heart was dead on the bottom and top listen because we knew that we had you know we had talked with him and encouraged him to go to the doctor and he has been feeling real bad and all we've been down hunting a little bit Dar and he hadn't been out fellowshipping like he's been at it cuz I'm sure he didn't feel right but thank God he went to the doctor amen and they begin to help him but watch what it says now the first a EKG showed his heart was dead on the bottom and top 10 tests later the doctor came inad amen scratching his head he said I can't find it amen now I don't know what happened this is what the doctor Y and him and the nurse just thank God right there in the room for God's healings touch so thank you God that's something a it to tell you in an EKG and things that your heart is dead and then come back and tell you that you can't find anything wrong with it that's something is it that's that's God's healing virture amen cuz I knew brother Collins was was had been sick and we've been really concerned about praying about him and brother Ray and I yesterday we were trying on the telephone to make contact to see if they had heard anymore and all from him and uh so just keep praying for him I'm sure he still needs prayer but thank God for for touching him and for the doctors having to testify all right now to me brother Brown said if God comes down and heals one person he said that ought to throw everybody into desperation to believe right amen cuz we can heal one he can heal everybody right so then we ought to believe it amen all right now we've been talking for quite a while about the Garden of Eden and the things that was taking place in the garden and using that to show how that God predestines how do we how do we see that he predestines by his for knowledge he doesn't predestinate anybody to be lost but he doesn't predestinate anybody to be saved right amen because he leaves us as a free moral agent to where we can choose uh you know which way we go right all right now in doing that then see he can't make us fall and be just to judge us right but before the foundation of the world he knew we would fall y see all right but he knew also what he would do that's the point we spent a lot about to fall but yet how much time do we spend about thinking about what he his plan and purpose was right what was his plan and purpose to reveal himself make himself known to the man that he would create amen right all right see then in doing that then he would could be come then by permitting us to fall not making us but permitting us to fall then he could come on the scene and display his attributes of Savior healer father comforter whatever Advocate whatever the things you know and see if it hadn't been for the fall he could not display those things but we've went over it and over it and over it to make sure we don't misunderstand it and somebody listening to us misunderstand that see he couldn't make us lost right sir he couldn't predetermine us to be lost you know without giving us a choice right all right then he would give us a choice you know and I know a lot of people don't believe it that way but that's fine this is what I believe you know in the word of God all right and see then that way he would be able to fulfill his plan cuz he's his forn knowledge knew that he could be able to bring to pass his word right you know and his dos and all like that and it's a wonderful picture but if you try to make it a stamp to fire you know well this is predestination that's Destiny determined but the prophet of God said what for knowledge comes first am we've been through that about 36 sermons ago so if you want to listen to them go back if you don't then argue all you want to I don't have time to argue I'm trying to preach to get us out of here all right now see man when man fail the fall never pulled anything over on God that's the point I'm trying to get you to see he knew what we would do right that's right he knew we would fall if we were given free moral agency he knew Satan would fall he was given free moral agency and he fail he knew we would fall all right then in doing it see then he could display himself to you and I as being a savior healer and things we're talking about all right but now what I want you to look at especially today this morning part we've went through what happened in the garden the fall and we we believe what happened and and tried to show in the scriptures and the things you know and we shown that really the the what is sin unbelief all right see that's the original sin but we know also that sin being unbelief that sin would have an attribute or a display of sin so it would go into literal happenings and we believe that's what happened in the garden see that Eve disbelieved God and then she accepted by doing that Satan's lie and we you know we spent the time trying to show what's went on and trying to be to the place that we could understand but now I want you to notice something cuz cuz this is the way I think you know all right God knew we would fall all right and he knew what he was going to do okay so he already had in the garden the tree of life amen right we read it there amen okay he already had that tree there when man was brought into being the tree was in the garden amen all right showing what he was going to doely amen right that's good and showing that by his for knowledge he knew what we' do but by his for knowledge he knew what he'd do so he wouldn't leave man lost that's what I'm trying to drive the point now about I know I've done it on the last few services but it's not a problem for me to preach things over and over and over it's Paul said it's needful but now watch as I said he had the tree was D now if there was not an ability to receive from that tree why would a tree be there right we we went through and covered the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was what Satan in his bases of unbelief coming to Eve all right not an apple tree or something like that it it's a funnyl looking tree because it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's a tree to make one wise it didn't say a tree to make one where they wouldn't be hungry because they ate some fruit or give you the belly ache it was a tree to make you wise had to be something about intelligence all right and in doing that his for knowledge that he knew what we would do the same for knowledge he knew what he would do amen all right that he would make a way all right remember now how that we covered that paragraph 187 these are not on the thing now so in Blasphemous 9 WR around paragraph 187 through 190 he covers that into Adam's nostrils was breathed the breath of eternal life and he even uses there that he became an eternal person with God all right now how could he then destroy do you understand what I'm getting at I'm trying to get the picture to unfold to you and I that not a picture of this problem's coming and have has L and yeah God finally figured out something about this you know it was going wrong he decided he better do something no how could he give Adam eternal life and then him be lost right right amen so he started off the creation of mankind in a beautiful picture amen all right then we went through on the breach of the seal books paragraph 91 where did Adam fail from eternal life to death in the garden now he never fail to from eternal life to Eternal separation I don't believe that because that would be God being an ending giver and he wouldn't be doing it I believe that he gave him eternal life amen but yet Adam's Body was not Eternal and his body not being Eternal then when he fell he fell to human natural death it would take 800 years later before it ever come or ever how old Adam was but he would still die because methusa was 969 and that's the oldest man see nobody lived a thousand years all right so then he never reached the position it's like brother brandom on on who is this mzd he said Jesus came theophany word body to begin with right but he said we by pass that now was that a by pass that it was there we went around it and come back did we by to the when he says it are theop is your soul even a sinner's soul is his theophany so did we byp pass or is it the fact that we never came that way well you're just trying to I'm what I'm trying my best to preach the truth you quote yourself to death well brother brandham said Adam fell from eternal life to death amen he died y right but did you go to hell if you did you got a problem with the resurrection where your own Prophet will say that one day Adam will reach over and Shake Eve and Eve reach over and Abel and say there'll be a resurrection he he never put Adam in hell all right so I'm trying my best to get us to get a clear understanding of a lot of things instead of of just quote right you know all right now watch this part as we think about it that when man fa now as I said he'd already give him eternal life in Adam and Eve their soul so there had to be something worked out so he would have to send a redeemer amen right irregardless of what you want to think about what happened to Adam come on I mean if you think he died and went to hell whatever you think about it still remember one thing but the fact of him being where he was the position it would mean that God would have to redeem him amen you agree amen all right now so if he would redeem him what's so beautiful is the way I think I mean you know I'm that's that's carnal a how beautiful I think I think it is some times but that's all right but now God didn't leave everything just laying there you know but the first thing he done all right was what go to number two Genesis 3:21 it says what what did God do what's the first thing he did done and Adam also into his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin to clothe them all right now he went through as the prophet said on the way to have Fellowship that God introduced to the world a blood Redemption and God killed those animals and took the skins and give them to Adam and Eve starting a Redemptive planen now are you listening amen starting a Redemptive plan cuz you see the animals the animal caused the fall or was used in the fall so we went through that in the church the Ephesian Church age uh page 102 Church age book animal was using the fall so animal would become the sacrifice am that's sensible all right but now think about it the animal sacrifice was only the beginning of the Plan of Redemption amen that's right because the animal life had no soul to be able to come back upon the believer right so it was only the start of of it right you see it would only speak of what would come later see the animal life would make the atonement for sin right right but the animal life could not take away that sin and no matter if he did make a a coach of skin all that done was atoned it didn't eradicate sin right are you listening now but when you come to Genesis 3:15 go ahead and pull it up where you can read it said I'll put enmity between thy seed and her seed and what would take place see had he left it with just the atonement that would have just been covering no eradication of sin through the animal atonement so he had to do something else so he promised the seed of the woman right says thy seed and her seed he promised that all right now now be real careful how you're listening for the next few minutes cuz I know I have a funny way of presenting things but now remember it's called the the seed of the woman I'll put enmity between thy seed and her seed now why would it say that way why would it say her seed and why would it say thy seed and first off Satan does not have a seed he's a spirit being right I'll read this to you in a second he has no literal seed that's why it's called the seed of the serpent but he has no literal seed all right it's called The Seed of the woman or her seed when a woman don't have a seed right A woman has an egg right the male has the sperm but see that way Eve couldn't re bring forth but Adam couldn't bring forth right we lay heavily on the man having to The Germ of life and that's true see if the hen hadn't been with a rooster the eggs are no good I mean they the eggs you can eat them but they won't reproduce all right but a woman doesn't have a seed why would it say her seed okay but yet we read of it in the Bible and we read and we talk about the seed of the serpent all right now if you're referring to the serpent as being Satan and that's what the Book of Revelations we read the scriptures we gave it you know the serpent the Old Devil right it refers to him as a serpent all right but yet Satan does not have a seed amen his seed is unbelief right he couldn't create as God could create Adam and Eve right but he couldn't create all right but it speaks of his seed now what is the seed of The Serpent and what is the seed of the woman wanting you to think think seriously with me about it and you'll hear Brother random in the Bible to talk about the seed but just remember in The Parables there was only two seeds it's the seed of God which is his word is that Jesus say in the parable the St went forth to so and then here comes a man sewing another seed Satan doesn't have a seed that's right no physical part about him amen it's a Propet to say Satan seed or serpent seed or whatever but remember as I said you can quote yourself to death that's right but when you do I'm going to be standing waiting on you to come back brother Mo had a good illustration he said if you got a rabbit and he gets in your pen you know or in where your garden is he said they don't need getting in there and chasing that rabbit you're going to tire up a lot of stuff he said just find out where he got in at and go put your foot Over the Hole said he's coming back to there Old Timer some of them are old enough here and old brother how's listening in he's old enough you go rabbit hunting they said my daddy was the best at it cuz when the dogs jumped the rabbit he didn't go chasing the dogs he just waited you know what rabbit going to come back where it left from dogs going to run him all over the country but he coming back to the come that's his home so he just wait on him all right now what's my point my point is I'm not going to argue with you about quoting right oh I've got these quotes here brother randam said 40,000 times the seed of the serpent well amen the Bible speaks of a seed amen amen the Bible speaks of a serpent amen but remember the devil don't have a seed a literal part he can't create he can't even use what he's got as far as to bring anything God kept that from him right all right now in doing that what does it take to make a seed and brother random will say 4 42,000 times that the man has the seed I don't mean that I didn't look it up to see I'm just showing you that he says a man has the seed well now a man has the sperm he doesn't have a seed if he had a seed he could reproduce himself without the woman right come on if the woman had a seed she could reproduce herself right so what does it mean to seed of the woman it's got to be telling something in a way that is hidden from the eyes of mankind but yet to be revealed to us as the word of God what is the seed of the serpent what is the seed of of the woman there are such things as worms that or what do you call that word by what asex asexual asexual okay I didn't pronounce that correctly y'all blame him I don't know which means that worm can be either male or female he don't need another worm he can do by himself right but but now the human beings are not that way so the woman has the egg or field the man has the sperm or germ using the terminologies but you know that it takes an egg right and a germ to make a seed y okay now now if that ain't right I want you explain to explain to me the new birth cuz a new birth is not just believing even though you receive the word of God that's right it's not alive until the holy spirit amen quickens that word right amen now you can have the new birth all right do you see where we're putting it what is the seed of the woman what is the seed of the serpent so they said listen real carefully cuz I'm trying to get you to not miss something go ahead to number four and let's read what brother randam has to say my wife name there an and Richard and Abby they didn't hear what we were saying want to go we got a note about brother Collins that they can't find anything wrong with it amen they said his heart was dead in the bottom and dead in the top by their own EKGs they run their test over and can't find nothing so God still the Healer right but look what the prophet has to say now on a message called Oneness I'd invite you to listen to this whole message 1962 211 paragraph e or paragraph 98 89 and 90 listen what happened I said all right I want to ask you something the woman has no egg listen to what he's saying now she has no seed she's got an egg he's not saying that way she has no seed he said now he said not an egg the Bible don't say the Egg of the woman it says the seed of the woman why now listen to my point about the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelations especially the most fought at two books in the Bible to take our own understanding we're going to make it say a lot of things it doesn't say but to what I'm trying to get you to see is that it doesn't say in Genesis the egg cuz she does have an egg but she doesn't have a seed all right now the Bible said Jesus said I think the old father that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but revealed them unto babes which is would learn right now if it had been written in Genesis that Eve and the Beast had had a sexual aair would have been a mystery would have been any secret but it doesn't say that does it amen right it's like they ate an apple but see God's hiding it right amen that he can reveal it thank God for the revelation am all right so it doesn't say now the woman has no she has she has no seed he said now he said not in the egg he said thy seed and she had no seed right see if it have said she don't have an egg I mean she you know she's got an egg right the woman produces the egg right all right listen now it takes a union to make a seed is that right he's as the doctor cuz one sitting there has to be if you got a whole lot of pup out here didn't have no life in it and planted it out here and and it wouldn't never come up lay there and rot you couldn't plant that life without having the pup see you can't pant the pup without the life and you can't pant the life without the pup you got to get it together to make a seed all right so you see the whole thing is a union now watch what he says I'm trying to tell you now about Christ in the church okay the new birth in other words it's a union and if the woman is the seed of herself then she doesn't need the mail she can have her baby herself right but she can't be she can't have the baby until she's been with a male because it takes the two together to make a seed is that right plant a seed with no life in it and see what happens he goes on to tell you about it and you know you know they've ever tried it they evidently had a woman pregnated some way to show that with an animal or dog that it didn't produce why because of different seeds different genes different doings you know they've tried it but think about it it takes the egg and the sperm to make the seed but yet you can say seed right and you can say the seed of the woman you you you can say talking about a man and talking about his seed all right but just remember now you got to have the union to make a seed cuz if it was just a seed without a union part then you wouldn't need the new birth but see it takes the word and the spirit to bring the New Birth Faith Comes what by hearing to hearing by the word of God faith Revelation that's why nobody in the Bible was ever born again and nobody's ever been born again with without first hearing the word right amen show it to me right well I was just sitting out under the tree well Mama had told you about it Daddy had told you about somebody told you about Jesus Christ Ain pre no preacher have anything to do with my new birth well that may be true maybe you don't have it right that's a good point but just think about it now why would God call it thy seed speaking to the serpent that was standing there in the Beast and thy seed which would turn out to be the seed of the woman I'm just trying to get you to seriously think see then that would hide it from the wise and prudent amen and let me wise and prudent in the people of the message and quote quote quote quote quote quote quote quote I got this quote I got that I'm only got 300 quotes on this I don't know where to preach it or not you can quote yourself to death and it not be lined up that's right now come on how many of you before you heard of this message used to believe in a trinity ain't no even raising hands cuz we all did that's right one way or the other right how many of us believe hell was eternal till we heard the truth you know what we we we we take the Bible to prove that and it all wrong right see then let's get away from just thinking about some and open up our minds to the point of thinking about the seed of The Serpent and the seed of the woman and just think about it right go ahead with number five brother baptism of the Holy Spirit reach 1958 928 the morning service paragraph 78 and now before we can finish that subject we'll have to pick it up tonight in the seat of The Serpent and the seed of the woman all right now and bring it down and show you why it is see how that the seed of the serpent moved down out at the seat of the woman move down that's what we're going to run through the Bible when we get time to go through and show it at that the seat of the serpent begin to to predominate or how you that's I guess that's the way you pronounce it he used it again predominate predominate get greater and greater greater greater greater until now there's nothing left but just a little small remnant of names still that's left written from the foundation of the world so the seed of the serpent has taken over the world Jesus addressed it in all of the kingdoms when Satan offered him all the kingdoms right amen he said no I'm going to pay the price right I've got to die all right but see as it comes down we want to try to make lineages all right I thought according to the parable of Jesus they were the children of the kingdom and the children of the wicked one that was all I knew I mean it's all I know in the Bible I don't know of three or four different seeds to you right and just as we covered this past Wednesday that everybody in the world is born with the mark of the beast because it's only the mark of the beast or the Seal of God and there's no in between area he said well brother D I don't how to mark of the beast do we have the same ideas or thoughts or trinitarian isms that people had cuz that's the mark of the beast it's in your forehead it's not a stamp or a tattoo that's put on you or something got to be here or got to be a little number here or something I ain't going to deceive nobody that's bad as my brother-in-law used to think that that Beast would rise up and it says it rise up out of the sea you know he he literally believed that one of these days they' be big old animal come walking out ocean well who's that going to deceive right I told him I said that ain't deceiving nobody it's got to be a religious Mark no big old animal it says a beast well he just well there's a whale washed up on the shore there maybe a few weeks after then or something and I told Pig I said well I guess Robert thinks that was the the dead Beast come up but I wasn't making light of him that was his belief he's very serious but thinkk about it now the seed of the serpent all right now what are you making out of that because Satan doesn't have a seed right all right that's simp isn't it he has unbelief that's his seed if you want to call it seed just means a core something or or an ability of reproduction and that's why I was getting at it a while ago see if you if you don't have the word and spirit it can't reproduce if you don't have the egg and the sperm you can't reproduce one by itself won't work the other one won't work Eve couldn't bring forth neither could the Beast bring forth and and neither could Satan bring forth cuz he didn't have a literal seed so by his doing he could enter the animal the Beast the missing link between the man and the monkey and if you got a scof your Bible if you ain't I'll sure let you read mine he even says says that that Beast was an upright creature made a snake by the curse all right simple but see it wasn't the seed of the serpent the seed of the serpent is Satan right the seed of the Beast is what caused the natural problem all right but yet he had to get through E's mind and she accepted that lie in her brain memories and conscious affections to her spirit and she conceived that idea in her mind before a woman can take a man she has to conceive it in her mind think about it all right now if you can see what I'm getting at the Beast couldn't reproduce himself Eve couldn't reproduce herself Adam couldn't reproduce hisself right and Satan not having a seed being a spiritual being not a natural being he had to use the Beast see because he knew brother said Satan has a knowledge of the principles of life now that another words that means to me in plain carnal language that if he's got a knowledge of the princip of life he knows what life life consist of whether whatever it be you know what we consist of and what we are and everything and he he he he's the one brother R said it put these people on the moon it wouldn't God Satan's knowledge intellect Etc s on the moon what do we need the moon for brother R said we're going to go by there one of these days to fice so you won't even see the thing am we don't need no moon but now listen Satan not being able to create as God could create in the for fact of all the animals everything then Adam and Eve but he had a knowledge that this Beast could mingle with the human race all right and as he did then he found a way other words think about it there were Satan back there he seen what God done he seen how God created how he brought everything into being it was beautiful and he said but I've got to figure out a way so he took the weaker vessel to woman you know and he started with that and he brought to P the fall as we' call it in the garden but see he used the Beast now and if that's not true I I like to put something if a brother htis used to say that it was good if a equals B now I'm surely not what that's algebra I'm certainly not a major but if a equals B you know what that means B is the same as a right if a equals B all right now if a means that the bees couldn't reproduce himself through Eve until he brought the point with Eve all right and that Satan could never in no way reproduce himself so we see seem as brother R said like he used the swines at Gia when he entered into them and they ran down the hill and killed themselves I like the way he said it one day he said see them pigs didn't want nothing to do with the devil and then we turn around and accept him something to that degree but think about it what was the seed of the serpent it began his unbelief all right right then it went from unbelief to an attribute like smoking drinking gambling Etc is an attribute of sin all all so what Satan done he was standing looking at the way God done things but he said I can't do it that way so he said okay I'll do it this way see he's smart he's shrewed as an example balum could couldn't get God to curse Israel right you remember told not to go and he went all the time you remember that in the Bible he couldn't get God to curse Israel he even himself in his writings is in the Bible he said D like a unicorn he said who can can who can curse what God has blessed that was even balum in his prophecies all right but what did balum do he said okay I can't curse him but said B I'll tell you what to do he said all you got to do is get them them women over them men and said and problem will take place and said when it do God's going to come down right we'll get to it eventually when we get over to the point of where that it says right at the flood it says the sons of God saw the daughters of man the sons of God would be the children coming down from Seth I'm quoting brother randam but them beautiful women were coming from kan's lineage now in doing that then Satan says okay I I've been talking through this beast and I done got her to disbelieve I done got her mind and her thinking her conscience and her memories and I done got that all messed up and says now I see my only ability to enter the human race in any form would have to be through that Beast he said if we can do if I can get that done God will have to come down that's where the mistake was CU he said God would have to come down and curse him do you remember we read it future home R said God didn't curse Adam read your Bible and see if he did he said he didn't even curse Eve but said he cursed the serpent he cursed the world because of the things amen why because as I saying when I started he had his plan and purpose he was going to achieve amen and he couldn't destroy them right amen but all right but there they are now his literal way of doing something so let's read go ahead with number six this is page 99 of the Ephesian Church age which is church age book this portion of the scripture of scripture is a revelation of how the literal seat of the serpent was swn in the earth watch even as as we have the account of Luke 1:26 through3 where he set forth the exact account of how the seed of the woman y came into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male you see that's where I love the the the the Bible and the way the prophet will use it to describe so he doesn't deal with using to describe the devil so much he's using it to show you what happened in the Bible of how that deceit of the woman come into being all right and it comes down to Mary right and it comes down to the point of telling him the angel did she said I know not a man Angel answered and said unto the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so we see that the SE of the woman would have to be the Son of God right all right now but I keep asking that question and I know I'll do it for two more services why is it call to see of the woman I'm going to do that two more services at least then I'll tell you why okay cuz I got a unique way of my own self I have to approach something real slow cuz I remember how my mind works and I know how yours works we retain 5% of what we hear 1% if we're asleep that's you know all right but see he's going to show how this seed of the serpent becomes swn in the earth and he shows how the seed of the woman come into physical manifestation apart from instrumentality of human male right all right now what does the religious World believe right the religious World believes that Mary produced The Egg and God produced the sperm to bring forth Christ right that's the belief of the world but that wouldn't be a virgin birth no problem with that is it where to be a virgin birth in that and I you know we don't have not to do it to be too vulgar but it's like the prophet said he said then there's got to be so I know you women are going to argue cuz you've argued with me all the years but finally you'll learn one of these days I read some and try to step with knowledge if I can you know how I've tried to explain to you everybody thinks there one egg comes down a month science says there thousands comes down they're destroying your doctrinal thoughts but see think about it then the world thinks that Mary produced the egg right all right now here's the words of the Prophet what did he say he said that would mean you'd have to have a sexual intercourse to bring down the egg now I'm not going to go into lint but if you want to talk later we'll be glad to go to the m to the scientific side of that a woman don't have to enjoy what she does for it to produce a rape case can produce a baby come on try to out be vulgar but it takes the Intercourse to make the egg move down to the place that can be connected so that would mean God would be having an intercourse with Mary that wouldn't work ain't no sense to it so God created the egg and the sperm and placed it into Mary I won't get to it this morning I know now but that's why you call him in Revelation 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God Amen you know that that Jesus was the only begotten yep y Adam was the first creation Jesus was the only begotten amen so if we get anything we got to get it through him that's why he's the first born of many Brethren was in Romans all right so now think about it Mary didn't produce the egg so God by the Virgin birth produced egg and sperm placed it in the wound of Mary and she had a child so we're living in a scientific age now if you can't have children what do they do they can take the egg from the daughter they done it you know back a few years ago like the either the daughter or the son one they took you know this couple and they took the egg from the woman they took the sperm from the male and they put it in Grandma right you know what Grandma had a baby but it wasn't Grandma's baby right see the Virgin birst being proved that God took the egg and the sperm and put it there amen that's why Jesus never called her mother show me in the scripture now listen I'm not carnal I I don't claim to be I'm ignorant but I don't claim to be stupid and when he was a little bitty baby he didn't look around you ain't my Mama you ain't my Mama you ain't my M stupid but when you say that Mar that he never show it to me in the Bible is what I'm talking about show me in the Bible where he ever called her mother when she gets down there he's about 13 years old what happens your father is and I I was reading just the other day where brother around said she got where she was embarrassed she didn't want to claim when she' said all of her life that she was he was virgin born said she got in front of them and denied him right what did he say he said I must be about my father's business correcting those Pharisees his daddy was a carpenter he Eed him to do that but see he never called her woman I mean mother he called her woman that's right you find him on the cross and he's looking down and said John Behold thy mother he didn't say John take my mom home he said behold thy mother he called a woman short ter in the Bible I mean I'm just honest but you see what was taking place God was hiding from the eyes of the wise and prudent the things that he was doing you said well that ain't true brother that well do you tell me how come the whole world turned Jesus down I mean that would have solve the problem okay did they reject him did the on that was looking for him the high priest that was hollering saying the messiah's coming when he the god that said kill him and prophesied and said it's better for one to die for the sins of the people that were all to die come on read your Bible right but Satan knew the only way he could do anything other than the unbelief to be placed into Eve was to get her and that Beast together and that God then would have to come down and do something so what does he say go back to the quote now as the seat of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh okay so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan who is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race we're speaking about so what was his injection into the human race ease mind first then using the Beast to bring forth all right now look at the next one look at number seven try to get a few then we'll quit this is taken from the message one this we were on while ago which is really a continuation so the seed that was in her then was a union of an unlawful act talking about Eve right which was death she was already pregnated with the serpent seed because she had to liveed with it and she turned and said herself the serpent beguiled me that's right and immediately came come on oh we know she said she got a child from God right sir certainly every child that's born illegitimate or anything else has to come by an act of God he has to create it right Satan can't create soever baby b in the world well it's illegitimate or whatever it is it come from God God's the only one who can give life all right he's the only one who can make life certainly that is right see she was already to be mother and that never only what it did was clean up the thing of the serpent seed the seed that's in you now is by concept concepted your unlawful act against my word with this thing here and you now you are now got the serpent seed but I'll give you a seed by Immaculate Conception and his seed shall bruise the Serpent's head and his head shall bruise a heal amen just let God have it it it's his word he'll bring it to P so the first thing in the garden was what do this and we'll quit pick up his seing first he killed the animals and he atoned right amen that atonement would last of those animals till Calvary right but it would not take away sin so that was just speaking of the coming Messiah and not a direct we'd call it prophecy all right but Genesis 3:16 as I've told you it's odd where it's placed in between cuz you're coming along pull that up brother and when I need Genesis 3615 and the before and the after of it if you can get it but it's talking about the things and all and then all at once right in the middle to not but I'll put in me to T thy seat in the seat of the woman the promise of the coming Messiah amen right here's what brother around them covers it I'll get to it this evening so what is he doing what we need is the other cuz it's it's sorry everybody can read it we need verse 14 15 16 cuz that way you can read what's taking place and all right right in the middle that's why I like to stop and say things because you know when first time I was reading the Bible CU we good Baptist you know that's where I come from Baptist Church okay and I'm not against anybody I just where I come from but see we got the gold star we read the Bible through so I told my wife when I I accepted Christ in the Baptist Church I said you know I mean I'd read the Bible I knew a little bit about it but I said I need to read the Bible through not necessarily the gold star cuz I didn't care you know I wanted to know what God's word said and you know what I done I read them things and you know what I'm talking about when you got over there so far and it said so and so beg got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so beg got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so and so but got so and so and an hour later I'm still so and so but got so and so you think I'll just turn over that no I didn't get the star I had to read it all but you know what all at once I'd find something it would be going along so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and all at once you read it and all at once it' say and God saids it so and so and then it goes back to so and so but got so and so well that's what I'm trying to get you to see here and the Lord said unto the serpent now he's cursing the serpent dust I eat and all the things talking about that he done talked about Adam and him or comes on down to and right in the middle he said I'll put enmity he injects right in the middle of seemingly an outstanding place to put it and he injects but I'll put enity between thy seat and her seat promises the coming Messiah to not just atone sin but to AR iate it then as I was quoting it last night to the at a fellowship meeting I love the way the prophet explains things it's wonderful amen he said there they were going out of the garden the bloody skins flopping on the legs of Adam and Eve and said as they started out the gate said he looked down from Love and said he saw them going out of the garden they had the atonement but that's all they had they had the covering of the Skins but that's all they had and he said as they started going out of the garden said love wouldn't let him stand it wouldn't let him just stand there said he screamed out as they were going out I'll put enmity between thy seed and her seed I promise that I'm coming cuz he said listen I got to quote on he said I'm going out with you he never stayed in the garden he come right out of that Garden amen and went with mankind oh I love the prophet saying this he said even though in all of the sin of Israel he said God busied himself daily right among the children of Israel no matter how much they sinned he was still there it's a beautiful picture that's right now listen folks what am I trying to say and I'll end it everybody wants to according to Paul or which one of don't say that God's up in heaven got to go up and get him down here got to go down and get him he said he not thee in thy heart and in thy mouth the word of faith that we preach that if th sh confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ what right God's not up in heaven today that's right am I'm not trying to go to heaven right 40 years ago I saw something I ain't trying to go to heaven sister Gil cuz God ain't up there right where's he at he's right down here I want to be where God's at he down here in you and I going to heaven is a Rapture benefit he's coming back after not me that's right he's coming back after what's inside of me which is his own self I just get to Ride Along in what we call a Rapture what did the prophet say he said we just simply turn around right you don't read them this temp to turn around and be right here where's the Saints 20 ft at a slant now brother wanted me to figure that out one day I said how can you figure that out sled which way right left I wouldn't want to go down but 20 ft away at a slant you mean all of those Saints that's died is you know this is 24 ft they're only that distance from us yeah but what another dimension right but you see God's not up in another dimension come on musician God's not up in another dimension he's right here in you and I he's not up in heaven that one should go there Paul said he's not Thee I heard that scripture preached in in Ro what is it in Romans that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth and believe in thine heart I heard that preached so many times by so many different preachers and the Baptists and methodists and everything else churches I got where I didn't even like that scripture I'd turn over when even read it until I seen one day what it's saying God is not up in heaven putting this together with this over here and just Bray it all together God's not up in heaven for us to have to go there he's not down in the grave for us to have to go down he's not thee he's in thy heart and in thy mouth the word of faith that we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved with a what heart man believeth unto salvation or it goes and and with a mouth confession is made unto Sal way goes on in becomes a beautiful picture amen Adam wasn't going to leave us I mean God wasn't going to leave Adam in the garden too many things were said he'd already given him eternal life Y and he gave him the coats to cover him as an atonement then he gave a promise right amen but I'd rather have a promise from God than all of your okays you know I mean you can pile this bullet building full of money remember when I was a kid they told me how big of a place it take for a million dollar bills to be put in I thought man I'll never see a million dollar bills you know but you can pile this building full of money what good is it give me God's promise I'll be with thee I'll never forsake you to the ends of the Earth You mean you're scared of what's going on in the economy today and all of the things no I just want to be what he wants me to be all right what is the seed of the woman why does it say that well it's the seat of the woman she don't have a seat right all right so that means we'll picking up his seed what God has to give her a seed righten right yep and that's why she said to talking about when Seth come along said God hath appointed me a seed instead of Abel that Cain slew appointed Isaac was not the seed of promise right he was the natural seed of Promise Christ was the seed of Promise Isaac just spoke of it Christ is the woman the seed of the woman right amen but I will give you a key he's not through with that yet that seed of the woman is not into full manifestation yet that's right I will say that no more think on these things let's stand see church it's been hidden from the wise and prudent that's right yeah but Brother D you say them people I ain't never said nobody's lost you show me the only one is lost is someone that'll turn down the word of God now when we turn down the word of God that's our own free moral agency right don't you think God knew what Cain would do don't you think God knew what Abel would do don't you think he knew what Esau would do what Jacob would do what then can you blame him for what they done no and we can't blame him for what we do so and and we don't even blame Adam and Eve that's right for what took place we reach the age of accountability we start dealing with God ourselves right think on these things what we got brother Lord is my strength the joy of the Lord is my you have a need glory the lord Lord is my strength the joy of the Lord is my Str he in the word of God is even in th the word of faith isy even in th the joy of the Lord is my he my heart with laughter does he my heart with laughter he fills my heart with laughter the joy of the Lord you're dismissed just sing that to one another as you leaveing of the Lord even in Word
