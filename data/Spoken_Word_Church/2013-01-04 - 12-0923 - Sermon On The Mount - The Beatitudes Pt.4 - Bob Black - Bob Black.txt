========================================

William first named William his mother and father is in the message over in wherever it is and he's moved over here and just heard of the message a little bit so he didn't know we were here all right Matthew 5. Matthew okay this is this will be a little bit short today so we'll have plenty of time for upstairs and get ready to flip over to Acts chapter 2. so let's read through the Beatitudes Matthew 5 verse 1. and sitting the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them put this on and taught them blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Melissa are they that more for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be fueled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall seek God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revolve you and persecute you and shall say all men are of evil against you falsely from I see now all of these are the Bible is full of these promises of God that are promised to the believer and and uh we've got to if we'll believe these we'll fulfill all of these promises in our lives so let's uh kind of review the first four Beatitudes kind of show uh the character of the believer that's being called to a relationship with God the poor in spirit because you realize that you need something that you can't uh you can't you can't manufacture in yourself you begin to mourn uh and grief to the things of God and then the next you uh meeknesses you're willing to be taught and then you begin to hunger and thirst for righteousness the the requirement that God requires of all of us and then uh maybe a better title for this will be the uh the kingdom of heaven because now uh how can you really be merciful unless you've been shown Mercy today how can you be pure and heart unless God has given you something in your heart that makes you pure and peaceful and then uh you become uh just part of the it's a problem it's really a promise from God that if you have all of these attributes you're going to be persecuted and uh I think a lot of times if we don't get that Revelation that we're going to be persecuted that it can produce bitterness in us if we're not we don't realize that persecution is going to come and uh you know when the early saints were persecuted they counted as a as joy as a blessing and they rejoice when they were persecuted and that's how we should approach it remember God calling I can't do it morning for sin they're able to be led and long until we feel and now we're all hungering and thirsting for righteousness and remember we talked about when that first stage of the believer's journey it's like the Believers when they would come from miles around from all over the world they'd come they see that the temple looming over uh the Mount of Olives the Mount of Olives was the the path of the often most of the Blues would come in and just as they crested that Hill they'd come over and see the temple uh the the place they've maybe had long to see all their life and then they'd come into those five gigs come under Solomon's ports and begin to hear the word because they had come with a hunger and a thirst it only makes it Satisfied by God okay so let's see um that's the same Temple that Jesus said it won't be one stone left on another stripe there's nothing of that people anymore it's gone I was throwing some of these notes together last night let me figure out where I am um so let's kind of just to set the stage let's flip over to Acts chapter two to see how these four characters characteristics were manifested in the Believers that first heard the gospel preach when Peter and the disciples came out on the upper League I just kind of want to read through Acts chapter 2 verses 14. through 14 onward Acts chapter two let me go back to this slide think of think on these as we read through Acts 2 verse 14. so all the people from all around the world parthians and Meads and elamites and people from everywhere or outside when they came out and they accused of being full of new wine and then Peter was full of Holy Ghost and he started he launched into his sermon that produce these characteristics in all the men that were gathered all the people that were gathered that Day verse 14 but Peter's standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all you that dwell at Jerusalem beat us known unto you and hearken to my words so these are not drunken as he's supposing it's about a third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel so now maybe just kind of Imagine these these men are beginning to realize a scripture from the Old Testament scripture are being called for to put in their remembrance of what was taught in the Old Testament and they're beginning maybe to be convicted in their soul and realize that I all the uh we'll look at in a second to see what the Old Testament scribes had to say about righteousness that it was something that you did in yourself that Europe it was a moral code that if you get in yourself um be greater than all of your iniquity then you would achieve righteousness but these men on this day they're realizing there's something something that uh only comes from God and Peter is telling them is not your righteousness that's required but the righteousness that comes by faith laughs well these are not broken as you suppose seeing as what the third hour of the day or this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day he said God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see Visions in your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my hand meetings I will pour out in those days in my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders of Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come they shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be saved give me individual hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you of you that he yourselves also knew him being delivered by the determinative counseling for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands are crucified and slain now here we get to the point where now they're getting convicted and it's time to mourn right we the man that we thought we didn't realize what we had done whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it for David and now meekness and we'll get well we get down to their confession after Peter has been finished his in his sermon meekness is willing to be taught and now Peter's beginning to teach them from the word the Old Testament thing put putting things together so they can realize how the Old Testament scriptures testified and it's killing them aside for David speaking concerning him I foresaw of the lord always before my faith for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my feet my flesh shall rest and hope because that will not leave my soul in Hell neither will I suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thou has made known to me the ways of life thou shall make me full of joy with accountants men and Brethren let me freely speak on the year of the patriarch neighbor that he is both dead and buried in his sepulchers with us under this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn with a note to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before speaking of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left until neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus hath God raised up wherever we are we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed forth this which he now see and hear from David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand until I make that for the footstool they're full of all the house of Israel knows surely that God hath made that same Jesus who ye have crucified both the Lord and Christ amen now when they heard this the fourth one right they realized that they needed something that their own righteousness could not provide and they began to hunker and they said all right now teach me what do I need to do and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart instead of the Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do tonight and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins and that here's the promise if they had hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and then after you receive that Holy Ghost you will continue to thirst and righteousness as you're filled on up the statue of the perfect man the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that who are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call thank you so we're hungry and thirsty longer to be filled with his righteousness and um you know I was thinking it I was thinking of a little story that uh you know what we think that um you know Bible says press on for the market of higher calling and call so we can press on but we can't press our loved ones you can't could you imagine all the disciples maybe hurting everyone into that Temple you can't force anybody to hunger and thirst but God has to call me God doesn't push he pulls he pulls us through the three fools and it fellowship with him and I was uh just thinking about a little story that I tested him on that I heard years ago where this little sister um she had been praying she had a daughter and she was praying for her to receive salvation and one day they were in a uh they were in a church service and a camp meeting and um the the Holy Spirit was moving and the altar call had been made and people were coming up to be saved but the little girl was just sitting there and she wouldn't uh the mama was sitting next to her and she was praying that God would move on the scene and she this was wisdom she realized maybe they helped a little girl maybe she should leave the room so she left and went out and she was just praying that God would move would pull on her Heartstrings and something happened to that girl and she uh she said she felt there was nobody sitting around her but she felt my hand on her back slap her and push her forward and she went forward and uh and gave her heart to the Lord and that's um that's you know we can't push anybody but God ain't pulling yes sir and uh amen I I was just I've seen so many times how if you're really if you can get in a sincere desperation and pray for your loved ones believing that God will God will pull them he'll do it he'll because it's a promise that it's a promise unto you and to your children and all that are far off and uh a little far along we'll get in the house all these promises of God is is becoming to us to fulfill every promise every word in the Bible and especially in this last day amen so Philippians 38 of 14 we were reading about um getting into hungry and thirsty for rightness righteousness and uh Paul City eggs outlets and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and you counting but done that I made with Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness another law but which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I'm not attain the resurrection of the Dead so what is righteousness and I was just looking up the history of of where this word righteousness in in the Old Testament the word righteousness was translated by tendo the original was uh this word called said and uh there's this old uh scholar that the Jews highly regard from my name is who said said it was or a Sadiq was one whose marriage surpasses his iniquity so that's good how can your own career pass your iniquity and that's the Revelation that this Jew these these people from all around the world on the day of Pentecost when Peter came down he preached him a sermon that's your own Merit will never surpass your iniquity that you need something that only God provides is his righteousness amen and uh then down through the the gothic translation and so forth that that word began to be written as write-wise right-wise and Tyndale translated it as righteousness and that the word righteousness actually came from William Pennell he he was the first to use that and then he used righteousness to translate both acidic in the Old Testament and to chaos in the New Testament which means um that that had a people use that and a lot of ancient writings to mean things like holy person like the uh um The Maccabees were said to be the chaos because they were they were revered as holy people and uh in Stones it says your righteousness is being approved by God or wholly conformed to the will of God Amen let's see what um and Jeremiah Jeremiah said behold this is where uh look at that word acidic and Jeremiah we've got the word Jehovah behold the days come and saith the Lord that I will raise up to you unto David or righteous pranks when the king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgments and Justice in the earth in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness which is when the old Hebrew is Jehovah because he is our righteousness amen 1933-15 and Jesus saves me said unto him this is when he came to John to be baptized and John said I need to be baptized with you and Jesus said he suffering to be so now for unless it become with us to fulfill all righteousness but then he suffered him and I just take a little a little break and find out why did Jesus need to be baptized amen let's go back to Exodus 29. okay this all has something to do with us that's right because Jesus had to fulfill on a license for seven weeks in Exodus 29 verse 1 through 8 start at verse one and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallowed him the minister under me in the priest's office take one young bullet and two rounds without blemish blemish and unleavened bread and cakes unleavened temperate oil and Wafers are living Anointed with oil of Wheat and flowers shall not making and thou shalt put them into one basket and bring them in the basket with the Bullock and the two rails and Aaron and his sons Thou shalt bring into the door or the Tabernacle of the congregation that shall wash them where you are because the high priest must be washed with water before it can be anointed just like our journey we've got to be washed with water and then the anointing the baptism of the Holy Spirit goes on us the anointing Came Upon Jesus to enter into his ministry at the River Jordan but before that could happen he had to be washed with water to fulfill the word and to meet every requirement of the word verse 5 Thou shalt take the garments and put up on air in the coat and the robe of the ephod and the ephot accessibility with the Curious girdle of the e-file and thou shalt put the minor upon his head and put the holy crown upon the miter they shall they shall thou take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him so first the high priest was washed and then he was anointed outside so that's why Jesus when he said we've got to spill all righteousness and Bud random said in 1961. I'm jumping the guns let's get back so um I I was listening to the sermon that come with us to fulfill our righteousness and brother and went through the story of Noah how he um John came with him with a word told him exactly what to do with his life and he his his whole objective his whole goal in life was to fulfill what God had spoke for him to do so he went and he uh despite everything that the world did he um you build an art even though the whole world calls him call him crazy and when that art was built he fulfilled God's word for that day amen then he eat it God gave him a revelation of how to escape the natural plane and he built a pyramid and Bill Branham told the story about one day he uh just his wife and his children goodbye and he took a stroll a little bit different than he has any scroll that he had taken before and he walked on off the Earth because Enoch was fulfilling his righteousness for his day he was fulfilling God's plan and then Daniel think about how he was tested to uh the king he said well you're gonna have to eat the slop off the king's table you're gonna have to eat all the Pig stuff and everything that God's word forbids you to do and he said well you just feed us Feed Us vegetables and things that are Kosher and uh because he fulfilled the righteousness that he fulfilled God's word for the day he ended up healthier than the rest of them eating all that slop off the King's Day and uh in this sermon he was telling all these stories and right in the middle he got word that his mom was dying I think this you know everything just happens for a reason when he said all right they sent word for me to pray for Mom right away I'm about to stop and just say pray for her now doctor just left all right now Lord Jesus I'm standing here that's my mother if she's going I can make her soul into the hands of God but here's a message that's got to go all over there's a living here that's got to die you've got the Lord I'm yours in Jesus name it's becoming to us it's becoming to me now that I fulfill all righteousness God's word comes first no love like like God's love so it's just so beautiful you know right in a new life ceremony he gives us a just a a great example of putting everything else everything else in the world aside that God's word comes before everything else even his mother dying and uh so let's stop right there upstairs wow next Sunday Hey listen while y'all were listening to the Daniel 70 weeks this morning write you some questions if you got questions write them down and either dad will try to answer the next Sunday morning we will try to answer them down here but write your questions down if you have questions thank you okay I don't know about that you ever saw that I think it tastes good yeah but it's not something
