[8:34] thank you for the day and the hour that
[8:36] we have thank you for you and we pray
[8:38] now today that you would just come on
[8:40] the scene in our hearts and our lives
[8:41] and be Lord not just an onlooker but to
[8:45] be a preeminent one in each one of us to
[8:48] reveal yourself unto us because that's
[8:50] what we need more than anything you
[8:52] revelation of your word we love you and
[8:55] we thank you and you promised it that's
[8:57] not hard to pray
[9:00] when we can read so much in the word
[9:02] about how you promised in the end time
[9:04] what you would do so it's not hard to be
[9:06] able to do that yet you did say pray
[9:09] that the Lord would send laborers into
[9:10] the Harvest in Lord we just pray that
[9:13] you'd bless down God as we read your
[9:15] words you come and speak to each and
[9:17] every one of us and forgive our sins
[9:19] lead us in thine understanding in Jesus
[9:22] name amen
[9:25] First Corinthians 11 and first Peter
[9:28] that have a brother and sister in there
[9:29] with us they've been here before so
[9:31] they're just getting welcome this man
[9:33] down with us because they're part of us
[9:34] amen right so let's think on these
[9:37] things first Corinthians 11.
[9:39] we've read this a lot because that's
[9:41] what we've been doing it's just uh you
[9:43] know
[9:44] taking these things that we see in the
[9:48] message some of the doctrines and things
[9:50] that we do not agree with and you know I
[9:53] might get around to find something
[9:55] matter why we do agree with it but not a
[9:58] whole lot of don't agree to get them out
[10:01] of the way okay but let's read our
[10:03] scripture First Corinthians 11.
[10:07] 17
[10:11] well 18-4 first of all when you come
[10:14] together in the church I hear that there
[10:16] be divisions among you and I partly
[10:18] believe it
[10:19] for there must be
[10:21] also herishes among you why why is God
[10:25] going to let heresies right you know
[10:27] divisions splits problems right come
[10:32] that day which are approved may be made
[10:34] manifest among you in other words we're
[10:37] going to see it's going to stay with the
[10:38] truth right all right
[10:41] first Peter 3 15. but sanctify the Lord
[10:44] God in your hearts and be ready always
[10:46] to give an answer to every man that
[10:48] asketh you a reason and a hope that is
[10:51] in you with meekness and fear and you
[10:55] maybe see that the Lord had his Blessing
[10:57] to the reading of the word
[11:00] now
[11:01] don't let me get
[11:03] everybody remembers twin brother uh
[11:06] Solomon Jacob the brother there was the
[11:10] Israeli citizen you know you know I
[11:12] think he was from Egypt or somewhere
[11:15] over with Iran or something anyhow he
[11:17] was and then he but he was a Jewish
[11:19] right you know his daddy was like a Jew
[11:22] his mother was a one way or the other
[11:24] you know and so he had enough to be able
[11:26] to be a Jewish Citizen and you remember
[11:29] he was going back there when he left
[11:32] from here and he sends us a little note
[11:34] of thank you for all of our prayers and
[11:37] our support to him and all brother
[11:39] Solomon Jacob and there is some pictures
[11:42] if you want to look at them brother Joe
[11:45] has some downstairs and and all and he's
[11:48] thanking each and every one of us for
[11:49] the time because they do at this time
[11:51] have a message Church there in Israel
[11:54] you know I know that maybe some of the
[11:57] others said well we've been there first
[11:59] but I don't have no argument about that
[12:01] I'm just telling you there is a message
[12:03] Church started an official recognized
[12:06] and where they could rent a building and
[12:07] be able to you know to take care of
[12:10] things so you know we appreciate that
[12:12] and just pray for him that was their
[12:14] main point we have to pray for him okay
[12:17] now we've been covering some doctrines I
[12:20] said we would try to
[12:22] to cover a few things that I know the
[12:25] doctrines among the people of the
[12:27] message that that we don't agree with
[12:30] and and then tell you why we don't agree
[12:32] with it because it's not to just say
[12:34] well name a Doctrine I don't agree with
[12:36] that name a drunk I don't agree with
[12:38] that you know that doesn't answer any
[12:41] questions or any thoughts so forgive me
[12:44] for being maybe sometimes even taken to
[12:47] one whole service on a Doctrine to be
[12:50] able to express to you why I don't
[12:54] believe it like that and maybe you may
[12:57] have heard of these doctrines and I
[12:59] always put this on there that number one
[13:01] is that this is the best that I know of
[13:05] of what I have heard myself
[13:08] and things I don't try to take too much
[13:11] secondary information
[13:12] I try to find out myself what somebody's
[13:16] talking about is when I'm listening to
[13:19] somebody and I have listened to some
[13:21] women as many as 10 or 11 messages to
[13:24] myself to be able to understand it and I
[13:26] don't listen to try to find their error
[13:28] I listen for their thought and intent
[13:30] and naturally the error will show up
[13:33] right if you have the Holy Spirit right
[13:34] all right and number two I I know that
[13:38] once we would say name something that
[13:41] there's so many different groups that
[13:44] are divided off about those thoughts and
[13:47] everybody would not agree with all of
[13:49] the thoughts that maybe a certain
[13:51] brother brought of a certain message and
[13:54] I'm staying away from naming the names
[13:57] but like I said if you contact me later
[14:00] about it I will personally tell you who
[14:03] follows this this this this as much as I
[14:05] know all right not to be derogatory or
[14:08] hateful or arrogant or whatever and we
[14:11] covered uh starting out with the two
[14:13] Souls the doctrine that started many
[14:16] years ago and then we went into the two
[14:19] Lords and then we went into the one
[14:21] that's coming or come out later about
[14:24] the people that believe Jesus wasn't God
[14:26] until the River Jordan you know and the
[14:29] things of that order and showing you why
[14:31] I don't agree with those things amen
[14:33] then we went through the one called the
[14:35] seventh under virtues and covering that
[14:39] that we don't agree with on that point
[14:41] or what they're trying to make and then
[14:43] we went through the one that was called
[14:45] the no Holy Ghost Doctrine in other
[14:47] words you don't have the Holy Ghost
[14:49] today like they did on the day of
[14:51] Pentecost and we went through that
[14:53] trying to express it now this past
[14:56] Wednesday we covered of a doctrine that
[14:59] is prevalent among the people of the
[15:01] message the ministers that brother
[15:03] Branham was the one that came to John on
[15:06] Atmos
[15:07] to deliver to John the message and I
[15:11] showed you why did I didn't believe that
[15:13] because first off surely no one would
[15:16] believe that that was the literal body
[15:18] of brother Brown that would come to John
[15:20] on Patmos because that would be total
[15:22] pre-existing right and that wouldn't
[15:24] work out at all but I'm sure there are
[15:27] some people that believe that no all
[15:31] right but then they some believe it was
[15:34] this way and some believe it was that
[15:35] away and I just showed you what I
[15:37] believe
[15:38] because even if you believed that
[15:41] brother random did come to John on
[15:43] Patmos to deliver you got to remember
[15:46] that that is the writing of the word
[15:48] that was the emphasis I tried to make
[15:50] Wednesday that is the writing of the
[15:53] word right
[15:55] because it was coming to John to rock
[15:57] John was described someone claimed to
[16:00] John and John wrote that's the writing
[16:03] of the word right I'm not as concerned
[16:05] about who's writing the word right it
[16:07] doesn't matter to me what it would be
[16:09] Matthew Martin Luther John or Paul or
[16:11] Peter or whatever that would write it or
[16:13] John you know it the my my main point is
[16:17] I want to know what God Said Amen I want
[16:19] to know what the spirit has to say
[16:21] because that's my my way of doing it and
[16:24] that's why I put it that way that the
[16:26] writing of the word was what would be
[16:28] dealing with in the Bible but we want to
[16:31] know who come to run around right to
[16:34] bring us the Revelation amen off the
[16:37] message of an hour and then we're going
[16:39] to try to tie this message today kind of
[16:41] in with it to to show you a little more
[16:44] you know about what we're talking about
[16:48] all right and uh you know if you differ
[16:51] that's fine that's what you believe I
[16:54] just plainly tell you what I believe you
[16:56] can't get most of the ministers to tell
[16:58] you what they believe they want to kind
[17:00] of play around a little to where that
[17:03] you know they can flow with you or
[17:05] whatever and they need to be in this
[17:07] group and right you know maybe in this
[17:09] group and you know they can kind of I
[17:11] just can't do that that's why I couldn't
[17:12] never be an evangelist right you know
[17:14] because eventually I yeah I mean it's
[17:19] like I've always said how can I go
[17:21] appreciate anything
[17:22] all right if I preach on one God it's
[17:24] contrary to a lot of the people in this
[17:26] message I preach on serpent seat it's
[17:27] contrary to a lot of the people of the
[17:29] message
[17:30] on the marriage and divorce it really
[17:33] would be contrary what a lot of people
[17:35] would think but you know but I just
[17:38] still try to do the best I can and you
[17:39] forgive me you know and pray for me
[17:42] because that's what I want to do because
[17:43] I'm not pastoring the world unless
[17:46] people may be listening today and we
[17:47] will listen to this on the internet
[17:49] sometimes you know but I'm not your
[17:52] pastor you must have a pastor to pay
[17:55] your tithes to because that's where the
[17:57] Prophet says you pay your tithe where
[17:58] you get fed right and you know we do
[18:01] have one that sends in kind that does
[18:04] listen you know but outside of that
[18:06] that's the only one that sends in their
[18:08] tithes uh monthly and I don't ask for no
[18:10] money from anybody period about anything
[18:13] whether they're tapes or whatever they
[18:16] are they're sent out free of charge
[18:19] about 180 or something the other day
[18:23] mailing out to some overseas people you
[18:26] know because we want to do that and let
[18:28] them hear what they if they want to hear
[18:30] it's out there
[18:31] you know it's out there if you want to
[18:33] hear it don't forget it right turn me
[18:35] off that's no problem but pray for me
[18:37] amen that's the main thing pray for me
[18:40] you know and that's my point all right
[18:42] now let's tie this in kind of with
[18:46] the point because of what I said about
[18:49] that you know I do not believe that
[18:51] brother Brown came to John on Patmos
[18:54] because you would be getting too close
[18:57] into another doctrine that followers
[19:00] right after that
[19:02] is that there's a lot of people in the
[19:04] message believe that brother random was
[19:05] God
[19:08] now there's many forms of that right
[19:10] some would say deity yeah
[19:13] some would say Christ
[19:16] some would say this away or that way so
[19:20] you understand what I'm saying you know
[19:22] I'm trying to cover my point but yet
[19:25] also out there say well okay uh my
[19:28] brother my pastor doesn't believe he's
[19:30] God he believes he's Jesus well that's
[19:33] yeah
[19:36] that's gone
[19:38] amen and uh you know I gave one they can
[19:42] go ahead and put it up on the 1am on
[19:44] doing but I don't know who we got on the
[19:47] board back there today I don't know
[19:48] who's missing because we got someone
[19:49] swapping about I'm glad of that that
[19:52] they are swapping out into
[19:53] so it must be Richard and and Bob
[19:56] backyard today because that's the two
[19:58] heads I see missing Tom Richards in the
[20:00] corner so Bob may be back there by
[20:02] himself I don't know but anyhow here's a
[20:05] quote that we we say look someone say
[20:07] brother random is the son of man I
[20:09] thought the color fire was the son of
[20:10] man am I mistaken this is questions and
[20:13] answers 1964 823 that number two if
[20:17] you're looking in your books well that's
[20:19] a good question very good but I am not
[20:21] the son of man but a son of man there's
[20:24] quite a bit of difference Jesus Christ
[20:26] was the son of man the Son of God the
[20:28] son of man the son of David all right he
[20:30] was not wrote around him is not the son
[20:33] of man amen we do not believe that we do
[20:36] not believe that he was uh God right now
[20:40] you say well now we take this we'll pull
[20:42] it around into the right place and get
[20:45] it to the right order Moses sure was God
[20:48] to the people but when he stepped back
[20:51] he was Moses that's right right am I
[20:54] quoting brother Brown he was God as long
[20:56] as he was speaking but when he said back
[20:57] he was Moses all right let's get it in
[21:00] the right order and then we'll we'll
[21:02] believe it in the correct way look at
[21:04] the next one and let's see what brother
[21:07] Randall had to say what this is
[21:09] questions and answers book 3 1964 8 30
[21:13] in the morning service paragraph 88
[21:15] now run around could Jesus look like you
[21:18] are you be Jesus or something like that
[21:22] one steps of the word that's exactly the
[21:25] truth amen amen another sense of the
[21:28] word
[21:29] it's an antichrist amen that's right now
[21:33] that's the difference between right and
[21:35] wrong that's right okay and look how
[21:37] close it is to make me the person of the
[21:39] Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist
[21:43] see for that person of the Lord Jesus
[21:45] Christ is sitting at the right hand of
[21:47] the Majesty on high and will come again
[21:49] in great power and Glory but for his
[21:52] life that was in him being upon me
[21:55] and upon you who have him right it's
[21:58] exactly the truth amen and you become
[22:01] Christ amen remember my message on
[22:04] Messiah yes you see you are the word
[22:08] Messiah means the anointed one now you
[22:12] are if you have the Holy Spirit
[22:14] you become the anointed one so you've
[22:17] embarrassed all kinds of anointed ones
[22:19] all right now
[22:21] you become the anointed one I was up in
[22:24] Jeffersonville Indiana and a man was
[22:26] talking one day I told you this and he
[22:28] was talking about brother random being
[22:30] deity
[22:31] and I said well my brother I said I'll
[22:35] tell you what
[22:36] that's it uh
[22:38] I believe in deity right
[22:41] I should not believe anything all right
[22:43] but I said the way I believe it is and I
[22:45] pointed over this other brother and I
[22:46] said now I believe that brother right
[22:48] there with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:50] right yes the prophet of God would say
[22:53] it's the same as deity speaking and I
[22:55] believe that's deity right and I said
[22:57] now laying all things aside uh brother
[22:59] Brown's Ministry and the anointings that
[23:03] brought it you know that he brought I
[23:05] said putting that aside to the point
[23:07] that I believe then brother Branham was
[23:09] deity if we believe that he was a
[23:12] born-again Believer right amen because
[23:14] they were born again Believers amen I
[23:17] believe it that way every born-again
[23:19] Believers the Christ that's right all
[23:21] right but to make him he said the Lord
[23:23] Jesus Christ you see that brother
[23:25] naturally he looked at me and he said no
[23:27] I don't agree with you okay okay no
[23:31] problem you know because see he believed
[23:33] he was the Lord Jesus Christ right you
[23:35] know what's that people oh no no I don't
[23:37] believe he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[23:39] just God
[23:43] and I don't believe he's God I believe
[23:45] he's the Lord
[23:47] well I don't believe he's the Lord I
[23:49] believe he's a Christ yeah
[23:50] yeah but he's a greater Christ than we
[23:52] are Christ
[23:54] said outside of the ministry the the
[23:56] gifts and the callings that was in his
[23:58] life he was a born-again believer in the
[24:00] body of Christ right you agree amen if
[24:03] you wasn't then you're in bad shape
[24:04] right you know I mean you you know you
[24:07] have to believe that he was a member of
[24:09] the body of Jesus Christ amen that's why
[24:11] it made him as the the message goes on
[24:13] to show about him greater than all the
[24:16] prophets
[24:18] that's right amen now you realize we're
[24:20] going to get to that in a minute because
[24:21] the the second part of this see this
[24:24] part is do you believe that right around
[24:25] him with God or whatever you know and
[24:28] the second part we would be dealing with
[24:30] uh whether or not you believe another
[24:31] Prophet is to come all right see then do
[24:35] you realize that brother random
[24:38] now this is what I'm saying
[24:40] brother random we know would be number
[24:42] four of Elijah right Elijah Elisha John
[24:46] the Baptist brother Branham the two
[24:49] witnesses to Israel right one of them
[24:51] will be Elijah right so you agree with
[24:53] that yes now let's see if you agree with
[24:55] this
[24:58] brother Brown
[25:00] is the only one out of those five times
[25:05] that is in the body of Christ right
[25:07] right that's right that's right
[25:11] come on
[25:14] Elijah went in the body of Christ it
[25:16] wasn't there right
[25:18] Elijah wouldn't end the body of Christ
[25:19] all right John the Baptist was the
[25:21] introducer but he was not born again let
[25:23] me quote scripture the least in the
[25:25] kingdom is greater than John that's
[25:27] right right all right amen so then we
[25:30] know for a certainty that brother random
[25:32] was greater than all the prophets why
[25:36] even though Paul was a born-again
[25:38] believer
[25:39] and a prophet for his day right right
[25:43] you agree with that that's right
[25:45] that he was a prophet for his time all
[25:48] right
[25:49] but brother random was greater than all
[25:51] the prophets because he was a born-again
[25:53] believer
[25:55] in the body of Christ putting him into a
[25:57] great position
[25:59] that you'll find all of those quotes you
[26:01] know of saying with you know the
[26:03] greatest of all the prophets all right
[26:05] could I believe that amen but I don't
[26:07] believe he was the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:08] that's right
[26:10] you can call him to cry
[26:13] you can call it those things like that
[26:15] and that's fine as long as you keep it
[26:17] in the correct order yeah
[26:20] we do not worship brother brown right
[26:22] right
[26:24] but you know the Christ that is in you
[26:26] is the gods you worship right amen
[26:29] that's why he's your personal savior
[26:30] right amen I don't worship the god in in
[26:34] dick Anderson right right now that's our
[26:36] strong name wait a minute now we bring
[26:39] one God no get the point
[26:42] get the point
[26:46] worshiped that God right I worship the
[26:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[26:52] that way I don't worship brother random
[26:54] amen I thank God for him coming and
[26:57] bringing us a word and where would we be
[26:59] without you a bunch of garbage cans bad
[27:02] enough like it is right amen but where
[27:04] would we be but I do not believe brother
[27:06] random was gone no right Amen to the
[27:09] people right well we got quotes we'll
[27:11] bring all you quotes but just remember
[27:14] you got to come all together and he said
[27:16] if you make me the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:18] you've made me the Antichrist amen he
[27:21] said I am not the son of man
[27:24] I am a son of man right right all right
[27:27] amen amen now then in being that
[27:30] she did we put it in the correct order
[27:32] amen all right we put it to be now that
[27:35] he would be the greatest of all the
[27:37] prophets that's right because of him
[27:39] being a born-again believer in the body
[27:43] now listen not only a born-again
[27:45] believer in the body
[27:46] he came to the adoption right
[27:50] that's right you agree amen yes sir all
[27:53] right
[27:54] and then he went on to The Headstone
[27:57] right of adoption because that's what I
[27:59] believe adoption is right she didn't
[28:02] hauling them never reached that position
[28:03] of the headstone right nope okay right
[28:07] now you're short they never reached that
[28:10] position of the headstone but the
[28:11] prophet said that the stone hadn't come
[28:13] yet but in his ministry there's where he
[28:16] came right and I believe those seals and
[28:19] brother rand's message after the seals
[28:21] broke no there was a restoration all
[28:25] right now after The Shield's broke the
[28:26] prophet brought his message to the bride
[28:28] amen that is The Headstone to the bride
[28:30] right amen right so look at the
[28:33] positions you put him in right
[28:35] and how close is he said there while ago
[28:38] that you know that looks good
[28:41] and in a way that's right yep
[28:44] but if you want it the wrong way look
[28:47] what you're making amen
[28:49] an antichrist amen but in the correct
[28:53] order he's not the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:56] right he's not not the object to worship
[28:59] though amen even as we covered about
[29:02] Jesus in the Life part of the the
[29:05] message there was times even Jesus when
[29:07] he was here on Earth would not accept
[29:09] worship right right sure
[29:13] but there's times he would because he
[29:16] knew what they were thinking right right
[29:17] he knew what they were worshiping right
[29:19] he said worship God right well when they
[29:22] seen that was God he'd accept it right
[29:25] but when they looked at him
[29:28] he said don't worship me
[29:31] because that was not to the right order
[29:33] all right does anybody understand that's
[29:35] the way songs that's the way I believe
[29:37] I don't believe what a random was I no
[29:40] more deity
[29:41] than the least member of the body of
[29:43] Jesus Christ as far as the new birth
[29:45] right right amen now the the Gibson
[29:47] callings the position he was in the
[29:50] elevation that God brought him to the
[29:52] understanding of the word the the
[29:54] adoptions and the things like that sure
[29:57] put it into a higher order right amen
[30:01] and he's the one going to introduce us
[30:03] to
[30:05] all right wonderful thing to think about
[30:07] him being that but yet he's not
[30:10] let me state it again then I believe
[30:12] ever born again believer
[30:15] by the new birth is deity inside of you
[30:18] amen you're an anointed one you're a
[30:21] Christ right
[30:23] right you're a messiah
[30:26] but we're not the Messiah right right we
[30:30] don't worship the god in each and every
[30:31] other one of us because your God is
[30:34] personal to you right right man all
[30:36] right
[30:36] that way we keep it in the correct order
[30:38] amen all right so everybody understand
[30:40] what I'm getting at me
[30:43] maybe let's go on to the next part then
[30:46] to where that we can talk about it
[30:49] of
[30:51] we'll give a quote in a submit it but
[30:53] we'll just leave that note there we'll
[30:54] use it just a second
[30:57] do we look for another Prophet to come
[31:03] or do we look for another person
[31:06] you know human form being mortal
[31:11] no you you following me now human form
[31:14] being moral right
[31:16] and we look for another person to come
[31:18] is there scripture or quote from the
[31:21] prophet that there is another to come
[31:22] after him to the Gentiles right that's
[31:25] it
[31:27] now to the Jews there will be two
[31:29] witnesses right amen
[31:31] right and one of them will be of the
[31:33] spirit and prayer of Elijah all right
[31:36] but we're not promised to another
[31:38] messenger no amen
[31:42] your only promised
[31:44] the house seven Church ages right and
[31:48] you've got seven church-aged Messengers
[31:52] now we've been through that if you want
[31:54] tapes on it and things like that you
[31:56] still got to bring bread around them and
[31:57] as the one to introduce the Messiah
[31:59] right amen amen we agree with that
[32:01] wholeheartedly that's right but do we
[32:04] look for another prophet
[32:07] because there's a Doctrine among the
[32:09] people of the message
[32:11] when we went to Jeffersonville Indiana
[32:13] in 1968 I guess for the first time they
[32:16] were discussing Dorothy and who is to
[32:18] lead us
[32:21] who is to take over since brother Brown
[32:24] was gone
[32:26] right
[32:27] and you know that back falling back on a
[32:30] doctrine of what we were talking about
[32:31] the seven Thunders and running around
[32:33] saying the thunder was the voice of God
[32:35] when the seal broke
[32:37] it's not just Thunders that are
[32:38] thundering out to our lives right that
[32:41] can take place right but it is the voice
[32:43] of God I believe there's only one voice
[32:46] of God for this age amen right that's
[32:48] right all right one messenger that's
[32:51] what Brethren said they don't believe in
[32:53] the one-man message
[32:54] all right now we're going down here in a
[32:57] minute and see if you agree with the
[32:58] rest of it but you can say well I agree
[33:00] to that point yeah
[33:02] that
[33:04] brother random was the last one promised
[33:07] right according to Malachi 4 Luke 17 30
[33:11] Revelation 10 7 etc
[33:14] etc then we know what he was to do all
[33:17] right but he was to bring us the message
[33:20] and there's not another messenger
[33:23] to come
[33:25] now I wrote this and if you don't agree
[33:27] with it anybody out there fine
[33:31] see these other doctrines that we have
[33:33] covered
[33:34] they were men that started those
[33:36] doctrines
[33:38] and those brethrens ever one of them
[33:41] about six times let's see one two three
[33:43] four five six
[33:46] or seven this is number seven where the
[33:48] number seven would have been uh the
[33:50] thought of believing that brother Brown
[33:51] was God
[33:53] you know that all of them say if you
[33:57] don't follow us you're out right right
[33:59] right right right
[34:02] now come on
[34:04] if you're not in their little click
[34:06] right
[34:08] you know they're little Doctrine
[34:11] then you're unwelcome correct right all
[34:13] right and see then wouldn't it be that
[34:16] they would believe that they were the
[34:17] messenger to come
[34:19] sure even to people straightening run
[34:22] around them out
[34:23] and saying run around was wrong
[34:27] and some dumb enough to even say that
[34:29] Jesus was wrong that's right and I'm not
[34:32] joking that's the doctrine of the people
[34:34] that believe that that Jesus wouldn't go
[34:36] out to a river Jordan now if you want to
[34:38] know later who's preaching they come to
[34:40] me and ask and I'll tell you right
[34:42] you might find out if somebody you'll
[34:44] honor yourself and thank their fine
[34:45] father
[34:46] it's nobody to get sellers hey man
[34:50] but I I'm telling somebody the other day
[34:53] I think it was Brother Gary I showed it
[34:54] to somebody the other day and it got
[34:56] funny to me
[34:58] and I'm sorry I'll just put this in oh
[35:02] I'm gonna say in Brazil
[35:04] I come to find out that they had had a
[35:06] big split over there and some groups
[35:09] that pulled apart they had a lot of
[35:10] people there was thousands of them and
[35:13] there's hundreds of ministers that were
[35:15] gathered together in trying to follow
[35:17] the message all right now and they had a
[35:20] big split
[35:22] well this group pulled apart
[35:25] and
[35:27] you know what brother Brown said he said
[35:29] I'm not against people but what they say
[35:31] he was against
[35:33] the system right right
[35:36] he said he went against people said he
[35:38] was against the system right
[35:41] well that brother when he told me that I
[35:44] started laughing
[35:46] because you know what happened I mean I
[35:48] was talking to the one side of the group
[35:50] I'm sure
[35:51] and you know
[35:53] but the other side that they pulled away
[35:55] which was hundreds of ministers and
[35:57] thousands of people following it they
[35:59] call themselves The System
[36:06] okay I put life in Portuguese so I done
[36:09] it in English
[36:13] I didn't want a lambaste anybody but I
[36:17] was giggling because brother Brown said
[36:19] he was against the system
[36:22] and they said they pulled away they was
[36:25] the system and so okay see sometimes you
[36:29] don't think about what you say and
[36:31] people were doctrines you know and the
[36:33] things they don't think about what's
[36:35] going on and somebody's thinking about
[36:36] listening to the system okay but but
[36:40] continue on
[36:42] now I believe that there was never to be
[36:44] but one send out Prophet to this stage
[36:47] amen that's right all right now
[36:50] in doing that I believe brother Brandon
[36:52] was the man to bring that message
[36:54] you and I amen and our total dependence
[36:56] is upon him to be who he declares
[36:59] himself to be so look at the number one
[37:01] that we got on the Note
[37:04] now this is not the the other arms get
[37:06] that out of the way
[37:08] all right
[37:12] so look what he says we've read this
[37:13] over and over and over
[37:15] Place 327 Church age book this message
[37:18] your Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 is
[37:19] going to do two things one according to
[37:21] Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[37:23] children to the fathers two he will
[37:25] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[37:26] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[37:28] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[37:30] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[37:32] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[37:33] the children to the Pentecost pathology
[37:35] exactly so all right now
[37:38] even some of them in their doctrines
[37:42] that
[37:43] you know they will agree to certain
[37:46] things
[37:47] they would agree to Malachi 4 to turn
[37:50] the hearts of the children back to the
[37:51] fathers and and uh and they will even
[37:54] agree that that God used bread around
[37:56] them to bring the the seals to us
[37:59] but see then they go on beyond that and
[38:01] they have their own doctrines and by
[38:03] having their own doctrines
[38:05] it automatically puts them as to be the
[38:08] leader
[38:09] it's like I told a man one day I said if
[38:12] you can straighten brother Branham out
[38:16] because that's what a lot of people
[38:17] Ministry believe I said put your big toe
[38:20] up here
[38:22] I said I want to kiss it
[38:28] you say well that's Catholic no no no no
[38:31] no no that wasn't what I was talking
[38:33] about I was talking about it anybody
[38:35] straight and run around them I would
[38:36] have to be almighty God
[38:39] if you straight him out
[38:41] not think you found the quote that was
[38:44] wrong
[38:48] where he said 700 instead of 7
[38:52] 000. and brother so and so corrected him
[38:55] on that
[39:01] one time and I heard him and said bill
[39:04] and I were talking about what the
[39:05] evidence of the Holy Ghost was
[39:09] I thought man you're mine yes
[39:12] smart but your brain is stupid
[39:16] that you could talk to a prophet about
[39:18] what an Evidence is
[39:22] that would be like me trying to tell
[39:24] Einstein
[39:25] how to split an atom when I can barely
[39:29] turn on the light or change the light
[39:31] blue
[39:33] right that's not a joke that's right
[39:37] if you can straighten brought around
[39:39] them out then we're supposed to be
[39:40] following you
[39:42] amen you was the one to be sent but I
[39:44] can't find it in the Bible where you
[39:46] used to be seen right man
[39:51] I I can find the word Malachi 4 Luke 17
[39:54] 30 Revelation 10 7 always to be
[39:56] connected to the seventh Church age
[39:57] messenger amen
[39:59] Israel God the prophet of God to our
[40:01] generation I can't find that right all
[40:04] right well I I can't find anything extra
[40:08] amen and this one used to be right down
[40:11] below us he's dead now I'm passing on
[40:13] this with him between him and the Lord
[40:15] but he believed that he was the one that
[40:16] run around come to introduce
[40:19] that he was the Lord they would run over
[40:22] in India way back a long time ago that
[40:24] believed that he was the Lord there's
[40:27] people that have been more closely
[40:28] related with us
[40:31] I say us okay let's believe they were
[40:35] the son of man and their people believe
[40:37] that the brother was the son of man to
[40:39] stand between the six and seventh seal
[40:41] for them
[40:42] so you know where that puts it closer
[40:44] yeah
[40:45] related to people that we know
[40:49] um right but see I can't follow today
[40:53] he brought a random wooden leaks on a
[40:55] man there is nobody else can leave this
[40:57] on a bank right and he said he was Ace
[40:59] on a man we just got through reading
[41:00] right right
[41:02] see you with Ace on a man that needs on
[41:04] a man came to right right sure you gotta
[41:06] house somebody a voice speak yes amen
[41:10] that's where we're going to and so watch
[41:12] what he goes on to say now in the next
[41:14] one look number two this is the
[41:17] 1963-11-16 the evening matching trip
[41:20] bring back the church to the word now
[41:22] what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to
[41:24] do restore back the original faith
[41:27] the resurrection faith that they've seen
[41:30] Jesus after he had raised the dead seen
[41:33] him walking or working among them now
[41:36] I'm looking for the resurrection right
[41:38] amen I'm wanting Resurrection Faith
[41:40] right this message would have to have
[41:42] the resurrection and message to raise
[41:45] you and I right because then brought
[41:47] around could stand there and say I am
[41:50] not the son of man I am a son of man but
[41:53] let these son of man come now and show
[41:55] you the resurrection because that was
[41:57] the sign that he had right run around
[41:59] had the resurrection sign given by the
[42:03] Lord Jesus he could not perform it
[42:04] himself he said I'm waiting on him man
[42:08] right but that was the resurrection sign
[42:11] now I don't know of any other sign after
[42:13] then right I've studied this message for
[42:17] 40 something years now and studied my
[42:19] Bible for over 60 years
[42:22] no and in doing that I can't find these
[42:25] things
[42:26] all right that people speak of
[42:29] you know somebody else to come all right
[42:31] see because I'm not looking for another
[42:33] person
[42:35] our Prophet I use the word person right
[42:37] if some people would come along
[42:39] oh
[42:41] I don't claim to be a prophet
[42:44] brother they'll say prophets I don't my
[42:47] pastor don't claim to be a prophet
[42:51] he just claims to be the one to take
[42:53] over
[42:54] what should I use Percy or profit right
[42:57] now our thing amen okay okay so that
[43:01] gets in the nouns and pronouns you know
[43:03] person place or things all right all
[43:06] right now
[43:08] so we're not looking for another person
[43:10] a prophet or somebody lead us now you
[43:13] say no this is what I remember
[43:15] Jeffersonville you say
[43:18] but brother Dale Moses
[43:21] only led the people up to the land
[43:27] but Joshua had to come and take over
[43:29] right oh yeah
[43:31] and take them through and I agree with
[43:34] you that's exactly right
[43:36] all right
[43:38] but now who is the Joshua of this day
[43:40] right man all right
[43:43] all right so let's pull that up and just
[43:45] see who is the Joshua of this day so
[43:48] we'll just cover a few things and then
[43:49] we'll see what it's talking about
[43:51] this is the message adopted in 1965-18
[43:54] adoption which would be part two
[43:57] if you're using your books for the new
[43:59] new computer system
[44:01] did you notice Moe's just that great
[44:02] miracle performer that brought down
[44:04] Israel
[44:05] down through the land and brought them
[44:07] up to the promised land but did not
[44:09] Place their inheritance to them right he
[44:11] did not give them their inheritance he
[44:13] led them up to the land but Joshua
[44:15] divided the land to the people
[44:17] is that right and Christ brought the
[44:19] church up to the place to where their
[44:22] possession was made to them was given to
[44:25] them
[44:26] just a Jordan to cross but the holy
[44:29] spirit is the one who sets the church in
[44:31] order right the Joshua of the day puts
[44:34] the church in its order
[44:36] all right right now who is the Joshua
[44:40] this day the Holy Spirit right
[44:43] now the Holy Spirit had to have somebody
[44:45] to work through so brother brown right
[44:48] he brought the word that's what I was
[44:50] talking about of the the point of
[44:52] talking about that John and the brother
[44:54] around supposed to become the general
[44:55] patents
[44:57] that was only to bring the word to write
[44:59] it yeah right
[45:00] around him could only bring the word
[45:03] that God gave to him right
[45:05] right but he could not reveal the word
[45:09] oh the prophet revealed these things now
[45:12] you don't go too far there you're making
[45:15] him dead then don't realize what you're
[45:17] saying right yeah he could only speak
[45:19] the word amen God has to reveal it to
[45:22] you and I right amen the Holy Spirit
[45:24] then is through Joshua and sure Joshua
[45:27] placed him in the land that's right
[45:31] sure he did
[45:33] all right
[45:34] but now if Joshua is a is the Holy
[45:37] Spirit
[45:40] he said yeah let's run around could do
[45:41] something the other well I stopped
[45:44] deliberately how many he kept reading
[45:49] didn't wear a stop
[45:54] but the holy spirit is the one who says
[45:57] the church in order because Joshua today
[45:59] puts the church in his order giving to
[46:02] each one
[46:04] gifts
[46:05] places position
[46:09] and I worked right around and give us
[46:10] gifts
[46:14] nope come on
[46:16] read your profit
[46:18] he couldn't give us skills he couldn't
[46:21] Place us positionally
[46:26] God has to do that
[46:28] all right should we let around me then
[46:30] right and he is the voice of God
[46:33] speaking
[46:34] to the inner man that Christ had saved
[46:37] the Holy Spirit
[46:39] now Joshua placed them in the natural
[46:41] land now the holy spirit is placing the
[46:43] church positionally in the land that
[46:45] they're in the position that they belong
[46:47] in their inheritance right around cannot
[46:51] give us gifts
[46:53] no
[46:54] he cannot bless us in the body of Christ
[46:57] right all right look at the next one
[47:00] as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee
[47:03] in
[47:04] 1969-11 paragraph 228 looking down into
[47:07] the bottom you just read all before and
[47:09] see if it's right
[47:10] we're looking for the Joshua of this day
[47:13] which is the Holy Spirit to lead us to
[47:16] the land he has to speak through
[47:18] somebody
[47:19] come on Amen now all right he has to
[47:22] speak through somebody because he's a
[47:25] spirit right okay I've told you what he
[47:28] stole me now you believe and be healed
[47:31] come on
[47:33] yeah Joshua could speak through brother
[47:36] Branham right
[47:38] right
[47:40] but that didn't make him Joshua oh come
[47:43] on
[47:45] I I give
[47:48] you know
[47:49] things and I know that I shouldn't be
[47:52] that way but
[47:53] makes it man in this message that they
[47:55] believe he was Aaron
[47:57] to take over after Moses left
[48:01] now if you want to know who that is meet
[48:03] me later
[48:04] but yours too because you've heard of it
[48:07] he's supposed to be Aaron I said don't
[48:10] type me like that right because Aaron
[48:14] never made the promise
[48:16] I see you Mr Thompson right oh you want
[48:19] to yeah but just don't get me involved
[48:21] amen
[48:22] because I certainly don't want to be
[48:24] Aaron because he never made it to the
[48:27] promised land that's right that's right
[48:29] he didn't even get there later
[48:32] according to the profit I don't know
[48:35] maybe he did I don't know if it ain't
[48:37] sure that wouldn't like Moses and it was
[48:39] right all right but now listen
[48:43] so then who are we looking for who are
[48:46] you looking for or what is it to be
[48:51] thank you
[48:53] clean off my nose
[48:57] look at just letting off the pressure
[49:00] 1962 518 paragraph or E55
[49:05] and one day he went down to the Jordan
[49:07] of deaths crossed over the Jordan
[49:09] come back on the third day now who's
[49:11] that amen
[49:13] that's the Lord Jesus Christ right right
[49:14] okay
[49:17] bringing the evidence that there is a
[49:18] resurrection to the dead Hallelujah he
[49:21] stood in a fish
[49:24] he was with them for 40 days showing
[49:26] himself alive said handle me I'm not a
[49:29] spirit I'm a man flesh the moment what
[49:31] was he the Joshua of our time that's
[49:34] crossed the river of death
[49:37] and return back with the evidence
[49:39] not only that but he said whosoever
[49:42] believeth in me she'll never die and
[49:45] they were commissioned to go up in way
[49:47] and he was going to send them the
[49:49] earnest of their salvation
[49:51] eight minutes
[49:53] so then Joshua
[49:56] would not be brother Branham all right
[50:00] but God would use brother Branham as a
[50:03] symbol of Moses to bring the word right
[50:05] right
[50:06] and as with Joshua
[50:09] to speak
[50:12] and to Proclaim that word yeah right but
[50:14] he couldn't Cross Jordan for none of us
[50:16] right right
[50:20] so that's taking out two things at one
[50:22] time about the deities and the things
[50:24] and believing he's God putting it all
[50:25] together I don't set up with Brother
[50:27] John we were going another way that I'll
[50:29] bring this afternoon and I said uh we're
[50:31] gonna have to do a switching route here
[50:32] you know so we'll bring this message
[50:34] this morning and then we'll switch over
[50:36] this evening to the other one so we can
[50:38] all time together all right now
[50:44] now think about it
[50:46] could run around give us gifts any
[50:49] places
[50:50] could he Cross Jordan for any of us well
[50:55] could he raise for any of us right
[50:59] no all right
[51:02] Jesus was the only one and that's why I
[51:04] loved it because I used to have them Yep
[51:07] they're in my own understanding about
[51:08] years ago and I told you about it once
[51:10] it was brought forward
[51:12] and the Lord revealed it
[51:14] because you see the Lord Jesus went
[51:17] through everything for you and I right
[51:20] even to death to those who pass on
[51:24] go on and pass away Resurrection to
[51:26] bring them up yes
[51:29] and then a change in a moment the
[51:31] twinkling of an eye right yes that's
[51:33] right do us that are living right
[51:37] see that ain't what he covered it all
[51:38] right amen so we don't need anybody else
[51:41] to help us or whatever that way but we
[51:44] need somebody to express it to us until
[51:47] where we can receive it right now
[51:50] there's where the prophet of God came in
[51:52] and he brought the message
[51:57] he brought the message of eternal life
[52:00] check on the seals and and go after the
[52:02] seals and even read the titles of the
[52:04] sermon Christ the mystery God revealed
[52:06] who is this melted things that are to be
[52:08] future home
[52:09] all of them will cover eternity yes
[52:12] right that's right because he was the
[52:15] one to do as uh um who is it let's see
[52:18] uh Leviticus 25 8 right the day would be
[52:22] 7 7 49 but then in the 49th there would
[52:25] be a messing sound for a jubilee to come
[52:28] in the 50th and that's what exactly
[52:30] brought around and brought amen showing
[52:32] us all the way through the scriptures
[52:33] and he brought the message he got
[52:35] eternal life right amen right but he
[52:37] could not reveal it unto us
[52:40] I know that's contrary to a lot of
[52:42] people's thinking because they said he'd
[52:43] revealed to me now he the holy spirit is
[52:46] the only we gave it the other day Christ
[52:47] The Mystery of God's revealed look
[52:49] around and said the Holy Ghost is the
[52:50] holy spirit is the only revealer of the
[52:52] word Jesus said even my own life
[52:56] paraphrasing it from the future home
[52:58] that were brought around my Blues right
[53:00] where he was bringing it said even my
[53:02] own life didn't reveal that unto thee
[53:03] amen we're talking about Peter you know
[53:06] it's a daughter to Christ the son of the
[53:07] Living God Jesus said my own life didn't
[53:09] reveal that right the Holy Ghost is the
[53:12] only revealer of the word all right the
[53:14] father and the Holy Ghost have to be the
[53:15] self-stain one all right now
[53:20] but you say what brother Dale
[53:23] the prophet of God is now off the scene
[53:27] and we have his message
[53:30] all right
[53:32] and I stated over and over and over so
[53:33] I'm one more time with her I'm not
[53:36] looking for another Prophet I can't find
[53:37] it in the Bible right
[53:39] right amen right right but I can find a
[53:43] faithful Ministry amen amen in the Bible
[53:46] their position right and I don't read
[53:49] these things and do this to just cause
[53:51] of myself you know I didn't write the
[53:53] book right amen
[53:55] all right do you understand what I mean
[53:57] right I didn't write the book that talks
[53:59] about a fightful Ministry I I wasn't a
[54:01] prophet that spoke of a faithful
[54:03] ministry right man I just happened to be
[54:05] one that God can use and whether I'm a
[54:08] five-fold or a tenfold or what fold I am
[54:10] or no fold at all don't worry about it
[54:11] the dumb donkey told the truth right
[54:13] because this dumb donkey can tell the
[54:16] truth to you then glory in the truth
[54:17] amen is this y'all have a good time let
[54:20] those donkey go into hell amen
[54:22] that's why I'm playing I don't worry
[54:24] about it at least you don't have to
[54:26] sleep what's he talking about
[54:28] I'm talking about the truth I believe
[54:32] the five-fold ministry is here right to
[54:34] do is the prophet of God say it right
[54:36] amen right whether or not I'm a part of
[54:38] it is none of your business or my
[54:41] business the truth is what it is amen
[54:43] man it will not put you in a Rapture to
[54:45] know I'm part of the thoughtful Ministry
[54:46] it will not put you in a Rapture to know
[54:48] brother random what's wrong it won't put
[54:50] you in a Rapture to know that Jesus
[54:52] Christ lived come on
[54:54] but if you have a personal experience
[54:56] with Jesus Christ in your life that's it
[54:58] to bring you the new birth then you got
[55:00] something connected all right being you
[55:02] connected to the prophet of God Amen to
[55:04] be the only messenger of this age right
[55:06] bring the message to you and I yeah all
[55:09] right right
[55:11] but now you got to tie it right back
[55:12] down to the powerful Ministry amen
[55:15] right
[55:17] because if you don't talk to that where
[55:18] are you going to leave it right you're
[55:20] going to say what the man said years ago
[55:22] all God was he poured into Christ all
[55:24] Christ was he poured into brother round
[55:26] he died and took it with him we don't
[55:27] have nothing left
[55:29] you want me to quote that again where
[55:31] you make sure to understand it because I
[55:33] heard a man say
[55:35] he said all God was he poured into
[55:37] Christ all Christ he poured into brother
[55:39] Brown brother Brown died and took it
[55:40] with him we don't have nothing
[55:47] we're just waiting on the bus to pull up
[55:50] yeah well remember the bus
[55:54] in Gainesville doesn't pull up to where
[55:57] it used to pull up to so you better know
[56:00] where it pulls up
[56:03] because brother prakash straight me out
[56:06] on and he told me one time he said
[56:07] there's a bus depot in gangle I said
[56:08] there's no such thing
[56:10] I said I know when the bus was down bus
[56:13] depot was down into at the train station
[56:15] that's where it used to be you went to
[56:17] the train station down here on Railroad
[56:18] Avenue and you got your your tickets
[56:20] your bus go right there
[56:22] you should know oh brother Dale there's
[56:24] a bus station in Gainesville I said no
[56:26] that's not brother because I've been
[56:28] around here all the life I know when
[56:29] they closed it
[56:31] he said would you mind call this number
[56:39] he said you got to be one I got the
[56:41] number it's a game for Georgia
[56:45] I dialed it in I said where y'all at
[56:48] they said you know where the tractor
[56:50] place is up here in the middle answer
[56:52] the highway
[56:54] yep he said that's where we're at
[56:57] so my point is what go to the depot and
[57:01] wait down at the train station you're
[57:03] not gonna get anywhere
[57:06] you find out we're the best way
[57:11] and then you better sit down and wait on
[57:12] the bus because you might be like a
[57:15] brother was that we was hunting one
[57:16] night when he told me he was a
[57:19] kid's son he told me where he was at
[57:24] he said where's the bathroom
[57:28] man Danny wrote All Over The Core
[57:31] because we knew that was his last stop
[57:33] we went everywhere and we're running up
[57:36] down the road and I was asking these
[57:37] people you know where is the bus depot
[57:42] well
[57:43] did they come through here
[57:45] today before his I said well what's this
[57:48] about the petrol because see that's
[57:49] that's Fjord of them overseas you know
[57:51] natural you know except oh oh he said
[57:55] you're talking about the diesel
[57:57] station that are you talking about that
[57:59] great big place down on the petrol
[58:02] that's where they you know all the
[58:04] trucks stopped right we got to standing
[58:06] at the Retro telling me I'm hunting in
[58:08] the court all right so we got to get
[58:10] straight okay wake you up should make
[58:12] you a little
[58:13] listen now I wouldn't want to make this
[58:16] next statement so unless that brother
[58:18] around and make the statement
[58:20] number seven
[58:25] oh okay
[58:28] yeah number six
[58:31] this is 1965.
[58:33] 1205 things that are to be
[58:37] paragraph 14.
[58:40] but I'm very thankful for these open
[58:42] doors and I've had to go into and the
[58:44] inspiration is give
[58:46] do young men like your pastor here
[58:49] let's cause them as I'm beginning to get
[58:52] old and know that my days are numbered
[58:56] and know now that these young men can
[58:59] take this message and sweep it on in the
[59:02] coming of the Lord
[59:07] if it doesn't come in my generation
[59:08] which I'm hoping to see him I look daily
[59:11] for him and watch keeping myself
[59:12] prepared for that hour
[59:15] now
[59:17] he said these young men would take it on
[59:19] right
[59:21] and sweep it on to the coming of the
[59:22] Lord amen right okay from that must be
[59:26] the thoughtful ministry right right
[59:27] which we've been on to the coming of the
[59:30] Lord all right now in doing that
[59:33] it he said I'm beginning to get old
[59:39] you know in a group the ones that
[59:41] believe that Jesus wouldn't God to the
[59:43] River Jordan as we call it
[59:46] in that group there is a brother that
[59:48] made a statement one time
[59:50] he said brother Branham as he was here
[59:52] now said he'd be an old man
[59:54] but she was born like 1906. 6 1909 1990.
[59:59] all right what would that make him I'd
[1:00:01] make him a hundred and two or three
[1:00:03] years old so you wouldn't be an old man
[1:00:04] and his brother he made a statement he
[1:00:06] said
[1:00:07] if brother random was here he'd be an
[1:00:09] old man she wouldn't be able to preach
[1:00:11] and he said you know what he'd be doing
[1:00:12] he said I believe he'd be sitting on the
[1:00:14] front row listening to my pastor
[1:00:19] I don't think he'd be on that road
[1:00:22] not with that doctor sir I'm just honest
[1:00:26] now
[1:00:27] but that was what the man said right
[1:00:29] away with his master okay all right but
[1:00:33] I just don't believe I'd work out no and
[1:00:36] sleep right around the dumptation going
[1:00:37] on right
[1:00:39] so somebody's got to help us right
[1:00:43] and who is that in five four minutes
[1:00:45] right now according to Ephesians
[1:00:49] yeah
[1:00:51] according to Ephesians
[1:00:53] 4
[1:00:55] in there somewhere right it says it
[1:00:57] verse 11-14 if the Firefall Ministry is
[1:01:01] for the Perfection of the science
[1:01:04] all right
[1:01:05] now
[1:01:07] in that doing
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:10] a five-fold Ministry to carry us on
[1:01:13] right okay
[1:01:16] now let's see what brought around had to
[1:01:19] say about this thoughtful Ministry
[1:01:20] number seven on you know
[1:01:22] all right which would be
[1:01:25] sure as we would see Jesus 54 328.
[1:01:30] but you see
[1:01:32] paragraph or e35
[1:01:34] but you see God has men to build houses
[1:01:36] he has shown to preach the gospel some
[1:01:39] to teach God has said God has said in
[1:01:42] the church first apostles
[1:01:45] a prophet teacher
[1:01:47] teacher evangelists and Gifts of
[1:01:49] healings and working on Miracles right
[1:01:50] and so forth all for the perfecting of
[1:01:53] the Saints
[1:01:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:56] and forever now I ask you to show me I'm
[1:01:59] just honest now
[1:02:01] I want you to show me any word the Bible
[1:02:04] said brother Brown and was for the
[1:02:06] perfecting of the Saints
[1:02:12] I want you to show me brother random
[1:02:14] says that he and his Menace Troopers
[1:02:19] but yet he said there was a Firefall
[1:02:21] Ministry to do that
[1:02:23] take the message and sweep it on okay
[1:02:26] okay look at the next one
[1:02:29] Gibbs preached 1956 1207.
[1:02:32] E28 now we're in the church five
[1:02:35] officers Apostles are missionaries
[1:02:37] either one both the same word means one
[1:02:40] sin an Apostles prophets teachers
[1:02:43] evangelism pastors God sent them into
[1:02:45] church
[1:02:46] but because one would be an apostle
[1:02:49] the prophet couldn't say
[1:02:51] you're not in it
[1:02:54] are the pastor to the advantage of this
[1:02:56] or so forth
[1:02:57] but they're all little ones of God
[1:03:00] that's put into the church for the
[1:03:02] perfecting of the Saints okay so your
[1:03:05] Prophet is holding the point
[1:03:07] and I think of our word that a brother
[1:03:10] that there was a Doctrine that's related
[1:03:12] to us that we knew a whole lot about
[1:03:14] I'll say that so that makes it close to
[1:03:16] us
[1:03:16] that
[1:03:18] he elevated the prophet
[1:03:21] up and made him that and his people did
[1:03:24] and uh you know
[1:03:27] that's where I told him that
[1:03:29] you'd have to elevate all five of the
[1:03:31] thoughtful Ministry because I can't
[1:03:32] Elevate one right right you don't put
[1:03:34] them right and I said now beside that if
[1:03:37] you're going to quote let's quote right
[1:03:38] around correctly in the Bible
[1:03:42] I said the teacher the president
[1:03:44] nobody in the file form Ministry could
[1:03:46] touch the teacher and putting the word
[1:03:48] together
[1:03:50] that's right well of course you didn't
[1:03:52] like that
[1:03:53] because he thought he was the prophet
[1:03:55] above the powerful Ministry
[1:03:57] well I don't believe that
[1:03:59] I don't believe he's a prophet above the
[1:04:01] five four Ministry if I got time I'll
[1:04:03] get on down to a few more little things
[1:04:04] in here all right all right let's read
[1:04:06] on look at number nine again
[1:04:08] this is Macy's 1962 10-14 or more
[1:04:12] Insurance that's your perfect man
[1:04:13] remember last night don't try to take
[1:04:15] the other man in office and some
[1:04:16] evangelists some pastors or some teacher
[1:04:18] first perfecting of God
[1:04:20] does it read like that congregation says
[1:04:23] no the perfecting of what they honored
[1:04:25] out Saints who are the Saints the
[1:04:27] Sanctified one amen one started from
[1:04:30] down here going to the next one
[1:04:33] all right
[1:04:34] this is paragraph 405 and the statue of
[1:04:36] a perfect man God has set in the church
[1:04:39] Apostles prophets teachers pastors and
[1:04:41] evangelists all for the perfecting and
[1:04:44] bringing all these virtues into it for
[1:04:48] that Perfection of the coming of the son
[1:04:50] of God
[1:04:51] now I didn't make that statement
[1:04:53] you talk to him amen
[1:04:56] the powerful Ministries to do what to
[1:04:59] bring all these virtues into the body of
[1:05:01] Jesus Christ right
[1:05:02] foreign
[1:05:12] Ministry and take the prophet's message
[1:05:15] there's no problem
[1:05:17] you know there's no problem with the
[1:05:19] point
[1:05:20] of
[1:05:21] our thoughts about what it is if the
[1:05:24] let's see how does Paul say it
[1:05:26] um
[1:05:27] how can I hear without a preacher and
[1:05:29] how can he preach unless he be sent
[1:05:32] is that your scripture that's right see
[1:05:34] if he ain't sense you don't have to
[1:05:35] worry about anyway
[1:05:37] that's right he just gonna bring half
[1:05:38] Doctrine High Crews and his own
[1:05:40] doctrines and ideas
[1:05:41] but if you've really sin has the Holy
[1:05:43] Spirit why would he deal with anything
[1:05:44] other than trying to follow the
[1:05:46] prophet's name
[1:05:48] well could he come up with his own idea
[1:05:53] where could it be right couldn't work
[1:05:55] out that way right
[1:05:57] okay
[1:05:59] now that won't work
[1:06:01] those are all tied together into other
[1:06:04] things
[1:06:05] that I will mention I've got a few
[1:06:07] minutes and I will mention this one
[1:06:09] and we put it in here that
[1:06:12] you know because we're on the powerful
[1:06:15] Ministry
[1:06:18] that there's a lot of people believe
[1:06:19] that Joseph is a prophet
[1:06:23] okay
[1:06:25] I believe that too because brother Ryan
[1:06:26] said
[1:06:29] now
[1:06:31] I wouldn't believe it about somebody
[1:06:34] else maybe or me or something like that
[1:06:36] my brother didn't say it right
[1:06:39] I wouldn't believe it about some brother
[1:06:41] in this message to call his name because
[1:06:42] I never heard run around say it right
[1:06:44] right all right but he said Joseph was a
[1:06:46] prophet yep
[1:06:47] all right
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:53] I believe it's the prophet
[1:06:56] he said well all right now what are you
[1:06:57] going to do is he the one to straighten
[1:06:59] this out I don't believe if anybody
[1:07:01] needs to straighten this out right
[1:07:02] that's right amen amen I believe the
[1:07:04] message is right
[1:07:09] it's not for the five-fold ministry
[1:07:11] straighten out the message it's a
[1:07:13] message straight out the final four
[1:07:14] Ministry exactly amen
[1:07:17] well she didn't I don't believe that
[1:07:19] Joseph some believe it was God
[1:07:22] right yeah I don't believe that no no
[1:07:26] he can be the cross like we covered one
[1:07:29] ago if he's a born-again Believer that's
[1:07:31] between him and God but if he's the Cry
[1:07:33] he's a born-again Believer he's Christ
[1:07:35] that's fine that's right but he's not
[1:07:38] the Lord Jesus Christ no sir he wasn't
[1:07:40] the one that brought around him come to
[1:07:42] introduce run around him come to
[1:07:44] introduce Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:47] see not Joseph
[1:07:49] so then I don't believe Joseph could be
[1:07:51] anything other than a faithful Ministry
[1:07:53] Prophet right
[1:07:55] right now you have prophets in the bible
[1:07:57] elevated at that bit above the other but
[1:07:59] you got to be in a faithful Ministry
[1:08:01] form right
[1:08:03] you have an agabus
[1:08:05] is there petrified in the Bible has to
[1:08:07] be a prophet yes sir all right
[1:08:10] but where are you going to put him right
[1:08:12] angle but still had to answer to Paul
[1:08:14] right right well Paul was a major guy
[1:08:16] right right all right so then if Joseph
[1:08:19] did anything
[1:08:23] of a prophet it'd be only a powerful
[1:08:25] Ministry problems right
[1:08:26] how can you put him a six-fold
[1:08:29] how can you have him a prophet outside
[1:08:31] of
[1:08:32] what the file for Ministry is because
[1:08:34] there's no promise for it to come right
[1:08:37] and no problem for another Prophet to
[1:08:39] come
[1:08:41] I always used to say Samuel to hell and
[1:08:44] the other brother but I just put Samuel
[1:08:46] Dale because Samuel Dale ain't no
[1:08:47] Prophet to come right I never have said
[1:08:49] I was a prophet never thought nothing
[1:08:50] about it
[1:08:55] so I'm here said one time said you're a
[1:08:57] prophet it doesn't work come to you I
[1:08:58] said the word comes in spirit field
[1:08:59] don't start that business because you're
[1:09:01] going to drive me onto the field
[1:09:03] if I'm a prophet you I can't be your
[1:09:05] pastor that's right that's right I'll go
[1:09:08] to the field because that's all I can do
[1:09:09] that's right yeah I can't live the way I
[1:09:12] live and do the way I do and be that so
[1:09:14] don't get that in the ideals that's
[1:09:15] right right the word comes the spirit
[1:09:18] feeling the word comes to you if you've
[1:09:20] got the bad deals that is the profit
[1:09:22] amen all right now but see then I'm not
[1:09:25] against Joseph
[1:09:27] all ready for him right in no way
[1:09:33] I believe he's what brother Brown said
[1:09:34] he's a prophet yep
[1:09:37] he said well you don't have no quotes
[1:09:39] where he's a FireFold Ministry no but
[1:09:42] you don't have no quotes worry something
[1:09:44] outside of that yeah oh okay all right
[1:09:48] come on if you got him bring them to me
[1:09:53] what brothers I don't give a hoot what
[1:09:56] brother so and so say it
[1:09:58] I don't care about your private
[1:10:00] interview views with brother Branham if
[1:10:02] they don't match up or watch the books
[1:10:03] and takes right right
[1:10:06] I had a discussion the only discussion I
[1:10:09] ever had with Billy Paul was up on the
[1:10:12] basis that a brother had said he said
[1:10:13] something
[1:10:14] I called him
[1:10:15] the only time I've ever talked to him
[1:10:17] personally I've talked to it at meetings
[1:10:19] shook his hand Etc you know okay
[1:10:21] but I called him I said they're saying
[1:10:24] you said it
[1:10:27] he said I never said it
[1:10:29] I said well here's the name and the
[1:10:31] address and the telephone number I'd
[1:10:33] suggest you call the brother
[1:10:35] and tell him you didn't say that
[1:10:38] he did
[1:10:39] somebody did it all right
[1:10:41] because it was going into the wrong
[1:10:43] thing right
[1:10:45] the and I called another brother because
[1:10:48] it was about something about killing Too
[1:10:50] Much Game Etc and I said can you show me
[1:10:52] red around them ever killed gang for
[1:10:54] anybody else after the Holy Spirit
[1:10:56] convicted in mind
[1:10:59] he said brother there's a tail I said I
[1:11:01] don't care about your Tails
[1:11:03] I want to know
[1:11:06] get right around saying
[1:11:09] I know the tale they said they went two
[1:11:11] people went out hunting right around
[1:11:12] there with the brother and they had a
[1:11:13] tag it used to be different
[1:11:15] and they had a tiger each one and the
[1:11:19] tail was it brought around killed an elk
[1:11:20] for somebody else
[1:11:23] there's a whole lot of lost chains and a
[1:11:26] lot of things and you check into them
[1:11:27] you find out
[1:11:28] the one I wanted to check into was in
[1:11:30] Canada when blood around them told
[1:11:32] brother bisco brother bisco said the
[1:11:34] tech moves for Elk or something walked
[1:11:37] across the road and stood right there
[1:11:39] you said brother Ryan said he's yours
[1:11:41] kill him he said I couldn't find a place
[1:11:43] to shoot him which is close to him stand
[1:11:45] on the side of the road
[1:11:47] when I went to Canada that's the first
[1:11:49] question I asked to God
[1:11:51] now the dean knows that Wade knows it
[1:11:54] I said what's your laws
[1:11:58] you see you shoot right down the middle
[1:11:59] of the highway
[1:12:02] he said but you're responsible for what
[1:12:04] you shoot at right I said you mean you
[1:12:08] ain't got no rules about you got to get
[1:12:09] off the road he said no that's what
[1:12:11] Russell we'd probably killed a deer to a
[1:12:14] piece that we just sat out there on the
[1:12:15] side of the concert room back in there
[1:12:18] but when it's nice about it try not to
[1:12:20] do that come by that Brother Dean the
[1:12:22] last day when he went over there by
[1:12:23] yourself
[1:12:26] I'll check into things there used to be
[1:12:30] a lot of different laws there used to be
[1:12:31] what they call a camp meatball
[1:12:33] that if you kill something back in the
[1:12:35] old days you could kind of just count me
[1:12:37] and it wouldn't count it against your
[1:12:38] records there used to be laws like that
[1:12:40] well see I don't care nothing about it
[1:12:43] that's why I asked the brother I said
[1:12:44] can you show me brother Brown I'm never
[1:12:45] saying
[1:12:46] right I said first off you're arguing
[1:12:48] with God because he wrote around and
[1:12:50] said God told him not to kill it right
[1:12:51] and God said you kept your word that's
[1:12:55] right it's in the argue with him
[1:12:57] I'm sorry I'm blunt I know it but that's
[1:13:00] time to be blunt when you blunt I'm not
[1:13:02] hateful I'm blunt amen
[1:13:04] between the two I guess but not much
[1:13:08] but you understand I don't believe see
[1:13:10] these things I don't believe that Joseph
[1:13:13] there's no more than a powerful ministry
[1:13:15] right right and the body of Christ right
[1:13:18] amen but I believe he's a prophet right
[1:13:20] my brother run said he was
[1:13:22] all right
[1:13:25] see now I would if he come down here and
[1:13:28] I'd be glad for him to come
[1:13:30] but you don't want I'd be listening to
[1:13:32] what he said going the way his daddy had
[1:13:33] to say all right all right not according
[1:13:35] to what he thought all right
[1:13:37] because his daddy was speaking from this
[1:13:39] word I'm honest amen yet he was a man
[1:13:43] that's right yep he was gone
[1:13:50] those are your signs I believe and don't
[1:13:52] believe
[1:13:54] I don't believe there's anybody that
[1:13:56] comes straight and brought around
[1:13:58] because that's what one of the doctrines
[1:13:59] was that the son of man come to
[1:14:02] straighten out the prophet
[1:14:04] that that's what happened in the seal to
[1:14:06] the son of man came well who'd he come
[1:14:07] through
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:11] right
[1:14:13] come on
[1:14:15] well brother so-and-so he's different I
[1:14:18] don't give a dude
[1:14:19] I'm sorry no offense just playing right
[1:14:23] amen I believe there's one true in
[1:14:26] living God
[1:14:27] and he's the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:14:30] amen and I believe brother Branham he
[1:14:32] said if you call me let's say let me
[1:14:33] stay he said if you make me the
[1:14:35] Antichrist
[1:14:36] he said you're further away than he
[1:14:38] would if you made him Jesus Christ never
[1:14:40] spoke to that extent
[1:14:43] but then the other quote said what if
[1:14:46] you make him the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:14:47] make a man cry
[1:14:49] how could you separate a man that could
[1:14:51] stand and talk to you and just tell you
[1:14:53] everything that was going to happen
[1:14:54] that's like uh who was it um
[1:14:57] they could was either one one of those
[1:14:59] or theirs said you know how can you
[1:15:01] argue with a man when he can tell you
[1:15:03] where the fish is at when you're going
[1:15:04] to catch him yeah somebody told them how
[1:15:06] many fish did you catch that day you
[1:15:07] know
[1:15:08] see people got too close to brother
[1:15:10] Brown right
[1:15:13] because it got dependent upon them
[1:15:16] and that's what a lot of people have
[1:15:17] done about the ministers in this message
[1:15:18] yes sir there's people in this message
[1:15:21] that won't buy a Carly ask your pastor
[1:15:23] that's right
[1:15:25] they don't buy a house that's your
[1:15:27] parents
[1:15:28] they won't do anything to ask your
[1:15:29] pastor that's right
[1:15:31] well don't bother me back
[1:15:42] come on folks
[1:15:44] you're gonna ask the car dealer what
[1:15:47] kind of life
[1:15:51] there's no one man I'm putting this to
[1:15:54] the life the faithful Ministry
[1:15:57] but there's no one man in that powerful
[1:15:59] Ministry got any more Authority or
[1:16:03] doings or whatever you want to call him
[1:16:07] I've been all five of them yeah and
[1:16:09] that's right that's right that's right
[1:16:11] those are all five whether or not it's
[1:16:14] just a simple pasture of a church yep
[1:16:16] that's right he's still ordained of God
[1:16:20] he said your pastor ordained to lead you
[1:16:22] through now listen read the rest of the
[1:16:24] quote if these ordained people just
[1:16:27] don't read that my pastor ordained
[1:16:29] leading me through he's off the word
[1:16:31] well I think he's off the word but he's
[1:16:33] already leaving too now that anyone
[1:16:35] wrote around saying
[1:16:37] he said if your pastor's off the word
[1:16:39] get away from your pastor amen find you
[1:16:42] one that'll stay with the word right
[1:16:45] that's right no problem
[1:16:49] right
[1:16:51] I'm not your God right certainly don't
[1:16:54] ask me what color clothes to wear or
[1:16:56] whatever to do come in I am trouble
[1:16:57] enough like it is my wife lays mine out
[1:16:59] so if you're going to ask anybody ask
[1:17:01] her

[1:17:12] or whatever you know I try to be nice at

[1:17:16] and I think ought to be right amen I
[1:17:18] think we're to come to church in our
[1:17:19] good clothes and things like that but I
[1:17:22] did say one thing and I'll say this well

[1:17:25] them last night I said
