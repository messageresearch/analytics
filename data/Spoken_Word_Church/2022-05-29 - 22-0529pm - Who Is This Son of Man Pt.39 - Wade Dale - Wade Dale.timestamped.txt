[11:53] one
[11:54] for those of you who read it and uh want
[11:56] more detail i'm going to write some more
[11:58] of my story down
[12:00] okay now the serious stuff
[12:03] it's a testimony and i want you to see
[12:04] how intricately the lord works
[12:08] can you hear me nanny okay
[12:10] okay that thyroid nozzle i talked about
[12:12] the last time i sang
[12:14] that started back in february when i
[12:16] went to my ent we did an ultrasound
[12:20] and we did the biopsy poking you in the
[12:22] neck to get that tissue out of there
[12:25] the nodule when it gets to be four
[12:27] centimeters they want to do surgery
[12:30] so i go to my ent
[12:32] who had already referred me to a
[12:34] specialist
[12:35] in augusta
[12:37] one of the top five surgeons in the
[12:39] country to do this surgery because it's
[12:41] risky and i had taken radiation back
[12:43] when i was 20 something
[12:45] so i go to him on friday a week ago and
[12:48] he walks in and he says
[12:50] have you met dr terrace
[12:53] and i said no
[12:54] he said why not
[12:56] i said because this is their procedure
[13:00] he said really i don't like that
[13:02] procedure
[13:03] you should meet whoever is going to be
[13:05] cutting on you before the surgery they
[13:07] have something called one stop surgery
[13:09] down there now
[13:11] and you go on monday
[13:13] meet him do your pre-op and then you go
[13:15] back on tuesday and have the surgery
[13:18] so that told me
[13:20] hmm
[13:21] the gift that the lord has given me
[13:24] put the brakes on
[13:26] so that's what i did
[13:28] and i'm a natural girl in case y'all
[13:30] didn't know that i'd rather go the
[13:31] natural route to find something to
[13:32] resolve a problem for example i had
[13:35] abscess i went to the store and got
[13:37] garlic started putting garlic on there
[13:38] my girlfriend was amazed in two days it
[13:40] was gone
[13:42] okay so this time i said okay let me
[13:44] research how to shrink those nodules
[13:47] right
[13:49] spirulina
[13:51] cumin and ginger
[13:53] i started taking those okay let me back
[13:55] up so i canceled the surgery
[13:58] and i told my ent about it
[14:02] and i started taking this on last
[14:04] saturday

[34:41] was talking about this morning where
[34:42] brother adam talks in adoption he he
[34:44] tells us he said inheritance by
[34:46] predestination
[34:47] i inherited something what inheritance
[34:50] there had to be somebody leave me an
[34:51] inheritance why you say jesus left me an
[34:54] inheritance
[34:55] beg your pardon
[34:57] everybody still believe brother brown
[34:58] was a prophet we in the right place
[35:00] right okay
[35:01] he said beg your pardon jesus never left
[35:03] you an inheritance
[35:05] um
[35:07] jesus never left you an inheritance he
[35:09] never left me an inheritance
[35:12] wow
[35:13] he only came down and paid for your
[35:15] inheritance
[35:17] brought you to your inheritance but your
[35:19] name was put on the lounge book of life
[35:21] before
[35:23] the foundation of the world
[35:25] god gave you your inheritance your
[35:28] inheritance was first
[35:32] your inheritance was first

[35:52] anything eternal
[35:54] bless his little heart
[35:58] sometimes i do i'm like brother dale i
[36:00] feel sorry for the devil because he
[36:01] can't get saved
[36:03] he can't have this wonderful feeling
[36:05] that we have in our heart he tries to
[36:07] take it away from us
[36:08] but he will never have that peaceful
[36:10] feeling in his heart like me and you do

[40:34] the same time one time together and we
[40:36] won't have to wait on some of you that
[40:37] don't know what time is
[40:41] so anyway just saying i got to quit
[40:43] thinking out loud
[40:45] but god bless you we love you with the
[40:46] love of the lord let's let's start on
[40:48] who is this son of man this is part 39
[40:51] brother brother john
[40:52] okay 39
[40:54] i'm a little slow but i'm a southerner
[40:56] and we all are too so we're good
[40:59] but that's all right i looked online the
[41:01] other day brother donny was on number
[41:02] 200 and something on about the church so
[41:04] i'm i'm not i ain't got that far yet
[41:08] but when you're in a series you just
[41:10] kind of want to stay on it and if until
[41:12] the people get it and then when the
[41:13] people get it then we'll move on amen so
[41:16] this would be part 39 who is this son of
[41:18] man because our mandate
[41:20] we are not under the anointing of the
[41:22] son of god anymore
[41:27] they were in the church ages and some
[41:29] still are but we're in the dispensation
[41:32] of the son of man when god is to be
[41:34] human flesh again and he's going to
[41:37] change your flesh he's already changed
[41:39] listen he started to body change
[41:42] when the 120 in the upper room got
[41:43] changed
[41:44] in their soul that started the change
[41:47] now we've come now all the way here
[41:49] because it wasn't their mandate it
[41:51] wasn't their box it wasn't their time it
[41:53] wasn't their anointing they didn't have
[41:55] the people here for it because god was
[41:57] waiting on me and you to be here
[42:00] me and you to be here in this building
[42:02] in this time to be alive
[42:04] to listen to the message of the hour and
[42:07] believe for a body change because it can
[42:09] and it will happen
[42:11] how many times have i told you i'm just
[42:13] dumb enough believe it's me
[42:15] and man and i just believe that with all
[42:17] god's help that we'll all get in there
[42:18] together amen don't kick any of them out
[42:22] amen let the lord deal with that so who
[42:24] is this son of man
[42:26] let's bow our heads i know we all have
[42:28] unspoken requests things on our heart
[42:31] lord thank you for this day that you
[42:32] give us
[42:33] i pray that you'll be with us now and
[42:34] the further in this service you do the
[42:36] speaking lord you be the one lord that
[42:38] doesn't reveal him because without you
[42:40] lord this would just be a meeting of
[42:42] like as a prophet god said it'd be a
[42:43] lodge just where we just meet and shake
[42:45] hands and and talk about the things of
[42:47] the world but lord let's just for a few
[42:49] hours lord just be under this umbrella
[42:51] of hearing from you lord and lord that
[42:54] we'll get something from you today lord
[42:55] that'll help us in the days to come
[42:57] father
[42:58] that we'll take this inheritance and
[43:00] we'll be able to use it lord
[43:02] you don't want that you don't want us to
[43:03] put it on a shelf the lord do you want
[43:05] us to use it and lord that's what this
[43:07] statue of a perfect man is for it's not
[43:08] a statue it's a statue
[43:11] it's something moving it's moving
[43:13] breathing
[43:14] it's you lord in human flesh again back
[43:16] on the earth
[43:17] in a bride in a mini-membered body and
[43:20] thank you for the lord giving us an
[43:21] opportunity to stand before that
[43:22] purchased possession
[43:24] thank you for the ones that are here our
[43:25] visitors now lord that are here and the
[43:27] ones brother john and his wife lord we
[43:29] praise you give them travel and mercies
[43:31] as they head back tomorrow whenever
[43:32] they're going back be with us tomorrow
[43:33] memorial day lord we want to
[43:36] we want to truly remember
[43:38] the ones lord that gave their life
[43:41] to make it where we can stand in this
[43:43] pulpit
[43:45] as of now a free country
[43:48] i know the united states is going to get
[43:49] what they're going to get but lord i
[43:51] wouldn't be living anywhere else
[43:53] this would be the only place i'd want to
[43:54] be right here right now lord and i thank
[43:57] you for the men and women that fought
[43:59] and gave their life
[44:01] for us to have
[44:03] this freedom that we have
[44:06] in the united states of america but lord
[44:07] this is nothing compared to that freedom
[44:10] that comes at the baptism of the holy
[44:12] ghost
[44:13] the freedom that comes when we walk into
[44:15] that city
[44:16] lord
[44:18] all we see is you
[44:20] you're the light of the whole city
[44:21] everything's lit up because of you we're
[44:23] even lit up because of you
[44:25] well lord let us have a little part of
[44:26] that today lord light this building
[44:28] father with your presence we asked your
[44:30] name in the name of the lord jesus
[44:31] christ that you do these things for us
[44:33] lord amen
[44:35] in the beginning was the word where it
[44:37] was with god and the word was god and
[44:39] the word was made flesh
[44:46] that word
[44:48] that was in the beginning was god
[44:51] and now that word
[44:53] was made flesh we know that 2000 years
[44:55] ago
[44:56] but what about today
[44:58] where is christ
[45:00] in his bride
[45:02] he's not on her he's not around her he's
[45:04] not hovering over her he's in her
[45:08] she is him
[45:09] so the word was made flesh when today in
[45:13] you
[45:14] 20 22 the word
[45:16] has become flesh and dwelt among us and
[45:18] we beheld his glory the glory of the
[45:19] only begotten of the father full of
[45:20] grace and truth you may be seated
[45:23] but we're all we read the scripture
[45:25] there in ephesians uh several weeks ago
[45:27] about being predestinated to adoption
[45:30] now there's a lot of people been
[45:31] predestinated to different things
[45:33] the church ages they had their anointing
[45:35] they had their time they had their
[45:38] characteristic and they had their time
[45:40] that they fulfilled that characteristic
[45:42] under the messenger of their age when i
[45:45] under the messenger of malachi 4 we see
[45:47] that we've moved to the
[45:49] son of man revelation
[45:52] all right now there's not it's not going
[45:54] to be
[45:55] during the time
[45:58] of the church ages that we see the son
[46:00] of man revelation
[46:02] the son of man revelation is god in
[46:04] human flesh for a body change
[46:07] all right we're we know we're all called
[46:09] out called out of the age
[46:12] we're not living in any age if you're
[46:13] born again
[46:15] you're living in eternity your soul is
[46:16] actually in eternity what a what a
[46:18] paradox is you're stan you're here
[46:20] getting older and we're getting more
[46:22] feeble and we're having more aches and
[46:24] pains but if you're born again tonight
[46:26] this afternoon that soul inside of you
[46:28] is
[46:29] 20 years old just as eternal as god is
[46:32] never had a never had a bad day never
[46:35] had a bad thought never began and never
[46:37] will end thank god for that
[46:39] that's the new birth to me that's not
[46:41] just the message of the hour that's the
[46:43] truth
[46:45] the message of the hour is as as we were
[46:47] talking about the message of the hour
[46:50] is
[46:50] the holy ghost in your age you get the
[46:53] revelation because remember you look at
[46:55] what we were looking at the chart this
[46:56] morning when and in the age of
[46:58] justification that was john wesley right
[47:00] well john what i mean martin luther
[47:02] martin luther sat in a pub and drank a
[47:04] beer and smoked a pipe he was a german
[47:08] talked about the word of god but god
[47:11] he wa he allowed that because he wanted
[47:13] martin luther to preach the just shall
[47:15] live by faith people to come out of the
[47:18] catholic church people to get born again
[47:21] under the reformation get born again
[47:23] and then what did he do he said oh well
[47:25] i got to have a john wesley because we
[47:27] got we can't be sitting in in no pub
[47:29] drinking beer smoking a pipe
[47:32] you can't do that
[47:35] but they could because that was their
[47:36] box that was their leadership that was
[47:38] their time that was their anointing then
[47:40] you come to john wesley's anointing and
[47:42] then you come to pentecostal anointing
[47:43] which was the gifts coming back into the
[47:45] church and the different doctrines and
[47:48] and you know the first the first church
[47:50] the first pentecostal church in 1906
[47:52] they were trinitarians
[47:54] they didn't have a one god revelation it
[47:55] was only until about 1912 they came in
[47:57] with daddy seymour and him came in and
[47:59] and got the revelation of one true
[48:01] living god but then you got all kind of
[48:03] jesus name which was you know one lucky
[48:04] finger and they had all this and all
[48:06] that they subdivided again
[48:09] man has done that we just they just keep
[48:11] dividing because what does satan like to
[48:13] do he likes to what divide and conquer
[48:16] he don't want us to get together now how
[48:18] many
[48:19] i'm gonna go ahead and say it brother
[48:20] john
[48:21] how many denominations we got in this
[48:23] message
[48:27] one message
[48:30] one bible
[48:31] eleven hundred sermons vindication
[48:36] vindication vindication vindication
[48:40] and these people
[48:41] go different churches won't even talk to
[48:42] each other
[48:44] you know why because of these virtues i
[48:45] want to read this we were talking about
[48:47] this morning brother brown says in
[48:49] blasphemous names he said brother
[48:50] branham
[48:51] should we speak with tongues absolutely
[48:54] that's the gift of god they don't have
[48:55] this quote but these gifts of god
[48:57] without these virtues make a stumbling
[48:59] block
[49:00] to the unbeliever because the unbeliever
[49:03] looks at you he said look it's not
[49:04] accepted by god
[49:07] god doesn't accept you just to get born
[49:09] again not in this age
[49:11] in this age he expects you to get born
[49:13] again then he expects you to grow
[49:16] because you've got the word to grow by
[49:18] you've got an open book to work by not a
[49:21] closed book it's open
[49:23] so you can read everything you need to
[49:24] read
[49:27] praise the lord
[49:29] but let's not be a stumbling block
[49:33] even believers can be something blocks
[49:35] without these virtues what brother brown
[49:37] say power without characters what
[49:39] satanic
[49:40] power without character would have you
[49:42] do
[49:43] it'd have
[49:44] well it you zap your boss out of
[49:47] existence if you could
[49:50] now mine's a good i got a good boss
[49:51] maybe some of y'all don't but i got a
[49:52] good ball she's a good postmaster lady
[49:55] but um
[49:56] but if you use those characters wrong
[49:58] god's not going to give you that
[49:59] character if he knows you're going to
[50:01] misuse it
[50:02] that's why we've stayed babies for 60
[50:04] years
[50:05] that's why that we've as brother brown
[50:07] said we've done like pentecost we've
[50:09] tooted out the whistle we've made sure
[50:10] that we shouted spoken tongues and and
[50:13] quoted brother branham to a degree
[50:15] and lived a good life but that's not
[50:16] what god's requiring now
[50:19] he's requiring the revelation of the son
[50:21] of man because that's not your birth
[50:23] your birth is over here and then the
[50:25] revelation that we're going to talk
[50:26] about under the sun of god revelation
[50:28] you can only understand it by having the
[50:30] new birth
[50:32] all right
[50:32] and there's three stages of this
[50:34] adoption we were talking about this
[50:35] morning we'll go through it pretty quick
[50:38] we have the birth so for as many that
[50:40] are led by the spirit of god they are
[50:42] not going to be they are the sons of god
[50:45] for we have not received the spirit of
[50:46] bondage again to fear
[50:48] but we have received the spirit of
[50:50] adoption listen if you're born again
[50:51] today you should be the freest person in
[50:53] the world
[50:54] you should be so free you say no yeah we
[50:56] have problems
[50:58] we have issues that we have to work on
[51:00] which is life
[51:01] but you should be able to handle them
[51:03] and get through them and get by them
[51:05] work your way through these things
[51:09] for we've not received the spirit of
[51:10] bondage against fear but what we have
[51:11] received the spirit of adoption
[51:14] all right you got to receive the spirit
[51:16] of adoption to even be considered an
[51:17] adoption in other words you've got to be
[51:19] the child i like what brother dale said
[51:21] many many years ago he said god is not
[51:23] obligated
[51:25] he's not obligated to adopt the devil's
[51:27] kids
[51:30] he's obligated to adopt his own kids
[51:33] and that's what we do at the new birth
[51:35] we receive the spirit of adoption
[51:37] and we are children
[51:40] of god children
[51:42] we start out as children
[51:45] as i said this morning you know you we
[51:46] got
[51:47] several young men in here and several
[51:49] young ladies
[51:50] that are getting older
[51:52] but you're not going to give a car keys
[51:54] to a five-year-old
[51:56] you're gonna let your daughter drive
[51:57] with you home today brother why she's a
[51:59] girl i mean she's a human she's got bias
[52:01] she got no she got a mouth she got hands
[52:03] she got feet she's human why she hadn't
[52:06] come to the growth development part she
[52:08] hasn't come to the intelligence part
[52:09] sure she's got a brain and it's very a
[52:11] very good brain because she looks like a
[52:13] mama very good very good brain
[52:16] but um but still i mean she's human like
[52:19] i said we're christian my point is we're
[52:21] sons and daughters of god we have come
[52:23] to a place that we know we should know
[52:25] what the new birth is
[52:26] but we should know the requirements of
[52:28] that that brother bob was talking about
[52:30] this morning and as we move further the
[52:32] requirements we were talking about
[52:33] downstairs
[52:35] of having virtue knowledge tempers
[52:36] patience guidelines and brotherly
[52:38] kindness these are required virtues
[52:40] they're required but listen
[52:45] all the apostles had those virtues
[52:48] the apostles the early church ages had
[52:50] those virtues working in their life
[52:53] so i'm not when we talk about the son of
[52:54] man revelation we're not talking about
[52:56] that we're going on up higher into the
[52:58] headstone as we see over there that
[53:00] there's justification sanctification and
[53:02] baptism of the holy ghost in the pyramid
[53:05] and then there's a in the small pyramid
[53:07] which is really small because only a few
[53:09] group a small group of people is going
[53:11] to make it to the son of man revelation
[53:13] but the son of god revelation is down to
[53:15] the church ages we got to be out of the
[53:17] church age when brother branham was
[53:19] preaching he was preaching he said he
[53:21] said not in the years of preparation
[53:23] what was that he was preparing a group
[53:25] of people
[53:27] he was trying to get the pentecostals to
[53:28] come out
[53:30] methodist baptist pentecostal he was
[53:32] trying to get them out come out of her
[53:34] my people
[53:35] with the signs and the wonders as moses
[53:37] did the signs and the wonders caught the
[53:40] attention of the people but the
[53:42] attention of the people was supposed to
[53:44] gather them to moses and then take them
[53:46] into the promised land oh what happened
[53:48] the first thing they did said was that
[53:50] you brought us out here to die moses
[53:53] we'd rather go back and eat the leeks
[53:55] and garlics and i don't see how in the
[53:56] world cause man leeks are horrible
[53:58] but they'd rather eat that than what be
[54:00] in the
[54:01] we're the same way folks
[54:04] sometimes we'd rather not be in the
[54:05] presence of
[54:08] god human beings i'm just human i don't
[54:11] know about y'all
[54:19] we live in a spirit realm
[54:22] not enough
[54:24] but we are human beings and we have
[54:26] things we have to do you know that
[54:28] but that's what we're working on we're
[54:29] working on we're not working on now
[54:32] and thank god for for brother john we
[54:34] were talking about this today
[54:36] a progressive ministry we've had here
[54:38] brother dale's been preaching here for
[54:39] 45 years and it's always been
[54:40] progressive ministry one of the greatest
[54:42] teachers i've ever heard amen
[54:48] and i'm like those people across the
[54:49] country time i'm resting on that amen
[54:55] and if air if children then if we become
[54:57] children then heirs
[55:00] all right heirs of god what heirs of
[55:01] these virtues you're not going to get
[55:03] these virtues from god if you don't have
[55:05] god already inside of you all right and
[55:07] if children then there's heirs of god
[55:10] and joint heirs with christ whatever
[55:11] christ gets you get amen
[55:14] what do christ christ got a body change
[55:16] christ's got a resurrection
[55:18] amen christ got an eternal body do you
[55:20] know his body was not eternal do you
[55:21] know he received an eternal body
[55:23] amen the bible that's why the bible says
[55:25] being made perfect
[55:27] he became the author of our salvation
[55:29] that we may be glorified together let's
[55:31] continue real quick justification we
[55:33] were talking about this morning and we
[55:34] were talking about baby form
[55:35] justification which
[55:37] takes your sins if you're truly
[55:39] repentant throws them in the sea of
[55:40] god's forgetfulness never to be
[55:42] remembered again now we remember them
[55:44] but god does not remember those past
[55:46] sins
[55:47] stop wasting god's time
[55:50] repenting for something you're already
[55:51] repenting for
[55:53] if you truly repented satan is going to
[55:55] bring it back to you don't worry
[55:57] that's his job but it's only in that
[56:00] memories and conscious affection realm
[56:02] it is not in that center realm
[56:04] that center realm is settled it's peace
[56:06] it's joy it's all those different things
[56:09] but what sayeth that the word is nigh
[56:11] thee even in thy mouth and in the heart
[56:13] that is the word of faith which we
[56:14] preach if thou shalt confess with my
[56:16] mouth the lord jesus we were talking
[56:18] about it downstairs sister christine was
[56:20] preaching a good sermon back there
[56:23] listen
[56:25] stop just a minute
[56:29] there's a lot of churches in this
[56:30] message that wouldn't let a woman say
[56:32] nothing
[56:33] and i know paul said
[56:36] bless her heart be silent in church
[56:39] but say some women i'd rather hear than
[56:41] men
[56:44] boy you ain't getting away man's except
[56:46] for the women i got a man from the women
[56:47] brother john durrett
[56:50] bro john said john duretz i don't know
[56:52] who you saw i didn't know you somebody
[56:53] so i stayed awake the whole sermon
[56:55] that works brother that's where it works
[56:58] but i
[57:01] you said it so i can say it
[57:05] ain't that right brother john
[57:07] but there's a lot of people no there's a
[57:09] lot of people that wouldn't want to
[57:10] listen to a sister but we got some
[57:12] sisters that's got some they're faithful
[57:13] to the holy ghost brother brown said
[57:15] holy ghost-filled woman can help you
[57:19] now we don't believe in women preachers
[57:20] and all that we don't believe in
[57:21] conducting having them conduct meetings
[57:23] no but sitting around talking about the
[57:24] word of god haven't you rather do that
[57:27] than to talk about candy and cooking and
[57:29] all that stuff y'all can do that
[57:30] together but
[57:32] i tell you what there was a brother came
[57:34] here one time that preached a false
[57:35] doctrine and there was about two sisters
[57:36] met him right down there at the bottom
[57:38] of the stairs
[57:39] the preacher pastor didn't even have to
[57:41] get out there they done cornered him and
[57:43] said what do you mean by this what do
[57:44] you mean by this what do you mean by
[57:45] this i we ain't seen him since i don't
[57:47] think so
[57:51] but anyway make a point sister christine
[57:53] what we're talking about and we're
[57:53] talking about salvation there's a lot of
[57:55] people going to be saved
[57:57] that's not born again that's not living
[57:59] in the city
[58:01] that's not bride
[58:03] they're going to have to stay dead a
[58:04] thousand years they're going to have to
[58:06] come up and give an account right
[58:08] but like i told you before i'm so proud
[58:10] that this message has given me at least
[58:12] two good revelations brother john
[58:15] back there in the back
[58:19] there's two revelations you can talk
[58:20] about seals plagues vials all you want
[58:22] to talk about there's two things that
[58:24] god showed me if i get born again i
[58:27] never ever have to stand at the judgment
[58:31] thank god
[58:36] thank god i'll never have to stand at
[58:39] the judgment and i'll never have to go
[58:41] through the tribulation
[58:44] that's enough i know it's not all but
[58:46] that's enough for me to know that god
[58:47] saved my soul
[58:49] and it's taking me somewhere but if
[58:51] we'll give the rest of it we're going to
[58:52] talk about later on in the sermon about
[58:53] doors and doors if we'll just let him
[58:55] let him get a step further
[58:57] let him get a step further
[59:00] let him not just let him in your house
[59:02] let not just lay them in your heart
[59:05] let him ramble through those
[59:06] drawers
[59:08] that's right
[59:10] open the doors up
[59:11] open the doors up
[59:13] and say god come in
[59:16] and if there's trash in here take it out
[59:19] if thou shalt confess without mouth to
[59:21] lord jesus and believe in thy heart that
[59:23] thou he is raised from the dead thou
[59:24] shalt be what saved
[59:26] salvation is of the lord a lot of people
[59:29] are going to have salvation but they're
[59:31] going to have to live outside the city
[59:32] they're going to have a position where
[59:33] they're going to have to go through the
[59:34] tribulation they're going to have to
[59:36] stand at the white throne judgment but
[59:37] if they get eternal life they get
[59:39] eternal life
[59:40] that's what the bible says the bible
[59:42] says you don't it does not say a word
[59:43] about well you got to know what this
[59:44] message is to be saved oh that hurts
[59:48] oh that hurts a lot of people
[59:51] there's going to be more people saved
[59:53] that never heard of this message than
[59:54] they are it's going to be that's ever
[59:55] heard of this message amen
[59:58] so we are what bless people to know that
[59:59] we've come to the message of the hour
[1:00:01] that we do are going to be able to stay
[1:00:03] in that city we are going to be able to
[1:00:05] pass judgment the one that we're not
[1:00:07] going to have to go through the
[1:00:08] tribulation we are going to take a body
[1:00:10] change and we are going to be caught up
[1:00:12] out of here amen we're going to have
[1:00:13] some heart aches and trials
[1:00:16] but we're not just saved
[1:00:18] we're full of the holy ghost
[1:00:20] and we're born again christians
[1:00:23] for the heart of man believeth unto
[1:00:24] righteousness and with a mouth
[1:00:25] confession is made unto salvation that's
[1:00:27] what i was just doing
[1:00:29] confess
[1:00:30] confess with your mouth
[1:00:32] romans 3 verse 24 says being justified
[1:00:34] what freely
[1:00:36] by his grace through the redemption that
[1:00:38] is in christ jesus whom god has set
[1:00:40] forth to be a perpetuation through faith
[1:00:42] in his blood to declare his
[1:00:43] righteousness what for the remission of
[1:00:45] sins that are past
[1:00:48] god cannot forgive you even knowing that
[1:00:50] you're going to sin tomorrow
[1:00:54] he's not going to forgive you unless you
[1:00:56] ask him
[1:00:58] that's catholicism to ask for you know
[1:01:01] what that's why
[1:01:02] that's why the mafia love catholics
[1:01:05] they love being catholics
[1:01:07] i'm sorry priest i'm going to kill two
[1:01:09] people tomorrow so i'm going to ask you
[1:01:11] to go ahead and forgive me now
[1:01:13] sister anna's been she was a catholic i
[1:01:15] mean that's what you do you you repent
[1:01:17] for all that stuff well i'm fixing to do
[1:01:18] this but i want you to forgive me for
[1:01:20] that that's not the way god works he
[1:01:23] forgives you for the he gives you
[1:01:24] remission of sins that are past
[1:01:27] through the forbearance of god that's
[1:01:29] justification to declare i say at this
[1:01:31] time his righteousness that he might be
[1:01:33] just and the justifier of him which
[1:01:34] believeth in jesus where is boasting
[1:01:37] then it is excluded by what law of works
[1:01:40] no but by the law of faith that's what
[1:01:42] we're talking about get down here at
[1:01:43] faith therefore we conclude that a man
[1:01:45] is justified by faith without the deeds
[1:01:48] of the law
[1:01:51] sanctification now this is again this is
[1:01:54] sanctification you're not even in the
[1:01:55] body yet you're not you're you're
[1:01:57] becoming a believer we were talking
[1:01:58] about this morning when the unclean
[1:02:00] spirit has gone out of a man he walks
[1:02:01] through dry places seeks rest finders
[1:02:03] none then he says i will return into my
[1:02:05] house
[1:02:07] that's satan talking if you don't mind
[1:02:09] he said i will return into my house
[1:02:11] that's right
[1:02:13] god has not took full possession yet he
[1:02:16] has cleaned your drinking cuts and
[1:02:17] smoking gambling
[1:02:19] laundry list whatever your problems were
[1:02:22] if they went out they should have went
[1:02:23] out at sanctification not that you
[1:02:26] believe the message don't cut my hair i
[1:02:28] don't go to the bar anymore that's just
[1:02:31] that's just good living that's
[1:02:34] sanctification which is still you're
[1:02:36] going to go to hell if you if you don't
[1:02:38] continue on
[1:02:40] because you don't you're not you don't
[1:02:41] have god in your soul to protect you
[1:02:44] now you have the unclean spirit out but
[1:02:45] what's he going to do he's going to try
[1:02:46] to come back he's not going to try to
[1:02:48] come back he will come back
[1:02:51] because you know what i was a good
[1:02:52] soldier for him he lost a good one when
[1:02:54] he lost me
[1:02:55] because i did what he said most of the
[1:02:57] time
[1:02:59] then he said i would return into my
[1:03:01] house from whence i came out and when he
[1:03:03] has come
[1:03:04] he find it empty swept and garnished
[1:03:08] started going to church
[1:03:11] started believing
[1:03:13] got a new spirit remember we thought
[1:03:15] about it this morning but it's not the
[1:03:16] holy spirit
[1:03:18] then go ahead and take himself seven
[1:03:20] other spirits more wicked than himself
[1:03:22] more religious
[1:03:24] and put you in a message church
[1:03:27] and say you're fine
[1:03:28] just come to church whenever you need to
[1:03:30] i say
[1:03:32] want to sorry you need to every time
[1:03:34] whenever you want to
[1:03:36] uh i'll stay home listen tapes if i need
[1:03:38] to
[1:03:39] i ain't going there anymore i'm not
[1:03:42] that's for somebody else if you think
[1:03:44] you can make it at home then god bless
[1:03:45] your heart
[1:03:50] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:03:52] than the first
[1:03:54] even so it will be into this wicked
[1:03:55] generation who's he talking to he's
[1:03:57] talking to us ii timothy 2 19
[1:04:00] nevertheless the foundation of god stand
[1:04:02] is sure having this seal the lord
[1:04:04] knoweth them that are his
[1:04:06] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:04:08] christ depart from iniquity here we are
[1:04:10] getting ready to start getting cleaned
[1:04:11] up

[1:04:15] aside for service not put in service
[1:04:18] but in a great house they're not only
[1:04:19] vessels of gold and silver but wood and
[1:04:21] earth and some to honor and some to
[1:04:23] dishonor watch this if a man therefore
[1:04:26] purge himself from these why start going
[1:04:28] to church start doing somebody asked me

[1:05:40] going
[1:05:41] jesus said sanctify them father through
[1:05:43] thy truth that word is truth and he was
[1:05:45] the word even before the atonement was
[1:05:47] made in other words as a preview father
[1:05:49] of shed blood i sanctify these he give
[1:05:51] them power against unclean spirits they
[1:05:52] went out cast out devils is that right
[1:05:54] they healed the sick is that right they
[1:05:56] came back sanctified rejoicing jumping
[1:05:58] up and down remember judas was in this
[1:06:00] group
[1:06:00] right is that right he said even the
[1:06:02] devil's the subject jesus said don't you
[1:06:04] rejoice because the devil's the subject
[1:06:05] but rejoice because your names are
[1:06:07] written in the book of heaven
[1:06:09] is that right and judas this carrot was
[1:06:11] one of them one of them
[1:06:14] he was one of them
[1:06:15] he wasn't one of them we are but he was
[1:06:18] one of them
[1:06:20] and like i said before i want you to get
[1:06:22] this that's why the son of man
[1:06:24] revelation has to come in back in the
[1:06:26] end time because the only way
[1:06:29] that that judas was
[1:06:32] exposed
[1:06:33] was because the son of man was on earth
[1:06:39] the son of man jesus christ knew he was
[1:06:42] going to be
[1:06:43] the betrayer
[1:06:45] so the only way that we're going to know
[1:06:47] who and he hid in the system as we all
[1:06:50] say he hid in the system he was a spy he
[1:06:53] was one that was so good the cia would
[1:06:55] have loved this guy
[1:06:57] he fit right in all the other 11 had no
[1:07:00] clue who he was on the inside
[1:07:03] but what the son of man did
[1:07:06] so the revelation of the son of man to
[1:07:08] me in the end time has to come back to
[1:07:11] identify the devil where he is and
[1:07:13] expose him
[1:07:15] that's what the seals were for the seals
[1:07:17] opened it exposed the devil
[1:07:19] it it it produced jesus christ
[1:07:22] but it exposed the devil and where he
[1:07:24] was
[1:07:26] it proved brother brown said oh man i
[1:07:27] knew i hated those organizations i knew
[1:07:29] i hated those denominations he knew that
[1:07:31] was the antichrist system listen covet
[1:07:34] shot is not the antichrist system
[1:07:38] see that's another thing all these
[1:07:39] questions that all these people all
[1:07:41] these pundits and all these people on
[1:07:42] cnn in cia and all them other places fox
[1:07:46] news
[1:07:48] they're bouncing around this theory and
[1:07:51] this theory and this we know where the
[1:07:53] antichrist is
[1:07:55] if you're not born again he's sitting in
[1:07:57] you
[1:07:58] you gotta worry about you're talking
[1:08:00] about disease that's the worst disease
[1:08:02] that covered ever thought about being
[1:08:04] it's for satan to be inside of you and
[1:08:07] you not know it
[1:08:09] you be deceived by it
[1:08:11] because the whole world's going to be
[1:08:13] deceived except the bride
[1:08:15] and she's going to be about that close
[1:08:17] from being deceived because all these
[1:08:18] other 11 bride
[1:08:22] bride disciples were deceived
[1:08:25] until judas did what he did and showed
[1:08:27] his colors
[1:08:29] and judas this carrot was one of them
[1:08:31] called out sanctified name written in
[1:08:33] the lounge book of life not the eternal
[1:08:34] section
[1:08:35] read matthew 10 and see if that's not
[1:08:37] right he called each one of them and
[1:08:38] judas every one of them right down there
[1:08:40] he sent them out give them power against
[1:08:43] unclean spirits
[1:08:45] wow
[1:08:48] how the thing was refreshed in the
[1:08:49] presence of god notice another thing
[1:08:50] once in the presence of god you get
[1:08:52] quieted
[1:08:55] you don't ain't got to shout listen
[1:08:57] jesus never shouted i don't want when
[1:08:58] you wha what
[1:09:00] and i know we came under the son of god
[1:09:02] ministry where it's a lot of shouting a
[1:09:03] lot of speaking in tongues and a lot of
[1:09:05] hollering and and
[1:09:07] jesus never did that
[1:09:09] the son of man never screamed except one
[1:09:11] time and that was to get lazarus out of
[1:09:13] a grave
[1:09:15] the devils knew who he was when he
[1:09:17] walked in the room
[1:09:20] they started screaming at him
[1:09:22] he never screamed at them we scream
[1:09:24] shake shake them and everything else
[1:09:27] what is
[1:09:29] the virtues working in your life though
[1:09:30] didn't brother say that was supreme
[1:09:32] power and control
[1:09:34] remember power without character satanic
[1:09:36] but
[1:09:37] power with character
[1:09:39] is fit to rule supreme control
[1:09:41] over the situation that's one thing that
[1:09:44] i believe you know brother branham he
[1:09:45] would stand there and he would say i
[1:09:46] take every spirit in this building under
[1:09:48] my control he controlled the whole thing
[1:09:51] he controlled everything that was going
[1:09:52] on
[1:09:53] and it wasn't he never hollered and
[1:09:54] screamed at people
[1:09:57] he prayed for him
[1:09:58] he prayed for him with power behind it
[1:10:00] that's what i'm looking for
[1:10:03] listen satan can do seek he can
[1:10:05] impersonate every gift
[1:10:08] every spiritual gift but he can't put
[1:10:10] the word together and drive satan out he
[1:10:12] can't satan can't cast out satan
[1:10:15] but the word of god can do it folks
[1:10:18] that's what i'm looking at you get
[1:10:19] quieted you're not tossed about by
[1:10:21] everything you know where you're
[1:10:22] standing there's something happen
[1:10:24] you know that you're a real christian
[1:10:26] you know that you've been in contact
[1:10:28] with somebody that loves you you know
[1:10:30] that something's happened down here
[1:10:32] and it's refreshing
[1:10:34] and not only that but you'll be refresh
[1:10:37] others
[1:10:38] you've seen people that was nice people
[1:10:39] but you wouldn't hardly stand to be
[1:10:41] around them there's something about them
[1:10:43] they got a creative power around them it
[1:10:45] just seems to be different how i'd like
[1:10:47] to stop here if it was possible and tell
[1:10:49] you something on that
[1:10:50] you're a little creator
[1:10:53] you create an atmosphere that's why when
[1:10:56] we come into service we don't do
[1:10:57] denominations man you ever been to a
[1:10:59] denominational church
[1:11:00] boyd has i've been to a few
[1:11:02] uh there was a young little boy that was
[1:11:04] preaching just started preaching in the
[1:11:06] old baptist church we used to go to
[1:11:07] years ago in the 60s and we went back
[1:11:10] and it's truly it's just like a lodge
[1:11:12] i mean they were leaning up the bench on
[1:11:14] the side of the bench talking about the
[1:11:15] ball game talking about their car and
[1:11:16] how they're gonna you know race on
[1:11:18] sunday and how they're gonna do this and
[1:11:19] who's gonna win the ball game and all
[1:11:20] that stuff and then all of a sudden the
[1:11:22] song leader stands up like this and
[1:11:24] everybody just kind of sits now
[1:11:26] then they sing their three or four songs
[1:11:28] and bring the preacher out and
[1:11:30] formality
[1:11:32] formality that's why we're quiet
[1:11:34] before the service that's why we have
[1:11:36] music playing before service that's we
[1:11:38] want to invite god in our midst
[1:11:41] i know we brought him in here with us
[1:11:43] but we want a special anointing on us
[1:11:46] to help us to worship
[1:11:49] and listen to what god has to say
[1:11:51] well you're a little creator then you
[1:11:53] can do that
[1:11:54] he said he'd give you a new spirit now
[1:11:56] this is sanctification
[1:11:58] now that spirit isn't god's spirit
[1:12:00] that's your spirit god gives you a new
[1:12:02] spirit then he says i'll put my spirit
[1:12:04] in him but the thing god has to do is
[1:12:06] give you a new spirit make your nature a
[1:12:08] little more gentle and settle down or he
[1:12:10] couldn't even live with you
[1:12:13] so he has to get you fixed up first
[1:12:14] before you he can come in
[1:12:16] i'll give you a new spirit then you take
[1:12:18] him anywhere
[1:12:19] you go all kinds of places he's got to
[1:12:21] get you fixed so you can entertain him
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:25] so that's when you're on the first altar
[1:12:27] see you're not even you know any minute
[1:12:28] holy holy
[1:12:30] you're not even a holy of holies yet
[1:12:32] all right but when you hot but when you
[1:12:35] hide away you get his spirit
[1:12:37] then the holy spirit none other than god
[1:12:39] himself comes and dwells in you
[1:12:42] and then there's something about you the
[1:12:44] neighbor loves you the people likes you
[1:12:46] entervale 1956. i love that little
[1:12:49] message right there called the intervale
[1:12:54] the dwelling place of god i'm going to
[1:12:55] try to skip through this to get to
[1:12:56] something showing that the human heart
[1:12:58] not the human head but the human heart
[1:13:00] is where he's going to reside i'll write
[1:13:02] them in my heart
[1:13:03] they'll keep my statutes and so forth
[1:13:05] saith the lord god said in another place
[1:13:06] in ezekiel i will in that day take out
[1:13:08] your old fleshly stony heart and i'll
[1:13:10] give you a new spirit i'll put my spirit
[1:13:12] in you now a lot of people
[1:13:13] even you pentecostal people
[1:13:16] listen folks it's not bad to have a
[1:13:18] pentecostal experience
[1:13:20] but staying in pentecost you're going
[1:13:21] backwards
[1:13:26] sorry
[1:13:27] you are
[1:13:28] we're past that
[1:13:30] now a lot of people even you pentecostal
[1:13:32] people a lot of times get mistaken in
[1:13:34] that
[1:13:36] you get a new spirit that's not god's
[1:13:38] spirit that's you
[1:13:40] that isn't god you get a little happy
[1:13:44] because you got a new spirit and you
[1:13:45] jump up and down run around the floor
[1:13:47] maybe shout a little bit speak with
[1:13:48] tongues run around a little bit and
[1:13:50] think you got the holy ghost that's not
[1:13:51] it
[1:13:55] that's a new spirit
[1:13:56] god gave you
[1:13:58] that's you
[1:13:59] then after he give you your spirit then
[1:14:01] he said i'll put my spirit
[1:14:03] then what's the matter with this missed
[1:14:05] meal cramps that you get
[1:14:08] that's right that's the reason you this
[1:14:09] and this is the reason we can't get
[1:14:10] anywhere 60 years we've been in a
[1:14:12] message we can't get anywhere
[1:14:14] we've not grown up
[1:14:16] we got to grow
[1:14:18] we got to grow up in god we've got to
[1:14:19] have our teaching right we've got you
[1:14:21] say brother wait
[1:14:23] you you believe you might believe this
[1:14:24] and i might believe that we might be a
[1:14:26] little off now listen
[1:14:28] was god
[1:14:29] and jesus ever
[1:14:31] at odds with each other
[1:14:37] jesus said i only do
[1:14:40] that what the father shows me
[1:14:43] only do what the father shows me
[1:14:47] it's time where everybody's doctrine has
[1:14:49] got to be the same it's a requirement
[1:14:52] to be a son of man to be in the son of
[1:14:54] man revelation we got to have the same
[1:14:57] doctrine not preach the same thing but
[1:14:58] like brother john said here they are 200
[1:15:01] miles away from us and i don't talk to
[1:15:03] brother shambo i don't know him
[1:15:05] but preaching the same i'm preaching on
[1:15:07] the same line called brother claude the
[1:15:09] other day preaching on the same line
[1:15:11] that's god
[1:15:13] that's the holy ghost trying to get all
[1:15:14] of us to see something
[1:15:17] now notice you put a new spirit god has
[1:15:19] to give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[1:15:21] even get along with him
[1:15:22] you couldn't get along with yourself
[1:15:24] that old devil spirit you had in you
[1:15:27] everybody believed brother brown was a
[1:15:28] prophet
[1:15:29] we believe what he said right okay just
[1:15:32] want to make sure we're good
[1:15:33] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[1:15:35] so you can get along with his spirit
[1:15:38] i'll put a new spirit in them and i will
[1:15:40] put my spirit in them he said after he
[1:15:42] gives you a new spirit all right that's
[1:15:44] you that's sanctification because you
[1:15:46] know what you got to get cleaned up god
[1:15:48] doesn't have to clean itself up
[1:15:51] god doesn't have to clean up
[1:15:53] he's got to clean you up
[1:15:57] but you got to meet him
[1:15:59] you got to meet him
[1:16:01] like i said before i've had people come
[1:16:03] say huh
[1:16:04] let's i want to pray for god to give me
[1:16:06] a job i said well have you been looking
[1:16:08] no i said god's not going to come and
[1:16:09] knock on your door and say hey i got you
[1:16:11] a job
[1:16:15] that's been lazy
[1:16:17] you got to make an effort
[1:16:19] put in an application
[1:16:22] then god will help you get a job
[1:16:24] but you got to make a move
[1:16:31] lazy bunch of people
[1:16:33] i'm talking about the world can't get
[1:16:35] nobody to work anymore you remember when
[1:16:37] i know a lot of you older ones remember
[1:16:39] when the if if you could work for the
[1:16:41] post office
[1:16:43] you were set for life you had a job and
[1:16:44] you i mean man you were
[1:16:47] we haven't worked two days and they
[1:16:48] leave this is too hard for me what too
[1:16:50] hard for you to do this
[1:16:52] [Laughter]
[1:16:56] next box oh i'm sorry i gotta drive over
[1:16:59] this side next box
[1:17:02] oh i might have to pick a package up and
[1:17:03] take it to somebody that orders from
[1:17:05] amazon all the time
[1:17:10] but it's a mentality of the people
[1:17:14] give me give me give me give me give me.
[1:17:18] i'm sorry i've got on that i shouldn't
[1:17:20] that's a rabbit trail i'm off of it now
[1:17:23] but that's the spirit of the world
[1:17:27] we got to put forth some effort he said
[1:17:30] what now wait a minute here's the
[1:17:32] scripture he said if you'll draw nigh to
[1:17:34] me
[1:17:36] i'll draw nigh to you
[1:17:41] if you draw an eye to me in other words
[1:17:43] you make the move
[1:17:45] and then i'll make a move too
[1:17:47] but now wait a minute that guy's
[1:17:49] standing over here though
[1:17:50] he's going to try to make a move too
[1:17:52] be careful of the devil
[1:17:54] ain't going to hit you
[1:17:56] be careful of the devil he might hit you
[1:18:00] he's going to try to make a move too so
[1:18:01] make your motive and objection what
[1:18:04] motivate objection make sure it's right
[1:18:07] don't get it confused with god's spirit
[1:18:09] it's not that's why we're going through
[1:18:10] these three stages i want you to
[1:18:12] understand sanctification is a wonderful
[1:18:14] place to be it cleans you out man it
[1:18:17] just makes you feel so good but if you
[1:18:20] stay there
[1:18:21] satan's gonna come right back in
[1:18:24] and he's gonna make you settled he's
[1:18:26] going to just he's going to just shoot
[1:18:27] you full of stuff
[1:18:29] and make you think you're a believer
[1:18:32] please don't do that
[1:18:34] strive no like brother bob was talking
[1:18:36] about this morning if you
[1:18:39] i'm if
[1:18:39] go and say it
[1:18:41] if you
[1:18:42] can't understand this message now i
[1:18:45] don't say seals i mean if you can't put
[1:18:47] certain things together say god look you
[1:18:49] told me you could tell me these things
[1:18:51] you tell me these truths that i have
[1:18:54] come into
[1:18:55] i have come into this truth i believe
[1:18:57] it's the message of the hour i don't
[1:18:59] believe it's out there i believe it's in
[1:19:00] here no i'm talking about this four
[1:19:01] walls i'm talking about the message of
[1:19:03] the hour
[1:19:04] then god listen take him to task
[1:19:07] say god you're obligated
[1:19:10] he said oh i don't talk to god like that
[1:19:12] brother brown i'm dead
[1:19:14] the bible says come boldly to the throne
[1:19:16] of grace well who's sitting on the
[1:19:19] throne
[1:19:21] god sitting there come ball in the
[1:19:23] throne and say look you promised me
[1:19:26] right here it says if i'll do this
[1:19:28] you'll do that
[1:19:31] i can't understand this god put somebody
[1:19:34] in the pulpit
[1:19:36] give me a tape to listen to give me a
[1:19:39] sister to call me
[1:19:41] give me somebody to answer my question
[1:19:45] and you know what he's obligated to do
[1:19:47] it
[1:19:49] and you know what if you're a child of
[1:19:50] god he will do it
[1:19:52] because he's not obligated to the
[1:19:53] devil's kid
[1:19:55] so now let's make sure we're not the
[1:19:56] devil's kids
[1:19:59] hmm
[1:20:02] because he's not obligated to tell you
[1:20:03] anything if you're the devil's kids
[1:20:05] so let's get born again let's get the
[1:20:08] new birth let's get faith and then start
[1:20:10] adding if we ever get to that we'll
[1:20:11] start adding them
[1:20:13] if he ever gives it to you man because
[1:20:15] you're in your condition you in your
[1:20:17] condition never get along you can't get
[1:20:19] along with your wife
[1:20:23] can't get along with your husband
[1:20:25] can't get along with your neighbor how
[1:20:27] you ever going to get along with god
[1:20:31] so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:20:33] before you can get along with him
[1:20:36] so he puts a new spirit in you and then
[1:20:40] he puts his spirit in you that's the new
[1:20:42] birth
[1:20:44] gives you a new spirit a new outlook a
[1:20:46] new faith
[1:20:48] then he puts his holy spirit
[1:20:51] inside of you
[1:20:54] then he puts his spirit
[1:20:57] listen when he puts his spirit in your
[1:20:59] soul there's no room for another spirit
[1:21:03] because that burner everything god
[1:21:04] touches it burns
[1:21:06] if it's sin it burns
[1:21:09] it burns it out and when he brings his
[1:21:11] hands and he lays his hand when some
[1:21:13] brother or somebody lays hands on you to
[1:21:15] receive the holy ghost or you want to
[1:21:17] receive the holy ghost you know what's
[1:21:19] happening
[1:21:20] there's a burner
[1:21:21] there's an angel
[1:21:26] read the
[1:21:26] bible burners
[1:21:29] remember they had coals of fire that
[1:21:31] came off the altar that touched the lips
[1:21:32] about was it isaiah
[1:21:36] there's one when you come to the new
[1:21:38] birth
[1:21:39] they'll burn you out
[1:21:41] and you know what that reminds me of
[1:21:44] he said well bro wait that's i don't
[1:21:45] know how in the world that happened
[1:21:47] there was four hebrew children three
[1:21:48] hebrew children right
[1:21:51] they went in a fiery furnace that was
[1:21:53] heated seven times further more hot
[1:21:56] killed the people that put them in there
[1:21:58] and when they walked out of that fire
[1:21:59] what'd the bible say the bible didn't
[1:22:01] say that they were not just burnt their
[1:22:03] clothes weren't singed and they didn't
[1:22:05] even smell the smoke
[1:22:07] now listen we can get close to a
[1:22:09] neighbor burn in the trash and you can
[1:22:10] get wind you can get that smoke on you
[1:22:12] and you smell it for three days
[1:22:15] that's but what happened to god it's
[1:22:16] just like that fiery furnace heat it up
[1:22:19] god
[1:22:20] heat it up seven times and burn
[1:22:22] everything kill them demons and even get
[1:22:25] close to the door
[1:22:27] because those people that went up to the
[1:22:29] door guess what happened
[1:22:32] and the three hebrew children is like
[1:22:35] it's not even warm in here
[1:22:37] i'm sweating more right now than they
[1:22:38] were
[1:22:40] you know why because there was a fourth
[1:22:42] man
[1:22:45] god met him
[1:22:47] in a fire do you know what had happened
[1:22:48] if they had never made the
[1:22:50] step god would have never had to meet
[1:22:53] him
[1:22:54] but they made a step toward the fire
[1:22:57] they made a step
[1:22:58] toward the furnace
[1:23:01] and they said it doesn't matter if we
[1:23:02] get burned up we're going to meet god
[1:23:04] anyway but we're not going to bow to
[1:23:07] this world we're not going to bow to
[1:23:08] this image
[1:23:11] and you know what that image was of
[1:23:14] ow
[1:23:15] sister you're not supposed to say
[1:23:16] nothing in church be quiet
[1:23:21] i'm glad you did that though you were
[1:23:22] exactly right you know i'm just joking
[1:23:26] she said daniel that's what the image
[1:23:27] was the whole image was about there was
[1:23:29] a
[1:23:30] prophet
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:33] they were supposed to bow to
[1:23:35] oh i'm going there anyway
[1:23:38] there was an image of a prophet of the
[1:23:40] hour
[1:23:41] that they were supposed to bow to
[1:23:43] and they said we're not bound to that
[1:23:46] my god stronger than that
[1:23:48] that's flesh and blood
[1:23:50] i got a god that'll meet me in that fire
[1:23:54] i got a god that yeah that god was in
[1:23:56] daniel no doubt
[1:23:58] but that same god it was in daniel that
[1:24:00] same god that was in william branham is
[1:24:02] inside of me and you tonight
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:06] not in the measure of being pro the
[1:24:07] prophet no
[1:24:09] not being a we're not church age
[1:24:10] messengers that was a special gift
[1:24:13] but the same holy ghost he had inside of
[1:24:15] him i got inside of me

[1:24:19] if you're born again
[1:24:24] we'll read it right here
[1:24:27] seeing you have purified your souls now
[1:24:30] see we're not purifying we're we're
[1:24:32] purifying the soul everybody with me as
[1:24:35] brother bob was talking about this
[1:24:36] morning
[1:24:37] we're getting the soul burn out we're
[1:24:38] getting everything we're getting
[1:24:40] everything cleaned out at sanctification
[1:24:42] and then he's going to bring the burner
[1:24:44] and make sure everything's burnt out and
[1:24:46] then he's going to put his spirit in and
[1:24:48] he's going to give you faith to receive
[1:24:51] these virtues is everybody with me
[1:24:54] amen
[1:24:56] but you gotta be born again first
[1:24:59] so listen right here purify
[1:25:02] your souls in obeying
[1:25:04] the truth
[1:25:06] through the spirit
[1:25:08] you can't obey the truth and not have
[1:25:10] the spirit of god inside of you
[1:25:12] there's part of the things you can obey
[1:25:13] but you can't obey the full spirit of
[1:25:15] god without having the spirit of god
[1:25:16] inside of you
[1:25:18] as i've said many times before
[1:25:20] brother john
[1:25:21] both of you
[1:25:25] if i were to write a love story june and
[1:25:27] i've been married for 43 years that lady
[1:25:29] sitting right beside you
[1:25:33] i got to get back here yeah you're the
[1:25:35] right one 43 years
[1:25:37] we've been married 43 years and we've
[1:25:39] went through two children
[1:25:42] a grand baby
[1:25:44] ups and downs ins and outs a lot of ups
[1:25:48] a bunch of downs
[1:25:50] but we love each other
[1:25:52] amen and i could write you a love story
[1:25:54] that would just
[1:25:57] make your face turn red
[1:26:00] but you know what if i gave that book to
[1:26:01] tony
[1:26:06] he probably read about two pages and
[1:26:07] toss it over to the side
[1:26:09] why because he wasn't a participant
[1:26:12] he didn't live through it
[1:26:15] okay it's only one page
[1:26:18] the fly leaf of the book
[1:26:20] but you understand what i'm saying you
[1:26:22] read in you read in novels and if you
[1:26:24] ever got involved
[1:26:26] if you get involved you learn more
[1:26:29] but if you're just reading words on a
[1:26:30] page you're just like oh well well jen
[1:26:33] and wade they went to alaska in 2004 man
[1:26:35] we had a wonderful time and we did this
[1:26:38] and we ate at this um sushi bar and we
[1:26:42] all we were just oh
[1:26:44] white dubs flew everywhere you know
[1:26:48] yeah y'all laughing but i ain't laughing
[1:26:50] because me and her experienced it
[1:26:53] everybody with me on this
[1:26:55] you understand what i'm saying
[1:26:57] but how if some way i know tony's not
[1:27:00] gonna like this
[1:27:01] if some way i could take my spirit
[1:27:05] that lived through that
[1:27:08] if you'll catch this you know how
[1:27:10] important the new birth is
[1:27:12] that spirit that i have me me that did
[1:27:15] those things with june if i could some
[1:27:17] way take that out
[1:27:18] and place it inside of him
[1:27:21] and then he'd read that book
[1:27:24] he'd learn a lot more because he knew
[1:27:26] what that was talking about
[1:27:28] because he had the person that wrote it
[1:27:30] inside of him
[1:27:32] that's how important the new birth is
[1:27:35] you get that man that wrote the book
[1:27:38] you get him inside of you
[1:27:40] and he's going to look through your
[1:27:42] human eyes and you're going to see and
[1:27:44] things are going to be revealed that's
[1:27:45] never been revealed before
[1:27:47] the love letter you're going to be able
[1:27:49] to watch not just read it as a
[1:27:51] as a outside person but you're going to
[1:27:53] be a participant
[1:27:56] that's the way i see the bible that's
[1:27:57] why i see the prophet's message we got
[1:27:59] to be active participants in this
[1:28:01] message not just coming to church but no
[1:28:04] actually i like what
[1:28:06] brother schrader old brother used to
[1:28:07] come here he's saying now satan
[1:28:10] he said i know you're rambling around up
[1:28:12] in my head he said but me and you
[1:28:14] fishing to read the bible
[1:28:17] me and you fiction read the bible
[1:28:19] and he said i want you to look if you're
[1:28:21] going to look through the eyes we're
[1:28:22] going to look at the bible we're going
[1:28:23] to read the bible we're going to see
[1:28:24] what the bible says about you
[1:28:27] that's a good thing to do it
[1:28:29] but it's a real good thing though to say
[1:28:31] god i i don't understand this could you
[1:28:33] drop down
[1:28:35] just a few minutes
[1:28:37] and help me read this because you wrote
[1:28:39] it
[1:28:40] and he wrote it in a way that the whole
[1:28:41] world don't understand it
[1:28:43] he wrote it in a way that 99 of the
[1:28:45] people in the world don't even really
[1:28:46] care about
[1:28:47] there's only one percent of the people
[1:28:49] in the world that knows what he was
[1:28:50] saying when he wrote that bible
[1:28:53] that's why it took a profit with a
[1:28:55] prophetic insight
[1:28:58] to come and show us how many i mean how
[1:28:59] many times do we read acts 2 38 how many
[1:29:01] times did we read that that the serpent
[1:29:03] begot eve how many times did we read all
[1:29:05] this brother brown never brought us a
[1:29:07] new bible
[1:29:09] it was already in there
[1:29:11] but what happened was is that had not
[1:29:13] been transferred
[1:29:15] the seals were closed
[1:29:17] the book was closed you could just
[1:29:20] barely see a little bit
[1:29:22] but when those things were open
[1:29:24] oh my
[1:29:26] and i don't believe he ever shut it
[1:29:27] either
[1:29:28] i believe he give it to me and you and
[1:29:30] we're supposed to read it just like he
[1:29:32] read it
[1:29:34] being born again not a corruptible seed
[1:29:35] but of incorruptible seed by the word of
[1:29:37] god
[1:29:38] which liveth and abideth forever for all
[1:29:40] fleshes of grass and all the glory man's
[1:29:42] a flower of grass the grass withereth
[1:29:44] and the flower thereof follow us away
[1:29:46] but look but the word of the lord
[1:29:47] endureth forever
[1:29:49] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:29:52] is preached unto you
[1:29:55] ephesians 1 verse 10 that in the
[1:29:56] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:29:58] might gather together what one
[1:30:01] gather together in one
[1:30:03] one
[1:30:04] bride not two one bride
[1:30:08] all things in christ both which are in
[1:30:11] heaven
[1:30:12] and which are on earth
[1:30:14] even in him even whom also we
[1:30:17] we have obtained an
[1:30:18] inheritance obtained
[1:30:22] we just didn't get it poured
[1:30:24] i wished i could pour it down your brain
[1:30:26] but it'd do you no good without a
[1:30:28] revelation
[1:30:30] it's just words but being predestinated
[1:30:32] we have an inheritance according to the
[1:30:34] purpose of him he worked with all things

[1:31:37] that we should be the praise of his
[1:31:38] glory who first trusted in christ in
[1:31:40] whom also you have trusted look after
[1:31:43] you've got to hear the word to know it
[1:31:47] you've got to hear the word for it to be
[1:31:49] quickened
[1:31:51] the gospel of your salvation and him
[1:31:53] also after that you believed
[1:32:00] you believe

[1:32:21] but we've got seven payments
[1:32:25] to get this house built to get this
[1:32:27] house to where you can get the title
[1:32:31] you show brother wade uh
[1:32:33] jesus holds the title deed
[1:32:35] i thought god holds the title of deed
[1:32:37] and i thought he gave it to jesus on in
[1:32:38] revelations 5.
[1:32:44] and there was the lamb and what did he
[1:32:46] do he opened it up the prophet said and
[1:32:48] give it to his people
[1:32:51] us
[1:32:52] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:32:54] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:32:55] possessions of the praise of his glory
[1:32:57] john 14 verse 15 says if you love me
[1:32:59] keep my commandments and i will pray the
[1:33:01] father he shall give you another
[1:33:02] comforter that you may abide who he may
[1:33:04] abide with you forever
[1:33:06] look even the spirit of truth whom the
[1:33:09] world cannot receive
[1:33:12] because they can't see him

[1:33:20] in you i will not leave you comfortless

[1:33:27] me
[1:33:28] because i live you shall live also at
[1:33:30] that day you shall know that what we
[1:33:32] were talking about this morning
[1:33:33] i
[1:33:35] am in my father
[1:33:38] the father and ye and me
[1:33:41] and i in you
[1:33:47] heirs and
[1:33:48] joiners folks listen you're not a second
[1:33:51] person of god
[1:33:55] the devil is the second person of god
[1:34:02] your god
[1:34:04] if he possesses your soul your god
[1:34:11] that's why we're still here because
[1:34:12] you're not believing it
[1:34:15] oh i can't here we go with the excuses
[1:34:17] oh i can't
[1:34:18] no but he can
[1:34:20] and i just read you the will that said
[1:34:22] you were heirs and joiners whatever
[1:34:23] christ god's what you got
[1:34:25] i just read you the bible
[1:34:27] that he said i pray father that they be
[1:34:29] one like me and you are one well how was
[1:34:31] jesus in god one they were one
[1:34:35] so guess who we in christ are
[1:34:37] one
[1:34:39] adam and eve folks were literally one
[1:34:41] person
[1:34:43] now they were separated but they were
[1:34:44] literally one person if you took a dna
[1:34:46] test from adam and a dna test from eve
[1:34:49] the there's no way they they say no
[1:34:51] there's two people here he said nope one
[1:34:53] dna
[1:34:54] because she literally came out of him so
[1:34:56] that's what you and i got to come back
[1:34:58] to when we come to this body change
[1:34:59] we're going to have to literally know
[1:35:01] that we come out of god
[1:35:06] hard to believe but you better start
[1:35:08] believing it folks
[1:35:09] are we just going to keep dying we're
[1:35:11] going to keep having
[1:35:12] funerals and i brother could not speak
[1:35:15] unto you as into spiritual carnal even
[1:35:17] as into babies it's not bad to be a baby
[1:35:19] it's bad to stay a baby
[1:35:21] i have fed you with milk and not with me
[1:35:23] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[1:35:25] it neither yet now are you able
[1:35:27] for you are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:35:29] is among you envying strife division are
[1:35:32] you not carnal and walk as men
[1:35:34] listen to first peter too wherefore
[1:35:36] laying aside all malice all guile all
[1:35:38] hypocrisy envious evil speaking
[1:35:40] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:35:43] of the word listen i like milk
[1:35:47] man daddy the other day he had some
[1:35:48] cornbread milk and i about
[1:35:50] stole it from him
[1:35:54] but i went home and had a steak
[1:35:57] because i like steak
[1:35:59] hey man
[1:36:01] i like milk
[1:36:02] but i like steak too
[1:36:05] but a baby desires the sincere milk of
[1:36:08] the word
[1:36:09] look that you may grow thereby
[1:36:11] if so be you have tasted that the lord
[1:36:14] is gracious
[1:36:16] first corinthians 12 3 says wherefore i
[1:36:18] give you to understand that no man
[1:36:19] speaking by the spirit of god calleth
[1:36:21] jesus the curse and that no man can say
[1:36:23] that jesus is the lord but by the holy
[1:36:25] ghost there's no way you can have these
[1:36:27] virtues there's no way you can
[1:36:28] understand this message of the hour uh
[1:36:31] sister anna come on that would come with
[1:36:32] another another sister bless her heart
[1:36:36] we were talking about and and she's like
[1:36:39] well i know about serpent seed and i
[1:36:41] know about well so did i
[1:36:43] when i was 14 years old i knew the major
[1:36:46] what you want to say major revelation
[1:36:48] doctrines
[1:36:50] but i didn't know how to fit them in the
[1:36:51] word
[1:36:52] because i wasn't born again and i proved
[1:36:54] that because i went out in the world for
[1:36:55] about 20 years
[1:36:57] but i knew that it was not an apple in
[1:37:00] the garden common sense could tell you
[1:37:02] that brother brown didn't he say one
[1:37:04] time he said that's just an ability to
[1:37:06] read
[1:37:09] but what about a revelation though
[1:37:11] what about when god came and gave me the
[1:37:13] new birth when all those pieces then i i
[1:37:15] all just began to fit
[1:37:18] and they fit together and they fit
[1:37:20] together and they weren't contrary one
[1:37:21] to the other
[1:37:24] that's to me that's the new birth
[1:37:27] simon peter's servant apostle of jesus
[1:37:28] christ to them that have obtained like
[1:37:30] precious faith look you've got to obtain
[1:37:32] it
[1:37:32] something you got to get
[1:37:34] remember meet him he'll meet you
[1:37:38] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:37:39] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[1:37:40] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[1:37:42] knowledge of god and jesus our lord
[1:37:44] according as what he is divine power
[1:37:46] there's only one divine power and that's
[1:37:48] god has given unto us all things that
[1:37:50] pertain unto life and godliness
[1:37:53] through the knowledge of him that called
[1:37:54] us to glory and virtue who by our given
[1:37:56] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:37:57] promises what these promises right here
[1:38:00] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:38:02] the divine nature now that's partakers
[1:38:05] of the divine nature that's god when he
[1:38:06] comes in your soul
[1:38:08] burns you out
[1:38:10] gives you his nature
[1:38:13] burns your nature out listen he doesn't
[1:38:15] kill your soul
[1:38:17] you'd be dead
[1:38:21] he kills the nature that's attached to
[1:38:23] it
[1:38:25] because you have an old nature he we're
[1:38:26] going to now take the divine nature of
[1:38:28] god having escaped the corruption that
[1:38:31] is in the world through lust and besides
[1:38:32] this giving all diligence
[1:38:34] add
[1:38:36] besides this
[1:38:38] besides this
[1:38:40] giving all diligence add
[1:38:43] to your faith remember faith is not an
[1:38:45] ad
[1:38:47] add to your faith virtue knowledge one
[1:38:49] two three four five six seven
[1:38:51] seven ads
[1:38:55] we're talking about right here in
[1:38:56] numbers 34.
[1:38:57] we don't have to look at the chart again
[1:38:59] i don't think
[1:39:01] but remember moses commanded the
[1:39:02] children of israel saying this is the
[1:39:03] land which you shall inherit we had a
[1:39:05] prophet of god that he walked through us
[1:39:07] through the wilderness of sin he walked
[1:39:09] with the pentecostals he walked with the
[1:39:11] different ones they saw signs miracles
[1:39:13] and wonders and they still denied him
[1:39:15] they still turned him down
[1:39:17] you take them you take the uh the life
[1:39:19] of moses and the life of brother branham
[1:39:21] and the life of paul and you put them
[1:39:22] all together and they all just kind of
[1:39:23] coincide with each other all right
[1:39:27] he led us up to he led us up to the
[1:39:29] promised land but
[1:39:32] brother branham was not here
[1:39:33] positionally by in human flesh to place
[1:39:35] us
[1:39:37] right
[1:39:38] the holy ghost is going to place us by
[1:39:40] what moses said by what the prophet of
[1:39:42] god said we're going to be placed
[1:39:46] in this land
[1:39:49] nothing nothing against the prophet we
[1:39:51] listen
[1:39:52] besides jesus christ he's the greatest
[1:39:54] man that ever walks on the face of this
[1:39:55] earth
[1:39:56] the greatest man that ever walks on the
[1:39:59] face of this earth is william man
[1:40:00] branham except for jesus christ
[1:40:03] i just believe that he was a prophet he
[1:40:05] was a born-again christian he was
[1:40:06] adopted he had the he had the revelation
[1:40:08] of the seals
[1:40:10] he brought everything that we needed
[1:40:13] opened the scriptures to me i really
[1:40:15] don't care brother john whoever
[1:40:16] whichever john i want to talk to
[1:40:19] whichever
[1:40:21] if they they can say what they want to
[1:40:23] about brother branham
[1:40:24] i really don't care about his
[1:40:27] well here we go again about his life
[1:40:30] he led me to god
[1:40:32] he brought clarity
[1:40:34] to the message not the message he
[1:40:36] preached to the message that we got
[1:40:37] right here
[1:40:39] he brought clarity to this
[1:40:41] and i thank god for that and he's going
[1:40:43] to get a great portion of heaven
[1:40:45] but so are me and you
[1:40:47] because we're followers as we were
[1:40:48] talking uh yesterday uh talking to
[1:40:51] somebody and we're not followers of
[1:40:53] william branham
[1:40:56] we follow the message
[1:40:59] we're the we're in the days of the voice
[1:41:02] of the seventh angel we know we had to
[1:41:04] be off the scene for it to be the voice
[1:41:05] in us
[1:41:07] same way with moses moses had to be off
[1:41:09] the scene so that joshua could take him
[1:41:12] to the promised land
[1:41:13] and positionally place him into the
[1:41:16] promised land and i believe listen i
[1:41:18] said before and i'll say it again i
[1:41:20] believe that you can get born again by
[1:41:22] listening to tapes and reading books
[1:41:26] but you can't grow
[1:41:28] you cannot grow without a five-fold
[1:41:30] ministry or god's gonna have to take the
[1:41:31] bible and change it
[1:41:33] because the fifo ministry for the
[1:41:35] perfecting of the saints
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] and that's bible that's your inheritance
[1:41:40] that's what i trust
[1:41:42] you know what i put my trust in that
[1:41:44] because that's what god said hallelujah
[1:41:47] and moses commanded the children of
[1:41:48] israel saying this is the land which you
[1:41:50] shall inherit by lot which the lord
[1:41:52] commanded to give unto the nine tribes
[1:41:53] and half tribes i remember there were
[1:41:55] twelve
[1:41:56] for the tribe of children of reuben
[1:41:57] according to the house of their fathers
[1:41:59] a tribe of gad we were looking at the
[1:42:00] poster this morning you don't have to
[1:42:02] pull it up
[1:42:04] had received their inheritance and half
[1:42:05] the tribe of manasseh have received
[1:42:07] their inheritance the two tribes and a
[1:42:08] half tribe received their inheritance on
[1:42:10] this side jordan near jericho eastward
[1:42:13] toward the sun rising so under moses
[1:42:16] under moses
[1:42:18] moses taught the people there is a
[1:42:21] promised land
[1:42:23] and we're going to it
[1:42:25] i've brought you out my message has
[1:42:27] brought you out of egypt
[1:42:30] and we're walking in the wilderness of
[1:42:32] sin sanctification
[1:42:34] it cleaned all them out
[1:42:36] hello somebody
[1:42:38] it cleaned them out it got rid of them
[1:42:40] old fighters they just started dying and
[1:42:42] god started killing them with plagues he
[1:42:44] was what he was sanctifying his people
[1:42:49] he was getting rid of the old
[1:42:50] unbelievers the old fighters he was
[1:42:52] getting rid of the ones that doubted god
[1:42:55] and he raised up a 20 year old group and
[1:42:57] and below
[1:42:59] and they're the ones that went over and
[1:43:01] possessed the land
[1:43:03] that's where you and i are it doesn't
[1:43:04] matter what age you are today we're in
[1:43:06] that time
[1:43:08] to where we're that group of people
[1:43:09] that's to possess
[1:43:11] our property
[1:43:12] percent possess our land
[1:43:15] the 12 times of israel we don't have i'm
[1:43:17] going to skip through that
[1:43:20] but what happened is remember this
[1:43:22] morning you had reuben and gat on this
[1:43:24] side of the jordan river
[1:43:26] what does jordan mean death
[1:43:28] on this side of the jordan river and a
[1:43:29] half triumphant tribal manasseh well
[1:43:31] there was another half tribe went into
[1:43:33] the promised land but all these that's
[1:43:36] why it takes justifications
[1:43:37] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:43:38] holy ghost to even get you to the
[1:43:41] promised land
[1:43:43] then you've got to enter into promised
[1:43:44] land and fight your way
[1:43:47] because even reuben and gad and half
[1:43:49] tribe manasseh
[1:43:50] they said we'll go in and fight listen
[1:43:54] that's the holy ghost
[1:43:56] fighting your battles
[1:43:59] for you
[1:44:01] and he positionally places us
[1:44:04] into land that's our mandate that's our
[1:44:06] adoption
[1:44:08] is our placing
[1:44:10] but look right here brother brown said
[1:44:12] virtue must be in us
[1:44:14] and until we get virtue then when we get
[1:44:16] true virtue we can add it to our faith
[1:44:18] that's the next foundation wall now
[1:44:20] first you must have faith
[1:44:21] faith alone won't do it
[1:44:24] you peter said then add virtue to your
[1:44:26] faith you must have virtue in order to
[1:44:28] add it to your faith
[1:44:30] now then it might be the reason you
[1:44:31] don't have it because many churches of
[1:44:33] today teach you you don't have to have
[1:44:35] it
[1:44:38] let us oh well that's just demo
[1:44:39] denominations
[1:44:41] no that's just in my message churches
[1:44:46] be quiet if you want to
[1:44:48] but we got to have true teaching we got
[1:44:50] to have somebody to teach us to get out
[1:44:51] of here we're not just going to get out
[1:44:53] of here because there's a day on on the
[1:44:54] calendar and it's just x and there's the
[1:44:56] day and that's the day we're going to go
[1:44:58] in the rapture and that's it
[1:45:00] that's not right
[1:45:02] we're gentiles we don't have a time we
[1:45:04] don't have 1260 days we don't have any
[1:45:07] kind of time
[1:45:08] we're not we're not told we have a day
[1:45:11] no man knows the day or hour
[1:45:14] because we're gentiles but it's when the
[1:45:16] last one comes in and gets ready
[1:45:22] they teach you you don't have to have it
[1:45:23] of the days of its past they don't have
[1:45:25] to have it the only thing you have to do
[1:45:26] is just join a church
[1:45:28] yep days has passed
[1:45:31] so real quick
[1:45:33] if you look on the chart you'll see
[1:45:36] that god down through the church ages
[1:45:38] and i'll read the quote here in just a
[1:45:39] few minutes
[1:45:40] god was building a body this is the
[1:45:42] bride this is the body of christ
[1:45:45] and he built it under the revelation of
[1:45:47] the son of god believe in the lord jesus
[1:45:48] christ and thou shalt be saved get the
[1:45:50] virtues in your life live a good
[1:45:52] christian life you know what i've read
[1:45:53] the quote the other day that brother
[1:45:54] branham gave us but you and i are
[1:45:56] required further than that you and i are
[1:45:58] required more of the open book we're not
[1:46:01] required just what seven church ages
[1:46:03] because the early church ages had these
[1:46:05] virtues they had these virtues we're
[1:46:07] trying to get them and the early church
[1:46:08] already had them
[1:46:10] peter couldn't have preached it if he
[1:46:11] didn't already have it
[1:46:14] all right let's read the unveiling of
[1:46:15] god 1964.
[1:46:18] but god is still make just to make the
[1:46:20] same notice what does it do
[1:46:22] it finally returns back to the original
[1:46:23] seed again
[1:46:24] when he comes in the form of martin
[1:46:26] luther when he comes in the form of john
[1:46:27] wesley when he comes in the form of the
[1:46:29] pentecostals he is supposed to reveal
[1:46:31] himself again
[1:46:33] like the same seed went in
[1:46:35] the son of man
[1:46:36] he revealed himself as son of god
[1:46:38] through the stalk age and so forth but
[1:46:40] in this last age he's to reveal himself
[1:46:43] as the son of man again get it
[1:46:45] congregation says amen i doubt they got
[1:46:47] any of that all right like the beginning
[1:46:50] molded
[1:46:51] and what does that stalk grow it's
[1:46:52] growing all the time
[1:46:54] that little stalk grows still it's not
[1:46:56] like the original grain
[1:46:59] neither was luther's message no along
[1:47:01] come the other message finney thank you
[1:47:03] not calvin what believe in the lord
[1:47:04] jesus christ and thou shalt be saved
[1:47:06] right
[1:47:07] believers
[1:47:10] listen as i said before
[1:47:14] millions upon millions upon millions
[1:47:15] upon millions of christians every how
[1:47:17] many christians they are are never going
[1:47:18] to hear william branham
[1:47:21] only this small group of people in the
[1:47:23] end time and not just the ones that hear
[1:47:25] the ones that what act on his message
[1:47:28] it's going to be a very very small group
[1:47:30] of people
[1:47:32] that's even going to know
[1:47:34] brother brown was even on this earth
[1:47:37] that's why i thank god he gave me an
[1:47:39] opportunity
[1:47:40] let's don't squander it
[1:47:42] let's don't squander it he gave you an
[1:47:44] opportunity that he didn't even give the
[1:47:47] apostle paul
[1:47:52] that's the revelation of the seals the
[1:47:54] open book
[1:47:56] paul could see it by revelation he could
[1:47:58] see there was something coming i see
[1:47:59] through a glass darkly i see
[1:48:01] but i see
[1:48:02] jesus see he come back he'd come back he
[1:48:05] said but i see jesus
[1:48:08] he said but i know there's something
[1:48:09] coming
[1:48:10] everybody every prophet brother bryan
[1:48:11] said whatever prophet would want to
[1:48:13] white live in this day because they
[1:48:14] prophesied this day right here
[1:48:17] fenney sankey knocks calvin on down none
[1:48:19] of them they were still the message
[1:48:21] listen list they were still the message
[1:48:23] but what it was they didn't get the
[1:48:25] complete revelation of it
[1:48:29] because it wasn't time
[1:48:32] you can't put the ear on the corn before
[1:48:35] it's time to come
[1:48:36] i planted corn the other day as i said
[1:48:38] before i got some really pretty rows
[1:48:40] about eight rows of them
[1:48:41] i i wanted to make it in eternity so i
[1:48:43] did eight rows
[1:48:44] eight rows of them
[1:48:47] and i didn't go out there and start
[1:48:48] pulling them up and say well i got i got
[1:48:49] some cob right here on this corn i'm
[1:48:51] gonna start putting in the freezer no
[1:48:53] you know what you just pulled up the
[1:48:54] plant
[1:48:56] and finally there comes back again the
[1:48:58] original seed because one day in about
[1:49:00] six more weeks i'm gonna walk out there
[1:49:02] and that stalk is about this tall now
[1:49:04] it's gonna be about this tall
[1:49:06] it's gonna have went through a process
[1:49:08] and it's gonna have ears on it
[1:49:10] and i can take that ear if it's if it's
[1:49:13] um heirloom corn i can take that ear i
[1:49:16] can put it up in a place and i can dry
[1:49:18] it and i can plant next year
[1:49:24] proving his word los angeles listen as i
[1:49:26] said the other night he comes in three
[1:49:28] names the son of god son of man son of
[1:49:30] david when he was on earth the first
[1:49:32] time he was the son of man he could not
[1:49:34] be the son of god then he never claimed
[1:49:36] to be
[1:49:37] because what is the son of god god in
[1:49:39] spirit form
[1:49:41] everybody with me say amen
[1:49:43] those of you that are asleep can say
[1:49:45] ma'am
[1:49:46] it is a little hot up here aaron you got
[1:49:48] the
[1:49:50] is it this thing not working we're a lot
[1:49:53] of people are fanning if you don't mind
[1:49:54] can come look and see he's our hvac guy
[1:49:58] he's a good preacher too
[1:50:02] he said he was the son of man when
[1:50:04] anybody would question him he said you
[1:50:06] see the son of man the son of man now
[1:50:08] son of man is a prophet
[1:50:10] he had to come that way because the
[1:50:12] scripture he cannot come contrary to the
[1:50:14] scripture
[1:50:15] that's why today our message of this
[1:50:17] hour cannot come through theologians in
[1:50:20] theology it's got to come back the same
[1:50:22] thing it promised to do it must be that
[1:50:25] way
[1:50:25] so we find out in this man
[1:50:28] this man
[1:50:29] he had to be a prophet listen boaz was a
[1:50:32] man
[1:50:34] he was a flesh and blood man
[1:50:36] he had to do the rite of redemption ruth
[1:50:39] as a man
[1:50:41] because they were kin as a man
[1:50:45] not son of god he had to be the son of
[1:50:47] man
[1:50:48] jehovah himself called the prophets
[1:50:50] jeremiah them son of man when you see
[1:50:52] the son of man who is the son of man
[1:50:53] they kept asking
[1:50:55] then he served his office as the son of
[1:50:57] man on earth then he served his office
[1:50:59] now as son of god god is a spirit and
[1:51:02] when now he served through the church
[1:51:04] ages as the son of god everybody with me
[1:51:07] so through the church seven church ages
[1:51:09] he was the son of god what god in spirit
[1:51:12] form the holy ghost the comforter he is
[1:51:15] now living inside of the believers but
[1:51:17] look they are they are they are um
[1:51:19] limited to the word that they get
[1:51:23] they're limited to the word they get
[1:51:26] everybody with me on that
[1:51:28] they're limited to the revelation that
[1:51:29] the prophet of their time brings
[1:51:32] because listen god wanted it to be in
[1:51:33] this end time
[1:51:35] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:51:37] down here is where it's going to be
[1:51:38] perfected but when that which is perfect
[1:51:41] has come then that which is in part
[1:51:43] shall be done away when i was a child i
[1:51:45] spoke to the child
[1:51:47] i thought as a child but when i became a
[1:51:49] man
[1:51:53] we're not to be the son of baby
[1:51:56] we're to be the son of man
[1:51:58] amen
[1:51:59] i put away
[1:52:01] my childish things
[1:52:02] and we know perfect men of full age i
[1:52:05] like this one brought to its end we're
[1:52:07] bringing this thing to an end the
[1:52:08] gentile dispensation will be brought to
[1:52:10] an end by the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:12] realizing who she is and what she's
[1:52:14] doing here
[1:52:17] ephesians 4 11 he gave some apostles
[1:52:20] prophets evangelists pastors and
[1:52:21] teachers for what for the perfecting of
[1:52:24] the saints
[1:52:25] so the saints were being perfected down
[1:52:27] through the church ages but they never
[1:52:28] did come to perfection because they
[1:52:30] without us cannot be made perfect
[1:52:33] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:52:34] faith and that's our problem we have a
[1:52:37] and the knowledge of the son of god
[1:52:38] until what a perfect man
[1:52:40] to the measure of the stature of the
[1:52:42] fullness of christ that we henceforth be
[1:52:44] no more children
[1:52:46] tossed to and fro and carried away with
[1:52:48] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[1:52:50] man and cunning craftness where they lie
[1:52:52] and wait to deceive but speaking to what
[1:52:54] truth in love
[1:52:56] may grow up
[1:52:59] in all things which is the head even
[1:53:02] christ from whom the whole whole body
[1:53:04] fitly joined together compacted by that
[1:53:06] whichever joint supply according to the
[1:53:08] effectual working the measure of every
[1:53:10] part
[1:53:11] that's why i like yesterday that at the
[1:53:13] nursing home there or the assistant
[1:53:15] living home that was parts working
[1:53:18] sisters were playing the guitar and
[1:53:20] playing the piano and playing this and
[1:53:22] playing that brother bob was speaking
[1:53:24] and
[1:53:25] and
[1:53:26] brother um luis was singing and we had
[1:53:28] singers and we had people there clapping
[1:53:30] their hands and we had support group
[1:53:32] there
[1:53:34] that was the working of the body of
[1:53:36] christ

[1:53:54] again
[1:53:55] increase of the body into the edifying
[1:53:57] of itself in love
[1:54:00] i want to read this one right here real
[1:54:01] quick
[1:54:03] first corinthians 14 19. everybody
[1:54:05] believe the bible is correct amen
[1:54:08] yet in the church i would rather speak
[1:54:10] five words with my understanding
[1:54:13] that by my voice i might teach others
[1:54:15] also than ten thousand words
[1:54:18] in an unknown language
[1:54:21] 10 000 words
[1:54:23] in an unknown language
[1:54:25] apostle paul said i'd rather speak five
[1:54:28] words with my understanding
[1:54:30] that my
[1:54:31] that by my voice i might teach others
[1:54:34] also than ten thousand words in an
[1:54:36] unknown
[1:54:38] tongue
[1:54:40] brother be not children and
[1:54:42] understanding
[1:54:43] how being in malice be children because
[1:54:45] children are gonna be children but you
[1:54:46] gotta grow up but in understanding be
[1:54:49] men in the law it was written with men
[1:54:51] of other tongues and other lips while
[1:54:52] speaking to his people and yet for all
[1:54:54] that they will not hear me saith the
[1:54:56] lord wherefore tongues are for a sign
[1:54:59] not to them that believe
[1:55:04] but to them that believe not
[1:55:07] but prophesying service not for them
[1:55:09] that believe not
[1:55:11] but for them which believe
[1:55:14] give me some prophecy
[1:55:16] first corinthians 2 verse 9 says but as
[1:55:18] it is written i have not seen our ear
[1:55:20] heard neither entered into the heart of
[1:55:21] man the things which god has prepared
[1:55:23] for them that love him
[1:55:25] but god hath revealed them he didn't
[1:55:27] keep them
[1:55:28] he revealed them to who trees cars
[1:55:32] buildings
[1:55:33] houses
[1:55:35] no
[1:55:36] human flesh
[1:55:37] there's got to be human flesh in the end
[1:55:39] time
[1:55:40] for god to not just
[1:55:43] that's right
[1:55:47] but god has to reveal them unto us
[1:55:50] by his spirit
[1:55:52] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:55:55] the deep things of god you know the
[1:55:57] spirit searches
[1:55:58] and whatever you let allow him to work
[1:56:01] in your life he'll do it
[1:56:03] he searches
[1:56:05] he goes out through the building he
[1:56:06] searches i need this all right drop it
[1:56:09] down i need this drop it down i need to
[1:56:12] touch from god drop it down i need a new
[1:56:14] birth drop it down
[1:56:16] there's angels today if we could see in
[1:56:18] another realm i believe they're not just
[1:56:20] going
[1:56:21] like some of y'all are doing
[1:56:25] thank god angels don't sleep my guardian
[1:56:28] angel would get me killed
[1:56:32] but think about it they're working all
[1:56:34] the time
[1:56:36] there's another dimension that's faster
[1:56:37] than this one and they're just working
[1:56:39] like crazy
[1:56:40] trying to give you some revelation
[1:56:41] trying to let the holy ghost work in
[1:56:43] your life
[1:56:45] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:56:47] save the spirit that's in him that's
[1:56:49] exactly right when you were in the world
[1:56:51] you understood the world
[1:56:53] but when you get the baptism of the holy
[1:56:55] ghost you ought to be able to understand
[1:56:56] god
[1:56:58] even the things of god knoweth no man
[1:57:00] but the spirit of god now we have
[1:57:02] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:57:05] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:57:08] know the things that are freely given to
[1:57:10] us
[1:57:11] of god
[1:57:12] which things also we speak not in the
[1:57:14] words of man's wisdom
[1:57:15] teaches not not that's not knowledge to
[1:57:18] know how to make a's in school
[1:57:21] that's holy ghost knowledge to know
[1:57:23] whether i'm telling you the truth today
[1:57:24] or not know where the bread around is
[1:57:26] telling you the truth no word preacher's
[1:57:27] telling you the truth or not
[1:57:29] but that which the holy ghost teaches
[1:57:31] comparing spiritual things with
[1:57:32] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:57:35] not the things of the spirit of god for
[1:57:36] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:57:39] can he know them because they are
[1:57:40] spiritually discerned listen we are
[1:57:42] spiritual people
[1:57:45] we should be spiritual people let that
[1:57:47] thing that's inside of you work its way
[1:57:50] out
[1:57:52] you either got a devil spirit in you or
[1:57:54] you got god spear there's only two
[1:57:57] amen
[1:57:58] then when we get that settled we got to
[1:58:00] work on to the outside person sister
[1:58:02] shepard was worried about being born
[1:58:04] again this is her dream she dreamed she
[1:58:06] was on the mountain
[1:58:08] he's talking about i don't have the
[1:58:09] paper i'm going to paraphrase down
[1:58:10] through here i'm sorry she dreamed that
[1:58:12] she saw a rock box like a framework
[1:58:14] sitting on top of this mountain
[1:58:16] and her husband was just behind her and
[1:58:18] she saw a large van standing there work
[1:58:19] clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the
[1:58:22] most pure water that she ever seen and
[1:58:24] poured it into this box
[1:58:26] pouring it into the box
[1:58:28] now remember the headstone hadn't come
[1:58:30] yet
[1:58:31] i got to know there's another
[1:58:33] over there that's got different screen
[1:58:34] but
[1:58:35] this is gone so he was pouring it down
[1:58:37] in here because this was the message he
[1:58:38] was to bring the first part of his
[1:58:40] message everybody with me
[1:58:43] and the rock box would not hold the
[1:58:45] water
[1:58:46] and it rolled right down there and just
[1:58:48] balled up all the trash now where was
[1:58:50] that trash coming from
[1:58:51] it was coming from inside sister shepard
[1:58:54] because this was her
[1:58:57] he was pouring the water in water of the
[1:58:59] word in and trash was coming out oh
[1:59:01] brother wait after the new birth you got
[1:59:03] trash yes
[1:59:06] yes
[1:59:08] your memory reason conscious affection
[1:59:09] imagination is trashy
[1:59:12] and god is working on that if you've got
[1:59:14] the new birth he's not working on your
[1:59:16] soul it is him
[1:59:19] he's working on your memories and
[1:59:20] conscious effects and imagination and
[1:59:22] boiled up all the trash and sticks
[1:59:26] trash
[1:59:27] and everything in there and boiled it
[1:59:29] out
[1:59:31] i like that
[1:59:32] if you want to purify something what do
[1:59:33] you do
[1:59:34] you boil it
[1:59:36] boil it out and roll down that mountain
[1:59:39] and it rolled right over her feet and
[1:59:41] she was standing right in that stuff
[1:59:43] only it didn't stick to her
[1:59:46] it didn't stick to her she was getting a
[1:59:49] revelation
[1:59:52] that that's not going to stick to her
[1:59:54] it might have come out of her
[1:59:56] but it's not going to stick
[1:59:58] amen
[2:00:00] let me read this real quick and then
[2:00:01] we'll close
[2:00:02] i'm going to skip this and we'll talk
[2:00:03] about it next week
[2:00:05] brother we should be y'all need to pray
[2:00:07] for him this
[2:00:09] this wednesday night you love the lord
[2:00:15] that's some good stuff right there but
[2:00:16] i'm gonna pass to it
[2:00:18] watch this right here
[2:00:21] by the way do i get everything i need is
[2:00:22] a new birth yeah you get the whole house
[2:00:26] you get the whole house
[2:00:27] you are the house
[2:00:30] but there's doors inside those doors
[2:00:34] thank god for a prophet
[2:00:36] for in the human heart is just like the
[2:00:37] door
[2:00:38] there to the house
[2:00:40] after you come in come in sir
[2:00:43] sit down
[2:00:44] who's that the holy ghost
[2:00:47] come in
[2:00:50] sit down
[2:00:52] but these other little doors
[2:00:54] i don't want you fooling around in my
[2:00:55] house
[2:00:57] hmm
[2:00:59] i want to speak in a few of those doors
[2:01:01] all kinds of little private doors in
[2:01:03] your private life
[2:01:05] jesus can be in your savior save your
[2:01:07] butt
[2:01:09] don't you never try to tell me what to
[2:01:10] do lord
[2:01:12] hmm
[2:01:14] i know what i want to do and don't you
[2:01:16] never try to rule me
[2:01:18] that's the attitude of many people who
[2:01:20] profess christianity
[2:01:23] am i hitting home somewhere
[2:01:26] brother brown said in klamath falls
[2:01:28] oregon in 1960 here's another sermon you
[2:01:31] know look after you get inside of the
[2:01:33] door of the heart
[2:01:34] you know there's some more little doors
[2:01:35] in there
[2:01:40] lots of little doors
[2:01:42] in the house
[2:01:43] you go and have a little closet here and
[2:01:45] a little room over here and a little
[2:01:46] room over here there are several doors
[2:01:49] many people are ready to welcome the
[2:01:51] lord into their heart
[2:01:53] because they don't want to go to hell
[2:01:56] but they don't want him to be lord when
[2:01:58] he comes in
[2:02:01] well if i come into your house and say
[2:02:02] well come in brother brown well you know
[2:02:04] what i'd do i'd come in go down the
[2:02:05] refrigerator get me a piece of cheese
[2:02:07] and some bologna i would too and sliced
[2:02:09] me off a piece of onion and cut me some
[2:02:11] bread and mustard on it and some lettuce
[2:02:14] i'm hungry and everything and go in and
[2:02:16] take off my shoes and lay across the you
[2:02:18] wouldn't do that at mama's house don't
[2:02:19] try to do that in her house
[2:02:21] okay and lay across the that's a do a
[2:02:24] fold or across the bed and eat the
[2:02:25] sandwich you won't need to sandwich your
[2:02:27] mama's bed either
[2:02:28] and drink a soft drink he's but no
[2:02:30] brother brown's making a point he's
[2:02:31] making himself at home
[2:02:33] the holy ghost is feeling comfortable
[2:02:35] but
[2:02:37] hang up your hat if you said welcome
[2:02:40] i take you at your word
[2:02:42] but do you really welcome the lord jesus
[2:02:46] take him at his word
[2:02:48] so can you take us at our word
[2:02:51] now let's look around some of these
[2:02:53] little doors in the heart for the next
[2:02:54] few minutes
[2:02:55] the first little door you turn to
[2:02:58] there's a door there called pride
[2:03:01] oh my
[2:03:03] you know you don't want to know jesus
[2:03:05] standing in that door
[2:03:07] because he'll take all of it out of you
[2:03:10] he swings that door right open oh if you
[2:03:12] could you say now wait a minute jesus
[2:03:14] you can save me
[2:03:16] but don't go to messing around with my
[2:03:17] pride
[2:03:21] everybody still believe brother brown
[2:03:22] was a prophet i everybody got quiet so
[2:03:24] okay just make sure make sure i hadn't
[2:03:26] trans-migrated into another place
[2:03:29] you can save me but don't you go to
[2:03:31] messing around with my pride
[2:03:35] now if i'm going to have to stand up
[2:03:36] there and act like some of these people
[2:03:38] do i couldn't do it
[2:03:39] then he's not welcome
[2:03:41] let me say this
[2:03:42] he won't stay very long either
[2:03:45] you can just depend on that i wouldn't
[2:03:48] stay if you told me that
[2:03:50] you wouldn't stay if i told you that
[2:03:52] so won't stay if we tell him that pride
[2:03:54] well now i tell you brother branham if
[2:03:56] i'm going to have to get down there on
[2:03:57] that alter crime make my girlfriend hate
[2:03:59] me my boy friend turner turned me down
[2:04:02] my wife tells me i'm a holy roller my
[2:04:04] husband says i've lost my mind now if
[2:04:06] you're going to do that something like
[2:04:07] that stay out jesus that's just exactly
[2:04:10] what they say
[2:04:11] so much
[2:04:13] i'll not do it
[2:04:16] those virtues
[2:04:19] will unlock every door in your personal
[2:04:21] life your private life of things and
[2:04:23] your memory reason conscious affection
[2:04:24] imagination that are bothering us and
[2:04:26] keeping us
[2:04:28] in this world
[2:04:29] that's what we got to clean up next
[2:04:33] is our memory reason conscious effects
[2:04:35] and imagination
[2:04:40] and i'm going to tell you something else
[2:04:42] that love that's up there on top of that
[2:04:43] pyramid that ain't a love that you know
[2:04:46] until you get to there
[2:04:49] sure you get a little piece of it at the
[2:04:50] new birth you get perfect love but it's
[2:04:52] a little bitty piece of it
[2:04:55] brother brown said a button
[2:04:56] did he not say he said you get the holy
[2:04:58] ghost you get a little button
[2:05:00] that button has got to grow though but
[2:05:02] that love up there is not love like you
[2:05:04] love your wife
[2:05:05] it's not love like you love your family
[2:05:07] it's not lovely you say i love to play
[2:05:09] ball i love to do this i love to sing i
[2:05:11] love to play instruments that ain't the
[2:05:13] love that's talking about
[2:05:15] when we get to that love it's probably
[2:05:16] gonna burn our hide
[2:05:19] call this god's love and his love is
[2:05:21] corrective and his love is what pure
[2:05:24] unadulterated there is no ulterior
[2:05:26] motive in that love i love my wife
[2:05:29] because because what
[2:05:32] because she cooks good looks good
[2:05:40] that's going yeah
[2:05:47] can't you cook
[2:05:49] and
[2:05:51] sister sister sister edie's going to get
[2:05:53] you thank you for
[2:05:55] poor zach you won't have to eat out we
[2:05:57] eating out no more
[2:06:02] but listen
[2:06:08] as we love god
[2:06:11] with whatever we've got
[2:06:16] it's just a little bit above filial love
[2:06:21] come on
[2:06:22] memory reason
[2:06:24] conscious
[2:06:25] affection
[2:06:30] most of our love is affection
[2:06:34] we have for here
[2:06:36] but when you love god we're supposed to
[2:06:38] give him everything we got
[2:06:41] because his love is unconditional
[2:06:42] unconditional to us
[2:06:44] our love should be unconditional back to
[2:06:46] him
[2:06:47] but we don't we have conditions brother
[2:06:49] branham pride
[2:06:50] he keeps on doubt i didn't read all of
[2:06:52] man he goes to a bunch of them but
[2:06:53] that's what's going to happen when we go
[2:06:55] through that statue of perfect man when
[2:06:56] we go through those virtues those are
[2:06:58] not virtues
[2:07:00] that man knows anything about
[2:07:03] those are the virtues of almighty god
[2:07:06] contrary to everything we've ever seen
[2:07:08] virtue you know live a virtuous life and
[2:07:10] be a virgin brother brown said that
[2:07:11] ain't it
[2:07:13] he said that virtue is strength
[2:07:15] that virtue is power
[2:07:17] that virtue is something you've got to
[2:07:18] have already inside of you he said oh
[2:07:20] brother brown said i'll just get some
[2:07:22] virtue you can't buy this
[2:07:24] it has to be developed inside of you
[2:07:27] you have to be born again by the spirit
[2:07:29] of god and then let those things work
[2:07:32] let god in
[2:07:33] and let him if he has to kick the door
[2:07:35] down
[2:07:37] let's stand our feet
[2:07:40] let him have his way
[2:07:44] have we really done that
[2:07:47] i asked myself the same question
[2:07:49] have we really done that just let him
[2:07:51] have his way
[2:07:52] no sometimes we get in the way
[2:07:54] most of the time
[2:07:56] we get in the way
[2:07:58] that's our problem
[2:07:59] we've been in a way a long time
[2:08:02] we need to get out of the way
[2:08:04] let go and let god
[2:08:06] have his wonderful way musicians come
[2:08:08] we'll sing one song
[2:08:10] then we'll go to the baptismal service
[2:08:12] god bless you we love you with the love
[2:08:14] of the lord i hope you
[2:08:15] at least you listen enough to stir
[2:08:17] something up in your heart
[2:08:19] i want you to study i want you to say
[2:08:21] what is that man talking about if you've
[2:08:22] never heard that before what what do you
[2:08:24] mean we got to go further in god listen
[2:08:26] you don't want your kids to stay babies
[2:08:29] oh they're beautiful they're young
[2:08:30] they're sweet they're innocent i want
[2:08:32] mine to grow up
[2:08:35] you don't want god wants us to grow up
[2:08:37] not be babies
[2:08:40] and not have to be babied
[2:08:43] listen god's coming back after a wife
[2:08:45] he's not coming back after a bride
[2:08:49] his wife has made herself ready
[2:08:53] his wife has made herself ready

[2:09:12] can learn to wash the dishes
[2:09:14] you know i'm talking about spiritual
[2:09:16] we got to learn these virtues and let
[2:09:18] them become a part of our life to where
[2:09:20] we don't have to be made to do it we
[2:09:22] want to do it
[2:09:25] i'm not made to love you and i love her
[2:09:28] i love her with all my heart
[2:09:31] it's a it's a relationship that we've

[2:10:14] marriage no i don't think so
[2:10:17] come on somebody
[2:10:19] but you can you say that about god
[2:10:22] the day you got born again are you still
[2:10:23] just that little bit in love when you
[2:10:26] should be so in love with him
[2:10:28] some of us have been christians 20 30 40
[2:10:30] 50 years
[2:10:33] what's our issues
[2:10:35] we need virtue
[2:10:36] knowledge temperance patience god that's
[2:10:38] why these virtues are so important and
[2:10:40] they're being so ill-taught in the
[2:10:42] message
[2:10:43] we need these virtues to even to get to
[2:10:46] to where the capstone can come down it's
[2:10:48] got to come down on that
[2:10:51] we got we'll get to that eventually but
[2:10:52] that's what's got to settle down onto
[2:10:56] is the what the whole
[2:10:59] bride of jesus christ letting all those
[2:11:01] virtues work in their life and then the
[2:11:03] headstone is going to come and sit down
[2:11:04] on top then we're going to take a body
[2:11:06] change then we're going to really you're
[2:11:08] going to see the power of the church
[2:11:10] then
[2:11:11] brother brown said
[2:11:14] we'll see it and i believe we will
[2:11:16] we'll see a church on fire
[2:11:18] and not just on fire
[2:11:21] but it'll do the will of
[2:11:22] god and not back up
[2:11:26] be able to speak
[2:11:27] and it happen
[2:11:29] not have to cry and beg and try to find
[2:11:31] a pastor
[2:11:36] okay
[2:11:37] that's what we're heading to that's why
[2:11:39] we need these virtues and we need them
[2:11:40] working in our life
[2:11:42] we need them working so that we can work
[2:11:44] toward
[2:11:45] this son of man revelation which is what
[2:11:46] the seals and it's the thunders and all
[2:11:48] we'll get into that later on but don't
[2:11:50] let that don't let that muddle your mind
[2:11:52] up let's just all make sure we're born
[2:11:54] again
[2:11:55] let's all make sure that foundation is
[2:11:57] real sturdy then let's start building
[2:11:59] the house
[2:12:00] you can't start building a house from
[2:12:02] the walls down or from the roof down you
[2:12:04] start from the what foundation up
[2:12:06] start with the foundation if you're not
[2:12:08] born again if listen what brother dale
[2:12:11] always tell us
[2:12:13] he said seek god every day of your life
[2:12:15] and ask for the new birth he said i'd
[2:12:17] rather know i had it yes
[2:12:19] 20 years ago then for me to
[2:12:22] think i had it 20 years ago and don't
[2:12:24] have it now
[2:12:26] seek god every day
[2:12:29] every day god fill me with the holy
[2:12:31] ghost
[2:12:32] god give me lord these virtues give me
[2:12:34] these give me these promises they're
[2:12:36] mine
[2:12:38] i'm your child i'm crying out listen if
[2:12:40] if uh one of your little babies
[2:12:43] was in a crowd of people
[2:12:45] you've done it before you've been in
[2:12:47] different places and you you kids start
[2:12:49] screaming daddy or mama
[2:12:52] you know exactly whose voice that is
[2:12:55] right sisters
[2:12:56] you can pick that voice out from 5 000
[2:12:59] people standing in a stadium and
[2:13:01] somebody goes mama
[2:13:04] what's the first thing you do say that's
[2:13:06] my kid now all the other mothers are
[2:13:08] mothers
[2:13:09] right
[2:13:10] but they didn't hear that voice
[2:13:12] that's the same way with god that's why
[2:13:14] there's going to be silence in heaven
[2:13:16] because god's going to be listening to
[2:13:17] his bride
[2:13:19] god's not going to be listening to the
[2:13:20] angels he's going to be listening to his
[2:13:21] bride because his bride's going to have
[2:13:22] something to say
[2:13:24] we are going to have something to say in
[2:13:26] this world
[2:13:28] to take a body change we're going to
[2:13:29] have to have something to say
[2:13:31] we got to have something to say that no
[2:13:32] one else has said is death
[2:13:35] you will not destroy
[2:13:37] this body
[2:13:40] death come up your sleeve you just well
[2:13:42] we get scared of the toothache we get
[2:13:44] scared of
[2:13:45] our harder flutter me i'm talking about
[2:13:47] me yeah your heart starts fluttering the
[2:13:49] first thing you do is looking for
[2:13:50] microglycerin pills
[2:13:55] we're just not to the point yet i'm
[2:13:57] sorry but we're getting there
[2:13:58] i believe we keep keep striving and keep
[2:14:01] driving i believe we'll get there
[2:14:03] to where we speak and god will back it
[2:14:05] up
[2:14:06] we've seen it already happen in a small
[2:14:08] portion in this church we've seen the
[2:14:09] third pool happen several times here
[2:14:11] where things have been spoken into
[2:14:13] existence spoke out of existence spoken
[2:14:15] to where these things were and where
[2:14:16] they were not and all that we've seen
[2:14:17] that several times here in this church
[2:14:19] dead raised
[2:14:21] by just a screaming of a brother's name
[2:14:24] just like jesus
[2:14:26] at lazarus tomb same thing
[2:14:28] we've seen it here in part but i want to
[2:14:31] see it like brother brown said one time

[2:14:49] popping of the corn that's what i want

[2:14:54] pop every service i want something to
[2:14:56] pop
[2:14:57] amen amen
[2:14:59] devil will definitely
[2:15:01] he will get agitated and i know he's

[2:15:05] that's his job but you know what god's
[2:15:06] job is to protect us
[2:15:08] sing a song
[2:15:09] then we're going to go have a baptism
[2:15:10] think about the original life
[2:15:13] god's attributes were manifested in his
[2:15:17] breath in this last days
[2:15:22] by the last prophet's message and we
[2:15:26] know who we are
[2:15:30] [Music]

[2:18:54] somebody's going to walk off this world
[2:18:57] without seeing any piece of death
[2:19:00] whatsoever
[2:19:01] [Music]
[2:19:02] oh death may be all the way around us

[2:19:06] jesus did at the tomb of lazarus and say
[2:19:09] saints come out of the ground
