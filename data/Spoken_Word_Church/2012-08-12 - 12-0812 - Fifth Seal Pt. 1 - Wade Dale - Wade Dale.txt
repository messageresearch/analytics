========================================

go ahead and get started good to have each and every one of you here good to have brother Arthur here amen from uh from Ireland brother George Quinn will be speaking for us this these two Services always good to have them just family just family talk funny like we do just family funny like we they talk funny like we do yeah they're from southern Ireland I don't think so you know everybody makes that statement lo I will be with you always about flying in Planes we're the southern states right l i will be with you always he was telling us Southerners he's going to be right here with us mostly because we need it mostly because we need it not just because we're special well we may be special not that kind of special all right now just by way of review just for a few minutes for some of the ones that are that are just starting in the class which is wonderful that's good but we went through seal 1 2 3 and four all right we saw that seal number one we saw an antichrist ride on a white horse but we understand one thing for sure that that white horse rode in the power of the people but there was also a power of the of the almighty God the the true white righteous Church was riding in the first three ages everybody understand right so it wasn't through the seals that Satan was revealed I don't want nothing revealed of this guy I want him exposed for what he is cuz he hid himself in a white righteous church and went riding right through with them God going first Satan couldn't be the original one he can't be an original anything he has to be a copycat all right so he had to ride into the people the people gave him the power and then when the people gave him the power then they went from a saying to a deed to a Doctrine and then to an incarnate pope all right so it started as a little saying it starts as a little saying now we're on the internet sorry it starts with the saying then it becomes a deed in N 606 they brought it into fruition by making it a law and then they crowned a pole so now it's incarnate Satan riding through the church ages so Church age one two and three were in the were parallel with the first seal everybody got that say Amen all right pretty much that's pretty weak but you know say amen amen better all right so now that white righteous Church there was a true church in the first three ages but what happened to them they began to become part of that that white horse rider Antichrist system right and then when that came into an incarnate Pope he began to speak CU it says to give him a sword he began to speak and what did he do he spoke blaspheme Blasphemous names he started back in those ages blaspheming the red horse was because of what killing the people there was 68 million Protestants killed in the fourth Church age so the fourth Church age parallels the second seal all right second seal is a red horse red is always blood all right so as we saw in justification in the first church a or the first seal it was a white righteous Church disguised Satan disguised as a white righteous church right but there was a white righteous church that was truly Justified during that time so the first seal would show justification to a group of people and even show us our justification we weren't back there in the first three ages we're up here in this age but we get all the ages combined so the first seal shows our justification that we are if we're truly Justified we're already glorified if we're truly Justified then what happened God wiped you as white as you'll ever be as far as your sins being gone in the in the past right but the unclean Spirit still there he has to come over into sanctification which is the red red always means blood red always means sanctification all right so it's a killing of your old nature beginning to kill that old nature like I said before make that Stony heart see this is not pliable you can't move this cuz why smash Stone but he said I'll put in a fleshly heart flesh is pliable you can stretch it and pull it and all these things we can tell that by the way we're getting older amen amen the older on say Amen the younger on say I don't know what you're talking about the older one say wait a little while gravity will take over but that's the second seal there was a red horse rode through the fourth Church Age killing 68 million Protestants um that was Columbus age which Columba was from Ireland they have a place over there where his b where he lived right yeah I'm where he's buried and where he's buried okay so dad and him went to see I think Mom and him went to see and Anna and Richard and him they went to see it when they were over there so that was Columba but it was just the spirit of the age was the ox Spirit of the first age was the lion o which was the second age which was a labor all they had to do was claim Jesus Christ you know they didn't know nothing about the seal they didn't know nothing about a lot of things but they knew that Jesus Christ was their Savior and he washed them in his blood they accepted that that became the fourth Church age they live through that age and they died because the Catholic Church proclaimed that if you're not a Catholic you're going to die that's just the way it was you know and it was better for the Catholic Church Catholic Church to kill you during that time they were thinking and they were doing you a service all right knowing that they were actually killing 68 million true Christians during that Dark Ages all right and that was the second seal well the third seal goes in let's just read it right here and when he had opened the third seal cuz we're getting closer to the fifth seal and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say coming see him beheld a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair balances in his hand and I heard in the midst of the four Beast saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Marley for offin see that not hurt the oil and white they were coming out of that fourth Church AE and then now the third seal is parallel of the fifth and sixth Church age right class participation I need an amen that's the fifth and sixth Church age that's Luther and Wesley Luther come out and started the protesting of the Catholic Church which made him a Protestant that's why you have Protestants and Catholics they protested and they became known as Protestants because they said hey the Catholic church is not right we're going to protest that's what when Luther nailed those thesis on the wall he was not condemning the Catholic Church per se as a as being the Antichrist because he didn't have that knowledge he didn't have that knowledge cuz he wanted the Catholic Church to just stop some of the things they were doing but God was God was happy with Luther because Luther preached the just shall live by faith in other words Luther did the Penance Luther did the thing he crawled on the ground he he tried to get rid of those demons but one day God shown the light on one scripture hey the just shall live by faith not by those works and he pulled away from the Catholic Church actually you know what happened the Catholic Church EXC communed him so he didn't really exactly come out of her my people they kicked her out right they kicked him out of the place you know they kicked him out and told him it said he was a heretic and all these things but but what happened during that during that third seal was is there was a lot of knowledge remember that's the Man line ox man the man age the fifth and sixth age that's when the Bible became became printed T Tinsdale W cliff and all those came into being to bring the Bible together and then in King King James in 1611 he puts the Bible together all right so that's when man started put putting it on paper and a print and press Man became to be very knowledgeable about things uh they began to travel around they begin to uh to preach the word of God you had Luther and then you had Wesley come up where Wesley was a little bit higher in sanctification but they still all were trinitarians they still all baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost they believed in three gods they believed that Catholic Doctrine but God was pleased with just a little part of what Luther said the just shall live by faith get away from all that Penance and all all that stuff you don't have to pay God to be good in other words he don't need your money to be good you know you just the judge shall live by faith the faith I have is the faith that God has cleansed me and washed me from my sins right and then keeps me watched so we had the first seal the second seal was sanctification and the third seal then is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say well how is that well it's a black horse if you are still alive you're not born again you can't be born again unless you die first you can't be born again if you haven't died from your first birth physically no that's right spiritually yes if the old man's still alive you don't have death you don't have the black horse you understand the black horse we know is in opposition but there is a death to the spiritual see we get to spiritual part of the seals we don't get the natural part we get the spiritual part of the seals that's why we're trying to show I I've had many people that that we spoke for that have never seen that they take the seals as the white horse rider being the Antichrist is a great Revelation that's not that's just the beginning of Revelation that was just showing that there was another person out here that was fighting against what brother Brandon was preaching because he he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a white horse rider well where was that horse rider before he's made that statement he was in William brand right not in his soul not in his soul he was born again a prophet but light had not Shone on that part yet he preached the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost for years for years and had signs Miracles and wonders after that because God winked at his IGN just like he Winks at our ignorance but once light shines on it once that Prophet brought the true revelation of the seals we have no excuse anymore right and I agree with some people the seals are closed because if they were open you'd act different right so the seals are closed to a group of people and only open to a group of people that God can reveal them to all right so yes the seals are open and no they're not that's just as plain as they can put it they just they are and there aren't because you got two classes of people and that's it you got a True Believer and unbeliever there's no gray area in between right now there's walks of life when you're Justified and you're forgiven of your sins you have a walk in life as you walk through life and sure God will save you because of what you have confessed but there's going to come a point in time where you're going to realize something happened in justification then you're going to realize something happened in sanctification then you're going to realize that he did kill that old nature of that old man he can't kill your soul or he killed the person you are but he kills the old nature you were born with that's why Jesus said Nicodemus you must be born again he didn't say we need to be born again cuz he was born right the first time he was Body Spirit and soul almighty God we're Body Spirit made down here and our soul was given to us by permission of God and if it goes through life the nature of that person will be evil that's right so there has to be a death that's Nicodemus you must be born again in other words you got to die and come back up a new person that's why when we baptize people we baptize them and they come back up in the newness of Life why they're old man's dad crucified not divorced black horse is not divorce that means something's still alive if you divorce it but if that thing's dead see you can marry again you can marry Christ if you're not you're married to the old you're married to the devil that's why the brother R had to come and show that that Satan and God Is So Close they would almost deceive the very La so that's why the seals had to open up that breach cuz from a sinner to a saint the breach is Jesus Christ I don't care who you are that's right and he showed that breach brother Arthur Satan was riding right down through the church ages right there with god he's a closest thing to God there is right he was riding right down through those Church ages right there with them with God he was in his shadow but when it comes to the end time brother BR said there's too many Loose Ends to be tied up what were the Loose Ends this guy excuse me this guy was playing Church M and it was time to say here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse rider he was showing the separation he was showing that there goes that other guy there goes that man that man of sin that's sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God now we know it's going to be a temple over there but remember what D said Sunday or Wednesday if we're here to see all these seals break in their natural form we've missed it we don't see the man of sin sitting in the temple of God we see him sitting right here that's right then when we see him go away riding away then what you got you got God Almighty standing there in the form he wants to be which is the bride he doesn't want this he wants separation come out of her my people separate yourself from that unclean thing oh but it looks so pretty John admired it even in Revelations with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he looked at that church and he the Bible said he admired it brother Bram said he looked at it and said it was beautiful wondered why that church wasn't a good church right he's talking about the people not a building that's right he's wondering why that group of people is not as good as him well God just wrote him right down through the seals when he showed him the Thunders he said John don't write cuz it's going to be revealed at the end time seal it up put it back up people at the end time will will take over all right for seal I know y'all all been here but some of you hadn't so we kind of go through this again fourth seal what is the fourth seal and when I open the fourth seal I heard the voice of the four Beast fourth Beast who was the fourth Beast an eagle all right so we're going up into the prophetic the last seal is parallel with the last Church age the seventh Church age messenger was an eagle and we have the eagle anointing is that correct but Satan's still riding he's still here and when he had opened the four seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast they come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse now I told you you before take white take red and take black put it in a little container and Stir It Up you're going to get the most putrid pale chalky nasty looking something between black and white and red you ever seen in your life but what is the last horse the last horse rider is all the other three combined remember Satan gets his power just like God gets his power he gets his power in the people gather the people together well what's Satan done in this age he's gathered all those horses together and but what happens in the last age Behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death now here we come with a name this is the only age that the name of Jesus Christ in its entirety I said in its entirety now the first three ages they had the fullness they had the fullness for their age but this seventh age has got all the ages combined just like Satan wraps all three of those horses into one pale God wraps justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he wraps it up and puts it in a group of people and gives them the pure unadulterated word all right so you got justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost which is black then you've got the last number four which is all the other three combined which is the word of God all right so you got to have justification you got to have sanctification you got to have the baptism of Holy Ghost to know what the word says is that correct all right you do not know what the word says until then you say well I can read well you know what I was reading scripture the other day where Jesus talking about Ting talking about U Jesus was talking to the people and he was telling them he said look of course it was coming through Paul but he said ever learning never coming to the knowledge of the truth ever learning that's what we got in the message Church a lot of Learners a lot of people that can read a lot of people want to know all these great things and can't live the simple thing amen I'm telling you people everybody wants to know about the seals but they ain't got you got to have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working in your life before these seals are going to open to you you're going to maybe understand them in a baby form but unless you get that statute of a perfect man right in you seals are no good now no shame to that because you know what faith of the fathers you're in a group with Paul irenius Martin some of those great ones that was the faith of the fathers they had the water baptism right they had no eternal hell right they had water baptism right but they died that's why I'm telling you the first four seals does not destroy death it shows death destroyed but it doesn't destroy that right everybody understand that got some eyebrows doing this but it doesn't because the fourth Church mean the fourth seal is the rapture well there's Millions upon millions of people going to take a Rapture that's laying in the grave and dying today laying in a grave that's never going to understand what these seals are it wasn't a requirement when they were alive but as long as we're alive it's a requirement in this church age the seals have been open the book has been open and it's calling the name are the ones in the book like Dad said it's sealed up though remember when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost you're sealed until the day of redemption but what's sealed up that's got to work inside of he's not just sealed up and put on the shelf right what John do with the book he ate it brother Arthur you didn't see the book anymore you saw John but the book was in John that's right you never saw the book we're not going to walk around with these in heaven that's right this will be disappeared in here the seals will be disappeared in here we're not going to walk around with a quotebook in heaven no we are going to be the quotebook we are going to be the Living Word made manifest in another form they were all the Living Word made manifest in another form but they did not have the opening of the seals they did not have that eagle anointing where you can see this way this way this way and this way a line is real Fierce a Lon is real fierce but he's on This Tall right real Fierce though man he can kill you but he can't see no Tall Grass This Tall line can't say a thing that's what was happening in that first church age they were first three ages they were bold forget that thing they were bold they had a lot of grit they knew what they were talking about but they couldn't see no further than that grass above their head cuz the Lin's about my size right here even a big one but now the ox is a little bit bigger he can see a little bit further but he eats a lot of grass so he has to do this the man stands up a little higher you know we can see a little further we can even with knowledge get on the ladder and see a little further which an ox can't do that and a lion can't do that they're Earthbound right a man's Earthbound in his natural form we're Earthbound we don't have wings but now watch an eagle though that eagle can go up higher than anybody soar up see way out he can see all the way in you know as long as he flies he still sees the curvature of the earth he can go all the way around the earth and and he is not impeded in his sight his sight is what Eternal that's why we become Eternal creatures ni candy Eternal creatures in God and in this last Church age God has give us the revelation of these seals to change our body now here we go back to what I said about the first four because we're going to read if you have your seal book bring it next Sunday we are going to read more out of it in the fifth seal right here don't know if we're going to have time to get that one let's just hang on then let's read this first all right in the fifth seal page 306 but it's paragraph 77 72 he reads there's no Beast there and represents power we know that there's no living creatures now I want you to keep that in your mind now let's read Revelations chapter 6 verse 1 through 8 is the four seals opening right the four seals opening up now brother Rand said the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal but we still got five six and seven all right everybody get that so far we got we got 1 2 3 4 four and then the Rapture takes place right all right we go up we're this is the this is the church agent ver three one two right here and one makes seven that's all the church ages you say what about the fifth sixth and seventh seal when brother Brandon reads that fifth seal he doesn't see a combat Beast he doesn't see any Riders why he says there's no living creatures left why rides to the rapture they're not on the earth anymore 1 2 3 and four then a Rapture take place on the four seal you say well how in the world that we got 5 six and 7 now what's going to happen what we're going to go through next start next Sunday SE 5 6 and 7 is for one thing and that's for this guy right here right now we understand these are these are if you don't have the inside guy you're not going inter rure that's right if you don't have the inside guy he's not going to take over this outside guy that's right so if you're not born again don't worry about it you're going to miss it anyway that's right but if you're born again like I said there's millions of people that don't understand this that God said okay that's fine but I'm going to have one group of people we which are alive and remain that's right that's going to stand and let Revelation the revelation of seal 56 and 7 so permeate our being till we're going to be changed in a moment in point this guy the inside gu already went through it change it don't change no more it's just as Eternal as God ever was or ever will be you can't add more to God but you can add more to your Revelation because you were born between Satan and Eve or your mom being born in your Mom and Daddy's you know sex act but the ones inside of you you've heard me preach it many times Genesis 1 dad preaching Genesis 1 and that's what that book I was talking about book book of books that book of books is that Genesis 126 that those people never sinned in the first place they never had sin that's why the book was worthy enough for the lamb to reach and get it he's not going to get a smudy book and all that seen happen in glory we're already glorified that's right but he's got to show the seene brother R said I was reading it the other night he said the fourth seal I mean the fourth chapter of Revelation I'm getting too fast the fourth chapter of Revelations the bride goes up right so that's a Heavenly scene us around the throne praising worshiping God who's there the four beast that's right every where the four beasts are is where the bride is because we are those four beasts made manifest in human form right all those four Beast lonox Man and Eagle you all have that anointing today if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why brother randam saw that though he he saw those four creatures gone he said therefore the Rapture must have taken place because chapter four you see them in heaven so four is a Heavenly scene five is a Heavenly scene but brother R said number four is being there number five shows you how you got there right Revelation 5 shows us how we got there what the lamb took the book in that lamb don't take the book and change somebody's body out here there's no reason to shout that's right right that's why John was crying amen John was crying cuz he said if this guy don't get redeemed right we just going to keep keep dying and keep going on but he saw seven horns and seven eyes John had already wrote about the church ages he knew there was only seven of them I just got that I don't know where that come from but see he got that seven he saw seven if he looked at that lamb and saw seven horns and seven eyes that's why he was crying he said it was over Church Ages were done everything's finished why is that book book still in the hand because the book in the hand of the one on the throne is the Father's Throne the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what goes into the Rapture is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but like I said before a theophany can't bleed so what was sitting on the throne of your heart down through seven Church Ages was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was the father's Throne that father had the book but there had to come a flesh God come and take that book it's an imorph it's not two people right God standing here with the book sitting here on the throne of your heart the baptism of the Holy Ghost the rapturing faith sitting there but the book's in his hand but as long as that book stays in his hand man's physically going to die and that's what John was looking at man is physically dying dying dying dying look around me he's and he was almost 90 he was getting close to 9 so I mean he was he was almost dead brother Arthur himself and he was crying why are we still dying y but when he saw that flesh God who he had met saw him die on the cross that's why he began to shout he knew that man was worthy cuz he was a flesh man at one time that was a lamb that was bleeding theophanies don't bleed cuz theophany God what come to you to New Birth But realize this I don't want to confuse you God is a spirit that's right right they that worship Him must worship Him spirit and truth that's that's that's the Eternal God that's the god sitting on your throne today Spirit God but when that Spirit God comes into that flesh I don't care if you're born in sin shape and in iniquity now see Jesus was born sinless that's right he was worthy to take the book but those inside that book were worthy it just took somebody to break that thing open like I was showing you the the illustration I hope that was good about in Deuteronomy that father was tired of people talking about his daughter a she was this no she was that oh she wasn't she was nothing down Through the Ages but buddy when he laid that cloth that token of her virginity there was no doubt there was no doubt she was a virgin right and all that she had done all they thought she had done he said shut up there's the evidence and that's what Jesus did when he took the book he said here's the evidence it said a bloody lamb here's the evidence that I can take this book and open it and show the people that's in it but see in type you and I like Daddy said you got to take a book cuz your name's in there you got to claim that book that Bloody lamb brother R said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand tonight and there goes the white horse rider who was the lamb inside of him the lamb was inside that man the Lamb's inside of you if you're born again today but he don't want to stop there he wants the book to be totally completed that's right he wants the people to shut up be silent this is my people brother bis was doing a good job of that you know Friday but hey we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we have moved from church to bride to wife right cuz once that once that Daddy laid that cloth down you know what that was a symbol of she was somebody's wife now right she was no more his little sweetheart girl he was no more she was no more a bride waiting she was married the honeymoon had been consummated she was now his wife and there was nothing anybody could do about it if you keep it straight now this junk they do out in the world but keep it straight that was somebody's wife she he had claims on her until remember what I said until your daughters you're your daughter's Holy Ghost until what until that daughter comes out from under your roof I'm talking about the natural now you're her Holy Ghost until that daughter comes out from under your roof you're her Holy Ghost that's what the prophet said right but now once she is married and consummated a marriage fathers it's okay that's still your daughter but she's not yours like she used to be anymore she's took on somebody else's name she's died June Thomas died 33 years ago right when she took my name she'll never be June Thomas anymore why she died right same way with us I call you remember there's Brides brides churches churches I read the quote to you upstairs Brides brides churches churches he said but there'll come one that will be the wife that will be the one that will consummate this whole thing and God's going to stand up and say that's my wife and there's the proof but it's got to be the blood got to be the blood it's always got to be the blood even now in this fifth seal of Grace that we're going to start talking about it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ it all got to go back to the blood everything's got to go back to the blood not the literal compound of the blood but the meaning the life behind the blood all right so now just for about one minute we got four seals reg takes place on the four seal but you got to there's got to be a group of people right in here that's going to consummate this thing right there right in this I'm putting it right here at the end of this church age the seventh Church age cuz then we take a Rapture somebody's got to be changed in the body so we're going to start next Sunday bring your seal book read the fifth seal see how many times I want you to Circle if you don't like her wri in your book write it anyway every time brother brand says Grace in that fifth seal because remember remember the fifth seal is to a group of people that don't even want God they don't know one Speck about Jesus Christ they don't know nothing about this man you talking about true justification see this is justification here that we're talking about here that's when you become white righteous in your walk with God your sins are forgiven you keep walking in the sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry places and if you don't fill it up with something he's going to come back can fill you with a religious spirit but if you go on and go to the next step that's death to you God comes in and says hey I'm going to give you my spirit all right then you're going to begin in the fourth seal which is all of them combined you're going to begin to understand this word you going to begin to understand what this word says so do not think that the seals is revealing the Antichrist brother R never says that he says he says the seals reveal Jesus Christ this is all Christ but the bride goes up the four seal but you got to have five six and seven before we get out of here all right so we're going to explain that real slow read the fifth seal read chapter 6 verse well read the fifth seal in the Bible then read the fifth seal in your book Circle every time brother BR talks about gra cuz how many of you were looking for God when he found you nobody we didn't even want him didn't even want him brother AR we didn't want him because our old nature was against him but see he comes looking for us and when he does he said hey I want you I'm going to justify you whether you like it or not then you begin to like it then you begin to love it then it's a love affair right okay yeah
