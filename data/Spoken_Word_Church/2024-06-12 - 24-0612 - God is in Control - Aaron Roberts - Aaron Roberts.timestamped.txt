[3:58] 16 we at verse
[4:02] one says the preparations of the heart
[4:05] in man and the answer of the tongue is
[4:08] from the Lord all the ways of man are
[4:11] clean in his own eyes but the Lord weth
[4:13] the spirits commit thy Works unto the
[4:16] Lord and thy thoughts shall be
[4:18] established the Lord hath made all
[4:20] things for himself ye even the wicked
[4:22] for the day of evil every everyone that
[4:25] is proud in heart is an Abomination to
[4:28] the Lord though hand join in hand he
[4:31] shall not be unpunished but mercy and
[4:33] Truth by Mercy and Truth iniquity is
[4:35] purged and by the fear of the Lord men
[4:37] depart from
[4:39] Evil when a man's ways please the Lord
[4:41] he maketh even his enemies to be at
[4:44] peace with him better is a little with
[4:46] righteousness than great revenues
[4:48] without
[4:49] right a man's heart deviseth his way but
[4:53] the Lord directeth his steps amen God
[4:55] bless you tonight you may be seated and
[4:58] uh with one title
[5:00] this God is in
[5:03] control and U just want to look at a few
[5:06] scriptures and things tonight but uh I
[5:09] was
[5:10] uh I was doing a little doing a little
[5:13] reading and uh I run across this
[5:16] man and uh you know uh people have a
[5:21] real real issue when you know uh trying
[5:24] to trying to come to the realization
[5:27] that you know God is in control of all
[5:29] things things he created all things he
[5:31] put everything in in motion and you know
[5:34] there's there's nothing that that didn't
[5:37] come into existence that God didn't put
[5:39] in place and and you know God has a law
[5:42] for everything he puts everything in in
[5:45] motion and and everything works just the
[5:48] way God created it but um I want to go
[5:51] to this quote I this quote is from God
[5:55] of this evil
[5:56] age and brother brandom says and the
[5:58] world seems to be in the most evil age
[6:01] that ever was he said never in any age
[6:05] did women act like that but just before
[6:08] the destruction of the Andel luian world
[6:11] and Jesus referred to it he said we'll
[6:13] get to that after a while he said has
[6:14] God lost control or is he just
[6:17] permitting another agency to control I
[6:20] wonder the true answer to this question
[6:24] is to my opinion that there are two
[6:25] opposing spirits in the world today at
[6:27] work now there can't be no more than two
[6:31] two heads and one of them is the holy
[6:32] spirit at work the other one is the
[6:34] spirit of the devil and in the last days
[6:37] in deception he said the two Spirits one
[6:40] of them God's Holy Spirit and the other
[6:42] one's the devil's Spirit working in
[6:44] deception the people of the Earth are
[6:47] now making their choice the holy spirit
[6:51] is here calling out a bride for Christ
[6:53] he is doing it by vindicating his Word
[6:55] of Promise to her for this age showing
[6:58] that it is Christ he said if the finger
[7:01] is supposed to move in this age the
[7:03] finger will move am he said if the fot
[7:06] is if the foot is supposed to move in
[7:07] this age the foot will move if the eye
[7:10] is to see in this age the eye will see
[7:13] he said the spirit of God as it as it's
[7:16] growed into the full stature of God in
[7:19] the age that we're now living He said
[7:22] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[7:24] message of the hour and the Holy Spirit
[7:26] is doing this so that the people that
[7:28] believe God will be called out of this
[7:31] chaos the devil's Unholy spirit is here
[7:34] calling his church by the error as usual
[7:37] by the perversion of the word of God
[7:40] like he did at the beginning see it
[7:42] coming right back to that seed time
[7:44] again from Eden here it is
[7:47] again and I was I was listening to this
[7:50] man I you know brother Brown talks about
[7:52] you know has God lost control or is
[7:54] there another one that's in control and
[7:56] you know this man was was speaking on on
[7:59] Free Will and he was and he was speaking
[8:02] about you know everybody talks about
[8:04] God's in control and all of this and and
[8:07] he's like well you know all of this has
[8:09] to go back to to Free Will and you know
[8:12] it's like God built a box and he just
[8:15] put these parameters up and then he just
[8:18] dumped everything in this box and he
[8:20] shook it up and then he just let it go
[8:22] and he stand there trying to figure out
[8:23] what's going to take place
[8:26] next and it's like well you know brother
[8:29] said he said you wouldn't run your
[8:31] business like that he said God didn't
[8:33] run his business like that and it's like
[8:35] you know how much you know because if if
[8:38] we actually have this kind of concept we
[8:41] have this kind of belief in God that he
[8:43] do you know God doesn't know everything
[8:44] everything is not ordered of the Lord
[8:46] there's not a divine order to everything
[8:48] then exactly how much does God know I
[8:51] mean because if God doesn't know
[8:53] everything if God doesn't have full
[8:55] control of everything and knows what's
[8:57] knows the end from the beginning he
[8:59] knows everything that's ever going to
[9:01] happen to you he's going to know where
[9:02] everywhere every step every misstep
[9:04] every mistake you've ever made and he's
[9:06] already got an attonement made for that
[9:08] because he stood as a lamb slain before
[9:11] the foundation of the world so if all of
[9:13] this isn't laid out then exactly how
[9:15] much does God
[9:16] know how much has God got in
[9:19] control because if he don't have it then
[9:22] exactly how much can we put our
[9:23] confidence in him because if he don't
[9:25] know then how are we supposed to I mean
[9:27] what are we supposed to do let's just
[9:29] all eat drink and be married cause
[9:31] tomorrow we
[9:33] die but you know it's so amazing because
[9:36] people actually will listen to
[9:39] this why because that is that is the
[9:42] perversion that Satan has in people's
[9:44] mind that he has created this perversion
[9:47] that all he wants to do is tear down and
[9:50] he want and he wants to make all this
[9:51] confusion that everybody doesn't well
[9:53] there there are no absolutes there's
[9:55] there's nothing to stand on it's just
[9:57] all wishy-washy there's nothing no God
[10:00] has a plan there is there is absolutes
[10:04] there is there's a because there is
[10:05] something solid because it's the word of
[10:07] God the word of God is solid he won't
[10:09] change God God said I change not I am
[10:12] God and I change not if he ever had one
[10:14] thought he will always have that thought
[10:16] you can't change God's mind he already
[10:19] knows what's going to take
[10:21] place and so that's that is where we put
[10:23] our confidence today that we don't have
[10:25] to worry about what's going to take
[10:26] place tomorrow or any other time because
[10:29] you know just like brother bam was
[10:31] speaking of you know he said if I knew
[10:32] that the the Lord was coming in the
[10:34] morning he said I would just go ahead
[10:36] and plant potatoes I just go to work I
[10:38] just go on and do everything like I was
[10:39] going like a just like a regular day if
[10:42] I knew the Lord was coming why because
[10:44] that is what God wants me to be doing
[10:46] because I'm up and doing the things that
[10:47] I'm supposed to be doing not waiting on
[10:50] thinking that something's going to
[10:51] change so just get up go to work all the
[10:53] things that you got to do go to school
[10:55] get ready and just go through because
[10:57] you're going to meet the Lord but you
[10:58] know what you live your life the way
[10:59] you're supposed to live it and
[11:02] everything that you do is to honor
[11:06] God and in the scripture here in
[11:08] Proverbs 19:21 the scripture tells us it
[11:11] says there are many devices in a man's
[11:14] heart nevertheless the counsel of the
[11:16] Lord that shall stand now there's a
[11:20] couple of
[11:22] uh uh translations here one of them is a
[11:27] uh is a a modern version I can't
[11:30] remember what it was but it says we may
[11:32] make a lot of plans but the Lord will do
[11:35] what he has
[11:38] decided and the another translation says
[11:41] people may make all kinds of plans but
[11:43] the Lord's will is going to be
[11:46] done so it doesn't matter what what goes
[11:50] on or what happens or all the plans that
[11:52] we make God's plan God's word God's will
[11:55] is what's going to take place that's all
[11:57] that
[11:58] matters because you know we can make a
[12:00] lot of plans but you know we can't
[12:01] change what's going to take
[12:04] place because you know I uh you know
[12:09] Adam and I we were we went to uh Alabama
[12:12] over the weekend and and Monday night we
[12:15] were coming home and I thought we was
[12:16] going to be home well we got home about
[12:19] Tuesday
[12:20] Morning our truck the water pump went
[12:22] out in the truck and I was stuck on the
[12:23] side of I20 for about 3 three and a half
[12:26] hours but you know what I didn't expect
[12:29] that happened and I didn't want it to
[12:31] happen but you know what it
[12:34] happened and so you know what you just
[12:36] have to deal with
[12:39] it well you know what it' been nice to
[12:42] know ahead of time it was going to go
[12:43] out because you know what it's like well
[12:45] I know that my water pump's going to go
[12:46] out so I'm just going to go put it in
[12:47] the shop and have it
[12:50] replaced but you know what that other
[12:53] one that they put on there it could have
[12:54] failed
[12:56] too there's there's because nothing that
[12:59] manmade is
[13:01] foolproof so I mean you know but the
[13:03] thing is is you know the Lord took care
[13:05] of us we got
[13:07] home and you you get out on the on the
[13:09] side of the road at night and you know
[13:12] there's a lot of uh people that are a
[13:14] little bit
[13:16] off you know you never know who's going
[13:18] to come along and visit
[13:22] you but I mean there's people out there
[13:24] and that's all they're looking for is
[13:25] somebody that um try to pray on
[13:28] something
[13:31] somebody I don't know maybe maybe when I
[13:33] got out of the truck maybe people just
[13:34] realized that they didn't want to mess
[13:36] with me they
[13:37] just it's like you know I don't I don't
[13:40] know I don't know how how hard it would
[13:42] be to overtake him so I'll just go find
[13:44] somebody else that's smaller
[13:46] yeah but you know the Lord takes care of
[13:49] us we don't we don't know what's going
[13:51] to take place we don't know what what
[13:52] tomorrow holds but We Know Who Holds
[13:54] Tomorrow we know what's going to take
[13:57] place and see all we got to do is put
[13:58] our trust in him because even in in the
[14:01] Book of John he said when when Jesus was
[14:03] speaking you know because he was
[14:05] speaking of him coming in the word he
[14:07] said when the spirit of Truth is come he
[14:10] said he will lead you and guide you into
[14:12] all
[14:14] truth so he has a plan for
[14:17] you so there is a plan and and see these
[14:20] things that that he said he will lead
[14:22] you and guide you and he said the things
[14:24] that you
[14:25] hear you'll hear these things because he
[14:27] said and he will show you things to come
[14:30] so he wanted so he he was telling the
[14:32] disciples this is what's going to take
[14:34] place see there's a so we have the
[14:37] spirit of God to lead us to show us
[14:39] these things we don't know what's going
[14:40] to take place but it's a stepbystep
[14:42] process we don't know all things but he
[14:45] knows all things but you know in the
[14:46] right time he's going to show us what we
[14:49] need to know he's going to lead us and
[14:51] guide us and show us the steps that we
[14:53] need to
[14:54] take and you know when when people say
[14:57] well the condition that the word world
[14:59] is in well you know what none of it took
[15:01] God by
[15:02] surprise you know God's not God's not
[15:04] worried God didn't just uh wake up one
[15:06] morning and and see the the whole world
[15:08] in chaos he already knew what was going
[15:11] to take place he he already had
[15:13] everything worked out he had an answer
[15:14] for every problem before the problem
[15:16] ever got here so everything was already
[15:18] laid out and and so when when he come
[15:20] and set all these things in motion he
[15:22] knew what was going to take place
[15:24] because when when he came out as as
[15:26] Elohim in the beginning self-existing
[15:28] and he began to speak the word and he
[15:30] said let there be and let there be and
[15:32] let there be you know what he wasn't
[15:33] surprised when things come into
[15:35] existence and he didn't he wasn't
[15:36] surprised when everything worked exactly
[15:38] the way he had it because exactly what
[15:40] was in his mind came into fruition and
[15:42] then he began to watch those things
[15:44] swirl and everything come into existence
[15:46] before there before there was an atom or
[15:48] a molecule or anything he already had a
[15:51] divine order for all of it and all of a
[15:52] sudden it became into the existence and
[15:54] he done exactly the way that God had in
[15:56] his mind when he spoke it into existence
[15:59] see can to do that and so there was
[16:01] there was nothing out of cater and then
[16:03] you know he be brother B said when he
[16:04] was self-existing Elohim he said the
[16:07] first thing that that I believe that he
[16:08] created was angels and he created angels
[16:10] and then you know we know that Lucifer
[16:13] and the Angels were all created well you
[16:14] know here here he is in this in this
[16:17] masterpiece that he begins to create and
[16:19] and put everything in order when he
[16:21] began to do this you know here he is and
[16:23] he creates Lucifer and brother M says
[16:25] that you know he said Satan and he said
[16:27] Satan was just like him except he wasn't
[16:29] a Creator but he was just like him you
[16:31] know at the same level he had everything
[16:33] and he like wow you know what you know
[16:35] if I was going to pick an enemy I would
[16:37] want somebody I could put under my thumb
[16:39] I wouldn't want anybody that was real
[16:40] tough you know that had anything you
[16:42] know I just want him to be the weakest
[16:43] little fell
[16:45] around but you know what he s somebody
[16:48] that was
[16:50] formidable that's right you know he just
[16:53] he just didn't have some
[16:55] pushover but you know what he was
[16:57] created
[16:59] yes sir and you know what even though
[17:02] even though he you know he he had this
[17:04] great power in his mind I'm going be
[17:06] like the most high you know I'm going to
[17:07] exalt myself and you know I'm going to
[17:09] do all these great things and you know
[17:11] he he tried to take the angels from you
[17:13] he took a third of the angels and you
[17:15] know he tried to do all these things and
[17:16] you know I'm going overcome Michael and
[17:18] and God and all those things and you
[17:20] know he he had a plan in a that he was
[17:22] going
[17:23] to but you know none of that could come
[17:25] to
[17:27] pass because because see Satan doesn't
[17:30] realize but he is but as being a cre a
[17:34] created
[17:36] being part of creation he is bound
[17:41] because the law of creation exists over
[17:45] him so that law that he is under is
[17:48] still going to hold him into that place
[17:50] no matter what he does he's still going
[17:52] to go to the place that God created for
[17:57] him but he said he said how art thou
[18:00] fallen from Heaven Lucifer son of the
[18:03] morning see he said he said thou was
[18:05] created perfect until iniquity was found
[18:07] in you
[18:10] amen see it wasn't God done that but he
[18:12] was that was his choice and by his
[18:16] choice he came into that place and now
[18:19] because of the law of God because of the
[18:22] law of all of God's word all of creation
[18:26] all of God's plan there is a law to
[18:31] that so because he turned the word
[18:34] down because he got out of his position
[18:38] and thought I'm I'm going be I'm going
[18:39] exalt myself over the stars of heaven
[18:42] I'm GNA be higher than God greater than
[18:44] God well then guess what he's going to
[18:46] the lowest
[18:47] pits he's got a place in in the Lake of
[18:51] Fire but that's his choice not anybody
[18:53] else's
[18:55] choice but see he's still Bound by that
[18:58] and even today God because who he is
[19:03] because the scripture tells us Romans 13
[19:05] says he said let every soul be subject
[19:08] under the higher powers for there is no
[19:10] power but of god the powers that be are
[19:14] ordained of God so we know by the
[19:16] scripture that even though that Satan
[19:19] has a power that he can operate in and
[19:22] he's he's contrary to God but he still
[19:25] has but he's still Bound By The Law of
[19:27] God
[19:28] amen he can only do so
[19:32] much see we see that in the life of Job
[19:35] when when God when when God was speaking
[19:37] to to the devil and he came and he said
[19:40] you know he said have you considered my
[19:41] servant job when he when he began to
[19:44] talk about and he began to see the life
[19:46] of Job and what the kind of person that
[19:48] job was and he's like well you know is
[19:50] it off or not because You' got a hedge
[19:52] around
[19:54] him see the thing is is as as Satan had
[19:57] walked through the Earth and seen the
[19:58] man that job was and then all of a
[19:59] sudden he's like well you know what he
[20:02] only does that because what you've done
[20:03] for
[20:06] him and he didn't realize God knew what
[20:09] kind of person job
[20:12] was because he knew that he would stand
[20:15] the test amen see he knew what was going
[20:18] to take place and that's the reason he
[20:19] brought him to sign and he's like well
[20:21] he said well let me get a hold of him
[20:23] have at
[20:25] him and he began to work on Joe but you
[20:27] know what the man that job was the
[20:31] Integrity that job
[20:32] had see God knew what kind of man job
[20:36] was amen and he came through
[20:39] that and so it's the same way with you
[20:42] and I God has ordained us to this
[20:46] day God God has brought us to this
[20:51] time see brother BR said when he was
[20:55] speaking there in in Christ the mystery
[20:57] and he was talking about you know God
[20:58] had a a plan and and a purpose something
[21:00] that he wanted to achieve he had this
[21:02] thought in his mind of what he was going
[21:03] to take place and he you know he laid it
[21:05] all out just perfect what was going to
[21:07] take place and you know he set
[21:08] everything in order he said in order for
[21:11] him to be expressed he wanted to express
[21:14] himself he wanted he wanted the world to
[21:17] see he wanted to have fellowship and you
[21:20] know all the things that he wanted to
[21:21] express he he wanted to be a
[21:23] savior he wanted to be a Healer he
[21:26] wanted to be a father all these things
[21:28] that he wanted to be see he was able to
[21:30] do all of those things and he set
[21:32] everything in
[21:34] motion and see it praise God that if God
[21:37] set everything in motion then there's a
[21:39] plan and a purpose for all of
[21:42] it and see we wake up this you know in
[21:44] the morning and you know oh what's going
[21:46] to take place and wor you know what
[21:48] God's not worried God's God's not
[21:52] frustrated amen you know because God
[21:55] know why because everything is working
[21:57] just just to God's
[22:00] plan and when you know that all all
[22:03] these things and and so when you see all
[22:05] that God had this whole plan of what was
[22:07] going to take place and everything's
[22:09] working just to that plan and then you
[22:11] know when we see how the the world has
[22:14] has come about and we know
[22:17] that Adam and Eve was going to
[22:21] fall God said everything up and all of a
[22:23] sudden here here they came and you know
[22:25] they disbelieve God's word
[22:29] but you know he already had a plan he
[22:31] already had an atonement before that
[22:32] ever happened the
[22:35] Lord and you know and and so because you
[22:37] know here he was in in the midst of all
[22:39] this and here here's Adam and Eve
[22:42] falling away and and all of a sudden
[22:44] here they are caught in caught in their
[22:46] in their sin and realizing you know
[22:48] their eyes are open and they realize
[22:50] they're naked and and all these things
[22:51] and all of a sudden you know they
[22:52] realize we're out of fellowship with God
[22:54] we're not where we are supposed to be
[22:56] we're not where we used to be and all
[22:58] this and then all of a sudden in the in
[22:59] the midst of all this here comes God
[23:01] walking in the midst of the garden
[23:03] calling Adam Where Art
[23:05] Thou see he began to call out to Adam
[23:09] because he knew that Adam was going to
[23:10] do that but he already had an atonement
[23:12] and he began to call out to Adam ask
[23:15] where are
[23:17] you he's over there in the bushes trying
[23:20] to make fig leaves trying to cover
[23:23] up amen and you know what none of that's
[23:26] going to work why because nothing that
[23:27] you do are is ever going to amount to
[23:30] anything it's not going it's not going
[23:31] to be able to cover you that's it but
[23:34] you know what God brought the covering
[23:36] to them when he brought the bloody lamb
[23:39] skins into them and had them put those
[23:41] on and covered them and he sent them out
[23:44] but he made a way and he made a promise
[23:46] of what was going to take place that he
[23:48] had that he had an way
[23:51] made see that he knew that they were
[23:53] going to have there would have to be one
[23:55] that had to come to cover that Chasm to
[23:57] bring them back into Fellowship but you
[23:58] know what he never forgot them and he
[24:00] already had the way
[24:02] made so here they are and all these type
[24:05] things when when God was coming through
[24:07] and seeing all these things
[24:09] see when you see this plan how God had
[24:13] everything in in divine order everything
[24:15] worked out just perfectly that that you
[24:17] know God never been was not caught by
[24:19] surprised by anything no that's right
[24:21] amen when he seen all these things take
[24:23] place but you know as he began to go
[24:26] through time and you know man got away
[24:29] from God and you know he he kept trying
[24:31] to reach out to man and have fellowship
[24:33] with him even when Adam and Eve were
[24:35] outside the garden but you know he still
[24:38] loved them and he still wanted to have
[24:39] fellowship with them and he began to
[24:41] deal with them amen and he began to deal
[24:44] with Cain and Abel you know because he
[24:47] he made a way for them and he began to
[24:49] speak to them and tell them listen
[24:51] there's a there's an attonement that
[24:53] needs to be made and he began to deal
[24:55] with Abel by revelation of what that
[24:57] needed to take place that he could come
[24:59] in to Divine fellowship with God that
[25:01] there was a there was something that had
[25:03] to be done and you know it said by
[25:04] Revelation Abel offered a more excellent
[25:07] sacrifice than Cain why because God
[25:09] began to deal with Abel on what had to
[25:12] be done there was a revelation that was
[25:14] given to him and as he began to deal
[25:16] with it then you know what he took a
[25:17] hold of God's word by what God had given
[25:19] him and he began to do that and he took
[25:21] and he realized that it took blood it
[25:23] wasn't it wasn't any fruit or anything
[25:25] that was going to take place but it had
[25:27] to have a spot
[25:28] perfect lamb that had to be sacrificed
[25:31] and he went out there and he found one
[25:33] and he and he went out there and just as
[25:35] sincere he built that Altar and he stood
[25:37] before God and he took that Lamb's s and
[25:40] he stood there and offed and worshiped
[25:42] God standing there realizing that lamb
[25:45] was taking his
[25:48] place he walked in exactly what God
[25:51] wanted him to
[25:53] do and as as he began to do that you
[25:56] know here Here Comes we know the story
[25:59] here come Cain standing there offering
[26:01] the best of the field you know all all
[26:03] that his hands had done and you know God
[26:05] didn't off didn't accept any of that
[26:07] because it didn't match didn't match the
[26:10] plan but you know he began to deal with
[26:12] Cain he began to speak to K listen none
[26:15] of this is going to
[26:18] work but he told him he said listen if
[26:20] you will do as your brother amen all you
[26:22] got to do is what your brother
[26:24] done your brother your brother has
[26:27] offered a lamb
[26:31] and he said if you'll just do the exact
[26:32] same
[26:33] thing he said you'll be accepted
[26:36] amen he said but if not send lies at the
[26:39] door just a s just a simple
[26:44] fact when it's when it's when it's so
[26:48] simple and it and it's laid out so
[26:51] perfectly before us just like it was to
[26:56] Cain and it's like well the question is
[26:59] is what are you going to do with
[27:03] it it's your
[27:06] choice and there he was well you know
[27:08] I'm not I'm not going to do
[27:10] that oh it's it's just too
[27:13] hard this not this this just hurts my
[27:19] feelings like
[27:21] well how wonderful it is that God speaks
[27:23] to us just like it done just like he
[27:26] done Cain
[27:29] answered answered his question exactly G
[27:32] him exactly what he had need of but you
[27:35] know the question is is was he going to
[27:37] follow what God wanted him to
[27:39] do and so you know when when he turned
[27:42] it down then you know he was rejected of
[27:45] God Amen but that was his choice not
[27:47] God's
[27:48] choice because God began to deal with
[27:51] him and plead with
[27:53] him and not only pasted him but all of
[27:56] men he began to deal with them but you
[28:00] know what they turned they turned God
[28:02] down it wasn't God turning them down
[28:04] amen that's
[28:06] right you know I was thinking of you
[28:10] know brother brandham always talking
[28:11] about uh you know people saying well
[28:13] brother brandham you know I don't agree
[28:15] with you on your Doctrine and I don't
[28:16] agree with this and you know we're just
[28:17] going to draw you outside of our
[28:20] Circle and he said that's all right I'll
[28:21] just draw you back
[28:23] in you know the thing is is just just
[28:26] like when God was there you know you
[28:28] deal with people and you try to show
[28:30] them the truth and you try to show them
[28:31] love but you know you can't force people
[28:33] into doing
[28:35] things you know because there comes a
[28:37] time you've got to make a choice for
[28:40] yourself you've got you've got to come
[28:43] beyond all all of your your hurt
[28:45] feelings and and different things in
[28:47] your life you've got to move beyond all
[28:49] of that and because people people will
[28:51] always find an excuse somehow that's
[28:54] going to hold you back right but you
[28:57] know God will always deal with you and
[29:00] you know many times in our lives we've
[29:02] had God deal with us and you know and
[29:04] and it's only well I'm just going to
[29:06] speak for myself tonight but it's by but
[29:08] it's just being
[29:10] stubborn because you know you you want
[29:12] to do it your own way and God begins to
[29:16] deal with you about things and you know
[29:18] what
[29:19] because maybe maybe y'all don't have
[29:21] that problem but y'all just pray for me
[29:23] but you know we but I you know you you
[29:25] realize God's dealing with you and he's
[29:26] trying to get you to go in a certain way
[29:28] and he keeps trying to show you but you
[29:29] know what you don't want to do it that
[29:31] way because we think oh I got it all
[29:33] under control I can do this I got
[29:37] it until it all falls apart till the
[29:41] wheels fall off and then was like oh
[29:42] Lord where you
[29:47] at see and it's like well you know what
[29:49] I was been here waiting on you try to
[29:50] tell you which way to
[29:52] go you don't want to
[29:55] listen that's but see God has a plan and
[29:58] a purpose for everything he had
[30:01] everything set out just perfect you know
[30:04] even from the beginning all things went
[30:06] work just the way he had a
[30:08] plan you know you even you see how how
[30:12] the Earth and and when he created the
[30:14] heavens and the stars and everything
[30:16] works just
[30:18] perfectly you know and then you know how
[30:21] we see you know you can measure U
[30:24] distance and and the years and the
[30:26] months and all these type things and
[30:28] they keep perfect
[30:29] timeing you know brother talking about
[30:31] you know we can't build a clock that
[30:33] holds time like the stars
[30:35] do you know they can see and and they
[30:38] can track you know a hundred years from
[30:40] now they'll know where all the planets
[30:42] are where the constellations are all
[30:44] these type things they know what's going
[30:45] to take place because they see because
[30:48] all of this was set in order and there's
[30:50] a there's a perfect plan to this well
[30:52] you see how all of this
[30:54] works that when you see how all of this
[30:57] works in a perfect in a perfect harmony
[31:00] well you know when you go back because
[31:03] because God's plan is so perfect that
[31:05] the way it works that you know when when
[31:07] they went back in time and they were
[31:09] trying to figure out why there was
[31:11] missing time why didn't their models
[31:13] work right and you know the NASA and the
[31:15] different ones like there's a there's
[31:17] problem here we can't figure this
[31:20] out well what what happened was like oh
[31:23] well you know what we just go right to
[31:24] the
[31:25] Bible what
[31:30] yeah yeah move the sun yeah man pray to
[31:33] have the Sun move back 10
[31:35] degrees Joshua prayed that the sun would
[31:37] stand
[31:39] still then all of a sudden well you know
[31:41] that's just a fairy
[31:42] tale there's no scientific proof to any
[31:46] of
[31:49] that because you know what it was just
[31:51] it was just a bunch of gases out
[31:53] somewhere and they just ignited and all
[31:56] this just come out just a big bang and
[31:58] it just kind of rolled around for for
[32:02] thousands millions of years all this
[32:04] stuff kind of just rolled around and
[32:06] burn up and we just seen all of this
[32:08] whoy going on and all of a sudden life
[32:11] came out of
[32:13] that then all then then you see all you
[32:16] know out of out of all this
[32:19] chaos all all of all this all this chaos
[32:22] all of a sudden order came amen praise
[32:25] the Lord as brother as brother erne used
[32:27] to to say all the time he said if you
[32:29] believe in a Big Bang Theory he said you
[32:31] believe that you can throw a a a bomb in
[32:33] a print shop and come out with a a
[32:42] dictionary but see the problem is is it
[32:44] was in divine order the problem is is we
[32:46] don't see the divine
[32:49] order until somebody begins to point out
[32:51] the divine order to show us the things
[32:54] that take
[32:56] place amen and it's like well all the
[32:59] all you know because they're out trying
[33:01] to find some way to
[33:04] prove their
[33:06] Theory and we can't we can't prove it
[33:08] because we don't we don't have any
[33:10] scientific proof but but you know what
[33:12] it it it's what we believe and so you
[33:15] know don't say anything against
[33:18] it because when as you begin to show the
[33:22] evidence and you begin to express all
[33:24] these things will you tell me how all
[33:26] these things work
[33:29] how is it how is it that what what came
[33:32] first the chicken or the
[33:34] egg but you got to have a chicken here
[33:36] before an egg
[33:40] come because you can't create an egg
[33:42] without the without the chicken there's
[33:45] no
[33:47] way but it wasn't
[33:51] created so how did how did all these
[33:54] things take
[33:56] place how is it how is it that well the
[33:58] scripture tells us you know the seas are
[34:00] all set in in order and everything's in
[34:02] a divine order and everything's set but
[34:04] you know you go into places in the world
[34:06] and you know what the oceans don't cross
[34:08] each
[34:10] other they don't
[34:12] mix the Pacific and the Atlantic don't
[34:15] mix there's a dividing
[34:17] line when when brother Brandon was
[34:20] talking about the the waters were
[34:22] created and he put He put a divine order
[34:25] there and then he would began to talk
[34:26] about to watch and and he said and
[34:29] instead of things flooding and and
[34:31] different things changing he said there
[34:33] was a watchdog put in the a guy he said
[34:36] it's called the
[34:38] moon and that moon was set in order and
[34:40] he said that controls the
[34:43] seas because the Seas can't but go
[34:46] certain places because it's a divine
[34:48] order amen and so when you see all these
[34:52] things you know it's just not just it
[34:55] just had ha you just happened just
[34:57] halfhazard
[34:59] but when you begin to you look at it say
[35:02] well how did all these things take
[35:05] place and you see all of these things
[35:08] how they work everything works in a in a
[35:11] in a perfect condition
[35:16] amen everything works just
[35:20] perfect and you know all things you you
[35:23] look at the composition of the Earth how
[35:25] much water how much land all of the
[35:27] minerals and everything is in the right
[35:30] proportion in the
[35:32] earth everything is made just exactly
[35:36] right right the Earth is the Earth is
[35:39] the right size it has the right
[35:42] Mass it has the right gravitational pull
[35:46] it's the correct distance from the
[35:51] sun when you see all these well you know
[35:54] what it just it just
[35:56] happened we you know if if you if you
[35:58] have that kind of Faith well just jump
[36:00] in your car crank it and expect to get
[36:02] in the
[36:05] house
[36:09] no because there there takes a divine
[36:13] order to
[36:14] that amen you know if you if you want to
[36:17] get home tonight you better have your
[36:19] hand on the wheel you better be having
[36:21] your eye on the
[36:23] road you better know what you're doing
[36:27] well see it's the same way with God God
[36:29] has a plan and a purpose he has
[36:31] everything in order and there's a law
[36:33] how everything
[36:35] works and so we don't have to worry
[36:37] about those things all we got to do is
[36:38] realize God's in
[36:40] control and if we can just trust God
[36:43] then he can move these things in the
[36:44] right in the right areas
[36:55] amen see when God began to speak about
[36:58] all these things
[36:59] and you know when he when he called man
[37:03] and man got out of position but you know
[37:06] he called uh men the prophets he called
[37:10] them to to bring the word because he
[37:13] wanted his word brought to the people
[37:15] and you know he began to call the
[37:17] prophets and he began to speak to them
[37:19] and he began to open them and you know
[37:22] because brother R said they had to be
[37:24] yielded to the spirit they had to be
[37:26] yielded and it was not what they were
[37:29] speak what their thoughts that they were
[37:31] speaking but they had to be yielded to
[37:33] the spirit for him to
[37:36] speak and as he began to speak and he he
[37:38] was speaking of Moses and different ones
[37:41] where where they began to speak the word
[37:44] and they began to speak the word because
[37:46] God wanted to deal with man he wanted to
[37:48] have fellowship and he reached out and
[37:50] he began to speak to these to these
[37:53] people you know and all of a sudden you
[37:55] know here here's these peculiar men that
[37:57] began to speak and and God began to open
[38:00] up the scripture and began to speak to
[38:01] them began to deal with them and show
[38:03] them the way that God had for them and
[38:05] the way that he wanted them to go and
[38:07] you know they didn't even understand
[38:09] sometimes what they were saying right it
[38:12] wasn't it wasn't their idea wasn't but
[38:15] God began to speak to them and he began
[38:16] to open the scripture to them and he
[38:18] began to speak to them and he began to
[38:20] show the people because he began to
[38:23] reveal himself through the through the
[38:25] prophets
[38:27] and you know because you know they
[38:29] didn't even have their own understanding
[38:31] of things of why but you know it's just
[38:33] like all they could do is just take God
[38:36] at his
[38:38] word who was it who was it Isaiah that
[38:41] you know he just he just went out there
[38:42] and walked around naked for three years
[38:44] or whatever it was you know and it's
[38:45] like why because you know what I'm
[38:48] showing y'all that this is the condition
[38:50] y'all living
[38:52] in and see this is this is what God sees
[38:54] before it
[38:59] you know he began to speak to them and
[39:01] and you know here they are and and even
[39:03] even when they didn't want to speak they
[39:05] couldn't hold
[39:07] back they couldn't hold back what they
[39:09] wanted to
[39:11] say as Jeremiah said you know he said
[39:13] it's like fire shut up in my
[39:16] bones and he said you know he was weary
[39:19] for forbearing you know he just trying
[39:21] to hold on but you know he had to get
[39:22] out and say this here brother said you
[39:25] know he said God God has spoke and he
[39:27] said and I must deliver it see he could
[39:30] he couldn't get away from that whether
[39:32] whether they liked it or not no matter
[39:34] what happened to them that's what God
[39:36] wanted them to do because he began to
[39:38] speak to
[39:43] them he said God God has spoke in my in
[39:47] his heart and he must he must say it he
[39:50] said not to be different but to be
[39:52] obedient right so he had to he had to go
[39:55] and speak all these things and say
[39:57] everything in order what God wanted them
[39:59] to know because there was there was he
[40:01] began to reveal himself and he wanted
[40:03] them to know who he was and and what he
[40:05] wanted them to do but you know as as he
[40:08] began to reach out there was a lot that
[40:10] turned him down oh yeah and you know
[40:13] even when it came to the time of Moses
[40:15] when he began to deal with and see the
[40:17] sin that was in the earth and you know
[40:19] he told him but he made a
[40:22] way but when he sent Noah into the Earth
[40:25] and told him said listen there's a flood
[40:26] coming there's judgment coming and you
[40:29] can make your way out right but there's
[40:32] a way that you got to
[40:35] follow when he preached when he preached
[40:37] to his generation that 120 years out
[40:39] there building an ark and and preaching
[40:42] to them listen God's judgment's coming
[40:45] and there's a there's a plan and there's
[40:46] a way out but you've got to get
[40:49] ready you've got to prepare
[40:51] yourself and he began to preach to them
[40:53] this whole time and he began to build
[40:55] this Ark and he said the whole time he
[40:57] was stand out there and they could prove
[40:59] that there was no water in the
[41:03] sky well there ain't no there ain't no
[41:05] water up there we we got this crazy man
[41:07] out
[41:09] here but God had it all set in
[41:13] order and he began to build all
[41:17] this well there might be something to it
[41:19] but I would I wouldn't get too close to
[41:20] any of
[41:22] that but all of a sudden next thing you
[41:25] know when he spent all those
[41:27] years out there building that Ark
[41:31] getting
[41:32] ready so well we ain't we ain't seen
[41:35] nothing but didn't build that Ark and he
[41:36] keep saying the same thing all these
[41:39] years but it didn't take long all of a
[41:42] sudden something Supernatural
[41:44] happened all of a sudden them animals
[41:46] started you know what he didn't have to
[41:48] go out there and he wasn't wrangling the
[41:51] animals and trying to hurt them onto the
[41:54] ark
[41:57] you know he wasn't out trapping animals
[42:00] trying to get them on on the
[42:03] ark but you know what because the
[42:06] animals were smarter than the people in
[42:08] that
[42:10] day because the because the same spirit
[42:13] that spoke to those people in that day
[42:15] are the same ones that led those animals
[42:18] onto the ark right and here they are
[42:21] coming two by two or coming in groups of
[42:24] seven and came onto the ark
[42:29] and when all of that was finished after
[42:31] they saw all
[42:34] that so like well you know all the all
[42:37] the news stations are out there we got
[42:39] to watch this phenomenon look at this
[42:41] all these animals are
[42:43] coming and they all just stand around
[42:45] watching well I wonder what's going to
[42:47] happen
[42:49] next but nobody took it seriously right
[42:52] nobody believed
[42:54] it what they didn't realize that God
[42:57] shut the door and had sealed it amen and
[43:02] he sealed their
[43:04] judgment but that was their choice
[43:08] amen God had already made a way for them
[43:11] and they turned it down that was their
[43:13] choice yes
[43:15] amen and all of a
[43:17] sudden after well it's been one day two
[43:20] days three days y'all see anything
[43:22] different nope have youall heard from
[43:24] Noah nope
[43:28] do you know what after that week went
[43:31] past they started having this
[43:33] phenomenon all of a sudden it's
[43:37] like what is all
[43:42] this oh guess
[43:45] what Noah's prophecy come to a pass
[43:48] Noah's word is coming to
[43:50] pass then all of a sudden when the rains
[43:53] came down so hard you couldn't see
[43:55] anything everything began to get washed
[43:57] way there was no place to
[44:00] hide then all of a sudden it's like hey
[44:02] can we get in the ark
[44:04] Noah
[44:07] nope amen your judgment's already upon
[44:10] you y right and you don't realize it
[44:14] amen and all of a sudden I didn't close
[44:18] the door God
[44:20] did God closed the door but you had your
[44:23] opportunity and you let it pass by
[44:26] that's right see that's what we've got
[44:29] to do we've got to take the word when
[44:30] the word is presented to us we've got to
[44:32] grab a hold of it and walk in the
[44:35] word that he's given us and realize this
[44:38] is life and
[44:40] death you know we're not pro nobody's
[44:42] promised tomorrow nobody knows what's
[44:44] going to take place but you know now is
[44:46] the day of today is the day of salvation
[44:48] today is the day if you're going to
[44:50] listen to God if you're going to get a
[44:51] hold of God get right with God whatever
[44:53] you need is today's the day to do it
[44:56] because we don't know none of us have
[44:58] our promise tomorrow
[45:01] right see brother brandom said when he
[45:03] began to speak about this word and these
[45:06] prophets began and speak the
[45:08] word and here they began to walk in that
[45:11] and they began to speak the word and
[45:12] they and it said the word he said God
[45:14] had so much control of them he said that
[45:16] their voice and their and their actions
[45:20] he controlled everything he began to
[45:22] speak to them and then he said he said
[45:25] give me a church that's so complete
[45:27] Anointed with god Till every action and
[45:29] move is thus sayith the Lord he said
[45:31] walk in that shakina of Glory I'll show
[45:33] you a messiah he said anointed one
[45:36] standing upon the Earth see if we walk
[45:40] in the word that God has given to us see
[45:42] now's the time to do that God has called
[45:44] and now's the time to do that amen oh
[45:48] you know we you know because the the
[45:50] world is full of of of
[45:53] Deceit amen see God said everything in
[45:56] this perfect order and everything works
[45:58] just so so perfect but you know what now
[46:01] in this time when when God sent the word
[46:04] and he's and he's Vindicated the word
[46:06] but you know what Satan had a plan
[46:10] also Satan was always trying to work
[46:12] against God's
[46:14] plan always from the beginning amen
[46:18] surely you'll not
[46:20] die well we don't have to listen to that
[46:23] we've got our own way God's not God's
[46:25] not surely God wouldn't do that God's a
[46:27] good God that won't
[46:30] happen but you know what it came just
[46:32] like he said it would it did
[46:34] amen you see he allowed Satan to have
[46:37] his his time to work things the way he
[46:40] wanted and so it's just like that
[46:42] tonight you know God allowed Satan to
[46:44] work his plan and he began to work and
[46:47] we see it all the way down through
[46:49] history we see how everything took
[46:51] place and everybody's like well you know
[46:54] why why did God allow this to happen and
[46:56] why did God allow that to happen why
[46:58] because there's a divine order to it
[47:00] all you know you know you see how God
[47:03] began to deal with all of them and and
[47:05] began to allow began to speak to all
[47:08] these people all the way down began to
[47:10] speak all of the prophets began to speak
[47:12] to them and he began to show them things
[47:15] and and express himself and he began to
[47:18] show himself in Miracles and and the
[47:20] supernatural things that that took place
[47:22] but you know people didn't understand
[47:24] those things people didn't believe it
[47:28] but you know when all of that word was
[47:29] preached there came one that came upon
[47:31] the Earth yeah that it was stepped into
[47:34] the Fulfillment of all of that we know
[47:37] Jesus Christ stepped into the
[47:38] Fulfillment of all the word that was
[47:40] preached he was the Fulfillment of that
[47:42] he came and he began to preach to the
[47:44] people of what what took place and he
[47:47] began to tell people listen I am the
[47:49] Fulfillment of that of the word that's
[47:52] been preached and he said now is the
[47:54] time that the lamb must be slain
[47:57] he said that's what I come into the
[47:58] Earth to do to bridge that
[48:02] Chasm that's from the
[48:04] beginning I am one just like Moses said
[48:07] God would raise up a prophet like an
[48:09] unto me and here he came and he stepped
[48:12] out he began to preach the
[48:14] word in a in a time when the people
[48:16] ought have known the
[48:18] word great religious leaders they should
[48:20] have known the word and here Jesus began
[48:22] to preach to them and show them the word
[48:24] and they didn't even understand and
[48:25] didn't even see him no and they rejected
[48:29] him and here he was he began to see
[48:32] these things and began to show them but
[48:34] he came to the ones that he was supposed
[48:37] to come
[48:39] to he said he came to his own and his
[48:41] own received him
[48:43] not but there was a group that received
[48:46] that word
[48:48] amen and see he came on into the Earth
[48:51] to fulfill the word and and all of the
[48:54] scriptures him standing there and
[48:57] showing hey nobody takes my life from me
[49:02] I lay it
[49:04] down why because that's the father's
[49:06] will amen and you know I come to do
[49:11] this and he's like listen he said when
[49:13] when I go away he said there a comforter
[49:16] must come he said I got to go away for
[49:18] the comforter to
[49:19] come he said I'm not going to leave you
[49:22] comfortless thank you Lord and all that
[49:24] they had went through and all the things
[49:26] that they had
[49:28] seen and he began to speak to the
[49:30] disciples and tell them
[49:32] listen you're going to be hated in the
[49:35] earth you're going to be
[49:37] persecuted all the things the way they
[49:39] treated me they'll treat you but he said
[49:42] I want you know he said I'll never leave
[49:44] you he said I'll never forsake you he
[49:47] said I'll be with you even in you to the
[49:50] end of the Earth all the things that he
[49:53] done all the way through he led them all
[49:55] the way yes amen right and told him
[49:58] listen I got to go I got to go to
[50:00] Calvary by
[50:02] myself the scripture says that I'll be
[50:07] forsaken even when Peter's like well
[50:09] Lord I'm not going to allow that
[50:14] happen but it did you know why because
[50:17] the scripture says that when we make
[50:21] plans the will of God's what's going to
[50:23] be
[50:24] done and that's what took place
[50:28] but you know he told he told Peter he
[50:30] said after after the resurrection he
[50:31] said listen I've prayed for
[50:34] you he said when you're converted
[50:37] strengthen the
[50:39] Brethren you've got a testimony Peter
[50:42] you've come through some
[50:44] things you want to know what a failure
[50:46] looks
[50:48] like as
[50:50] Peter but Peter the Holy Ghost is going
[50:53] to come upon
[50:54] you and you're going you're going to
[50:56] show show them what God can do to a
[50:59] failure
[51:00] amen when God can get a hold of somebody
[51:03] that's absolutely just fell
[51:09] apart like you know all the things that
[51:12] you've
[51:15] done you
[51:17] know cutting off somebody's ear getting
[51:19] mad all the different
[51:22] things but you know what God gave him a
[51:25] testimony and brought him through show
[51:27] him what Grace
[51:29] was and he began to speak of those
[51:32] things to know what God's done that we
[51:36] can go out there and tell you
[51:38] listen this same Lord
[51:41] Jesus is here yes to be with to meet
[51:46] your
[51:47] need if you want if you want a
[51:49] lifechanging experience here's one that
[51:51] can give you a life-changing experience
[51:54] am all the things that the scripture Tau
[51:56] Al about this Jesus whom you you
[52:01] crucified he's the Fulfillment of all
[52:05] that and he had such a testimony in the
[52:07] end they were
[52:09] like men and Brethren what shall we
[52:12] do hey they were so moved by that well R
[52:16] I'll give you the prescription repent
[52:18] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[52:20] Christ for the remission of your sins
[52:23] and you shall receive the gift of the
[52:24] Holy Ghost hey he said This Promise is
[52:27] unto you and to your children and to
[52:29] them that's a far off even as many as
[52:31] the Lord Our God shall
[52:33] call see all of those things as he began
[52:36] to come through and began to
[52:39] preach God was making himself known to
[52:41] him
[52:44] am 120 in in one
[52:47] day see all those all the way through
[52:50] begin to
[52:52] speak you know and then you you look at
[52:54] all through the scripture and people I
[52:55] don't understand
[52:57] why why all these things happen all
[52:58] these bad things happen it's the divine
[53:01] order of God Amen there's a plan and a
[53:03] purpose to all of it you know it's like
[53:05] when they when they said well how is it
[53:07] that God can sit there with his hands C
[53:09] folded across his stomach and watch all
[53:11] those babies get murdered and all those
[53:14] women during the Dark Ages they said
[53:17] well if the if the sea didn't go on the
[53:18] ground it couldn't come
[53:21] back he said if a seed
[53:24] must abide alone and die and wrought for
[53:29] it to come to life amen there was a
[53:31] Divine Purpose in all that
[53:34] amen I don't I don't understand
[53:37] that well you know what in the Scripture
[53:40] it tells us when that that the red horse
[53:42] rider went out and he said he was given
[53:44] a sword and it said and it said he he
[53:47] went to take peace from the
[53:49] earth so he began to take because he he
[53:52] was there to take all this but you know
[53:54] what God had a plan
[53:57] it was a divine order that was there
[53:59] Amen in the midst of all that because
[54:01] those people had the O anointing they
[54:05] were anointed why because they were
[54:09] sacrifice and you know I I I've always
[54:11] said you know it's when somebody wants
[54:13] to take something from you because they
[54:15] think that you're going to hold on to
[54:17] something that they they feel like I've
[54:18] got this power I'm gonna take this from
[54:21] you well you know how you take the power
[54:23] away from somebody is you give it to
[54:26] them
[54:28] when they want to take something well
[54:30] here I'm freely give it to
[54:34] you then all of a sudden they've lost
[54:36] the
[54:37] power because you give it to
[54:40] them so when when they out there well
[54:43] we're going to take our we're going to
[54:44] take your life we're going you know what
[54:45] they had a better Resurrection
[54:48] coming they had a they had a better
[54:50] testimony ahead of
[54:52] them why because you know what you know
[54:55] we're going we're going to suffer for a
[54:56] while we're going to go through all
[54:57] these heartaches and and all of this
[55:00] pain and all these things that are
[55:01] taking place but you know what we've got
[55:03] a better waiting you know here in just a
[55:05] few minutes we're going to be on the
[55:07] other
[55:09] side we just we just got to battle this
[55:11] for just a short period of time and all
[55:13] of a sudden you know what we're going to
[55:14] be in the presence of the
[55:15] Lord you know I got I got nothing to
[55:18] worry about if they if they kill me
[55:21] that's all right if they torture me
[55:22] that's all
[55:24] right because you know what I'm going
[55:26] into the Arms of
[55:28] Jesus and you know here they I walk
[55:30] right into this and I I'm going to the
[55:32] other side they were anointed for that
[55:36] amen and praise God you know it's like
[55:39] well I can't I can't understand that
[55:40] well that was that was the anointing for
[55:43] their day that's what they were called
[55:45] to do that's right amen and everybody
[55:48] had had to go through those different
[55:49] times everything was
[55:52] called every situation was made for and
[55:56] every time all the way down through
[55:59] history everything was made perfect for
[56:01] that
[56:02] time every
[56:05] every every time Satan came and tried to
[56:08] do something the spirit of the Lord
[56:09] raised up a standard and whatever that
[56:11] standard was it was perfect for that
[56:14] time it met it met the conditions for
[56:17] the day whatever whatever came about it
[56:19] worked out just exactly the way God
[56:21] wanted it to be it was just perfect
[56:24] everything went through and so there was
[56:25] no there was nothing that was out of
[56:27] cater there was nothing that that was
[56:30] out of place there was there was no
[56:32] problems in any of
[56:35] this it worked out just
[56:39] perfect and you know when when we see
[56:42] that God began to
[56:44] speak and in in the beginning when he
[56:47] began to
[56:50] speak and he began to say Let There be
[56:53] let there be and everything came into
[56:56] the divine
[56:57] order and he and he stood there and he
[56:59] said let us make man in our own image
[57:02] and everything got and he and when he
[57:04] saw all of creation when he saw
[57:06] everything that he had done he said it's
[57:10] good and the scripture said that he
[57:14] rested amen he came and he
[57:19] rested why because everything was set in
[57:22] divine order
[57:27] brothers and sisters I want you to know
[57:28] one thing
[57:30] tonight see God come to the
[57:33] place that when everything come in
[57:35] divine
[57:36] order that he
[57:39] rested then you know what God's not
[57:41] worried about what's going to take
[57:44] place why because it's all in divine
[57:48] order well let me tell you something
[57:50] when you come into Christ and he said he
[57:54] said when when you come into Christ he
[57:56] said he said we're we're not we are now
[57:59] New Creations we are new creatures in
[58:02] Christ Jesus the old things have passed
[58:05] away and all things have become new am
[58:08] so the old things have passed away so
[58:11] when you come into Christ then you under
[58:13] that because the promise is when you
[58:16] come into Christ you enter into that
[58:18] rest well then you know what if God came
[58:21] into that and he had a plan and a
[58:22] purpose everything was in divine order
[58:24] and when it came in and then he sat down
[58:27] and he rested because everything was
[58:28] working just the way God wanted it to
[58:31] well then let me tell you something
[58:32] brother sisters if we step into that
[58:34] same place where we're we step in divine
[58:36] order the same way when you come into
[58:38] Christ you're in divine order and you
[58:40] know what doesn't matter if every devil
[58:43] in hell comes against you when
[58:44] everything falls apart when there's
[58:46] nothing there and it all blows up and
[58:48] there's nothing there and you don't know
[58:50] where you're standing you don't know
[58:51] what's going on there's a place to stand
[58:54] why because no matter what comes your
[58:55] way we are blessed in the Beloved we're
[58:58] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[59:00] Jesus and it doesn't matter what comes
[59:02] or goes you know what everything is in
[59:05] divine
[59:07] order all you got to do is put your
[59:09] trust in him and walk in the way he lead
[59:12] you if if you would just put your
[59:14] confidence in the word of God and say
[59:16] you know what I don't have to worry
[59:18] about anything why because God is in
[59:20] control God leads us and you know
[59:23] everything is made if God brought me if
[59:26] God Justified me if God Sanctified me if
[59:28] God filled me with the Holy Ghost and
[59:30] brought me and put me on the road that
[59:32] I'm supposed to be walking if I would
[59:34] just continue to follow the same spirit
[59:36] that turned me out or brought me out of
[59:38] the world of sin and brought me out of
