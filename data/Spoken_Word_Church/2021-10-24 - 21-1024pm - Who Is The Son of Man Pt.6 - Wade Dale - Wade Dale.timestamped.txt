[27:20] you you're the one that'll bring the
[27:22] next one in father you brought brother
[27:23] royale in i believe you'll bring another
[27:25] one in right behind him lord

[27:28] group of people lord because the sheep
[27:30] are there lord they're looking to you
[27:31] lord
[27:32] i pray that you just bless each one in
[27:34] jesus name
[27:35] amen
[27:37] yeah it's been really on our heart
[27:38] they're trying to they're searching for
[27:39] a new pastor over there at the
[27:41] in the philippines from brother royal's
[27:43] church so just keep them in your prayers
[27:46] they got a big church
[27:48] in the beginning was the word the word
[27:50] was with god and the word was god the
[27:52] same was in the beginning with god
[27:54] all things were made by him and without
[27:56] him was not anything made that was made
[27:58] in him was life and the life was the
[28:00] light of men and the light shineth in
[28:03] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[28:04] it not
[28:05] that was a man sent from god whose name
[28:07] was john the same came for a witness to
[28:10] bear witness of the light now remember
[28:12] john
[28:13] was to introduce the messiah
[28:16] all right
[28:18] john was to introduce god in human flesh
[28:22] no man had ever done that before
[28:24] he was the hinge point between the old
[28:26] testament and the new testament he was
[28:29] still in the old testament under the law
[28:34] because the new testament was after
[28:35] christ died
[28:37] and john died before he did all right
[28:39] but he was a prophet though he was that
[28:41] hinge between he stood between the old
[28:43] testament and the new testament to do as
[28:45] malachi said to turn the hearts of the
[28:48] children or to the fathers to the
[28:50] children all right so he's going to take
[28:52] those old testament fathers and turn
[28:54] them to the children of the new
[28:55] testament age right
[28:57] he
[28:58] he preached for six months
[29:02] no recording of any miracle
[29:04] the only thing he done was made people
[29:05] mad
[29:07] it was recorded
[29:09] and that's what got him killed
[29:11] because he started preaching marriage in
[29:12] divorce
[29:15] really yeah that's what he said they
[29:18] said he's he told herodia he told the
[29:21] uh whatever the guy's name was he said
[29:23] you can't marry her that's your
[29:25] brother's wife he's still alive
[29:27] well they just whacked his head off and
[29:29] shut him up they didn't shut him up
[29:30] though
[29:32] he did his job
[29:33] he did what he was supposed to do so
[29:35] there was a man sent from god whose name
[29:37] was john but now watch
[29:39] you take that parallel that was john of
[29:41] malachi 4 of the first part
[29:44] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[29:45] children then somebody's supposed to
[29:46] turn the hearts of the children
[29:49] back to the fathers
[29:51] another elijah
[29:53] a john the baptist that introduced the
[29:55] messiah at the end of the old testament
[30:00] is this familiar
[30:02] then we've got another
[30:04] elijah
[30:05] at the end of the new testament
[30:08] that's going to introduce christ
[30:10] amen
[30:12] that we've seen
[30:14] with our own eyes and heard with our own
[30:17] ears because some of these you know you
[30:18] read the scriptures that we've seen with
[30:20] our eyes we've heard peter and all the
[30:21] different ones
[30:23] what a wonderful time i'm telling you if
[30:25] it doesn't really strike to your heart
[30:27] what god did for us in this end time
[30:30] and all the others can say the same
[30:31] thing when they were alive brother john
[30:33] but they're not alive now
[30:35] we're alive we're to carry this thing on
[30:37] to the coming of the lord amen
[30:40] there was a man sent from god whose name
[30:42] was john the same came for a witness to
[30:44] bear witness of the light that all men
[30:46] through him might believe he was not
[30:48] that light but was sent to bear witness
[30:50] of that light
[30:51] that was the true light which lighteth
[30:53] every man that cometh into the world
[30:55] he was in the world the world was made
[30:57] by him
[30:58] and the world knew him not
[31:00] he came unto his own and his own
[31:02] received him not but as many as received
[31:05] him that's me and you
[31:07] but as many as received him
[31:10] to them gave he power to become the sons
[31:12] of god
[31:15] not the son of charles and elle branham
[31:17] not the son of samuel peggy dale the son
[31:19] of god
[31:20] to be sons of god even to them that
[31:22] believe on his name and why do they try
[31:24] to take his name out well that's what
[31:25] satan wants to do he wants to try to
[31:26] take the name out
[31:28] because if you don't have a name you
[31:29] don't have a family
[31:31] i've never seen a family on earth
[31:35] that didn't have a name
[31:37] i would
[31:38] it wouldn't exist
[31:40] what's your name
[31:42] no there's a name behind everything
[31:44] every time there's a baby dropped on the
[31:46] earth there's a name behind it amen and
[31:48] there's a progeny or there's a
[31:50] generation behind all that
[31:52] which were born not of
[31:54] blood nor of the will of the flesh nor
[31:56] the will of man but of god
[31:58] and the word was made flesh
[32:01] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[32:03] glory as the
[32:04] as of the only begotten of the father
[32:07] full
[32:08] of grace and truth you may be seated in
[32:09] the lord as blessing to the reading of
[32:11] the word
[32:13] then this is where we're going to try to
[32:15] to get to part of it
[32:17] today let's read hebrews 10
[32:20] verse 1. i preached on this some
[32:23] how long ago donnie 15 years ago or so
[32:26] my body that has prepared me and he
[32:28] keeps reminding me about it about every
[32:30] couple of months
[32:32] so must have must have stirred his
[32:35] stirred his uh soul i guess huh
[32:39] but that's what happened
[32:41] he prepared a body for for himself to
[32:43] dwell in and he's preparing a body now
[32:46] for himself to dwell in amen hebrews 10
[32:49] verse 1. now watch
[32:51] we're going to come back and look at the
[32:52] old testament just for a minute
[32:54] but hebrews 10 verse 1 says look for the
[32:56] law
[32:58] now remember the law
[33:01] came with moses
[33:03] through the prophets
[33:05] even jesus came under the law
[33:07] amen
[33:08] jesus christ came under the law that he
[33:11] might get us out from under all that
[33:14] by being by being the savior to save us
[33:17] that's what savior means is to save us
[33:19] all right
[33:20] so now look what it says here look for
[33:22] the law having a shadow of good things
[33:24] to come and not the very image of the
[33:27] thing you see that genesis 1 26 man was
[33:31] not the was not see we were made in his
[33:33] image okay
[33:35] but we were made we were created
[33:38] there was an image that god saw of me
[33:40] and you that couldn't come in the old
[33:43] testament
[33:44] none of that genesis 1 26 man could be
[33:48] brought forth
[33:49] through the womb of a woman
[33:52] by sex
[33:54] nobody got that
[33:55] that's your genesis 1 26 man not by sex
[33:58] not by blood what it says right here
[34:00] born not of blood nor the will of the
[34:01] flesh don't move it nor of the will of
[34:04] man but of god that's that genesis 1 26
[34:06] man
[34:07] genesis 1 26-27 man never had a
[34:10] beginning never had an end never had a
[34:11] mama never had a daddy
[34:14] god
[34:15] that is a part of god
[34:17] that's god made manifest in another form
[34:19] called his body or called his bride
[34:22] everybody got that amen we've been
[34:24] through this 100 times you ought to know
[34:26] that about genesis 1 26 that's the bride
[34:28] of jesus christ and no one else
[34:31] that's not even moses that's not even
[34:33] daniel that's not even john the baptist
[34:38] the least in the kingdom is greater than
[34:40] john
[34:41] the least in the kingdom what is the
[34:43] kingdom genesis 1 26 that's the kingdom
[34:45] of god that's god made manifest in
[34:47] another form not a second person
[34:50] for the law having a shadow of good
[34:52] things to come
[34:53] and not the very image of the thing so
[34:55] see whatever it was in the old testament
[34:57] you've heard brother brown talk about it
[34:59] you've heard many preachers talk about
[35:00] it it's types and shadows
[35:03] because see we don't have to
[35:06] come to church today and drag a a lamb
[35:09] or a turtle dove or a or a pigeon or or
[35:13] keep one up 14 days you understand what
[35:15] i'm saying
[35:16] but they did
[35:18] but that's all they could do
[35:20] because they couldn't develop that
[35:21] genesis 1 26 man there was no one to do
[35:24] it god had to come himself by isaiah 9 6
[35:28] behold a virgin shall conceive
[35:32] so we had to wait until then to get here
[35:36] but there but that didn't negate the old
[35:38] testament say well the old testament's
[35:39] not even good no that's all your types
[35:41] and shadows everything they did was a
[35:44] type in the shadow and when jesus stood
[35:46] out and and stood
[35:48] from the baby to we'll get to it a
[35:50] little bit later when he stood that's
[35:51] who it was who all those symbols were
[35:53] talking about
[35:55] pots pans candlesticks remember the
[35:58] candlesticks not was in the second court
[36:01] well what happened in revelations one
[36:03] there was the son of man standing in the
[36:05] middle of seven golden candlesticks
[36:08] all those symbols were for one purpose
[36:11] and that's to show jesus christ
[36:14] but when he came and those old testament
[36:17] prophets the religious people of the
[36:19] world
[36:20] that knew the bible by
[36:23] cover to cover
[36:25] he came exactly the way they said he was
[36:27] supposed to come
[36:29] and they didn't believe who he was
[36:31] amen
[36:33] that's why i say all these people that
[36:34] believe brother brown's got to come back
[36:35] i don't see it myself it's not in the
[36:37] scripture nowhere
[36:39] but it's it's just the words of somebody
[36:41] talking
[36:42] but and that don't mean nothing to me
[36:44] but if he did come back
[36:46] if he didn't come back the way you
[36:48] wanted him to come back you'd be the
[36:49] same way
[36:54] you'd be the same way you wouldn't know
[36:55] who he was
[36:58] you wouldn't know he'd step and he'd
[36:59] step right there and say look jesus said
[37:01] i am he
[37:02] i'm the one
[37:04] and they called him bill's above the
[37:05] same thing with brother brown i mean do
[37:06] the same thing to him because you know
[37:08] what he didn't come the way they wanted
[37:10] him to come
[37:12] he didn't say the words you wanted him
[37:14] to say
[37:15] he didn't put up the tent in your yard
[37:19] whatever but anyway
[37:21] i'm looking for jesus christ to come
[37:23] back that's all i'm worried about
[37:26] jesus saved my soul jesus is going to
[37:28] raise me jesus is going to sanctify me
[37:30] jesus is going to take me in the
[37:31] resurrection i ain't worried about
[37:33] nobody else
[37:35] now we're not going to get there without
[37:36] the words of that prophet though you
[37:39] will never
[37:40] take a body change without the words of
[37:42] that prophet
[37:43] all right amen for the law having a
[37:45] shadow of good things to come and not
[37:47] the very image of the things can never
[37:49] look with those sacrifices which they
[37:50] offered year by year continually they
[37:53] were doing sacrifices every day
[37:56] pretty much
[37:58] for this or that or the other
[38:01] they had all kind of offerings that you
[38:02] that were made but they continually made
[38:04] them but they had to continually make
[38:06] them
[38:08] continually make the comers there in two
[38:11] parts what the ones that came up
[38:14] to the altar
[38:16] burning fire brought a substitute flesh
[38:20] a lamb
[38:22] a natural lamb killed the lamb put it on
[38:25] the fire did whatever ritual they needed
[38:27] to do and i i say ritual it wasn't it
[38:29] was
[38:30] hey listen
[38:31] it forgave them of their sins
[38:34] but it became a ritual
[38:37] oh really whatever just the lamb is at
[38:39] this time of the year yeah go buy me one
[38:40] that's what happened in the temple
[38:42] remember they were selling lambs they
[38:44] were selling turtledoves they were
[38:45] selling this stuff so you didn't have to
[38:47] do it kind of like a drive-through
[38:48] service we have now we get all this
[38:50] convenience
[38:51] so they were just going to well just
[38:52] walk in pay 15 or 10 and here's your
[38:55] lamb we'll throw it on the altar for you
[38:57] well that's why it made jesus mad
[38:59] because there was no effort involved
[39:01] the effort was you put the lamb up the
[39:04] effort was you looked that lamb in the
[39:06] eye
[39:07] the effort was you knew that lamb was
[39:10] gonna die
[39:11] and you knew that lamb if it didn't die
[39:14] your sins were going to just keep
[39:16] heaping on you and heaping on you and
[39:17] heaping on you so it wasn't a ritual
[39:19] until later on but it became one because
[39:21] jesus told or god told them said it's
[39:23] become a stench in my nostrils
[39:27] but with those sacrifices which they
[39:29] offered year by year continually make
[39:31] the comers there and two perfect
[39:33] so therefore we understand that there
[39:35] was no new birth
[39:37] in the old testament
[39:40] because it would have made them perfect
[39:42] if they had been born again now there's
[39:43] people in the message that believe that
[39:45] i just can't see it because the bible
[39:46] says they can't be perfect
[39:48] not by sacrifice not by an animal
[39:51] sacrifice
[39:52] listen because we're going to read in
[39:54] just a minute as isaiah 53 we've got to
[39:56] pull jesus apart for a little while
[40:01] because he didn't give his body a ransom
[40:03] for your sin
[40:06] he gave his soul
[40:08] a ransom for your sin big difference
[40:12] because that was the soul of god the
[40:14] body was the body of jesus we know that
[40:15] was the body of god but
[40:18] they've got to go to go the funeral
[40:19] y'all y'all be safe brother joe's going
[40:22] with them but they'll be back
[40:25] man what about they were having a
[40:26] reunion and one of their people died so
[40:28] let's
[40:29] just pray for the family amen
[40:32] so for then who then for then would they
[40:35] not have ceased to be offered in other
[40:37] words if it would when jesus died there
[40:40] could there had to be no more you didn't
[40:41] have to offer anything he offered once
[40:43] for all and that was it but before that
[40:45] they had to offer every year there was
[40:47] an ignorance offering there was of this
[40:48] offering there was a list you know when
[40:50] jesus even when jesus was born they were
[40:52] so poor that they if you were so poor
[40:54] you couldn't bring a lamb you get two
[40:56] turtle doves
[40:57] or two pigeons
[41:00] and you take that and what would you do
[41:01] he would ring the neck off of one put
[41:04] the blood on the other listen i'm
[41:05] telling y'all
[41:07] when you look at all the sacrifices do
[41:09] you know that in solomon's when they
[41:11] dedicated that temple
[41:14] the bible says they could not number the
[41:16] sacrifices that were made
[41:19] now you're talking about a bloody mess
[41:22] i know some of your deer hunters and
[41:23] some of you slaughtered pigs and slaw
[41:25] could you imagine slaughtering one but
[41:27] could you
[41:28] imagine in one place
[41:30] slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
[41:32] animals
[41:34] but see that's what god required
[41:36] in the old testament he required that
[41:38] they did that
[41:40] but when he hung on that cross it only
[41:42] required one person
[41:44] because he had a soul
[41:46] that could come back into the believer
[41:48] he had a soul that he could impart
[41:50] eternal life to me and you and you
[41:51] didn't have to do that over and over
[41:53] again but that animal soul it just went
[41:55] away
[41:57] or the animal spirit it didn't have a
[41:58] soul but that animal part of him that
[42:01] just went away it didn't come back and
[42:03] made the guy better
[42:05] no
[42:06] he put the sacrifice on there if he was
[42:08] a liar he was still a liar it just
[42:10] covered his line for a year
[42:12] he just went back and lied some more
[42:14] amen but once we come to the supreme
[42:16] sacrifice
[42:18] if we were a liar we're not supposed to
[42:19] be a liar no more
[42:21] amen because that life can come inside
[42:24] me and clean me up
[42:25] amen
[42:27] just get back to some simple salvation
[42:29] but guess what
[42:30] we just might need it
[42:32] amen
[42:34] for then would they not have ceased to
[42:36] be offered because that the worshiper
[42:39] once purged
[42:41] once pers
[42:43] what purging means if any of you ever
[42:45] uh eat crawfish
[42:47] there's a purging you have to put them
[42:48] in water and they purge because they
[42:50] have uh
[42:51] mud in their guts but that's the same
[42:53] thing with me and you you got mud in
[42:54] your guts
[42:55] you old
[42:56] crawfish amen
[43:00] because the worshiper once purged
[43:04] should have no more conscious of sins
[43:07] wow
[43:09] take that one home
[43:12] i think what he's saying is we're not
[43:13] supposed to have a conscience of sin if
[43:14] we're born again by the baptism of the
[43:16] holy ghost
[43:17] hello
[43:18] but in those sacrifices there is a
[43:20] remembrance again made of sins every
[43:24] year year over and over again
[43:28] for it is not possible
[43:30] that the blood of bulls and of goats
[43:33] should take away sins that's why there's
[43:35] no new birth in the old testament or it
[43:37] would have took their sins away
[43:40] but they were under a brother brown said
[43:42] a substitutionary
[43:44] or a substitute blood or a capo or
[43:47] covering to keep god from killing them
[43:49] he could see
[43:50] he could see the blood and not see them
[43:54] you know that still happens
[43:56] right
[43:57] remember brother branham when he had the
[43:58] vision
[44:00] god you know god took him behind the
[44:01] door when he was condemning that old
[44:03] woman
[44:06] he said there's a there's a red rim of
[44:07] blood around the earth
[44:09] he said it keeps me and you from being
[44:11] killed
[44:12] because even being a human being if we
[44:14] were standing in front of a god in the
[44:16] way we're standing now we couldn't stand
[44:18] it
[44:19] now he couldn't judge our soul but he'd
[44:21] have this guy to have to deal with in my
[44:22] spirit realm
[44:24] see what we're moving to
[44:27] see what we're moving to
[44:29] we're moving higher
[44:30] we're moving to get this spirit man of
[44:32] us
[44:33] cleaned up amen for it it's not possible
[44:36] that the blood of bulls and of goats
[44:37] should take away sins wherefore when he
[44:39] cometh into the world
[44:41] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[44:44] wouldest not but a body
[44:46] has there prepared me now that was a
[44:49] natural body
[44:52] because
[44:53] if the if the if the old testament
[44:56] sacrifices were natural
[44:59] they were all natural they were all
[45:00] flesh of animals bulls goats turtle
[45:03] doves pigeons
[45:05] whatever more you want to say that they
[45:07] sacrificed that was a natural flesh
[45:09] thing so so you've got to understand
[45:11] that if that couldn't take away sin
[45:13] there had to come something in flesh
[45:15] that could take away sin
[45:16] because in flesh is where we fell all
[45:19] right we've been over that over and over
[45:20] and over again
[45:21] but let's go back just for a second to
[45:23] the old testament just stay right there
[45:26] because if we don't go back we've got to
[45:28] go to the old testament because i'll
[45:30] read you a quote here in just a minute
[45:31] where brother brown said that the old
[45:33] testament saints the old testament
[45:35] prophets built the body of jesus christ
[45:38] that's hard to understand if you just
[45:39] throw it out there so maybe i'll try to
[45:41] help you understand it a little bit
[45:44] because look the word of god is a person
[45:47] everybody with me in the beginning was
[45:48] the word word was with god and the word
[45:51] was god
[45:52] and that word
[45:54] was the logos
[45:55] that came out of god the son of god that
[45:57] we talked about a couple weeks ago a
[45:59] person
[46:01] a man
[46:02] that said let there be
[46:04] and all this came into being amen
[46:06] is that right
[46:08] tell amen
[46:09] amen that's that's the way it is but now
[46:11] then you take that person that said that
[46:15] that person
[46:17] there was something happened between
[46:19] there and the promise of the genesis 1
[46:21] 26 man
[46:23] not inside that we know genesis 1 26 man
[46:25] was the spirit realm
[46:27] but when he put him in 2 7 they
[46:29] something happened right in there that
[46:30] this
[46:31] whatever this is right here the logos
[46:33] that speaks the word could not become
[46:35] fully expressed
[46:38] they'll be okay with that
[46:40] because being fully expressed he was
[46:41] coming down in human flesh and lived
[46:43] with his children and we were going to
[46:44] be let there be let there be james
[46:46] colley let there be um
[46:49] good grave king remember your name
[46:50] sister charlotte
[46:52] i'm getting old too
[46:54] we've known each other a long time
[46:55] haven't we but that's what god would
[46:57] would be was going to do
[46:59] let there be not let there be
[47:01] sacrifices and animals and this and that
[47:05] and the other
[47:07] he was going to bring his children and
[47:08] we were going to what we were going to
[47:10] converse with him and he was going to be
[47:12] our father and we were going to be as
[47:13] children and we were going to live on
[47:14] this earth in the garden of eden
[47:17] he said how the world you know that
[47:18] because that's what we're going to
[47:19] do
[47:20] that's what we're going to end up at
[47:22] amen
[47:25] but remember there's going to be a
[47:26] difference between that garden of eden
[47:29] and that garden of eden
[47:31] that one had a devil involved
[47:33] that one had a serpent it had a beast in
[47:35] it this one over here will not when we
[47:38] get into that future home there will not
[47:40] be a devil
[47:41] to have to worry about
[47:43] and truly if you're born again today
[47:45] like i said before your piece of your
[47:47] future home is right here
[47:49] because if you're born again today the
[47:51] devil's not inside of you either
[47:53] he doesn't reside now he sure likes to
[47:55] talk in there yeah amen he's talking to
[47:58] you now
[48:04] so the old testament saints
[48:06] are prophets
[48:09] each one of them
[48:12] what did they do
[48:14] son of man prophesy
[48:17] prophesy
[48:18] most of the time
[48:20] it was a prophecy of condemnation
[48:24] because israel had turned from god right
[48:26] god said do this do this do this
[48:29] and you'll be okay
[48:31] but if you don't do this i'm going to
[48:33] send you somebody
[48:35] that's going to talk to you
[48:37] very sternly
[48:38] jeremiah ezekiel all the different ones
[48:41] but inside all that what's god doing
[48:44] he's get he's preparing the people for
[48:48] the messiah
[48:49] he's preparing the people so that this
[48:52] man that's way up here there's jehovah
[48:54] god that nobody can touch that nobody
[48:56] can see he's going to express himself
[48:58] can't fully express himself through
[49:00] isaiah jeremiah and all those different
[49:02] ones because they're not part of that
[49:03] genesis 1 26 man they're not the bride
[49:06] of jesus christ they have a position
[49:09] but they're not bright
[49:10] everybody did everybody see that it's
[49:12] not belittling them listen they're very
[49:14] powerful people
[49:16] listen they can do more with the holy
[49:18] ghost while they were on earth and
[49:19] sometimes we can
[49:23] they did more with an anointing
[49:26] then sometimes we can do with the
[49:27] baptism of the holy ghost in our soul
[49:29] that's why brother brown says we're
[49:30] living way below our privileges our
[49:32] privileges are as if we can do that and
[49:34] more
[49:36] we can do that plus
[49:38] because remember
[49:39] every one of them had a flaw
[49:43] moses he was a murderer
[49:47] murderer he killed a man
[49:49] right
[49:50] david
[49:52] committed adultery killed his best
[49:54] friend
[49:58] look at all the different ones
[50:00] they all had a flaw
[50:02] but what they were doing was they were
[50:03] building a part of the body for god to
[50:05] step out on when he came into human
[50:08] flesh
[50:09] because when jesus came because isaiah
[50:12] had to say a virgin
[50:14] shall conceive
[50:15] and bring forth a child
[50:17] that's not possible
[50:21] i will read in a minute mary says how's
[50:22] that possible
[50:24] she was even at 16 years old she had a
[50:25] little bit she knew about how babies
[50:27] were coming right
[50:29] out of me not knowing a man can have a
[50:31] baby
[50:32] he said with god all things are possible
[50:34] well what was she doing she was she knew
[50:36] she was referring to
[50:38] isaiah where a virgin shall conceive but
[50:42] isaiah had to say that so that god could
[50:44] put
[50:45] a seed in a womb
[50:47] and bring forth a child
[50:49] and then when the baby was born to us a
[50:52] child is born a son is given there's
[50:54] another scripture we could spend days at
[50:57] thousands of scriptures that jesus that
[50:59] body was built coming down through the
[51:01] old testament and then finally
[51:03] here he was
[51:05] he stepped right out
[51:07] and listen to this let's read this quote
[51:09] then
[51:10] number one this is from the masterpiece
[51:13] and then come finally the great head
[51:16] the head of a head of all of it
[51:18] the rest of the body just spoke of it
[51:21] the foundation was laid by the patriarch
[51:25] but the body was built by the word which
[51:27] was the prophets
[51:30] so the prophets said what did they do a
[51:31] prophet catches the voice of catches the
[51:34] thought of god and then he's the
[51:36] mouthpiece that doesn't speak his own
[51:38] words because listen
[51:40] isaiah according to the bible isaiah was
[51:42] a young man
[51:43] even when he died he was very young so
[51:45] he wasn't an old guy and he steps out
[51:47] one day and he said behold a virgin
[51:49] shall conceive and bring forth a child
[51:51] and he turns around walks back in the
[51:52] house
[51:54] because remember they weren't required
[51:56] to explain what they said
[51:59] they were just required to say what god
[52:01] told them to say
[52:02] amen
[52:06] the body was built by the word they were
[52:08] the word of god for that day
[52:10] but the body was built by the word which
[52:13] was the prophets
[52:14] and here comes the head of all of it
[52:17] jesus came on the scene
[52:19] there when this headpiece was put upon
[52:21] it we find in him the entire handiwork
[52:25] of god each one of them was a piece a
[52:27] finger a toe an eye an ear a nose a
[52:31] mouth the different pieces to the body
[52:34] but he was the body
[52:36] he was the one that god put it together
[52:41] all right listen
[52:43] there when the headpiece was put upon it
[52:44] we find in him the entire handiwork of
[52:46] god we find in him the perfect
[52:48] reflection
[52:50] of the word for he was the word
[52:54] the fullness of the word see isaiah was
[52:56] not the fullness of the word jeremiah
[52:58] was not the fullness they had their part
[53:00] ezekiel had his part son of man prophesy
[53:04] but watch
[53:05] the fullness of the word now now again
[53:09] i didn't put that in red but i should
[53:11] have now
[53:12] again now whose brother brown he's
[53:13] preaching the masterpiece
[53:15] he's talking about jesus christ back
[53:17] there he's talking about the old
[53:19] prophets back there but he's got to make
[53:21] it current
[53:23] now again
[53:25] god has the perfect masterpiece again
[53:29] he's already talked about the prophets
[53:31] he's already talked about jesus christ
[53:33] who's he talking about now
[53:36] me and you
[53:38] me and you this is the way we got to
[53:40] come we got to come old testament jesus
[53:42] christ being our savior
[53:45] and now again
[53:47] god has the perfect masterpiece again
[53:50] because the headstone's back
[53:54] we'll talk about that later on maybe
[53:55] some of you don't understand that but
[53:57] we'll we've got to we've got to
[53:58] understand it because that's who he was
[54:00] there's your headstone right there jesus
[54:02] christ the perfection of god the
[54:04] totality of god the fullness of the word
[54:07] so let's go to isaiah 7 13. let's read
[54:11] that over again like we did this morning
[54:16] and he said here you know house of david
[54:18] is it a small thing for you to wear men
[54:20] but will you wear in my god also
[54:22] therefore the lord himself shall give
[54:24] you a sign
[54:25] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[54:28] a son and shall call his name emmanuel
[54:30] which is by interpretation we know that
[54:33] is god with us all right isaiah 9 6 for
[54:36] unto us a child is born though
[54:39] this is what the child is going to step
[54:41] out on this is what god's going to step
[54:43] out on he's going to step out on that
[54:44] word
[54:47] unto us the son is given the government
[54:48] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[54:50] shall be called wonderful counsellor the
[54:52] mighty god the everlasting father the
[54:54] prince of peace of the increase of his
[54:56] government and peace there shall be no
[54:57] end
[54:59] sounds like a pretty important guy
[55:01] upon the throne of david upon his
[55:02] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[55:04] with judgment and with justice from
[55:06] henceforth even forever the zeal of the
[55:07] lord of hosts will perform this
[55:12] so there's isaiah we
[55:14] i'm going to pick we're going to go to
[55:15] isaiah 53 because to me
[55:18] isaiah 53
[55:21] gives you the whole picture of god and
[55:22] what he's going to do
[55:26] so you need to wake up just for a few
[55:27] minutes so we can read this okay
[55:30] just wake up just for a few minutes
[55:32] okay because if you're not i'm gonna
[55:34] walk back there and scream at you okay
[55:38] this brother that's coming in a couple
[55:40] of weeks that's coming in uh
[55:42] at the uh
[55:43] when we eat in november the 14th
[55:45] he uh
[55:47] the data of the whole group is the one
[55:48] that's got on his phone when his phone
[55:51] rings it goes wake up
[55:53] that's what his ringtone is
[55:55] and it's me
[55:58] he downloaded it and put it on his phone
[56:00] so now is it when the phone rings it
[56:02] says wake up
[56:05] so anyway
[56:07] who has believed our report
[56:11] that's my question to you
[56:13] who has believed
[56:15] our report isaiah 53 is writing this he
[56:18] is reporting
[56:20] i'm reporting this who's going to
[56:22] believe it
[56:25] all right it's what he's saying who has
[56:26] to believe thy report and to whom is the
[56:28] arm or the strength or the might of the
[56:29] lord revealed how is the arm of the lord
[56:32] revealed through jesus christ
[56:34] but to get jesus christ when you watch
[56:37] listen when this man that we were
[56:39] talking about this right here
[56:41] back in the old
[56:42] testament he comes down and gets into
[56:45] human flesh what does he bring with him
[56:49] he brings that genesis 1 26 man with him
[56:55] folks that's the soul of god genesis 1
[56:58] 26 is not a different soul of god
[57:01] it is the soul of god
[57:02] it's the attribute that me and you are
[57:05] before the foundation of the world
[57:06] that's us right there and he brings that
[57:09] weather he don't leave it up there he
[57:11] brings it with him
[57:15] listen that's why you and i can
[57:18] understand this word of god more than
[57:20] anybody
[57:21] theologian whatever you want to say
[57:23] because we're part of it
[57:26] we helped write it
[57:29] i'll clap too we helped write this bible
[57:36] because we're part of god not a
[57:37] different substance
[57:39] so as that substance moved
[57:42] we moved
[57:44] brother brown said you didn't know
[57:45] anything about it though because you
[57:47] were born down here born in sam what it
[57:49] was blacked out
[57:52] what he said
[57:53] it was blacked out jesus knew where he
[57:55] came from because he's the one that
[57:57] brought it
[57:59] the guy that brought it ought to know
[58:00] where he came from
[58:02] all right
[58:03] so he knew before abraham was i am
[58:07] that's why john 17 he could say he could
[58:09] say father i prayed for them
[58:13] what them genesis 1 26 people i prayed
[58:16] for them people because i saw their
[58:18] journey before i even got here
[58:20] and i know they're going to have
[58:21] problems
[58:23] for he shall grow up before him as a
[58:25] tender plant
[58:27] as a baby behold the virgin shall
[58:29] conceive as a root out of dry ground he
[58:31] has no former commonness in other words
[58:33] he wasn't maybe he wasn't the prettiest
[58:35] baby
[58:39] like michael
[58:41] was he your prettiest baby benjamin was
[58:43] not here so
[58:46] he was your prettiest baby okay i
[58:47] figured he was
[58:53] so anyway he's still pretty good looking
[58:55] kid
[58:56] man grown grown adult
[58:59] amen
[59:00] but look he has no formal communists in
[59:02] other words he didn't come the way that
[59:04] caiaphas maybe caiaphas was born
[59:08] in a hospital
[59:10] with a gown
[59:11] and all the smelly good stuff
[59:14] but when he heard this man that says the
[59:16] messiah was born over a manure pile
[59:20] with swaddling clothes which was the
[59:22] which was the cloth they put over the
[59:24] the sweaty ox to keep him from getting
[59:27] sores and blisters
[59:30] that's what swaddling clothes is folks
[59:33] it's it's like the horse blanket
[59:35] so guess what it's closest to the horse
[59:38] and whatever's on that horse is on that
[59:40] blanket
[59:41] that's what they had to wrap jesus in
[59:43] because they didn't have he didn't have
[59:44] a
[59:45] a carter's or uh
[59:47] oshkosh
[59:48] begosh
[59:50] isn't that right joyce i bet ellie's not
[59:53] been wrapped in swaddling clothes ever
[59:55] but look
[59:58] this is the way he came
[1:00:01] this is the way god came that's why i
[1:00:03] was this morning or yesterday i was
[1:00:05] thinking about i said god this is the
[1:00:06] way you came you chose to come this way
[1:00:11] why
[1:00:12] even though he's the god of glory he
[1:00:14] don't want to be
[1:00:15] when he was down here on earth
[1:00:18] he didn't want to be up here
[1:00:20] he wanted to be down here with the
[1:00:22] lowest of people
[1:00:23] now we know he's the god of glory we
[1:00:25] know he deserves all praise we know it
[1:00:27] deserves all us to bow our knee to him
[1:00:29] but while he was down here he was a
[1:00:31] servant
[1:00:33] amen he become a king
[1:00:36] man
[1:00:37] he was a root out of dry ground
[1:00:39] wait a minute yeah no former coming us
[1:00:42] and we shall see him there's no beauty
[1:00:44] that we should desire him
[1:00:46] in other words
[1:00:48] if you see something beautiful what's
[1:00:49] the first thing you do
[1:00:52] it catches your attention you see a
[1:00:54] beautiful flower a beautiful picture a
[1:00:56] pretty car an old car that's been really
[1:00:58] fixed up real good
[1:01:00] that's beauty but
[1:01:02] he walked through a crowd and nobody
[1:01:03] know who he was
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:07] he walked through a crowd and probably
[1:01:09] nobody knew who he was
[1:01:12] that's our god
[1:01:14] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:01:18] so guess what so are you
[1:01:21] a man of sorrow
[1:01:23] wow acquainted with grief
[1:01:26] we think we have problems
[1:01:30] have you ever just said and read this
[1:01:32] take it part by part
[1:01:34] and we hid our face from him he wasn't
[1:01:36] even somebody we wanted to look at
[1:01:41] he was despised
[1:01:44] and we in other words we didn't hold him
[1:01:46] up we stand when you esteem somebody you
[1:01:48] hold him up in honor we know while he
[1:01:50] was on earth nobody ever lifted him up
[1:01:53] all people they tried but
[1:01:56] they didn't care about this guy from
[1:01:57] galilee wasn't he from bethlehem wasn't
[1:02:00] he from nazareth does anything good come
[1:02:01] on nazareth even that's what philip or
[1:02:03] one of them said
[1:02:05] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:02:08] and carried our sorrows
[1:02:10] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:02:13] of god and afflicted when he was hanging
[1:02:14] on the cross they said kapha said he
[1:02:17] can't even save his self how in the
[1:02:18] world how is he going to save other
[1:02:19] people
[1:02:21] he just didn't know he was prophesying
[1:02:23] that he was not going to save his self
[1:02:26] that he was going to give his soul he
[1:02:28] was going to give his soul a ransom but
[1:02:29] they couldn't see the soul of god it was
[1:02:31] hid inside that flesh
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:35] but he was wounded
[1:02:39] for our transgression
[1:02:41] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:02:45] didn't didn't didn't deserve it
[1:02:50] but he took it
[1:02:52] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:02:54] him
[1:02:56] and with his stripes
[1:02:58] we get physical healing
[1:03:02] with his stripes on his body his flesh
[1:03:04] body
[1:03:05] all right but remember that's not what
[1:03:07] saves us it heals us
[1:03:10] that's not what saves us though
[1:03:13] it's that soul that's what saved us
[1:03:15] because we'll see right here
[1:03:18] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:03:24] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:03:28] wow peter
[1:03:33] bless the lord i'll be right there with
[1:03:34] you the whole time
[1:03:36] i got you back
[1:03:39] and i figured peter was pretty burly guy
[1:03:41] i mean peter wasn't a little wimp now a
[1:03:43] little john he was running around naked
[1:03:44] everywhere so i don't know about john
[1:03:46] the revelator but
[1:03:47] well it is it's true he just run off
[1:03:49] naked and somebody pulled his clothes
[1:03:50] off of him he just took off through the
[1:03:52] bushes
[1:03:53] but there was peter though with his
[1:03:54] sword
[1:03:58] this ain't gonna happen to you lord
[1:04:00] i'll take care of that right now
[1:04:03] god touched him and he
[1:04:05] whacked the guy's ear off
[1:04:08] jesus said
[1:04:09] peter this thing ain't over yet you're
[1:04:12] fighting with flesh and blood i'm fixing
[1:04:14] to go give my life so that we can have a
[1:04:16] spiritual battle
[1:04:18] but you're gonna deny me three times
[1:04:20] before the sun comes up the next day
[1:04:22] because that's the crop the crowing
[1:04:24] that many times is the daylight coming
[1:04:26] all right
[1:04:27] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:04:29] have turned everyone to his own way
[1:04:31] there was nobody there with him nobody
[1:04:33] even the ones that loved him and and you
[1:04:35] know even there was little john
[1:04:37] different ones that they just scattered
[1:04:40] the lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:04:44] of us all
[1:04:46] god almighty
[1:04:49] he was
[1:04:52] oppressed afflicted
[1:04:59] yet he never complained one time
[1:05:04] he never complained one time
[1:05:08] he has brought us a lamb
[1:05:11] to the slaughter
[1:05:13] and as a sheep before his shears is dumb
[1:05:16] so he opened not his mouth
[1:05:19] he didn't even make a case for
[1:05:20] himself when he come to the end when
[1:05:22] they were going to crucify him he never
[1:05:24] made a case for himself he could have
[1:05:26] made a case for himself
[1:05:28] he could have said i didn't do those
[1:05:29] things you said i was doing
[1:05:31] because remember pilate said are you not
[1:05:33] going to say anything
[1:05:34] see he just stood there and then they
[1:05:36] just looked at him
[1:05:39] he was taken from prison and from
[1:05:40] judgment
[1:05:42] and who shall declare his generation
[1:05:46] for he was cut off
[1:05:49] naturally
[1:05:52] remember i preached on that a long time
[1:05:54] ago who shall declare his generation
[1:05:56] because remember his natural genealogy
[1:05:58] was cut off that day at calvary that he
[1:05:59] was a man he could have had children he
[1:06:01] could have had a progeny he could have
[1:06:03] had a generation of jesus's naturally
[1:06:06] but that's not why he came
[1:06:08] he didn't come to make a natural lineage
[1:06:10] he didn't come to make a natural kingdom
[1:06:12] he came to make a spiritual kingdom all
[1:06:13] right the natural kingdom is what was
[1:06:15] killing people
[1:06:18] so he come to bring a spiritual kingdom
[1:06:20] but who shall declare his generation
[1:06:22] well that's if you receive the baptism
[1:06:24] of the holy ghost you're absolutely
[1:06:25] declaring his generation
[1:06:27] for he was cut off by the land of the
[1:06:28] living
[1:06:29] for the transgression of my people was
[1:06:31] he stricken
[1:06:32] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:06:34] and with the rich in his death because
[1:06:36] he had done no violence
[1:06:38] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:06:41] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:06:44] he hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[1:06:46] make his soul
[1:06:50] see it's been talking about his body the
[1:06:51] whole time
[1:06:52] he by his stripes were healed we we know
[1:06:55] that when jesus resurrected out of the
[1:06:57] grave that there was only nail prints in
[1:06:59] his hand and the thing in his side
[1:07:02] his body had been preserved
[1:07:07] but his soul
[1:07:08] was what you better look at
[1:07:10] a lot of men
[1:07:12] their wounds got better
[1:07:15] but there's no man
[1:07:18] could die
[1:07:20] and resurrect
[1:07:21] and come back inside you
[1:07:23] only god himself
[1:07:26] well thou shalt make his soul and
[1:07:28] offering for sin
[1:07:30] he shall see his seed
[1:07:32] or his what progeny
[1:07:34] his generation
[1:07:36] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:07:38] pleasures of the lord shall prosper in
[1:07:39] his hand he shall see of the truth now
[1:07:41] look here we go again he shall see the
[1:07:43] travail of his soul
[1:07:45] and shall be satisfied
[1:07:47] by his knowledge by his knowledge shall
[1:07:49] my righteous servant justify many for he
[1:07:52] shall bear their iniquities
[1:07:54] so what you get saved by you get saved
[1:07:56] by the pure
[1:07:58] unadulterated soul of god
[1:08:00] because remember they stood up to him
[1:08:02] one day and said said something and he
[1:08:04] said there's no man oh it's a good
[1:08:06] master and he said there's nobody good
[1:08:08] no one good but god
[1:08:10] you know why because he was living in a
[1:08:12] flesh body
[1:08:13] all right which was dying
[1:08:16] amen it was god but it was dying
[1:08:19] therefore will i divide him a portion
[1:08:21] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:08:23] spoil with the strong because he hath
[1:08:25] what poured out his soul unto death
[1:08:29] not in death
[1:08:30] his soul can't die
[1:08:32] your soul can't die
[1:08:36] but he poured out his soul brother brown
[1:08:38] said he played the part of death
[1:08:41] we'll get to that later about hanging on
[1:08:42] the cross that he didn't die
[1:08:46] his flesh died
[1:08:48] because the soul was removable isn't
[1:08:50] that what happens when you die when you
[1:08:52] humanly die
[1:08:53] your body dies and your soul goes
[1:08:56] somewhere else
[1:08:59] the only good thing about him though is
[1:09:01] is he resurrected
[1:09:03] and came back inside of
[1:09:04] you because he hath poured out his soul
[1:09:07] unto death and he was numbered with the
[1:09:09] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:09:11] many and made intercession
[1:09:13] for
[1:09:14] the transgressors and that's me and you
[1:09:16] if you don't know what transgression is
[1:09:18] that's me and you
[1:09:21] so with his flesh it was a sacrifice
[1:09:23] that the flesh had to die
[1:09:26] what did john say one day he said behold
[1:09:29] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[1:09:31] of the world he was identifying that
[1:09:33] that was the sacrifice
[1:09:35] and jesus he said well i need to be
[1:09:37] baptized of you and jesus said i know
[1:09:39] that but
[1:09:41] to fulfill the old testament
[1:09:44] showing he's still under the old
[1:09:46] testament to fulfill the old testament
[1:09:48] the sacrifice had to be washed before it
[1:09:50] was sacrificed
[1:09:52] the lamb had to be washed
[1:09:55] put up
[1:09:57] he said suffer it to be so to fulfill
[1:09:59] all righteousness he was fulfilling the
[1:10:01] old testament by being baptized he
[1:10:03] didn't need to be baptized
[1:10:05] jesus didn't need to be baptized he was
[1:10:08] because what did john say i need to be
[1:10:09] baptized you
[1:10:11] of you
[1:10:12] he said no he said i know that but to
[1:10:14] what but but look you're the high priest
[1:10:19] you're the high priest
[1:10:21] i'm the sacrifice you've already
[1:10:23] identified you said behold the lamb of
[1:10:26] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:10:28] so that lamb's got to die
[1:10:30] that's right
[1:10:32] that lamb had to die and there stood
[1:10:34] the high priest
[1:10:37] to wash the sacrifice
[1:10:39] and that's what john did he washed the
[1:10:41] sacrifice
[1:10:44] and then jesus went what the spirit of
[1:10:46] god came upon him and said this is my
[1:10:47] beloved son and whom i'm pleased to
[1:10:48] dwell
[1:10:51] same way with you at the baptism of the
[1:10:52] holy ghost god does the same thing
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:56] so now let's go to luke 1 verse 26
[1:11:00] real quick
[1:11:03] don't want to try to be too long we're
[1:11:04] going to have a
[1:11:06] little time of fellowship downstairs
[1:11:08] when we get done
[1:11:09] luke 1 verse 26 is in the sixth month
[1:11:12] the angel gabriel was sent from god into
[1:11:14] a city of galilee named nazareth any
[1:11:16] good thing come out nazareth
[1:11:18] well there was a virgin down there
[1:11:21] that was one good thing come out in
[1:11:22] nazareth there was a virgin there
[1:11:25] and she was espoused to a man named
[1:11:27] joseph of the house of david and the
[1:11:29] virgin's name was mary
[1:11:31] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:11:33] hail thou
[1:11:34] that are highly favored the lord is with
[1:11:36] thee blessed art thou among women and
[1:11:38] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[1:11:40] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[1:11:42] of salutation in other words what's he
[1:11:44] doing here
[1:11:47] and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:11:49] mary
[1:11:50] for thou has found favor with god
[1:11:53] and behold
[1:11:55] isaiah
[1:11:57] 7
[1:11:58] isaiah 9 is fixing to be fulfilled
[1:12:03] and i like the way brother branham he
[1:12:04] set that up he said you know he said he
[1:12:06] said probably mary and joseph talking
[1:12:09] about getting married and they would be
[1:12:10] sitting out on the porch
[1:12:13] and they'd be sitting there and they'd
[1:12:14] be talking they'd be going
[1:12:16] they'd read maybe isaiah 9 isaiah 7
[1:12:19] and then start in conversation and mary
[1:12:21] would go
[1:12:22] wow
[1:12:24] i wonder who that's going to be
[1:12:27] joel said i don't know said but
[1:12:29] he's got to come out of here and he's
[1:12:30] got to come out of bethlehem we'll read
[1:12:32] it in just a minute he's got to come
[1:12:33] from these different places and put
[1:12:34] everything everything's got to come
[1:12:35] together perfect
[1:12:39] nazareth
[1:12:41] they were sitting in nazareth
[1:12:43] she was a virgin
[1:12:46] okay
[1:12:48] so the stage is set
[1:12:50] but remember she is like the woman at
[1:12:52] the well
[1:12:54] no not exactly you understand but she is
[1:12:56] in the same situation
[1:12:58] she had read
[1:13:00] we know when the messiah comes well
[1:13:02] that's the same thing mary said that's
[1:13:03] why mary
[1:13:05] didn't really have a problem with it she
[1:13:06] was just wondering how it was going to
[1:13:07] happen
[1:13:09] because she didn't know a man but she
[1:13:10] knew that isaiah 9 and isaiah 7 said a
[1:13:13] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[1:13:14] child
[1:13:16] and said behold thou shalt conceive in
[1:13:18] thy womb and bring forth the son and
[1:13:20] shall call his name jesus he shall be
[1:13:22] great and shall be called the son of the
[1:13:24] highest and the lord god shall give unto
[1:13:26] him the throne of his father david
[1:13:28] there's that other promise that's
[1:13:29] telling you about
[1:13:31] sitting on the throne of david in the
[1:13:32] millennium
[1:13:34] a promise that god give him and he shall
[1:13:36] reign over the house of jacob forever
[1:13:38] and of his kingdom
[1:13:39] there shall be no end then mary said of
[1:13:41] the angel
[1:13:42] how shall this be seeing i know not a
[1:13:44] man
[1:13:47] and the angel said unto her the holy
[1:13:50] ghost
[1:13:51] shall come upon thee
[1:13:53] and the power of the high shall
[1:13:54] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:13:56] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:13:58] be called the son of god amen
[1:14:03] overshadow thee
[1:14:07] so god created egg and sperm
[1:14:10] placed it in mary
[1:14:11] and i'll read it here in just a minute i
[1:14:13] think i got her i may wait till later on
[1:14:15] that
[1:14:16] she was just an incubator there was
[1:14:18] nothing connected that he she was not
[1:14:21] his mother
[1:14:22] we know that
[1:14:25] but god had to use her because he said
[1:14:27] in isaiah the way i'm going to get into
[1:14:29] the human race and purify it is this way
[1:14:32] isaiah 7 isaiah 9 i'm going to come by a
[1:14:35] virgin i'm not going to come by sex
[1:14:37] desire and this woman mary is not going
[1:14:39] to have any sensation about it or then
[1:14:42] it would be me and human race doing
[1:14:43] something that we really wasn't supposed
[1:14:44] to do and that's what brother ryan was
[1:14:46] talking about he said you see what you
[1:14:47] got god doing if you just give the sperm
[1:14:50] to mary and she produces the egg all
[1:14:52] right so god what the creator created
[1:14:55] his own self a body
[1:14:57] the full creation
[1:14:59] the whole thing egg and sperm
[1:15:03] fulfilling isaiah
[1:15:05] now let's go to luke 2 and 4.
[1:15:09] and joseph also went from galilee out of
[1:15:11] the city of nazareth under judea to the
[1:15:13] city of david which is called bethlehem
[1:15:15] because remember
[1:15:17] could anything good come out of nazareth
[1:15:18] he came out in nazareth but remember the
[1:15:20] bible i'm going to read it here in just
[1:15:21] a minute micah
[1:15:23] that he had to be born in bethlehem
[1:15:24] because the prophet micah said he was
[1:15:27] going to be see he had to be what the
[1:15:29] prophets built the body and told him
[1:15:31] where he's going to come from
[1:15:33] all right
[1:15:35] now see you say well by the way this is
[1:15:37] born that's you
[1:15:40] god puts you in this bible
[1:15:42] you've got to get yourself out of that
[1:15:44] bible and see where god put you and
[1:15:47] placed you
[1:15:48] he sacrificed himself so that you and i
[1:15:51] could have eternal life
[1:15:53] and be that genesis 1 26 man that was
[1:15:56] before the foundation of the world that
[1:15:58] can't sin never will sin never going to
[1:16:00] sin
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:03] which is call bethlehem because he was
[1:16:06] the house and lineage of david
[1:16:08] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[1:16:11] remember he never touched her until
[1:16:12] after she was
[1:16:14] birthed the child
[1:16:16] being great with child
[1:16:17] so it was that while they were there the
[1:16:19] days were accomplished that she should
[1:16:20] be delivered
[1:16:22] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[1:16:24] now oh hold it right there
[1:16:27] flesh has come into being
[1:16:31] flesh
[1:16:33] if she brought forth that means she
[1:16:34] birthed
[1:16:36] a son
[1:16:40] wrapped him in swaddling clothes like i
[1:16:41] said before swaddling clothes is like a
[1:16:43] horse blanket
[1:16:45] and laid him in a manger
[1:16:46] because there was no room for them in
[1:16:48] the end
[1:16:49] why they put them in a manger
[1:16:52] that's where lambs live
[1:16:54] they live in a barn they live in a
[1:16:55] manger
[1:16:57] and they were in the same country
[1:16:58] preachers
[1:17:02] abiding in the field keeping watch over
[1:17:04] the congregation
[1:17:07] some of you by night because you're
[1:17:08] asleep
[1:17:12] yeah
[1:17:13] brother dardy every time i say that he
[1:17:14] says help us
[1:17:18] at least he's awake enough to say that
[1:17:25] brother darty's been here
[1:17:26] and brother colley has been here as long
[1:17:27] as these walls have been here thank god
[1:17:30] for that
[1:17:31] you'll get your reward buddy i'll
[1:17:33] promise you that
[1:17:34] y'all been faithful
[1:17:36] and they were in the same kind that's
[1:17:37] what it was he kept white had to be
[1:17:39] shepherds read that read that
[1:17:41] or listen to that message
[1:17:43] it come to preachers
[1:17:45] the salutation the the first message
[1:17:48] came to the preachers and what the
[1:17:49] preachers do they took it and they
[1:17:51] watched over their flop by night look
[1:17:52] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[1:17:54] them and the glory of the lord shone
[1:17:55] around about them and they were sore
[1:17:57] afraid
[1:17:59] and the angel said unto them
[1:18:03] somebody else asleep
[1:18:05] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:18:08] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[1:18:10] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:18:14] for unto you is born this day in the
[1:18:16] city of david a savior look who they are
[1:18:18] identifying who this little baby is
[1:18:22] which is christ the lord
[1:18:26] wow
[1:18:27] when you say those two words
[1:18:31] you've went all the way back into
[1:18:32] eternity
[1:18:35] because christ is the anointed one
[1:18:37] christ is the one that stood and said
[1:18:38] let there be
[1:18:41] and this will be a sign unto you you
[1:18:42] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:18:44] clothes lying in a manger
[1:18:46] and suddenly there was the angel with
[1:18:48] the angels a multitude of the heavenly
[1:18:49] host praising god and saying glory to
[1:18:51] god in the heist and on earth peace
[1:18:54] good will toward men and it came to pass
[1:18:57] as the angels were gone away from them
[1:18:58] into heaven the shepherds said one to
[1:19:00] another
[1:19:02] let's go check this out
[1:19:05] there was no bible for them to read
[1:19:09] except the old testament scrolls
[1:19:11] and they were shepherds
[1:19:13] they were preachers
[1:19:16] let us now go into bethlehem and see
[1:19:18] this thing which has come to pass
[1:19:19] because that's what the angel told them
[1:19:20] where it was going to be at
[1:19:22] which the lord hath made known unto us
[1:19:26] and they came with haste
[1:19:28] and found mary and joseph and the babe
[1:19:30] lying in a manger
[1:19:32] okay let's go to micah 5 verse 2.
[1:19:36] says but thou bethlehem ephrata
[1:19:40] though thou be a little among the
[1:19:41] thousands of judah
[1:19:44] yet out of these shall he come forth
[1:19:46] unto me
[1:19:47] that is to be the ruler in israel
[1:19:50] whose goings forth have been from old
[1:19:53] from of old from everlasting
[1:19:57] now let's go to matthew 2 verse 1 i want
[1:20:00] you to understand something
[1:20:01] even herod herod was
[1:20:06] a tetri art or a ruler
[1:20:09] even herod watch now when jesus was born
[1:20:12] in bethlehem of judea in the days of
[1:20:13] herod the king behold there came wise
[1:20:15] men from the east to jerusalem
[1:20:18] do you know this is how
[1:20:20] this is how they know that jesus was not
[1:20:23] born
[1:20:24] at 1 bc or or 81
[1:20:28] he was born in 4 bc
[1:20:30] because herod died
[1:20:32] sometime before
[1:20:34] it became a.d
[1:20:36] everybody got that
[1:20:38] even brother branham brings that out he
[1:20:40] was born in 4 bc the reason he was born
[1:20:41] in 4 bc is because herod
[1:20:44] was the the ruler and he died like a
[1:20:47] couple years later but but look you got
[1:20:50] to be careful because he's going to kill
[1:20:52] the babies that are two years old and
[1:20:53] back
[1:20:55] everybody got that
[1:20:57] this child that they're fixing to go see
[1:20:59] he's going to be a child not a baby
[1:21:00] that's right okay when the when the um
[1:21:04] three wise men come to visit him it's
[1:21:06] not a baby laying in a manger
[1:21:08] no it's a child it's a young child
[1:21:10] that's why he kills all the babies from
[1:21:12] two years down all right now when jesus
[1:21:15] was born in bethlehem of judea and the
[1:21:16] days of herod that came behold there
[1:21:17] came wise men from the east to jerusalem
[1:21:20] saying where is he born king of the jews
[1:21:23] for he we have seen his star in the east
[1:21:25] and come to worship him when herod the
[1:21:27] king had heard these things he was
[1:21:28] troubled in all jerusalem with him
[1:21:32] hmm
[1:21:34] it wasn't kept quiet
[1:21:36] but why didn't caiaphas and why didn't
[1:21:38] the ones that
[1:21:40] caiaphas had to be alive
[1:21:43] because he was probably in his 60s or
[1:21:45] 70s and jesus was in his 30s he had to
[1:21:47] be 20 or 30 years old what i'm saying is
[1:21:49] there's history behind all this
[1:21:52] there's history that they can say
[1:21:54] herod was troubled there was a a baby
[1:21:57] born supposedly be a virgin woman in in
[1:22:00] bethlehem where was he supposed to be
[1:22:01] born bethlehem thus it is written by the
[1:22:04] prophet verse 5.
[1:22:06] when he had gathered all the chief
[1:22:08] priests and scribes in other words
[1:22:10] there's all the chief priests and
[1:22:12] scribes
[1:22:13] of the people together he demanded them
[1:22:15] where christ should be born and they
[1:22:17] said unto him in bethlehem they knew
[1:22:19] where he's going to be born
[1:22:23] but he came a different way
[1:22:26] for thus it is written by the prophet
[1:22:28] micah and thou bethlehem in the land of
[1:22:31] judah are not the least among the
[1:22:32] princes of judah for out of thee shall
[1:22:34] come a governor that shall rule my
[1:22:36] people israel then herod when he had
[1:22:38] probably called the wise men inquired of
[1:22:40] them diligently what time the star
[1:22:42] appeared so
[1:22:43] he got his astronomers out
[1:22:45] what time that star appeared well it
[1:22:47] appeared two years ago it took us two
[1:22:49] years to get here okay
[1:22:50] all right
[1:22:52] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[1:22:54] go and search diligently for the young
[1:22:56] child not baby and when they found him
[1:22:59] when you have found him bring me word
[1:23:01] again that i may come and worship him
[1:23:03] well he wasn't he's going to kill him
[1:23:06] when they had heard the king they
[1:23:07] departed and lo the star which they saw
[1:23:09] in the east went before them till it
[1:23:10] came and stood over where the young
[1:23:12] child was and when they saw the star
[1:23:14] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[1:23:17] and when they were come see they were
[1:23:19] looking for something
[1:23:21] they saw the star
[1:23:24] that's the problem that people have with
[1:23:25] the cloud
[1:23:28] they just weren't looking for something
[1:23:31] i was looking for
[1:23:32] something i was for looking for christ
[1:23:35] to come
[1:23:37] back in a cloud
[1:23:39] they weren't looking for it so they
[1:23:40] don't they deny it same way with i bet
[1:23:42] you people denied this and said ain't
[1:23:44] nothing but three wives men knew what
[1:23:46] they were talking about amen you and i
[1:23:49] know what we're talking about we saw
[1:23:52] and believed everything that's told by
[1:23:54] to us by this prophet
[1:23:58] the problem was they didn't believe
[1:24:00] those old testament prophets they killed
[1:24:02] them jesus said you've you you wiped
[1:24:04] their tombs off
[1:24:06] but you're the one that put them in
[1:24:07] there
[1:24:09] wow
[1:24:10] when they had heard the king they
[1:24:11] departed lo the star which they saw in
[1:24:13] the east went before them until it came
[1:24:15] and stood over where the young child was
[1:24:16] and when they saw the star they rejoiced
[1:24:18] with its deed and great joy
[1:24:21] and when they were
[1:24:22] coming to the house they saw the young
[1:24:24] child with mary his mother and fell down
[1:24:26] and worshiped him and when they had
[1:24:28] opened their treasure
[1:24:31] what was it they presented unto him
[1:24:33] gifts gold
[1:24:34] frankincense
[1:24:36] and myrrh which thank god for a profit
[1:24:40] gold is deity
[1:24:42] frankincense dedication
[1:24:44] and murr is put on you when you die so
[1:24:46] it's deity dedicated
[1:24:48] unto death they told him exactly how he
[1:24:50] was gonna how he was gonna die
[1:24:54] told him exactly how that was gonna
[1:24:56] happen
[1:24:57] all right we're gonna read these two
[1:24:58] quotes and then we'll we're done
[1:25:00] all right everybody all right
[1:25:06] god's wrap gift
[1:25:09] listen to a prophet
[1:25:11] it ought to be a real attractive to the
[1:25:13] people
[1:25:15] little jehovah
[1:25:17] crying like a baby
[1:25:20] god made flesh in a package
[1:25:25] god who covers all space and time
[1:25:29] was before there was a world or a star
[1:25:33] or a molecule
[1:25:35] wrapped himself in a little package
[1:25:38] and was laid in a manger in a stable
[1:25:41] where the manures of the cattle and
[1:25:43] sheep
[1:25:44] and things up over that stable
[1:25:47] and this little manger on straw hay
[1:25:49] jehovah was laying there crying like a
[1:25:51] baby
[1:25:52] can you imagine it
[1:25:56] let's go to the next one
[1:25:57] super sign
[1:26:01] jehovah god became man
[1:26:04] took on our stock
[1:26:06] crossed himself from god and became man
[1:26:09] there's the sign
[1:26:12] he was god
[1:26:13] and became man
[1:26:15] not rich men
[1:26:17] but poor man
[1:26:20] this is the super sign you've asked for
[1:26:23] a sign said god i'll give you one an
[1:26:26] everlasting sign
[1:26:28] he could have come otherwise as i've
[1:26:30] said
[1:26:32] but a baby
[1:26:34] why did he become a baby
[1:26:36] when that first little toothless mouth
[1:26:40] opened in that manger
[1:26:42] on that first crib first christmas
[1:26:44] morning in his little manger crib and
[1:26:46] the first little yell went from it
[1:26:48] went from his voice
[1:26:50] that was god crying
[1:26:56] he had he had to start somewhere
[1:26:59] that was god crying
[1:27:02] jehovah crying a man
[1:27:05] came from god and was man
[1:27:07] ever wit
[1:27:09] man
[1:27:10] came to the world with nothing
[1:27:12] but still man
[1:27:14] what was he trying to do
[1:27:16] what was he purposing
[1:27:19] he cried like a baby in the manger
[1:27:22] he played like a boy on the street
[1:27:26] he worked with his
[1:27:28] daddy in the carpenter shop he taught
[1:27:30] like a man but yet he was emmanuel
[1:27:34] he came exactly the way
[1:27:36] the bible said he would
[1:27:38] yet he came a different way
[1:27:42] this is the super sign
[1:27:44] god dwelling in the creation
[1:27:46] that he created
[1:27:48] a body thou hast prepared me
[1:27:51] the super sign it shall be a sign unto
[1:27:54] you
[1:27:55] he was so poor
[1:27:57] that when he came to earth he came
[1:27:59] through a borrowed womb
[1:28:01] a borrowed womb of a woman and had to
[1:28:03] borrow a grave to be buried in
[1:28:06] god a virgin shall conceive without
[1:28:08] sexual
[1:28:09] interception
[1:28:11] jehovah borrowed the womb of mary a
[1:28:13] woman to perform the duty
[1:28:15] that he'd give an everlasting sign
[1:28:18] and was so poor on earth after 33 years
[1:28:21] and of half of ministry he had to borrow
[1:28:24] a grave to be buried in can you imagine
[1:28:27] talk about immaculate conception
[1:28:30] what meanest thou anyhow
[1:28:35] that god that said let there be
[1:28:42] that there was so many there are so many
[1:28:45] titles that you can't write them in a
[1:28:47] book
[1:28:51] he never had a beginning and he'll never
[1:28:52] have an end
[1:28:56] didn't hurt until he came to be a human
[1:28:59] he didn't cry until he became a human
[1:29:03] but he did it for me and you
[1:29:06] he didn't do it for himself listen he's
[1:29:08] god
[1:29:10] but he decided
[1:29:12] that was his plan
[1:29:14] he knew you and i were going to fall
[1:29:17] he knew we were going to need salvation
[1:29:20] and he was going to have to do it in
[1:29:21] flesh because he could not die as
[1:29:23] jehovah god
[1:29:26] he had to die as a human mortal man
[1:29:30] and he died for me
[1:29:32] and he died for you
[1:29:35] you see what now
[1:29:37] if you turn god down look what you're
[1:29:39] turning down
[1:29:41] every sinner that turned god turns god
[1:29:43] down has to crawl over and walk over the
[1:29:46] cross
[1:29:47] to get to hell
[1:29:50] because that's what stood between you
[1:29:52] and hell
[1:29:54] was the cross
[1:29:56] a man
[1:29:58] you
[1:29:59] a man make yourself god no
[1:30:02] it was god
[1:30:04] that had made himself a man
[1:30:07] he came a little bit different way
[1:30:10] what about me and you
[1:30:13] we need to come a little bit different
[1:30:14] way
[1:30:16] than what we've come
[1:30:18] before used to say in in in ball we'd
[1:30:21] say we need to up our game a little bit
[1:30:25] we need to all up our game a little bit
[1:30:27] be a little more sincere read another
[1:30:29] read a little more pray a little more
[1:30:31] study a little more
[1:30:33] because if god who did not have to do
[1:30:36] these things
[1:30:38] ever
[1:30:40] he decided that's what he was going to
[1:30:42] do
[1:30:44] and he gave his body
[1:30:46] a sacrifice
[1:30:48] but he gave his soul
[1:30:49] an offering for your sin
[1:30:52] because he can come back inside of you
[1:30:54] he can come back inside of you and make
[1:30:56] you just as perfect as he is
[1:30:59] no sacrifice in the old testament could
[1:31:00] do that
[1:31:02] and listen god didn't send a prophet in
[1:31:04] the end time to make that any different
[1:31:06] i believe he come to magnify
[1:31:09] what jesus christ did for us
[1:31:11] not to make it different but to make to
[1:31:14] magnify
[1:31:15] because what's the magnification of god
[1:31:17] it's going on up the statue of perfect
[1:31:19] man it's seeing that the headstone has
[1:31:20] come to me and you
[1:31:23] that the son of man ministry is here
[1:31:25] that you and i can live
[1:31:27] different
[1:31:28] listen don't try to be odd
[1:31:31] you'd be like jesus christ and you will
[1:31:32] be odd
[1:31:34] because you i'm i'm what i'm telling you
[1:31:36] when we when we start reading now the
[1:31:38] life of jesus as he gets older and goes
[1:31:40] up through this this stage of his life
[1:31:42] and matthew mark luke and john
[1:31:45] if that's the minister if that's the son
[1:31:47] of man
[1:31:48] and that's the way he acted
[1:31:51] and the results he got
[1:31:55] then if the son of man ministries here
[1:31:57] it's got to be the same
[1:32:00] they're going to hate you
[1:32:02] you're going to have to be this way in
[1:32:03] that way you they're not going to
[1:32:05] they're going to
[1:32:07] even your own friends
[1:32:09] even maybe your own message friends
[1:32:14] because of doctrine and because of a lot
[1:32:16] of things we've been cast out
[1:32:18] but you know what
[1:32:20] thank god
[1:32:22] if that's the pattern that brings the
[1:32:23] son of man back in the end time in a
[1:32:26] group of people then bring it on let's
[1:32:28] stand to our feet
[1:32:30] then bring it off that's the way it's
[1:32:31] got to be bring it on
[1:32:35] if god who didn't have to do these
[1:32:37] things he didn't have to be smitten he
[1:32:39] didn't have to be
[1:32:40] stricken he didn't have to get up on a
[1:32:42] cross he didn't have to
[1:32:44] sit there and let
[1:32:45] the romans spit on him and drag his
[1:32:47] clothes off and
[1:32:49] part his garment and all that stuff
[1:32:52] i mean come on
[1:32:55] then what's the little sacrifice that we
[1:32:56] need to do
[1:32:58] to serve god
[1:33:00] we're going to sing a song i think they
[1:33:02] got a
[1:33:03] a song that we're going to put on the
[1:33:04] board and uh yeah the brothers in the
