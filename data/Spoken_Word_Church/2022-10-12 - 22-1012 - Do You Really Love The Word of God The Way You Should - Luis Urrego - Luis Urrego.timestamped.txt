[10:26] on airplane mode
[10:29] I just because it worked last time
[10:39] all right well let's just go let's just
[10:42] go to the word and this turn with me to
[10:44] Revelations chapter 2.
[10:46] Revelations chapter 2.
[10:53] and let's start at verse one
[10:58] Revelations 2 1. it says unto the angel
[11:01] of the Church of Ephesus
[11:03] right these things Seth he that holdeth
[11:06] the Seven Stars in his right hand
[11:09] will walketh in the midst of the seven
[11:11] golden candlesticks I know that works
[11:14] and thy labor and thy patience and how
[11:17] thou can snot bear them which are evil
[11:20] and thou has tried them which say they
[11:23] are Apostles and they're not and has
[11:26] found them Liars as born and has
[11:28] patience and for my namesake has labored
[11:31] and has not fainted nevertheless I have
[11:34] somewhat against thee because thou has
[11:36] left thy First Love now you remember
[11:39] this is the word this is Jesus speaking
[11:42] it wasn't Paul and it wasn't one of the
[11:45] Apostles and it wasn't uh anybody
[11:47] Barnabas or anybody this was Jesus
[11:49] speaking to the church
[11:51] amen amen nevertheless I have somewhat
[11:53] against it because thou Hast left thy
[11:55] First Love remember therefore from
[11:58] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[12:01] the first works or else I will come unto
[12:03] thee quickly and will remove thy
[12:05] Candlestick out of his place except thou
[12:08] repent praise the Lord Jesus you may be
[12:10] seated this evening
[12:13] hey man
[12:16] I mean I want to just
[12:19] I want you all to just ask yourself a
[12:21] question as as I put it and you might
[12:22] have seen right here in the title but
[12:25] just wanted to just maybe do a like a
[12:28] little Sunday school lesson this evening
[12:30] but
[12:31] just think about
[12:33] and you know many times when when we
[12:35] preach as ministers we we preach things
[12:37] and and sometimes we preach things from
[12:40] our from our heart
[12:42] mainly things that we are experiencing
[12:45] uh because what what what what what
[12:48] happens is that as maybe as you're
[12:50] studying the word of God and you're
[12:52] looking and then you're you're you want
[12:53] to look into yourself and really exp and
[12:56] express yourself and what's happening in
[12:59] your life you see
[13:01] because
[13:02] um sometimes you know we
[13:04] if we preach because we're preaching on
[13:08] someone at the church or we're preaching
[13:10] you know that's probably not the wrong
[13:11] that's probably the wrong way to go by
[13:13] but if you look at if I look at myself
[13:15] first and realize where I'm wrong where
[13:18] I should correct myself or where or
[13:21] where am I falling amen then you can
[13:24] maybe help the people more in that way
[13:25] you see so I you know it's a question
[13:28] that that we should all including me you
[13:30] know we need to ask ourselves is do we
[13:32] really love the word of God the way we
[13:34] should and I just want to title that
[13:36] tonight and I want to make I want you to
[13:39] make it personal and ask that that
[13:41] question yourself do you really love the
[13:44] word of God the way you should
[13:48] because if you love the way the word of
[13:52] God the way you should it would reflect
[13:54] in many different areas in your life
[13:58] because it all stems from the word the
[14:01] way we live the way we we we behave the
[14:04] way we act ourselves it all stems from
[14:06] that and so many times you know when we
[14:09] don't do or we do
[14:12] um it it it reflects back on the way we
[14:16] look at the word of God how important is
[14:19] the word of God to you or how not
[14:20] important is the word of God to you you
[14:23] see what I'm saying so in in looking at
[14:26] this here Paul uh not Paul but but Jesus
[14:29] was uh here at the first church age in
[14:32] Ephesus
[14:33] just in the first church age
[14:36] they had all they at a point in time
[14:39] they had already left their first love
[14:44] they had already they were probably got
[14:46] got in on fire for God they they they
[14:48] they they they they saw the word for
[14:51] their day and they were on fire but it
[14:53] wasn't a span of about 10 to 30 years
[14:55] according to history that after Paul had
[14:58] visited them that they started slowly
[15:01] waning
[15:02] they started slowly uh of uh uh drifting
[15:08] and losing their first love
[15:11] the truck all right and some of us amen
[15:14] after a week
[15:16] that you've had a good service or you've
[15:18] had a Revival or you had something a
[15:20] week or just a few days later you're
[15:22] waning and they shouldn't be like that
[15:25] Saints
[15:26] amen it shouldn't be like that because
[15:28] Jesus was telling them Hey listen go
[15:31] back to your first love and if you want
[15:33] to find me where you left me that you
[15:36] you'll just find me right there wherever
[15:37] you left me that's where I'll be waiting
[15:39] for you
[15:40] amen and you re we realize that it's not
[15:43] Jesus leaving us it's it it's us leaving
[15:45] him
[15:46] because it Jesus says here amen you left
[15:49] your first love now that denotes amen
[15:52] that that love that he's talking about
[15:54] here denotes uh uh it's it's the word
[15:57] agape
[15:58] amen
[16:00] and so if it's the word Agape it means
[16:02] that it's a person that they left
[16:05] which was Jesus that they left and what
[16:08] is Jesus the word
[16:11] so they didn't leave Paul they didn't
[16:13] leave they didn't leave the disciples
[16:15] they didn't leave anybody else what they
[16:17] left was the word and it wasn't all uh
[16:21] you know just at one moment that it was
[16:25] a slow transition
[16:27] well maybe I just won't go to church
[16:29] today
[16:30] oh maybe oh it's Wednesday I just won't
[16:34] go
[16:35] oh it's raining outside I won't go or
[16:38] maybe I just won't pray tonight you know
[16:41] I'm just so tired you know well maybe
[16:43] I'll just do just two three minutes you
[16:46] see it was just a slow transition until
[16:48] finally Jesus had to tell him listen
[16:50] you've you've you've gone you've gone
[16:52] too far right now you've left your first
[16:56] love
[16:57] amen praise God
[16:59] so we see that in verse 4 and in verse 5
[17:02] Jesus tells them the following he tells
[17:04] them to remember this is their solution
[17:07] to remember the place that they were at
[17:10] before they fell
[17:13] because look what he says he says
[17:14] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[17:18] Fallen
[17:19] and repent
[17:22] and do the first Works amen so first
[17:25] thing that they had to do was repent
[17:27] forever getting in that condition
[17:31] right and finally
[17:34] well first of all it says Jesus tells
[17:36] him to remember the place that they were
[17:37] at before they fell then repent for ever
[17:40] getting in that condition and finally go
[17:42] back and start over
[17:44] aren't you glad that God allows us to
[17:46] start over
[17:47] that's the grace of God you know
[17:50] nowadays young people and and and and
[17:52] and kids you know when when they play
[17:55] video games and they're so accustomed to
[17:57] hey we could start all over as many
[17:59] times as you want to and just respawn
[18:01] and and then do all that kind of stuff
[18:03] you know and just start restart all over
[18:05] and there's just no endless limits you
[18:07] know
[18:08] but that's how God is for us
[18:11] but at some point in time you're gonna
[18:13] make his patience won't won't always you
[18:17] know at some point in time you're gonna
[18:19] just completely you there's no way of
[18:21] coming back that happened to a woman
[18:23] during brother branham's time
[18:27] there was just no way for her to come
[18:28] back she completely blasphemed
[18:31] and she said she said that I could just
[18:34] see my my mom's Soul frying as a in a
[18:37] frying pan in hell and this didn't
[18:39] even bother her
[18:40] I hope that we never get to a condition
[18:42] like that
[18:43] but you see God is a god of many chances
[18:46] but he's not a god of Eternal chances
[18:48] [Laughter]
[18:50] amen the world would would teach you
[18:53] that that's it's okay you can start over
[18:55] anytime and then and you have unlimited
[18:57] lives
[18:59] but it ain't like that with God
[19:01] it ain't like that with God so there's
[19:03] many lives but not unlimited lives
[19:06] all right
[19:08] so
[19:10] if you read here in verse 5 this is what
[19:12] it says in basic killing in basic
[19:14] English it says so keep in mind where
[19:18] you were at first
[19:19] and be changed in heart
[19:22] and do the first works or I will come to
[19:26] you and will take away your light from
[19:28] its place
[19:29] if your hearts are not changed amen so
[19:34] it was very important amen that God was
[19:36] giving them a chance to repent to do
[19:39] their works first for first works over
[19:42] you remember when you first come to the
[19:44] Lord and and the joy that you felt and
[19:47] and and the satisfaction that you got
[19:50] from the word of God and and then the
[19:52] and I remember when I was 12 years old
[19:54] and I first accepted salvation in my
[19:57] life and I came to the Lord you couldn't
[19:59] put me you you could you couldn't see me
[20:02] putting the word down hardly
[20:04] I was always listening to to ministers
[20:07] preachers listening to to to I didn't
[20:10] know the message back then but I was
[20:12] listening to tapes
[20:13] because I was back in 1992.
[20:17] but it was other preachers you know at
[20:19] the Baptist Church where I was listening
[20:20] and I was 12 years old you know sitting
[20:23] there taking notes on on what they were
[20:24] preaching and teaching it was very
[20:26] important to me my prayer life was just
[20:29] it wasn't it was I mean it was just I
[20:32] was on fire for God
[20:34] how many remember that
[20:36] but how many is no how many remember
[20:38] that it knows that it should be the same
[20:40] way
[20:41] even now
[20:43] yeah you see but sometimes amen
[20:45] something happens along the way that you
[20:48] think you know too much or you think uh
[20:51] well it's all right I don't need to do
[20:52] all that anymore yeah I could take a
[20:54] little break you know I could take you
[20:56] know what when we do that that's when we
[20:58] start fading from our first love
[21:02] we start fading from our first love
[21:07] so you know where where maybe you might
[21:09] be failing amen
[21:11] as the question is asked as as do you
[21:14] really love the word of God the way you
[21:16] should
[21:17] amen do you love the word of God more
[21:20] now than you did this time last year
[21:23] amen or this time two years ago
[21:26] three years ago because if you do it's
[21:29] going to make you change
[21:31] if you do you're going to come to church
[21:33] if you do you're going to be here and
[21:36] you're going to be not just not just for
[21:39] the sake of the preacher he's going to
[21:40] see you or not see you being at church
[21:42] but it's because you want to be in
[21:44] fellowship with your believers who are
[21:46] part of that word that you say you love
[21:49] right
[21:50] you see
[21:52] amen
[21:53] so I'm not I'm not I'm not scolding
[21:55] anybody I'm just saying that's what the
[21:58] word says amen praise God
[22:01] amen
[22:02] now the Ephesian church was
[22:05] characterized by the by their fervent
[22:07] love that that they had for one another
[22:09] that's the reason why Jesus dealt with
[22:11] them in Revelation with with regards to
[22:15] leaving your first love because in
[22:17] Ephesians 1 5 if you read there this is
[22:19] what Paul tells him he said wherefore I
[22:21] also after I heard of your faith in the
[22:24] Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints
[22:29] there were people who loved one another
[22:32] and when you look at the love there that
[22:34] they had for one another it was the love
[22:36] agape
[22:38] which was the same love that Jesus tell
[22:40] them in Revelations that they left
[22:44] it was the agape love that that they
[22:47] loved one another
[22:48] so if you love the word of God correctly
[22:51] amen you're going to love one another
[22:52] right
[22:54] it just it just makes sense you're gonna
[22:57] love God's people and you're gonna love
[22:59] to be in the house of God
[23:01] amen the love that they had for the for
[23:04] the Brethren stemmed from the love they
[23:07] had for Christ who is the word amen
[23:10] and so you see that in Ephesians 6 24
[23:12] Grace this is when Paul was uh was
[23:16] finishing the letter to the Ephesians
[23:17] Ephesians and this is the last verse
[23:19] there it says Grace be with all them
[23:21] that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
[23:24] sincerity
[23:25] amen it must have been that there was
[23:28] people there that were sincere people
[23:30] in Ephesians in Ephesus they loved
[23:34] Christ amen because you can't love the
[23:36] people if you don't love God
[23:38] man hey man you did something that you
[23:42] don't like to be around with or or
[23:44] you're not going to love you're not
[23:46] going to want to to be around them amen
[23:49] so they must have really loved Christ in
[23:52] sincerity
[23:54] but here's the thing you could be so
[23:56] sincere and so and your motives right
[23:59] but if you just fell in one little thing
[24:01] or or or you say that one thing is not
[24:04] as important as the way you thought it
[24:06] was at one point amen that's when you
[24:08] start deviating
[24:10] because it's easy when you do it the
[24:13] first time oh well it was easy then you
[24:16] do it the second time it becomes a
[24:17] little easier the third time it's easier
[24:20] and easier and so on until you finally
[24:21] you're at a point where wait a second
[24:24] last year I was
[24:25] here and then now I'm all the way over
[24:27] here
[24:30] and that's you know it just that's what
[24:32] happens that's what happens and that's
[24:34] what happened to the Church of Ephesus
[24:37] and so as I said as I mentioned earlier
[24:39] you know it took him about a span of
[24:40] about 10 to 30 years for them to get to
[24:43] that point after Paul had visited them
[24:46] their love and Zeal for the word started
[24:48] fading and remember who is the word
[24:52] is Jesus amen
[24:54] I have here in the notes that the way
[24:57] you love and treat your wife is the way
[25:00] you love and treat God
[25:05] so as I'm looking at this here I'm
[25:08] thinking I'm writing these these notes
[25:10] down I'm thinking how am I treating my
[25:12] wife
[25:13] because the way I treat my wife is the
[25:15] way I'm treating God right
[25:17] and now the way you treat and love God
[25:20] and His word is the way that you will
[25:23] treat and love God's people
[25:25] if you don't think it's important to
[25:28] come and hear the word of God then
[25:30] that's how you treat God's people
[25:32] it's not important I could just treat
[25:34] them any old way I could just tell them
[25:36] and talk to them in any old way joke
[25:38] about them and make fun of them any old
[25:40] way because to you it's not important
[25:43] the word of God isn't that important
[25:45] you love and you do the duties of coming
[25:48] to church and you do what you're
[25:50] supposed to do but it's not insincerity
[25:53] because you're not sincere about God's
[25:55] word you can talk to some people and you
[25:58] start talking to them about the word
[26:00] they don't reply to you about the word
[26:02] because they don't know how to
[26:04] they don't know about the word that's a
[26:06] clear evidence right there they're not
[26:07] in the word
[26:09] you start talking to them about Doctrine
[26:11] they don't know how to respond back to
[26:13] you clear evidence that they don't they
[26:15] don't look they don't study the word for
[26:16] themselves they don't read the word
[26:20] so where are we at do you really love
[26:23] the word of God the way you should
[26:26] oh brother Louise this ain't the seals
[26:28] you ain't breaking down that seed you
[26:29] ain't breaking down I'm breaking down
[26:31] things we need
[26:33] because if you don't know how to love
[26:35] your brother and you don't know how to
[26:36] how to come to church and and and and
[26:38] and do these basic things you ain't
[26:41] gonna love the word of God enough to
[26:43] care about the seals and care about the
[26:44] church ages and care about Daniel 70
[26:46] weeks
[26:47] honestly that's that's just that's just
[26:49] the truth yeah
[26:52] Ephesians this is what brother Brown
[26:55] says here I'll just let brother Brennan
[26:57] tell you because yeah that's just
[26:59] brother Luis over there talking no
[27:00] brother Brown says it himself
[27:02] he says a few moments in the church age
[27:04] book he says in a few moments ago I
[27:06] mentioned that John understood what it
[27:08] was to love God
[27:10] that great Apostle of Love would
[27:12] certainly see it when the church began
[27:15] to lose that first love of God
[27:17] in first John 5 3 he says for this is
[27:20] the love of God that we keep his
[27:23] Commandments
[27:26] that's the love of God
[27:28] where are his Commandments in his word
[27:31] so do you really love the word
[27:35] or do you only love it on Wednesdays and
[27:36] Sundays
[27:39] do you have personal time with Jesus in
[27:41] your closet in your study time do you do
[27:44] you have a place in your home where
[27:46] where you study the word
[27:49] or just just let the preacher do all the
[27:52] studying and I'll just get Wednesday and
[27:54] Sunday
[27:55] but
[27:58] for this is the love of God that we keep
[28:01] his Commandments one little deviation
[28:03] from that word was a step away from
[28:05] Christ
[28:06] what happened to the Ephesians Church
[28:09] they lost their first love so that's the
[28:11] must of mean that they deviated some way
[28:14] or another
[28:16] people say they love God they go to
[28:18] church they even shout and rejoice and
[28:21] sing and have a great emotional time
[28:25] just as we had here a few weeks ago
[28:28] but when it's all over watch and see if
[28:31] they are in that word walking in it
[28:33] living in it
[28:37] there are those people that that were
[28:39] here a few weeks ago rejoicing in the in
[28:41] the in the word where are they at
[28:43] tonight
[28:45] excuses excuses
[28:49] living if they go through all the other
[28:51] and then don't walk in that word they
[28:53] can say they love God but their lives
[28:55] tell another story
[28:58] I wonder if John didn't see a lot of
[29:00] that before he died people saying they
[29:02] loved God but not obeying his word
[29:06] amen
[29:08] you you take that for what is worse I'm
[29:11] not just saying it about coming to
[29:13] church but where are we failing God the
[29:15] most is it in prayer
[29:18] is it in backbiting your brother and
[29:20] sister
[29:21] is it talking about the preacher because
[29:25] he don't tickle our ears the way we like
[29:27] it
[29:28] all right is it what is it in your life
[29:33] that is hindering this church from
[29:35] moving forward with God
[29:37] right right because I believe the church
[29:40] is marching
[29:41] and I know it's an individual walk
[29:44] right but amen it's all it's also amen
[29:46] we can't move forward if we're not if we
[29:48] don't love the word of God the way we
[29:50] should we're definitely not going to
[29:52] love it one another the way we should
[29:53] amen
[29:56] praise God
[29:57] so here's the question how how do you
[29:59] love the word of God
[30:02] do you love the word of God in agape
[30:03] love
[30:06] or do you love the word of God in a
[30:07] Philly of love
[30:09] how do you love God
[30:12] amen we all know these definitions but
[30:15] in agape love Agape Love Is that love of
[30:18] God is the way he loves us his children
[30:21] amen
[30:22] and it's the love that he gives us amen
[30:25] when we receive the Holy Ghost love that
[30:27] is affection or benevolence uh a love
[30:30] feast
[30:31] Thayer's definition tells us affection
[30:33] good will love benevolence brotherly
[30:36] love love love feasts I was looking at
[30:38] what these love feasts are amen a love
[30:41] feast
[30:42] you know back in the 70s they had love
[30:45] feasts in the 60s they had love fees but
[30:48] in a different way
[30:50] this definitely wasn't Christian but
[30:52] they thought it was just the the the the
[30:54] just the best of the best
[30:57] drugs and all kinds of stuff
[30:59] but love feast in the when the Bible
[31:01] talks about love feasts it says a love
[31:04] feast or Agape Feast they would call it
[31:07] as well was a fellowship meal eaten by
[31:10] Christians in the early church
[31:12] there is a Biblical evidence for the
[31:14] practice of these communal meals during
[31:17] which Christians gathered not just for
[31:19] the sake of sustenance and socializing
[31:22] but for the sake of Fellowship
[31:25] amen so that's the reason why it is
[31:27] called love feasts there's other
[31:29] scriptures where in the New Testament
[31:31] where that two words love feasts is is
[31:34] mentioned
[31:36] so it's Christians Gathering Together
[31:38] amen it's not well I'm just going to
[31:41] church and just get the word of God and
[31:43] then I'll and then I'm out
[31:44] hey man you need one another we need
[31:48] each other amen
[31:51] during a Time amen when things are going
[31:53] to get rougher and and squeeze squeeze
[31:57] uh Upon Us hey man we're we're not gonna
[31:59] we're gonna need one another more than
[32:01] ever
[32:02] yeah so let's start practicing now
[32:05] amen
[32:06] let's start practicing it now
[32:09] Christians Gathering not just for the
[32:11] sake of sustenance and socializing but
[32:14] for the sake of Fellowship do you love
[32:16] God that way
[32:17] or do you love him and feel your love
[32:21] see filial love is just only to approve
[32:23] of to like
[32:25] the sanction to treat affection you're
[32:27] kindly to welcome befriend
[32:29] to show signs of love
[32:32] only to show signs of love
[32:36] pretend maybe like you love somebody
[32:38] or pretend like maybe you want to shake
[32:41] someone's hand but in reality that's not
[32:43] in your heart
[32:45] something is wrong then
[32:47] something is wrong you don't have God
[32:49] inside of you because you don't love
[32:51] your brother the way you should or your
[32:53] sister amen
[32:57] my brother Bram says in the message the
[32:59] ever-present water from The Rock
[33:01] and I'm I'm not going to hold you all
[33:04] too long tonight he says here now in the
[33:06] modern day it would be oh every
[33:08] Wednesday night prayer meeting every
[33:10] Sunday morning back to the back to the
[33:12] church what do we hear the same thing
[33:15] the preachers stand up and preach songs
[33:17] go on back see then you're just going as
[33:20] a line of duty
[33:23] you're not a worshiper
[33:26] hmm
[33:28] I didn't say he said it
[33:30] a worshiper goes there to worship
[33:34] to express himself before his God to
[33:38] praise God for his goodness to every
[33:41] word he hangs on to it
[33:43] amen that's a true worshiper you know in
[33:47] the age that we're living in Saints we
[33:49] we we have used uh streaming services
[33:53] and watching church on T online as an
[33:58] excuse to not go to church anymore
[34:01] I'm just gonna say the people that
[34:03] listen to tape stay home and listen to
[34:05] tapes
[34:07] that's an excuse for them to just not
[34:09] even go to church
[34:12] when brother Branham flatly condemns
[34:15] that yeah
[34:16] but you see here's the problem with
[34:18] streaming services the problem with that
[34:21] is is that or or re-watching services
[34:23] that that you have you know that have
[34:26] already passed
[34:28] you if the preacher if next Sunday
[34:31] someone's listening to what I'm
[34:33] preaching right now and they don't like
[34:34] what I'm saying they could just go ahead
[34:35] and forward 10 seconds Ford or rewind 10
[34:38] 15 20 seconds uh I don't want to hear
[34:41] that part okay I'm gonna get this thank
[34:43] you you can pick and choose what you
[34:45] want to hear but in love preaching you
[34:48] gotta hear what I'm telling you right
[34:50] the only way you're not going to hear it
[34:52] is if you just walk out these doors
[34:54] which some people have done and they
[34:57] don't ever come back
[35:01] but so that is the problem with with
[35:03] people streaming services or re-watching
[35:06] replays it's all right if you watch a
[35:08] replay of a service but you've been at
[35:09] church
[35:10] [Laughter]
[35:12] you see there's people that do that as
[35:14] substitutions to go into church and it's
[35:18] wrong
[35:20] because you can pick and choose whatever
[35:22] you want to hear I don't like what he's
[35:24] saying now
[35:25] so let me just fast forward scrub about
[35:28] 30 seconds all right he's talking
[35:30] something I like now oh he's getting in
[35:33] them seals now
[35:35] you know what the seals amen will cause
[35:38] you to do this yeah yeah we'll cause you
[35:40] to come to church
[35:42] right the seals is not just head
[35:44] knowledge amen the seals will cause you
[35:47] to actually live the seals
[35:49] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[35:52] amen praise the Lord Jesus
[35:55] Just Like A Love Affair if you was going
[35:57] with a girl because you knew it was a
[36:00] Duty or you gone with a a boy when you
[36:03] were young in other words a a young man
[36:05] who was dating or talking to a girl or a
[36:07] girl talking to a boy if it's just a
[36:10] duty for them look what brother Baron
[36:11] says here mama wants me to go with this
[36:14] guy but I just can't stand him you don't
[36:17] get nothing of him coming to see you
[36:20] when he comes and visits you you're not
[36:23] going to get anything because you feel
[36:24] forced to talk to this guy like it was a
[36:27] rearranged marriage you know like they
[36:29] do some some places in India and maybe
[36:31] in the Middle East
[36:33] okay
[36:34] or if Ori or if it's the girl or I'm
[36:38] sorry or if or if it's the same way
[36:40] about the girl to the boy or a boy to
[36:43] the girl you go with her she bores you
[36:47] see it bores you
[36:51] now think about this in the context of
[36:54] church
[36:56] this is what brands talk about mama
[36:59] wants you to go with her because she is
[37:01] the type of girl that mama likes
[37:05] I saw some some kids say man they come
[37:08] to church this is how they feel
[37:10] and you see it all in their face you see
[37:12] it you see it and you know that there's
[37:14] no relationship there they feel forced
[37:16] they feel as if I gotta come because
[37:20] otherwise I'm gonna be grounded for a
[37:22] week or so
[37:23] and in reality that's no relationship
[37:25] there with God
[37:26] there is no relationship there
[37:29] you go with her she bores you mama wants
[37:32] you to go with her because she's the
[37:33] type of girl that mama likes see it
[37:35] bores you no love affair
[37:37] but you don't care you don't want to
[37:39] clean up you don't want to go see her
[37:41] and it's why it's a horrible thing and
[37:43] when he is coming to see you my you just
[37:46] wish he would hurry on and go home
[37:50] so
[37:52] how do you feel that way when you come
[37:53] to church
[37:55] now look what brother Brown continues to
[37:57] say here
[37:58] that's the same way it is when when you
[38:01] why does he preach so long some people
[38:03] ask
[38:04] preacher just preached me too long
[38:09] why does he preach so long what about
[38:11] all this stuff and everything see you're
[38:14] not in love
[38:15] I didn't say it brother Brian I'm saying
[38:17] it
[38:18] you are not in love but when you really
[38:21] hang on to every word as the spirit gave
[38:24] you warning this morning see hanging on
[38:27] to every word yeah
[38:29] that might that might be what he has
[38:31] been talking to you about holding on its
[38:34] eternal life every word of God it's a
[38:36] joy to go to church
[38:38] come on man
[38:40] it's a joy brother Brandon says
[38:43] to those who are still hanging on their
[38:45] first love
[38:47] their first experience
[38:49] well I'm waiting for Brother so-and-so
[38:51] to come through the church and preach us
[38:52] happy amen you've got to be happy all
[38:56] the way
[38:57] brother so-and-so ain't gonna be hairy
[38:59] Sunday
[39:00] what about Jesus Christ being here
[39:04] he makes me happy Wherever I Go amen the
[39:08] joy of the Lord is my strength not just
[39:11] when brother so-and-so comes through
[39:13] amen but when God is here amen that's
[39:16] what makes me happy when his people are
[39:19] here and we're worshiping in one Accord
[39:21] Hallelujah
[39:24] that might be what he has been talking
[39:25] to you about holding on his eternal life
[39:27] every word of God it's a joy to go to
[39:30] church under any circumstance
[39:36] whether it's hot cold and different
[39:38] whether the people are fussing growling
[39:41] whatever they are doing it's still a joy
[39:44] to hear the word of the Lord
[39:47] then you're in love then with Christ
[39:51] that's that's and then let's take it
[39:54] back remember to the Ephesians Church
[39:55] age losing their first love
[39:58] then you're in love then with Christ see
[40:00] you love to go to church
[40:04] well honey here it's Sunday morning
[40:06] again I guess we have to wash up the
[40:09] youngins and get down there Maya it's
[40:11] boursome see you're not in love
[40:16] brother Brown said
[40:18] is that how you feel about coming to
[40:20] church on Sunday
[40:21] is that how you feel about coming to
[40:23] church on a Wednesday
[40:25] it's a drag
[40:27] oh we just gotta do it you know
[40:30] but if you are really in love you just
[40:33] can't wait till Sunday Morning Comes
[40:35] you've just got to get down there with
[40:38] them
[40:38] and we get and to leave the people of
[40:41] God they don't bore you why they are
[40:43] brothers and sisters amen praise God
[40:48] hey Ya
[40:50] it's it's
[40:52] part of a Christian's not just a duty
[40:56] amen but it's a love affair
[40:59] it's what he wants to do it's what she
[41:01] wants to do
[41:02] amen
[41:05] so
[41:07] in the way that we treat the word of God
[41:09] again the question is do you really love
[41:12] the word of God the way you should
[41:14] because if you do it will reflect on
[41:17] these other areas in your life
[41:19] all right now how important it was for
[41:23] the Lord that even when kings would sit
[41:26] before there was ever Kings set up in
[41:28] Israel this is what this is what God
[41:31] would make them do before they actually
[41:33] sat there on the throne
[41:36] all right can remember so I put in there
[41:39] we are Kings and Priests right right God
[41:42] has made us Kings and Priests in
[41:44] Deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 18. it says
[41:48] and it shall be talking about the king
[41:50] and it shall be when he sitteth upon the
[41:52] throne of his kingdom
[41:54] that he shall write him himself a copy
[41:59] of this law in a book
[42:01] out of that which is before the priests
[42:04] the Levites
[42:06] you know there is there is
[42:08] scientifically proven that when you take
[42:10] something and you write it or you copy
[42:12] it down or you're writing it yourself it
[42:14] sticks to you more
[42:16] it sticks to you more
[42:18] when you actually literally write it
[42:20] down
[42:21] now they've kind of perverted it
[42:22] nowadays because this is how they want
[42:24] us to write it down nowadays
[42:26] and this doesn't stick as good
[42:29] it gets lost eventually
[42:31] and and and it's not the same as you
[42:34] actually writing stuff down
[42:37] right and that's why I I if I'm taking
[42:39] notes I usually try to have a little
[42:42] notepad or or or an actual pen or pencil
[42:45] to take notes with because it helps you
[42:47] remember things now well that God knew
[42:49] that
[42:50] and so he knew that that the king amen
[42:53] that he needed to write himself a copy
[42:56] of this law in the book and watch what
[42:57] verse 19 says and it shall be with him
[42:59] and he shall read therein
[43:02] just on Wednesdays and Sundays
[43:07] just when he's feeling good
[43:10] just when his wife made him his Queen
[43:13] made him his coffee exactly the way he
[43:15] likes it
[43:21] and he shall read there in all the days
[43:24] of his life
[43:26] amen the king
[43:28] are you a king and priest
[43:31] that he may learn Watch What Happens
[43:33] that he may learn to fear the lord his
[43:36] God
[43:37] to keep all the words of this law and
[43:41] these statutes to do them
[43:46] and watch what it continues to say
[43:48] that his heart be not lifted up
[43:51] above his brethren
[43:54] in other words that he doesn't think
[43:56] himself better than his brethren
[43:59] this is what happens when you read the
[44:00] word of God and you're you're you're
[44:01] you're in the word of God
[44:04] you will not think yourself better than
[44:07] someone else
[44:08] amen
[44:11] you will try to maintain a level with
[44:14] your brother and your sister
[44:16] amen
[44:18] above is right and that he turned not
[44:20] aside from the Commandment to the right
[44:22] hand or to the left to the end that he
[44:25] may Pro watch that he may prolong his
[44:27] days in his kingdom
[44:29] he and his children
[44:31] in the midst of Israel
[44:36] so God didn't tell the king amen the
[44:38] first that the when he became a king as
[44:41] soon as he sat down on the throne amen
[44:43] he was going to put up his feet amen and
[44:45] get on his iPad
[44:47] and watch Netflix or do whatever that's
[44:49] easy street now let I got all my
[44:52] servants no
[44:53] he was he's got to put him he put him to
[44:55] work and the first thing he needed to do
[44:57] was get in that word and write that word
[45:00] down
[45:01] amen that was what that was what God
[45:04] required
[45:05] praise the Lord Jesus
[45:08] so it's a duty for you and I Saints it's
[45:11] it and again it's not just a duty it
[45:13] should be a desire
[45:15] for us to be in the word of God
[45:18] Saints
[45:20] all the books in in this in this world
[45:23] can burn everything in this life can go
[45:26] away amen but if the word of God Amen
[45:28] has fully grabbed your life the way you
[45:30] should
[45:31] amen and if you're if it's if it's that
[45:34] interesting to you the whole world
[45:36] around you can fall amen but that word
[45:38] will always keep you Joy with joy
[45:42] amen everything around you can fall
[45:44] problems will occur and all kinds of
[45:47] things but that word of God will always
[45:49] be in your Forefront
[45:51] praise God
[45:53] I want us to look at the at David and
[45:56] King David King David see King David
[45:59] took took uh uh uh
[46:05] that to to uh it was it was very
[46:07] important for him what we just read
[46:09] there in Deuteronomy because look what
[46:11] he says in Psalms 1 he says blessed is
[46:13] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[46:15] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[46:18] of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[46:20] the scornful but but his Delight is in
[46:24] the law of the Lord
[46:25] and in his law does he meditate
[46:28] day and night
[46:30] and he was a king
[46:32] and he knew what the law said
[46:35] that's the reason why he said what he
[46:37] penned what he just penned day and night
[46:41] amen that's what the that's what Kings
[46:43] and Priests do
[46:46] Psalms chapter 19 verse 7 11.

[47:42] righteous out together every time I read
[47:44] these verses it takes me back to to I
[47:47] want to sing them

[47:51] back in the early 90s it was an acapella
[47:53] group that that sang this this these
[47:56] these verses and every time I I I read
[47:59] them I just want to see the fear of the
[48:02] Lord is clean

[48:42] it sure is
[48:44] but you see the word of God is better
[48:46] than than fine gold
[48:49] David says here
[48:51] sweeter also than honey and the Honey on
[48:53] the honeycomb you know as I was looking
[48:56] into this and I was reading looking uh
[48:59] not sure how how how how true it is but
[49:02] I was reading or listening to something
[49:04] and they said that the way the children
[49:06] used to go back to school and the way
[49:08] they would write they would they would
[49:10] pen they would have these tablets that
[49:12] they would make notes on and the tablets
[49:14] were made out of Wax
[49:16] and uh they would have like a some sort
[49:19] of writing utensil but in other in other
[49:21] for them to be able to to I I guess for
[49:24] for them to be able to write in a
[49:27] smoother way they would kind of layer
[49:28] the wax a little bit with honey
[49:31] and so as as as they were writing inside
[49:35] the tablet they would write and then it
[49:38] would kind of have the distilled them
[49:40] with a little bit of Honey the pen and
[49:42] so as they were right they were kind of
[49:44] just lick lick
[49:46] and write and and kind of get a little
[49:49] bit of that honey as they were riding
[49:51] amen
[49:52] God says that the word of God is sweeter
[49:55] than that honey
[49:57] what was written amen the written word
[50:00] is sweeter than all the honey what's
[50:02] sweeter than honey
[50:03] I don't know
[50:05] honey is very sweet but you can only
[50:07] just have a little bit and afterwards
[50:09] hey man it just don't taste too good if
[50:11] you get too much
[50:13] amen but that's how the word of God is
[50:15] it's sweeter also than honey
[50:18] and the honeycomb the fresh honey that's
[50:21] dripping off of the honeycomb the word
[50:23] of God is sweeter than that
[50:25] praise the Lord
[50:27] amen moreover by them by what by that
[50:31] word is thy servant warned
[50:33] and in keeping of them there is great
[50:36] reward
[50:37] praise the Lord Jesus
[50:40] there's not just hearing him amen but in
[50:42] keeping them there's a great reward
[50:44] praise the Lord
[50:46] Charles Spurgeon said the following he
[50:48] said if God shall give you a promise you
[50:50] will taste it like a wafer of honey and
[50:53] feed on it
[50:55] and if he shall give you a precept you
[50:57] will not stop to look at it and say Lord
[51:00] I don't like this as well as the promise
[51:02] but you will receive that and feed upon
[51:05] that also
[51:07] amen and when the Lord shall be pleased
[51:09] afterwards to give you some Revelation
[51:11] with regard to your inward experience or
[51:14] to your fellowship with his dear son you
[51:16] welcome it with joy because you love any
[51:19] truth and every truth as long as you
[51:22] know it to be the truth of God's Own
[51:24] word
[51:25] amen it doesn't matter who's preaching
[51:28] it it doesn't matter who who's behind
[51:30] the pulpit amen you love the truth
[51:32] because the truth is is being preached
[51:34] amen it is a blessed sign of Grace in
[51:37] the heart when God's words are sweet to
[51:40] us
[51:40] as a whole
[51:43] it is a blessed sign of Grace in the
[51:45] heart when God's words are sweet to us
[51:48] as a whole when we love the truth of God
[51:51] not cast it not cast into a system or a
[51:54] shape but as we find in God's word amen
[51:59] praise God
[52:01] now in Psalms 119 David continues the
[52:04] following and he says this wherewithal
[52:07] shall a young man cleanse his way
[52:09] by taking heed there to according to Thy
[52:13] Word
[52:14] amen you want to clean your way young
[52:16] man young lady
[52:17] amen get in the word
[52:21] you you want help in your life get in
[52:23] the word
[52:25] you want eternal life get in the word
[52:27] you want healing amen you want positive
[52:29] thoughts get in the word
[52:31] amen it all comes and stems from the
[52:33] word
[52:34] with my whole heart David says have I
[52:37] sought thee
[52:39] oh let me not Wander from thy
[52:41] Commandments
[52:43] amen you see how it is that's what the
[52:46] Ephesian Church did at the beginning
[52:48] they wandered from the Commandments of
[52:50] God
[52:51] but here David is saying Lord don't let
[52:54] me wonder from thy Commandments Thy word
[52:55] have I hid in Mine Heart
[52:58] that I might not sin against thee
[53:01] amen
[53:03] so when you hear the word of God it's
[53:05] not just about just listening to it at
[53:07] the moment and forget what you heard
[53:08] amen but keep it and retain
[53:11] as much of it as you can amen and go on
[53:13] move forward so that why so that you
[53:16] won't so that you won't sin against God
[53:18] blessed art thou Lord teach me thy
[53:20] statutes with my lips have I declared
[53:23] all the judgments of thy mouth
[53:26] amen so it should be in your lips as
[53:29] well I have rejoiced in the way of thy
[53:31] testimonies as much as in all riches
[53:36] amen
[53:38] praise God
[53:40] you know
[53:42] I wonder how we would act amen if
[53:44] somebody over here and came through here

[53:50] and you're going to have an extra
[53:52] hundred thousand dollars in your bank
[53:54] and I mean you knew for a fact that's
[53:56] what was going to happen

[54:19] that's what God that's what it was
[54:22] promised to you
[54:24] got your name on it
[54:25] everything
[54:29] but but David says here that I rejoiced
[54:32] in the way of thy testimonies as much as
[54:35] in all riches
[54:38] in other words David had riches
[54:42] David had wives and he had he had things
[54:46] in his life that he could Rejoice about
[54:48] but he said the law of the Lord the word
[54:51] of God was much better than all that
[54:55] amen
[54:58] I will meditate in thy precepts verse 15
[55:00] and what and have respect unto thy ways

[59:23] start falling in love amen this is this
[59:26] is where you take action now all right
[59:29] if you feel like you've lost your first
[59:31] love if you feel like it's a dread to
[59:33] come to church if you feel like the
[59:35] Brethren around you just just get on
[59:37] your nerves and the sisters around you
[59:39] just get on your nerves
[59:41] then this is a way to start it's all it
[59:45] all starts with the word of God
[59:47] get in the word and you won't feel like
[59:49] that about your brother get in the word
[59:50] and you won't feel like that about your
[59:52] sister and you won't feel like that
[59:54] about your preacher
[1:00:00] all right first one read your Bible
[1:00:03] every day
[1:00:06] now brother Brown said that
[1:00:08] the local second Timothy 2 15 says study
[1:00:11] to show thyself approved
[1:00:13] unto God
[1:00:15] amen don't do it for others do it unto
[1:00:18] God
[1:00:19] a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[1:00:22] rightly dividing the word of truth
[1:00:24] that's what I'm trying to say earlier
[1:00:25] you talk to some people and you know
[1:00:27] they have been in the word of God
[1:00:31] you can just tell by
[1:00:33] the way they talk to you or the lack of
[1:00:37] talking to you about the word of God
[1:00:38] they'll talk to you about anything else
[1:00:40] but they won't talk to you about the
[1:00:41] word
[1:00:44] because they don't want to know that
[1:00:46] they haven't been in the word
[1:00:48] but out of the abundance of the heart
[1:00:50] speak at the mouth Jesus said right
[1:00:55] all right tip number two meditate on
[1:00:57] what you have read
[1:00:59] don't just read the word
[1:01:01] don't just read the word and say I've
[1:01:03] done my duty I've read ten verses for
[1:01:05] today
[1:01:06] no
[1:01:08] now start looking and meditating about
[1:01:10] what you just read about
[1:01:12] it maybe get into it maybe start looking
[1:01:14] at the definition of a certain word that
[1:01:17] you just read that that just kind of
[1:01:18] caught your attention
[1:01:20] maybe and you and you will find out that
[1:01:22] you start doing that and it will start
[1:01:24] it's just like a I mean you start going
[1:01:26] down and next thing you know it's been
[1:01:27] 30 minutes wow I've been reading the
[1:01:29] word of God for 30 minutes
[1:01:32] Brother John
[1:01:35] when initially you said I'm only gonna
[1:01:37] do five ten minutes
[1:01:39] I've been on here 30 minutes studying
[1:01:41] the word of God that's how it is that's
[1:01:43] how it starts look what Joshua 1 8 says
[1:01:46] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:01:48] out of thy mouth
[1:01:50] but Thou shalt meditate therein
[1:01:53] Wednesday and Sunday that thou May no
[1:01:56] doesn't say that right
[1:01:58] that they're in day and night that thou
[1:02:00] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:02:03] that is written therein how many times
[1:02:06] have we read something similar tonight
[1:02:08] like that
[1:02:09] right the King was supposed to do that
[1:02:12] remember the king in Deuteronomy David
[1:02:15] mentioned it in Psalms
[1:02:17] to do according to all that is written
[1:02:19] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:02:22] prosperous and then Thou shalt have
[1:02:25] good success
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:28] tip number three
[1:02:30] ask the Holy Spirit to teach you what he
[1:02:33] wants you to learn
[1:02:35] or in other words give you revelation
[1:02:39] I have the habit of when I read the word
[1:02:41] of God I always pray I say Lord reveal
[1:02:44] to me what I'm about to read
[1:02:47] help me to just grab something from
[1:02:49] there that I can just go instantly apply
[1:02:52] into my life
[1:02:54] so just pick up the word and and just
[1:02:57] just randomly and just start reading hey
[1:03:00] man that's good
[1:03:01] that's a good start you picked up the
[1:03:04] word and started reading but pray about
[1:03:06] what you're about to read
[1:03:08] and I believe God Honors that many times
[1:03:11] that that I've done that uh God always
[1:03:15] never fails to show me something
[1:03:17] never never
[1:03:19] amen so ask God for Revelation amen
[1:03:22] the holy spirit will teach you because
[1:03:24] what did he say he said he will lead us
[1:03:26] and guide us unto all truth right
[1:03:29] all right John 14 26 says but the
[1:03:31] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:03:33] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:03:34] teach you all things and bring all
[1:03:37] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:03:41] have said unto you that's what that was
[1:03:42] Jesus speaking
[1:03:44] is another thing that you can do you can
[1:03:47] pray the scriptures
[1:03:48] hey man I'm not into into the habit of
[1:03:52] doing that but I I'd like to I'd like to
[1:03:54] start doing that because there's an
[1:03:55] anointing that comes with that
[1:03:57] praying the scriptures over over your
[1:04:00] family praying the scriptures over over
[1:04:02] yourself over situations amen and if you
[1:04:06] don't know amen go back in the Psalms
[1:04:09] and there's plenty of content there for
[1:04:10] you to pray about
[1:04:12] right that you can some way or another
[1:04:14] apply that content that that word to
[1:04:17] your your situation Psalms 119 13 says
[1:04:21] with my lips have I declared all the
[1:04:24] judgments of thy mouth
[1:04:26] so pray the the the judgments of God or
[1:04:30] or the word of God Amen and Proclaim it
[1:04:32] with thy mouth amen
[1:04:34] there is one place in Psalms 119 amen
[1:04:37] where where he says that I will raise my
[1:04:39] hands unto thy Commandments
[1:04:43] I will raise my hands unto Thy Word
[1:04:46] hence the reason why we raise and say
[1:04:48] Amen to the word of God as it's going
[1:04:50] forward
[1:04:51] and we just don't sit there
[1:04:54] but David said to do that amen
[1:04:57] amen
[1:05:02] all right
[1:05:10] and then tip number five
[1:05:13] thank the Lord for his words
[1:05:16] amen be always thankful second Peter 1 4
[1:05:19] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:05:21] great and precious promises
[1:05:24] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:05:27] the divine nature
[1:05:29] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:05:32] the word through lust
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] thank God for his word
[1:05:38] be thankful always and how do we thank
[1:05:41] God for his word
[1:05:43] amen we just express it with our lips
[1:05:45] but we also express it with our actions
[1:05:49] we obey the word of God Amen
[1:05:51] praise the Lord Jesus and so you could
[1:05:54] take those five tips with you
[1:05:57] and hopefully you can start applying
[1:05:59] them tonight
[1:06:00] when you get home
[1:06:02] put them to action
[1:06:05] it was only just five
[1:06:08] I didn't give you a whole book it's just
[1:06:11] five
[1:06:13] now I I want to finish with with with
[1:06:15] the example of Mary and and Martha
[1:06:20] and just how how beautiful it was
[1:06:23] when Jesus came in in in Lazarus home
[1:06:28] and Mary was there uh Martha was there
[1:06:32] and Jesus started speaking the word
[1:06:35] talking about the word and Mary wasn't
[1:06:37] concerned about anything else but to be
[1:06:39] at the feet of that word
[1:06:43] she didn't care about that the dishes
[1:06:46] needed to be done she didn't care that
[1:06:47] it was cold it was there it was cold hot
[1:06:50] outside or whatever amen what she cared
[1:06:53] about was to be at the feet of that word
[1:06:55] because she knew that that moment could
[1:06:57] it was going to go away at some point
[1:06:59] she was going to take full advantage of
[1:07:01] that word
[1:07:02] now though Jesus Christ be in the word
[1:07:05] himself amen he is the word praise God
[1:07:07] he is the the physical word was right
[1:07:10] there but she was interested in he in
[1:07:12] hearing what he had to say
[1:07:14] while Martha was over there slaving away
[1:07:17] and doing everything she needed to do
[1:07:18] maybe she was preparing for the church
[1:07:20] dinner or whatever you know that we
[1:07:23] could get so busy with church things and
[1:07:25] we forget that Jesus is speaking
[1:07:29] you can be so busy with church
[1:07:32] and you and you missing out Church
[1:07:36] that's right that's what Martha was
[1:07:38] doing
[1:07:39] she knew Jesus was there she knew that
[1:07:42] that that that that she was at her home
[1:07:44] she she wanted to serve him too but she
[1:07:48] was wanting to serve him in a physical
[1:07:50] way while Mar while Mary was trying to
[1:07:53] serve Jesus in a spiritual way but
[1:07:56] saying I need something for my soul
[1:07:58] and I can only receive it from him
[1:08:01] so she was attentive and Martha got onto
[1:08:04] her
[1:08:05] Martha actually got on to Jesus
[1:08:07] Martha rebuked Jesus for what Mary was
[1:08:10] doing
[1:08:12] and said why don't you tell her to come
[1:08:15] in here and help me
[1:08:16] bake these cookies and whatever
[1:08:22] and Mary said Martha Martha
[1:08:24] you're too worried about Subway
[1:08:29] you're too worried about Taco Bell
[1:08:31] you're too worried about all that stuff
[1:08:33] you know
[1:08:35] why don't you just come down here and
[1:08:36] worship me
[1:08:39] and you're worshiping Me by listening to
[1:08:41] what I have to tell you
[1:08:43] remember who is the true worshiper
[1:08:46] true worshiper is the one who continues
[1:08:49] daily in the word
[1:08:52] amen that is the true worshiper
[1:08:54] if I wanted to leave you with that
[1:08:56] thought look at Mary and Mary did that
[1:08:58] without the Holy Ghost
[1:09:01] what about you and I with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:03] what kind of attitude should we have
[1:09:05] towards the word
[1:09:08] it should actually be more
[1:09:10] sweeter
[1:09:12] and and and it should have more effect
[1:09:15] on us amen than than ever before
[1:09:17] it doesn't matter what happens in our
[1:09:21] life the word always goes first
[1:09:24] amen no my mom does no the word goes
[1:09:28] first no my dad does no the word goes
[1:09:30] first
[1:09:31] no no my pastor does the word always
[1:09:33] goes first
[1:09:35] amen and when you do that God will take
[1:09:37] care of your pastor God will take care
[1:09:39] of your mom God will take care of your
[1:09:41] dad God would take care of everybody
[1:09:42] every family member when you put God
[1:09:46] first in your life

[1:09:49] so may God bless you all listen to our
[1:09:51] feet

[1:10:33] we feel like we're not enough in the
[1:10:35] word
[1:10:36] Amen brother Branham he felt like like
[1:10:40] he was 50 something years old and he
[1:10:41] felt like he hadn't done anything for
[1:10:43] God
[1:10:46] how much how much more us look at he had
[1:10:48] traveled all over the world preaching
[1:10:50] the gospel thousands maybe millions of
[1:10:54] people saved under his ministry up to
[1:10:56] that point and he felt like he didn't do
[1:10:58] anything
