[0:01] all right
[0:03] let's uh
[0:05] let's let's go and get started
[0:08] all right good to have everybody here
[0:10] we're all hooked up
[0:12] on the internet I want good stuff
[0:17] oh by the way we're going to have the
[0:20] ministers meeting in January here and uh
[0:24] the reason I'm telling you this is
[0:26] because
[0:27] uh we're gonna have two preachers that
[0:29] are going to be doing the meeting
[0:32] Richard Robertson
[0:36] Joseph Kansas
[0:38] yeah we're going to have a a lot of the
[0:42] ministers have been have have had
[0:44] problems with people on the internet
[0:48] and so daddy said well we got two of the
[0:50] best
[0:52] you know I want to learn something
[0:53] so that's what we're gonna do in January
[0:55] we're gonna have all the managers
[0:56] they're going to speak to them about how
[0:58] to control the internet and how to use
[1:00] it right
[1:01] and how to set things up so
[1:04] it'd be pretty interesting because we
[1:06] there's still several preachers my
[1:07] brother Tim Humes he don't have anything
[1:09] in no internet service or anything like
[1:11] that and he doesn't like it so
[1:14] anyway so Joseph and Richard are gonna
[1:18] are going to teach them how to use it
[1:21] you know what bothers me on our way it's
[1:23] not our website
[1:25] screen that comes
[1:27] that comfortable mine that's at the top
[1:28] our church is at the top or like the
[1:30] bottom Grand and false prophet have you
[1:34] seen that on the very same screen that
[1:36] our church is
[1:38] not on our website
[1:46] nurse
[1:50] the only Jesus we only need Jesus in
[1:53] other words we don't need a prophet
[1:54] right and it's discouraging yes
[1:57] yeah you can't help what other people
[1:59] put on
[2:02] all right Isaiah 53 that's what we're
[2:04] going to talk about
[2:06] Jesus this morning
[2:08] for those of you that have not been here
[2:11] long
[2:13] we are taking
[2:17] a view of God
[2:20] in His Son of God dispensation and it's
[2:23] a man dispensation and showing the
[2:25] differences and the
[2:28] similarities because I was thinking just
[2:31] a little while ago that we're not trying
[2:33] to divide this person into two
[2:36] all right
[2:37] this person is almighty God before the
[2:39] foundation of the world he does not
[2:40] change he's Hebrews 13 8. he's John 1 1.
[2:44] he's Hebrews one he's Colossians 1 and
[2:47] he's the one in the first of the book
[2:49] that says in the beginning God created
[2:51] the Heavenly Earth so if anybody picks
[2:52] us up on the Internet we are not
[2:54] advocating or promoting
[2:57] two different gods
[2:59] now for an example
[3:02] just I failed to put this on there maybe
[3:04] somebody May click on and see it but or
[3:07] hear it but
[3:09] today you look at me
[3:12] I'm one person
[3:14] all right but my title
[3:18] is
[3:19] Sun
[3:21] because I'm the son of my father right
[3:23] but you're still looking at the same
[3:24] person that's right
[3:26] all right I'm a husband
[3:29] that's a manifestation that I
[3:32] came about because of a revelation of
[3:35] having a wife right okay
[3:39] I could always be one
[3:42] I have the capability of always being a
[3:44] husband whether I'm married or not but
[3:46] the revelation of Me shows that I'm
[3:48] married because the manifestation of my
[3:50] wife all right
[3:52] I'm also a human being I have a body
[3:54] spirit and soul I was lost
[3:57] I was in sin see now God wasn't
[3:59] but we're still looking at one person
[4:01] not a not a and not as some of the
[4:05] people in the message preach that Jesus
[4:07] had different identities
[4:09] uh that's a schizophrenic right God's
[4:12] not as schizophrenic
[4:14] God is one right but he has many
[4:17] manifestations just like I'm standing
[4:18] here I have not moved I'm also a
[4:21] grandfather
[4:22] now my my features haven't changed
[4:25] now if I was eternal and Almighty and
[4:28] was standing here in my youth and never
[4:30] getting older I still could be a
[4:31] grandfather because that's what's inside
[4:33] of me to be a grandfather you understand
[4:35] what I'm saying yes and I can I can
[4:39] manifest that why because in a few
[4:41] moments my granddaughter is going to
[4:43] walk in and she's going to manifest me
[4:45] or show the manifestation of me being a
[4:47] grandfather
[4:49] um same way with my children
[4:51] father
[4:53] son husband human being
[4:57] um
[4:58] you know Deer Hunter
[5:01] um you know I mean whatever preacher or
[5:04] teacher
[5:05] Sunday school flop you know what I mean
[5:07] you know whatever I'm manifesting all
[5:11] these things even as a human being
[5:13] but I haven't moved I'm still standing
[5:16] in the same form I'm in I haven't
[5:18] changed and went over to another person
[5:19] or I have not brought another person
[5:22] into being except a person to show the
[5:25] manifestation of me like my wife would
[5:28] come into view that would show you that
[5:30] that's my wife and now that made me a
[5:33] husband
[5:33] she could step out of the picture and
[5:35] then my granddaughter could walk in and
[5:37] say oh he's a grandfather see that shows
[5:39] in manifest what I am but I'm only one
[5:42] person right and I don't have four or
[5:45] five personalities running around inside
[5:47] of me I can be a grandfather to my
[5:50] grandchild but I can't be a grandfather
[5:52] to my wife
[5:54] because that manifestation or revelation
[5:56] of me is based on what she is she's my
[6:01] granddaughter I can't live with her like
[6:04] I live with my wife you understand God
[6:07] can't live that's why I said God that's
[6:08] why brother around said God will have
[6:09] grandchildren
[6:11] God has a bride he has a wife and that
[6:14] wife is who he lives with
[6:16] but he manifests himself as he learned
[6:18] he's healing Sinners right now walk up
[6:20] in the go up to North Georgia Medical
[6:22] Center and walk in the door right that's
[6:25] right 90 of those people are not
[6:27] Christians what we call an even nominal
[6:29] Christian but God is just healing the
[6:32] wounds he's putting all these things
[6:33] he's he's healing the bones he's a
[6:36] Healer to anybody that wants to to have
[6:38] it he's a Healer
[6:40] Redeemer savior he's only your Redeemer
[6:44] the story
[6:46] um
[6:47] that brother Brandon told about the uh
[6:50] about the boy that was in the wagon and
[6:52] the wagon was heading toward the cliff
[6:54] and this man runs up and grabs the boy
[6:56] off of the wagon before he the wagon
[6:59] goes over the cliff
[7:01] one day that boy
[7:04] grew up and become a horse thief
[7:08] and horse thieves back in the old time
[7:11] that was just like stealing
[7:13] um
[7:14] anything and you were going to hang so
[7:17] this boy walks into the courtroom and he
[7:20] looks up and there's the man that saved
[7:21] him when he was a little boy the judge
[7:26] and the judge says what's your name and
[7:28] he said I'm so on so and so and so I'm
[7:30] John Brown I said don't you remember me
[7:32] sir he said no I don't remember he said
[7:35] you remember that boy that was going off
[7:36] the cliff he said you saved me he said
[7:40] um the man said well what's your
[7:43] case and he said well more Steve and
[7:45] they're going to hang me and he hits the
[7:47] goblin he says
[7:49] the law has spoke
[7:51] and the boy says sir
[7:53] so you saved my life
[7:56] and the man looked at him and said son
[7:58] that day I was your savior he said today
[8:00] I'm your judge
[8:03] see he had turned down
[8:05] that same man that was his savior was
[8:07] going to be his judge so Jesus Christ
[8:09] the same one that can save you one day
[8:11] he's going to be your judge if you don't
[8:12] accept it but it's a it's a it's our
[8:15] free moral agency our choice to choose
[8:18] he could be your savior or he can be
[8:20] your judge
[8:21] but he's still just one manifestation
[8:23] he's a he's the greatest savior in the
[8:26] world but he's going to be the greatest
[8:27] judge there is and it's only going to be
[8:29] because of who he is so this man that
[8:32] we're talking about
[8:33] it's not two different people
[8:36] because even his character
[8:39] I was thinking about this the other day
[8:41] even God's character down through the
[8:43] Old Testament through all those now not
[8:45] the bad parts of David the bad parts of
[8:46] Abraham the bad parts of of David and
[8:49] and all those
[8:51] people down through the Old Testament
[8:53] that we read
[8:55] but his character stayed the same he
[8:57] always wanted to redeem Israel
[8:59] when he talks about in the Old Testament
[9:00] he wants to redeem Israel but Israel is
[9:03] the one that went horn Israel's one that
[9:04] closed up their womb and wouldn't accept
[9:06] him and rejected him
[9:08] but he can't forget Israel because he
[9:09] said he couldn't and he's not going to
[9:12] he was all the things in the Old
[9:14] Testament because even in Isaiah it says
[9:17] in Isaiah 9 6 is going to be counselor
[9:19] Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting
[9:21] father all these titles to this one man
[9:25] but it's pointing toward this man
[9:28] because this man can die for us the Son
[9:31] of God cannot Die For Us Son of God is
[9:34] eternal God Spirit God
[9:36] before the foundation of the world but
[9:39] yet all of these any attribute that we
[9:42] show of God was in this right here
[9:44] before the foundation of the world
[9:45] that's right every attribute all right
[9:48] even you and I
[9:49] ran here before the foundation of the
[9:51] world
[9:52] and it's not
[9:54] like Dad and I were talking yesterday I
[9:56] think somebody that most people think
[9:59] that you were some little identity you
[10:02] know it's like I was explaining this is
[10:04] this is God and all this water it's like
[10:07] brother random explained about the ocean
[10:08] but this is God and this is eternal life
[10:10] which is the coffee inside here
[10:13] well you can't look down in there and
[10:14] see way down anywhere in that coffee
[10:16] it's just liquid
[10:18] but one day a drop of that liquid
[10:21] was deposited in here
[10:25] okay so there before the foundation
[10:27] world I was with him but not as a person
[10:29] right brother Brown said it's not the
[10:31] person that comes predestinated
[10:33] eternally but the seed of the word that
[10:35] drop right there right
[10:37] remember brother Brandon said the Drop
[10:38] in the Ocean it's just it's the same as
[10:40] the ocean but it has every chemical that
[10:42] the ocean has but it's not big like the
[10:44] ocean same way with eternal life that's
[10:47] why that the Bible says that the new
[10:50] birth is just the earnest of your
[10:51] inheritance and I don't like the word
[10:53] just because eternal life is the
[10:54] greatest thing you can have but it is
[10:56] just a drop that gets you started right
[10:58] in your journey I mean you just begin
[11:01] when you see that little drop go down in
[11:03] your soul take all the sin away that
[11:04] starts your journey that don't end your
[11:06] journey that starts your journey so
[11:08] that's the way you look at God is that
[11:10] God is all all and even when Jesus came
[11:12] on Earth same thing that same eternal
[11:15] life this same person right here
[11:17] was this person in human flesh right
[11:20] you just put that this now is human
[11:22] flesh in that same eternal life God took
[11:25] on a form of man
[11:27] the Bible says
[11:29] to take on sin for you and I
[11:33] but if you don't get it right
[11:36] then
[11:38] your understanding all the things that
[11:40] you read in the Bible you'll think well
[11:42] that's why the people in in the
[11:44] denominational World they don't
[11:45] understand God they see him over here as
[11:47] Jesus they see him over here as Jehovah
[11:48] they see him over here as this they see
[11:50] him over here that
[11:51] it's the same person it's that same
[11:54] eternal life same theophany God all the
[11:56] time he does not change he just took
[11:58] that theophany and one day he put it in
[12:00] a in a body of flesh called Melchizedek
[12:04] did the work of showing Abraham what
[12:07] would happen then brother Graham said he
[12:10] just dropped that body off
[12:11] went back to Spirit God right
[12:14] then that Spirit God one day through
[12:16] Isaiah 9 6 is a virgin shall conceive so
[12:18] this went into this now you got a human
[12:21] being standing as a baby just like me
[12:24] and you born through the womb of a woman
[12:25] not created but born through the womb of
[12:27] a woman just like me and you
[12:29] now he can be our brother
[12:31] right now we're going to read Isaiah 9
[12:33] and Isaiah 53
[12:35] and we're going to see these two not
[12:37] persons or even personalities we're
[12:39] going to see this one individual do two
[12:42] works
[12:43] all right so now let's read
[12:45] excuse me I do have believed our report
[12:49] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[12:50] revealed
[12:52] that's a question Isaiah's asking now
[12:54] he's going to answer that question about
[12:56] this right here
[12:57] where he should grow up before him as a
[12:59] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[13:01] ground
[13:02] he has no form or commonness and when we
[13:04] shall see him there's no beauty that we
[13:07] should desire him
[13:08] in other words he didn't come down like
[13:10] catfish with everything all
[13:12] you know prettied up in his beard
[13:14] trimmed just really nice and I hope his
[13:17] cuticles on this you know no no
[13:20] he came in a Manger born the worst way
[13:22] you could be born came up poor
[13:26] um
[13:27] probably looked kind of ragged every
[13:30] once in a while you know and he didn't
[13:31] keep his beard trimmed he didn't go I
[13:33] don't believe he went to the barber
[13:34] every week
[13:35] all right
[13:37] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[13:40] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[13:43] and we hit it as was our face from him
[13:45] he was despised and we esteemed a night
[13:47] now who's he talking about he's talking
[13:48] about this man
[13:50] the one that's going to come and die for
[13:52] us okay he's talking to the son of man
[13:55] he has despised and rejected of men a
[13:58] man of sorrow acquainted with grief we
[13:59] hidden where our face from him
[14:01] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[14:03] surely he hath borne our grief and
[14:05] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[14:07] him stricken smitten of God and
[14:09] Afflicted see it looked like on the
[14:10] cross that he was being judged by God
[14:14] which he really was
[14:16] that flesh was being judged by God
[14:19] but Caiaphas was looking at it as well I
[14:22] see there
[14:24] he's nothing anyway God's bringing
[14:26] judgment down on him because of the way
[14:28] he acted toward all these people all
[14:30] these all these
[14:32] um meetings that he had and he got all
[14:34] the people all riled up see but it
[14:36] wasn't it was God doing the work
[14:38] verse five but he was wounded for our
[14:41] transgression he was bruised for our
[14:43] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[14:45] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[14:47] healed
[14:49] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[14:52] have turned everyone to his own way
[14:53] remember at the cross what happened they
[14:54] all left him
[14:55] and the Lord hath laid on him the
[14:57] iniquity of us all remember there was
[14:59] 400 and something scriptures
[15:01] fulfilled just at the three hours of
[15:04] calvary
[15:05] he was oppressed he was deflected yet he
[15:08] opened on his mouth he was brought as a
[15:10] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[15:12] before his shears is done so he opened
[15:14] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[15:17] from judgment who shall declare his
[15:19] generation
[15:20] for he was cut off
[15:22] what would you how would he cut off he
[15:24] was killed
[15:25] you can't have another generation if you
[15:27] die
[15:29] if you don't have children
[15:31] but they were looking at the natural man
[15:35] here Isaiah is speaking of the natural
[15:37] man
[15:38] but he's asking a question watch
[15:43] Lucio declares generation for he was cut
[15:46] off out of the land of the living for
[15:48] the transgression of my people
[15:51] was he stricken that'll take you back to
[15:53] Daniel 9 24 of what we've been on before
[15:57] and he made his grave with the wicked so
[16:00] he is the person
[16:02] and when the rich and his death who was
[16:05] it remember who was it uh
[16:07] um the rich man's one that gave him the
[16:09] tomb to be buried him because he had
[16:12] done no violence neither was any deceit
[16:14] in his mouth
[16:15] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[16:17] hath put him to grief but Thou shalt
[16:19] make his soul
[16:21] an offering for sin he shall see a seed
[16:24] now
[16:28] up above there we see that that is
[16:31] talking of Jesus Christ
[16:33] the son of man
[16:34] because all these things were happening
[16:36] to a flesh man a fleshly person right
[16:40] of Jesus Christ
[16:45] and he ended that part by saying he was
[16:49] what he would come as a lamb to his
[16:51] shears dumb
[16:54] it pleased the Lord to bruise him put
[16:56] him to grief when thou shalt make his
[16:57] soul and offering for sin he shall see
[17:00] us see
[17:02] that's how that Isaiah is answering the
[17:05] question in verse 8.
[17:08] who shall declare his generation
[17:12] it's not the body of Jesus the body of
[17:14] Jesus is the sacrifice
[17:16] just like the lamb was a sacrifice but
[17:19] this was a human sacrifice
[17:21] but what did he sacrifice he gave
[17:24] his body
[17:26] remember John on the River Jordan when
[17:28] he washed Jesus he was fulfilling the
[17:30] Old Testament because you have to wash
[17:32] the sacrifice before you make the
[17:35] offering so John washed the sacrifice in
[17:38] the River Jordan Jesus didn't need to be
[17:40] baptized he was the almighty God right
[17:42] because John said I need to be baptized
[17:44] to you and he said suffer it to be so in
[17:46] other words I know I know that but to
[17:49] fulfill all righteousness in other words
[17:50] to fulfill the Old Testament you got to
[17:53] put me in the water and wash me you're
[17:54] the high priest
[17:56] I'm the sacrifice you got to watch me
[17:58] all right
[17:59] so the son of man was the Lamb of God
[18:04] they took away the sin of the world
[18:06] but now to see his generation progress
[18:09] we know that Jesus didn't have a wife he
[18:12] didn't have natural children but Isaiah
[18:15] is asking who shall declare his
[18:16] generation for he was cut off from the
[18:18] land of the living
[18:19] here the living the one we're seeing
[18:21] right here this living
[18:24] in other words Abel the same way when
[18:27] when Cain killed Abel
[18:29] Abel had not procreated so there was no
[18:32] genealogy of Abel anymore because Abel
[18:34] was cut off in his generation
[18:37] but in a tight God raised up Seth
[18:41] right raised up Seth as a type of Christ
[18:44] being raised up to start a generation a
[18:48] spiritual generation which is this one
[18:49] right here
[18:51] he shall make his soul and offering for
[18:53] sin
[18:55] he'd already put his body a sacrifice
[18:57] for our transgression for our healing he
[19:00] was willing for our transgression
[19:01] bruised for our iniquity with his
[19:02] stripes we were healed
[19:04] that was not this part that was this
[19:07] part
[19:08] this part had to go through that to
[19:10] release what
[19:13] see it was the animal life that was
[19:15] released but he couldn't come back on
[19:17] the believer but it was a death
[19:20] but to release the life of a lamb you
[19:22] gotta kill it to release the life of the
[19:25] Lamb of God the man had to kill it
[19:29] kill him to release what now
[19:35] Isaiah's telling you that
[19:38] when thou shalt make his soul and
[19:40] offering for sin
[19:42] who's the soul of Jesus Christ
[19:45] almighty God the Son of God the Creator
[19:49] God the one that's got all the eternal
[19:51] life in it
[19:52] but to get this out of this cup if it
[19:55] was sealed to get this out of this cup
[19:56] I'd have to break the cup
[19:59] when Jesus said there's none perfect no
[20:02] not one
[20:04] he was talking about his flesh sure
[20:06] that's why the soul of God was
[20:10] he can't tempt God
[20:12] but that son of man could be tempted
[20:14] sure absolutely went through points just
[20:17] like we all do that's the perfect
[20:19] sacrifice well Jesus could look at his
[20:21] hands and see that they didn't look like
[20:23] they did when he was 20. he could look
[20:26] in the mirror if there was such thin I
[20:28] guess it was and know that he was
[20:29] getting older he was not in his perfect
[20:31] condition so when they said who's
[20:34] perfect he said there's nothing perfect
[20:35] but God the one inside of it and you can
[20:38] say the same thing there's none perfect
[20:40] but God
[20:41] but the god inside of him
[20:44] exalted him the Bible says up above
[20:48] so high he's going to look down to see
[20:50] heaven now
[20:51] because of what what was inside of it
[20:54] that's right
[20:55] this is the perfect God you say is this
[20:58] the imperfect God no no that was the
[21:01] sacrifice right because remember that
[21:03] sacrifice had to be perfect also Jesus
[21:05] was just saying in his Humanity he was
[21:08] saying don't worship this man
[21:12] worship the father right but now when
[21:15] Jesus comes on John and Patmos I believe
[21:18] he he accepted the worship because he
[21:20] was in his fullness even after the
[21:22] resurrection
[21:25] he was in his fullness
[21:27] that was almighty God right well yeah
[21:29] well it was almighty God walking on the
[21:31] face of the Earth before his death
[21:33] but there was a time that all this right
[21:36] here had to happen
[21:37] God was bottled up inside of that human
[21:39] being and could not get out because he
[21:42] said he couldn't
[21:43] until he broke the vessel
[21:45] until the lamb was slain when that lamb
[21:49] was slain it released what this soul
[21:51] that we're talking about
[21:53] all right when he said I found some God
[21:57] and I go to God
[21:59] when he came through God was that in the
[22:01] infant form when he was born he came
[22:04] from God no he came from this right here
[22:06] yeah it came from this right and he went
[22:09] right back to this
[22:11] if this is if this is light which we
[22:13] know it is right we prove that in the
[22:15] Old Testament he went from light to
[22:18] flesh
[22:19] and he went back to life
[22:22] brother Brown said the flesh
[22:25] is on the altar
[22:26] and said Paul met Jesus Christ but not
[22:30] Jesus Christ the flesh man that walked
[22:32] on the face of the Earth
[22:34] this body's laying as a sacrifice now
[22:36] like Daddy said it's not laying lifeless
[22:38] it's all types and shadows and and um
[22:43] exactly they can't come back here or he
[22:46] could walk back down here that's right
[22:48] but his body is holding somewhere
[22:51] sent the Holy Ghost back which is the
[22:53] same person but that flesh man's not
[22:55] walking on the face of the Earth that's
[22:56] right
[22:58] right you can't do it not until the
[23:01] Millennium right he's the one that said
[23:03] it
[23:04] can't dwell in an unclean vessel so this
[23:06] Earth is not clean
[23:08] until the millennium
[23:10] and then it's only partially cleaned but
[23:12] it's clean enough for God to walk on
[23:14] but yeah the body in City he come from I
[23:17] come from God
[23:19] and I go back to God in other words he
[23:22] made a journey from from the Son of God
[23:24] in the Old Testament Jehovah and it
[23:26] wouldn't bother me if you put I came
[23:28] from Jehovah I go back to Jehovah
[23:31] because he's still Jehovah God until
[23:33] he's revealed as the son of man Jesus
[23:36] Christ to the Jews he still Jehovah
[23:38] Abraham he stealed Jehovah to Isaac and
[23:41] Jacob and all those people
[23:43] that's why I say it's going to be a
[23:45] great time when we get over there
[23:46] there's going to be a lot of people
[23:48] that's not even going to understand what
[23:50] happened
[23:51] and we're going to have an eternity to
[23:53] be able to discuss just this right here
[23:55] right
[23:56] and not be tired and have to keep
[23:58] looking at clocks and you know have the
[24:00] cares of life and have to worry about
[24:01] going home and going to work and driving
[24:03] eight hours
[24:05] and all that but one day we'll be able
[24:07] to tell people
[24:09] Isaiah couldn't understand that he he
[24:12] sure he he wrote this
[24:15] and pinned it but he remember he penned
[24:17] it by the Holy Spirit that's right
[24:20] he may have had a vision of Jesus Christ
[24:22] I don't know
[24:24] but when he said of urgent shall
[24:26] conceive
[24:27] that was way out
[24:30] I mean that can happen in the end time
[24:33] because they can do artificial
[24:34] insemination but what they're doing is
[24:36] they're just proving that that happens
[24:38] supernaturally
[24:40] with God because God didn't inject a
[24:43] sperm and an egg into Mary that's right
[24:45] it was a creative germ it was all I mean
[24:48] it was already connected
[24:51] a lot of people in this message don't
[24:53] see that either it wasn't that that God
[24:56] said Okay I want to put an egg in Marion
[24:57] and I'm going to put a sperm no that
[24:59] wouldn't be a sex act that's right no
[25:01] egg and sperm were already just spoken
[25:04] and it's stuck in that womb and it was
[25:06] ready to go that's right no sensation
[25:08] with a sensation you got to have an act
[25:11] right he said there was no sensation
[25:13] Mary had no sensation except 28 Days
[25:15] Later
[25:16] she had to she had to prophesy for 28
[25:19] days not seeing a thing going on nothing
[25:21] she didn't feel nothing
[25:23] it should have felt anything it would
[25:25] not have been God doing it okay but that
[25:28] had but see there was he coming I come
[25:30] from God
[25:31] I dropped down into human flesh and I go
[25:34] back to God
[25:35] now he's never going to drop that human
[25:37] flesh anymore
[25:38] because he will be you know everybody
[25:41] and we're going to get into this a
[25:43] couple of Sundays
[25:45] because the Bible says the
[25:48] that sonship will terminate
[25:51] that he may be all in all
[25:53] but let me give you a little key
[25:56] God always was this right right God
[25:59] always was this right
[26:02] in his mind he knew this was what he was
[26:04] going to be
[26:05] so you're never
[26:07] in all eternity
[26:09] you're never going to say okay he's
[26:12] never was a son he the son never existed
[26:14] because the way the Bible and the way
[26:16] the people in the message say well and
[26:18] even brother Brown and brother Branham
[26:19] says should you say Eternal son he's
[26:22] talking to the Catholic people
[26:24] the Catholics believe in eternal sonship
[26:28] an eternal father an eternal son and an
[26:31] eternal Holy Ghost three gods that's
[26:34] what brother Rand was talking about he
[26:35] wasn't saying that that you know it'll
[26:39] be wiped away and you'll never know I'll
[26:42] always know he was the son of God right
[26:43] I'll always know that that man died for
[26:46] me that son of man amen because that's
[26:48] some man standing right here today
[26:52] it's God in human flesh all over again
[26:54] that's right
[26:55] because he took this life that was in
[26:57] him bottled up in this man
[27:00] and as the day of Pentecost there was
[27:03] 120.
[27:04] of these
[27:07] into human flesh three thousand of these
[27:11] in the human flesh down Through the Ages
[27:14] always been the son of God
[27:16] Sons and Daughters of God
[27:18] which is God in another form that's the
[27:20] way God wanted it
[27:21] all right let's finish reading it
[27:26] he shall make his soul and offering for
[27:28] sin what he shall see his seed he didn't
[27:32] say when he gave his flesh he said when
[27:34] he gave his soul
[27:35] the flesh was a sacrifice to pay for all
[27:37] this that we're doing right here all
[27:39] this human sin that we're doing
[27:41] right but remember that Son of God this
[27:43] right here this man never sinned right
[27:45] this man didn't either but this man
[27:47] never sinned a day in his life and if
[27:49] that's inside of you that person never
[27:51] sinned a day in his life right never
[27:52] said a bad word never was married two or
[27:54] three times never did drink never did
[27:56] smoke never did gamble never did have a
[27:58] dirty thought right that's right okay
[28:01] that's what he was given
[28:03] he was being able to break this
[28:08] flesh and release
[28:12] this you can't say it another way but
[28:14] this person right
[28:17] but it's not too persons right
[28:20] but he this is what he decided because
[28:21] we're reading what he decided this is
[28:23] what God decided to do
[28:25] and he went into Isaiah Jeremiah he said
[28:28] this is what I'm going to do I'm gonna
[28:29] do this and this is the way I'm going to
[28:31] do it because remember he said in
[28:32] Genesis 3 I'm going to do it you can't
[28:35] do it Adam you messed up you failed told
[28:37] Abraham he said Abraham you're not going
[28:39] to do it I'm gonna do it
[28:40] so this man said he was going to do it
[28:42] he decreed he was going to do it and
[28:44] said this is how I'm going to do it
[28:46] some God going to the son of man to
[28:49] release the life had to pay the debt
[28:51] first what went to hell the flesh or the
[28:54] soul of God the soul of God soul that
[28:58] God had to pay that Ransom right the son
[29:00] of man paid the ransom for the world
[29:03] what we're doing it Brews Brews for our
[29:05] iniquity can't bruise the Son of God
[29:06] that's right
[29:08] Son of God can't transgress Son of God
[29:10] Son of God didn't take a stripe today in
[29:13] his life but this man did that's right
[29:17] to pay the natural price
[29:20] you know what
[29:22] I was reading you uh Friday
[29:25] was praying he said God he said thank
[29:27] you for your blood
[29:29] he said but I'm standing in front
[29:33] greater than your blood right greater he
[29:37] said I'm standing in front of the
[29:39] purchase
[29:41] you can have the blood in your hand all
[29:43] day long you can rub yourself with it
[29:44] you can just you can drown in it that
[29:47] won't save your soul that's right
[29:49] but if you believe that that man right
[29:51] there
[29:52] came in this man right to this man right
[29:54] here
[29:55] came down as this man paid your price
[29:59] for what you're looking at now and what
[30:01] you can't see to get you back to here
[30:05] that's greater than any blood chemistry
[30:08] you understand chemistry but the life of
[30:11] the blood that's what he was saying he
[30:12] said God he said thank you for your
[30:14] blood he said but thank you for letting
[30:16] me stand in something greater than your
[30:18] blood he said stand in front of the
[30:19] purchase of that blood right okay so
[30:22] what was the the blood of the son of man
[30:25] didn't save nobody
[30:26] the natural blood
[30:29] but when that man did what he did
[30:32] so willingly did what he did to release
[30:36] this guy right here
[30:38] this is the one
[30:41] he made an offering for sin so he what
[30:44] he shall see a seed in other words his
[30:46] generation then it's going to be
[30:48] propagated
[30:49] through the spoken word now through
[30:51] Jesus Christ giving his life and we
[30:53] believe it on him that same life that
[30:55] was in Jesus Romans 8.
[30:57] if the spirit that brought raised up
[30:59] Jesus from the dead dwell in you either
[31:01] Quicken your mortal body that's right
[31:04] by his what spirit that dwelleth in you
[31:08] son of God
[31:10] so the son of man but that was the Same
[31:11] Spirit now Same Spirit it's just this
[31:14] was in a human flesh
[31:16] this was a sacrifice for everything we
[31:18] did out here
[31:19] but that right there that man right
[31:21] there is the one that decreed in Genesis
[31:23] I'll do it right
[31:24] but I'm going to do it through here
[31:26] right I'm gonna come as the seed of the
[31:28] woman that's right and I'm going to save
[31:31] your soul and then I'm going right back
[31:32] to here because I can't get into you as
[31:34] the son of man
[31:35] Jesus can stand all he wants to beside
[31:37] of us there's no way he can get inside
[31:39] of us that's right it's fleshly that's
[31:41] right he had to go back to Spirit God so
[31:44] he could come down in spirit form as the
[31:46] Holy Ghost to come into he had to go
[31:49] back to God that's right he had to go
[31:51] back to God he had to release this life
[31:53] this life right here this man went to
[31:56] hell
[31:57] that's right so you don't have to
[31:59] because you went with it
[32:01] you've already been to Hell
[32:03] right so it's over you don't have to go
[32:04] anymore you already went one time
[32:06] let's finish reading before we're done
[32:11] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[32:13] has put him to grief when thou shalt
[32:14] make his soul and offering for sin he
[32:17] shall see a scene
[32:18] he shall prolong his days and the
[32:21] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[32:22] his hands he shall see the travail of
[32:25] his soul
[32:28] not Jesus's soul
[32:31] Jesus is on his soul was the same
[32:34] he's saying my soul or his voice but
[32:37] Isaiah is saying his soul
[32:40] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[32:43] shall my righteous servant justify many
[32:47] for he shall bear their iniquity
[32:48] therefore will I divide him a portion
[32:50] with the great he shall divide the spoil
[32:52] of the strong because he has poured out
[32:56] his soul
[32:58] unto death
[33:00] so can't die
[33:03] he said he poured out his soul unto
[33:04] death not in death because Jesus never
[33:07] died one more thing before we go bill
[33:10] um
[33:11] wild billions bless his heart
[33:14] last night or yesterday we were talking
[33:16] about kind of a little bit about this he
[33:19] said even if I go to the Grave
[33:21] he said I've already got a tape player
[33:23] and he said I want that tape player put
[33:25] in my coffin and it's screaming he's not
[33:28] dead he's not dead he's not dead
[33:31] you can't kill him Christians
[33:35] but you know how Bale is everybody knows
[33:38] pretty animated but he said if they have
[33:40] to put me in the grave and he said I
[33:41] told him play this cassette tape I'm not
[33:44] there
[33:45] you can't kill me that's right and I can
[33:47] see him if he ever did I can see that
[33:49] going all through that funeral home I'm
[33:52] not well that's true that's right yes
[33:54] sir that's right this flesh died
[33:58] this flesh died to show you the Lamb of
[34:02] God that took away the son of the world
[34:03] but this man right here is the one that
[34:05] really did the work because he's the one
[34:08] to come back in here and resurrected if
[34:11] that had not been in the son of man he
[34:13] would have never resurrected that's
[34:14] right
[34:15] but he had to come back
[34:18] without any
[34:20] all right Same Spirit that raise up
[34:22] Jesus from the dead it was quick and
[34:23] your mortal Body by his spirit that
[34:25] dwells in you now there was one man
[34:27] Jesus Christ that had that in him now
[34:29] there's many the Bible says many sons
[34:31] right just like him now
[34:34] not lower form Jesus said join heirs
[34:37] right that's right here that ain't right
[34:39] here that's right here
[34:41] all right see you in a couple weeks
[34:47] y'all pray for me today if I don't get
[34:49] over there and save time
[34:52] dude
