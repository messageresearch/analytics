amen and our time is always short and there's so much to The Sibling so we'll do a quick work amen amen so would like to turn your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 12. amen as we look into the word of God and what I'm going to read from verse 12 to verse 18. and this evening I'd like to speak within the same context the the word expression becomes material amen so the word expression becomes material amen let us bar heads or Heavenly Father Lord we thank you God for this privilege you have given to us again to Lord being your midst and Lord God to hear your word Heavenly Father we realize that the Eternal Word of God being made manifest to us in this hour that we're living in and how grateful we are god father we pray that you feed not just our body narrow Spirit but Lord God we pray that our soul will hear from our theophany when the perfect word of God is delivered to us oh God which is you have your way now as we look to you and believe you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen in Colossians 1 and verse 12. giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light amen who has delivered us from the power of Darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption to his blood the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by Him and for him and it is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church which is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated laughs it works is fate expressed 1965 paragraph 106. but Brahm said a Baptist Minister told me not long ago he said I just contact step revelation I said then you cannot accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is a revelation of God Amen is God's reveal in flesh simply therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation amen praise God you know we look at ourselves as a Triune being where Body Spirit and soul and let us look at it like this this evening you know what we say this morning well this flesh man is an unbeliever is a non-believer your spirit is a make-believer and your soul is a real believer because when you receive the new birth it is your soul that is transformed and the reason why we're still here is because this man this house needs Redemption amen so when you receive the new birth your soul is redeemed amen amen but this needs Redemption and the problem you have is in this flesh man and in your spirit you know saying Church the smile is this Pride there's Envy there's all these things really that is the nature of your spirit that one morning you wake up and you you love one another and you feel loved and the next day the devil tell you nobody loves you so your spirit is a make-believer sometimes he believes and and so there is a suppression because of where you live amen the holy spirit is working on you to bring you to the image of Christ amen but the the attitude or the pressure of this manner the ottoman the oath you live in is causing you Amen to take the influences of the world so you you look at the neighbor's car and not only that you like it you wish it was yours that's Envy amen does that make you a believer but but let us look at them of Allah Peter the man with the key that unlocked the door Paul the Apostle says that Peter when the Jews was around he separated himself from the Gentiles but then when there was no Gentiles looking he eaten and all of that with the with the Gentiles and Paul said to him he rebuked him and said Peter you are to be blamed so though even with the new birth Peter had trouble in his emotions really amen because of that Spirit but so so your body is an unbeliever amen but listen when you receive the new birth that body is Justified amen hallelujah and what he wants for his confidence is a first pull he feels he see that's where he lives but your spirit is a make-believer and if that Spirit of Euros be Sanctified by the word amen you see when Jesus made the woman of Samaria it did not operate with her flesh she was not sick amen but she needed sanctification the second pull amen believe if she could believe but the soul is a Believer he's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the third pull is operating in him so he knows amen hallelujah so we now look at take that note to the Eternal one no Jesus when he was here on Earth you know it comes from the Eternal Word and he comes into theophany in the theophany you know all things and from theophany he comes to the Virgin born body amen no in his debt what happened amen Jesus in his debt he was going back from where he come from I come from God and I'm going back to God is that right amen so in debt Hallelujah you know while the body was in the grave where was his spirit he went and preached to the spirits that were in prison is that right amen so when you die I want to say this to you that for your confidence and when somebody dies they don't go in a space of absence this body goes to corruption amen but there's a part of you that's alive in another dimension and that is why if you have ever hear the testimony of somebody that has died and was raised from the dead they go into a sphere where it is Sublime it's perfect amen and right there they realize that this that we are in now is worse than where we're going to amen that's why our brother Dixon he said brother Keith I never want to come back amen but I hear your voice when you call me and I come back into that body wow amen but you ask the question how could I live in that for so long for all these years in this corruptible world Amen so as a Believer even dead take us back into the presence of God Amen Hallelujah we come from God yes amen we come from the word we bypass our theophany and come into flesh to be tested amen but if you die you step into that theophany house amen Paul said in second our Corinthians 5 21 if my Earthly house and the Tabernacle is dissolved we have a Tiffany that is waiting high up in the heavens and it's not made with hands so in this we are groaning we're under pressure the pressures of this world is upon us waiting to be clothed upon you with a horse that is in heaven amen praise God now in the first seal paragraph one 12 brother Graham said he said no Christ is a revelation of God in other words it brings God in plain view he came to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself in otherwise you never know just what God was until he revealed himself through Christ then you can see you know I remember the days when I used to get a publication from Brother Dale Ketch of uh there were reports from Israel on a daily basis and when the Israel is right about god Jehovah when they write the word god they write G underscore D because they realize that what we say God we we don't even understand what we're saying but when they speak of God they speak of the Eternal one the eternal spirit and because there's no concept not even to write the word they don't write it like that because it would not be the expression of who he is that is why Jesus the Lord Jesus is our only concept of God when the Jehovah's Witness go around and oh Jehovah Jehovah they don't even know what they're talking about amen praise God so here now the prophet was coming up to bring to you the seventh seal and in Christ the minister of God revealed 101 he says now for a text I want to take out of there for this this Vortex basing it up on the entire Bible he said but I want us to title this Christ is a mystery of God revealed he said Christ be Christ being the mystery of God revealed so the God we speak of it is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and our concept can't go further than that because he is the one now in Christ the minister of God revealed paragraph 141 he said now the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God will cover all space Time and Eternity he could not it's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin he said that after you you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of here of light here space and on out into an infinite he said into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying this son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now we get it now we get it the son of man they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now we get it he says he wanted to express himself that was is one of the greatest truthful purpose was to express himself identify himself with human being to be to reveal himself in Christ amen and so that's the greatest you will get of the Eternal God he said secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in his people he could do that he couldn't do that he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them from that and so in the beginning that's exactly what God wanted to achieve yes what God is bringing you into now is what he wanted to achieve in Genesis but sinmar that picture but God is going to achieve what he set out to do how is he doing it here you are amen amen amen praise God now sometimes people miss the picture sometimes by a quote or something that was said you know so really now let us always remember that brother Branham was a son of man he was a prophet but it was a prophet revealing the son of man Jesus Christ Jesus was the prophet of all Prophets amen no they also use an expression they said well the the the message and the messenger becomes one that's fine if you've got a clear understanding but the message is Jesus Christ all right and you cannot make a son of man Jesus Christ Moses brother Benham said when he had the word of God to declare to the people it was more than Moses but when the word was declared it was Moses again amen hallelujah so don't take the prophetic for Runner more than a prophet he was not dated and if there's ever going to be any deity the closest you'll ever get to deity is the bride of Christ being revealed by the word of God don't put it on him put it on her you're with me Hallelujah because the bride is not married to a son of man she's married to the son of man and the two has become one amen hallelujah praise God so in my mind for clarity I always remind myself but he is my elieza amen and what was the minister of elieza is to find a bride for Isaac amen it was to find a bride for himself amen so we've got to be careful of the idols of our relics and all that we keep because the reflection is Jesus Christ amen the word expression becoming material if the expression is Christ then the material is Christ amen so if there's any data we're talking about it's not in Jeffersonville it's in you amen Christ the fullness of the god that bodily but you are coming into that fullness amen and Brethren let's hold this really that God is bringing you to a position for a body change and all that fulfilled God's purpose is going to have that change brother brother teaches years back he said and if you ain't got the Fate to make the change then you've got to go by the grave is it right like when they left Egypt remember they said we will not leave a hoof back in Egypt amen thing that belongs to us is coming out loud and in this Exodus everything that has the Seal of God is going to come out there is nothing the devil can do to stop you from making it the church might not want you yeah they might not accept you but God will accept you last week I was preaching I said you know the woman with the alabaster box of ointment I said many of us wouldn't want her in our church because they said she was a woman of the city and she was a sinner and we wouldn't want that woman in our church but Jesus Jesus said wherever the gospel is preached there's going to be mention of this woman right if there's not a sinner there's no need for a savior you can put you he can't push you when God can't reach you [Applause] amen the Bible says he had need to go through Samaria not because the priest was in Samaria but because a woman was in Samaria hello they said a pastor who do you deal with this situation this woman is married five times but not only that worse than that but now she's living without man that is not her husband how do you deal with that Grace the grace of God the grace of God that grace of God go further than anything that you can commit on this side of Glory for he stayed there on the cross he stayed there until every sin that was possible that you could have committed was paid for I said Messiah comment and he's going to tell us what we ought to he's going to tell us what to do about our mortal problems and all this thing he said I that speak unto thee I am he amen praise God hallelujah [Music] amen I had to say that and so you know they said well you know it depends on who your mother and your father is because they said you know the prophet says well I can't see adultery big predestinated so what your mother and father did he said that's not predestinated and I can't see that in the rapture he said he can't see that in the Rapture but I applied the blood of Jesus Christ because we were all born wrong to begin with amen we were all gone wrong yeah so whether you were married or you're not you're all born wrong for them to begin with is it right it's not the act of your mother and father that is predestinated it's the germ of life and the thoughts of God so that's why when God had to go beyond who your mama is he has to go beyond what your father is are you there with me you have to go back to himself hello so God loved looking at all you came here is looking at what's in him so when he said let us you are part of that amen and there's no mortal and hurt that can change that purpose you said and brother Keith how do I know that it's in me it's revealed to you amen hallelujah it's not what you do it's what God did so you know I was on drugs I was doing all these things and then I found God you never find God no no God was always calling back all his attributes amen and in the time appointed Hallelujah you step into your position are you with me Hallelujah and if you don't believe that you're bounding the blood of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah but it reaches to the highest mountain and it flow to the lowest Valley the blood that give me strength from day to day it shall never never lose its power amen the prophet says now paragraph 144 continued he said this is Rich to me just even to think of it see what God's purpose was and why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness is full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior how do you know he was he hears a cause I've had the experience he's a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through Christ amen how could he be a son holy true Christ how could he be a Healer only through Christ all things are wound up into that one person Jesus Christ it's not wound in your mother and father it's not wound in the denomination you come from did not mourned in the country of living it's wound up in Jesus Christ amen so get past your yesterday get past What You Did In This World Heaven come up to the point of what he did for you it's not what I did it is what he did Hallelujah second Corinthians 5 21 he said that he becomes sin for me Amen in other words all the sin that you had commit and could commit he become that and for that he will he went to the cross and he paid the price of that sin then he said that you might become the righteousness of God in him if you can believe that he becomes sin for you why can't you believe that you become righteousness if you are convicted of all the sins you have committed and he comes and pay the price oh Hallelujah then you can go free hallelujah amen what kind of man is that but he set me free he said and then to bring that fullness of the guarded bodily Hallelujah into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading so what he did he bring the fullness of the godhead in you Hallelujah amen praise God 1963 the super sign he said oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one amen so not God and Christ now but God and man Christ Jesus bridge the gap to bring man back into the position of God because the sonship is only for a time until the Plan of Redemption is over and all that was in the mind of God go back to God then what need directly for a son no no because Redemption plan is over I'll not leave one none that the father give me shall be lost save the Son of Perdition amen hallelujah praise God he said that super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and that's why we go through that this morning and all that Christ was so if you listen if you can believe that all that God was he poured into Christ can you believe that all that Christ was he poured into the church if all that God was he poured into Christ what a revelation what a revelation then can you step down now and believe that on all that Christ was he poured into the church Hallelujah that said my heart rejoicing amen a super sign Hallelujah God and man together it was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day a super sign a virgin shall conceive Hallelujah and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested in flesh Hallelujah amen a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign notice Hallelujah they've got Superman today they've got fictions of Superman and all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifesting in human flesh is a rat and Brethren when the supernatural is returned to you then we will say the word is made flesh again amen it's not just on the pages of the Bible but it has stepped from the page into a body somebody that will manifest that word the Bible said that they did not believe him but when he went into Nazareth where he was brought up and as a custom was on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue they handled the scroll and he found the place where it was written of him the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach Deliverance to the captive there were sinners they were Bound in sin but he come preaching Deliverance to the captive the opening of the eyes of the blind to set up labor to them that are abound and he closed the book he did not read the scripture for yesterday for the future he read the scripture for that day and he hand it back to this scroll to the priests and he'd take his seat and look at what they said they said is not this Joseph's son we know his mother and father you see they try do the Mighty God that unveil before them they try that if in their minds they could bring him down to themselves then they could disbelieve Hallelujah but in all they're saying he said on this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen God and Christ has become one this day is this scripture fulfilled in your very years amen all that Christ was he poured into the church and this day is this scripture fulfilling your ears and you hear it Hallelujah and Sir John 14 20 says I'm an evening the day I'm sorry he said Hallelujah said John 14 20. in that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me and he didn't stop there and I in you may God help us to recognize our privilege that we are from God Hey listen with this Revelation you ought to walk not like other Gentiles walk amen amen you you ought to stick your head up and let the world know that there's something about you amen God has stepped down in this hour amen God and man has become one Hallelujah amen he said oh if that was a super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today Hallelujah that is still the super sign amen in Saint John 14 23 the Bible says and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will we will come unto him and make our board with him in other words we're going to live with him in him amen and you know I want you to bear this in mind when we say the Son and the father when the logos comes from the eternal spirit to the logos that eternal spirit is father amen and the logos was a veil and when the theophany man stepped there amen when he become Melchizedek that wave that he come from he says father amen amen amen hallelujah amen and when from that logos he become the Virgin born son he looked back at that theophany and he says father because it gave birth to himself hallelujah amen God gave birth to God amen so he said the eternal spirit give birth to the logos the logos give birth to the theophany amen and that theophany Hallelujah he could not eat nor drink with man but brother bran said he put on 16 elements he put on dos and Abram had communion with him Genesis 14 but then in Genesis 18 he visited Abraham to confirm the promise which is your promise hallelujah amen and he troll 16 elements he turned us upon that theophany and so Abram served him a meal and he had a meal with Abraham God come down and feast with man Hallelujah and how do you know that is God when his back turned to the tent he tell the secret that was in Sarah's heart the Messiah sign that when he met the woman of Samaria hallelujah amen and he said Google go call your husband because she said give me that water you will call your husband I've got no husband he said you have well said he knows that she speak the truth you said it but you see the spirit never divorce you from those husbands you've had five husbands and the one you have now is not yours you know might be nobody in the city know that she had that sixth one but he knows I perceive your own Prophet all your Prophet can do that the same exact sign that was revealed to Abram and Sarah comes to the woman of Samaria and that same sign is going to be in the bride when we move from the intellectual that's fundamental and get to the supernatural amen Church yeah we're not excited about what we hear we become so starchy and stiff-necking about the word of God hallelujah but when the real God unveiled before you you see it I don't care what my neighbor do I don't person beside me though there's joy overflow hit my soul you can't stop me from praise God if you don't praise him that's your business but I'll tell you what

all that God was watching putting you know into the godhead God Wars he poured into Christ the logos Hallelujah and all that Christ was he poured out into the church the Believers so Colossians 1 26 and 27 says even the mystery which us being hid from ages from Generations but now now this was 1963. there's something about the believer and the word of God the unbeliever can read it and it don't make no sense to them the make-believer can read it and don't make no sense of it but what the believer read it when it says and no Hallelujah you update that word you caused that word to step from the page not the day when he said it but today but now Hallelujah Glory hallelujah amen you gotta know where you are but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the

is a conception Amen in you and it will bring forth The Finnish body of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah what a glory that will be amen do you know for years the churches have sing about it amen they talk about it but they never know what it is because it was a mystery it was hidden but now it's made manifest to the Saints Hallelujah the unveiling of God 1964 he said no when it said there that he emptied himself or poured out now we could think like this that he vomit up the English word of empty or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him like I have a glass of water or and I pour the contents out he said it's not like that no don't don't get it mixed up no no no no he said but the word kinos in Greek does not mean that he vomit up his arms went off or is I went off another person no he said that is he changed himself Hallelujah he poured himself into it amen into another mask Hallelujah like when the eternal spirit comes into Hallelujah the pure of fire the Shekinah Glory he changed himself Hallelujah he said that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was e himself Hallelujah he himself poured himself into the people it's Christ inside this life of mine and you know sometimes because scarecrows had been upon her land we don't say the word Hallelujah but he's a seven Thunder life of mine that mystery that was in the seventh seal is now in me the book was bound with a seal the Seven Seals amen hallelujah well you know that's just the container yeah what's in it seven Thunders amen this is a bottle anything could be in it what's in it the anointing oil that has been consecrated for a purpose amen if this was the seventh seal this bottle what's in it yeah what's in it seven Thunders that's what it is the Revelation that come to you that is the seven Thunders and it's bringing you rapturing fate [Applause] Hallelujah so somebody said seven Thunder Seven Virtues that don't stop me no that is just a squat on my ground but that was taught me to take hold of my Landmark if it's mine it is mine amen because you know the Holy Ghost has searched all the way back and give you an abstract nobody can stop you now amen Satan has no more hold on you you're gonna go through this it's just like a drama that is set amen that he already knows that you're going to have Pitfall you're going to have an accident you're gonna have an operation he knows all of that but he's looking at the end of the display of that righteousness hey man tomorrow you might have a bad day at work and the next day you might have a good day the next day you might have a great day and the next day an excellent day and the next day nothing happened God knows all of that but but that he's dealing with and whether you're hop or you're down there's a testimony Hallelujah of him in you yes you know we have to judge for trials because Lord this is temporal but you know something Lord I know you know the end of all of this and I'm the banister of Heaven you've got a theophany house that you're going to that of all the revelation of what God is bringing you to and he sees the end as the Lord's the beginning and he's whispering in your soul just press on press on it's all right it's all right hey amen he's not going

quickly now and take the communion Hallelujah now therefore you are No More Strangers Hallelujah and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the old soul of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone amen in whom all the building fitly framed together growing up into the Holy Temple in the Lord in whom he also are building together as an habitation of God Amen through the spirit amen hallelujah amen thank you oh Jesus thank you Christ's life in you make him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ and Christ in you make you the complete revelation of the whole thing hallelujah amen what God is trying to do yes this is it this is it you said my brother Keith I've got pain in my body I'm getting hold this one's gotta die amen you you won't have the it like this and the change as a matter of fact you notice the Bible brother wait I want you to go and look at that that when he speaks of the body after the resurrection it never says flesh and blood because there's no more blood in your bloodstream after that you see the blood is not the life but the life is in the blood but when the Redemption comes in and the change of the body it's the Holy Ghost that will be in you amen that moves you therefore you'll never go whole you know if you know I was talking to a friend that works with me and you know his uncle you know owns the funeral home in linstead and so he used to go on part-time and help him to embalm the bodies and he was telling me how he does it he said first you've got to get out all the blood he said there's some archers that you're going to get into and you pump all the blood out of the body you know why because if the blood is there that body is going to decay so they take out all that blood and they put in the embalming fluid and when the embalming fluid is in that body you can set it aside in the corner for as long as you want to it will never decay amen you see that's what God is going to do man in your change they will remove the blood out of your body and the Holy Ghost will be what's the life inside of you you'll never grow old but he's going to restore your youth like he's done the eagle yeah it's not as though you've been 50 years and a few days I'm going to be 58. man I've had some rough days but he's going to restore that to my youth but he's going to remove all the trials and the tests and amen I can just imagine some of you take your pictures when you are young and put it there you're going to look better than that I tell you because some of you when you were eating you you really was a good looking but in that renewed body Richard you'll be good looking I'm not saying you're not amen Hallelujah so I ain't going to take no picture back there you know last week uh sister Rexall give me a picture of me when I was about 18 years old in a three-piece suit and mother said I know why she married me [Laughter] the young boy was looking real good boy in my change I'm going to be better than that I'm gonna beat that fellow header amen God has some great things in store for you and I Hallelujah so in John 14 18 to 20 musicians you can come let's just close right here he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a little while and the world sets me no more but you see me because I live he shall live also at that day this day when the Revelation come forth yes you will know I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you Hallelujah in Christ

see you brother James Williams with us God bless you brother your sister there but you know the world's building bombs but they're building shelters they're building so many feets that concrete they're taking these old bunkers and they're making them into places that you can make it through the Holocaust or whatever it is you know make it through the the nuclear war that's coming or or whatever more and something they're building this and building that and building this and building that and the rich folks thinks they're all going to be the same on the ones that can stay around because they build the biggest shelters we build ours to feathers yes we build ours with feathers greatest shelter there ever was under the wings of Mama Eagle thank God for a prophet that was standing out there one day and he saw that great big eagle yes and he saw the one he said oh it'd been beat down because of the storm you know it had it had to land but they sometimes you might get a storm it may beat you down and it may knock you to the ground it may put you in a tree but I promise you that eagle never was not an eagle doesn't matter how low he was sitting on the ground he was sitting in a tree or he was soaring in the height he was still an eagle and when that storm went away brother Brown said what'd he do he said he knew what he had he said he pitched off that limb and said he never flapped his wings and went down and hit the current well let's hit the current but you guys spread them first you got to know that you're an eagle number one you got to have confidence that you're an eagle you got to have confidence that those two Wings will take you wherever you need to go man can't ever build an airplane like God can build a a bird you take a little bird they'll just do this right here and they'll go right between two trees you can't do that with an airplane but they can do it we got little hummingbirds all over the place at the house what a mystery the hummingbird well the body this big wings that big and they're flapping at several hundred thousand beats per second you can't even see the wings but they just zip around back and forth you know but you know what God created that that's right God created that they created him for him to be that way he created us to do what get out of here yeah yeah our purpose on that thirst is to leave this earth that's what our purpose is not stay here it's to leave so let's give brother Keith another big hand God bless you good to have each and every one of you here we're going to take communion now if you want to go ahead and and um a musicians can can exit off the stage and we'll turn to First Corinthians um 11. verse 23. I said Thank you thank you brother James good for good to see you man I haven't seen you in a little bit good to have you with us he's been here many times before so he's not a visitor he's with family now he's he's comfortable he's good but good to have him with us and and the sister with us too God bless you but we're going to take communion Apostle Paul tells us for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread now what's Paul doing Paul wasn't in the upper room right Paul wasn't there he by Revelation God's showing him a vision of what's going on so there had to be the right interpretation he had to give it to a prophet to give us the correct interpretation of what went on in that upper room and when he had given thanks he breaking and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and hit when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament he knew he had to die remember we've been talking about a testament that's not enforced without the death of a testator so he knew he was going to die so this new testament can come about this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily okay shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself but as our brother said but God but God has allowed us to be able to take communion and not be not be condemned if you'll do it right that's forgiveness amen for as often you eat this bread and drink this cup you just show the Lord's death wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and sold any meat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat us and drink contamination what to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now who's the Lord's body we are all right we're the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world separation all right wherefore my brother when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you may that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come let's just take a moment of silence brother said pray for you Pastor pray for your brothers ask God to forgive you your sins so that we can take this communion without having any condemnation father just be with us as a body of believers forgive us of our mistakes and faults and our sins Lord we stand here Lord complete in you father not looking at any of our inadequacies or or the things that we complexes and different things Lord we look to you the Altar and finisher of our faith father just be with us now in the furthermen of this service in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and he blessed it heavily followed this bread Lord was not made in some Factory or come down some line and then was frozen and and put in a box Lord it was made with holy hands it was prepared Lord in a way that when we take it Lord whatever is left over Lord will burn him because if we don't want to hold it over until tomorrow Connor I pray now go today right now this this bread Lord that as we partake it Lord that it'll become or something new to us let us walk Lord in newness of life when we take this and realize that you you hung on Calvary for our sins father all of our sin and Lord that your blood was shed Lord that as our brother said this the life that's in that blood is what gives us strength father just bless it now in Jesus name amen I know I've said this before about there's a new ones here we mom dad was a deacon in the Baptist Church so he was in charge of the communion and you know bro John and I remember them getting the little wafer box out of the freezer and open it up you know like I'm I'm sorry but like a chicken pot pie you know you open the thing up there's all this doughy squares not knowing where it come from or who made it or or what was going on but that's that was their revelation of the bread and then what we didn't use we sure didn't have a revelation of because we just stuck it back in freezer and used it the next month at the Baptist church and then mama would pour the Welch's grape juice into the cups halfway up because you had to cut it so then so then Baptists didn't get choked so but I didn't know we're going to take real wine the real wine never gets old because that Welch's grape juice it has an expiration date on it right this does not have an expiration date but it's Revelation it's thank God for a prophet he sent us a prophet to tell us these things amen and show us that it always was in the types in the Bible of the manor and all the things there not not drinking uh great juice but drinking wine because it gets better then we then he preached on stimulation of Revelation and all that going together there we we see that the Lord absolutely give us the real meaning of this right here right not just to take it because we have to need to but we want to all right come boldly to the throne of grace that's right you're handling father thanks for this wine Lord it was prepared Lord maybe even several months ago but lord it's got better and better with age just as Revelation Lord it just gets better and better Lord it gets gooder and gooder I pray that you Sanctified to our bodies Lord and be with this group of people or may we may we come under that sanctification that we were talking about Lord they'll Clean us out Lord and set us aside for service more than we ever have before father pray in Jesus name and come morning oh well by the river I'll rest boy what a day the Ever Green Tree I'll carry through the midnight come morning there's glory for me [Music] sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how get weary sometimes don't we take one more one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning thank God we had a prophet tell us Rapture is going to take place in the morning sometime between six and nine o'clock and we're just going to step over into another dimension I was somewhere the other day and someone in Baptist or Methodist he was talking about the wedding supper wanting to know what we was going to eat and how we was going to serve it thank God for a prophet he said we're taking communion so I'm not worried about the rest of it miles long the table miles long a table spread for the saints of God are fed amen he invites his chosen people amen come and die Bread and Wine boy talking about turning the water into wine for a for a a wedding supper this would be millions of people for miles that we'll have wine and it'll never be it'll never be exhaustible it'll be inexhaustible and we'll be able to just Hey listen he was down here one day and we needed bread and he just kept breaking it off and handing it to the people then it's got 5 000 people he he took that bread and like brother Brown said he said whatever molecule that was that burst in his hand it cooked it while he had it in his hand and man it just didn't give you something doughy he gave you the bread that was already cooked and the fish it was already fried or broiled for those of you that are trying to lose weight but that's all just a little microcosm of what we're going to see on the other side we can't fathom it much but we're trying us as ministers we're trying to get you to see right that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are why this whole thing you're why the Bible was written yes you're literally literally the Bible we won't be carrying Bibles around in heaven I don't believe we become the Bible and as we become the Bible we are the pages and we're all those were written Epistles and we're going to be able to tell our story John's going to be able to tell his Paul Peter all the different ones and be able to tell their story and that will be things that are not written in this by In This Book right here it's like Keith and I were talking to you you only you need the blood you need salvation here you won't need salvation there you'll be done I've told you many times before you didn't need Faith you needed Faith this morning to get your clothes on get in the car start the car and get to church right you had your faith amen all right now when you got here you can't say well I gotta have faith to get to church no we're here that's right all right now we may have to have faith to get back home but you don't have to have faith when you're standing in it and that's why that that brother Keith and we all we're all in one mind and one Accord we're trying to get this thing back together where man's trying to say no we're going to get it over there correct and buy with me we're going to get it over there it's for them I like where brother around said this day amen the Bible says at that day well at that day is today this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears yes the scripture of the bridegroom and bride coming together has been fulfilled today will you grab a hold of it or will you let your day of visitation pass you by what's left up to you we're going to take communion and then we'll sisters will go downstairs with foot washing and they'll get ready for the for the anniversary um get together downstairs for for Mom and Dad after we're finished God bless you thank you for all of you for coming thank you for the uh message that brother Keith gave us two two messages poured his heart out and uh what'd you do get it perfect God knows God knows that was all we had and it was the last one Ryan got it when hey we serve a good God we serve it God did while he was setting while he was sitting somewhere in his Earthly Journey he looked out and said they're only going to need 44 cups to that that day so that's exactly what we needed was 44 cups so let's take communion thank you Lord now while they're taking up the the yeah team the Bible tells us in in John chapter 13 said thank you except for being ended the devil in heaven now put in the heart of Judas is carry Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand look and that he was come from God somebody said that today didn't he okay that he was come from God and went to God now whatever the whatever speaks at the bride groomed now he's the bride groom were the bride a prophet of God told us those two comes together same scripture speaks of him speaks of us so guess what realize today that you come from God and you're going back to God he rises from supper and laid aside his Garmin took a towel and girded himself after that he pours water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to walk them with a towel with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord thus thou wash my feet Peter's fixing to he's fixing to get a lesson because he's fixing to write this a few years later so he's getting a lesson on that statue of perfect man humility brotherly kindness Temperance patience all in this one little group right here then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saying him Lord do you wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now he knew that but Thou shalt know Hereafter second Peter 1. Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell Jesus never because he's fixing to tell you something don't ever say never all right you shall never wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part he made it pretty plain pretty straightforward and and no beating around the bush as we say in the south he said if I don't wash your feet you'll have no part with me in other words your part with me will be cut off that's why it's so important um Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head in other words just pour it all over me now Jesus said unto him he that is washed and he is not saved to wash his feet but it's clean ever wet and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment was set down he said unto them know you what I've done to you he's asking him a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am he's coming down to the end of his journey sometimes he wouldn't he'd tell him not to call me this and don't call me that he said you call me mastering Lord he said so I am I'm I'm he I'm him all right if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily barely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord needless he that sent greater than he that sent him I like this scripture here it's up on the screen I want you to say this with me if you know these things sad oh I'm sorry happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the word of God we've heard we pray that you should blessed brother Keith they're going to be taking a little r r at our house for a couple of days Lord I pray that you just give him strength and bless him Lord as he continues back home Lord Wednesday and sister Francine goes to to Canada Lord we pray that you'd be with them Lord bless their little business they have back there in Jamaica Lord if it'll prosper and father that all things will work well just be with each one that's here father be with the ones Lord that is sick that couldn't be here to take communion Lord I pray Lord that in their heart that they would realize that you are the Savior and the Healer and the Redeemer and Lord all those Redemptive blessings will come to them Lord if they'll just ask thank you for bringing each one here Lord I pray as they go home that the wheels turn and the guardian angels will be right there on each wheel taking them to their destination father be with each one Lord that's sin sick father we know we have many needs Lord I pray that you just sanctifies for this journey Lord be with brother Aaron wins tonight as he comes and speaks and the meeting coming up this weekend my brother Jason Jackson Lord coming in on Saturday we pray Lord that you give us Lord a supernatural meeting Lord for Saturday and Sunday and that you'll come Among Us Lord and and that you'll heal the sick raise the dead or cast out Spirits his brother Ron was preaching that's our commission you told us to do that Lord to believe in your name father and we do the great and and wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen your sisters are dismissed go downstairs make sure I always say be reverent no talking no laughing
