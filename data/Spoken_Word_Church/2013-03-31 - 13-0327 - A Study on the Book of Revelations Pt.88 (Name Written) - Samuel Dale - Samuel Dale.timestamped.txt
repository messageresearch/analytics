[29:47] form of surgeries or anything they just
[29:49] have your way we love you and we thank
[29:51] you in Jesus name okay
[29:57] Revelation one
[30:02] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[30:04] gave unto him to show unto his servant
[30:06] stains which was shortly come to pass
[30:08] and he sin and signified it by his angel
[30:11] unto his servant John
[30:13] who by record of the word of God in the
[30:15] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[30:18] things that he saw did you see that read
[30:21] us today they hear the words of this
[30:23] prophecy and keep those things which are
[30:25] written therein while for the time is at
[30:28] hand now let's go back where we were
[30:30] reading there last Wednesday
[30:32] and uh Revelations 19 starting in verse
[30:36] 11.
[30:40] and I saw heaven open and behold of my
[30:42] horse and he had set up on him was
[30:44] called faithful and true
[30:45] and in righteousness he's a judge and
[30:48] make war
[30:49] his eyes were as a flame of fire
[30:52] and on his head were many crowns
[30:55] and he had a name written that no man
[30:57] knew but he himself now remember that no
[31:01] man knew it nobody knew this name this
[31:04] bit he himself
[31:06] and he's closer the vegetarian dipped in
[31:08] Blood and his name is called the word of
[31:10] God and the armies which were in heaven
[31:12] followed him upon white horses clothed
[31:15] in fine linen
[31:17] white and clean and out of his mouth go
[31:19] at the sharp sword remember how we were
[31:22] trying to bring out the other day people
[31:23] to believe that literally we're going to
[31:25] come back and fight a babble we're going
[31:28] to have a ward there's going to be a
[31:30] battle of us riding down and do it but
[31:32] notice where the sword comes from go
[31:35] back to the two witnesses in Revelations
[31:37] 11. and out of their mouth precedes fire
[31:41] this is not a form of just a battle of
[31:45] peoples because we'd be glorified just
[31:48] like he is and out of his mouth goes a
[31:51] sharp sword that with him he should
[31:53] Smite the Nations and he shall rule them
[31:55] with a rod of iron and he threaded the
[31:57] wine crash of the fierceness and Wrath
[31:59] of almighty God he hath on his Vester
[32:01] and on his thigh a name written
[32:04] king of kings and Lord of lords you may
[32:08] be seated before that is blessing to the
[32:10] reading of the word
[32:12] now I was trying to explain something
[32:15] there and I I've tried before to explain
[32:18] you know and I'm not a theologian I'm
[32:21] not anything of a form ninth grade
[32:23] education but I I can read you know and
[32:28] and I believe that's what that we fail
[32:31] to do is reading with understanding we
[32:36] try to read to figure things out
[32:39] instead of just reading to let God
[32:41] explain it to us
[32:43] because he's saying what he means and
[32:45] he's meaning what he says and he's not
[32:48] changing it or anything he's just saying
[32:50] it but the Bible is so beautiful and
[32:53] back up I don't know it's been probably
[32:55] 10 years ago or something
[32:57] the Lord began to show me something
[32:59] about the writing of the scriptures and
[33:02] I've tried to explain that and you know
[33:05] to you and I down through the time and
[33:08] uh you know in doing it it's it's kind
[33:10] of like
[33:11] you know you've got in the Bible you've
[33:13] got the seven compound names of Jehovah
[33:16] all right now a lot of them are not even
[33:19] written out you know maybe Jehovah
[33:21] vijayra Jehovah tishka knew is really
[33:24] written out and you know as he speaks it
[33:27] but you've got to go to the commentators
[33:30] or the the
[33:32] people of writings and then you you can
[33:35] see that that that's what that's talking
[33:37] about that's right you know it gives the
[33:39] definition of it whereas we're reading
[33:42] it from an English form
[33:44] that's been translated from a Hebrew you
[33:49] know our Greek form of the Bible and as
[33:51] we read those things then we're we're
[33:54] limited to our English vocabulary in
[33:57] their ways but God has ways of doing
[34:00] things so you know when you're reading
[34:02] it
[34:03] the seven compound names of Jehovah
[34:07] well each one of those has a special
[34:10] reference
[34:12] to the people of God the Healer the
[34:15] Savior the Redeemer our Banner uh you
[34:18] know uh our peace our righteousness amen
[34:21] and all comes from bringing down to us
[34:25] words that you and I couldn't read
[34:30] and uh but thank God for those that
[34:33] labored and brought it we were watching
[34:35] that video the other night of the what
[34:38] is it the indestructible Bible or
[34:41] indestructible book
[34:42] that is out if you'd like to see it and
[34:45] it really explains the coming down with
[34:47] the Bible the writing of it and bringing
[34:49] it down and and the things and I would
[34:52] suggest that you get it and it comes on
[34:54] down to showing uh the different ones as
[34:57] they brought it out for you and I and
[34:59] you thank God you know for that I mean
[35:01] you ought to them because you know they
[35:05] are looking at things and trying to
[35:07] translate
[35:09] to us what this was said in Hebrew or in
[35:13] Greek and and bringing it down to the
[35:16] English language and it's very horrible
[35:19] language to start with
[35:21] because of our problems with it but see
[35:25] they had things dire that you can go to
[35:27] languages and like in us you know bored
[35:30] you heard it you know uh come on board
[35:32] pay your board I'm bored with you stand
[35:36] on the board you know all that one word
[35:38] but when they were writing the Greeks
[35:41] and the Hebrews and I that doesn't have
[35:43] a 14 different combination meaning you
[35:47] know
[35:48] it wasn't done that way it was brought
[35:52] down for our understanding and that's
[35:54] what I was trying to do Wednesday night
[35:56] to express a little bit to where that we
[35:59] could see it but to see it by Revelation
[36:01] not to just talk about wordings or how
[36:04] this is spelled or that is spelled or
[36:06] what goes on you know but to look at the
[36:09] Bible
[36:10] and that's what I want us to do I've
[36:13] always tried to get us to do is to read
[36:15] the Bible and let God speak to our
[36:18] hearts read The Prophet's message let
[36:21] God speak their hearts hear the tapes
[36:23] and things let God speak to our hearts
[36:26] of what those things are that's in the
[36:29] word right then we find out it don't
[36:31] have to be changed added to or anything
[36:33] it doesn't have to do anything it's
[36:35] beautiful
[36:36] I mean and it's it's a marvelous Bible
[36:41] or book Amen to express God unto mankind
[36:44] because that's his ways of doing it now
[36:47] everybody don't pay attention
[36:50] two things because uh that's not their
[36:54] thoughts or ideas
[36:56] but I've always
[36:57] watched in the writing of the Bible and
[37:01] you'll see that there'll be uh instances
[37:04] or cases whatever you call it that were
[37:07] it will be bold print
[37:10] you know and you'll see that it will be
[37:13] in a capitalization form of of all of
[37:16] the words like God will be g-e-o with a
[37:19] big D you know and and think and it'll
[37:22] be Lord will be that way and then right
[37:24] below it it'll turn right back another
[37:26] way
[37:27] you know and you you just look at that
[37:29] and you say well well you know that
[37:31] doesn't mean anything to me
[37:33] it's just the word god well it meant
[37:35] something to them or they wouldn't have
[37:37] put it that way
[37:39] married to burning bush if you'll notice
[37:41] in your writings it'll say I am that I
[37:43] am well that's in bold print right and
[37:47] brother Randall says that is
[37:49] jvhv now he'll say jvhu or jvhv no just
[37:54] use it both ways and he'll say they can
[37:58] never pronounce that amen he said nobody
[38:00] has ever been able to pronounce that
[38:02] name amen and said the best they could
[38:05] do was Jehovah you know from that and
[38:09] and bringing it out but the scripture
[38:11] says by my name was Jehovah would I
[38:13] never know right and and you know even
[38:16] if it's writing I had heard it before or
[38:18] even this video about it that when those
[38:21] scribes would write you know they wrote
[38:23] the Scrolls they didn't have no printing
[38:24] presses and different things you know
[38:26] they had the handwrite
[38:28] I don't know
[38:30] those writers when they would come to
[38:33] the word god
[38:35] they would stop go take a bath wash
[38:38] totally change clothes come back and
[38:41] write that word God because it meant so
[38:44] much to them
[38:46] all right see if we had that much
[38:49] reverence and respect about God's word
[38:52] it might change us a lot right you know
[38:55] about it but now in doing that see I've
[39:00] tried to explain it that way and I know
[39:02] that I don't have no way to express but
[39:04] what I see and I was trying to use them
[39:07] some of them later said well you need to
[39:08] explain that and the others said
[39:10] you know what you were saying was not
[39:13] right you know and I was using what
[39:15] would be known as the to me I was using
[39:17] the uppercase which would be bold uh
[39:21] letters with capital yep you know like
[39:24] g-o-d with a big D see
[39:27] and
[39:28] then I see that you would see the word
[39:30] God in another place
[39:33] and it would be g-o a little reverse
[39:35] small D you know and uh
[39:38] I use uppercase and lowercase and they
[39:41] said that wasn't the correct way but
[39:43] that's brother Dale's way
[39:45] okay that's my way of trying to decide
[39:49] to you and especially they said I was
[39:53] incorrect when I got into the New
[39:55] Testament with it to showing that that
[39:57] you know the name of Jesus Christ and
[40:00] all and I said that's a middle case
[40:02] because it's not lower and it's not
[40:05] upper
[40:06] it was the way they devised to write it
[40:08] but that's right now the main thing I
[40:12] want you to do is just think
[40:15] and I know now I'm telling you no so
[40:18] I've checked it so you know
[40:21] some said well my Bible don't read like
[40:23] yours
[40:24] about the italicized letters or the
[40:26] different things well that's true all
[40:28] right now I use a Scofield bible
[40:32] a 1909
[40:35] which is the first that I know of a
[40:38] Scofield bible there is no 1611
[40:40] Schofield Bible
[40:42] the Scofield wasn't back there you know
[40:45] that's right you kind of come on well
[40:48] later a few hundred years later but the
[40:52] the Scofield bible then it will change
[40:54] from and I notice I checked with wage
[40:56] and he's got to he's got the 1917 right
[40:58] all right see there's there's about
[41:01] three different Scofield Bibles that's
[41:03] right all right but the 1909 is the
[41:06] original now if you'll remember the 1909
[41:09] was the one they chose to send out the
[41:12] spoken word if you wanted to buy it
[41:13] right because that was the Year brother
[41:15] random was born
[41:16] all right that was fine and all the
[41:18] doings but I'm just telling you that if
[41:20] you got one of those Bibles get it down
[41:23] and look at it and you'll see that it
[41:25] shows what I'm talking about right but I
[41:27] have the Scofield Study Bible
[41:30] which means he's put a lot of references
[41:32] in in his own footnotes all right but
[41:36] see I've had people to tell me say well
[41:38] I've got to Scofield 1611.
[41:41] oh yeah so I just took it up on my hands
[41:44] one day and I called schofields Jonathan
[41:47] publication everybody yeah and I just
[41:50] asked him well I guess they thought this
[41:53] foreign
[42:05] as far as I know 1909 is the first
[42:08] Schofield Bible all right but now you
[42:11] get some of the others and it won't
[42:12] verify some of the other you know Bibles
[42:15] Thompson Channing there's no difference
[42:17] in the wording right it's just an
[42:19] expression right all right and in doing
[42:21] that then see I tried to bring out some
[42:23] things
[42:25] but the main thing is to see the
[42:27] revelation of one true and living God
[42:28] that's it right all right now I'll go
[42:32] through this in a minute but see back in
[42:34] the beginning he would be called Elohim
[42:38] and that would be self-existing yep
[42:41] all right
[42:43] let's see once he created man
[42:47] right and came down into a certain
[42:50] positions there with man
[42:53] he would never be known as self-existing
[42:56] amen right yeah they could put the word
[42:58] down right but it would always say
[43:01] something that would make it show up in
[43:04] a deeper meaning and it would bring out
[43:07] that he is
[43:08] not self-existing anymore right because
[43:11] actually the word Jehovah means like a
[43:14] father with his family that's what it
[43:15] actually means and see that way then
[43:18] he'll never be self-existing
[43:21] and even after all time is over with and
[43:24] everything
[43:26] he'll still be father with his family
[43:29] you know because that that's the point
[43:32] that he's wanting us to see
[43:34] he's wanting us to see how much he
[43:36] becomes in relationship amen
[43:38] with the seven compound names of Jehovah
[43:41] each one of them has a relationship to
[43:43] mankind that's right Amanda to express
[43:46] God to me and you he's our banner and
[43:49] he's our Earth righteousness he's our
[43:51] peace amen thank you
[43:53] all right but that's in different places
[43:55] in the Bible
[43:57] you know you know then you got to look
[43:59] through and see that
[44:01] and you said well how come we need this
[44:04] well
[44:06] you know I believe we need to understand
[44:08] the revelation of God Amen all right now
[44:14] in himself revealing himself to you and
[44:16] I
[44:19] am but then the point that I think that
[44:21] you ought to at least Rejoice about is
[44:23] to realize that when it finishes up in
[44:26] Revelations 19.
[44:29] which is when he comes riding back into
[44:31] the Millennium that we just read
[44:35] that it's totally in bold type form to
[44:38] show and capitalization
[44:41] that when we come back riding with him
[44:43] he will be King of Kings yes amen
[44:47] amen and Lord of lords amen
[44:51] because everyone who's riding with him
[44:53] is of the same
[44:59] the same God
[45:03] that's right
[45:06] and see the prophet of God said it like
[45:09] this I didn't bring everything but he
[45:11] said God wanted us to be amateur Gods
[45:14] right
[45:15] little God a little Messiah
[45:19] we know and realize that we'll never be
[45:22] him to take his place that's where your
[45:25] Catholicism comes emcee right right that
[45:28] they say you know to take the place of
[45:29] God we we're not trying to take the
[45:31] place of God right
[45:34] no we're trying to be what we are
[45:36] supposed to be for the hour right right
[45:37] amen now notice brother random I'll read
[45:40] these in a minute but I'm just giving
[45:41] you a little lay ahead
[45:43] he said if the Lord spoke to him and
[45:45] showed him the Jehovah the old is Jesus
[45:47] of the new
[45:51] they made an outstanding statement I'll
[45:53] read to you in a minute
[45:54] he said Jehovah the old is Jesus within
[45:57] you
[45:58] in the Holy Ghost of this day is the
[46:00] same
[46:06] if he was Jehovah the only Jesus of you
[46:08] he's still got to be Jehovah the old and
[46:11] Jesus of the news
[46:12] right amen that's what I tried to
[46:16] explain the other day I guess it's
[46:18] confusing about
[46:20] you know
[46:21] Israel in her joining too but will never
[46:24] become the bride of Christ
[46:26] but yet he was married to her yep
[46:29] and he brought it out and how many wives
[46:32] do you have in the Bible
[46:34] in other words when you say Jehovah the
[46:35] old that's Jehovah was right you look
[46:37] like that's a bride over there and then
[46:39] another bride over here
[46:41] well you better remember that some was
[46:43] in that group over here
[46:47] once he walked on the shore to Galilee
[46:50] wound up over here right right so then
[46:53] don't get all these weddings and and
[46:55] deals in your mind don't get all of that
[46:58] actually just think about what's going
[47:00] on
[47:02] me
[47:03] and what he's doing and how he's
[47:05] revealing himself
[47:07] to come down through
[47:09] and that's all that I've ever had any
[47:11] interest in trying to do is to get
[47:14] people to see
[47:15] what he's saying about you and I right
[47:18] now how many times have I made this
[47:21] statement The Book of Revelations is the
[47:24] bride's book amen if you want to know
[47:27] where you're at and what you're doing
[47:29] you see why they told us to stay out of
[47:32] that book right
[47:35] you see why they took that book away
[47:37] from us and all of the things because
[47:39] they knew if we ever read it we'd find
[47:41] out it's talking about us right man
[47:47] yep I'll get to it over one of these
[47:49] days you know when it comes over in
[47:51] Revelation 21 and 22 right through there
[47:54] that John will describe the city yeah
[47:56] and it's exactly the same as he
[47:58] describes the wife the bride's wife
[48:01] he describes a writers to say Mr City
[48:03] amen
[48:05] why because
[48:07] once we get there
[48:10] right
[48:13] will not only be his
[48:15] bride
[48:19] well not only be his wife
[48:23] will he will be his brothers and sisters
[48:25] yep right we'll be his offspring amen
[48:31] we'll all be in the same race
[48:34] amen amen because that's what it means
[48:36] Aaron in the scripture
[48:41] when it's talking about The Offspring it
[48:42] means race Nation man people
[48:46] amen see God doesn't separate us from
[48:50] him
[48:51] once he joins with us amen
[48:55] there's no separation
[48:59] once he gave you the baptism with the
[49:01] Holy Ghost he's not going to take it
[49:03] back that's right right amen thank the
[49:05] Lord
[49:08] because the very purpose of giving it to
[49:10] you is to bring us to the place of being
[49:12] his offspring amen right right
[49:16] and Paul could slum it up and say it's
[49:19] no longer I that liveth the Christ that
[49:22] liveth in me
[49:27] he saw who he was by what God had made
[49:31] him
[49:32] nobody was naturally born because he
[49:35] didn't see that when he was a right
[49:37] Pharisee of the Pharisee and the Hebrew
[49:39] the Hebrews you know all of that that
[49:41] he's told about is his first life you
[49:43] know for doing
[49:45] it was after his new birth
[49:47] man after all I'm trying to get you and
[49:50] I to see
[49:52] is to look at the Bible and read it
[49:55] and like I've always said and he
[49:57] remembers when you you got baptized in
[50:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[50:02] all right you know you read the Bible
[50:04] before then but the word the little word
[50:06] m-a-m-e you know name
[50:09] it didn't Stand Out did it
[50:15] you knew it was there you read it they
[50:17] were like but then all at once when you
[50:19] begin to see the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:22] Christ
[50:25] whatever where you're at old and you it
[50:27] would say it's not him
[50:29] you get back on the Old Testaments his
[50:31] name is in here my name is amen
[50:36] look in that way see we're looking at it
[50:38] and seeing God revealed
[50:41] that's where you your Trinity runs it
[50:44] all see and takes it over the wrong way
[50:46] but the Oneness went over the other way
[50:49] you see the problem with the Oneness is
[50:52] the basis of them carrying it over to
[50:54] the point that they believe that Jesus
[50:56] was the last manifestation of God right
[50:59] yeah all right
[51:02] but see I don't agree with that yeah
[51:04] right okay I believe we right now amen
[51:07] in this day are the life manifestation
[51:10] of God then when we leave out of here
[51:12] there's an Israel to be saved right amen
[51:14] you know 144 thousand
[51:17] they will be
[51:20] brought into that place
[51:24] and they'll be the amorphy of God
[51:27] see
[51:29] that's all I'm trying to get us to look
[51:31] at is to see Who We Are see what the new
[51:34] EST made us
[51:35] Lord will we get to it Sunday about the
[51:37] first resurrection
[51:43] and seeing what he has made us amen
[51:51] he's made us according to Revelations
[51:54] chapter 5.
[51:55] that he's made us priests and Kings amen
[52:01] that's the bride and glory after the
[52:03] Rapture right amen
[52:06] but yet those are not
[52:10] illuminated by capitalization or or
[52:13] higher order of writing
[52:18] but in Revelations it is
[52:22] you know the 19th Chapter
[52:25] see because it's it's the process is
[52:28] still in in coming forward right
[52:33] sitting in the 19 chapters we were
[52:35] trying to cover the other day about the
[52:37] seventh verse it says
[52:39] the marriage of the Lamb has come
[52:43] and the wife
[52:45] has made himself ready right
[52:48] well that happens here while we're on
[52:51] Earth amen right not something how do we
[52:53] get up there
[52:55] so here on Earth we've got to get
[52:56] prepared all right
[52:59] but it's not brought into full
[53:01] manifestation
[53:04] until we we joined with him so much and
[53:08] then when we're coming back riding with
[53:09] him and you can't separate you know
[53:11] right I'll read to you in a minute
[53:12] whatever names he got we got that same
[53:14] name amen
[53:16] that's right yeah
[53:19] we're Miss Jesus now but if he gets a
[53:22] new name you know we're going to be
[53:23] missed somebody else
[53:25] right if there's a new name
[53:29] because it'll have to stay that way for
[53:31] us to be one with him
[53:33] yeah
[53:34] that's why then I've always just try to
[53:36] get you to see the one God see where
[53:37] Jesus would say
[53:39] in you
[53:42] now that's not hard to understand is it
[53:44] especially after knowing you know the
[53:46] denomination would teach it that way let
[53:48] me buy the new birth you know you could
[53:49] say I in you
[53:51] but what about you and me
[53:55] because Jesus put the same emphasis on
[53:57] the last part of that verse that he did
[53:58] the first right
[54:00] uh in you
[54:01] and you and me right amen
[54:05] now
[54:06] if we don't see how that we become one
[54:09] here you remember what I was talking
[54:11] about the other night about the wedding
[54:13] and the time that the prophet said you
[54:15] and I would Unite Here
[54:19] with him through the revealed word amen
[54:24] and then we'll go
[54:25] to the marriage of the Lamb
[54:28] that's why I try to emphasize that is to
[54:31] to not leave it and and I gave you the
[54:33] quotes for the prophet said we're
[54:34] already married to him that's right by
[54:37] the new birth
[54:40] but that's not the end of it
[54:42] right
[54:43] it's going to be a marriage of the Lambs
[54:46] is that two different weddings then
[54:48] no it's just different stages
[54:52] of the same people right
[54:55] right
[54:57] same groom it's just different stages
[55:02] but see we're uniting with him here amen
[55:05] because that's where we're making ready
[55:11] but then after all of that said and done
[55:13] then you get into chapter 19 of the 16th
[55:16] verse
[55:17] and he's coming back writing
[55:19] and we just read right up above our
[55:21] that's a group of people with him all
[55:24] right
[55:27] but see then to look at it see then you
[55:30] can read the scripture
[55:32] and you can see that it was God's plan
[55:34] from the very beginning right
[55:38] right to bring it down to where
[55:41] that he would show his plan even before
[55:45] it was made manifest
[55:48] amen
[55:53] in that way the writers then when they
[55:55] would the the one spring and forth more
[55:58] Bibles like Schofield didn't write
[55:59] another Bible he didn't come forth with
[56:01] another translation the Thompson Chain
[56:05] um different that's not another
[56:07] translation that's somebody translate
[56:09] that somebody put him down into letter
[56:11] form and then putting comments with it
[56:14] and things like that it's not the
[56:16] writing of a new Bible
[56:19] and your study reference Bibles is just
[56:22] giving you more understanding of why
[56:26] this is so you know
[56:29] in a white show
[56:33] and and I put it up front and I repeat
[56:36] it two or three times
[56:39] if you can just see in the Bible
[56:42] that there's a lot of times in the Bible
[56:44] when the very God of Glory is speaking
[56:49] almighty God himself speaking
[56:54] then there's times upon earth when he
[56:56] uses man to speak
[57:00] it's the same God in man
[57:03] right right man you remember the prophet
[57:05] what are you saying or in Hebrews where
[57:07] it said in saunderton dollars matter
[57:09] he's paid by he said that's incorrect he
[57:12] said it should have been in right
[57:16] is it because he wasn't just speaking by
[57:17] them
[57:18] that could be a Balaam that could be a
[57:21] or anybody speaking
[57:22] but when he was speaking in them
[57:25] but I said Moses was God to the people
[57:29] right amen right
[57:33] that's what the scripts are saying
[57:36] will you be God and Aaron to meet your
[57:38] profit right right but see that way we
[57:40] can read those things now with
[57:42] understanding
[57:44] to be able to see what's going on but
[57:46] it's speaking about us
[57:48] amen
[57:50] he's trying to show himself in
[57:51] relationship to his people
[57:54] and here's a point I'll say over and
[57:56] over
[57:57] when you can see him speaking from
[57:59] heaven
[58:00] you'll see that they'll they'll put
[58:04] capital letters as I say
[58:08] but then when you start dealing with man
[58:10] on Earth
[58:11] it lowers it down right
[58:15] and not always use this
[58:17] look out for the letters because it
[58:20] means god is down here doing something
[58:23] right amen and if you'll notice in in
[58:26] the New Testament
[58:27] the only time that it says that that the
[58:30] the name Jesus when he first said you
[58:32] know we call his name Jesus there's two
[58:34] scriptures there call his name Jesus
[58:37] that's in great big bold letters right
[58:39] amen
[58:42] that was God Of Heaven telling them what
[58:45] the name is that's right
[58:48] but then when he gets down in the next
[58:50] chapter it says Jesus is blue lower top
[58:53] of cash
[58:56] you see Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ
[58:58] is not written out in great big bold
[59:00] letters and mind because God is down
[59:03] here
[59:04] that's right amen
[59:06] so just read your Bible and look at it
[59:08] like that
[59:11] but you can see what's going on
[59:14] and you can see then it's not just a man
[59:16] speaking it's God speaking but then you
[59:20] can see that a man speaks and God uses
[59:23] his voice right amen
[59:25] but it's related to what's happening on
[59:27] Earth
[59:30] and showing it down here
[59:32] where we're at
[59:34] all right right so look over in Genesis
[59:36] now he can get Brothers Johnson them
[59:38] some of this so
[59:39] I'm not trying to put it up because I
[59:41] checked it and I knew that if I put it
[59:43] up by that
[59:45] it would wind up with a lowercase
[59:47] because they're copying they're not
[59:49] using 1909 all the way through on your
[59:52] computer systems tonight
[59:55] it won't bring out what I want you to
[59:58] see
[1:00:00] but remember now you think well he's
[1:00:03] just changing things to make a Doctrine
[1:00:06] well I want to see you man
[1:00:10] after I get through I want to see you
[1:00:12] bring it
[1:00:13] and show me a trinity or a Oneness
[1:00:17] right without the word of God
[1:00:21] because it won't work
[1:00:23] even the writers know better
[1:00:26] a lot of those things we were talking
[1:00:28] about the Beast and the image of the
[1:00:30] Beast is like Scofield have a lot of
[1:00:31] good foot I was on this thing amen
[1:00:34] but they knew a lot of that
[1:00:36] I don't go along with every one of his
[1:00:39] footnote
[1:00:40] but when he's telling me the definition
[1:00:42] of a word
[1:00:45] I listen so look at Genesis 1.
[1:00:50] he said in the beginning God created
[1:00:54] heaven and the Earth
[1:00:58] now if you've got a Scofield bible it'd
[1:01:00] be very easily for you to follow along
[1:01:02] see but if not
[1:01:04] then you'll have to just take what we're
[1:01:06] talking about I guess until you get one
[1:01:07] to look at it
[1:01:10] but as I said now you're here I'm
[1:01:12] dealing with a 1909 version which is the
[1:01:14] first Schofield version and the other
[1:01:17] versions tangents of time of some of
[1:01:20] this the not the spelling but the
[1:01:22] capitalizations or the higher orders and
[1:01:24] things
[1:01:25] but not checked it in the 1611 because a
[1:01:29] lot of people say I've got a 1611 Bible
[1:01:34] are you looking
[1:01:36] it's about that thick
[1:01:39] yeah absolutely
[1:01:40] it's about that square
[1:01:44] and in the 1611 Bible is the book of
[1:01:48] Maccabees
[1:01:50] and the things
[1:01:52] into 1611 if you've got a big one it's
[1:01:55] that's what I'll show you
[1:01:58] now there is some toxin change now I
[1:02:01] know world is you can still possibly
[1:02:03] pick up a 1611 in certain cases
[1:02:07] that will be a regular Bible like this
[1:02:09] you know form a Bible it won't be the
[1:02:11] great big anybody said I got a 1611
[1:02:14] Regional well you got one about that
[1:02:16] thick about that big
[1:02:19] I'll be glad to show it to you Church
[1:02:21] gave it to me a few years ago because
[1:02:22] I've said so much about 16-11 Edition
[1:02:24] you know he looked it up and found it
[1:02:26] all right let me glad for you to look at
[1:02:28] it
[1:02:29] but notice it says in the beginning God
[1:02:34] now that is an English word
[1:02:38] all right and notice it's not the Great
[1:02:42] Big D on the end of it it's not a great
[1:02:44] big letter
[1:02:46] because man now is fixing to reveal
[1:02:49] himself I mean God is going to reveal
[1:02:51] himself to me
[1:02:53] well and he's joining himself down to us
[1:02:56] we look down in your Scofield you guys
[1:02:59] it says the word God there is Elohim
[1:03:06] so you would read it in the beginning
[1:03:07] Elohim
[1:03:10] but you know you also read John 1 1. and
[1:03:13] I'll give it to you off of the uh
[1:03:18] Mighty God unavail where brought around
[1:03:20] says it John 1 1 should read in the
[1:03:23] beginning with Elohim Elohim was with
[1:03:25] Elohim and that wasn't him whatever him
[1:03:27] and that was him was made flesh and
[1:03:28] dwell a moment amen amen he said that
[1:03:30] would be the way you would read it in
[1:03:31] the correct understanding because it
[1:03:33] would show the same God right amen uh
[1:03:35] this is that with him back here which is
[1:03:38] derived from the word
[1:03:42] the English form God
[1:03:45] he said first of the three primary names
[1:03:48] of deity watch now it's not covering
[1:03:51] obesity form is in Europe plural noun
[1:03:55] form from e-l strength our strong one
[1:03:59] and a-l-a-h to swear to bind oneself by
[1:04:03] an old
[1:04:04] Joseph
[1:04:06] so implying faithfulness right
[1:04:09] now
[1:04:10] it's the word Elohim
[1:04:15] but why didn't they
[1:04:17] Capital that one
[1:04:19] as much
[1:04:22] because that's where he's doing it
[1:04:24] right he's revealing himself
[1:04:28] now there's about 32 times in Genesis 1
[1:04:32] so we're going through the Bible a
[1:04:33] little bit tonight
[1:04:35] Genesis 1 is about 32 times the word God
[1:04:38] is used
[1:04:39] and each one of them would be the g o
[1:04:41] with the reverse D part as we would call
[1:04:44] it in my terminology okay the lower case
[1:04:49] all right
[1:04:50] for understanding purposes you start off
[1:04:53] chapter two look at it
[1:04:56] you start off chapter two in this verse
[1:05:00] two
[1:05:03] verse 1 tells you the hell the Earth
[1:05:05] were finished and on the seventh day God
[1:05:07] ended his work which he had made and he
[1:05:10] rested on the seventh day from all his
[1:05:12] work which he had made the little case
[1:05:14] of God and God blessed the Sabbath day
[1:05:17] and Sonic divided all right
[1:05:20] that's on that case so remember up until
[1:05:23] there you're using the word Elohim
[1:05:27] now the word Elohim
[1:05:30] from the word that would be like e-l or
[1:05:33] e-l-a-h
[1:05:37] it's not coming up to the self-existing
[1:05:39] point
[1:05:43] he said well it's just the word God is
[1:05:44] telling him it's self-existing now it
[1:05:46] has a meaning to it
[1:05:48] just like Jehovah Jireh means the Lord
[1:05:51] our sacrifice
[1:05:53] Jehovah
[1:05:55] NASA is our Banner
[1:05:57] it's a different
[1:05:58] form that's being expressed
[1:06:01] but if you've got a Scofield bible
[1:06:03] especially if you ain't then you'd be
[1:06:04] glad to let you have mine later and let
[1:06:06] you look at this but look at it verse
[1:06:08] four these are the generations of the
[1:06:09] heavens and the earth when they were
[1:06:11] created in the day that the Lord God
[1:06:15] made the Earth in the heavens
[1:06:19] Lord God
[1:06:22] capital l o r d
[1:06:26] ude
[1:06:31] he said he made
[1:06:34] the heavens and the Earth
[1:06:39] that's why I love the fact that we were
[1:06:41] standing behind on God has been gone it
[1:06:44] was a Vindicated Prophet amen
[1:06:47] because we would read the scriptures and
[1:06:48] wouldn't have been able to follow them
[1:06:49] and keep it straight right because now
[1:06:52] here this Lord God is the creator
[1:06:55] but according to the Bible all things
[1:06:57] were made by Jesus Christ
[1:06:59] come on
[1:07:01] believe not by the flesh man right
[1:07:06] right but by the word amen God
[1:07:10] all right so then the prophet expresses
[1:07:13] it he said that was great self-existing
[1:07:15] one
[1:07:17] and said out of him came the Halo
[1:07:23] logos
[1:07:26] and begin to create so now your Bible is
[1:07:29] correct and all things were made by
[1:07:31] Jesus Christ who is the word and that's
[1:07:33] right not Jesus a flesh man
[1:07:37] but to Jesus Christ with his word
[1:07:39] see if they can just look past that
[1:07:41] that's why he says to those disciples
[1:07:44] in other words if you could just look
[1:07:45] past what you're looking at you'd see
[1:07:47] who I am that's standing here that's
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:51] but they couldn't do it
[1:07:54] they had no hope whatsoever
[1:07:56] without him dying and coming living in
[1:07:58] them for them to be able to even express
[1:08:00] amen right
[1:08:02] but remember now
[1:08:06] translators
[1:08:08] that brought us the Bible
[1:08:10] doesn't translate by revelation
[1:08:14] they translate by words
[1:08:21] see now if they got in there with their
[1:08:22] own ideas it wouldn't have worked out
[1:08:23] too good about all of the translations
[1:08:25] and then right see they'd like to have
[1:08:27] the book of Maccabees and all them
[1:08:29] things and you know and it wouldn't work
[1:08:33] but then it odd that it picks up and
[1:08:35] look at your Bible if it's not you look
[1:08:37] at mine
[1:08:38] it says the Lord
[1:08:41] which says God
[1:08:45] please
[1:08:47] now we're good
[1:08:50] Schofield says the primary meaning of
[1:08:52] the name Lord the capital l o r d
[1:08:56] Jehovah is the self-existent
[1:09:00] one
[1:09:04] now there's your Elohim coming up see
[1:09:07] literally as Exodus 3 14 he that is who
[1:09:12] he is therefore the Eternal I am
[1:09:15] but h-a-b-a-h from which Jehovah or
[1:09:18] Yahweh is formed signifies also to
[1:09:22] become
[1:09:25] that is
[1:09:26] to become known
[1:09:29] thus pointing to a continuous and
[1:09:32] increasing
[1:09:33] self-revelation
[1:09:38] combining these meanings of however we
[1:09:41] arrive at the meaning of the name
[1:09:43] Jehovah he is the self-existent one who
[1:09:47] reveals himself right
[1:09:51] now that's a man giving you the
[1:09:53] definition
[1:09:54] of a Greek word or a Hebrew word a
[1:09:57] nucleated
[1:10:01] see it and how much of that what the
[1:10:04] prophet said
[1:10:07] he's a self-existing one but Jehovah
[1:10:10] will read him it he says like a father
[1:10:11] with his family amen
[1:10:14] now Genesis 2.
[1:10:16] you remember Man was created in Genesis
[1:10:19] one
[1:10:21] so now he's not self-existing
[1:10:25] he's existing with his family brother
[1:10:28] said he'd come down in the corner of the
[1:10:30] evening what the great Lord God
[1:10:34] would come down in the cool of the
[1:10:35] evening
[1:10:39] now from that part
[1:10:42] there
[1:10:46] Lord God capital l o r d
[1:10:49] four
[1:10:50] and g-o-d in a lower case is what I'm
[1:10:53] calling it
[1:10:55] is used
[1:10:58] in expressing
[1:11:02] all right when you get on over to where
[1:11:05] that God appeared to Abraham
[1:11:08] I'll read you in a minute where the
[1:11:10] Prophet said you say that is God
[1:11:14] somebody asking me he said that's
[1:11:15] exactly right yep
[1:11:18] because it uses l-o-r-d in the capital
[1:11:20] form
[1:11:24] um
[1:11:27] the self-existing one is now existing
[1:11:31] with his family
[1:11:37] but a very amazing thing happens
[1:11:41] when you get on over the first time God
[1:11:45] in the
[1:11:47] capitalist reform that I talk and show
[1:11:49] it the way I say it
[1:11:52] must of the man Abraham
[1:11:56] after in chapter 14 he had met
[1:11:59] Melchizedek
[1:12:01] and called him Lord
[1:12:07] all right you said well the capital
[1:12:08] thing doesn't mean anything blue Dale
[1:12:11] well
[1:12:13] jump over bypass one two three four five
[1:12:15] and go down
[1:12:17] go down number six Brother Anderson
[1:12:18] because we'll get back to those in a
[1:12:20] minute
[1:12:22] this is from a message be not afraid if
[1:12:25] he's 65 1962 three or eight and a zero
[1:12:29] six twenty
[1:12:32] someone said to me not long ago said
[1:12:34] brother random you don't believe that
[1:12:35] that was actually God standing there
[1:12:37] eating the cake now who's that
[1:12:38] melchizing it right 14th chapter
[1:12:41] I said I'm sure do Abraham called him
[1:12:44] Elohim
[1:12:47] that's right
[1:12:48] anyone knows that capital m o r d and
[1:12:52] they didn't even do it yeah that's why
[1:12:54] it gets me
[1:12:56] when he said Capital that's not capital
[1:12:58] l-o-r-d
[1:13:01] yeah at least they could have hit that
[1:13:04] little end on the top to make it come
[1:13:06] out in capital letters you know but they
[1:13:09] didn't do it nice arguing with them they
[1:13:12] just didn't see what he was talking
[1:13:13] about they had they would put it up
[1:13:15] there yeah when I when I put Lord when I
[1:13:18] spelled Lord I put it in
[1:13:21] bubble letters
[1:13:24] me
[1:13:26] look oh that's what I mean
[1:13:29] Abraham called him Elohim that's right
[1:13:31] anyone knows that the capital L O R D
[1:13:33] which is translation David in the Greek
[1:13:36] Elohim which means a self-existing one
[1:13:39] or was it showing their Jesus said as it
[1:13:42] was in the days of Silence you'll feel
[1:13:44] it made the coming of the son of man
[1:13:45] what is it Elohim God appearing in human
[1:13:48] flesh
[1:13:49] yes Church Hallelujah Joy Christ Jesus
[1:13:52] was said in Saint John 14. he that
[1:13:54] believeth on me the works that I usually
[1:13:56] do also
[1:13:58] capital letters mean a lot
[1:14:03] they show how God Appears in what he's
[1:14:07] doing
[1:14:08] now you you go back and you read it
[1:14:13] but it's using the word Lord God
[1:14:17] from chapter two three four five six
[1:14:19] seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:14:21] thirteen fourteen
[1:14:24] and when it starts off in chapter 15
[1:14:26] going in your Bible
[1:14:32] after these things verse one the word of
[1:14:36] the Lord capital of a warranty
[1:14:39] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[1:14:42] not Abraham
[1:14:44] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:14:46] reward
[1:14:48] and Abraham said
[1:14:51] Lord God
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] now remember he's talking to Abraham
[1:14:59] and Abraham said Lord lower case
[1:15:04] God
[1:15:06] uppercase that's the first time it's
[1:15:08] used in the Bible of an uppercase the
[1:15:10] word god
[1:15:13] you know with bringing out what you're
[1:15:15] seeing all right what does that mean go
[1:15:17] down and it says Lord Hebrew Adana I
[1:15:20] don't know a gun or a donut the primary
[1:15:23] meaning of a Don a Don or a
[1:15:26] d-o-n-a-i it's master
[1:15:30] and it's implied in the Old Testament
[1:15:32] scripture both to deity
[1:15:34] into man
[1:15:38] the latter incidents are distinguished
[1:15:40] in the English version
[1:15:43] by the omission of the capital
[1:15:47] as applied to man the word is used of
[1:15:49] two relationships master and husband
[1:15:53] showing the relationship between Christ
[1:15:56] and the believer
[1:15:58] and so I did it comes to Abraham
[1:16:03] and then instead of saying Lord capital
[1:16:05] in the smaller God it changes run around
[1:16:14] because the emphasis is later on what's
[1:16:16] Happening
[1:16:20] God is coming down to Abraham
[1:16:24] the father of the faith
[1:16:26] to set a stage
[1:16:30] that you and I can be the children of
[1:16:32] God
[1:16:36] I didn't say he paid the price now
[1:16:38] right I said he's sending a stage to
[1:16:41] reveal himself
[1:16:44] so he takes it up into the uppercase and
[1:16:47] shows you who's talking
[1:16:51] now the self-existing one truly is now
[1:16:55] existing
[1:16:58] with his children now from there on down
[1:17:03] you'll find from God going through
[1:17:05] basically the Old Testament part you'll
[1:17:08] find the Lord the word Lord
[1:17:10] and you'll find the word God but you
[1:17:12] don't find the word God in
[1:17:13] capitalization too often in life
[1:17:19] because man couldn't understand you
[1:17:27] figure out the word Elohim
[1:17:30] and they could talk about an eternal God
[1:17:35] and David could write in his psalms
[1:17:37] about the Lord God go back to the Psalms
[1:17:40] and look at it and stop in Lord God on
[1:17:42] your computer sometimes I'm going to run
[1:17:43] you through a lot of references
[1:17:47] and David would be trying to sing in the
[1:17:50] spirit
[1:17:53] but just remember what I'm talking about
[1:17:56] that when God starts speaking to Abram
[1:18:01] he's speaking to him from up and down
[1:18:06] right you know he's Eternal he's Beyond
[1:18:10] tensions of mankind
[1:18:13] so the best you can say is he's
[1:18:15] self-existing
[1:18:17] he said but I've already tried to tell
[1:18:19] him in the writing they wrote my
[1:18:23] they don't want to exist anymore
[1:18:29] and Abraham realized what was taking
[1:18:31] place
[1:18:33] and the writers realized what was taking
[1:18:35] place
[1:18:37] that God
[1:18:41] had condescended
[1:18:45] calling down out of his loftiness or
[1:18:48] whatever you call it the height of
[1:18:49] Heaven
[1:18:52] and he's coming down just like he did in
[1:18:54] Genesis
[1:18:56] I preached on it years ago
[1:18:58] you can take the Book of Genesis drill
[1:19:00] chapter 1 and preach five years off of
[1:19:03] it
[1:19:04] because each one of the Creations there
[1:19:07] will reveal God in man
[1:19:09] the animals are things that are revealed
[1:19:11] the moon the stars Etc you can just go
[1:19:14] on and on and on
[1:19:16] preaching off of just a little word god
[1:19:21] but get what I'm talking about
[1:19:25] me
[1:19:28] the great God is Genesis 2 and 4 says
[1:19:31] Lord God Made To Heaven and the Earth
[1:19:38] and that God begins to condescend
[1:19:42] that's the only thing I'm trying to get
[1:19:43] you to see
[1:19:45] we know all about these smart words
[1:19:50] but it is odd how they
[1:19:52] plan up
[1:19:54] may not mean a thing to you
[1:19:59] but one of these days you'll realize why
[1:20:00] brother random will be talking and he'll
[1:20:02] say that to Elohim
[1:20:03] the self-existing one they didn't say
[1:20:06] that's Jehovah
[1:20:10] that's right
[1:20:13] but that was little
[1:20:16] crying in the Cradle amen
[1:20:24] trying to get us to see who it was
[1:20:29] and then a Prophet come along and he'd
[1:20:31] say look Jehovah the old
[1:20:33] he's a Jesus to the news
[1:20:42] look at number seven
[1:20:44] what your Prophet had to say about
[1:20:48] Jehovah what it means
[1:20:52] adoption 1965 515 E I got 100 he gave
[1:20:56] man Jehovah means that he gave man to be
[1:21:00] an amateur God
[1:21:03] because he is Father God
[1:21:08] and he made a man an amateur God
[1:21:13] so he isn't self-existing anymore
[1:21:17] are you reading it right he exists with
[1:21:21] his family amen Elohim
[1:21:24] now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the
[1:21:26] one who exists with his
[1:21:28] Emily
[1:21:31] see and then it odd that he developed it
[1:21:34] through and showed it to Abraham
[1:21:39] that he would really come down to beat
[1:21:41] Jehovah
[1:21:46] that the self-existing one would come
[1:21:49] down and have a family
[1:21:52] thank you
[1:21:56] naked Mansfield to run around said
[1:21:58] Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new
[1:22:01] let me look at number
[1:22:03] look at number 10.
[1:22:05] this is the one I liked
[1:22:08] look at number 10.
[1:22:14] which is who is God preached in 1958 15
[1:22:17] paragraph
[1:22:19] E9 and then raise it up to the bottom
[1:22:23] you're talking about how that need to
[1:22:25] realize the presence and granted you
[1:22:27] know
[1:22:28] that Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus of
[1:22:32] the new the Holy Spirit of this day
[1:22:37] now if they don't click in your heart
[1:22:38] what he's saying
[1:22:42] he says he's here today do you need this
[1:22:45] quote
[1:22:47] exactly like he was
[1:22:51] when he walked the shores of Galilee
[1:22:53] outside of the Corporal body
[1:23:04] but never took the Corporal body
[1:23:06] right but he doesn't need a body he's
[1:23:08] hearing you and I amen
[1:23:11] see did you hold the oldest of Jesus
[1:23:13] unto you
[1:23:20] that one that spoke to Moses from the
[1:23:22] burning bush says I am
[1:23:24] that I am
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:28] isn't it odd Jesus come over and said
[1:23:30] before Abraham was
[1:23:32] right I am yeah
[1:23:37] there's just one true and living God
[1:23:40] it's revealed even in the right adding
[1:23:42] another word man right
[1:23:49] in showing who he is and what's going on
[1:23:53] but coming to Abraham the great father
[1:23:55] of faith
[1:23:56] you're showing him
[1:23:58] that he's Elohim Jehovah
[1:24:03] he's going to have a family
[1:24:10] he's going to have a family to exist
[1:24:13] with amen upon Earth
[1:24:17] all right
[1:24:22] Hebrews 1.
[1:24:25] let's read that one I checked that one
[1:24:28] and it does turn out to be different
[1:24:31] the other writings but
[1:24:35] Hebrews 1
[1:24:39] is what
[1:24:42] I get the Hebrews
[1:24:47] God who at Sandra times and in diverse
[1:24:50] manners spake
[1:24:54] in times Christ unto the fathers by the
[1:24:58] prophets
[1:24:59] I just told you probably said that that
[1:25:00] word by is not correct it means in
[1:25:03] see he was in those prophets speaking
[1:25:09] and then watch the second verse knows
[1:25:12] what I like
[1:25:13] these last days spoken unto us by
[1:25:18] us about going off is a different in a
[1:25:20] set of a man sit down and say God told
[1:25:22] me to write this
[1:25:23] if God told him right it's going to be
[1:25:24] right for God's energy
[1:25:27] now he spoke to us in his son
[1:25:29] not by a son all right yep
[1:25:34] it was any son Jesus Christ right
[1:25:37] now when that whole true to be then that
[1:25:39] then the prophet could
[1:25:42] in the last days
[1:25:45] that he would not be speaking by right
[1:25:48] but him amen
[1:25:52] and wouldn't it be that we would be the
[1:25:53] bride of Christ that God is in US
[1:25:57] man that's the only way we can
[1:25:59] understand
[1:26:03] is God being in us not God being beside
[1:26:06] us right or Bible us
[1:26:10] it wouldn't work out
[1:26:12] but in my Bible see it says our God you
[1:26:15] say well that's just because it starts
[1:26:17] to send us off well over there where it
[1:26:18] says God is a spirit my Bible uses DOD
[1:26:21] reversity
[1:26:25] because it wasn't emphasizing the point
[1:26:28] marriage emphasizing who's doing the
[1:26:30] talking
[1:26:34] the very God of Glory
[1:26:38] he's not using an angel
[1:26:41] that's what we think about a lot and
[1:26:43] there's a lot of emphasis in the Bible
[1:26:44] where God used angels to speak and
[1:26:46] Prophets Etc
[1:26:49] but when he stood there on the shores of
[1:26:51] Galilee and said I am
[1:26:54] that wasn't a second person that wasn't
[1:26:58] a prophet right
[1:27:00] that was God himself amen declaring
[1:27:03] himself who he was amen unless you
[1:27:07] believe that I am he right
[1:27:14] man
[1:27:17] then it could be that
[1:27:24] in Revelation of 1916 shows perfectly
[1:27:27] what needs to be done
[1:27:31] is that true
[1:27:36] no Brother Anderson come back to one two
[1:27:39] three
[1:27:41] four
[1:27:43] let's go back to what we did the other
[1:27:45] day
[1:27:48] all right
[1:27:51] First Timothy 6 15 which in his times he
[1:27:54] shall show who is the blessed and only
[1:27:56] Pope and take the king of kings and Lord
[1:28:00] of lords oh that's not capitalized
[1:28:03] the first K is
[1:28:07] and I gave you even the definition from
[1:28:09] Strong's
[1:28:11] 135-136 I'm pretty sure is one and one
[1:28:14] of them shows that total capitalization
[1:28:16] shows it to be God himself speaking the
[1:28:20] other can be us speaking to each other
[1:28:22] it can be God delivered through a
[1:28:23] prophet it could be an angel of God
[1:28:25] coming down to deal with you and I that
[1:28:27] doesn't make in God right brother Brown
[1:28:29] was God to the people
[1:28:31] Moses was God to the people
[1:28:34] but not the great capital
[1:28:37] right
[1:28:39] he would have been in a lower case
[1:28:41] Revelations is used three times remember
[1:28:43] the other day Revelation 17 14 says and
[1:28:46] they shall make war with the lamb and
[1:28:47] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:28:49] Lord of lords and King of Kings
[1:28:53] and later with him are called Chosen and
[1:28:55] faithful
[1:28:59] as I said in chapter 5 when it shows us
[1:29:02] in glory
[1:29:05] it says we're Kings and praise those are
[1:29:07] not
[1:29:08] capitalize
[1:29:10] because they're still part of the
[1:29:12] mystery to be done amen you're going to
[1:29:14] have to have a ride into the Millennium
[1:29:16] and to do that the wife has to make
[1:29:18] herself ready
[1:29:21] once you make yourself ready she's
[1:29:23] worthy to ride back with him why because
[1:29:25] it's the same material
[1:29:29] I know this is the current way of
[1:29:31] looking at things which you know to me
[1:29:33] it wouldn't have mattered by knowing
[1:29:34] what I know now
[1:29:36] understanding knowing what I know now it
[1:29:40] wouldn't matter to me if any just said
[1:29:41] there was just one riding on a horse
[1:29:47] but if you read by verses 11 12 13 14.
[1:29:52] amen and who are they look
[1:29:57] Revelations 19 16. and he act on this
[1:29:59] Venture on his time name written king of
[1:30:02] kings and Lord of the Lords
[1:30:06] so you can't separate the bride from
[1:30:08] Christ when it comes to riding back into
[1:30:09] Millennium you can't separate her when
[1:30:11] she's in heaven
[1:30:12] she's Kings and Priests
[1:30:16] but the whole story is not finished
[1:30:19] until we come riding back
[1:30:22] that's right so we're coming back to
[1:30:24] what did the prophet say
[1:30:26] into the Millennium on a honeymoon
[1:30:28] effect
[1:30:33] the bridegroom and the bride
[1:30:36] come riding into the millennium
[1:30:42] by being all the wedding all of the
[1:30:44] things all the marriage suppers and all
[1:30:47] of the things are finished
[1:30:51] Armageddon has transpired because you've
[1:30:54] been called 144 thousands he's been
[1:30:57] called and
[1:31:03] but you see Church
[1:31:06] that's not Israel as a nation that's
[1:31:08] writing on that order uh right amen
[1:31:15] that's not the nation of Israel as we
[1:31:17] get to Sunday the prophet said it the
[1:31:19] Millennium is to the nation of Israel
[1:31:22] we're just there on a honeymoon
[1:31:25] it's promised to them
[1:31:27] but they'll never be his wife
[1:31:31] that's right they'll never be the bride
[1:31:33] of Christ why because they turned it
[1:31:34] down right right
[1:31:41] you'd be surprised how much that's
[1:31:43] mistalk through that area
[1:31:48] see people just read something and they
[1:31:50] think well that's just what it is
[1:31:52] you know this is that
[1:31:55] we come riding back with him
[1:31:58] you can't separate him from Hurricane
[1:32:04] I mean you
[1:32:05] so you
[1:32:07] some of you've been around here with me
[1:32:09] and my wife for at least 40 years
[1:32:18] what if I come walking in with some
[1:32:19] other boom
[1:32:29] might be like my nephew was
[1:32:32] he was sitting in the cafe one day
[1:32:35] he looked over there and I said a guy
[1:32:37] I'm sorry for him but my nephew said
[1:32:39] said he looked a dead ringer for you
[1:32:41] brother Dale
[1:32:42] I feel sorry for him for having a look
[1:32:44] at the way but
[1:32:47] so his wife she was you know he was kind
[1:32:49] of backing up you know he didn't want to
[1:32:52] say nothing
[1:32:53] his wife was a little bit Sterner Things
[1:32:55] She Said
[1:32:56] I'm going to fix him
[1:32:59] because their set looked like me with
[1:33:02] another one and you it wouldn't be
[1:33:06] so she gets up to go over there
[1:33:09] and walked up to him and start to say
[1:33:15] she recognized it wasn't me
[1:33:18] what's my point
[1:33:20] if I come in with a different looking
[1:33:22] woman you know
[1:33:24] most of you here would know the
[1:33:27] difference
[1:33:28] and say something's wrong
[1:33:30] yeah why because we've been related
[1:33:33] together so long they say you get to
[1:33:35] looking alike
[1:33:38] look around that food out of my shoes
[1:33:42] living very moment in my room
[1:33:45] maybe another 10 years
[1:33:48] just kidding but listen
[1:33:53] what about the Bible being so specific
[1:33:57] that it would explain
[1:33:59] the beautiful story
[1:34:02] of the relationship between God and man
[1:34:04] that God has made a way right
[1:34:08] that we could be his offspring we could
[1:34:11] be his brother
[1:34:13] we could be
[1:34:14] equal
[1:34:16] and what does the Bible say co-equal
[1:34:19] ity is that true the Romans
[1:34:22] join Aaron amen
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:33] what about it
[1:34:35] what a beautiful story
[1:34:39] that after all of these years we begin
[1:34:41] to
[1:34:43] good picture
[1:34:45] Prophet had to preach all those years
[1:34:47] and all those sermons for us to get the
[1:34:49] picture together
[1:34:50] and now we can see a beautiful picture
[1:34:52] of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:34:58] and when you see him you see her when
[1:35:00] you see her you see him right
[1:35:04] the Revelation 19 16 when they're coming
[1:35:06] riding back
[1:35:09] all of that is total capital letter yeah
[1:35:16] all of that is emphasizing that God and
[1:35:19] man
[1:35:20] has become one
[1:35:24] the story of redemption is over for
[1:35:26] mankind you know what I'm talking about
[1:35:28] the bride the wife
[1:35:32] that's a hard thing maybe to understand
[1:35:33] but that's reason I tried to use the
[1:35:35] word Jehovah selling compound names with
[1:35:37] Jehovah describing the one Lord Jesus
[1:35:39] Christ
[1:35:41] when you think about it we're his
[1:35:43] brother we're his
[1:35:46] we can be a servant the Bible can speak
[1:35:49] of us as servants and get it confused
[1:35:50] people will with the the Jews that
[1:35:53] servants they can call it service
[1:35:56] he he's our father
[1:35:58] he's her husband
[1:36:00] there's no human terminologies in
[1:36:02] mankind to be able to comprehend that
[1:36:05] but How could somebody be
[1:36:06] your father
[1:36:12] but do you think some of those things
[1:36:13] are going to be done away with
[1:36:17] no
[1:36:21] according to my Bible
[1:36:24] when we enter the millennial reign
[1:36:29] it'll say that God
[1:36:31] may be
[1:36:33] all
[1:36:35] you know
[1:36:37] run around I'll give it to you place
[1:36:38] that it's a millennium these places the
[1:36:40] future home
[1:36:42] because the next thing for you and I
[1:36:43] after the Millennium is
[1:36:45] who go to the white throwing judgment to
[1:36:47] sit with him
[1:36:50] on the same throne
[1:36:53] not before the throne but on the same
[1:36:54] throne with him
[1:36:56] she's never separated no more
[1:37:01] everything is wonderful to see him
[1:37:08] we spent a lot of time talking about him
[1:37:11] and that's wonderful we need more time
[1:37:16] but then he's trying to talk about us
[1:37:21] he's showing us to the world
[1:37:26] listen that's my bride
[1:37:29] right that's my wife
[1:37:32] Paul gets over in the book of Acts and
[1:37:34] he says
[1:37:35] to the unknown God that they were
[1:37:37] talking about and they left a little
[1:37:38] spot Maybe for One in case they missed
[1:37:40] it said the one we don't know his name
[1:37:42] Paul said let me talk to you about it
[1:37:46] he said even your report say that we are
[1:37:49] his offspring yep
[1:37:53] we're his race we're in the nation
[1:37:57] the children of Israel will be a natural
[1:37:59] Nation but they rejected the right of
[1:38:01] being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:04] he said well this people downtown didn't
[1:38:06] have anything to do with it that's true
[1:38:08] but by the representation of predestine
[1:38:10] you know of representation by their mom
[1:38:12] and daddy Israel
[1:38:14] just like you and I didn't have anything
[1:38:15] to do what happened to the Garden did we
[1:38:17] we wasn't there to cause the fall but
[1:38:20] because of the follower here right right
[1:38:24] so dude you could stand up and say I I
[1:38:27] didn't reject you
[1:38:33] that's why he's going to give them
[1:38:35] eternal life
[1:38:36] because they didn't reject him
[1:38:39] but their representation did
[1:38:48] the ones who cried out for his blood
[1:38:52] represented all Jews
[1:38:54] they'll be in the Millennium the prophet
[1:38:57] said
[1:38:59] but you won't be there that's
[1:39:02] the wife of God
[1:39:04] because it won't be no Jehovah was right
[1:39:07] and Jesus is bride and
[1:39:11] that's why I like that quote
[1:39:13] the Jehovah the old is the Jesus with
[1:39:15] the new and the Holy Ghost
[1:39:18] is now
[1:39:20] meaning what the very one among us today
[1:39:22] is the Jehovah the old man that's right
[1:39:25] and the Jesus of the new that walked
[1:39:27] Ashworth of Galilee
[1:39:29] amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:31] living in the hearts of the Saints I
[1:39:33] believe that
[1:39:34] given us eternal life right
[1:39:37] Zoe God's own life amen
[1:39:44] you can't separate him and her
[1:39:51] God won't allow that right
[1:39:58] do you understand what I've tried to
[1:39:59] explain for all 40 something years
[1:40:03] talking about God
[1:40:06] didn't even try to use natural things to
[1:40:09] show
[1:40:10] references
[1:40:15] run around and said whatever that name
[1:40:17] he has will be the name she had amen
[1:40:22] mm-hmm
[1:40:25] whatever it is would be the same name
[1:40:38] number 15 Brother Anderson
[1:40:44] Revelations 3 about 12 or somewhere
[1:40:48] right in there versus you get a new name
[1:40:53] this is
[1:40:55] page 318 of the churches book The
[1:40:58] Philadelphia Church age I will write my
[1:41:00] new name upon him my new name when it
[1:41:04] all becomes new then he will take upon
[1:41:06] him a new name and that name will be the
[1:41:09] name of the Bride also amen
[1:41:13] what that name is
[1:41:15] how you pronounce that word
[1:41:19] which means you can't figure it out
[1:41:21] right there's no way to
[1:41:22] understand yep because there's no way to
[1:41:26] understand jvhv
[1:41:28] right you see where I'm going back
[1:41:30] there's no way to understand jvhv
[1:41:32] there's no way to understand that but
[1:41:33] see that and remember we read it to
[1:41:35] start with
[1:41:36] only
[1:41:38] the one who gets the name will know the
[1:41:40] name
[1:41:44] you say are you looking for a new name
[1:41:46] of Jesus yes
[1:41:50] but maybe not in this world
[1:41:57] what that name will be what who would
[1:41:59] worry about it
[1:42:03] only one thing for sure my name right
[1:42:05] now is Miss Jesus amen whatever his name
[1:42:09] is and where it changes or whatever my
[1:42:11] name's going to be the same but what
[1:42:12] about you right
[1:42:14] see that would that's not a divorce and
[1:42:17] getting another wife or something
[1:42:19] it would have to be a revelation of
[1:42:21] spirit given so conclusively that none
[1:42:23] would die tonight
[1:42:24] but no doubt he will leave that
[1:42:26] Revelation to the day when he desires to
[1:42:28] give that name for it suffice it to know
[1:42:32] that it will be more wonderful than we
[1:42:34] could ever imagine
[1:42:37] could be more wonderful it will be more
[1:42:40] wonderful
[1:42:42] same message and excuse me pergament
[1:42:45] Church age page 211. he said we are
[1:42:48] Christian that's a new name our names
[1:42:51] will change we're Christians
[1:42:53] it's a name common to all of us but one
[1:42:56] day we will have another change Willow
[1:42:59] Willis uncertainty receiving your name
[1:43:01] it could be that name
[1:43:04] would our true and original name written
[1:43:07] in the landscape of life from the
[1:43:10] foundation of the world he knows the
[1:43:13] name right but we do not
[1:43:16] one day it is good pleasure we will know
[1:43:19] also
[1:43:21] but everybody's looking for a new name
[1:43:23] of Jesus
[1:43:24] the quote page 283 of this first seal
[1:43:29] let it be revealed in the Thunders
[1:43:32] you're looking at it it'll be revealed
[1:43:34] in the Thunder
[1:43:36] um
[1:43:38] you know the Thunders
[1:43:41] are beautiful things
[1:43:45] because it is the voice of God Amen
[1:43:47] the Thunder is the voice of God
[1:43:50] but you know that voice doesn't speak to
[1:43:52] everybody
[1:43:55] it's only going to speak to a chosen
[1:43:57] people amen the only chosen people would
[1:43:59] ever know what his new name is and if
[1:44:02] you knew what it was according to what
[1:44:03] we just read
[1:44:04] you couldn't tell me what it is amen
[1:44:11] you might be able to show a
[1:44:13] manifestation
[1:44:15] right but you can't tell me what that
[1:44:18] name is
[1:44:21] look out how many years did it take
[1:44:24] after we came in this message for us to
[1:44:26] realize the name of God is Jesus amen
[1:44:29] sir come on
[1:44:31] be honest
[1:44:33] how long did it take before you got
[1:44:36] around to reading that and believed it
[1:44:39] that the name of Jesus is the only thing
[1:44:41] God ever had right
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:46] right
[1:44:47] how many years did it take before you
[1:44:49] came to that understanding
[1:44:53] when no man can call Jesus what
[1:45:00] the Christ accepted me by the holy ghost
[1:45:02] or call Jesus a curse
[1:45:07] you see that's why if you'll notice in
[1:45:09] what I was giving you'll go back to
[1:45:11] Matthew and you'll find it learn the
[1:45:13] first verses when they said and you
[1:45:14] shall call his name Jesus
[1:45:16] that was a Heavenly being delivering
[1:45:18] down to an Earthly person
[1:45:21] what a name would be
[1:45:27] it was not a an Earthly person receiving
[1:45:29] it
[1:45:30] it was not even a prophet
[1:45:32] to receive and give to the people
[1:45:38] it was God himself
[1:45:41] declaring what his name would be
[1:45:46] The Only Name God ever had is Jesus amen
[1:45:50] but yet brother Brown you want the corn
[1:45:51] on he said there was many Jesus's in the
[1:45:54] days of Jesus walking the shores of
[1:45:56] Galilee sure now you want the rest of it
[1:45:59] but he said there's only one Jesus
[1:46:02] Christ that's right
[1:46:08] there was only one of those jesuses that
[1:46:11] were surround her
[1:46:14] that was the anointed
[1:46:16] God
[1:46:18] the Messiah
[1:46:21] didn't you say Jesus Jesus brought
[1:46:23] around said and not get nothing right
[1:46:28] if you don't know who you're talking to
[1:46:32] you that's right
[1:46:34] you remember the little woman that come
[1:46:36] up to him and said
[1:46:38] not some day even have mercy on me
[1:46:40] yeah
[1:46:44] he said you ain't got no right to call
[1:46:45] me that
[1:46:48] you're a dog
[1:46:52] LeBron said he didn't approach her
[1:46:54] correctly I mean he didn't she didn't
[1:46:56] approach him correctly right
[1:47:00] see if you could have said Son of David
[1:47:03] you wouldn't even listen to her that's
[1:47:04] right
[1:47:06] when she said that's right Lord but said
[1:47:09] the dogs eat the crumbs the master's
[1:47:11] table
[1:47:13] you realize she was going Beyond just
[1:47:15] looking at him is what he was and she
[1:47:18] was seeing almighty God standing before
[1:47:19] her
[1:47:20] his black sister had he writes on one
[1:47:23] day to the point when he wrote around
[1:47:24] him and said so she said that ain't
[1:47:25] nothing but the truth
[1:47:27] the holy spirit said give her what she
[1:47:29] desires
[1:47:33] you see waiting to say Jesus Jesus and
[1:47:35] not even be talking about almighty God
[1:47:39] but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:45] but you know what it takes all of that
[1:47:46] to do
[1:47:48] he takes all of those Jehovah javares
[1:47:51] Jehovah Jeske news and all that all of
[1:47:52] him Yahweh
[1:47:54] um Ava ever had all those words we used
[1:47:57] while ago except existence all in those
[1:47:59] terminologies to come out to be the one
[1:48:01] person well
[1:48:04] what about a man that could contain
[1:48:07] or manifest all the things the Bible
[1:48:10] said
[1:48:13] that's right no wonder you always a
[1:48:16] cheese or something here
[1:48:18] but he's a holy ghost now
[1:48:22] if we just believe it
[1:48:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:48:28] forever
[1:48:31] Brown said that's where Eve messed up
[1:48:33] she didn't believe in Hebrews 13 8.
[1:48:38] I thought all she done was just took the
[1:48:40] serpent and had a baby
[1:48:45] he said she didn't believe him to be
[1:48:47] Hebrews 13 8.
[1:48:49] the week believe him to be Hebrews 13.
[1:48:53] all right
[1:48:56] the same God that walked ashore to Young
[1:48:58] these the same God here tonight
[1:49:03] he knew about a new birth
[1:49:05] you see why it's so important all right
[1:49:08] come on brothers let's stay
[1:49:11] back on these things
[1:49:14] I just want to make sure that was right
[1:49:16] uppercase lowercase
[1:49:18] I may not know my cases but I try to
[1:49:21] know God right
[1:49:25] I may not know how to put it down into
[1:49:27] language and to human people to
[1:49:29] understand but
[1:49:32] um I believe that same God that come
[1:49:35] down
[1:49:39] spoke to Abraham
[1:49:44] is that same Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:51] they said I am
[1:49:53] you know the book of Acts when I believe
[1:49:55] was Stephen explaining the uh doings of
[1:49:59] coming down how they're rejecting what
[1:50:00] they were doing wouldn't it Stephen that
[1:50:02] when he finishes up he says
[1:50:05] this was the one Speaking of Jesus
[1:50:08] Christ because this was the one that was
[1:50:10] in the burning bush that spoke to Moses
[1:50:16] yep
[1:50:18] the same Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:20] that created the world
