TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning good to be back home let's see if we can there we go all right we've been studying on Hebrews chapter 6 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word once more and we come expecting this morning and we just ask Lord that you'll just bless the services today and Lord as we meditate upon your word Lord we begin to think upon things Lord to get our heart and our mind set Lord to receive your word today granted Lord that you'll just bless us today in your name amen so Hebrews Hebrews chapter 6 what kind of the theme of of some of the things that um Paul is is talking about in in that chapter just kind of wanted to summarize before we continue on and he says in in verse verse 7 for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh and cursing whose end is to be burned so the rain falls on the just and the unjust but if it can fall on that good ground it's going to bring up up something it's going to it's going to Quicken the word and in verse 15 he says and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise talking about Abraham he obtained the promise and verse 19 he says which hope we have is an anchor of the Soul we've got that that that promise that Abraham was looking for typed something that uh would happen in the New Testament the promise of the Holy Ghost of that seed that promise seed and that's what anchors our soul which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil so if we go if we start reading through at verse n he says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and New Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope un the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises so again he's talking about promises that we have access to and to not not be slothful but but to be diligent to to to uh do everything we can to further to to to see this promise manifested in our life and so as he as he keeps reading on he says in verse 13 for when God made promise to Abraham he's talking about a promise here because he can swear by no greater he swear by himself so now let's think about that promise the promise promise that he gave to Abraham was to see a child born and to see a birth and so the promise that we're looking at that for this in this day is to is to see the birth of the word in our lives and to not just not just a new birth but uh to be born again according to Malachi 456 to have the word B born in us to bring us to a place where we can see the son of man man manifest in our lives saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured after he had patiently endured now to keep in mind all of the things that Paul has talked about in Hebrews the children of Israel coming through the Wilderness and all the trials that they've endured and all the thing to to see they they want uh striving to see that promise made manifest to end up in the promised land and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise so Paul say Paul's saying in verse 13 because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself and we've got in verse uh the little way down there at the bottom you maybe you can't see it uh but in in in Genesis 22:16 it says and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son now let's let's think about that promise that he gave a promise by myself I have have I sworn and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou obeyed my voice so now he's making a promise that's got something to do with that seed we know the seed is typing the seed the seed is typing not just Abraham's progeny but the seed is really typing is speaking of the of Christ that will come Christ is the seed so now when when God makes a promise it's something when we read the Bible we can have we it's something you can lay hold to he's he's not just saying vain words I I I I I've been thinking meditating a lot lately that how when you when when God's word Goes Forth it is going to accomplish his purpose right it's not just going to fall fall to the ground but it's going to do something God is going to have a bride so when God says something in his word it's going to come to pass and and Paul Paul that's what he's stressing here in in chapter six that that that God's word is so immutable immutable means it it cannot be changed it's something that you can have confidence in like I've got this the picture of this rock here a rock now uh that no matter how much the the winds and the waves crash against it it's it's going understand the test of time it's going to be there forever and ever like like brother brownman that sermon we just listened to the Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the kind of immutable rock that we have our confidence in so in verse 16 Paul says for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath he wanted to show the immutability of his counsel in other words how How firm that the things that he says are how he he wanted us to have such a confidence in it that not just not only did he say it but he swore an oath to to double confirm it that by two immutable things in which if it was if it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay upon the Hope set before us so again I've got that scripture over there by myself have I sworn that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens see now he's talking about a promise to the seed which is Christ that he would multiply by the thy seed as the stars of the heaven that's talking about you and I sitting here this morning in other words that's that promise that he gave the immutable promise that he swore an oath on top of is the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the sand which is upon on the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies now see see this is something that'll preach when am we've got a confidence we've got a promise that's so firm that God wanted us to lay claim to that no matter what kind of gates in front of you no matter what kind of mountains in front of you you got a promise that you can lay claim to that thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies so we've got two immutable things that we can we can look look to in in the word so brother Amma said we have two things yes first his word said he would do it yes now that should be enough that when God said something that that should be enough but the second was the sworn his sworn oath on it that he would do it I swore an oath onto it now see the two immutable things are that God cannot lie God can't lie we can we can we can say things just in our Humanity like I was saying in past Su school lessons that you know I'm going to be over at your house after church I'm going to do I'm going to meet you somewhere and then a bad storm comes up and we just we just for some reason or another we even if we're not lying just we can't we we might not be able to do it but the God is not that way it doesn't matter what storms come come up it doesn't matter what mountains in front of you it doesn't matter what the enemy throws in front of you but his word says he would do it and he put on top of that the second was his sworn oath on it see brother Adam said to know this that God has promised us by a sworn oath one that he cannot lie the other he swore an oath on top of that what that he will raise us see how everything's bottled up in the Holy Ghost everything's if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got access to all of these promises that he's confirming by an oath on top of his word that he said he would do it that he will raise us up at the last day and give us eternal life that's that promise to the seed the promise is the seed of of Christ so brother R said and he swore by himself he said God made an oath promised Abraham and swore by himself that I'll save you and your seed after you what is the Seed of Abraham now see what the oath is that that that he he made to Abraham what is the Seed of Abraham now who is the one that's got this Sure hold who is the one that's built on this foundation not just every time Dick and Harry not all that saith to me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and this is the Father's will this is his word so he's I've got this little picture of the of the hand with all these all these these these people that God was thinking about because that's what the promise is the promise is to you and I that have been born by the holy ghost that that you'll possess the Gate of every enemy that no matter what the devil throws in you that God has given you power to overcome so I think I've got the in the yellow there that that that scripture that in blessing I will P thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and so brother man would say in Jesus Christ the same yesterday and day today and forever he said father God he was praying in prayer it is most solemnly that we come to thee you have declared yourself you're not guilty of your promise anymore how is he not guilty of his promise because he sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost he sent the proof of of of the things that he was he was promising to Abraham he's he's Vindicated his word he said you made it true for the Bible said that God cannot lie the immutable things God cannot lie and God swore that he would do it if we could only believe it then we see Jesus said this morning in the reading that it's it's impossible the scriptures cannot be broken so when God says something it's something that you can hang everything on you can hang your soul on you can have total confidence that God the only thing that's preventing God's word from coming to pass is for us to just believe it and brother R in Hebrews chapter 6 number two he said notice God made a promise to Abraham unconditional and now wait Abraham did not have to do one thing the only thing you got to do this morning is just believe God's word you don't have to work one thing up you don't have to grab somebody by the head and shake them until they speak in tongues you don't have to force something to happen see this morning while we we're preaching the gospel we we're not trying to force anybody to do anything we're not you don't have to work anything up just sit there and just accept the word and believe it in your heart he said God said I've already done it so he's already done it God made a promise to ABRA to Adam said Adam if you'll not touch this you'll live forever but the day you eat thereof that day you die Adam said I just wonder what it's all all about anyhow he goes over and eats it tampered every time that God made a man a man makes his Covenant with God or God with a man the man breaks his part so God had to do something because he seen what man was and they were foreordained they were elected and God had to do something so God came down and made his Covenant with a Abraham unconditionally if it wouldn't have been unconditionally Abraham would have been lost a long time what's what's brother Ram talking about in Hebrews chapter 6 he's talking about UNC conditional Covenant when God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you believed it not because you worked something up because you just believed it then God's going to do it he's going to take care of everything if you just believe him that's all you got to do in Hebrews chapter 6 number two brother said if we are dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and are ears according to the promise that's what the Bible said would you like to read it while the Bible said that the promise was not only to Abraham and his seeds like you Abraham had many seeds sure many children Ishmael was his child he had seven or eight children after Sarah died by another one Cura but look the seed was the promised one which was Isaac and through Isaac came Christ through Christ came us the promise is unconditionally amen now what about Abraham why he' have been done it' been impossible for him to ever get back again sure it had been impossible for Saul to ever get back again if that if you you'd have to read the scriptures that way see but it wasn't God's promise endures forever yes now that's that immutable promise that God confirmed by an oath where he said it and he confirmed it by an oath and he swore it that he was going to send his he was going to send the promise of the Holy Ghost and if you would receive it by believing not trying to work something up but God would accomplish every he would fulfill all of his promise by that Holy Ghost listen what brother Ram said he said God never gives Sarah the promise he gave Abraham the promise but Sarah was included he made the promise in Christ Jesus and I was included in him you were too through Isaac come Christ that was Abraham's seed is Christ and then the Seed of Abraham first wasn't through sexual seed it was his faith that God reckoned and it's through faith in us to believe the death burial and the resurrection of Christ brings us Abraham's seed for it was Abraham the promise was made and only Abraham was the promise made to him and his seed Abraham and to his seed and his seed was not all of his children but in Isaac was his seed called and here is the results here is the results of Abraham's seed Jesus Christ is Abraham's seed and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are HS according to the promise let's not forget the context that we're talking about we're talking about Hebrews 6 chter 8 verse 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation so this morning I think we should have a strong consolation that we got two immutable things that God gave us that we should have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us this hope that's set before us we've got something God has given un us something brother R said in melkisedek the great Prince and King he said what a marvelous promise two immutable things God cannot lie and be God Amen now if God has made a promise in his Bible here we believe the Bible to be the infallible word of God and if God has made a promise in this Bible we have this consolation and know that it's impossible for God to lie now you think about this morning whatever things you have need of as the word's going forth it's impossible for God to lie therefore when he sees he promised it in the Bible We Believe It soul body and spirit can you say that this morning you believe it soul body and spirit it's impossible for him to lie so let's see what that means now brother Ram said in Hebrews chapter 6 number three he said knowing that so if you got the Holy Ghost now if you got that promised seed knowing that after we have been called that he said that he knew us before the foundation of the world and predestinated US unto adoption of children through Jesus Christ and he forne us he called us and when he called us he justified us what what's brother ra to do he's trying to build up your confidence to know if God's got you if you're in him he's got you and when he called us he justified us we cannot justify ourselves it's not by our own works that's right so he justified Us by the death of his own son those who he has Justified he is already glorified the word is already spoke yes and we're just on our road going along rejoicing on our way to Glory like in Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified see now if he's filled you with the Holy Ghost and he's Justified you in your soul whom he justified then he also glorified he in other words he's got you and you're part of that promise that that goes back to Genesis 22 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice you're part of that promise now see you you're part of that unconditional Covenant that if youve got the baptism of Holy Ghost he's got he's got you he said now brother BR would say in Hebrews chapter 6 number two he said you say well can't we backslide absolutely and when you backslide you're going to get it don't you worry backsliding is when you you you forget what your purpose is you forget you forget you're supposed to be in church you forget you you start sliding back and you just get you get let the world start taking a hold he said when you backslide you're going to get it don't you worry Abraham got it and the rest of them got it and you'll get it don't you think it gives you a right to sin it doesn't you'll pay for everything that you do you'll reap what you seow you do one little sin and you reap a whole Wash Tub full that's right but but brother that don't mean to say that you're lost Hallelujah that's exactly right Abraham reaped exactly what he SED that's right but he was still saved the Covenant that now see that that's what we read just just a minute ago in Romans 8:30 whom he predestinated he called and who he called he justified and who he justified he's also glorified the Covenant that God made with Israel they lost their inheritage they lost the promised land and went down into Egypt but they hadn't lost their Covenant God said I remember my promise to Abraham I remember and I've come down to deliver my people go down there most Moes and tell Pharaoh I said let my people go I remember I made a promise to Abraham and to his seed now brother R when he's laying out all this promise he he would talk about how that that uh you remember when when when God put Abraham into a deep sleep he he he he made all those sacrifices where he killed the Bulls and and whatnot all the animals and he separated them and brother R would say you know when you when you make a PR when you make a covenant in the Old Testament that's how how they would do they would they would take an animal and they would divide it to to symbolize that Covenant and so that was fulfilled on the cross as Jesus his his he pulled his his soul and his body was divided as a covenant to us that he had fulf he was going to fulfill that promise the promise what to give to send that seed this the promise of the Holy Ghost so brother Bram and melkisedek the great Prince and King he said and God swore to Abraham that he would keep this Covenant with him and with his seed forever God swore wor by himself that he would do it and in doing so under the Old Law when you made an oath under the Old Law you killed an animal cut it in two and then the two men on which the oath was taken by stood between the animal and they wrote out on a piece of paper a certain contract and that piece of paper was torn apart and given to one and the other man and they took a oath over this dead animal that if they broke that Covenant between them let them be as this dead animal so God having no other to swear by see this is tiing in don't forget what we're talking talking about we're talking about Hebrews chapter 6 where God willing more abundantly to show under the HS of Promise the immutability of his counsil confirmed it by an oath and see in the Old Testament they would confirm an oath by tearing two tearing two animals apart but here in the New Testament how he confirm it by dying on the cross he said that having no other to swear by he swore by himself and he took the oath over the body of the Lord Jesus Christ foreseeing it in a shadow and in the Covenant when he took Christ to Calvary he tore his body and soul apart and he lifted up his body to sit on his right hand and S back sent back the Holy Spirit to be in the Christian to do the same thing here in the church that he did in Christ so he sent his holy spirit into the church to prove to prove his word to prove his promise to you that's why you there EV the evidence that God loves you is that he sent his holy spirit into you to prove his word that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay upon the Hope set before us said brother would say in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said father God it is most solemnly that we come to thee you have declared yourself and I'm I'm reading that same quote again you're not guilty of your promise anymore you made it true for the Bible said that God cannot lie the immutable things God cannot lie and God swore that he would do it if we could only believe it which hope we have in verse 19 that's the Hope we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God sent into his church we hope which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul that's your anchor and when you're filled with the Holy Ghost there ain't nothing going to ever take that away from you both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil that's the anchor that anchor that anchors your whole life it'll anchor your family it anchors your decisions it changes it changes everything when you're filled with the Holy Ghost whether the Forerunner is for us entered whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of melkisedek so now Paul's Paul's he's making his way over to Hebrews chapter 7 where he's going to start laying out what who melkisedek was and and what why that's important to us I'm going skip over that slide and brother said talking about a forerunner he said no wonder you can look death in the face and say where is your steam grave where is your Victory because we're in the Forerunner a forerunner did you ever notice in the old western days many times we went across the old Trails a forerunner or Scout when the raag Wagon Train was perishing for water the Scout run ahead and he seen the tribes of Indians he bypassed them and he seen where there was a fountain of water he rushed back to tell the boss of the Wagon Train Step Up the horses everybody take good courage for just over the mountain there's a big Fountain of water he's a forerunner and here the Forerunner man was once pinned down by the devil under rapid fire but somebody took the Machine Gun Nest that was Jesus the Forerunner has gone before us and Satan standing there with a machine gun pinning us down always in bondage and scared of death he was guarding that Fountain sure he was he was given the commission because we had sinned and been driven drove away from it but the Forerunner Christ come in and took the nest now see that the Forerunner Forerunner somebody to go ahead of you and and clear the way and let you know what's ahead now you think let's meditate on this for a second now the Forerunner is somebody that goes through all of the things for you so you can look back in this case you can look back at the life of Jesus Christ and look and see everything that you're going to have to go through as a Christian let's examine that for a second now look he was born in a major he was born down in a in in a like a little dirty a dirty spot you know just next to the cows and next to the donkeys and things just like how the word was born in your dirty filthy life and and God God came and and and and and and birthed the word in that little manger now you keep following through all all the all the significant points of Jesus's life as the Forerunner he lived a life that you're also going to have to live he went down and he was baptized by John well you got to be baptized you got to be baptized repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then there on that River Jordan he he he fulfilled you know in a type of of of you've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and he kept he kept walking through his life and he came to the place where finally he was he was adopted and on that mount of transfiguration uh he went through the process of hear ye him where God looked down at him and said now now this this person has come to a place where I trust everything that he says now you see all these things as a forerunner he's going through going through the process the same process that you and I have to go through he there there in that Garden of gsim and he ding out to himself father not my will but thine be done that you and I have to come to that place as well where we're totally trusting and and totally die die out to ourself and he went down into the grave just like a lot of a lot of Christians have have to go will have to go out down into the grave but then he rose up on Easter morning and his body was changed now you see he went through a as a forerunner he went through every proc every step in his life that a Christian is going to go through the Forerunner and we're going to close on this as a musician can go ahead and come forward the Forerunner the man that went before us as one come and took our place none other but God himself he come down and made himself a man for a forun to prove to the people why he swore by an o that he was going to do it he swore he was going to save us he swore that we could do it he swore these things to us by himself then he come down and was made a forerunner he made himself a forerunner he entered here on the world and lived in the world sin all around him and above above sin because he trusted God Amen God bless [Applause] you
