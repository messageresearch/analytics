[16:11] go read one scripture Isaiah 60:1 in
[16:16] verse 10 and it says I will greatly
[16:18] rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be
[16:21] joyful in my god for he hath clothed me
[16:24] with the garments of salvation he hath
[16:26] covered me with the robe of
[16:28] righteousness as a bridegroom Dickus
[16:31] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[16:33] adorned herself with her jewels a man
[16:38] god bless you tonight you may be seated
[16:39] I won't speak on clothed in
[16:42] righteousness and brother Branham as a
[16:49] message is Oh whereas thou stripped gone
[16:52] sentence in 1959 brother Branham says he
[17:05] said a minister was telling me the other
[17:06] day went to suffer with a person and
[17:08] while they were getting separated this
[17:10] ministers wife had to watch we love Suzy
[17:13] or something like that before they
[17:14] cooked supper for them I said brother
[17:17] I'm telling you when that comes it shows
[17:20] that the home life no wonder we got
[17:22] juvenile delinquency no wonder the
[17:24] spirit the secrets been discovered it
[17:26] takes it's taken the baptism of the Holy
[17:29] Ghost out of the people and they and
[17:31] they are going for the things of the
[17:34] world instead of coming back to God stop
[17:37] look listen the coming the Lord is at
[17:39] hand
[17:40] what good is our knowledge do what good
[17:42] will our big buildings do what will our
[17:44] intellect intellectual talks do it'll
[17:46] take nothing will stand that day but the
[17:49] blood of Jesus Christ washed in his
[17:51] blood and clothing his righteousness by
[17:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[17:55] when the church loses
[17:56] that it's gone and you can see it's
[18:00] smothering down wooing talking the Holy
[18:03] Spirit's been grieved by our Creed's in
[18:05] our denomination or and our sectarian
[18:07] barriers and our class and our fancy
[18:09] things we know all that abomination in
[18:12] the sight of God what we need is a good
[18:15] clean washed church a real clean cut
[18:18] hundred percent out for God out and out
[18:20] with no shame no backwardness we don't
[18:23] care what the world says we got God and
[18:25] he's all we care about and he's in our
[18:27] hearts and we worship Him in spirit and
[18:29] truth that's what God wants in his
[18:31] church you know because we want to be
[18:35] clothed in his righteousness not our own
[18:40] because we know in Isaiah 64 verse 6 I
[18:45] said but we are all as an unclean thing
[18:48] and all our righteousness are as filthy
[18:50] rags and we all do as a leaf and our
[18:53] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[18:55] away so you know the scripture here
[18:59] tells us that he says that he was going
[19:02] he is rejoicing I was asked that we were
[19:04] Joy's because we have been clothed with
[19:07] the garments of salvation he said him
[19:09] put on him the robe of righteousness his
[19:12] righteousness because we don't have any
[19:14] righteousness in ourselves because all
[19:16] we have is filthy rags but we take on
[19:18] his righteousness and one of the things
[19:21] I want to look at tonight there's a
[19:24] there's a couple of things I want to
[19:25] look at tonight because I want to
[19:29] emphasize the the garment that they wore
[19:33] in the Middle East because when you look
[19:35] at the words when we talk about apparel
[19:40] when we talk about being Rove and we
[19:41] talked about being clothed we have to go
[19:45] back and look at the idea of what the
[19:47] where the writers are taking this from
[19:49] because in their time they would
[19:51] understand that because reading as
[19:53] brother brems said we're Western people
[19:55] trying to understand an Eastern book so
[19:56] we want to go back and look at what they
[19:58] had when they said when they talk about
[20:00] because today if you talk about a robe a
[20:03] robe ain't much and you know but we want
[20:06] to go back and look at what they talk
[20:08] about when they say being robe
[20:10] and the other thing I want to look at
[20:12] tonight later on I want to look at
[20:14] because in the scripture I would have
[20:18] look because even our day in Revelation
[20:22] Jesus gives God giving the rebuke to the
[20:26] Laodicean Church age he says that he
[20:29] wanted them to because they knew he said
[20:32] they were naked and he said you're naked
[20:35] and you don't know it you're poor blind
[20:38] and miserable and naked and you don't
[20:40] know it but he said I want you to buy
[20:42] raiment of me that you can be clothed
[20:43] that the shame of your nakedness not
[20:46] appear so one of the things I want ho
[20:48] about was being clothed but being naked
[20:50] being without because if we look we want
[20:56] to take this thought and look all the
[20:57] way through the scripture because it
[20:59] comes all the way through but to
[21:01] understand what it means to be clothed
[21:03] in his righteousness but also to
[21:07] understand the point that I want to try
[21:10] to get to later on why do we have
[21:13] standards as far as holiness what is a
[21:18] standard because if our time in and
[21:23] looking at what what is considered
[21:26] modest or anything what does the
[21:29] scripture say and how do you apply that
[21:31] and what does the scripture actually
[21:32] mean because people say well it doesn't
[21:35] matter well then you know if it doesn't
[21:39] matter then that's the part of the Bible
[21:41] we just tear out and throw away because
[21:44] if it's not if it doesn't matter if God
[21:47] did then what then why did the Holy
[21:49] Ghost come upon the writers of the Bible
[21:52] and write these things if it's not
[21:54] important if it wasn't important than
[21:56] God wouldn't erode it but it was came
[21:59] from the mind of God to someone some man
[22:02] to write down for you and I to
[22:04] understand that the Bible brother
[22:07] Branham said that that we understand
[22:09] that he said a Holy Ghost field woman
[22:12] wouldn't put on something that's immoral
[22:14] you don't have you don't if the Holy
[22:17] Ghost is upon a person then you know
[22:19] they don't that's what the Holy Ghost
[22:21] came for is to leading
[22:24] so that you will know what truth is and
[22:28] not only that you will have somebody
[22:31] because honestly if God set things in
[22:35] motion and we have the Holy Spirit
[22:37] inside of us it's the leading and
[22:39] guiding but the other thing is God set
[22:41] in order
[22:42] he said a fivefold ministry in order so
[22:45] so to bring the word to the people
[22:48] because that's the only way that was the
[22:51] channel that God created that he
[22:53] ordained - for it to come in and come
[22:55] through the fivefold ministry to you so
[23:00] if you're confused on something he said
[23:02] he was ordained he was he has to he's
[23:05] obligated to put somebody right here to
[23:07] answer your questions well then you know
[23:12] what we don't have to have any worries
[23:13] we don't have to fret why because we put
[23:16] our confidence in him as brother Bowman
[23:18] somebody we got to have confidence in
[23:19] God in what he said and if it's true
[23:21] then that's where we lay our faith and
[23:23] we hold on to that we don't have to we
[23:27] don't have to worry we don't have to
[23:29] question one because God has the mind
[23:33] that he wants us to understand that if
[23:35] that he has it in his mind then you know
[23:37] what he is going to make sure that you
[23:39] get it you know it's just like going to
[23:44] school when you were in school and you
[23:45] had a teacher and they taught you
[23:47] something and you know and you didn't
[23:48] get it within you know what they went
[23:49] back over it and you know what there's
[23:53] people that you know that they have
[23:55] tutors and they have people that that's
[23:57] that worked one-on-one to understand how
[23:59] you learn how to work through your
[24:02] problems that how you so you can
[24:05] comprehend what's going on and God knows
[24:08] each one of us and he knows each where
[24:09] where were each one of us situation he
[24:12] knows your mindset he knows everything
[24:13] about you so if he knows how to speak to
[24:16] you so that you can receive what you
[24:18] have need of you know because that's the
[24:22] reason he said he said he said a
[24:23] fivefold ministry in position in place
[24:26] that they said they had apostles
[24:28] prophets evangelists teachers and
[24:29] pastors why for further perfecting so
[24:31] but each one of those channels speaks to
[24:33] the people but it speaks through a
[24:35] different way
[24:36] the word doesn't change but it reaches
[24:39] you a different way so you know every
[24:46] every all fivefold ministry it all comes
[24:50] from one spirit
[24:52] it all comes from from one place one
[24:55] person speaking through those five
[24:57] channels so it doesn't so it only comes
[25:02] from God because we don't speak we don't
[25:05] speak of ourselves a true fivefold
[25:07] ministry doesn't speak for itself
[25:09] he's just mute until God gives him
[25:11] something to speak and then and then he
[25:13] speaks what God gives him because we are
[25:16] ordained of God but we're also required
[25:19] to speak as the Oracles of God we're
[25:22] standing here and we're supposed to
[25:23] speak as in God's stead we don't say we
[25:27] don't have our own thought we take what
[25:29] God see it people have no confidence
[25:34] well it shows I have no confidence in
[25:36] God I don't know why well I got down
[25:41] that path but you know what I just it
[25:44] felt good like that like that man said
[25:48] about the no boy said about the
[25:51] watermelon said this is good but there's
[25:53] more of it so so we're gonna eat some
[25:56] more of it
[25:57] but in there but in the Old Testament
[26:00] that the garments that they wore we know
[26:05] that there was two kinds of garments
[26:07] that were worn in in the Old Testament
[26:10] in it in the New Testament in the in the
[26:12] time of the scripture and there was two
[26:15] layers usually to the to the garments
[26:18] that was the undergarment was usually
[26:22] made like a tunic was a short had like a
[26:28] robe went over the shoulders came down
[26:30] usually attached sits with a belt but
[26:34] usually it was above the knees but went
[26:36] down to the knees and covered this part
[26:39] but then so that was the the
[26:43] undergarment but the the over garment
[26:46] that they wore was either usually called
[26:48] either a
[26:49] a mantle or a robe and it was long and
[26:54] flowing and it all went all the way to
[26:56] the floor and went down to the feet now
[26:59] the only time that we see in the
[27:01] scripture that when you study the Old
[27:02] Testament or any any of the scripture
[27:04] the only time that you see anybody being
[27:07] not dressed like that was number one was
[27:11] a slave or number two they were a
[27:13] soldier and usually because soldiers had
[27:17] to dress differently because they were
[27:19] in a battle and they had to they were
[27:21] couldn't be restricted so they had to be
[27:23] prepared to fight so there was less
[27:25] garment that they wore because they were
[27:28] in that they were there to Bible but
[27:31] that was only in a situation where they
[27:34] were going to war you know because you
[27:38] know when they dressed a certain way
[27:40] they were doing certain things but when
[27:42] they came to a different place
[27:45] they didn't dress the same way and so
[27:49] that'll make a little more sense later
[27:51] on but usually the the clothes they had
[27:54] the undergarment and then they had the
[27:56] over garment that they wore and it all
[27:58] went to the went to their feet and
[28:00] usually they were you know usually had
[28:04] belts in and the Cinch and you know
[28:06] different things but that's usually the
[28:07] way they were dressed they had a robe
[28:10] and so when it says that he has clothed
[28:12] us with the garments of salvation see
[28:16] when you talk about that the garment
[28:18] covered the person usually it went down
[28:22] the arms it went to the floor it covered
[28:23] the whole body and then when he says
[28:26] he's giving us the robe of righteousness
[28:30] well if he's put the robe of
[28:31] righteousness when you wear a robe see
[28:33] the robe covered the whole body so when
[28:36] you put this on you're covered but see
[28:39] then when when he comes on and he says
[28:41] you know that you have you're poor and
[28:44] you're wretched and negative when he
[28:45] rebuked this age they said you're naked
[28:48] well that you know when you look in the
[28:51] scripture you have to figure out it
[28:53] because sometimes in the scripture when
[28:56] the word when they use the word naked it
[28:57] doesn't mean like what we think it does
[28:59] now so we're going to look
[29:03] some of that tonight in the scripture
[29:05] but and in Genesis 12 and 25 when God
[29:14] says and they were both naked the man
[29:17] and his wife and we're not ashamed now
[29:21] that's the only place that I can find in
[29:23] scripture where it says that somebody
[29:26] was naked and they weren't ashamed or
[29:28] though they were naked and they didn't
[29:31] have shame or it didn't call shame
[29:33] because brother Branham said in the
[29:36] message Satan he Satan's Eden when he
[29:38] was talking about them he said what was
[29:41] it he said compare this now how much I
[29:44] like that men and his wife and both in
[29:46] God's eating without one stitch of
[29:48] clothes on them and knew it not for why
[29:51] didn't they know it for they were veiled
[29:53] to their senses of nakedness by the holy
[29:56] veil of the Holy Spirit they could look
[29:59] right at each other and they didn't know
[30:01] that they were naked they were veiled
[30:03] with the holy spirit of holiness they
[30:05] were veiled gods veiled yet today can
[30:08] look and not lust they turn their head
[30:09] it's a holy veil seat holy veil God had
[30:12] their eyes they were both they were both
[30:14] one was men and the other was woman and
[30:17] they did not know they were naked
[30:18] because of the holiness of God kept
[30:20] their eyes veiled notice God hid their
[30:23] conscience from sin by the holy veil so
[30:28] they were veiled by the Holy Ghost
[30:32] which is the same thing as we were
[30:34] reading here brother Branham was saying
[30:36] you're robed in the righteousness of God
[30:38] by the Holy Ghost it takes the Holy
[30:40] Ghost to value to cover you so we're
[30:43] covered by the Holy Ghost and that's
[30:45] what they had to see they were in a
[30:46] position that they did not were not
[30:49] ashamed of a cause they were available
[30:50] by the Holy Ghost and so that's what it
[30:54] takes today and brother Branham says in
[30:57] the message hear ye him he says speaking
[31:04] of a of the adoption when they were
[31:08] going through the adoption ceremony he
[31:13] says and it was a ceremony of adoption
[31:17] the child that had been born into the
[31:18] family become place by adoption in the
[31:21] family and after that that boy's name
[31:23] was just as good on a check as his
[31:25] daddy's was he was heir of all things he
[31:28] could take out he could put up he could
[31:31] fire he could hire he could do whatever
[31:33] he pleased to do because the ceremony of
[31:35] adoption had been made upon his son and
[31:38] he was clothed and was set in order now
[31:41] there's where the church ought to be
[31:43] today Jesus said these things that I do
[31:46] show you do also ask anything in my name
[31:49] I'll do it why are we scared of that
[31:51] what's the matter if Christ has closed
[31:54] us with the Holy Ghost and had been
[31:56] adopted into the family after being born
[31:58] again and been baptized into the body by
[32:01] the Holy Spirit if it's a true witness
[32:04] of God ask what you will and it shall be
[32:06] done unto you so if we have received
[32:11] that veil and received by the Holy Ghost
[32:13] being born again and been placed and
[32:16] we've received that then he said you
[32:18] should have what you have need of and
[32:21] ask what you have needed because you it
[32:23] is it's available to you
[32:38] so brother branham goes on and just
[32:42] gonna read a couple of quotes here this
[32:43] is from the approach of God and he says
[32:52] let's go down to the scroll down to the
[32:54] next one there brother he says he says
[32:58] and every man that comes that comes that
[33:00] approach dies to self comes to Christ
[33:04] regenerated born-again filled with the
[33:06] Holy Spirit the robe of God's
[33:09] righteousness given upon you and you
[33:11] live for Christ from then on your coming
[33:13] God's provided approach then you got new
[33:18] life in you the old life of sin has
[33:20] passed away the old carnal thoughts of
[33:22] that God wait yonder years ago God is a
[33:25] living being not only out yonder but
[33:28] right here right now all things that he
[33:30] said is the truth and you believe it
[33:32] every bit so we have received the the
[33:38] robe of his righteousness and we have
[33:41] received the new birth then we have
[33:44] received what we have need of then old
[33:45] things have passed away
[33:47] then all things have become new so if
[33:50] all things have been passed away then
[33:51] all of the other things that are in the
[33:53] past have done been done away with so
[33:56] then you know the then if we have a new
[34:00] look because we've become a new creature
[34:02] in Christ and if everything has become
[34:04] new to us then you know what
[34:05] there's no shouldn't be any kind of
[34:08] remembrance of the old things of life or
[34:11] the old way of living why because it's
[34:13] all done away with well because you know
[34:15] if you if you have the life of God
[34:18] inside of you and it becomes to be made
[34:20] manifest then then it has to it has to
[34:23] show on the outside you know because you
[34:26] know what whatever it is it all things
[34:30] any kind of seed that you plant in the
[34:32] ground you know at some point in time
[34:33] it's got to manifest itself because if
[34:35] it's if it's germinated to life and it's
[34:38] going to come forth when it comes up out
[34:39] of the ground you may not be able to
[34:41] tell it when it first comes up you may
[34:43] not know see it but you keep waiting on
[34:45] it and you keep waiting it as the water
[34:47] falls upon it and the Sun shines and
[34:49] time goes on it's going to manifest
[34:51] exactly what it is but see the thing is
[34:53] you and I because if we've received that
[34:55] then you know it has to come to life it
[34:57] has to come to fruition it has to have
[34:59] come to manifestation because you know
[35:01] the thing is is if you have if you say
[35:04] that you're born again and you and
[35:05] you've been received you've received
[35:07] this this life and then you've been
[35:09] robed in His righteousness then you know
[35:11] if nothing comes from your life then you
[35:14] know sometimes you have to start to
[35:15] wonder exactly what happened because you
[35:21] know I mean you know if you say so I'll
[35:24] have a house on fire on the windy day
[35:26] you know I mean there's there's got to
[35:29] be some kind of some kind of a showing
[35:32] of it it's got to be manifested it's got
[35:36] to show you know that's what that's what
[35:41] I want in my life I want I want that you
[35:44] know it's not that they see me I want
[35:46] them to see Jesus Christ I want to die
[35:48] out so much because I don't want
[35:50] anything of the old way I don't nothing
[35:52] of the old life I don't want to be
[35:53] completely gone so the only thing that
[35:55] they see is Jesus Christ when I speak
[35:58] when we'll walk everything because you
[36:00] know if he's called us to be his
[36:01] representatives and you know what
[36:03] then we represent exactly what the
[36:04] scripture says and you know because the
[36:10] devil is going to try you on that
[36:12] that's what his job is but greater is He
[36:19] that's in us than he that's in the world
[36:22] amen no going on yeah in the scripture
[36:34] what it talks about them being clothed
[36:38] and the opposite of being clothed and
[36:42] contrasting these two when you see
[36:44] somebody what was being clothed and then
[36:47] understanding what was being wonder what
[36:50] we call when the scripture says naked
[36:53] when they talk about people being naked
[36:55] well you know they're not always meaning
[36:58] what we think it's because in the
[37:01] scripture when you go back and look what
[37:04] just like
[37:04] job said I believe a job said you know I
[37:06] come in naked I come in this world naked
[37:08] I go way out you because you know you
[37:11] you come in this world no clothes here
[37:15] you come but when you in the scripture
[37:16] when it talks about that because in the
[37:19] Old Testament and even in the scriptural
[37:21] times if you go back and look they had a
[37:23] level of modesty that what they
[37:27] considered being naked and one of the
[37:31] things that they talk about is like and
[37:33] some of the scriptures that when you
[37:35] talk about nakedness and you talked
[37:38] about it being shameful gonna give you a
[37:42] few scriptures here Exodus 30 to 25 says
[37:46] and when Moses saw that the people were
[37:48] naked for Aaron had made them naked unto
[37:51] their shame among their enemies and then
[37:55] Isaiah Isaiah 20 go just continue right
[38:00] here he says at the same time spake the
[38:02] Lord I of baza
[38:03] Isaiah the son of Emma's saying go and
[38:08] loose the Sackhoff from off thy loins
[38:10] and put off the shoe from my foot and he
[38:13] did so walking naked and barefoot and
[38:16] the Lord said like as my servant
[38:19] Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot
[38:21] three years for a sign and wander upon
[38:23] Egypt and upon Ethiopia so shall the
[38:27] king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
[38:30] prisoners and the Egyptians captives
[38:34] young and old naked and barefoot even
[38:37] with their buttocks uncovered to the
[38:39] shame of Egypt now one of this when you
[38:42] go back and look say we think as the
[38:45] scripture tells us and some of the
[38:47] passages we say that its nakedness means
[38:49] nude no clothes but what say when we
[38:53] read about Isaiah see they say that
[38:57] Isaiah didn't walk around and like we
[39:01] think he did he walked around in his
[39:04] underwear because he was walking because
[39:08] that in the scriptural times that meant
[39:11] that he was naked and the contrasting
[39:15] here is because when they ride on and
[39:17] they come down here
[39:18] they say that the when they capped when
[39:20] the Egyptians and the Egyptians were
[39:22] taken captive it says that their
[39:24] buttocks were uncovered so it's making a
[39:27] distinction between here and here
[39:29] showing that they there was a difference
[39:32] between the way that Isaiah walked
[39:34] before the people and the reason why the
[39:38] reason why that Egypt and Ethiopia was
[39:41] in this condition was because Egypt and
[39:45] Ethiopia had God made known to them
[39:47] because God had spoke to them and they
[39:49] rejected him because when you reject God
[39:52] then they went into captivity and then
[39:55] all of a sudden then you see the
[39:57] nakedness coming out there shamefulness
[39:59] being made know why because they had
[40:01] turned the word down and so it was a
[40:06] shameful thing that god's prophet walked
[40:09] out there in front of all the people and
[40:11] they thought my goodness here's god's
[40:12] prophet walking around naked well he
[40:15] wasn't he wasn't naked as we think he
[40:17] was but he was improperly clothed but
[40:20] then he told the people he said but it's
[40:22] your shamefulness because you've turned
[40:24] the word down that you're going to walk
[40:26] the same way but the problem is as they
[40:27] walk with no clothes and here they are
[40:31] they went back into captivity with
[40:33] Assyrians because they had turn turn the
[40:36] word down and that's if we go on to the
[40:43] next scripture here John 21 verse 7
[40:46] speaks the same thing because you know a
[40:48] lot of people a lot of people ask about
[40:50] these questions you know have questions
[40:51] about this and there's Peter says and
[40:54] before they disciple whom Jesus loved
[40:55] Seth under Peter it is the Lord
[40:57] now when Simon Peter heard that it was
[40:59] the Lord he Girt his Fisher's coat upon
[41:02] him for he was naked and he did cast
[41:03] himself into the sea now when you go
[41:06] back in look see when they were fishing
[41:10] with other men out in the water and
[41:12] there was no women around they didn't
[41:15] have their outer garments on they were
[41:17] fishing basically he was fishing in his
[41:19] underwear he was fishing in his
[41:21] undergarments because that's the way
[41:24] they did because it allowed them to work
[41:26] more but when he realized that Jesus was
[41:29] on the shore and he wanted to go see him
[41:32] see then there would have been women on
[41:33] the shore then that's the reason he gird
[41:34] itself because he didn't want to be seen
[41:37] unclothed because that would have been
[41:40] the modest thing for the time so then he
[41:42] would have grated his coat and put on so
[41:44] when when you say that your are when
[41:47] they talk about Peter being naked and
[41:49] Isiah being naked well it wasn't that
[41:50] they were naked as we think they were
[41:52] it's because they were improperly
[41:54] clothed for their position so when when
[42:00] God sets God sets the standard for what
[42:04] the for what is naked because that's
[42:08] what he carried to the people that said
[42:09] that's where they got their idea what
[42:11] they what was a standard for being naked
[42:14] and being clothed so we understand it
[42:20] these things are what what God has said
[42:25] in the scripture so if you go to Isaiah
[42:32] 47 it says come down and sit in the dust
[42:39] old virgin daughter of Babylon sit on
[42:42] the ground there is no throne o daughter
[42:45] the Chaldeans for thou shall no more be
[42:47] called tender and delicate take the mill
[42:50] stones and grind mill uncover thy locks
[42:52] make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass
[42:55] over the rivers that Nick and this shall
[42:58] be uncovered gave a shame shall be seen
[43:00] I will take vengeance and I will not
[43:02] meet thee as a man now when you go back
[43:07] in look when they're speaking of Babylon
[43:09] the Babylon was going in to captivity
[43:13] because they had turned the word down
[43:16] God had spoke to babble on and babble on
[43:18] rejected so as they were going into
[43:21] captivity now see I want you to see this
[43:24] one thing when lots of times when they
[43:27] speak in the Old Testament when they
[43:29] start talking of this it's captivity
[43:33] because you know brother Branham talks
[43:36] about and lifting him up out of history
[43:37] and he talks about the way the men he
[43:40] was talking about Amram and Jochebed
[43:41] praying because of the bondage and
[43:44] everything going on
[43:45] and trying to raise up Moses and looking
[43:48] for a deliverer and what was going to
[43:49] take place and brother Branham says look
[43:50] at today he said two young men are
[43:52] dressed
[43:53] he said they got their pants down below
[43:54] their hips carrying a pistol and
[43:56] everything he said what is it he said
[43:57] it's slavery to the devil its bondage to
[44:00] Satan so when you're looking at this
[44:03] what you're seeing this it's all has to
[44:06] do with being bondage you cannot be free
[44:09] and dress like this because in the Old
[44:12] Testament a slave dressed immodest well
[44:17] if you're dressing immodest then what
[44:19] does it show you're bound by some of
[44:23] you're bound by spirit so when you when
[44:27] you come to this now look no I want you
[44:30] understand here they are they're coming
[44:31] this says thou shall be no more called
[44:33] tender and delicate because this lady
[44:36] had a position because it's just like a
[44:40] church it's a woman it's an empire that
[44:44] had a position but all of a sudden she
[44:47] decides that she's gonna walk away she's
[44:51] going to become an immoral woman so God
[44:56] is going if you read the if you read the
[44:58] commentaries God is going to shame this
[45:02] woman for what she's done so she's got
[45:06] to cross over the river to go in to
[45:10] tribulation so here says take the mill
[45:14] stones grinding the mill uncover thy
[45:16] locks one of the things that women also
[45:19] wore in the Old Testament excuse me the
[45:21] word in the Old Testament was a veil and
[45:24] they you take so she's taking her veil
[45:27] off so you remember we saw about the
[45:29] holy holy spirit brother em say there's
[45:31] a holy veil so she's thinking so she's
[45:33] she's showing also it's showing that
[45:34] she's doing away with her covering she's
[45:38] doing away with this says make bear the
[45:41] leg uncovered the thigh passed over the
[45:43] rivers so she's got a cross over the
[45:45] river so what is she doing she's pulling
[45:48] up her skirts because she's starting to
[45:51] walk into the water and now she's
[45:54] pulling up so he said make bear the leg
[45:57] uncover the fire
[45:59] Passover the rivers then thy nakedness
[46:03] remember when we talked about the robe
[46:05] the undergarment went down but when
[46:08] you're clothed when you're robed the
[46:12] went to the ankles but here we see this
[46:15] woman
[46:15] so uncover the the lock to make bear the
[46:18] leg uncover the thigh pass over the
[46:20] river so here she is as she starts to
[46:22] walk through the water she's pulling up
[46:24] her garments now she wasn't naked
[46:29] she wasn't bare because they sewing that
[46:32] she's pulling up her garments but but
[46:36] God says you're naked because you're
[46:38] uncovering yourself so here you are
[46:41] pulling up your garments then your make
[46:44] yourself naked whenever brother branham
[46:48] said he said what has happened in our
[46:50] day he said the women have become that
[46:52] kid again and he said they don't
[46:54] understand what people say well I got
[46:56] clothes on I'm not naked
[46:58] well are you following the Bible
[47:01] definition of nakedness are you
[47:03] following your own definition are you
[47:06] are you being robed in God's
[47:07] righteousness by his word are you
[47:09] following your own righteousness which
[47:11] are filthy rags also I didn't tell you
[47:15] the word rags means a filthy garment
[47:20] it's a worn-out garment so you've got a
[47:22] filthy worn-out garment that's what
[47:24] you're robed in you're dressed in your
[47:27] one because it's no good it's worthless
[47:30] that's reason they seem to put on his
[47:32] garment his raiment so when people say
[47:36] what is what its nakedness he said well
[47:38] if the people don't if the women don't
[47:40] realize they're naked
[47:41] he said if an apple caused them to
[47:44] realize they were naked he said it's
[47:45] time to pass the apples again so if you
[47:48] people wonder why there's certain
[47:50] standards one because God's Word said so
[47:53] he said you know we can we can wear
[47:55] certain things well you know every time
[47:57] you you know as brother Donny Reagan
[47:59] said he said they try to stretch poly
[48:01] from Esther trying to cover up their
[48:03] legs trying to cover up their knees well
[48:08] the problem is is why because God said
[48:10] you
[48:12] don't dress this way why because it
[48:14] shows that you're immoral God didn't
[48:18] tell people to dress in modest apparel
[48:20] than just so you know it's just a flip
[48:21] of the coin or just whichever way you
[48:23] think why God set a standard in the
[48:26] scripture a what immoral is what
[48:31] nakedness is so if you go around showing
[48:35] off all your legs pulling up you dirts
[48:37] get shorter and shorter and shorter it
[48:39] shows that you're naked that's what God
[48:45] said that wasn't that's nobody else's
[48:49] standard that's God's standard whether
[48:55] you got whether you believe that or not
[48:59] that's what he said
[49:01] you just have to argue with him I'm just
[49:02] gonna tell you what he said and
[49:17] continuing on let's go to Revelation
[49:19] chapter 16 revelation 16 behold I come
[49:28] as a thief blessed he's that watches and
[49:30] keepeth his garments lest he walk naked
[49:33] and they see his shame so and here's
[49:37] another one speaking of being clothed
[49:38] watching your garments keeping your
[49:39] garments why because if you're not then
[49:43] you're walking without clothes and
[49:44] you're not meeting the standard of what
[49:46] clothing is not being robed and and then
[49:53] continue on there's got a few scriptures
[49:55] here I want to look at 2nd Corinthians
[49:57] chapter 5 beginning in verse 1 here it
[50:01] says for we know that if our earthly
[50:03] house of this.timer Knakal were
[50:05] dissolved we have a building of God and
[50:07] house not made with hands eternal in the
[50:09] heavens
[50:10] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[50:12] to be clothed upon now what so watch
[50:14] what listen to the words reading the
[50:17] words that Paul says and how he
[50:18] describes this he said earnestly
[50:22] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[50:24] house which is from heaven
[50:26] if so that being clothed we shall not be
[50:28] found naked he said for we that have the
[50:35] four we that are in this tabernacle do
[50:38] groan being burdened not for that which
[50:41] we would be unclothed but clothed upon
[50:44] that mortality might be swallowed up in
[50:46] life
[50:47] now he that hath robbed us for the self
[50:50] same thing is God who also have given
[50:53] unto us the earnest of the spirit now
[50:56] when you go back and read this scripture
[50:58] Paul speaking of this earthly house this
[51:02] tabernacle that we're in and what so
[51:05] what so amazing is the way here what he
[51:07] describes this being a house or a
[51:10] tendons in some translations it
[51:12] translates it as a tent but he says we
[51:15] have one that if this one it's dissolved
[51:18] he said we'd have a house not made with
[51:20] hands eternal in the heavens he said for
[51:22] in this we groan we've grown in this
[51:25] because nobody wants to live in this but
[51:28] listen listen to how he describes us
[51:30] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[51:32] with our house which is from heaven so
[51:34] while we're here were wanting to take on
[51:36] this other one they said if so that we
[51:40] being clothed we shall not be found
[51:47] improperly clothed because you are not
[51:53] in your right to be state so we even if
[51:56] you go beyond here and you put on bow
[51:58] and you're still not in the right to be
[52:00] place but here we don't want to be in
[52:05] this place what because if you're if
[52:08] you're a pilgrim and a stranger if
[52:10] you're a sojourner in this land and you
[52:12] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:14] nobody wants to live in this pest house
[52:16] nobody wants to live in Satan's Eden
[52:18] nobody wants to have to go through this
[52:20] why because we desire to be fulfilled in
[52:23] the Word of God to have the fullness of
[52:25] the word in our lives and so here we are
[52:28] he says that we want to be clothed that
[52:30] we won't be found and properly clothed
[52:32] why because you don't want to stand on
[52:34] that day of judgment and not be found
[52:36] improperly clothes
[52:37] why because if you've not have his
[52:39] righteousness then what are you going to
[52:41] say on the day of judgement when you're
[52:43] standing there not clothed in the
[52:45] righteousness of God what is going to be
[52:47] your answer well because you don't have
[52:49] an answer as in the scripture when Jesus
[52:55] said the man came to in the wedding
[52:57] garment and they came to the wedding and
[52:59] he didn't have the wedding garment on
[53:00] and he stood there and he said friend
[53:01] why have you come to the wedding without
[53:03] the garment one because it was a free
[53:05] gift everyone that came in the proper
[53:08] way was cleaned and greeted and was
[53:10] given a robe you were robed for the
[53:13] wedding he said why did you not come the
[53:17] same with the way that you should have
[53:18] come and he said and he was speechless
[53:21] well because we have to give an account
[53:23] for what we've done and how we dress and
[53:26] how we acted how we conduct ourselves
[53:27] and you know what if we go to that day
[53:29] and stand before God and we have to give
[53:31] it count you know what we don't have an
[53:33] excuse we don't have an excuse of why we
[53:37] don't dress right an act right and we
[53:39] don't fulfill the Word of God says for
[53:47] we and this tabernacle do groan being
[53:49] burden not that we would be unclothed so
[53:54] we don't want to do away with this
[53:57] now want you to Kate I want you to catch
[53:59] the wording that Paul says we don't want
[54:01] to take this off you know brother
[54:07] Branham said he said in Africa and he
[54:11] said in Africa he said those women were
[54:13] naked hanging said they were laying
[54:14] there he said when the Holy Ghost came
[54:16] upon them he said they covered their
[54:18] arms and walked out of the men's
[54:20] presence and when they came back they
[54:21] were clothed but he said today he said
[54:24] the modern people they take more clothes
[54:26] off
[54:27] he said they walk around naked he said
[54:29] and they want to be Christians he said
[54:31] the heathens try to live with a
[54:33] Christian life and will actually put on
[54:35] clothes and he said the Christians are
[54:37] trying to be heathens he said it shows
[54:39] that we got a bunch of idiots but see he
[54:44] said we're not going to take this off he
[54:45] said we want to be clothed upon so we're
[54:48] not going to do away we don't want to do
[54:50] what
[54:50] with this we want to have more clothes
[54:52] put on then how if this is what he's
[54:57] speaking that how nor does anybody think
[54:58] that we're gonna take more clothes off
[55:01] there's no place in the scripture that
[55:03] talks about taking clothes off so the
[55:09] thing is is and just speaking in the
[55:11] natural terms and if I'm wrong on
[55:14] anything then brother Dale can
[55:15] straighten me out but the thing is is
[55:16] this if you if you walk around and you
[55:18] have a question about whether something
[55:20] fits or not or you think it's it's a
[55:22] little bit of a modest story a little
[55:23] bit any moral thing guess what if it
[55:25] hang a little bit longer if it ain't a
[55:26] little bit looser if it ain't got a
[55:27] little more coffee to it you probably
[55:29] need to choose the one that's a little
[55:31] bigger a little bit longer nowhere in
[55:35] the Bible you gonna find it so what
[55:36] we're gonna take this off no Paul says
[55:38] we don't want to be unclothed we're not
[55:41] going to take anything off we want more
[55:42] clothes at at home he says now more
[55:45] telling might be swallowed up of life
[55:47] why because we want something added we
[55:50] wanted to keep putting on the Word of
[55:52] God that this mortal will take on
[55:55] immortality so it's going to be adding
[55:58] home said now he that hath brought us
[56:04] for the self same thing is God who have
[56:07] given unto us the earnest of the Spirit
[56:12] so if we if we received the earnest of
[56:15] the Spirit then you know what this
[56:17] applies to us with just the earnest of
[56:20] the Spirit you know if you're born again
[56:27] and you're just a newborn babe in Christ
[56:28] then you know what you have you have
[56:30] this and you know what we don't want to
[56:35] have to be unclothed but you know we
[56:39] desire to be clothed more upon when no
[56:44] wonder brother Branham said you can't
[56:46] get a board again woman to put on their
[56:48] mortal clothes you can't see how a woman
[56:49] went around in a pair of shorts or a
[56:51] pair of pants some shirt skirts or runs
[56:54] way up above her knees some kind of
[56:56] split and scandal skirts and all kinds
[56:58] of stuff why because there's no place in
[57:00] the scripture why because that the Holy
[57:01] Ghost is there
[57:02] then the Holy Ghost is going to match
[57:04] the word 1 because what what goes on
[57:08] down here and the natural is a type of
[57:10] the spiritual so we want to put on we
[57:17] want to put on Christ we're not taking
[57:19] anything off we won't 1 because when you
[57:21] put it on then guess what he's the one
[57:23] that's obligated to put it off
[57:27] everybody's like well I want to try to
[57:29] get rid of this and try to get rid of
[57:30] that you know the problem is is
[57:32] everybody tries together tries to get
[57:33] rid of everything themselves you know
[57:35] what if you get in the word and let God
[57:37] get in you then you know what he takes
[57:39] care of the business of cleaning you up
[57:44] it's a problem you know because you know
[57:46] like I said our righteousness is filthy
[57:48] rags so you know what you're not going
[57:50] to ever get good enough you're not ever
[57:51] gonna get yourself right it ain't never
[57:54] gonna work right but you've got to put
[57:57] on Christ you got to put on the robe of
[57:59] righteousness his righteousness his law
[58:02] his word if we put if we put on Christ
[58:09] then you know what then he can do the
[58:11] work first Timothy 2:9 it says in like
[58:25] manner that women should adorn
[58:28] themselves in modest apparel so when you
[58:35] look at the word modest so everybody
[58:39] says like well you know I've got my own
[58:40] definition of what modest is well you
[58:42] know what it means one of the
[58:43] definitions is unassuming so you're not
[58:47] going to draw attention to yourself well
[58:50] let me tell you if you put on something
[58:52] that shows every inch and every curve
[58:54] and every little thing on you then you
[58:56] know what it's not unassuming the other
[59:02] definition for this word is adequate
[59:07] brother Branham said women walk around
[59:09] and ain't got enough clothes to water
[59:11] must get shotgun that's not adequate
[59:15] it also means satisfactory well if you
[59:19] can't want a shotgun or he said or fill
[59:22] up an aspirin bottle than our aspirin
[59:24] box the you know I didn't ain't ain't
[59:26] adequate and ain't satisfactory and the
[59:31] other thing it says it also means well
[59:33] arranged well you know if it if it has
[59:40] down here and out this way in that way
[59:42] and it splits here and there you know
[59:44] what it ain't adequate it ain't
[59:46] unassuming in a satisfactory and it
[59:57] ain't well arranged well I may not get a
[1:00:03] lot of amens tonight but listen it's
[1:00:07] still the truth where you like it or not
[1:00:08] and you know what it don't matter if it
[1:00:10] if it hurts me hurts you hurts whoever
[1:00:12] you know it's still the truth and you
[1:00:14] know what because somebody and somebody
[1:00:15] is and we're obligated to the word to
[1:00:17] know this and everybody says well why
[1:00:21] why are we supposed to wear it dressed a
[1:00:22] certain way why are we supposed to act a
[1:00:24] certain way why because God put it in
[1:00:26] his word and you know what he takes the
[1:00:28] Holy Ghost now if you have the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost the Holy Ghost will come and and
[1:00:32] you'll speak to you out of the word on
[1:00:34] how to dress people think well we're
[1:00:39] just we just the Holy Ghost will come no
[1:00:41] God wrote it in his word but not a lot
[1:00:47] of people don't don't believe that but
[1:00:49] that's alright you know I just I just
[1:00:52] choose to believe what what the Bible
[1:00:54] says and that's what iswhat I see and
[1:00:56] that's what I that's what I believe and
[1:00:58] if nobody else agrees with or believes
[1:00:59] that's okay they're the ones has to
[1:01:01] answer to God on there but all I have to
[1:01:03] do is say what I believe and what God
[1:01:05] tells me to say we need to dress the way
[1:01:10] God wants us to why because it's a type
[1:01:13] of being dressed in the Word of God
[1:01:15] putting on holiness
[1:01:25] so they get done here in a little bit so
[1:01:31] just got a few more here's from the
[1:01:33] message presuming brother Brown says he
[1:01:37] says I heard someone say as I was saying
[1:01:39] at the beginning of message back here a
[1:01:41] few days ago I was in a place some of
[1:01:43] them now you have to wear Elijah's
[1:01:45] garment my there's no more more
[1:01:48] different garments and touching handle
[1:01:50] and sensations I ever heard in my life
[1:01:52] now just let it go blank go blank hold
[1:01:56] your head back good honest people go
[1:01:59] blank don't think of nothing just let
[1:02:01] your mind completely blank now see I
[1:02:03] believe God oh I believe we're going to
[1:02:05] he's you're going to give me the
[1:02:08] Elijah's garment he said I don't want
[1:02:10] Elijah's garment I want the Holy Ghost I
[1:02:13] want to come upon the basis of this word
[1:02:16] I want to come on with the knowledge see
[1:02:19] I come upon God believing that I can't
[1:02:23] be covered with the largest garment I
[1:02:25] don't want to be covered with the
[1:02:26] garment I want to be covered with the
[1:02:28] garment of the righteousness of God
[1:02:30] clothing his righteous the garment that
[1:02:33] we want then continuing on let's go to
[1:02:38] Jehovah Jireh 1964 and brother Branham
[1:02:42] after the battle is over the real
[1:02:44] believer has fought the enemy broke down
[1:02:46] the lines and tried to capture his
[1:02:48] brother the real seed of Abraham
[1:02:50] bringing back that wayward brother male
[1:02:52] kids that came out served him bread and
[1:02:54] wine communion giving communion after
[1:02:56] the battle was over served the communion
[1:02:57] to him after the battle a very beautiful
[1:03:00] type when the battle is over here on
[1:03:01] earth the victories have been won jesus
[1:03:04] said that they would eat it anew and the
[1:03:06] father's Kingdom after the way word had
[1:03:08] been brought back then the first thing
[1:03:10] we do when we get in after the battle is
[1:03:12] over is sitting out at the battle in the
[1:03:14] kingdom of God and those that has fought
[1:03:16] and sat down and overcome shall be
[1:03:18] clothed in the righteousness of Christ
[1:03:20] and then again they take the bread and
[1:03:22] wine in the father's kingdom on the
[1:03:24] other side what a real picture of this
[1:03:26] of Abraham going out and getting a lot
[1:03:28] and bringing him back in so I'm just
[1:03:33] going to continue I just got a couple
[1:03:34] more quotes I'm more finish up and this
[1:03:38] from Stan's steel in 1957 brother Bram
[1:03:41] says this is what I was talking about
[1:03:44] earlier where he says he says those
[1:03:46] naked women 5 minutes before they didn't
[1:03:48] know they were naked and as soon as the
[1:03:50] Holy Spirit struck that bunch then women
[1:03:52] folded their arms and walked off the
[1:03:54] ground now you mean to tell me in your
[1:03:56] modern churches you let the women strip
[1:03:58] themselves off out here half naked
[1:04:00] before men and tell me that is
[1:04:03] Christianity it's worse than heathens
[1:04:05] heathen can realize and accept Christ
[1:04:07] they'll cover up their nakedness and
[1:04:10] you're trying to expose yourself to be
[1:04:12] modern I don't want to be rude but
[1:04:13] brother one of these days I've got to
[1:04:16] stand before the presence of God and
[1:04:18] give an account for everything I say and
[1:04:20] I'm not going to hold anything back I'm
[1:04:22] going to say it instead of becoming
[1:04:24] civilized we're becoming idiots that's
[1:04:26] right civilization is broke so we are
[1:04:34] responsible to say what God said and say
[1:04:41] exactly what he said
[1:04:48] then continuing on here perfect strength
[1:04:51] and perfect weakness he said Paul said I
[1:04:54] can have I can move mountains with faith
[1:04:58] I can heal the sick I can have knowledge
[1:05:00] of the Bible I can go to a seminary and
[1:05:02] learn all this stuff everything said I'm
[1:05:04] nothing yet hallelujah oh my talk about
[1:05:07] the lid coming off the kettle demons
[1:05:09] going around powers of the devil under
[1:05:11] the name of Christianity teaching for
[1:05:13] doctoring the commandments of men
[1:05:15] Theological Seminary doctrines leaving
[1:05:18] the Bible alone hallelujah who's who
[1:05:20] strong enough who's wise enough who's
[1:05:22] powerful enough to tame this Legion of
[1:05:24] stripping the clothes off of our women
[1:05:26] in the name of preachers Methodists
[1:05:28] Baptists and even Pentecostal painting
[1:05:30] their faces like Jezebel and bobbing
[1:05:31] their hair and wearing paints just like
[1:05:33] men our preachers not enough to get up
[1:05:36] about them to tell them about it
[1:05:37] devil possessed it was the Legion that
[1:05:40] tore his clothes off of him who is this
[1:05:43] roaring devil who's strong enough
[1:05:46] what kind of denomination able to
[1:05:48] conquer him walking up and down through
[1:05:50] these tombs
[1:05:51] of the denominations crying the days of
[1:05:53] miracles has passed and we don't need
[1:05:55] the Holy Ghost and who contain the devil
[1:05:58] God we can't do it by denomination we
[1:06:00] can't do it by classical forces but
[1:06:03] there was a voice one time that did it
[1:06:05] Amen that tame them Devils that put them
[1:06:08] in their mind and put clothes on them
[1:06:10] that same voice gives us a promise the
[1:06:13] works that I do shall you do also you'll
[1:06:15] never do it under ecclesiastical
[1:06:17] gasoline and a carbon struck car you'll
[1:06:20] never do it in an organization you'll
[1:06:22] never do it when you you'll do it when
[1:06:24] you empty up and become weak pour out
[1:06:26] all yourself and let the Holy Ghost come
[1:06:28] in and flood over every part of you
[1:06:30] saturate every lid of your body that's
[1:06:32] the only way you'll do it we don't need
[1:06:34] any organization the works that I do
[1:06:40] show you do all so well because the Holy
[1:06:43] Ghost has been given to us because if we
[1:06:53] have if we have a need if the Holy Ghost
[1:06:56] has been given to us and if you don't
[1:06:59] have the Holy Ghost if you don't have it
[1:07:01] then that's what brother Dale has been
[1:07:02] preaching on one because there is a way
[1:07:05] mate it's as simple as it can be but the
[1:07:08] problem is is you've got to come and and
[1:07:11] and Gibbs before God and pour yourself
[1:07:13] out as he said and wait on God and allow
[1:07:16] him to come and move on you because if
[1:07:19] you will if you will come before him
[1:07:21] because if he's if he's speaking to your
[1:07:23] heart then you need to yield to him but
[1:07:25] the problem is is people don't know how
[1:07:27] to yield people don't know how to stand
[1:07:29] still and wait on the Holy Spirit to
[1:07:31] come to them they want to try to figure
[1:07:34] it out on their own or some kind of some
[1:07:37] kind of program or whatever else but the
[1:07:39] thing is it takes a dying out and the
[1:07:41] problem is as long as you're crying out
[1:07:43] to God then you yield yourself than God
[1:07:45] is morally obligated to come to your
[1:07:47] position your place and speak to your
[1:07:49] heart and tell you how to move forward
[1:07:52] but the problem is like you said people
[1:07:54] don't stay here long enough stand still
[1:07:56] long enough why because you know there
[1:07:58] isn't no old-fashioned altars and you
[1:08:00] don't have to have an altar up here but
[1:08:02] you have an altar in your home
[1:08:03] they all the holder is here but the
[1:08:05] place is that you need to go find a
[1:08:07] place somewhere where they're like
[1:08:08] brother branham said me I'm going to the
[1:08:10] cave and I'm going to get an answer from
[1:08:12] God and I'm not coming out and he said
[1:08:14] if I don't come back tell the boss to
[1:08:17] hire somebody else you know the problem
[1:08:20] is is we never cut down to business with
[1:08:22] God just like that just like that man
[1:08:25] was out there in that field that time
[1:08:26] and he said lord if you don't give me
[1:08:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:08:29] find a bear of bones right here one
[1:08:32] because people don't come to that and
[1:08:37] you know what it's just like it doesn't
[1:08:38] require that all the time but you know
[1:08:40] what you've got to mean business with
[1:08:41] God you've got to meet him and men and
[1:08:44] sell out everything but people don't
[1:08:48] know how to do that people don't know
[1:08:50] how to sell out people's are well you
[1:08:55] know they just want to come up here and
[1:08:56] have brother Dale lay hands on and you
[1:08:58] know that's gonna fix their problems it
[1:09:01] takes more than that you know the whole
[1:09:05] of the whole world the whole world and
[1:09:06] the whole theology of the whole wide
[1:09:08] world is to come up here and we're just
[1:09:10] gonna believe that's like the whole
[1:09:12] theology of the whole wide world is just
[1:09:14] to believe you know God done it all and
[1:09:16] he does it all and all we got to do is
[1:09:18] just believe in him and he could do
[1:09:20] everything else what the thing is is you
[1:09:23] know what you got to put a little time
[1:09:24] in a little effort in yourself I mean
[1:09:29] can you can you imagine how many of you
[1:09:33] ever went to school and so you know I
[1:09:34] never cracked the book I never read well
[1:09:39] you know what how many how many of y'all
[1:09:41] would like to stick your hand in that
[1:09:42] panel over there Hemet Hemis ever worked
[1:09:45] on electricity how many one put your
[1:09:46] hand in that panel right there
[1:09:47] how many people won't work on it well
[1:09:51] you know what the thing is if you've
[1:09:52] never if you've never had to experience
[1:09:53] one because it takes a little time you
[1:09:55] know because you know what everybody
[1:09:57] thinks well you know you just jump in
[1:09:58] and everything but you know what there's
[1:09:59] a time that you got to open a book and
[1:10:01] you know what when I went to school you
[1:10:03] know we had books and you know they come
[1:10:04] out there and they give us things and
[1:10:06] you know we had to read well you know
[1:10:10] what if you don't read if you don't
[1:10:11] study that how the world gods ever gonna
[1:10:13] speak to you
[1:10:15] god no said I'll speak to you in the
[1:10:17] wind why because he ordained a way to
[1:10:20] speak to you this was this was what the
[1:10:24] Holy Spirit they said the scripture but
[1:10:27] they Peter said did the Holy Spirit came
[1:10:29] upon me and they were moved to write as
[1:10:31] a Holy Ghost spoke to him they were
[1:10:35] moved by the Holy Ghost to write and you
[1:10:38] know what he's kept this all the way
[1:10:40] down through here all those years and
[1:10:42] everything and you know what this right
[1:10:43] here is vindicated and everybody and
[1:10:48] people people don't pick this up and
[1:10:50] read it and when we got people well you
[1:10:54] know we're just gonna we're just gonna
[1:10:55] listen to what the Prophet had to say
[1:10:56] we're gonna listen to what they'll have
[1:10:57] a prophet had to say well you know what
[1:10:59] brother Branham said the only way that
[1:11:01] you go get closer to God he didn't say
[1:11:03] sitting listening to me he said how do
[1:11:06] we get closer to God he said it more
[1:11:08] than once he said read your Bible and
[1:11:10] pray he didn't say just listen to me Mom
[1:11:18] because he said finally he said faith
[1:11:20] final resting places in the word he said
[1:11:22] then you've got to come back to the word
[1:11:24] you've got to read this one because what
[1:11:28] he said on those tapes lays right here
[1:11:34] but it takes but he takes more than just
[1:11:36] listening to brother Branham and I don't
[1:11:40] and I don't I don't not listening to
[1:11:42] brother Branham one bit I think I think
[1:11:44] we ought to listen to anymore
[1:11:46] the thing is you've got to get in this
[1:11:49] word right here
[1:11:49] why because everything that brother
[1:11:51] Brent have said come out of here people
[1:11:55] are trying to find where everything your
[1:11:57] brother Branham said well this is wrong
[1:11:58] we can't figure this out whatever what
[1:12:00] the thing is is you got to go back to
[1:12:01] the word and the problem is is
[1:12:05] everybody's trying to figure it out on
[1:12:07] their own like they got the mentality to
[1:12:10] do that
[1:12:16] like they got the mentality to do that
[1:12:23] you know the old saying that says
[1:12:26] it's a better to be thought a fool then
[1:12:30] open your mouth and remove all doubt and
[1:12:33] the other saying is is there's only one
[1:12:34] successful substitute for brains and
[1:12:36] that's silence that's why we need to be
[1:12:49] but if we can listen to God and allow
[1:12:52] him to speak then he can speak to us
[1:12:56] then how do we get robed in His
[1:12:58] righteousness by the plan that he give
[1:13:02] us he give us the word and we get in the
[1:13:05] word and if you're in the word then the
[1:13:08] word gets in you because you know it
[1:13:14] takes it takes an experience with God
[1:13:16] but you know other thing is if you don't
[1:13:18] get because if you know if you're not in
[1:13:21] the word and digging in the word and
[1:13:23] land before God in the word then you
[1:13:25] know how is he ever gonna speak to you
[1:13:31] because it's just like it's just like
[1:13:33] speaking a foreign language because God
[1:13:38] you know because we're carnal and
[1:13:41] there's enmity between us but you know
[1:13:44] what there comes a time when you start
[1:13:46] to learn the heavenly language why
[1:13:48] because you become one with him that he
[1:13:50] can speak to you that he becomes able to
[1:13:55] speak to you oh through your journey you
[1:14:02] know sometimes it takes it takes a
[1:14:03] little while for people to get to the
[1:14:05] place where they can stop and listen
[1:14:06] listen to what God wants to say to them
[1:14:09] to listen to what God is speaking but
[1:14:15] then you know it takes a little bit time
[1:14:17] but you know what God will come on the
[1:14:19] scene and speak to you this is from the
[1:14:26] message secondhand robe he says speaking
[1:14:31] of Elijah putting on the robe of Elijah
[1:14:34] he said no Elijah robe wrapped in the
[1:14:37] robe of Elijah the Prophet what a
[1:14:39] conquerors March how he walked reading
[1:14:42] ahead as a conqueror he had heard the
[1:14:44] promise he felt the power he was walking
[1:14:46] like a warrior right down to Jordan
[1:14:48] praise be to God friends every believer

[1:14:52] righteousness of God is walking towards
[1:14:55] the Jordan Road that's right

[1:15:00] and walking as a conqueror amen fear not
[1:15:03] I have overcome the world yes sir

[1:15:09] a second-handed robe on but feeling like
[1:15:11] a conqueror correctly coming through the
[1:15:14] Jordan brother let's let me say this and
[1:15:16] respects you don't you put on somebody

[1:15:31] through it leaking all through you put
[1:15:33] on the robe of the Conqueror Christ
[1:15:35] don't trust in your church who once
[1:15:38] taught salvation by the baptism of the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost who once stole divine healing
[1:15:42] and now deny it all eat up with the moss
[1:15:45] of doubt and everything else put on the
[1:15:47] robe of him that never lost the battle
[1:15:49] for your own your road to Jordan
