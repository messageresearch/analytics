[8:47] and you know we have a we have a
[8:50] real Christian
[8:52] holiday um you know this is this is the
[8:55] one that uh was instituted by
[8:59] one of my favorite presidents probably
[9:02] my favorite President was Abraham
[9:05] Lincoln and uh uh y'all don't know this
[9:09] but I was born on his 165th
[9:13] birthday so if you you can kind of
[9:15] figure out how old I
[9:17] am I'm not as old as he but but uh we we
[9:21] share the we share the same birthday so
[9:23] but uh you know it was a day of prayer
[9:26] and a day of Thanksgiving to God for all
[9:29] that they had went through and you know
[9:31] it' been Lincoln had taken office in
[9:35] 1861 in 1864 is when they he passed the
[9:39] law for a time and we've been in three
[9:42] years of heavy conflict in this
[9:47] country
[9:50] and
[9:51] uh there was a statement he made one
[9:54] time and it was it's always stuck stuck
[9:58] with me and
[9:59] Lincoln said in his speech one time he
[10:01] said when I come to the end of this just
[10:05] paraphrasing he said when I come to the
[10:06] end of this journey and I said I lay
[10:08] down the Reigns of power and he said if
[10:10] I've lost every other friend in this
[10:14] world he said I still have one friend
[10:18] and that friend's inside of
[10:20] me that's a
[10:23] testimony so thank the Lord for all of
[10:25] his blessings on
[10:27] us and just Wonderful Time of the Year
[10:31] and uh you know everybody tries to turn
[10:32] everything into commercial season and
[10:34] all that but it's really a time give
[10:37] thanks to God for all that that we have
[10:39] and what he's brought us through and I
[10:42] was
[10:43] uh I was thinking I had a prayer had a a
[10:47] praise a lady that I work with she's had
[10:50] a lot of issues and she finally had to
[10:53] have a knee replacement done we prayed
[10:55] and and she's uh had a lot of issues
[10:59] with it but uh after she got through the
[11:02] surgery uh two days two weeks and two
[11:05] days after she had her surgery she was
[11:07] up walking didn't have any pain she
[11:09] didn't have any issues and uh you know
[11:12] most of the time they want you to walk
[11:13] with a cane a lot longer than that and
[11:15] everything like that but she didn't have
[11:16] any trouble and the doctor said uh her
[11:19] surgeon was like I think I'm put you on
[11:20] a billboard cuz that was uh just uh
[11:23] amazing how well she's done and she's
[11:25] not had any trouble with it and uh just
[11:28] want to thank the Lord that uh you know
[11:30] God touches and if we just believe and
[11:33] bind bind with each other and just
[11:35] commit it to the Lord he takes care of
[11:37] all things use us use as doctors and all
[11:39] that to make everything well so thank
[11:42] the Lord for that and I know there's
[11:43] other ones and I was looking through my
[11:45] Bible and I put I putay prayer requests
[11:47] in my Bible things that people give me
[11:49] and I stick them in there and I got to
[11:51] look in it in my Bible and I found
[11:54] prayer requests that I know that the
[11:56] Lord's touched these people but I still
[11:58] have them in my Bible every time I I see
[12:00] their name in there I know what God's
[12:01] done for them and it's just like you
[12:04] know I just look at them think man you
[12:07] know sometimes you you
[12:09] wonder how where God's at or different
[12:12] things but you know you look in your
[12:13] Bible and you start looking back you
[12:14] start thinking about what God's done and
[12:16] man it's amazing where you come from and
[12:18] where you are today and I mean it's a
[12:21] it's a wonderful thing so just thank the
[12:23] Lord for this time of this time of the

[16:06] shall follow me all the days of my life
[16:09] and I will dwell in the house of the
[16:10] Lord forever amen God bless you tonight
[16:13] you be seated and we'll take a little
[16:15] thought
[16:16] tonight called a table
[16:20] prepared
[16:22] and I
[16:24] was looking at some things tonight and
[16:29] you know I appreciate what brother Boyd
[16:31] had to say about about the young people
[16:33] because
[16:35] um the uh the other week you know I was
[16:41] uh I was speaking about having having an
[16:43] appetite for a real true feeding on the
[16:46] word and having a real true appetite for
[16:48] the a spiritual diet you know brother
[16:51] Brown said that the problem was we if we
[16:55] have the wrong diet we end up with sin
[16:57] and the different problems that that the
[17:00] Christian goes through is because our
[17:01] diet's wrong just is a the natural
[17:04] typing the spiritual you know talking
[17:07] about the condition the the world's in
[17:09] today and all the all the food and you
[17:12] know they pump Everything full of
[17:14] chemicals and everything and you know
[17:16] man always thinks that he can make
[17:18] something better and and really he's not
[17:21] making anything better he just continue
[17:22] to make it worse and you know they're
[17:25] they're trying to use their intelligence
[17:26] to do anything and it's really just
[17:28] called and death and you know just
[17:30] continues to tear everything down and
[17:33] just kind of just kind of thinking in
[17:35] that same same line about eating and our
[17:39] our food and eating a spiritual diet and
[17:43] what God has given us and and you know I
[17:46] was speaking there the other week and
[17:48] was talking about you know getting ready
[17:50] to go to we was talking about getting
[17:52] ready to go to camp and you know
[17:53] preparing ourselves and you know God has
[17:55] something for you but you've got to be
[17:57] ready to receive receive it and you know
[18:00] um I wanted to say that we had a
[18:03] wonderful time at camp and I I really
[18:05] appreciate it and Lord willing if we get
[18:07] a chance we're going to go back and and
[18:09] help and it was it was really a blessing
[18:11] to me I know it was a blessing to the
[18:13] other ones and I'm I'm sure there's
[18:15] other that has testimonies but uh you
[18:18] know it was me and brother brother Boyd
[18:21] and brother Louis we got to spend some
[18:23] time together and it was it was really a
[18:26] real blessing to me and and I just been
[18:29] began to think about some of these
[18:31] things and you know the condition that
[18:34] that things are in
[18:37] and you know God has a has
[18:42] prepared a table you know he's prepared
[18:46] a meal we have something to eat and
[18:50] whatever we have need of God has it
[18:51] already for us amen and so all these
[18:54] things are ready and I just begin to
[18:58] look at some of these things and you
[19:00] know I I was trying to find something to
[19:02] to put all this in in words you know
[19:05] that you just you think about some of
[19:06] these things and this scripture come to
[19:08] me thou preparest the table before me in
[19:10] the presence of my enemies and and what
[19:13] what struck me about that was because I
[19:15] was thinking about these these young
[19:17] people as they as they approach this
[19:19] time and here they are and it's the same
[19:21] way with you and I as we come to church
[19:23] and and we have needs and we and we're
[19:24] looking for an answer from God but you
[19:26] know here he is he's bringing he's
[19:29] bringing forth something and it's the
[19:31] exact same thing is that he says he
[19:34] prepares a table before me in the
[19:36] presence of my enemies why because
[19:38] whatever you're looking for from God if
[19:40] you come in the house of God tonight and
[19:42] you begin to look for uh answer from God
[19:44] or you need something from God whatever
[19:46] you're looking for is what you're going
[19:48] to get whatever your expectation is
[19:50] tonight is what you're going to get and
[19:52] when people begin to expect something
[19:53] then guess what the devil's going to be
[19:55] there because he's here tonight to
[19:57] hinder you just like we was talking
[19:59] about to the young people you know how
[20:00] many times have we've seen young people
[20:02] come to go to a a youth camp and next
[20:04] thing you know you know they've had they
[20:06] get sick and they have go through all
[20:07] these different issues and you know a
[20:10] lot of them you know whatever it is that
[20:12] the devil begins to talk to them and you
[20:14] know he begins to create complexes and
[20:16] different things why because he's trying
[20:18] to hinder them but you know they know
[20:20] that God's going to do something for
[20:21] them and they have an
[20:23] expectation but the devil's going to be
[20:25] right there to hinder you and he said he
[20:28] prepares a table before me in the
[20:30] presence of my enemies so you know what
[20:33] because God's going to speak to you and
[20:34] he wants to deal with you and help you
[20:37] then that the devil's going to be there
[20:40] now there you know there's a couple of
[20:41] different ways that that people look at
[20:43] it when you when you study this out and
[20:45] you know the the whole chapter of of
[20:48] Psalms 23 we all we know that David's
[20:50] writing this as a perspective about the
[20:53] sheep and the shepherd and and you know
[20:55] one of the things that you look at when
[20:57] you talk about a table it also means
[21:00] like um a
[21:02] Mesa and you know in in Spanish Mesa
[21:05] means a table and you you know it's like
[21:07] the area that's that's green and the
[21:10] shepherd knows what's there when he
[21:12] brings his sheep into an area for them
[21:14] to feed in that area and he knows what's
[21:17] there and you know he makes sure that
[21:18] there's nothing there that's going to
[21:19] harm them because he wants to bring them
[21:21] into a place that's Lush and all you
[21:23] know all through the scripture here when
[21:25] we read you know he talks about it all
[21:28] out just like um the path and the
[21:31] journey of a of a sheep but you know
[21:34] there's a couple of other things that
[21:35] that people look at and one of them is
[21:37] when when he talks about bringing uh
[21:39] being prepared a table in the presence
[21:41] of of my enemies um in the in the time
[21:45] of the of the writing and even before
[21:47] that um you know they used to have the
[21:49] the feudal system in the in Europe and
[21:51] and different places where you know they
[21:53] had a Lord and he had all the own all
[21:55] the property and he had servants that
[21:57] worked for him and and they took care of
[21:58] everything and he got all the the money
[22:02] and and everything but you know he had a
[22:03] group of people that he would work for
[22:05] that would work for him that that took
[22:06] care of everything but you know they got
[22:09] everything that they had need of from
[22:10] their lord their Lord give them all
[22:13] their all the the things that they had
[22:15] need of and they worked for him and so
[22:18] their protection came from their lord
[22:21] and so from the from the feudal Lords
[22:23] you know he took care of everything and
[22:24] they worked for him and in this system
[22:27] um where you would he would have a a a
[22:29] large home he would have a banquet area
[22:31] and different things like that and when
[22:33] he said he would come and so these
[22:36] people would be invited into the Lord's
[22:38] House to eat at different times and so
[22:40] here's these peasants that were able to
[22:42] come and he says Thou preparest a table
[22:45] before me in the presence of my enemies
[22:47] well you know sometimes in those
[22:49] situations because you're going to feed
[22:51] in a place that that you could because
[22:54] in in other areas in the in the uh
[22:58] this feudal system you know you were not
[23:01] you were
[23:03] under no protection because you may been
[23:06] outside the walls or different places or
[23:09] you know you're out in the field there's
[23:10] no protection there but here you are
[23:12] able to come into the into the the
[23:14] Master's home and here he is where where
[23:17] it's all and then you could let off all
[23:18] the pressure you could come in and have
[23:21] this great feast and before you amen and
[23:24] here you are you know you you know you
[23:25] didn't have any protection or or very or
[23:28] whatever but here's a time where you
[23:30] could come in and enjoy all the great
[23:32] things that he has that he has laid out
[23:35] before you and so uh you know when you
[23:37] see this thing about you know in the
[23:39] presence of my enemies well you know
[23:41] they were people that still tried to uh
[23:44] you were still under the ability to be
[23:47] attacked or or whatever but you know
[23:49] they was still you were still in this
[23:50] place where he could protect you and uh
[23:54] one of the places that when you look at
[23:55] this is in in John chapter 12 here when
[23:59] when you look at the scripture and here
[24:01] you are and you think of having this
[24:04] having this Lord having to be able to be
[24:06] able to protect you and having this this
[24:08] place where uh even you had people that
[24:10] wanted that didn't like you that wanted
[24:12] to come against you but and the one
[24:14] place that comes up in the scripture
[24:16] that comes up is where Lazarus was with
[24:18] Jesus and here in John chap 12 it says
[24:21] then Jesus 6 days before the Passover
[24:23] came to Bethany where Lazarus was which
[24:26] had been dead whom he raised from the
[24:28] dead and he said and there they made him
[24:30] a supper and Martha served but Lazarus
[24:33] was one of them that sat at the table
[24:35] with him now scroll down I'm not going
[24:38] I'm not going to read all of this but
[24:41] get to verse if you scroll up to verse n
[24:44] it says but much people of the Jews
[24:47] therefore knew that he was there and
[24:49] they came not for jesus' sake only but
[24:51] that they might see Lazarus also whom he
[24:54] had raised from the dead but the chief
[24:56] priests consulted that they they might
[24:58] put Lazarus also to death because
[25:01] because that by reason of him many of
[25:03] the Jews went away and believed on Jesus
[25:07] so here they are here here is Lazarus
[25:09] his Lord and he has stepped into this
[25:11] home and he's eating and he's eating
[25:13] with Jesus but the Jews are the ones the
[25:16] high priests and all of them hated
[25:18] Lazarus because he was such a testimony
[25:20] to who Jesus was and had been raised
[25:23] from the dead and they they couldn't
[25:24] argue with what had taken place that
[25:26] they had seen Lazarus pass away because
[25:29] of the position that he had been
[25:31] ascribed they knew who he was and they
[25:33] knew that he'd come back to life and he
[25:35] sat in the midst and all these Jews
[25:36] began to believe on Jesus because of
[25:39] what he had taken place and here they
[25:40] are and you know here they are making
[25:43] this PL plot trying to get to Lazarus
[25:47] and you know so here he is having a
[25:49] prepared a table before me in the
[25:52] presence of my enemies being able to eat
[25:54] in the presence of God in the presence
[25:57] of all these and showing what had taken
[25:59] place in his life and you know here they
[26:02] are they're arguing you know they're
[26:04] plotting against him trying to get to
[26:05] him but they they couldn't argue with
[26:07] what had taken place and so here he is
[26:10] argue you know preparing a place in the
[26:14] presence of my enemies now the other
[26:16] place that we see in the scripture when
[26:18] it talks about this is um you know many
[26:22] times they would they would prepare a a
[26:24] a a meal and in the midst of a
[26:28] Battlefield and if you if you really
[26:30] want to want to show off to the enemy is
[26:34] just go out there and set up a a feast
[26:36] or a table and across from a battlefield
[26:40] and you're looking out across your enemy
[26:42] and your enemy can see you and there you
[26:44] are and you're looking at them and they
[26:46] can look at you and you spread this this
[26:49] Feast out and you're sitting down and
[26:51] you're
[26:52] eating well you know that shows them
[26:54] that you don't have any fear of them why
[26:57] because I I I've Got Confidence in what
[27:00] I've got on with me that we have the we
[27:03] we are strong enough that we're going to
[27:05] sit down and we're going to rest and
[27:06] we're going to enjoy these things and
[27:09] you're not going to do anything to
[27:11] us and so here they are they're sitting
[27:14] down in the presence of their enemies
[27:16] eating and just daring them to come
[27:20] on well come on if and and if you're
[27:22] going to if you if you think you're
[27:23] strong enough if you think you're
[27:25] powerful enough then come on but I'm
[27:27] going to enjoy what I have in the midst
[27:31] in the presence of the enemy right and
[27:34] I'm just going to sit down here I am
[27:35] rejoicing in this and relaxing and and
[27:37] so here they are they're eating and
[27:39] enjoying themselves and and daring the
[27:42] the enemy to come
[27:44] forth and it's the same way with you and
[27:46] I if we come to the house of God yeah
[27:49] whatever the devil brings against us and
[27:50] tries to stop us yet we're going to
[27:52] still Feast on the word of God we're
[27:53] still going to Feast on the good things
[27:55] of God we're not going to hold back just
[27:58] feed on what God has for you that's
[28:00] right and you
[28:02] know here in in the second this is 1
[28:06] Samuel chapter
[28:09] 14 and you when you when you begin to
[28:11] eat on the on the things of God and and
[28:13] feed
[28:15] and and so we know this is uh Saul come
[28:19] against the Philistines and and uh
[28:22] Jonathan is with his son with him and we
[28:25] know that they be they had
[28:29] uh Jonathan and his armor Bearer you
[28:31] know that they had went out to fight
[28:33] against the Philistines because you know
[28:35] he he asked his armor Bearer you know if
[28:38] he was ready to if he would go with him
[28:40] up there and he said yes and he said
[28:41] well you know if they if they call for
[28:43] us to come down you know we're not going
[28:45] or you know they wait for them to come
[28:47] down or go up to them and you know he
[28:49] said you know when when they went in he
[28:51] said we knew that that God had given the
[28:53] end the Philistines into Jonathan's hand
[28:56] you know he went up there and he slew
[28:58] them and he slew the like 20 of them and
[29:01] they got so so afraid of what had taken
[29:04] place that they began to fight each
[29:05] other and then they began to run away
[29:08] from them and you know then Saul was out
[29:11] there trying to figure out what was
[29:12] going to what he was going to do to
[29:14] fight and realizing not realizing that
[29:17] Jonathan had taken this initiative this
[29:19] step in front of the
[29:21] enemy that that he would that he fought
[29:23] him just by himself just the two of them
[29:25] had went up there and it didn't take the
[29:27] 600 it only took two of them that
[29:29] actually had faith in God to defeat the
[29:32] enemy and put the enemy to running and
[29:35] so here in in 1 Samuel when when he
[29:37] began to began to speak of these things
[29:39] and it it says likewise all the men of
[29:42] Israel which had hid themselves in Mount
[29:44] Ephraim when they heard that the
[29:46] Philistines fled even they also followed
[29:49] hard after them in the battle didn't
[29:52] seem like they were really uh wanting to
[29:54] fight kind of uh a a little bit scared
[29:58] of what was going to take place but so
[30:00] the Lord saved Israel that day and the
[30:01] battle passed over unto Beth Haven and
[30:05] the men of Israel were distressed that
[30:06] day for Saul had a Jour of people saying
[30:09] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[30:11] unto evening that I may avenge mine on
[30:14] mine enemies so none of the people
[30:17] tasted any food and they all came all
[30:21] they of the land came to a wood and
[30:23] there was honey upon the ground and when
[30:25] the people were come into the wood
[30:28] behold the honey dropped but no man put
[30:30] his hand to his mouth for the man for
[30:33] the people feared the oath but Jonathan
[30:35] heard not his father charged the people
[30:37] with the when he when his father charged
[30:39] the people with the oath therefore he
[30:41] put the put forth the end of his Rod
[30:44] that was in his hand and dipped it into
[30:46] the honeycomb and put it his hand to his
[30:49] mouth and his eyes were enlightened then
[30:52] answered one of the people saying thy
[30:54] father straightly charged the people
[30:55] with an oath saying cursed be the man
[30:57] that eateth any food this day and the
[30:59] people were faint then said Jonathan my
[31:02] father hath troubled the land sea I pray
[31:05] you how mine eyes have been enlightened
[31:08] because I tasted a little of this honey
[31:10] how much more if happily the people had
[31:12] eaten freely today of the spoil of their
[31:15] enemies which they had found for had
[31:18] they for had there not been now much a
[31:23] much greater Slaughter among the
[31:25] Philistines so when he began to speak
[31:28] that that he he didn't know know what
[31:30] the the oath or the word the order that
[31:34] Saul had given the people but when
[31:36] Jonathan went out there and they had
[31:37] fought and they had gotten tired and
[31:39] weary and then he went and just seen the
[31:41] honey that was laying before them then
[31:43] he when he ate the honey then it's he
[31:45] became enlightened or he became renewed
[31:47] he became energized because what had
[31:49] taken place because of the battle and
[31:51] here they are they're becoming weary in
[31:53] front of the enemy and and Jonathan says
[31:56] well look what happened his dad making
[31:59] making another mistake as as as Saul was
[32:03] not to do because you know every time he
[32:05] was all the time trying to instead of uh
[32:07] going before the Lord and asking the
[32:09] Lord what should what I should I do or
[32:11] how should I handle everything he just
[32:13] he just raises up in himself and he does
[32:15] it however he wants to and you know we
[32:18] know different times when he when he
[32:20] didn't didn't Slaughter the Kings and
[32:22] and they brought back the gifts and all
[32:23] that when they were supposed to utterly
[32:25] destroy everything and Saul had you know
[32:27] Samuel rose up and had to rebuke him for
[32:29] what he had done well it was the same
[32:31] way he was always wanted to do it the
[32:32] way he wanted to do it but here's here's
[32:35] Jonathan when he's standing there in the
[32:36] midst of these people he said you know
[32:38] if everybody had just
[32:40] eaten but he made this rule but he but
[32:43] everybody's so tired now and everybody's
[32:44] so faint because they've not eaten all
[32:47] day and here they are but all he wants
[32:49] to do is pursue the enemy but the thing
[32:51] is is we need to eat we need to we need
[32:54] to regain our strength or our and and
[32:56] everything so here's what we need to do
[32:58] we need to eat and here Jonathan says
[33:00] see my father's done this and he's
[33:01] troubled the people because he's not
[33:03] allowed them to eat and they should have
[33:05] ate and he said if they would have just
[33:07] eaten if they' had just been able to eat
[33:10] then he's a a greater Slaughter would
[33:12] had a greater Victory today if we just
[33:15] ate but we didn't eat because we're
[33:17] following just somebody's idea but it
[33:21] wasn't based on what God said it wasn't
[33:24] based on what God had told to people
[33:26] amen and here they are there and so he
[33:28] say he is troubled and it's the same way
[33:30] today you know how much more of a
[33:32] greater Victory can we have if we feed
[33:34] on the word of God if we continue to
[33:36] feed on the word of God and just
[33:37] continue to just eat and eat and eat and
[33:40] hold up know it's like well I don't have
[33:42] strength no don't don't say those things
[33:45] but whatever God says and that's what
[33:46] you repeat and you find it in the word
[33:48] of God and you begin to Feast on that
[33:49] and you begin to think on those things
[33:51] you begin to dwell on those things and
[33:53] what happens then it becomes into your
[33:54] into your psyche it becomes part of you
[33:57] and then when you begin to speak it then
[33:58] you realize and you have faith because
[34:00] it becomes a revelation to you then you
[34:03] really see these things amen and it
[34:06] becomes a you know a testimony to you
[34:13] amen but he
[34:17] says and so as he began
[34:23] to uh pass the press the battle
[34:27] and he talks about
[34:29] it
[34:31] um he says and the people flew upon the
[34:34] spool after they smoked the Philistines
[34:37] and dropping down to 32 says and the
[34:38] people flew upon the spool and took
[34:40] sheep and oxen and calves and slew them
[34:42] on the ground and the people did eat
[34:44] them with the blood then they told Saul
[34:47] saying behold the people sin against the
[34:49] Lord and that they eat with the blood
[34:51] and he said ye have transgressed roll a
[34:53] great Stone upon me this day and then
[34:57] dropping down to 42 so we see that the
[35:01] people he he put the people in this
[35:04] condition where they were able to eat
[35:05] but then all of a sudden when when
[35:07] Jonathan eats and he says you know if
[35:09] you eat of this you can become your eyes
[35:11] will be open you'll be renewed well then
[35:13] all of a sudden the people just turn
[35:14] around and just start killing the
[35:16] animals the slaughter to eat to get
[35:19] something to eat because you just got to
[35:21] a certain point where you're just so
[35:22] weak and he says what you know you've
[35:24] sinned against the Lord
[35:27] you know he's he's bringing Saul's
[35:28] bringing this accusation to the people
[35:30] and telling them what what's taking
[35:32] place but you know when later on when we
[35:35] see here in the scripture when when Saul
[35:37] is looking to find out why he said he
[35:39] went before and brought a priest in and
[35:41] he brought the Ark of the Covenant
[35:42] before him to get a answer from the Lord
[35:45] about going forth with the fighting the
[35:48] Philistines and he didn't get an answer
[35:49] and and we we know that when those
[35:52] things happen then he was like well
[35:53] there's something going on here that I
[35:54] don't know what's what the problem is
[35:56] and you know he they cast lots between
[35:59] the people and Jonathan and and Saul and
[36:01] they they find out that the lot falls on
[36:04] uh Jonathan that something's happened
[36:05] and he asked him he says and Saul said
[36:08] cast lots upon me and Jonathan my son
[36:10] and Jonathan was taken then Saul said to
[36:12] Jonathan tell me what thou Hast done and
[36:14] Jonathan told him said I did but taste a
[36:17] little honey with the end of my rod that
[36:20] was in my hand and lo I must die because
[36:23] that was the that was the statement that
[36:25] was made to uh by Saul to the people
[36:28] that you know whoever eats is was going
[36:30] to face
[36:31] death and and and Saul answered God do
[36:35] so and more more also for Thou shalt
[36:38] surely die Jonathan and the people said
[36:40] unto Saul shall Jonathan die who hath
[36:43] wrought this great salvation in Israel
[36:46] God forbid as the Lord liveth there
[36:48] shall not one hair of his head fall to
[36:50] the ground for he hath wrought with God
[36:53] this day so the people rescued Jonathan
[36:55] that he died not then Saul went up from
[36:58] following the Philistines and the
[37:00] Philistines went to their own place so
[37:03] it's interesting that when all this took
[37:05] place nothing nothing was going the way
[37:07] that Saul wanted it to go but when when
[37:10] he when all this fell and then he was
[37:11] like well you're going to die because
[37:13] this is my this is my law this is what I
[37:16] made and and the people tell Saul listen
[37:21] Jonathan was the one that had the had
[37:23] the following of God and wrote this
[37:26] great Victory and now you're wanting to
[37:28] kill him because he didn't follow your
[37:30] rule but it didn't but you're everything
[37:33] that you've said so far has been has
[37:35] been totally wrong and hasn't helped
[37:37] anybody hasn't hasn't blessed anybody
[37:39] but here Jonathan taking the initiative
[37:41] to follow the lord and and raising up in
[37:44] faith and went forth and ate and they
[37:46] had this great
[37:47] Victory and so here it is it turns it
[37:50] turned Saul away where Saul just walked
[37:53] you know left because you know he was he
[37:55] was so so brought down by what had taken
[37:59] place and it's the same way you know
[38:01] many times people they get into this
[38:03] place where they they want to try to uh
[38:05] carry things and and do things but it
[38:08] takes God God's the one that's got to be
[38:11] in charge it's God that that we have to
[38:14] follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[38:16] and ask him and pray and and seek God's
[38:19] face not try to figure things out on
[38:20] their own because many times people try
[38:22] to figure the more they try to figure
[38:23] things out on their own the more they
[38:25] get them wrong that's right and it
[38:27] becomes just a a greater problem but you
[38:29] know if if we know that that you know
[38:31] the first thing you got to do many times
[38:33] when uh issues and problems arise you
[38:36] know when you get lost in the woods and
[38:39] different things like that you the first
[38:40] thing they tell you you know first thing
[38:41] you do is sit
[38:43] down you know don't don't just be up and
[38:45] running all the time and trying to
[38:47] figure things out you need to sit down
[38:49] and calm yourself and figure out where
[38:51] you're at and you know and and people
[38:54] you know they you know brother Brown
[38:55] talks about that in the message the GU
[38:57] you know he he was such a Woodsman and
[39:00] had all these skills and was able to do
[39:02] all these things and he thought he had
[39:03] had had the ability that that he
[39:05] wouldn't get lost and he could do all
[39:06] these things but you know even
[39:08] experienced people that have that's had
[39:10] great experience in and being in the
[39:12] woods and doing different things you
[39:14] know they still have to follow the same
[39:16] rules they still got to come back and
[39:18] follow the same rules and you know that
[39:19] people say you know if you get lost in
[39:21] the woods the first thing you need to do
[39:22] is then you need to sit down and and
[39:24] build a fire and and build shelter and
[39:27] and you just stay where you're at and
[39:28] try to figure out where you're at
[39:30] because the more you run in the woods
[39:32] and you know people get into that Indian
[39:33] death barch where they just trying to
[39:35] run themselves to to death and they they
[39:37] can't figure anything out and you know
[39:40] they get to the place where they they
[39:41] think that they're they're hopeless but
[39:43] the first thing you need to do is just
[39:44] sit down and just think about where
[39:47] you're at and and look at what you need
[39:48] to do why because if you stay put
[39:51] somebody can find
[39:53] you you know the scripture says be still
[39:55] and know that I am God then if we just
[39:58] stay where we're at and just wait on the
[40:01] Lord then then we can then we don't get
[40:03] into these situations where we run
[40:05] ourselves ragged come
[40:07] on because you know sometimes the devil
[40:10] want you know the devil wants us to be
[40:12] up and going and and trying to tell us
[40:14] oh you need to do this or that or you
[40:16] know trying to stir things up and we we
[40:18] get so worked up and it's like no I'm
[40:20] not listening to
[40:22] that I'm listening to the Lord so I'm
[40:24] going to sit down and listen amen
[40:26] as many times as brother Dale always
[40:28] said you know be at a place you know at
[40:29] a place waiting you know you get to this
[40:32] place where you know you've got to this
[40:33] one place where I'm GNA stay right here
[40:36] until the Lord
[40:37] speaks you know I I think and I I've
[40:41] said this before but I I love this you
[40:43] know where Elijah was there and and he
[40:45] got down by the Brook cheriff you know
[40:47] and he told him he said it's not going
[40:49] to rain he said do won't fall nothing's
[40:51] going to take place until I call for it
[40:54] he said he said until I call for it
[40:56] right and then he said then at that same
[40:58] time that he goes by and the spirit of
[41:00] the Lord brings him to the brook cherith
[41:02] and he's sitting there and he's drinking
[41:04] by this Brook now the rest of the now
[41:06] the rest of Israel and Judea and
[41:08] everything they're going through a
[41:09] famine there's no rain there there's no
[41:12] do there's no nothing and everybody's in
[41:14] a panic because everything is drying up
[41:17] there's no food there's everything's
[41:18] dying then and they just see how
[41:20] hopeless it is and and everything but
[41:22] you know what the prophet is sitting
[41:24] beside a brook in the midst of no you
[41:27] know just out in his own little place
[41:29] that God has put him in and he's there
[41:31] and he's drinking this water and the
[41:33] Ravens begin to feed him food and they
[41:35] begin to feed him in the morning and in
[41:37] the evening and he's sitting there by
[41:39] the Brook amen and he's been he's in
[41:42] this place and people what why are you
[41:44] not doing why because this is where God
[41:46] wants you to be so you come into this
[41:48] place where you know and sometimes you
[41:51] know you wonder why things don't don't
[41:53] seem like the Lord's moving or or you
[41:55] don't have an answer well God God want
[41:56] you to just stay right there that's
[41:58] right i' I've said many times you know
[42:01] people want to know what's going on so
[42:02] well maybe this is your Brook cheriff
[42:04] this where God wants you to stay
[42:06] put because you know what if you stand
[42:09] there and you just pray and seek God
[42:10] when it gets time for you to move God
[42:12] will give you the answer he'll give you
[42:14] the he'll speak to you right because you
[42:18] know he sat beside that Brook the
[42:20] prophet sat beside that Brook until the
[42:22] brook dried up and you know the whole
[42:24] time that he was down there and he was
[42:26] being supernaturally fed by God there
[42:29] was a little widow woman somewhere who
[42:31] was down to her last meal down to down
[42:34] to her you know trying to hang on with
[42:37] her and her son and everything else was
[42:39] going by the wayside and seeing every
[42:41] all the Death and All the destruction
[42:43] and everything around her and yet she's
[42:45] waiting on just trying to hold on to
[42:47] that last little bit of meal that she
[42:49] had but you know there was a prophet
[42:51] that already God had already put a
[42:53] prophet to come by her way to give her
[42:55] what she had need of she didn't see that
[42:59] but the prophet Propet was there he
[43:02] already knew what her problem was he
[43:04] knew what her need was and it was all
[43:06] the answer was already there but you
[43:08] know what when that when the brook dried
[43:10] up then the prophet came to her and she
[43:12] was down there and she's just she's
[43:14] almost hopeless and and you know just
[43:17] down to her you know her last little bit
[43:19] of Sanity there and taking those two
[43:22] little
[43:22] sticks and she's ready to die she's
[43:25] ready to give up and here she is and in
[43:28] this last little minute but you know he
[43:30] says can you give me some
[43:33] water you know that's a that's a high
[43:35] dollar commodity at that time in the
[43:38] world but you know what she didn't mind
[43:40] giving him some
[43:42] water and then he says give me a little
[43:44] cake can you bake me a little
[43:48] cake well you know what she didn't mind
[43:50] giving giving the water but you know cuz
[43:52] that was very it was very scarce but she
[43:55] shared what she had but then all of a
[43:57] sudden you want what else I've
[43:59] got I've given you water now the other
[44:01] thing that I have very little of is this
[44:03] little bit of meal and you want it
[44:06] too and she's like listen I don't have I
[44:08] don't have anything I just got this
[44:10] little bit of to make a cake for me and
[44:12] my son that we're getting ready to
[44:15] die but he says listen I want you to
[44:18] understand if you make me one just make
[44:20] me a little one
[44:22] first he said I've got a blessing for
[44:24] you I want you to to know one thing that
[44:27] that's never your meal's never going to
[44:28] run out the oil's never going to run out
[44:31] but you just got to trust me to take
[44:33] this one little bit if you'll just take
[44:35] this one little bit then you'll can go
[44:39] this whole time this whole famine you'll
[44:41] be able and so you know she took him at
[44:43] his word and she made that little cake
[44:45] and you know what then she was blessed
[44:46] by that you know she never had when
[44:48] everybody else was in this is in this
[44:50] panic mode and everything else is dried
[44:52] up and everybody's starving to death but
[44:55] you know what she she always had what
[44:56] she had need of that's right she always
[44:59] had enough it always was enough it
[45:01] always lasted for whatever she had need
[45:03] of just by giving that little bit just
[45:06] by
[45:07] listening and you know it's the same way
[45:09] you and I you know God knows where
[45:11] you're at God knows what you have need
[45:13] of but you know we just sit down and
[45:14] wait on God things get bad things get
[45:17] worse whatever you know don't worry
[45:19] about it if your if your children are
[45:21] are are Wayward or whatever it may be
[45:24] you know what don't you worry about it
[45:26] just put faith in God because God is the
[45:28] one that give the word and then you just
[45:30] sit down and begin to Feast on the
[45:32] things of God whatever God said that's
[45:34] that's the truth
[45:36] amen whatever whatever God has said that
[45:39] that's the truth not not what what I
[45:41] think or what the you know what what I
[45:42] try to figure out that doesn't matter
[45:44] what God Said what he has said he what
[45:47] he's promised that's what is
[45:54] truth
[45:57] see we just trust in God
[45:59] whatever God has for us put our faith in
[46:04] God that's true and so here when um this
[46:10] is a second in second Samuel chapter n
[46:13] and you know when we see things that God
[46:16] has done for us and you know having
[46:19] having this table prepared for us
[46:22] there's a table that's prepared God has
[46:24] blessed us with these things
[46:26] and you know when we don't we don't see
[46:29] the things that God has for us but
[46:31] they're there and it comes in God's
[46:35] time and here and this this is the other
[46:37] one that that kind of you know it stays
[46:41] with me sometimes and you know D here's
[46:43] David and when when he's beginning to
[46:46] speak and you know you start to wonder
[46:48] about some of these things has went
[46:50] through and it says and David said is
[46:52] there yet any that is left of the House
[46:55] of Saul that I'm may show kindness for
[46:57] Jonathan's
[47:00] sake you know you think about sometimes
[47:03] when when here's David when he's looking
[47:05] back no doubt looking back over his life
[47:07] the things that's that's happened and
[47:09] what God has done for him and he begins
[47:12] to look back and he begin to think of
[47:13] these things and you know thinking about
[47:16] when David was was a was a fugitive and
[47:19] and all these things but he had somebody
[47:20] that loved him more than more than just
[47:23] about liked itself Jonathan loved him
[47:26] you know as as him own as his own self
[47:29] and you know what Jonathan done and the
[47:31] the love that they had for each other
[47:33] and and you know no doubt Jon Jonathan
[47:36] and David were closer than no doubt than
[47:37] David's own brothers were that he was
[47:40] closer to his own brothers that that
[47:42] Jonathan and him had this relationship
[47:44] and began to look back over his life and
[47:46] all the things that that had taken place
[47:48] and no no doubt what a wonderful
[47:50] relationship they had and he began to
[47:52] think about what what Jonathan had done
[47:54] for him and you know when Saul began to
[47:57] chase David and wanted to kill him but
[47:59] you know there was somebody that was
[48:01] always his ally was on his side that was
[48:03] his his friend Jonathan who always
[48:05] wanted to take care of him make sure
[48:06] that everything was okay with him and
[48:09] you know and after after d Saul's family
[48:12] and all was was killed and you know
[48:14] Jonathan had been killed and all of that
[48:17] you know been looking back over all the
[48:19] things that that Jonathan had done and
[48:21] the relationship they had and all these
[48:23] things you know here's David looking
[48:25] back and he says is there anybody
[48:28] left that I can bless because of
[48:30] Jonathan because what Jonathan done for
[48:32] me he said is there anybody else that I
[48:34] can bless can I bless
[48:37] somebody God's blessed me and he says he
[48:41] begins so he begins to search and he
[48:43] says and there was a there was of the
[48:46] House of Saul a servant whose name was
[48:48] Zeba and when they had called him unto
[48:51] the David the king said unto him art
[48:54] thou Zeba and he said
[48:56] he said thy servant is he and the King
[48:59] said is there not yet any of the House
[49:01] of Saul that I may show kindness of God
[49:03] unto him and Zeba said unto the king
[49:05] Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on
[49:08] his feet and the King said unto him
[49:10] where is he and Zeba said unto the king
[49:12] behold he is in the house of mitar the
[49:14] son of Amel of lobar then King David
[49:18] sent and fetched him out of the house of
[49:19] mikar the son of Amel from
[49:22] lbar and when fth the son of Jonathan
[49:25] the son of Saul was come unto David he
[49:28] fell on his face and did reverence and
[49:31] David said M fth and he answered Behold
[49:35] thy servant and David said unto him fear
[49:37] not for I will surely show thee kindness
[49:40] for Jonathan thy father's sake and will
[49:42] restore to thee all the land of Saul thy
[49:46] father and thou shalt eat bread at my
[49:49] table continually and he bowed himself
[49:51] and said why is thy servant that thou
[49:53] should us look upon this son such a dead
[49:56] dog as I am then the king said then the
[49:59] king called is Zeus Saul's servant and
[50:01] said unto him I have given unto thy
[50:04] Master son all that pertain to salt and
[50:06] to all to all his house thou therefore
[50:10] and the sons and thy servants shal till
[50:13] the land for him and thou shalt bring
[50:15] shalt bring in the fruits that thy
[50:18] Master son may eat the food have food to
[50:20] eat but MTH thy Father's son shall eat
[50:25] all away at my table and now Zeba had 15
[50:29] sons and 20 servants then said Zeba unto
[50:31] the king according to all that my Lord
[50:33] the king hath commanded his servant so
[50:36] shall thy servant do as for Miche said
[50:40] the king he shall eat at my table as one
[50:43] of the king's sons and mbth had a young
[50:46] son whose name was mikah and all that
[50:48] dwelt in the house of Zeba were servants
[50:51] unto mbth so mbth dwelt in Jerusalem for
[50:55] he did itat continually at the king's
[50:57] table and was lame on both his
[51:00] feet and so here we we see this this in
[51:04] this story where you know where John
[51:06] when David begins to look back of all
[51:07] these things and he began to look and
[51:09] see what what he had what had taken
[51:12] place in his life and he began to look
[51:13] for somebody to bless and he said is
[51:15] there anybody left uh from Saul's
[51:18] household and and from Jonathan's family
[51:22] and everything and he finds mbth there
[51:24] and and you know here's ath and you know
[51:26] no no doubt he was in a in a place when
[51:29] you when you look and and all your
[51:30] family is gone and and you know you're
[51:32] kind of an outcast and and you know
[51:34] because all the family's gone and and
[51:36] everything that you had is gone and
[51:38] everything and here you are in this in
[51:40] this lowly place and and you're
[51:43] lame and you know all these things have
[51:45] happened to you and you and you begin to
[51:47] look at all these things like well is is
[51:49] there any is there anything good coming
[51:50] of all
[51:52] this and then all of a sudden when you
[51:54] when you realize that your grandfather
[51:56] has been chasing the king all those
[51:58] years and trying to kill him and and was
[52:00] against him this whole time and now the
[52:02] king wants to see
[52:05] you then all of a sudden you know what
[52:07] then mfib he don't want to see David
[52:10] because you know what he so he's so
[52:12] afraid of what's going to take place
[52:14] because he can't see anything good out
[52:15] of
[52:16] it and he craws and he crawls out there
[52:19] and he says why why is your my Lord
[52:21] called me he said as a as a dead dog as
[52:24] I am why why are you calling to see
[52:28] me why because he sees the condition
[52:31] that he's in and nothing nothing has
[52:32] been right everything's but here's but
[52:34] here's David saying listen he said but
[52:36] your father Jonathan has been my friend
[52:40] has been like a brother to me he has
[52:42] blessed me and he said see now the
[52:44] blessings of the father are going to
[52:46] rest on the son he said now I'm blessing
[52:48] you because I have this opportunity to
[52:50] pay back what has been given to me and
[52:53] he said now I'm going to restore what
[52:54] was Souls is going to be yours and here
[52:57] and I want you because I can't I can't
[52:59] do anything for your father he's gone
[53:02] but I can do something for you I want
[53:03] you to come sit at my table I want you
[53:06] to eat of my bread he said you will
[53:07] always be at my table he said you will
[53:10] always have a place and when you begin
[53:12] to look at all the things that had been
[53:14] negative and all the problems that that
[53:15] he had faced in MTH had faed in his life
[53:18] and then all of a sudden the King has
[53:19] come to him and said listen I've got a
[53:21] place here in the palace for you and
[53:23] then and not only here but there's
[53:25] people that's going to be working for
[53:27] you that's going to be bringing these
[53:28] these gifts to you all the fruits of of
[53:30] their labors you're going to be able to
[53:31] eat of these things and I want you to
[53:33] come and and enjoy all of these things
[53:37] and know you know when he said how is
[53:38] all this why because there's been a
[53:40] blessing that's been applied to you and
[53:43] brothers and sisters it's the same way
[53:44] with you and I like why why did God come
[53:47] looking for us why because God had a
[53:49] blessing because you were one of his why
[53:53] because we were one of his when we were
[53:54] lost in sin and cut off and alienated
[53:57] from the life of God and from The
[53:59] Fellowship Of God then he came looking
[54:01] for us he always knew where we were and
[54:03] he always had a blessing for us but we
[54:05] couldn't see that we were cut off and
[54:08] even when we look at all these things
[54:10] how how can God come to me I don't I'm
[54:13] Unworthy of all these
[54:16] things but you know what he's the one
[54:18] that that made the
[54:21] promise he's the one that paid the price
[54:24] amen
[54:28] how many times we look at all the faults
[54:29] and failures in our lives we see all the
[54:32] things that have went wrong in our lives
[54:34] we see all the problems and and all
[54:36] these things and just like michef
[54:37] sitting there and all he can see is all
[54:39] the death and destruction all he can see
[54:41] is the lameness of his feet but you know
[54:43] what David didn't see that David didn't
[54:47] see all of the problems that he had all
[54:50] he saw was that he was the son all he
[54:53] could see was who he was by the
[54:56] bloodline and say I'm tell you and it's
[54:58] it's wonderful to know that in the back
[54:59] of God's mind no matter where you go and
[55:02] all the problems that you have in this
[55:03] world and all the places you want but
[55:05] you know what we were in the back part
[55:06] of God's mind we were one of his and no
[55:08] matter when we come to this earth and no
[55:10] matter how far away you get from God God
[55:12] knows where you are and if you're one of
[55:13] his he's coming to get you and he's
[55:15] going to bring you back into Fellowship
[55:17] because he has something to give you and
[55:20] you know so you know it's such a
[55:22] wonderful thing to see what God has done
[55:24] for us and we got a place to come and
[55:26] eat at the at his
[55:28] table you it was just it's nothing but
[55:31] God's grace to us we didn't Merit any of
[55:34] this we didn't we didn't have a we
[55:36] didn't have a a a right to any of
[55:39] this but it was by God's grace he called
[55:42] us to this that's
[55:45] righten and all God's blessings and he
[55:47] wants to bestow His blessings upon
[55:50] you but many times we get to the place
[55:53] just like M the shf where we wonder why
[55:55] are we in this condition why why why has
[55:57] these things happened to us but it's God
[55:59] speaking to
[56:01] us you're not ever going to be good
[56:04] enough for God's love you're not ever
[56:06] going to be good enough for God's
[56:08] grace because if you ever get to the
[56:10] place where you Merit it that it's not
[56:12] God's grace that's
[56:16] right and many times you know the the
[56:18] devil wants to try to to hold you back
[56:20] from from where God wants you to be and
[56:22] and you know it's like well uh you know
[56:24] we we we fail and and we have we have
[56:27] issues and all these things but you know
[56:29] what God's grace is greater than all
[56:31] that why because there's still the blood
[56:33] that you can put all your sins under
[56:35] that you can wash all that away that you
[56:37] know that you can come back in perfect
[56:39] and perfect uh fellowship with
[56:42] him but if you would but if you would
[56:44] just go that
[56:47] way if we just follow that that God has
[56:50] these great things for us that he's
[56:53] called us to these things
[56:55] and he wants you
[56:57] to to reach out and take these
[57:00] things he's speaking to
[57:02] us and it's so wonderful to realize what
[57:05] God has given us that we don't Merit
[57:09] it you know because
[57:13] if you know when when you when you think
[57:16] of these things and when God has giving
[57:19] you things and God has spoke to you then
[57:22] you know when when you want to give
[57:24] somebody something
[57:26] something you know when when you have
[57:29] something that that you want that you
[57:31] want to lay on somebody you want to
[57:32] bless
[57:35] somebody you know it it's one of the
[57:37] hardest things is trying to get somebody
[57:39] to believe you and and and it's even
[57:41] worse when you want to bless somebody
[57:42] you want to give somebody something
[57:44] especially when you see somebody in need
[57:46] and you know what they don't want to
[57:47] receive
[57:48] it and it's not and it's not that they
[57:51] don't want to receive it it's that it's
[57:53] that they don't they don't think they
[57:54] worthy enough to receive
[57:57] it well I don't you don't have to be if
[58:00] if I love you and I want to give you
[58:02] something then you don't have to be
[58:03] worthy enough to get
[58:06] it that's it when when you when you have
[58:09] your children even the you know no
[58:11] matter what they do and how they go and
[58:14] and how they whatever whatever is they
[58:16] do they're still your children right and
[58:19] you know what you correct your children
[58:21] and and but you know what you still want
[58:22] you still want the best for them you
[58:25] still want to give them the best you
[58:26] still want them to have the
[58:28] best why because you want to see them
[58:31] succeed in everything that they
[58:33] do but whatever it takes but you know
[58:35] what you've got to make them understand
[58:37] listen this is yours and you need to
[58:39] take
[58:40] it when didn't say you can't you can't
[58:43] run from this you what because you know
[58:45] I'm gonna follow you that's right
[58:48] amen why because my children are my
[58:51] children God give them to
[58:53] me well you know what the thing is as as
[58:56] long as they long as they're drawing
[58:58] breath then you know what then I'm going
[58:59] to be right there behind them I'm going
[59:01] to be right there in front of them I'm
[59:02] going be I'm going to be leading them
[59:04] and I'm going to be trying to tell them
[59:05] the right way to
[59:07] go they've got they've got to go that
[59:09] way they got to make their own choices
[59:12] but you know you got to show them the
[59:14] right way to
[59:15] go and just keep and just keep holding
[59:17] them up and before the Lord but just
[59:20] keep showing them the
[59:22] way you know they've got to make their
[59:24] they got to make their own choices but
[59:26] you got to teach them the right way to
[59:32] go and I hear this is from the message
[59:36] God's provided way and brother R
[59:39] speaking and he says now in the in the
[59:42] orience he said there was a a wedding
[59:44] there was to be a wedding take place he
[59:46] said what taking place the king said the
[59:48] time for his son's wedding and then it
[59:50] was the son's duty to give out the
[59:52] invitations and no one could come to
[59:55] that supper without an
[59:57] invitation he said I don't believe that
[59:59] there has ever been a man or woman that
[1:00:02] ever walked into a church or come into
[1:00:04] the presence of God without there being
[1:00:07] that they were given an invitation to
[1:00:09] this supper now you can take it or you
[1:00:12] can turn it down that's up to you he
[1:00:15] said some people go goes to church year
[1:00:17] after year and day after day Revival
[1:00:20] after Revival and still will not accept
[1:00:22] that invitation they don't mean to turn
[1:00:25] it down but they just neglect doing
[1:00:29] it and he says did you
[1:00:32] notice he said one had something to do
[1:00:36] he bought a piece of ground now there
[1:00:38] here he's speaking of Jesus giv
[1:00:43] the the parable of the supper and he's
[1:00:47] you know so each one of he when he sent
[1:00:48] out the the invitations for them to come
[1:00:51] to this supper that they had this great
[1:00:53] feast was set on for them to come come
[1:00:54] to but here they are and they said well
[1:00:56] I've I've got something to do he said I
[1:00:58] bought a piece of ground the other one
[1:00:59] had bought some ox he must go try them
[1:01:02] not like you wouldn't try the ox before
[1:01:04] you bought them you see it's just it's
[1:01:06] just an excuse and he said I know that
[1:01:09] all you ministers and so forth and
[1:01:11] businessmen and track works and so forth
[1:01:13] you know you find all those things
[1:01:15] people's got
[1:01:16] excuses I've just got to stay home
[1:01:18] tonight I can't attend the Revival just
[1:01:21] remember God said they'd do that they're
[1:01:23] turning down their invitation now let's
[1:01:26] look at it again and one he said this
[1:01:29] his wife wouldn't let him come and
[1:01:31] that's another excuse there there
[1:01:33] wouldn't be nothing stand between us and
[1:01:36] that
[1:01:37] invitation if it cost you a yoke of ox
[1:01:40] or your business or your wife or your
[1:01:41] children or anything nothing should
[1:01:43] separate us from that invitation God's
[1:01:46] called you to his Harvest field or to do
[1:01:49] something for him there should be
[1:01:52] nothing stand between you and God it
[1:01:54] must come first the invitation given out
[1:01:57] he said when the invitations were given
[1:01:59] out the excuses were was made then back
[1:02:02] they come and said they won't come now
[1:02:04] if you notice the last time that he he
[1:02:06] sent them out was to go into the hedges
[1:02:09] and the highways and byways get the lame
[1:02:11] halt blind and compel them to come in
[1:02:14] for God is determined that his table
[1:02:16] will not be set there'll be nobody there
[1:02:20] God wants his tables full the fatlings
[1:02:23] have been killed everything has been
[1:02:25] fixed and everything's ready and if
[1:02:27] you'll notice the last great message was
[1:02:29] to go was to go into the highways and
[1:02:32] byways now I like that about this little
[1:02:35] church here feeding the poor taking in
[1:02:36] the lame the halt the withered praying
[1:02:38] for the sick I read this little sign
[1:02:41] here what give me the idea and the lame
[1:02:43] shall walk it said certainly and the
[1:02:45] last calling was the last invitation was
[1:02:48] a great time to sweep across the country
[1:02:50] in Divine Healing and that was the last
[1:02:52] and we're winding up the end of that
[1:02:55] just pulling in the Loose Ends right now
[1:02:58] so how close is the coming of the Lord
[1:03:00] go into the hedges and byways bring them
[1:03:03] in compel them to come bring in the lame
[1:03:05] the halt the blind they had their
[1:03:07] healing
[1:03:09] service and so he begins to talk about
[1:03:11] you know brother BOS were talking about
[1:03:13] the healing services but he said you
[1:03:15] know he said but it was the
[1:03:19] Gospel he said but the gospel so that's
[1:03:23] the way it is about
[1:03:26] scroll on up there but Divine Healing it
[1:03:29] brings the people together then the hook
[1:03:31] is the gospel that catches the fishes
[1:03:33] for God's
[1:03:34] kingdom and so you know here's this
[1:03:37] table that's been that's been spread and
[1:03:39] you know when you when you come into
[1:03:41] this place that God has brought you into
[1:03:43] this into God's kingdom and and you're
[1:03:46] in into this and you're able to eat of
[1:03:48] this table that God has prepared for you
[1:03:52] then you know the thing is is you know
[1:03:55] you want you want to share this with
[1:03:56] everybody amen you know the one thing is
[1:03:59] as brother Dale's always said you know
[1:04:01] when you receive the New Birth when you
[1:04:02] see the Holy Ghost is the one thing you
[1:04:04] want to give
[1:04:05] everybody whether you know whether
[1:04:07] whether they'll accept it or not that's
[1:04:08] all that you know that's that's not the
[1:04:10] point the thing is is you want to invit
[1:04:12] invite everybody you want to make sure
[1:04:14] that everybody has this invitation they
[1:04:16] you know everybody knows about this
[1:04:18] invitation and it's been given to
[1:04:20] everybody that he said you know he had
[1:04:22] all this group and and brother R says
[1:04:24] that you know he was rebuking the Jews
[1:04:26] because they had been given this
[1:04:28] invitation unto the unto this coming
[1:04:30] because you know here they are looking
[1:04:31] for the Messiah to come and when the
[1:04:33] Messiah comes they don't recognize him
[1:04:35] and they don't receive him and they turn
[1:04:37] him down and he begins to rebuke them
[1:04:39] because here's this wedding that's been
[1:04:41] promised unto them this this coming this
[1:04:45] great feast that's been played out
[1:04:47] before laid out before them and here it
[1:04:49] is for them to come and they don't
[1:04:51] receive
[1:04:52] it and he says because when they turned
[1:04:54] when he turned the Jews turned him down
[1:04:56] then it was time for him to go to to the
[1:04:59] Gentiles and here they are going to turn
[1:05:02] to the Gentiles to re to bring forth
[1:05:05] this word to them and he says you know
[1:05:07] go to the highways and all wherever and
[1:05:10] make sure that they hear about this that
[1:05:13] there is this great feast and I want
[1:05:15] this thing full there's a place for you
[1:05:17] to come and sit at this table and he
[1:05:19] said well if they don't want to come he
[1:05:21] said well you compel them yes then you
[1:05:23] can continue to you want you just don't
[1:05:26] say here's your
[1:05:28] invitation you don't just leave it in
[1:05:30] the
[1:05:33] mailbox but what but what do you do you
[1:05:35] make sure that they
[1:05:36] know I want you to I want you to be a
[1:05:39] part of that I want you to come and be a
[1:05:42] part of this I've been here and I've
[1:05:45] I've enjoyed myself and I'm I'm full and
[1:05:47] I'm and I'm praising God and I'm
[1:05:49] feasting on these great things and I
[1:05:51] want you to Feast on these great things
[1:05:52] also you can't know if you're just
[1:05:55] standing on the outside looking in but I
[1:05:57] want you to come in and partake of
[1:05:59] this you know as brother brand was
[1:06:02] talking about that man that come and you
[1:06:03] know he he wanted to argue about whether
[1:06:06] God was real and and all these different
[1:06:08] things because you know he couldn't see
[1:06:10] him and he all these type things and and
[1:06:12] brother Brandon was standing there and
[1:06:13] he took that Apple you know he took a
[1:06:14] bite of it and he's like well if you're
[1:06:16] so smart tell me if the apple is sweet
[1:06:18] or
[1:06:20] sour and he was like well I don't know
[1:06:22] he said well that's right because if you
[1:06:23] never take how do you know it's not real
[1:06:26] you want to stand there and say it's not
[1:06:27] real that the days of Miracles have
[1:06:29] passed and all these things and there's
[1:06:31] no such thing as God and there's no such
[1:06:32] a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:35] and all these things well how do you
[1:06:36] know if you never partake of it whether
[1:06:38] it's true or not that's right if you
[1:06:41] never partake how do you know what's
[1:06:42] real or
[1:06:44] not and so here it is when we began to
[1:06:47] speak of these things that I want you to
[1:06:48] partake of these things here's an
[1:06:50] invitation that's went out that you can
[1:06:52] receive all these things here is your
[1:06:54] invitation will you partake of
[1:06:57] this and so here they are trying to draw
[1:07:01] these people
[1:07:04] in and so it's it's the
[1:07:08] time for us to reach out and try to to
[1:07:13] reach out to each
[1:07:15] one and I I said all that to to say to
[1:07:20] say this and I've got I've got a little
[1:07:23] bit more but I'm going be finishing up
[1:07:25] here in a minute but you
[1:07:28] know all of this all of this has
[1:07:31] been laid on me and you know
[1:07:37] because you you go to you go to a youth
[1:07:40] camp and you know you're there to be a
[1:07:43] blessing to
[1:07:46] them but when you
[1:07:49] go you know some people go just to be
[1:07:52] with their friends
[1:07:54] and that's good it's good to have
[1:07:59] friends but you know there's kids that
[1:08:01] come and you don't you don't know what
[1:08:03] they're
[1:08:06] facing and here they are they
[1:08:08] come and you know what it was it was
[1:08:10] really nice to see some of the young
[1:08:12] people that were there and they were
[1:08:15] young young people that were that were
[1:08:18] there that were by
[1:08:20] themselves and they had
[1:08:22] nobody
[1:08:24] and it was it was a it was amazing thing
[1:08:26] that that you had young people walk up
[1:08:28] to people and introduce themselves and
[1:08:30] begin to speak to
[1:08:33] them why because they had a
[1:08:36] need and nobody and you know I can't I
[1:08:40] can't always Reach
[1:08:42] people but let me tell you
[1:08:44] something we don't realize that we say
[1:08:47] well I'm 17 you know what you can reach
[1:08:50] a
[1:08:52] teenager lot times easier and
[1:08:55] better than than a counselor
[1:08:59] could that here here these here these
[1:09:02] kids are and they come and you know they
[1:09:04] come from all kinds of of broken homes
[1:09:06] and or you know they're battling
[1:09:08] different things you don't know what
[1:09:10] kids are facing and sometimes it's
[1:09:12] amazing when you when you you begin to
[1:09:14] see some of these things that these kids
[1:09:16] are
[1:09:18] facing and sometimes we we don't realize
[1:09:22] it
[1:09:24] and I I I want to read I want to read
[1:09:26] this quote this is this is the this is
[1:09:28] the last one this is from the approach
[1:09:30] of God and and and know brother Brown
[1:09:32] was speaking
[1:09:33] and and he's speaking of of you know
[1:09:36] mothers and fathers
[1:09:41] well I I just want
[1:09:44] to I'm just going to read this and but
[1:09:47] you know we look at it and say well it's
[1:09:49] just mothers and fathers well you know
[1:09:51] what you know I think all of us put can
[1:09:55] put ourselves in
[1:09:57] here you
[1:09:59] know I I think you know the Paul said
[1:10:01] you know to treat all of the all the
[1:10:03] women as sisters and the and the older
[1:10:05] ones as you know as as mothers and you
[1:10:09] know we we think of them as as as
[1:10:12] brothers you know we honor we honor
[1:10:15] these
[1:10:17] people and here here is in the message
[1:10:20] approach to God he's he's speaking of of
[1:10:22] job and and is thinking looking at his
[1:10:25] children and and he's seeing seeing the
[1:10:27] kind of Life they live and and you know
[1:10:29] job was so interested in what his kids
[1:10:31] were going through that you know he
[1:10:32] would offer a sacrifice for his children
[1:10:35] whether whether they had committed a sin
[1:10:37] or anything like that but you know he
[1:10:38] wanted he wanted his his children
[1:10:40] protected he wanted his children covered
[1:10:43] and it says so he took the burnt
[1:10:44] offering and made an offering for his
[1:10:46] children he sacrificed for each and
[1:10:48] every one of his children that maybe
[1:10:50] listen see maybe they had Sinn maybe
[1:10:53] they never never knew would never s
[1:10:54] around job
[1:10:57] maybe they didn't know nothing about it
[1:10:59] maybe he didn't know nothing about it
[1:11:01] but knowing that they were out there in
[1:11:03] the world
[1:11:04] alone I tell you what we need today is
[1:11:07] more good oldfashioned praying mothers
[1:11:09] and fathers for their children if we had
[1:11:12] that would be the greatest support to do
[1:11:15] away with juvenile delinquency I know of
[1:11:18] first give me an oldfashioned give me
[1:11:20] oldfashioned Mothers and and daddies who
[1:11:23] pray for their
[1:11:25] children and this is this what struck me
[1:11:28] said look look at here boy or girl this
[1:11:30] afternoon he said if you've got a mother
[1:11:32] or dad like that the Holy Spirit
[1:11:34] speaking to your heart that's your
[1:11:37] mother's prayers you're walking over the
[1:11:39] top of remember that and you'll never
[1:11:43] Prosper out Prosper at all till you turn
[1:11:46] and surrender yourself to Christ that's
[1:11:48] right now job said they may have sinned
[1:11:50] so he offered the best that he had all
[1:11:53] that he knowed because that's all the
[1:11:55] approach he had to God so he killed one
[1:11:57] lamb for his own approach he killed
[1:12:00] another one for one boy and another one
[1:12:02] for another making a burnt sacrifice for
[1:12:04] each one and to have a way of approach
[1:12:07] to God God seen the honesty and
[1:12:12] sincerity and what what struck me I I
[1:12:14] was I was reading that and you know you
[1:12:16] you see the the children the way they
[1:12:17] are and and you know we we said well you
[1:12:20] know it's Mom and Daddy and you know
[1:12:22] what but you know
[1:12:25] Brother D has said so many times you
[1:12:27] know it's it's every one of us when we
[1:12:29] dedicate a baby everyone of us are
[1:12:32] dedicating ourselves to live the life in
[1:12:33] front of that
[1:12:36] child that that child doesn't just see
[1:12:38] Mom and Daddy and aunt and uncles and
[1:12:40] everything like that but you know what
[1:12:42] every one of them ought to see Jesus
[1:12:43] Christ and each one of
[1:12:45] us that it's our responsibility to to to
[1:12:48] live a life that that's glorifies God in
[1:12:51] front of them children that they know
[1:12:53] who God is not just not just thinking
[1:12:56] that you know it's you know this one or
[1:12:59] that one no we all are
[1:13:01] responsible and and as this scripture
[1:13:03] you know they're they're looking for
[1:13:05] somebody they're looking for something
[1:13:07] real yes and you
[1:13:14] know I I had there was something that
[1:13:17] took place at at the camp and and it was
[1:13:20] it was just amazing there was a there's
[1:13:22] a a young man that was there and he had
[1:13:25] he had somebody that came it was a
[1:13:27] counselor not his counselor but he had
[1:13:29] somebody come to him and began to speak
[1:13:31] to him about his
[1:13:33] condition and began to tell him about
[1:13:35] his
[1:13:36] life he said the Lord laid it upon the
[1:13:39] counselor's heart to come talk to this
[1:13:40] young
[1:13:41] man and speak to him and what was so
[1:13:45] amazing was this young man nobody knew
[1:13:47] what he was going through nobody knew
[1:13:50] what what was in his life nobody knew
[1:13:52] what was in his heart
[1:13:54] but it LA but God laid laid something on
[1:13:56] this young this young counselor to come
[1:13:58] and speak to this young man and began to
[1:14:00] speak to him and tell him the things he
[1:14:01] had been going
[1:14:03] through and what was so amazing about
[1:14:05] that was that here's this young man
[1:14:07] struggling in life and and not coming
[1:14:10] into the place that he needs to be but
[1:14:11] God and His in his infinite wisdom and
[1:14:14] his and his mercy here he comes brings
[1:14:16] this young man that they've never met
[1:14:17] before these two had never met but all
[1:14:19] of a sudden here's this young man and
[1:14:21] and this counselor is led by the Holy
[1:14:24] Spirit to come speak to this man about
[1:14:25] his
[1:14:27] life and you know and he said nobody
[1:14:29] nobody knows these things not not not
[1:14:31] even not even his family not even his
[1:14:33] parents do these things but you know
[1:14:35] what was on the inside of but God began
[1:14:36] to speak to him to tell him listen this
[1:14:38] is where you need to be and to show you
[1:14:41] that what's what's down on the inside
[1:14:44] your thoughts of thoughts the intents of
[1:14:46] your heart and nobody else in this world
[1:14:48] knows but God knows that he lays it upon
[1:14:51] somebody's heart to come speak to you to
[1:14:53] tell tell you the things that you need
[1:14:54] to do where you're standing and and that
[1:14:57] God's mindful of you
[1:15:00] amen and so when when God begins to
[1:15:02] speak to this young man then you know
[1:15:05] you know but the the thing is is you
[1:15:07] know we we see these kids and they begin
[1:15:09] to to see that God has begin to move
[1:15:11] that God's
[1:15:13] real you know it wasn't it's not
[1:15:16] psychology when God becomes begins to
[1:15:18] speak to you and he knows the thoughts
[1:15:20] and intents of the heart when begins to
[1:15:23] speak to you on your level to the place
[1:15:25] which you need to be and when he begins
[1:15:27] to do these things then you realize
[1:15:29] that's God speaking to you that's your
[1:15:32] day of visitation and let me tell you
[1:15:35] something there's there's kids out there
[1:15:36] that have just started on this journey
[1:15:39] there's there's some out there that
[1:15:40] still hasn't hasn't surrendered their
[1:15:43] lives to God but God began to deal with
[1:15:45] them in that camp well we began to pray
[1:15:48] for the young people before we went to
[1:15:50] Camp well I want I want to admonish
[1:15:52] everybody here I I want you to not just
[1:15:54] continue to pray for them young people
[1:15:56] because when God began to stir their
[1:15:58] Waters and you know what if they've not
[1:15:59] come to that place and we going to
[1:16:01] continue to pray for them until God gets
[1:16:03] a hold of them and if they begin to walk
[1:16:05] in the in the light do God begin to walk
[1:16:08] in well you know what if they come to a
[1:16:09] place of justification then if God's
[1:16:11] going to carry them all the way to the
[1:16:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost then you know
[1:16:14] what then we're going to continue to
[1:16:16] pray for them whether we know their
[1:16:17] names but God knows them and you know
[1:16:20] what it's our job to pray it's our job
[1:16:23] to compel them we may not be able to see
[1:16:25] them or lay our hands on them or pray
[1:16:27] for them or speak to them but you know
[1:16:29] we can speak on their behalf to the
[1:16:30] father we can become their intercessor
[1:16:33] before God that God began to speak to
[1:16:35] them and whatever is in their midst and
[1:16:38] just not just our young people in our
[1:16:40] church but to all the young people I was
[1:16:43] listening to Brother John Andes the
[1:16:44] other day and you know he was he was
[1:16:47] speaking at the camp and then when he
[1:16:48] was at his home church he was speaking
[1:16:50] and you know it's not it's not just it's
[1:16:52] not just ours and theirs but you know
[1:16:54] what it's all together why because we're
[1:16:56] a body we're a body Ministry so if we
[1:16:59] begin to minister we got to minister to
[1:17:00] everybody because you know it's not my
[1:17:03] group and your group no we're all the
[1:17:04] body of Christ and we're all going to
[1:17:06] pray for all of them wherever they're at
[1:17:09] whatever they're facing then you know
[1:17:10] we're going to hold them up in prayer
[1:17:12] but I want every one of them to realize
[1:17:14] there's a place God has prepared a table
[1:17:17] in the presence of your enemies and when
[1:17:19] the devil keeps fighting you I want you
[1:17:21] to come back to the table but because
[1:17:23] God is giving you a place that you come
[1:17:25] and no matter what you're facing no
[1:17:27] matter how much you feel that you're So
[1:17:29] Unworthy or or whatever God still has a
[1:17:31] place for you to come and feed on the
[1:17:33] good things of God God has made this
[1:17:35] thing for you to come don't just stand
[1:17:37] in the background and think well I'm
[1:17:38] unworthy no God is calling you when God
[1:17:41] calls your name and he calls your number
[1:17:43] and he knows where you're at and he
[1:17:44] gives you that invitation to come they
[1:17:47] know it's the time to come don't wait we
[1:17:50] don't know how much longer we've got but
[1:17:51] we need to answer that call
[1:17:54] I know I I want to pray and you know
[1:17:56] because I've got two sons and you know
[1:17:58] what I want God to get a hold of them
[1:18:00] and there's other children in this
[1:18:01] church that are not in the place where
[1:18:03] they need to be but then you're going to
[1:18:05] continue to pray for them until God gets
[1:18:07] a hold of them and wherever they go
[1:18:09] they're still our children and wherever
[1:18:11] they went to you know what they're still
[1:18:13] our are still our inheritance they're
[1:18:16] still our
[1:18:18] possession amen that's the promise of
[1:18:21] God that our children ours and you know
[1:18:23] what then we're going to continue
[1:18:24] because not only are they my Heritage
[1:18:26] but you know what they're God's Heritage
[1:18:28] and you know what then God is going to
[1:18:29] protect them but you know what he give
[1:18:31] us the responsibility to be the ones to
[1:18:34] be the intercessors for them to show
[1:18:36] them hold the light and Shine the Light
[1:18:38] and show them the path that they should
[1:18:40] take amen why because it's it's an
[1:18:43] important
[1:18:45] job I want I want to do all that I
[1:18:49] can God has a place for us
[1:18:55] and that's what God wants us to do
[1:18:57] continue to hold them up continue to
[1:19:00] shine the light continue to compel them

[1:19:52] 20 questions and everybody knows what
[1:19:55] kind of ice cream we like and uh what

[1:20:06] things then you know what we need to get
[1:20:08] on there and we need to talk about the
[1:20:10] good things of God
[1:20:13] Amen I ain't pointing no fingers no
[1:20:17] more but you know what you've got if
[1:20:19] you've got a testimony then you can
[1:20:21] share it
[1:20:24] right and I know we've not we've not had
[1:20:26] a testimony service but you know what
[1:20:28] maybe the Lord allow us to have one to
[1:20:31] have the young people give their
[1:20:32] testimony if they have one from
[1:20:36] camp but you I want I want them to to
[1:20:38] have have and and show the world what
[1:20:42] that God's real what God has done for
[1:20:48] them I was listening to brother Jason
[1:20:50] Watkins some time back and brother Jason
[1:20:52] and talking about he said now people get
[1:20:54] together he said you can argue the
[1:20:55] scripture he said you can argue these
[1:20:57] different things but he said the one
[1:20:58] thing they can argue is your
[1:21:02] experience he said because they didn't
[1:21:04] have it you did he said now they don't
[1:21:07] have to believe your experience but they
[1:21:09] can't argue with
[1:21:11] it and that's the thing if you had an
[1:21:14] experience if you know what God that
[1:21:15] God's real then you show it you share
[1:21:19] it and let us all be be more salty in
[1:21:23] this world that that people can see the
[1:21:25] things that God's
[1:21:28] real because it's so easy just to blend
[1:21:31] into the
[1:21:34] background but you know but he but Jesus
[1:21:37] said we are
[1:21:39] lights the light of the
[1:21:42] world he said a city set on the hill
[1:21:44] cannot be
[1:21:46] hid he said a light that's lit is not
[1:21:48] put under a
[1:21:49] bushel right but when it's lit it's put
[1:21:52] in a
[1:21:53] Candlestick that that light may shine
[1:21:55] all
[1:21:57] around and that's our job to show the
[1:21:59] world the light of Jesus
[1:22:01] Christ and these young people when they
[1:22:04] when they come
[1:22:05] in I I you know we had they had two

[1:22:16] anything about him all I know is the
[1:22:18] Lord stirred his his water so much that
[1:22:21] he told Brother Jason Mars he said I
[1:22:23] can't wait till tomorrow to get

[1:22:30] Mars is down there in the lake 1:00 in
[1:22:31] the morning baptizing this young
[1:22:34] man why because he was stirred by
[1:22:37] something he wasn't going to wait till
