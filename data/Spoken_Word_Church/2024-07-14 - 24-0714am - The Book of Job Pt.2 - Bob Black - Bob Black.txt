TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you and good morning morning let's turn to the The Book of Job again and and let's just read our scripture from verse 20 to 22 Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning and I I pray Lord that these words Lord will be helpful to to as we as we study these things out Lord help us Lord as we navigate these scriptures Lord God to guide us through them Lord Jesus and Quicken them to our hearts I pray Lord that you'll prepare our hearts for what's in store for us today Lord God as we meditate upon your words Grant it Lord that you'll be with us now we pray in your name so we've been studying started studying The Book of Job the most depressing book in the Bible and it's funny how the most depressing book maybe can give you encouragement in time of trouble and um you know the the reason um I think why this book is so helpful is because it frames our thinking up in the way you know we we wonder why things are the way they are and are the things that I'm going through are they normal and this book kind of uh helps us to understand understand that when we're going through rough times it is normal it's normal it's part of it's part of life suffering and trials and things and and uh and a lot of times God will allow things to happen to us so that we can he can see our reaction and so we can see our reaction and look at job's reaction here in verse 20 where it says then job arose after all these things befell him and chapter one then job arose and in his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all this job sinned not nor charged God foolishly now what a what a reaction there you can see uh a lot of strange things happening here in his reaction he's of course he's G Grievous he's grieving and after all the things that befell him you that's that's a totally normal reaction and then he worshiped God which is a strange reaction and we'll get to that a little bit later but um he he said basically what he's saying here is that everything I got God gave me God gave it to me it's his right to take it away now that's framing up the a mature reaction to things that happen in your life it's it's God no matter what what happens to me I'm trusting God regardless the lord gave me everything that I've got is is he he's the one that give it to me and if he takes it away from me then blessed be the name of the Lord amen now think about that kind of reaction something horrible like that befil him I I was I was talking to my wife the other day you think if God took away one of your children that would be devastating but he took away all of his children if God took away your livelihood that would be devastating he took away all of his camels all of his everything everything was gone and he still in that moment could say the lord gave the Lord can take away blessed be the name of the Lord amen and all this job s not nor charge God foolishly so the Book of Job what doing is framing up our understanding of how God runs the world and as well what later on we'll get into the all his friends coming and telling him their their different perspectives which were all wrong and and that's how we we look at things that are happening in our life and we've got our own perspective of things how how things really are and and many times it's wrong so job is helping us to frame it up so that we look at things the right way and at at the end you'll see God God's telling job were do do you know how the world was framed up do you know how the Stars like we we come with with our little puny conception of how things really are and there's a greater purpose and a greater understanding if we could really see things from the way God's looking at it we'd look at things different so that's what job is trying to Frank it help us to understand why things are the way they are and one one thing that we can look at is in Job chapter 14 that I read last Sunday man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble so life that means life is full of suff suffering what can we get out of that scripture that life because life is full of suffering suffering does not automatically mean that you are not a Christian or that you are a secret sinner or something I said that's what job's all of his friends were they just leap to the conclusion you're going through a bad spot in life there must be something wrong in your life and job kept going back I've done everything right I've done I've done everything that I know that I can do so it it normalizes suffering this this this perspective normalizes you're going through a rough time you know somebody loses their job or uh loses a loved one or these are things that are normal to happen and and like Psalm chapter 90 David David tells us the days of our years or three score years and 10 and if by reason of strength they be four score Years yet is their strength lay labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away now you look back many of us look back on all of our Liv all of our years and it's a lot there's a lot of sorrow and sadness and a lot of things what we're in this sin condition and and and that's that's part of life that there's a lot of a lot of bad things there's a lot of good things but there's a lot of bad too Ecclesiastes Solomon said for what hath a man of all all his labor and of the vexation of his heart wherein he ha labored Under the Sun for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yay his heart taketh not rest in the night this is also vanity Solomon wisest man on Earth his heart taketh not rest in the night in Psalm 939 David said behold thou has made my days as in hand breath in my age is as nothing before theee verily every man at his best date is all together vanity Amen in Psalm 103 David said as for man his days are his grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more that's a sad thought and I I look I watch my neighbor he he labored he built this this big workshop and all these kind of things and then then the bank foreclosed on him took it all away and somebody else moved in and and uh now they own that property and all that labor it it's that's sorrowful to think about I I I watched my my uh my grandparents when before they died they they labored and built this nice house and and had a beautiful garden and a spring in the backyard and all these kind of things and then then they died and somebody else moved in and and just trash the place and and it that's sorrowful well here we have no continuing City we're not living for this life we're looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God that's right so we're looking for the end the end of the story is Christ this is not where we're building up our Treasures but we're storing up our Treasures in Heaven that's that's where our heart is right and and you think job why why would all these things happen to job job the the frame up the story job was doing everything everything right he was righteous and that means he was matching up his life was matching up with the standard that God had laid out for him he was doing everything right so in job 1:1 it says there was a man in the land of oo us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and issued evil now perfect means he was he was blameless or he he had Integrity he was he was living right he was doing right he was walking right everything he he was trying to dot every eye and cross every tea and just live live life anytime you make a mistake go offer the sacrifice and and it says he was upright so that means he was living a just and honest life now the reason the Bible belabors this point is because you you contrast that with all these things happening to him well there's got to be a reason why and it wasn't because he was doing something wrong it says that he feared God he had reverence and respect for God he assed evil he was constantly turning away from and avoiding evil now Ezekiel spoke so highly of job if you read in Ezekiel chapter 14 that it compared job to job's right righteousness to Daniel and Noah so job was living a righteous kind of life and a righteous not life life is not an easy life in Psalm 34 it says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all in Matthew Chapter 5 Jesus said blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and first Peter it says but if you suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their Terror neither be trouble and second Timothy says yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so suffering is going to come with righteous a righteous life and we read that quote last time in the message the ark where brother R said you might be sick for a little while you may have to go through something for a little B while but remember Christ is at the end he never said this Ark will set in a little Whirlpool where there'll be no calm just as calm as it can be he never carried a flower bread of ease he never promised things easy but he promised Grace to sustain you in the time so he never promised that life would be easy there's plenty of promises that life is going to be hard that you go through times where you just wonder almost if you can bear the the suffering and the agony and so that's if we frame it ight if frame up our perspective that we can see that there is really no promise that suffering will always be at a manageable level right now that's that's if we look sometimes uh you look at you look at situations and you just wonder how you can cope with it it seems like it's just washing over you like a wave and you just can't you just can't bear it and I think sometimes we we've we we've come to look at suffering it with a skewed interpretation of scripture because like 1 Corinthians chap 10: 13 is often misquoted if I if I was going to read that real quick it says there hath no temptation taken you but such is common demand but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be be able to Bear it right amen now what's that mean brother R he preached a sermon about this that that God will if if if let's say if you're if you're a drunkard there's a way of Escape out of being a drunker and that way is Christ if you're a sinner there's a way of Escape there is a way of Escape out of the Temptation and God won't give you a Temptation that there's not a way to get out of it but this is speaking of Temptation not suffering and life life bearing down on you so hard where it seems sometimes like you just can't bear it there's not a promise where he won't give you so much that so much that you just can't handle it cuz sometimes you got to turn it over to God many times you got to turn it over to God I was reading this morning where brother Brandon was talking about um he he he was telling his life story of how he watched his wife and little Sharon Rose die and and then it just became so unbearable till he got to that place where he reached up and grabbed the power line but God come on the scene and raised him up and then he said he said I was sitting there after that after that happened this is a born again Christian he he was sitting there in his home and he got a letter in the mail and it was addressed to Miss Sharon Rose brandom and he said that just pushed him over the edge now see sometimes things in life get to where you just you just feel like you can't handle it you can't bear it and that pushed him over the edge and he grabbed his gun he went out I guess he was in the woods or somewhere grabbed his gun pulled his gun up to his head and he said I I was delirious I couldn't I couldn't deal with it pull the trigger and it wasn't him that saved him it was God that Sav him see sometime we get to the place where we just can't deal with it anymore and that's when you got to turn it over to God when you can't bear it anymore you turn it over to God and he's the one that will come on the scene and will bear it amen so we look at First Corinthians chapter 10 that's about Temptation and temptation is about your choices God's not going to give you put you to to a place where there's not a way of Escape where you can't make the right choice but suffering is a different category from your choices suffering and life and and thing you know I I I was thinking this morning about when Esther was born I'd got laid off from my job and I was watching her being born and I didn't I was my insurance was about to run out and you you feel like you actually when you get in a place of pressure you actually feel like that there's a weight a literal weight on you and you you you're thinking you know what what am I going to do I I can't I can't just run out and go get a job or something you know you I call the recruiters and they they wouldn't even answer during that time and I it was around uh uh 20 years ago or whatever where there was a market uh crash and there were no jobs available and and you get to a place where you feel that weight what are you going to do and and you God brings you to those places what are you going to do you can't bear it you can't do it there's nothing within yourself so what you got to do is turn it over to God turn it over to God and let him bear your burden now Temptation temptation is a desire or urge to do something especially something unwise or wrong but suffering now this suffering is a different category it's a state of undergoing pain or distress or hardship and it's often suffering sometimes is unavoidable it's just part of The Human Condition it's just part of living and now that's the story of job that is framing up sometimes things just happen in life that doesn't have anything to do with whether you're righteous or unrighteous it's just part of living or part of God just pulling the Hedge back to see What You're Made Of to allow things to happen to you to mold your character and it has nothing to do with whether you're right or wrong it's just it's just part of life like like losing your job or or losing a loved one or things things just happening that befall everybody that just happen to everybody it's just part of life yes so there's no promise now that God won't allow overwhelming suffering overwhelming suffering now now think about that in the in I I was reading through all these stories of the uh uh I'm trying to remember the name of the the Christian ladies um that were martyred that were actually there was a a Christian lady in the uh third Century ad that they they grabbed her and she had a little woman that worked with her and they they they they arrested him and this little woman her name was Felicity and she was pregnant and they grabbed her and threw her into the uh the prison of the Coliseum and she was pregnant at 8 months and and because of of her Christian stand I'm talking about suffering now suffer that you would think that God want not allow overwhelming suffer suffering she was pregnant at 8 months and they grabbed her she gave birth in prison right a month before she died in the Roman Coliseum there's a lot of things that have happened through life uh Paul getting his head chopped off and being dragged to Rome and Peter being crucified upside down and the the saints that that had uh Li hung upside down and have salt shoved in their nose to and tortured tortured and unimaginable torture see it seems like those were those were unbearable things but God was on the SC Amen in 2 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul said speaking of very unbearable suffering he said we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure out of measure means it was beyond our our tolerance above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves see when you get to a place where you just can't bear it no more oh that's when you put all your trust in God when you maybe reach over to the side of your bed and your loved one's not there anymore or you you you're you you you wish that maybe you could do things over again and you just can't bear it no more and it seems like the waves of suffering are just crashing down over you put it put it in God's hands turn to him and say God I need you to help me and he'll help you like like he helped brother Brandon when he stopped that bullet stopped the gun from firing he helped him when when he reached up and grabbed the power line and it was beyond anything that he could do so Paul said that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver and whom whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us yes Psalm 34 like we just read many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord deliverthat me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me in Philippians chapter 4 says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me amen now see there is when you're framing it up the right way you're not trusting in your own ability you're not trusting in your own self but you're trusting in the god that he's the one that makes a way he's the one that rose on Easter Sunday and he's the one that gives us strength in the time of adversity and there will be times of adversities yes you think about all these stories that are laid out in the scripture of Christians and Believers that faced tremendous adversities like job that lost everything and Joseph that was thrown into prison by his own brothers and Daniel that got thrown in the Lion's Den and Shadrach mesach and Abednego and John the Baptist thrown into prison and then cut his they cut his head off and Stever that was stoned those all seemed like unbearable suffering to be stoned to be rocks thrown at you till your heads cracked open and you're laying there in the street looking up at the Sun as your life Le you Paul was beat in prison Shipwrecked constant danger Peter was crucified upside down all the early Christian Martyrs that were crucified in Roman Arenas polycarp that was burned at the stake Joon of art William tendale John bunan thrown into prison for 12 years for preaching without being sanctioned by the church and on and on so Christian scripture emphasizes that God's God's going to be there with us during SU suffering but it doesn't promise that our suffering is always going to be manageable by our own abilities that's right God might allow life to bring us to our knees so that we can learn to trust him you know that's I think that's when our character is really shaped when it's really shaped when you're maybe maybe curled up in the shower in the morning in an Agony because there's mental problems and mental battle that's what most of the jok was about the mental problems first the first chapter is everything Stripped Away the second chapter is he he doesn't have his health anymore and then the following chapters it's mental anguish and battles and things and that's when that's when in that in that in The Crucible of life when your character really begins to be shaped God allows us to go through these things sometimes to validate and effectively mold our character to validate our character you go through a place in life where you you you get tested and it validates that you really have the goods it validates that you really trust God brother Ram would compare that to a uh he he'd call it a Capa and in one place he said there's a a Capa is like this big giant furnace thing where they would make they would make uh fashion something out of uh you know metal and and if they get all the ingredients right and like if they're making a bail they' get have this big F uh this big Capa where they're molding something in it and they're molding a in the story brother random told a baale and if they can get all the ingredients right and get the fire real nice and hot when they pull that that uh the bail out of the Capa then it would ring right and see that's what our life is sometimes the things that we go through in life where the Fire gets real hot and if all the ingredients are just right right after it's tested after it gets pulled out of the Capa the big Capa and then they strike it and it'll ring just right now that's what we want we want to be pulled out of the fire and God canest us and and if you ring right you'll do like job and you'll say no l no matter what happens I'm still trusting you're not trusting him to get something you're not trusting him to get a lot of money you're not trusting him to get a lot of wealth or have a lot of popularity popularity no matter what happens in life you're still going to trust him if the Lord takes everything away from you I'm going to trust him no matter what now there is a real mature Christian and we have seen his star brother R said did you ever see them when they was fixing to mold a bail some famous bail for a church chime or something that had to give a certain Dean you see if you're ringing a chime it takes a certain range for each B and it takes certain materials to go in there so much brass so much steel and so much of other ores to go into this bail if it's just straight brass it won't ring right it's got to have all kinds of materials thrown into it to make it ring the right kind of a tone and the man who has put the mold up and set the mold he knows exactly what it takes to go in that Capa what it takes to go into that metal to make that Bale ring that tone God is our great Capa God is he is the great Refiner's furnace that where he has to put these things upon us and trials and persecutions and things to mold it together to make our testimony ring for a certain time and a certain note that he wants rang out in a certain day so you got to go through the fire yes you got to where people mock you and make fun of the way that you're living and and and and and go through all the the the Hall of critics because look suffering is necessary for your character development what does it do it builds it builds resilience so somebody says something uh somebody says something about the way that you're living and the way maybe it'll affect you when you're a young Christian but later on you're not you're not looking for validation from somebody else you can stand on your own two feet and you can know like like job said I I know my redeemer liveth you don't need somebody else to tell you you know it's and it builds resilience as you go through the fire it it it it it Fosters Independence because you you're standing on your own you you got to be independ you got to be able to stand on your own two feet it helps you to understand consequences and and it helps you to cultivate empathy cuz how can you really feel for somebody if you've never gone through trials and never never gone through something you know you you you you have back trouble you can feel for somebody that's has has back trouble you you have migraines you can feel for somebody that's got migraines you ever been laid off before you can feel for somebody that's been laid off you lose a spouse or lose a loved one or something you can feel for somebody that's going through that and then you can really you can Minister and help to somebody and what does it do hard times actually builds your self-esteem too it it helps you it helps you look at things differently because you you get you get crushed and you get you get molded down to where you're trusting in God and then you realize you start to realize that you're genuine hallu yes sir and you start to appreciate positive experiences you start to appreciate appreciate life because you're looking at things differently hard times and trials and tribulations are necessary for character development that's one thing to keep in mind as we're raising our children as we're about to close I I'll stop on this note but you know sometimes we want to prevent our children from from in from hard times and from suffering and things but that's actually what if we'll take a step back and allow sometimes allow things to happen allow them to go through a little rough spot I I will I was watching Zoe when she she had to she she got called to uh uh this this place where that does teaches violin students they they didn't have a piano teacher so she got called to play the piano for the of this little class and boy she was so nervous she didn't think that she could do it and you know she was real nervous about doing that and you know once it's all done then you it builds you now she's got a little bit more confidence but going into it you know you I don't know I don't think I can do it and and you you're Str she's stressing and practicing a little bit more and see what where would we be without those those suff those suffering times where you're you're maybe you're staying awake the night before worrying about it and wondering how it's going to turn out but it actually molds your character and what see what we do sometimes as parents is we try to limit those things but that's that's not what God did with job and that's not that's not how you're going to be how you're really going to grow to a mature individual and I'm over time so we'll stop there but God allows these things to happen to us amen for our good God bless you [Applause]
