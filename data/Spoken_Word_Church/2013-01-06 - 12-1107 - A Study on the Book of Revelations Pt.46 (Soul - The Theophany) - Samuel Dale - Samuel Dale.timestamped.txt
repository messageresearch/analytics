[4:02] yes guide each one Lord remember all of
[4:05] the sick ones the requests that were

[4:09] in Jesus name
[4:13] amen thank everybody for praying for my
[4:15] sister she was better today and they're
[4:18] putting her back out of the IC unit back
[4:20] down into a regular room so just keep
[4:22] praying for her but the Lord would would
[4:24] take care of she's got pneumonia and
[4:26] then she got a bladder infection I think
[4:29] a few things but you know just pray the
[4:31] Lord would bless
[4:34] her Revelations 1 and somebody put a
[4:38] pointer back there in the in the office
[4:41] so you we can we can we can get you cuz
[4:44] if you go to sleep then I'll
[4:49] go the
[4:51] eyeballs I don't know who it was
[4:53] somebody put it in the office back there
[4:54] so we we got up here we'll leave it lay
[4:57] laying up here to be able to be used
[4:59] okay amen
[5:01] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[5:04] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[5:07] things which must shortly come to pass
[5:09] and he sent and signified it by his
[5:11] Angel unto his servant John who by
[5:14] record of the word of God and of the
[5:15] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[5:17] things that he saw blessed is he that
[5:20] readeth and they that hear the words of
[5:21] this prophecy and keep those things
[5:23] which are written therein for the time
[5:26] is at hand we keep reading Revelations 1
[5:30] for one
[5:32] purpose to keep in your mind one thing
[5:36] the Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[5:39] Christ it's not the revelation of the
[5:42] Antichrist it's not the revelation of
[5:44] who's going to be president and we got
[5:45] one now and whatever but you know it's
[5:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ all right
[5:53] so then that's the point that we keep
[5:54] reading that now we're over in the fifth
[5:57] seal so we'll go to Revelation 6
[6:00] verse 9- 11 and when he had opened the
[6:03] fifth seal now remember there was no
[6:05] combat Beast under this fifth seal
[6:09] because the combat beast of the fourth
[6:11] seal was the
[6:13] eagle which would be the prophetic gift
[6:16] that was given unto us in the last days
[6:18] through a man to be able to speak to us
[6:21] what the word of God is all right so now
[6:23] our dependence is
[6:25] upon the fourth combat Beast right MH
[6:29] which is the Eagle which is to be in was
[6:31] in a prophet to bring us a message
[6:33] brother brandom now it's here to be in
[6:36] you and I Amen to interpret those things
[6:39] to each one of us all right now so it
[6:43] said and when he had open the fifth seal
[6:44] I saw under the altar The Souls of them
[6:47] that were slain for the word of God and
[6:49] for the testimony which they held MH and
[6:52] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[6:54] long oh Lord holy and true do thou not
[6:57] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[6:58] dwell on the Earth
[7:00] and white robes were given unto every
[7:02] one of them and it was said unto them
[7:04] that they should rest yet for a little
[7:07] season now you remember how we brought
[7:09] that out we'll refer to it again in a
[7:11] minute white robes are given unto
[7:14] them evidently here mhm then we'll read
[7:18] the prophet word before the 144,000 are
[7:21] killed that's right so you know where is
[7:24] it done at and what's happens there and
[7:26] what is their Redemption that's what we
[7:28] were talking about the other day the
[7:30] white roads were given unto every one of
[7:32] them and it was said unto them that they
[7:34] should rest yet for a little season
[7:36] until their fell servants also and their
[7:38] Brethren that should be killed as they
[7:41] were should be fulfilled you may be
[7:44] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[7:46] reading of the
[7:48] word
[7:50] now we spent the whole service both of
[7:54] them there Sunday speaking about how
[7:58] that the this fifth seal shows us a
[8:02] great Revelation remember the prophet
[8:03] said there's a lot of things here to be
[8:05] made known here all right and one of
[8:09] them was that he said it done away with
[8:11] soul
[8:12] sleeping all right you said well that's
[8:14] just a a Doctrine but to
[8:17] me it's the greatest understanding of
[8:21] what your soul really
[8:23] is that's in the scriptures I mean I I
[8:26] say that without backing up that you
[8:29] know to me it is now to show me that see
[8:32] I can look there and see Souls of them
[8:35] not bodies of them not people right
[8:38] standing there you know but that soul of
[8:42] the
[8:44] individual that was killed down through
[8:46] there those those
[8:48] Jews and and it was coming down through
[8:50] ikan and Hitler not your 144,000 and not
[8:54] the Old Testament Jew because they have
[8:56] their Redemptive plan they had the blood
[8:59] of bulls and goats and it was sufficient
[9:02] and then when Jesus Christ came proving
[9:04] it was sufficient he went down preach of
[9:08] the spirits or souls in prison came back
[9:11] up and picked up the Old Testament
[9:12] Saints with him correct all right so
[9:15] then that
[9:17] way you know we can see that that the
[9:20] soul is the real you
[9:24] amen uh you know you say but but brother
[9:27] Dale why is it so important to
[9:30] understand something like that uh we're
[9:33] just a body Spirit Soul that's what it
[9:36] takes to make us that's true I'll give
[9:38] you quotes for it if you want um
[9:40] paragraph 157 questions and answers 1961
[9:44] where brother R says you're a body
[9:45] spirit and soul that's what you are
[9:46] right man that's
[9:48] fine all right but then I want to ask
[9:51] you a
[9:54] question if we don't see how to
[9:57] divide between
[10:00] the parts or whatever you want to call
[10:02] them Body Spirit Soul whatever you want
[10:04] to say how to divide that you know if
[10:08] you don't understand that how are you
[10:12] going to understand any form of
[10:15] redemption right
[10:19] right cuz you just say well well we're
[10:21] just what does it matter we're just to
[10:25] be who
[10:29] would you
[10:31] agree that after you're born
[10:33] again that you still do wrong amen yes
[10:37] sir will you agree amen will you agree
[10:40] that you even sin right sure absolutely
[10:43] we going to give a quote the prophet
[10:45] just in a minute so you better shake
[10:46] your head uhhuh you know that's a good
[10:49] amen you know about two or three nods
[10:50] you
[10:53] know so then what part of you is it
[10:56] that's doing the sin that's right
[11:01] if you're just a unit of Body Spirit and
[11:03] soul without dividing it and
[11:06] understanding what is taking place then
[11:09] what part of you are sinning right see
[11:12] then a smart addict like me comes along
[11:13] and says I can prove by the prophet that
[11:16] if you Sin from your soul you're not
[11:18] born again right right
[11:22] right so then I think it's very very
[11:25] vital to break it down amen and
[11:31] understand the real you and what it is
[11:34] and what's taking
[11:37] place and how that you can actually
[11:40] profit do you sin he said every
[11:45] day now is he using that word sin as a
[11:49] disbelieving God's
[11:51] word or is he using it as we were trying
[11:54] to express especially down in the Bible
[11:56] study the other night about Paul and the
[11:58] things I would I do not the thing I do
[12:00] would not Etc you know so he said with
[12:03] the inward man I saw that serve the law
[12:04] of God the outward man I serve the law
[12:06] of the flesh right amen and brother R
[12:09] said that's not talking about living
[12:10] under adultery and and running around
[12:12] and all the it's just simple natural
[12:15] life things right MH you know not great
[12:18] big things but it's still sin right so
[12:22] then if we if we're just what do we need
[12:25] to know because we're just you know what
[12:28] does it matter I'm just a I'm a unit
[12:30] myself well what sinning right that's
[12:34] right MH you it's your body it's it's
[12:37] your spirit it's it your
[12:41] soul now when we were
[12:44] Sinners we was a unit of sin right right
[12:47] that's right before we was born again we
[12:50] was a complete unit of sin Body Spirit
[12:53] and soul that's right
[12:56] amen but when I got born again which
[12:58] didn't get born again in our body didn't
[13:00] get born again in our spirit got born
[13:02] again in our soul that's right see then
[13:05] the Soul sealed
[13:07] in so the sin can't be from the soul
[13:10] right that's right it has to be the
[13:13] human reasoning
[13:15] factors of mankind the things that we
[13:18] are and the things that we are human
[13:21] beings and I said we shouldn't even be
[13:23] dealing with that's when you say sin
[13:25] people sin
[13:29] your Prophet said it we'll read it in a
[13:31] minute did he send every day right y
[13:36] well he didn't really mean
[13:39] that I don't have the ability to divide
[13:42] between what he meant and what he didn't
[13:43] mean right amen that's right I just take
[13:45] what he said amen and
[13:48] believe
[13:49] now in doing that then the Soul is the
[13:53] real
[13:56] you because the soul lives on when your
[13:59] body rocks in the grave right and your
[14:02] spirit goes back to God who gave it amen
[14:06] mhm now but the soul lives on what we
[14:09] went through there Sunday the soul is
[14:11] what's going to have to be judged amen
[14:13] the white thr own judgment right sure
[14:16] they'll be back there in their bodies
[14:18] and things because that's
[14:20] necessary but the soul is what the Bible
[14:22] said the soul that sinth y it shall die
[14:26] right amen Bible says don't Fe fear them
[14:29] that can destroy these bodies and things
[14:31] but fear him that can destroy the soul
[14:34] because only God can destroy a
[14:37] soul and we'll read in a minute where
[14:39] only God can create a
[14:41] soul Satan can't create that's where we
[14:44] took what man has said and just listened
[14:47] to it and then got it all mixed up in
[14:49] our minds and Tangled Up in our thoughts
[14:51] until we can't come out with a Clarity
[14:53] of even
[14:56] thinking brother I've always this this
[14:59] that you you just sin well then you're
[15:03] lost right right
[15:06] exactly you need to be an alter Amen to
[15:09] get something
[15:11] straight why because we got the Bible we
[15:13] got the prophet's
[15:14] message and we don't have to worry about
[15:16] what's going on we have the answer
[15:19] right we have the prophet said Satan's
[15:21] answer yes sir what the revealed word
[15:24] amen right that's the answer to all
[15:27] things is the revealed word see but you
[15:29] say what but Brother D it takes Body
[15:33] Spirit and soul to make
[15:34] me that's that's
[15:37] right it
[15:42] does but let's do what the scripture
[15:44] says go ahead and let's get started with
[15:45] a few
[15:47] quotes let's go ahead and bring up
[15:49] number
[15:50] one look what the scripture says the
[15:53] scripture says in Hebrews 4:12 for the
[15:56] word of God is quick and powerful and
[15:58] sharp than a two-edged sword piercing
[16:01] even to the dividing and Sun of Soul and
[16:04] Spirit that's
[16:05] correct and other joints and Myers and a
[16:08] discerner of the thoughts is a discerner
[16:10] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[16:13] how much greater could that
[16:15] be the word of God will divide see we
[16:18] couldn't divide it no even though
[16:21] Scofield the writers and things will
[16:22] cover Body Spirit and soul
[16:26] right but you'll find most of them say
[16:28] saying Body Soul
[16:31] spirit all right brother Rand went with
[16:34] that until the late later part of his
[16:35] ministry and then you'll see him change
[16:37] over to Body Spirit and soul because he
[16:40] seen the real soul and what it was when
[16:43] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[16:44] didn't see
[16:45] spirits right he's so Soul under the
[16:48] altar
[16:50] M but you see we get so
[16:54] revelated until somebody says something
[16:56] my computers
[16:57] go we come up with quotes you
[17:00] know see brother random didn't have to
[17:03] straighten out anything on when he was
[17:06] saying Body Soul and Spirit that's right
[17:09] making his Spirit to Center him and then
[17:11] come later and say Body Spirit and soul
[17:14] because he never changed the senses
[17:16] right of any of those three right he
[17:19] always gave the outside whatever you
[17:21] want to call it five senses C SPI smell
[17:24] here gave the second real memory reason
[17:26] conscious affection Love Etc
[17:29] the soul was only one sense either Faith
[17:32] or not or The
[17:34] Sinner you see as the word begin to
[17:36] unfold unto
[17:38] him he could
[17:40] see what a real man is yeah right as we
[17:44] covered in the fourth seal that only the
[17:46] prophet would know what the word death
[17:48] would
[17:49] mean so we see it under the fifth seal
[17:52] that only the prophet would know what
[17:54] life is
[17:57] amen you remember when when he went to
[17:59] those the guys they put the things on
[18:01] him you know M testing him for something
[18:04] and they said it's amazing said your
[18:08] conscious and subconscious right
[18:09] together that you could dream a dream
[18:13] and be wide
[18:14] awake well then he began to explain
[18:17] right and I'm sure they sat there in
[18:20] amazement yeah right your seventh grade
[18:23] education man explain what they' studied
[18:26] all of their life to try to figure out
[18:28] right but yet put it in so small a terms
[18:31] or you know so perfect until they can
[18:34] understand that he knew what he was
[18:36] talking about oh yeah see so the
[18:38] scripture
[18:42] says that we can divide between we can
[18:45] show the difference
[18:47] between as I said see he said but why do
[18:51] we need to know that well then which one
[18:52] sins
[18:53] right
[18:55] correct is it's the body it's the spirit
[18:58] it's the soul
[19:01] all right so look what he
[19:05] says on 1 a go ahead
[19:08] brother I had to add a lot to these
[19:12] cuz studying it and then give thought
[19:15] and then run back and I wrote the notes
[19:17] for this and three times I
[19:19] think but listen to what he
[19:22] says Hebrews chapter 6 book two or part
[19:26] two 262
[19:30] now we got that this morning how that we
[19:32] are
[19:34] perfected perfected
[19:36] absolutely spotless and blindess not one
[19:40] sin on us
[19:42] amen are you above Temptation
[19:46] never do you sin every day yes
[19:53] sir but yet we are perfected because we
[19:56] are in him and God can no more judge us
[19:59] than nothing right couldn't be righteous
[20:03] he's already judged Us in him when he
[20:06] judged
[20:08] Christ he judged me and he judged you
[20:11] and he can't judge you can't judge me
[20:14] again because he took my judgment
[20:17] amen if I've been redeemed right
[20:21] amen if the soul of the individual is
[20:24] redeemed that Soul cannot sin right but
[20:27] if it did it' be destroyed
[20:29] amen the soul that sinth it shall
[20:33] die but you see then we look at it and
[20:36] we see ourselves and and we see what's
[20:38] doing
[20:42] it we can't help we're in a world we
[20:45] have to eat we have to sleep we have to
[20:47] do that's right and the new birth didn't
[20:50] take away your caste feel smelling here
[20:53] no
[20:56] right said I used to love the honey he
[20:58] said I still love to hunt M amen all
[21:02] right but see then your memory reasoning
[21:04] conscious and thing is not born again
[21:07] right I wish it was amen man said when
[21:10] time we need a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:12] in the brain I I amen him but we need it
[21:15] I just don't believe we can get it yeah
[21:17] right that's a different story but what
[21:20] he said I amen cuz I believe we need a
[21:23] good brain if anything we can get we
[21:25] need a brain transplant right yeah
[21:30] but see that don't work just because you
[21:33] got born again didn't do away with your
[21:37] memory that's right
[21:41] right you then you still do wrong with
[21:43] that part all right but now think about
[21:48] it as a Christian when you do
[21:51] wrong what is the part of you that's
[21:53] doing wrong so if we don't divide
[21:55] between them then we don't know what
[21:57] we're doing that's right so that's just
[21:58] putting it on Plain language all
[22:03] right see I want to know the
[22:06] truth that's right right right cuz the
[22:09] truth should set you
[22:11] free all right now whether it sets you
[22:13] free or
[22:15] not he really done a great thing to help
[22:17] me to see what part of me is what I
[22:22] am you know the real
[22:26] me because that way I can see what's
[22:29] going
[22:32] on and then if I have a dirty
[22:35] thought brother I don't never have no
[22:37] dirty thoughts you're a liar right solve
[22:40] the problem you're lied that's
[22:43] right Jesus had dirty
[22:47] thoughts but he didn't entertain
[22:49] them he was tempted in all points as we
[22:52] are yet without sin if you don't
[22:54] entertain the thought as your old saying
[22:56] goes you can't help the bird flying over
[22:58] your
[22:59] head but you can keep it from building a
[23:01] nest in Your Heart
[23:04] Right a thought comes to you you can't
[23:06] help a thought coming to you right
[23:08] correct you know that's
[23:11] right when you go out there now you have
[23:14] to look up all the time you know what
[23:16] women would do they get up on the top
[23:18] look down on you so that's all the
[23:20] problem come on and women just as mad so
[23:24] all right I'm W to find out how to be
[23:28] red
[23:28] amen
[23:30] amen well I just got the new bird well
[23:33] Glory
[23:35] Hallelujah there's a lot left in
[23:38] her you just started your journey
[23:41] right that's
[23:43] right see then to see what's going on
[23:46] then I can find the day that I'm living
[23:49] in and find the truth right so the fifth
[23:52] seal to me is the greatest understanding
[23:55] of what a real true person is
[23:59] because these
[24:02] people they still have memory reason
[24:05] conscience Etc right they still desire
[24:08] Revenge yep we know it's not the
[24:12] bride but they still have those things
[24:15] work Souls right
[24:23] Souls but you see we just get a thought
[24:26] in our mind and we conop an
[24:29] idea and we say well this is the way it
[24:31] is it's all right if that's the way it
[24:34] is right but if it's not that way what
[24:37] have we done amen
[24:39] right we didn't understand anything
[24:42] about a b a human being until the
[24:45] prophet begin to teach us right no
[24:47] that's right but now we're beginning to
[24:51] understand and it's out throughout of
[24:53] the word I mean throughout the
[24:56] word but yet there was covering our
[25:00] Sunday David said my soul my soul First
[25:04] Act
[25:05] thee brother said you can be anointing
[25:08] in that Spirit right and even love God
[25:12] that's right anointed on your spirit and
[25:15] even love God about and die and go to
[25:21] hell but he said if that
[25:24] soul is the part that God solds in
[25:27] prison
[25:28] that God is trying to work
[25:33] on the Statue of a perfect man is not
[25:35] buil in your body It Is manifested by
[25:38] your body amen it's not built through
[25:40] your memory reason conscious affection
[25:43] through your second
[25:44] realm it's in the middle part of you the
[25:47] man the real
[25:52] you see then in that we can come down
[25:54] and understand why the prophet would be
[25:57] saying and trying to help us to
[26:01] understand
[26:02] right now I keep putting these back on
[26:05] you may get tired of me rereading but
[26:07] remember we're speaking out to an
[26:09] internet World also right but it might
[26:12] not be the internet I'm trying to read
[26:13] these in might be you amen if you think
[26:17] you don't need it then you are the one
[26:18] I'm talking about is that sensible right
[26:22] that's right there's no need of playing
[26:24] games that's right so let's see what the
[26:28] Prophet who is
[26:33] these The Souls of
[26:35] them I want you to notice this part but
[26:38] we'll get back into it in a
[26:40] minute brother Ram uses Souls under the
[26:43] altar 40 something
[26:47] times 18 times after he went beyond the
[26:51] curtain of time
[26:59] just because he said Souls under the
[27:04] altar he says the scripture says
[27:08] it there's no scripture says Souls under
[27:10] the altar
[27:16] right the Bible is saying that but
[27:18] there's no scriptural
[27:23] words it says Souls of them right yeah
[27:28] but brother Ram can use that for the
[27:30] Bride of sold under the
[27:32] altar
[27:38] sure no problem with
[27:43] him why because it's not getting
[27:46] confused with the fifth seal
[27:49] right it's sold under the altar what do
[27:51] you think the briide of Jesus Christ is
[27:53] right now amen sure
[27:56] right we good to the minute where
[27:58] brother R said he referred to
[28:02] this
[28:05] scripture who he the angel of the Lord
[28:07] that was with him beyond the curtain of
[28:08] time
[28:12] right so this because you read Souls
[28:14] under the altar is not always talking
[28:16] about fif seal Jew that's
[28:21] right cuz it doesn't say Souls under the
[28:26] altar right it says it right right
[28:32] because these souls are under the altar
[28:35] but they're not under the altar
[28:39] of Jesus
[28:42] Christ they're not the martyrs of the
[28:45] early church
[28:48] ages that the Israel to be saved as a
[28:51] nation
[28:53] amen we didn't even know that was in
[28:55] there at all did
[28:56] we until the Prophet came along and said
[28:59] it but then we can go into Paul and read
[29:01] it could we amen look what he saids on
[29:03] the fifth
[29:07] seal and this time if you notice this
[29:09] feel still being open the church is gone
[29:11] it just can't be to sold under the the
[29:13] early church and now please if you ever
[29:16] did give this attention now cuz this is
[29:18] a great controversy so I want you to
[29:20] listen real close you got your papers
[29:23] and things and write with and I want you
[29:25] to notice now these cannot be Souls
[29:28] under the altar because Souls of the of
[29:30] the righteous martyred and the righteous
[29:33] people the church the Bride As done been
[29:37] took up so they wouldn't be under the
[29:39] altar they'd be in glory with the rde
[29:42] right see we're under the altar of God
[29:46] until the Rapture if you
[29:49] die you go under the altar beyond the
[29:52] curtain of time right throw under the
[29:56] altar in the Z
[29:58] Dimension all right
[30:01] now see theyve being low that gone in
[30:04] Rapture the fourth chapter why are these
[30:06] Soul then that's the next thing who are
[30:09] are they then if they are not their
[30:11] early church this is Israel that's to be
[30:13] saved as a nation all of them that are
[30:16] predestinated that's Israel that's
[30:19] Israel right not every Israelite we've
[30:21] been through that the predestinated only
[30:23] those whose names remain on The Book of
[30:27] Life amen all right
[30:32] now then just think about
[30:36] it how did he get to
[30:39] her now I'm just not playing by
[30:42] rereading I'm trying to drive down into
[30:44] your
[30:46] thinking I I like to preach that way I I
[30:49] like to talk to the real youth I hate
[30:52] talking to bodies
[30:56] right I mean you can and I look at me
[30:58] and
[31:00] green and be be totally indifference of
[31:04] agreement
[31:07] right I me you
[31:11] yep I've talk to preachers like that it
[31:15] didn't make no difference what I
[31:18] said they wouldn't agree with
[31:21] nothing but see if I can talk to that
[31:24] inward part of you amen amen that's
[31:26] right one of two things is going to
[31:29] happen yep one you're going to get mad
[31:32] as a hornet and get up and
[31:36] leave or two you're going to search out
[31:40] whether you're born again or not and see
[31:41] whether the truth is right or not that's
[31:43] right cuz I'm talking to the real you I
[31:45] ain't talking to the bodies I look at
[31:47] right the bodies I look at are very
[31:50] deceptive
[31:53] right but if the word is correct that we
[31:56] read at the beginning
[31:58] of Hebrews
[32:00] 4:12 was it only for the prophet that it
[32:03] could discern
[32:04] between or was it for all of the Bride
[32:07] of Jesus Christ amen that that word is
[32:10] to discern the difference between our
[32:11] soul and our spirit
[32:14] right and expose us we certainly don't
[32:18] want to be as the one we were referring
[32:19] to the other day of the lady that after
[32:21] all of her life teaching Sunday school
[32:23] Etc you remember she come up to the time
[32:25] she's dying right you remember she
[32:27] called a preacher said you've lied to me
[32:29] he said give her another
[32:31] hpo instead of trying to convert her to
[32:34] get her to be saved or even pray whether
[32:35] he want to why cuz she was exposing him
[32:40] amen you know what brother R said her
[32:43] real Soul come up before her and she
[32:46] realized she was lost
[32:50] amen
[32:53] right but not David a man without the
[32:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:59] right his soul longed after
[33:02] God why wasn't any
[33:05] mortal why does a heater and a hot and
[33:08] toter anywhere you want to be why is he
[33:10] worshiping the Sun the moon the stars
[33:13] the animals trees and things
[33:17] right CU he's got a soul right oh yeah
[33:21] that's right he don't have a
[33:23] soul a soul is what he is right am
[33:29] what I told you years ago when they had
[33:30] all that two Soviet this going on and I
[33:33] started preaching
[33:35] about that God was a soul
[33:39] amen boy I got a lot of difference in
[33:43] that but I still stand with it
[33:48] amen the prophet said he sent back his
[33:50] soul on the de Pentecost in the form of
[33:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:56] amen why was it in the Old Testament
[33:58] they couldn't get born again
[34:01] yep they could be anointed on their
[34:04] Spirit right right right with a genuine
[34:07] holy
[34:11] spirit because there was nothing to get
[34:13] into their soul because the animal
[34:15] didn't have a soul
[34:17] right
[34:19] amen there was no life back there that
[34:21] could come into the individual right and
[34:24] convert that Soul that's right right
[34:28] see that was what the two Soul people
[34:30] said said Satan gave you a soul and God
[34:32] gave you one that would make him a
[34:33] Creator and Satan can't create how many
[34:35] quotes you want I was looking last night
[34:37] at or not before last one one
[34:40] morning it's 40 or 50 times that brother
[34:43] R says Satan cannot create yep
[34:46] right amen but yet people will still
[34:49] quote
[34:50] that that Satan gave you a soul he
[34:53] perverted the nature of your soul right
[34:58] when he come in the garden there Adam
[35:00] and Eve was perfect and right amen
[35:03] right he attacked that to
[35:05] pervert that's right then when
[35:07] everything it was born from that time on
[35:10] was perverted that's right yep that's
[35:13] why we need a new birth I believe am
[35:15] that's
[35:17] right not to change a Doctrine you
[35:20] believe a different Doctrine or believe
[35:22] the prophet
[35:24] amen but if you're not born again it
[35:26] won't do you any good no
[35:30] the prophet said the baptism of the Holy
[35:32] Ghost was the most important thing in
[35:34] your life that's right amen
[35:37] amen I got it brother Dale I just don't
[35:40] agree with you on what
[35:43] you all right unless I'm right right
[35:48] that's right that's true that's right if
[35:52] I'm right you show me where you got a
[35:54] right to differ with
[35:56] me you might may not like my
[35:59] presentation you
[36:02] know but what's the difference in the
[36:04] word right a dumb donkey preached A good
[36:08] sermon one day right amen that's right
[36:13] right but listen
[36:15] Church the soul is the real
[36:22] you so these Souls of them that were
[36:25] slain
[36:28] they're there mhm waiting for that
[36:31] 144,000 to be killed
[36:35] yep and they're given white robe
[36:37] somewhere prior to the death of
[36:41] 144,000 that's what we just read in the
[36:43] Bible
[36:46] amen he said where did they get it I
[36:49] told you I don't believe you can put the
[36:52] phal Jew at the white Throne
[36:54] no well brother there that's where I v I
[36:57] did well I've always believe I always
[36:59] believe the white Throne is where they
[37:00] got the white robes right according to
[37:03] the Bible right no right not right amen
[37:07] that's right and you show me in where in
[37:09] the prophet's
[37:10] message that he puts the philal Jew at
[37:14] the white
[37:16] Dr
[37:17] right well I don't care I still believe
[37:20] it that's that's what I
[37:23] mean see it's because of what you've
[37:25] been taught amen amen
[37:28] there's one thing about it I'm glad to
[37:30] always say hey I was wrong come on
[37:33] that's
[37:35] right I was wrong on that FAL youw but I
[37:39] believe they had to go to the white
[37:40] Throne to get eternal
[37:46] life right and if they do have eternal
[37:49] life how are you going to put them at
[37:51] life from
[37:54] no if they get eternal life prior to the
[37:57] White

[38:00] into the white Throne of eternal
[38:02] life come
[38:06] on I don't like you cuz you don't leave
[38:08] me no leway
[38:11] amen I got a right to think
[38:14] Constitution mhm yeah Bible
[38:18] no that's right Bible don't give us
[38:20] right to think at all that's right
[38:22] righten but
[38:25] listen he said that these still seal Jew
[38:29] was sold under the
[38:31] altar after the
[38:34] church was done
[38:38] gone
[38:40] Souls under the altar y go ahead to the
[38:43] next
[38:45] brother one
[38:50] see the F seal paragraph 252 and
[38:55] 253 yes they held for the word of God
[38:58] they were Jews they had their law they
[39:00] stayed with it you remember last night
[39:02] now they stayed with that they were Jews
[39:04] and had the law and the law was the word
[39:06] of God they stayed right by it that's
[39:09] right and for the testimony they held
[39:11] they were martyred and here was sold
[39:14] under the altar after the church had
[39:16] been gone and watch they had in their
[39:20] blindness Marty to Messiah and now they
[39:23] were reaping for it they realized it
[39:25] they recognized after it was gone on
[39:28] they seem then when they come before the
[39:30] altar of
[39:31] God
[39:33] what right when they come before that
[39:37] altar but now the grace of God is to
[39:43] them they get white robes MH
[39:47] right
[39:50] right it's given unto
[39:52] them didn't say anything about they
[39:55] deserved them earned them or anything
[39:57] fact didn't want
[39:59] them that blown enough they didn't want
[40:01] them they don't want Jesus
[40:03] Christ we know what it is once been
[40:05] killed down to the time of Hitler and
[40:08] heightman brother said those killed from
[40:11] the cross until the going up to the
[40:13] church that's the phal Jew not every Jew
[40:16] he said we done been through that now
[40:22] listen when they come before the altar
[40:24] of God
[40:27] but now the grace of God is to them now
[40:29] watch now they could not by no means be
[40:34] Saints because they would already be
[40:36] robed y we get our here right the new
[40:39] birth right but here they are now just
[40:42] sold Under The Altar for the word of God
[40:45] and the testimony the hell are being
[40:47] God's people the Jews but now watch the
[40:51] grace of God comes to them and Jesus
[40:54] gives them each one a white robe
[40:57] watch come over after the church is
[41:01] gone and that's what I was saying the
[41:03] other day see when they got killed
[41:07] there thousand years ago that didn't
[41:10] give them white
[41:12] robes that put them where they were
[41:15] at one day they'll be given white
[41:18] ropes we get down to it where brother R
[41:21] said they got it under the seventh
[41:22] seal all right because they were loyal
[41:25] to their cause and they were blind
[41:28] they didn't know it they didn't know it
[41:29] they were playing exactly the part that
[41:31] God had ordained for them to play and
[41:34] here here John looks over and sees see
[41:36] Souls Under The Altar and watch he sees
[41:39] those Souls watch what he calls them
[41:41] they cry how long
[41:43] now read your
[41:47] scripture and they cried with a loud
[41:50] voice saying how long oh Lord right now
[41:55] to avenge
[41:57] you see the bride can cry how long
[42:00] MH
[42:02] sure we'll get to that in a few minutes
[42:05] the Bri could cry along that doesn't put
[42:07] them in the fifth
[42:08] seal there is no scripture that says
[42:11] Souls under the altar the blood R cover
[42:13] sold under the altar if he'll sealed
[42:20] you it said sold of them
[42:28] but you follow me that somewhere they're
[42:30] going to get eternal
[42:32] life right and when they
[42:39] do y I tell you what when you give that
[42:43] F sealed you eternal life he will no
[42:46] longer want
[42:49] revenge
[42:52] amen nobody that's got the baptism of
[42:54] the Holy Ghost Wants Revenge that's
[42:56] right
[42:57] M we turn the other
[43:02] cheek we don't want revenge right we
[43:05] want to pray for people
[43:08] amen not
[43:10] Revenge all right so the F seal shows
[43:13] The
[43:14] Souls of them and the prophet will call
[43:17] them Souls Under The
[43:19] Altar and they have their feelings or
[43:21] beings or
[43:24] things they're in a what
[43:28] they're in a
[43:30] body they're in a Celestial body
[43:33] theophany what else you going to put
[43:35] them
[43:38] in but you see we never considered
[43:41] Redemption for the Jew that's where our
[43:42] trouble is today to try to believe it
[43:45] I'm talking about a fth seal Jew of
[43:47] people that rejected Jesus Christ we
[43:49] would never Tau that it's not in any of
[43:52] our teachings of organized religion no
[43:54] we talked about 144,000 we had that
[43:57] confused to saying it was a
[44:04] bride the church what is a real
[44:07] Soul that's
[44:10] right what about a soul being so
[44:14] important until God
[44:17] himself came
[44:19] down and took upon flesh right to yield
[44:24] his soul up right y that it could save
[44:27] that person amen that's right I thought
[44:30] we just got the baptism of the Holy
[44:31] Spirit now where' you get the thought
[44:33] from you got it from a denomination of
[44:35] Pentecostal idea
[44:42] yeah the soul is a real you amen MH
[44:49] right that's where I used to think
[44:51] beyond the curtain of time and all I I
[44:52] didn't read all of that and understand
[44:54] even though I read it and I thought the
[44:56] soul would not have any sense in
[44:59] it but I had to correct
[45:03] that CU you Prophet when he got there
[45:05] and seen those Souls under the
[45:07] altar they had their sense of feeling
[45:11] talking right all kind of
[45:15] things see we better correct as he
[45:17] preaches it brings it to us
[45:20] right that many preachers going to get
[45:22] up and tell you I wrong here right
[45:24] no all right now let's get into the
[45:26] thought
[45:28] that was page
[45:29] one let's go to number two we using 1 2
[45:34] 3 we brought this out the other day but
[45:37] I want you to think about
[45:43] it message called Faith
[45:47] 61813 paragraph
[45:51] 5 when you die your soul will go into
[45:54] the under the altar of God
[45:57] m not in see right in the presence of
[46:01] God cuz it doesn't go up right in see
[46:06] not in it don't go right you remember
[46:08] brother Brandon right I want to see
[46:10] Jesus he's higher right right that can
[46:13] be called the presence of God no
[46:17] problem but when you die you don't go
[46:19] right into the presence of God you go
[46:21] under the
[46:25] altar what a great Christ to be amen now
[46:28] your spirit will go to God but you
[46:30] cannot come back you remember in the
[46:32] Bible it said the spirit the Soul's
[46:34] under the altar crying Lord how long how
[46:36] long they could not return until the
[46:38] scriptures fulfilled and like Christ
[46:41] could not return until the scriptures
[46:42] fulfilled then after the all has been
[46:45] done all their sufferings over and the
[46:48] Brethren has suffered the same thing
[46:52] where we suffered like they suffered and
[46:54] so forth then on that day you'll know
[46:57] exactly where you you're buried your
[47:00] spirit will be turned loose from God and
[47:03] will come to the
[47:07] soul now the soul is that part of you
[47:11] who knows and understands your
[47:14] intelligence right amen you remember the
[47:17] vision Now where's he going beyond the
[47:19] curtain of time right y you remember the
[47:22] vision I had not long ago or the little
[47:25] translation and went into that place and
[47:27] saw those people now your spirit will
[47:29] come back to that body and that that
[47:32] kind of a body the soul which is a body
[47:36] that does not have to eat and so forth
[47:37] is the there the Tabernacle be
[47:40] dissolved right you talk a Celestial
[47:43] body we have one already waiting a
[47:46] Celestial body and that spirit and that
[47:49] soul and Celestial body you rise up
[47:51] again this Natural Body by that great
[47:54] Millennium now think about it
[47:59] the soul is a real you
[48:04] amen that's what God is trying to
[48:08] save is the
[48:12] soul because if the soul can be saved
[48:15] the body and spirit will have to follow
[48:17] that's right amen and we got a lot of
[48:19] people that are in church because of Mom
[48:23] and Daddy somebody telling them are
[48:26] scaring
[48:29] I always told you don't try to scare
[48:30] your kids with a go that God don't like
[48:33] you get them a
[48:38] weapon they'll find out God loves them
[48:41] but you might not like
[48:43] them that's what you're afraid
[48:46] of see you use a crutch of something and
[48:50] try to tell them God don't like for you
[48:52] to do
[48:53] that you're trying to scare them right
[48:57] right brother said don't go down there
[48:59] and tell that person you need to come to
[49:01] the altar he said you'll make them a two
[49:05] full child of hell you need that
[49:08] quote going to be harder to try to be
[49:10] saved after then why because you've
[49:12] embarassed
[49:14] them I've been there done
[49:17] that had them to come and talk to
[49:20] me try to get me to come to
[49:22] church I told them I lived a better life
[49:25] and their Deacon board did and I
[49:27] certainly didn't want nobody to question
[49:28] me because i' rolled it out in front of
[49:32] them I had to get over the church to be
[49:35] able to get
[49:36] saved
[49:38] right the good religious people don't
[49:43] you want them saved brother
[49:45] T right go down there and get them and
[49:47] lead them up to the
[49:51] altar
[49:54] no it looks good don't it
[49:58] H now I'm not your Prophet so you argue
[50:01] with him he said it'd be harder to get
[50:03] him the alter than next time that's
[50:05] right right that's
[50:08] right now you can go toe and try to
[50:11] scare hell out of them all you want to
[50:13] it ain't going to
[50:20] work but that body that
[50:23] soul is that celestial
[50:26] all right go ahead and pull up the
[50:27] scripture we'll cover this while we at
[50:30] it second Corinthians
[50:33] 5 for we know that our Earth if our
[50:36] Earthly House of this Tabernacle now I
[50:38] looked up the word house I'm trying to
[50:40] cover it in many ways to make sure to to
[50:44] get an understanding or a better way of
[50:46] saying it and really the more it leans
[50:49] back to saying we know if our Earthly
[50:51] tent tent
[50:53] right tent y body
[50:58] see Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[51:00] were
[51:03] dissolved this part
[51:06] here the tent you live
[51:10] in what does it say we have a building
[51:12] of God and
[51:15] house not made with hands Eternal to
[51:18] heaven now why is he emphasizing
[51:23] that you going to have to think with a
[51:25] little bit we explain caral I guess but
[51:27] you know Mom and Daddy formed
[51:31] us do I need to go into any more of that
[51:34] language to get to you through
[51:36] intercourse they brought us into
[51:39] being y they framed
[51:44] us not made with hands is going into
[51:48] heaven not made by anything that we do
[51:51] on Earth to bring children you know
[51:56] see cuz the other is got to be in
[52:01] heaven Eternal in the heavens right but
[52:05] see that's where everybody does it they
[52:06] say see there we got we had eternal life
[52:09] always have had eternal life we don't
[52:11] need to be saved now show me where the
[52:13] Prophet said
[52:14] that I want to quote just
[52:18] one where the Prophet said you didn't
[52:20] need to be
[52:24] saved but that's why people preach
[52:29] right for in this we
[52:32] grown this
[52:34] body earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[52:37] upon with our house which is from
[52:39] Heaven if so be that being clothed we
[52:42] shall not be found naked for we know
[52:46] that for we that are in this Tabernacle
[52:50] new Grown being
[52:52] burden not far that we would be
[52:55] unclothed but clothed upon y that mortal
[52:59] might be swallowed up of life
[53:03] amen you said but it says we have
[53:05] eternal
[53:08] life God before the world yep in his
[53:12] mind knows he will have eternal life and
[53:14] he won't that's right he doesn't have
[53:16] any problems with it
[53:19] right but I thought we had to receive
[53:22] eternal
[53:23] life
[53:25] amen I've never understood anything else
[53:28] amen than the fact that we must be born
[53:30] again amen because if not then Jesus
[53:33] would have said to Nicodemus he said
[53:35] Nicodemus what you need to realize is
[53:36] you always was eternal yeah
[53:42] right you see that's where the people of
[53:44] this message are trying to bypass the
[53:46] new
[53:48] birth right do away with the new birth
[53:56] always was eternal always was eternal I
[53:58] don't need Jesus what did he die
[54:03] for
[54:05] right don't you see that what Paul is
[54:09] saying that we have one Eternal in the
[54:12] heavens right is the positive of God's
[54:18] mind about us
[54:22] right that before the foundation of the
[54:25] world
[54:27] he could look down through time and see
[54:29] every person that would ever be saved
[54:34] amen and you can write your name y in
[54:37] the Lamb's Book of
[54:40] Life before you ever got
[54:43] here but does that do away with us
[54:45] coming here and receiving it
[54:49] no what Mortal being would have any
[54:52] thoughts of that idea that's right
[54:57] What Mortal human being could ever think
[54:59] of the fact of being as Eternal as God
[55:05] is without receiving his life
[55:09] right without an
[55:11] impartation without a
[55:14] Calvary
[55:19] right God could anoint those people in
[55:22] the Old Testament do great works sure
[55:28] but he couldn't bring eternal
[55:33] life but on the day of Pentecost he
[55:36] brought him eternal life am
[55:40] right only
[55:44] those whose names were
[55:47] written in the lounge Book of Life The
[55:50] Eternal section right receive the new
[55:52] birth on the day of Pentecost
[55:55] right yep
[55:58] I thought we believe the Bible that said
[55:59] in the last days he pour out his Spirit
[56:01] upon All
[56:02] Flesh does that mean all flesh is
[56:08] saved the Bible says
[56:11] that see it can anoint you all of your
[56:14] life and you die and go to hell right
[56:18] right if you're born
[56:20] again I don't get nothing out of these
[56:22] parts to you I want you to understand
[56:24] that Hallelujah I'm one person that
[56:27] believes you must receive eternal life
[56:31] in your soul to have it
[56:33] right and to do that in this day you
[56:36] must go through justification
[56:39] sanctification and the baptism of the
[56:41] Holy
[56:43] Ghost not just walk up and Shake
[56:49] Hands R said very few people would
[56:52] believe all the way right unto receiving
[56:55] the baptism is the Holy Ghost
[57:00] right why because they're not taught
[57:02] correctly
[57:04] amen I went off the internet the other
[57:06] day and a brother was talking about how
[57:08] knew now what the new birth
[57:12] is he said don't quit preaching keep on
[57:14] going right that's right he said I seen
[57:18] because I've never been Tau
[57:21] hallelujah thank you Father how can you
[57:24] get something that you're not taught
[57:25] about no
[57:31] home eternal life
[57:37] yes he said but yet it says
[57:40] there pull that back up
[57:44] brother it says there that we have one
[57:46] Eternal in the heavens
[57:52] sure I'm certainly not an English major
[57:55] and
[57:56] people around the world are having
[57:57] trouble interpreting what I say you know
[58:00] my old country flly and I'm sorry I just
[58:04] didn't get no
[58:06] education I was out digging ters and
[58:08] playing a mu when I was 7 years
[58:12] old trying to make a
[58:16] living God blessed us right but
[58:21] look read
[58:23] it we got a school teacher said back
[58:27] here she's not too good on English
[58:29] either ask my
[58:33] daughter but listen far we know where
[58:39] that okay far we know mhm that if right
[58:46] man that means you don't have it why
[58:50] would be if
[58:53] right no not to say before we know what
[58:56] we have right Watch what it says for we
[58:59] know that if question our Earthly House
[59:03] of
[59:04] this Tabernacle were
[59:08] y now is were that's pist tense word
[59:12] right right
[59:22] right we
[59:24] isolved we
[59:27] have a building of God in a house not
[59:29] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[59:32] that's right mhm when you come to Earth
[59:35] and received eternal life that if and
[59:38] were passed away
[59:40] right and you now have eternal life
[59:44] amen and
[59:49] as Faith at the bottom of the pyramid is
[59:52] a new
[59:54] birth which your soul is not complete no
[59:58] right it only has the earnest
[1:00:00] but and love which is The
[1:00:03] Headstone is a
[1:00:06] positive amen the bottom is a negative
[1:00:09] and the top is the positive partial or
[1:00:11] perfect if you don't work like the word
[1:00:13] negative and
[1:00:16] positive partial and
[1:00:19] perfect so if I
[1:00:24] die the Split Second I die I step right
[1:00:31] into that being that I am
[1:00:34] right that is found me here right amen
[1:00:38] right that's right now I'm done I'm not
[1:00:40] going to get to it to the light but
[1:00:42] that's why I
[1:00:43] believe page 80 of the Hebrew Book when
[1:00:47] the prophet of God says your soul is
[1:00:49] your theophany right amen if you'll
[1:00:52] notice Sunday all the way through I was
[1:00:55] only speaking of a soul not speaking of
[1:00:57] whether it was born again or not using
[1:01:00] the prophet to show you what happens
[1:01:01] when it's born again a
[1:01:08] sinner a sinner yep when he dies y sure
[1:01:13] when his Earthly House of his Tabernacle
[1:01:17] is dissolved he has one true yep but
[1:01:21] it's not Eternal right amen right that's
[1:01:24] right what his soul is he has a
[1:01:27] terrestrial I mean a Celestial body a
[1:01:31] soul and can even be called a theoy
[1:01:34] brother around used it
[1:01:41] right because theop means a body of a
[1:01:45] deity
[1:01:49] right and if your soul is born
[1:01:53] again that's right deity lives in
[1:01:57] you
[1:01:58] am right
[1:02:03] right your soul then is
[1:02:06] the place position or whatever you'll
[1:02:08] call it for that God to live in that's
[1:02:11] right Amen brother R said it's you and
[1:02:14] him together and our as persons right
[1:02:17] amen that's what he
[1:02:20] says I thought that throw me out and put
[1:02:22] him in where'd you get that you got that
[1:02:25] from the two whole idea
[1:02:29] right I done live down to all of it I
[1:02:32] knew the
[1:02:33] man and knew his
[1:02:35] Doctrine that's where you got the idea
[1:02:39] from that thing's all over the world
[1:02:43] then there's no difference in two souls
[1:02:44] or two Lords
[1:02:49] right cuz if you got two Souls you got
[1:02:51] to have two Lords mhm that's
[1:02:54] right you're Soul before you're born
[1:02:57] again is the habitational place of your
[1:03:02] deity which is the
[1:03:04] devil thank
[1:03:06] you thank you thank you before you're
[1:03:09] born again
[1:03:11] right he's your God Amen yep you're the
[1:03:15] body he inhabits
[1:03:20] right but then when you get born
[1:03:23] again amen
[1:03:26] when you get born
[1:03:30] again your
[1:03:32] soul is then your
[1:03:35] theophany don't worry about that I've
[1:03:37] taught that 40
[1:03:42] years I'd like for you show me something
[1:03:46] different yeah but Brother D the no
[1:03:49] that's what I mean you going to get your
[1:03:50] definition
[1:03:57] instead of saying the soul is the real
[1:03:58] you whether you're saved or
[1:04:02] lost and while you was lost you had a
[1:04:06] God but his name was Satan
[1:04:12] right did not Jesus say the unclean
[1:04:14] Spirit goeth out of a man y
[1:04:19] right who was Jesus talking
[1:04:23] to right when when he said
[1:04:27] Satan get behind me come on that's
[1:04:35] right who was he talking to when he said
[1:04:38] you are of your father right the devil
[1:04:44] right see what Satan done he perverted
[1:04:47] the nature of your soul your soul I
[1:04:49] preached on this for 40
[1:04:51] years your soul is created of God we'll
[1:04:55] get to it in a
[1:04:56] All Souls are created of God Satan can't
[1:04:59] create but when that Soul comes in there
[1:05:02] God can't create a soul imperfect amen
[1:05:05] now I didn't use the word Eternal I used
[1:05:07] the word
[1:05:08] perfect when your soul is created a
[1:05:11] little baby is
[1:05:12] perfect that's right his soul is
[1:05:16] perfect but he looks up in the hospital
[1:05:19] room and he can't understand what's
[1:05:21] going
[1:05:22] on and he hears a NES talking about here
[1:05:25] it is the full moon and look at the
[1:05:27] blanketly blanket all these kids are
[1:05:29] coming into the
[1:05:30] world first little thing that little
[1:05:32] person hears
[1:05:34] is bad
[1:05:36] language Satan perverts
[1:05:42] you makes your soul a nature of the
[1:05:45] devil
[1:05:47] right why wouldn't your body died your
[1:05:49] spirit didn't die your soul didn't die
[1:05:52] was the nature of your soul is what dies
[1:05:54] that Soul's in prison amen right he said
[1:05:57] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:05:59] born again said if not it's of the world
[1:06:05] M you see why we have to have eternal
[1:06:08] life that's
[1:06:12] right brother D I thought I had eternal
[1:06:14] life going to come in the message show
[1:06:16] me where the Prophet talked
[1:06:19] at you've been taught that by people
[1:06:21] that's planted these things into your
[1:06:23] mind and brother Dale's a hateful an old
[1:06:28] dude for exposing

[1:07:09] being I love people amen but I love my
[1:07:13] God

[1:07:22] nobody they got to be born again just
[1:07:25] like I I got to be born again right
[1:07:27] right they got to receive Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] just exactly like every person's ever
[1:07:31] born again is got to
[1:07:36] do but it's not in your body not in your
[1:07:39] spirit you said but brother Dale I love
[1:07:41] God said you going to love God every day
[1:07:43] your life and die and go to hell cuz you
[1:07:45] love with your spirit right come back
[1:07:49] and read the
[1:07:54] message you know but brother you yeah I
[1:07:57] know
[1:07:59] it I'm sorry not sorry for what I
[1:08:04] say but sorry for being understood
[1:08:08] misunderstood the way I try maybe to
[1:08:10] present things the brother R said if you
[1:08:13] do it too soft he said they'll think you
[1:08:15] trying to pull something over on them
[1:08:17] well you know for certain that I'm not
[1:08:19] trying to pull nothing over on
[1:08:22] you I'm a human mortal you've been out
[1:08:24] there with me we hunt together we Face
[1:08:26] together we're mortal
[1:08:29] beings but there is a God
[1:08:33] right who wants to come down and save
[1:08:36] every one of
[1:08:39] us but if we keep believing we're
[1:08:41] already Sav what can he do for us that's
[1:08:45] right but brother so and so says you
[1:08:48] Matter's where you
[1:08:50] go what does the Bible
[1:08:54] say I don't know I never read it well
[1:08:56] then you're a poor excuse of a
[1:09:01] Christian oh my that's what I told us
[1:09:05] told you before we went over y to that
[1:09:07] meeting on the Daniel 70 weeks I said if
[1:09:09] there 30 preachers there 20 of them
[1:09:11] won't even never even read a Daniel 70
[1:09:13] weeks
[1:09:14] book none of them will hardly have a
[1:09:16] drawing that R around them of the Daniel
[1:09:18] 70
[1:09:21] weeks that was exactly the way it was
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:25] but yet they could straighten us out I
[1:09:28] think it's this
[1:09:30] way didn't even
[1:09:35] drawing brother put out a big fancy
[1:09:37] drawing it's on your
[1:09:41] computer showing 69 and a half weeks and
[1:09:45] then the Rapture and then a half week
[1:09:47] over here
[1:09:50] yeah brother Aaron sent him a copy
[1:09:55] of the original 70 weeks
[1:09:58] drawing yeah his comment was I've seen
[1:10:06] it that's
[1:10:11] all now his drawing won't fit nothing
[1:10:13] but around talk that's right but yet
[1:10:17] absolutely that's his idea
[1:10:20] amen and we think the devil's not still
[1:10:23] alive MH Mery
[1:10:28] listen folks even after we're born again
[1:10:31] we got a lot of problem with the devil
[1:10:33] because all of the property you're
[1:10:35] looking at belong to
[1:10:37] him
[1:10:39] right and my memory reason conscious and
[1:10:42] affections still gives him the ability
[1:10:46] to be able to tangle me in all kind of
[1:10:49] pieces of
[1:10:51] course you're so wonderful and sweets
[1:10:53] you don't have any trouble
[1:11:04] you say brother
[1:11:06] Dale why don't you preach on this
[1:11:08] Saturday
[1:11:09] out when I try to preach on this sat y I
[1:11:12] get in
[1:11:15] trouble because I get down too
[1:11:18] hard listen Church there's no leway in
[1:11:21] this time that's right closeness
[1:11:24] horseshoes y
[1:11:26] not in the
[1:11:28] gospel don't work where Telly he's
[1:11:31] mighty good ringing them morees shoes
[1:11:33] you put one on there and he put one on
[1:11:34] top of you and then turn right around

[1:28:34] wrong th shalt not leave my soul in
[1:28:42] Hell neither suffer thy Holy One to seek
[1:28:46] corruption a lot of difference in my and
[1:28:49] th
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:52] right the Miss David got in the spirit
[1:28:55] one day and cried that out
[1:28:59] right
[1:29:02] man will not leave my soul in hell right
[1:29:05] you said well that was only prophecy of
[1:29:10] Jesus
[1:29:14] David am his soul ain't never been in
[1:29:18] hell that's right
[1:29:24] thou shallal not leave my soul in hell
[1:29:28] yes
[1:29:30] why cuz that's exactly where Jesus went
[1:29:33] when he died
[1:29:41] right are you
[1:29:45] listening when Jesus died his soul his
[1:29:50] theophany his person of his being went
[1:29:52] to hell
[1:29:55] M so that's only referring to him come
[1:29:59] on
[1:30:01] no I told he went there to pay the price
[1:30:09] MH I
[1:30:12] thought that he brought up all the Old
[1:30:14] Testament Saints right not all CU it's
[1:30:17] got to be somewh I don't understand I
[1:30:20] can't preach on it so that's all right
[1:30:22] but he brought up a lot of the Soul that
[1:30:24] were in Paradise right
[1:30:27] right and took them up open up the
[1:30:29] Everlasting Gates so the king of glory
[1:30:31] come who is the king GL the Lord Mighty
[1:30:33] host no he C him in
[1:30:38] right
[1:30:41] right the Abraham and Sarah the prophet
[1:30:44] would refer to it and say when they
[1:30:46] resurrected there he said Sarah we got
[1:30:48] to get out of here we've been recognized
[1:30:50] right well now nobody didn't know what
[1:30:52] Sarah and Abraham looked like so it was
[1:30:54] that they had pictures of them and they
[1:30:55] they were recognized as being recognized
[1:30:58] as being something Supernatural was
[1:30:59] taking place
[1:31:01] right Abraham and Sarah could just walk
[1:31:03] right through the
[1:31:04] wall walk right to walk out in the
[1:31:08] midair people probably looking around
[1:31:10] see them there something different about
[1:31:12] them
[1:31:13] people you didn't know what Abraham and
[1:31:15] Sarah looked
[1:31:17] like no said they said we got to get out
[1:31:21] of here they going to recognize
[1:31:27] around said his soul went to
[1:31:30] hell yeah and preached to the souls in
[1:31:32] prison
[1:31:35] Y and he tells you who they
[1:31:37] were
[1:31:40] y it was not my soul right because the
[1:31:45] Bible tells you who they were those who
[1:31:47] were disobedient in the longsuffering
[1:31:48] the days of Noah right now why does it
[1:31:51] say that that
[1:31:53] why did it why did it just deal with
[1:31:56] that only that part of the
[1:32:01] people it only names the
[1:32:04] people in the days of
[1:32:10] Noah that's the only ones Jesus had to
[1:32:13] testify to Y that's
[1:32:19] right because once Abraham
[1:32:22] came you had to buz on Abraham
[1:32:27] right that's right
[1:32:30] right those people had a Redemptive plan
[1:32:33] back there
[1:32:35] mhm right he was looking forward to
[1:32:38] Calvary right amen but they had a place
[1:32:40] to go to
[1:32:42] Y Jesus went down and he preached to the
[1:32:45] souls that were in prison they were
[1:32:48] disobedient it was just that group there
[1:32:50] because in the days of Noah which was
[1:32:53] 2,000 years
[1:32:54] years there was not a a prophet
[1:32:59] testimonial
[1:33:01] form until you coming on over to
[1:33:05] Noah you know you got Enoch and he is
[1:33:08] but he was very
[1:33:10] little we had to go there and tell him
[1:33:12] brother said he went there and told him
[1:33:14] said I'm the seed of the woman
[1:33:16] I'm I'm the seed of the woman that you
[1:33:18] turned down
[1:33:20] right he didn't bring them people out of
[1:33:22] hell mm-m
[1:33:25] he condemned them
[1:33:27] right they stay there until
[1:33:30] judgment but he come back down come back
[1:33:33] up by
[1:33:34] Paradise amen knocked on the
[1:33:38] door come on get the message uh
[1:33:40] countdown listen to
[1:33:43] it Abraham looked out there and said
[1:33:46] saah come
[1:33:50] here said that's a man we fed to C to y
[1:33:53] m
[1:33:56] he had a witness y
[1:33:59] Ezekiel y he a will in the middle of the
[1:34:04] way all of those prophets saw him as
[1:34:08] they preached him
[1:34:12] right Moses saw him as the I am that was
[1:34:17] in the birded
[1:34:21] bush they saw him that if they preached
[1:34:26] it come
[1:34:28] on come
[1:34:31] on but he appeared to those
[1:34:35] people he appeared as mesed to Abraham
[1:34:39] in a
[1:34:40] theoy that's right you agree if you
[1:34:42] don't go to hood as mzed y he appeared
[1:34:45] to Moses in a burning
[1:34:48] bush he appeared to those
[1:34:51] people see then when he raised them he
[1:34:54] didn't have to go preach to him
[1:34:57] right he just went there and they knew
[1:34:59] who he
[1:35:00] was right oh one of these days Luther's
[1:35:04] going to raise and you say there's the
[1:35:06] judg of my faith that's the way that I
[1:35:09] preached Wes say there's
[1:35:12] sanctification I preached it to the
[1:35:14] people amen Pentecostals would say
[1:35:17] there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] that's what we believe
[1:35:20] amen but those end time people that have
[1:35:22] to die and go by the grave can say there
[1:35:25] is the word of God that that messenger
[1:35:27] brought to us than but some of us are
[1:35:31] going to have to be we're not going to
[1:35:32] die I say us cuz I testify
