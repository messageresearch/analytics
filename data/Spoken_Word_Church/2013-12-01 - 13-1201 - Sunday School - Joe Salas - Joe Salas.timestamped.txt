[1:25] both man and Beast and against all the
[1:28] gods of Egypt and I will execute
[1:31] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[1:33] shall be to you for token upon the
[1:36] houses where you are and when I see the
[1:39] blood
[1:40] I will pass over you in the plague shall
[1:43] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[1:45] smike the land of Egypt
[1:48] uh brother Brian preacher I messaged the
[1:50] token I picked up this book and I
[1:53] couldn't put it until I finished the
[1:54] whole thing it's got a lot of good stuff
[1:56] on it so
[1:59] you want to read something and do that
[2:07] so
[2:10] what what what whatever
[2:21] token
[2:27] coconut blood shall be to you a token he
[2:31] said
[2:34] now first first one is a token Israel
[2:38] word is commonly used among we English
[2:40] people speaking peoples especially here
[2:43] in America at token is really the
[2:45] dictionaries that are token is a sign
[2:48] of a fair
[2:50] price paid see that they're fair or
[2:52] price and required pride has been paid
[2:55] been paid he said like a fair in a
[2:58] railroad or a fair on a bus line you go
[3:00] in and purchase your fair and then they
[3:03] give you a token and that token cannot
[3:05] be spent for nothing else but to the
[3:08] real world line and it is a token to the
[3:10] real world company that you have paid
[3:12] repair and it's a token and you can't
[3:15] spend it for nothing else it doesn't
[3:18] work on any other line it just works on
[3:21] that line only and it is a token
[3:24] said that now down here they were
[3:27] speaking of where we're starting and it
[3:30] was sent to Israel the blood of the Lamb
[3:33] is a token for you Israel's Lamb slain
[3:36] with Jehovah's requirement
[3:38] it must be the blood God had made a
[3:41] token and give it to Israel and no other
[3:43] tokens will work see it cannot be
[3:45] recognized
[3:47] he said to to the world's a bunch of
[3:50] foolishness but to God is the only way
[3:52] the only thing that God
[3:54] that he requires a token it must be
[3:57] there and you cannot have the token
[3:59] until the fair is paid then you're a
[4:02] possessor of the token which gives you
[4:04] the
[4:05] privilege of a free pass
[4:07] he said I'll see the blood and I'll pass
[4:09] over you what a Time that what a
[4:12] privilege to know that you packed within
[4:14] you the past when I see the blood I'll
[4:16] pass over you it's the only thing that
[4:18] he recognizes is nothing else that can
[4:20] take this place no substitute no
[4:23] denomination no nothing else it takes
[4:26] that that's God's that alone will I see
[4:32] said no matter how Roger there was how
[4:35] good they was and how much education
[4:37] they had and how they dressed the token
[4:39] was the only thing when I see the token
[4:42] I pass over you the blood was a token
[4:44] that their requirement a Jehovah had
[4:46] been
[4:47] have been made was a token that it had
[4:51] been done the blood stood for the token
[4:53] but God was a token see the light
[4:59] when God called the Lord he told him I
[5:02] have surely seen the Affliction on my
[5:04] people which are in Egypt and I have
[5:06] heard their pride by reason other test

[7:46] man Moses was very brave in the land of
[7:48] Egypt and the side of Pharaoh's servants
[7:50] and then the side of the people and
[7:52] Moses said God said the Lord about
[7:54] midnight will I go out into the midst of

[8:51] go
[8:52] uh and he went out from Pharaoh in a
[8:54] great anger and the Lord said unto Moses
[8:57] Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you then
[8:59] my wonders may be multiplying in the
[9:02] land of Egypt and more Moses and Aaron
[9:05] did all these wonders before pharaoh and
[9:07] the Lord hardened pharaohs or so that he
[9:10] will not let the children of Israel go

[11:04] it with fire
[11:05] whatever we do with a break from the
[11:08] community
[11:09] you cannot keep it

[11:32] as well
[11:36] as well 20
[11:43] 1 to 24.
[11:45] like I said brother Ryan I wanted you to
[11:47] read the whole thing but it's a long
[11:49] chapter in chapter 12 it was a long
[11:51] chapter so
[11:52] that's your uh
[11:55] that's your homework
[11:58] and Moses called for all the Elders of
[12:01] Israel I said unto them draw on and take
[12:03] your lamb according to your families and
[12:05] kill the Passover
[12:06] and you shall take a lunch at hyssop and
[12:09] hit brother and said it's just that
[12:11] we so where they grow up there they're
[12:13] easy to find so that's what they use
[12:15] and you shall take a bunch of hits up
[12:17] and dip it in the blood that is in the
[12:19] Goosebumps and two cycles with their
[12:22] blood that is in the basement and none
[12:25] and you shall go out at the door his
[12:28] house until the morning
[12:30] uh you think Pharaoh would put that
[12:32] blood on it so
[12:33] Castle pallets or whatever he had
[12:37] I don't think so
[12:40] they let for the Lord would pass through
[12:42] this to Smite the Egyptians and when he
[12:44] see the blood upon the little and on the
[12:46] two side post the Lord would pass over
[12:49] the door and I will not suffer the
[12:51] Destroyer to come unto you your house is
[12:54] to Smite you and you shall observe this
[12:57] thing for an ordinance to thee and to
[12:59] thy Sons forever how long do we have to
[13:02] keep the communion I mean some people
[13:03] take it every month some people they it
[13:06] depends but we have to keep that
[13:08] ordinance and we shall come to pass when
[13:12] you you come to the land which is the
[13:14] Lord will give you a poem because he had
[13:17] prama that you shall keep the service
[13:19] our promised land that was a promised
[13:21] land for them as a promise not to us
[13:24] amen
[13:26] let's go to uh
[13:31] 12 uh let's let's do 29 maybe till
[13:36] 32.
[13:40] and it came to pass that at midnight the
[13:42] Lord's small Smite all the first one in
[13:45] Atlanta from the first one of prayer
[13:48] that stated on his throne until the
[13:50] first morning they kept it that was in
[13:52] the dungeon and all the firstborn of the
[13:55] cattle and Pharaoh rose up in the night
[13:57] and he and all his servants and all the
[13:59] Egyptians there was a great cry in Egypt
[14:03] but there was not a house where there
[14:04] was not one day and he called for Moses
[14:08] and Aaron by night and said rise up and
[14:10] get you for from among my people both
[14:13] you and the children of Israel and go
[14:15] serve the Lord as ye have said also take
[14:19] your thoughts and your hers that you
[14:21] have said and be gone
[14:23] check this out and bless me also
[14:28] was a pharaoh at that and unbelievable
[14:31] he just that I think for the Brisco says
[14:34] uh
[14:34] you know when you're a Christian the
[14:36] people in the world may know where the
[14:37] goods are they kind of asked you to pray
[14:39] for them so I think that's the Pharaoh
[14:42] did I don't think he was a Believer I
[14:44] don't know
[14:45] you know but that's funny he said and
[14:47] and bless me also
[14:50] foreign
[15:14] and now this was the perfect lamb Christ
[15:17] was and then through that shed of his
[15:19] this land that natural land in Egypt
[15:21] that blood was applied and when it was
[15:24] it stood for a token then what would the
[15:27] blood of lamb stand for for today for
[15:30] see the token that we were that we're
[15:33] dead to ourselves and identify we are
[15:36] sacrificed see then the lamb and the
[15:38] blood and the person becomes identified
[15:41] together the sacrifice and the believer
[15:44] you see you identified in your life by
[15:46] your sacrifice it makes you what you are
[15:49] and the blood was a token or
[15:51] identification the blood identified that
[15:54] the worshiper has slain the lamb and
[15:56] accepted the land and apply the token to
[15:59] themselves that he was not ashamed he
[16:01] didn't care who stole it he wanted
[16:04] everybody to see it and it was placed in
[16:06] such a position that everybody passing
[16:08] by could see that token
[16:12] he said uh
[16:15] many people want to be Christians
[16:18] they like to do it and secretly so
[16:21] nobody would know that they were
[16:24] Christian
[16:25] or their associates they run around with
[16:28] some of them but now I want to be a
[16:31] Christian but I don't want so and so to
[16:33] know about us see we're not you see that
[16:35] it's not Christianity
[16:37] Christianity has just displayed a spoken
[16:40] publicly in public life at the office or
[16:44] on the street when travel is around and
[16:46] hanging in church everywhere else the
[16:49] blood is a token and a total must be
[16:51] applied and see
[16:53] it's not even the Covenant is not in
[16:56] effect
[16:59] by the way was talking about it when he
[17:01] goes to a Walmart that receives someone
[17:03] on the floor they picks it up so you
[17:05] know people can see that you're
[17:07] different than they are you know
[17:10] yeah
[17:12] may the Lord have mercy on my dad when
[17:15] he used to drive around we used to drive
[17:17] around and uh he'd be drinking a beer
[17:20] and he opened the window and
[17:22] throw it out the window and one of the
[17:25] people that drink post throw half a can
[17:27] out full you know and we were sitting in
[17:29] the back we didn't want to we didn't
[17:30] want to drink the beer we don't taste
[17:32] the beer but we did because he just flew
[17:34] him in the back where we were so that's
[17:36] not applying to token I'm not talking
[17:38] bad about my dad but I'm saying the
[17:40] difference you know
[17:47] see the land was killed in the evening
[17:49] time after being kept up for 14 days and
[17:52] then the land was killed and the blood
[17:54] was applied in the healing time you get
[17:56] it the token never come into existence
[17:59] until the evening time and this is the
[18:02] evening time of the age that we live in
[18:04] this is the evening time for the church
[18:07] this is the evening time for me it's the
[18:09] evening time of my message I'm dying I'm
[18:12] going I'm going I'm moving out in the
[18:15] evening time of the Gospel we come
[18:18] through justification so forth but this
[18:20] is the time that the token has to be
[18:22] applied
[18:24] he said I told you last Sunday I had
[18:27] something I wanted to talk to you about
[18:28] this is it the time that when you just
[18:30] can't play with it it's got to be done
[18:33] if it's ever going to be done it's got
[18:35] to be done now but because we can see
[18:38] that the Wrath is about to ready to pass
[18:40] through the land and everything from
[18:43] under that token will perish the blood
[18:46] has identified you
[18:54] said for the animal life could not come
[18:56] back upon the human being when I'm
[19:00] I was reading a message too where
[19:02] president said you know you have a
[19:04] Chinese uh black people or whatever they
[19:07] can give you a transfusion but if you
[19:11] get any blood from an animal it can kill
[19:13] you so if that blood from the animal and
[19:15] the human doesn't mix yeah
[19:20] when the Bible said the light went out
[19:22] in his core of course because it was a
[19:24] unit and when the blood of blood was
[19:26] gone from it to life being different
[19:29] from the blood now the blood is the
[19:31] chemistry of the life but the life is
[19:33] something different from the blood but
[19:36] the life is in the blood and an animal
[19:38] of life could not come back upon the
[19:41] worshiper when he shed his the blood of
[19:43] the Lamb he had to apply to chemistry
[19:46] because that the life was gone and could
[19:49] not come back
[19:51] he said because it cannot come back up
[19:53] on a human being because the animal life
[19:56] doesn't have a soul
[19:58] animal does not know that he is naked
[20:03] he also talks about Cain and Abel he
[20:06] said that uh
[20:08] Abel knew that it wasn't the peaches or
[20:11] apples or you know it was the blood
[20:15] yeah he doesn't realize that sin he
[20:18] knows none so therefore it's a living be
[20:20] but not a living Soul therefore the
[20:22] animal could not come back upon a human
[20:24] life because it didn't have a soul in
[20:27] that life now there is a lot of blood
[20:30] and life and soul and life that soul is
[20:32] the nature of their life therefore there
[20:35] are no certain nature it was an animal
[20:36] therefore their blood stood for token
[20:39] that their life had been given he said
[20:42] by this glorious place under this
[20:44] Covenant there is a difference between
[20:46] the blood and the life the token for the
[20:49] believer today is the Holy Ghost not a
[20:53] not a blood or chemistry but it's the
[20:55] holy spirit of God that is that token
[20:58] that God
[20:59] god require the church today God must
[21:02] see this token he must say it in every
[21:04] one of us
[21:06] they said the animal alive could not
[21:09] return back therefore God had to be
[21:11] placed on the door upon the lentil and
[21:13] upon the post of the door that every
[21:15] passerby the whole public the Republic
[21:17] everybody coming by the house knew that
[21:20] there was a sign on the door
[21:22] a blood their life had died at that door
[21:25] that's the way it has to be with every
[21:27] believer today filled with the Holy
[21:28] Ghost a token that the shed Blood by the
[21:31] lamb that the light was in the lamb has
[21:33] returned back and it's publicly sealed
[21:36] in there that everybody passing by
[21:38] talked
[21:39] talking to you has an associate with you
[21:42] seeing that the bird has been applied in
[21:45] a token of the life was in that blood is
[21:48] upon you you are safe from the Wrath let
[21:51] alone not membership no sir
[21:54] an animal life could not come back upon
[21:57] the believer because it was an animal it
[21:59] only spoke of a conscious showing that
[22:01] they would come at perfect sacrifice now
[22:05] how could there be a more perfect
[22:07] sacrific fight than God himself becoming
[22:10] the atonement himself when God was made
[22:13] first in his own creative blood that the
[22:15] only way that a life of God could ever
[22:18] come back because all of us were born by
[22:21] sex and therefore the life as in areas
[22:23] of the world and that life will not
[22:25] stand it's the thing that's already
[22:27] judged and condemned you can't patch it
[22:30] up there's no way to patch it there is
[22:32] no way to smooth it out there's no way
[22:35] to make it better it's got to die that's
[22:37] the only requirement it is it's got to
[22:39] die and the substitute of life of Jesus
[22:42] Christ has to come into you which is the
[22:45] Holy Ghost God's spoken that you have
[22:48] accepted the blood of his son Jesus
[22:51] Christ
[23:01] and blood identify identify the believer
[23:04] because their life had gone on could not
[23:06] come back so he had to have a chemistry
[23:08] he had to have like a king the blood of
[23:11] Cameron said it showed that the life
[23:12] went promised now the very Spirit itself
[23:16] is a token the Holy Spirit itself is a
[23:19] token not the blood the blood will shed
[23:21] a Calvary but it's true but the blood as
[23:24] far as it went went back into the
[23:26] elements which come from the food that
[23:28] he lived on but you see inside that
[23:30] blood cell was a life that started the
[23:32] blood cell to move it it was the
[23:34] chemistry had no life in itself and
[23:37] therefore it could not move but when the
[23:39] life come into the chemistry of the
[23:41] blood it formed the cell it form its own
[23:43] cell then cell after cell then became a
[23:46] man and that man was God Emmanuel and
[23:49] flesh but when their life we turned back
[23:51] the chemistry it went to it but the
[23:54] token is a holy ghost upon the church
[23:58] that they see Christ
[24:06] they said Israel was commanded to stay
[24:09] under their blood until March the Lord
[24:10] Has Come don't go out from under when
[24:13] Once under that token they were still in
[24:15] here and there don't leave they
[24:17] stay right there until it midnight
[24:20] stroke and then Trump is blown and when
[24:22] Trump is blue they all ramps horns began
[24:25] to blow each one marches out with his
[24:28] provision going to the promised land
[24:30] so does the man or woman who is filled
[24:32] with the Holy Ghost he sealed away and
[24:34] has secured from all harm and danger his
[24:37] whole life displays what he is wherever
[24:39] he walks whatever business he does
[24:41] whoever he talks with when he comes in
[24:44] contact with women when he comes in with
[24:46] contact with social when he comes in
[24:48] with contact with everything that
[24:50] that token is laying there amen when it
[24:53] comes to death I'll fear no evil whether
[24:55] I with me that token laser when it comes
[24:58] to Restoration you'll be there or God
[25:01] will raise him up at the last day Jesus
[25:03] said when I see that blood the token
[25:06] I'll pass over you
[25:07] remember that total was not displayed
[25:10] even the Covenant was not a mall that's
[25:12] right the Covenant was in all there was
[25:14] no
[25:23] it wasn't in effect the Covenant wasn't
[25:26] unless the token was there
[25:29] said there might be many Jews Jews say
[25:32] come here I ain't got no blood on my
[25:34] door but I want to show you something
[25:36] I'm a circumcised you I'm a circumcised
[25:39] I don't mean that
[25:40] his fingers said when I see the blood
[25:42] I'll pass over you I'm Jews could say I
[25:45] believe Jehovah you listen to the
[25:47] message of the hour he did certainly
[25:49] they had a lot of messages but this was
[25:51] the message of the ioc I believe the
[25:54] message they are yeah their blood was
[25:56] applied in the evening time
[26:00] I'll pass over it's got requirement of
[26:04] the hour
[26:04] the evening time message is they apply
[26:07] the token right that's our massive
[26:10] healing time
[26:14] just like the circumcise of the Jews he
[26:16] say I'm a Jew why do I have to go out
[26:19] there and act like that other bunch of
[26:20] fanatics
[26:23] sorry Moses stand up up and down the
[26:26] street saying that an evening message is
[26:28] here it shall come to pass at the end of
[26:31] that 14 days You Shall Gather the
[26:33] congregation together
[26:34] and kill the lamb the whole congregation
[26:37] the Israel shall kill it put their hands
[26:39] up on it the identify themselves and
[26:42] their blood shall be struck Upon Us post
[26:44] and upon the little of the door and when
[26:46] I see the battle pass over you for as a
[26:49] token that you accepted the the lamb
[26:51] that I have provided for you the blood
[26:54] was a token now that spirit is a token
[26:58] you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost
[27:00] not many days hands and when the blood
[27:02] will share the duck almost Stand Down on
[27:04] the day of Pentecost like the rushing
[27:06] Mighty Wind
[27:07] any questions
[27:09] any comments
[27:11] I had a question why 14 days
[27:15] why did he keep Landing for 14 years
[27:19] maybe we can answer it okay we're
[27:22] fortunate if I know
[27:24] that's verse 6 of chapter 12.
[27:28] you know looking for the blemishes that
[27:31] might be on the lamp yeah they were they
[27:34] were they were I mean I remember the
[27:36] reason for the 14 days but I know that
[27:38] they did
[27:40] look at and investigate and make sure it
[27:42] was it was without a blemish yeah they
[27:45] kept it for a testing right yeah no I
[27:48] think it had effect in Christ too yeah
[27:51] yeah I was in Christ
[27:54] they look at like uh
[27:57] the time before the sacrifice they did
[28:01] look look at real selfies
[28:07] the priests had to do that amount of
[28:10] time
[28:12] there's a tons of stuff here so we're
[28:16] just going to cut it off and
[28:18] because I think I think I still have to
[28:20] do it one more time so
[28:22] unless Ryan thank you yeah
