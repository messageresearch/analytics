[14:25] remember now bible

[14:48] 31st and that brother uh William Bor
[14:51] Leon will be here preaching for us and
[14:54] remember now that I say to you prepare
[14:57] to sing or to test testify or whatever
[14:59] you know cuz we'll only have a like
[15:02] start at 8:00 we always do sing about 30
[15:05] minutes and then we go into the uh
[15:08] Services you know and then we wind up uh
[15:12] whatever is left time over from there at
[15:15] midnight remember the food now I don't
[15:18] know who's supposed to take care of who
[15:19] on what side of what but everybody just
[15:22] make sure we got something to to eat for
[15:25] the Christmas time together and then if
[15:28] you always want to bring something for
[15:30] the watch Night Service we always gather
[15:32] a little early and that way we can kind
[15:35] of Fellowship you know and do and does
[15:39] anybody remember what side
[15:41] brought we can't figure out they can't
[15:44] figure out who brought the rolls last
[15:45] and who brought the this brain rolls on
[15:48] both sides and sweets on both no that's
[15:52] too much this said so one side okay we
[15:54] make our
[15:56] choice this side done the road okay so
[16:00] this side does the rolls and that side
[16:02] does the sweets uh you got that brother
[16:06] collie okay okay somebody needs to keep
[16:10] up with all of this doing but just
[16:12] remember that remember to pray for
[16:14] brother Aaron he called me this morning
[16:17] and I was praying for him but he said he
[16:19] U had what was it uh reflux reflux was
[16:24] his main problem and all but just
[16:27] remember him in your prayer he call back
[16:29] because we believe it the Lord will take
[16:31] care of anything
[16:35] else Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[16:38] Jesus for your grace and your love thank
[16:40] you for all things and we just ask you
[16:43] now that you'd come on the scene with us
[16:45] this afternoon and be with us father and
[16:47] help us
[16:48] to try to speak exactly what you'd have
[16:51] for us Lord and we gave us these things
[16:54] and we wrote them down but yet that's
[16:57] still not the whole thing but because we
[16:59] still try to follow what you want us to
[17:01] say we ask you to just have your way
[17:03] with us forgive our sins be be with
[17:06] those that are traveling today and all
[17:09] Lord Wade and June Bob and Monica n and
[17:12] and Ryan and the different ones and just
[17:14] remember the sick remember Brother Gary
[17:16] Lord his feet swelled up we pray that
[17:19] you'd touch him because we believe you
[17:22] thank you for all things we love you and
[17:25] we Praise Your Great Name and that name
[17:28] is Jesus
[17:31] amen all right we'll try to continue our
[17:33] thought with this morning you know had
[17:37] to kind of change around I guess you
[17:38] noticed that a little but company being
[17:41] here but we do that because that you
[17:43] just not going in a straight line and
[17:45] and things and they can that way you
[17:47] don't have to leave them dangling and uh
[17:51] wondering what you're talking about all
[17:53] right now verse
[17:55] three but what I want you to do now is
[17:57] to do what I said this morning
[18:01] notice Jesus
[18:04] answered their
[18:06] question but do you think they believed
[18:12] it do you think they accepted what he
[18:15] said
[18:17] no no they didn't and you will not
[18:22] accept anything that
[18:25] said until the Lord shows you the truth
[18:28] TR that's right because you're going to
[18:31] be that little word we call stubborn you
[18:34] know but none of us are stubborn we
[18:36] don't have any problems with that but we
[18:38] are going to stay ourselves until God
[18:42] reveals it and I'm glad of that because
[18:45] that way it's not somebody trying to
[18:46] figure it out for us all right but we've
[18:49] got to we do that because that's human
[18:51] being you can put down like I said you
[18:53] could take a topic and you could give
[18:56] brother brandham in a Bible brother
[18:58] random in the Bible and every one of
[19:00] them be thus saith the Lord you know on
[19:03] a topic one God or something and you
[19:06] could put down a quote thus sayith the
[19:07] Lord Bible thus sayith the Lord quote
[19:10] thus sayith the Lord you could do every
[19:11] one of them and that's not going to
[19:13] convert
[19:14] you it won't change
[19:17] you and that's the power of persuasion
[19:19] it it won't change you because you'll
[19:21] always come up with takes one year you
[19:24] know like this brother used to say I'd
[19:26] talk with him for hours and he say but
[19:29] why did he say it I mean you spend hours
[19:32] trying to express it and it the same
[19:34] point why did he say it well but
[19:37] remember it has to be
[19:40] revealed right there is no good the
[19:44] Pharisees also came unto him tempting
[19:46] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[19:49] a man to put away his wife for every
[19:51] cause and he answered and said unto them
[19:54] have you not read that he which made
[19:57] them at the beginning made them male and
[19:59] female and said for this cause shall a
[20:02] man leave father and mother and shall
[20:04] cleave to his wife and they twine shall
[20:06] be one flesh wherefore there are no more
[20:09] twine but one flesh but therefore God ha
[20:12] joined together let not man put a under
[20:15] they say unto him why did Moses then
[20:19] command to give a writing of divorcement
[20:21] and to put her away like I said the only
[20:23] one you've got there is a connection
[20:25] back with Deuteronomy 24 you know to uh
[20:29] expressing it right he saith unto them
[20:32] Moses because of the hardness of your
[20:34] heart suffered you to put away your
[20:36] wives but from the beginning it was not
[20:38] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[20:41] put away his wife except it be for
[20:43] fornication and shall marry another
[20:45] committeth adultery and whoo Marth her
[20:47] that is put away does commit adultery
[20:51] you may be seated the Lord at his
[20:52] Blessing to the reading of the word
[20:56] now we're going to try to uh I said I
[21:00] took this morning kind of a split part
[21:03] and wasn't going to get into the
[21:06] fornication adultery this morning but I
[21:09] had to put it in to make sure the you
[21:13] know the visitors would understand us
[21:15] and not just be a line that they go away
[21:18] and wonder what's going on
[21:21] now but I want you to understand one
[21:25] thing that as I said polygamy was
[21:32] instituted or allowed to come into being
[21:36] permitted but that was not God's
[21:39] original
[21:41] plan because his original plan was for
[21:44] us to been born without sex without any
[21:48] problem all right but he knew we would
[21:51] not be that
[21:53] way so he takes that that has been done
[21:58] by
[21:59] mankind in his permissive will and he
[22:03] turned it and T may you know used it to
[22:06] bring forth and will bring forth his
[22:08] perfect
[22:10] will brother randam said when we get
[22:12] into the
[22:13] Millennium he says there he will be
[22:16] standing as one with a many many
[22:21] membered body but says that will be only
[22:25] one body right
[22:28] all right see now that you can't explain
[22:31] that without going through the
[22:32] scriptures as I tried to express the
[22:35] thought and we more now to try to
[22:38] understand because remember in the body
[22:42] of Christ we are the body of Christ all
[22:45] right now then that being that then it's
[22:48] a many membered
[22:50] body called the
[22:53] bride all right see then being that part
[22:56] then polyg
[22:59] was not an
[23:00] attribute I hope you followed that point
[23:04] polygamy was
[23:05] permitted but not an
[23:08] attribute it was permitted for a
[23:13] type all right and permit it as a type
[23:16] then you know you can't make two rights
[23:20] or two wrongs be one right you know you
[23:24] you've got to keep it correctly that you
[23:27] know the the order of events and the
[23:29] things that polygamy was allowed back
[23:32] there to be a type to be to type Christ
[23:37] and the church all right but then we got
[23:41] up to that point of where that uh you
[23:46] know Christ and the
[23:49] church on the day of
[23:51] Pentecost sure it's one Christ one head
[23:55] with a many membered body yeah but
[23:58] remember it's only one
[24:01] body that's where you mess up see
[24:04] because there's no humanly way the mind
[24:06] can comprehend that that's I mean
[24:09] there's no way we can comprehend that
[24:11] that there's s billion people in the
[24:13] world today and that God could give
[24:15] every one of them the baptism of the
[24:16] Holy Ghost and yet that just be one body
[24:20] that just be one wife when there's male
[24:22] and female
[24:23] yes right and see then it it's something
[24:26] that has to be revealed he brought to
[24:29] the situation see of giving
[24:32] understanding to where we can follow and
[24:36] see and then come out of it and make a
[24:40] statement because I believe in that uh
[24:44] you you take somebody that won't tell
[24:45] you what they believe they don't believe
[24:51] nothing that true yes well I'm not going
[24:54] to tell what I
[24:56] believe why
[24:59] I mean is that one of them things that
[25:01] you and the Lord got it all figured out
[25:02] and you and the Lord's the only ones got
[25:04] it you might wind up like the little boy
[25:07] was that kept saying me and Grandpa we
[25:11] know something but we ain't going to
[25:11] tell
[25:14] nobody me and Grandpa know something we
[25:16] ain't going to tell
[25:17] nobody and he started crying he
[25:19] said I done for God now Grandpa's only
[25:22] one that
[25:23] knows so you know we're
[25:26] silly but do you follow
[25:29] it see God
[25:32] permitted
[25:35] polygamy not the original plan to make
[25:39] it because if you got him the original
[25:41] plan to make it then you'd have to have
[25:43] the original plan did he have to make
[25:45] the man
[25:46] sin is that you know does that that go
[25:51] through he would had to make you sin if
[25:54] he was going to go ahead and make it his
[25:55] perfect will to bring polygamy me he
[25:58] have to be the author of sin and he's
[26:00] he's not he permitted it to happen all
[26:03] right then permitting it to happen he
[26:06] could use it as a
[26:09] type right but one day see it has to
[26:13] come out to the
[26:16] Perfection and when it does it will
[26:18] still have something connected to it
[26:21] this is what I'm driving at but I'm not
[26:23] going to get into it this evening I know
[26:26] that
[26:28] I I'm trying to get you to look at
[26:30] something and think my Revelation for
[26:33] one
[26:34] time in your life without just saying
[26:37] brother Dell you said brother Dell you
[26:38] said brother Dell you said brother Brown
[26:40] said I like brother you just you just
[26:43] beating your head against
[26:45] a it'll be like an old we used to wake
[26:49] up on Sunday morning cuz we had an old
[26:50] tin roof on the house every Sunday
[26:52] morning you wake
[26:56] up it was a cotton picking old
[27:00] woodpecker but instead of getting on the
[27:02] wood he'd get on the
[27:04] 10 and he woke everybody up so that's
[27:08] what we're doing a lot of time we're
[27:09] just beating their head you know all
[27:12] right but now
[27:14] listen see the new birth we covered this
[27:19] morning the new
[27:21] birth cannot do away with your marital
[27:26] situations I don't care what you
[27:29] think you got to think
[27:32] sensibly the new birth does a way for
[27:35] the sin for the soul of mankind right
[27:38] all right and in doing that then the
[27:42] body is still
[27:44] left with things that we done
[27:48] wrong yeah but that you don't even
[27:50] preach
[27:52] Grace well I sure don't want to preach
[27:55] disgrace right I I hope the point got
[27:58] across this morning that's right that if
[28:00] you say that you all you need is the new
[28:03] birth then brother brandham didn't need
[28:05] to come the Bible was already full of
[28:09] Salvation
[28:11] right and he didn't have to preach the
[28:13] grace of marriage and
[28:15] divorce if all we need is a new
[28:19] birth Paul didn't have to preach
[28:22] it and what about Moses having to give
[28:25] it under when there was a lot of things
[28:28] that were
[28:33] legal
[28:38] right you see we go around and then we
[28:41] don't stick our head like a an ostrich
[28:43] into the ground and won't come up and
[28:45] admit but just remember the rest of your
[28:46] body is sticking
[28:49] out but because you're born
[28:52] again does not make all things right for
[28:56] the body well I don't understand
[28:59] you I don't understand you cuz how could
[29:03] you you you have us free but we're not
[29:07] free I didn't make the book right I
[29:11] didn't write the
[29:12] story I didn't do the
[29:15] plan you got to talk to somebody
[29:19] else all right because see if you're
[29:21] trying to make everything into the basis
[29:23] of just this does away with it well now
[29:26] look what you've done away with the rest
[29:27] of the things so we got to have a
[29:30] balance all the way through to come out
[29:32] to the basis of of having a complete
[29:36] understanding all right but I just don't
[29:39] understand how you can be born again and
[29:40] yet something hanging on to you remember
[29:43] the new birth is not in your
[29:45] body the new birth is not in your spirit
[29:49] I wish it was but is
[29:52] not all right but but I'm not
[29:55] responsible only just I I I I didn't do
[30:01] that just be sensible and think about it
[30:05] you didn't have mass confusion about now
[30:08] I'm going to say this and I hope it
[30:10] comes out
[30:11] right there wasn't as much mass
[30:13] confusion about marriage and divorce in
[30:16] the Baptist Church as they are in the
[30:18] people of this
[30:20] message
[30:23] no I would say Methodist Church I'd say
[30:26] Presbyterian
[30:28] I'd say they probably wouldn't as much
[30:29] in the
[30:31] Catholic as they are in the people of
[30:33] this so-called message because
[30:35] everybody's got it figured
[30:38] out and it's their way or no
[30:42] way
[30:46] well but listen you say well where's a
[30:48] Bible for
[30:51] anything connecting
[30:54] us to human beings in part
[30:58] go ahead brother and pull up uh 1
[31:02] Corinthians I think that's right number
[31:04] five on your
[31:06] notes let's just read
[31:09] it let's see may I may have get the
[31:11] wrong one
[31:13] now
[31:18] yeah what know you not that which is
[31:21] joined to an Harlot is one body that's
[31:23] why you're not supposed to marry Harlot
[31:25] right because you become one
[31:28] flesh for two say he shall be one flesh
[31:31] but he do join to the Lord is one Spirit
[31:34] okay flee fornication every sin that a
[31:38] man doeth is without the
[31:40] body why because sin originates in the
[31:47] uh inner being of
[31:52] you now to a lost person sin is from the
[31:56] total inside out Soul Spirit body is all
[32:02] sin all
[32:04] right
[32:05] now so you don't sin with your
[32:09] body you display sin with your body
[32:12] that's right you sin is the unbelief
[32:15] right right Eve was first unbelief then
[32:18] the natural right all right so look what
[32:21] it saying flee fornication every sin
[32:23] that a man doeth is without the body why
[32:25] because it's the inward part now if it's
[32:27] a born again
[32:31] Christian and you don't like this but
[32:34] the prophets one that said the born
[32:36] again Christian did Sin so that you
[32:38] argue with him now all right and the
[32:40] scripture says the sins plural all right
[32:44] then if you're a born again Christian
[32:46] and you do
[32:47] wrong is that making
[32:51] okay I didn't do that for my
[32:56] soul
[32:59] I say you sure ain't connected to
[33:01] it because you can do the garbage
[33:04] cans but I can't do that the Bible says
[33:07] I cannot the Bible doesn't say you can't
[33:09] sin that's right it says the seed
[33:13] remaineth in you
[33:17] right the seed is what can't
[33:19] sin the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[33:22] what can't sin amen
[33:24] right so the seed of God the AP ISM with
[33:27] the Holy Ghost remains in you and cannot
[33:29] sin but yet we have a body and a spirit
[33:32] to deal
[33:33] with come on you want me to quote your
[33:38] prophet he said hey even beyond the
[33:40] curtain of time he said them women held
[33:43] me and they said you don't understand
[33:45] what I
[33:48] mean if you don't believe it go find
[33:50] your
[33:50] quote that's what he he said you don't
[33:54] take a woman and pull her up to you oh
[33:57] that's free love it don't bother me you
[34:00] a lying
[34:02] hypocrite well
[34:04] look flee fornication every sin that a
[34:07] man doeth is without the body but he
[34:10] that committeth fornication sinth
[34:12] against his own
[34:16] body all right now if I'm not right and
[34:20] the Bible's not right why do you have to
[34:24] confess to your partner
[34:31] tacking a nail down okay why do you have
[34:34] to
[34:37] confess and brother Bram told that woman
[34:40] said you didn't sin against God right
[34:43] you sinned against your
[34:45] husband well wouldn't it be vice versa
[34:48] you know okay yeah but us guys you know
[34:50] it's all right for us to do now there
[34:52] ain't no such thing if you didn't follow
[34:54] me this morning you surely missed a
[34:55] whole lot right
[34:57] amen man can't put his wife away for
[35:00] just any
[35:01] cause he's got to have scriptural
[35:06] cause not just because you don't want to
[35:08] live together CUA they they do it no see
[35:13] you always got motives in behind those
[35:17] things you know you you've got some
[35:20] reason that you want it that
[35:22] way just won't admit it right but see
[35:27] our reasons come out in the last
[35:29] days because of who we
[35:32] are but see now
[35:35] remember we better get down to
[35:39] understanding to understand that you
[35:43] know the Bible
[35:46] says she cannot put her husband away for
[35:50] any
[35:51] cause but the Bible does not say he can
[35:54] put her away for any CA
[35:58] cause he's got to have a scriptural
[36:02] cause if
[36:04] not he commits adultery why because he's
[36:08] going to go get him another one she
[36:10] winds up committing
[36:13] adultery just because you say well we
[36:15] just wasn't
[36:19] compatible I told you start with you
[36:21] don't like my way of talking but you
[36:23] marry the first time because of Harmon
[36:25] factors that's called
[36:28] lust oh no it was love at first side
[36:31] yeah then it was love at second side and
[36:33] third side and fourth
[36:35] side
[36:37] right yeah you get
[36:39] me
[36:41] no hormone factors work upon people and
[36:45] causes them to get
[36:51] married I know you don't like I destroy
[36:53] I'm sorry I'm sorry about busting
[36:55] bubbles now I love it I like to see that
[36:58] go you I like to see your face
[37:02] go I said up here watching you you mean
[37:06] it goes and then all at on you
[37:09] go oh I hit that brother around said you
[37:12] ought to see the reactions on people's
[37:14] faces I'm not a prophet I just look at
[37:20] faces but now we we
[37:23] covered that she cannot put him
[37:28] away no matter
[37:31] what but he can put her away if he has a
[37:35] just
[37:36] cause scriptural just cause quoted by
[37:41] the Lord
[37:43] Jesus when he was telling you in Matthew
[37:46] 19 you know and then we had the other
[37:49] one in Matthew uh is it 135 or 53 31 or
[37:53] something where one of them says saving
[37:56] for for the cause of fornication the
[37:57] other one says except it be for the
[38:00] cause of
[38:01] fornication all
[38:02] right now before we start with the point
[38:07] of
[38:08] defining and you may think that I don't
[38:10] have these I didn't
[38:11] rewrite this was the service for this
[38:14] afternoon
[38:18] so let's go to Galatians 3 that we were
[38:22] on this
[38:25] morning all
[38:27] right you got Galatians
[38:30] 3
[38:34] 26 coming down talking about being
[38:38] baptized into Christ and he says there
[38:40] is neither Jew nor Greek there's neither
[38:42] Bond nor free there's neither male nor
[38:44] female for all for ye are all one in
[38:48] Christ all right that's the only way we
[38:51] can be Abraham's seed all but there's
[38:53] neither male nor female in the body of
[38:55] Christ amen that should be
[39:00] sensible there is no male and there is
[39:02] no female in the body of Christ it's the
[39:06] female which is the body of Christ
[39:08] that's right all
[39:10] right everybody clear with me all right
[39:13] see then if that be
[39:19] true then you can't lean on the fact
[39:23] of male being one way and female being
[39:26] another way in the
[39:29] Kingdom no that won't work right in the
[39:33] Kingdom they're the
[39:35] same right because that's the way it was
[39:40] supposed to have been right
[39:43] right it was supposed to
[39:46] been you know just to stay with the male
[39:49] and the female as being
[39:52] one that was the original all right see
[39:55] then you can't can't go and say well
[39:57] it's okay for him but ain't okay for her
[40:00] you got to have scriptural
[40:04] reasons right and having scriptural
[40:07] reasons you know you you must go to it
[40:10] and you'll argue all you want to about
[40:14] things but I I want to I just thought of
[40:17] one scripture that I did pull up go
[40:20] ahead brother and pull up Matthew
[40:21] 22 I want you to read this with me and
[40:24] let's think about it
[40:28] cuz this is the people talking to the
[40:30] Lord
[40:35] Jesus you got
[40:37] it all right I'll start reading
[40:41] down they come to him saying Master
[40:44] Moses said if a man die having no
[40:50] children his brother shall marry his
[40:52] wife and raise up seed unto his brother
[40:54] remember that was the law you know
[40:57] you had to take and raise up children
[40:59] that was put to the other name everybody
[41:03] clear now watch they're using it to trap
[41:05] him right now there were they see they
[41:08] give him a parable oh we're going to get
[41:12] him now there were with us seven
[41:17] Brethren and the first when he' married
[41:19] a wife deceased he died he died right
[41:24] and having no issue left his wife unto
[41:27] his
[41:28] brother likewise the second also and the
[41:32] third unto the seventh so you understand
[41:35] you remember this morning if her husband
[41:37] be dead she's free to marry in the Lord
[41:41] you remember all right so her first
[41:43] husband dies no
[41:45] children so what happens the brother
[41:48] takes
[41:49] her and supposed to buar Children the
[41:52] first child goes to the man's name right
[41:55] of the beginning the rest will go to his
[41:58] all right so you go through seven of
[42:00] them they thought they had it really
[42:02] going
[42:05] good last of all the woman dies died
[42:12] also therefore in the resurrection whose
[42:16] wife shall she be of the
[42:23] seven for they all at
[42:29] her Jesus answered and said unto them
[42:32] you do Heir not knowing the
[42:37] scriptures nor the power of
[42:41] God now remember in the body of Christ
[42:44] is Nei a male nor
[42:47] female far in the resurrection verse 30
[42:51] they neither marry nor are given in
[42:54] marriage but are as the angels of God in
[43:01] heaven now that's going to be a
[43:05] day and I'll bring this point out while
[43:07] I'm at
[43:09] it uh that's going to be a day ain't
[43:12] it when you get up there she comes up
[43:15] and starts through the Pearly
[43:18] Gates and she turns around and said
[43:20] hubby one hubby two hubby three hubby
[43:22] four hubby five hubby six come
[43:25] on
[43:28] now that's for
[43:30] her and he ain't got nothing to do with
[43:33] polygamy go she's not tied up none of
[43:38] that but what happens when you get up
[43:41] there were
[43:43] that the man has a wife and she dies and
[43:47] he marries again he has another wife and
[43:49] she dies has another wife and she dies
[43:52] and he has seven
[43:54] wives is it going to be going through
[43:57] the ply Gates come on hubby I mean wife
[44:00] you know you
[44:02] understand Jesus said you do
[44:07] error what we've been taught is the
[44:10] reason we think the way we
[44:14] think
[44:16] right see I know there's this discussion
[44:19] around here about it
[44:21] about a statement brother brandham
[44:24] seemingly made and I'm honest I wish I
[44:26] if you'll tell me where it's at I'll be
[44:27] glad to get it and read it I know
[44:29] there's something there in connection
[44:31] but I don't I can't find it with a
[44:33] computer that you know some people say
[44:36] well brother Brown said all will be made
[44:38] right over there we got the wrong
[44:40] partner here we have the right one
[44:42] there
[44:44] well
[44:51] now suppose he said
[44:54] it what how are we going to deal with
[44:59] it you didn't understand what I
[45:06] Illustrated in the
[45:08] resurrection
[45:10] right I know the stories I know the
[45:12] things I know the arms and mey taking
[45:16] him on one and hope taking him on the
[45:17] other I know the stories so brother
[45:19] Brandon is going to have
[45:24] two if that's the way you're
[45:27] going well what about the lady that
[45:30] married the
[45:32] husbands what are you going to do with
[45:40] her you see you're dealing in something
[45:43] that a man is expressing sometimes a
[45:49] thought and as he's expressing that
[45:52] thought we don't get the right
[45:54] understanding of that thought right now
[45:56] I ask you a question number two question
[45:59] for me to drive the
[46:01] nail what's the reason of
[46:05] contemplating U the situation of uh well
[46:09] I may got the wrong husband here but
[46:11] when I get over there I'll have the
[46:13] right
[46:14] one what's the reason when I just proved
[46:18] by two scriptures that there neither
[46:19] male or
[46:23] female what's the purpose
[46:26] I'll tell you the purpose people are
[46:29] wanting Soul
[46:30] mating have you ever heard of Soul
[46:34] mating Soul mating is where you know
[46:38] that I say well Peggy me and her can't
[46:41] get
[46:43] along so I'm going to divorce her and
[46:45] find my real soul to mate with me cuz
[46:49] we're going to be there as husband and
[46:51] wife
[46:53] now you can think that all you want to
[46:56] what's your
[46:58] reason well I just want to know the
[47:01] truth I just massively confused
[47:06] you is there any truth could be brought
[47:09] out of a quote that a prophet would say
[47:12] maybe I don't know he says it in the
[47:14] verbatim words you may have the wrong
[47:17] one here but you'll get the right one
[47:18] there or something or all things will be
[47:20] made right what is he meaning all things
[47:21] will be made
[47:24] right the ride I want when I get there
[47:28] is to be the Bride of Jesus
[47:33] Christ not to try to figure out how many
[47:35] more wise I
[47:37] got right but see we think we're going
[47:39] up to heaven and we going to get all
[47:41] these wi back are we going to get all
[47:43] these husbands
[47:44] back
[47:46] why what
[47:52] for I know what a man done one time a
[47:56] real dear friend of mine years ago he
[47:58] had a
[48:00] dream he had a dream that he had a seed
[48:03] to
[48:05] plant and that his wife was already
[48:09] through
[48:10] menopause so he knew that he couldn't
[48:13] have the seed through her so he went out
[48:16] and got him 18yar old girl planted of
[48:19] seed and got a
[48:23] child I L the man he was a wonderful old
[48:27] man I sit at my house and talked with
[48:29] him I said
[48:32] brother why did you mess
[48:35] up well my wife was already to menopause
[48:38] and she couldn't have the
[48:41] child I said don't you
[48:44] understand if you got a seed to plant
[48:46] that means you got a word to seow right
[48:50] you're a preacher you're an
[48:52] understood right not to go plant a
[48:54] natural seed into a woman and get her
[48:57] pregnant am why didn't you preach the
[49:00] gospel that's right and I told him
[49:02] because it was a seed doctor they were
[49:04] on I come here with a seed in
[49:09] me now I know that's prevalent even here
[49:12] some people still think on those things
[49:13] of a seed but just remember that seed
[49:17] went to a natural girl getting pregnant
[49:20] right cuz I told him before then I said
[49:24] you're setting on the Vil's traps and
[49:27] you're going around and around with that
[49:29] Seed doctrine and you're going to do
[49:33] wrong and he
[49:35] did but of course he's
[49:38] spiritual now do you think you could
[49:39] tell him he was wrong about getting that
[49:41] girl pregnant no way he was led of the
[49:45] Lord 80 70 year old man getting 18 year
[49:48] old girl pregnant oh he led of the
[49:54] Lord
[49:56] I'm too
[49:57] old I'm
[49:59] sorry I just have to look at it the way
[50:02] I see
[50:03] it that in the
[50:08] bases two wrongs never right in one just
[50:12] on your way I don't know where they're
[50:13] pulling this room or what they're
[50:14] pulling it up for but
[50:18] uh please let and they going have to
[50:21] give it to
[50:22] me well all born again believers
[50:26] I don't know what to do in MC so we'll
[50:28] we'll go on with the message okay
[50:30] they're trying to find something that's
[50:32] all right but now listen let's get down
[50:35] to this and be
[50:37] serious let's be a serious
[50:41] Point why are we concerned about heaven
[50:43] and what's going to be up there we
[50:45] better be concerned what's going on here
[50:47] now cuz there ain't no way of getting up
[50:50] there and correcting
[50:51] things right if there's any correction
[50:54] it's got to be done here here because we
[50:56] can't get dire and plead A Cause right
[50:59] so forget it you know just settle down
[51:03] and be what we are but the discussion
[51:06] has always been among the Believers of
[51:08] the message because I faced this 40
[51:10] something years ago and I gave this
[51:13] quote that you know our doctrinal ideas
[51:17] in our mind so listen now everybody
[51:19] everybody
[51:21] awake we than
[51:24] fornication we've been taught
[51:27] fornication is before
[51:31] marriage and adultery is after
[51:35] marriage all
[51:37] right but now how are you going to put
[51:39] that
[51:43] together it's been taught that a man can
[51:46] put away his wife I know invisible Union
[51:48] I got to
[51:50] quote and marry again if his wife has
[51:53] committed
[51:54] fornication
[51:56] but it's been taught that if a man's
[51:58] wife commits adultery he can't divorce
[52:00] her and marry
[52:07] again so now you're really in good
[52:11] shape and you're going to be in real
[52:13] good shape when we find out that God put
[52:15] Israel away for adultery right and God
[52:18] put the methodus away for adultery and
[52:20] the Baptist and the thing for
[52:24] adultery
[52:26] but see then we need to erase that
[52:28] part whatever you would believe about
[52:31] adultery fornication you need to erase
[52:33] that old teaching because it was taught
[52:36] and I know a man that they told him he
[52:38] had to live with his wife and she had
[52:41] committed
[52:44] adultery and that he could not divorce
[52:47] her let alone even
[52:53] Remar now
[52:58] so what are you going to deal with
[53:06] fornication when all sin we just read in
[53:09] the
[53:10] scripture is without the body but
[53:13] fornication is of the body all right now
[53:18] we'll give you the definition in a
[53:20] minute the prophet said what is
[53:21] fornication he said it's unclean
[53:24] living
[53:26] but see I know we've been taught
[53:28] that see we've been taught that
[53:30] fornication is before marriage adultery
[53:33] is after marriage well that's that's
[53:35] sensible that's true that's a
[53:38] definition but you cannot put it in that
[53:41] category and nail it down without giving
[53:43] some understanding because you're going
[53:46] to have it that God could put you away
[53:48] for fornication but couldn't put you
[53:50] away for
[53:53] adultery and where you going to put the
[53:54] man you mean the man he marries a
[53:59] woman and when he marries a woman and
[54:02] she commits adultery is he got to live
[54:04] with
[54:10] her or can he just divorce her but he
[54:12] can't
[54:14] remarry which which way you're
[54:20] going come on I know the definition of
[54:22] fornication and adultery we're going to
[54:24] read what the prophets says but I'm
[54:26] trying to get you to think sensibly when
[54:29] they we're not supposed to think we're
[54:30] only supposed to take what the prophet
[54:32] said okay Judas went and hung himself
[54:35] you go do likewise help
[54:42] yourself you want quotes I can
[54:46] quote he said Luther denominated and
[54:49] died and went to
[54:52] hell you want to
[54:54] quote
[54:58] quotes will kill
[55:01] you now you know Luther didn't
[55:03] denominate and die and go to hell that's
[55:05] right right you know better than that
[55:11] right but see you just say well I've got
[55:13] a
[55:14] quote well all
[55:16] right but what about
[55:19] it but remember what I'm
[55:24] illustrating
[55:26] in the body it's neither male nor
[55:32] female in the resurrection it's not
[55:35] trying to pick out who's going to walk
[55:37] up and take whose arm I told you I love
[55:40] the story I believe it will happen I
[55:43] believe mey will take one arm and hope
[55:45] will take the other one I believe
[55:47] that but is that two
[55:54] wives
[56:00] would you have any
[56:04] trouble may I illustrate I mean I won't
[56:06] get everybody up here but may I
[56:07] illustrate it you got mey here brother
[56:10] brand here and hope here would you have
[56:12] any trouble for brother brandham to lock
[56:14] arms with brother
[56:19] Neville or mey to lock arms with brother
[56:22] Neville and I don't know brother
[56:24] Neville's wife's name that you know here
[56:27] she would come and here would be another
[56:29] come and here would be another come
[56:31] that's
[56:33] right I mean come on cuz it's not going
[56:36] to be going up there and having babies
[56:39] because I'll remind you of the man that
[56:41] I told you the story about because he's
[56:43] taught and you can see it in his
[56:46] mind that one day in glorified bodies
[56:50] you could have sex all day long and not
[56:52] get
[56:53] tired
[56:55] now I don't back
[56:58] up that was in his mind
[57:03] burning sorry for being
[57:07] plain but you got the
[57:12] point see then what is
[57:15] it now let's take the definitions go
[57:18] ahead with number three on this is
[57:20] paragraph
[57:21] 5758 excuse me uh paragraph
[57:26] 1
[57:28] 85 questions and answers
[57:31] 1959 8 or
[57:34] 628 should be number two on
[57:41] your said brother Bill what is the
[57:44] difference between fornication and
[57:46] adultery Matthew
[57:49] 199 Jesus said in Matthew 199 whosoever
[57:52] put away with his wife and marries
[57:54] another excepted be for fornica cause of
[57:55] fornication commits adultery the
[57:58] difference between fornication and
[58:00] adultery the word could be applied
[58:03] either
[58:05] way now that's his wording all right but
[58:09] to make it clear what he was talking
[58:12] about cuz that was the question what's
[58:14] the difference between adultery and
[58:18] fornication he said it couldn't be
[58:19] applied either way but to make it clear
[58:22] what he was talking about there a woman
[58:24] that's un married cannot commit adultery
[58:27] that's sensible we don't need that
[58:28] explain because she had no husband to
[58:31] commit adultery
[58:33] against it's uncleanness for her she has
[58:37] to confess that to her husband before
[58:39] they are married if she did that if not
[58:44] her husband finds it out later he has a
[58:46] right to put her away because she took a
[58:49] false V all
[58:51] right
[58:53] defining fornication
[58:56] as a woman before
[58:59] marriage in comparison with adultery as
[59:03] to accounting
[59:05] to her being
[59:07] married right we he says it can be
[59:10] applied either way well
[59:16] now let's see pull on up to the bottom I
[59:19] think and I like to put them all in I
[59:22] believe I marked that oh yeah I didn't
[59:24] mark it but so fornication is what a
[59:26] girl when she lives unclean that's
[59:28] fornication cuz she has no husband but
[59:31] when she's married and then she lives
[59:33] like that she commits adultery against
[59:36] her
[59:37] husband all right no problem we've got
[59:41] the definition from the prophet of
[59:45] understanding of what it's to be all
[59:48] right then where do we put
[59:53] it
[59:56] we're going to hold that to a point as I
[59:59] said to start with and we're going to
[1:00:00] say that a man can put away his wife for
[1:00:01] committing fornication in his own
[1:00:03] invisible Union where he says it's even
[1:00:05] 10 years which you know what that means
[1:00:07] it doesn't mean just 10 or 11 or
[1:00:09] whatever he just meaning no matter where
[1:00:12] down the line she tells her husband she
[1:00:14] was untrue to her him before they
[1:00:16] married then he can put her away he said
[1:00:19] and marry
[1:00:21] again why because it's she was on true
[1:00:24] to him false vow a
[1:00:27] lie all right but now what are you going
[1:00:31] to do with a man that has a wife and
[1:00:34] she runs out with somebody
[1:00:37] else are you going to make him live with
[1:00:40] her are you going to say that he can
[1:00:43] divorce her but he can't
[1:00:45] remarry now I want to see that in the
[1:00:47] scripture I want to see that in the
[1:00:49] prophet's
[1:00:51] message go I know that's an argument
[1:00:56] all but now where's your argument which
[1:01:00] is the greater the fornication before or
[1:01:04] the adultery
[1:01:05] after he put Israel away for
[1:01:15] adultery come
[1:01:17] on you see we get that bent into our
[1:01:22] brain and like I said no matter how many
[1:01:25] quotes I give you today you're going
[1:01:27] away with the same
[1:01:29] thought and you're going to keep that
[1:01:36] thought so then there's nothing to do
[1:01:38] but pray look what he saids on marriage
[1:01:41] and
[1:01:42] divorce now was Eve married to
[1:01:49] Adam now I know they were one flesh I
[1:01:52] know the whole situation okay
[1:01:55] but was she married to Adam did she
[1:01:57] commit fornication or
[1:02:00] adultery which one did she
[1:02:03] do you know where I'm heading because
[1:02:07] Adam had a god-given
[1:02:09] right to have put Eve away right there
[1:02:13] right now you agree with me you agree he
[1:02:16] had a god-given right to put her away
[1:02:18] brother R said she committed
[1:02:21] adultery well now that's taken away that
[1:02:24] she
[1:02:25] that you got to stay without
[1:02:27] adultery all right go ahead because
[1:02:30] that's on marriage and divorce I didn't
[1:02:32] get to Mark these because I I was late
[1:02:35] getting back up and all right let me
[1:02:38] pick it out where it's at uh roll it on
[1:02:43] up
[1:02:46] yeah they talking about it was not an
[1:02:48] apricot what it was neither one she
[1:02:51] committed
[1:02:53] adultery you talking about Eve
[1:02:56] right that brought forth the first child
[1:03:00] which was Cain Satan's own son for and
[1:03:02] him laid to Evil all right Eve committed
[1:03:07] adultery and Adam had a god-given right
[1:03:10] to put her away right
[1:03:12] there but we know he
[1:03:14] didn't but the prophet didn't say she
[1:03:16] committed
[1:03:18] fornication why
[1:03:20] because fornication adultery is the same
[1:03:23] word
[1:03:24] they had not come together as husband
[1:03:26] and
[1:03:27] wife
[1:03:30] right so then they are tangible
[1:03:32] fornication or
[1:03:34] adultery it's all the same word all
[1:03:37] right now look at the next one invisible
[1:03:40] Union of the bride of
[1:03:41] Christ paragraph
[1:03:45] 229 how did you come to do this you were
[1:03:48] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:03:51] your adulterous parent Eve is it's no
[1:03:54] fault of your own by your natural nature
[1:03:56] you come after Eve who committed
[1:04:03] adultery that's the reason you were born
[1:04:05] in adultery a
[1:04:09] sinner so what is it
[1:04:11] then so we're back to where that we use
[1:04:15] that scripture of 1 Corinthians
[1:04:17] 16:6 it says flee fornication for every
[1:04:20] sin that is man doeth is without the
[1:04:22] body but he that committeth forn ation
[1:04:24] sin against his own body you're back to
[1:04:26] fornication and adultery being the same
[1:04:33] word see a woman that commits if she
[1:04:36] does
[1:04:38] fornication all right that's before
[1:04:41] marriage we got that out
[1:04:42] straight but then she
[1:04:45] marries what is
[1:04:49] she is she a fornicator or an adulteress
[1:04:53] by not telling her husband
[1:04:57] husband cleans the
[1:04:59] nail which one is
[1:05:08] it now let's just get a few quotes
[1:05:11] and go ahead well number
[1:05:15] six why we're not a
[1:05:19] denomination how would you how would a
[1:05:22] king commit fornication for the church
[1:05:25] is spiritual
[1:05:26] fornication spiritual what is
[1:05:28] fornication it's well it's like a woman
[1:05:31] living untrue to her
[1:05:34] husband she's living with another
[1:05:38] man while she's got a
[1:05:44] husband did it click she's living with
[1:05:48] another man while she's got a
[1:05:51] husband so if she don't tell
[1:05:55] you about hubby number
[1:06:00] one right and she's married to you she's
[1:06:04] got two hubbies
[1:06:07] right now which one is it adultery or
[1:06:11] fornication now you got them both
[1:06:15] involved because she committed
[1:06:17] fornication but not telling you but now
[1:06:20] she's committing adultery by living with
[1:06:22] you right oh now interchange your word
[1:06:27] right
[1:06:30] okay
[1:06:32] right and this church then is pretending
[1:06:36] to be the bride of Christ while she
[1:06:38] committed fornication with the kings of
[1:06:39] the world with her unclean living
[1:06:42] unclean profession you know profession
[1:06:45] he said it's deep all
[1:06:48] right look at invisible
[1:06:51] Union paragraph 83 read 85
[1:06:56] 86 and look the same as a church married
[1:07:00] to the law has to come also before
[1:07:04] Christ before the second
[1:07:08] marriage she has to confess that if she
[1:07:11] doesn't and she lives with her husband
[1:07:13] 10 years and then confesses it he has a
[1:07:17] right to put her away and marry another
[1:07:19] woman that's the scripture fornication
[1:07:22] is unclean living
[1:07:24] okay we stay exactly with that believing
[1:07:28] it all
[1:07:30] right but
[1:07:33] now as I
[1:07:35] said are you going to bind the
[1:07:39] man to an untrue
[1:07:41] wife cuz if you do you got problems with
[1:07:44] with
[1:07:46] God cuz he put away Israel for
[1:07:49] committing
[1:07:51] adultery right right
[1:07:55] okay so he can put her away for
[1:07:56] committing adultery we got that straight
[1:07:59] he can put her away for committing
[1:08:00] adultery and if he's got legal
[1:08:05] grounds he can marry
[1:08:07] again that's why brother brandham is
[1:08:10] emphatically stating that we haven't got
[1:08:12] there yet he said that's why it doesn't
[1:08:14] say for him it says for
[1:08:22] her come
[1:08:25] on what about this woman what about this
[1:08:32] wife what about this one that you would
[1:08:34] live with for a while and then she
[1:08:37] commits adultery against you you
[1:08:42] know and you say what but you can't
[1:08:45] remarry you'd be surprised what
[1:08:47] doctrines is in this
[1:08:51] message I had to face a whole church one
[1:08:54] time in a ministers meeting up over a
[1:08:56] doctrine of one
[1:08:58] thing and they called his brother's
[1:09:01] name and I told him later that I
[1:09:03] defended him and they said he couldn't
[1:09:07] preach and I said well how
[1:09:11] come you know any
[1:09:14] problem you know is there any problem
[1:09:18] yep problem is cuz he ain't never been
[1:09:22] married
[1:09:25] listen you mean that's the reason you're
[1:09:27] saying he can't
[1:09:28] preach that he never been
[1:09:31] married
[1:09:32] right I said well Paul wasn't
[1:09:36] married oldest brother he lambasted me
[1:09:38] in the pull pit right in front of
[1:09:41] everybody Paul was married he was a
[1:09:43] member of the Sanhedrin court and he was
[1:09:46] married I said brother brandham said he
[1:09:49] wasn't I said one day I'll find it we
[1:09:51] didn't have the computers I found it I
[1:09:54] poked it in his nose and let him read
[1:09:57] it brother R said Paul
[1:10:00] said I got to right to marry but said I
[1:10:04] won't Jesus wasn't
[1:10:09] married that's what I mean see people
[1:10:12] Willet with their own ideas it don't
[1:10:13] make no difference what what even
[1:10:15] logical
[1:10:17] sense they'll stick with their own
[1:10:20] ideas and doing
[1:10:22] things look
[1:10:25] what happens about this
[1:10:27] lady let's read it let's read number
[1:10:31] nine
[1:10:35] first flashing red lights of his
[1:10:39] coming I said I I put these out last
[1:10:41] night so you can argue what you want
[1:10:43] to a man that's married to his wife
[1:10:47] there are not no longer two they're
[1:10:50] one and a man that'll run out after
[1:10:53] another the
[1:10:54] woman let's get both of them him and
[1:10:59] her he automatically separates himself
[1:11:02] from his
[1:11:05] wife if he runs
[1:11:07] out and a woman that runs out with
[1:11:10] another
[1:11:11] man now that means they're married
[1:11:14] right you understand hubby wife
[1:11:17] everybody with
[1:11:19] me she's dead to her husband
[1:11:28] see a lot of people don't need the grace
[1:11:30] of marriage and divorce to be set free
[1:11:32] from women that they're messed up with I
[1:11:35] can prove that in the
[1:11:37] Bible I've done been proving it to you
[1:11:40] if he's got a legal right to put her
[1:11:43] away hey I got the quotes on down I know
[1:11:46] the message brother Brandon say you can
[1:11:48] put your wife away for cutting
[1:11:50] her right but he said you can't remarry
[1:11:53] right
[1:11:54] I love
[1:11:57] them but he put her away and said honor
[1:12:00] of God to do
[1:12:03] so he says because she's
[1:12:06] unclean right just cutting your
[1:12:10] hair come on but look and a woman that
[1:12:13] runs out with another man she's dead to
[1:12:16] her husband she's denied her own flesh
[1:12:18] she's cut away from him that's right in
[1:12:20] the day of judgment we'll have to answer
[1:12:23] for it
[1:12:25] now you know what scripture he's
[1:12:27] using go back to number eight now 1
[1:12:30] Timothy
[1:12:33] 5:6 but she that liveth in pleasure
[1:12:36] check the background and see what I'm
[1:12:37] talking
[1:12:39] about but she that liveth in pleasure is
[1:12:42] dead while she
[1:12:44] liveth all
[1:12:47] right she's dead while she's
[1:12:49] living if she lives in pleasure that's
[1:12:52] the scripture he's refering referring
[1:12:58] to so then you tell me don't come up to
[1:13:00] me and tell me and say well a man can't
[1:13:02] put his wife away for committing
[1:13:04] adultery can't
[1:13:06] remarry I say I don't agree with you you
[1:13:09] can put her away for
[1:13:11] fornication and I agree with you but I
[1:13:14] don't agree with the way it's
[1:13:16] used here come brother Dale again
[1:13:21] okay this brother married this woman and
[1:13:24] they had I think 10 kids we will use a
[1:13:27] number nine where it won't get
[1:13:29] involved nine 10
[1:13:32] kids one day he decided he wanted to get
[1:13:35] him another
[1:13:40] soulmate he come up and used that she
[1:13:42] wasn't true to him before they
[1:13:45] married now if she didn't tell
[1:13:49] him he's
[1:13:51] right but if she told him he can't use
[1:13:54] it 20 years later uhuh don't talk to me
[1:13:58] I'm too
[1:14:00] old even if you're talking about the
[1:14:02] girl and the the vows and the thing the
[1:14:05] Bible says in the moment that it was
[1:14:09] heard that's right he can't come up 20
[1:14:12] years later and said forgot about that
[1:14:15] you wouldn't true to me when we married
[1:14:17] she said yeah but honey I told you all
[1:14:18] about
[1:14:21] it you think they ain't done in this
[1:14:27] message there a dummy woman to put up
[1:14:29] with a junk like
[1:14:31] that I'd have probably shot
[1:14:35] him or I'd have took him down to court
[1:14:37] and I said hey he don't want to live
[1:14:39] with me no more he got nine kids put it
[1:14:42] on him make him pay a hundred bucks a
[1:14:45] piece every week for the rest of his
[1:14:49] life I
[1:14:51] know I just don't play if you
[1:14:56] understand cuz it's too silly to
[1:15:03] play she must confess that to her
[1:15:07] husband if not he can put her
[1:15:11] away
[1:15:13] right what about it you still have your
[1:15:16] adultery and fornication as divided
[1:15:22] words
[1:15:24] you still holding that he can for
[1:15:27] fornication but he can't for adultery
[1:15:29] look at the next
[1:15:31] one I don't have a number on it Brothers
[1:15:34] questions and answers paragraph
[1:15:40] 76 I had a hot one that hot one on that
[1:15:45] down the other day in street they were
[1:15:47] talking about women and should women
[1:15:49] wear long hire and I said a woman that
[1:15:50] bobbed her hire husband had a right and
[1:15:53] a Bible right to divorce her that's
[1:15:55] right that's what the Bible said that's
[1:15:58] exactly right oh my Holy Ghost women
[1:15:59] sitting there just the way they've been
[1:16:01] taught that's all see yes that's Loosely
[1:16:05] and he said now if you would cut it if
[1:16:08] there's something wrong they had to cut
[1:16:10] her hair they had to shave they had to
[1:16:12] do all the things he's coming down uh he
[1:16:15] says she cuts her hair she dishonors her
[1:16:17] husband and a woman that's dishonorable
[1:16:19] has a legal right to be put away in
[1:16:21] divorce but he can't marry again
[1:16:28] now he can put it while his wife for
[1:16:32] well
[1:16:35] why as I said about the guy that Liv
[1:16:37] with his wife and had 10 kids I mean why
[1:16:40] did he want to he found a younger wife
[1:16:44] right right he didn't find no 80 year
[1:16:47] old
[1:16:49] woman I'm too S I know I'm too hard
[1:16:54] but I'm
[1:16:55] straight you can't come up and say well
[1:16:57] what do you
[1:16:58] believe you know what I
[1:17:00] believe I believe in Liv living right
[1:17:03] and being right
[1:17:05] amen but I believe in being it according
[1:17:07] to the word and what he's saying
[1:17:11] here look at this one and then we'll get
[1:17:14] to well I got two more paragraph 144
[1:17:18] marriage of the
[1:17:20] Lamb church has done the same committing
[1:17:22] spiritual fornication as a woman that
[1:17:24] would share her love from her husband to
[1:17:27] another
[1:17:29] man oh he calls that
[1:17:31] fornication spiritual part and he uses
[1:17:34] fornication and talks about sharing her
[1:17:36] love with her husband and another
[1:17:41] man do you understand what I'm getting
[1:17:44] at fornication is unclean living do you
[1:17:47] need those
[1:17:50] quotes unclean living
[1:17:55] right adultery is unclean living
[1:18:02] right either one of them the same thing
[1:18:05] am all right now
[1:18:10] watch you know uh that woman is not fit
[1:18:13] to be lived with you know that and when
[1:18:15] the church begins to share her
[1:18:17] fellowship with the world God is a
[1:18:19] jealous God he put Israel away because
[1:18:21] of that and his son will put the same
[1:18:23] thing same same thing away he's going to
[1:18:26] have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle
[1:18:28] in her amen she's holy Washed by the
[1:18:31] blood of his own self that's right and
[1:18:33] we see where we stand the wedding
[1:18:36] getting ready to come I have made this
[1:18:41] statement I was listening the other day
[1:18:43] in
[1:18:45] 1982 where I was preaching on the
[1:18:49] seals I made a statement then I'll make
[1:18:52] a statement now
[1:18:55] now anybody that has a marital
[1:19:00] situation I have always told you you got
[1:19:03] to go between you and God don't come to
[1:19:06] me cuz I have no fix I don't have no
[1:19:09] quick fix right I don't have no gray
[1:19:13] areas I don't have no things I've been
[1:19:16] accused of a lot of it but one of these
[1:19:17] days you'll understand why I do things
[1:19:19] the way I do on other things but but
[1:19:23] we'll get to
[1:19:26] that when I told you I've always told
[1:19:29] you you go to God you talk to him
[1:19:32] brother R said there's ways been made
[1:19:34] before in
[1:19:38] this you can't explain marriage and
[1:19:42] divorce how can you explain that Rahab
[1:19:45] the
[1:19:46] Harlot which was a prostitute a
[1:19:51] married an Israeli General that's
[1:19:58] right and out of there come the lineage
[1:20:01] to come down to Christ right you can't
[1:20:04] explain
[1:20:06] that you can't explain Ruth and
[1:20:11] Boaz you can't explain
[1:20:14] it there are certain things you just
[1:20:17] might as well just leave it alone right
[1:20:21] and ask God to work it out right that's
[1:20:23] it but I have made this statement I will
[1:20:25] rephrase
[1:20:27] it when it comes to the change of the
[1:20:31] body if we're not right in marriage and
[1:20:33] divorce we're not going de change change
[1:20:37] change I didn't say Rapture I had no
[1:20:40] intentions of
[1:20:41] that everybody that is Born Again dies
[1:20:45] and goes by the grave will come up in a
[1:20:47] Rapture right
[1:20:50] right if you have the real New Birth
[1:20:53] right all
[1:20:54] right but see these bodies are so
[1:20:57] connected to this
[1:20:59] earth until we've got to have the grace
[1:21:02] of marriage and
[1:21:05] divorce not
[1:21:08] disgrace amen and remember Grace is a
[1:21:11] revelation right Grace is not for the
[1:21:15] future right really Grace is not for
[1:21:18] even present
[1:21:20] tense Grace is for theast CHR right amen
[1:21:24] if we can believe there's Grace for a
[1:21:26] new
[1:21:28] birth why can't we believe there's Grace
[1:21:31] for marriage and divorce right
[1:21:33] amen now not to go on and do and do that
[1:21:37] and everybody's got it all figured
[1:21:40] out my old Uncle he was a Pentecostal
[1:21:45] preacher and he married and had some
[1:21:50] kids he divorced her and married another
[1:21:53] woman well you know they wouldn't let
[1:21:55] him
[1:21:55] preach you remember the old days they
[1:21:58] didn't do
[1:21:59] that and they told him the only way he
[1:22:01] could justify that was divorce the
[1:22:04] second wife and go back and marry the
[1:22:06] first
[1:22:08] wife and that's what he done and they
[1:22:10] let him
[1:22:11] preach you see my brother around said
[1:22:13] misinterpreted
[1:22:16] theology our
[1:22:18] ideas it's okie dokie because I think it
[1:22:22] it ain't oky doie because I think it is
[1:22:25] what he says that's right it's whether
[1:22:28] or not he's
[1:22:29] right all
[1:22:32] right but watch what he says on marriage
[1:22:35] and
[1:22:36] divorce and I'll end it paragraph
[1:22:41] 256 I want to end this part because this
[1:22:44] is Wednesday night we'll carry it on and
[1:22:45] we'll have questions and answers so you
[1:22:47] bring your questions I I love questions
[1:22:50] I don't mind saying I don't know
[1:22:53] Aaron Roberts he's probably listening in
[1:22:56] first time I talked to him on the phone
[1:22:57] he asked me a question I said I don't
[1:22:59] know he said wait just a minute now he
[1:23:02] said everybody tell me brother Dell
[1:23:04] knows everything I said well somebody
[1:23:06] told you
[1:23:08] wrong CU Brother D don't know
[1:23:10] everything
[1:23:12] yeah notice he can put her away but she
[1:23:15] cannot put him
[1:23:17] away watch he did it and proved it in
[1:23:20] the days when Luther Wesley in Pentecost
[1:23:23] now you're coming up to the spiritual
[1:23:27] right but remember your natural times
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:33] spiritual
[1:23:35] okay when they refuse to become the
[1:23:37] further part of him by having spiritual
[1:23:39] intercourse after a fire to become
[1:23:42] pregnated with the further part of the
[1:23:44] word you understand she refuse the
[1:23:46] Lutheran Church refused for Christ to
[1:23:48] have any more Desire with her Luther
[1:23:51] refused it and let me say this going to
[1:23:54] call me something anyhow so is it today
[1:23:56] that every one of them that failed to
[1:23:58] take that word they refuse Christ and
[1:24:01] any woman that refuses a man his child
[1:24:04] has a right to be put away right to be
[1:24:07] excuse me has no right to be a wife to
[1:24:09] him amen you remember in the Bible when
[1:24:11] the King married Esther because she
[1:24:13] wouldn't come out she refused to come
[1:24:17] out see same thing is it when a woman
[1:24:19] that refuses to be wife to her husband
[1:24:22] what did he put Luther away for you've
[1:24:24] read marriage and
[1:24:27] divorce he put Luther away not
[1:24:31] Luther right quotes kill you not Luther
[1:24:36] the Lutheran that denominated and died
[1:24:39] he put them away right he divorced them
[1:24:43] right and he married the
[1:24:47] methodus when they refused he divorced
[1:24:49] them and married to Pentecostals yeah
[1:24:53] right the Pentecostals refused it now
[1:24:55] it's left up to a little bitty
[1:24:57] bride in the end time to believe it and
[1:25:00] to really be his
[1:25:04] wife and stay in that
[1:25:08] order let me give you two scriptures
[1:25:10] Jeremiah 3:8 go ahead and pull it and I
[1:25:14] saw when they had caused whereby
[1:25:16] backsliding Israel committed adultery
[1:25:19] and I put her
[1:25:21] away so God put Israel away for
[1:25:24] committing
[1:25:27] adultery
[1:25:29] right you said but wait a minute he's
[1:25:31] coming back in the end time he doesn't
[1:25:33] marry her back his wife that's right
[1:25:36] you're out of your
[1:25:38] scriptures they come up as
[1:25:41] servants not
[1:25:43] wife he hadn't broke his
[1:25:47] scriptures cuz he tells you not to go
[1:25:50] back that is Deuteronomy 2 4 And1 if you
[1:25:53] want to read
[1:25:55] it he tells you flatly not to do
[1:25:59] that not to take a woman back after
[1:26:02] she's been put away read Revelations 2:
[1:26:05] 21-22 we'll
[1:26:07] quit and I gave her space to repent of
[1:26:09] her
[1:26:13] fornication I gave her space to repent
[1:26:15] of her fornication and she repented not
[1:26:18] behold I cast her into a
[1:26:21] bed and them that commit adultery with
[1:26:24] her into Great Tribulation God can use
[1:26:27] fornication and
[1:26:29] adultery as an interchangeable word in
[1:26:31] his very
[1:26:34] scriptures see I believe we must use it
[1:26:37] to be able to understand see then when
[1:26:40] Luther refused the Lutheran refused to
[1:26:43] go
[1:26:45] on God put it
[1:26:48] away all
[1:26:50] right that's why now I've I've got to
[1:26:54] use a word that I don't
[1:26:56] understand but I do the best I can
[1:26:59] because it's all I can
[1:27:01] understand there are some parts about
[1:27:06] polygamy that I don't fully
[1:27:11] understand but I do understand one
[1:27:15] thing it is not legal to have more than
[1:27:18] one human body connection
[1:27:22] so what are you going to
[1:27:25] do if he doesn't have a legal right to
[1:27:28] put her
[1:27:30] away and he divorces her and marries
[1:27:32] another he's got two women now the world
[1:27:35] still sees that right right I mean come
[1:27:39] on you go down to the courthouse you got
[1:27:40] number one on record number two on
[1:27:42] record right they're still keeping up
[1:27:44] with it but in God he can set the
[1:27:48] records
[1:27:50] clean that's why brother R says he
[1:27:54] can but said she
[1:28:00] can't he said you got you double
[1:28:05] Covenant no matter where we're at under
[1:28:07] the New Testament I'm ending it this way
[1:28:10] I had to preach to get it
[1:28:12] back double
[1:28:14] Covenant does not talk of Salvation in
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:19] soul now come on
[1:28:23] I preached two hours to get that quote
[1:28:25] is in the message this morning I just
[1:28:27] didn't bring
[1:28:31] it
[1:28:33] see
[1:28:35] Church all things must be made right
[1:28:39] that's right yes sir
[1:28:42] here you can't put it in the wrong
[1:28:46] place you'll never come out in
[1:28:50] anything he can put us away
[1:28:52] brother R said anytime he wants to
[1:28:55] that's right but said how dare us try to
[1:28:58] put him away and try to make
[1:29:01] it we can't do it that's right cuz we
[1:29:04] are the bride
[1:29:08] amen so then there's where we
[1:29:12] stand stand on the basis of one
[1:29:17] thing his word is Right amen that's
[1:29:20] right he will stay with his word
[1:29:23] amen if he gave the man the right to do
[1:29:26] it he gave it to him right not because
[1:29:30] of
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:35] polygamy that was done away in
[1:29:38] Christ but because he's still
[1:29:42] typing are you with
[1:29:47] me he's still
[1:29:50] typing he t Christ in the church one man
[1:29:54] one
[1:29:55] woman he'll holds that all the way down
[1:29:57] through but just remember he's got a
[1:30:00] many membered body
[1:30:04] right we can't put him
[1:30:07] away but he can put us away for
[1:30:10] Spiritual fornication and he did the
[1:30:12] lutherans and married to
[1:30:15] Methodist now was he free and what he
[1:30:17] done that's what I ask a man up
[1:30:20] in ten see one time when we were
[1:30:23] discussing marriage and
[1:30:25] divorce he said I'll take the scripture
[1:30:27] and tear you apart I said I'm sure you
[1:30:31] can but you got a couple scriptures you
[1:30:33] got to
[1:30:34] face you
[1:30:36] know and that's where he went to
[1:30:38] Deuteronomy
[1:30:39] 24 and he said why one of his cords did
[1:30:42] he didn't do it he said why in
[1:30:44] Deuteronomy 24 said tells a man tells
[1:30:46] her that a woman could put her away
[1:30:48] husband marry
[1:30:49] again I said let's read that
[1:30:52] let's read it
[1:30:54] now Deuteronomy
[1:30:56] 24 can you pull it up
[1:31:02] brother when a man had taken a wife and
[1:31:05] married her and it come to pass that she
[1:31:09] find no favor in his eyes because he had
[1:31:13] found some uncleanness in her then let
[1:31:16] him write her a bill of divorcement and
[1:31:19] give it in her hand and send her out out
[1:31:21] of his
[1:31:25] house and when she has departed out of
[1:31:27] his house she may go and be another
[1:31:30] man's
[1:31:37] wife that's not a
[1:31:39] mistranslation that's a
[1:31:42] truth but it's a misstated truth not by
[1:31:45] God or
[1:31:47] Prophet it's misstated by our
[1:31:50] minds cuz we're read meeting that it's
[1:31:55] okay
[1:31:57] right she may go and be another man's
[1:31:59] why we're reading it with our
[1:32:06] mind what do you think you think it's
[1:32:11] okay she departed out of his house she
[1:32:14] may go and be another man's wife you
[1:32:17] know what brother Brown said he said she
[1:32:19] will marry yep that's right
[1:32:23] you said I now what are you going to do
[1:32:25] I'm going to keep reading scripture roll
[1:32:27] it on
[1:32:29] up now let's give a little
[1:32:34] illustration if the latter husband
[1:32:37] number two right first husband put her
[1:32:41] away some
[1:32:42] uncleanness right everybody with me
[1:32:45] right number two latter second
[1:32:50] guy and if the latter husband hate her
[1:32:53] and write her a bill of divorcement she
[1:32:55] got two bills of
[1:32:57] divorcement and give it to her hand and
[1:33:00] sendeth her out of his
[1:33:03] house or if the let husband
[1:33:11] die which took her to be his
[1:33:14] wife if he died she's got one
[1:33:19] husband my fingers right on that you
[1:33:22] know I mean you
[1:33:25] know see if the latter husband die now
[1:33:30] can she go back to the first
[1:33:33] one we're going to read the scripture
[1:33:36] her former husband which sent her away
[1:33:39] may not take her again to be his wife
[1:33:42] after that she is defiled for that is
[1:33:45] abomination before the Lord and thou
[1:33:47] shalt not cause the land to sin which
[1:33:49] the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
[1:33:54] inheritance if her second husband dies
[1:33:56] why can't her first husband take her
[1:34:01] back you're commanded not to take a
[1:34:04] woman
[1:34:06] back is that right you're commanded of
[1:34:09] God not to take a woman back when she
[1:34:11] commits adultery against you you do it
[1:34:12] on your own
[1:34:15] account you can hoodie do all you want
[1:34:18] to and say well I'm typ in Christ I'm
[1:34:20] going to love her no you just want
[1:34:28] her you see what I'm talking about the
[1:34:30] Bible answers his own self it cannot be
[1:34:33] saying that she may go be another man's
[1:34:36] wife and justifying
[1:34:40] it CU it was why
[1:34:42] can't her first husband take her back
[1:34:45] after the second husband
[1:34:50] died can't do it
[1:34:52] it you see we are in all of this because
[1:34:55] of misinterpreted Theology and that is
[1:34:58] the only scripture that I know of that
[1:35:02] can be related to Moses and his marriage
[1:35:04] and
[1:35:06] divorce but if you'll read
[1:35:09] that roll it back down and reread
[1:35:18] it found some uncleanness in her
[1:35:24] it was not for burning the bread or
[1:35:26] doing what they wanted to do or any
[1:35:28] cause it was some scriptural reason some
[1:35:34] uncleanness I don't want to get too far
[1:35:37] but I want to warn these
[1:35:41] girls because that does not
[1:35:45] mean the uncleanness in that woman I can
[1:35:49] prove it by the Bible it does not mean
[1:35:52] she had to have intercourse with a man
[1:35:55] that's
[1:36:05] right it means she simply let him handle
[1:36:09] her in the wrong
[1:36:13] way may I say it that
[1:36:17] way you young girls let no boys handle
[1:36:21] you
[1:36:22] wrong you boys remember don't go after
[1:36:24] the
[1:36:26] girls it don't have to go that doesn't
[1:36:29] have to refer to sexual
[1:36:34] intercourse Young's literal translation
[1:36:41] says
[1:36:48] nudity
[1:36:50] especially
[1:36:52] the
[1:36:56] pudenda girls don't let boys touch
[1:37:04] you you ask me out of church I'll tell
[1:37:06] you what that penda mean if you don't
[1:37:08] understand you're not an adult
[1:37:11] anyway I'll go ahead and say it pudenda
[1:37:14] means
[1:37:16] lips all he has to do is some boy handle
[1:37:20] a girl
[1:37:22] not these lips will be a
[1:37:27] dummy
[1:37:30] Pender external parts of a
[1:37:33] female are not to be fooled with by
[1:37:37] mankind girls remember
[1:37:40] that don't let a boy fundle as we call
[1:37:44] the
[1:37:50] word that's how strict God
[1:37:54] is and his word is true come on
[1:37:58] Brothers I hope you understand me I'm
[1:38:01] not trying to convince you of
[1:38:03] nothing I'm trying to preach the
[1:38:08] gospel but you see
[1:38:10] Church you say well I never did need to
[1:38:12] Grace of marriage and divorce I've been
[1:38:13] through right all my life what about
[1:38:16] spiritual was you ever in a Baptist
[1:38:18] Church did you ever have a Doctrine of a
[1:38:21] Baptist did you ever have a Pentecostal
[1:38:23] a presbyterian a delight or who
[1:38:26] eyes
[1:38:31] right you see misinterpreted
[1:38:35] theology Mis
[1:38:38] understanding and putting it that it's
[1:38:40] got to be our
[1:38:42] way has brought us to the place where
[1:38:44] we're
[1:38:49] at but you know what
[1:38:52] I serve a God that can make all things
[1:38:57] right that's why I've always said you
[1:38:59] know the people in the message they got
[1:39:01] these seed doctrines and they got if you
[1:39:03] was born from Adam and Eve you could be
[1:39:07] saved but if you was born from even to
[1:39:10] Beast you can't be
[1:39:16] saved I don't give a hoot who my daddy
[1:39:20] is because I found my
[1:39:24] daddy I found my daddy in
[1:39:28] Salvation not in the natural
[1:39:31] world I love my
[1:39:34] daddy love to see him sit right
[1:39:37] here but I love my spiritual
[1:39:42] daddy Mama's doctrines are
[1:39:44] fine she got on to my wife one day and
[1:39:47] said I just don't believe that old stuff
[1:39:49] about that serpent seed y'all talking
[1:39:53] about well she didn't
[1:39:56] remember how she used to tell us about
[1:40:01] daddy daddy told my
[1:40:05] mother he didn't know a brother random
[1:40:07] or
[1:40:10] nothing he told my
[1:40:12] mother what happened in the
[1:40:17] garden you know why he a 45 year- old
[1:40:21] man before he
[1:40:23] married he knew what it
[1:40:27] was and he told her what
[1:40:30] happened well she never said no more
[1:40:32] once my wife said well you better listen
[1:40:34] to what Mr Dale said because he did
[1:40:38] believe
[1:40:40] that serpent seed is not a new doctrine
[1:40:43] I've always said since I heard the
[1:40:45] prophet that those Pharisees knew
[1:40:47] exactly about the serpent seat cuz why
[1:40:49] would they say we wern't born of
[1:40:54] fornication right they believed it they
[1:40:57] knew what it was that uh Rabbi Richmond
[1:41:01] and whatever it was up there brother
[1:41:03] Bisal he
[1:41:04] said to
[1:41:06] think of sex being the original sin is
[1:41:10] no
[1:41:11] problem but said you brought up a new
[1:41:13] point when you say sex with the Beast he
[1:41:17] said that's something for us to think
[1:41:19] about you know
[1:41:21] cuz see they believed
[1:41:24] it if you don't believe in serpent seed
[1:41:27] and sex and
[1:41:30] problems I've always said it you can put
[1:41:33] your little kids a boy and a girl in the
[1:41:37] bathtub until they're about 2 years old
[1:41:41] but after then you better make them say
[1:41:44] in different
[1:41:47] bathtubs they begin to figure out that
[1:41:50] there's a little difference in each
[1:41:54] other so the safe
[1:41:57] way two different
[1:41:59] bathtubs
[1:42:01] right that way you don't have to worry
[1:42:03] about it no but my kid wouldn't do
[1:42:06] nothing is your kid born with a
[1:42:09] Halo my kids was born with a Halo my
[1:42:12] grandkids was born with a Halo my great
[1:42:14] grandkids was born with a Halo and they
[1:42:16] held up by
[1:42:17] horns right they're held up by horns
[1:42:20] because a
[1:42:23] human think about it fornication or
[1:42:28] adultery is an interchangeable
[1:42:31] word and he can put us away for
[1:42:33] fornication he can put us away for
[1:42:36] adultery go you better remember more
[1:42:39] scriptures you
[1:42:41] know you remember that says that till
[1:42:44] come in that day and say let us take
[1:42:47] your
[1:42:47] name to take away our reproach
[1:42:51] now what does that
[1:42:53] mean you remember they told Jesus you
[1:42:55] know talking about in the par let us

[1:43:03] a reproach for an unwed mother to have
[1:43:06] you know unwed person have a baby that
[1:43:09] used to be it's not anymore but that
[1:43:10] used to be a reproach but there's no
[1:43:13] reproach for a woman that's got 10 kids
