[23:14] [Music]
[23:17] God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign
[23:24] from

[23:33] [Music]
[23:36] I want to greet you all in the name of
[23:38] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's my
[23:40] privilege to be here amongst you
[23:43] I'm not much unpreliminaries
[23:45] um if you're standing turn to Hebrews
[23:47] the 10th chapter
[23:49] and read verses 5 through 10.
[23:52] [Music]
[23:55] and my wife and I had been we've been in
[23:57] we've been going to end you for the last
[23:59] 17 years normally when we go we spend uh
[24:03] minimum of a month and a half sometimes
[24:05] as long as two months
[24:07] and then when we're we're always glad to
[24:10] get home
[24:11] so
[24:13] Hebrews the 10th chapter starting at
[24:15] verse 5.
[24:17] it says wherefore when he cometh into
[24:18] the world he says sacrifice and
[24:20] offerings thou what is not but a body
[24:22] hast thou prepared me
[24:24] and burn offerings and sacrifices of our
[24:27] sins thou Hast no pleasure
[24:28] then said I lo I come in the volume of
[24:31] the book that is written of me to do thy
[24:33] will o God
[24:35] and let's pray
[24:37] our most gracious and loving Heavenly
[24:39] Father it is our privilege
[24:41] to gather ourselves together in your
[24:43] presence around your word and then Lord
[24:46] to hear what you'd have for us this
[24:48] morning
[24:49] it's Fallen my lot to stand before the
[24:51] purchase of your blood but Lord I want
[24:54] you to be you speaking and not me
[24:56] you placed a thought on My Heart Lord
[24:58] but it's going to take you to be able to
[25:00] express it and make it so that the
[25:02] people can understand so Lord we're
[25:04] asking for your for your sovereignty
[25:06] we're asking for your presence and
[25:07] anointing the Lord we all may in your
[25:10] presence be able to enjoy your presence
[25:12] and enjoy your word
[25:13] for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[25:17] you can be seated
[25:22] it's interesting in Hebrews it talks
[25:24] about therefore when he cometh into the
[25:26] world you say a sacrifice and offering
[25:28] thou what is not but a body hast thou
[25:31] prepared me
[25:32] and when I was thinking about that we
[25:34] have to realize that we are God has
[25:36] created another body
[25:38] and we are that body
[25:40] God from the beginning of the world he
[25:42] knew who you were he knew the color of
[25:44] your hair he knew everything everything
[25:46] there is to know about you but what he
[25:48] has done he has taken his seed and
[25:50] placed it in you and the seed that he
[25:53] has placed in you is himself
[25:55] I mean the seed we have is the seed of
[25:57] God well what can the seed of God
[25:59] produce if it produces the life of the
[26:02] seed then the only thing we can produce
[26:04] is God
[26:06] in Jesus Christ when he was born he was
[26:08] God he was he he he was born the Son of
[26:11] God he God bypassed the the fleshly
[26:14] nature I mean he in any way he placed a
[26:17] seed within Mary he calls that seed to
[26:20] grow and that seed when they've matured
[26:22] all of a sudden it came forth when it
[26:24] was born but he when he was came forth
[26:26] he was the son of God but see this
[26:28] relates to us in so many different ways
[26:31] brother Branham in the rising of the son
[26:34] he makes a statement he says in the
[26:36] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[26:38] church they'll have to be a sheave waved
[26:40] again in the last day and when I was
[26:42] looking at that in the bride coming of
[26:44] Christ
[26:45] it's talking about Jesus Christ himself
[26:47] so coming in Bride form until the bride
[26:50] becomes the literal manifestation of him
[26:53] it's not about us it's about him it's
[26:56] not what we do for God it's what we
[26:58] allowed him to do through us but we have
[27:00] to learn to yield ourselves we have to
[27:02] recognize Who We Are
[27:04] we've had we've had the message God
[27:06] through the God sent a prophet unto us
[27:08] in this generation and and he gone
[27:11] through that Prophet was trying to tell
[27:12] the bride this is who you are yes you
[27:15] are not just Sinners saved by grace you
[27:17] are Sons and Daughters of God that have
[27:19] been fully restored to your rightful
[27:21] position with God you're coming to the
[27:23] place where you have free access to God
[27:25] you are his child brother Branham in one
[27:27] place he says God would breath to rather
[27:29] listen to his child than he would the
[27:31] Angels when we go to our father
[27:36] if we had servants if we had a business
[27:38] and we had people working for us and
[27:40] they came with suggestions that's one
[27:42] thing but when all of a sudden they
[27:43] asked the son I go to my father hey Dad
[27:45] do you think we should do it this way or
[27:46] that way all he's willing to listen to
[27:48] me because I'm his son well it's come
[27:52] down to the place now where God's
[27:53] willing to listen to us but actually
[27:55] it's come to the place now where
[27:57] actually what we are supposed to be
[27:59] doing is listening to him we are
[28:01] supposed to be led by him we are
[28:03] supposed to be guided by him in every
[28:05] aspect this is Jesus Christ had to
[28:07] follow the leadership of the god that
[28:08] dwelt inside of him we have to learn how
[28:10] to follow the leadership of God in our
[28:12] lives
[28:13] it could be coming to the place where
[28:15] there is no difference here
[28:17] that as God directed Jesus Christ he now
[28:20] must direct us because now we are this
[28:23] body of Jesus Christ we are the we are
[28:25] the body of God upon the face of this
[28:27] Earth and that's what God sent the
[28:29] prophet to tell us
[28:30] he began to tell us brother Bannerman
[28:33] brother Branham in many places he says
[28:35] you know it's not about me it's not
[28:36] about what I do but it's a but it's
[28:38] because I allow the god that is inside
[28:40] of me to come and express himself
[28:42] through me and the words that he began
[28:44] to express especially after the seals he
[28:47] began to try and tell the bride this is
[28:49] who you are
[28:51] you are not going to be the sons of God
[28:53] you are the sons of God when you were
[28:56] born you were Sons and Daughters of God
[28:57] but you had to come into this you had
[29:00] you had to be born in flesh so that you
[29:02] could develop a character but when you
[29:04] were born you were Sons and Daughters of
[29:06] God
[29:07] because God seed was in you your parents
[29:10] brought forth the body you live in but
[29:13] God had placed his seed in you from the
[29:15] from the foundations of the world and
[29:17] what he is now he's trying to take that
[29:19] seed that he has placed in you and bring
[29:21] that seed into full manifestation to
[29:23] full expression and on that seed that
[29:25] was placed in you comes into full
[29:27] manifestation expression you will be the
[29:29] manifestation of God but we have Jesus
[29:33] Christ did only what the father showed
[29:34] him to do and that's where the bride now
[29:36] has to come
[29:38] God sent the prophet and the prophet
[29:40] delivered the message that he that God
[29:42] intended for him to deliver to us
[29:45] he came to tell us that this is who you
[29:47] are
[29:48] it's like when I was raised in the
[29:50] Baptist Church I was a sinner
[29:52] saved by grace the emphasis was on
[29:55] sinner I will always be a sinner
[29:58] well I still am a sinner saved by grace
[30:01] but this message taught me something
[30:03] which is vastly superior to that he said
[30:06] you were a Son of God when you were born
[30:08] you were a Son of God and now you've
[30:09] been restored to your rightful position
[30:11] as as a Son of God but now we have to
[30:14] come into the position where we actually
[30:16] will accept what God says that we are to
[30:18] what brother Brown says another place he
[30:20] says we look we live way below our
[30:22] privileges
[30:23] because as Sons and Daughters of God we
[30:27] have control over Satan
[30:29] we don't have to put up with him
[30:32] but I mean as a kind of a funny way of
[30:36] expressing my wife when they when I mean
[30:39] she had had a cough
[30:40] and she was coughing and coughing and
[30:42] was keeping me awake
[30:44] well I like my sleep
[30:47] and so she was nice enough she went to
[30:49] the front room and she laid on the
[30:51] recliner and she was you know she was
[30:53] trying to let me sleep well her coughing
[30:55] was still keeping me away
[30:57] so what I do I went into where she was
[31:00] at and I said Satan I'm tired of you
[31:02] being here I'm tired of you keeping me
[31:04] awake you have to leave because now I'm
[31:06] telling you get out
[31:08] and that's exactly what I told him she
[31:10] quit coughing I got to go to strip but
[31:12] go to bed and go back to sleep but it
[31:15] was I have the authority
[31:17] I have the authority by virtue of who I
[31:19] am because I am a Son of God I have
[31:23] authority because Jesus has given me
[31:24] that Authority I have the authority to
[31:27] take Satan and tell him to leave and
[31:29] when I command him to leave he has no
[31:31] choice not because of who I am but
[31:33] because of what I represent I am a Son
[31:36] of God I know that I am a Son of God and
[31:38] therefore because I know I am a Son of
[31:40] God I can exercise The Authority as a
[31:43] son and Satan has to Satan doesn't have
[31:46] to listen to me he has to listen to the
[31:48] one who has called me he has to listen
[31:50] to the Jesus Christ that dwells inside
[31:52] of me and when that Jesus Christ inside
[31:55] of me anoints his word that I speak
[31:57] that's no longer me speaking it's God
[31:59] speaking through me and Satan has to
[32:01] obey that he has to obey that and this
[32:05] comes down to all of us Satan has to
[32:07] obey us because of who we are because we
[32:11] are the seed of God we are the God's
[32:12] representation upon the face of this
[32:14] Earth
[32:16] we talk about it it talks about it it
[32:18] says a body has now prepared me
[32:21] well that relates to us
[32:24] because God we are the body that God now
[32:26] now resides in I mean you said where is
[32:30] God I'm looking at him
[32:32] I'm looking at the body of God himself
[32:34] because God dwells in you when you were
[32:38] born you were Sons and Daughters of God
[32:40] you had to come through you had you were
[32:42] born in flesh that gives us Natures that
[32:44] we continuously fight but because but
[32:46] later on we meet we through the gospel
[32:49] we responded to the gospel when the
[32:51] message came across our path where he
[32:53] responded to that but until you receive
[32:55] the Holy Spirit
[32:57] you're not born again
[32:59] but once you receive the Holy Spirit
[33:01] then you all of a sudden then you are
[33:03] born into the place where now you are
[33:05] the sons and daughters of God up until
[33:07] that point you you can fumble around and
[33:09] do what you want to but once God comes
[33:12] and lives inside of you
[33:14] once that new birth takes place in you
[33:16] there has to be a change in your life if
[33:20] there's no change there's no conversion
[33:21] but once there's a conversion once Jesus
[33:24] Christ comes inside of you in the Holy
[33:26] Spirit and all of a sudden begins to
[33:28] live his life out through you that
[33:30] becomes the difference
[33:32] we go and we begin to look at other
[33:34] bodies that God dwelt in we begin to
[33:37] look at Moses Moses was born for a
[33:39] specific purpose he was to be the
[33:41] deliverer of the children of Israel out
[33:43] of Egypt he didn't like his job
[33:46] he tried to refuse it once but you know
[33:48] God doesn't have plan B
[33:52] he called he chose and says you're going
[33:54] to do it he tried to talk his way out of
[33:56] him God says no you're going to do it
[33:57] anyway because I've ordered you to do
[33:59] that we look at the Prophet Jeremiah
[34:02] Jeremiah tells God he says you lied to
[34:04] me I didn't realize what I was going to
[34:06] have to live through because of my
[34:08] calling and Jeremiah tried to quit but
[34:11] all of a sudden he says there's
[34:12] something inside of my body there
[34:14] there's a word burning within me he says
[34:17] I can't do anything else but I happen to
[34:18] Proclaim what God had given to him well
[34:21] where are we at in this plan
[34:24] we are his body God placed his seed in
[34:27] you because that seed was placed in you
[34:29] he elected that seed he elected that
[34:32] seed to become what God intended for it
[34:34] to be and and this this now here here
[34:37] again it begins to apply unto us we have
[34:40] to be we have to start accepting
[34:43] Who We Are
[34:44] I mean I I find a lot of people in
[34:47] churches and probably probably not here
[34:49] but they hear they go in ahead and
[34:51] listen to The Prophet's message and oh
[34:52] yeah that was wonderful we pick out
[34:54] little things we we agree with here and
[34:56] we agree with there but we never apply
[34:58] it
[35:00] we never come down to the place we are
[35:02] accepting what God said we are once you
[35:05] begin to accept what you what God said
[35:07] that you are that changes thing because
[35:10] then all of a sudden then you realize
[35:12] you have the power and the authority
[35:14] over Satan you have the power and
[35:16] authority over sickness you have the
[35:18] power and authority over every over all
[35:20] the works of darkness but until you
[35:23] accept that
[35:25] you will never be able to manifest that
[35:28] until you begin to realize no I am a Son
[35:31] of God I am the body that God dwells in
[35:34] and because God dwells in me and if I
[35:36] can yield to the spirit of God that
[35:37] dwells in me I can I can command Satan
[35:40] in in in and Satan has to obey that
[35:42] because it's it's no longer me but it's
[35:45] him
[35:47] when we look at in in Isaiah it says
[35:49] it says unto us a child is born unto us
[35:52] the son is given the government shall be
[35:54] upon his shoulder his name Shall be
[35:56] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[35:59] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[36:01] Peace when Jesus Christ was born he was
[36:05] the son of God
[36:06] you know it's interesting in Jesus
[36:08] Christ within Jesus Christ he bypassed
[36:11] the fleshly birth okay the release it
[36:14] wasn't the relationship between God and
[36:16] Mary okay but so God placed within Mary
[36:19] a seed
[36:21] and that scene Mary had to carry that
[36:23] seed Mary had to carry that save until
[36:26] it comes would come to maturity until
[36:28] that seed could actually come into
[36:29] manifestation be born
[36:31] well see all of a sudden that's that's
[36:33] the same thing that happened down
[36:34] through the church ages God planted his
[36:36] Satan in the church on the day of
[36:38] Pentecost but what was the function of
[36:41] the church the church was to be the
[36:42] carrier of that life and since it was a
[36:45] carrier of that life the the church
[36:48] protected that that seed until until
[36:51] they could have come and reached
[36:52] maturity we're in the last age
[36:55] we're in the last days that seed that
[36:58] was planted on Pentecost must come to
[37:00] maturity it must come into full
[37:02] manifestation and that's where we're at
[37:05] in the bride coming of Jesus Christ
[37:07] Jesus Christ will soon come and live
[37:09] within the bride until it's no longer
[37:11] her but it's God living his life through
[37:13] her as God dwelts in Jesus Christ and
[37:16] expressed himself through Jesus Christ
[37:18] now he's going to come and he's going to
[37:19] express through us the bride the same
[37:22] thing it is he expressed through Jesus
[37:23] Christ
[37:26] and Hebrews and uh one it says in these
[37:30] half in these last days spoken unto us
[37:32] by his son who hath appointed air of All
[37:34] Things by whom he made all by whom he
[37:37] made the world Jesus Christ was in the
[37:39] logos form when he began to speak God
[37:42] had God had to go from a spirit form
[37:44] into some physical form and while in
[37:46] that physical form the process of
[37:48] creation began
[37:50] but he comes down and it comes on later
[37:52] on it says who being the brightness of
[37:54] his glory and the express image of his
[37:55] person and upholding All Things by his
[37:57] power when he invite so when he had by
[38:00] himself our sins he sat down with the
[38:02] right hand
[38:03] but Jesus Christ was the express image
[38:06] he was an exact duplication of what God
[38:08] is
[38:10] but see now he God has come into a new
[38:12] body
[38:13] that's us we are to become that
[38:16] expressed image we are to become that
[38:18] full manifestation of God
[38:21] I mean this is this is a big step I mean
[38:23] especially mentally speaking when you
[38:25] when you begin to claim that you are a
[38:27] son of God when you begin to recognize
[38:29] that you are a son you are a
[38:31] manifestation of God himself I mean we
[38:34] look at ourselves and says yeah I don't
[38:36] think so
[38:37] I mean there are days that
[38:40] um yeah I have my bad hair day so I
[38:41] still have a few
[38:43] but we come to the place where we have
[38:45] to begin to realize it's not about us
[38:48] it's about him
[38:50] Jesus Christ did only what the father
[38:52] showed him to do wherever he went
[38:55] whatever he did it was under the direct
[38:57] Authority and command of the god that
[38:59] dwelt in him
[39:01] God but brother Brown says in the
[39:03] scriptures he said he said he says Jesus
[39:05] Christ prayed often because he wanted to
[39:08] know what God's will is one of the time
[39:10] he told the disciples we have to go by
[39:12] way of Samaria
[39:14] Samaria was not in the direct route to
[39:16] where they were thinking they were going
[39:17] but God directed him to go there because
[39:20] there was a seed there that had to be
[39:22] ministered unto why do we go the places
[39:25] we go why are we directed by the spirits
[39:27] of the sum of the places we go because
[39:29] God has a seed someplace and God has
[39:31] wanted to express himself to those to
[39:34] the the people that are around you
[39:36] you know it's
[39:38] um
[39:39] brother Branham says because my sons and
[39:42] daughters of God he says we can create a
[39:44] world and go live on it well this
[39:47] universe couldn't couldn't tolerate ten
[39:49] thousand worlds
[39:51] um but he says we can create an
[39:53] atmosphere
[39:54] brother Branham one day he was his wife
[39:56] the family was all upset and everything
[39:58] was going on and so brother Brown just
[40:00] quietly he went over he put his hands
[40:02] upon his wife and he prayed silently for
[40:04] her he prayed for God's spirits to come
[40:06] now he created an atmosphere and slowly
[40:09] but surely he says all the the arguments
[40:12] with the kids all of that went by the
[40:13] wayside and all of a sudden I mean
[40:15] everything just settled down
[40:17] but see wherever we go we can create an
[40:21] atmosphere
[40:22] I don't like the atmosphere outside of
[40:25] the church
[40:26] I don't like Walmart I don't like going
[40:28] shopping I don't like a whole bunch of
[40:30] other things
[40:31] so what I try and do is I try and create
[40:33] an atmosphere
[40:35] so whenever I go to I try to be kind I
[40:37] try to be gentle I try to say good words
[40:39] I mean when you go to check out in your
[40:41] in a grocery store they're they're
[40:44] supposed to say Hi how are you
[40:46] it's probably just an automatic thing
[40:49] and so you respond back I'm doing great
[40:51] how are you doing
[40:52] and that kind of takes them back
[40:54] sometime I'm inviting them into my world
[40:57] I'm inviting them to experience what I
[41:00] experience because wherever I go I I try
[41:03] and have Jesus Christ I try and create
[41:05] an atmosphere where there's love and joy
[41:07] and peace and long suffering and
[41:09] gentleness and patience and meeting and
[41:11] so whenever I talk unto them I'm
[41:12] inviting them into my world
[41:14] and if they will respond to my world
[41:16] then we can draw them into the into into
[41:18] Jesus Christ and we can draw them into
[41:21] Jesus Christ if there's a seed there
[41:23] they will respond to that and all of a
[41:25] sudden then then they will become become
[41:27] an experience what we are
[41:30] Jesus Christ was every bit human
[41:32] brother Branham says he was all man and
[41:34] he was all God
[41:36] it talks about in in Hebrews he says who
[41:39] in the days of his flesh when he'd
[41:41] offered up prayers and supplications
[41:43] strong crying and tears unto him that
[41:44] was able to save from him death and that
[41:46] he heard he he was heard in that he
[41:49] feared
[41:50] uh though he were a son he had learned
[41:52] he obedience by the things that he
[41:54] suffered
[41:55] so his flesh had a different desire his
[41:59] flesh did not want to go to the Cross
[42:00] his flesh did not want to hang on the
[42:03] tree he knew what was waiting for him
[42:04] and that's why he prayed in the garden
[42:06] but he had to take his will the will of
[42:09] his flesh and submitted unto the will of
[42:11] the father but see sometimes this is
[42:13] where we have to come we do not
[42:15] necessarily want to go where God is
[42:17] directing our lives but if God is
[42:19] directing Our Lives it's not about us
[42:21] fulfilling our will and our desire knows
[42:24] about us fulfilling the desire and the
[42:25] will of God
[42:27] why do we go to India because that's
[42:29] where God directed me
[42:31] this last year if we went to India it
[42:33] was a very difficult trip for us I
[42:36] didn't I really in reality I didn't want
[42:38] to go
[42:39] but all of a sudden God put things in
[42:40] our in our pathway I mean the Visas
[42:42] hadn't expired so we had to get new
[42:44] though that went through no problem and
[42:46] then the finances came in well that was
[42:48] and so I figured well okay Lord whether
[42:50] I want to or not I'm going to India
[42:53] so we went there we spent a little over
[42:55] six weeks
[42:57] first three weeks wasn't too bad and
[42:59] then I got food poisoning
[43:00] so for the last two three weeks really I
[43:03] was very very sick then my wife came
[43:05] down with the flu that put her in bed
[43:07] for a week
[43:08] but we went when we went there I I
[43:11] accomplished what I believe God sent me
[43:12] to accomplish
[43:14] but it was not an easy trip this time
[43:16] and I was kind of fearful it was but
[43:19] anyway but here again it's taking my
[43:21] will and submitting into his will so
[43:23] Lord you have directed you have guided
[43:25] obviously you have a reason for me going
[43:27] and so there so therefore we win in
[43:31] other ministers I know they go different
[43:32] places and they have to minister a
[43:34] certain things but it's learning to take
[43:36] our will and submit it to the will of
[43:38] the father that dwells in us because God
[43:40] has a reason for that
[43:43] we know that Jesus Christ he had to be
[43:46] born of the lineage of David otherwise
[43:48] he wouldn't be able to sit on the throne
[43:49] of David in the Millennium he had to
[43:52] also be he had to be whipped for the
[43:54] purchase of our of our healing he had to
[43:57] he had he had to be born in flesh so
[43:59] that he could become arkansmen Redeemer
[44:01] and so all of these things Jesus Christ
[44:03] had to fulfill by his birth and and and
[44:05] then by his by his death and
[44:07] Resurrection
[44:10] when Jesus Christ came he he had a
[44:13] commission
[44:14] he mentions that he quoted from Isaiah
[44:17] but he said the spirit of the Lord is
[44:19] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[44:20] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[44:22] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[44:24] preached Deliverance of the captives the
[44:26] recovering of sight to the blind you so
[44:28] the Liberty them that are bruised and
[44:29] decreased acceptable year of the Lord
[44:33] John the Baptist was expecting the king
[44:36] they were and the disciples were
[44:38] expecting the king they were expecting
[44:40] him to go to sit upon the throne of
[44:42] David and to rule and Reign and get rid
[44:43] of all and get rid of all the Romans
[44:45] that was not for that time that time he
[44:48] had to come and redeem when he comes
[44:50] back this time no he's coming back in
[44:51] power and that's when he's going to set
[44:53] up the kingdom and that's when we will
[44:55] rule and reign with him for over a
[44:56] thousand years but when John the Baptist
[44:59] was in prison
[45:00] he sent some of his disciples and says
[45:03] are you the one that we're supposed to
[45:04] be looking for because you're not doing
[45:06] what we expecting you to do and so what
[45:08] did Jesus Christ do he healed the sick
[45:10] and he raised the dead and he performed
[45:12] different Miracles and he said now you
[45:14] go and show John what what I've done
[45:16] because I have come to fulfill that
[45:19] which which is but the scriptures has
[45:21] spoken to me that I was to fulfill
[45:23] but brother Branham keeps talking about
[45:25] the same commission that Jesus Christ
[45:26] had that is our commission
[45:29] it hasn't changed we are to be the
[45:32] continuation of the ministry of Jesus
[45:34] Christ so what are we supposed to be
[45:35] doing we're supposed to be going
[45:37] recovering of sight to the Blind and
[45:39] healing people and preaching cap
[45:40] Deliverance to capture we are supposed
[45:42] to presenting unto them the gospel and
[45:44] bringing them into the fellowship of
[45:45] Jesus Christ that is our commission
[45:52] it's interesting that Jesus Christ took
[45:54] it to the disciples
[45:56] and he gave them the authority
[45:58] he gave them the authority to go ahead
[46:01] and and to do the things that that God
[46:03] was doing through him
[46:05] and because he gave them the authority
[46:08] then they could then they could go about
[46:09] and they could do what the based upon
[46:12] the authority that that that they now
[46:14] possessed
[46:19] Charlie
[46:21] Jesus Christ before he was death
[46:25] he before he he before his crucifixion
[46:29] he talks in John the 17th chapter
[46:31] and and he talks about us here
[46:34] he says neither I pray I for these alone
[46:36] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[46:38] me through their word
[46:40] uh that they may be one as thou father
[46:43] art in me and I in thee that there may
[46:46] also be one in us that the world may
[46:49] believe that thou has sent me and the
[46:51] glory which thou gave us me I have given
[46:53] them that they may be one even as we are
[46:56] one i in them and thou and me that they
[46:59] may be made perfect in one
[47:03] through the whole through the baptism of
[47:05] the Holy Spirit
[47:07] that is when this that is when this um
[47:10] this Unity that is what that where this
[47:12] Oneness can take place
[47:14] because Jesus Christ in the Jesus Christ
[47:18] when he was born he was the son of God
[47:20] it wasn't until until John baptized him
[47:23] in the River Jordan that all of a sudden
[47:25] the spirit of God Came Upon him and
[47:27] that's when Jesus Christ literally
[47:28] became that's when Jesus Christ
[47:31] literally became one with the father
[47:33] because then all the fullness of the
[47:35] godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ
[47:38] well in the disciples yeah when they
[47:40] when you look at them I mean they were
[47:42] they were arguing and bickering and
[47:44] fighting who is going to be the greatest
[47:45] and who's going to sit on his right hand
[47:46] on the left hand and all these other
[47:48] types of stuff and this is not what God
[47:50] had in mind it wasn't an Earthly Kingdom
[47:53] that that they it wasn't an earth a
[47:55] kingdom that God was Desiring for them
[47:57] it was a spiritual Kingdom that all of a
[47:59] sudden they had to become into they had
[48:01] to become in unity with God
[48:03] and so until they received the Holy
[48:06] Spirit there was no way for Unity to
[48:08] ever exist
[48:09] but here again and when he comes down we
[48:11] relate that to us when you were born you
[48:13] were Sons and Daughters of God when you
[48:15] were born and God God ordained you from
[48:17] before the foundation of the world to be
[48:20] his child
[48:21] but until you receive the holy spirit
[48:23] this Unity this Oneness he talks about
[48:25] here was not was not a possibility
[48:28] but once all of a sudden God comes and
[48:30] begins to dwell in you then there's
[48:33] Unity that he talks about here now now
[48:35] this is a possibility but see now is the
[48:38] time for this possibility to become a
[48:40] reality now is the time for us to be
[48:42] able to manifest who we are because
[48:45] until we accept this fact until we
[48:47] understand the unity that God was
[48:49] wanting to hear until we accept this
[48:51] fact we will never be able to accomplish
[48:53] what God has ordained for us to be in
[48:55] this day
[48:56] and the bride coming of Jesus Christ
[48:58] Jesus Christ will so come and live
[49:00] within his body the bride until
[49:02] literally the bride will become the full
[49:03] expression of him this was a seed like I
[49:06] said there was there was planted on the
[49:08] day of Pentecost that seed has to come
[49:10] to full maturity now is the time for
[49:13] that the denominational systems have all
[49:16] pulled away now it's time for the bride
[49:18] to come forth now it's time for the
[49:19] bride to come into full manifestation
[49:21] but we draw back from this
[49:25] we draw back from this
[49:27] because in order for this to take place
[49:30] there has to be a total surrender from
[49:32] us to God there has to be a total where
[49:35] where all of a sudden Jesus Christ or
[49:37] God gains the preeminence in each and
[49:40] every one of us because only when he has
[49:42] the preeminence can he manifest himself
[49:45] through us
[49:46] I mean within me there's two spirits
[49:49] that's the one I was born with
[49:50] and the spirit of God
[49:52] they are not always compatible
[49:54] My Flesh has its own desires I mean you
[49:57] look at brother you look at Paul I mean
[49:59] he wrote a lot of the New Testament and
[50:01] what did he have to do that Paul was
[50:04] Paul I mean you look at his letters you
[50:06] look at Peter you look at his letters
[50:07] you look at James you look at his letter
[50:09] the their personality enters into
[50:11] everything that we do brother Branham
[50:13] was a man he also had his personality he
[50:16] expressed it through the things that he
[50:18] said and and the different actions that
[50:19] he has but we have to come to the place
[50:22] where we're willing to take ourselves
[50:24] and so submit it unto God until it's no
[50:27] longer I who live but now God living his
[50:29] life through me
[50:30] but to do that it takes for total
[50:32] preeminence he has to have the total
[50:35] control
[50:36] and only as I'm willing to yield myself
[50:38] to the spirit of God that is in me does
[50:41] he have the control to do what he's
[50:42] Desiring to do through me it's not about
[50:45] what I it's not about what I do for God
[50:49] no it's about what I allow him to do
[50:51] through me
[50:53] we find this in Jesus Christ I do only
[50:55] what the father shows me to do
[50:57] he didn't do his own thing he says I
[50:59] didn't heal Jesus Christ never healed
[51:01] the sick he never raised the dead he
[51:03] never performed any Miracle it was the
[51:05] god in him that did those things brother
[51:07] Bradham when you begin to go down you
[51:09] begin to look at his life he says I was
[51:11] just standing there when God came down I
[51:14] was just standing there in the river and
[51:15] river baptizing when all of a sudden God
[51:17] came down when I'm at the platform he
[51:19] says that's not me speaking that's God
[51:21] speaking through me because he was able
[51:23] to yield himself into the spirit of God
[51:25] that dwelt in him and because he could
[51:27] yield himself to the spirit of God that
[51:28] was in him that's why God could use his
[51:30] voice to speak brother Brown how often
[51:33] he says you know I have to listen to the
[51:34] tape to find out what I said because all
[51:37] I did was yield myself to God and God
[51:39] began to speak through me and he
[51:40] bypassed my mental faculties and
[51:42] everything else and God just began to do
[51:44] what he wanted to do through him but see
[51:46] now this is where we have to come
[51:48] it didn't stop with the prophet
[51:51] it did not stop by when when brother
[51:54] Branham died God did not die with him
[51:56] no it took a there was a transformation
[51:58] of the ministry all of a sudden the
[52:00] ministry began to change
[52:02] when we when you look at Revelations 10
[52:06] um Revelation San Juan the book's open
[52:09] the mighty Angel Care had that book that
[52:11] book was open
[52:12] who is it open to is open to the bride
[52:15] we come down Revelation and then then
[52:17] there was the Thunders that had that was
[52:20] done and brother Bradham gotten through
[52:22] the prophet began to reveal unto us the
[52:25] secret that was contained in those
[52:26] Thunders
[52:28] the book The Seals had been broken and
[52:30] and goes down to Revelation 10 7 the
[52:32] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[52:34] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[52:36] of God was going to be finished we are
[52:39] that mystery
[52:40] We Are The Mystery of the manifestation
[52:42] of God upon the face of this Earth
[52:45] and then and then and then
[52:47] we look at
[52:50] when when brother when God had fulfilled
[52:52] his ministry through the prophet
[52:54] then then all of a sudden we go down to
[52:56] Revelations 10 8. John eat the book
[53:00] John you eat the book
[53:01] because now you have to become one with
[53:04] that word because now the bride has a
[53:07] Ministry there's something that we have
[53:08] to fulfill we're looking at the
[53:10] manifestation of the sons of God we're
[53:12] we're looking at the time of the Rapture
[53:13] we're looking at the time of our
[53:15] adoption we're looking at the time of
[53:16] the changing of providing all this other
[53:18] wonderful things but we have to come
[53:20] into our position
[53:22] we have to eat the book
[53:25] we have to become we we have to come to
[53:28] the place where it's no longer I who
[53:29] live and now it's God himself living his
[53:31] life through me
[53:32] this is where we as the bride have to
[53:35] rise to that level
[53:37] but we have to die to ourselves in order
[53:39] for that to take it to take place
[53:46] in Philippians 2. starting at verse 5.
[53:49] let this mind or this mindset be in you
[53:52] which was also in Christ Jesus
[53:55] who being in the form the expressed
[53:57] image of God
[53:58] thought not robbery to claim equality
[54:00] with God
[54:02] but he made himself of no reputation he
[54:04] acted he acted not just like all the
[54:06] just like a common man and he took upon
[54:09] him the form of a servant and he was
[54:12] made in the likeness of man and being
[54:14] fashioned like that he becumbled himself
[54:16] to become obedient to the death on the
[54:18] cross
[54:19] well this is the mindset that Jesus
[54:21] Christ had he knew who he was
[54:24] amen he knew he was the son of God he
[54:27] knew he was God incarnate in flesh
[54:30] and because he was God incarnate in
[54:33] flesh all the power of God was he had
[54:35] access to it he could take the fishes
[54:37] and Loaves and feed multitude he could
[54:39] speak to the storm the storm would cease
[54:41] he he could he could raise the dead he
[54:43] could do all these wonderful things but
[54:45] he never did any of those those things
[54:47] without the authorization from his
[54:49] father
[54:49] everybody
[54:51] okay
[54:52] so where does God dwell now
[54:55] dwells in US
[54:57] we need the same mindset we have to be
[55:00] willing to acknowledge we are the sons
[55:02] and daughters of God we have to be
[55:04] willing to acknowledge God dwells in me
[55:06] but we also now we have to realize that
[55:09] with the power of God that dwells in US
[55:11] but God is the one who's supposed to be
[55:14] operating that power God is the one who
[55:16] is supposed to be operating the gifts
[55:18] that he has placed in US
[55:19] brother brought him in his early
[55:21] Ministry he will go out and he said he
[55:23] had the prayer lines oh yeah bring the
[55:25] hard cases bring the the the Blind and
[55:28] the lame and all this other types of
[55:29] stuff the angel said don't do that
[55:33] brother Bradham didn't listen
[55:35] it went on for a couple of services and
[55:37] finally God just backed off he says you
[55:40] think you can do it go for it
[55:42] he had a prayer line and the first one
[55:44] came up and and it the person wasn't
[55:46] healed second one came up and the same I
[55:49] think the third one was a child and
[55:51] brother Brandon realized God's not in
[55:53] this
[55:54] and all of a sudden he went and he had
[55:56] to repent of that
[55:57] and the angel said God has placed a gift
[55:59] in you for God to operate not for you to
[56:03] operate when you take that gift and give
[56:05] it over unto God then God will operate
[56:07] it through you but it's not for you to
[56:09] operate it
[56:11] and so as ministers we have to learn the
[56:13] fact God is placed within us a gift
[56:16] but we have to take that gift and give
[56:18] it to God
[56:19] and so we ask God he says you anointed
[56:22] you you put the words together you
[56:23] control the thoughts of our mind so that
[56:25] what we're saying is not what we want to
[56:27] say but but it's because it's something
[56:29] you want to express
[56:31] and we have to take our gifts and turn
[56:33] it over unto God so that God can operate
[56:35] it through us
[56:38] brother around him in another place the
[56:40] angel talked talked brother random is
[56:42] questioning the spoken word
[56:44] and the angel began to talk to him he
[56:46] says he says who is that speaking when
[56:48] all you run to the discernment oh he
[56:50] says no that's God speaking
[56:52] he says what happens when you stand his
[56:54] Minister and all of a sudden another
[56:55] thought comes into your mind and you
[56:57] follow that thought who's that
[57:00] well that's God speaking
[57:03] so when a minister gets up and he begins
[57:05] to minister it's no longer the minister
[57:07] speaking it's God guiding the thought so
[57:09] that those thoughts which are expressed
[57:11] are hiccard God's thoughts and if you
[57:13] can receive it as God's thoughts it will
[57:15] mean a whole lot more than you do well
[57:17] it was a good service yeah the preacher
[57:19] preached a nice sermon today no it has
[57:21] to go beyond all of that it has to come
[57:23] to the reality no it's God speaking
[57:25] through the ministry unto you so he so
[57:27] that when sometimes ministers get up
[57:29] there and they they wander all over
[57:31] everywhere because there's different
[57:33] needs within the congregation and God is
[57:36] trying to minister into every member of
[57:38] the body of Jesus Christ and if we can
[57:40] accept it as that all of a sudden then
[57:42] you can receive it as the word of God it
[57:44] should give you the strength it should
[57:45] give you the encouragement that you need
[57:54] the brightest is to be the continuation
[57:57] to the ministry of Jesus Christ
[57:59] God has taken in place a seed within us
[58:02] like brother Brian he talks about it in
[58:04] one place where it talks about a seed
[58:05] God placed within Mary a seed that seed
[58:08] that she had to nurture that seed until
[58:11] the time that that seeds could come into
[58:13] manifestation well the church has
[58:15] watched over the seeds it was planned on
[58:16] Pentecost and so that seed could come
[58:18] into full manifestation well that seed
[58:21] has to come into full expression in US
[58:23] this is the bright coming of Jesus
[58:25] Christ this is where Christ who comes
[58:27] and lives within his bride until it's no
[58:29] longer us living but it's Christ Living
[58:30] his life through us
[58:32] and you think oh this is going to be
[58:34] something super and spiritual well
[58:35] sometimes yes sometimes no because our
[58:38] personality enters into everything we do
[58:42] I mean Paul was Paul
[58:45] Jared the Branham with brother Branham
[58:47] he still liked the Hun he still liked
[58:48] the fish he still like to do this that
[58:49] and the other thing but he was willing
[58:51] to take himself and yield himself over
[58:53] to the spirit of God that dwelt in him
[58:54] but see now it comes down unto us we
[58:57] have to be willing to yield ourselves
[58:58] unto the spirit of God that dwells in in
[59:00] US
[59:02] and the patma's vision brother Brown he
[59:04] makes some statements he said this
[59:06] morning was more of a sermon time
[59:07] placing the foundation upon the deity of
[59:10] the revelation God being revealed in
[59:12] Christ
[59:13] how many believes it God was revealed in
[59:16] Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now
[59:18] where is God to be revealed
[59:21] in his church with his people
[59:24] in us the same spirit will be the same
[59:27] works the same manifestation and that's
[59:29] what most people focus on but he says
[59:32] the Same Love
[59:33] the same forgiveness the same
[59:35] long-suffering and gentleness and
[59:37] patience and peace and mercy all that
[59:40] was in Christ is now in the church
[59:41] remember keep this in mind all that God
[59:44] was important to Christ and he was the
[59:46] fullness of the godhead bodily and all
[59:47] that Christ was he has poured into the
[59:49] church God above us God With Us and now
[59:51] God in us but we have to have we have to
[59:54] manifest the same character
[59:57] power without character is satanic
[1:00:00] you don't believe that look at our
[1:00:02] government
[1:00:03] but we're different than that because we
[1:00:06] don't know how to operate the gift that
[1:00:07] God has placed in us until we have the
[1:00:09] character of Jesus Christ and only with
[1:00:12] that character will we operate at the
[1:00:13] way God intended for it to be operated
[1:00:18] brother random in Christ the mystery he
[1:00:21] said you know that God had God wanted to
[1:00:23] accomplish three things first to accept
[1:00:25] Express himself completely which was God
[1:00:28] in Christ and but Christ that Christ
[1:00:31] gave God the total preeminence in in his
[1:00:33] life he's second to have the preeminence
[1:00:35] by this in his church which is his which
[1:00:38] is his body the bride and so God could
[1:00:40] have the preeminence to express himself
[1:00:42] through them
[1:00:44] but it takes the preeminence
[1:00:47] preeminence means total control
[1:00:51] when I'm driving I have I take the
[1:00:53] preeminence now it has these other
[1:00:55] little things on it now it'll control
[1:00:56] the speed and it'll control the steering
[1:00:59] when I get in a storm I turn off the
[1:01:01] Speed and I turn off the the steering
[1:01:03] because I want the control
[1:01:05] because I don't know what's coming
[1:01:08] right but see now all of a sudden I have
[1:01:10] to take myself because I don't know
[1:01:12] where I'm going
[1:01:13] so I have to allow him to take over the
[1:01:15] driver's seat I have to let him have the
[1:01:17] preeminence in my life I have to allow
[1:01:19] him to have total control of my body and
[1:01:21] my thoughts in my mind so that I can
[1:01:23] express what he wants it's interesting
[1:01:26] brother Brown talks about he was up in
[1:01:28] in Washington state I think it was and
[1:01:30] he was preaching
[1:01:32] and there was a young man he was in the
[1:01:34] military and he was going to commit
[1:01:35] suicide because there was a spirit on
[1:01:37] him that bothered him that was bothering
[1:01:39] this individual and brother Brown spoke
[1:01:42] to him directly
[1:01:43] and then they began to go up the Alaskan
[1:01:45] Highway and they pulled into a
[1:01:47] restaurant to get something to eat and
[1:01:49] their brother bam was just joking being
[1:01:51] himself and all of a sudden another car
[1:01:53] pulled in and parked and that man was
[1:01:56] that he had brother Adam had talked to
[1:01:58] he says that man walked in
[1:02:00] the ones that I've told of that incident
[1:02:03] they says all of a sudden brother
[1:02:05] Brown's whole countenance changed
[1:02:08] because God needed him
[1:02:10] and so he went over and he ministered
[1:02:12] unto that young man and began to pray
[1:02:14] for him until that man was delivered
[1:02:16] from the spirit
[1:02:17] but see brother Bradham had to be
[1:02:19] willing to go ahead and yield himself to
[1:02:21] that spirit
[1:02:23] we had a brother in our church and he
[1:02:25] had on the he'd operate on his elbow
[1:02:28] the operation was successful
[1:02:31] and then they got an infection
[1:02:33] and uh anyway he he ended up going to to
[1:02:36] Charlotte I hate driving into Charlotte
[1:02:39] and God directed me he says you go pray
[1:02:40] for him
[1:02:42] but I hate going to Charlotte the
[1:02:44] traffic is horrible and anyway I was
[1:02:47] arguing
[1:02:49] and God says no you go pray well Isis
[1:02:52] wanted the pastor why not the deacons
[1:02:53] why not no you go
[1:02:57] I could have stopped God
[1:03:01] I had that power
[1:03:03] I could have said no
[1:03:05] and what God wanted me to do would have
[1:03:07] never been accomplished
[1:03:09] but I turned my will over to his will
[1:03:12] and I drove into Charlotte and went
[1:03:13] found the guy's room he was in and we'd
[1:03:16] visit a little bit and he kind of
[1:03:18] wondered well what are you doing here I
[1:03:20] says God sent me here to pray for you
[1:03:22] because the free with because what
[1:03:24] you're dealing with now is not a medical
[1:03:25] issue what you're dealing with now is a
[1:03:27] spiritual issue because there's a spirit
[1:03:29] in there which is attacking that elbow
[1:03:30] which is attacking what God had God had
[1:03:33] done
[1:03:34] and so I prayed
[1:03:36] I took authority over the demon that was
[1:03:38] in his elbow
[1:03:39] casting that out and from that point on
[1:03:42] then the healing began
[1:03:43] but if I had not gone
[1:03:46] never would have happened
[1:03:49] same in your lives
[1:03:51] God directs you
[1:03:53] if God is directing you obey it because
[1:03:56] God has a purpose for you going where
[1:03:58] you're going and doing the things which
[1:04:00] you're doing you don't have to call upon
[1:04:02] the pastor to pray
[1:04:04] I'm not saying you you know not to but
[1:04:06] do you realize that you have the same
[1:04:08] Authority and power that he has
[1:04:10] the Bible says where Kings and praise
[1:04:11] unto God what does the king do a king
[1:04:14] rules over a kingdom who do we rule over
[1:04:16] we were all over Satan's kingdom
[1:04:18] he has to obey us we are priests what
[1:04:21] does the priest do a priest intercedes
[1:04:22] on behalf of someone else so if somebody
[1:04:24] comes and you hey brother your sister
[1:04:26] hey I need a prayer Pray for him
[1:04:28] you have the same Authority you have the
[1:04:30] same right you have the same Holy Ghost
[1:04:32] pray for them because your faith will
[1:04:34] touch brother Bradham and another place
[1:04:36] he said there was this young lady she
[1:04:37] had a child the child was sick and all
[1:04:40] of a sudden God impressed upon this late
[1:04:42] after she'd given her seat to reprate
[1:04:44] here pray for this young child
[1:04:46] and she said well she's got a prayer
[1:04:47] card brother Adam's going to pray for
[1:04:49] the child
[1:04:50] and uh still she felt moved so she asked
[1:04:53] the lady in a nice quiet voice would you
[1:04:55] mind if I prayed for your child oh no
[1:04:57] she said that would be just wonderful
[1:04:59] so she prayed for the child and then she
[1:05:02] went and found another place to sit that
[1:05:04] mother and child were taken before
[1:05:06] brother Brown and brother Bradham looked
[1:05:07] at the thing he says well your child's
[1:05:09] already healed and then God says Hey
[1:05:11] somebody had prayed for you that young
[1:05:13] lady sitting up in the balcony she's the
[1:05:15] one that offered a prayer because of her
[1:05:17] prayer that child is healed
[1:05:19] it didn't have to be brother branham's
[1:05:21] prayer
[1:05:23] your prayers will have the same effect
[1:05:26] just enter into the spirit of God and
[1:05:28] let God through you begin to speak
[1:05:30] through you and then take care of the
[1:05:31] need of that person you don't have to I
[1:05:33] mean we have
[1:05:35] we have prayer list for people we pray
[1:05:37] for in our church
[1:05:38] and that's fine but why doesn't the
[1:05:40] person when this when somebody says Hey
[1:05:42] I want you to pray for us why don't you
[1:05:44] just do it
[1:05:46] I mean I'm not trying to do away with
[1:05:48] other people praying them don't get me
[1:05:50] wrong on this girl I know there was a
[1:05:51] time I thought my wife was having a
[1:05:53] heart attack
[1:05:55] um and when we were in the hospital and
[1:05:58] my prayers wouldn't get past the ceiling
[1:06:00] I relied upon the prayers of the Saints
[1:06:03] and our congregation I relied upon one
[1:06:05] of them touching the touching God for
[1:06:07] for us and God I honored that God went
[1:06:10] and he touched my wife and everything
[1:06:11] came out fine but like I said there are
[1:06:14] times my prayers ain't going to do
[1:06:15] anybody any good especially me
[1:06:17] so that's why I rely upon the body of
[1:06:19] Jesus Christ he says you get in touch
[1:06:21] with God I know when we were there in
[1:06:23] India this time all of a sudden my wife
[1:06:25] had caught the flu her breathing became
[1:06:28] labored and uneven
[1:06:30] and I said well Lord we're the only hope
[1:06:33] we've got
[1:06:34] so I got it I got on the internet
[1:06:36] managed to get in touch with my pastor
[1:06:38] and there's five or six of the brothers
[1:06:39] began to pray and a half an hour later
[1:06:41] her breathing became normal and regular
[1:06:43] and not labored and then she slept for
[1:06:46] the next day
[1:06:48] it was good it was damn interceding for
[1:06:50] us
[1:06:51] what's I mean but this goes with all of
[1:06:54] us
[1:06:57] brother Branham and the lady of sin
[1:06:59] Church age
[1:07:00] he says here he stands revealing who he
[1:07:02] is in this last age
[1:07:04] he calls himself the author of the
[1:07:06] creation of God
[1:07:09] creation of God
[1:07:11] this is another creation this has to do
[1:07:13] with the church there's a special
[1:07:15] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:07:17] of that church the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:07:19] created his own Bride As the spirit of
[1:07:22] God he came down and created in the
[1:07:24] Virgin Mary the cells which was
[1:07:25] necessary for about it to be formed
[1:07:28] he said what was God doing
[1:07:30] God was beginning to create himself just
[1:07:33] as he created it just as he created
[1:07:35] within Mary of the seed which was
[1:07:37] necessary to bring forth that body so
[1:07:39] God has also placed his seed in you
[1:07:42] and that seat is to grow into and to
[1:07:44] mature and eventually it's supposed to
[1:07:46] grow until you become the very
[1:07:48] manifestation of God himself brother
[1:07:50] Branham goes on he says this is talking
[1:07:52] about Jesus Christ he says this is the
[1:07:54] god man he was the son of God he was of
[1:07:57] the new creation got man and God met and
[1:08:00] joined he was the first of a new race he
[1:08:04] was the head of this new race you see
[1:08:06] what we you can see that through man was
[1:08:08] of the old order of creation but now in
[1:08:11] Union with Christ he has become a new
[1:08:13] creation of God
[1:08:15] when we join with Jesus Christ when we
[1:08:17] are in Jesus Christ when we literally
[1:08:19] become a part of him by the New Birth by
[1:08:21] by the new birth all of a sudden we
[1:08:23] become part we are no longer part of
[1:08:25] Adam's creation
[1:08:28] our body is yes because that's what
[1:08:30] Satan can attack
[1:08:31] but there's something inside that's
[1:08:33] different now we are the creation of God
[1:08:36] we are now God living in your flesh
[1:08:40] you know I I haven't we
[1:08:42] where we designate God the Father God
[1:08:44] the son okay
[1:08:46] God the Father with how God existed be
[1:08:48] when he when he was dealt in dealing
[1:08:50] with with uh with Israel
[1:08:53] wait that that you know okay but then we
[1:08:55] come to was God in Jesus Christ
[1:08:57] manifesting there he's okay now it's the
[1:08:59] Holy Spirit
[1:09:00] well I was raised in the Baptist Church
[1:09:03] so the trinitarian thought is always
[1:09:05] playing in my mind
[1:09:07] no God is God
[1:09:09] God in the Old Testament that was God he
[1:09:12] speak you know he he do whatever he what
[1:09:13] he did God in Jesus Christ that was
[1:09:15] still God God was manifesting himself in
[1:09:17] that body what does the holy spirit is
[1:09:19] God in Me It's God in you the same God
[1:09:22] that we look in the Old Testament where
[1:09:24] God spoke and all of us in the universe
[1:09:26] and everything came into creation that's
[1:09:28] the same God who dwells in you
[1:09:30] and that God doesn't has never been
[1:09:33] defeated
[1:09:34] everything is subject to him everything
[1:09:37] without exception so when all of a
[1:09:40] sudden Satan harasses you you say father
[1:09:42] this he's bothering me again
[1:09:45] why cry speak
[1:09:49] we make it complicated it's not
[1:09:52] right the message is simple
[1:09:55] the gospel is simple
[1:09:58] what it what the Simplicity is God now
[1:10:00] where's God dwelling he's in you well if
[1:10:03] God dwells in you why are you hindering
[1:10:05] him it's like we talked to the ones in
[1:10:07] India Where's God well he dwells in my
[1:10:09] heart
[1:10:10] well that's good why don't you let him
[1:10:11] out once in a while
[1:10:13] why don't you release him
[1:10:15] why don't you allow him to do what he
[1:10:17] wants to do because if you'll release
[1:10:19] the god that is within you all of a
[1:10:21] sudden God can express himself through
[1:10:22] you there's no difference here we make
[1:10:25] it complicated we all only the pastor
[1:10:28] can do this only the deacons can do no
[1:10:30] every member of the congregation there's
[1:10:32] no difference here if God dwells in you
[1:10:34] that's God Amen well if God dwells in
[1:10:37] you let him operate let him Express
[1:10:39] himself let him manifest himself
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:45] this new creation is not an old creation
[1:10:48] made over or it can never be called in
[1:10:50] your creation this is exactly what it
[1:10:52] said it's a new creation this is another
[1:10:54] creation distinct from the old one it's
[1:10:56] no longer no longer is he dealing by
[1:10:58] ways of the flesh
[1:11:00] but now he that is how he dealt with
[1:11:03] Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's
[1:11:05] seed Through The Godly light Isaac but
[1:11:07] now out of every Kindred tribe and
[1:11:09] Nation he has purposed a new creation he
[1:11:12] was the first of that creation he was
[1:11:15] God created in the form of man now by
[1:11:18] his Spirit he is creating many sons unto
[1:11:21] himself God the Creator creating himself
[1:11:24] a part of his creation God creating
[1:11:26] himself in you
[1:11:30] until you become the manifestation and
[1:11:32] the expression of God
[1:11:35] amen this is the message
[1:11:37] this is the whole purpose and the whole
[1:11:39] plan of God
[1:11:40] had children within God was with seeds
[1:11:44] God planted that seed God planted that
[1:11:46] seed in you that seed has to come to
[1:11:48] manifestation what can that what will
[1:11:51] that seed produce because it's the life
[1:11:53] of God the only thing it can produce is
[1:11:55] God
[1:11:56] and if you will allow that sea to
[1:11:58] continue to grow and mature inside it
[1:11:59] why do we come to church to receive
[1:12:01] encouragement to take that seed into
[1:12:03] water and then the fertilizer to give
[1:12:05] that seed what and what it needs until
[1:12:07] it can grow and grow and grow until
[1:12:09] finally it can come into full
[1:12:10] manifestation
[1:12:12] and and why did God send the prophet
[1:12:15] why all the Miracles and all the
[1:12:17] manifestations of God why why why why
[1:12:19] did we see why could he speak to the
[1:12:21] storm and call it out of existence why
[1:12:23] could he create squirrel speak to speak
[1:12:25] the squirrels into existence why could
[1:12:27] he pray for the sick and see them healed
[1:12:28] why could all these Miracles and
[1:12:30] manifestations and follow his life was
[1:12:32] that just Awakening like oh my that was
[1:12:34] wonderful in the prophet
[1:12:36] bring it to you
[1:12:39] what's the difference
[1:12:40] God is no respecter of persons he's not
[1:12:44] going to call it he's not going to make
[1:12:45] all of us prophets no that was the
[1:12:47] office that he had but we are Sons and
[1:12:49] Daughters of God there's no difference
[1:12:50] here there's no distinction he just
[1:12:53] allowed the God that was in him to
[1:12:54] express itself through him and now
[1:12:56] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:12:58] express himself through you
[1:13:00] there's no difference here
[1:13:02] but you have to believe that you have to
[1:13:05] be willing to accept what God says that
[1:13:07] you are and God sent the prophet in this
[1:13:09] generation for to you to us
[1:13:11] so that we could look at him and says oh
[1:13:13] that's God that's God expressing himself
[1:13:16] now where is God God lives inside of me
[1:13:18] what if he expressed himself from the
[1:13:19] prophet in that way he can express me
[1:13:21] the same way there's no difference
[1:13:22] There's no distinction
[1:13:25] what was the difference brother Branham
[1:13:27] knew who he was
[1:13:29] he knew he was the prophet to this age
[1:13:31] he knew God spoken to him he knew when
[1:13:34] God gave me Vision he knew that Vision
[1:13:35] was true he would go and he would act
[1:13:37] upon that Vision because he says God
[1:13:39] never lies
[1:13:41] well now all of a sudden God has come
[1:13:43] into us how does God speak to you
[1:13:48] does he whisper his thoughts and your
[1:13:50] ears
[1:13:51] I mean God speaks to me in different
[1:13:53] ways sometimes he speaks to me through
[1:13:56] the ministry sometimes he speaks to me
[1:13:58] through my wife
[1:13:59] sometimes he just something in my head
[1:14:02] I mean there are times he well
[1:14:05] he says you're having your attitude's
[1:14:07] terrible today isn't it I said
[1:14:09] yes sir he says don't you think you
[1:14:12] should change it
[1:14:13] well yes sir he says well
[1:14:16] yes sir so then you start singing songs
[1:14:19] and you try to enter into his presence
[1:14:21] God inhabits the praise of his people
[1:14:23] it's that simple
[1:14:27] I mean we're all human beings here I
[1:14:30] mean I don't think anybody here is above
[1:14:32] the point of ever having a bad day
[1:14:34] I mean so how do we get out of the bad
[1:14:37] day we create the atmosphere in which he
[1:14:40] is welcome you start singing praises to
[1:14:42] God Satan hates that
[1:14:44] so you start singing praises to God all
[1:14:46] of a sudden says I'm not going to stick
[1:14:48] around here I've heard enough you know
[1:14:49] and then all of a sudden God's presence
[1:14:51] is there and then everything changes
[1:14:55] this new creation is not the old
[1:14:57] creation made over
[1:14:59] or could not be called a new creation is
[1:15:01] exactly what it says it's a new creation
[1:15:03] this is another creationist thing from
[1:15:05] the old one we already read all of that
[1:15:07] okay it goes on uh
[1:15:10] in perfect faith brother Bradham makes a
[1:15:12] statement he says they had the word and
[1:15:14] the Word was flesh this is turned
[1:15:16] talking to disciples and the word told
[1:15:18] them I give you power amen I give you
[1:15:20] the power they had the power
[1:15:23] but they didn't have the faith to
[1:15:25] operate the word that was now in them
[1:15:29] Jesus Christ said I'm giving you the
[1:15:31] power
[1:15:32] I'm giving you the authority
[1:15:35] so they have the authority by virtue
[1:15:37] Jesus Christ told them I've given you
[1:15:38] that Authority it goes on he said he had
[1:15:41] Faith with his power talking about Jesus
[1:15:43] Christ how did he he says I can do
[1:15:46] nothing by myself he says watch he
[1:15:48] relied upon what he was he relied in
[1:15:51] knowing that he was the word
[1:15:53] he had Faith In The God Who had made him
[1:15:56] the word
[1:15:58] what is the bride today
[1:16:01] it's the word of God expressed
[1:16:04] that's you you are the word of God
[1:16:07] expressed for this generation that's who
[1:16:11] you are so accept the fact that you are
[1:16:13] the word expressed for this generation
[1:16:15] and begin to operate in that mode begin
[1:16:17] to have the faith and the god that has
[1:16:19] made you that word
[1:16:21] you didn't choose to be the word God
[1:16:23] chose you for that word God chose to
[1:16:25] make you part of the word for this
[1:16:27] generation else why would you listen why
[1:16:30] would you still believe in a prophet
[1:16:32] because the prophet was the word for Our
[1:16:34] Generation he delivered that word unto
[1:16:35] us to make us that word that spoken word
[1:16:38] of God and as we listen to the tapes and
[1:16:40] we listen to what God has told us
[1:16:41] through the prophet then all of a sudden
[1:16:43] we become the manifestation of that word
[1:16:45] we become the expression of that word
[1:16:47] so if God Made You the word why not
[1:16:49] accept the fact that you are the word
[1:16:56] brother Brown goes on and he says this
[1:16:58] is a true revelation of God
[1:17:00] this was his purpose
[1:17:02] this purpose took the form through
[1:17:03] election
[1:17:05] the election goes back to goes back to
[1:17:07] the foreign that goes back to the fact
[1:17:09] that you're the seed
[1:17:11] God foreknew you because he knew his
[1:17:14] seed
[1:17:15] because he knew who his seed was that's
[1:17:17] why he could forordain you that's why he
[1:17:19] could elect you because only the the
[1:17:20] only the only the the the seed of God is
[1:17:23] elected into for Redemption anyway he
[1:17:25] said that is why he could look down
[1:17:27] Through the Ages and couldn't look over
[1:17:29] and see that what see himself still in
[1:17:31] the midst of the church as the author of
[1:17:33] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[1:17:36] power brought it to pass
[1:17:38] here by his on decree he elected the
[1:17:42] members of this new creation he
[1:17:44] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:17:46] children according to the good pleasure
[1:17:47] of his will and by his omniscience and
[1:17:49] omnipotence he has brought it to pass
[1:17:55] what do you do
[1:17:57] submit
[1:17:59] it's not about you
[1:18:01] it's about him
[1:18:03] Elijah I think was having a bad bad day
[1:18:05] and he said I'm the only one left
[1:18:07] God everybody there everybody's against
[1:18:09] me having his own little pity party
[1:18:12] and God spoke to his back he says
[1:18:14] no you're not the only one I have
[1:18:17] reserved to myself
[1:18:19] seven thousand
[1:18:21] God reserved them
[1:18:24] they could not fall because God reserved
[1:18:27] them God has a bride because God has
[1:18:32] reserved himself a bride God has chosen
[1:18:35] that bride God has looked over that
[1:18:37] bride that bride will come to come come
[1:18:40] to full manifestation that bride will
[1:18:42] will come into the full manifestation of
[1:18:44] God
[1:18:46] because he's the one that Jose has
[1:18:48] ordained you he is the one that has
[1:18:50] called you he is the one place to seed
[1:18:52] inside of you he is the one that has
[1:18:54] done all of these things and he is the
[1:18:56] one watching over his bride he is the
[1:18:57] one guarding and protecting her
[1:19:01] it's about him it's not about us
[1:19:04] but he elected us because we are a part
[1:19:06] of him
[1:19:08] you know Adam could never Adam could
[1:19:11] never deny Eve
[1:19:13] because Eve was a part of Adam
[1:19:16] Jesus Christ can never deny us
[1:19:20] because we were always a part of him
[1:19:23] we always were himself we always worry
[1:19:26] part of him
[1:19:27] and therefore he watches over his own
[1:19:30] bride he watches over that which he has
[1:19:31] elected that which was a part of him
[1:19:33] from the beginning
[1:19:41] and the restoration of the bright trees
[1:19:43] at that day which is this day
[1:19:46] you will know that I am in the Father
[1:19:48] the father's in me
[1:19:50] I am in you
[1:19:51] and you are in me oh I just love that
[1:19:54] and Satan gets so angry see the Oneness
[1:19:57] of God
[1:20:00] see the Oneness of God
[1:20:04] you are a part of God in the beginning
[1:20:07] you were his son and daughter
[1:20:09] you are going back into what you were
[1:20:12] from the beginning before the fall you
[1:20:14] were Sons and Daughters of God you were
[1:20:16] part of deity
[1:20:17] you are an expression of that deity
[1:20:19] because God's spirit dwells inside of
[1:20:21] you it's that spirit inside of you that
[1:20:24] makes you the expression of him and when
[1:20:26] you can when you can take yourself and
[1:20:27] push yourself aside and let that deity
[1:20:29] live its life out through you you become
[1:20:31] the expression of that deity
[1:20:34] why do people look at the brother
[1:20:35] Bradham and says oh yeah you're Jesus
[1:20:37] Christ he said well in one way that's
[1:20:39] true in another way it's wrong
[1:20:41] he said but when I yield myself to the
[1:20:43] spirit of God in Me then that yeah I am
[1:20:45] him I am expressing him I he
[1:20:49] Eve could never become Adam
[1:20:53] she was a part of Adam
[1:20:55] she could never be Adam
[1:20:58] we are the bride of Christ
[1:21:01] we are his wife
[1:21:03] we can never become him
[1:21:05] you try and make that transition brother
[1:21:07] Bram says you're making me Antichrist no
[1:21:10] I am an expression of him I am a part of
[1:21:12] him I am the one that God dwells inside
[1:21:14] of and so here again don't don't get
[1:21:16] confused when we get into that but you
[1:21:19] have to realize also who you are you are
[1:21:21] part of the godhead you because you are
[1:21:23] part of God God is a God wants to
[1:21:25] express himself through you and when you
[1:21:28] allow him to express himself through you
[1:21:30] then that's no longer you that's God but
[1:21:32] when we all of a sudden good when we all
[1:21:34] of a sudden go to the Rapture and all of
[1:21:36] a sudden we we have the changing our
[1:21:38] body then brother bam says that's going
[1:21:39] to be the adoption
[1:21:41] that's when we literally will become him
[1:21:44] that's when literally we won't literally
[1:21:46] because man we will be we will be we
[1:21:48] will become what we intent God intended
[1:21:50] for us to be from the beginning we will
[1:21:52] be a manifestation of God's children
[1:21:54] because we will be him well if we are a
[1:21:57] manifestation of God's children the the
[1:22:00] that brings us into deity
[1:22:04] we cannot die for anybody else because
[1:22:06] we can never be him
[1:22:08] if you fell on my line because there's a
[1:22:10] fine line here because some people are
[1:22:12] saying oh yeah I am I am Jesus Christ
[1:22:14] manifested in flesh well if if you cross
[1:22:17] the line
[1:22:19] that you've crossed the line
[1:22:22] then you become an antichrist
[1:22:24] and there's people going around today
[1:22:25] saying oh yeah I'm Jesus Christ no
[1:22:28] they've perverted the word
[1:22:30] and and that's extremely extremely
[1:22:32] dangerous
[1:22:45] and latest in church age he says when
[1:22:47] the Methodist failed God raised up
[1:22:48] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:22:50] years until in this last day there is
[1:22:52] another people in the land who under
[1:22:55] their messenger
[1:22:57] will be the final voice
[1:22:59] to the final age
[1:23:01] we do not have our own message
[1:23:07] we have to we are the continuation of
[1:23:09] the message of that God had given
[1:23:11] through the prophet
[1:23:12] we don't come up with our own psychology
[1:23:14] we don't come up with our own stuff
[1:23:17] if you're coming up with all of your own
[1:23:18] stuff and it's contrary to what God had
[1:23:20] spoken through the prophet it's wrong
[1:23:22] from that point on just turn them off
[1:23:24] and go to another station room
[1:23:26] and there's people that do that now they
[1:23:30] oh yeah I have a greater Revelation than
[1:23:31] brother Branham had I'm not interested
[1:23:33] turn it off
[1:23:35] no I'm interested in what God has tried
[1:23:37] to tell me through the Prophet The
[1:23:40] Prophet tells me who I am
[1:23:42] and the more I listen to what God spoke
[1:23:44] through the prophet the more I begin to
[1:23:46] realize no this is what I am this is
[1:23:47] what I am I am a Son of God I am I am
[1:23:50] I'm coming into the full manifestation
[1:23:52] of God I now realize that I have the
[1:23:54] authority over Satan I no longer have to
[1:23:56] put up with him
[1:23:57] I can tell him to pack his bag don't
[1:23:59] even bother packing it just get out
[1:24:01] don't even take the time just get out
[1:24:04] because I have the authority by virtue
[1:24:06] of what God has given to me by virtue of
[1:24:09] what I am I can sit there and I can tell
[1:24:11] Satan you have to leave and you have to
[1:24:13] do it now
[1:24:14] and so when somebody is sick
[1:24:17] I mean you just go up there and said
[1:24:19] they said well brother would you pray
[1:24:20] for me you got this sure
[1:24:22] so I pray for him
[1:24:24] a couple hours later he says boy the
[1:24:26] Pain's all gone well it says it sure has
[1:24:29] to be I said so
[1:24:31] you say that's awful arrogant well
[1:24:34] I have to believe what I pray God hears
[1:24:37] and if I pray and I believe God hears
[1:24:40] then I've got his hair then God's going
[1:24:41] to answer that
[1:24:43] so I I don't mean to sound arrogant when
[1:24:45] I say that but I have to I have to have
[1:24:47] faith in what I am doing I have to have
[1:24:48] faith in the god that has called me I
[1:24:50] have to have faith when God anoints me
[1:24:52] to pray I have to believe that that's
[1:24:53] God speaking through me and it's not me
[1:24:59] he said the church was no longer the
[1:25:00] mouthpiece of God
[1:25:02] it's his own mouthpiece so God is
[1:25:04] turning on her and he will confound her
[1:25:06] through the prophet and the bride
[1:25:09] for the voice of God will be in her
[1:25:13] people relate that oh just through the
[1:25:15] prophet no in her
[1:25:18] we have to be the seed coming into full
[1:25:20] manifestation we have to be that sea
[1:25:22] that was planted on the day of Pentagon
[1:25:24] we have to come to the place where that
[1:25:25] seed comes into full expression which
[1:25:27] means we have to become the full
[1:25:29] expression of Jesus Christ in order for
[1:25:31] that to happen we have to yield
[1:25:32] ourselves to the spirit of God that is
[1:25:34] in us and let him have the preeminence
[1:25:36] in our lives and have a control
[1:25:38] and once we will make that transition
[1:25:40] once we will begin to acknowledge I am a
[1:25:43] Son of God I am a daughter of God once
[1:25:45] we begin to understand God dwells inside
[1:25:46] of me and The God Who dwells inside of
[1:25:48] me is all-powerful and all my there's
[1:25:50] nothing that he cannot do and then allow
[1:25:53] that God to operate through you
[1:25:57] and everybody brother Brown says when
[1:25:59] the weakest of saints gets on her knees
[1:26:01] Satan trembles
[1:26:06] weakest of saints
[1:26:08] okay
[1:26:11] anyway
[1:26:14] and you swore by himself brother Brown
[1:26:16] makes a statement he says faith is
[1:26:18] unconscious
[1:26:19] he says you believe it
[1:26:21] I've learned that through the years of
[1:26:22] travel around the world and meeting the
[1:26:24] people of all different walks faith is
[1:26:26] unconscious you got faith and you don't
[1:26:29] even know it that's right Jesus no
[1:26:31] matter if he was in the storm and the
[1:26:33] Gail was knocking the boat from one side
[1:26:35] to the other
[1:26:36] he was standing in the face of a mess of
[1:26:38] demons or if he was hanging anywhere it
[1:26:40] never moved him he walked right on just
[1:26:43] as calm and quiet as he could be
[1:26:46] why
[1:26:47] he was simply unconscious of fear of
[1:26:49] anything around him that's right whether
[1:26:52] it's going to happen or whether it
[1:26:53] wasn't going to happen he known that it
[1:26:56] was going to happen because God had said
[1:26:58] so
[1:27:00] he said you're here to fulfill it too
[1:27:02] just walk unconscious of fear walk
[1:27:05] unconscious of criticism walk
[1:27:07] unconscious of the world welcome walk as
[1:27:09] you walk in Christ walk with him and
[1:27:12] paying any attention to the Riders to
[1:27:14] the left just keep on just keep on
[1:27:15] moving he says you'll have your ups and
[1:27:18] downs don't worry you've got to go
[1:27:20] through the Briar patches and over the
[1:27:22] sharp rocks and over the Bluffs and down
[1:27:24] the hillsides and up the mountains and
[1:27:25] over the waters but just walk
[1:27:28] with God
[1:27:30] and the more we can walk with God
[1:27:35] that's when we can have rest
[1:27:38] when we walk with God and we know that
[1:27:40] he's there
[1:27:42] then all of a sudden nothing I mean I
[1:27:44] look at the world situation if I didn't
[1:27:46] believe what I believe I would be scared
[1:27:49] I don't know about tomorrow I don't know
[1:27:52] what our government's going to try to do
[1:27:53] tomorrow I know they're trying to
[1:27:55] destroy this nation they're working
[1:27:57] they're very good at it they're doing an
[1:27:59] excellent job at that
[1:28:01] but I have something inside of me that
[1:28:03] gives me rest it doesn't matter what the
[1:28:06] government does I'm part of a different
[1:28:07] Kingdom
[1:28:09] and God says
[1:28:11] God says that if I will walk with him
[1:28:14] he will take care of me
[1:28:16] in in one last thought
[1:28:19] I did a study on habakkuk a number of
[1:28:21] years ago
[1:28:22] and that changed my life
[1:28:25] habit could give you his only four
[1:28:26] chapters if you read the book of story
[1:28:28] book of habakkuk
[1:28:29] God was going to spend judgment upon
[1:28:31] Jerusalem upon the nation he was in God
[1:28:34] was going to send the Chaldeans in they
[1:28:36] were they love to kill people
[1:28:39] have a cook was scared of his own life
[1:28:42] and he began to pray and God spoke to
[1:28:44] him he he says if you think you can I
[1:28:46] have to paraphrase he says if you think
[1:28:48] you can do it you can survive it on your
[1:28:50] own good luck I'll just take my hands
[1:28:52] off and you know wish you luck
[1:28:54] but he said if you will put your faith
[1:28:56] in me
[1:28:57] I will take care of you
[1:29:00] this is where Paul goes back to just
[1:29:02] shall live by faith they will they will
[1:29:05] have faith in the god that has called
[1:29:07] them
[1:29:08] where if you can count into that Realms
[1:29:11] of faith it doesn't matter what comes
[1:29:13] doesn't matter what the government does
[1:29:14] doesn't matter what the economy does no
[1:29:16] if you will walk in Christ if you will
[1:29:19] take and put your total confidence in
[1:29:21] him
[1:29:21] he will take care of you
[1:29:25] God bless you
[1:29:27] with the bomb
[1:29:34] God bless you brother
[1:29:48] I was just that wasn't that a rich
[1:29:50] message thank God that for that promise
[1:29:53] that where the carcass is the Eagles
[1:29:54] will be gathered together because I
[1:29:56] believe we've gathered together around
[1:29:57] the world this morning
[1:29:59] I just wrote down some things while my
[1:30:01] brother was speaking to think that if
[1:30:04] you can be identified to know that we
[1:30:06] are his body and that this is Who We Are
[1:30:10] and we don't have to put up with the
[1:30:11] devil that's what our brother said we
[1:30:13] don't have to put up with the devil this
[1:30:15] morning so if you've got a need this
[1:30:16] morning I uh we've got a few minutes
[1:30:18] before noon we got plenty of time I
