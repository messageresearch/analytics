[8:20] portion of the tape called super sense
[8:24] and let you just hear from Brother
[8:26] randam as he is saying the things that
[8:29] we've been talking about throughout the
[8:33] series and so if we can do that then
[8:35] we'll try to have questions and answers
[8:38] or comments or whatever Wednesday so
[8:41] write them down and think on these
[8:44] things and we will attempt to answer the
[8:47] best that we can I know you already have
[8:50] but remember Sister Dy she is is U at
[8:54] home but uh still pray for her because
[8:57] they still don't know what's causing the
[8:59] the hurting inner chest they've kind of
[9:02] ruled out the heart the major things now
[9:05] they're going this week into the
[9:06] intestin and things to try to find if
[9:09] what the problem is so just remember
[9:12] that and I know you've already prayed
[9:14] for the mark Jeff remember him and the
[9:18] family and all of them because they say
[9:20] that there's not much time for him to
[9:22] live unless the Lord comes on the scene
[9:24] so we believe he will and we always
[9:27] believe that and thank God for I see if
[9:29] I got anything else uh we will be having
[9:33] communion foot washing this afternoon
[9:36] because we were not able to have it on
[9:37] the first Sunday all right anything else
[9:39] that I'm
[9:42] missing oh yeah we've already prayed and
[9:45] know about that but uh sister Gabby and
[9:49] brother Ryan's little baby is off the
[9:51] respirator and we thank God for that
[9:54] that's that's something you know and we
[9:56] pray that the Lord will get it home
[9:58] quick
[10:00] and get it everything to going all right
[10:02] uh Hebrews 11 Heavenly Father we thank
[10:05] you for the day and the hour we thank
[10:08] you for the testimonies that we can
[10:11] stand and give of your healing virtues
[10:14] your you're leading us and guiding us
[10:17] and directing us into your love and
[10:20] grace and your word and all of the
[10:22] things that we could stand all afternoon
[10:24] and thank you for and we just Lord thank
[10:27] you because you are God we ask you now
[10:31] that you'd come as we read your word and
[10:33] you'd speak to our hearts and our lives
[10:35] forgive our
[10:37] sins and Lord just let each one of us be
[10:42] what you want us to be because that's
[10:43] our desire teach us and wait to wait
[10:46] upon you and in doing that Lord bring us
[10:49] to the place that you want us to be we
[10:52] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[10:56] amen Hebrews 11
[11:04] now remember there are thought you go
[11:07] back to the 10th chapter in verse 38
[11:10] Paul is explaining there the just shall
[11:13] live by
[11:14] faith all right so he drops down a
[11:18] couple of verses and then he's telling
[11:21] you what faith is all
[11:24] right now Faith is the substance of
[11:27] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[11:29] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[11:32] good report through faith we understand
[11:35] that the worlds were framed by the word
[11:37] of God so that things which are seen
[11:40] were not made of things which do appear
[11:43] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[11:45] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[11:48] he obtained witness that he was
[11:49] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[11:53] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[11:57] faith Enoch was translated that he
[11:59] should not see death and was not found
[12:01] because God had translated him for
[12:04] before his translation he had this
[12:06] testimony did he please God with Rapture
[12:08] and Faith that's the way brother randam
[12:11] said it right did he please God with
[12:14] Rapture and Faith all right but without
[12:18] faith faith being the substance of
[12:20] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[12:22] Not
[12:23] Seen All right but without faith it's
[12:26] impossible to please him for he that
[12:28] cometh to God must believe that he is
[12:31] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[12:33] diligently seek Him you may be seated
[12:35] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[12:38] of the word
[12:40] now we have
[12:42] been quite a
[12:45] while endeavoring to speak
[12:48] upon uh
[12:51] faith I have a quote to reading here a
[12:53] little while in a little while if we get
[12:55] to it and uh brother Rand says that we
[12:59] put Faith just for like Divine
[13:03] Healing and and things like that and he
[13:05] said then it's so mistaught but what's
[13:07] he meaning when he's saying that we put
[13:09] it for healing or something even if we
[13:12] put it for healing and
[13:13] salvation you know there's a lot more to
[13:16] life than just healing and salvation all
[13:20] right there's a lot more that we need to
[13:23] know a whole lot more about and he said
[13:26] it's mistaught
[13:29] all right now to get to Point as we'll
[13:32] read the quote in a minute even if we
[13:34] teach it
[13:35] correctly but yet we only hold it to
[13:38] certain things we're not going to get
[13:42] the meaning of
[13:43] faith and what it really is we will just
[13:47] get it for whatever we want think about
[13:51] talk about desire you know uh when faith
[13:56] is what the one thing that we've been
[13:58] trying to get across and what did we do
[14:01] uh the last couple of
[14:03] services you take the definition of the
[14:06] word
[14:07] faith look it up let Look up the
[14:09] definition of the word
[14:11] faith and it comes out to a
[14:14] belief a thought a believing a Doctrine
[14:18] uh a concept this is over here is the
[14:21] Baptist Faith you know go down here to
[14:23] the road a little piece you'll find the
[14:25] Methodist Faith the Pentecostal faith
[14:28] you'll find
[14:29] you know things like that and it deals
[14:32] with like
[14:34] Assurance and all like that and those
[14:37] are well and
[14:38] wonderful but as I told you it might not
[14:42] mean a thing in the world to you but it
[14:45] was really just struck me the other
[14:47] night right in the middle of the night
[14:48] when I was thinking on these definitions
[14:51] of of these things
[14:54] and and the Lord just simply explained
[14:57] something to me in very simple
[15:01] terms we cannot take the natural reading
[15:04] of the word a lot of times and get the
[15:06] Revelation the way we need
[15:08] it right no matter what you have or how
[15:12] you have it down pat of the meaning of
[15:16] every word it still takes a revelation
[15:19] from God for that to become a reality
[15:23] into your heart and your life well then
[15:26] you simply ask as I said Paul is
[15:28] explaining faith that the just shall
[15:30] live by faith all right now well see
[15:35] then you would take that that just shall
[15:37] live by
[15:38] faith you would get the definition of
[15:41] faith and you'd go into that it's a
[15:43] belief a Doctrine a concept uh uh your
[15:47] thoughts uh what you believe and
[15:50] assurances and and and marvelous things
[15:53] would come from dealing with that word
[15:57] faith all right
[15:59] but yet when it drops down a couple of
[16:02] verses Paul by inspiration from God
[16:07] tells us in simple terms what faith
[16:12] is he didn't have to go through looking
[16:15] up all of the
[16:16] wording and all that's well and good I
[16:19] do it too I'm the one generally giving
[16:21] you the definitions of everything and
[16:24] that's
[16:26] good but Paul just saying simply said
[16:30] faith is the
[16:32] substance all right now then defining or
[16:37] how you would call it the word
[16:40] faith it would have all these other
[16:42] things relating within it but it would
[16:45] be not the definition that we need
[16:49] to understand what is
[16:53] faith faith is the
[16:57] substance so we actually told Paul Paul
[17:00] wrote it see he wrote what God told
[17:03] him God told him faith is the substance
[17:08] amen and how many times did Brother
[17:10] random use that point faith is the
[17:14] substance not will be hope for whatever
[17:17] it is the
[17:19] substance it's something
[17:22] real it is not just an imagination or a
[17:26] good thought that's right
[17:29] a Doctrine an
[17:30] idea it's actually this a
[17:35] substance so whatever you
[17:38] desire whether it be healing whether it
[17:41] be
[17:42] salvation whether it be materialistic
[17:46] things uh you know
[17:50] whatever if you really come down to the
[17:52] finality of it and look at it correctly
[17:55] you'll see that faith is
[17:59] whatever you
[18:01] desire that's the
[18:03] substance that's the substance all right
[18:07] so we know then that the world came into
[18:09] being as we read through faith we
[18:13] understand the world's refrain all right
[18:15] so then the world was framed from things
[18:17] that do not
[18:19] appear so wherever it came from to make
[18:23] this world you
[18:26] know now you're dealing with faith you
[18:30] went back past your doctrines your ideas
[18:33] your Concepts your assurances your
[18:36] wonderful meanings of the word and
[18:39] you've gone actually literally back into
[18:42] the mind of God because that's the only
[18:45] place you can go with faith all right so
[18:49] I hope you understand what I meant and
[18:51] if you that didn't hear the message I
[18:52] would invite you to to listen to this
[18:55] past
[18:56] Wednesday because it really really just
[18:59] dwell in my heart to speak about it that
[19:02] way that the real definition of
[19:07] faith is given right there in the
[19:10] Scripture it is not given in wordings
[19:13] that we must have to look
[19:16] up Paul had the Old Testament scriptures
[19:19] to look
[19:20] up but remember the word faith is only
[19:23] used two times in the Old Testament it's
[19:25] not an Old Testament word
[19:28] right it's a new testament
[19:31] work that's why when we finally will get
[19:33] over to it you'll see that it's by faith
[19:36] Able by faith Enoch by Faith by faith
[19:40] but it's true Faith to you and
[19:43] I I hope we can get to that point and
[19:46] bring it out to where we can understand
[19:49] all right so then the definitions of the
[19:52] words a lot of times will not bring us
[19:54] to the correct
[19:57] understanding but but the
[19:59] revelation will bring us to the original
[20:03] understanding or the original Faith amen
[20:06] all right so then I believe that we
[20:10] have now the as the prophet said the
[20:15] correct interpretation of the word of
[20:17] God by divine
[20:20] inspiration now that means to me
[20:25] that we can say well we've got the
[20:28] well you remember the Baptist man told
[20:30] him you know if we could ever get it
[20:32] down whatever word meant said we'd have
[20:36] it and he said no that that won't work
[20:41] said they had a whole lot more of the
[20:43] original
[20:44] word there in the beginning of the
[20:48] church then we have today because they
[20:51] hadn't lost their orinal translations
[20:53] and original wording and said they wound
[20:55] up with a
[20:57] trinity
[20:59] all right so then the point that I've
[21:02] tried to get us to look at is
[21:05] Faith
[21:07] is whatever you're asking
[21:12] for that
[21:15] substance that you're asking for which
[21:18] substance can be spiritual or natural
[21:20] see all right Revelation or or healing
[21:23] or
[21:24] whatever whatever you're asking for
[21:29] the word faith has got it already
[21:32] finished that way we're going back into
[21:34] the mind of God to come out with the
[21:37] divine
[21:39] inspiration is I just quoted or maybe
[21:41] that wording I'm just paraphrasing he
[21:44] said perfect interpretation by with
[21:46] divine inspiration it came to the
[21:49] prophet amen he gave us the definition
[21:52] of these things so no matter what
[21:54] Webster would say about it or who would
[21:57] say about it or strongs or whatever we
[22:00] still got to go back to the total
[22:01] dependence upon what God says that's
[22:05] right by Revelation all right
[22:07] now oh but we believe in the Trinity we
[22:11] got a
[22:13] revelation that has no
[22:18] substance
[22:20] right yeah but we got a lot of do a lot
[22:23] of Doctrine but no
[22:26] substance
[22:28] right trinities no
[22:35] substance hell be an eternal no
[22:38] substance
[22:41] amen can I get on down a little further
[22:43] am uh two Souls seven Thunder virtues
[22:47] perusia uh River
[22:50] Jordan no substance that's right all
[22:55] right see then it brings it down to
[22:57] where
[22:58] that if our Revelation does not what is
[23:02] the word coincide which means to go with
[23:05] or whatever to do uh with the original
[23:08] scripture or understanding or the
[23:10] prophet's
[23:13] message then we know for certainty where
[23:15] the wrongs at all right that's sorry to
[23:18] be that blunt but why
[23:21] not I think it's time to quit playing
[23:23] around and get down to be serious all
[23:26] right so we took it from
[23:29] that and bring in our thought and then
[23:33] we went into the life
[23:34] message being calling it the sense of
[23:40] faith and from that we found the prophet
[23:43] saying
[23:45] that you
[23:47] know the real sense of faith is greater
[23:51] than your
[23:54] senses and remember now we found that
[23:56] this word sense is only only used one
[23:58] time in the Bible all total all right so
[24:01] we using more modern terminologies to
[24:04] come down with uh C taste feel smell and
[24:06] here as being senses of the body we're
[24:09] using that part defining it down from
[24:11] other wordings because it's not in the
[24:14] Bible to where you could pick it up from
[24:16] to get the correct
[24:18] understanding all
[24:20] right we know for
[24:22] assurity as we'll read in a second that
[24:25] we must
[24:26] have the five senses of the body see
[24:30] taste feel smelling
[24:32] here all right but we know also that
[24:36] those five senses now listen to wording
[24:38] now those five senses are really more
[24:42] real
[24:44] than
[24:48] tangibility now that throwed you for a
[24:51] second so you had to think what I'm
[24:52] talking about right boy get your mouth
[24:54] closed it flew
[24:56] open
[24:59] see the five senses is greater than
[25:00] anything
[25:03] real because everything real in one way
[25:06] or the other came into being other than
[25:08] what God created you know we're talking
[25:09] about cars automobile planes Etc come
[25:12] through the five
[25:14] senses and really if we get time we'll
[25:17] read where the Prophet says
[25:20] that there was where we fell in the
[25:24] garden he said in the five senses
[25:29] was it no we fell into reason and memory
[25:31] and
[25:32] Imagination that's wonderful I'm glad
[25:34] you thought of that but just remember
[25:37] your memory reason conscience and
[25:39] affections works through your spirit
[25:43] which works out true into the body by
[25:46] what see taste feel smell and hear all
[25:50] right so now I'm trying to get a point
[25:53] to you what I was trying to get across
[25:55] Wednesday see we don't look at our
[25:57] senses as the five senses as being
[26:03] real we we want to get them more into
[26:06] imaginations you know all right but
[26:09] that's
[26:11] incorrect now you know what the prophet
[26:13] gave the definition one time of what he
[26:15] was defining he
[26:17] said I don't need a white shirt
[26:21] on he said I have one
[26:24] on he said that is a sign scientific
[26:30] fact all
[26:32] right now a scientific
[26:37] fact you say and that's why I gave it to
[26:39] you and I got a quote in here I get to
[26:41] it eventually where brother randam is
[26:43] talking about it and I told you you know
[26:45] we say when God totally delivers me of
[26:49] this and my arm that's cut off grows
[26:51] back I'll say I'm
[26:55] Healed no that's a sign scientific
[27:01] fact right if it comes back that's a
[27:04] scientific
[27:05] fact all right but to get that out of
[27:08] the way and important to think
[27:10] about then our senses are more real than
[27:13] you
[27:15] think they are what we use to contact
[27:17] the world and the things around us and
[27:21] we don't contact god with them but
[27:23] they're
[27:24] real all right now
[27:28] we will get to what we were talking
[27:29] about the sense of Faith the sense of
[27:32] faith is more real than caste feel
[27:35] smelling here are anything to be able to
[27:38] be proven
[27:42] scientific are you
[27:45] listening I laid it down the best way I
[27:48] could no education but the
[27:51] thought see taste feeling smelling here
[27:55] is more real to you than anything thing
[27:57] around
[27:59] you because it's a part of you that
[28:03] contacts that that is around you all
[28:06] right now then it being more real than a
[28:11] scientific
[28:14] fact right you see well now that was
[28:17] hard to swallow well okay swallow a
[28:19] couple of times you know get a good GL
[28:22] GL and let it go
[28:25] down that if it's a scientific fact I
[28:27] don't have to believe for it
[28:30] amen it's easy to say I'm Healed if the
[28:34] doctor writes me out of report and I had
[28:36] a growth and it's
[28:42] gone but faith is to stand there with
[28:45] the growth there and it getting
[28:49] worse and you say by stri some
[28:52] he right all right so CJ f Ming here is
[28:58] greater than a scientific
[29:00] fact all right so then faith is greater
[29:05] than anything c f smelling here could
[29:07] have to deal with or a scientific
[29:12] fact because the Bible says we
[29:16] understand the world's
[29:18] refrained from things that do not
[29:21] appear so we can have no scientific
[29:25] fact right
[29:28] you could have no se taste feeli
[29:30] smelling
[29:33] here cuz you can't see
[29:37] Adams right handful of
[29:41] them just got to get it changed
[29:43] correctly blow the world up all right
[29:47] brother R said let's get God's Adam Bomb
[29:50] Faith all but see going back to the
[29:53] original one who
[29:56] created
[29:59] now we read our Wednesday night that
[30:03] brother R
[30:04] said that Faith created the
[30:12] world he said we're going back to that
[30:15] place of thinking about how did it came
[30:18] into being and we see that it come into
[30:20] being by
[30:22] faith
[30:24] right well then truly faith is is the
[30:29] substance amen of what we ask
[30:32] for is actually a
[30:35] substance brother R said it's an
[30:37] Evidence of things not seen you remember
[30:41] and he said if it is a an Evidence there
[30:45] got to be a
[30:47] substance right it's all right now
[30:50] getting it down to where we're going to
[30:53] all
[30:54] right how much more is it to talk about
[30:58] faith or
[31:01] Revelation that it is to think about
[31:06] anything that we can see taste feel
[31:09] smell and here or anything we can prove
[31:11] to be a scientific
[31:15] fact and we get down to one
[31:18] thing and then I'll get on to the
[31:21] message so if God is
[31:24] still bringing individuals in to the
[31:27] body of
[31:29] Christ
[31:31] right then he's not through
[31:36] creating right now well brother D I got
[31:39] a quote okay let me beat you to it
[31:42] brother brother said it's he finished a
[31:44] physical
[31:46] creation that's true he finished a
[31:49] physical
[31:51] creation that's
[31:53] right but we're not a physical creation
[31:56] we're spiritual
[31:57] creation brought into a physical
[32:00] being so as long as the body of Christ
[32:03] is not
[32:05] complete and if there's one person
[32:07] that's not born again God is still
[32:11] creating he's the beginning of the
[32:13] creation of God and what did he say we
[32:16] are the rest of that creation amen amen
[32:21] hallelujah
[32:23] right now the main point right there is
[32:25] one thing
[32:32] we believe in spiritual
[32:34] multiplication we believe imparting the
[32:36] word imparting the
[32:38] word we believe that the bride of Christ
[32:41] has the ability to even impart eternal
[32:43] life but it's only through what
[32:45] imparting the word it's not just telling
[32:48] somebody they got it you can have it
[32:49] come and get it no it's imparting the
[32:53] word it's speaking the word you know
[32:55] that's odd then God still speak speaking
[32:58] well brother Dale I didn't think we were
[32:59] supposed to speak the word I thought it
[33:02] was supposed to be for brother brandham
[33:03] and the Lord Jesus
[33:06] only
[33:09] no think it's
[33:11] still happening don't
[33:14] you yes sir so faith is still in the
[33:16] being amen all
[33:19] right remember then the definition of
[33:22] faith is whatever you
[33:25] desire
[33:27] healing
[33:28] salvation
[33:33] Deliverance the substance of
[33:37] that is the faith that we're talking
[33:40] about the
[33:42] Revelation yeah like I invited the
[33:45] church to you that wasn't here to hear
[33:46] it U show me in the Bible where it says
[33:49] faith is a
[33:52] revelation it's not there like that he
[33:56] said by faith in offered by faith this
[33:58] by faith
[34:00] that we take brother brandom's message
[34:03] in which is correct and he says by Faith
[34:06] by
[34:08] Revelation Enoch offered to God a more
[34:10] excellent
[34:12] sacrifice the we're up to the point that
[34:14] we're using the prophet's definitions of
[34:17] the words that is I talked about to
[34:20] start with that Paul's definition of
[34:22] faith is the substance of things
[34:25] hopeart
[34:28] brother rand's definition of the word
[34:30] revelation is the revealed word in you
[34:34] and
[34:35] I which is the
[34:37] substance
[34:40] amen the gospel is the power of God or
[34:42] what under salvation and is it not true
[34:46] that you must first confess with your
[34:48] mouth and believe in your heart so if
[34:51] there's one more to be left to come into
[34:53] the body of Christ that person must
[34:56] confess with their mind mouth and
[34:57] believe with their heart and then they
[35:00] can come into
[35:05] salvation so I think we're just getting
[35:07] to the place to start talking about
[35:09] speaking the word instead of thinking
[35:11] about that we can't do
[35:13] it because see Faith then is a
[35:20] revelation personally revealed to you
[35:23] what is the new birth brother brandom
[35:24] about 45 Christ of mystery God revealed
[35:27] he says it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[35:29] personally to
[35:32] you
[35:34] Faith what does he say on patas Vision
[35:38] you can't be born again without
[35:45] faith there's no way to be born again
[35:47] without faith because that's what it is
[35:50] it's the birth of the
[35:51] word right all right now so now what we
[35:57] want to talk about here and I may just
[35:58] go part of the way in the message cut
[36:01] off and then pick back up this afternoon
[36:03] because I know won't have time enough to
[36:05] cover the whole notes we'll just pick up
[36:07] continue on then we'll play the tape let
[36:09] brother randam say to you what I've
[36:12] tried to say to you and I wish you would
[36:15] listen to that message over and over
[36:17] faith the six cense is one message but
[36:21] that one is a super sign a super sent
[36:24] excuse me TW uh 59 12 27 evening service
[36:28] but
[36:30] 19661 is Faith the six sense I wish you
[36:35] would listen to those over and
[36:38] over you know about the things that
[36:42] we've been talking about okay let's get
[36:44] on to this a little thoughts go ahead
[36:46] brother and pull up number one which is
[36:47] taken from questions and answers in
[36:52] 1964 and the prophet is defining to us a
[36:55] human being we don't don't have to go
[36:57] through all of the things we should
[36:59] understand that but we are a dual person
[37:01] three people in one body Spirit Soul uh
[37:04] outward senses you know works with one
[37:07] inward is the soul see he's talking
[37:09] about the it's not your soul but the
[37:10] outward senses all right and you coming
[37:13] down to the soul as being the actual
[37:16] inner being of who you are and we'll
[37:18] read in a minutes either Faith or doubt
[37:21] and he says watch what he gets to he
[37:23] says there's actually six
[37:25] senses in a
[37:29] human six s is in a
[37:33] human because it's number six and all
[37:36] the different
[37:38] things but you got C's feeli smelling
[37:42] here but his
[37:44] faith sets his destination where he's
[37:48] headed for Faith now what now Faith is
[37:51] the substance of things hope for the
[37:52] evidence of things you do not see taste
[37:54] feel smell or hear but by faith
[37:57] when he catches the word it sends him
[38:00] into a
[38:03] dimension so now what is the six
[38:06] sense it's a
[38:09] dimension we're going to find a lot of
[38:11] things that the six sense is so we're
[38:14] going to start out with it being a
[38:16] dimension that makes it so real to him
[38:19] till he's just as good as got it in his
[38:21] hand he knows it's going to
[38:24] happen all right
[38:30] God doesn't deal with you and I on the
[38:32] outward senses that's not made to that
[38:34] that's to contact the world C taste feel
[38:37] smelling here is to contact the world
[38:39] now then you got a lump in between that
[38:41] you want to talk about as Spirit to me
[38:44] memory reason conscious affections now
[38:47] he has to deal through caste feel
[38:49] smelling
[38:51] here but that's not the controlling
[38:53] Factor all right memory reason
[38:56] conscience and affections he has to deal
[38:58] through that but that is not to be the
[39:00] controlling factor to a
[39:03] Christian the inward part of us which is
[39:07] another
[39:08] dimension
[39:11] amen we live in what is called Life
[39:13] Light and matter TV's fourth this that
[39:16] goes into that fifth sixth you
[39:19] know
[39:21] Dimensions all right it raises us up our
[39:25] as the Bible says resurrected sitting in
[39:27] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it takes
[39:30] us to Heavenly
[39:32] places which is the sixth Dimension you
[39:35] know all right Heavenly places now we
[39:38] know that goes on up into a lot but all
[39:41] right but think about
[39:45] it Fai sends him into a
[39:48] dimension that makes it so real to him
[39:52] that he's just as good as got it in his
[39:56] hand
[39:58] he knows it's going to
[40:00] happen have you ever had that I've asked
[40:03] that every
[40:04] service and I don't do it to be little
[40:07] because I've tried to explain it you
[40:09] know L people think that i' be little by
[40:11] saying I've done this but you ain't
[40:13] never done
[40:14] that well now you got that in there you
[40:16] sure messed up in your memory reason
[40:19] conscience affection and you sure got
[40:21] your SE test F smelling ear all goofed
[40:25] up I tried to speak of the things that
[40:28] had happened to me because I know they
[40:30] happened amen
[40:34] right but I know and realize that
[40:36] everybody's not to have everything the
[40:39] same but I've tried to make it so that
[40:41] you would understand the simple
[40:44] Simplicity that God deals with you in
[40:48] amen keeping you from running into a car
[40:52] keeping you from falling off of
[40:55] a building or you know getting
[41:00] hurt
[41:01] the the simple things that we look at
[41:05] are not so simple maybe one day when we
[41:07] get there
[41:09] I've always told you that when I get
[41:12] there I've always said it I had two
[41:13] Guardian Angels because it took two of
[41:16] them and I'm going to have to apologize
[41:18] to both of them when I get there cuz
[41:20] I've worked them to death you but that's
[41:24] not a joke that's the truth all right
[41:28] but now
[41:31] listen he says on taking sides with
[41:34] Jesus number two there ether taking side
[41:37] taking God at his word now what is
[41:41] faith faith is the
[41:44] substance not just the mythical
[41:48] thought it's the substance of things oh
[41:51] far the evidence of things you do not
[41:53] see taste fi M here there's none of the
[41:56] senses declare
[41:58] it none of your Des senses can declare
[42:04] Faith
[42:07] right yet the six
[42:09] sense which is faith that can declare
[42:14] Faith none of your senses declares
[42:17] faith if you declare it with your senses
[42:20] is a scientific fact other than saying I
[42:24] believe all right
[42:26] but look the outside man is governed by
[42:29] five senses he tast FS Inside Man is
[42:32] governed by two senses either Faith or
[42:35] unbelief if you believe it it's just as
[42:37] real to you as if
[42:40] any of the natural senses of the body
[42:44] declare
[42:46] it and truly these senses of the body
[42:49] can be fooled but faith is absolutely
[42:53] infallible now all
[42:57] right if you believe it's just as real
[42:59] to you as if any of the natural senses
[43:03] of the body declare it now what was our
[43:06] definition a moment
[43:08] ago see taste feel smelling here is
[43:10] greater
[43:12] than
[43:15] tangibility you did at least shake your
[43:17] head maybe grinned or something about it
[43:20] of what we were talking about but that's
[43:23] all right I don't have to have your
[43:26] amens to help me say what I'm going to
[43:28] say I'm not like
[43:30] a come on
[43:33] now no I don't have to have that I
[43:37] learned to preach a long time ago
[43:38] without having to listen to people all
[43:41] right
[43:43] listen but Faith declares
[43:48] it Faith declares
[43:51] it makes it
[43:55] established
[43:57] now the only way you can know
[44:00] God is by
[44:03] Faith remember we just read he that
[44:05] cometh to God must believe that he is
[44:09] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[44:10] diligently seek him so look at the next
[44:13] quote they the beginning of the of
[44:15] Jesus's Fame preach in
[44:18] 53
[44:20] 605 e29 now look what is
[44:24] faith faith is is a six
[44:27] sense five senses control this man God
[44:31] put man in five senses to contact his
[44:33] Earthly home you don't contact god with
[44:36] your five senses you know God by
[44:40] faith which is the six
[44:42] sense which is there two senses of the
[44:45] Soul faith and
[44:47] unbelief now there's not two senses in
[44:49] there of faith and unbelief we just read
[44:52] it's Faith or doubt Faith or unbelief
[44:54] one sense is there right amen all right
[44:57] and if you're possessed with faith faith
[45:00] is just as
[45:03] real much reality to you as s
[45:08] is have you ever had God to speak to you
[45:13] about
[45:15] something and you didn't
[45:17] care who argued with you about
[45:21] it who told you it wasn't real amen but
[45:25] to you knew it was real you ever had
[45:29] that and listen I say to you you've had
[45:33] that a lot of times but you don't record
[45:39] it faith is a simple
[45:42] thing a lot of times it's just a
[45:44] straight knowledge that comes and that's
[45:51] it now do you have the knowledge that
[45:54] has come to you by the revealed word
[45:56] that there's just one
[45:58] God or are you quoting the prophet the
[46:02] Bible M Grandma so old Preacher Brother
[46:06] Dale
[46:09] whoever Could you actually talk to
[46:12] someone without having to say brother
[46:13] randam say
[46:15] it could you explain one God without
[46:18] having to have a
[46:23] quote your revelation
[46:27] like I told a man at work I said he was
[46:29] talking to me about something that he
[46:30] said he saw I said
[46:33] okay I said what I want you to do is I
[46:36] want you to explain to me what you're
[46:39] talking about and I said now when you
[46:41] cross yourself I'm going to stop
[46:44] you because in just a moment you're
[46:47] going to cross yourself with your own
[46:49] wordings and I said' when you do I'm
[46:51] going to stop you well he hadn't spoke
[46:53] three words and I stopped
[46:54] him
[46:57] I said ou've already crossed your own
[46:58] self well yet you say you have a
[47:03] revelation well you know the way we do
[47:05] that but I can't
[47:07] explain what I see but it's revealed to
[47:12] me is contrary
[47:18] word right contrary to the
[47:22] word then where does it put
[47:24] us so you know God by faith which is the
[47:28] six
[47:29] sense that's the way you know
[47:33] him you don't know him by intellectual
[47:39] understanding look at the next one
[47:45] perseverance e26
[47:49] 62729 he's going through explaining it
[47:52] it has nothing to do with God at all and
[47:55] people
[47:56] really rely upon them he's talking about
[47:58] the senses
[48:00] right come on he's talking about the
[48:02] senses c t field here people rely upon
[48:05] that but you mustn't do
[48:11] that faith is something
[48:15] different faith is the six
[48:18] sense which you contact God you can only
[48:21] contact God by the six sense which is
[48:24] Faith he that cometh to God must believe
[48:26] that he is and a rewarder of those that
[48:28] diligently seek after him
[48:31] see but you see he says
[48:33] we use our
[48:37] senses and we think we got it by the
[48:45] senses but have you ever had him to just
[48:48] speak to
[48:51] you and tell you
[48:54] something
[48:56] amen that you and you alone
[49:02] knew and you and you alone have it for
[49:05] that part because you know how I preach
[49:08] it every person is an individual in the
[49:11] body of Christ we don't have a
[49:13] collective Revelation in the body of
[49:15] Christ God revealed himself to you but
[49:17] he revealed himself to me but my
[49:19] Revelation can't be contrary to your
[49:20] Revelation if we have the revelation of
[49:22] God that's but we can have different
[49:24] material now not not like well now the
[49:27] way brother so and so explain he
[49:29] explains that it a trinity but he
[49:31] believes in one God no no something's
[49:33] wrong somewhere amen but that's his way
[49:37] of seeing it well then his Way's
[49:44] wrong It Don't Fit the
[49:47] word come
[49:50] on hey folks I'm on the spot every day
[49:52] so I don't have to worry about
[49:54] it I got to tell you what I believe and
[49:57] I certainly don't beat around the bush
[49:58] you know that I just come right out and
[50:01] tell
[50:02] you that way you can make up your choice
[50:04] what you want to
[50:05] believe I don't ask you to believe it I
[50:07] just ask you to
[50:10] listen now watch we're going to get to
[50:12] something in a minute and I'm going to
[50:14] take a point right in here and just make
[50:17] a
[50:23] thought the six sense
[50:27] we will read in a minute where the
[50:29] Prophet says it's only for the Born
[50:31] Again
[50:32] believer all
[50:37] right
[50:38] okay but remember where he's living
[50:43] at right remember he's not in the Old
[50:49] Testament he's defining in a new
[50:51] testament form the word
[50:54] faith Grace
[50:56] salvation you only use the Old Testament
[50:59] as an
[51:00] example A typ or a
[51:03] Shad but before you go anywhere
[51:06] whatsoever
[51:08] listen I in no way have ever said taught
[51:12] thought or anything that the Old
[51:14] Testament people were not saved that's
[51:17] right they had their form of
[51:20] Salvation it was through the blood of
[51:22] bulls and goats it was through the
[51:24] things
[51:25] it was in their lives that they were
[51:28] expected to live and it was to that and
[51:31] it provided them a place to go to once
[51:34] they passed away which would be into the
[51:38] bosom of
[51:39] Abraham which is the faith Seed of
[51:41] Abraham and that's what they were called
[51:44] all right so then when we talk about
[51:47] here Enoch and them can have a sick
[51:53] sense remember a sinner can get a
[51:57] revelation that they're
[52:09] healed but that don't save
[52:13] them that's the
[52:15] problem all right so now as we go
[52:18] through a little point you listen to
[52:21] what we're talking about we'll continue
[52:23] the rest this afternoon if necessary
[52:25] look at number five which is taken from
[52:27] faith is the six
[52:29] sense all
[52:31] right our heavenly
[52:34] father the six sense these testimonies
[52:37] from the Bible that the six sense as I
[52:40] call it faith I was reading in Hebrews
[52:42] 11 of the six six sents Faith being the
[52:45] substance of things hope far the
[52:46] evidence of things that senses of the
[52:48] earth don't declare but we see through
[52:51] there how that they subdued kingdoms and
[52:53] stopped the mouth of lions and escaped
[52:56] the edge of the sword and Enoch was
[52:58] translated into Heaven by that six
[53:02] sense
[53:06] okayu all right we read and we'll get
[53:09] back to it where by faith the six
[53:13] sense Abel offered on to God by faith
[53:17] Abraham by faith six sense but we've got
[53:21] to Define it because if we don't then we
[53:23] run around with our thoughts
[53:25] and you're going to cross yourself in
[53:27] just a little
[53:29] bit and you're going to make your
[53:31] Doctrine wrong because you're going to
[53:34] make it try to fit your
[53:36] thought remember it's got to fit the
[53:38] whole
[53:39] word okay now watch stop the mouth of
[53:43] line Enoch was translated into Heaven by
[53:45] that six
[53:46] sense Abraham so journeyed into Strange
[53:50] Land and received a son after he was 100
[53:53] years old six cents
[53:55] and Sarah's wounds was dead he
[53:57] considered not these things he St
[53:59] staggered not his promise of God through
[54:00] unbelief strong giving God the promise
[54:03] now oh God and we're supposed to be the
[54:05] children of Abraham what a poor excuse
[54:08] we are oh God wake up the sick sense in
[54:13] this church amongst these people
[54:16] tonight wake it
[54:20] up wake up to six
[54:22] cense when we see that you give that
[54:25] great sign to
[54:27] Abraham it taken place I pray that
[54:31] they'll see the angel of the Lord's
[54:32] presence tonight and we'll rely not upon
[54:35] their feeling upon their sight upon the
[54:38] word of God that made the promise and
[54:41] every person in here will be healed and
[54:44] everyone that's unsaved will be saved
[54:47] and all without the Holy Ghost will
[54:49] receive it hear me father I pray in
[54:52] Jesus name are you ready to receive
[54:55] leave your healing all of you you you
[54:58] going to put your six sense to
[55:01] work what is the six sense now it's
[55:04] faith and faith is the substance of
[55:06] things hope far the evidence of
[55:09] things that makes Missouri wrong you
[55:12] remember that in
[55:14] Missouri I got to see it you know
[55:17] Missouri there a show me state or what
[55:20] they call that word you have to show me
[55:22] you know that faith is the things that
[55:25] subdued kingdoms that wrought
[55:27] righteousness that does all kind of
[55:28] Miracles and signs of that six sense a
[55:32] six
[55:36] sense is it possible for a
[55:40] sinner to receive a revelation of his
[55:46] healing I believe it is brother R said
[55:50] prostitutes walk across the platform
[55:53] receive healing he said true Christians
[55:55] walk across and reject
[55:58] it why because they're not taught
[56:01] correctly That's the basis of what he
[56:03] said not taught correctly what if you
[56:08] tell that prostitute she's a prostitute
[56:10] she needs to quit being a prostitute she
[56:12] ain't going to get
[56:15] healed because you're going to condemn
[56:17] her all
[56:19] right but then think about
[56:21] it how can a prophet as we read later on
[56:25] say that only the Born Again believer
[56:28] has the six
[56:32] sense but here he says Enoch had the six
[56:34] cents Abraham had the six sense what's
[56:37] he talking about what is the uh do
[56:41] welcome her
[56:45] visitors what is he talking about
[56:51] faith Fai is is six
[56:53] cents
[56:55] a sinner can get a
[57:00] revelation now if you don't think that's
[57:04] right I want you to answer me one
[57:07] question if you think a sinner can't get
[57:09] a revelation and I know a lot of people
[57:12] don't believe
[57:14] that then I want to ask you one question
[57:17] and I'll just quit on it I won't say no
[57:20] more how did you get
[57:23] saved
[57:29] is that a sensible
[57:31] doing you was a
[57:34] sinner and got
[57:37] saved so the sinner got the Revelation
[57:40] he didn't get saved and then got a
[57:42] revelation Revelation was his salvation
[57:46] all
[57:47] right
[57:49] now but said the little said to the
[57:53] apostles perfect Faith he said the
[57:58] apostles he said didn't have perfect
[58:00] Faith he said because Jesus was walking
[58:03] with
[58:06] him he said it's hard to
[58:09] have perfect faith without the Holy
[58:12] Ghost he said because it brings
[58:14] it amen
[58:16] right then he drops down the next
[58:18] paragraph or right above one and we'll
[58:20] get back to it he said the little woman
[58:23] at the wh
[58:25] she had faith for that
[58:30] time all right what did what did Enoch
[58:35] have faith for that time which you
[58:40] walked off the Earth in it what did
[58:42] Moses have faith for that time what did
[58:46] Abraham had faith for that time because
[58:49] Jesus Christ had not been crucified and
[58:53] by him not being crucified the Holy
[58:55] Ghost was not back there in the Old
[58:57] Testament to give a
[59:01] birth you could not get the new birth in
[59:04] the Old
[59:07] Testament all right and you'd be
[59:09] surprised how much people don't believe
[59:10] that but that's all right I want to see
[59:12] where you got it I got some quotes this
[59:14] afternoon if we get
[59:17] time but remember Enoch had the six
[59:21] cents
[59:22] working yes sir
[59:27] but it was working only in the points of
[59:30] him of his
[59:33] belief and understanding it was not an
[59:37] inter in inter experience of the new
[59:42] birth because Jesus Christ has not been
[59:44] glorified
[59:46] John what is it 8:27 or something right
[59:49] in there because he had not been
[59:51] crucified how can you have the new birth
[59:53] without the death of the test stat as
[59:55] Paul said all right now use that and
[59:59] we'll come back to it
[1:00:00] later so we want to get to the six
[1:00:05] sense what is that six
[1:00:09] sense but R says
[1:00:11] it's
[1:00:15] faith and a faith is a
[1:00:19] revelation
[1:00:21] Revelation have you ever had a
[1:00:23] revelation amen
[1:00:26] and like I said your Revelation better
[1:00:28] fit the
[1:00:30] word you remember the guy telling
[1:00:32] brother brandham he said you know when
[1:00:34] he told him said you ought not be
[1:00:35] running around the country that lady
[1:00:37] like that said she got a bad reputation
[1:00:40] he said I want to straighten you out
[1:00:41] brother
[1:00:42] brandom and I had a vision he said
[1:00:45] immediately seen he had a dream he said
[1:00:47] but he said all that's well and good but
[1:00:49] said it won't fit the
[1:00:52] scripture amen well I I wonder did that
[1:00:56] change that man or did the man go right
[1:00:58] on believing what he wanted
[1:01:01] to you know it's hard to change people
[1:01:04] that they think they know what they're
[1:01:05] talking
[1:01:06] about
[1:01:10] right right I mean somebody thinks they
[1:01:13] know what they're talking
[1:01:18] about and you they'll spend years they
[1:01:21] have trying to find the scripture that
[1:01:24] says
[1:01:25] every tub was set on its own bottom that
[1:01:27] ain't in the scripture right that people
[1:01:31] read the Bible over and over trying to
[1:01:32] find it because it don't
[1:01:38] exist see it's our ideas that was taught
[1:01:42] Grandma mama and them believed that hell
[1:01:45] was eternal because they like to
[1:01:47] threaten you with it to try to make you
[1:01:49] line up and be a better person that's
[1:01:51] the main reason yes sir and you you know
[1:01:54] what I say around here don't you try to
[1:01:57] scare your kids and tell them that Jesus
[1:01:59] don't like you that's right at least
[1:02:01] whip them
[1:02:04] amen get to them by the bottom end of it
[1:02:08] with a
[1:02:10] hickory you get to their heads and they
[1:02:12] wind up in life and they're afraid of
[1:02:15] Jesus well I don't know where he loves
[1:02:17] me or hates me daddy said he hated
[1:02:20] me don't do it at least be man or woman
[1:02:23] enough to give them a fking the law
[1:02:26] might get us in trouble come on you're
[1:02:28] using those things and excuses
[1:02:33] now I'll get off of
[1:02:36] that but think about
[1:02:41] it faith is the six
[1:02:45] sense it's what we contact god
[1:02:49] with see the Christian then is supposed
[1:02:52] to live in a ring
[1:02:56] of the six
[1:03:00] sense we're not supposed to live in the
[1:03:03] five senses we have to because we're
[1:03:05] human beings we are you in the world
[1:03:07] come on all
[1:03:08] right but when we let them five senses
[1:03:11] rule
[1:03:17] us it'll take us
[1:03:22] down look what he says on number go to
[1:03:25] number seven try to skip a few of these
[1:03:28] this is taken from we would see Jesus
[1:03:34] 62712 in faith you know
[1:03:38] something it's just as
[1:03:40] positive as if you're sitting
[1:03:43] here it's more
[1:03:45] positive than you're sitting here it's a
[1:03:49] six sense five senses won't touch it
[1:03:52] it's a six sense five senses won't
[1:03:54] declare Faith at
[1:03:57] all it's a six sense and that six sense
[1:04:00] is the one that
[1:04:01] declares the whole armor of
[1:04:04] God and the whole armor of God is
[1:04:07] nothing
[1:04:09] that the one of the five senses will
[1:04:12] declare the whole armor of God is
[1:04:15] what love joy peace goodness meekness
[1:04:18] statue of perfect man Faith virture
[1:04:20] knowledge Temperance the armor of God if
[1:04:24] won't work through your five
[1:04:26] senses it's a dimension we talked about
[1:04:28] it's the armor of God the
[1:04:33] what love look Faith love joy peace
[1:04:37] longsuffering meekness gentleness
[1:04:39] patience who can declare that by some of
[1:04:41] your
[1:04:44] signs you can't do it it's a faith the
[1:04:48] six sense that goes out and declares it
[1:04:51] it's the substance of things hope
[1:04:54] far you don't see it you don't taste it
[1:04:57] you don't feel it you don't smell it you
[1:04:59] don't hear it you believe
[1:05:03] it we've been on faith now for so long
[1:05:06] until I'm just really getting tired of
[1:05:07] hearing so much about faith well that
[1:05:10] means you don't understand what's going
[1:05:11] on and you don't have any
[1:05:12] Revelation that no
[1:05:15] problem is any problem with me saying
[1:05:17] that back to
[1:05:20] you because I'm trying to talk about
[1:05:23] something that is more valuable to you
[1:05:26] and
[1:05:27] I than what you're thinking about what
[1:05:29] you're going to eat for lunch or what
[1:05:31] you're going to do or what it's going to
[1:05:33] happen you
[1:05:35] know it has to do with saving our soul
[1:05:38] because you can only be saved by
[1:05:42] faith come
[1:05:44] on atos Vision you can only be saved by
[1:05:47] faith you can only be saved by
[1:05:49] Revelation you can only be saved by the
[1:05:50] six
[1:05:53] sense
[1:05:55] and our problem is we live in five
[1:05:58] senses right if I can see it if I can
[1:06:02] feel it I can tell oh I'm
[1:06:05] happy but what about the six
[1:06:09] sense my brother I didn't know six sense
[1:06:11] is
[1:06:14] faith
[1:06:17] faith the substance of what you're
[1:06:19] asking
[1:06:20] for yes the six sense declares
[1:06:27] what you
[1:06:29] are five senses won't declare
[1:06:33] Faith the six sense is the one that
[1:06:38] declares see the human being is a
[1:06:41] marvelous piece of machinery and then
[1:06:44] these dumb idiots wants to say that
[1:06:45] we're fell off of a coconut tree or some
[1:06:49] kind of a
[1:06:52] tree and and to think about do you
[1:06:56] realize that that new birth that you
[1:06:59] have within you is the same God that
[1:07:03] created the
[1:07:08] world course the problem with believing
[1:07:10] and letting him
[1:07:12] speaking and you know what I've never
[1:07:15] found him to speak contrary to the
[1:07:19] word I had a great
[1:07:22] revelation
[1:07:24] and I wrote it down one
[1:07:27] time and I had about five pages wrote of
[1:07:31] notes and quotes and things and you know
[1:07:34] how I
[1:07:35] preach with a challenge to come show me
[1:07:37] I'm off the prophet's
[1:07:39] message and right in the middle of that
[1:07:42] great Revelation I had a little voice
[1:07:45] spoke and
[1:07:47] said if you do that you make your type
[1:07:51] greater than your
[1:07:52] antitype
[1:07:56] that was all it was
[1:08:00] said didn't take me through the Bible
[1:08:02] show me where I Wrong didn't take me
[1:08:05] through the prophet's quotes to show
[1:08:07] me he said if you make that he said then
[1:08:11] your type is greater than your antitype
[1:08:13] you know everybody know what it is a
[1:08:15] canoe is a Tope of a big old ocean liner
[1:08:18] boat you know this is the top that's the
[1:08:20] antip you know see in the Old Testament
[1:08:23] as I said want to go they had a lot of
[1:08:25] types and shadows which we are the
[1:08:27] Fulfillment of that types and shadows
[1:08:30] they spoke of Salvation we have that
[1:08:32] salvation type and anti type you know
[1:08:36] what I never searched to see whether
[1:08:37] there was anything right or wrong in
[1:08:39] what I
[1:08:41] done uh I burn
[1:08:44] it because no matter what was going on I
[1:08:47] knew I was
[1:08:52] wrong
[1:08:55] well I'd ask him what he meant I knew
[1:08:58] what he
[1:09:01] meant if your top is greater than your
[1:09:06] antip you're reversing the
[1:09:10] situation the little boat is a type of
[1:09:13] the big boat the big boat's not a type
[1:09:16] of the little boat you know little canoe
[1:09:18] that's
[1:09:20] right oh you know you're wrong it don't
[1:09:23] take got a lot to explain to people if
[1:09:26] you're sensible enough to
[1:09:28] listen all
[1:09:33] right let's read a couple more and then
[1:09:35] we'll just break off and go all right
[1:09:38] let's go to perseverance which is number
[1:09:41] eight paragraph 137 to
[1:09:44] 138 I know I'm jumping so faith is a
[1:09:47] substance of things hope for the
[1:09:49] evidence of Things Not Seen Faith sees
[1:09:51] what the blind people do doesn't
[1:09:58] see
[1:10:00] now Faith sees what blind people can't
[1:10:05] see now he's not talking about 2020
[1:10:08] Vision blind
[1:10:11] right that's not what you're talking
[1:10:13] about cuz that's the sea you're talking
[1:10:17] about what blind
[1:10:21] people is some I SA Book of Revelations
[1:10:25] right open their eyes all right faith is
[1:10:29] a six sense five senses are fine as
[1:10:33] long as they don't disagree with the
[1:10:37] six five is fine as long as they disree
[1:10:40] but the six sense is Faith see it's the
[1:10:43] tough and so sure that it's real that it
[1:10:46] comes to you a
[1:10:49] substance not just an
[1:10:52] imagination it's something than you
[1:10:55] have now you may not follow me and I'm
[1:10:59] sorry I try to do the best I can but you
[1:11:03] know I'm talking about that one of these
[1:11:06] days there's going to be a bride with a
[1:11:09] positive
[1:11:11] attitude that's going to by the six
[1:11:14] sense walk off this
[1:11:17] Earth that's what I'm talking
[1:11:21] about well all I hear you talking about
[1:11:23] Faith
[1:11:24] substances and you don't know what a
[1:11:27] revelation you never had one you ever
[1:11:29] had one you know what it
[1:11:31] is you've ever been
[1:11:33] healed of
[1:11:37] anything you know what I'm talking
[1:11:40] about but if you've never been healed
[1:11:43] you don't
[1:11:45] know if you've been saved you know what
[1:11:47] I'm talking about in
[1:11:49] Salvation but if you've never been saved
[1:11:51] you don't know what I'm talking about
[1:11:58] there the six sense which is
[1:12:02] Faith it's so sure that it comes to
[1:12:06] you a
[1:12:09] substance now a substance of what
[1:12:12] anything consists of with are natural
[1:12:14] and spiritual now if Ben hen and I'm not
[1:12:17] going to argue that he done
[1:12:20] it but they said he walked out in midair
[1:12:23] one day off the platform I'm not going
[1:12:25] to argue that that took
[1:12:28] place because you see I believe in a God
[1:12:31] that can do
[1:12:36] that but because you walk out in midair
[1:12:39] doesn't mean you're
[1:12:41] saved ain't going to do with it because
[1:12:44] the the God is walking over the cold of
[1:12:46] fire I'd he rather be the one trying to
[1:12:48] walk out in
[1:12:49] midair than walking on cold to fire
[1:12:53] right and you know what he enters a law
[1:12:57] of
[1:12:58] Faith snake handlers enter a law of
[1:13:02] Faith sure a lot of them die they print
[1:13:05] that they don't never print all of the
[1:13:07] thousands that are bitten that don't
[1:13:11] die they only print the one what my
[1:13:15] brother-in-law was laughing you know
[1:13:17] sitting at his house and he was we were
[1:13:19] looking at a thing years ago and they
[1:13:21] had the snakes and the man told him he
[1:13:23] said these are not warmed up cold down
[1:13:26] or anything they I was with them when
[1:13:28] they caught them in the woods put them
[1:13:30] in the box and come here to the church
[1:13:32] with
[1:13:33] them and they just reach down in that
[1:13:36] box and pick them snakes
[1:13:38] up handed over to this woman and she
[1:13:40] just was so happy rejoicing that old
[1:13:43] snake just sitting
[1:13:47] there I do know and I've understand some
[1:13:50] tricks of the
[1:13:51] trade make sure of one thing if you ever
[1:13:54] touch a snake don't touch it with a cold
[1:13:56] hand you going to get
[1:14:01] bit I know the tricks of the trait you
[1:14:04] don't believe me just go ask Brother Don
[1:14:06] again he's not here
[1:14:08] but a lot of you knew him he would pick
[1:14:11] up a snake he told me one day he said we
[1:14:14] have any trouble at the church I'll
[1:14:16] handle the snakes I said we have any
[1:14:17] trouble at chap we you will handle the
[1:14:22] snakes don't touch it with a cold hand
[1:14:26] it will bite you that's the change of
[1:14:30] doing but that man is doing those things
[1:14:32] then after while they lit a torch up and
[1:14:34] and the guy that's done his hand like
[1:14:36] that and wrecked it over one of these
[1:14:37] big torches that goes with solder solder
[1:14:41] and iron torches my brother all life he
[1:14:43] saw anybody can do that that guy just
[1:14:45] stuck his hand over like that and the
[1:14:47] fire was running through his
[1:14:49] fingers I said don't life you wouldn't
[1:14:52] do it n
[1:14:54] either what I'm talking about people can
[1:14:58] enter a law of
[1:15:00] Faith which enters into a realm of the
[1:15:03] six
[1:15:04] sense but it's only through their being
[1:15:07] part and not an inward
[1:15:09] experience because an inward experience
[1:15:12] of the new birth and the things you
[1:15:14] don't need a snake handling proof you
[1:15:16] don't need tongues as an Evidence you
[1:15:18] don't need those
[1:15:21] things you don't need to cry or shout or
[1:15:25] amen you're a Christian all the
[1:15:30] time CU you got a
[1:15:33] substance all
[1:15:36] right let me get a
[1:15:41] couple let's get this one at
[1:15:44] least faith is a substance preached in
[1:15:47] 47 paragraph
[1:15:49] 48 now listen real close and give me
[1:15:51] your attention now the sense five senses
[1:15:54] is that right C tast Phil smelling here
[1:15:57] is that right them five senses contact
[1:16:00] the entire control excuse me the entire
[1:16:03] human body is that true CT C tast fi
[1:16:06] smelling here and there's one of
[1:16:08] them that declare Faith now you got to
[1:16:10] listen to this quote you're going to
[1:16:13] twist it there's none of them that
[1:16:16] declare
[1:16:19] Faith there's none of the senses declare
[1:16:22] faith
[1:16:23] but they're connected to your
[1:16:26] faith God faith comes by hearing all
[1:16:28] right listen faith is a six sense known
[1:16:31] to some
[1:16:32] people as you want to as mental
[1:16:37] telepathy
[1:16:39] listen or whatever you want to wish to
[1:16:42] call
[1:16:43] it many of them call it
[1:16:46] names but to me it's
[1:16:52] faith and that is in and above all five
[1:16:55] senses of the human body you see what I
[1:16:58] mean listen faith is the only direct and
[1:17:02] positive
[1:17:03] sense and it's the six sense faith is
[1:17:07] more than sight faith is more than
[1:17:10] feeling you do not feel Faith you don't
[1:17:12] taste Faith you don't smell Faith you
[1:17:15] don't see
[1:17:16] faith faith is the substance of things
[1:17:18] hope far the evidence of things not me I
[1:17:21] want one if I can find it okay get the
[1:17:24] next one then we'll quit all right this
[1:17:27] is taken from conference who preach in
[1:17:30] 1960 uh
[1:17:31] 108
[1:17:33] E21 now that's your Earthly senses and
[1:17:35] they were not given to you to guide you
[1:17:38] but God sent the holy go Holy Spirit and
[1:17:41] he's your
[1:17:43] guide now you know what he's going to
[1:17:45] right the six sense that makes you
[1:17:47] believe things that you can't see taste
[1:17:49] feel smell and hear that six sense
[1:17:52] something that raise you up and only one
[1:17:55] class of people has that six
[1:17:59] sense that's
[1:18:05] Believers now remember Sinners can
[1:18:09] believe to a
[1:18:10] degree but he's not talking about that
[1:18:12] now because the quotes we get into this
[1:18:14] evening we'll be going more into it's
[1:18:17] only for the Born Again believer the
[1:18:19] born- again believer walks in a realm of
[1:18:21] Faith supposed too that's wherewe our
[1:18:23] trouble's
[1:18:25] at we walk by our
[1:18:28] sights we look at people by our sights
[1:18:31] we see people and we don't like what we
[1:18:34] see because of our sights but as I said
[1:18:38] the other day and I I'm just telling you
[1:18:40] it happen so you can do what you want to
[1:18:41] do if God ever lets you stand and look
[1:18:44] and back up and I did and just backed up
[1:18:46] in my whole head my eyes and everything
[1:18:49] and looked out at a person and saw them
[1:18:51] as God saw them change my
[1:18:55] thinking he said well I ain't never done
[1:18:57] that well if you believe me believe I
[1:19:00] did because I've told it 40 years ago it
[1:19:03] ain't a new doctrine come up this week
[1:19:06] all
[1:19:08] right so he says there's only one class
[1:19:11] of people that has that sick sense
[1:19:14] that's Believers Hebrews 111 says by
[1:19:17] faith and without faith is impossible to
[1:19:19] please God so God gives man faith and
[1:19:23] faith is a six sense that makes you deny
[1:19:25] anything that's contrary to his word
[1:19:28] well that's a precious treasure in the
[1:19:31] mind of God and in the heart of God what
[1:19:34] for a person to believe
[1:19:36] him how many times listen to brother R
[1:19:39] and listen to how many times brother R
[1:19:41] say God believed his own
[1:19:46] word well that's his precious treasure
[1:19:48] in the mind of God and in the heart of
[1:19:51] God that he can use that person until we
[1:19:53] get to a place that we're we're do not
[1:19:56] rely upon these five senses of contact
[1:19:59] to early home and walk by faith whether
[1:20:02] just shall live by faith what the church
[1:20:04] needs is a new
[1:20:06] birth a baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:20:10] touch of the six sense that sets the
[1:20:13] soul on fire for God that's touched to
[1:20:16] bring him out of the
[1:20:18] rut come on brothers that's what we
[1:20:21] need amen we need the new
[1:20:26] birth but yet how many people's going to
[1:20:28] say that they don't have the new
[1:20:32] birth you can't tell me I ain't born
[1:20:37] again not going to do it I'm going to
[1:20:41] let the word tell
[1:20:46] you you deny the word don't tell me
[1:20:49] you're born
[1:20:51] again
[1:20:53] don't talk to me about it I'm sorry too
[1:20:55] old I guess don't talk to me about that
[1:20:59] you believe it all but you don't believe
[1:21:01] this a little bit
[1:21:03] here like I said the other day all these
[1:21:05] doctrines and all these ideas and then
[1:21:07] here comes along all these people saying
[1:21:09] how wrong brother brandham is he's wrong
[1:21:12] here in the seals he's wrong there he's
[1:21:15] wrong
[1:21:16] there well tell them he was wrong on
[1:21:18] marriage and divorce and they'll fight
[1:21:21] you
[1:21:25] they'll believe that
[1:21:27] one well if he's wrong the seals I
[1:21:30] thought he
[1:21:31] said may I quote him I thought he said
[1:21:34] that marriage and divorce was revealed
[1:21:36] in the
[1:21:39] seals so he's wrong the seals but he's
[1:21:42] right over
[1:21:46] here you're no more than a muhammadan
[1:21:49] or the muhammadans will tell you or
[1:21:52] which one of it is islamics they'll tell
[1:21:55] you the Bible is
[1:21:57] right in the parts they think is
[1:22:01] right but it's wrong in the parts they
[1:22:04] don't
[1:22:07] believe I'm just probably dumb enough to
[1:22:09] believe the whole
[1:22:11] Bible let's stand together and let's
[1:22:14] just think about faith and this
[1:22:17] afternoon we'll get down to where they
[1:22:19] brother around and says only the
[1:22:21] Christian has that real sick
[1:22:24] sense CU everybody else he is is living
[1:22:27] down in a lower level that have never
[1:22:30] went on into the fullness they have
[1:22:33] received it for healings they've
[1:22:35] received it for things look at your Old
[1:22:37] Testament Saints every one of those Old
[1:22:39] Testament Saints had a faith for the
[1:22:42] time but none of it gave them a
[1:22:45] Salvation that's
[1:22:47] right come on open your Bible and
[1:22:51] read Moses went across Enoch
[1:22:55] done Elijah done but none of it talks
[1:22:58] about salvation that's
[1:23:02] right CU see there was no new birth
[1:23:05] salvation back
[1:23:07] there there was no six sense that could
[1:23:10] get within the sight of the man until
[1:23:13] the Holy Ghost came to cleanse that
[1:23:17] man but now it can be in you and I Faith
[1:23:21] the six s what do we got number 24 24
[1:23:24] anybody have a need your alt is open D
[1:23:28] not
[1:23:35] what you have a need coming let's pray
[1:23:38] and
[1:23:40] see I believe the same God that created
[1:23:43] the world didn't die when brother Ron
[1:23:48] died I believe it became
[1:23:51] greater I don't mind saying
[1:23:54] that it became greater by the pising of
[1:23:58] the Prophet because the people got their
[1:24:01] eyes off the
[1:24:05] man got to getting into what he was
[1:24:08] talking
[1:24:14] about I'm living by
[1:24:19] fi it's coming to let
[1:24:21] believe come and let's
[1:24:24] believe let's see if God is
[1:24:28] real our sister came this morning and we
[1:24:32] had a quite a good discussion she just
[1:24:35] wants to come and
[1:24:38] repent say she's sorry for the way she's
[1:24:40] being wants to change her

[1:25:06] got the problems so there's nobody in
[1:25:09] the building that hasn't come through
[1:25:14] problems we don't look at the problems

[1:25:24] know I didn't ask to be a
[1:25:28] Dale my my family got me

[1:25:43] and tell him how good I am or no no what
[1:25:46] is coming boldly it means simply to
[1:25:50] come and to realize he invited
[1:25:57] you I know I'm carnal but get it if the
[1:26:02] Queen of England invited me to come it
[1:26:06] wouldn't matter what clothes I put

[1:36:28] Shadow or sunshine or
[1:36:31] rain Lord I know Ru for
[1:36:35] everything and all of my worri
[1:36:40] is living by
[1:36:45] faith in
[1:36:49] Jesus just say it
[1:36:54] just say
[1:36:58] it say I'm Healed I'm
[1:37:07] delivered anybody
[1:37:17] else sister Joyce has got a testimony
[1:37:19] she wants to give so just come ahead
[1:37:20] sister
[1:37:26] okay go ahead Terence won't get me but
[1:37:29] um uh back in December I went to the eye
[1:37:32] doctor and um he told me that my
[1:37:35] pressure was high on my eyes and my dad
[1:37:37] and my grandmother had glaucoma so when
[1:37:41] I left there I says Lord there's nothing
[1:37:43] I can do you've got to do it there's
[1:37:45] nothing I can't lose weight I can't you
[1:37:48] know it's my eyes you you got to take
[1:37:49] care of them so and I actually I was
[1:37:51] supposed to go back in March and I
[1:37:53] actually forgot about the appointment
[1:37:54] and they called me and I went for the
[1:37:57] appointment and when I got in there and
[1:37:59] they text me um he
[1:38:01] says you you've just got a little high
[1:38:03] normal he says you're fine and so I'm
[1:38:06] just believe he said just come on back
[1:38:08] in December so I'm really believing you
[1:38:10] know that it'll be a low normal when I
[1:38:12] go back in
[1:38:13] December but the second testimony is as
[1:38:16] y'all all know and I y'all heard the
[1:38:18] story so I'll be real brief about that
[1:38:20] but I really believe believe when we
[1:38:21] were in Denver Colorado I think that if
[1:38:25] we'd have been 3 minutes later that
[1:38:27] plane would have left I mean I know we
[1:38:29] had the ticket but I always love the
[1:38:31] story brother brandham told about that
[1:38:33] that lady and him walking down the
[1:38:34] street I mean it happened to us I mean I
[1:38:37] really believe that plane was held for
[1:38:39] us and it was for some reason amen for
[1:38:42] us to see it but then the other
[1:38:44] testimony is um I've had a lot of ups
[1:38:47] and downs in the last seven years and I
[1:38:50] have wore a prayer cloth like 98% of the
[1:38:53] time to work I've got a prayer cloth on
[1:38:55] my desk and by the way we had the prayer
[1:38:58] cloths on us in Denver
[1:39:00] too but um right but anyway we just sat
[1:39:04] back and watched that but anyway I've
[1:39:06] wore pray cloth I mean I'd say at least
[1:39:09] 98% of the time and when brother Ryan
[1:39:12] come up here that night about his job I
[1:39:14] just set in my heart I'm believing with
[1:39:17] you Ry believing for myself and for you
[1:39:20] and I started new job next Monday amen I
[1:39:23] thank God for
[1:39:30] it see he's
[1:39:32] God and he's
[1:39:35] real he'll take care of everything we
[1:39:37] have a need of
[1:39:50] yes
[1:40:01] don't
[1:40:02] you you shall receive it's too
[1:40:06] simple right it's too simple to just ask
[1:40:11] and then just wait and let it work its
[1:40:13] way out oh it's wonderful to deliver all
[1:40:16] at once wonderful we believe that we've
[1:40:19] seen that but then when it takes time
[1:40:22] that's that's what builds patience
[1:40:25] within you to bring it to the right
[1:40:28] place amen and amen father we love you
[1:40:32] Lord thank you for your testimonies

[1:41:53] dialysis and it wouldn't give him a
[1:41:55] dialysis because his
[1:41:58] liver couldn't stand it or something and
[1:42:01] they found another place that was going
[1:42:03] to give him a dialysis
[1:42:05] treatment and the University Hospital
[1:42:08] would let it go I don't know what's
[1:42:11] happened since then but I sent him
