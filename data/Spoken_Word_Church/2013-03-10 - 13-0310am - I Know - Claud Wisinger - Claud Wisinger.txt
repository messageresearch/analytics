TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you very much waiting and my family I can sleep somewhere somewhere else is have you heard your name called right through the opening of the YouTube we had a real good time yesterday and The Minister's meeting remember something good safe trip up and back and fellowship together and remember this coming weekend it will be the fellowship meeting at brother pageant if you want to go with us make sure you let us know ahead of time not on that day to call you know but just remember and I think that's basically all the announcements and just remember that I'd rather have a brother called my singer with us today about house Mr Ginger with us because everywhere that he's at that's the only thing that's worth anything is hurt amen amen not just kidding but we're just looking forward to the word of the Lord so let's just go right on the end of the service and sing Open the Eyes of My Heart yes brother singer Bartlesville Oklahoma comes to speak the word of the Lord amen foreign Holy Holy Holy Spirit all the way home hey man hey man that's true it's wonderful I believe this is a generation where we've come face to face Amanda brother Ram said in the uh the church age book it's complete realization you know I'm not proven anymore brother that's right I'm not probing that this message we have thus saith the Lord we have a perfect interpretation of this message we have perfect Faith that's coming this way right so I'm not guessing anymore I'm not filming right we have thus saith Lord or we keep still that's what he said is that right so it's just a it's just a very powerful message that we have in this hour right and uh I'm just glad I happen to be here to be able to receive it right from Atlanta does it make me something special not really matter of fact the more Revelation you get the more it humbles one of the last messages brother Brandon preach was humble thyself right and I believe if you want humility if God gives you a revelation I don't believe it'll give you a big head and exaltion I believe when you get a revelation it will so if you get a revelation it makes you think you're this big somebody then uh I'm really questioning your Revelation I'll just be honest it's good to be here it's good to be with brother Samuel and if I lived in Lula or around this area this is where I built a church I love coming here because I can feel the Liberty to say what's on my heart and I know if I messed something up that man will straighten it out I'm just uh I'm not an evangelist I'm not a missionary I'm a pastor and I very seldom get away from the little church there they really don't want me to go I mean they make me feel so guilty when I travel they'll tell me almost everybody there told me we don't want you to go brother Claude but I just sometimes you just need to get away and have a little vacation rest your mind and your body it's been uh the last year's been a real struggle on my body I've I had a pneumonia and a bladder infection in December the first part of the month and it's never gone away I've been on five bouts of antibiotics and antibiotics just tear me up it's just really physically I'm in rough shape at the end of the second service I've asked brother Samuel brother Wade to pray for me and I told the church the only way I quit preaching is when my toes go up all right and I'm gonna keep saying this message I'm going to keep Ministry and I'm present day truth until I die I'm going to be honest with you so when I believe uh the Rapture is at hand I don't believe we have very many days to wait right uh you know God's been long long suffering toward us word we're not waiting on him he's waiting on us right yeah okay so the real problem is us to get ourself out of the way let go without God and that's what God's trying to get in the bride is preeminence in the church is that right so anyway I I appreciate each and every one of you pray for me if you would in the days ahead I'm actually supposed to have a surgery about 10 days when I get back so they don't know exactly what's wrong with me but I really don't want to get it done and fighting it I really don't want it so you pray for me please I'd like to read a scripture to start out in Hebrews 4 and 2 and I believe this is a real problem that's among the ministry can I tell you that and about some of the people in the church so let's read this I want to title the sermon today I know and I don't I'm not talking about just me that I don't know I want you to say I know amen because what Brethren said it's going to take a personal experience a personal revelation from you right and what a revelation is it's when you know he gets flat no man there's no doubt there's no there's no shadow in it at all I believe we've come and I've said it to the complete realization to where I can say I know now some people may say brother Claude you're a know-it-all no I'm not but I want to tell you something by this message I know right I have a spiritual understanding that there's no devil in hell can talk me away there's no devil hell could talk me away from this message nothing I cannot fall away around that right you fall away justification you can fall away at sanctification but you can't fall away where I'm at right man is that right and each and every one of you have to have a Pentecostal experience is that right I mean the Pentecostal spirit is an original experience it's not created or dogmaed it's an original experience of one-on-one with God okay so let's read Hebrews four and two let's go there first yeah she'll put it up there for me for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed and I put United okay with faith right okay and then that hurt it right Ram said a drunk on the street could hear the message but if they don't have it in faith to unite with what they hear right they're not going to get it is that right that's right so we have many people even in message churches that have heard the message but they're not they don't have faith that's why we have such a great Falling Away now brother Branham said faith is higher than your intellect right right so we've had people that heard it and have caught it by their natural intellect but they don't have a revelation right brother random said there's nothing higher than a revelation there's no such prevailing or as a revelation amen right so what we need to pray for more than our necessary meat is what he said was a revelation from God that's right once you get that Revelation then you could say I know right right is that right it's not I'm probing I think it's this way I believe it Brethren said you ain't got a thought coming right but it's I know okay now look here's a couple of instances in the scripture where they say I know okay for I know is job 19 and 25 that's right remember uh job is on his ass sheet for seven days is that what brother Graham said right you know what the sheep was it was a dunk yeah and he was down in the dumps can I say it that's what I keep on I use okibonics okay job was down how many have been down in the dumps see we we spend time on our ass sheet just like job did right do you know Jesus was what died on Golgotha and it was a place of the skull there's three holes you know what those three holes wears where they burnt City trash did you know that they took their trash in Jerusalem yeah they took it out on golgoth and they burned it in those holes they literally crucified our Lord in a dump right right you know the greatest Revelation that ever came was in a dump right Jesus was on his ass sheet what a great Revelation is that right and he said it's finished how much greater can a revelation be it's finished is that right amen all that the law had wrote about it it was finished right there and that same way with you you get on your ass sheep you think well I've got depression I've got this that or the other big deal quit feeling sorry for yourself right we all go through that we're humans right right but at that hour God will bring you the greatest Revelation in that time okay so do I believe there's gonna be pressure on the church yeah yeah do I believe we're gonna have to be on our ass sheet yep sure do amen so just just deal with it quit being a baby we we got the message let's let's believe what our prophets says okay for I know that my redeemer will liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth right so job said I know what did job had or a revelation right right right God had revealed something and he said I know in my flesh I'll see him right so job received a great Revelation and it was no such prevailing power right there's that Revelation that he received John 4 and 25 the woman saith in him I know that Messiah that messiah's cometh which is called price when he come he will tell us all things amen amen what did she have she had a revelation yeah right is that right she had something the scribes and the Pharisees didn't have right right they had the letter of the word you could stick a pen through a rolled up document they can tell you the letter that he had gone through but what they didn't have was a revelation right they did not know and there's even scripture that I have in all these notes here that I can't feel through but it said you know what they took from the people knowledge right you know what they did they took the Commandments that Moses did they created a Torah and they become dependent on the do's and the don'ts rather than the actual word itself right isn't that what they did you go look at the tour it's like 316 do's and don'ts that they contrived from the law of Moses is that right if they had just left it alone just left it as it was right thus saith the Lord it would have been much better for the people right but what did they do by their knowledge by their intellect they preached it away from the people right is that right so we've had a prophet in this hour to come and to bring us a revelation to bring it back to us is what it was right so that's what I want to say I know so and it's not and I say I don't want you to look at me when I say all right but I'm gonna have to I want it to be personal right I as a personal pronoun you have to get to the point where you say I know amen exactly where a preacher can't come and preach the Revelation if if he can come and take it away from you you never had a revelation because once you get a revelation it's rock solid it's a stone you understand it's something that's a what is Faith it's a foundation amen well it appeared men what was it look it's a foundation what does foundation mean it's established when you get a foundation out it's established that's right right and is that right so we we have been the that we have been restored to the faith of the fathers amen does everybody agree with that so I could say this morning I want you to say along with me I know I I know dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the real word we pray that you'll break it down to the people oh God lord I know the ministry here is just a very strong Ministry Lord and I can't come and I'm not going to preach a different Christ or to bring a new revelation I'm just going to preach what you put on my heart on father and I pray that your equipment to the congregation oh God and just bless them now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen uh if you would show that slide on conduct order and Doctrine I've actually started it's been almost a year now that I've been preaching on a conduct order in Doctrine yeah but you know the Little Red Book everybody's got that right that was put together by Roy borders I believe the Roy borders was really led by the Holy Spirit and doing that right because I in my heart I started you know we do like like you do you do different series on Revelations I've done a Hebrews series we do Daniel 70 weeks I did like 18 sermons on it and what we try to do as ministers Brethren said get in the cooling room I couldn't answer the conversation that's what we're supposed to do we're always going to read between the lines what are we supposed to do mix it with face right man what we've got around the message of ours a bunch of preachers when they argue with you you know what they'll do so brother Ram said this over here and then we'll say well he said this over here yeah but what they don't do is if you've got to take those two congregations and if you don't mix it with faith right what do you what are you arguing you're saying they said something different here than what he said there right and they'll say oh damn and I'm going to use it because uh it's I think it's just something that's just abused bad it's Daniel's 70 weeks right he'll say well brother random said this over here you got a progressive revelation you said this over here yeah and like I've told people I really get annoyed when they say the word Progressive you know why I can't find in the message I'll challenge anybody that has the message put the word Progressive in see if you find it right but I will tell you it's the stimulation of Revelation man what does why do it gets stronger with AIDS so brother Brandon what did he do pre he preached his understanding that he had in that hour is that right but they say over here in the seals we'll run around change that there's only three and a half years left not seven yeah well they don't understand brother random in the beginning of the first seal he's from Daniel 70 weeks right what he's trying to get to is the ministry the son of man Ministry And that son of man Ministry is seven years well that Jews only have three and a half years left the ministry so when brother rabbit is commenting about only three and a half left he's talking about they only have three and a half years of ministry but the reason the preachers fail they don't mix it with faith right amen and the people that believe that three and a half they won't even show the the chart where he showed seven we've got handwritten notes at a restaurant where he showed Brothers this is the way it is he hit another so there's two there two witnesses where brother random wrote it down did Brother Brown remember say my chart was wrong he said no eight times a day and he said look at my chart if you want to understand that look at the chart I mean I don't find anywhere in the seals anywhere well brother Graham said I was wrong if Daniel send me wings all right but I will show you 1954 when he preached the seals when he came to preach the seals here in 6 C3 he said I didn't have it right then I preach it like Larkin I preached it like Uriah Smith right because why the Thunders had not uttered yet does everybody understand that the Thunders had to uttered yet to reveal the mystery tooth truce that was contained Under the Sea that's right amen Okay so what I want you I want you you should I know we know can I say it out way we should come now to where the confusion's out of the message confusions it's always been the preachers that are the confused right Amen in the days of Moses there were 70 preachers that come to him right one marriage and divorce wasn't it right and they said what are we going to do Moses here we got this problem what are we going to do what was it a bunch of confused preachers right who straightened it up Moses so if we got a bunch of confused preachers around the message why don't they go to the message why don't they go to the desk they'll do is they'll take a quote here and they'll isolate the quote and you go to scripture in isolate a quote yeah and if you do that it says go do likewise and then once says go hang yourself so we all going to go hang ourselves now you isolate scripture you'll have it all messed up that's right amen but what we don't have in the message is among the preachers what are they doing they're not getting the continuity of the message what is it a lack of faith they don't have faith they're not taking they're not taking the clothes and mixing it with faith exactly that's exactly what happened when Jesus was here the scribes and the Pharisees the ministry at that hour did not mix it with faith amen and because they didn't mix it with faith They Crucified him amen right right is that right they had all the quotes right they had the law right the scripture says the law is perfect converting the soul does everybody understand the law is perfect right amen it really is and we'll get into this I'm almost getting going I gotta warm up a little while okay but what I started in our church was I took the little red bus I'm gonna preach a series on conduct order and Doctrine well so I come on guys we ought to have the conduct down right but you can't pick up a tape or brother Ramsey don't tell you women don't cut your hair and tell your men that you're supposed to be honest don't do a bad deal right if you're out there doing bad deals do you know you're not even into Jubilee no that's right exactly amen I've got a scripture in Romans that tells you the Jubilee State yeah I believe we're in Jubilee time right right and at the time of the Jubilee it says oh no man anything right did you know in the Jubilee when the time came for the release that you you all your debts were paid right right you were all the same if if you'd see I got land you got land we got the same amount of land but if you hopped your land because you made some bad deals right at the time of the 50 the golden jubilee when it sounded you could throw down your hole you could go home right does everybody agree with that that's what it is that's what the Jubilee is so at that point you owe no man anything amen so if you're spending bad deals out there if you're out of business what you're you're old people yeah you're owing them you're not in a jubilee State all right we can says don't commit adultery in the Romans I think it's 13. if you go read the scripture that's talking about a jubilee state right so we as bride should be in the state of Jubilee right man if everybody agree with that you should be shouldn't be patient you shouldn't be an adultery you shouldn't be lying you shouldn't be stealing right if you're in a jubilee State you're not going to be doing those things that's right and if you're doing them you're not in a jubilee State because Jubilee is a state it's something it's a being do you understand that's what Jubilee is about right so there's there's where we have to be as a church right and I believe the bride comes to that amen and I'm gonna be honest with you I don't know who it is or who haven't been here some of you may be Church some of you may be drunk right you know the church gets Sanctified once sure yeah but they didn't go on to get the Holy Ghost right that's right you could be sitting right here in this church and you don't have the Holy Ghost you're going to be tribulation Saints right yeah yeah does everybody understand what I'm saying right you as long as you don't reject this message brother Adam said you reject this message you go straight on the head all right amen so you're going to go through tripping you're gonna bust it why I don't go right to hell if you reject this man right right man right right so we can't I hope everybody's got conduct down yeah is your life worthy of the Gospel isn't that pretty easy every tape everything brother man tells us about her conduct now order does everybody understand what order really is it's law right now what keeps order law right what keeps the order in America law right so see we all have the law now brother man said in one thing and and I don't remember if this is seals I've been I want to get to the seals here in a minute I'm just trying to get warmed up I gotta get warmed up Peggy yeah all right so that's where I'm at so what is it the order is law you understand remember in Malachi 4 it says that that Elijah is going to restore our faith back to the apostolic fathers do you know what the faith of the apostolic's fathers were law I know that kind of may shock you but brother random said it there's one quote I found where I thought well sure it is sure look what's going to be so easy look the Malachi the Elijah that comes to the Jews is not going to restore him to the law no no they never left it right the Jews never left the law it was the Gentiles that left the law I know go out to any Baptist go out there and it's hope you know you log on apply Deuteronomy 22 reply all right the state of jubilee don't apply anymore right most message churches you you believe the message you pretty well do what you want yeah preacher's gonna be married two three times times right no that's chaos that's job order right the opposite of the law or order is chaos right now so what what did our Prophet do He restored us back to the apostolic the faith of the absolute father amen what was the faith of the Arkansas absolutely thought Brethren said the prophets preached Moses all of them preached a portion right Jesus was the fullest of the word the law standing there right Jesus came not to do away with the law but to fulfill one man the law was fulfilled In the Flesh of Jesus Christ amen right and the and the apostles all accepted the Christ right right what has happened through the church ages through the dogma and the Creeds the Holy Ghost has been bound again through the church ages so we had to have a prophet to come and preach Jubilee to sound the trumpet so what restore our faith back to the apostolic fathers the law to put Law and Order back into the church so don't tell me order is not important order is very important yes sir that's one of the two things the prophet is supposed to do restore law to restore order into the church and yet you go into some messy churches and it's a mess there's no law there's no order it's chaos is that what it is you go too you'd have been around you here right preachers falling right and left people dropping out of the message chaos is that right you know what what really gets me you got people now they're dropping out I'm sorry I just uh not a wind a little bit anyway you get people in and we hear it they say well what about 1977 what about Daniel what do you think they're falling out for creatures aren't explaining it why are some of these people falling away the failure of the ministry we'll get over the people and say oh they're Antichrist we'll just throw them away now a lot of it's the fault of the music you know why do they have questions all day because the preacher won't preach it what do you expect them to do right and so you got this man over here preacher saying this and this one's saying that their preacher won't even comment on it he says well that's to the Jews yeah it is it makes me sick when we're supposed to be in Revelation 10 where we're eating the whole book right right last time I checked Daniel was a part of the book am I missing something or am I just stupid or what so they'll say well that's to the Jews redemptions to us yeah amen they won't even take it and try to explain it get in the cooling room and break it down for the people why Hebrews 42 they haven't mixed it with faith right Amen brother faithless much is what it is amen so order and you know I was reading in the fifth seal do you know that Joseph when he was sitting there put his brothers in order because Joseph which they didn't know was Joseph I know is that right they didn't know it was his brother they didn't know what they didn't even identified yet he put them right in the order of their birth right right and they Marvel because they were an orders don't tell Joseph's the perfect type of crime man right if he don't want you in order why did Joseph put his brothers in order right do you see what I'm saying so what happens is we say well you know it's the grace age well look brother Ram explained the difference in law and Grace is everybody agreed remember I said the lawyers you're going out on the highway It says 55 miles an hour right Grace is that you do 55 miles an hour Grace is not that you do 60 right so what is Grace it's the Fulfillment of the law right man right what was Jesus he was graced to that generation he was the Fulfillment of the law right sure what was our Prophet to this generation that's right Grace what was he doing he was absolutely fulfilling the law all right man Amen brother Brown never did away with the law never never never did he matter of fact he made it so vivid and so real to me when I read Ruth I see me there right amen when I see the children of Israel going across the desert I see me there right everywhere I read in the Old Testament I put my name in there is that what you do all right that's right why because I have such faith I have Grace it's just been right there's so much of it I'm identified with right amen so conduct order is important and this is what I've been preaching at the church now Doctrine right right the doctrine is Jesus Christ is that right right so I'm not going to skirt around Daniel 70 weeks I if I see something where where quoting a message looks like here and there it's saying something different you know what I do I start praying yep I'll say God your Prophet could not contradict himself amen this man could not bring in God's Not the author of confusion God don't say one thing here and another thing there right and if brother Brandon was going to change what he said then he'd have said it over here when I preached in 54 I just preach what Larkin said I preach what Uriah Smith said what Brethren preaching this seals was not a plagiarism it was not Uriah Smith it was not what Larkin preached right if you think that you better go read it again you don't have faith a revelation what our Prophet preached out to see him that's right there are people now on the internet saying he plagiarized them no he did when he preached the seals he did not plagiarize he had the Thunders the Mysteries that was contained in those days amen Larkin didn't have it none of the church age Messengers had right our Prophet did not plagiarize no you had thus said what I want to get on today is the doctrine okay and I noticed that I look at the internet okay and I know he's been preaching in the Book of Revelations that's what I've been doing I actually called up to order a doctor and I preached to it you get the middle of the book it says questions answers on the seals so I sat down I said okay now I gotta stop and I need to go over the seals again because we had some new people in church and I got to thank you well if it seals blend in with the church ages right we are not going to understand the church ages if you don't get they know or the seals if you don't get there in your 70 weeks so what did I do I started doing it book a revelation all right that's what you got to do as a preacher right you get new people in you just have to hit it again keep going keep going so I reached on the church ages I preached on Daniel 70 weeks uh I preach on the fifth uh chapter of Revelations right Planet Redemption is that what brother fourth chapter Rebel it's the Rapture right right then we go into six one through eight one is the seals right that's where I've been I've been doing it since I was here the last time I was in a breach when I was here last time now I've gone I'm I'm into fifth seal so I'm gonna take them past the fifth seal today I may mention some things on The Sixth Seal but I've done some stuff I haven't mentioned some things on the seventh but that's where I want to take you to okay and one thing that come up I said I just went to hear a preacher preach uh around Bartlesville London Bartlesville but I heard a preacher preach okay and uh we were talking and I I was in the first seal and I said well I said the seals open Brother Band said the seals open on Earth he said in the breach he said it was open in heaven yeah right and we were talking and he took the stand it was open to Heaven I didn't say it was a little nerve yeah right and I got to thinking well either a were both wrong B one of us is wrong one of us is right yeah we're both right yeah right there's something so I went back I said Lord what tell me what how could brother Randy the breach say it was open in heaven and he did take the quotes and say if I'm not saying the truth right and then he turns around and says well in the first day it's open on Earth is that right so there has to be a revelation in that right right you're going to have to mix faith in there to get those two quotes amen so see that's what we have in the message among some of the ministers now they're they're they're they're going just goofy doctrines I don't know how else to say it okay what is it they don't have Revelations what it is they we've had quote quotas we've had Jehovah Witness they're readers right we got all sorts of preachers can read the quotes right right you said that and I'll never forget that bugs me all the time certain things somebody hit really strikes a chord with me and I can't get away from it I'm like a Pit Bull with a bone okay once I get the bone it's going to take some time for me you to pull it away from me but I thought about what she said it's true what we got among the message is a bunch of Jehovah Witnesses yeah right the readers they can read the quotes but they don't have any faith in what they're reading right so they read a quote over here and later on they read a quote on the first seal over here this seal sounds like it contradicts that seal now we've got a big confusion chaos going on in the message we got this preacher says well this is what I believe it means this is what I believe it means why don't they ask God for a revelation there's where we need to get as a Ministry but what we do is in our own natural cells we're know-it-alls oh yeah right you know scripture says in the last days there'll be heady high-minded lovers and pleasure more left heading high-minded Brethren says know it all right now I believe I am but know it all right spiritually speaking Yeah does everybody understand right now now let me let me let me go back because you're going to kind of go crazy on me here people hear this on the internet are I believe I know yeah right I believe I have a revelation and I believe I'm spot on with my Revelation and you're going to have to move me off from it right job had a revelation and you couldn't move him up from right he said I know my redeemer limit right that woman said I know you're the Messiah something describes the Pharisees didn't have right what was it I know is a revelation amen did you know that's what a revelation is it's something that you know do you have any physical proof of it no and yes you're right brother it's both ways just like brother random said this okay when Brethren made this statement said worry causes cancer we didn't have any proof of that right but I believed it right because why I received a prophet I believe what brother Brahm said was right right and I heard here three or four years in science they said worry causes cancer if it's the true science it will agree with what your ideas exactly so you're right faith is a substance it is real is that right amen so he's right it's both right you understand what I'm saying Faith brings him on the scene right it's impossible to please God without faith amen amen what is Faith it's a revelation glory is that right amen so when we I know the church changes yeah right you're not going to move me off from it right I know Daniel 70 weeks by a revelation I know the seals by a revelation right that's right I know the godhead by Revelation everything I know is by Revelation amen without it you can't please God exactly and what is a revelation these people had a revelation what was it they knew right and they could say I know right the Roman Centurion and I'm gonna paraphrase it but this is really what he was saying he said I know right yeah I know you being a man said I know rather man paraphrased it that way if you heard that I know that if you'll speak the word my serpent back home will be real why he had a revelation right is that right the woman that had an issue for 12 years wasn't it she said I know if I can touch the him of His Garment I'll be healed what did she have a revelation see there's no such prevailing powers of Revelation you have a revelation ask what you will and it will be given unto you right ask what you will count on this guy to do all of our praying yeah right to do it all when are you going to grow up all right amen right when are you going to speak now say the third goal is just for the preachers the third pool was for sister how you write amen you know what she did when he sat there and told her that he spoke squirrels into existence was there any Scripture well Moses did it so she must have she must have knew well if Moses can do it brother Reynold can do it too he's a prophet like an unto most she had a revelation of who that man was right and she said that ain't nothing but the truth in other words she was saying I know that's the truth right exactly and by her knowing did God come down in that room and said ask what you will and I'll give it to you exactly right right you know what's going to break God on the scene of Revelation if you got the got the right Revelation ask what you will and it will be convenience because how can your conscience continue when your revelation's right right you know what your conscience gets all crazy about is when your faith gets all messed up and you well doesn't mean this well doesn't mean that and then the confusion comes in right yeah in a minute I'm gonna get on the first seal a little bit and explain to you what happened there a lot okay so like I say I'm gonna try to take you on a little journey here can I do that and we're going to go through but I want to get back to what the preachers said so he said well it was open in heaven right so let's show the slide when I showed what the seals are in three forms okay I've got a mess up here just a minute if you get it there uh let me see what he's got my notes Here I dropped it and got them all messed up so I put numbers on my pages I've dropped things and it's like really now what am I gonna do you know but yeah the first slide go go the first slide brother Joseph is he awake back there everybody yeah you know where he put him to sleep I want to give you a look faith is a complete confidence rather I said confidence is love right yeah you know if you have confidence in your wife you love her you don't conferences trust trust right you don't you don't like I said like if you love your wife you trust her right man right my wife takes care of my when I was at work and I didn't even know what I made all I told her was look I want to eat out lunch every day and I want my diet coke money yeah as long as I got that we were fine but if I ever go to the ATM machine I can't get that we're in deep trouble so she she did that I was okay right I had confidence here all right complete confidence in someone or something right what is Faith confidence in God what is it that's your love for you amen faith is your love if you have faith in God if you have confidence you love me right right without faith how can you love God you can't do it right right strong belief in God based on spiritual understanding is everybody who looked up understanding and knowledge same word right it's hardly a bit off remember the gifts remember the nine spiritual gifts faith knowledge wisdom yeah right right everybody that had Faith they said I know that's knowledge right right so what were they when they say it well I know I know this I know that script finally the apostles one day in the first sealed programs that they woke up and they realized they said we know that you know all things amen what do they have a face right they knew that he knew all things what made Jesus so Above the Rest he knew all things right he knew is that right exactly and then finally the apostles come to the understanding that he knew and they said we know that that you know all things right now that's a powerful statement right you see the power that he gave the Apostle when he said go out two by two the healings well they said okay it's going to happen why because they knew they had confidence in what he said right is that right that's what faith brings confidence amen it brings an I know it's not well I think so yeah like brother M said what's the sales room he said you ain't got far coming right you ain't what I think it's the faith that you have that's what brings the I know right so without faith we don't know we're just probing right that's what we have among the ministry a bunch of rumors they're just probing here probing they're trying to come up with an answer they don't know where they're at right exactly you'll never hit the target like that that's right it says based on spiritual understanding rather than proof right but you're right brother sometimes you have proof he could be both ways is that right sure and so the seals what you got to do if you're going to understand the seals you've got to understand and I I added I'm gonna be honest I added a form in their mystery form brother Brown I've got the quotes brother Adam talks about symbol form and reality form right right does everybody agree with that oh man now I'm going to tell you I put in mystery form yeah I want to try to bring some understanding with what he said can I do that right and remember the guy said it was open in heaven I said it was open on Earth right right and so I thought well there's there's got to be something here that I'm missing right right and since I'm back God showed me this he probably showed this to you a long time ago he's looking at me like you've done me I am I tell them at church here the other day I used to be in the I.T world we would go out and work on something we'd come back and they'd say what's wrong we'd say id10t and so we'd all laugh about it you know what I mean well that's the way I feel sometime like I'm an id10t right but God's going to get it to me he's wrong suffering toward me right toward us where it is that right he's going to get you the Revelation in the hour that you need it right so don't sit around and threaten or your friend or hate Revelation right don't fret and worry about it yeah brother rap said if you read something in the message and you don't understand it put it on a shelf right in other words don't throw it away you put it on a shelf and you say God you reveal that to me with an honest heart this man will come through in a day or two but maybe it's six months from now he'll preach and go Ah that's what it was what an id10t right yeah you know have you ever done that we do that as preachers I've read stuff many times and finally God gives you the Revelation what's he doing he's giving you the Revelation in the day that you need it right he's not going to give you one minute before that he's going to meet your grace is sufficient for all your needs I just want to meet your needs okay so brother random talked about a symbol form is that right something that represents something else a shadow or a type then I say mystery form and I put the word Thunders there does everybody understand the Thunders were the Mysteries that was contained under the seals is that what it was about it right so it's a religious truth not fully understood or eludes understanding right you can't figure it out with your own little right Canary burning right right you just can't figure it out right that was the mystery form the reality form of the state of being true a fact of certainly reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesn't go away right it's the truth whether you believe it or not it's the truth all right I don't care what you think about this it's the truth right you believe it or these guys out there not believing it it still is a reality I am right does everybody understand that how you try to explain it away they can do whatever they want with the seals but it will never go away right it's reality to me exactly sure what is the word real means truth you understand if something's the truth it's the truth it's the truth amen and like I say I'll stand there you're gonna have to move me off from right okay so let's go to the slide now brother Brian I'm uh where is it uh let's go to the fourth side yeah go to the fourth slide and then the fifth side number four Brother Joseph then when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal Throne to say what that seal was to be revealed but when it's placed before John it was a nice symbol right right look John was told John write what you see amen all right right is that what he said and the four living creatures what did they say come and see right they didn't say coming here did that the all four of those beasts said come and see all right man right so it's John wrote what he saw right so what John wrote was in symbol form of what the seals were right okay pull this place before John is a symbol when John saw you it was still a mystery why it wasn't even revealed right then right it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time exactly that's when the mystery is going to be made on in the end time is that right okay but it come in a symbol when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise with thunder is the voice of God Amen everybody that's what the Bible said see a clap of Thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it or it was revealed to him see it was a Thunderman okay and notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered actually now what about when it's open in its reality for it brother Bam's using reality as a mystery okay but the reason I'm gonna break it down even further I want to show you something okay so when it was open in mystery form right wouldn't it thunder again when the first seal and the Mystery of it so it wouldn't it thunder again right that's what brother branham's asking in the first seal right okay it thundered as soon as the M lamb struck back the seal right and what did it reveal not all of itself exactly yep right all right first it's with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things right is that right C it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed out all right amen right the Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out and it still was assembled that's what it is is that right with that white horse rider went out it was in symbol form right nobody nobody Larkin Uriah even brother Brigham in 1954 could not put the word Antichrist with the White Horse brother Adam said the White Horse that went out was the Holy Spirit right now did he plagiarize Uriah Smith then yes and Larkin yes in 54. 63 he did not plagiarize right so the fellow that's saying out on the internet needs to get saved he needs to get some things he needs to get to Hebrew for two because why it shows me he heard the message he has an intellectual conception of the message but somewhere your intellect will run out people if you're sitting here in this congregation with an intellectual conception of this message somewhere you will fall away you better ask God for a revelation right necessary man you need to pray for revelation that's what we failed to do in the message churches we come and we hear it we wrap our intellect around it but we don't get a spiritual Revelation from God Amen until it comes a spiritual Revelation from God they can a preacher can preach it away from you right exactly sure right right somebody will take your intellect away right but if you get a revelation of something it's a rock it's established it's a foundation amen and you can put your soul on that amen and amen damn it I'm not mad by the way sometimes it looks like I'm preaching mad but I'm really not yeah okay let's go to the fifth slide now I'm watching he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church Samurai exactly right do you understand that church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know right see no they don't know they don't have a knowledge of it I know all right amen you can say I know that you can say hopefully most of you in here can say I know by a revelation not by intellect by a revelation that God has given you right amen God ever gives you that Revelation I'll tell you it will not depart from you right have you ever got a revelation I don't know I don't know people still have sent the message for 40 years and still smoking yeah yeah I'm gonna be honest with you if you've got a revelation smoke is wrong you'll quit right the reason you continue to smoke because you don't have a revelation exactly the reason you continue to paint your face you don't have a Runway the reason you continue drink a little here tell a little dirty joke here you don't have a revelation if you've got a revelation you're going to stop the nonsense right you're going to get in the end of the Jubilee statement you've got a revelation because you know that that shout was the absolute it was thus saith the Lord and you're going to get your conduct right right amen amen thought simply put there's a lot of people sitting in a message churches don't have a revelation right that's why brother Adam said you need to pray for him more than anything exactly what do you think he said that for just to throw words out there no it's the truth they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it only is to be revealed at the last day with this actual seal is broken right broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it right amen see what I mean you people I'm going to call you Brian do you know what the opening of the Thunder the Thunders or what is what church do a prize what is it that's going to take you from a church to a bride Revelation exactly does everybody understand that man he's what he's saying here I'm not going to call you church anymore right that's right and now what am I am I can I mix this with a little faith amen I mean people get up and read it all the time and they don't give a faith of it don't give people any faith at all it's just a quote Yeah I want to give you more to quote I'm going to give you the revelation of what the quote is amen can I read between the lines of Brother Brad said I could why because I love him I have confidence in him I have confidence in this message I don't believe there I'll be honest with you if Moses was told to Smite the rock or to speak to the rocket he smote it do you think God's gonna let Moses that if if a prophet went to the mailbox that meant something right God had to stand behind Moses does everybody understand that all right brother Rand said right Brethren said that when he smoked a rock God that's why Jesus had to be crucified the second time exactly on the conference room tables right now I'm gonna say something here okay okay yes have you ever thought of this I'm gonna I'm gonna put it out here okay I'm gonna say I know I believe I really do if I'm wrong you tell me do you realize Daniel 69th week ended When They Crucified him right now that's right right at the end of the 69th week you know Jesus was crucified it was over he quit dealing with Israel as a nation right right you agree with that right what happens when the Hat came up on a conference room table did he quit dealing with him as a church the church ages I say he did absolutely yeah you see what I'm saying what did Brandon start preaching after that the bride age right why they hacked him up God don't deal with the churches anymore exactly he deals with the bride right when they were crucified When They Crucified him back there God did not deal with Israel as a nation right but there were individuals yeah sure that he saved all the way through the churches no that's not my fault you go read it that's his quote right so when we say it God don't deal with Israel as a nation as a nation that's true but did he deal with the individuals out of there Brethren said all through the church ages there's people that come to Christ and come to the testimony out of it sure right he said I didn't right the 12 apostles were they were they bright sure why because they God didn't deal with him as a nation all right he dealt with them once they crucified him he quit dealing with him as a nation right once once Jesus was caught up on her conference room tables he quit dealing with them as a church right absolutely right right so you can tell all the people in Georgia you come to the church at Eula big deal yeah don't mean a thing yeah right but if you tell him you're bride amen there's the difference man amen right right because what the bride says is God has dealt with you as an individual right God don't deal with the Lula trust right that's right God damn it individuals amen he quit dealing with the church ages he was locked outside the door tried to not to come in amen what God deals with is individuals set in this church that's why I'm telling you you gotta have a personal revelation you have to sit there and say I know you're gonna have to be just like the woman at the well you're gonna have to be just like job you're gonna have to be like that Roman Centurion right no such great faith that I've seen in all of Israel why because he knew he had a revelation right that's what this bride has to come to is the Revelation is the mystery that's contained under the seal right and those Mysteries there's what's going to give you rapture and if you're not going to take a Rapture without saying I know the Mysteries that was contained under the seal you're not gonna probe at it you're not gonna guess you're gonna have thus saith the Lord Glory that's right does everybody understand amen okay you turned that off didn't you I guess I went to Yaki yak okay it's back okay where did I end I'm going to call you bribe that you'll understand it right he's bringing the knowledge to you right everybody understand it he's bringing I know I know to the bride right all that look all the lucians are being taken away now right amen we're gonna know brother right the justification as if I never done it I can't preach that did you know that can you preach that as if I never done it yeah I can't that's part word yeah that one with that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away all right do you agree with that amen Luther preached as if I never died right now we found out under the seals we never did it right under the first seal brother Rand said I never did it right I can't preach to you as if I never done it right I'm going to preach to you you never did it little guy you never ever did it do you understand exactly so quit fret and quit worrying take the worry and the doubt out of this thing and start saying I know I'm proud I know I am the Rapture I know I got the right I know I got the right you ought to start you should start saying I know people worry the fear the doubt ought to come out voice is a thunder amen The Voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as intersections right amen right man hey I'm going to be honest with you he came in the first church age see people are putting that way back here they're missing it yeah right after coming's all wrong right right isn't that what describes the Pharisees had by their Revelation they thought he was going to come on a white horse right in Kick Caesar out and they were going to take over at it yeah you know what the prime minister's in the message they got the Cummings wrong yeah exactly he already come but he came in 1963 amen now I'm gonna I know that sounds boy that goes huh but I know what I'm talking about you understand right okay I'm not bragging I know you do too or I couldn't preach this just anywhere folks right if if I thought you hadn't heard this you think I'd throw that out there I'd cause yeah I know he's been preaching the Book of Revelations for the last how long since the first before the first of the year so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to tell you my approach to things amen which is not any revelation's the same right I mean continuity is the same he's going to say what's set on tape he's going to bring the lines what God did his same thing right and if you add it up you sum it up it ought to all be the same exactly is that right and I believe that for my heart I did yes sir okay he just left there's now he's standing here to take his possession as claims but the father came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out here yeah right the now he's preaching the first seals when he's saying this right he ain't saying this in the 70s does everybody get what I'm saying everybody raise your hand up he's talking about the first seal brother Madam is placing it perfectly right right brother Brandon's putting everything in order right and I tell you it's not chaos it's orange that's right that other brand is putting this thing perfectly in order for it okay stay down hear the thunder where the phone had left the father's Throne to go to taking his own throat where is his throne all right in your heart that's what he did on the day of Pentecost right exactly we put it way down here it's there now do I believe there's a guy yeah I believe it was bound through the church Angels absolutely yeah I believe he had to come again all right okay I believe it's the secret the mystery coming can I say it that way and you're okay with that that's not a secret coming right on the day of Pentecost there were three thousand standing there right right yeah but wonder and right right that wasn't a mystery was that all right but down here it's a mystery coming right right in this hour right okay all right we'll get there here in a minute the Thunder where the lamb had left the father's Throne to go take his own through no glory now now don't miss it friends we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ said on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on Earth right remember everybody remember Matthew 6. thy kingdom come you know where brother Brandon preached at Souls that are imprisoned now do you know what souls in prison now is third bull yeah right you know what the third pool is Matthew 6 that little bitty verses right thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth right as it is a third pool was Matthew 6. so you go look and see if brother you know that right amen that is the third pool Matthew 6 that little bitty verse that we all say as kids growing up it's talking about the third pull all right but we didn't come to the understanding or the mystery of knowing that until this time I'm sure happy I understand I like Matthew 60. I enjoy quoting it when I was a kid now I have a revelation I have the mystery of who I've been quoting I ain't just quoting quotes right yeah do this sister thank you for me be with me now she is I'm giving her a hard time right we're not just floating clothes right we're talking about the mystery the revelation of that quote that that Passage scripture was the third call right amen okay Glory now now don't miss it friends we all know as Christians we all know right is that what it says all right so if I say I know there's a bug in anybody okay exactly what it was saying amen we all know as Christians that God swear to David that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on Earth he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist right now the first seal is the Antichrist does everybody understand that did we know it before Brethren preached the first seal show me any passage of scripture that are Christ with the White Horse you can't do it no we understand that when John went up he wrote what he saw right and when that Beast said come and see he wrote a white horse right has anybody ever and I know you have that's I shouldn't say it but I'm gonna say have you read lately first John second John third John the Little John's that's the only place Antichrist has met you right right you know that was written after he wrote the Book of Revelation amen sure now I'm going to tell you something he John was told don't you write what the Thunder's under right is that what he said so in the Book of Revelation he never put Antichrist with that white horse rider he never nobody could connect the dots does anybody got what I'm saying all right look when John come back and preach the Little John's he said Antichrist four times that's the only place go look in your Bible put the word Antichrist the only time you'll find is one two and three right so he had a revelation when he went over there he seed the White Horse was what yeah that of Christ so he wrote it a little John but he never connected it to the White Horse Smith couldn't connect the dog right you're right Smith couldn't connect the dot brother Branham couldn't connect the dots right why the seal the mystery of those symbols had to be open in this hour right for us to say I know right right I'm not guessing what the seals are right man I know I know the symbol for him I know the reality form I know the mystery form amen and I'm not being I know people who are here and said on the internet like this is a know-it-all but you ought to look if I just proceeds to use scripture after scripture says they already said I know right I know I know I know shouldn't we be able to say in this hour shouldn't our Revelation be so fixed right that we can say I'm right amen amen and you know when you say that in a room full of creatures they get upset right you go say I know what Daniel's 70 weeks is they go who do you think you are yeah if I was to say a little Canary brain like me I said I know what they are right right what do they do they won't preach you right they're afraid you'll come and preach that now they're trying all right they won't preach you anymore because they're afraid of you right you know what I believe this if you've got something that I don't know you come and preach it I believe I Faithfully taught my congregation if I don't have any more confidence in what I'm teaching and to think somebody can bring a false Doctrine into this and fool the whole bunch and pull them away I ain't much of a teacher in Ephesians 4 it says the pastor is supposed and pastor and teacher and don't separate them with a comment right you know people say I've heard him say oh this guy's a teacher so what a pastor's supposed to an Elder's supposed to be able to teach right if you're an elder in this church you're supposed to be able to teach the word right so if a pastor teaches they get they say well I doubt it's calling no no man you need to go read Ephesians 40. you do not have a revelation right that's why we get all these stupid can I say it right I told them in church you know there's a difference stupid stupid is you're stupid you'll never get it and I'm looking at you I'm not picking on you okay in our church I always pick on somebody that service you know what it does it keeps them awake right the one that I see sleepy I get right in front of them and I'll preach the whole sir you're not going to sleep on me that you're not sleeping he's not sleeping by the way it's afternoon you may I may stand in front of a lot of you but you know stupid is you just you're stupid yeah ignorance is you ignore it ignore it right you hear it you're sitting in this church right now and you hear it and you ignore it right you better wake up Mr Mrs church member you better wake up right time is short you better get going with this message amen we have clowned around a long time is that right do you know that brother Branham the angel lord said you got to quit joking so much they told our Prophet that do you know you know what we've done in the clown around performing before and it's time to quit clowning right exactly you better quit clowning around you better start getting serious about it does everybody understand what I'm saying it's time where you get serious and when you look people face and say I know yeah right I know Daniel's 70 weeks I know the godhead amen I have no serpency right I know the Rapture you ought to where we're at now we can talk by this man you ought to be able to say I know yeah right I want to give my church to where they'll say I know right where some preacher comes in he preached something off something will go up in them exactly I know that man wasn't right I know it didn't sound right he was a trumpet with an uncertain sound right and I knew that wasn't right that's what I wanted so I don't want to fear of somebody coming into my church or preaching something and deceiving my people I don't think you can right right exactly do you think somebody come in here and fool this bunch of what you've been teaching them I don't worry about a neighbor all right right somebody come through and say well I got a message for the church and say well okay you felt later Lord you put him up there right right you need to go put him on a stand and give him the third degree and you believe you believe this you believe that you believe it no you put him in a Pulpit right if they goof up these people are all Gonna Know It Right amen reliable to talk to the guy before he gets up that's cool I told people I said if you preach it you I said If You Preach something I said if you say what set on tape my people will amen right but if you say something they haven't heard you defend it I ain't defending you that ain't my place you preach that you'd offended right and you know what if he says it wrong he'll leave and next hers I'll get up and tell him well he that overcomes Antichrist and all the things of the world right all the things right of the world she'll sit with me on my Throne as I have overcome and have set down my father's Throne see right amen so this is now let me get I'm not even got where I want to go yet how long do I get to preach tell me what what's that huh 15 minutes I mean you're tough so let me get back to what the preachers we were talking about he said well I was over in heaven I said no it's on one Earth I just read the quote we were both right yeah sure absolutely look it was opened in heaven when he said come and see right it was open what was it his opening symbol for us right that's exactly does everybody agree with that man what's open and simple but it is open on Earth in mystery form right and that didn't come till this hour right does everybody understand that so look did he start doing performing the player redemption in the first church age you believe he did I do I think Paul was redeemed sure I believe there was bright out of the first thing it's the second Church age the third church I believe he come down man with an open book now that's going to blow your mind down man you mean he believes he came down very Pentecostal yep I do now I got your attention now did yeah okay I got your attention now let's go to another slide I'm gonna bring something right here and start it in I don't have it he didn't put it on here okay everybody understand the story about handle meal under Jeremiah right well let me rehearse it you Jeremiah 32 yeah you agree with that right you understand Jeremiah bought his uncle's property right and it was showing him how Redemption Works does everybody agree with that right right so what did what did he do he put He bought his uncle's land it was witness right right yep it was witness he was actually Jeremiah was in prison did you know that's what he was yes he was in prison but they witnessed it and you know what he had two Scrolls made and putting one Earthen vessel yeah is everybody a president said that vessel type Christ right right exactly does everybody understand that all right man one of the Scrolls was open the other one was sealed it's showing you Redemption right right when in a day of Pentecost and I'm going to show you a quote here in a minute on the you know remember I said if the first seal had thundered when it opened its symbol for wouldn't it thunder when it only mystery formed does everybody agree with that quote right and brother Brown said the Thunders weren't even written in the Bible right does everybody agree with that I do right the mystery of it wasn't written in the Bible the simple form was right you the mystery of the white horse rider is Antichrist there's nowhere where you can put Antichrist with the white horse rider until this hour right does everybody understand exactly now look at Jeremiah look at what happened to him he bought his uncle's land he did the work of redemption do you agree right and he put in that Earthen vessel and open scroll and a closed scroll exactly is that right brother now brother may have talked about this in a breach I believe it was wasn't it so we had an open one the closed one right right that's the plan of redemption so the open one was the symbol form does everybody understand that's the type of the Old Testament the closed one was the mystery form right now Jeremiah went into bondage did you know that he hit him in Christ right then he went into bondage does everybody understand 70 years of bondage in Babylon right remember I said he was bound by the dogmas the decrees what did they do they bound the Holy Ghost is that right amen so what did he do they bound him out of the church ages do you agree with that they had part word yeah but they bound him to where the where the Holy Ghost couldn't have preeminence in the church does everybody agree with what I'm saying that's right man so what happened is same thing Jeremiah is showing the type to set forth into church ages right with the seals so it was open and simple form they could read it right but he went into captivity so during the church age where what dogmas and Creeds took over they left the original word they accepted the bridler remember I said Christ right fell by accepting what the dogless and the Creed what did they get away from the original word right right that's why brother Graham had to take us back to the original faith of the party because they left the original word right right right so it was open in simple form but when he came back from captivity when Jeremiah came back he was able to open the second one to say look in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let these things be established everybody got what I'm saying it's in there right it's in there right so what has happened in this hour he has came again right the mighty Angel has come out has descended has come down to earth and he's open ended up he was bound the only ghost what he found right he was bound he got Bound in what the thought of her age or whatever it was at 320 he got bound because why they took Dominus right instead of The Originals does everybody agree with that right so what happens is the it thundered on the first one when it was open and simple for him right does everybody agree with that amen now I'm going to tell you when that happened can I do that yeah let's go let's go to the slide I want him to see that and I know he's got that one let's go to the uh six slide if you would for the Joseph six sign I'd always thought this you know if you look at the church agents remember Paul started in 53 and everybody's show and we gotta we got a church age that somebody has and it's a good job I use it all the time this shows while the white horse riders started in 53. does everybody believe the white horse rider started in 53 oh yeah I know let me show you where it's all right look at listen to what Brendan Brandon said okay I'm asking you a question it blasted with thunder when this voice run out did you notice that with the Seven Seals that follow the seven Church ages when the first seal was open right that there was a thunder sure so let me ask you 53 if there was a thunder where are you going to put it right place that Thunder you go have a hard time right the first seal in the book was opened there was a thunder with not the first seal on the outside of the book he's talking about the Mysteries open the same way congregation says amen God doesn't change his program let's turn over to revelation 6. and I saw I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard as it was the noise of a thunder right and one of the four beats said come and see so that Thunder it was open in symbol for him do you agree right now next slide now this is the one that I caught and I thought I like to have me a Running Fit now there was never was another Thunder and the last seal was over there was space in heaven for a half of power silence but the first seal was opened there was a blast of Thunder here oh Church could it be are we that far friends think maybe I hope it isn't but what if it is what was that blast and before God and this Open Bible Alana blast the shook the whole world that was sunset Mountain right amen I know where that went into I know where the Thunder was under those Mysteries right would have sealed the mystery part of it was open I can establish that by that quote right does everybody agree with that amen and when the first seal of the seven that was opened in the Bible it come forth just one but a blast that shook the whole thing of thunder and then at the seals that's on the back side would open wouldn't Thunder too I don't know I can't there was a thunder the first seal and the seal was Thunder the trumpet was open at that time and the trumpet was blown out that's when the thunder thunder into the first seal it was Pentecost folks is that where the church started out on a day of Pentecost brother Bradley will take us back to 53. brother man's taking us back to Pinnacles does everybody understand the first Thunder 6-1 thundered at Pentecost what happened on the day of the Pentecost the Holy Ghost come down amen the Christ the Baptist does everybody agree with that amen the Christ came what came on the same day the Antichrist sure the White Horse what was it every seal Twins were born right it was a church symbol does everybody agree I read it to you right on the day of Pentecost the Christ went out and the Antichrist right now right the Antichrist started riding on the day of Pentecost all right it thundered what was the Thunder the upper room yeah let's go to Acts 2 1. and you follow the way brother Brown says what happened in Acts okay I'm not guessing about what I say but everyone said it you see that's what he said a trumpet a thunder and it was blowing Pentecost of course I won't get into that he said but brother Brandon already established that that Thunder that happened in civil form was open on the day of Pentecost yeah right that's what he's putting it at but we and I've done the same thing I put it in 53 I'd put the white horse rider right under there no the white horse rider started on the day of Pentecost right right the Holy Ghost where did he start on the day of Pentecost every Revival there's twins born right everybody agree with that right right man this is the only quote well you got it thank you and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound all right what is the voice of God Amen and a sound come from heaven right did it thunder from the throne hey man see where it places it in the scripture we didn't know what it was brother random said it you understand amen so where did the Thunder where did the 6-1 Thunder take place on the day of Pentecost that's where it started folks on the day of Pentecost right so if God's going to take us back to the original right he's going to take us back to Pentecost he's going to stop using me up at 53 A.D Paul was already telling the Antichrist is working ammonia those people were putting their fat fingers on her nose saying you ain't saying well Paul said all right exactly right what what gave him the right to do that the Holy Ghost what gives you the right to say I know all right the Holy Ghost that's what Paul and them were saying in their day I know you're not preaching what Paul preached all right right right but boy you say that now to people that say what gives you the authority I know yeah the word the message the Revelation that he's given right that's the authority that I got right man that's right and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven yeah as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were saved right brother Brandon look at what he says when you go and I had other quotes I guys I got if you you couldn't stand it you would be here for days but brother Ram said it shook that Upper Room it shook it filled the house is that right the whole room where they were sitting shook what was that it was a thunder that went into that man it was the voice it was the sound that's what the Thunder is the voice of God all right so now by this quote that Brethren again we can in place where that Thunder actually physically happened does everybody agree right it's easier for me to show you where it happened in mystery form right because brother I'm saying it was on it shook on Sunset Mountain it shook the whole earth that's exactly what happened here all right man when it opened in simple form right right did it open in heaven in simple form yes before the four living creature said come and see amen so when I was talking to that preacher I thought there has to be a revelation in it right right you have to mix it with faith or you're gonna have to say brother man said here he said if they're one place he said it wrong yeah see there's the problem we have with the ministry they'll dig in they'll say no I'm right no I'm right they won't go get before God and say give me the Revelation I know I know I know brother bran was a prophet I know he couldn't contradict it right I know he couldn't bring confusion that's right because God's not the author of confusion is that right right so what was it when it thundered on a day of Pentagon it sounds from Heaven that was the first seal opening in symbol foreign it said that that seventh Church age messenger was on the earth at the time right of that who could open the Mysteries the only one that can open the mysteries of the one that gave it that's right brother Graham couldn't hold that no Prophet no Priest No team could open it no only Christ it could be and come down and open those seals he was he was bound through the church ages he could bring me part word under justification he could bring me part word under sanctification even the Baptist look this is what preachers are saying now God help us you know it's a mess isn't it preachers say okay there's no fourth stage now look I'm gonna be real I'm a simple person okay you got to get I'm a canary brain gotta get it simpler I don't get it in a natural birth there's a natural birth type to spiritual bread you got water blood and spirit you know what that water blood and spirit brings forth a little person yeah right right do you know what's happened in this hour we've had justification sanctification the baptism well you know what's wrong for a person exactly it's brought forth Christ you live it on my heart the person right amen I don't just have a dip in the Holy Ghost does everybody understand that I have the person I have the person of Jesus Christ Living in man it's Christ that lives in me right does everybody I don't have part word right I can't get away with part work God wants weight that my ignorance right but he commands every man to be made all of himself Body Spirit and soul we have to come to the fullness of the word in this hour damn it right you're not gonna get away with part words not as if you if you never did it that's the knowledge you have to contact and it's up to us preachers to preach the Mysteries the Mysteries I've never ever seen as so plain as this time going through this it's the important part it's the Mysteries right it's the Thunders that literally turn our hearts right back to the apostolic fathers amen amen does everybody agree with that that's what literally turns us back right so these preachers that are preaching they're not preaching the mystery the Thunders that were contained under the seal without it there's no rapturing thing right rapturing faith-wise in this message this message of Fame perfect faith brother random priest yeah it's another Masterpiece that's come forth in this island that's right amen is that right man right exactly I tell the church this is what gets me you know and what it is people just simply don't have a revelation yeah that's right the people riding the people perish not having a revelation does everybody agree with that that's what we're seeing going on in the message the people that are falling out the people that are going to go inside this one get over here they got no all right right they got no Hebrews 4-2 right they won't get out on their knees and do what a Minister's supposed to do and ask God for a revelation right say God my little Canary brain don't get it I can't connect the dots but the Holy Spirit right can give you a revelation that'll connect it right amen look the Garment we wear there ain't a loose thread on it you know my wife you know what I'll do I'll be at the house when I get a dress shirt I go oh look there's a loose thread and she knows me you know what a guy will do first thing we'll pull the whole thing will come on where the whole sleeve will fall off yeah she'll harm me don't don't you leave it alone before she does it I got it out to hear it how do you do that yeah look our garment don't have a loose thread all right you raced we're bad about an army Brothers if I see something loose on me I'll pull it off and it's like oh yeah you know all you men are laughing you agree with that we're just with a loose thread we pull it yeah look this garment we have there's no loose screens there's no loose Revelations oh man it's all mixed together that's why you gotta mix it if you don't mix this with Faith you have a loose thread and somebody's gonna come by and pull itself then you're gonna say well I don't help brother around him he must have been wrong that's what's happening to people the whole thing's coming unwell right if they had faith it would be United it would be mixed and they'd have a white garment look Jesus had a garment didn't even have any of them what do you call it seems right does anybody know how to do that I've asked my wife to sower could you sow me a road without saying how in the world did they do it for him didn't say it describe that's what he does for us we got a robe but it's got no sayings right amen I don't know how he does it but the Garment I has has no scene he has no loose has anybody ever stood the deal of an eagle that a little baby eagle before mama sends him out on a solo he goes down he pulls out he tries to pull his feathers out if you got a loose feather a loose Revelation yeah oh yeah mama's gonna have to catch her you're gonna smack there so what an eagle does before they take their flight they'll take their big they pull them they make sure they don't have any loose feathers right and I do not believe this bride has any loose right that's right feathers I do not believe she's got any strings that are not Blended together right amen I believe all the loose ends are tied together now by this message and if we have the faith that we're supposed to have shouldn't we be able to tie it together right but what we've got is a bunch of preachers that don't tie it together right it's you too if you fall away you've got it tied together right you don't have a revelation it's not just the preacher preachers right that's why it's very now then I'm really starting to see the depth of what brother Brown said we need to pray for Revelations more than our next meal but you know what we're worried about making a check does anybody understand there's still people in a message say oh I'm going to move to where my job is there a message or no you mean to tell me if jobs more important than this message right God has already said he'll feed you he'll Feed Us amen I mean but they're looking at cars at homes that worldly did I read it worldly things right right that's what the guys are like you know what the devil's pulled this people in this age in this hour and some of them all worried about is cars and homes and clothes he said clothes that defeat the sparrow exactly why can't we have a revelation why do we get so bogged down with the world and the things of the world let's let's fly right right it's time that we fly and where we say I know right that's flying right amen if you're guessing you're not flying now that fourth creature was a flying eagle it didn't say an eagle right it said a flying right there's a big difference there everybody I'm not gonna perch on this an eagle perch on the earth is not much of an eagle right right right we're flying heels damn it Laurie I got I don't have any loose feathers I got a revelation I can see these things God has given me a revelation that cleans up all of Lucy that's right so we understand it thundered on a day of Pentecost everybody agree with that yeah thundered on Sunset mountain right and the church ages between me and you God quit dealing with them one seven seven or six to three yeah when brother random preached the indictment yep now he deals with us as individuals he's done to us just what he did to Israel right I think that's marvelous amen but you know what he'll not lose a one right you didn't lose one Israelite and it's not going to lose one of us I think he's marvelous don't you I think it's just I wish I could find an English word to express my gratitude exactly Glory guys I can't find it he's going to have to give me a new language right he right he's gonna have to give me a new tongue right to where I can express my love for you right exactly I just there's no verbal that I can to say how much I appreciate what he's done for me but it'd be good guys don't you appreciated all right so when you got a question in your if there's a Bible question there's a Bible answer absolutely I wouldn't I didn't jump on that brother say no you're wrong dig my heels and you say no and we both we both were real I I thought it was marvelous and I come well we both right you see what I'm saying we're both right right but the important part of it was you got to mix what you're saying with faith right right if you don't then there's where the argument comes from that's why we have the argument among some preachers right and Brethren said God doesn't already why would we argue we got a fake we got a revelation with him they got to get it the same way I got it right you know in Revelation I'm gonna quit I'm winding down Revelation 10 do you know you take the book from the angel that had his feet on the land and sea that wasn't random program couldn't give me the open book right brother Brown couldn't give me a revelation does everybody understand that only Christ can give you this literation brother Brandon couldn't give it to you he took Christ The Mighty angel coming down amen opening the seals to be able to do it right and it stood right there in a handle story right right it's sitting right there before us and now God's revealed it too right right amen I don't know about you guys but I'm excited about it the more I preach it the more excited I get right that's right and one thing I want to say about Revelation I'm gonna let you have it Revelation see this is what people think I read the quote where brother and said it's the Mysteries that how you're going to take the Rapture Mysteries plural this is what people do people preachers in a message they come up with Perugia you can't find perusia in the message you can't even find it in the Bible right did you know that right so what did they do they come up with a revelation because brother Brown said the Rapture is a revelation that's their what they say brother REM said it's the Mysteries yeah that's how you're going to take Mysteries plural yeah now Perugia is not one of the Mysteries does everybody understand that Dr prusa is it's God With Us the presence of God right hey that's sanctification all right you I believe in sanctification sure absolutely but you know what I believe it's on the inside yeah you know it's like people say on that deal God is my co-pilot he better be your pilot yeah that's right I've seen some of your driving and he better be your pilot forget the co-pilot stuff right that's what these people are saying they're saying perusual well this is Arrow so everybody's looking for a silver bullet to take a Rapture somebody understand that they don't have a revelation the Revelation is you've got to open the you've got to eat the open books all the Mysteries it's going to take every one of those Mysteries contained in the seals for you to take a Rapture amen so they bring what do they do they come out with the seven Thunders where it's seven one's in New York one's in Florida one's in Phoenix right man and I tell people if you're gonna put it on seven men you better put it on seven Messengers right yeah that's right right yeah if you put it there I might I might go some way with you yeah but you put it on seven man that's brother I said Thunders were the Mysteries contained on the seals right but what they do is they say well we got a mystery Sammy no you got to go to the mighty angel man all right come on let's let's get some faith in this message and realize that come on brother and they'll come out with that two Lords yeah where does brother Ram say that in a message yeah last time I raised one Lord One Faith one will say two Lords Two-Face two baptisms I don't see two in there no I see one amen Faith's final resting place is in the word glory and your Prophet took us back to the word right amen because that's what the people in the church ages left right right they put the Holy Ghost outside the church he was bound by their dominance the only way he could come back was for the dogs and the Creed's deceased and to take us back to the original word Glory I like original amen the only original color is is white yeah right right amen we have white that's what we have is that right bless you you're good amen see I can preach these things because you've been taught it's easy to teach somebody it's been taught that's right when you come in you got a plow there's nothing
