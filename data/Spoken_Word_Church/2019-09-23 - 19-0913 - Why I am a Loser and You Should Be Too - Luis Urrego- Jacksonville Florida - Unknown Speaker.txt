you know it just Crystal Coast and you're me yeah most of those como West's here was for what six your sequences for God our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ por que Dios commando de las tierras Chris plant responds yes a la música this hero and Westeros correspondence but if you mean a see only their promise me enter the doctor only Gloria

know that we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair estamos aqui willows and Tomas no Angus tears and our pillows must know this is perilous huge but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed but the evils man notice at this table I was Debbie Radha's paternalistic I'm always bearing about in the body of the Lord Jesus in our a men and you would just

know without something receiving something from God amen so we're just gonna speak a little simple thought tonight with us other than this commando simply why I am a loser and why you should lead to people get to the mid 80s in a minute so here is speaking about some vessels we have this treasure this treasure in earthen vessel he said Pendleton it was destitute Solo in Russells over what's right get this one amen because we see that out of darkness God said let there be light Costello's there was life I've yet you realize that when that light in that verse cuenta que sera sera sequel that's not the Sun it was I'm sorry that's not the moon but no no that is God's like that is the life of God lovey-doveys amen because later on in the scripture in Genesis 1 what could his question in Genesis chapter 1 and 2 we see that that God creates mascara spiciest curry Creoles yesterday's so that light at the beginning all right so now you can talk about the Sun although the bride types the moon for the moon on the moon is a that same life do you [Music] is in your life yeah [Music] Holy Spirit inside of you this treasure in earthen vessels [Music] beautiful China in common earthen vessels those vessels that you might buy at Walmart [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it's you that's why you should praise the Lord Jesus so if we continue reading here now now watch what he says here in the same verse 7 I mean okay secret look at the reason why he put this light in those vessels reading and this Ghostbusters that the excellency of the power may be of God [Music] you have nothing to do you are not looking for that's the only that's the only but you have to come to him he's not going to force you to serve Him and then to choose him but it's to choose life but as to choose light to let us go ahead or to choose darkness so we see today you know we see the movie looking like he's alive si como si Stewie but now really if you think about it better today you and me should be actually the truth we should be dead to the world mundo and constantly [Music] I said to me after we are the truth [Music] those things out there tonight I believe they're here in this room tonight en esta noche there are walking with the life of God because when God told Moses to make the tabernacle he told him to make [Music] [Music] [Music] so when the children of Israel we're walking around in the wilderness and they were tearing the tabernacle around the b-pawn would see them you know meet up and look at their church amidala see you as you and say mommy is yeah thanks the people of God okay that's their church as I seen this you not knowing you know so you know thank God that was because he doesn't go around he doesn't go around with [Applause] [Music] whatever is inside of you mr. caruso we see we see that that the tabernacle of Moses and the saloon was Kenneth other than that it was his you see there was that outer court of the other entrance all right and then you have to enter in order for you to be able to start we're always around stone infidelity you have today but when the children of Israel were in the outer court that was equal and that didn't mean that they were in the holy place it was the same it was said okay there's a need to clean myself I need to I believe is so many people for example when they receive the message of the you came for the amen they receive the message but I see you only miss liking but the message is not in that but leaves and so they're they're inside the holy place it's an ended up subtle and they're eating [Music] you know but it was when the priest [Music] already have gone through these other steps he was back there he was there was a part of the original man [Music] [Music] get back in there the children of Israel it was going to spoil it was in there to show the priests and let you know while he was in their presence what when establish a procession he's the same yesterday today that's why the man did it change that's why the tablets did it change but you know what else before it went inside the holiness of the Holy of Holies fantastic intro Alouettes on teaching it was a stick there Eric would carry in a bar okay well he would walk under Tommy now traveling and it was it was dead it was dry East our coast our stable but God Como's is to put that rod inside there think about this ominous windows priest while the priest was in there and he would see that rod yeah yes I have leaves on Danielle huh sir yeah and even had all this growing that rod asada was not attached to any tree [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's why that's why he wants to make you live steady and not just live in the holy place you know you've either got something but he wants you to live in the Holy of Holies where the true [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ghetto get a little money I want to give up watching pornography I'm gonna give up looking at women you sisters I'm gonna stop I want to stop dressing the way I dress and neither differently smile or anybody eat it's done [Music] [Music] [Music] it will be done it won't mean that you may not have temptations no that's much greater [Music] [Applause] so if you want to turn with me to first Corinthians chapter 1 let's just read verse 18 now that we know asylum was that God wants to dwell in your skin a study in weak earthen vessels like you and Russell 7 that is Como Stadium this is part up this is the reason why first verse 18 all says for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God in social policy porque la palabra de la Cruz is no coup de ellos que severe Parivar was cast aside one as to his absolute unity state but if you cannot have in reality a new token of you are those entities preaching to save them that believe that you already read that part so you see God by preaching and Paul calls it the foolishness of preaching easy sometimes it's crazy to watch a man standing behind this pulpit I mean I don't normally that would be sweating all over the place while you're there and you received their showers of blessings what time that is I was interpreting for brother jewel for knee just a leopard on the father a mother a Jewish holy how many know who brother Drew for nee Pusan Canada the motherland what he's he's an evangelist from North Carolina he's very she guess we know you know me cold and so I was I was interpreting for him I was I was standing on his left side and always kill him brother Joe said something and so he looked at he looked at me and he turned his head like this yummy he did his sweat even though but but that is what God chose his work by the kid and be a father to his people assume a man for the people of God it's something glorious because if it's of God verse 25 slinky Cinco population because the foolishness of God is wiser than drug cartels from Mexico I lived through drugs back in the 80s in Colombia Joey be paralyzed and you must call us believers should not be worried about those things because quality this party is not changed this body still needs to be redeemed a staple of Dietetics every means my inner man is redeemed me oh my my soul [Applause] [Music] so all right so Paul could say your first 27 C is equal to the wise Tino Tino Tino narrowly mundo para la vida mundo is to confound the things which are mighty [Music] this this power that you have in you and instead found that power amen and base things of the world verse 28 and base things of the world and things which are despised but she put these you know you know you that one doing you know memos but as yellow have God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are let's go here with us you know can know it but okay watch verse 29 in there she couldn t know that no flesh should glory in his presence I think they can not either say say that is super sensitive God doesn't want you to glory with your own flesh with what you can do to say say say Modi of Singapore know who stick what that's it God doesn't want you to glory if God [Music] [Music] very self-centered what do you think they call it you know back then when they have my space my space yeah I'll just continue in my space get a case me espacio it's my space I told us to use because it's me and this device okay we don't use them getting robbed in Berlin because your husband you serve your children on Facebook [Applause] you know [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so this is in Christ Jesus who glory in the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and capitalist verse 24 there see what he says equal to the sea cruise if any man will come after me look at him and pause the me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me he don't miss a goose you see that or whosoever will save his life shall lose it por que todo in que quieres I gotta sweeten up their data now watch and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it don't worry kid yeah that's will be the poor cow said I mean yeah so that's the reason why I want to be a loser in this Jesus was not talking about losing or you know hurting yourself or killing yourself or anything like that it's just all done till they've been in the bundle stick no but he was talking about sacrificing yourself that if you can sacrifice your own self she's tasted let's at least be active in Tennessee me small to let him work at you but I can't our Houston amen then that means you're losing your identity your life and those acoustic stuff for dinner su vida and you're taking his identity's system honest with ya a man with his identity : then all things are possible that's the reason why the Potter when he was on the potter's wheel said one day I decided upon a star whether they now believe is in Jeremiah get okay that headache yes and God told your mind to go to the potter's house yesterday and to and to see this part making this this jar of clay he gave me that stuff I don't know instead of all day now st. in the Potters hand he has to plea control over again a control so is that that clay is said by a man and you cannot say to God you stay on the face you know why did you make me like this what can we see this why did you give me this nose forgive me sister nutty's why did you give me these feet suspicious why did you give me this head okay what you can't do that no way is that the world out here is trying to do that and that's why there's there's man and boys that want to be girls but can I what is why this guy what is it it's the best way to deal with [Music] what he takes he takes that that clay so I said well and you takes water it allows and soaks it with water you know Jennifer Bella and in order for you to be able to receive and to be made something from God you better you stay but uh but if you say oh I see why you said I will you have to be willing to receive the water of life they didn't get everything now what you have to be soaked with the water of life then you can send more Holloway so then that way that you can be pliable but again so I'm gonna put in and so when you come to that point but you gotta say then he soaks you with water you know and now we can start work yeah and you might be thinking but it's a beautiful thanks you okay mr. stone and I know that I'm going to be filled with some water you usually carry I said you know [Music] exactly the way we have to take you down yes to completely tear you down but that does not mean that he's done with you know because that clay because it's still in his hand so obvious with mother he tore it down but it's still Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you know until he knows for sure as I can say thank you yes oui madame is being reflected está siendo in your life Thanks you know we could go through the list and we're almost done here but most important is a little Kawasaki we look at the perfect heroes of God most of those analysts imperfecta labels young people today those holiness and it's 10:02 they like spider-man demersal spider-man Captain America Captain America Superman you know they like all these are these superheroes in doses of some bananas man but sadly there are superheroes walking around in this hour you know to be able to make and have faith in the Word of God for something that has never existed he you know we might see him as a hero Iike me right but yeah he was laughs thank God he was a deceiver Moses he murdered an Egyptian one says any money a man Ray had was a prostitute these are all people that we think are heroes he was fearful Samson had serious problems with with women and angered some something approval emissary was kanu Harris because he's a hero a man David he wasn't a doctor and murder and even the media military Oh II Peter James and John James and John wanted special seats in the kingdom and all the apostles one time are you who's gonna be the great but you see they're there they're great people [Music] [Music] [Music] the master said I think I can study for your new Christine so the first day Antonia the boy went to take
