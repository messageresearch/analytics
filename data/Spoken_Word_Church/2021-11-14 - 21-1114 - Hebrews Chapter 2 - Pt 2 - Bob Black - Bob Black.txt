========================================

god bless you all it's good to be in the house of the lord let's turn over to hebrews chapter two where we've been going through and and just uh let's just get started by just reading through again i i think the bible was um it's almost meant to be read aloud and it's like to it's good to we used to get you know the kids together growing up and when they were growing up and and just just read through scriptures and it's just good to hear you kind of roll off a tongue hebrews chapter 2 says therefore we ought to give the more earnest to you to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip forth the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visiteth him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crowns him with glory and honor and descent him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet friend that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captains of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which because he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death for all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted so let's start on verse 3 of that of that chapter there's so many so many good things packed in here and we would uh we stopped on verse three the last uh around around verse three so we'll just backtrack just a little bit um how shall we escape if we neglect we've got such a great salvation that's been given to us that christ came and died for us on the cross and all these things that we read about that paul is trying to express here how should we escape if we neglect this which at first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him in other words all those things jesus jesus preached for three and a half years and and preached a message sowed the seed and people heard him and then the things that they heard were later confirmed i was there when he walked on the water i was peter could say i was there when i saw him raise the dead i was there and you know we could say many of us sitting here today have that same testimony that we were there when we saw the life of christ made manifest and a little man a prophet that preached we were there when we were in meetings and saw people healed and and and things done and we were we were there when the life of christ actually changed our lives we were there we we're a witness how should we escape if we neglect this great salvation that so many even sitting here today are a witness of how should we escape and brother and god has provided a way he told us what the way of escape is then uh and we know that jesus said i am the way the truth and the life i am the way the if you if you abide in me if you can get in christ then you you have he is our way of escape and so he gave us the holy ghost to to change our lives to to change our thinking to to give us the ability to believe and so brother ramsay in and got us a provided way he said he sent back the holy ghost tonight which is god's provided way of your escape and so in the next verse verse 4 god also bearing them witness he's bearing bearing witness through the life of christ living out in the believers that is a witness that the life of christ is on display and as we keep reading it both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will brother ram said god always bears witness and now what i'm what i'm doing basically is reading through hebrews chapter two the sermon brother brown preached so if you if you're interested you can go back and read a listen to that same sermon because brother brown says god always bears witness and how does he bear witness by that life the same life that was in christ living out in the believers living out in his church today he said your life will always will bear witness he said i don't care i don't know what your testimony is but your life speaks so loud your voice can't be heard but you're living your everyday life will testify what you are god bears witness yes the holy spirit is a seal and a seal takes both sides of the paper you're sealed on both sides inside and outside and so those those are the two how do i know that something's happening you know something's happened on the inside that nobody can see something's happening on the outside that everybody can see that's visibly displayed the life is displayed you know those those two things were they even carry on the revelation when john took the book and he ate it he began to he began to eat it and begin to understand the word but then it was bitter in his belly in other words it's got to be lived out you got to live it and and if you if you'll truly believe the word and the way that it was intended was brother ram expressed so many times and the greatest battle ever fought and so many messages if you believe it in the way that it was intended it was it will express itself on the outside the born again believer's life is just is it's the natural types of spiritual you can go out and look at an oak tree and you can tell it's an oak tree by the life that is expressed in that you can look at the bark and you know the bark like the doctrine you can look at the leaves the the fellowship you can look at all the things that is expressed in the life of an oak tree and you can say that's an oak tree you look at the life of a christian you can say that's a that's a real believer somebody that know that understands the word of god and that it's expressed on in their life because the life that the life of of christ is actually changing that person to make them stop cussing and stop stop all the things that they're that they used to do and changes you to a new creature so we're talking about the life paul is and so if you go to the next slide god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will now now brother brown when he was explaining this in hebrews chapter 2 when he preached that sermon he used the example of acts chapter 3 verse 4 when when peter and john were there at the gate beautiful and they came upon that man that was crippled and they said they fast he and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us why why would he say that now now they had just gone to pentecost and they had just been filled with the life of christ and now they've got that same life that was in jesus christ now god is bearing witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost in other words now that same life is living in them the same life is on them so peter peter's telling them not look on us because because we are witnesses that christ is alive look on us i got something to give to you what could they give they could give a word of encouragement they could give in part to them something that would spark that brother's faith so that he would know that christ was still alive that's why brother brown said he said brother when the world knows that you've been with jesus in other words the life is on display when you can live such an adulterated unadulterated life in this present world and in this darkness now he's elaborating on acts chapter 3 verse 4 peter and john talking to this brother next to the gate beautiful look on us that brother all of a sudden standing there crippled in his condition at the gate beautiful knew that those two men had been with jesus they knew that he had been with that they had been with jesus he knew they had been with jesus when you can live such an unadulterated life in this present world in this darkness that the world knows and can see that you've been with jesus when a rugged old vulgar prostitute of the street can become a lady washed in the blood of the lamb god is bearing witness that he's lit that he lives that's what paul's talking about in hebrews chapter 2 verse 4 god also bearing them witness he said take a drunkard who was so low down that he would run around on his wife that he would mistreat his children and take the food from the table to spend on a prostitute let him get with jesus once you'll see him returning like legion who was in his right mind and clothed to his babies and to his wife and to his loved ones if we go to the next slide why because it is a new birth and a change of heart that changes a man brother brown said in the lamb and the dove in 1957 from a dying being to a resurrected immortal son of god taking his plate on place on the seat of the believer's heart it's a nature change a nature change the life of christ that's why jesus said i am the vine year the branches because when you get tapped into the the the the source of the life that same life is flowing through the life of the believer now if we go to the next slide let's see see where paul's line of thought is going he's talking about that that that life is living in you and so he continues that in hebrews chapter 2 verse 5 for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak what's he talking about he's he's he's planning god's purpose is to put the world into your subjection the great angels that ministers in the heavens gabriel michael woodworm and the tens of thousands times tens of thousands of angels of heaven or the tens of hundreds of prophets that's been on the earth every one of them he's never put any of them to have control over the world to come that we speak of not a one he never said isaiah you'll control the world he never put the world in subjection to elijah neither did he put it to gabriel or any angel or any ministering spirit but one in a certain place david and on the next slide he said saying what is man that thou art mindful of him are the son of man that thou visites him now look how brother random expresses this who who are you anyhow we think that we're so great there's no keep keep the thought in your mind there's no value in your life there's so many i was reading the other night and a sermon brother brown priest she said look around on the world and there's so many people walking by getting on the subway getting in their cars doing things that are not going to be anything there's not going to be any value in their life they're just going to be cannon fodder and one day that life will come to an end but you that have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb that's been filled with the holy ghost that you've been you've become part of christ he said who are you anyhow we think we're so great in our seal but without the holy ghost we're nothing but he said blessed be the lord you've got a soul that's born again what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visites him you're nothing without christ but if you've got christ that changes everything you've got christ in your life he said you'll live forever and ever because he become you that you through his grace might become him and make a place for you oh we who think that we got a change of clothes and a few groceries in the house what are we god can take it in a second your very breath holds it in his hand and here it is it's christ that makes everything christ is the thing without christ none of us are nothing we wouldn't have nothing to preach we wouldn't have nothing to say what would we be doing here at church if it wasn't for christ christ is the thing so if you're not born again this this morning today that that is the thing that you should be seeking with all of your heart because christ is what gives you purpose jesus christ is what gives your life meaning without christ you're just going to work and going to school or whatever and going through it getting up and going going to sleep when you get home and getting up and do it all over again the next morning and playing video games and going to see hollywood movies and and what purpose does life have without christ christ is the thing that gives life meaning and purpose and he said here in our midst to heal the sick to proclaim and profess and to foretell and every time perfect and even concerned enough to bring a little dead fish back to his life again in the midst of us jehovah around us jehovah in us the great and mighty i am you think about a christ that cares so much for us that he he proved it by coming down and raising a little fish from the dead to prove that if he cares enough for a little fish to raise it from the dead he cares enough for you to heal you in your broken condition your broken mind your broken body he cares enough for you this morning and in hebrews chapter 2 verse 7 says thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and just set him over the works of thy hands and brother ram said an angel said that god made him an angel paul an angel said that god made him lower than an angel that he might crown him and he might suffer and taste death to be exalted up again you think you think about that pattern of the scripture that christ showed us how a christian is going to live by getting as low as he could so that he could be exalted now we think we're going to live any different we've got to live we've got to get so low that we're not higher than the dust because brother adam said when you when you get higher than the dust you're you raise yourself higher than god don't ever get higher don't ever try to exalt yourself do you think about how low jesus jesus came he came you know when we were born we we were many of us here we were born in a nice hospital or or even in a in a in a home that had you know nice pillows and things but jesus came down and was born in a little manger next to next to cows and goats over in the corner making fertilizer and just he he was born in such a such an humble way he came down so low lower than than even if we wanted to get down that low he came lower than we could even fathom it seems like in matthew matthew chapter 23 it says neither be called but jesus said give trying to try and exhort and tell us the pattern get get as low as you can neither be called masters for one is your master even christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant so if you want to be great be the servant of your brothers and sisters if you want to be great then humble yourself down where you can go visit the poor and visit the week and help somebody else if you want if you want to because a big shot then some something's off in your understanding of christianity because he said whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted what are we humbling ourselves to we're humbling ourselves to the word we're getting ourselves out of the way so that his word can be expressed that's why if we go to the next slide brother i'm getting went on to talk about how a body has to thou made me the body of the lord jesus christ made lower than the angels to take death and none with the very highest of high christ the prince of peace the king of kings the lord of lord the creator every star in the universe he became lower than his creation that he might redeem man and give them a home in heaven he left the glories of heaven he left the highest name that could be called and when he was on earth man give him the lowest name that they could give him said he was an illegitimate baby to start with born in a manger wrapped in rags off the back of a back of a yoke of an ox no place to go had no home to go to and was called beelzebub the chief of the devils he was mistreated he was spit on he was made fun of he was rejected and went to the lowest pits and stooped to the vilest of prostitutes that's what man done to him we'll go to the next slide thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set did set him over the works of thy hands but god brother ram said god raised him up so high that he'd have to look down to see heaven man given the lowest seat given the worst place the lowest name god raised him up and give him the highest seat and the highest name that's the difference what man done with the son of god and what god done with the son of god he stooped that we might be lifted he said no wonder he was exhausted no wonder he is who he is tonight god has exalted him and all the powers and heavens and earth is him because he stooped so low now if we go to the next verse in hebrews chapter 2 verse 8 it says thou has put all things in subjection under his feet i see paul you know he's echoing what we read in the first chapter that everything is under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him that's a seems like a very confusing scripture that everything's put under him but but not we don't quite yet see everything we don't see yet death and you know if if you're just a a a a newborn christian there's think god is actually working working out things in your life that you will see it through your christian journey things begin to leave you you don't see everything at once just like there at the beginning of the the ephesus church agent that it took a while for things to unfold uh irenaeus martin columba luther wesley as they began to preach things began to unfold until finally you get to the last church age and and god is actually building he's building something up by the by that life that he died so that he could put back in his church he's he's doing something so that finally at the very last death the last enemy will be destroyed that's why brother brown said but now we see not yet all things put under him that's death we don't see death yet because we're still dying we see death but here's i love this scripture and the next the next scripture but we see jesus we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should take death taste death for every man we see jesus now that's when we come to church that's what we're coming to church for us to see jesus to actually see and and how do you how do you well we'll we'll get into this through some quotes that we'll read in a second but how how how do you see jesus you can't see him with your physical eye he's not going to come walking through the aisles of this church within a physical body but we see him by the our spiritual eyesight becoming open to see the revelation of who he is now jesus is the word he's the actual the expression of god and so we've got we got on the pages of this bible the the written the written words of god and so if we see to see jesus you open up the word and you begin to look and it begins to paint a picture so that you can see jesus by looking at the word if you want to see the word then you go to the word and that's how you see jesus so brother brown said the people when they when he when he was coming down the the street there to die on the cross and going through all the the the motions of that day he said he said let's take our picture to jerusalem 2000 years ago how could you reject it i hear a sound coming through the street a bumping of something an old rugged cross coming down going out the gates of damascus there was actually the word made flesh coming down the street and nobody recognized it because they couldn't see that that was jesus you know compare that to today the word is being preached the bible is being lived out but so many people out out in the in in the world cannot see jesus just like in that day he said the people were blind they didn't know him they didn't recognize him you say blind could they have their sight you could still have your sight and be blind you can have your physical eyesight and be blind spiritually to not be able to see the word of god to not be able to see what's in these pages so we see jesus now we're not we might not yet see death destroyed where people are still dying people are still getting sick but we see jesus we know we know the the revelation of the word he said now if we go to the next slide he said people are blind tonight a certain church that don't believe in divine healing walked up to me one time and said smite me blind this might be blind is the point he's trying to make is you're already blind he said i said friend the devil has already done it you're already blind sure you are he said heal this little girl and i believe you could you imagine somebody saying that i said save that sinner and i believe you certainly oh he said he has to believe i said same thing here it has to come through the sovereign grace of god the devil the god of this world has blinded the eyes of the people they've got eyes but they can't see you do you see what a grace it is if your eyes have been opened to the word of god if you can look into the word and see the blueprint becoming open to know what your purpose is and what god wants you to do and maybe you know at the beginning of your journey you don't really understand how we're going to take a body change but the word begins to open up and you begin to see or understand what we're doing here and what the purpose of the message is and the purpose of the gospel that we're hearing and you see what it is you understand he said the devil the god of this world is blinded the eyes of the people they've got eyes but they can't see so we see jesus if we go to the next slide we see jesus we don't see all things but we do see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death let's go to the next slide he said and then jesus came and called and the musicians can go ahead and come forward we're gonna we're gonna end on this he said he was that truly he was that plus god he was the manifestation jesus is the body the boy the man god was what dwelt in him god was in him he was a god man he was a man yet he was god manifested in flesh when we see jesus we see god that's what he said when you see the father see me you see the father because he was the reflection he was the word that was in the beginning so when you see the word you're seeing god when you see this word when it begins to be opened up to you you are seeing jesus we might not see everything but we see jesus and we'll just end on that lord that is blessing
