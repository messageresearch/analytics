we be traveling home I I hadn't been home in 10 days so got ready to go home I guess that's right so uh this evening we going to go right to the word of the Lord I'm going to read from two places in the scripture first place I'm going to read this proverbs the 18th chapter I want to read one verse from that then I'm going read from St Matthew the 6th chapter Proverbs the 18th chapter Proverbs and I want to read one verse from there it'll be verse 10 and it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower amen the righteous run into it and is saved right excuse me St Matthew 6 same neew the 6th chapter and I want to read from the n9th verse now 6 Matthew the 6th chapter 9 through 15 and it says here after this matter therefore prayer Our Father which are in heaven amen Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth that's it as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen am right for if ye forgive means of their transgressions your heavenly father will also forgive you right right but if ye but if ye forgive not men of their transgression neither will your heavenly father forgive you of your transgressions let us pray gracious father God I just trust you right now for your grace I trust you help me to get myself out of the way one more time God help me to yield my body completely to you father Lord use it for your glory father now father God I commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ name we pray amen yes Lord maybe SE it one moment am praise God thank you Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening amen I tell from the scripture here in in the Book of Proverbs it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run in other words you got to be in a hurry in other words you can't be slopping around you got to run don't when people get something they excited you see a man running you know something is going on the name of the Lord is SC out and the rightous run into it and they are save and then I tell from here I tell from uh St Matthew 6 and um verse 10 is what I want to put my focus on thy kingdom come thy will be done in that's if you notice not on in Earth that's right as it is in heaven amen and I'm going to draw from that title of that topic uh that scripture verse the perfect will of God protection right and I took the I took this thought because I realized everybody want to feel the sense of being sense of security right yeah when a man when a man want to know that he's protected under God protection and my theme is God will and only only way that a man is going to be certain that he's under God protection he must have faith and understanding that he's in God will and if we understand God will is his word we we all are clear that but I want to look at the natural will as we begin to hear protection means to God or defend against harm or danger it means a shield protection mean to God a defend against harm a danger a shield everybody want protection in this Edge you need insurance you know we know we got insurance but don't be don't I told Brother you know people lot in the message they teach him not to get insurance but the point of it is they where the Rapture going to take place this this say if you die before the Rapture take place right then you got some problems because somebody going to have to put you in the grave right so you know in the me I found out sometime at church we burn a lot of people and then when they die they send to church I want you to pay this Buri your bill all you need to do is get you insurance right that's right I mean don't don't do you know you know this well you know everybody taugh these things and and we've been out of bouncing these things and so people that normally they get away from insurance because they feel like well the diretion take place I ain't going to have to worry about it well if it don't take place somebody going have to worry about your B exactly so you know Insurance you can you can save whoever left behind a lot of trouble by having insurance so he begin to realize and all the storms and and then things is going on in the world today we need insurance right I just had a house that got damaged it had a hellstone come down held by the side of a golf ball busting my roof busting some of my side and I think God I had Insurance because I was able to get my RO done and get my house side so if pays the in the natural to have insurance right and it pays that it gives you a sense of security to know that you are under a protection plan so we begin to look good so I begin to look at God's will of protection and we realize here the reason a person make a will is just to keep down confusion right that's right let me read here in the natural what a will is a will and then it it reads like this a legal paper in which a person tells what should be done with his or her money and property after the person dies right that's a natural will a legal paper in which a person tell what should be done with with you done what shall be done with her or her money a property after the person dies right right in other word a will is made to to keep down confusion right cuz every if if if you notice here when a person dies the family getting confused in everybody begin to fight everybody begin to say what they going to leave me yeah yeah a will is dependent on and not what you think about it or not what I think about is what the person had in his mind about you right right so when the person make out a will the reason he's the will he got you in his mind and he putting you down for whatever property he want you to have and whatever now you know if you're rich everybody going to come to your will yeah maybe your 14 cousin he show up you ain't seen him in 20 years here he go right and now all of a sudden you become his favorite cousin yeah Hallelujah all man of my favorite cousin another word but in other words so everybody but it don't matter it don't matter how many people come to the will a will is only read by somebody that's in authority to read it exactly right I was going to make out one and me and my wife were talking to a a lawyer and he was telling me what the processes I need to do so he can write it up how why because it got to have it got to it got to be recognized by an authority how you know anybody can write a piece of paper say I want you to do this how they how they got to be wrot by somebody they got a seal on it how they didn't know that this is what I'm done with it right and I find out a will is something as I travel through the through the country one thing I had never experienced i' have been many places at many tables I had never went to a table and sat down to eat and somebody had a wheel sitting on the table something I had never experienced no matter of fact I ain't never even seen nobody that had a will that never experienced ever picking up that oh this is Brother Sam will by get in the office yeah you don't you just don't find Wheels laying around the table in a bookshelf when you find a wheel when a man write a wheel he puts it away in a secret place right H somewhere that nobody don't know where they right yes and we here and then always kept in some type of Earthly vessel in somewhere that nobody can't find out what's going on Amen and number three about a will only way that you can be recognized on the will is that will must call you by name right amen anybody can show up with claims and say well he gave me this but the reason how you keep down the confusion when the whe is read it calls you by name and tell you what you got that's that's that's in the natural and so we begin to look here and I begin to look here I see God and we want to talk about God's will and we realize that God got a will and if God had a will he must put it in a vessel that's right and going be kept in a secret place Hallelujah he can't let this will be handed down and man get his hand on his will Hallelujah when Adam fell the will went back to God right because he said the legal exract the will cuz every name that was going to be there was on that actra and when Adam fell it went back into the hands of almighty God and nobody didn't know what was on the wheel no Hall so God took this wheel and he put it in a vessel right because the wheel must be kept in the Earthly V that's right let's see where he put itday Let us look at St John St John one right say John one turn in for a second St John one look and see what God put this whe cuz CU it got to be kept in a secret place that's right yeah and it says here I'm going begin reading at the at the 13 verse St John 1 verse 13 it says which were born not of what blood not of the will of the what flesh not of the will of who man but a w go right and the Word was made what and DW amongst us and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth what did God put his will he put his will in the Earthly vessel called Jesus now you want to realize here so if God put Jesus in his will in Earthly vessel so when he came the thing that he had to come to do is reveal what's on God's will right yep absolutely so if you notice here if you never look at it this way that's why Jesus had no claims of coming on his own right you about this Jesus didn't never come to say I come to show you this way I come to do this he never come to claim his will he said I've come not to do my own will but the will of him to S me why because he was his house in the father as well in other words in other words he said he said St 5:30 I I seek not my own will so in other words he did not come to reveal what was on the Earthly his Earthly with you he come to reveal what was in God mind so we see his will and we begin to go here look here and that what made Jesus that what gave Jesus power over every every enemy that what gave Jesus power over every devil because he did not come to do his own will he came to do the will of him that sent him H he came to express what was on inside of him God will right that's right and I begin to look here I read this morning Satan the will we've been a fight against Wills yeah and I read that isai this morning the batt B is Wills yeah Satan said I will yeah if you know the Satan terminology I will Jesus says thy will right Hallelujah cuz he didn't come to do his own will right he did not come to I didn't come to reveal I didn't come to express flesh I come to express the word the Supernatural Part why told you Peter flesh and blind never revealed this right because if he did he didn't want him to look his flesh he said but Flesh and Blood never gave you this Revelation but the the father it was his will for you to be there why because you was already on the book H so his will was I didn't come to do it in my flesh I come to express the Revelation on inside this what Jesus says here in his own word what Paul said have no cidence In the Flesh right that's right H in other words so Jesus didn't put confidence in he he had no flesh and didn't have no sin but he still got us to look to the he still got us look to the supernatural the spiritual Revelation because the devil cannot imp personate that begin to look at begin to look at the will and and as we begin to go here and we we just talking about a whe for a few minutes so his job was to express the father's will Satan job was to get Jesus to Le the father will and accept the will on earth right if you notice it say John 4 that why he car Jesus up and he said Jesus if you would fall down and worship me I will how you going to you thought about this how's Satan going to give Jesus something that he stole Jesus is not going to be guilty of receiving stolen goods how he didn't hold nothing on her so he could give it to her I give you this it was stolen goods he's a thief y he's a li so he was trying to get Jesus something that he done stole from him right Jesus said he ain't going to accept that he said I didn't come to do that I didn't come I didn't come to receive stolen goods hu I come to do the will of the father how do I come to worship God how do he did not come to to make a bargain with the devil I do this and I do that if you did he wanted Jesus to make him God right he wanted Jesus to come down and worship him so he could become the god of this evil age and if he would have come that Jesus would have fell down and worshiped the devil he would have made the dev of God and every time you say you were sick you have a right to say you were sick because sickness would have been a because Jesus would have gave it to every time you would have say I am depressed I'm going through depression you would you had a right to say that because Jesus would have made him God but Jesus I'm not going to make you God I'll Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall I serve so you have no right to talk about s right amen only right you got to talk about thy will be done Lord hallelujah so we begin to go so as I begin to look at this thing a little closer we realize here that that's what it's all been about it's been about God's will how and God's will is out a will how you know you on the will you must have the ability to hear your name right amen if you if you if you don't understand and other words Jesus here Jesus come to his disciples and he says here and Jesus begin to speak to them and he said eat my flesh and drink my blood Hallelujah the Bible says here they begin to look at themselves they said this is a hard say who can hear it so they were dealing with the who could hear this say how did we begin to go on and we look her who could hear this say h didn't they you know Jesus turns around and says to them H and you see the son of man they s that way com how the Bible say they walked away right St John 666 he took them all of the Beast he scra the name up the because they never walk no more with him and the turn from light is to walk in the Darkness so did Jesus turn around to his 12 said will you also go Hallelujah will you also go if you know that Judas was there but Judah was not on the whe How Judah would have been on the wheel the devil couldn't have never took Judas from God hallelujah so here he was Jesus said to them have not I chosen you have not I chosen you 12 and one of you not on the whe right right so we begin to go here we begin look into his will and then we begin to realize here as he begin to go and express himself the father's will in Christ so we realize here what is his will his will is that the end of the word you have the ability to hear his voice if you notice sure when God came to k k could never hear the word right when Jesus spoke the K say if you do this you'll be accepted the word should have put in the seed right but then he turned around and the church he said none SE can be quicked so when the word spoke the C it meant nothing he was not on the wheel and if you on the wheel that mean there no accident right that mean that if God put you on the whe that mean that God had you in his mind and that why the devil can never steal you from God right the devil would have t Peter he said he desired to see you Peter he got he want you Peter but I for you hallah why I had you on my mind and the devil can never take you from this will H so when God make a will he must declare the will right cuz we wouldn't have how would you have confidence in God if you didn't have confidence that when God saved me he started this thing he was going to keep me to the end that's right that's right our cism build on it that God cannot lie once he say something so if we we have a right to challenge the word after God say something if God lose somebody that's on the wheel he's no longer God that's right some people he had to take off the Earth early right right because they were disobedient but God see to it that they wouldn't be lost he they short God moved them out the Earth so it wouldn't be a stumbling block but God had to see to it because when God put his word up he declared his word this cannot happen happen right how you know I think from St John 10 John 10 let this here I'm going show you how important this is this will St John 10 and I want to begin reading St John 10 and I want to begin reading at verse 26 watch it right here when he speak the evidence is he says but ye believe not because ye are not of my what she sheep as I have said unto you in other word what was he doing he knew that sheep would hear the voice he says and no he said my sheep hear what and I know them and they follow me right and I give to them i y give unto them eternal life right and they shall never what neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand for my Father which gave them is greater is greater than all yeah and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I am my father all one I am the mystery of God's will revealed right right Hallelujah so no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand my she hear my voice and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's head all that the father's give me will come how nobody can come unto me except it was given to my father why because every man that come it's no accident you come right the reason you come he had you on the wheel H you don't think you just stumbl through life and out of the thousands of people you come to God and all of on you say and you say oh I made my mind up and I done that no you didn't make your mind up God made his mind up so if God declar I should not lose one that mean that God put his word to exate right and if God lose a Son of God if he lose one son he's no longer God right hall if God lose one person that God put on his will it discredit his whole thing to being God so God going to see to it that ever son make it so I I begin to look girl so if you remember so Jesus never did nothing except he looked at the will first that why when he got up to go to Samaritan that morning if you notice him what Jesus said he gets to go to Samaritan he just didn't get a he just didn't get a you know how we get a Zeal I got a Zeal to go down now H he got up he said I have need to go down there what was the need was somebody was going to will and when that person crossed the path with him glory it was not an accident she crossed his path when this lady this this protitute lady crossed his path what made him respond she had the same life right she had representation so here he goes he goes down to he goes down to the well and he says I have need to go to Samar what was he looking at he was looking at the wheel he said there's a little lady going to come down there and her name is there y her body is messed up her spirit is messed up but her soul came from God and I got to go down there and let her know what she come from right H so what he do he goes down to Samaritan if you notice here first off he shouldn't had him been down now right he shouldn't have been he shouldn't have went down to Samar that was on the south side of town he didn't need to be down there but he said I have need to go down there right so he go down to against just you if you notice here that why brother brand would react in ways that throw people's off hone when brother BR was down there and and and I think I think it was in uh Memphis Tennessee and one them play that old blind color man were praying and they would telling brother brand because there was segregation that that and then brother you get our pre this man you going start a war brother said I don't care what I start he think God called me to bre and he had to obey the will he come to do what it ain't got nothing to do with Flesh and Blood it got something to do with finding the mind of God that's rightly yes sir so he go down to SMY and he stands by the well at the hour that nobody else didn't want to be identified with because this is the hour that the unclean women's come down yeah you know most people we all going down you know God will or not I'm not going to be down there with all them prostitutes coming down Jesus said I got to do the father's will I better leave my critic disciples back there cuz won understand this yeah right so he go down he didn't care none of them so he stand by the well and he waited to these prostitutes start to come I'm just paraphrasing for a few minute maybe one come got some water and she probably looked at him what he doing down here you don't got nothing to do with them Jews yeah she drops a bucket she go get some water she go back she roll the eyes and Jesus Jesus didn't have say word another prostitute come by just say paraphrase she goes to P she look at this Jesus standing he better get out of here for dark she Dr up fck she come at him but here come here come a prostitute that had representation right so when she come in contact with God he knows his sheep he said I know them this woman was no I surprise to Jesus right he knew exactly who she was so when she crossed her was two uniped men right something took place in his spirit and Jesus knew that was the one Hallelujah something when she Flash before him he knew that she was the one so he never spoke to none of the rest of them right right as soon as she goes to the well and drop her Bucky down Jesus asked her a question woman give me a drink right now just thing is first of all she had a problem with him standing there yeah she might have been a prostitute but she wasn't stupid that long yeah she had to go out the Jew that was out you know that was you know she nak man this man what is he doing down here she dropped up bucket Jesus speak to her he said woman give me a drink yeah and she turned around look at who you talking to me she said yeah talking to you give me a drink what did she do immediately she start to explain you down here at this well you got nothing to draw with the well is deep why you asking me of a drink mhm so if you notice this the most decent thing she could have did the most common thing to do is say Jesus I dropped my water bucket you need a drink drink for my bucket you know why she didn't do that cuz she didn't want no Jew putting his lip on her [Music] bucket she Jesus do how come down and come out she was willing for drun out of her bucket right this woman didn't want that Jew drun it out of her bucket but once the Holy Ghost come it don't matter about the place he come to tell so he go then he begin to go on and why because Jesus had to save his woman because she was on the wheel how I didn't care how bad her life was how bad she was mixed up his job was she had eternal life right here she had to recognize it right so then he goes on he talks Jesus says to this woman as the conversation go if you know who I am you know who I am you would ask me of a drein and I will give you water that you wouldn't have to come around and draw no more when she responded watch her respond when did she get this Revelation give me all this water right something on the inside her say I need this water give me all this water that I don't have to thirst and come at this well and draw them up then Jesus stops and he begin to deal with her now right because he sees the condition she in so what did he ask you he said go get your husband right in other words go get your husband and this woman turned around say I ain't got no church I've been going to this church I've been I I'm on the internet how I I play tapes yeah hallah I don't go to church I don't got no headship I'll do my own thing and I can go what I want to do I'm not under nobody headship how did Jesus say now you telling the truth you been to church to church and that's not and then she say she recognizing the word calling her so what did she say h Lord the word begin to go on and on then Jesus begin to talk to this woman and all of a sudden as they begin to go this conversation the demons begin to leave her and they said you know she get released I don't care where you go you start talking to anybody y they can be drinking a pack of six Buck wises yeah soon you mention Jesus that religious spirit po up y b Wiis ain't leaving but the religious your H I was in a I was in a convenience store I told a while back and a man was telling a real dirty joke real dirty joke so I was standing there and this guy told this real dirty joke you people buying stuff he just told everybody laughing but me I didn't think the joke was funny and uh the guy looked over at me and he said what do you do I said I'm going preach he said praise the Lord oh yeah I'm try to think where did that come from me but that's just the way it Jesus told this woman all of sudden she get Religion she in this condition how this well well you should have been obeying you would have been in the condition you H but that religious spirit come in what why did she get religious people this is what Revelation L that the reason she got religious that religious demon was trying not to let her go right exactly if he hold her back under the truition of her father she would accept the word like i s he hold the back the religious spirit of our fathers been as well you said to Jerusalem he wouldn't want to let go her but Jesus said I'm com to tear down your TR they coming a time that you was NE in Jerusalem not at this well what he doing he was doing away with the TR and as she received the word she was set free that demon left the woman told come man I to go here look here when God calls a person in the wheel Thee the thing that we had recognized yet that when God calls a man to the will he has the ability to hear God's voice right right and if if you cannot hear his voice then you got question is on there because a will when somebody call you in the wheel and then you go to read a will and they M around and says to you how I call you your daddy just left you $1 million it going to be a lot of shouting in I didn't even have to work for this I didn't label for it I didn't put no investment in it but my daddy had me on my mind he had me on his mind and he wrote in the whe to give me $1 million I am the happiest person in the world Hallelujah in other words that's what God did in his will I'm not going to give you one M I'm going to give you eternal life H I'm going be the happi people on this that's in the will in people it is today it's in this world today that God cannot in no circumstance lose the Son of God right amen he cannot blashe himself away no right right if he lose a Son of God then he's no longer God right right why Jesus even under unreasonable circumstances Jesus always SA know as his right absolutely and when they don't even seem like they can be saved he got ways to meet he got ways to save Son of God sometime you say how did this happen right here how did they how he save a Son of God how did he make how how did he get this person he called they Happ through life yeah right make sure that some way right we come across the word h look at here we go back we go to a natural genetics and we begin to run it down and you'll find out in your background just person was married to that person H this was an outlaw this right here he was a woman and this person was married to this person and this person here and all you go back through your family tree you find out it ain't even one re but all through that your G travel had to be join why did you die all the brother die but you kept coming you finally come on Earth had to be two people in meet right make up to make you because you have have a St way until you respond to God all the thousands of your brothers and sisters died in that message called one in a man all those SE went out they die but why didn't you die all down to the because God had you on the whe how God had a purpose for you that's why you he made a natural birth and more more mysterious than Sil birth exactly am we here by God perfect will Y and God had a plan for you H you born here God called you and put you together here H nothing could take your place H all all everybody all the seed that went down through here and just German through this Grand PR this Grand go back and look through your genetics you better leave that long you might leave that you might find something you don't want to know but here it is you know other words you know so we in other words that why we can't get our mind on our genetics Hall you can't get your mind on there all that you got toiz all I know I had to be there all the things I went through and I went this way and that way and all of a sudden God call up how you do that because when you hear the voice your body change right something start taking place right so in other words in other words some of you we shouldn't even be here we should have went straight to hell right amen hallah your bypass go straight to hell right amen H it ain't nothing that you done to make yourself good enough even not even to the point that you was looking for God yeah if God got you on the will it ain't you to find God it's God's purpose to find you H you ain't going down tell God I'm trying to buy you having you God but something on inside begin to go off that's the seed that's God that's the part that God put in you you might not understand that God had control of you when you didn't have control is the thing that is about his will so you begin to look here when you look at God will how look at right look at the condition Jesus deal with right right yeah if I was going to write a wheel you certainly ain't going to write it to that kid that's without smoking pot yeah you be try if you do you write a whe at the end of the day brother I want this in the whe When I die take this much money put him in a rehab right cuz you feel like this kid right here is out of control right H but when God rote a wheel H he took P that didn't even seem like they were fit for nothing Hall that's what he do he put people people didn't they see like they was worth nothing no earthly value how but he put them in the whe right and God going to see to it let they get sa out of all the prostitutes in that town right right the spies went to Rahab house exactly yeah out of all those prostitutes in the in that town God went to the right house the right number in the right place at the right time because she was on the wheel how because God had seen how you know she's on the wheel if you want read if she on the Wheel all you got to do pick up Hebrews 11 right she was in the will Hallelujah so if you want to see her name she was there Hallelujah so the will had to call her by name so here she was in Hebrews 11 Hallelujah we find r y how she get there yeah she was there all the time right she was there all the time but God had to get her to it he had to get her to the place to recognize what she was she would do all the prostitutes in the to God s the spies by r amen ra said I'm going to hide these gent H I heard about their testimony I hear about what they done how hear all I'm going to hide these men so ra the har didn't never change that title right still called Raab it might have been recognized on Earth Raab but it God mind she was a daughter Hallelujah she was a daughter of God so ra took them and hit him you know the story at the end of the day what did they tell Raab RAB I want you to put this scet clo down right and when we come through the land M we're going to destroy everything y but when I see that token y that Scarlet claw yes sir we're going to pass over you and I begin to look at her cuz the point of it was I don't know what people she probably had a lot of criticism because everybody probably looking at RAB saying this dirty old she Ain up in a red screen Red Red Door woman and they talking joke about ra and everybody had everything against Rael they can find because she was not good enough how do everybody run by RAB how did rab did this and rab did that but I want you to notice here when Joshua and them came through the city the whole city fell flat everybody in the city died ra didn't have no accusers so she didn't have nobody there to say she did that and she done that he killed accuser how know Jesus when the came did I love woman at the what I accuser lady hell nother do I condem how go no more how what he do he take us in the whe he drop us in the blood and we have no accuses amen hallelujah I'm just say here few down you got to come and the will must call you by name right and you must see your name yeah that's right the point of it is if you die you must hear your name right he said the seven CS call you by name H and then way you must be able to know I'm in the will right cuz a lot of people say I don't know if I'm there you got problems yeah yeah if you don't know you there then you get have proper Faith right right how do your faith always be up and down because the devil going always attack your mind and try to make you feel that you there so you got to have confidence and only way that you know you down you got to know the word for your day how you got to know what the word said about you it a what you said well I believe that Brother Sam going to be there that's good but second Revelation won't change you got to have your own Revelation amen that's right you say how you know get the son s they try to cast out devil we enjo you in the name of Jesus who Paul preached the demons said man you better get out our faith with this stuff you don't even know God H so them demon demon leave there jumped on there why because they tried to enure a demon with a secondhand Revelation it ain't what brother Brandon said it ain't what brother it's what God revealed to you through the word he preached how did it become your Revelation and once it become your Revelation you see your name now that's right Lord am you know the day that we in we need to see our name in the will yes sir am we need to know that we there right so I picked it up in uh I picked up Ephesian one let look at here we talking about the will of God Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 and I says God perfect will so now he going to call you by name in the will because you got to know you've been put there right so now he goes here Ephesians 1 and I'm going to begin reading at verse 9 heav made known unto who all right oh he talking to me now that's right I get ready to tell the devil to get off my back H get ready let the devil know I done found myself in the word how the book of Ephesians par the Book of Joshua and Joshua positionally placed them the book of ephes place you in your will amen hallelujah having made known unto who the mystery of what HJ it was a mystery one time it was a mystery because I didn't know who I was but once the word come off and a mystery is a open book how and when the seal open how in the BX car and the BX car was a in the message breach he said that BOS car was seal and get to destination but when he get to Des once the BOS car the seal been broke right and the one going in the claim what's his there no more my right Hallelujah so never got how did end up being broke how what we was in God so he broke the he broke the mystery of his will to us now we see who we are amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself right uhuh I know this don't let this word scare right here he said that in the dispensation of the forness of time that he might get together in in one all things right in CHR both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him right Hallelujah if whom and when we also have attained an inheritance a will is inheritance how something that you have attained something that that was a mystery you didn't know that the person put you there for but it's become a mystery but when the whe is read and you go and claim what he gave you it's no more of a mystery is broke right amen and he says right here he said and who T Hur it being predestinated that's the word to scare on cuz people took their predestination out of the context cuz they look at predestination I can be predestinated and if you stay a drunk it don't really matter Hallelujah you going to be saved in the way no sir if you predestinate you going to come to the image of God predestination is not based on staying still predestination is based on I'm going to be conformed to the image of the Living God have predestinated us to be conformed to the image of God it ain't no Dev in hell can stop that that's God's word that's predestination if you predestinated and you still drinking and smoking and know the of the world something wrong because you going to come through it h you have a desire want to be more like amen right point of it is you got to grow to this thing and when we come into some of us babies we got to overcome things we got to lay things aside but we still spiritually growing in other words Prett because you know you might not be a butterfly like I said it go through stages but it eventually the calar become a butterfly you just be patient with me you watch it come to maturity right right have predestinated according to the good pled C no having pred let me read read the wrong verse me who have attained inheritance being predestinated according to the right according to the purpose of him who work all things after the councel of what amen his own will that we should be that we should be to the praise and of his glory whom First Trust in Christ so now he he he put the wheel here he tells here you in the will I have predestinated you to be there I call you by name he he according has he chosen Us in him H we see a name in the book H the devil come here say where you at you are over to the book of FIA say he's talking about me devil I'm already there right right somebody going to believe that that's right am let me let me let me take predestination and and and and being conformed into the image of the Living God you know I I got a lot I can go on it all but I want to say this this evening this a thought I want you to notice here predestination is based on God said my she hear my voice right right if God said that that somewhere in your Christian Journey you got to hear his voice right you that why you find peoples that you know that been going going going you wouldn't have thought they would never been saved even your own even in your own mind you erase them off you said I know that person ain't going to be there oh my I know that person ain't going to be there I I just can't see all the stuff they done and all of sudden amen amen you be say man I didn't even I remember one time I judged a girl and the spirit of Lord re my window I told her I apologize to her to I saw the girl come to church she was so immorally I said man and the brother was mared and he asked me he said brother je he said should I give her a chance I just drop her and I looked at the girl my first impression was out run but I'm glad I didn't tell him that amen I didn't say that I just thinking that when I saw her he said I said well son I said look at this I said God gave you a chance I said you've been involved with this girl for two or three years I said you need to give her a chance I said either she accepted or she rejected but you owe her you owe her to give her a chance right right and what he did now she the most holiest looking girl I ever saw right because somebody had to give so you don't know what it is you we we what we do we judge by the outside that why we got so many problems now how do we look at somebody that's spiritually ain't been behind the veil and you looking at her well that sister right there that brother right there he ain't going to make it you just let God worry about that you just keep preaching the word so let me go let me just use this let call here I just looked at Paul I might have told this more than once because Paul is a perfect example of somebody on the wheel right remember he said my sheep hear my voice so God have declared this so he was obligated for Paul to hear the voice right now you said brother Jew you said brother JW he was obligated that Paul would hear the voice so we we go here we realize here that we realize here Paul had did some things according to the word that Paul should have went stay to hell right if we would look at Paul in his natural standing yeah right Paul left no scripture to be saved on right because when he when Jesus said in the word touch not my anointing and do my prophets no harm right it's better for a meal Stone to be TI around your neck you thr it to the dev to see and Dr then touch one of my anointed yes Paul didn't only touch your anointed he the Son of God that was full of the Holy Ghost right exactly so he couldn't look at the scripture because the scripture already condemn him right he could not make it on his marriage no right that's right that why when you sang a ma of Grace you are not never sang A maor Grace for what you quit or what you done you ought to sing a major gra because God found you when you was unsaved right amen H when it look like you was going straight to hell that what made it Amazing Grace Hallelujah so so he was he did all the things and he would have went straight to hell right but here it was the Bible tells us before Jesus died he did something that we must catch in the Scripture it was important that Jesus react this way he looked at his disciples one day brother he said I'm going to give you power I'm going to empower you when the king Empower his son he takes the ring off his finger right he takes the ring off his finger and this King gives this he put this ring on his son and when he doing what is he doing he's empowering him right amen with his lordship right and whatever that son put on that when he take that ring and he put that symol there that mean it got to be CED out how before Jesus left he did one thing he empowered his sons right he said I'm going to tell what I'm going to do so I'm getting ready to leave but I'm going to empower you yeah I'm going to give you power whoever seeing you remit is remitted whoever seing you bound is bound I'm EMP power you Church H I'm not going to do it I'm giving you the power to do it he never gave that power Hallelujah he gave that power before he left right right exactly then after the Holy Ghost come y he empowered him yep cuz he couldn't give it to Peter at first Peter Still was on the other side of the fence right you know what I mean Peter man tell you what you doing man put this sword up what you doing boy you just cut this man off what till you get saved you can get some power but right now but you ain't ready for you been pull out 44 shot you so you had to wait a little while but once they come once they went up in the upper room he empowered there and they had the power now how do he Empower them to do what to impart life right right whoever seen you remit they'll remit whoever see you bound this bow I'll give you power here right so he EMP powered them right so when Paul committed this CME mhm he s against the body Y where the Holy Ghost was leaveing no way according to the scripture just law when a king write a law it must be carried out right so Not only was he was bound the law was there to condemn him touch not my anointing and do my prophets no harm it's better for a millstone to be tler you throw to the dep ofch he stoned Stevenson y he was a murder and he should not have made it according to the human mind right right he should not have made it as he was there they was waiting for Paul he had the authority that said should we Stone him Saul Saul walks over there to him he looks at him sa should we do it Saul says kill right they took stones and they begin to Stone him at his consent he didn't pull the trigger he might as well pull the Trier right he held the coat and everything else he might well done it the blood was on him because he had the power to do he the power to let it go or not but he said kill him Hallelujah in word he was stoning this man H this man that full of the Holy Ghost Ste preaching the word to him had one convert out of all that preacher he did y that Paul Paul that's right right how did the word of God don't return vo how did he preach the word one person got sa Paul nobody else here to understand what was going on exactly and all of a sudden it was almost over but it was important that Stevenson react before he died because he realized he was dying right and at the end of the RO he got to say the right word how in the third pool is say the right word he had to the right word at the end of the day so at the end of the day he be to weak it down his body was getting weak he said I need just a little scre I'm getting ready cross over Jesus stands up just to scren him a little more yep and his last words was as he be to drop into death right he had to drop the charges against Paul he said father laid not this charge how did Paul would went the hell but the blood smoke how when he say Lord let notro he forgave when he gave Paul everything that Paul did against was scr off right h pauled a white stone and he went right the presence of God H show and the musicians come I'm going to say this your musician I'm parachute I told him like this in the in the in the ancient days they said when a man committed a crime when he committed a crime and he done a real major sin they were bringing before the king and they would judge this man they would bring this thief or whatever he is and he committed a crime you know the king or back then maybe the old England it was under the England thing had maybe had a white wig on right had his white wig on and they bring this man there and they judge this man and if this man was found innocent if this man was found without any see in a blish the old Ancient King would reach in his pocket and pull out a white stone and then that white stone he would give to that man and when he give that white stone to that man that mean that every time of accuser come up against him and try to say he did all he got to do is show the white stone right how that white stone me that they had devil did it in the first place God took her and gave her the white stone and every time the devil come to her to reach it up right amen already Jud Ain nothing against me a white stone that what it all mean God gave us a white stone and every time we come to go through the Judgment we hold it up and the devil recognize I can't lay nothing against him we lay charge to God he L how we already been judged through the word he gave a white stone say Here I Am to Worship you I don't know if you know song Anybody know that song Here I Am to Worship you here I to say goad I don't know it one thing I wish do let us say stand on Holy Ground I do know H we are standing on Holy Ground Hallelujah H I got a white stone and I'm standing on Holy Ground I'm not going to let no accuse him come to me H God didn't give me the spirit of accus he didn't give me the he gave me a white stone am amen if I knew I was judge you know some people if I say this if you had a lot of things against you and you were so guilty and you walk before this just say the president of the United States you should have been executed right and if they will pull out and give you a white stone you would be the most happiest person in the world because know I should have died you wouldn't have no problem when something come up against you you'll be glad to show it
