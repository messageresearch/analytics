want to see a man this morning you want a same mr. brick you each and every one of you of lesson morning in the name of the Lord Jesus I greet you from my church in tight tie the Philippines which we call the Church of the overcomer and I am very thankful that the Lord has given me this opportunity to be able to minister again to this congregation I'm really thankful for the connection that he has made you know between our church my ministry and this ministry in Lula Georgia I want you to know that this church has been helping me in our missionary endeavors in the Philippines and I think before I go to the preaching of the word I just wish to share reduce some things that are taking place in our country as far as outreach is concerned you can be seated for just a little while before coming over here month before coming over here we made a trip to some ballast it's about four hours north of Manila and from a town called botolan we had to rent a we call it they call it the weapon carrier it's a war vehicle because because nothing else can make it to the road conditions as you can see in the presentation 12 some 12 years ago I baptized a tribesman along with the 70 other Negritos we call him and they belong to the eight tribes the itit rides and they look like little applicants you know only smaller the same skin same appearance curly hair good and they're like our aubergines the Filipino aubergines and so I baptized this brother along with the others and then because of I was so busy you know with outreach and with ministry I did not actually do any Paulo op work on these people Mississippi it's kind of hard to go to where they are but last month out of the blue this brother showed up in my church with three workers and I found out that he had become a minister a pastor from a Korean sponsored church something like a Presbyterian Church the planet if I'm not mistaken but the the things that we heard 12 years ago when we presented a message to them he said I helped them in my heart I've treasured the words in my heart you know and the matter what I heard from this other of denominational preachers and theologians that that taught us in the ministry I took a hold of what I heard twelve years ago because I believe it was a truth and they came to my church one thing to know more and so they stayed there for about for about a week and I taught them more more of the word more where the Prophet said and so this brother has been praying for a Church that can be started in their old community back in 1991 among kena to bow erupted and it's supposed to be the second biggest eruption in this century and when it erupted there was we were four hours away in Manila but there was about an inch of ice for in our roof so that's how how outspread the explosion and and asphalt reached as far as Indonesia in Malaysia and so these people these people used to live at the foot of the volcano and they will deflect this place because of the eruption and the government tried to resettle them and gave them about 50 square meters about 500 square foot of property for family and they they find it hard to survive on that because the mountain people they live on the land they hunt and they farm and they just couldn't survive on a little plot like that so after about 20 years they went back to where the eruption took place you know right at the foot of the volcano and started planning and to their surprise the the soil became very fair tile that the the plants the the trees and the things that they planted actually grew rapidly which made them decide to go back to this community and right now there's 200 families that have come back and are resettling in this community and this brother but appalled the leader I found out that he's one of the elder elder of the community is highly respected amongst these 200 families and is said he if you don't mind I would like to invite you to come to our place to that to that community so you can see the situation and because I believe there's a possibility that we can build a church there and kiss the people a message let's see some of those slides here this is this is about a pole right here what's second to the left so he was the one that brought the other minister to train in our church hmm next slide please and so this was the night before we were planning our the launch for us to go to go to that community and talk to the people there and maybe hold a service and present Jesus Christ to the people next this was a type of vehicle that the can can travel the area there's there's no other vehicle they can do it so we had to rent this daco for about maybe $200 for the whole day so we can use it for the whole day next and we carried some supplies to bring to those people because they they have nothing over there next as you can see it was raining and these are brothers from our church in in in Thai tag that helped me out there's about a dozen of them that came with me next either way they were soaked soaking wet because of the rain next day that's the and then it's the Sun started to shine now they're bearing the heat of the Sun after the rain next now this is one of the houses that has been built there always there's probably about two dozen houses like this in the area because they were given them something like to a KERS for family at the foot of the mountain you can see the amount in a two bow on the background right there you know the houses are made of grass you know that's roof next and this was a spot that they donated to us so we can build a church right there so this is the very first church that will be built in this new community praise the Lord for that yes hallelujah next and these are demand these are the leaders of this community called baboon sea lemon baboon solanum is in English it means the place of the new birth thanks now this one is a woman preacher no but she gladly received us and puts up to cooperate when we build a church there you know we were sharing the message to her and so far she has accepted everything that she heard face alone next these are the newly settled 8 of villagers 200 of them by the end of the year they expect a thousand families to move in though it got next and that's another house few houses has been erected in the village next these are the eighth of children that have to walk two hours to school the nearest school is two hours away next another one of the houses see these they don't have floors that's just a sand floor the whole thing is like a sand field we call it to the heart field that's the mud flow coming from the volcano next as you can see no other vehicle can go through like if you miss the if you miss the once a day trip of the weapon carrier you have to take this the the water buffalo cart to take about eight hours to cover the area next or this is the common just a common mode of transportation in the provinces we call it the sky lab that's the whole family in one scooter next or this this is a three-wheeled vehicle it is very common in a country next as you can see this is a deserted place there's nothing in it no supplies no stores no schools no medical clinics no doctors whatsoever you know they live a tough life over here next now this was where the this building was where the sisters cooked food for 200 families that attended the evangelistic service it's a beautiful place as you can see thanks now they have to carry this steel ramp to keep the truck to keep our trap from stalling in the sandal hartfield we had to cross the river a dozen times to reach our destination next as the beautiful mount up in to book next and these are then agreed Negrito villagers intently listening to the Gospel as it's being preached so the Lord has supernaturally opened the door to this community so we can build a church over there when I go back we will start digging a well and building a church because there's no problem building concrete blocks in the area there's a lot of sand from the volcano so we just have to supply them a cement and some iron and galvanized sheet for roofing and I believe we can start a good sized Church there in this community so you just remember us in your prayer Aladin okay we now go to the message proper and my message is taken from attacks in Zechariah chapter 4 verse 1 to 10 thank you for standing up in respect to the Word of God I entitle this message the might and power of Zerubbabel the might and power of Zerubbabel and the subtitle is the coming of the headstone Zechariah chapter 4 verse 1 to 10 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see us thou and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick of all gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top there off and to all the trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and other upon the left side there off and so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these you see Zechariah could not understand the vision so he was asking the angel what was this my lord and then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not was this me and I said no my lord and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord and to zerubabbel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou or great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone there off with shouting saying grace grace unto it let us pray how many father we thank you again for this blessed opportunity to be able to talk about your word and to serve your people and be an encouragement to them I pray father that you send your anointing right now and cost me to say something that would really encourage the people and cause them to go on Lord as we strive Lord to which that state of perfection that you are requiring in the church just be with us Lord we present all the needs to you as we are a needy people this morning we just believe that you're able to reach out to meet each and every one of them we thank you and praise you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray I mean be be seated now sakurai administered during the time when Israel went back to Judah after being held captive for seventy years plus we all know they were held captive for seventy years in Babylon and of course Nehemiah built the city but there was a need to restore the temple and Zerubbabel was commissioned to build a temple of the Lord because it was completely demolished by the Babylonians and the Israelites being godly nation wanted to having been resettled in Judah they wanted to rebuild the temple and so the local residents of Judah after they left you know when they were still in Babylon huh they wanted to help out you can read this in Zechariah chapter 3 they wanted to help build the temple they wanted they were proposing a ecumenical construction project you know the religions coming together and helped build the temple again because it was once a significant temple fame was the whole world the Jewish temple that Solomon built but you see they refused not because of pride but because they didn't want people that built temples and altars for pagan gods to be helping in the construction in the temple they wanted to be built by true believers they they didn't want any denominational hand in it and but then the people pestered them and used their political influence and wrote to the king and warned the king that these people are they once of rebelled against the kingdom and they were telling the king that they told the king in their letter that should the temple be rebuilt that they would certainly be in resurrection in insurrection again these people are rebels and so and and it and it discouraged the people somewhat discouraged the people and after our building the foundation of the temple fifteen years passed and nothing was done to build the temple and it was laying there desolate just the foundation and because the people with discouraged and they actually deserted the project and started building their own houses use me and you could resist in the book of Haggai chapter one huh I think verses 3 and 4 down to the tenth verse let me just read it for you then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying it is time for you to dwell in your sealed houses or houses with feeling paneled houses and this house lies in waste I mean the Prophet Haggai was preaching to the people of Israel because they pursuit the building of the temple and started building their nice houses hallelujah now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much and bringing little heat but you have enough you have not enough you drink but you have not killed the drink you clothe but there is not there is none warm and he that earn it we just earned it wages to put it into bag with holes this thus said the Lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build this house and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified said the Lord you look for marks and lo it came too little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why said the Lord because my my house lay in waste I mean pasture high pasture hey guy was upset with the people because you know the people say why would I give to the Lord why would I give to the church why would I contribute to the build construction of the church when I have a lot of meats myself I have many bills to pay not realizing that the need of God to be worshipped is more important than any of your needs hey guys there that's the reason God is not blessing you because you're putting your needs first before the need of the Lord to be worshipped we have many needs but I believe I believe first and foremost God's need to be worshipped should be met speak first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things that you can think of that you need ah hallelujah can ever think of will be added and to you hallelujah I believe that you know my heart now when Zechariah was shown this vision of the seven golden candle stick you know it's no different from the seven golden candle stick of Revelation chapter one verse 12 that was shown to John you see the it's a lamp stand and for a lamp stand to burn and be able to give light or shine the light it needs oil and Zechariah was being shown that on both side of the lamps and stand order candlestick of course we know that the candlestick represent the church ages it's the church hallelujah well in order for the church to give light it has to have oil and we see here the second ayah saw the the two olive oil or olive tree it's like a direct supply sustaining the supply of oil to the standby huh are you listening this is if this is God supplying the Holy Spirit to the church hallelujah because without the Holy Spirit the lamp scent will never burn the peep the world will never see the light of God the light of the world without the oil so who the only the only priest represent the steady supply and I believe that's what we need a steady supply of oil amen not just a deep at a time you know when you're down when you're feeling down and you need to be revived you're asking for oil you're asking for God to give you a revival no we need a sustaining source we need the the Holy Spirit of God every single moment of our life hallelujah hallelujah now people say that the two olive lived all the trees were Zechariah and Haggai because they were the two prophets that minister during this period of time encouraging the people preaching to the people to come and work together to be able to restore the temple of the Lord and start worshipping God in Jerusalem again in spite of the situation of the in spite of the problems that were facing it was very very turbulent times that they were facing but Zechariah and Haggai they were very faithful in teaching the word to them encouraging them so some theologians think that the two olive trees were Haggai and Zechariah but then again some preachers think that these are not Haggai and Zechariah but these are zerubabbel and Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel was assigned as the governor of Judah at that time he was over the people and he was the ruler of the people and he took the initiative to lead the people in building the are building the Temple of the Lord hallelujah and so they're saying it must be saruba Bell and Joshua now we'll go back to this a little bit but it wasn't those not Haggai and and zechariah 'not zerubabbel and joshua we read in the book of revelations chapter 11 the true interpretation let me just find it here yeah revelation revelation verse 11 chapter 11 verse 3 and 4 I think that that's the fourth slide ok the Bible says and I will give power unto my two witnesses we all know that this is Moses and Elijah right the two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days three and half years clothed in sackcloth and and we read next these are the two only trees and the two candlesticks standing before God the god of the earth hallelujah so the theologians got it wrong the Bible is always right you don't have to interpret God's Word God has a way of interpreting his own word hallelujah in Zechariah chapter four verse eight to ten he can go back to the slags brother I think and it's in the fifth slide Zechariah chapter chapter four verse eight to ten moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel laid the foundation of this house and his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you and who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hands of just arewho in tho with those seven and they are the eyes of the Lord which one to and fro through the whole earth now here with the zerubabbel holding the plummet in his hand you know of the chief engineer or the chief builder holds the plummet because the plummet is the what you call that in our present language is a plumb bob it's a plumb bob it keep it keeps things straight hallelujah it keeps the other structures structural members in its right place hallelujah so we see that the river bill was the main man he was commissioned to lay the foundation and he laid the foundation and for 15 years nothing happened and then Haggai encouraged the people if he will just immense step in faith that's when Zechariah was given the vision of the golden candlestick and Zechariah asked the question what does this mean it's not by might nor by power don't you look for the people who would like to cooperate don't you look for number and the might of the people hallelujah don't you look to King Diaries or King Silas or our tech senses to give you the authority in order to finish this temple it's not by might nor by power of any man it's by my spirit says the Lord hallelujah the temple of the Lord will be built because of the power of God hallelujah because of the power of the Holy Ghost did not the Bible say unless the Lord builds the house its builders is the laborers build it in vain hallelujah let's look at the words of Haggai chapter 1 verse 4 to 8 and then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying it is time for you oh yay to dwell in your sealed house and this his house lying in a way this was a guy trying to encourage the people I think we're ready already ready now therefore does said the Lord of Hosts consider your ways you have so much and bring little heat but you cannot you have not enough you drink but you have not filled your drink you have coated but there's no warm and then you have you earn it rages and ernit wages but put him into a bag with whole hallelujah thus said the Lord God of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountains and bring wood in other words help contribute to the building of the temple isn't that what God is doing today I believe the Sega Raya was shown not the building of the second Zechariah was shown the building of the Church of Christ he was shown the completion of the Bride of Christ hallelujah he was shown our day hallelujah thank you Jesus now in Revelation chapter one verse eight see the foundation has been laid and it says here I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the ending said the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty the Jesus is saying I am the beginning and I am the ending I am the foundation and I am the headstone I am the capstone in first Queen can shelter three verse 11 it says for our foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is the Lord Jesus Christ the foundation of the church is the Lord Jesus Christ efficient chapter 4 verse 15 says but speaking the truth in love that we may grow up unto him into all things which is the head even Christ Christian growth is geared towards reaching the stature of Christ the stature of a perfect man there's no perfect minimalist there's only one perfect man and that's Christ hallelujah so he's the head is the headstone he's the capstone is the foundation and is the capstone hallelujah Haggai chapter 2 verse 23 on that day it says the Lord of Hosts I will take use the rouble son of CF VL my servant and wear you like a signet ring for it is you whom I have chosen this is the word of the Lord now the Rubel has been chosen of the Lord huh as a signet ring and a seal in the Hebrew translation the signet ring and the seal mean the same thing hallelujah because the King he wears a ring and with it he steals all documents all the orders that come from him and once it is sealed it becomes official hallelujah huh so the Robo Bell was the one well I was thinking maybe because silver Bell is in the Linga in in lineage of David King David hallelujah but you see I have a different way of looking at it the word silver Bell actually means one that is born in Babel one that is born in Babylon confusion weren't we all but there was another another man that was constantly with Zerubbabel as they were building the temple and that man was Joshua the high priest komai this is wonderful Joshua and Zerubbabel and Bevin said Joshua means Jehovah and the name Jesus actually means Jehovah is Savior hallelujah the rubber Bell could not do it alone he needed Joshua hallelujah that's why if you read the book of Zechariah in the book of Haggai it's sometimes confusing because sometimes it looks like saruba velak being called the branch but other times Joshua it's being called the branch now wish you switch hallelujah I I believe there's a reason for it let's talk about the branch the branch is an Old Testament term that refers to the Messiah in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 2 it says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel talking about the coming Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah but here in Zechariah chapter 6 we read who that the angel was instructing Zechariah to take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of Joshua not survivable but Joshua the high priest the son of josedech the high priest and speak unto him saying that speak speak at the Lord of Hosts say behold the man whose name is the branch oh my I thought serum Abell was the branch but now here Joshua is called the branch and he shall grow up unto this place and he shall build the temple of the Lord even he shall build a temple of the Lord and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both my two persons are involved here in building the temple who are they the revival and Joshua the riverboats called the banks Joshua is called the branch Oh - a mystery here hallelujah now I believe just what represents Jesus the Holy Ghost and the rubyville represents the bride born in Babylon where did we all come from we came from confusion but we were called by this message into this blessed truth hallelujah and what is God doing God is building another temple this time it's a spiritual temple not a physical temple we read in the Bible where the glory of the second temple was glorious more glorious than the first but if you look at it historically you know the pomp and the greatness and the beauty of the second temple that was built was nothing in comparison to the first temple it was so small it was so simple compared to the first temple but why did the Bible say the glory of the second temple was more the second house was more glorious than the first you know why because the son of man Jesus Christ came came to that second temple not the first but the second temple God manifested in the flesh and he came in preached at that second temple hallelujah despised more glorious than the first oh my hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Matthew chapter 21 verse 42 to 44 jesus said unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it it's not by might nor by power but by the spirit saith the Lord this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof are we the nation and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but whomsoever it shall fall will be will be ground to powder we are the nation of God hallelujah not the denomination but God is building a nation hallelujah amen Zechariah chapter 3 verse 8 we read here now o Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wonder that for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch for behold a stone that I have laid before Joshua upon one stone shall seven eyes shall be seven eyes from the hope behold I will engrave the graving thereof said the Lord of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day in that day said the Lord of hosts ye shall shall every man be his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree the fig tree has always been Israel meaning God is setting up chapter setting up a kingdom a worldwide Kingdom and every nation on earth will be sitting under under this fig tree alleluia but when said in 6 fold purpose of Gabriel visit Daniel and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch that shall grow out of his roots and bedroom said who was that Christ even the branch is Christ there's no question about it out of his roots in adoption number four better than said this the whole heaven is named Jesus the whole church is named Jesus everything is named Jesus for it's the only name that God ever had he's called Jehovah Jehovah Jireh these are titles the Lord's provided sacrifice Jehovah Rapha the Lord that he'll be Jehovah the lord's banner Yoba manassas and Jehovah different Jehovah's he's called the Morningstar is called the father is the son is called the Holy Ghost is called the Alpha is called the Omega and he's called the beginning and is called the ending and then he is called the branch oh my oh he's called all kinds of titles but he only have one name and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and then he said it again planting the vine and were two planet the life of Christ is the branch the branch is not Branham Tabernacle I'd like to say it again the branch is not Branham Tabernacle branch is not William Branham the branch is whosoever will be plucked up out of your unbelief and planted and to him I thought he said it was Christ but there's a change here the branch is whosoever will be plucked out of your unbelief and planted into him he's talking about thee he's talking about you talking about the rubber Bell one that has been born in Babylon hallelujah but has been set free because of the word of truth that they've heard hallelujah not by might nor by power but by the holy spirit says the Lord oh my Joba jar everyone said this now to touch me it wouldn't make any difference I'm a man but to touch him then he's the Holy Spirit that's in there then he reacts back and uses human lips because he is divine we are the branches he does he doesn't bear fruit he only energizes the branch of Omaha I like that he is the vine we are the branches and the bank don't bear fruit it's the branches that bear fruit but where do we get the power the energy to be able to bear fruit from the source from the olive tree the main supplier of oil hallelujah that's Christ but if Adam expounded on Zechariah chapter 3 verse 8 and 9 we read it a while ago but let's see how what Berman says about it in the message the beach between the seven churches ages and the seals he quoted Zechariah chapter three verse 8 and 9 first he said here now all Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit with thee for they are men wonder dad for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch and then vermin said Christ for behold the stone that I will lay before Joshua upon stone one stone shall be seven eyes and seven eyes behold I will engrave the graving 's there on set the Lord of Hosts I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day Zechariah was saying on this foundational stone are seven eyes and then better bana said this the seven eyes he said I Smith see seeing means prophets seers this land had seven horns and on its horn had an i7 eyes what is it are you ready everyone said Christ and his bride hallelujah this is Christ and his bride I'm talking about Christ alone but Christ and his bride this is not just do the ruble alone is Jerusalem and Joshua together they're called the branch oh my don't you love him Christ and his bride he said seven Church ages out of there was seven prophets that went forth seven seers eyes so the last one must be a seer I believe that Bill Omaha bourbon not on the puppet two times as I said a seer hallelujah you see William Branham connects the rap foundation to the Lamb of God Revelation chapter 5 verse 6 it says and I beheld and lo in the midst of the tone and out of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it has been slain having what seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth from man hallelujah seven spirits but really is not saying that God is seven spirits hallelujah but these are seven portions of one Holy Spirit sent forth in every Church age into all the world hallelujah praise God in this church age we have all seven measures in this church age we have the fullness Alleluia so you see the connection now huh now let's talk about the vine and the branches the message investment but urban service the world is one thing to see Christ Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches and the branch bears record of the vine because it draws his energy in life from the vine well the first time the first bands that came from this vine they wrote a book of Acts behind advance we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in that first church and that church of Pentecost and and when he when we believe that it's the original vine if the original vine ever puts forth another branch they will write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life that is in the vine now you read the book of Acts again and it's see if there's an ending to it there's no definite ending to the book of Acts why because it is being written again hallelujah John 15 verse 5 I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing you can build your spiritual life however you want to but jesus said without me you can do nothing we talked about this the three stages of grace the three steps of grace justification sanctification baptisms only goes and then we went into adoption but if you think of it without Christ you can never be justified without the power of the Holy Ghost you can never be sanctified without the power of the Holy Ghost you can never receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit without me you can do nothing revelations 1:20 the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches Ages or the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven so we now understand the vision that was shown Sakurai amen without oil the lampstand can never give forth light without me the Lord said you can do nothing you know all pastors they want to do the best that they can to you know pitch the word and straighten the lives of the people hallelujah but in reality without God we could do nothing it's God that does the job hallelujah he's the Builder of the house the uniting the uniting time and sign that sound good but what have they done the Builder of the house was in there in a form of a lowly Galilean carpenter and they turned him down when God had vindicated him of being his messenger of the hour the branch he said and they turned him down they turned the branch down hallelujah and how he'll we be known God has provided a lamb I'm quoting this and how he will how will he be known how will we know him by his nature of adversary what he does his works he said I am the vine you are the branches now the branch bears the fruit not divine the vine just energizes the branch and if the branch ever bring forth a big sort of branch it it has grapes on it and the next vine comes out and the branch out of the vine will have grapes on it if the first church that have come out all of the back of the vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts if that ever really puts out another bands that will write another book of that behind it and that is what they had in the days of the Apostles and the Apostolic age never ended I believe that 100% you never did end hallelujah so now we understand why the spiritual temple surpasses the glory of the first and the second temple why because in John 14:27 a you shall know that I am in my father and ye are in me and I in you what does this mean perfect oneness kiss the word you are the word hallelujah amen why is it so glorious hallelujah the first temple the Shekinah glory came into it the second temple God that was made manifest in the flesh pricks into it what about the spiritual temple the bride of Jesus Christ even the bridegroom became one with a bride or Jesus side that's why it's so glorious hallelujah this is the culmination of it all Revelation chapter 21 verse 2 and for 2 to 4 and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven you know that's the bride amen that Mount the mountain that pushes out of the earth is our physical habitation amen but the inhabitants God saw them in Revelation 21 is that I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold what does it say the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people talk about oneness and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall any more there shall be more pain for the former things are passed away oh my lord hallelujah the second temple was more glorious and yet it too was destroyed 70 80 it was destroyed and burnt down by the Romans and the veil was rent but you know what the priest did is sewed the veil back together again and the people continued to worship God and it was called vain worship for ten thirty seven more years they worshiped God in that temple and God left already left the temple on the day of the day Christ died on the cross hallelujah God left the temple the mercy seat is not in that holy holy holy of Holy's anymore the mercy seat is hanging on the cross Alleluia and the mercy seat today is in the heart of the baby oh my glory to God no tada hallelujah I got some more slides here let me finish you don't mind the voice of design urban said now if the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God who I have proven by the Bible promised that he would return in the last days and reveal his self in the fullness of his spirit is that a promise this is the head coming to the body just like the church coming up like it comes from a human being all the way from the feet comes up through the thighs up to the head and the head is the head of the body and the body has come up ever since the first church come right on up in this in the reformations has come up till now it's gone through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now it's the head Christ coming to the body the body of Christ he's the one who knows my hand don't know how to act just by my head but he's the one who knows that's the reason he is the word and the head has now come to the body therefore the body can do nothing from what the head dictates hallelujah everyone said I am NOT the word I am a man but you see he uses this body because he died to sanctify this body I say amen to that that he might use it in start talking about just his body he's talking about the body of Christ is talking about the bride of Jesus guys it's something about you and me hallelujah that he might use it and and give a gift just like pulling it out of gear then the Holy Spirit takes over that's why we become one unit to the holy spirit how can we ever come against the will of the holy spirit if we have one unit with him hallelujah we become the word the Bible says not to be equally yoked together with unbelievers now if the Bible commands that then Jesus has to feel fulfilled that himself he cannot marry anything outside of the world he cannot marry a denominational Church hallelujah he can only marry the word he can only be one with the word Jesus had perfect faith perfect faith he said it he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you received the word so much I like that I like that I received the word dear you become the word as she received the word if you abide in me and my words in you my words with this word abides in you then ask what you will and it will be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believing but that what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it it will be given unto you time-space nothing ever will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with that's why we sing that song it's already done Alleluia the word coming to the body Jehovah Jireh said but remember the last thing is this divine presence the word itself he is the word the head the word it's coming to the body see and that word in Hebrews the fourth chapter said the Word of God is sharper more powerful than any two-edged sword and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now take that scripture and run it right back from the beginning of the prophets run it right on down through Jesus Christ and see if that isn't the same thing the same thing that is known as the Messiah now it's not some man that's the Messiah it's the Holy Spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is here now working in the flesh getting the body ready for the rupturing base believe it friends and then he said these final words the trial we started discerning some people and then after discerning their names and their illnesses and pronouncing them them healed he said this I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of a son of man in human flesh through the bride's body is that accept his call not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord Lloyd who got this Olsen amen amen we're just seeing a song he knew me the key of C I think what C okay please amen you can just help me sing in you me I believe he knew B before
