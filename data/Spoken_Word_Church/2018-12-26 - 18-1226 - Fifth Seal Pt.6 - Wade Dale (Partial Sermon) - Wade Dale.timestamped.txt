[0:00] when they're born when they go to school
[0:01] they study war then they go into
[0:05] military for two years so they're all
[0:06] military minded why because they're not
[0:09] like us with 300 something million
[0:10] people we got a big pool to choose from
[0:12] you know the United States
[0:14] they've got probably three and a half
[0:15] million to choose from them to fight the
[0:18] whole world but you know what
[0:21] when NIEM to profits get done and you
[0:24] get over in that last half of that week
[0:25] God's gonna fight for Israel because he
[0:27] said I will not forget them and I will
[0:30] fight for them and then that to give you
[0:34] an expected end then shall you call upon
[0:36] me and you shall go and pray unto me and
[0:37] I will hearken unto thee and you shall
[0:40] seek me and find me when you shall
[0:43] search for me with all your heart and I
[0:46] will be found of you
[0:51] it's not kind of what happened to me and
[0:53] you that kind of what happened to us we
[0:57] prayed to God and he found us and I will
[1:01] turn away your captivity and I will
[1:03] gather you from all the nations and from
[1:06] all the places whether I have driven you
[1:09] saith the Lord I will bring you again
[1:12] into the place which I caused you to be
[1:14] carried away captive in other words they
[1:17] were going into Babylon for 70 years
[1:21] they were going into Babylon for 70
[1:23] years from Jeremiah they were going into
[1:25] captivity Daniel was in that captivity
[1:28] during that time right he was in the
[1:33] 68th year of his captivity he knew by
[1:36] books Jeremiah he knew by the Prophet
[1:41] before him William Marion Branham so
[1:43] thank God sent it to send it to us and
[1:45] we look in what books we know by books
[1:49] this is fixing to happen we know by
[1:53] bullets the Bible is fixing to happen
[1:55] then brother Branham gave us clarity he
[1:57] was able to bring the mind of God to you
[2:01] and let God speak to you
[2:03] amen because you know if it's contrary
[2:07] to the word it's not God talking to you
[2:08] I mean we should be well enough adults
[2:11] to know even children adults to know
[2:13] that if you're told to do something
[2:15] contrary to the word it's not God
[2:17] it's the devil pretty simple and then
[2:21] the Bible says resist the devil and
[2:24] he'll flee from you he won't walk away
[2:27] from you he'll flee from you and how do
[2:31] you resist him just thing I love him or
[2:36] only believed to him every once in a
[2:37] while Satan can't stand that he'll just
[2:39] kind of move on out of the way amen when
[2:42] psy calls you be carried away so Daniels
[2:44] in there and he's wanting to know God we
[2:46] got two more years until we get out of
[2:49] here what's gonna happen to me and my
[2:52] people and remember what brother Browns
[2:55] dead brother Brown said God not only
[2:56] told him how many years will be left to
[2:59] him to leave he told him what was gonna
[3:01] happen all the way to the Millennium
[3:04] hey man Cody's fixing in Daniel 9:24
[3:07] right here well we're gonna read Romans
[3:09] first but in Daniel 9:24 he tells him
[3:14] exactly what's gonna happen the whole
[3:16] Gentile kingdom coming in and all that
[3:18] so let's read Romans 11 we read this
[3:20] last Sunday let's read it again
[3:22] because what's gonna happen I want to
[3:24] show you what this I've got so gracious
[3:26] to blind the eyes of them thou slow down
[3:31] a minute that will say then the branches
[3:33] were broken off that I might be grafted
[3:37] in he's talking about Israel Israel is
[3:40] an olive tree right okay well because of
[3:45] unbelief they were broken off look so
[3:51] this is still the tree like say this is
[3:54] still the tree here's the roots and
[3:57] here's the life going up through the
[3:58] tree and here's our lives all over the
[4:01] olive tree but they because of unbelief
[4:05] there was some branches broke off
[4:08] because of unbelief they were broken off
[4:11] and thou standest by faith talking about
[4:13] you and me he's talking to Gentiles be
[4:16] not high-minded but fear don't be
[4:18] high-minded their Lord God thought more
[4:20] me no listen if you want to get down to
[4:24] the brass tank look at what God did to
[4:27] his own children so you could come in he
[4:30] literally blinded his own children so
[4:34] you can have a chance
[4:35] so let's don't crow and say well then
[4:37] poor old dumb is realized they should
[4:39] know God did that you leave it alone God
[4:45] blinded his own children so that you
[4:46] could come in because what how many
[4:48] times did Jesus say I have found no
[4:50] greater faith in Israel when he come to
[4:51] a Gentile walking up right I found no
[4:54] greater faith in Israel what's he saying
[4:56] right here because of the unbelief of
[4:58] you Jews can I interpolate they were
[5:04] broken off and thou standest by faith
[5:05] but don't be high-minded but fear for if
[5:08] God spared not the natural branch in
[5:10] other words here's the natural tree
[5:13] God's the one that pulled those broke
[5:15] those branches off
[5:18] for if God spared not the natural branch
[5:21] take heed lest he also spare not thee
[5:24] because he didn't have to take that wild
[5:27] olive tree and put it down into this one
[5:29] right here he didn't have to do this
[5:32] right here but he did because of you and
[5:38] me he did that because of you sitting
[5:41] here tonight behold therefore the
[5:46] goodness and severity of God on them
[5:50] which fell severity in other words serve
[5:54] you but toward the goodness here if thou
[5:59] continue in his goodness oh the words
[6:03] that also shall be cut off whoa
[6:08] he said well I'm well there be careful
[6:12] and they also hoo watch and they also
[6:15] they the Jews if their body not still in
[6:18] unbelief shall be graffed it in for god
[6:20] is able to graff them in look at me
[6:22] again they still got to go a little bit
[6:27] farther we got a little bit more to go
[6:30] for if thou were cut out of the olive
[6:32] tree which is wild by nature and we're
[6:35] grafted contrary look to nature into a
[6:38] good olive tree we were grafted in right
[6:40] here we were grafted in right here
[6:45] they rolled up and I didn't we're mad
[6:48] for if thou wert cut off the olive tree
[6:51] which is wild by nature and we're
[6:52] grafted contrary to nature into a good
[6:54] olive tree how much more shall these
[6:56] which be the natural branch natural
[7:01] Israel be graft into their own olive
[7:04] tree because I'm fixing the region in
[7:06] the Bible the two prophets that go to
[7:09] Israel are called the two olive trees
[7:12] and then for I would not brethren that
[7:15] you should be ignorant of this mystery
[7:18] and it is a mystery lest you should be
[7:21] wise in your own conceits that blindness
[7:24] is part right here has happened to
[7:27] Israel until the fullness of the
[7:30] Gentiles be come in right here
[7:33] rapture right God cannot deal with the
[7:37] Jews in any part of restoration till
[7:39] we're on here and so all Israel shall be
[7:42] saved as it is written there shall come
[7:44] out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[7:46] away ungodliness from Jacob for this is
[7:49] my covenant unto them when I shall take
[7:51] away their sins amen not all rights amen
[7:59] now let's read Daniel so here we are
[8:07] seventy weeks are determined they're
[8:09] going to be in captivity for 70 weeks
[8:12] okay allegory okay parable okay because
[8:22] they were in captivity for 70 years way
[8:25] back several thousand years ago and came
[8:28] out of captivity built the city during
[8:30] all this they said they're gonna do
[8:31] except for the first part right cuz this
[8:35] is already being fulfilled right here
[8:38] right here
[8:44] this has it this hasn't been fulfilled
[8:48] go this is what this is the restoration
[8:50] of Israel all right this will happen in
[8:52] that last week but this right here has
[8:56] already happened we'll look at in just
[8:57] second all right there by okay with that
[9:02] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[9:04] and the city in Ezekiel 42 44 there's
[9:12] going to be a millennial city built a
[9:14] literal city but now there was a time
[9:18] when there was a commandment to build
[9:21] Jerusalem back during Cyrus's time which
[9:24] was in Ezra Nehemiah and all those ones
[9:27] back that way right buds that is from
[9:29] the Ezra naman all those right there was
[9:31] an edit went forth to bring people into
[9:33] Jerusalem to rebuild what the wall and
[9:35] the city and the temple alright so you
[9:42] got a look and see this is like brother
[9:45] Dale said this scripture still being
[9:48] written it's not been fulfilled all yet
[9:52] part of a house
[9:53] we're not Oliver house seventy weeks are
[9:55] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[9:57] holy city to do six things
[10:01] read the six fold purpose that six fold
[10:04] purpose is God purposely bringing Israel
[10:08] back just like we have six seals that
[10:12] brings us back to redemption under the
[10:14] Seventh Seal their seventh seal is Jesus
[10:17] Christ - who does the two witnesses
[10:21] preach to them Jesus Christ amen and
[10:26] who's going to walk in the Millenium and
[10:28] set King no not David the son of David
[10:34] which is Jesus Christ he's going to set
[10:37] and what bring all this into being but
[10:41] he's got to come back that's what I want
[10:43] to get into we got to come back into two
[10:44] prophets down here mm-hmm
[10:48] excuse me seventy weeks are determined
[10:51] upon thy people upon the holy city to do
[10:53] six things finish the transgression
[10:56] justification make an end of sins
[10:59] sanctification because they got to get
[11:02] born again just like you and to make
[11:04] reconciliation for iniquity three things
[11:10] and you know what when those Street
[11:13] things happen to you what does it do to
[11:18] you it brings in everlasting
[11:21] righteousness it sells out the vision
[11:24] and prophecy
[11:26] the word made flesh and anoint the most
[11:31] holy
[11:31] that's this guy right here and I don't
[11:34] mean me I mean your guy
[11:36] whoever you are so see what I mean it's
[11:41] an allegory to us but that's a literal
[11:43] happening to the Jews because what's
[11:44] going to happen is when the two
[11:46] witnesses step on the earth they're
[11:48] going to preach the finishing of the
[11:51] transgression of Israel they're going to
[11:53] make through Jesus Christ being revealed
[11:55] to them they're going to make an end of
[11:56] their sin they're going to make
[11:57] reconciliation for their iniquity
[11:59] they're going to bring in everlasting
[12:00] righteousness seal up division property
[12:02] in north the most holy hallelujah
[12:08] that's exactly what's gonna happen he's
[12:11] already done that to you God's waiting
[12:14] on ice to get out of the way so you do
[12:16] it to them know therefore and understand
[12:19] that from the going forth of the
[12:21] commandment to restore and build
[12:22] Jerusalem until my side the Prince shall
[12:25] be seven weeks that's right here we
[12:27] already went through this whole thing
[12:29] many many times so you should be okay
[12:32] with this all right all right
[12:34] and threescore is what three times - at
[12:40] 62 we've 62 I mean 62 and 769
[12:49] to where after three segments the street
[12:54] shall be built again the walls even
[12:56] troubles time now that was done all in
[12:57] here amen and after threescore and two
[13:01] weeks shall Messiah be cut off when was
[13:03] he cut off at Calvary
[13:05] well they said let his blood be on us
[13:07] and our children the Gentiles had not
[13:10] begun that was your sixty-nine weeks are
[13:13] finished not halves it's not in the
[13:18] Bible
[13:20] seven weeks and threescore and two weeks
[13:22] weeks it'll be built again the walls
[13:24] even troubles times mm-hmm and after
[13:26] threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
[13:27] be cut off but not for himself what
[13:29] would you cut off for you in Israel you
[13:32] and Israel thought he's gonna save us
[13:35] and he's gonna save them and the people
[13:38] of the prince that shall come who is
[13:40] that Prince Titus Titus was a Roman
[13:45] general comes in eighty seventy right
[13:47] here and destroys what they built Jesus
[13:55] told him in Matthew 24 don't get caught
[13:56] in that city right because what happened
[14:01] was they got in there and they put a
[14:02] siege around the city and they waited
[14:04] for them to just run out of food and
[14:06] they eat the bark off the trees and then
[14:07] they started eating their children then
[14:10] when they finally got in there they
[14:12] killed every person in the city there
[14:15] shall be with the end shall be with a
[14:16] flood and to the end of war desolations
[14:19] are determined how many wars has Israel
[14:23] had in these two thousand years you
[14:27] can't count them
[14:30] war here war there war here war there
[14:34] the Six Day War was just maybe back in
[14:37] some of y'all's time some of your older
[14:39] ones remember the Six Day War in the 60s
[14:41] one nine nineteen sixties something nine
[14:43] someone sixty-seven okay that was the
[14:46] Six Day War a miracle
[14:50] have you heard Gershon Salomon tell
[14:53] about that because he was the general
[14:54] and during that time remember he was
[14:57] supposed to being killed run over by
[14:59] tank and everything else he said he said
[15:02] I don't remember they were getting ready
[15:03] to assassinate him they had surrounded
[15:05] him he was getting ready to shoot him
[15:06] and said he looked up and they all took
[15:08] off running and they were interviewed
[15:10] later and said well there was whatever
[15:12] whatever what company was coming and he
[15:16] said they wasn't a company nowhere
[15:17] around me God give him a strong delusion
[15:20] that they should believe a lie and be
[15:24] damned by a man same way with me and you
[15:28] Elijah was standing one day with the
[15:29] guys and guys I said we're in trouble
[15:32] why sure he's more for us than they are
[15:34] more for them they aren't from us in
[15:36] other words that's what he said because
[15:37] he was counting all them people and why
[15:39] she just looked over him said that's
[15:41] more for us and the license going
[15:44] there's more for us then or them engage
[15:46] that's going one two one two one two how
[15:50] are we gonna do this he said Lord open
[15:52] my servants eyes and he said there was a
[15:55] chair he said there was chariots of fire
[15:57] all wear around that prophet and Gotha
[16:00] same way with you and I maybe for
[16:01] whatever look in that dimension sometime
[16:03] we'll see him around me and you amen
[16:06] alright so he was cut off let his blood
[16:09] be on us in our children that's where
[16:11] they did their great sin will read that
[16:13] next Sunday where the Prophet talks
[16:14] about it and God quit dealing with them
[16:16] as a nation do you hear me cuz that's
[16:19] important God will deal with an Israel
[16:22] with Israel as an individual because 120
[16:24] in the upper room were Jews but this is
[16:27] a Gentile dispensation he will not save
[16:31] Israel as a nation until we leave I'll
[16:34] read it to you just a second everybody
[16:36] all right are we following along okay
[16:38] and after threescore and two weeks shall
[16:41] Messiah be cut off but not for himself
[16:44] people oppress your that should
[16:45] come he'll draw us destroy the city and
[16:47] the sanctuary because see have you ever
[16:49] thought about this when you look at the
[16:53] the mural that they painted when Titus
[16:56] was leaving Jerusalem
[16:57] now Titus was a Roman general think
[17:00] about this because this is gonna hook to
[17:02] this covenant we're fixing to talk about
[17:04] if Israel knows they've got to have all
[17:08] their little pieces to build their ark
[17:11] to start doing their sacrifices for
[17:15] their red heifer and for all the things
[17:16] they got to do they got to have the Ark
[17:18] of the Covenant they got to have the
[17:20] menorah they got to have all these
[17:22] things if you're looking going your
[17:25] history Google Titus it shows there's a
[17:28] mural painting or an etching in stone
[17:31] them disassembling the Ark disassembling
[17:35] the menorah and you see it on their back
[17:37] and they're leaving of it Israel well
[17:39] where do you think those pieces are now
[17:41] they're in the Vatican they're in the
[17:46] Vatican Israel knows that so there's
[17:50] gonna be a covenant name mm-hmm Titus
[17:56] was a Roman general he didn't take it to
[17:57] the United States when he got finished
[17:58] with it no he took the booty that called
[18:01] booty or the bounty they took it back to
[18:03] Rome they took it to Rome and they
[18:09] didn't put it in a warehouse they took
[18:12] you to the Vatican and said here Pope I
[18:14] get ten thousand virgins now you know
[18:18] still what I mean when I die when I go
[18:20] to heaven I get up no okay but you know
[18:23] what Pope said just put it down there
[18:26] and put it down there in the closet and
[18:28] shut the door and we'll need this later
[18:31] right
[18:32] so for 2,000 years they've had every
[18:35] piece Israel needs and you don't think
[18:36] Israel knows that sure they know that
[18:39] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[18:42] many for one week now who is that he
[18:44] because that he breaks the covenant that
[18:47] cannot be Christ that cannot be God that
[18:51] he is the Antichrist now when he makes
[18:55] that coven
[18:56] when the Jews are we here brother
[19:00] Brennan said if you see that covenant
[19:02] made with the Jews you've missed the
[19:04] rapture so look so where do we go we're
[19:08] gone the Covenant is made for one week
[19:14] read that right so there's one week left
[19:19] after the rapture I don't care what any
[19:21] high-minded preacher says the Bible says
[19:24] there's only one week there's one week
[19:25] left after the rapture people just don't
[19:27] get what brother Byrne was talking about
[19:28] and then because it is a mystery and in
[19:32] the midst of the week what's the middle
[19:33] of seven but now remember that's thirty
[19:39] days to a calendar month not 31 we're on
[19:43] the prophetic calendar so it's 1260 days
[19:47] they shall prophesy for 1260 days in the
[19:52] midst of the week he shall cause the
[19:54] sacrifice and oblation to cease brother
[19:57] Daniel you know what he's going to do
[19:59] for three and a half years he's gonna
[20:01] let Israel think there let their Messiah
[20:03] coming back so because they're giving
[20:05] he's giving them the ark he's giving
[20:07] them the menorah he's given this he's
[20:09] giving them that but when they get all
[20:11] that built and get it all put together
[20:12] guess what's gonna happen the Pope is
[20:16] gonna walk in that temple and for one he
[20:19] just desecrated it because he's not a
[20:21] Jew he walks in there and he says y'all
[20:24] don't need to be doing this no more I'm
[20:26] God
[20:28] talk about being mad they gonna be ill
[20:33] so that's what he's gonna do
[20:35] he shall cause the sacrifice where do
[20:38] they make sacrifices in the temple and
[20:40] the oblation to cease our offering to
[20:42] cease for the overspreading of
[20:44] abominations he shall make it desolate
[20:46] even unto the consummation and that
[20:49] determined shall be poured out upon the
[20:53] desolate everybody got that say man all
[20:55] right so they'll covenant of 1260 day
[20:58] coven I mean a one-week covenant and in
[21:01] the midst of that covenant it will be
[21:03] broke in the midst of the week he shall
[21:06] cause now what's going to happen right
[21:09] here this is what we need to get to
[21:10] tonight what's gonna happen around here
[21:13] when we leave God's going to come and
[21:18] anoint to preach to people with the
[21:22] larger anointing and Moses anointing and
[21:25] send them to the Jews and when I say
[21:27] send them that don't MIT then that can't
[21:29] be Americans they gonna be Jews all
[21:35] right
[21:35] so don't think don't think here don't
[21:39] think me or you were going over there
[21:40] we're gonna be at the marriage supper
[21:42] waiting on all this to happen that all
[21:44] right okay so now let's go to
[21:47] revelations 11 that was given me a reed
[21:52] like unto a rod and the angel stood
[21:54] saying rise and measure the temple of
[21:56] God in the altar and then that worship
[21:59] therein you read that
[22:03] I'll just discuss that just a second ago
[22:05] but the court which is without the
[22:07] temple leave out and measure it not for
[22:09] it is given unto the Gentiles the
[22:11] Gentiles has always been able to come
[22:13] into the very outer part they just can't
[22:15] go in they just can't go in the Holy
[22:18] City shall they tread under foot forty
[22:21] and two months
[22:26] how much is forty two months three and a
[22:30] half years all right forty-two months
[22:33] count them forty-two months three
[22:37] twelves is 36 and then high that's 42 so
[22:40] there's your three and a half years are
[22:41] you twelve hundred days and I will give
[22:43] power unto my two witnesses and they
[22:45] shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
[22:48] and threescore which is sixty days
[22:50] twelve hundred and sixty days clothed in
[22:54] sackcloth now what do they do they
[22:56] preach Jesus Christ to that Orthodox Jew
[23:01] group over there that's looking for the
[23:03] Messiah to come cuz I'm going to give
[23:06] you a little secret
[23:09] them to profits after twelve hundred and
[23:11] sixty days they're not gonna be killed
[23:13] by the SEAL Team six they're gonna be
[23:18] killed by the Mossad cuz look people
[23:23] America don't care what goes on over
[23:24] there really don't care what goes on
[23:27] over there sure we're protecting Israel
[23:30] because we have an interest and I will
[23:35] get power to my two witnesses and they
[23:36] shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
[23:37] threescore days clothed in sackcloth
[23:38] these are the two olive trees what are
[23:41] we just talking about God's fixing to
[23:43] put them to good branch's back in there
[23:47] these are the two olive trees and the
[23:49] two candlesticks standing before the god
[23:51] of the earth and if any man will hurt
[23:52] them and I see that's why this is the
[23:54] tie this will come back to on the sixth
[23:56] seal this is what we'll read because
[23:58] this is the opening of the sixth seal
[24:00] brother branham said the two prophets
[24:02] are that six seal all right whatever
[24:04] they call that's what's going to happen
[24:06] if any man will hurt them fire
[24:07] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[24:08] devoureth their enemy now that's not
[24:11] going to be they're not gonna be flame
[24:13] throwers kids and adults it's the word
[24:19] whatever they say that's what's gonna
[24:21] happen
[24:22] that's why I'm telling you when you and
[24:24] I when that sixth seal breaks to me and
[24:25] you people
[24:31] that's you speaking to her and nobody
[24:34] can stand before it and if any man will
[24:37] hurt them fire proceedeth out of their
[24:38] mouth and devoureth their enemies and if
[24:40] any man will hurt them he must be in
[24:42] this manner be killed these have power
[24:44] to shut heaven that it rain not in the
[24:46] days of their prophecy Elijah and have
[24:48] power over waters to turn into blood
[24:50] Moses and to smite the earth with all
[24:52] plagues as often as they will and when
[24:54] they shall have finished their testimony
[24:56] what how many days do they prophesy 1260
[25:01] that's 42 months not over here right
[25:09] here and when they shall finish their
[25:13] testimony what is their testimony let me
[25:16] read you their testimony to finish the
[25:18] transgression to make an end of sin and
[25:20] to make reconciliation for iniquity
[25:24] now you can't say bring in everlasting
[25:26] righteousness because they don't Battle
[25:29] of Armageddon happens after that
[25:30] that's why there's got to be three and a
[25:33] half more years left of earthly time not
[25:37] ministry and not tribulation there's
[25:41] only three and a half years of
[25:42] tribulation it starts here and works its
[25:45] way there but right here's gonna be a
[25:47] battle of Armageddon and who knows
[25:51] what's gonna happen over here all heck's
[25:53] gonna break loose
[25:54] you got an atomic explosion it don't
[25:56] kill everybody in one minute you got
[25:59] nuclear fallout you got people dying
[26:01] because they can't get food it may take
[26:03] three years for this planet to
[26:05] completely Dahl hello think but it's
[26:12] gotta end here that 69 plus one makes
[26:17] what 70 and that ends the captivity of
[26:23] Israel
[26:27] so the two prophets preached finishing
[26:30] the transgression and make them into sin
[26:32] make reconciliation for iniquity they
[26:35] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:37] and when they shall have finished their
[26:40] testimony in other words when 144,000
[26:44] men receive the baptism of Holy Ghost
[26:48] 12,000 from this tribe 12 from this 12
[26:51] from this 12 from 12 tribes mm-hmm
[26:54] when they finish their testimony the
[26:56] Beast that ascends out of the bottomless
[26:58] pit shall make war against them and
[26:59] shall overcome them and kill them you
[27:01] know what listen to me this will help
[27:04] you Jesus had a three and a half year
[27:07] ministry while he was on this earth on
[27:11] the River Jordan that anointing came
[27:13] down not to make him God please people
[27:16] the Bible said he was born Emmanuel God
[27:19] with us I don't need nobody tell me no
[27:21] never
[27:24] but when he comes to the River Jordan at
[27:26] 30 years old
[27:27] Bible said becoming 30 he received an
[27:31] anointing for a three-and-a-half-year
[27:32] message that he couldn't die during that
[27:35] time because when he came to the Garden
[27:39] of Gethsemane the spirit left him so he
[27:43] could die you see that same spirit when
[27:52] they finished their three and a half
[27:53] year ministry because don't you think
[27:59] that for three and a half years of them
[28:01] calling plagues on this whole world not
[28:03] just Israel they're calling plagues on
[28:06] the whole world don't you think the
[28:08] mossad is gonna want to kill them about
[28:10] the first week they're in business but
[28:13] for three and a half years they got a
[28:15] message by the way just like Jesus said
[28:18] repent and be baptized in the name of
[28:21] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[28:24] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[28:26] the Holy Ghost but when they finish the
[28:29] 144,000 they finished that 1260 day
[28:31] prophecy that anointing is gonna lift
[28:34] off them they're gonna be killed and
[28:36] they're not gonna be killed by Americans
[28:38] or Russians they're gonna be killed by
[28:41] Israelis but you know why because those
[28:43] 144,000 are going to go to those Jews
[28:46] that are trying to put the temple
[28:47] together trying to get the red heifer
[28:49] they're trying to get this they're
[28:50] trying to get this why cuz they think
[28:51] the Messiah's coming 144,000 in the two
[28:55] witnesses are going you missed him two
[28:57] thousand years ago and they're gonna go
[29:01] know we've been two thousand years
[29:03] trying to get this moment here and
[29:04] you're telling us it's worthless and you
[29:07] know what if I was there which I won't
[29:09] be but if I was there I'd walk away
[29:10] about that 1250 ninth day and I'd say
[29:13] we're fixing to leave this place and
[29:15] that man y'all think a lot of called the
[29:19] Pope he's gonna desecrate your temple in
[29:21] about 3:00 in about a hit about another
[29:22] year he's gonna come and desecrate your
[29:24] temple cuz that's what's gonna happen
[29:25] then that's going to make the Jews mad
[29:27] then they're just gonna start pushing
[29:28] buttons we've heard of the Samson effect
[29:32] remember what's the assassin effect
[29:34] Sampson pulled the pillars down and
[29:36] destroyed himself but he too
[29:38] 3000 with him same way with Israel
[29:41] they're gonna start punching buttons
[29:42] well if we're gonna die your or die it's
[29:47] wonderful when you see the pieces of the
[29:48] puzzle fit together it really is you
[29:52] know why because it takes the fear out
[29:53] of all of us that takes fairway from me
[29:56] wondering what's gonna happen hey man
[29:59] and when their dead bodies shall lie in
[30:01] the street of the great city which
[30:02] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt we're
[30:04] all Lord was crucified and they have the
[30:06] people the kindred tongue the nation
[30:07] shall sin see their dead bodies CNN Fox
[30:11] News whatever you want to call it three
[30:14] days and a half we go back to that three
[30:16] and a half and shall not suffer their
[30:18] dead bodies to be put in the grave well
[30:20] you know what about three and a half
[30:21] days in that hot Sun guess what's going
[30:22] to happen
[30:25] right and the cameras are gonna be on
[30:29] think about it all the cameras and all
[30:31] the people are going to be going these
[30:32] are the ones that tormented us and now
[30:35] they're dead and they're gonna what
[30:36] rejoice make merry and sin gives it's
[30:41] gonna be a real temporary real temporary
[30:44] okay cuz they didn't put them in the
[30:47] grave in other words they're desecrating
[30:48] them like you wouldn't believe and shall
[30:50] send gifts one to another because these
[30:55] two prophets tormented them that dwelt
[30:57] on the earth not just Jews or old the
[31:01] whole world and after three days and a
[31:03] half the spirit of life from God entered
[31:05] into them and they stood upon their feet
[31:07] what a revelation that's gonna be to the
[31:10] world I I don't know I wouldn't want to
[31:13] be able to see it but I want to I'd like
[31:15] to see the reporters face when he turns
[31:16] around of looks and him two people are
[31:18] standing up and great fear fell upon
[31:22] them which saw them and they heard a
[31:23] great voice from heaven saying unto them
[31:25] come up hither and they ascended up to
[31:27] heaven in a cloud and their enemies
[31:29] beheld them that's what we're looking at
[31:33] now let's to go to Zechariah 12 we'll be
[31:37] done right here this is the restoration
[31:40] I will pour upon the house of David and
[31:43] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[31:46] spirit of grace and of supplication and
[31:49] they shall look upon me whom they have
[31:51] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[31:54] one mourning for his own son and shall
[31:57] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[31:59] in bitterness first firstborn this is
[32:01] when the two prophets are revealing
[32:02] Jesus Christ to the Jews in that day
[32:05] there shall be a great mourning in
[32:07] Jerusalem as the mourning of hide
[32:08] Romanian none in the valley of Megiddo
[32:11] which is the valley of armageddon and
[32:14] the land shall mourn every family apart
[32:17] the family of the house of David apart
[32:19] their wives apart the family of the
[32:21] house and that you know why they're
[32:22] doing this it's being revealed to them
[32:25] that they're the ones that killed the
[32:26] Messiah so they're in fear but all the
[32:31] two prophets you're going to say fear
[32:33] not
[32:34] fear not God did all this to bring a
[32:37] Gentile bride in and now we're bringing
[32:39] you this message in this raising you
[32:41] right Becca now not to not to not to
[32:44] brideship
[32:45] but to be servants and remnant their
[32:49] wives apart the family of the house of
[32:51] Nathan apart and their wives apart the
[32:52] family of the house of Levi apart and
[32:54] their wives apart the family of Shammai
[32:57] apart in their wives apart all the
[32:58] families that remain ever family apart
[33:01] and their wives apart is that grow out
[33:03] thirteen verse one is to continue
[33:04] reading and that day there shall be a
[33:07] fountain open to the house of David and
[33:09] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin
[33:11] and uncleanness and it shall come to
[33:13] pass in that day saith the Lord of Hosts
[33:15] that I will cut off the names of the
[33:17] idols out of the land and they shall no
[33:20] more be remembered and also I will cause
[33:23] the prophets than the unclean spirit to
[33:25] pass out of the land
[33:28] Zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say
[33:32] unto Him what are these wounds in on
[33:34] hands they preach jesus christ so real
[33:37] to those people here's the question now
[33:40] we know Jesus does not physically come
[33:43] to them that's the same way with you now
[33:46] we need we are we're trying our best to
[33:49] preach Jesus Christ so real so that you
[33:51] see him
[33:54] not over here somewhere in here well
[34:00] that makes you a second person if he's
[34:02] over here then he shall answer those
[34:07] with which I was wounded in the house of
[34:10] my friends awake o sword against my
[34:13] shepherd and against the man that is my
[34:15] fellow says the Lord of Hosts smite the
[34:17] Shepherd and the Sheep shall be
[34:18] scattered and I will turn my hand upon
[34:22] the little ones brother branham said
[34:25] that little ones means the Benjamin
[34:28] group because he was the baby of all the
[34:31] children of Israel him Israel Jacob he
[34:36] was the baby and that type to the
[34:39] 144,000 so that's telling you right
[34:41] there I will turn my hand upon the
[34:44] 144,000 and bring them up and bring them
[34:49] where cuz look folks please this
[34:53] millennium is 1,000 years it's not for
[34:57] us so for us it's not ours we have no
[35:04] claim on the millennium we have no claim
[35:06] on son of David we're there as a guest
[35:11] where there is a guest we're there on a
[35:14] honeymoon we've already been married we
[35:16] got a glorified body we don't eat at the
[35:18] wedding supper we don't come back
[35:20] we don't walked into the temple - what
[35:22] to do that last thing of that 6-volt
[35:24] purpose to anoint the most holy where
[35:26] brother adam said that was the bride
[35:28] walking into the temple you and I will
[35:30] be the anointing to that temple in the
[35:33] Millennium right here
[35:37] when that 70 weeks is over their
[35:40] captivity is finished and they're going
[35:42] to finally have that thousand years of
[35:45] rest that'll be there do you believe
[35:48] that they have never ever had that's
[35:52] their rest for what the land and the
[35:55] people you and I are there on a
[35:56] honeymoon we're just there why weren't
[36:00] look folks this is still the sole
[36:02] seventh day
[36:04] that's not eternity you cannot become
[36:09] eternal right here we get our eighth day
[36:12] right here why do we need an eighth day
[36:15] back in a seven that's going backwards
[36:18] but they need a seventh day they need a
[36:22] cleansing they need a walk to a thousand
[36:25] years to where God said you're gonna be
[36:27] my people and I'm gonna be your God
[36:30] David is gonna sit on that throne like
[36:33] you've always wanted and you're gonna
[36:35] come into this temple not to make
[36:37] sacrifices no there won't be physical
[36:40] sacrifices in the Millennium but

[36:43] show them justification sanctification
[36:46] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's
[36:49] stand to our feet know that millennium
[36:55] is not to us we get to enjoy it but

[37:05] demons he's still there lurking in the
[37:09] shadows can't work but now right here at
[37:11] the end before the Battle of Gog and
[37:13] Magog that's a white throne judgment

[37:35] where God blinded their eyes right here
[37:38] and did not deal with them as a nation
