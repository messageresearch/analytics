[7:59] hospital hospital so remember her that
[8:01] the Lord would would be with her and
[8:03] touch her if you like turning your
[8:06] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[8:07] in Revelations 1 12-15 and then we'll go
[8:12] to John 3 and uh do so remember these
[8:18] announcements uh I think I got
[8:20] everything I try to write them on S a
[8:21] note to where I can remember Heavenly

[8:56] Brother Gary touch him Lord and all of
[8:59] the the things that we have need of we
[9:01] love you and we thank you you have your
[9:03] way in the service in Jesus name
[9:07] amen
[9:08] Revelations 1
[9:12] 12-15 and I turned to see the voice that
[9:15] spake with me and being turned I saw
[9:17] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[9:20] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[9:22] unto the son of man clothed with a
[9:24] garment down to the foot and G about the
[9:25] PS with a golden girdle his head and his
[9:28] hairs were white like wool as white as
[9:31] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[9:33] fire and his feet like undefined brce as
[9:37] they had as if they burned in a
[9:41] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[9:44] many Waters one of these days we'll get
[9:47] back to that scripture but we're gaining
[9:50] ground anyway so now we'll go to John 3
[9:53] very familiar scripture with all of us
[9:56] says there was a man of the Pharisees
[9:58] named NC emus a ruler of the Jews the
[10:01] same came to Jesus by night and said
[10:03] unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a
[10:05] teacher come from God for no man can do
[10:08] these Miracles that thou doest except
[10:10] God be with him now remember we
[10:12] emphasized that he gave him a great
[10:15] honor he gave him a great uh position in
[10:21] things no man can do these things but
[10:23] then what did Jesus say he didn't jump
[10:25] out bragging on him and all kind of
[10:27] things what did he say to a most
[10:30] religious man that you could think
[10:32] of a great great man what did he say
[10:35] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[10:38] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[10:40] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[10:42] God Nicodemus said unto him how can a
[10:45] man be born when he is old can he enter
[10:48] the second time into his mother's womb
[10:50] and be born Jesus answered verily verily
[10:53] I say unto thee except a man be born of
[10:56] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[10:58] into the the kingdom of God that which
[11:01] is born to the flesh is flesh and that
[11:03] which is born to the spirit is Spirit
[11:06] Marvel not that I said unto thee you
[11:09] must be born again let's stop right
[11:12] there we won't go into 10 this you may
[11:15] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[11:16] the reading of the
[11:19] word
[11:21] now we have been trying
[11:24] to get a
[11:26] lot you know there the point and talks
[11:29] of what we're talking
[11:30] about and for the past few Services
[11:33] we've been talking
[11:35] about uh you know the point of
[11:39] saying Nicodemus when he he couldn't
[11:43] understand what Jesus was saying which
[11:47] was simple plain language and especially
[11:50] to
[11:51] us that are over on this
[11:55] side we can look back and say well look
[11:59] like Nicodemus could have understood
[12:01] right you know Jesus was just telling
[12:04] him he needed to be born again but
[12:06] remember nobody had ever taught up to
[12:09] this
[12:10] stage about a new birth there was no
[12:14] teachings of of them back there telling
[12:16] them that they needed to be these things
[12:18] uh they were taught that they were saved
[12:20] by following the law that's right they
[12:23] thought they were right in the
[12:24] sacrifices and the doings and and and
[12:27] then see because Jesus recognize he
[12:29] recognized Jesus as a teacher and you go
[12:31] on down through the reading and Jesus
[12:34] recognizes him as a teacher instead of
[12:36] teacher now like you are in Israel and
[12:39] don't know these
[12:42] things because see they were under the
[12:44] carnal application of their own mind and
[12:47] thinking trying to figure it out
[12:49] remember that hey there's Sister Mary
[12:52] good see you amen amen good for her to
[12:55] be with us
[12:57] today am and see in doing what he was
[13:01] doing then he
[13:04] was Jesus was trying to tell him what he
[13:07] needed to do not in the basis of some
[13:11] religious act or doings because as we
[13:15] said Nicodemus would have been glad to
[13:17] have got up and done any of those things
[13:19] that he would say but when he said you
[13:22] must be born again to a man that thought
[13:27] by being an Israelite a Jew as we would
[13:29] call it and being you know in the
[13:33] lineage and especially being as he was a
[13:36] uh a great teacher the teacher in Israel
[13:40] all right and doing that
[13:42] then it it looks like it's kind of an
[13:45] embarrassing thing to
[13:48] say when Jesus would say you you must be
[13:51] born
[13:52] again but remember we read there where
[13:55] the Prophet was explaining it the other
[13:57] week about it that
[13:59] really Jesus was saying to
[14:02] Nicodemus Nicodemus if You' have just
[14:05] stayed away from this fing tradition
[14:08] right that's it following the the elders
[14:11] and the
[14:14] things said you ought have known that I
[14:17] was going to have to come because it was
[14:20] promised in the word of the Messiah to
[14:23] come and said you order known then if
[14:26] you're recognizing me to be something of
[14:29] saying we know that God is with you
[14:33] because no man can do the things you are
[14:35] doing unless God is with him all right
[14:38] see then he he he he should have by
[14:42] making that statement he should have as
[14:44] quick as Jesus see we read it here and
[14:47] we read just a a a concept or a thought
[14:51] that's been put into uh the writing and
[14:54] see it may have been 30 minutes or an
[14:56] hour that they were talking not a a
[14:58] 15minute
[15:00] conversation just come in and he sits
[15:02] down and Jesus look at you need to be
[15:03] born
[15:04] again no he would probably had went
[15:07] through a lot of things maybe they ate
[15:10] together that evening maybe they sat
[15:12] around and discussed a lot of the
[15:13] scriptures and the things you know and
[15:16] then it kind of come on around into a
[15:18] position you know to where that they
[15:21] would talk of this and Jesus said you
[15:23] must be born
[15:24] again and Nicodemus you know he'd say
[15:26] it's like we would say now we're over
[15:29] here as I said looking
[15:31] back but he was looking at it he was
[15:34] saying you mean I I need to go back to
[15:37] my mother's W and come forth
[15:40] again and Jesus said no that wouldn't do
[15:43] you no good cuz it didn't do you any
[15:45] good the first time you came wrong all
[15:49] right now into doing that
[15:54] then he was saying to him there's
[15:58] something that you don't
[16:00] know that you need to
[16:03] do and you need to sit down and listen
[16:05] for a little while but a man goes
[16:09] away
[16:11] wondering what does it mean right Jesus
[16:14] went on to say now that he's just got to
[16:16] be born of water and a
[16:20] spirit maybe he told him now Nicodemus
[16:23] you know what the natural birth
[16:26] is you know the natur birth that you
[16:29] came from your mother came with a
[16:31] three-part thing as to the water
[16:36] breaking then the blood coming
[16:38] forth and then the baby coming
[16:42] forth see then he was putting it in
[16:45] language to him that he would probably
[16:48] understand some things but yet you
[16:51] cannot understand the kingdom of God
[16:53] without being born again I don't care
[16:56] how much knowledge you have of it
[16:59] I don't care how much you've read about
[17:00] it how much you know about it
[17:03] intellectually but until you're born
[17:05] again you cannot follow that line
[17:08] because it takes the spirit of God to
[17:10] reveal that so here is a man that is the
[17:13] greatest religious guy you could think
[17:15] of but yet he's in an unregenerated
[17:18] State why because there was no way back
[17:21] there that you could be born
[17:23] again cuz Jesus Christ did not come and
[17:26] died that's what he would be saying to
[17:28] Nicodemus you know the scriptures of
[17:31] what the Messiah must do right he must
[17:36] come he must die he must give his life
[17:39] to let that life come back upon you to
[17:42] where that you could have eternal life
[17:45] all right but see like I said we look
[17:48] back at it because we've had 2,000 years
[17:51] to talk about this and we'd say well all
[17:54] Nicodemus had to do was
[17:57] believe you know or believe on the Lord
[17:59] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved all
[18:01] right that
[18:03] scripture but how can you
[18:06] believe without an inside teacher
[18:10] right you believe intellectually you
[18:13] believe
[18:14] knowledge we're going to get to some of
[18:15] these things in the later messages as we
[18:18] precede a little but yet you can have
[18:20] every bit of that knowledge and still
[18:21] not be born again amen
[18:26] right but you see we we talk about said
[18:28] well we know we're born again and like I
[18:31] said we we good old Baptists we'd say we
[18:34] we know we're born again because it come
[18:35] on De
[18:37] Pentecost well what's that got to do
[18:39] with
[18:41] it I wasn't there on the day of
[18:47] Pentecost so there's no need of me
[18:49] talking about what happened there I need
[18:51] to talk about what's happening now see
[18:54] it's a different situation in doing that
[18:57] so it's not not that we just say well
[18:59] the poor old guy he just all he had to
[19:01] do is believe he credits Jesus as I've
[19:04] said over and over he credits him with
[19:07] being coming from God he come to hear
[19:11] him he believed in him that
[19:15] much and in doing that then let's get
[19:18] away from that carnal part of just
[19:20] thinking well it's all you got to do is
[19:23] believe yeah right well that's a good
[19:26] starting point right but that's all it
[19:29] is to believe is a good starting point
[19:32] then ask God to Quicken that that you
[19:34] believe that's right to make that alive
[19:36] into your soul to where that you can
[19:40] understand all
[19:42] right now we went through and we we
[19:45] taught a message there the other week on
[19:46] what why must you be born again
[19:50] right you know it it would probably been
[19:53] hard to explain to
[19:55] Nicodemus that he needed to be born
[19:57] again even today it'd be hard to explain
[20:00] to him well because like I said here he
[20:03] is he's done everything he's kept the
[20:05] laws he's leing it to the
[20:08] letter and you tell him he needs to be
[20:10] born
[20:11] again and he say well what do I need to
[20:13] do you know why must I be born
[20:17] again and he said Nicodemus you was born
[20:21] wrong well I can show you my lineage I
[20:25] can show you everything I can show you
[20:28] my life and everything is
[20:30] right but that still didn't solve the
[20:36] problem see brother brandom on black on
[20:38] birth pains he said it was hard to get
[20:40] those Pharisees to realize they was
[20:45] lost well after 2,000 years it's hard to
[20:49] get people to realize that they're
[20:53] lost to where God can do something about
[20:56] it that's right because see we've been
[20:59] pumped and trained and and everything
[21:02] else to try to make a public confessions
[21:05] and doing even living right and thing
[21:07] that's
[21:08] good but have we been born
[21:12] again all
[21:14] right see we were born in sin shapen in
[21:19] iniquity and espoused from our mother's
[21:22] wound to going forth a
[21:24] liar amen right that's the reason we
[21:27] need to be born again
[21:28] was born lost yes all right Ephesians
[21:31] 2:1 says who were dead in trespasses and
[21:36] sin that's who we are Ephesians 2:5 says
[21:41] even when we were dead in
[21:45] sin so then we were born no matter what
[21:48] you think you were alive but as far as
[21:51] spiritual things you were born dead
[21:54] right and that's why Jesus said you
[21:57] cannot not understand the kingdom you
[22:01] cannot see the
[22:03] kingdom see that's a word to us we say
[22:06] well do you understand do you see
[22:10] that and see that's what Jesus was
[22:12] trying to get to man to see all right
[22:15] and seeing that we were born that
[22:18] way then because of that first birth
[22:22] being
[22:24] wrong what good would it do to his
[22:27] Nicodemus said for me to go back to my
[22:29] mother and be born
[22:32] again what good would it do it wouldn't
[22:35] do any
[22:36] good why because you're born wrong to
[22:39] start with you born a second time you
[22:40] just be born wrong
[22:42] again yeah but I can prove my Mom and
[22:45] Daddy was married my that ain't what I'm
[22:47] talking
[22:48] about
[22:50] amen we were
[22:52] born as the prophet calls it in a great
[22:55] wording spoken words Regional seed we
[22:58] were born between Satan and
[23:03] Eve now every little baby that comes
[23:05] into the world is born between Satan and
[23:10] Eve no no born my mama my
[23:16] daddy well kind of get a little
[23:18] spiritual thinking right
[23:21] exactly you were brought here by an act
[23:23] that
[23:25] was turned into perversion right right
[23:28] that's
[23:29] it even though Mama and Daddy was
[23:31] married that still that
[23:34] was the way you was born
[23:37] physically come from a sex act right
[23:41] right and that's why the psalmist would
[23:43] says he did and bringing many scriptures
[23:46] together born in sin shaping in iniquity
[23:49] a spouse from my mother's wound a
[23:52] liar psalmist knew a lot about us didn't
[23:55] he right he was telling it from the Holy
[23:58] Spirit speaking but what about being
[24:00] born between Satan and Eve what is he
[24:04] saying all
[24:06] right the act that we're born from is a
[24:10] natural
[24:12] concept all right that's
[24:15] sensible and it takes lust and desires
[24:19] to bring those things into
[24:22] being all right so that should be enough
[24:24] sensible right to see then what takes
[24:29] place right it's not to say well BL we
[24:32] just won't we won't have no more of that
[24:33] we'll just quit that well I don't think
[24:36] that'll
[24:37] work I've not got any confidence in that
[24:40] point because the devil is not going to
[24:43] let you do it that way he's going to
[24:45] keep you in a line to where it will be
[24:48] working and will'll be done that way and
[24:50] you know they can test you but all they
[24:52] want to but it's still got all kind of
[24:55] problems involved okay now
[24:58] see every one of us then were being as
[25:01] we were born we were born to hybrid
[25:04] right which was not God's original plan
[25:07] amen right right it was not God's
[25:09] original plan for you and I to be born
[25:10] the way we were born am so that's why we
[25:13] will be born a
[25:15] hybrid all right and death can't breed
[25:18] death you can't bring it back from it
[25:20] all
[25:22] right so then Nicodemus would be right
[25:24] in what he was saying he says if I go
[25:27] back to my mother's wound and come forth
[25:30] again that wouldn't help me any if you
[25:32] say I was wrong to start
[25:35] with right and see what I said this it's
[25:39] not written in there and a whole lot but
[25:41] surely there's not a five you could read
[25:44] that in less than five minutes and he's
[25:46] out the door yeah no no a great
[25:50] discussion takes place all right so we
[25:52] get the thought of what it is and
[25:56] understand all right
[26:00] but we know too that Jesus in what he
[26:02] was saying there in John 3 he says You
[26:05] must be borned
[26:07] again now we read the original and
[26:10] brought it to you where it says You must
[26:12] be born from
[26:16] above not just go through another
[26:18] natural birth you got to be born from
[26:21] above Jesus was simply saying you got to
[26:23] be born again from where I come from
[26:27] amen from above all right Prophet says
[26:30] on why uh was I'm not against why and
[26:33] I'm against organized religion he says
[26:35] you got to be birthed from above that's
[26:38] right all right Jesus said in John
[26:44] 18:36 said my kingdom is not of this
[26:51] world if it was my disciples would
[26:55] fight so he wasn't speaking of of a
[26:57] natural Kingdom even like I told you you
[27:01] still get over in Acts one right along
[27:03] in there even after his resurrection
[27:06] after all the things that had happened
[27:08] after all they had seen him the
[27:10] disciples said will will you restore the
[27:12] kingdom to Israel at this time
[27:15] right they still had their mind set on
[27:17] some form of Earthly thing why because
[27:19] he wasn't born
[27:22] again they had to promise they were
[27:25] believing onto yes
[27:28] but they had not received the new
[27:32] birth they had a great
[27:35] confession they had seen the sick healed
[27:37] the dead raised all kind of things
[27:40] taking place in their
[27:42] Ministry even Judas the Bible said had
[27:45] part of the ministry the one that
[27:48] finally turned Jesus
[27:51] in but he had part of the ministry
[27:53] because that was the time that was what
[27:55] the Lord Jesus had given him all
[27:58] right now then in
[28:02] that I ask you to read Matthew Mark Luke
[28:05] and
[28:06] John and see how many times it speaks of
[28:09] the
[28:10] kingdom and what it speaks of that
[28:12] Kingdom right the kingdom is liking to
[28:14] this the kingdom is liking to this
[28:16] kingdom is lik to this all different
[28:18] kind of parable speaking of the
[28:21] Kingdom but after all was said and
[28:24] done I
[28:26] said after all they had seen they still
[28:29] thought he was going to turn over the
[28:31] kingdom to the Israelites at that time
[28:35] they could see easily oh yes he's going
[28:37] to drive off all these Romans he's just
[28:39] going to kill all these people he going
[28:40] to drive out all this and we Jews are
[28:42] going to take
[28:47] over but see that's the carnal
[28:50] mind trying to understand the spiritual
[28:54] part of God and that won't work
[28:58] all right
[29:00] now see all
[29:02] Christians are born from above amen
[29:05] right there's where the secret there's
[29:07] where the mystery is that's what people
[29:09] don't understand
[29:13] today to have the new birth you must
[29:16] have the life of Jesus Christ is that
[29:20] true amen all right see then that life
[29:23] of Jesus Christ came from above didn't
[29:26] come from here right amen his mama
[29:28] didn't have anything to do with his body
[29:30] other than an incubator to carry it she
[29:32] didn't Supply no egg and God give uh
[29:35] birth to the egg cuz you'd had an
[29:37] intercourse intercourse act to take
[29:39] place to bring it down and we don't
[29:41] believe in stuff like that that's
[29:44] right God created the egg and the sperm
[29:47] or germ whatever you want to call placed
[29:49] it into the wound of Mary and she was
[29:52] simply an incubator you see that now
[29:54] because you go up to Gainesville up
[29:56] there and they'll show you in a hurry
[29:59] that they got millions of chickens today
[30:01] in incubators being born that the mom
[30:03] and daddy ain't nowhere
[30:06] around but still it takes a
[30:09] birth all
[30:11] right see we have to be citizens from
[30:16] above Jesus said I'm not of this
[30:19] world right and he said ye are not of
[30:22] this world right right well he was
[30:26] trying to get them to understand stand
[30:28] where that we would be citizens from by
[30:31] the new birth we become citizens of
[30:33] Heaven because that's where Jesus came
[30:36] from
[30:38] right so it would require that we must
[30:41] accept Jesus Christ as our savior to in
[30:45] any form have anything to
[30:48] do with the kingdom of
[30:50] God all right simple thought but yet
[30:55] trying to get you to think a little bit
[30:57] of about the
[31:00] situation brother Dale you a lot of
[31:03] times preach like that none of us ain't
[31:04] got
[31:05] nothing well if we realize we ain't got
[31:08] nothing we can do something about
[31:11] it right so I've done my job I may be a
[31:15] good devil I'll try my best to be one
[31:18] can I quote the prophet he said if I'm
[31:20] going to be this or that let me be a
[31:22] good one that's right so if I'm going to
[31:24] be a good devil let me be a good devil
[31:26] if I can any way provoke you to the
[31:28] point for you to think that you need to
[31:30] be born again then I've done my
[31:36] job don't be so super religious to
[31:38] reject the word of God though all right
[31:41] now
[31:45] look what then does it
[31:48] take when you're dealing with the
[31:51] subject of the new
[31:54] birth Born Again experience whatever you
[31:56] want to call it
[32:00] what does it take to make that
[32:05] birth
[32:07] right what does it take to make that
[32:10] birth okay let's read a little bit and
[32:12] just let brother brandom explain because
[32:14] we firmly believe in that God sent a
[32:16] prophet we don't believe he's any more
[32:18] than that and doesn't that solves that
[32:21] problem but we just read uh if I had a
[32:24] lot of Luther's reading I have some of
[32:26] it I quote some things from him I'll do
[32:28] all of that I would do it with Wesley or
[32:30] anybody else John Smith uh you
[32:34] know but listen to what the prophet has
[32:37] to say and then get your scriptures in
[32:40] the right order off of demonology
[32:44] E18 says for instance like this when
[32:47] Jesus died at
[32:49] Calvary how many what elements came from
[32:52] his body all right giving you simple
[32:54] terminology right what elements came
[32:57] from the body of
[32:59] Jesus water blood spirit or as we call
[33:03] it life whatever is that right now any
[33:07] Minister any believer knows that that's
[33:10] what constitutes the new birth is that
[33:16] right
[33:18] that constitutes the new birth St John
[33:22] 75 for there are three that by record
[33:26] water blood Spirit now if you get into
[33:29] that really there's a three there's are
[33:31] three that that by record in heaven
[33:34] there in John and that is the Father the
[33:36] word and the Holy Ghost these three are
[33:38] one the Bible says all right and then it
[33:41] says there's three that be witness in
[33:44] the earth which is water blood and
[33:46] spirit and they agree with one in one
[33:49] all right what does it take to make the
[33:51] natural
[33:53] birth water breaks blood comes yeah and
[33:57] then the baby come what does it take to
[33:59] make a spiritual
[34:01] birth all
[34:04] right water blood spirit out of the body
[34:07] of the Lord Jesus came what when they
[34:10] pierced his side out came water right
[34:15] all right then it was mingled and mixed
[34:17] with blood and doings you know and so
[34:21] that would be water blood and then the
[34:24] life was released from the body
[34:27] and went up and came back on the day of
[34:29] Pentecost to bring that new
[34:32] birth all right so what does it take to
[34:35] make those the word constitute is a is a
[34:38] word that means uh means to
[34:43] compose you know put together things or
[34:45] what anything consist of or like uh you
[34:49] take mortar mortar you know like you lay
[34:51] blocks mortar is composed of lime and
[34:55] sand what it mean means to whatever
[34:58] something consist of or is composed of
[35:01] all right so the natural birth is
[35:03] composed of water blood
[35:07] life the new
[35:11] birth consist of
[35:15] what from the Lord Jesus came the water
[35:19] the blood and the life all right now to
[35:21] bring that down we don't believe in
[35:23] bringing down the physical blood you
[35:27] know we don't believe in the having the
[35:30] physical water that comes out of the of
[35:32] the body of Christ so what is that
[35:35] translated into to you and I
[35:38] right
[35:40] justification
[35:42] sanctification and the baptism of the
[35:44] Holy
[35:45] Ghost all right water blood and spirit
[35:49] justification see
[35:52] sanctification justification by
[35:54] Believing on God and receiving him as
[35:57] your personal
[36:00] Savior and being baptized in the name of
[36:03] the Lord Jesus Christ to show that
[36:06] you're taking on that
[36:07] name all
[36:09] right and that's why we don't believe in
[36:12] father son Holy Ghost because that the
[36:15] real true is Lord Jesus
[36:18] Christ all
[36:20] right but see then you have to go
[36:22] through
[36:24] sanctification which is a cleansing and
[36:26] setting
[36:29] aside and then the baptism of the Holy
[36:32] Ghost well how many churches teach that
[36:34] now no you go to this one it believes in
[36:37] this you go to that one it believes in
[36:38] that you go to here it believes in that
[36:40] go to another one you shout you speak in
[36:42] tongues you do things you know you cry
[36:44] and you say oh they're saved well that's
[36:47] between you and God whether you're saved
[36:49] or not amen I didn't lose you and I
[36:51] can't save you all right I didn't make
[36:54] you lost and I can't make you save
[36:57] that's between you and God all right you
[37:00] got to work out your own salvation all
[37:03] right but see
[37:05] explaining things in simple
[37:08] terminologies the prophet would explain
[37:10] it that say
[37:14] justification that you're receiving
[37:16] Jesus Christ as your savior you come to
[37:19] the altar you
[37:21] repent you say I'm sorry you know Lord
[37:25] forgive me you accept him as your savior
[37:29] all right then the next thing is to
[37:31] follow him in water baptism to show that
[37:33] your repentance and things was genuine
[37:36] and you follow him into his name all
[37:38] right and then you come to the Second
[37:42] Step which is sanctification which is a
[37:44] cleansing and setting
[37:46] aside and Jesus said the unclean Spirit
[37:49] goeth out of a man walketh in dry places
[37:51] seeketh rest findeth none comes back and
[37:53] finds a house swept and garnished he
[37:55] enters back into the house it's seven
[37:57] times worse the second time than it was
[37:59] the first that's paraphrasing but that's
[38:01] scripture right cleansing setting you
[38:06] aside all right because you can't put
[38:09] God in an unclean vessel is that what he
[38:12] says God won't dwell in an unclean
[38:14] vessel but now so don't try to put the
[38:16] devil and God and there together as one
[38:18] now that won't work out too good right
[38:20] amen you got a whole lot to do and we're
[38:22] going to get down to those things as we
[38:24] get on through the message
[38:27] but think about it simple illustration
[38:30] you look out in the yard and you find a
[38:32] GCE a cup or Etc or something in the
[38:35] yard and you say hey I got a use for
[38:38] that well you don't take that in the
[38:40] house and pour water in it and drink out
[38:41] of it do
[38:44] you
[38:46] right so number one you picked it up you
[38:49] had a reason for it right number two you
[38:52] take it in the house and you wash it
[38:54] real
[38:55] good see that's
[39:00] sanctification Sanctified by the washing
[39:02] of the word is what the Bible
[39:05] calls all right well see then you got to
[39:08] put it in service you got a reason for
[39:10] picking it up now your reason can be
[39:13] fulfilled by placing within that glass
[39:17] the water the drink or whatever you're
[39:19] deciding to take so now you've come
[39:22] through justification sanctification the
[39:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost with a simp
[39:27] illustration simple illustration of what
[39:30] takes place in the New
[39:32] Birth you realize that you're
[39:35] lost that's number
[39:37] one CU it don't matter if you saved you
[39:39] ain't going to you think you saved you
[39:42] ain't going to try no better no way
[39:44] nowhere to repent
[39:47] right cuz see that's where the people
[39:49] today be just like
[39:52] Nicodemus I explained the simple
[39:55] terminology simple point point of water
[39:57] blood and spirit that Jesus said we got
[40:00] to be born that
[40:02] way all right now try to explain that to
[40:05] people
[40:06] today that's been in church all their
[40:10] life and they're good people that's
[40:13] right but ask them did they when did
[40:15] they get born again or do it as Paul
[40:17] said one day Paul said have you receive
[40:20] the Holy Ghost since you
[40:23] believe but we good old Baptist had it
[40:26] figured out that you got it when you
[40:27] believe that's not scripture that's
[40:29] right am uhuh no it's after you
[40:33] believe see now getting into details
[40:36] that brings things into being that
[40:39] you're looking at things and wondering
[40:41] well you know I I've been at church all
[40:43] of my life I've always went to church
[40:46] well that's
[40:47] good I've been a Dale ever since I was
[40:51] born never one day without anything
[40:54] else but did that make me worth
[40:58] anything
[41:00] no but you see then you got to come to
[41:03] that place to where that you can
[41:05] understand what the new birth then
[41:07] consist
[41:11] of it consist of believing on the Lord
[41:14] Jesus Christ and accepting him as your
[41:18] savior repenting of your
[41:22] sins and then asking God to cleanse you
[41:26] and take away the desires of those
[41:28] things that you used to
[41:30] do
[41:32] right asking him to set you aside with
[41:34] that point to cleanse
[41:36] you and get you clean enough that the
[41:39] Holy Ghost can come and live in
[41:42] you and see that's why the prophet says
[41:45] it this way there's not too many new
[41:48] birse all right why because people won't
[41:53] go with it that
[41:55] way
[41:57] right you come along where you get into
[42:00] our ranks and what we call the message
[42:03] people are you going to explain to the
[42:05] most of the people of this message that
[42:07] they're not born
[42:12] again well that's none of your business
[42:14] brother Dale no no it's not that's why I
[42:16] preach
[42:19] here I'm not out there that's none of my
[42:22] business I'm preaching
[42:25] here
[42:26] want anybody listen to this that's their
[42:29] business I'm not the pastor except to
[42:31] those who call me their Pastor all right
[42:35] no but you see how is it to try to
[42:39] explain
[42:41] something what do you mean brother Dale
[42:43] we just
[42:45] believe we believe the
[42:51] message what is that statement about the
[42:54] Church of Christ says we
[42:57] believe what the Bible
[42:59] says and we only say what the Bible
[43:05] says well you know that's not true
[43:09] because present to them one true and
[43:11] living God and see what they say present
[43:13] to them water baptism in the name of the
[43:15] Lord Jesus Christ and see what to say
[43:17] the Bible's still talking and they
[43:19] doesn't
[43:20] quit right that's not throwing off on
[43:25] them it's just
[43:28] illustrating to see what we're
[43:32] doing well we believe the prophet's
[43:34] message well so does the devil does that
[43:37] make him
[43:39] saved come
[43:41] on well what else you want us to do all
[43:44] I want you to do is get born
[43:47] again well I've been born again 40 years
[43:49] praise the
[43:54] Lord now now our life will
[43:57] prove whether we're born again or not so
[44:01] if our life doesn't tally up to what
[44:04] word we
[44:07] claim then right we're the ones that are
[44:10] saying we're not born
[44:15] again
[44:18] right well it don't bother me to do this
[44:21] that well then maybe you're not born
[44:24] again
[44:25] yet
[44:26] right
[44:29] right we see simple faith in the Lord
[44:32] Jesus Christ to believe that he paid my
[44:36] debt and if he paid my debt why would I
[44:39] not be uh
[44:43] concerned why would I not be uh willing
[44:47] to follow in the line that he would want
[44:50] me to follow if he paid my debt that I
[44:53] can't pay right
[44:56] and he made
[44:58] way by releasing that water that blood
[45:02] and that
[45:05] life that I could come to a place of a
[45:07] new
[45:11] birth but you see we put it on as I was
[45:13] trying to cover the other day you know
[45:16] you asked people are you born again I
[45:18] shouted I cried I spoke in tongues all
[45:20] right there's 969 different
[45:21] denominations 2,000 in the message all
[45:25] right and every one of them has got a
[45:27] way of saying what the new birth is now
[45:31] is the Bible that
[45:33] confused I thought it had one way of
[45:36] saying
[45:37] things well you think you the only one
[45:40] knows what it said no but if I do know
[45:43] what it says then I don't have to worry
[45:45] about it it's not you're not going to
[45:47] argue with me about time you're going to
[45:49] be arguing with the word of
[45:51] God could it be we're in the same
[45:54] situation of Nicodemus
[45:57] a great religious
[46:02] Society but yet we are not born again
[46:05] that's
[46:09] right that's hard to think
[46:13] about but you see we want to put it all
[46:16] always upon something we've done or
[46:19] don't do right I quit smoking I quit
[46:23] drinking I quit chewing I quit running
[46:26] around I quit all these things I quit I
[46:28] quit this I quit that and that's good
[46:32] wonderful but did you do it because of
[46:35] the new birth inside of you or did you
[46:37] do it because of your own
[46:41] willpower I didn't like smoking so I
[46:43] didn't have no
[46:45] problem never tried drinking didn't have
[46:47] no problem does that make me
[46:53] saved would you remember what we were
[46:55] trying to bring bring out that those
[46:56] things are what we call
[47:02] attributes the baby crying is not the
[47:04] birth of the baby that means the baby
[47:07] did get here right
[47:11] right the baby gets here it's spanked or
[47:14] whatever the shock of coming in the
[47:16] world it starts
[47:18] crying the crying is not the baby that's
[47:21] what the baby's
[47:24] doing
[47:26] see then the new birth is not what we do
[47:28] or don't
[47:30] do it's what he's already
[47:33] done and for us to have our faith based
[47:36] into that that's
[47:39] right that's why the Bible says Bible
[47:42] doesn't say he that believes and is
[47:43] baptized it doesn't say that it ain't
[47:46] Bible it said he that believeth amen
[47:49] which is a
[47:51] continuation Keep On
[47:54] Believing he that believeth and his
[47:57] baptized shall be saved amen all right
[48:00] but you see we put it on some kind of
[48:04] something
[48:06] that you know that we can do act like a
[48:12] Christian do like a
[48:15] Christian but that don't mean we're
[48:17] saved that's right
[48:21] amen Nicodemus had a pretty good place
[48:25] to be standing right you couldn't bring
[48:28] nothing against
[48:31] him you realize the high priest which
[48:35] Nicodemus wasn't but you realize the
[48:37] high priest and probably was for them
[48:39] too but the high priest if he had one
[48:41] Mark against him he'd be taken out and
[48:43] be
[48:50] killed not a whole lot just one little
[48:53] Mark all right
[48:57] but you say but brother Dale you're
[48:59] taking away everything that I've ever
[49:02] thought about of knowing why that I'm
[49:04] saved well praise the Lord you want to
[49:07] preach about four more hours we'll go
[49:09] through lunch right on in this afternoon
[49:10] keep on
[49:12] going to try to
[49:15] see the point of whether we're born
[49:17] again or not
[49:21] right oh no that's not the way people do
[49:24] it they want tell you oh you believe the
[49:26] message don't you you believe the
[49:28] prophet and you believe the way we
[49:30] believe it especially especially to
[49:32] believe it the way we believe it you
[49:34] know we believe we believe it like it's
[49:36] supposed to be
[49:38] believed you know well so does everybody
[49:41] else say
[49:43] that all
[49:45] right but think about
[49:50] it now here's what we want to get into
[49:53] for a little
[49:54] bit this is the thought of the whole
[49:56] message so if you don't get nothing else
[49:58] get this
[50:00] thought where does the New Birth take
[50:11] place in the
[50:16] soul all
[50:18] right it doesn't take place in the
[50:24] body right cuz the Bible says the body
[50:28] without the spirit is
[50:30] dead all
[50:33] right do you understand that's James 2
[50:36] and
[50:38] 26 the body without the spirit is dead
[50:41] right all
[50:45] right yeah but but but brother Dale that
[50:47] no that
[50:51] displays that displays something else
[50:54] inside of you you that motivates
[50:58] you right you take and you tap somebody
[51:02] on the head you mess up the spinal cord
[51:05] the nerve endings and what is it a
[51:08] vegetable can still
[51:11] think can still
[51:13] talk can do everything just like it was
[51:16] before but can't move a
[51:23] muscle so there something went wrong
[51:25] wrong somewhere
[51:27] right all right so the body without the
[51:31] spirit is
[51:34] dead
[51:38] right
[51:39] now then so we don't need to talk about
[51:42] the body of the new
[51:43] birth the body displays what's inside of
[51:47] us so we got to go deeper than just what
[51:50] you're looking at
[51:52] amen all right we go in into the second
[51:56] realm of mankind known as the
[51:59] spirit because the outer realm of
[52:02] mankind is
[52:03] what if the brothers can where's brother
[52:06] Joe okay you may have to run back there
[52:08] and run that up if you want to I meant
[52:10] to tell you I forgot it to draw into the
[52:13] circles and the things all
[52:16] right but see the second realm of man is
[52:19] known as the spirit of
[52:22] man which is your memory your reason
[52:25] your conscience to
[52:27] affection the body it has five senses
[52:30] called see taste feel smell
[52:33] hear all right all that does is contact
[52:36] this world out here right or display
[52:39] something that's motivating it the next
[52:42] part of you is where the trouble is at
[52:45] right because DS were the memory the
[52:48] reason the conscience affections love
[52:53] Etc is in that second real called a
[52:57] spirit
[52:58] real
[53:00] right but then inside of you
[53:03] is a being that is called a
[53:08] soul and that Soul either has one f one
[53:11] sense it's either Faith or doubt you're
[53:13] either born again or you're not born
[53:15] again you either have God living in you
[53:17] or the devil is motivating you either
[53:19] way you want to go it's got to be one of
[53:21] the two there is no gray areas amen
[53:24] right all right so we're not born again
[53:26] in our
[53:27] body that would help I'm 75 it would
[53:32] really help to be 21 again but the world
[53:36] couldn't stand me because I if I holler
[53:38] and scream now and try to preach what
[53:41] would I be doing when I and I used to do
[53:44] that coming into this message I really
[53:47] done a lot of hollering and
[53:49] screaming but what good does that do the
[53:53] body without the spirit is dead
[53:55] right all right now there's a second
[53:58] real as we said of you it's called a
[53:59] spirit
[54:02] realm all right and that Spirit real is
[54:05] memory reasons go here he has it up here
[54:08] see you got the outer Court inner courts
[54:10] which is the Old Testament going but
[54:11] look what it's talking about see you got
[54:14] the the doings that comes around you got
[54:16] see taste feel smell and have to move it
[54:19] up just a ha to get it uh that's okay
[54:21] they everybody ought to know that anyway
[54:24] that you know C taste feel smelling here
[54:26] all right that gives you an
[54:28] understanding to look at but inside of
[54:30] that is something that's more real than
[54:32] your fleshly body it is a spiritual
[54:35] realm that is what motivates you that's
[54:39] What Makes Your Body Move that's what
[54:41] makes you do the things you do is the
[54:44] spirit that is within you there's where
[54:47] the lust the the problems and the things
[54:50] come to pass is in the spirit realm the
[54:54] second real the part of where it's
[54:56] memory reason conscious affections and
[54:58] things that's what causes our
[55:01] trouble all
[55:03] right because that is the part that we
[55:06] call the spirit now all right I make
[55:08] sure that I say this because people are
[55:10] are on the internet are listening they
[55:12] think well you didn't say that right
[55:14] I'll explain it again in the early
[55:16] Ministry of brother brandham he would
[55:18] explain Body Spirit and soul and he
[55:22] would explain that as to be the three
[55:25] Realms of man then in the later Ministry
[55:28] he be to explaining it as
[55:30] body let's see he explained early
[55:32] Ministry Body Soul spirit all right
[55:35] putting the spirit in the center in the
[55:37] last part of the ministry he was
[55:39] explaining as body spirit and soul but
[55:43] now the point is he didn't have to
[55:44] correct that because he was right in
[55:47] what he was saying it was just words he
[55:50] was using because the first real of man
[55:53] he always gave C face field smelling
[55:56] here the second realm of man no matter
[55:58] if he called it Spirit or Soul he always
[56:01] gave it to Five
[56:02] Senses all right which is a memory
[56:05] reason conscience imagination and things
[56:07] as you're reading and going around but
[56:09] then he always gave the center of man to
[56:11] be amen Faith or doubt that's right amen
[56:15] all right now where our trouble is at is
[56:19] in that second Rim amen whatever you
[56:22] want to call
[56:23] it just remember to get your senses
[56:27] correct and then you'll be all right
[56:30] watch what you're reading in the senses
[56:33] when it says soul in the early Ministry
[56:35] and read it and it'll save uh you know
[56:38] memory reason conscience affs you know
[56:40] what he's talking about the second
[56:42] real where in the last days when he
[56:45] would use the word so you know what he
[56:47] talking about the sinner RM because he
[56:49] said it's either Faith or doubt all
[56:50] right that's a simple point to
[56:53] understand you say well well why did
[56:55] that be done like
[56:57] that well maybe God let it be done that
[56:59] a way to confuse a lot of people why did
[57:03] he
[57:04] say the himself to be baptized in the
[57:08] name of the father and of the son and of
[57:11] the Holy
[57:13] Ghost Matthew
[57:15] 28:19 then when Peter come over that had
[57:19] the Keys of the Kingdom Matthew
[57:21] 16 and Peter comes over to the basis
[57:25] and Peter says You must be baptized in
[57:28] the name of Jesus Christ
[57:31] right now why would he allow that to be
[57:37] done to where people can be confused
[57:41] amen about what they're doing yes and
[57:43] not following the story completely they
[57:47] will be mly
[57:48] confused so when we get a little bit
[57:51] later on as speaking about it where he
[57:52] Saidi give you a New Soul
[57:57] and watch his memory reason conscious
[58:00] affections and it'll come out you'll
[58:02] understand see by the new
[58:06] birth I mean you should accept the
[58:08] natural illustration I just
[58:10] gave you know there's no argument you
[58:13] tell me there is where is an
[58:17] argument when you say that a prophet
[58:19] says Body Soul Spirit then later he says
[58:23] Body Spirit spirit and soul but he
[58:26] always said 5 cents is body 5 cents is
[58:30] second 1 cents for The Sinner now
[58:33] there's no human argument course I don't
[58:35] do no good I don't take away people's
[58:37] thinking CU they're going to think that
[58:40] especially you two Soul people see they
[58:42] couldn't stand that because they had to
[58:43] get that Soul involved all right it's in
[58:47] the doctrinal issue so is it so why you
[58:49] got Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[58:51] Pentecostal ET and then you got bramit
[58:55] H it's because of a misconception of the
[58:59] truth amen
[59:01] right is it father son holy ghost or
[59:04] Lord Jesus Christ I've even heard people
[59:06] of this message say we take Matthew 28
[59:10] uh they take Matthew 28:19 we take acts
[59:12] 238 I said you're wrong if you take acts
[59:16] 238 you're going to get baptized in the
[59:18] name of the Lord Jesus
[59:20] Christ which is Father Son and Holy
[59:22] Ghost Lord Jesus Christ
[59:26] see but see those points you know you
[59:29] say well why do you say that every once
[59:30] in a while they keep you from being
[59:35] confused
[59:36] hey I may be
[59:39] 75 I may not have much
[59:42] sense but that devil still
[59:45] talks and if you get to be 95 you'll
[59:48] still be talking to you and me that's
[59:51] right and he'll be telling us how wrong
[59:54] this is is and how wrong that is and
[59:57] quoting you
[1:00:00] scriptures
[1:00:02] right so you put it down you say well
[1:00:04] okay that's it it's
[1:00:06] soft well you're just
[1:00:09] stubborn is it
[1:00:12] right give me a sensible answer as I
[1:00:16] said to the minister
[1:00:17] Brethren 30 something years ago give me
[1:00:20] a sensible
[1:00:22] answer can you say that the Prophet is
[1:00:25] right here and wrong
[1:00:30] here I don't I'm not go through that
[1:00:33] right I may be dumb but I ain't stupid I
[1:00:36] ain't going that far I'm going to say
[1:00:39] what he's saying until I can understand
[1:00:42] what he's saying it'll come
[1:00:44] together now to get to point
[1:00:48] then the new birth does not come in your
[1:00:53] body
[1:00:55] it only displays what's inside of you
[1:00:58] the new birth is not in your
[1:01:00] spirit I don't want the new birth just
[1:01:03] in my spirit you know what I wind up
[1:01:05] being an anointed
[1:01:11] one I think we need the baptism of the
[1:01:13] Holy Ghost all over the whole body
[1:01:15] Spirit soul and every part of our being
[1:01:17] right we need it
[1:01:22] yep but remember the body without the
[1:01:24] spirit is dead so that's no
[1:01:27] good and the misconcept the
[1:01:30] misconception of the second
[1:01:32] real of
[1:01:36] mankind that's where our problem is at
[1:01:39] right CU Jesus said it he said the
[1:01:41] unclean Spirit goeth out of a
[1:01:45] man walketh in dry places as
[1:01:48] sanctification cuz that's where your
[1:01:50] unclean Spirit goes out we'll get to it
[1:01:52] later on this evening I guess now
[1:01:56] but that unclean Spirit goes
[1:01:59] out if the Holy Spirit don't come in it
[1:02:02] won't be long till the devil's coming
[1:02:04] back that's right all right and you know
[1:02:07] what the big problem then
[1:02:09] is he's going to come back with emotions
[1:02:13] signs and
[1:02:16] wonders amen
[1:02:19] right but remember Judas had signs and
[1:02:22] wonders following him the Bible said is
[1:02:24] come on that he had part of the
[1:02:29] ministry come on we're still in the
[1:02:31] Bible right he wasn't just a fly by
[1:02:34] night he was the Secretary of the crowd
[1:02:37] the The Man of the Year to everybody but
[1:02:39] the Lord Jesus they knew who he
[1:02:43] was he was the money guy remember
[1:02:48] right the
[1:02:50] treasure right but now think about it
[1:02:57] so thank God for a prophet that would
[1:03:00] explain things amen yes
[1:03:04] sir you you ought to thank him every you
[1:03:06] ought to thank God every day for God
[1:03:08] sending us the truth amen about 10,000
[1:03:11] times each
[1:03:14] day but it said You shall know the truth
[1:03:16] and the truth shall set you free it
[1:03:18] didn't say you'll know about the truth
[1:03:20] head knowledges or
[1:03:23] anything
[1:03:26] there's one thing in there that really
[1:03:28] got me the other day and I don't I'll
[1:03:31] just go ahead and tell
[1:03:34] you you know it's memory reason
[1:03:37] conscious affection and now all that
[1:03:40] works through the brain okay TR but you
[1:03:43] know it's never called
[1:03:46] knowledge you say yeah I got this quote
[1:03:48] where said no you're not thinking what
[1:03:50] I'm talking
[1:03:53] about this one's called knowledge it's
[1:03:57] not called memory reason conscience
[1:04:02] affection
[1:04:04] right that's knowledge that's Holy Ghost
[1:04:08] knowledge it's not just memory reason
[1:04:11] conscience and affection okay all right
[1:04:14] but think
[1:04:17] now that second Rim whatever you out
[1:04:21] there hear this and you get all confused
[1:04:24] about it whether you want to call it
[1:04:26] Soul or want to call it Spirit just
[1:04:28] remember it has five senses okay now we
[1:04:31] got that problem
[1:04:32] solved didn't help none but we got it
[1:04:35] where you can't argue that
[1:04:38] point now what about it that you can be
[1:04:45] anointed on that Spirit
[1:04:50] real with the
[1:04:52] genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:04:56] Spirit and still be lost and just as
[1:04:59] devil
[1:05:01] possessed as you was to start
[1:05:03] with now there's the place we ought to
[1:05:06] deal a whole lot on right cuz that would
[1:05:08] be the one that would be the most
[1:05:10] confusing yes is the second realm of man
[1:05:15] right right cuz in that second realm of
[1:05:19] man is where you have all of these
[1:05:21] thoughts and ideas from amen
[1:05:25] even as a newborn
[1:05:30] believer there's a whole lot more wrong
[1:05:33] thoughts than there are good
[1:05:36] thoughts if that ain't true with you
[1:05:38] then pray for me and we'll quote to
[1:05:41] prophit a few things about him where the
[1:05:44] devil tempted him when we'll quote about
[1:05:46] the Lord Jesus was able to be tempted
[1:05:48] you
[1:05:49] know but think about
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:55] see if you're born again in your spirit
[1:05:57] you'd have trouble right
[1:06:00] now if you believe that you're born
[1:06:02] again in the spirit realm you're in vast
[1:06:05] trouble because you can be anointed in
[1:06:08] there and you can't tell it different
[1:06:10] and it is a genuine Holy
[1:06:13] Spirit see the new birth is not an
[1:06:17] anointing we will get to these things
[1:06:20] the new birth is a
[1:06:22] person it is not an anointing it is not
[1:06:25] a feeling it is not a crying or a
[1:06:28] shouting or speaking in tongues or
[1:06:30] seeing visions or whatever
[1:06:33] amen the new birth is a birth of a
[1:06:36] person right right but that doesn't take
[1:06:40] place in your body and it does not take
[1:06:41] place in your spirit realm
[1:06:47] right it is in the
[1:06:50] soul where the new birth
[1:06:52] transpires now I'm going to say
[1:06:54] something that's going to be for this
[1:06:55] afternoon but I want you to think then
[1:06:58] justification sanctification is
[1:07:03] not in your body and
[1:07:08] spirit I leave you for a second to
[1:07:14] consider the body and spirit only
[1:07:18] displays the justification the
[1:07:22] sanctification does do any good to be
[1:07:25] Sanctified in your spirit I mean it does
[1:07:27] good yeah yeah well see I say things I
[1:07:29] try to get you to think and and I leave
[1:07:31] an open hole it really does wonderful to
[1:07:34] be Sanctified Body Spirit soul mind
[1:07:38] whatever I got needs
[1:07:42] it but remember if the new birth is not
[1:07:45] in the body and the new birth not in the
[1:07:47] spirit then you better put the new birth
[1:07:50] where it's supposed to
[1:07:51] be the new birth is not your body body
[1:07:54] that decides this come on it's not
[1:07:56] Ezekiel I give you a new
[1:07:59] heart and I give you a new
[1:08:01] spirit then I put my spirit in you
[1:08:04] remember that's wrongly
[1:08:07] taught he don't take your heart
[1:08:12] out but he takes the heart out of you
[1:08:17] that's motivating
[1:08:20] you
[1:08:22] okay so think about
[1:08:25] it see if the new birth is not in your
[1:08:28] body and the new birth is not in your
[1:08:30] spirit then the new birth would be in
[1:08:33] your soul and then it would work back
[1:08:35] out through your spirit through into
[1:08:38] your body that's right
[1:08:41] correct see then you're not born again
[1:08:44] your body or your spirit you're born
[1:08:46] again in the
[1:08:51] soul come on
[1:08:55] well brother D I've been run a message a
[1:08:56] long time ain't never heard it like that
[1:08:59] well where have you been and where's the
[1:09:01] people that you heard
[1:09:03] been I thought the whole message was the
[1:09:06] new birth that's right I thought when
[1:09:09] you're prophet got over to the seventh
[1:09:11] seal he said now go on with the same
[1:09:15] simple message says because if not said
[1:09:18] it'll go from
[1:09:21] you what is the same simple message
[1:09:24] you must be born
[1:09:27] again you ever notice brother randam
[1:09:29] will say it like this he said when I go
[1:09:32] out there among those churches I Don't
[1:09:35] Preach
[1:09:37] Doctrine you ever noticed that how many
[1:09:40] quotes you need of that I Don't Preach
[1:09:43] Doctrine but how many times have you
[1:09:46] ever heard him explain the new birth in
[1:09:50] a denominational
[1:09:52] Church how many times have you ever
[1:09:55] heard him explain one God in a
[1:09:58] denominational Church how many times
[1:10:01] have you ever heard him explain you need
[1:10:02] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:05] Jesus Christ right in the middle of a
[1:10:07] denominational church but he said he
[1:10:10] didn't preach
[1:10:17] Doctrine now have you ever thought about
[1:10:20] that now those are doctrines right but I
[1:10:23] I want you to think with me for a second
[1:10:25] it'll help you to understand why he'd
[1:10:27] say those
[1:10:29] things those are things that are written
[1:10:32] in the Bible that should have been
[1:10:35] taught in every
[1:10:37] Church sir
[1:10:40] right so he wasn't beating on them he
[1:10:43] was just reading the Bible and
[1:10:46] explaining it that they should have
[1:10:48] already been reading
[1:10:51] yes and he said I Don't Preach
[1:10:55] Doctrine but said you know what I
[1:10:57] believe that happened in the
[1:11:03] garden see you can preach the
[1:11:05] Bible as a Doctrine or you can preach
[1:11:08] the Bible as a truth way that is not a
[1:11:12] Doctrine amen that's right it's the
[1:11:16] thought or concept of the entire word of
[1:11:18] God
[1:11:19] am
[1:11:21] right let's get these out way and we'll
[1:11:24] pick up a little B more this evening
[1:11:26] see you're not born again in your body
[1:11:30] you're not born again in your spirit
[1:11:32] you're born again in your
[1:11:35] soul right so in the soul takes place
[1:11:39] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:11:41] of the Holy Ghost in the soul amen right
[1:11:46] not just in your body not just in your
[1:11:49] spirit but then whatever goes inside
[1:11:52] Works back out
[1:11:54] am
[1:11:58] right so what do you
[1:12:01] think the body without the spirit is
[1:12:04] dead now what about being Anointed with
[1:12:07] the Holy Spirit in your spirit why
[1:12:09] wouldn't that save
[1:12:18] you if that's all your new birth is why
[1:12:21] wouldn't it save
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:27] well I never thought about
[1:12:30] that say it again where have you
[1:12:33] been why is it not taught in the message
[1:12:36] of course it's all these great
[1:12:38] Revelations he great
[1:12:46] things what good is any Revelation
[1:12:48] without the Holy Spirit to reveal
[1:12:52] it so what what did your Prophet say was
[1:12:54] the most important thing of
[1:12:59] all you remember that quote what do he
[1:13:01] say the most important thing in the
[1:13:03] world to you is whether you're born
[1:13:05] again or
[1:13:08] not he said don't make no difference
[1:13:10] who's going to be president that's what
[1:13:12] everybody wants now wonder if Hillary's
[1:13:14] going to get it this time I hope she
[1:13:18] does I I ain't registered in 20 years if
[1:13:22] they'll get her up par to Pro you do it
[1:13:24] I'll go vote for
[1:13:27] her because I believe what the Bible
[1:13:30] says I put in Kings and I take out Kings
[1:13:34] Putin didn't get where he was
[1:13:37] at by being a multi
[1:13:42] billionaire these people we talk about
[1:13:44] in America with billionaires billionaire
[1:13:46] Putin's got more money than all of these
[1:13:48] billionaires put
[1:13:52] together that's according to your
[1:13:55] own
[1:13:59] newspapers but look
[1:14:01] church I know we read these a lot but do
[1:14:04] you really consider
[1:14:06] it that you can be Anointed with a genu
[1:14:09] one baptism of the Holy Spirit on your
[1:14:13] spirit and still be lost
[1:14:17] right act like a Christian do like a
[1:14:20] Christian well let me read it okay go
[1:14:22] ahead let's we got number number three
[1:14:24] let's read it number three this is
[1:14:26] called leadership 1965 1207 paragraph
[1:14:29] 259 when they get to it and the seed
[1:14:32] that I talked about a while ago roll it
[1:14:36] on up uh
[1:14:39] 259 I talked about a while ago that Soul
[1:14:42] wasn't there to start with so he's
[1:14:44] explaining something coming down it was
[1:14:46] anointed with the
[1:14:48] spirit and he done all kinds oh you
[1:14:53] when your spirit's anointed you can it's
[1:14:57] the real genuine Holy Ghost and you
[1:15:01] could still be a
[1:15:03] devil Now where's that at on your
[1:15:07] spirit right CU we'll keep going and
[1:15:09] prove it right we've read these works is
[1:15:11] Faith expressed number
[1:15:13] four the spirit can come out here and
[1:15:16] anoint you to do certain thing and you
[1:15:19] do it but that don't mean you're saved
[1:15:21] think of it Kus prophesied Judas cast
[1:15:24] out Devils the spirit anointed him this
[1:15:26] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:15:28] the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but
[1:15:31] is what it is at the
[1:15:33] core there's where you can intellectuals
[1:15:37] can accept and say oh sure that looks
[1:15:39] good I believe that still don't do it no
[1:15:43] sir and the spirit can actually make
[1:15:47] witness of it and this and there still
[1:15:51] isn't so because if that Soul hasn't
[1:15:54] come from God it can make all the
[1:15:57] impersonations out here but it cannot be
[1:16:00] real you can act healing you can act
[1:16:03] like you have you can act like you
[1:16:05] receive it Christians can act like
[1:16:08] they're Christians and act and be ever
[1:16:11] so good at it but that don't mean
[1:16:14] they're
[1:16:16] saved that's exactly right see the
[1:16:18] spirit can be there the real genuine
[1:16:20] Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:16:23] that still don't mean you're saved it's
[1:16:25] that inside Soul That Never Dies it's
[1:16:28] got eternal life it always was eternal
[1:16:32] life it come see it come from God it
[1:16:35] goes to God it's the soul okay next five
[1:16:40] Christ revealed in his own
[1:16:43] word roll it on
[1:16:46] up you can be anointed out here in this
[1:16:49] spirit and desire and do all these other
[1:16:52] things
[1:16:53] now if there's a holy spirit out here
[1:16:55] anointed your desires what kind of
[1:16:57] desires you going to have right you mean
[1:16:59] the Holy Spirit anoints you and you're
[1:17:00] going to have lustful desires now don't
[1:17:02] be
[1:17:05] stupid
[1:17:07] sorry and desire do all these other
[1:17:09] things but when it comes to this toost
[1:17:12] to that word you'll never move from
[1:17:14] there it'll hold right steady and true
[1:17:16] to that word as it can be outside of
[1:17:18] that regardless what you do you're still
[1:17:22] lost
[1:17:23] and knoweth it
[1:17:26] not the people can live in this spirit
[1:17:31] and they dance in the spirit they shout
[1:17:33] in the spirit they go to church in the
[1:17:34] spirit they can absolutely have the real
[1:17:37] spirit of God anointed on that Spirit
[1:17:40] but still be lost and just as devil
[1:17:42] possessed as they can be with that
[1:17:44] Spirit y because watch that's the reason
[1:17:47] you couldn't tell that woman she was
[1:17:49] wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't
[1:17:51] tell her Bob and her hir was wrong wrong
[1:17:53] well what's your heart got to do with it
[1:17:56] it did the Samson whosoever shall add
[1:17:58] one word to it or what all right go
[1:18:02] on let's just stop if I got to if I go
[1:18:06] any further I have to go on into some
[1:18:08] other
[1:18:09] thoughts I hope you
[1:18:12] understand what I'm
[1:18:14] saying you're not born in your body you
[1:18:17] know born again you're not born again in
[1:18:20] your
[1:18:21] spirit you're born again in your
[1:18:25] soul cuz the body without the spirit is
[1:18:28] dead and the spirit can be Anointed with
[1:18:31] a genuine Holy Spirit and you're still
[1:18:35] lost do you believe
[1:18:38] him we claim him to be a
[1:18:41] prophet claim that to be the word come
[1:18:43] on Brothers claim that to be right but
[1:18:46] is it
[1:18:49] true so you're not born again in your
[1:18:51] body you're not born again in your
[1:18:54] spirit then why do you want to deal with
[1:18:55] I shouted I cried I spoke and tongue
[1:18:57] that's that's attributes of what the
[1:18:59] Holy Ghost can
[1:19:00] do but those anointed ones say the same
[1:19:06] thing the anointed ones say I'm anointed
[1:19:09] and they are
[1:19:15] amen but we'll get to it where brother
[1:19:17] Brown gets this quote he said how about
[1:19:20] being anointed to the word right
[1:19:23] amen he said not anointed to them
[1:19:30] denominations what does the word
[1:19:35] say see the word says You must be born
[1:19:38] again we say I cried I shouted I spoke
[1:19:40] in tongues I believe the
[1:19:45] message I don't have nothing to do with
[1:19:48] it unless it's coming from the
[1:19:51] inside
[1:19:55] right see the new birth is not in your
[1:19:58] body it's not in your
[1:19:59] spirit it's in your
[1:20:02] soul and you may never thought I'm sure
[1:20:05] you thought of it that way but you think
[1:20:07] about you're not justified in your body
[1:20:09] you're not justified in your spirit you
[1:20:12] can act Christians you can do all you
[1:20:14] want to you got to be justified in that
[1:20:16] soul that being that you are you got to
[1:20:19] be Sanctified into that being that you
[1:20:22] are and then
[1:20:24] outwardly the the spirit will act and do
[1:20:28] and the body will follow
[1:20:35] therein what about it let's stand what
[1:20:39] about it what do you think about it what
[1:20:43] constitutes the new birth what we got
[1:20:45] Brother 16 number 16
[1:20:48] prob what constitutes the new
[1:20:51] birth water
[1:20:54] life justification sanctification
[1:20:58] baptism of the Holy
[1:21:01] Ghost yeah but but you just read with
[1:21:04] how the baptism
[1:21:06] yeah he stipulated where with
[1:21:09] that you can have the baptism of the
[1:21:12] Holy Spirit every day of your life and
[1:21:13] die and go to hell but you can't have
[1:21:15] the baptism of the holy spirit in that
[1:21:21] soul and go to
[1:21:24] because it would be God's Own
[1:21:32] Liv the prophet said it like
[1:21:36] this he said justification is a work of
[1:21:39] the Holy
[1:21:41] Spirit
[1:21:43] sanctification is a work of the holy
[1:21:48] spirit said but the baptism is the Holy
[1:21:51] Spirit let
[1:21:56] me but but but brother Dale you just
[1:21:59] make me feel like I'm lost now what you
[1:22:01] going to do about
[1:22:07] it what are you going to do about
[1:22:10] it come on how many times have I made
[1:22:13] this
[1:22:14] statement I'd rather go all of my life
[1:22:18] crying out to God for him to reveal
[1:22:21] himself to me and show me that I'm
[1:22:25] saved then to go through my life saying
[1:22:28] I'm saved when I'm not and won't seek
[1:22:32] after
[1:22:36] him what's
[1:22:40] wrong why wouldn't we want to know that
[1:22:42] we're
[1:22:44] lost where God can do
[1:22:51] something
