[7:40] a fresh in you in you and just come now
[7:43] and speak to us as we read your word we
[7:46] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[7:50] amen John 3 very familiar scripture with
[7:52] all of
[7:54] us there was a man of the Pharisees
[7:56] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the
[7:59] same came to Jesus by night and said
[8:01] unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a
[8:03] teacher come from God for no man can do
[8:06] these Miracles that thou doest except
[8:08] God be with
[8:10] him Jesus answered and said unto him
[8:12] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[8:15] man be born again he cannot see the
[8:17] kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him
[8:19] how can a man be born when he is old can
[8:23] he enter the second time into his
[8:24] mother's wound and be born Jesus
[8:27] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[8:30] except a man be born of water and of the
[8:33] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[8:36] of God that which is born to the flesh
[8:38] is flesh and that which is born to the
[8:40] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[8:42] unto thee you must be born again and we
[8:47] went through
[8:48] that this past Sunday trying to cover
[8:52] you know
[8:53] that Nicodemus must have been a pretty
[8:56] good believer we said well all we got to
[8:58] do is believe so he must have been
[8:59] pretty good one he put his life on the
[9:01] line his job and everything and
[9:03] confessed that that no man could do
[9:06] these things unless God be with him
[9:08] that's right all right now let's go to
[9:10] Ephesians
[9:12] 2 and we just read verse 89 for by grace
[9:16] are you saved through faith and that not
[9:19] of yourselves it is the gift of God not
[9:22] of Works lest any man should boast you
[9:25] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[9:28] to the reading of the word now I want to
[9:33] review just a little bit and then we'll
[9:34] try to move on into the to the message I
[9:38] had a bunch of quotes there Sunday to
[9:40] you know just scan across but we didn't
[9:43] get to them but I want to make sure you
[9:47] understand that what we're trying to
[9:49] bring we're talking about just simply
[9:52] what is the new birth all right and we
[9:55] have a lot of young people with us we
[9:57] have a lot of young people on the
[9:58] internet interet system and everything
[10:01] that you know maybe they've never heard
[10:03] really anybody talk about you know the
[10:06] new birth and so we just you know chose
[10:09] that point to do and because way has has
[10:13] the list there of all the people you
[10:14] know that put their families on there to
[10:17] be prayed for and the things and you
[10:19] know when they you you can take this to
[10:22] them and and say well okay just listen
[10:24] there and you'll see what we believe the
[10:26] new birth is am you know and let them up
[10:29] their own mind if they will listen if
[10:31] not then just hold on to it until they
[10:34] get around to where they will listen and
[10:36] just keep believing and accepting them
[10:38] you know for them because uh you know
[10:41] they they really in a position to where
[10:43] that to be lost is a bad thing right but
[10:47] you know we can believe for them and
[10:49] it's not that it'll save them but it
[10:51] sure puts them in a good place because
[10:53] somebody's praying for you you always I
[10:55] always want somebody to pray for me that
[10:57] it wouldn't matter to me if it was a
[10:59] pope of Rome you know I wouldn't no
[11:01] problem against him if I saw him I'd say
[11:03] pray for me you know I used we used to
[11:05] have a woman preacher there at the plant
[11:08] you know when someone would say well you
[11:09] mean you'd ask a woman preacher to pray
[11:10] first you do you know because if she can
[11:13] touch God that's all I'm interested in
[11:17] is somebody that can touch God all right
[11:19] but now I tried to cover some things to
[11:22] where we wouldn't be
[11:24] confused in our thoughts and we covered
[11:27] then Sunday that there's not three works
[11:31] of Grace because that would be lining up
[11:34] into the line of works right and it's
[11:37] not works it's all salvation of the Lord
[11:40] but it's in three
[11:43] stages you know three stages of
[11:46] Salvation not three works of Salvation
[11:49] see if you said it's three works you
[11:51] would have justification one work
[11:53] sanctification another work the baptism
[11:56] would be another work and that wouldn't
[11:58] that wouldn't line up up see and it's
[12:00] not that it's three stages it's the same
[12:02] holy ghost that justifies you it's the
[12:04] same holy ghost that sanctifies you it's
[12:07] the same holy ghost that fills your soul
[12:09] you know and gives you eternal life all
[12:11] right but now to we want you to
[12:15] understand truly that we believe that
[12:19] you know like I was bringing out Sunday
[12:20] if you truly repent of your sins and if
[12:23] you died right there in that state yes
[12:25] you would go to heaven that's right I
[12:27] don't believe you would be the bride of
[12:29] Christ right because you would only be
[12:32] in a repentant stage of
[12:35] justification but still if you died in
[12:37] that condition you know believing that
[12:39] holding on then sure one day you'll
[12:42] receive eternal life at wiro judgment
[12:45] but that that would be a wonderful thing
[12:47] to to think about you know to think
[12:49] about getting everybody wants to they
[12:51] want to win a lottery you know and and
[12:54] you know just get millions of dollars
[12:56] well what good is it right you know it's
[12:59] just no good I like what one guy seen it
[13:01] in the paper yesterday he hit the
[13:03] lottery one time for
[13:05] $115,000 or something like that and he
[13:08] hit it for 750,000 he just took the
[13:11] ticket signed it where nobody else
[13:12] couldn't uh cash it or anything if it
[13:15] got lost and put in his pocket and went
[13:17] on
[13:18] working he said I'll just wait like the
[13:20] first of year where the taxes be
[13:23] cheaper he didn't care you know well
[13:26] that's that's I like that idea better
[13:28] than being so hog tied you know you want
[13:30] to run after every dollar but anyhow but
[13:33] we believe in three manifestations right
[13:36] because that will tie together to
[13:39] understand the new birth then will tie
[13:41] together to where that it helps us to
[13:44] understand the godhead amen because God
[13:46] is not three
[13:48] persons he's God manifested in three
[13:52] ways Father Son and Holy Ghost there are
[13:54] many many ways that he can manifest
[13:57] himself but that way we can put it all
[13:59] together and and you can see your new
[14:02] birth tying together with with God
[14:04] revealing himself and that's why I've
[14:06] always told you that's the way I check a
[14:08] a Doctrine when I'm listening to
[14:10] somebody I I'm listening to see if what
[14:13] they're preaching Compares with what
[14:15] happened in my life am because if they
[14:18] telling me something contrary to what's
[14:20] happened to me I I I just can't accept
[14:23] it that way I I want to stay with what
[14:25] the Lord's revealed me to me you know
[14:27] and through my life all right but we
[14:29] were trying to cover
[14:30] that to get it that it was not three
[14:33] wordss we gave the quotes and than and
[14:35] the prophet that it was three
[14:37] manifestation or three
[14:39] stages all right we'll read that in a
[14:41] minute from future home but then we
[14:44] we're trying to cover that he that comes
[14:46] to God must believe that he is amen all
[14:51] right now not that he was as I told you
[14:54] history can prove that Jesus Christ
[14:58] existed
[15:00] right they can
[15:01] prove they have the proof that he was
[15:04] crucified right they have all of that is
[15:07] natural proof but that doesn't save
[15:09] anybody it's not that to just say I
[15:12] believe in God or I believe Jesus Christ
[15:16] come on that's fine but if it's not
[15:19] something to believe that he is now
[15:22] right the same yesterday today and
[15:24] forever then we'd be in trouble so we we
[15:27] try to emphasize and I want to make sure
[15:29] you you follow that point that you know
[15:34] if you want to be saved the thing to do
[15:37] is to believe that God is Right amen
[15:40] right well I believe Jesus Christ was on
[15:43] the earth 2,000 years
[15:45] ago history can prove
[15:48] that I believe is this I believe that
[15:51] history can prove that right but it's to
[15:54] believe that he is amen and that's why
[15:57] that Jesus said you shall know the
[16:00] truth and the truth shall set you free
[16:03] right that's why the manifestation see
[16:06] we want to we we dwelt so much upon that
[16:09] that there's not three Gods there's
[16:10] three manifestations of the same God
[16:12] right all right there's not three works
[16:15] of
[16:17] Grace there's three stages our
[16:20] manifestation all right in this day in
[16:23] time see we're not back in the Lutheran
[16:25] the Wesley God you know honored those
[16:27] things in but we're in a time now that
[16:30] the New Birth has come to the basis of
[16:32] being justification sanctification the
[16:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost giving us the
[16:37] new birth and that's the same situation
[16:40] that uh Nicodemus was asking about in
[16:43] Jesus was explaining it you know he goes
[16:46] on to explain of it he just born of
[16:48] water and and all the blood and things
[16:50] like that and explaining it to him all
[16:52] right so I hope you follow that point
[16:54] then we got to the point of talking
[16:57] about that many are
[17:00] called but a few are chosen right all
[17:04] right now I was looking some quotes
[17:06] today on that and brother R said the
[17:08] chosen goes back to election all right
[17:10] so we could go into that but we're not
[17:12] trying to do that we're trying to just
[17:14] cover it over a a a simple scale to look
[17:18] at it and see you'd say well how do I
[17:20] know God is dealing with
[17:22] me
[17:24] well why are you
[17:27] listening
[17:29] I mean why are you here why are you on
[17:32] the internet system why are you
[17:34] listening you know why are you paying
[17:36] attention or why you you concerned come
[17:39] on if you wouldn't you know if you just
[17:41] think about it to be
[17:43] concerned right the Bible said blessed
[17:45] are they that hunger and thirst after
[17:47] righteousness why cuz they shall be
[17:50] filled it's a great honor to Prophet
[17:52] said to just
[17:54] thirst to just have a longing in your
[17:56] heart for God and I went through it to
[17:59] explain even to the people of the the
[18:02] countries where they've never even heard
[18:04] of the name of Jesus that's right but
[18:06] yet they see they have something because
[18:09] of a soul that's within them of being a
[18:11] mortal being that that soul is longing
[18:14] for the Creator you know and all and
[18:18] they they have that calling in their
[18:20] life so you say well I I just don't
[18:23] really know where God's calling me or
[18:25] not because we know that nobody can come
[18:27] Jesus
[18:29] said to the father except by
[18:32] me you can't just jump up and say I'm
[18:35] going to go get
[18:36] saved right it's not that way it's him
[18:39] dealing with you amen cuz salvation's of
[18:42] the Lord amen salvation is not you
[18:44] making a decision come
[18:46] on right right now you got to make a
[18:49] decision that's fine right but you got
[18:51] to make a decision about the salvation
[18:54] all right so then you see why it's so
[18:56] valuable to understand the truth because
[18:59] a lot of churches they've got a set of
[19:00] rules you go by and they tell you you're
[19:02] Sav they got a set of something that you
[19:04] do certain scriptures you learn certain
[19:07] uh ways you learn to quote them and say
[19:10] them and memorize a bunch and and and
[19:12] you know and you're saved right but
[19:15] now that's
[19:18] not our understanding of Salvation right
[19:21] our understanding is that God is the
[19:24] author of it all right and that he's
[19:27] trying to make it manifest is to us
[19:29] right all right so now don't worry I
[19:31] wrote back a note world to
[19:33] remember see in this day you got a lot
[19:36] of people in the message if you was a
[19:38] seed you could be saved if you wouldn't
[19:40] one you couldn't be saved and all it's
[19:41] doing is putting doubt in people's mind
[19:44] even if it was
[19:47] true you know I I don't agree with the
[19:50] the seed doctrinal ideas like that I I
[19:53] believe what brother R said about the se
[19:55] but even if it was true
[19:59] why would you want to um somebody come
[20:03] up to want to be saved you say no you
[20:05] can't be save CU you in seed now what
[20:08] kind of a don't tell me that's
[20:10] Christianity come on don't talk to me
[20:12] about that being
[20:14] God that's as heeren as any Heathen
[20:16] could be they wouldn't do that with you
[20:19] they'd let you convert to their
[20:21] ideas yep but you see that's the way the
[20:24] people of the message then they they put
[20:26] people to the point that they don't even
[20:27] see seek God
[20:29] anymore right and like I told you before
[20:32] about it I heard of a couple said they'd
[20:34] like to have another baby but they
[20:36] didn't know whether that baby they have
[20:37] would be a seat of God or no no
[20:39] M
[20:42] well I mean especially if you both of
[20:44] you Christians why wouldn't you think
[20:46] about being deceived are you talking
[20:48] about going out and doing something
[20:49] wrong to get it you know yeah why
[20:53] wouldn't you want to believe
[20:55] it if if I was going to adop a child
[20:59] I would still believe that child that by
[21:01] by me adopting it and and praying for it
[21:04] that God could honor that and save the
[21:06] child wouldn't you why is it that people
[21:09] are this to the point you know that they
[21:11] they really they've they've torn up the
[21:14] gospel instead of trying to preach it
[21:16] right you know and and just it bothers
[21:20] me but now see if we don't accept the
[21:25] truth all right then we say I don't
[21:27] believe we have an excuse when we get
[21:29] there about the truth that's right I
[21:30] mean I've tried now and other ministers
[21:33] here with me we've tried to preach to
[21:35] you the truth and give you an
[21:38] opportunity to be able to be saved and
[21:41] do it correctly and and not go off onto
[21:43] the the Tantrum of all of the message
[21:46] people and and and I'm not against
[21:48] people for doing that no more and I'm
[21:49] against the BST message this
[21:51] Presbyterian what just leave them
[21:53] alone you know let them go and leave
[21:55] them alone now telling you what what I
[21:58] believe and why I don't believe some of
[22:00] the doctrines is my responsibility
[22:02] that's right true but now just just get
[22:05] with it and let's move on then so you
[22:08] see what I'm talking about that we
[22:10] believe in Salvation in three
[22:12] stages all right now and we'll show this
[22:16] through the prophet's message that at
[22:20] justification all that is is Ching off
[22:22] your past sins right he said it's like
[22:25] picking up a GL out in the yard
[22:28] he said you got a reason for it you
[22:31] picked it up he said but it's still
[22:34] dirty he said then you sanctify it or
[22:37] wash it cleanse
[22:40] it and he said then that still doesn't
[22:43] mean that that vessel is in in
[22:48] use CU it it it it needs the fiery
[22:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost to finish all
[22:53] up amen but
[22:56] justification by faith now that's the
[22:59] the thing I want you to get tonight is
[23:00] one thing all right if you don't get
[23:02] nothing else out of the message I don't
[23:03] you to get one thing and we'll read it
[23:05] when we get on over a little further the
[23:07] prophet of God said everything you get
[23:08] from God you get by
[23:11] faith well my brother they see hearing
[23:14] the message people well you can't have
[23:16] faith without the Holy
[23:18] Ghost now show me where the Prophet said
[23:20] you couldn't
[23:22] right
[23:24] right that's right faith is a reation
[23:29] right and you can get a revelation of
[23:32] healing and you are LW inner you
[23:36] agree see then we put it all and I told
[23:39] you there the other day faith has to be
[23:40] understood the way only way I look at it
[23:42] is is Faith is actually a mental
[23:47] believing and you just keep mentally
[23:50] believing it and God moves that mental
[23:53] believing into a position to where that
[23:56] he can Quicken it make it
[23:59] alive but it's still up on my
[24:02] confession that's now if you don't get
[24:04] anything out of the message you get this
[24:05] point we've got to accept by faith right
[24:09] right and then we've got to ex confess
[24:12] according to Romans what is it Romans 10
[24:15] you believe in your heart confess with
[24:17] your
[24:18] mouth you get a high salvation believe
[24:20] it in your
[24:22] heart you said well I'm not going to go
[24:25] out and tell the world that I'm saved
[24:27] but then you're lost right amen because
[24:29] you've cut off your salvation that's
[24:31] right well I believe in my
[24:33] heart but that ain't all the word said
[24:36] it said confess with the
[24:38] mou all right so then if we believe it
[24:41] that way why don't we stand upon it and
[24:44] accept it on that basis right that what
[24:47] we get we receive by
[24:50] faith God drops down low enough I guess
[24:54] is a way to say it or how would you say
[24:56] it he comes down into our realm of life
[25:01] and living and doings to talk to
[25:04] us and communicate with us the goodness
[25:07] of God the scripture said lead us to
[25:11] repentance see then you must accept God
[25:14] now here as we'll get to this at the
[25:15] last but I've got the quotes on we must
[25:18] accept
[25:21] God as our
[25:24] savior see now here's the the brainy
[25:26] people in the message
[25:29] Christ Min of God revealed it's not you
[25:31] accepting him it's him accepting
[25:33] you well now you explain that to
[25:38] me when you must first accept him that's
[25:43] right right that's
[25:47] right if you don't accept him he can't
[25:50] override your free moral Ag and save
[25:53] you okay amen that blown enough right
[25:58] see I'm trying to make it plain and
[26:00] simple we must accept him as our savior
[26:04] all
[26:05] right we must repent of our
[26:08] sins all right then he accepts Us by
[26:11] giving us the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:14] right that's right that's when he
[26:15] accepts you amen is when he gives you
[26:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz then
[26:20] that way you can't be lost you get to
[26:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't be
[26:24] lost all right but if you're just to
[26:27] going through
[26:29] justification and going through
[26:31] sanctification in those stages you have
[26:34] the ability at that position to
[26:37] lose what you started off
[26:40] with right am but once you receive the
[26:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't lose
[26:45] that all right see that's why it's in
[26:50] stages now don't worry about what Luther
[26:52] and westling him was we can take ours to
[26:55] express cuz that was the New Birth like
[26:57] there amen but down here it's required
[27:00] that we have justification from isusa
[27:02] Street coming on down it's required that
[27:05] we have justification sanctification the
[27:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost to have the
[27:10] new birth amen now in doing that see
[27:14] then we must first confess
[27:18] him he begins to deal with us and talk
[27:21] to us a
[27:23] little to call us we come under what we
[27:26] call conv ition you
[27:30] know words we realize we're lost right
[27:34] right he now the prophet of God said all
[27:37] the preacher could do was break the
[27:39] spell that Satan has over your eyes
[27:42] where that God can speak straight to you
[27:44] amen all right that's why you see him
[27:46] stumbling around a lot of times trying
[27:47] to find a way because somebody's pulling
[27:50] something and and we're not prophets to
[27:53] be able to understand what that works on
[27:56] so we have to just play around sometimes
[27:58] we find it and and don't let the Lord do
[28:01] it amen but
[28:03] now get to this will be the main
[28:07] thought that we must accept
[28:11] him as our
[28:14] savior and we must
[28:19] believe that he is dealing with
[28:23] us talking to us speaking to us
[28:28] right why would you be concerned as I
[28:30] said want to go if he wasn't doing
[28:33] it see then we must accept the fact that
[28:36] he's doing
[28:38] that then we must start
[28:42] confessing like I said you mean you
[28:44] would go out and and God would forgive
[28:46] your sins and and then you turn around
[28:49] say I'm not I I I'm I'm like the lady
[28:53] said I believe I'm a Christian but said
[28:56] I believe I got the Holy Ghost the other
[28:57] night said but don't don't tell nobody
[29:00] now well now I doubt your salvation when
[29:04] you because even at repentance it's a
[29:08] it's God working a work in your life to
[29:11] cleanse us of sin why wouldn't we want
[29:13] to tell that God has forgiven us am you
[29:16] know why why wouldn't we want to to
[29:18] speak about those
[29:21] things see maybe it's because he hasn't
[29:24] done it because we haven't approached it
[29:26] correctly all right see we must approach
[29:28] him correctly we must bring it to the
[29:30] basis of where we can take his word and
[29:34] lay it before him right don't get don't
[29:38] you think God would get mad at you for
[29:41] him for you reminding him of what he
[29:43] said now wouldn't that be
[29:45] something I mean you parents where you
[29:47] get mad at your kids cuz they remind you
[29:49] of something you
[29:51] said there something wrong with you
[29:53] right you ought not have said it
[29:55] maybe but might have to tell them ought
[29:58] not to said it but still you said it and
[30:00] you'll try to keep your word right well
[30:03] how much more is our
[30:05] savior the prophet of God said if you
[30:07] find any promise of God in the Bible he
[30:12] said you can bring it before
[30:14] God and this is his words he said if he
[30:17] won't fulfill it then he
[30:20] lied now that's strong that's right but
[30:24] that's how much he believed in the word
[30:26] amen yeah see we find in the
[30:30] word maybe maybe it's not you reading
[30:33] the Bible don't misunderstand me because
[30:35] some people say well I wasn't reading
[30:37] the Bible when I got saved no but you
[30:40] heard somebody or something caused you
[30:43] to get to that position maybe you uh you
[30:47] maybe you heard other people read it
[30:48] maybe you uh you know went to church
[30:51] maybe you
[30:53] uh just love
[30:55] grandma grandma M was a good person and
[30:58] Grandma pray for you you know just like
[31:01] that but that would be all it would take
[31:03] to bring you to a
[31:06] knowledge it's not we'll read in a
[31:08] minute it's not how much of the word you
[31:10] know
[31:13] right it's not that's how much is
[31:17] revealed lot of difference in knowing
[31:19] things and revealing I wish to God I had
[31:21] revealed in my heart what is running
[31:23] around in my head of this message after
[31:26] 40 years of reading it we ought to have
[31:28] a little bit you
[31:30] know but think about it
[31:33] now you must accept him as your
[31:38] savior and you must
[31:41] confess because he is our high priest
[31:44] the scripture says that's making
[31:46] intercession Upon Our
[31:48] confession or profession is the word
[31:50] that's there but it's the same word
[31:52] confession and
[31:54] profession so then he can't do anything
[31:57] until I do it I'll read your quote in a
[31:59] minute we get time to where brother
[32:01] Brown said if you're confessing you're a
[32:03] Christian you are he said you quit
[32:05] confessing you're Christian you're not
[32:12] one you know that's a hard thing a it
[32:17] right but just
[32:19] remember and I'm going to make a bold
[32:21] statement then may hear from this on the
[32:24] internet system or some of you but I'm
[32:26] going to make it anyway
[32:28] see that person that can is you know
[32:33] quits confessing their salvation is not
[32:35] a truly Born Again believer to me now
[32:38] right that's a justification
[32:40] sanctification person that's that's in
[32:43] the stages of
[32:44] Salvation because when you come to that
[32:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost he's going to
[32:49] confess right from the inside of you are
[32:52] let me quote brother randam when he said
[32:55] the man went out and got his beard and
[32:57] sat down and said he wasn't going to
[32:58] preach no more he said in a couple of
[33:00] weeks later he's dead right he said God
[33:03] won't let you Mar his name right there
[33:06] you go see so put it in a category we
[33:09] will get to it eventually one of these
[33:10] days to word that we can speak on it but
[33:14] brother R said I can conclusively prove
[33:16] that you're born again and then baptized
[33:17] into the body right or if you'll listen
[33:20] to what I'm talking about you'll see
[33:22] that
[33:23] exactly you'll see that he's calling the
[33:26] born again experience in that situation
[33:28] the justification of where you're
[33:30] repenting of your sins and that's why he
[33:33] said surely if you die in that
[33:37] condition you will go to
[33:42] heaven but he says that's not the Born
[33:45] Again experience this day you know
[33:47] that's not the new birth for this
[33:50] day all right so then follow those
[33:52] things and you won't get confused when
[33:54] you hear him make statements that sounds
[33:58] odd you know just study it a little
[34:02] while if you'll think about it it' be
[34:04] the only way he could say
[34:06] it how else could he say that you're
[34:10] that he could prove that you're born
[34:11] again and then baptized into the
[34:14] body how else could he say
[34:17] it there is no other way of saying it
[34:20] because he's tying together
[34:23] everybody right from a justification St
[34:27] of
[34:29] repentance accepting Jesus Christ repent
[34:31] of your sins he cus it to thief on the
[34:34] cross now the thief on the cross didn't
[34:37] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[34:39] right come on because the Holy Ghost not
[34:41] been given yet because the man with an
[34:44] in was hanging there right he went to
[34:47] heaven on the basis of his confession
[34:54] right not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:56] because he didn't receive it right all
[34:59] right but you see then that's where we
[35:01] need to understand that we need to just
[35:03] simply get down and believe
[35:06] God Amen right that's right but see we
[35:09] got so super duper revelated until we're
[35:11] not in that realm anymore you know oh
[35:14] that's just the old days teaching show
[35:16] me work the old days
[35:18] right let's read what we around saids
[35:21] about it see whether it's old days or
[35:22] new days and let's see what he had to
[35:24] say about it go ahead brother
[35:30] let's just read what he had to say about
[35:31] it from Christ the Myster of God
[35:32] revealed you don't ask you he while back
[35:34] to to uh read that message you know it'
[35:39] be good to study it but look what he
[35:43] says you see people as I said they say
[35:46] brother brandom Le the new birth this
[35:48] way and then he change it this way well
[35:49] now here he is in
[35:51] 1964 802
[35:54] 1964 preaching the future home
[35:57] and we're going to read two places where
[35:59] he
[36:01] said that he taught three
[36:03] processes from the beginning that's
[36:07] right all right see then he preached the
[36:10] world in three process he preached the
[36:13] the Regeneration of the world in three
[36:15] proc the Regeneration of man in three
[36:17] processes
[36:19] right but see what it is people don't
[36:21] have I'm just honest now you forgive me
[36:24] why would anybody say that that it it's
[36:26] not the new birth this way when brother
[36:28] R would say it
[36:30] was why don't you hear him say look this
[36:33] what I got to
[36:34] saying right that brother R
[36:37] says if your sins are remitted at
[36:40] justification and you die right
[36:43] there that's the thief on the cross
[36:45] experience and you're going to heaven
[36:48] that's
[36:50] right but then need turn around and say
[36:52] you must have the baptism of the Holy
[36:54] Ghost to be in the Kingdom
[36:57] no problem not with me anyway amen
[37:01] because I can see and I know what
[37:03] happened to me back
[37:05] there and I told you about it I saw God
[37:08] when I was about 11 years old I saw that
[37:11] that didn't save me
[37:14] right
[37:17] no but one day I come to the bases I had
[37:20] to get over and I explained it Sunday
[37:22] there to you I had to get over the
[37:24] church to be able to get to God
[37:27] to be able to get saved because they was
[37:29] telling me how to be saved
[37:32] when their salvation wasn't what I
[37:35] wanted right cuz I wanted something that
[37:38] would save me instead of me going on and
[37:41] living like the devil like everybody
[37:42] that there was doing you know and I
[37:44] don't mean everybody there were good
[37:45] people there and you know that but you
[37:47] know what I'm talking
[37:48] about look what your Prophet had to say
[37:51] about it
[37:54] now 1964 and 802 paragraph 77 to 78 on
[37:59] this and notice how God makes plain to
[38:01] us his Plan of
[38:03] Redemption they talk about the world
[38:06] now but then he's explaining the new
[38:08] birth to you and I because he said it's
[38:11] the same thing same for each one all
[38:13] right just thrilled my soul when I saw
[38:15] how he makes plain to us here now his
[38:18] Plan of Redemption now compare what we
[38:21] see with our own eyes what God has done
[38:23] it to redeem his world he's done the
[38:25] same plan to redeem his people for the
[38:28] unchangeable god changes not in any of
[38:30] his plans or anything such a glorious
[38:33] thing how he led us to himself to a
[38:36] Tabernacle in Us by three stages of
[38:39] Grace just like he's led the world in
[38:42] three stages you know what he went
[38:44] through you've been through the future
[38:45] home the world was justified by the
[38:48] washing of the water and the Noah and
[38:50] Sanctified when Jesus dropped his blood
[38:51] upon it and one day it will receive a
[38:54] fiery baptism to cleanse it and
[38:56] everything but but it was
[38:58] claimed it was claimed back there when
[39:00] when he stepped upon this Earth all
[39:02] right just like he led the world in
[39:04] three stages to come to the world as God
[39:06] will come to the world after it's gone
[39:08] through three different stages of
[39:11] purification that's exactly how he comes
[39:13] to us through through three stages of
[39:15] Grace I taught that at the beginning
[39:17] I've never changed since it's God's word
[39:21] right see then why would man come along
[39:23] go ahead with the next come along and
[39:25] try to tell us that brother around
[39:27] change this and change that well I want
[39:29] to know where changed
[39:31] it right you know I mean I just like to
[39:34] know where he changed
[39:35] today well you just can't you're just
[39:38] not spiritual enough I agree with you
[39:41] I'm just not spiritual enough to receive
[39:43] false
[39:44] Doctrine I'm
[39:46] sorry maybe if that's what you call it
[39:48] forgive me look what he goes over
[39:50] paragraph 86 out the future home notice
[39:52] how God makes it plain to us and if that
[39:55] wasn't a great confirmation of good a
[39:58] great loving blessing from God when I
[40:00] see this and see that sense a boy first
[40:04] time ever Christ dealt with me I've
[40:06] always taught those three stages of
[40:08] Grace notice if it it isn't true now now
[40:13] the first step is what repentance toward
[40:16] God all right and then follows after
[40:19] that is water baptism repent and be
[40:22] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see
[40:24] water baptism followers showing that
[40:27] repentance was genuine are to remit our
[40:30] P sins that has nothing to do with
[40:33] future
[40:35] sin watch
[40:37] you it only remits repent and be
[40:40] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[40:42] what far remission taking away of P sins
[40:45] has nothing to do with the future just
[40:47] your sins have been chopped off what you
[40:50] did now I love this one you can't repent
[40:53] for what Adam
[40:55] done
[40:57] everybody blames Adam they blame
[41:00] Eve they blame the
[41:04] devil right well what's he say you can't
[41:08] repent for what Adam done you never done
[41:11] it Adam did you just get forgiveness of
[41:13] what you done the old nature is still
[41:16] there so now on justification what's he
[41:19] talking
[41:23] about that old nature of mankind
[41:26] is still living in us at justification
[41:29] when you repent of your
[41:32] sins see how where you would go wrong if
[41:34] you took it totally that the fact that
[41:37] you just repented I accepted a you know
[41:40] Baptist Doctrine not throwing off on
[41:42] them but that's just their Doctrine or
[41:45] the issue of saying well you know I
[41:47] believe what do you
[41:51] believe what do you mean what I
[41:54] believe I I believe Jesus Christ died
[41:56] for my sins well the history book says
[41:59] he did
[42:02] right right come
[42:04] on the history book says he died they
[42:08] said he was
[42:10] crucified right is that the point that
[42:13] it's talking about is that what we need
[42:15] to be
[42:16] saved is it just to believe that he was
[42:20] and what he
[42:21] done no it's to believe that he is what
[42:24] he's doing now amen the prophet just
[42:27] showed us right there he said don't you
[42:29] ain't no need of us repenting for what
[42:31] Adam done he said we never done it well
[42:35] if it had been for Adam and Eve we
[42:36] wouldn't be in this ja like my brother
[42:39] my brother's Methodist preacher he told
[42:41] me one time he said God made me a sinner
[42:44] how can he condemn me for sinning well
[42:46] you know he's right if God made him out
[42:48] way come on if God made him that way
[42:52] he's
[42:53] right if God made him a sinner he can't
[42:55] condemn for being a sinner so I simply
[42:58] told him no no he didn't make you that
[43:01] way you made yourself one right I said
[43:05] because that that wouldn't be God he
[43:07] can't create
[43:09] evil and do those things that's right
[43:11] but you see what he said
[43:13] now see justification just chops off
[43:17] your P sins right it does nothing to
[43:20] your
[43:22] nature it does nothing to your future
[43:24] point we're not Catholicism to believe
[43:27] in being able to pay before we
[43:31] do you
[43:34] know but are you following
[43:37] me the old nature is still there right
[43:40] all you done is just repented right all
[43:44] you done just got rid of a load of sin
[43:47] amen
[43:49] all but you know we repent for being a
[43:54] sinner now come on listen to what I'm
[43:55] saying saying all
[43:59] right we shouldn't repent for for what
[44:02] we now listen what I'm saying
[44:05] please you accept Jesus Christ as your
[44:07] savior you repent for what you done
[44:09] right right all right come on now you
[44:12] repent for what You' done you believe
[44:13] God forgive you
[44:15] right what are you doing now still
[44:17] repenting for what you
[44:23] done that song you know I don't p
[44:26] Doctrine on the song but it's says what
[44:28] sins are you talking
[44:31] about see we're repenting for what we
[44:34] used to
[44:36] be well that would be repent for what
[44:39] Adam
[44:41] done
[44:43] right get what I'm talking about I I
[44:46] don't like the life that I liveed no and
[44:49] I'm definitely sorry for the life that I
[44:52] lived as a sinner amen right but I asked
[44:56] him to forgive me and I believe he
[45:00] did the reason I believe he did is
[45:03] because he gave me the baptism of the
[45:04] Holy Ghost
[45:07] all so then if you ever want to know
[45:09] whether you whether you've been fully
[45:12] you know your repentance was genuine and
[45:14] God accepted it just get the baptism of
[45:17] the Holy
[45:18] Ghost and you know watch you can't get
[45:20] it until you
[45:23] do that's why they they went it was
[45:26] there there was only 120 received the
[45:28] baptism of the Holy
[45:30] Ghost why didn't the world get
[45:34] it when Jesus died and the Holy Ghost
[45:36] fell why didn't he fall on
[45:40] everybody go everybody wasn't repentant
[45:44] everybody wasn't cleaned out they wasn't
[45:46] capable of receiving right right you
[45:50] following me so the prophet said it has
[45:52] nothing to do then with your
[45:54] future you just repented for what You'
[45:57] done right right but no repentance for
[46:00] what you're going to
[46:05] do repentance is of what you do right
[46:09] right but it's all based on whether or
[46:11] not you can believe
[46:14] it if you can't believe it then it's not
[46:16] for you remember the man told Brother
[46:18] Brown said I wouldn't believe in Divine
[46:20] Heen no matter what you done he said
[46:21] it's not for
[46:23] you that's right man
[46:26] it's not
[46:27] farting you can't believe it
[46:31] right
[46:33] now you might wonder sometimes why I
[46:36] preach serieses and then keep on going
[46:38] sometime you might order time together
[46:41] and listen CU if you remember when we
[46:43] were back there a few weeks month or two
[46:47] 6 months ago I gu all right when we were
[46:50] talking about the
[46:52] atonement all right you know you know I
[46:56] put a lot of emphasis on the atonement
[46:59] okay you know those people that brought
[47:01] those animals up in that Old
[47:03] Testament and laid them down and put
[47:06] their hands on them the prophet of God
[47:09] said that he they believed when the
[47:11] blood was sprinkling out and splattering
[47:13] all over them as they cut his throat and
[47:14] done the thing that that animal was
[47:17] dying in their
[47:22] place
[47:23] now do you believe Jesus Jesus Christ
[47:26] died in your
[47:30] place no Roman killed my
[47:34] savior no Jew killed my
[47:38] savior my
[47:41] sins is what killed
[47:44] him and if I was the only person in the
[47:48] world he would have still died for
[47:51] me right
[47:53] right are you listening
[47:57] see my sins is what put him on
[48:00] Calvary amen that Roman he didn't kill
[48:03] him he said I have power to lay my life
[48:07] down I have power to take it said I can
[48:12] call 12 Legions of
[48:16] angels and one destroyed the world with
[48:18] Waters
[48:19] wormwood and he could call 12
[48:23] Legions 12,000
[48:29] Angels but he died in my place
[48:33] amen why wouldn't you want to repent of
[48:35] your
[48:36] sins
[48:38] right I mean let all Christianity
[48:42] aside that's hard statement I'm sorry I
[48:45] just carnal way of talking but forgive
[48:47] me just listen let all facts aside that
[48:51] even we would talk about going to heaven
[48:53] or
[48:54] whatever
[48:56] but to think that history can prove
[48:59] Jesus Christ
[49:01] died and he said he was dying for
[49:05] me he's taking my
[49:09] place wouldn't that be
[49:13] something see are we afraid of hell is
[49:16] that the reason we want to be saved come
[49:18] on that's the way people preach
[49:20] it you don't get saved you're going to
[49:22] die in hell and burn
[49:24] eternally come on how many of you come
[49:26] out of denominational churches there's
[49:28] not a one of them that don't teach
[49:30] eternal
[49:32] hell and there's a lot in this message
[49:34] close enough to
[49:38] it but see threatening people to try to
[49:42] get them to be
[49:43] saved scaring them scaring the little
[49:47] kids don't do that
[49:52] right come on I know I'm meddling okay
[49:55] you ain't got enough guts to whip your
[49:57] own child with your with to correct it
[50:00] and then you turn around and place it on
[50:03] that Jesus don't love you cuz you're
[50:05] doing
[50:06] wrong and you're making the kid have a
[50:08] complex towards Jesus you ain't got
[50:11] enough guts to whip it yourself so
[50:14] you're pacifying your
[50:15] own do by putting it off on saying Jesus
[50:18] is mad at
[50:21] you
[50:23] sorry that's just the way I believe
[50:28] listen folks don't try to scare nobody
[50:31] into
[50:32] salvation
[50:36] right you just
[50:41] presented yes but Brother D I can show
[50:43] you where brother brand yes he was a
[50:46] prophet I can tell you where he was a
[50:48] saying he kept on give an order call and
[50:50] he said come on down come on
[50:54] down Jesus is waiting here at the altar
[50:57] for
[50:58] you that's not a scar tactic that's
[51:04] truth that's where he was that night
[51:06] when I saw
[51:07] him standing on the right hand side of
[51:09] the
[51:12] altar see that's not a fear that
[51:16] way to tell him Jesus is waiting on you
[51:20] he said we're going to put a cross up
[51:21] here where when people come down and Bow
[51:25] Down
[51:26] maybe it'll help get their mind
[51:30] on you're Prophet talking like that yeah
[51:34] right cuz he truly was a prophet was he
[51:37] right but are you following me amen you
[51:40] don't have anything to do with the
[51:43] future justification repentance just
[51:45] chops that off amen right Naturally by
[51:49] chopping off your
[51:51] sins you want to go to
[51:54] church
[51:56] right see when I repented my first
[51:59] thoughts
[52:01] was if I'm going to believe in God which
[52:03] I knew about knew God was real but if
[52:06] I'm going to believe the way that people
[52:08] I need to read the
[52:10] Bible so I set out to read
[52:15] it and I I set out to read the Bible not
[52:18] to get a gold star I didn't care about
[52:20] that my point was I wanted to to know
[52:24] about him amen
[52:27] amen you know he was good to
[52:30] me and he he allowed me to to be able to
[52:33] read his word what about
[52:35] that and I read about all of his
[52:37] goodness and the things but I read about
[52:39] the things the way he was how straight
[52:41] he was and when this Prophet began to
[52:43] talk about it I didn't have any trouble
[52:45] believing
[52:46] it when he began to tell how that God
[52:50] that those Jews were so you know so tied
[52:52] up in their own religion they wouldn't
[52:54] have D wrote that they Abraham lied and
[52:56] all of that he said but God made him do
[53:00] it brother Brandon began to talk about
[53:03] how that in his own life that he even
[53:04] wanted to smoke he wanted to drink he
[53:06] wanted to do those
[53:08] things and God wouldn't let
[53:12] him those things touch me when I heard a
[53:14] man talk about a
[53:17] God that I knew had to be real somewhere
[53:21] right amen
[53:23] amen but if you ever to that contact
[53:26] that that point of even thinking about
[53:28] God being
[53:31] real that's why it says he that believe
[53:33] that he that come to God must believe
[53:35] that God is words he is he's he's
[53:39] real
[53:41] right see then accept him as your
[53:44] savior yes but Brother D I claimed
[53:47] salvation 40 years ago I I've been in
[53:50] this message 50 years that don't have
[53:52] nothing to do with it right I CLA
[53:55] salvation from the time I was 18 years
[53:57] old in the Baptist Church and at 23
[53:59] years old I was an ordained
[54:01] Deacon teaching adult Sunday School
[54:04] classes and the
[54:07] things that's what they thought of
[54:11] me but you see when I come in this
[54:15] message and I saw God the way the
[54:18] prophet was talking about it and
[54:20] salvation the way he was talking about
[54:22] it I realized what i' done
[54:25] I had repented of my
[54:27] sins I had asked God to forgive me and I
[54:30] had set out and got baptized course it
[54:32] was wrong but still you know as quick as
[54:35] I could I got it done
[54:37] right but I had it father son Holy Ghost
[54:40] like most everybody else sitting here
[54:41] and had you
[54:43] know but I done that and I went to
[54:47] church it was never a concern whether or
[54:49] not we went to church from the day my
[54:51] wife and I married it was never a
[54:53] concern where we was going to church or
[54:54] not that's
[54:56] right that didn't make any
[54:59] difference we were
[55:01] there I didn't have to come in this
[55:03] message and learn how to pay tith
[55:07] on I done it when in the Baptist
[55:11] Church and making anywhere from $42 to
[55:14] about finally went to a job making about
[55:17] $90 you
[55:20] know thought I was rich and went to gent
[55:22] Motors making about 120 man things going
[55:29] good but you
[55:31] see something was dealing with
[55:37] me and when I seen what this Prophet was
[55:40] talking about the new birth I knew not
[55:42] real quick I didn't have the baptism of
[55:44] the Holy Ghost he was talking
[55:46] about I had a great understanding of the
[55:49] Bible I studied it I didn't read
[55:52] everything else I read the Bible
[55:56] I studied
[56:00] it I could look up scriptures and talk
[56:02] about the
[56:05] kingdom I remember striking me one day
[56:07] when I was reading it about when when
[56:09] they said something and Jesus said Thou
[56:11] Art the way you know they said to him
[56:13] said Thou Art the way the truth and the
[56:16] lie and I thought what does that word
[56:18] way
[56:20] mean you know I got the best I could do
[56:22] with a
[56:23] Concordance
[56:25] and they begin to look up the way you
[56:27] know and I found out there's a lot about
[56:29] that in the Bible I I probably one of
[56:31] these days I get around I'll preach on
[56:32] him but you
[56:34] know there was a lot behind that little
[56:37] word way right but you see it's because
[56:40] I wanted to know about
[56:42] God I told you I'll just talk to you
[56:45] some I wanted to know about God right I
[56:49] wanted to know about him as a as a God
[56:51] not to to just know that he was God
[56:55] or existed somewhere in a in a realm way
[56:58] up above you know and how we all were
[57:00] and talk that God you remember the
[57:02] little boy wanted to know if you could
[57:03] see God and went to his mama and his
[57:06] Sunday school teacher and his pastor and
[57:08] none of them couldn't tell him about
[57:10] seeing God the old fisherman finally
[57:12] told him said all I've seen all my life
[57:14] has been God you know the old man had
[57:17] had an
[57:18] experience
[57:19] right and see I believe I walked in a
[57:22] Sanctified State because I remember that
[57:24] when when the things that I used to do
[57:26] would go away from
[57:28] me and you know but when I saw this
[57:33] prophet and heard him talking about the
[57:34] baptism of the Holy
[57:36] Ghost and knew right then I needed
[57:39] that well what do you mean you believe
[57:41] the message you believed he was a
[57:42] prophet yes sir I've told you
[57:46] before under a Justified or somewhere
[57:49] stay in there I read the Bible when I
[57:51] come to Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I told
[57:54] my wife they would be two prophets come
[57:57] before the end of the
[58:00] world that's how I believe the
[58:03] word when brother Mo began to talk to me
[58:05] about it he said I said where do you get
[58:08] this at about a prophet he said Malachi
[58:11] 4 I said okay explain Malachi
[58:15] 3 I hit a man that was gracious enough
[58:17] could explain it am he explained John
[58:20] the Baptist and showed me Luke 11:17 all
[58:22] of the things you know the scripture
[58:25] well how could I argue with a man about
[58:26] what he was to say and when I had talked
[58:29] many years before about that to see it
[58:32] in the word it looked like two prophets
[58:34] would
[58:36] come you see I believed God's
[58:39] word I still believe it I believe it's
[58:42] God speaking to
[58:44] us all right but if you ever been
[58:47] condemned or did you just go to church
[58:52] somewhere or was you raised in the
[58:54] message
[58:55] right that's where my kids my
[58:58] grandkids raised in this
[59:00] message cutting their teeth on the pews
[59:03] here that don't save them amen they got
[59:07] to have their own experience with
[59:10] God not just because Daddy's the pastor
[59:14] right
[59:16] right you see and that that way that's
[59:19] why I stand the way I
[59:22] do but repentance is just simply we
[59:24] saying I'm
[59:28] sorry and I'll turn
[59:32] around but now if it has nothing to do
[59:35] with your
[59:36] future and it doesn't drive the unclean
[59:38] Spirit out of your
[59:39] justification tur it around is one good
[59:42] thing that's right you turned around
[59:44] started in another
[59:46] Direction but about 2 weeks later you
[59:48] going to turn back
[59:50] around
[59:52] right you may be going to church church
[59:54] but you're going to turn back around the
[59:56] other
[59:58] way cuz the devil the prophet said you
[1:00:01] ever say you're a Christian he said the
[1:00:02] devil turns every gun he's got on you
[1:00:04] right he's going to try you to make sure
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:11] right you see
[1:00:13] then he that endureth to the
[1:00:16] end the Bible says shall be
[1:00:20] saved he that goes
[1:00:23] on
[1:00:25] but see in this day and age now get what
[1:00:27] I'm saying before we can move on in this
[1:00:28] day and age to to repent of your sins is
[1:00:31] not the new birth
[1:00:35] right but now you see you take people in
[1:00:37] the message then they're hunting for
[1:00:39] something they're
[1:00:41] searching like in the old days when we
[1:00:43] didn't have the computers to run up
[1:00:45] things I never have looked it up since
[1:00:46] then either but they used to condemn me
[1:00:49] and brother Mo call we had a flat top
[1:00:52] haircut and they told us that that was
[1:00:55] wrong another
[1:00:57] devil you know flat top haircut brother
[1:01:01] Mo said Brother D you've been looking
[1:01:02] for thing I said
[1:01:04] no ain't concerned about it I said
[1:01:10] because I don't think a flat top hardcut
[1:01:13] is going to keep you out you know I'm
[1:01:17] just going to go on wearing my flat top
[1:01:19] well it wouldn't long now till I've got
[1:01:21] a good one it just keeps going backwards
[1:01:23] you know and it's getting flatter cuz
[1:01:26] getting less of
[1:01:28] it but I'm not throwing off on somebody
[1:01:30] that believes
[1:01:32] that but why would you want to believe
[1:01:34] that to be your
[1:01:36] salvation I got to Hur okay let me get
[1:01:39] off go pull up the last part of that
[1:01:41] from brother
[1:01:42] Joe brother R in the future home that's
[1:01:44] why I'm ask you the last part of number
[1:01:46] two which is paragraph
[1:01:48] 90 that's why I've asked you to go to
[1:01:50] the Future home and study
[1:01:52] it just study it over and over over and
[1:01:54] over cuz he said in there he said if I
[1:01:57] don't get the Plan of Salvation you he
[1:01:59] said if I don't get nothing but the Plan
[1:02:00] of Salvation let me get
[1:02:02] that him preaching the change of a world
[1:02:04] and a world to go to and a place you
[1:02:06] know and know but look what he said now
[1:02:08] when you are asked are you're forgiven
[1:02:11] of your sins you've only done this now
[1:02:14] you remember what he's done up there
[1:02:15] he's draw two
[1:02:17] hearts one of them's got a snake in it
[1:02:19] the other one's got a dove in it now I
[1:02:22] believe that that was the same heart you
[1:02:24] can believe what you want to about it CU
[1:02:27] why would you want to take the snake out
[1:02:28] and leave the dove in the other one when
[1:02:31] you don't deal with that one that you
[1:02:32] took the snake out of right you know he
[1:02:35] didn't put a dove over in the one you
[1:02:37] take the snake out
[1:02:39] of come
[1:02:41] on so didn't want to do it cuz that's
[1:02:43] what he's explaining see he said one of
[1:02:47] got the dove in which is the Holy Spirit
[1:02:49] and he's got a life the other one has
[1:02:51] malice hatred he's got a life too all
[1:02:54] right so what's he saying now when
[1:02:56] you're asked and you're forgiven of your
[1:02:57] sins you've only done this now he draw
[1:03:00] lines in I representing sin and he just
[1:03:03] erased them
[1:03:06] lines that was representing sin
[1:03:10] H he taken that away but the thing that
[1:03:13] made you do it is still there
[1:03:16] Snake unclean Spirit that's the old root
[1:03:19] of evil that's still there notice when
[1:03:21] you repent and are baptized in the name
[1:03:22] of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of
[1:03:25] your sins all the snake is still in
[1:03:28] there the thing that caused you to do it
[1:03:31] is still
[1:03:32] there and then you better keep repenting
[1:03:35] at that stage
[1:03:38] right see at that stage you better
[1:03:41] repent every
[1:03:42] day and Paul even got up to where he was
[1:03:44] at in his life and he said I Die daily
[1:03:47] that's a man after the baptism of the
[1:03:49] Holy Ghost and sitting in a pretty good
[1:03:52] place but are you following me amen look
[1:03:54] at what he's saying let's get a few now
[1:03:56] to get them out of the
[1:03:58] way and then
[1:04:00] we'll you know carry on maybe Sunday on
[1:04:04] the sanctification but look what he says
[1:04:06] on the manifestation of the spirit
[1:04:09] 19501
[1:04:11] 717 or
[1:04:15] E21 now how do you get saved let's take
[1:04:18] it in a childlike form where every
[1:04:21] believer no matter if you're what church
[1:04:24] you belong to and your pastor if he's a
[1:04:27] right man he will tell you that that you
[1:04:31] can only be Sav through faith now if a
[1:04:34] man really right that's what he'll tell
[1:04:36] you all right not through Works through
[1:04:39] faith now you believe that he saved you
[1:04:43] now the first thing that comes from the
[1:04:45] heart you believe it then you walk up
[1:04:48] and confess it say I accept Jesus as my
[1:04:51] personal savior I believe he saved me
[1:04:54] there's not a physical thing in the
[1:04:56] world that you could prove what there's
[1:04:59] not a physical thing in the world to
[1:05:01] prove that you're
[1:05:03] saved now why does everybody want signs
[1:05:06] and wonders and things or or speaking in
[1:05:08] tongues or or whatever to be in evidence
[1:05:11] of the Holy Ghost look what he's saying
[1:05:14] there's not a physical thing in the
[1:05:15] world that you could prove that you're
[1:05:17] saved your eyes are the same color got
[1:05:21] the same shirt on you had on go out
[1:05:24] outside and the old guy say there ain't
[1:05:26] nothing to that but you believe that
[1:05:28] there's something to it don't you all
[1:05:30] right you believe it you believe that
[1:05:33] you're saved you act like you're saved
[1:05:37] you say you're saved and you associate
[1:05:39] with those that are saved and it works
[1:05:43] salvation watch
[1:05:45] it is that right and the same thing will
[1:05:48] take place by Divine Healing you believe
[1:05:50] you're healed you act like he healed you
[1:05:53] you say you're healed and he's the high
[1:05:54] priest of your confession to make good
[1:05:57] anything that you confess that he's done
[1:05:59] before before the father and there it is
[1:06:01] right amen so now you believe
[1:06:05] it you believe you're saved you act like
[1:06:07] you're saved
[1:06:09] right I'm talking just just repentance
[1:06:12] now we're not talking about the New
[1:06:14] Birth we're not talking about the the
[1:06:16] baptism and all of the different things
[1:06:18] we're talking about just repenting of
[1:06:19] your sins
[1:06:21] right you repent of your sins you're
[1:06:23] going back to the bar go back in and get
[1:06:26] drunk again well it didn't bother me
[1:06:28] bless God I got saved last
[1:06:32] night now we don't believe in junk amen
[1:06:38] right God don't go to the bars right
[1:06:41] amen right you don't do with those
[1:06:44] things
[1:06:46] salvation you repented at least you can
[1:06:49] quit to the best you
[1:06:52] can right
[1:06:54] and I'm honest in saying that because I
[1:06:56] realized I was a human I realized my
[1:06:58] life and I
[1:07:01] lived you need help amen that's right
[1:07:05] you talk about Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:07:07] helping you I believe they
[1:07:10] do but you need to hang around people
[1:07:12] that's got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:14] amen that's right quit associating with
[1:07:17] the world and the things quit running
[1:07:19] out there with them right yeah and get
[1:07:22] together with somebody that's got
[1:07:24] something
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:28] amen why because at least you can act
[1:07:31] like
[1:07:32] it look at the next one as I was with
[1:07:35] Moses paragraph 228 19691 in the
[1:07:40] morning remember you can only be saved
[1:07:42] by your personal faith now listen to you
[1:07:46] you can only be healed by your personal
[1:07:48] faith you believe this to be the Bible
[1:07:50] God's word you believe your pastor to be
[1:07:52] a man of God whatever Church you go to
[1:07:56] if you don't you should leave it I like
[1:07:58] that and I'm the guy that's the pastor I
[1:08:01] like that if you don't think this right
[1:08:03] what we do here and what we're doing you
[1:08:05] need to go somewhere else find you a
[1:08:06] place to where that you can agree with
[1:08:08] what's going on I don't mind
[1:08:12] that if you don't you should leave it
[1:08:15] get to a man that is a man of God and if
[1:08:18] you believe him believe he's telling you
[1:08:19] the truth then accept it your own
[1:08:21] personal faith in Christ savor you no
[1:08:24] matter how good your pastor is how Godly
[1:08:29] saintly your mother is how how real the
[1:08:33] word of God is now listen to
[1:08:36] it how much you cry how much you
[1:08:40] pray it's your faith that saves You by
[1:08:43] faith are you saved right it's your
[1:08:47] faith that saves
[1:08:49] you now did Brother brandham not agree
[1:08:52] with crying and praying and all the
[1:08:54] things no he's just simply telling it
[1:08:57] like it is
[1:08:59] right the truth of it all right you can
[1:09:02] do every bit of that and not be saved
[1:09:03] look at the next one which is as I was
[1:09:05] with Moses that's paragraph 228 this is
[1:09:08] paragraph
[1:09:10] 212 by faith you're saved how many knows
[1:09:13] that do many how many many good men
[1:09:17] praise over
[1:09:18] you how many good preachers preaches to
[1:09:21] you you got to have your own personal
[1:09:24] faith for salvation is that right it's
[1:09:27] your own I don't care how many good
[1:09:29] sermons you hear listen to
[1:09:32] it how many good churches you belong to
[1:09:36] it's your own personal faith that saves
[1:09:39] you how loud you cry how much you beg
[1:09:42] how much you scream how much you dance
[1:09:44] in the spirit you're only saved by faith
[1:09:47] is that right that's the only way you're
[1:09:51] healed it comes the same way right right
[1:09:54] all
[1:09:58] right now let's get this point
[1:10:02] here look at Thy word Lord preach 1954
[1:10:06] 221
[1:10:11] e32 now he cannot heal you or cannot
[1:10:14] save you or do one thing for you until
[1:10:18] first you accept it and believe it and
[1:10:21] confess
[1:10:22] it right accept it believe it confess
[1:10:28] it that's right you got to confess it
[1:10:33] not you got to feel it you got to
[1:10:36] confess it he's not the high priest of
[1:10:38] your
[1:10:39] feelings now I'm glad we got the the
[1:10:43] ability to pull these things in and read
[1:10:44] them off you know people say oh I don't
[1:10:47] know where brother random said that or
[1:10:48] not well there it
[1:10:51] is he's not the high priest of your feel
[1:10:53] he said high priest of your confession
[1:10:55] that's right what you confess then you
[1:10:57] go on down through down you never live
[1:11:00] above your
[1:11:02] confession that the sliest every how you
[1:11:04] pronounce that word person in this
[1:11:06] building right now just make it up in
[1:11:08] your mind that you're not a Christian
[1:11:10] anymore that's when you become not a
[1:11:13] Christian
[1:11:14] see don't you're
[1:11:19] confession when you go out and say are
[1:11:21] you a Christian no I used to be but I
[1:11:25] I'm not no more you've fallen from Grace
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] then
[1:11:33] right that's what I said now you take
[1:11:35] that you're going to
[1:11:37] die but listen to what the simple point
[1:11:40] I might want to
[1:11:41] go you could be Saint l or whatever but
[1:11:44] you can't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost and Fall From Grace
[1:11:48] right right God's not an Indian giver he
[1:11:51] doesn't give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:53] Ghost
[1:11:54] and you fall from grace can't be
[1:11:57] done all right brother Mo had a good
[1:12:00] point the way he made his point listen
[1:12:02] he said you can't sin enough to be lost
[1:12:03] if you're born again well natur you
[1:12:06] ain't going to sin anyway cuz God's
[1:12:08] going to take you off the sin whatever
[1:12:10] that's right but you see that way get
[1:12:12] with somebody the prophet says that
[1:12:14] knows what you're talking
[1:12:18] about somebody that's been through
[1:12:20] experiences can tell you how to go
[1:12:21] through other experiences right right am
[1:12:25] MH that's all I do is just tell you what
[1:12:27] I go through right you know what I've
[1:12:30] been through in my life I'm just trying
[1:12:33] my best to tell you what God revealed to
[1:12:35] me when I preached to you the seals the
[1:12:37] the Daniel 70 weeks the the the the
[1:12:39] serieses the things over all these 40
[1:12:41] something years I'm just trying to tell
[1:12:43] you what he's dealing with me
[1:12:45] about cuz that's all I can talk
[1:12:50] about so you ask people to put in their
[1:12:52] own words what brother Brown would say
[1:12:55] about the new birth and they just most
[1:12:56] of them would die they wouldn't be able
[1:12:58] to express it they only can give you
[1:13:01] quotes you know how I love them I love
[1:13:04] to read what he says but if you'll
[1:13:06] notice I said this before I said read
[1:13:09] these
[1:13:10] quotes you're saved by
[1:13:13] Faith by through you're saved by grace
[1:13:16] through faith amen
[1:13:19] amen your confession is what God God is
[1:13:24] acting upon right
[1:13:27] right you say you're saved then you're
[1:13:30] saved right you say you're healed you're
[1:13:35] healed all
[1:13:40] right let's going down
[1:13:47] right let's see we
[1:13:51] Jehovah 195
[1:13:54] 5817 paragraph
[1:13:57] E18 it is only the love of our
[1:14:01] father that loves us so much that he
[1:14:03] sends his word he sends his ministers to
[1:14:06] preach the word then he sends gifts in
[1:14:08] the church into the church with his arms
[1:14:10] spread out trying to get you to believe
[1:14:12] it he wants to heal you tonight a
[1:14:15] thousand times more than you want to be
[1:14:17] healed but do we believe
[1:14:20] that and God wants to heal us a th times
[1:14:23] more than we want to be healed
[1:14:27] right what's
[1:14:32] wrong maybe our confession is not what
[1:14:34] he
[1:14:35] says he says we're
[1:14:39] healed we say maybe we
[1:14:44] are he says he that believeth that God
[1:14:47] is we say yeah history says he
[1:14:51] was you see when it bring out about lay
[1:14:55] that down into your heart sometime think
[1:14:56] about it a lot of our confessions is
[1:14:59] only confessing what brother brandham
[1:15:01] said right that's
[1:15:05] good but I I didn't think that was what
[1:15:08] the scripture
[1:15:13] said I thought the scripture was saying
[1:15:16] what we confess what we believe
[1:15:20] right I thought it was saying that no
[1:15:22] man can all Jesus the Christ except it
[1:15:25] be by the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:28] Ghost right all right but look what he
[1:15:31] goes on to say but you're
[1:15:33] afraid you you go by how you
[1:15:36] feel because you you regarded that you
[1:15:40] live by your
[1:15:42] feelings that's your whole life has been
[1:15:45] wrapped in that but you must get away
[1:15:47] from that and act on God's word not what
[1:15:50] you feel or what you see what God said
[1:15:53] and act on that making confession of
[1:15:57] that confess means to say the same thing
[1:16:00] he's at the right hand of the father
[1:16:01] with his own blood to make
[1:16:04] intercession on your confession he
[1:16:07] cannot do anything for you until first
[1:16:10] you've accepted it and confess it and
[1:16:13] then he can act on it he's the high
[1:16:15] priest of what you confess that he is to
[1:16:19] you he's a high priest of what you
[1:16:22] confess that he is to
[1:16:25] you it's not what he is to everybody
[1:16:28] else right it's what he is to
[1:16:31] you you see what I
[1:16:36] mean but now
[1:16:40] listen as I said a minute
[1:16:44] ago we read about three quotes here and
[1:16:48] I know you'd know that there'd be plenty
[1:16:49] more if we wanted to look them
[1:16:52] up
[1:16:53] that we must
[1:16:56] confess and it won't do us any good
[1:16:58] until we do that's right we've got to
[1:17:01] confess it right we got to say that
[1:17:04] we're saved right we got to say that
[1:17:07] we're healed amen we got to say that our
[1:17:10] sins are
[1:17:11] gone we've got to confess what he
[1:17:14] said where he can come on the scene and
[1:17:17] take care of
[1:17:18] it but you see we've got so revelated
[1:17:21] into the message now to where then
[1:17:23] people are say don't know what you're
[1:17:25] talking about God it's not whether or
[1:17:27] not I accept him whether or not he
[1:17:28] accepts
[1:17:32] me that's Christ mess God reveal if you
[1:17:35] want to read
[1:17:38] it be glad
[1:17:45] to no excuse me future home get it over
[1:17:49] and get it right 64 go to number 10
[1:17:51] Brother Anderson
[1:17:55] Heaven and Earth have met God and man is
[1:17:57] reconciled restored Eden has begun see
[1:17:59] all the curse is
[1:18:00] gone just like all the curse of sin is
[1:18:03] gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see
[1:18:05] you don't accept it it accepts you
[1:18:07] because it's God's
[1:18:09] attribute and that would sound like that
[1:18:11] would be destroying all these other
[1:18:12] quotes that we made that he must make
[1:18:14] you must accept
[1:18:17] him but just remember if he is the high
[1:18:20] priest of our confession yeah
[1:18:23] then we must confess him first before he
[1:18:28] can do anything for us that's right
[1:18:31] agree so then we must must accept
[1:18:38] him then he can accept
[1:18:41] us so now are you following it just read
[1:18:44] it off there and look at
[1:18:47] it if my accepting is not
[1:18:51] correct he he will never accept
[1:18:56] me right right are you reading off the
[1:19:00] screen while I'm
[1:19:01] talking if my acceptance is not
[1:19:05] correct he cannot make intercession upon
[1:19:08] that right that would mean he would save
[1:19:11] me whether I wanted to be saved or not
[1:19:14] right that's not
[1:19:18] true well brother D I just don't I I
[1:19:22] believe in a in a Salvation I I I you
[1:19:25] know the brother so and so
[1:19:27] preach go with brother so and so that's
[1:19:29] all
[1:19:31] right I I just can't follow it that way
[1:19:35] I must follow it in a line to be able to
[1:19:37] fit the scriptures and all the prophet
[1:19:39] has
[1:19:41] said see you must accept him as your
[1:19:43] personal
[1:19:45] savior all right but if my accepting is
[1:19:48] not right it don't matter about what I
[1:19:50] accept right right cuz he ain't going to
[1:19:53] accept me that's
[1:19:55] right but if I confess which means to
[1:19:58] say the same thing he
[1:20:02] said then he's accepting my
[1:20:06] confession and he's accepting me so
[1:20:08] there's nothing wrong with what the
[1:20:09] prophet had to say it's exactly right
[1:20:12] amen right it's not whether you confess
[1:20:14] him or not it's whether he confesses you
[1:20:16] sure why because salvation not whether
[1:20:18] you accept him it's whether he accepts
[1:20:21] you right
[1:20:23] because we just got to going through I
[1:20:25] hope you follow me a
[1:20:27] justification you're not born again
[1:20:30] right you're only confessing unto
[1:20:33] salvation
[1:20:35] right if you die in that place yes
[1:20:38] you're going to heaven but that don't
[1:20:39] mean you're the bride it don't mean you
[1:20:40] have the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:42] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:45] proof your sins are
[1:20:49] gone we got to go we've got to go
[1:20:51] through the stage of sanctification
[1:20:53] talking about it the unclean Spirit
[1:20:54] going out in the things so read the
[1:20:57] future home there what the prophet is
[1:20:58] talking about you see talking about this
[1:21:01] world and what it's got to go
[1:21:04] through but it's already been cleansed
[1:21:06] and climed by the Lord Jesus dropping
[1:21:08] his blood upon
[1:21:09] it it's just waiting on a fiery
[1:21:12] baptism you know these bodies that we
[1:21:14] live in they've done been cleansed
[1:21:18] they've done been
[1:21:21] cleaned right justification and
[1:21:24] sanctification sanctification lays a
[1:21:26] claim on that body that you're living in
[1:21:28] because the unclean Spirit goes
[1:21:31] out and he lays a
[1:21:34] claim it's just
[1:21:36] like you people you got to deed to your
[1:21:42] property worth enough to burn that's all
[1:21:45] it's worth that's
[1:21:48] right there is no such thing as an
[1:21:50] abstract title deed to a land in America
[1:21:54] it would be the Indian that had it
[1:21:56] that's right you said but I had it
[1:21:58] searched back I don't care that's right
[1:22:02] they only search 100 years normal
[1:22:06] inexpensive one search 20
[1:22:08] years to see if anybody got claims on it
[1:22:12] I told you about the home there we used
[1:22:13] to have in Gils we got the house hold up
[1:22:17] we had it dried in had it was fixing
[1:22:19] when was working on the outside I went
[1:22:20] and put in for a loan I had enough money
[1:22:22] to get up to that point went put in for
[1:22:24] a
[1:22:25] loan they said you don't own the
[1:22:29] property I said I've got the
[1:22:31] deed he said but this
[1:22:35] done so we going had to go check it out
[1:22:37] come find out I didn't have a clear Deed
[1:22:39] from the man he had bought the property
[1:22:41] thinking it was a clear
[1:22:42] deed but a man put it up out there in
[1:22:45] the store the original deed was put up
[1:22:47] against the debt that he owed it just
[1:22:50] happened that that man was a friend of
[1:22:51] ours was matter of fact fact was in the
[1:22:53] same
[1:22:54] church and
[1:22:56] uh he said I remember when that man paid
[1:22:59] it off but said we just didn't mark it
[1:23:00] off the Record he marked it off and he
[1:23:03] gave me a
[1:23:04] deed that's all it takes you think you
[1:23:07] got a deed
[1:23:08] okay the only thing we got an abstract
[1:23:11] tit of deed is the eternal
[1:23:13] life that's the only deed I'm concerned
[1:23:16] about anyway whether I got a home or
[1:23:18] what I've got I ain't concerned about
[1:23:20] that is whether or not I got a home in
[1:23:24] glory but he follow me just repentance
[1:23:27] just cleans
[1:23:30] away don't do anything to the Future
[1:23:33] don't even drive out the unclean Spirit
[1:23:35] it just washes away your sinsen right
[1:23:40] amen then your repentance baptized in
[1:23:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:23:45] Bible says for the remission of sins but
[1:23:46] now what the water baptism does not
[1:23:50] remit your sins right right it's an act
[1:23:53] of a good conscience of an outward thing
[1:23:57] water baptism does not and I'll show you
[1:23:59] where brother said it does remit your
[1:24:01] sins but then you take the rest of what
[1:24:03] he
[1:24:06] said the baptism don't remit your sins
[1:24:09] it's an outward work of and it's work in
[1:24:12] a conscious part of you on the inside
[1:24:14] that goes and has it done that's still
[1:24:16] where the the repentance is
[1:24:18] at see because water doesn't repent a
[1:24:21] lot of people went down with come I me
[1:24:23] dry to come up wet and that's all they
[1:24:24] done that's right that's what I told
[1:24:26] that Church of Christ man that time I
[1:24:28] said you believe water baptism under
[1:24:30] regeneration you mean a man just gets
[1:24:32] baptized he
[1:24:34] regenerate I said I'll meet you on Lake
[1:24:36] ler
[1:24:37] Sunday we'll fill the
[1:24:42] kingdom you think that's been a joke and
[1:24:45] not been a joke and I'm in it we'll just
[1:24:48] go down through there and everybody we F
[1:24:49] don't matter they got bikinis on what
[1:24:51] they got on or nothing on what we just
[1:24:52] shove them in the
[1:24:54] water we baptize
[1:24:57] them he just looked at
[1:25:00] me I went on and told him I said first
[1:25:02] off you don't need baptized correctly
[1:25:04] course he didn't like that either
[1:25:06] said I said you're a Church of Christ W
[1:25:09] baptize in his
[1:25:10] name but listen
[1:25:13] Church your baptism is just an outward
[1:25:16] show that something has happened to
[1:25:20] you it doesn't save you it's just sh
[1:25:22] into the world what you believe right
[1:25:24] and then you walk
[1:25:26] on see it is on the form of remittance
[1:25:29] because John's baptism if you think I
[1:25:31] don't know what I'm talking about John
[1:25:33] never baptized under
[1:25:36] repentance right John the Baptist never
[1:25:38] baptized under repentance that's right
[1:25:40] he he only baptized to the name to carry
[1:25:44] it on but in the book of Acts they
[1:25:47] baptize under repentance why because it
[1:25:49] would deal more with the coming forth
[1:25:51] into the body Body of Christ does
[1:25:54] everybody understand that in the book of
[1:25:56] Acts it was coming into repentance was
[1:25:58] going towards the body of Christ to
[1:26:00] where that you could enter their in
[1:26:01] there was no concern up in the Old
[1:26:03] Testament that's why the the John never
[1:26:05] baptized under repentance he just
[1:26:08] baptized because really in a baptismal
[1:26:11] form back there baptism was a the fact
[1:26:14] that most Believers that would be just
[1:26:16] like say I would take all of you out and
[1:26:18] baptize you because you were Believers
[1:26:19] going to this church that's what they
[1:26:21] where the Baptist Point come from right
[1:26:23] and that's why John was baptized in his
[1:26:26] convert some
[1:26:28] time see to to believe on something to
[1:26:31] come but then in the book of Acts it was
[1:26:33] to believe on something that already
[1:26:36] come I hope you understand what I'm
[1:26:38] saying let's
[1:26:39] say
[1:26:41] repentance you simply say Lord I'm
[1:26:44] sorry forgive
[1:26:47] me you've been so good to me yes and
[1:26:51] wouldn't that be something for all of
