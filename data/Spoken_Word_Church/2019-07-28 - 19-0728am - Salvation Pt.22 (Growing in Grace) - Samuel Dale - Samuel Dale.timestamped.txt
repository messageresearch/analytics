[17:24] guide us and keep us in Jesus name and
[17:28] visions too for by grace are you saved
[17:33] through faith and that not of yourselves
[17:36] it is the gift of God amen now let's go
[17:40] to second Peter 3:17
[17:49] is therefore beloved seeing you know
[17:52] these things before beware lest you also
[17:58] being led away with the error of the
[18:00] wicked fall from your fall from your own
[18:04] steadfastness now once how would we keep
[18:08] from doing that because he says it can
[18:10] be done you know be careful it can be
[18:13] done you know since but grow in grace
[18:16] and in the knowledge of our Lord and
[18:19] Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both
[18:21] now and forever you may be seated the
[18:25] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[18:28] the word now we were trying to bring out
[18:36] the last message last couple of messages
[18:39] we've been speaking on basically talking
[18:42] of adoption you know covering how that
[18:47] Paul covers in Galatians that we're all
[18:51] children you know born if you're a
[18:55] born-again believer today you're born to
[18:57] get in Christ and that makes you a baby
[19:00] in Christ it doesn't make us full-grown
[19:03] to just to be born again that's where
[19:07] the problem with people they think they
[19:09] don't know anything about growing in
[19:11] grace and knowledge they just think well
[19:13] I'm born again I got it all well that's
[19:16] not true according to the Bible not true
[19:18] according to the prophets message it
[19:21] only made us babies in Christ and
[19:23] Galatians says that we as been babies
[19:27] then God gives us a tutor which is the
[19:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:33] gives it to us at the new birth all
[19:37] right that makes our soul eternal puts
[19:39] us into the place to where that we can
[19:42] begin to grow in God but it doesn't come
[19:46] all at once it comes over a gradual
[19:49] basis to grow into Israel that was that
[19:53] was there and today will be a review up
[19:56] to a spot and the Lord willing on
[19:58] Wednesday we'll try to get into the
[20:00] statue of a perfect man
[20:02] to try to cover some of those thoughts
[20:04] but just keep these things in mind that
[20:08] ever ever person that is born again now
[20:14] the disciples they were two to three and
[20:16] a half years and when the Holy Ghost
[20:18] fell on them
[20:19] it could position them in the stature of
[20:22] a perfect man into the position with the
[20:25] virtues they did not have the headstone
[20:27] because it had not come yet the prophet
[20:29] said all right so they're up to you know
[20:32] they came to that place but they could
[20:34] teach others and that's what we'll get
[20:36] back to showing Paul and Peter is
[20:38] basically teaching us you know how to
[20:42] grow in grace and knowledge whereas Paul
[20:45] is giving us the scriptural type of a
[20:50] background because being like he was and
[20:53] and all in the depth of his
[20:55] understanding and he'd go back and pick
[20:58] up the things and bring them out here
[21:00] comes Peter along as I keep emphasizing
[21:02] that because I want you to think on it
[21:04] that Peter comes along and he kind of
[21:07] tells you how it's done and what it
[21:10] takes to do the things to grow in grace
[21:13] and knowledge all right so then that's
[21:15] putting us into a position as to be the
[21:18] children of God
[21:19] all right now so we're all born again
[21:22] babies desiring the sincere milk of the
[21:24] word that we may grow thereby we may
[21:27] think we're grown up but you know that's
[21:30] not so in God so no neither trying to to
[21:33] make something out of it that we're not
[21:35] just be what we are we're just a bunch
[21:37] of babies I don't like the v-- call the
[21:41] baby orient me call you a grown baby you
[21:45] know an old baby what do you want me to
[21:49] call you and I'm just I'm satisfied to
[21:51] be called a babe in Christ because
[21:54] that's wonderful as I emphasized there
[21:56] the other day you know the greatest
[21:58] thing in the world could be is to think
[22:00] about being a child of God what an
[22:03] opportunity in life to be is a child of
[22:08] God if he just leaves me as a child I'd
[22:11] be fine you just put me to her I'll
[22:14] still be there
[22:15] they have to go by the grave or
[22:17] something because that I can't reach the
[22:19] position to where I can be changed but
[22:22] that's alright I'll be there mister
[22:25] cleaner used to say you know and say
[22:26] said if I die and go on for you all this
[22:28] beats you up so that's that's a good way
[22:31] of saying this he's no we're gonna beat
[22:33] this up cause he's gonna raise before we
[22:34] do cuz they house the dead has to rise
[22:37] and then you know and we works are alive
[22:40] and remain alright so you understand the
[22:42] point of what we've been driving at
[22:45] Galatians covers in showing that the
[22:48] child is err it's just as much error is
[22:53] is you know as you all the children
[22:57] other signs there much that much error
[22:59] then Romans covers it you know there
[23:02] were hours and joint-heirs all right so
[23:06] then whatever Jesus Christ has that's
[23:08] what we have and just as a baby in
[23:11] Christ we have a great opportunity now
[23:15] remember the story we'll back it up
[23:17] Wednesday a little more but remember
[23:19] that the son as long as he's a son when
[23:23] he's born he's born a son he's a child
[23:26] of God
[23:26] he has eternal life in his soul all
[23:29] right now having that eternal life then
[23:33] that makes him to a place to say you
[23:37] know to cry father and to cry out unto
[23:40] God to want more and to drink the
[23:43] sincere milk of the word alright you
[23:46] know I love the way brother Branham
[23:48] preaches if you ever noticed this even
[23:52] at the Tabernacle you know I kind of
[23:56] watched his stages the way he does
[23:58] things and coming through because that's
[24:00] part of this part of me you know alright
[24:02] but if you'll notice you'll have a
[24:05] series of we call them deep style
[24:08] message you know he's bringing out some
[24:11] some neat things all right and he'll run
[24:15] a series through on that well the next
[24:17] time he comes back by you see him he
[24:20] looks like he just drops back and he's
[24:23] preaching simple to fly you know things
[24:26] and and going from there
[24:29] and that may be preaching the same
[24:31] sermon over going back over it and
[24:34] covering it you know and doing like that
[24:37] and especially when he would go out then
[24:40] he would just preach outside you know a
[24:44] smaller form of the message and not go
[24:47] into the deeper but more he laid it down
[24:49] pretty deep even in the small amount
[24:51] because that's what I've been trying to
[24:54] get you to see that we think we know
[24:56] this we think we know that but you know
[24:59] the new birth was the first message
[25:01] Jesus preached and here we're 50 years
[25:04] down the road after the Prophet left and
[25:07] we're still still talking about the new
[25:08] birth well you know it's still
[25:10] interesting to me might not be to you
[25:13] but it's still I've enjoying it because
[25:15] I'm thinking about my growth development
[25:18] all right so then it goes up into
[25:21] Galatians to pick up to work that the
[25:24] air as long as he's a child and he's
[25:27] born that's how he's more than a son now
[25:30] that son may never come to a full
[25:33] maturity but he's still the son you
[25:38] can't take away his inheritance you see
[25:41] yeah but I read where the Prophet said
[25:42] you know how no inheritance you know
[25:45] well you don't have the full inheritance
[25:49] until you attain unto it right but
[25:55] you're born the child which gives you
[25:58] eternal life and that child if it never
[26:01] reached any adoption or form in the Old
[26:05] Testament it was still a child it still
[26:10] could stay right there with Daddy and
[26:12] mama
[26:13] and in a lot of respects sometimes look
[26:16] like it would be better
[26:17] did you stay with our than to go out as
[26:20] some of them had to and fight out all
[26:22] the enemies you know they were going and
[26:25] they'd been nice to this day well mom
[26:27] and daddy you don't and just let them
[26:29] fear them and took care of them but
[26:32] that's not made for everything he is a
[26:35] God wants his children to grow okay now
[26:38] so you see what I'm what I'm saying I
[26:40] got my notes working
[26:42] kind of follow you she threw the
[26:44] revealing of the word we will find more
[26:48] and more as we go along that it's
[26:50] through the revealing of the word that
[26:53] we're babies drinking the sincere milk
[26:56] of the word it's a growth development
[27:00] you grow by what you eat right naturally
[27:05] speaking we grow as we eat spiritually
[27:09] speaking we grow as we eat what as the
[27:12] word into our hearts and lives and
[27:16] that's what I want to make sure that we
[27:18] follow a point you know before then
[27:21] we'll pick up in the stature of a
[27:23] perfect man as the newborn babes at
[27:26] faith all right but my point has been of
[27:30] one thing on the last couple of messages
[27:33] trying to get us to see the way we are
[27:36] and way everything's working and how
[27:39] that we're not great big old kids we may
[27:42] be it may be like I was in school you
[27:45] know though and we you know back then
[27:49] you didn't go to much well we had a
[27:51] couple old boys in our class that was
[27:53] they were both of them bigger than the
[27:55] teacher they were still in our class
[27:57] like fifth sixth or something you know
[28:00] great and they were still there all
[28:02] right because they they didn't grow too
[28:04] much well all right but those there were
[28:06] still babies so never forget that when
[28:09] we come to her and where you come to
[28:11] read brother Brennan will say see there
[28:13] you come this you're born in a family
[28:15] but said if you don't go you don't have
[28:17] an inheritance now he is not talking
[28:21] about the inheritance of eternal life
[28:25] he's not talking about a certain growth
[28:28] development in Christianity he's talking
[28:31] about the adoption of stages that is to
[28:35] come on and to develop that person to a
[28:39] place that you could be adopted these
[28:41] cars were born into the family that
[28:43] doesn't end it
[28:43] that's where brethren said there's where
[28:45] Pentecost failed thinking that they got
[28:47] everything when they were born again now
[28:50] I've got about five or six quotes laying
[28:53] right here
[28:53] we're brother
[28:54] says the day you're born again he said
[28:57] you got everything you need then he
[29:01] turned around til the Pentecost was
[29:02] their mistake was was what cabbage down
[29:06] on that right see they believed that
[29:11] they got it all oh they were happy
[29:14] rejoicing everything was wonderful and
[29:16] they thought they had everything but
[29:18] they cabbage down on that they didn't go
[29:21] on and grow and they wouldn't listen to
[29:22] him as he was trying to bring the
[29:25] message to him right oh they wanted him
[29:30] with the gifts the signs the wonders and
[29:32] all like that the the things that was
[29:34] going on but they didn't want him when
[29:37] he started preaching the word and what
[29:39] was the preaching a word a lot of time
[29:41] her dress clothes they couldn't even
[29:46] follow their own setup of doctrine or
[29:49] leash you you know what I mean
[29:51] the Azusa Street Pentecost at least or
[29:53] the been born-again Christians well you
[29:56] know but Paul says you need somebody to
[30:00] teach you again see that's what the
[30:05] Prophet was trying to do was to teach
[30:07] them and they loved it up to a degree
[30:09] but then they just back up and that
[30:11] ended that point okay see we can do that
[30:14] point he never said they wouldn't
[30:16] Christians he called them Christians
[30:22] right and I'm glad to find that true you
[30:25] say oh he was just didn't want to hurt
[30:27] her feelings
[30:30] when God told him to say it
[30:32] he didn't care whose feelings got hurt
[30:35] right okay
[30:38] so just leave that out of it to think
[30:39] you know well he pitted it he didn't pet
[30:42] him he laid it down spoke strong and
[30:47] straight but they couldn't swallow what
[30:50] he was saying so he had to move on
[30:53] alright CNN and following that to the
[30:57] word all right now listen
[30:59] so the new birth then makes you a child
[31:02] of God giving you eternal life in your
[31:06] soul but it doesn't put you into the
[31:11] fullness of your inheritance it gives
[31:15] you the right of inheritance to sonship
[31:17] that child is born as I said into a
[31:19] family it had a right of inheritance to
[31:23] certain degrees daddy didn't just take
[31:26] him throw him out they had a certain
[31:28] degrees in certain ways and things you
[31:30] know but yet they didn't go on to their
[31:33] full inheritance of the adoption
[31:36] alysha's okay now that's what we need to
[31:39] do is to think about growing in grace
[31:44] and knowledge eating the word until we
[31:50] become the word all right and what was
[31:53] it the Prophet gain see he says things
[31:56] that you know you said what I just don't
[31:58] know I don't say that we get our own
[32:01] idea of what we think the Bible is
[32:05] saying or the Prophet is saying we get
[32:09] that in their own ideas and then
[32:11] something that said I just don't see why
[32:14] you say it's out of way well you know
[32:16] why cause it was the truth how can you
[32:21] explain to babies you know no I mean our
[32:27] kids come up and eating pretty good was
[32:29] but after a while you know you can give
[32:31] a kid something what he likes that you
[32:34] know well then you take it back away
[32:38] from him and say oh you're not old
[32:40] enough to eat that well it's hard for
[32:42] that little feller to understand it
[32:43] called he liked the taste of it and
[32:46] their doings and that's the way we are
[32:48] in our Christianity but now remember I
[32:53] want to emphasize this point because of
[32:56] that Wednesday in god the problem is not
[33:02] as much
[33:05] how can I say it it's not as much that
[33:08] we have the problems it's not that way
[33:12] God understands that he understands our
[33:16] problems in her ways it's the point that
[33:19] we lack things that's why when we get to
[33:22] it in Peters are where it says talks
[33:25] about faith virtue or knowledge
[33:27] temperance patience gone and only and
[33:29] said he that lacketh these things is
[33:33] blind right he's it like all right the
[33:39] problem with us
[33:40] to me this is way I look at it I look at
[33:43] it them the things that we like we like
[33:46] it you know not only like we we don't
[33:50] have it the word lot all right and
[33:52] season when brother Brandon would come
[33:54] along and preach things to us he would
[33:59] preach knock doors endured I remember
[34:01] that I remember going through those
[34:03] services and you know listening and
[34:07] things like that to doors and doors and
[34:10] he's talking about born-again Christians
[34:13] he says he is the belt with the baptism
[34:16] of the Holy Ghost and he says we got
[34:20] this little place over here he said we
[34:22] got that door closed they said we got
[34:25] this over here and got that door closed
[34:26] well she didn't I have my thoughts it's
[34:34] be into the basis of what that when you
[34:36] receive the baptism with Holy Ghost it
[34:37] ought to clean out everything all right
[34:40] that's true with dr. foolish all right
[34:47] because brother branham when he gets
[34:52] interested in the doors and doors check
[34:54] it listen he don't talk about you being
[34:58] drinking alcohol running around with
[35:00] women lying cheating stealing
[35:04] he's not talking about that he's talking
[35:07] about little things that we don't have
[35:10] enough patience we don't have enough
[35:13] faith we don't have enough this that or
[35:16] the other and he said we have the door
[35:19] closed to keep us from being able to
[35:21] receive those things that are forgot to
[35:24] move into so it's not the point that
[35:27] we've got so much dirty wrong with us
[35:30] it's the point that we're lacking things
[35:34] all right now are you fatherly that's
[35:36] what I've been trying to ask a couple of
[35:38] messages to try to get that point to us
[35:41] all right because see you get into the
[35:45] statue of a perfect man well it comes
[35:47] over to our two patients and in our
[35:52] patients gets pretty thin what well and
[35:56] it was get on those hours of temperance
[35:58] well I don't know tempura better unsaid
[36:02] temperance he says that uncontrollable
[36:05] temper when he's talking about
[36:07] Christians number brother Dale I know
[36:10] because Christians don't have temper oh
[36:17] you got a lot to learn if that's all you
[36:20] know you got a lot to learn about your
[36:23] Christian life if that's all you think
[36:24] that you don't have no temper because
[36:27] when your face gets red that pretty well
[36:30] means you new tempers stirred all right
[36:33] but do you understand now watch what I'm
[36:35] trying to get it run around them into
[36:37] doors and doors serious it takes about
[36:41] 810 or something listen to him he's not
[36:44] talking about the bad sinful things he's
[36:49] not talking about you going to door
[36:51] opening and iris adultery you don't mind
[36:54] or nice you know stealing
[36:59] he's not into that he's into little
[37:04] simple everyday life right see because
[37:12] we take brother branham and we'll read
[37:14] it where he says that when that Holy
[37:16] Ghost comes in he said that burned out
[37:18] everything then the next message he says
[37:23] you get born again you get your true
[37:26] credit he said and and we got a little
[37:29] bitterness we got a little this or we
[37:32] got a little that now don't forget my
[37:36] point you'll see when I get over in the
[37:40] message and you blank out and you can't
[37:42] remember the point don't forget to point
[37:44] brother branham on those doors in doors
[37:47] is not talking about that you're a
[37:49] born-again Christian in the body of
[37:52] Christ but yet you still commit adultery
[37:55] you still lie cheat and steal and things
[37:58] cuz that's him little compartments that
[38:00] we know no he's not talking like that
[38:09] he's talking about the little bitty
[38:12] foxes that the Bible says that spoils
[38:16] the vine he's talking about this and we
[38:21] can we can put that into a basis and try
[38:24] to move it around and we can say and
[38:27] there's a truth to it it's no longer I
[38:29] this that's bother it's the Spirit
[38:31] that's within me that spirit is is doing
[38:36] these things
[38:37] alright that's true but remember the
[38:40] doors and doors is not the spirit the
[38:43] doors endures is in the soul see you say
[38:50] well brother Dale you know boys just
[38:52] easy it's hard this can be to try to
[38:55] preach the truth then a doctrinal issue
[38:59] or a thing of two souls or something
[39:02] like ads not too hard for you but when
[39:05] you get down to the nitty-gritty of
[39:07] where we're living out you know to where
[39:11] that we see
[39:12] we've got these problems because if we
[39:16] don't have the virtues we like the
[39:20] virtues right and if we lack them and
[39:25] don't have them we're going to be
[39:28] responsible for that because God has
[39:31] given us the time and the message to
[39:37] bring forth these things to show us all
[39:40] right what's the a baby like I always
[39:43] say you know you got the little baby
[39:45] it's standing there about two three
[39:47] years old
[39:47] it's got cookie all over his face and
[39:50] it's got one in each hand and you say
[39:52] did you get that cooking my uh uh uh no
[39:58] will you say well that little are well
[40:03] how does God look at our little time
[40:07] maybe he looks at us sometimes and said
[40:09] that little our you know especially when
[40:13] so I said well I got no problems well I
[40:17] ain't got no problems what's the trouble
[40:19] why are we still here let's see a baby
[40:25] it is a baby now don't misunderstand
[40:30] this illustration but a baby is expected
[40:34] to be a baby right now in Christianity
[40:39] don't say it's expected to be no now
[40:44] we're the one who's caused the problem
[40:46] whether you want to talk about your body
[40:48] your spirit your soul or whatever I'm a
[40:50] unit
[40:53] and I have troubled little brother down
[40:57] you have problem you know we're human as
[41:01] long as we're in this brother Brown said
[41:03] we'll be a what he said will be a
[41:06] sticker
[41:07] well one time he says everything's gone
[41:10] it's all out everything gone ah dude and
[41:13] the next message you say or maybe in
[41:15] that same message you said see there see
[41:18] we just a bunch of babies and said we'll
[41:19] be a sticker until we're changed well
[41:23] see we can come up and try to to smooth
[41:28] that out by saying it's in the spirit
[41:30] realm and I'm the one that backed for
[41:32] all the years has talked it like that
[41:34] true because I believe it I believe we
[41:38] have trouble in our spirit realm right
[41:40] let's see as Christians born-again
[41:44] believers babies we have trouble in that
[41:47] soul because remember the virtues is not
[41:52] to divert shoes as we'll get to it later
[41:54] faith virtue or not that's a birth in
[41:57] the soul the new birth is not a birth in
[42:00] your body or your spirit the new birth
[42:03] is the birth of the soul all right so
[42:07] you're not born to get in your body not
[42:09] morning any spirit you're born again in
[42:11] your soul all right see in Satan tries
[42:15] to come back
[42:17] no no that's what we were saying them
[42:19] now to you right now what would you call
[42:22] it what would you call it and you have a
[42:25] little problem that's where I try my
[42:29] best to explain something and get into
[42:32] trouble with it trying to explain a
[42:34] Christian life but yet can still have
[42:37] problems that's been the hardest thing
[42:40] for me to try to get across to all of us
[42:42] all of us to where we can see that it
[42:46] takes place like that right the word we
[42:53] have little problems see then what do
[42:56] you need the statue a perfect man for if
[42:58] you don't have problems we're gonna find
[43:02] more of ever that it's a lack of these
[43:04] things it's lack of the point of letting
[43:09] God lead us do you understand our
[43:12] childish things he knows all about our
[43:18] lives in time and he knows that we can't
[43:21] conquer sight don't you ever think you
[43:23] can you ever think you can conquer Satan
[43:27] or Satan don't bother he's already got
[43:29] you he's not bothering you he's got you
[43:33] that's what a man told me at work diner
[43:36] he said I'm working on commanding the
[43:38] Lord's that ain't working I mean commit
[43:40] you're commanding the Lord ain't working
[43:42] on command in the devil I doesn't got
[43:44] him under control I just said it so long
[43:47] buddy we didn't have much more to talk
[43:51] about because if he was that way and he
[43:55] gave me scripture the Bible says command
[44:01] Jimmy
[44:03] now what if somebody comes up to you
[44:05] tell the Bible says for us to command
[44:08] the Lord the userís command you that
[44:10] doesn't mean command like you demand
[44:12] that means if you ask god here's a plain
[44:16] old simple illustration if you ask God
[44:18] for something you need to have patience
[44:22] wait on him to fulfill it
[44:24] right it's just waiting on him the
[44:27] fullfilling do what he wants to all
[44:29] right okay
[44:31] trying to get to the point of what we're
[44:33] talking about see there's were babies
[44:37] the Prophet done the most marvelous
[44:40] thing I mean to me he could explain
[44:44] things and that's where I've tried to
[44:46] emphasize that over and over and over
[44:48] where he says when you're a born-again
[44:50] Christian he said it's like that you
[44:55] have a little spot about the size of
[44:57] this little white button see we say oh
[45:02] my soul is completely full of the Holy
[45:05] Ghost who were you that make you God
[45:13] that would not make you you that would
[45:17] make you God if God is so full like we
[45:20] think of us being so full of the Holy
[45:22] Ghost but yet it's the truth that what
[45:31] we have in us is eternal life and we try
[45:36] to make a button out of it or something
[45:38] that's ways of expressing it it's not
[45:46] the here's your soul is here and right
[45:48] over here is all this eternal cause
[45:50] that's all see we get into all
[45:54] philosophies and us call it philosophies
[45:57] because we get in their own ideas about
[46:00] something that is saying and that's
[46:02] where the trouble is with the Bible sin
[46:04] done I mean I can prove to you in the
[46:06] Bible that you baptize the name Father
[46:09] Son and Holy Ghost that's right it's in
[46:12] the Bible right
[46:18] but-but-but-but now now that's not now
[46:22] you're trying you're having to
[46:26] interpolate your thoughts into the
[46:30] subject to word that you're coming up
[46:33] too well Lord Jesus Christ his father
[46:36] son holy college now you're getting it
[46:42] right what you came to now the Bible
[46:45] says father son Holy Ghost if you do
[46:48] then you got a problem of your own it
[46:51] said that we got to let the Holy Ghost
[46:56] in interpret that to us and bring it out
[47:01] to where that we can see that father son
[47:03] Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus cross and I
[47:07] heard the prophets seen that about water
[47:09] baptism and that's the way I baptized to
[47:11] baptize when you first order about ties
[47:14] you in the name of the Father and of the
[47:17] Son and of the Holy Ghost I say it never
[47:21] baptism what I say to do that I must
[47:25] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[47:27] Jesus Christ that's the only wearing
[47:30] baptized according to Matthew 28:19
[47:33] it's the baptized in the name of the
[47:35] Lord Jesus Christ right this is it gets
[47:40] to be where it gets clear all right but
[47:44] see you don't have any problems of life
[47:47] and then you wonder what causes that
[47:56] well you know I thought something wrong
[47:59] we're not talking about adultery so
[48:00] we're not talking about stealing lying
[48:02] cheating them I mean the Christian is
[48:05] not supposed to do them times if the we
[48:08] do them things we ain't a Christian
[48:13] Right see but now small things you say
[48:19] well are are you trying to justify the
[48:21] things that we do a little time no I'm
[48:24] trying to get us to find out we got them
[48:27] then we find out we got them then we can
[48:30] do something about them if you don't
[48:34] believe you got them that's a bad way to
[48:35] say god I'm against but if you don't
[48:37] believe you got the problem then you
[48:39] won't never work on the problem brother
[48:46] Dale here he's got some little little
[48:49] small something that he does I agree we
[48:54] but I look back at you and say you've
[48:57] got little things that you did that you
[49:00] don't need to do now you gonna tell me
[49:05] you don't then we're gonna go to the
[49:07] Prophet and we're gonna pick it out or
[49:09] what he's saying he said do we backslide
[49:14] he said every day
[49:17] so do we sin he said every day well he
[49:22] meant he meant that for y'all not for
[49:25] himself okay that's fine with me
[49:29] I don't agree with it but that's fine
[49:31] with me it's still right because we have
[49:36] problems every day in their everyday
[49:38] life all right you tell me why that
[49:45] prophet said that about that fellow you
[49:47] know it's picking on him in that cafe or
[49:49] something no one telling him he was
[49:51] William Bryan was so much wrong and all
[49:53] like that some of the other started he
[49:54] said no said I he said I wanted him
[49:56] myself now you tell me he wasn't a human
[50:00] that's what caught me what caught me was
[50:05] not a man that was so great until he
[50:07] never done nothing home he just won't so
[50:10] though this isn't there were nothing no
[50:13] well caught me was the man telling all
[50:15] that code I could read the Bible the
[50:19] Bible told me about Abraham at lied and
[50:21] give his wife away and and they come up
[50:24] with a son and his son farted right in
[50:25] his footsteps
[50:26] you said well that was boars born in
[50:28] that's true
[50:30] so we don't go around giving a wise way
[50:34] right but sometimes we might think about
[50:39] it
[50:40] oh now brother Dale I'm simply trying to
[50:51] illustrate okay you tell me and I'm not
[50:57] telling it right I'm just gonna life in
[51:00] your face you say well I don't never
[51:01] have no problem it's like I've always
[51:03] said I wouldn't care for my wife to know
[51:05] my thoughts all day long that I think if
[51:09] you just remember the one thought that
[51:12] followed everything I love her she's my
[51:16] wife
[51:17] that solves that problem
[51:20] all those words and thoughts in your
[51:22] mind at the end of the day ended up by
[51:25] saying I love you might solve a lot of
[51:29] problems that's the last thing we do
[51:31] when we go to bed I love you like I've
[51:37] always said you're not human though like
[51:40] I've always saying even if you got it
[51:42] going honey I love you you know okay you
[51:52] get what I'm talking about I'm talking
[51:56] about being a Christian I'm talking
[51:59] about the way your prophet was
[52:01] explaining a Christian life that in the
[52:07] message Messiah that he brought and many
[52:10] more of what I'm laid out they talk
[52:13] about that little button being in there
[52:16] and he says in there you got the doors
[52:19] closed you got problems but he says you
[52:23] that you need to let that button grow it
[52:28] just keeps growing that's the part I
[52:31] love that it don't stay a little button
[52:35] it starts growing
[52:37] that's the stature of a perfect man is
[52:40] it starts growing it starts a growth
[52:47] development and that's through the
[52:50] opening of the word
[52:53] we receive daily if we're not further up
[52:57] the road from from things you know do it
[52:59] then don't talk about being a Christian
[53:01] or not a question I'm not talking about
[53:03] it come on get it right I'm not talking
[53:05] about the Prophet explaining some kind
[53:08] of an adulteress that it's okay to do
[53:10] that cause you're Christian that ain't
[53:11] what I'm talking about
[53:13] he's against that and tells it right but
[53:16] he says you got a little bitter in this
[53:26] well then no no I've been taught all of
[53:29] my life that that everything went out of
[53:32] me how many doors you got closed well I
[53:43] never heard it like that cuz I'll always
[53:45] believe that when you got born again you
[53:47] just washed out clean your prophet
[53:50] starts off with a little bitty button
[53:53] not that size he calls that eternal life
[53:57] just remember one thing
[54:00] your soul is you your soul is you and
[54:09] God has to work on me you to get rid of
[54:17] things and a lot of it to get rid of
[54:19] things we didn't even know we had get
[54:25] rid of little things maybe we didn't
[54:27] know we had that's why I love the
[54:30] message like it is it's not a just a
[54:33] bunk and a hammer you over the head
[54:36] drive it down and if you if you even as
[54:39] much as have a dirty talk your love you
[54:47] can't have to talk come on
[54:48] I was the one that brought him up help
[54:52] me will and my first Christian my life
[54:54] he said you can't have the salt coming
[54:56] well you've heard the story you can't
[54:59] help the birds flying over your head but
[55:01] just keep them from building a nest
[55:03] right
[55:09] brother Dale you're you're you're
[55:11] talking light and these kids is
[55:12] listening these kids know he move more
[55:15] than I do
[55:19] don't maybe that's our problem our kids
[55:27] follow us every day and see our lives so
[55:29] we should walk everyday is the best that
[55:31] we can we yet realized for one thing for
[55:34] certain
[55:35] we cannot conquer the devil I don't care
[55:40] what you think you can't do it but run
[55:43] said nobody is a match for the devil no
[55:46] that is worth a Christian he said that
[55:51] little button he said it starts growing
[55:55] we you know where it's growing in the
[55:58] soul the soul is you come on church it's
[56:04] not then you got this over here and this
[56:05] over here you got to the little engines
[56:07] choir compartment you got a soul down in
[56:09] here see that we try to define those
[56:11] time and the Prophet said the best way
[56:14] he could describe it was that it when
[56:18] you got the new birth it was like a
[56:19] little button inside of your soul he
[56:23] said then that begins to grow
[56:28] what's it growing them it's growing in
[56:31] me and I've always tried to tell you I
[56:35] listened to people talk about the change
[56:37] of the body nothing I really get the
[56:39] wrong idea I'm sorry I hear people
[56:41] preachers preaching on the chain and
[56:43] it's like it starts out here and works
[56:45] its way around here that just gets
[56:46] getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
[56:48] that while it just covers all the old
[56:50] changes covers all over no that's not
[56:54] they don't start out here it starts in
[56:57] here and work from end are out here so
[57:02] we won't anything out here we better
[57:04] start working on what's in the dark and
[57:07] listen to the prophet describing that
[57:09] when you got that little button
[57:11] he said there's some bitterness there's
[57:14] some price when a man is converted
[57:18] see that little white button starts in
[57:20] the heart that little white button he
[57:29] said that's eternal life well what's he
[57:33] trying to make our old into our soul
[57:39] like the little white button
[57:41] would you agree let that button grow out
[57:47] until it's like the apples on a tree
[57:50] what does it do how does it get there
[57:53] because the tree keeps drinking drinking
[57:56] drinking drinking that's how God gets to
[57:59] that each and every one of us through
[58:01] that part of drinking drinking drinking
[58:04] studying the message praying Ron gave me
[58:07] a thing and I'll just read his comment
[58:10] and he's listening let me read a comment
[58:14] of a Christian when he talks about what
[58:17] we're trying to do I especially like
[58:20] Strong's definition of good and perfect
[58:23] he said good means agreeable and upright
[58:25] perfect means the mature complete or
[58:27] full grown that's what I love about what
[58:30] you've been preaching that God gives us
[58:32] that small part of him at the start of
[58:36] our journey and we continue maturing and
[58:40] we would continue nurturing it by
[58:42] believing reading the Bible pray come to
[58:46] church cast down our own ideas about the
[58:49] word in that button our word we have
[58:52] received will grow into us to the full
[58:54] stature of Jesus Christ what a beautiful
[58:57] redemption plan you'll see that's that's
[59:01] the point the little button is what's
[59:04] growing inside of you it's not to just
[59:08] say that this much of my soul is eternal
[59:10] now but one of these days of eternal no
[59:13] it's saying we're going to grow up in
[59:15] these virtues it's going to be Jesus
[59:19] Christ Apostle Paul said it's not our
[59:21] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[59:26] it's just
[59:28] Trading trying to get us to see the
[59:31] little button to where we can follow in
[59:37] brother Brennan says what happens you
[59:41] drink in and the Holy Spirit pushes out
[59:44] see that just starts taking over until
[59:48] our soul is completely captivated by the
[59:51] Holy Spirit right until that we have
[59:57] become what we need to be he says then
[59:59] if we keep eating ever individual in
[1:00:06] here that's received the baptism of the
[1:00:08] Holy Ghost or you're planted in Christ
[1:00:11] hallelujah a Holy Ghost baptism then
[1:00:14] even the rapture is in you but run said
[1:00:23] the rapture is in you mean where's
[1:00:28] eternal life in you well you mean we got
[1:00:34] eternal life but we need more eternal
[1:00:36] life will you explain it you know it's
[1:00:42] humanly impossible to determine a lot of
[1:00:44] things you just got to say it and
[1:00:46] believe it the new birth inside of you
[1:00:49] makes your soul eternal but there's
[1:00:54] problems in that soul that are human
[1:00:56] beings have that we yield ourselves to
[1:01:01] the devil on a lot of things and it's
[1:01:03] him trying to come back what do you mean
[1:01:08] it's okay for me to do these things what
[1:01:09] I need to I gave you the definition the
[1:01:13] prophets said the way back for a
[1:01:16] backslider is the same way back as for a
[1:01:20] sinner to come to Christ what is that
[1:01:22] repent accept Jesus Christ and believe
[1:01:26] him and walk in that love and say God
[1:01:29] forgive me and lead me let me grow in
[1:01:36] you how do we grow the Prophet said
[1:01:39] reading your Bible and
[1:01:42] in the pushing out that little button
[1:01:51] just keeps growing bigger and bigger and
[1:01:53] bigger and once they do it it's pushing
[1:01:54] us out it's the one that's going to
[1:01:59] these doors that's within us the Holy
[1:02:02] Spirit right goes to them doors to open
[1:02:06] the door and we got it something there
[1:02:08] sealed out but like I said now to
[1:02:10] remember it's not adult reason and all I
[1:02:12] can I keep saying that called people of
[1:02:14] time well I hate it believes you can
[1:02:15] come in adulterer to do anything you
[1:02:16] want to read Ron says quote sent us in
[1:02:21] as a Christian you will reap a tubful
[1:02:23] now that's pretty cool I said I think
[1:02:26] that's par for easing it right we don't
[1:02:31] get by with nothing that's the problem
[1:02:33] we think that way see we're not taught
[1:02:36] that way we're not taught that God is
[1:02:39] expecting us to grow he's expecting us
[1:02:44] to learn to study our Bible well instead
[1:02:48] of that we'll get on everything in the
[1:02:49] world
[1:02:50] we'll get on the Internet's get on all
[1:02:53] of this that and the other and the
[1:02:54] Facebook's and the space books and all
[1:02:56] kind of thing do you get on all of that
[1:02:58] stuff until we're not studying God's
[1:03:05] Word we're not praying and believing it
[1:03:11] what's the problem of it not pushing out
[1:03:14] it says may they grow in grace and
[1:03:17] knowledge of the Lord until they've
[1:03:20] become in the full stature of Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ then someday be caught up
[1:03:26] together with him in the clouds to be
[1:03:30] with the Lord
[1:03:31] LaRon says when you're born again I
[1:03:34] listen to them that's what I said you
[1:03:37] take one statement from and he said it
[1:03:39] one way you take that and hold that and
[1:03:41] don't listen you take another statement
[1:03:43] he says when you're born again he said
[1:03:45] you get everything you need for the
[1:03:50] journey you need to have with him he's
[1:03:55] you get everything you need for the
[1:03:58] journey when you're born again well what
[1:04:00] I need statue perfect man no this one
[1:04:02] I've got it in there we need it out here
[1:04:07] if you're gonna go that route we need it
[1:04:10] out here yeah but what's the explaining
[1:04:17] you get everything you need it's in
[1:04:22] there waiting on us to take in the word
[1:04:25] for it to push out it's not it we're so
[1:04:30] goody-good in it were there's that in
[1:04:32] the other no it's the fact that we're
[1:04:36] human beings and we need to be very very
[1:04:39] what is the honey the prophets say about
[1:04:41] the Holy Ghost he said he's very timid
[1:04:46] he said you you've grieving he said
[1:04:49] he'll go out on a limb when they didn't
[1:04:51] say he gonna leave he he didn't say
[1:04:55] you're lost he said just go down on a
[1:04:58] limb waiting on you call him back right
[1:05:07] keep pushing out let's see
[1:05:16] I like this statement but I believe that
[1:05:22] when you believe on the believe on God
[1:05:25] with all your heart and accept Jesus as
[1:05:27] your Savior you've got a portion of the
[1:05:30] Holy Spirit now the little button
[1:05:35] becomes a portion that's another way of
[1:05:42] expressing it he's explaining the
[1:05:48] Christian life that when we're born
[1:05:50] again his babies we're born again
[1:05:54] God gives us all we have Nita is in
[1:05:58] there in the Holy Spirit we need to keep
[1:06:03] drinking in until it can push I thought
[1:06:07] that's the whole thing
[1:06:09] and how do we do it pray in laying
[1:06:13] before the Lord serving him believe in
[1:06:17] him coming to church and leaving and
[1:06:21] having a good time in God and we're
[1:06:24] growing in grace and knowledge now
[1:06:28] brother Brennan said it took him 30
[1:06:30] something years before a great statue of
[1:06:32] a perfect man well how long do you think
[1:06:35] it's gonna take for us to get it maybe
[1:06:38] it's gonna take another 50 years well we
[1:06:41] ain't gonna be around here that long
[1:06:42] brother Dale well we've been around here
[1:06:45] a long time already right what do we
[1:06:53] need to do grow in grace and knowledge
[1:06:58] there's no way of escaping this is the
[1:07:02] way to become in the full stature of
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ what drinking in and
[1:07:09] letting him push out then if I do have
[1:07:15] any problems if I do wrong come on
[1:07:23] I keep saying it because it's in your
[1:07:25] mind and you you'll run it into the
[1:07:27] ground and say I'm saying something
[1:07:28] wrong I'm talking about adultery and
[1:07:30] stuff like that now don't you get in
[1:07:33] that junk we're just human beings at how
[1:07:37] the problem God is there to take care of
[1:07:41] those problems all we got to do is heal
[1:07:45] to him and say forgive us forgive me for
[1:07:50] what I've done Lord forgive me for this
[1:07:52] thinking that I don't you mean forgive
[1:07:54] me and the words that I said always like
[1:08:02] the way brother mote said to me he said
[1:08:04] you do the best you can now that was his
[1:08:06] word because we're talking about that
[1:08:09] the reason he made that statement I
[1:08:10] remember him preaching but we were
[1:08:12] talking about it and see he's no way of
[1:08:16] saying what he's if you still horse take
[1:08:17] it back right that was his way of saying
[1:08:21] it said if you steal horse take it back
[1:08:23] in other words if you repent repent but
[1:08:26] what are you gonna do the guy that you
[1:08:29] took the horse from he dies now who are
[1:08:32] you gonna do well you can give it to the
[1:08:35] family get the point of what I'm talking
[1:08:36] about
[1:08:37] do the best you can right do the best
[1:08:45] you can with what you got and then God
[1:08:49] will take care of the rest of it because
[1:08:51] he knows our heart whether it's sincere
[1:08:53] or not then told me one time he said you
[1:08:59] want to worry about it said you can
[1:09:01] apologize and apologize you say I'm
[1:09:03] sorry
[1:09:04] he said that's very cheap he's that's
[1:09:07] easy words to say I'm sorry sorry
[1:09:12] supposed to mean what
[1:09:20] we do right it's not that much we're
[1:09:34] supposed to turn around and go the other
[1:09:35] way
[1:09:36] all right see being a Christian is a
[1:09:40] Christians life and it's wonderful to be
[1:09:43] but yet we don't glow in that we have
[1:09:47] this that the other but it is true that
[1:09:49] we have an advocate with the father
[1:09:52] Jesus Christ the righteous we have one
[1:10:00] to pay our debts but we need to
[1:10:03] disrepair and say God forgive me
[1:10:07] the Lord helped me I can't control this
[1:10:12] that or the other I've got a little
[1:10:13] problem here with this you know I got a
[1:10:16] little bit too much internet well just
[1:10:21] ask God to take care of that there's
[1:10:26] plenty of good stuff on there I like old
[1:10:30] westerns and things but you know right
[1:10:32] down below that you can go and look and
[1:10:34] right over on the side of there it says
[1:10:35] real Bible heroes Moses will just click
[1:10:43] on Moses you can just set there for
[1:10:48] hours and view Bible stories on your
[1:10:53] internet what are you following what I'm
[1:11:01] saying then as it drinks it pushes out
[1:11:06] limbs it drinks more and pushes out
[1:11:11] leaves drinks more pushes out blossoms
[1:11:16] drank more it pushes out oranges
[1:11:26] just keep eating and let that little
[1:11:28] button take over in our lives well see
[1:11:32] we try to figure out well what's the big
[1:11:34] I big gift the big button
[1:11:36] a man gave me a book one time he wanted
[1:11:39] me to put down all that brother branham
[1:11:40] said about 1977 i throw the book away
[1:11:49] because i didn't have much time to put
[1:11:52] into all that go we done taste it well
[1:11:58] good is it talked about dire when we're
[1:12:01] here right so you can talk about what
[1:12:05] that was we're talking about what it is
[1:12:07] now all right
[1:12:09] do you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:12:12] church that's what I've been trying to
[1:12:13] get is a background or point to where we
[1:12:16] can see the whole message will tie
[1:12:17] together and then we can start at faith
[1:12:19] and see how that goes and how that comes
[1:12:24] into us how it comes to a place that
[1:12:30] Christ can live in you and me do the
[1:12:37] things we do doesn't bother God it's
[1:12:41] when we don't have the repentant
[1:12:44] attitude the repentant attitude covers
[1:12:53] you think brother brown and now we're
[1:12:56] not Catholic believe in paying for sins
[1:12:58] before you commit them but one day
[1:13:00] brother Adam was talking and he said see
[1:13:03] there he said if your hearts right he
[1:13:06] said God doesn't forgive you before you
[1:13:08] ever even ask him cuz he knows what
[1:13:11] you're going to you said well then I
[1:13:15] know how fat no wait a minute no um now
[1:13:19] don't go wrong with me he knows what we
[1:13:22] will do which he knows we will repent or
[1:13:27] he knows if we won't repent well then I
[1:13:33] get by doing it now huh no
[1:13:38] because a Christian should never have
[1:13:41] that thought in their mind a Christian
[1:13:44] should never in their mind even conceive
[1:13:47] a thought that I can get by with
[1:13:49] something well God forgive me well you
[1:13:58] know what don't make him mad for me to
[1:13:59] ask him to forgive me after he'd done
[1:14:02] forgive me right I mean that won't you
[1:14:07] get the point
[1:14:08] hey don't make him mad at me you don't
[1:14:11] get mad and say quit repenting no you
[1:14:20] see the Christian life is a journey
[1:14:22] that's what I've been trying to preach
[1:14:24] about we have our problems right here
[1:14:28] today we've got problems with things our
[1:14:31] thoughts our minds or things like that
[1:14:34] that's the problem and we're Christians
[1:14:39] right oh it would be nice if we could
[1:14:44] all walk in here and cut out everything
[1:14:46] and come in here and sit down and be
[1:14:49] open-minded to God but that that's not
[1:14:54] exactly the way life is made are you
[1:15:00] following me see then growing in grace
[1:15:06] and knowledge is exactly what the Bible
[1:15:08] says then you grow by eating in the
[1:15:14] natural so we grow by eating in the
[1:15:16] spiritual but here's our problem is
[1:15:22] we'll get to it in a statute of perfect
[1:15:24] man it's patience sometimes we don't
[1:15:29] have it we need patience well then
[1:15:34] there's a lack of patience right God has
[1:15:39] to put up with the fact that we don't
[1:15:40] have it he's trying to give it to us and
[1:15:43] show it how to receive it but we don't
[1:15:45] have it
[1:15:50] Oh patience and we grow into this great
[1:15:54] no patience is coming to a place to
[1:15:58] where that we can just wait on God I'll
[1:16:04] get to it when we get into the statue of
[1:16:05] a perfect man we brought him up reach
[1:16:07] that 19 and 71 right in the end of 71 72
[1:16:10] I asked him I said okay we know we gotta
[1:16:14] how these virtuous and how do we get him
[1:16:17] now you can believe you do it you guys
[1:16:19] know better than me he come back he said
[1:16:22] I don't let her know you know how to get
[1:16:25] him we need to virtue how do we get him
[1:16:29] about 19 and 80 God spoke to my heart
[1:16:33] about it I believe it was him he said
[1:16:37] through the opening of the word these
[1:16:38] virtues will come into being
[1:16:40] that's what the Prophet had said old
[1:16:42] time I just had to read it I had to
[1:16:46] reread the book until it hit to me
[1:16:50] that's what he has always been telling
[1:16:53] us that it's through the opening of the
[1:16:55] word that we get these virtues in time
[1:16:57] it's through the opening of the word
[1:16:59] that we get rid of the things in our
[1:17:00] lives that we find out it wrong the
[1:17:12] church
[1:17:13] drinking and push out everything that
[1:17:18] you have need of is in you at the
[1:17:23] beginning when you get your new birth
[1:17:25] right around them I read it to you I've
[1:17:28] got to there I know he said even the
[1:17:30] rapture is in you I wish I could get it
[1:17:36] out that's the problem it's where we
[1:17:39] don't listen and study the word to that
[1:17:43] form to try to get an understanding of
[1:17:46] God's Word a baby grows by eating on
[1:17:54] Christian grows by eating God's Word you
[1:17:58] want to push out those things and let
[1:17:59] that little button grow
[1:18:00] that's where eating the world of it
[1:18:04] studying the word praying seeking God
[1:18:12] those it'll just push out that little
[1:18:17] button just keeps getting bigger and
[1:18:19] bigger until it just keeps pushing me
[1:18:21] out oh no what is that saying is we
[1:18:25] could just a zero ourselves out you know
[1:18:31] because the less is involved in me the
[1:18:35] more God can be well do you have any
[1:18:38] problems all of us have troubles and
[1:18:40] that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:18:41] that's what I'm trying to get us to see
[1:18:43] the truth of any time we're born-again
[1:18:46] Christians right but we have troubles
[1:18:50] and if we say we have no sin now the
[1:18:55] Bible says that's wrong for us to say
[1:18:57] that you said well I'm not a sinner
[1:19:07] what is sin what is sin but random what
[1:19:22] is sin it's not drinking gambling
[1:19:24] smoking run around with men commit
[1:19:26] adultery no you remember the lady said
[1:19:31] for heaven's sakes
[1:19:32] what did seeing this unbelief now listen
[1:19:41] for just a minute this is the whole
[1:19:43] message sin is unbelief the things we do
[1:19:51] is the attributes of unbelief so now
[1:19:58] let's push that out to this much let's
[1:20:01] get the adulteries the bad things out
[1:20:03] and don't worry about that because if we
[1:20:07] do that we're not a Christian I mean I
[1:20:10] taught to solve that right up front well
[1:20:14] it don't bother me brother Dale said I
[1:20:15] can do anything I want to you can and be
[1:20:18] lost you can do anything you want to you
[1:20:21] can live like a devil do what you want
[1:20:23] to the word or not want to take the big
[1:20:30] things out of the situation and get down
[1:20:35] to one little thing what he is unbelief
[1:20:44] how is it that God could be so great and
[1:20:49] brotherly and we were talking it
[1:20:50] yesterday
[1:20:51] I don't crazy where I think I'm sorry
[1:20:56] but we were talking about the civil war
[1:20:59] and I said well brother Larry wouldn't
[1:21:01] it something that here now I get my min
[1:21:04] wrong but which one grant over here and
[1:21:06] Lee over here or something you know the
[1:21:09] two different generals and here they are
[1:21:12] and they're both praying for a victory
[1:21:18] and God is sitting listening to him and
[1:21:26] God is sitting listening to him and
[1:21:29] they're both wanting him to answer them
[1:21:32] right that's why I never have understood
[1:21:41] why people say they you know would say
[1:21:43] they will this man and that man's God I
[1:21:45] certainly don't want no part like that
[1:21:47] wouldn't it be something you got to
[1:21:49] thump a coin to decide which one would
[1:21:51] win in the war you know is that the way
[1:21:53] God does things well he does it for free
[1:21:58] I am not totally lost on that I'm just
[1:22:00] making an illustration I'm just trying
[1:22:02] to get you to think God sees our lives
[1:22:08] and knows all about us with you also
[1:22:12] knows the inward part and that's the
[1:22:15] main thing he knows what the deep down
[1:22:18] desires within us is he knows what you
[1:22:22] really want and he deals according to
[1:22:27] what you want and the Bible tells you
[1:22:31] inflame we're not we're not to want
[1:22:32] things to consume up on her own sales
[1:22:34] right now let's see that's that's not
[1:22:38] the way it is but see being a Christian
[1:22:42] is a different thing we're out here in a
[1:22:46] kingdoms of domain of Satan literally
[1:22:49] all of this is Satan from the things
[1:22:53] we're sitting on the books we're reading
[1:22:55] out of the paperwork you know I'm
[1:22:56] talking about all of the whole natural
[1:22:58] world this is the devil the Christian
[1:23:02] brother enema is one of those statements
[1:23:04] are ready where he said that little
[1:23:06] button coming he said God starts within
[1:23:08] your soul in other words bringing his
[1:23:10] kingdom into being in you
[1:23:18] bringing his kingdom into you in that
[1:23:22] little button let it grow but brother
[1:23:30] they'll do you mean no
[1:23:31] no wait I didn't say that now here's my
[1:23:34] life statement on the point if you
[1:23:35] listen to it and listen carefully the
[1:23:39] more Christian you are the more
[1:23:43] repentant what is in other words the
[1:23:50] more you want to be right
[1:23:54] the older you get in Christ the more you
[1:23:57] want to be right it's not the older you
[1:24:00] get you lose the abilities or lose the
[1:24:02] desires to be right no you should want
[1:24:05] to where would it be in any point I
[1:24:09] better run said he said it's impossible
[1:24:11] to get that Holy Ghost feel woman to put
[1:24:14] on them fire fans and see women who go
[1:24:19] right out and still do it and claim to
[1:24:20] be Christians that should be the one
[1:24:23] thing we would say well I'm not a
[1:24:24] question Oh
[1:24:26] among wrong to state let's see uh when
[1:24:30] Billy Paul was that man and then this
[1:24:33] other man came up to him and said ain't
[1:24:34] you William branham's son something like
[1:24:38] that why wouldn't he said William
[1:24:41] Branham wouldn't have a son like that
[1:24:43] somewhat I'm paraphrasing it you want to
[1:24:48] have a repentant heart about us on
[1:24:49] everything or to be more concerned in
[1:24:56] our lives of everyday then let God come
[1:25:03] and live more and more because he comes
[1:25:06] and lives in us he's taking out us right
[1:25:11] that button it's growing until it takes
[1:25:15] over
[1:25:17] there's the statue of a perfect man the
[1:25:19] man what I want to be right with God it
[1:25:24] didn't make one I'll be right with
[1:25:26] mankind you know with each other
[1:25:28] Laura always want to be right
[1:25:36] man called me up one time he said I want
[1:25:39] to talk to you I said okay he said I
[1:25:43] know what you just said about me yeah
[1:25:46] and he said I won't apologize he said
[1:25:49] because he the brother was wrong about
[1:25:53] what he was saying no not about me but
[1:25:55] it was wrong about what he was saying
[1:25:56] and I I corrected him but when I
[1:25:58] corrected him I said you know that's his
[1:26:00] right I believe in it and things you
[1:26:04] know don't condemn him something at that
[1:26:06] degree and he come back he said your
[1:26:08] thing but the man I thought would be my
[1:26:11] enemy was my friend
[1:26:13] God you see I didn't condemn him you
[1:26:17] know that's between him and God I was
[1:26:23] taking up far and he said that's one
[1:26:24] thing to see that a person would take up
[1:26:26] for you he said when you was right and I
[1:26:28] was wrong I said what does it matter
[1:26:30] who's right and wrong no but I want to
[1:26:32] be right I want to be right in God I
[1:26:34] want my attitude to be right in God it
[1:26:37] don't make no difference better all the
[1:26:38] rest of it then that's where we should
[1:26:44] do is a man set to say I'm sorry as easy
[1:26:47] words the state of God Lord I love you
[1:26:54] I'm sorry for the way that I've been
[1:26:58] forgive me don't help me cuz I know I
[1:27:00] can't win this battle on my own living a
[1:27:08] Christian life growing in grace and
[1:27:11] knowledge as we receive God's Word
[1:27:16] come on musicians as we receive God's
[1:27:19] Word were growing into that word and
[1:27:21] that word is growing in us it's changing
[1:27:27] us it's making us to be what he wants us
[1:27:31] to be growing in grace and knowledge I
[1:27:38] stand together
[1:27:45] think on these things
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:28:06] he has risen from the dead and he is
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:25] everybody have a neato
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:46] Gavin eat come let's see I hope you
[1:28:50] understand what I'm trying to break a
[1:28:52] growth development until we can grow up
[1:28:58] in him there's a head
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:04] then the virtues will be displayed
[1:29:07] outwardly right because they're inwardly
[1:29:12] the world sees the world sees us in
[1:29:17] spirit realm God sees us in the air
[1:29:20] around
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:36] yes he is
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:43] risen from the dead
[1:29:54] every need
[1:30:00] every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] No
[1:30:16] for me this will crack laws we send it
[1:30:20] to work Lord it all would be well taken
[1:30:25] care of we thank you we love you
[1:30:31] you just make manifest the things that
[1:30:34] are a spark
[1:30:35] let your grace and love be sufficient in
[1:30:38] Jesus not anybody else
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:44] [Applause]
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:57] father we thank you for today and we
[1:31:00] just ask you Lord at what we've said
[1:31:02] would be enough to understand that we
[1:31:05] try to explain things and we know in
[1:31:07] human languages if we try to explain
[1:31:10] anything we'll always mess it up so we
[1:31:14] just ask you to come on the scene to let
[1:31:16] us know what a Christian life is there's
[1:31:19] no perfection in ourselves there's
[1:31:21] nothing within us that could be anything
[1:31:23] except one time that we could yield
[1:31:26] ourselves to you and let you take over
[1:31:29] and Lord grow in us because growing in
[1:31:33] grace and knowledge is receiving your
[1:31:35] word and walking in you and that way
[1:31:38] it'll be made manifest then back out
[1:31:40] through us that the world can see Christ
[1:31:43] and want to live like that and thank you
