TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you saints excited to be in the house of the lord this morning it's good to come to church isn't it that's where you can get a blessing let's just pray before we go into our study lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning lord just we we've come expecting lord and we we all have different needs lord and we believe that we'll our needs will be met this morning lord and we just ask lord that you'll bless our brother as he's studying and preparing lord and bless the reading of our of the word as we study uh out the book of hebrews this morning bless your people we ask in your name so we we've been uh we're almost uh getting into hebrews chapter six but just to to recap hebrews chapter five where we got to um hebrews chapter five starts in verse one with for every high priest taken from among men as ordained from men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason hereof he all is for the people so also for himself to offer for sins and no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so also god glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee as he saith also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was hurt and that he feared though he were son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect now kind of set that in your mind because we're talking about perfection this morning that's what paul's paul's kind of getting to is his point where where you start off as a baby and you're trying to get to perfection being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation into all them that obey him call of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing so he's got he's got a lot of stuff to say about melchizedek and about perfection and growth and a lot of those things but he's like y'all are y'all ready for that for when the time for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and have become such as have need of milk and not a strong meat so i think that's that's an important principle that paul's laying out if you're if you're there's a there's a time when you when you're ready for deep teaching but if you're not ready for deep teaching sometimes it has to be rehashed and things have to be laid out again and that the principles have to be have to be laid out and you go through things that's why sometimes it's helpful to reiterate and uh sermons get preached over and over until we get it because god he's he's he's waiting on us he's waiting on us so that we he's waiting on us for us to get it so you start off as a little baby and we just kind of reviewed last time some of the some of the traits of a baby because paul said for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is obeyed unskillful in the word of righteousness because you you don't quite um have full clarity on a lot of things you don't quite know um you know there might be some places where the the devil can get through some gaps in your armor and things and look at look what a little baby does it it gets his feelings hurt easily just looking at the natural it cries a lot always wanting his way a little bit selfish more concerned with their own comfort than others can't express themselves well lack of self-control likes understanding not ready for responsibility now now there's a big one isn't it a a little baby you're not you like like the example that brother wade likes to use a lot of you're not going to put a baby in the car you're not going to put a baby driving an airplane you're not going to uh you know you're not going to set a little baby over over a church or something like that a little baby trips and falls often you know that's a a sign of maturity is when you're ready for responsibility that's why you know when a a young man or young lady is thinking about getting married and everything you want somebody that's responsible that that is thinking about thinking about doing things in life that providing for a family providing for a home um because that's what maturity means a little baby needs help to eat and can't digest table food so you know a little baby a little baby is going to have problems with you preaching a sermon about the second fold of three-fold mystery or trying to break down a theorem beast and what that is and a little babies that little baby needs some milk to kind of get started because a little baby needs um you think now we last time i was just talking about how we love little babies in the natural we we love little babies and a lot of times in the even just in the world people can think of babies as just kind of an inconvenience yeah and and and it can be it can be looked at that sometimes as my you know now we gotta we to help the little babies grow up to maturity and it seems like something you got to wait on them and the way that paul talked to the corinthians the corinthian church was full of little babies he you know he's like yeah y'all got to grow up in things but a little baby what a little bit baby needs is for the word to be broken down so that they can understand and be born again and start growing and so a lot of times you know we will come to church you know when an evangelist comes in or whatever and we'll think it's a big inconvenience but you gotta you gotta have that because that's what babies need babies need for uh you know their little problems in their life to be dealt with young people young people have problems that sometimes the older ones forget about the young people are going through stuff and this stage you know all sorts of spirits in the in the school system and stuff and and uh all sorts of things that kind of begin to fall out of the mind of what a mature creature a mature christian might be thinking about the seven seals opening and and melchizedek and all of those kind of things but little babies not quite ready for that yet so they need they need they need it presented in maybe a little different way so maybe don't think of it as an inconvenience when an evangelist comes in and preaches a good sermon for little babies now little babies we the way we grow up now we we we're trying to get trying to get to a place where we can eat meat because paul said but strong meat belongs to them that are full age in other words you're not going to be able to eat that that strong meat until you grow up a little bit like i was saying that i like i just i like to use the example of the the second fold of the threefold mystery because you know that's just gonna blow little babies a little bit you start preaching on the the unknown language in the seventh seal what was brother brown talking about what was he preaching about and and little babies not gonna be ready for that strong meat belonging to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so it takes some time it takes some learning how to how that when you go to prayer and and lay god's word at his feet and god will answer you and how to do battle with the devil exercising exercising to discern both good and evil it takes some while to use to to to learn how to use the word and what what we have access to strong meat belonging to them their full age so i got here an example of an eagle eating he's he's eating that and eating that meat that he got and a college student that's come from a little baby grown up now you know a college student you know may not be the best example because that again implies that you've got to be intellectually smart you don't have to be intellectually smart to understand the message but what you do have to have is a revelation that's why you know i use example a lot of times that the the gospel is simple but it's so simple it's going to go my over it's your intellectual mind will always go over it you you it is so simple that it it god's got to reveal it to you so it don't come by by being real smart but it comes by being able to humble yourself to god's word and allow him to reveal it to you and so it comes by by by preset upon precept here a little there little the word being built up god revealing that to you until you come to a place where then the seals can be opened up to you and and it reveals your redemption story and the redemption story of of the of the bride of christ so that's in hebrews chapter four so if we need if we need word the word what how how sometimes we kind of get in our head that that uh that you know maybe we can start battling out whether whether coming to church and getting the word is what we really need to grow paul said our brother said in the message hebrew chapter four he said that's what's the matter with the church they've been taught little old pity sissified old lady doctrine of some sort run around and have soup suppers and card parties because that's what sometimes the the church world has made coming to church all these little programs and and things and soup suppers and and and getting together to to make it a social thing but he said he said no mother no wonder we got a bunch of chaos that we got we don't need children's programs and little soup suppers because children's programs and soup suppers and all that kind of stuff is not going to change anybody he said what we need is a rugged old gospel a man of faith with his sword hanging out there and challenging what we need today not some petty theology and some theory of man-made clique we need the rugged gospel priest and the light and the power and demonstration of the holy ghost because what's going to save the lost is the word of god what's going to cause us to grow to perfection the word of god that's right so social programs and all that kind of stuff is not gonna it's not gonna help what we need is the word of god and that's what church is for churches churches there's a lot of things a lot of programs and things out there that will help somebody that don't have any money or don't have don't have a place to live and that kind of thing but you come to church to feed your soul so paul said in hebrews chapter 6 he said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works in a faithful god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment so he he's saying there's a lot of things that you start off with as a as a baby as the church was getting started as a foundation that that that that are laid out as a foundation of your growth but but let's keep going on to a perfect understanding a perfect revelation of jesus christ let's go on to perfection so you can see the whole plan is laid out in the statue of a perfect man and because this illustrates your growth as a christian it illustrates the growth of the church from a foundational faith so he's saying repentance from dead works dead repentance from dead works where you just you think you're saved because you're coming to church and doing something that because you paved the parking lot or because you put some ties into the often plate repentance from dead work so repentance from the way that you used to used to do and as brother louise yesterday was talking to the young people in the little and the little study down there repentance means you you turn around and you say i want to change i want to change my i want to change my direction not just not just afraid apologizing for getting caught but you actually change your direction and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment so now paul's laying out a lot of things that that are good foundational things that we should know and we should understand he's not saying let's just put those to the side you need to know how that you're saved by faith and not because of your works you need to know that how how to be baptized and and and what name to be baptized in and the formula and what peter was talking about and and whether the act of being put down in the water is what saves you or whether it whether it's your faith in christ which it is and of laying on of hands do you need do you need somebody to lay hands on you or do you can you just receive it right there in your seat or what if you're in a spot where you will you need somebody to lay hands on you is is there something wrong with that and see the pulse paul's laying out all these things that are just good foundational things that that it's it's important to know as a good foundation that we're going to raise from the dead there's going to be a resurrection of the dead and have eternal judgment that that uh the things that you do there's going to be a reckoning so paul saying leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith or god of the doctrine of baptisms but of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and brother brown said in the message indictment he said see paul wants to know that these things here are absolutely essential and i'm reading this quote because it's he's not saying that we toss these things aside when we go on to perfection but now that we've got these things let's keep going these things here are absolutely essential baptisms laying all of hands the resurrection second coming all these things are eternal they are absolutely the truth but once you've got these things laid down it's like you're you're on a journey maybe somebody somebody was talking to me the other day about how that uh quoting from brother dale when he used to preach the seals the the series to how that when the seals begin to open it reveals your journey so now think about that you start you start from a foundation and you start you it's like you the foundation is your starting block and you you you leave there and you and you and you're trying you're going on to perfection paul would illustrate as you're running a race and i think it's in i think it's in first corinthians where paul would say run the race well because really the one that counts in a race is the one that wins so what does it matter if you start the race and you fall off and you don't you don't get to you don't you don't cross the finish line like you see so many people that have left the message and things we don't wish let's start the start the race with the mind and the goal that we're going to go somewhere yeah so so paul says that or brother ryan said in hebrews chapter 6 in that message he preached he said now all these things like baptisms one is baptized backwards one forward one in the name of the father son and holy ghost one jesus name one this way in that way and all these different little things of baptisms and of laying on of hands like he said bless god i got the gift of laying out of hands hallelujah you can get it this way hallelujah he said laying all that aside because that's dead works these reformations reforming he's speaking of another class another class of people that would come to perfection now he said let's get away from that and go on to perfection and he said and the church is still lingering back in those things that's what they were trying to do the early hebrew church was trying to say well i was baptized by mercy and i i got this and all these things he said now lay all of that aside leaving it behind but now did he say we shouldn't do it so you're saying those are those are important it's important to have that foundation laid he said baptism is laying on of hands and things but that isn't perfect that's only the carnal reform and that's where the churches leave off at today is on that carnal reform one of them said oh well the water the word baptism means this and it means that and they set up organizations the one sprinkles and one pours and the other one baptizes face forward the other backward and you know he's trying to illustrate what reformation it reformation is when you're trying to you're trying to change things a little bit so that you get you get the right thing what and he'll go in to talk about how martin luther reformed and he he got uh that that we need you're saved by justification but he still was baptism under the name of the father son and holy ghost and or under the titles of father son and holy ghost and and leaving things like going into a pub and smoking a pipe and and not understanding the sanctification and reform and everything but our goal is to come up to a perfect understanding so what is a reformer a reformer is one who sees a need for change and works to create it in spite of the difficulties that often arise from human beings natural aversion to change see paul's talking about we're coming to perfection and martin luther and john whissel and all those that were looking for a perfect for perfect understanding but until that came they were reformers who like like i was using that illustration that martin luther would had a little bit of understanding but yeah there was a lot of loose ends that needed to be patched up and john wesley come with a little bit more understanding that we that god can entirely sanctify your life and make you live a clean life but yet still uh had a trinitarian idea a perception and it was still things that needed to be patched up loose ends i mean it needed to be tied up so again we're talking about perfection now now now just to illustrate perfection versus reformation i i just got a little picture here that of a heart that this is kind of reformation is kind of like patching it up and it's still from some things that aren't aren't quite tidied up yet but perfection is when you got the the complete picture perfection is when perfection is this message that we've heard that's that ties up all the loose ends and paints a complete picture of who jesus christ is from genesis to revelation and see martin luther and and john wesley and them they didn't they were they were reformers so they were they were they were looking at it through a through a glass darkly without without a complete picture without a complete understanding that's why we needed a prophet in this day to to give us a complete revelation of the bible and brother brown said in the first seal he said the reformers came to reform the last fallen church age preceding them and then after the reformers come at the church age from where it was and it went back into the world then they start a new church age always done it always now we went through that see in other words they've been a catholic church church age of the roman catholic church a long-come luther a reformer he's called a reformer and what does he do he starts right out there hammering away and when he does he protests the church and the first thing you know what does he do he builds the same thing that he come to drive out of another church then they have another church age the church age is in such a mess along comes john wesley another reformer builds another church age get what i mean another church age is built up and they're all reformers but he said notice this last message of the last church age is not a reformer he is a prophet not a reformer show me where one prophet ever started a church age he's not a reformer he is a prophet now now again paul paul uh brother brown is explaining what paul's talking about here when he when he's speaking of perfection when paul's talking about leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection back to the back to the original word original understanding of the word where brother ram said in the feast of trumpets he said and now through the church ages have done the same and the seven seals is to reveal all the mysteries that was left off during that time because we're without prophets and the word does not come to reformers prophets amen we can make a decision and next year we can think better we got a better idea of it next year god can he's infinite his first decision is perfect nothing can move it i can learn more we are finite i can learn more you can learn more but god can't learn more that's what that's what reformation is when you're learning more and you're you're you're piecing things together but perfection comes by the prophet's message he is perfect to begin with and therefore his first decision rest your soul upon it what the bible says that's it now i see where paul's beginning to get into um he's beginning to get into not staying with the word and not going on to perfection so brother bram is in the first seal he said what happened when the reformer died and his message died out you organized it and put a bunch of rickies in there and started the thing right back to live the way you wanted to you didn't want to stay with the word instead of moving right on with the word they stayed right there and this is it you don't do that so when he says let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god to really understand this next little section of scripture i'm going to skip over the next few verses and go straight to verse 7 and 8 where he says for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off the opponent and bringeth forth herbs and meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned so perfection is like it's like a you plant a seed into the ground and you and you wait until it comes up and then you can see the fruit that's born you plant a little acorn in the ground and you wait and you watch and that and the tree grows up until it's a great big oak tree and then you can say well okay there's another acorn coming off that oak tree so it came up and it bore fruit the same thing with thorns it you you you plant that kind of a seed and eventually it's going to come up and you can tell oh well that that's not a wheat plant that's something else so we're growing up to a place where you can look back and see where you came from so you can see your story yeah for the earth which drink it so but see what what matters everything the rain's falling on on the just and the unjust on the thorns on the end and the wheat that every it's the it's fallen on the true and the false but when it comes up and manifest itself after all that time then you can tell what kind of seed was originally planted so that's where if we go back to the scriptures that i just skipped over and start to digest this so again set in your mind to understand this that we're talking about perfection i'm always i only have like a couple more minutes so we'll we'll continue this next time this but think about perfection and this will help you to understand this scripture where paul says and this will we do if god permit to go on perfect to perfection for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again under repentance seeing they crucified in themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame so paul's talking about laying a foundation and going on to perfection he's talking about staying with the word he's comparing that with the uh martin the word moving through martin luther's age and john wesley's age and azusa street pentecost and coming on down to the end time and what happens if you don't stay with the word as the word continues to move because we're trying to we're moving toward perfection is is it that's why i see he's so often hit on is is you can't live under the the message of a previous age it would not have worked for for moses to be preaching noah's messenger or uh john wesley would be preaching martin luther's message because the word keeps moving on it keeps growing and you got to stay with the word you think about verse 6 rather he says if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and what happens what happened when jesus was crucified he was crucified because the word was rejected and see when the word is rejected you're turning away from the word and that crucifies him that you're killing the word because you're turning away for you reject it so if you reject it if you reject the word that jesus is going to die again so in verse 4 he says for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift as the musicians come forward we'll we'll maybe stop on this and continue it next time and we'll make partakers of the holy ghost brother brown said in the anointed ones at the end time he was in the blades he was in the tassel he was in the shuck but now he's in the grain he said now you go back and try to live again what if that life took back down you think that left life would ever talk go back after that old shuck has dried up ever go back and live in it again it never does for it is impossible for those which were once enlightened and didn't move on with the word as it came to pass they are dead gone and the thorns and thistles which is nigh under rejection whose end is to be burned is that right and so we'll continue that thought next time god bless you [Applause] foreign you
