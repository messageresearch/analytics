[32:39] Philippians 2 Lord Jesus we thank you
[32:43] for your grace and your love and to us
[32:44] thank you for everything and we pray
[32:47] that you would just bless us without
[32:48] understanding that we may walk in the
[32:51] light of your love forgive our sins as
[32:53] many of what we need and just cover us
[32:55] and let the blood Lord be upon us as a
[32:58] part of the body of Jesus Christ and we
[33:00] believe that Lord you have allowed us to
[33:03] enter into Goshen as the children of
[33:06] Israel had a place to be when everything
[33:08] was going wrong for everybody and and
[33:10] then we were in the people that were in
[33:13] Goshen and we get to be in that to take
[33:15] care of us and just bless and guide and
[33:18] remember the sick among us and just
[33:20] touch each one that's your loving grace
[33:23] be there and Father forgive our sins the
[33:26] leaders by like an understanding in
[33:28] Jesus name you mean seasons 1 we'll just
[33:35] go for verse 3 and 4 blessed be the God
[33:38] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[33:40] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[33:42] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[33:45] according as he has chosen us in him now
[33:49] chosen us in him before the foundation
[33:51] of the world that we should
[33:53] be holy and without blame before him in
[33:55] love now let's go over to Philippians I
[33:59] bring this one because I know this is
[34:02] speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ I know
[34:05] that we understand but yet if the mind
[34:08] that was in him being you all right so
[34:12] now it's speaking of us okay everybody
[34:15] understands me we know it speaking of
[34:17] the Lord Jesus Christ but if that mind
[34:19] be in us that'll make us the same people
[34:22] all right so that's what we want to do
[34:24] first 5 let this mind be in you which
[34:27] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[34:30] the form of God thought it not robbery
[34:32] to be equal with God now if he thought
[34:34] it not robbery by that mind what are we
[34:38] supposed to do by that same mind yeah
[34:43] but that's just a little bit no it's not
[34:45] a little bit too much it's not far
[34:46] enough ok but made himself of no
[34:49] reputation took upon him the form of a
[34:52] servant and was made in the likeness of
[34:54] men and being found in a fashion as a
[34:57] man he humbled himself and became
[34:59] obedient unto death even the death of
[35:01] the Cross you may be seated the Lord at
[35:03] his blessing to the reading of the word
[35:14] know what has been I thought what we
[35:17] been talking on comparing and seeing
[35:21] what predestination is and looking about
[35:24] how that God does things how that he can
[35:28] predestinate things but he has to do it
[35:32] a certain way because if not then he
[35:34] would pre determining it and we know he
[35:37] doesn't predetermine without giving a
[35:42] opportunity all right because he desired
[35:45] that all people be saved all right so he
[35:49] didn't to predetermine so I'll take this
[35:51] one and I'll leave this one he didn't do
[35:54] that it looks like that in a lot of our
[35:57] thoughts and you read from brother
[35:58] Branham and he'll talk about if you was
[36:01] there you'll always be there you never
[36:03] was I will never be there you you've got
[36:05] a
[36:05] to consider but it's true that's what I
[36:09] like to study about what he's saying you
[36:12] know I'd like to get into the thoughts
[36:15] eaters like eternal life you say well I
[36:20] brother Dale I believe I always was
[36:23] eternal well now in God's mind that's
[36:28] what we're dealing with in his mind yes
[36:31] all right
[36:32] Jesus stood as the lamb slain before the
[36:35] foundation of the world but that would
[36:39] have never been made effective or had
[36:42] anything to do with me and you had he
[36:44] not died 2,000 years ago right so then
[36:49] we can't just put it well it's all this
[36:51] way it's all that away that's what I'm
[36:53] trying to get you to see that God does
[36:56] not predestinate are predetermine he
[37:00] except by his foreknowledge all right
[37:04] then see if you put if you understood my
[37:07] thoughts life's there Wednesday if you
[37:10] put predestination first then you're
[37:13] going to have him predetermined he's pre
[37:16] determinate if predestination is first
[37:19] all right so everybody understand that
[37:23] if predestination is first he
[37:24] predetermined it and that's the way it's
[37:27] going to be if he predetermined it but
[37:30] if you approach it by foreknowledge and
[37:35] let it be for knowledge being first then
[37:39] let him predestinate by his
[37:41] foreknowledge for seeing it for solid
[37:46] huh then it can come out to the right
[37:49] place that he can predetermine it you
[37:53] know see that's that's where we we get
[37:57] things in their mind and we we think
[37:59] it's because well I've got this quote
[38:01] I've got this I've got this well that's
[38:04] alright that's that's up to you but it
[38:06] ain't up to me and I'm not going to
[38:08] approach it that way cause they can't
[38:10] approach it from one thing what does the
[38:13] Bible say those who he foreknew he did
[38:17] predestinate
[38:18] night all right now he could
[38:21] predestinate by his foreknowledge and
[38:24] not be a respecter of person okay but
[38:31] now the hard part is to try to get us
[38:32] from the human humanity of life and
[38:37] being what we are
[38:38] to take us back in some way and
[38:42] comprehend the foreknowledge of God and
[38:47] comprehend the mind of God well and see
[38:53] you said well I just read oh you just
[38:56] you just don't make it you don't make it
[38:58] like brother so-and-so well okay brother
[39:02] so-and-so's got his we're preaching and
[39:03] I got my way you know you know I'm not
[39:06] gonna change this because of popularity
[39:07] I never have done it anyway it's always
[39:10] been and I've always taught since I come
[39:12] in the message I've always told the
[39:16] foreknowledge of God comes first then he
[39:20] could predetermine from that and not be
[39:23] a respecter of person I've taught it for
[39:25] 50 years so you couldn't come up and say
[39:27] well I didn't hear you before I never
[39:29] heard you preach like you're preaching
[39:31] now well there's something wrong with
[39:32] what you hear it like it was while ago
[39:35] when I just said brother Lewis and
[39:38] everybody in here thought right now for
[39:40] brother Louise gonna preach Wednesday I
[39:41] didn't say that so you you're the ones
[39:45] that predetermined
[39:47] your thoughts and was having me fixing
[39:49] Wednesday already setup and I didn't say
[39:51] it was good you change code you know all
[39:56] right okay when they listen so then to
[40:04] believe in for knowledge being knowledge
[40:11] before of what will take place then we
[40:16] can see how that God can sit back and
[40:20] look down through time and see that King
[40:23] asked for 15 years get to 15 years after
[40:29] the Prophet had done went and told him
[40:31] at your house in order cuz you're gonna
[40:33] die now we can understand that by
[40:35] foreknowledge you'll never comprehend it
[40:38] by pre determining thing so take
[40:42] everything from foreknowledge yes but I
[40:46] I believe always was well there be a
[40:49] place some of these days you'll get to
[40:50] that place can be made right if you have
[40:54] eternal life today that's why I've
[40:56] always quoted or thought I quoted where
[40:58] the Prophet said he said if you have
[41:00] eternal life you always was eternal
[41:02] but now there's the if if you have it it
[41:08] always was but if you don't have it it
[41:12] wasn't right see then that's that way we
[41:17] get to seeing where it is and to see
[41:19] that to study the self existing God of
[41:24] how that he existed alone and there was
[41:31] a time that he had there was nothing
[41:33] with it because of you going self
[41:34] existing then the word itself self
[41:37] existing he existed alone all right now
[41:42] by existing alone he had thoughts in his
[41:46] mind he had thoughts in his mind he was
[41:53] lonely he was lonely
[41:59] he had attributes within him that he
[42:02] wanted to be brought into view and only
[42:06] by approaching it before knowledge
[42:08] because he bring it to view how could he
[42:12] predestinate mean you'll find quotes if
[42:14] you want to I'll help you hunt him up
[42:16] for if you want to run it wild you'll
[42:18] find quotes that sounds like and read
[42:20] around them and say it he predestinated
[42:22] he sent her to be a senator but if
[42:26] you'll take that right me and you can
[42:28] sit down and talk about it if you take
[42:29] it wrong we there's something wrong with
[42:30] what we're saying if it's according let
[42:34] it be according to his mind he existed
[42:40] totally alone all right there wasn't
[42:43] nobody back there with him there was no
[42:45] I
[42:45] there were no Europeans they wouldn't
[42:47] know they were created and they brought
[42:49] in to Pais about two pies the attributes
[42:53] that God had within him was to bring it
[42:56] forth you better be careful how you
[42:59] bring those things because you hear
[43:02] brother Branham saying the first thing
[43:04] God created was angels and they
[43:07] worshiped him right now what about the
[43:10] next time when he's talking about
[43:16] Genesis 1:26 and 27 then he made God God
[43:20] made man in his own image he made a
[43:23] spirit man before he made us a natural
[43:25] man
[43:26] he made a spirit man before he made an
[43:28] angel come on don't you believe that his
[43:36] own children would be the first to come
[43:38] into being I don't to be enough sense
[43:42] out of it his children would what he was
[43:45] wants to bring into being all right see
[43:50] thins the self-existing God dwelt
[43:52] totally alone there were nothing with
[43:55] him nothing he said well I just can't
[43:56] understand that well I don't say that I
[43:59] do I just believe it because if I'm
[44:03] gonna believe that he was God is God
[44:05] ever was God ever can be garderen then
[44:08] his mind don't operate like ours and he
[44:11] said my thoughts are not your thoughts
[44:12] my ways are not your ways all right then
[44:17] what are we talking about see he dwelt
[44:21] alone with his thoughts we'll get to
[44:25] that as we go along to the message part
[44:27] but I want you to hold that thought for
[44:31] knowledge comes first and then that way
[44:35] he can see and predetermined and not be
[44:41] a respecter of person but if
[44:44] predetermined comes first then you have
[44:47] no choice that should be sensible all
[44:52] right what did I just don't get the
[44:54] great revelation you seem to have or
[44:56] what you talking about
[44:57] well there's to listen to what the
[44:58] prophet
[44:59] said well well I heard to probably say
[45:02] there's no heard the prophets say this
[45:03] and I don't know which ones right
[45:07] 99% of the time both of them right in
[45:09] which this mean you messed up and wrong
[45:11] all right because he see us according to
[45:15] what he's trying to explain all right
[45:18] now remember if he's self-existing
[45:24] nobody existed with him we wouldn't
[45:28] little bitty people running around
[45:30] Mormon exist doctrines and things we
[45:34] didn't believe and don't believe in pre
[45:36] existence of souls because if you got
[45:41] pre existence of souls then you'd have
[45:43] pre existence of whatever you
[45:45] pre-existing as right did you did you
[45:50] follow that if you got pre existence
[45:53] from so then you got pre existence or
[45:55] whatever you are you know but I just
[46:01] don't I just you know that's like what
[46:03] is that they do it like this only
[46:04] Napoleon sort of back there you know
[46:07] well be wouldn't the pole in and stay
[46:09] back there I'm trying my best to get you
[46:12] to understand one time that whatever God
[46:17] had in his mind before knew all about it
[46:23] and it's going to come to pass the way
[46:29] before knew it whatever it takes
[46:35] whatever he does it's going to be
[46:38] because and that does not predetermine
[46:42] it and not giving you a choice for
[46:47] knowledge will always give you a choice
[46:49] and God will not override your free
[46:52] moral agency he allows us a choice but
[46:58] see then we take it and that's where we
[47:00] go with it and we run with it yeah but
[47:02] you spend you spent two or three
[47:03] services are talking about how God chose
[47:05] us that's right he chose us
[47:10] howdy juicers in his mind by his
[47:14] foreknowledge solves the problem he saw
[47:18] your choice but if you didn't make a
[47:21] choice and you haven't made a choice
[47:23] then you're not a Christian you must
[47:29] accept what he has said you must accept
[47:35] what he has said and receive eternal
[47:38] life see now you've got it in a line
[47:42] that you can understand the whole Bible
[47:43] and you can see that King getting 15
[47:46] years well it's like I told you where
[47:48] did it change back there that we want to
[47:50] look at it say well he changed his mind
[47:52] or did say he sent him down or said thus
[47:54] saith the Lord you're gonna die this
[47:56] house in order
[48:00] well you mean it messed it all up just
[48:03] cause God allowed him 15 years to be
[48:09] added he died so where did that change
[48:13] the Word of God he told him he's gonna
[48:15] die he died he just put an extension in
[48:18] the middle allowed him a situation that
[48:21] was to me as I think about it like this
[48:25] I think it was wonderful matter of fact
[48:28] it's the only man in the Bible that I
[48:30] can remember that was given time maybe
[48:34] you can if we do that's all right
[48:35] but he was given time so he was in
[48:37] contact with Garden good enough to get
[48:39] 15 years we were to start looking things
[48:44] like that instead of looking at it
[48:46] trying to figure out Oliver do it
[48:47] alright but now listen pre-existence
[48:53] means existence before all right now if
[49:00] there's any such thing of me and you
[49:02] being in existence before then let's go
[49:04] find us a good Mormon doctrinal Church
[49:06] and start a church with them
[49:08] because that's what they believe with
[49:09] this with that with all up in heaven
[49:11] you've heard me tell it and it's crazy
[49:13] but you know I know it because it's
[49:15] their doctrine everybody was up in
[49:19] heaven everybody the world was up in
[49:21] heaven
[49:22] that's a Mormon doctrine of
[49:24] pre-existence not just a few so
[49:27] everybody was there and he was trying to
[49:30] figure out how to satisfy our Father and
[49:36] by doing that a decision was made Satan
[49:40] had a decision or The Anointed cherub
[49:44] had the decision to save everybody Jesus
[49:52] came up with a decision to save some of
[49:54] them yeah you go find you one talk to
[49:59] him see what their doctor knee is okay
[50:01] look it up on your Wikipedia and get
[50:04] your things look it up find it find out
[50:06] what you're talking about see if I'm
[50:07] right
[50:08] faint come tell me about it see I could
[50:14] Satan come up with a better idea than
[50:15] Jesus that don't make sense
[50:19] that's kind of like arminianism and
[50:22] Calvinism Calvinism so many can be saved
[50:27] not everybody Arminianism everybody can
[50:30] be saved I try to bring out something
[50:35] like that and you you you get all
[50:37] tangled I guess in your mind to try to
[50:38] figure out why didn't the world Utama
[50:40] I'm talking about one time exactly what
[50:43] the Prophet said questions and answers
[50:46] there I was reading it to you the other
[50:47] day he said talking about mankind he
[50:51] said where we spirits in other words
[50:53] back there he said no we wasn't nothing
[50:56] we was only in the mind of God and he
[50:59] said really usually the word
[51:00] figuratively in the mind of God
[51:04] all right sounds a problem well I got
[51:09] this quote where was always back there
[51:11] what was it tell me what was always back
[51:14] there what part of you was back before
[51:17] the world
[51:22] your body listen no we don't believe
[51:24] that what did you spirit what did you so
[51:28] what part of you was back there because
[51:33] then you could talk about pre-existence
[51:35] but if you don't have pre-existence then
[51:40] you can go and that's like I've always
[51:42] said you start this pre determining be
[51:47] careful you might predestinate yourself
[51:51] clean out of existence because there was
[51:55] a time that God dwelt alone do you agree
[51:59] with that all right if he dwelt alone
[52:04] self-existing by himself then they could
[52:07] not be anything there with him yeah but
[52:11] you just don't make me feel good well
[52:13] what do you own the peace I run down
[52:15] your backbone no you want to shout you
[52:20] want to speak in tongues you want to
[52:21] have a good time doing like that and not
[52:23] listening to what the Bible is saying
[52:26] why should it be any argument or
[52:29] thoughts or anything about
[52:30] predestination when your Bible says
[52:34] those he foreknew he did predestinate
[52:35] your prophet I gave it to you over and
[52:37] over and over where he said what
[52:39] predestination looks back to for
[52:41] knowledge for knowledge looks all the
[52:43] way the other one so this shouldn't be
[52:49] well I just don't believe it that way
[52:51] you mean you don't change me okay let me
[52:56] get off of myself
[52:57] we ended up Wednesday night talking
[53:00] about what what is the foreknowledge of
[53:03] God it would be the mind of God or his
[53:06] mind or his being and he dwelt alone
[53:09] with just his thoughts his attributes he
[53:17] had in his mind to be a father he had no
[53:21] children
[53:23] and in his mind to be a healer
[53:25] nothing was sick and all of those
[53:29] attributes within him
[53:30] that he wanted to have displayed right
[53:35] yeah and see like I said there amigo if
[53:40] he dwelt alone then he was lonely come
[53:42] on I got two quotes for you find a
[53:44] prophet where he said to what about Adam
[53:45] he said that's what god looked down so I
[53:48] had him the same as he was he was lonely
[53:51] he was all alone so he created him a
[53:55] helpmeet right where he wouldn't be
[53:58] alone and he said he'll never be alone
[54:02] again I love that so you don't take it
[54:05] out you don't take self-existing out of
[54:09] the dictionary you leave it there that's
[54:12] a self existing now exist with his
[54:14] family now he exists with his family so
[54:22] he doesn't exist alone anymore
[54:27] no matter how bad we look or what we are
[54:30] you know I mean I've had times you know
[54:35] you won't kick the kids right but you
[54:39] know I had never done it yet
[54:41] ain't throw them out the door Oh them
[54:45] you know wait didn't have to be kicked
[54:48] yeah but listen it's not based then upon
[54:57] the way we think it's simple to base it
[55:01] the way the prophets explains it the
[55:04] Bible explains it the prophets
[55:07] explaining what the Bible said that he
[55:10] dwelt alone within his mind in his
[55:15] thinking of what he wanted to be done he
[55:22] had desires not that everybody you know
[55:24] that I picked this and won't pick that
[55:26] he didn't go that way
[55:27] he had his desires to display his
[55:29] attributes and to display those
[55:33] attributes I don't you know I don't get
[55:38] our thinking maybe sorry I don't get our
[55:41] thinking that we look at sickness like
[55:44] some kind of a bad thing
[55:45] and I know it is but you know that
[55:49] but you being sick that means your daddy
[55:51] can display his attribute he had an
[55:57] attribute of being a healer
[55:58] you know if wouldn't know I wouldn't see
[56:01] it he couldn't see we look at being lost
[56:07] come on
[56:09] God knew the Prophet said when he
[56:13] created Adam and Eve that they would
[56:15] fall but he could not make them fall
[56:19] predetermine it or said it or anything
[56:22] he had to give them a choice but if he's
[56:27] God he knew the choice hmm he knew
[56:33] exactly what they would do but you know
[56:35] what that would do that would bring into
[56:36] his attribute that he could display as a
[56:42] healer or a savior who were helping him
[56:46] display his attributes when you're
[56:50] working it look is sickness no the
[56:52] sickness ain't displaying it the
[56:54] sickness is the part that you just did
[56:56] inherit by natural healing is the
[56:59] attribute there's not an attribute of
[57:02] sickness healing is the attribute
[57:07] salvation is the attribute not to being
[57:10] lost as an act that's not an attribute
[57:12] that's just the point that is used to
[57:14] help bring to pice what is supposed to
[57:16] be in don't dwell among us listen
[57:21] so foreknowledge is the fact of God's
[57:25] mind and you could go back into God's
[57:29] mind and see what his desires are he
[57:36] told his disciples in John 15 says I
[57:40] chose you you know ordains you
[57:46] he told Jeremiah Jeremiah 1 I knew you
[57:51] and ordained you to be a prophet before
[57:53] the world ever begun
[58:00] uh-huh
[58:01] where we spirits in no we was in his
[58:04] mind all right let's just read a few of
[58:07] these about his mind where we can can
[58:10] really get into the point okay I want to
[58:14] make sure you follow my point okay they
[58:17] can pull them up and follow him and feel
[58:18] it too with number three which is
[58:23] nothing more than that faith and he saw
[58:25] what he had done he saw much Satan God
[58:28] first begin to think oh my that's when
[58:33] he saw you
[58:37] oh let's see that be number three
[58:42] I don't know excuse me number four
[58:44] number four faith there you go now we
[58:49] got he saw what he had done he's talking
[58:53] about Satan I read it he's coming this
[58:55] one minute he's I'm not Satan he
[58:57] preferred him when he saw what he had
[58:59] done the God first begin to think oh my
[59:03] that's when he saw you that's when he
[59:06] saw me Amen when he began to think he
[59:16] began to think about being a healer he
[59:21] began to think about being a savior he
[59:24] began to think about being a father
[59:25] he began to think about all of these
[59:28] things in his mind in his mind he felt
[59:34] these things over in his thinking now
[59:38] I'm quoting brother Bronco they're all
[59:39] three together mind or any thinking or
[59:41] in his that's his thoughts he says and
[59:47] his thoughts returnable okay the word is
[59:53] thought Express so then as long as it
[59:57] was a thought it wasn't materialized
[1:00:02] come on Jesus died before the foundation
[1:00:09] of the world for our sins
[1:00:12] but as I said while ago if that stayed
[1:00:15] without him coming 2,000 years we'll go
[1:00:18] to bring it into materialization or
[1:00:21] bring it into reality then you're still
[1:00:23] in your sins you're still lost are you
[1:00:30] following me so then as long as it was a
[1:00:34] thought it wasn't materialized it wasn't
[1:00:38] it couldn't be yet but when God once
[1:00:41] expressed it it was as good as finished
[1:00:45] right then oh my that would make a
[1:00:47] president of Pentecostal shout think of
[1:00:50] it God before the foundation of the
[1:00:53] world saw you you wasn't Dyer but you
[1:01:02] was in his mind he wasn't there
[1:01:10] where we spirit no we wasn't nothing was
[1:01:13] in his mind he wasn't dire he saw it
[1:01:22] there for foreknowledge he could
[1:01:24] foretell that's really like in this
[1:01:28] prophecy he goes okay we're number five
[1:01:31] who is this melchester
[1:01:34] now those who Hallie tonight eternal
[1:01:37] life
[1:01:37] was with him and in him was with him and
[1:01:44] in him if he had eternal life he was
[1:01:47] with him in India
[1:01:48] sure if you have eternal life because it
[1:01:52] goes this far that way but what does he
[1:01:53] say what in his thinking okay come on
[1:01:57] before there whatever was an angel star
[1:02:00] chariot marina that's an eternal and if
[1:02:03] you have eternal life you always was not
[1:02:06] your being here with the shape and
[1:02:09] formed that the infinite God in other
[1:02:12] words this thought is mine
[1:02:14] not your being here if you're gonna put
[1:02:18] listen to let me just say these things I
[1:02:19] try to make you think by making a
[1:02:22] thought or a subject in front of if
[1:02:24] you're going to go back there as a
[1:02:26] or so why not just go back as a whole
[1:02:28] being right I mean if you don't go back
[1:02:34] as and so once you just go back after
[1:02:35] everything when all we can't do it well
[1:02:40] then you keep on dropping them out you
[1:02:42] kind of like that guy was telling me I
[1:02:44] used to talk to this brother at work and
[1:02:46] then he said duh I said well I can see
[1:02:51] one thing for sure there's not a Trinity
[1:02:55] good he said you've convinced me of that
[1:02:58] but he said there's two of them I said
[1:03:04] well now why don't you just go ahead and
[1:03:05] do away with one of them you'll come
[1:03:07] back and talk about what we're talking
[1:03:08] about there's just one true and living
[1:03:09] God you don't get it to one if you're
[1:03:14] gonna get it let's see he had enough
[1:03:16] knowledge to know that one of them got
[1:03:17] done away with so we get only how to
[1:03:20] know okay go ahead in number six which
[1:03:29] is proving his word eternal life you
[1:03:32] always was see you have eternal life
[1:03:35] there's only one form of that of it
[1:03:37] that's God you were his attribute he
[1:03:46] thought of you and knows you before the
[1:03:48] foundation of the world in his mind we
[1:03:54] wasn't dire as people we wasn't there as
[1:03:59] identities we wasn't dire as Souls
[1:04:07] that's kind of like the people of the
[1:04:09] message you know they say God give you
[1:04:10] so Satan give you so the Bible said all
[1:04:12] souls are mine that's what it says I
[1:04:16] think it's the collating for he's at all
[1:04:19] shoulder mind well let's just get him
[1:04:21] out of it
[1:04:22] do you understand see we say what but we
[1:04:27] just read the part if you have eternal
[1:04:29] life if you have eternal after not that
[1:04:32] eternal life things this into him before
[1:04:33] the world a man I agree with it but that
[1:04:36] don't put me back her
[1:04:41] Jesus has a quoted twice died for the
[1:04:44] sins of the world before the world come
[1:04:46] into existence right with he had to come
[1:04:51] 2,000 years ago in in physical natural
[1:04:54] happening and paid that price we just
[1:04:57] still all be sinners so his mind is not
[1:05:01] the fact of being reality it is to him
[1:05:06] but it's not to me in you he dwelt alone
[1:05:14] then it will get to it if we're getting
[1:05:16] time and we'll get to it on Chrysler
[1:05:18] ministry then it's mine that comes into
[1:05:20] being and as it does you see things
[1:05:22] start coming into being but just
[1:05:28] remember you better remember what came
[1:05:31] into being first who knows what could we
[1:05:36] knows what the Prophet said came into
[1:05:38] being first you waiting on me don't you
[1:05:47] there was a time that he existed alone
[1:05:52] he's by himself but you know there was a
[1:05:56] time that he came into being and I quote
[1:06:02] the Prophet God's first creation was
[1:06:07] himself now if you want to get you mind
[1:06:11] tangling up into things and get out of
[1:06:13] this stuff that we think is called
[1:06:15] revelation get into what the Prophet is
[1:06:16] saying God existed along
[1:06:30] so what was his first creation the
[1:06:34] probably said himself what's he talking
[1:06:37] about
[1:06:37] something came into being and what did
[1:06:42] he say that was he said it was the Sun
[1:06:49] you want those quotes I'll get to it one
[1:06:52] these days and for each other his son
[1:06:56] and who is his son word see we think we
[1:07:03] get it all figured out in our mind and
[1:07:04] then something happens then well I could
[1:07:07] follow that brother
[1:07:08] but I just can't follow you cut it no
[1:07:10] one listened go back and read a little
[1:07:12] bit go to number seven go back up hold
[1:07:18] it come on we missed that part okay he's
[1:07:23] talking about people in representation
[1:07:27] the priest did down no representation
[1:07:29] right which a little woman had a
[1:07:32] representation yeah but no
[1:07:36] representation in heaven see wasn't in
[1:07:39] God's thinking at all but this woman was
[1:07:43] now what's he saying the woman was in
[1:07:47] his thinking what the priest wasn't in
[1:07:49] his thinking now he thought about the
[1:07:52] priest right it was necessary for him to
[1:07:58] think about everything but it's like I
[1:08:00] keep saying to you everything God thinks
[1:08:02] of he's not eternal
[1:08:04] you see if I was just in God's mind if I
[1:08:07] just
[1:08:07] Satan The Anointed cherub was in God's
[1:08:11] mind everybody in the world is in God's
[1:08:17] mind he said no it wasn't in his mind no
[1:08:24] they wouldn't in his thinking so what's
[1:08:28] the thinking about see God thought of a
[1:08:32] little bride and he knew she'd come in
[1:08:37] to be
[1:08:38] huh he knew that but he knew it would
[1:08:42] take a long time to bring the pies go
[1:08:46] ahead go to number seven the God who is
[1:08:51] rich in mercy now if you've got eternal
[1:08:53] life or not if we have eternal life then
[1:08:56] we always were I don't mind quoting that
[1:09:00] that's no problem to me that don't put
[1:09:03] me back before the world except in God's
[1:09:05] mind or as a part of him because if I
[1:09:10] have eternal life now I'm a part of him
[1:09:12] I'm a child of him I'm a part of God by
[1:09:17] the new birth right come on then if we
[1:09:23] have eternal life then we always work
[1:09:25] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:09:28] life we always would the reason we were
[1:09:31] because we are a part of God oh and God
[1:09:36] is the only thing that's eternal man
[1:09:39] keep going just follow that orange
[1:09:42] marker yellow now we are part of God you
[1:09:46] always was you don't remember it because
[1:09:50] you were only an attribute in God you
[1:09:53] were only in his thinking there was no
[1:10:01] literal you back there he was in his
[1:10:05] thinking then you had to come into the
[1:10:10] world to be you come on but when God had
[1:10:18] you in his thinking at the beginning you
[1:10:22] have to be some part of you your life
[1:10:25] that's in you now had to be with God
[1:10:27] before there whatever well when he
[1:10:31] before he ever become material here on
[1:10:33] earth before there was anything but God
[1:10:36] you were one of his attributes
[1:10:39] he knows what your name would be he
[1:10:42] knowed the color of your hair you know
[1:10:44] everything the he knowed all about you
[1:10:47] you know only thing happened is when you
[1:10:51] be
[1:10:52] of being listener he he knew it
[1:10:59] see we couldn't come into the world as
[1:11:02] born-again believers if we did that
[1:11:06] would annihilate the Redeemer situation
[1:11:09] and it would do away with him
[1:11:13] what book of a brother brother Brad
[1:11:15] about how close to a brother on center
[1:11:17] always was eternal will read right back
[1:11:19] a bugger if you have eternal life then
[1:11:25] the eternal life you have always was
[1:11:27] eternal amen
[1:11:30] but there was a day I didn't have it now
[1:11:33] there are where the trouble comes in it
[1:11:35] there was a time I didn't have it I had
[1:11:39] to receive it same as there was a time
[1:11:42] Jesus had to come and die on earth to
[1:11:46] redeem me and you what was before the
[1:11:48] world didn't redeem you because we never
[1:11:56] come into a reality or a materialization
[1:11:58] or a time or did God had to come and
[1:12:01] give you eternal life yeah but I always
[1:12:04] was eternal the eternal life that you
[1:12:06] have always was eternal it's no problem
[1:12:11] but as I said be careful you're going to
[1:12:14] predetermine yourself out of existence
[1:12:17] because if you keep going back that away
[1:12:19] and backpacks that foreknowledge back
[1:12:22] into his mind back into the point of him
[1:12:24] being self existing you went out of
[1:12:27] existence
[1:12:29] and may not make no sense to you but if
[1:12:31] she likes a lot to me yeah but I just
[1:12:37] feel like I was back there I just feel
[1:12:39] it and brother Dale when you preach it I
[1:12:41] just don't get them to you boy well
[1:12:42] brother so-and-so it's kind of like a
[1:12:44] nothing's called a names when we went to
[1:12:47] a service one time and their sister she
[1:12:49] this brother was a preaching boy he was
[1:12:51] really going and she was up with him and
[1:12:53] she was she was running and going and
[1:12:55] next day I said sister I said oh I don't
[1:12:59] want to say anything about it but I said
[1:13:01] you was shouting about what that
[1:13:03] brothers preaching and he
[1:13:05] priest alive from when he started the
[1:13:08] whole message was this alive
[1:13:11] well I felt good well okay what does
[1:13:17] that got to do about to work I like to
[1:13:25] read and I used to it you know I got
[1:13:28] another minute but I used to love to
[1:13:30] read old western you know I could get
[1:13:33] involved with him and riding the horses
[1:13:35] and going along shooting everybody you
[1:13:38] know I could do that in my mind you
[1:13:43] ain't never been that away okay
[1:13:46] just blaming him okay but listen God's
[1:13:52] thoughts are eternal the what he thought
[1:13:56] of is not eternal he thought of Judas he
[1:14:01] thought of the world he thought her
[1:14:04] eventually has to become eternal to
[1:14:06] fulfill the word right are you following
[1:14:10] me
[1:14:10] okay let's go ahead let's see forty six
[1:14:18] paragraph what does it take to make a
[1:14:22] Christian forty yeah now a word is a
[1:14:28] thought expressed God had in his mind
[1:14:30] what to do but when he expressed it it
[1:14:36] had to become into existence it became
[1:14:40] it become a reality because it was God's
[1:14:44] Word Express and there isn't that may
[1:14:49] you take me to record this morning there
[1:14:52] isn't enough power and all hell can ever
[1:14:55] defeat the purpose of God God will do it
[1:15:00] anyhow that's what I love
[1:15:02] he's got a group of people sure that are
[1:15:05] predestinated yes because I for
[1:15:08] knowledge he knew exactly what we do and
[1:15:11] he had it waiting on us but he knew
[1:15:13] there was a lot of people in the world
[1:15:15] would never receive it
[1:15:19] he knew that if he didn't he wouldn't
[1:15:22] God huh
[1:15:24] come on let's get a little more than
[1:15:26] will quit listen Eve we have to know
[1:15:29] God's his own the interpreter what I
[1:15:33] mean attributes was his thoughts and a
[1:15:36] word is a thought expressed and then
[1:15:38] that was in his thinking and when he
[1:15:42] said let there be and there was let
[1:15:45] there be in their work and now remember
[1:15:47] you Christians were his thoughts before
[1:15:49] there was a world and you are the
[1:15:53] manifestation of his thinking he had
[1:16:02] thought he had attributes do you think
[1:16:06] no I won't back up her do you think the
[1:16:10] only attributes God had was a healer any
[1:16:14] form like that no his first attribute
[1:16:16] was to be a father to have a family you
[1:16:24] think he ain't gonna have that but you
[1:16:28] know what you explained it to me I want
[1:16:31] somebody to explain what made him choose
[1:16:33] you and reject somebody else I want you
[1:16:38] to explain that to me I've studied it
[1:16:41] for 50 years I want you to explain what
[1:16:44] made him do the choosing if we do it the
[1:16:47] way we think now the way we think we
[1:16:52] think there was something about us but
[1:16:56] I'll remind you of one thing in the
[1:16:59] Bible those that you talk about the
[1:17:01] predestinated they did have something to
[1:17:04] do with it could it be that he's looking
[1:17:13] at me and you could it be he's following
[1:17:19] her
[1:17:28] come on
[1:17:32] it is in that in the next verse in
[1:17:39] Ephesians where he predestinated us unto
[1:17:44] adoption if there's not something about
[1:17:47] the children of God that are wonderful
[1:17:49] to him why does he want him to act like
[1:17:52] him and knowing that somebody will do it
[1:17:59] somebody's going to act like a child of
[1:18:02] God why can't we start doing it brother
[1:18:08] till I love the Lord oh that's true but
[1:18:11] then we study the word and try to get it
[1:18:13] to the basis that we can take what I'm
[1:18:14] saying
[1:18:26] let's get number 10
[1:18:32] now in his thinking what he had the
[1:18:37] whole plan knowing the end from the
[1:18:41] beginning now what he had the whole plan
[1:18:47] so God had a plan according to Christ a
[1:18:51] mystery God revealed a plan and a
[1:18:53] purpose that he was going to achieve
[1:18:58] then we go to the attributes of healer
[1:19:01] Savior etc etc and we can see that all
[1:19:05] of that has been fulfilled his plan and
[1:19:09] his purpose is here now a group of
[1:19:12] people that will walk towards that
[1:19:13] statue of a perfect man and accept
[1:19:15] what's being done come on
[1:19:20] because he just expressed it in the
[1:19:23] words and those words are manifested you
[1:19:29] followed me
[1:19:32] may I say it again for you to understand
[1:19:35] Jesus Christ died before the world but
[1:19:42] that was only in his mind it was not in
[1:19:45] reality
[1:19:50] come on when he come into flesh it
[1:19:55] became a reality and it became to what
[1:19:59] would be the Savior the healer the
[1:20:02] delivery all of that had to wait until
[1:20:05] that time they come into manifestation
[1:20:12] so then what were we back there in his
[1:20:15] mind in his thinking when he thought of
[1:20:21] the world he thought of me and you but
[1:20:23] he thought of everybody I don't
[1:20:26] understand why people can't say that
[1:20:27] well I tell you what we're something
[1:20:29] special thing but one thing special
[1:20:32] about me and you and that's the blood of
[1:20:33] Jesus Christ
[1:20:35] the baptism of the holy go through the
[1:20:37] only thing that's good about me and you
[1:20:39] and without that we are no good come on
[1:20:45] keep going
[1:20:47] what are we never 11 okay remember
[1:20:51] there's only one form of eternal life an
[1:20:54] hour even our names in our thoughts were
[1:20:56] with God before there was a foundation
[1:20:59] of the world because now we put this
[1:21:02] eternal now we possess it
[1:21:06] why because it was factored in his mind
[1:21:11] before there was a foundation in the
[1:21:13] world and now we possess and to be that
[1:21:15] we have to be a part of God come on if
[1:21:20] you don't get nothing out of the message
[1:21:21] remember one time the only thing that's
[1:21:24] worth anything in you is the baptism of
[1:21:26] the Holy Ghost and that makes us a part
[1:21:28] of God that makes us the children of God
[1:21:30] we're not children God call we join a
[1:21:32] church believe a prophet called we do
[1:21:34] this but we do that we're Christians and
[1:21:36] part of God because we're born again
[1:21:39] that is the only thing that can make us
[1:21:41] a part of God is the new birth yeah
[1:21:46] glory in that Park let's see the rotis
[1:21:53] on the side and go ahead a number two
[1:21:57] oil let's just read a couple throwing it
[1:22:01] on that you read before then and see if
[1:22:05] I'm taking it out of tax really are you
[1:22:07] the predestinated or no no God and we're
[1:22:12] in the mind of God and his thoughts they
[1:22:15] these are who are the royal seat are the
[1:22:18] elect of God are the predestinated for
[1:22:21] no no God and we're in the mind of God
[1:22:23] in this house and very plain language
[1:22:25] the true bride across was in the mind of
[1:22:28] God eternally that's no problem that
[1:22:34] don't make me in youth are eternally
[1:22:37] we're in his mind and his mind is
[1:22:41] eternal come on you say what button you
[1:22:46] talking about herself his mind is he
[1:22:48] turning you
[1:22:49] he didn't know that senator was gonna
[1:22:50] die it's - eternal he knew the sinners
[1:22:57] don't die
[1:22:58] he knew that there's people that would
[1:23:00] accept him as their Savior but he knew
[1:23:02] there's people that would not accept him
[1:23:04] that doubts eternal and he can add to it
[1:23:07] or take away that's what I was getting
[1:23:09] at with the man was asking for 15 years
[1:23:11] God didn't come down and predetermine
[1:23:15] this to be come back real race it wife
[1:23:17] and output another pre determining he
[1:23:20] told a man you'll die the extended 15
[1:23:24] years he died it didn't break the Word
[1:23:30] of God and it wasn't God changing his
[1:23:34] mind he just knew he could do that
[1:23:36] remember the little girl that the
[1:23:37] Prophet spoke of and he told her she was
[1:23:43] gonna live and she's she's healed she
[1:23:45] died the next day he told God said you
[1:23:50] owe me an answer
[1:23:52] he said God let him fight it out for
[1:23:54] about two couple two or three months he
[1:23:57] said any come and explained since she
[1:23:58] was supposed to died a year before that
[1:24:00] I allowed her to live that long now are
[1:24:03] you gonna say that God changed his mind
[1:24:05] no he just permitted more time see if we
[1:24:10] think this thing is a set down stamped
[1:24:15] if it's set down and stamped walk on the
[1:24:17] church because we're either saved or
[1:24:20] loved if we saved we own the way if we
[1:24:23] lost we could never do nothing about it
[1:24:25] according to most people's thinking but
[1:24:31] if you approach it from his mind what is
[1:24:34] that no sin we had a mind to high view
[1:24:36] you know thinking about it okay the very
[1:24:40] plane line was a true Bride of Christ
[1:24:41] was in the mind of God eternally though
[1:24:43] not expressed until each came forth in
[1:24:45] the designated decreed season other
[1:24:48] words came into the world in existence
[1:24:49] as each member came forth
[1:24:52] it became expressed and took his place
[1:24:55] in the body by the new birth
[1:24:59] thus this bride is the literal spoke
[1:25:02] word seed right and though she is
[1:25:06] feminine and designation she's also
[1:25:08] called the body of Christ it is it is
[1:25:12] very apparent that she ought to be
[1:25:14] called that
[1:25:15] for she was predestinated in him he said
[1:25:23] her destiny though he knew what she does
[1:25:26] came from the same source that one is
[1:25:30] where people don't like that one you say
[1:25:32] that and you can just feel that little
[1:25:35] clean from the same source you realize a
[1:25:40] but when he turn alive if you have
[1:25:44] eternal life you have the life of God if
[1:25:49] you don't have eternal life there's no
[1:25:50] way to have the life of God come on now
[1:25:56] is manifesting God in a mini membered
[1:25:58] body whereas once God was manifested and
[1:26:01] one number even our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:03] okay let's see what we got okay go ahead
[1:26:13] I keep trying to get these in or you're
[1:26:18] thinking about in his thinking remember
[1:26:22] you and the stature that you are in this
[1:26:24] morning if you wasn't in his thinking
[1:26:27] then you're not now I keep explaining it
[1:26:35] everybody was anything but he's
[1:26:39] explaining something about you
[1:26:41] personally you're not now for you
[1:26:44] there's some part that's in you that's
[1:26:46] eternal an eternal only belongs to God
[1:26:50] and then God was his thinking of you
[1:26:52] sitting right where you are now in his
[1:26:56] thinking I stood at the pulpit this
[1:26:59] morning because he's infinite and he
[1:27:02] knows all things then you were in his
[1:27:05] thinking at the beginning
[1:27:12] think about it he had in his mind let me
[1:27:18] take just a minute
[1:27:20] then we'll back up and pick up another
[1:27:22] message probably but according to Christ
[1:27:26] the mystery of God revealed
[1:27:27] God had a plan and a purpose he was
[1:27:31] going to see achieved in the back part
[1:27:34] of God's mind you know that's something
[1:27:37] we can't comprehend with the back part
[1:27:40] of God's mind see the front part is you
[1:27:41] think with it you got your conscious
[1:27:43] subconscious etc with the back part of
[1:27:45] this mind
[1:27:46] in other words back into him he thought
[1:27:52] it over
[1:27:53] he said if I make man they'll fall they
[1:27:59] ain't that something you think about God
[1:28:02] you think God ain't got no confidence in
[1:28:04] us God's got confidence in them maybe it
[1:28:07] not not be the way we want it because he
[1:28:10] knew if he made us and gave us a choice
[1:28:13] that we'd fall yeah but you just don't
[1:28:18] make it sounds a good coach I was back
[1:28:20] there and I just feel like back there
[1:28:22] and I come to it and I come to the
[1:28:23] message and I've always believed it I
[1:28:26] was eternal and then I've got the
[1:28:27] message and I know I am because I'm in
[1:28:29] the message well praise the Lord I hope
[1:28:33] you ride let's see God had a plan and a
[1:28:37] purpose he wanted to be a father he
[1:28:44] wanted to be a healer he wanted to be a
[1:28:47] savior these attributes was within him
[1:28:53] the Prophet said he was lonely so he
[1:28:58] created and as he started creating
[1:29:01] that's what I said we take it you take
[1:29:04] two different quotes there's what I'm
[1:29:06] calling the masterpiece one on Christ of
[1:29:08] the mystery of God reveal Christ
[1:29:09] administer of God reveal right around
[1:29:11] the lemes it to the basis of holding
[1:29:13] that eternal life and basing it as his
[1:29:16] thought and if that thought that he had
[1:29:20] is eternal huh
[1:29:22] then you go to another message and it'll
[1:29:25] look like that he's
[1:29:26] moving over a little bit he's not
[1:29:28] leaning over he'll under he's explaining
[1:29:30] it that's like to me why I dwelt with it
[1:29:33] so long to get you to think about it
[1:29:34] Calvinism goes one way our minion is one
[1:29:37] goes the other way as to what we look
[1:29:39] like both of them is in the Bible both
[1:29:42] of them is right but what we think of
[1:29:45] Calvinism is what makes it wrong what we
[1:29:48] think of Arminianism is what makes it
[1:29:50] wrong not what it is it's in the Bible
[1:29:55] see we should take what the Bible says
[1:30:00] and on that crisis of history he's
[1:30:04] looking at the plan and purpose of God
[1:30:08] he was going to see it displayed and
[1:30:13] that is to bring into being all of his
[1:30:16] attributes did that should make us think
[1:30:23] of what we are tonight or today if we
[1:30:26] have eternal life we have the very ACTRA
[1:30:30] beaut of Almighty God living within us
[1:30:35] the very person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:39] lives in you by the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:40] Ghost and that that's dwelling within
[1:30:44] you and I in the new birth always was
[1:30:47] eternal but there was a time I didn't
[1:30:51] possess that well I don't understand
[1:30:55] called is eternal it was eternal I'll
[1:30:59] quote it again
[1:31:00] Jesus died for the sins of the world
[1:31:03] when two thousand years ago but when did
[1:31:06] he really die for the sins of the world
[1:31:07] in the reality two thousand years ago we
[1:31:13] want to make it say what we want it to
[1:31:15] say make it say what the word says
[1:31:24] he had a plan and a purpose now listen
[1:31:30] this is what I like he was going to see
[1:31:34] it achieved you know what that means
[1:31:38] that means he had it and it was going to
[1:31:42] be that sounds like pre determinant it
[1:31:46] is if you leave it to him and you won't
[1:31:54] be pre determining me and you had I'm
[1:32:00] sure love for this body to be
[1:32:01] predetermined some other way wouldn't
[1:32:03] you ain't happy with it I don't know
[1:32:06] where the you are with yours or not I
[1:32:09] sure don't want to think about this as
[1:32:11] being something that he predetermined
[1:32:16] because then my brother would be right
[1:32:18] when he said if God made me the way I am
[1:32:20] said he can't condemn me for being a
[1:32:23] sinner come on you won't touch you want
[1:32:31] to approach the subject he has a good
[1:32:34] point
[1:32:37] he can't judge me if he made me wrong
[1:32:40] but if he gave me a choice I'm judge my
[1:32:45] own self he allowed me a sauce I made my
[1:32:52] choice years ago what did you do
[1:32:57] but you see I thought I knew what that
[1:32:59] choice was and I went for five eight ten
[1:33:03] years thinking that I was saved thinking
[1:33:11] that I was born again but when I heard
[1:33:14] that prophet speaking of eternal life
[1:33:16] the way he spoke of it as being a person
[1:33:24] I knew right then I didn't have the new
[1:33:29] birth what do you mean a person is the
[1:33:33] person of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:36] the person of eternal life coming in
[1:33:39] living in your soul to bring into
[1:33:42] manifestation his plan and his purpose
[1:33:46] he was going to have a bride right it
[1:33:50] was going to bring it into being right
[1:33:53] but bringing it into being the right way
[1:33:55] and then you will not approach it wrong
[1:33:57] and you'll see that we are the
[1:33:59] fulfilment of his plan we are making
[1:34:03] manifest what he's saying but we're the
[1:34:07] endtime bride come on use this were the
[1:34:12] endtime bride thank own these things
[1:34:20] were we back there he said not this
[1:34:25] being that you are right what follow me
[1:34:30] not me I wasn't back there as a person
[1:34:34] as some identity or some thought you'd
[1:34:39] be surprised like I've always said
[1:34:41] brother run said these doctrines they
[1:34:43] come from he said you get this doctor
[1:34:45] and he said you Church it all the way
[1:34:47] back you find it dwelling somewhere else
[1:34:49] and and I remember that that about the
[1:34:52] Mormon doctrine of pre existence and
[1:34:55] then I ran into somebody in this message
[1:34:56] believed in two souls and when I ran
[1:34:59] into that I said listen to two different
[1:35:02] people explained God in two souls and
[1:35:05] both of them explained it's the same one
[1:35:09] of them was supposed to be a minister in
[1:35:10] this message but he was explaining it
[1:35:14] identically as the Mormon doctrine of
[1:35:18] pre existence he those Devils don't die
[1:35:26] those doctrines don't die they just
[1:35:29] moved from one to the other
[1:35:32] what about it let's stand together think
[1:35:35] on these things in his mind what he
[1:35:41] thought of he thought of you the Prophet
[1:35:45] said being right here now
[1:35:47] standing in these pews or sitting he
[1:35:50] thought of that don't you want to be
[1:35:54] part of that you ever get up over
[1:35:57] morning then say Lord what do you want
[1:35:59] me to do today I used to I was an
[1:36:03] absentee replacement door which meant I
[1:36:05] run run a different job every day and
[1:36:08] every morning there at 6 o'clock I'd say
[1:36:10] Lord or am I going today and I have some
[1:36:15] interesting talks with a lot of people
[1:36:16] some very uninterested talks with a lot
[1:36:19] of people and things like that but
[1:36:21] that's that was all right I'll tell you
[1:36:24] one good one there was a a guy I'd said
[1:36:27] something to him about the Bible and he
[1:36:29] looked at me and I could see he was mad
[1:36:30] and I was no he don't talk to you
[1:36:32] anymore
[1:36:33] finally he looked over he said Lord just
[1:36:35] come over and bust you wide grin I said
[1:36:40] you ain't go and do it I'll just call
[1:36:44] that bust you in the mouth I see you
[1:36:46] ain't gonna do it
[1:36:49] I've seen it busted his bubble you know
[1:36:51] so he said how do you know I I said cuz
[1:36:54] you don't know where I'm gonna hit you
[1:36:55] back or not I said I'm only one knows
[1:36:59] that so come on you know what I've been
[1:37:02] good friends I mean it was serious I
[1:37:06] said come on if he'd come over and hit
[1:37:08] me in the mouth I hope I would have had
[1:37:10] enough grace to turn the other side I
[1:37:12] was just gonna prove a point to them he
[1:37:14] wouldn't he wouldn't about to do that
[1:37:17] but you see Christ in you is the hope of
[1:37:22] glory what was in God's mind is now in
[1:37:27] reality in the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:31] brought by prophet heaven help us if we
[1:37:36] think you're a mile before day what
[1:37:38] about Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10
[1:37:41] 7
[1:37:41] what about like I've always tried to
[1:37:43] explain what about brother Branham no
[1:37:45] wonder the man said you've been given
[1:37:47] more than the prophets well because he
[1:37:50] was an Old Testament prophet and now
[1:37:52] don't get me with that doctor and it's
[1:37:53] over here
[1:37:54] he he took the word and put it together
[1:37:57] all the way through
[1:37:59] but then he was a New Testament prophet
[1:38:03] to take what Paul and him could take and
[1:38:06] bring it all the way through and he was
[1:38:07] a born-again believer for God to be able
[1:38:10] to speak - he was a whole lot more than
[1:38:12] just a prophet he's very close to
[1:38:14] Almighty God I said very close but he
[1:38:17] wouldn't die when he was a child of God

[1:42:07] before
[1:42:11] i apprec
[1:42:15] let me just set this away foreknowledge
[1:42:20] is back there predetermines out there
[1:42:29] but I'm right here now you tell me that
[1:42:38] was the Word of God a foreknowledge all
[1:42:40] agree we you tell me that that
[1:42:42] predetermined after the Word of God and
[1:42:44] I'll agree with you but why not agree
[1:42:49] that where we're at right here you see
[1:42:56] if if I don't have my salvation I've

[1:43:17] [Music]
[1:43:18] whatever it is say thank you lord
[1:43:23] why not believe in present tense so now
[1:43:30] you know yourself what the scripture
[1:43:32] said when you spoke to Moses he said I
[1:43:35] am that I am the Prophet said
[1:43:42] ever-present for eternity so that put
[1:43:46] him right dark or as motives that
[1:43:49] standing before the bush I am that I the
[1:43:56] present tense right now is more valuable
[1:43:59] than the future or the price to realize
[1:44:03] what you're doing now but think that
[1:44:06] before the world God saw this little
[1:44:09] time God saw this day before the work
[1:44:19] well I just got up and I come to church
[1:44:22] well that's good but what about being in
[1:44:25] the very presence we're in a time part
[1:44:30] of the very presence of Almighty God
[1:44:36] living right here that's why I'm happy
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:43] what did the Prophet say if I had a
[1:44:45] choice out of all the times and God said
[1:44:48] where you want me to live do he says
[1:44:50] right now right now here we are
[1:44:56] why not enjoy the day that we have a new
[1:44:59] choice in it
[1:45:00] Lord Jesus be with us as we go separate
[1:45:04] and eat our meals Lord and come back
[1:45:05] this afternoon your way to minister the
[1:45:07] word of the Lord we ask you to forgive
