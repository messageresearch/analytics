that thou shalt be established everyone that is proud in heart is that abomination to the Lord through a hand John in hand he shall not be unpunished when a man weighs please the Lord you make it theme that his enemy to be at peace with him a man's heart devises his way the Lord direct his steps a just weight and balance are the laws all the weight of the bag showed he'll work out his works righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right in the light of the King countenance his life and his favour is a cloud of latter rain the highway of the upright is to

good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures learn where we've been reading in Ephesians 2 in 1st Thessalonians 1 I don't know whether they've hooked up in the basement to get started or not but we were expecting a company but okay we'll just go on and they can do in the basement those little that'll be the best part they meant sister Monica's class says plus his act black it's supposed to be meeting in the sanctuary at 12:42 practice or song so remember that you know inordinately in Ephesians 2 in 1st Thessalonians 5 now if the Lord willing this coming Sunday wait and I will be going up into Illinois to put up deer stands and do some things on Monday Tuesday not on the sunday but we're going up and going to visit with a brother up in that area on Sunday and white would be ministering probably there but then we'll be back maybe Tuesday Wednesday aren't ever what it takes to try to get done but what we're going to do is we're going to make the announcements then I've told them if they have to change because of some company coming in that needs an interpretation but as far as laying out right now next Sunday morning brother Louise will be taking the morning service but Aaron will be taking the afternoon service and brother Bob black will take the Wednesday following which is the 29th so that will be the announcements as now something goes wrong with thee because they're supposed to bend some people come they would need interpretation so if it is with you attach that up and you know do whatever whatever we need to do well they need to do they can take care of it while we're going okay all right father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for the day thank you for loving us Lord and do we do this we just ask you to guide us now as we attempt to speak a little bit about you because that's the main thing that we need we need hearing to come and we believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord so we pray that you would bless each one and open our eyes and understanding and that our hearts be set on you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you we love you in Jesus name any other yeah Father's Day sign up now to all of the brothers would want to go in up and we'll have a couple of days of relaxation for all of the father's visions too we've been reading so we're just going down to verse eight to save time and pick that up then we'll go over to first Thessalonians says for by grace are you saved through faith that remember back in verse five you know you told me by grace you're saved now he says by grace through faith which is a journey it's traveling this week you know and that we're by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God okay now let's pick up 1st Thessalonians 5:23 this isn't the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been attempting for a while to minister about salvation talking about salvation and we're - we chose that as a point because so many things can be covered in using the word salvation more than to talk about redemption or different things but now remember what we've been driving at if you're saved by grace through faith it's a journey it's the trowel it's just like life you born into the world you come into the world and you you you you know you live but you're taking a journey through life well your Christian journey is the same way it starts here in our world of life and you know and then continues on until we leave from this world all right and as we finish that part up of leaving from this world you know all the way through until we either die go by the grave whatever or come to a change in a moment a twinkling of an eye whatever the existence we will one day change from this way of living our more thoughts and will be brought in to a glorified condition in what you call heaven whatever you want to call it and do another point but then it would come to of an existence greater than this one all right so then we don't expect I'm one firm believer in the future we don't expect things to just play around and we go up to heaven and and we sat down and we play harps and and stuff like that you know and do now we're going to be human beings and we're going to be a living according to the Book of Revelations right here in this world on this earth that's been totally renewed not destroyed but to be renewed or changed and will go into an existence of that and we'll get a message of cheer down to the endless ages coach I've taught you from the beginning this is what I believe I believe that the time we have here on earth in our Christian journey as we're talking about is only a preparation for the future to come all right see the heaven help I love being a Christian and I like believing and I enjoy living I have a good time at it and all but I sure do hope this is not all of it you know I mean that's that's the best I can say if this is all of it then you know I don't know so I want to you know I want to believe in a future as the old Indian called it - happy hunting grounds and this one we call it this and that we called it that but it's a future time to be living after this existence here but this is the preparation right this is the life the preparation we spend our life preparing for the future right you go to school you go to college you go to this you go to do a job you learn this you do that and you're preparing for the future we'll see one day the future will take place and when it does then we'll see that what we've been here is it's just a foundation it's just getting us ready to where we can and understand so there'd be a message of cheer to be down through the endless ages as time runs out of here alright now we've covered in our life's messages talking about as I said we've been dealing with for salvation all right we'll keep that title for a while to deal with salvation because it will cover any avenue that we need to cover but what have we been talking about what is the new birth all right now Jesus in speaking we'll get to it another message later but speaking to Nicodemus he said you must be born again when Nicodemus couldn't understand that terminology now he was the greatest learned scholar of all the times you know and Jesus spoke of him and honored him for that the teacher of Israel and didn't understand what he was a saying but he was saying you must be born again Nicodemus said you mean I got to go to my mother's womb I got to be born again he said now that's not what I'm talking about said in other words the original translations literally says you must be born from above they so Jesus was saying you got to be born from where I come from but said you don't understand this earthly things you know said because the earthly things that are happening are an example to you and you don't understand that how can it be that you'll understand heavenly matters that I would speak up all right but he said you must be born again or what is the born-again experience what is the new birth as we talked about well I cried I shouted we come to the altar we've done this we've done that all that's well and good but that's an outward manifestation of an inward work or it's worth nothing unto you all right see because we we've got to be born from above like he was born all right then you know we'll get to that in a minute and cover some parts of it but what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally reveal to you what I never never heard of the new birth of our born-again experience being a revelation well that's where I think we need to grow up and start learning a little bit from you know the Word of God and start understanding above our little sugar tier thoughts that we have you know well I cried I prayed I asked to save me that's well and good but did he save you I accepted him as my savior and I believe that's all I need to do well the Bible says being born again it's a process that's taking place and like I've tried to say to you that it took the disciples 3 and 1/2 years for the Lord Jesus to bring his message to them that they would qualify for going to the Upper Room and the reason I use the word qualify because the Bible said that Jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection but only 120 made the upper room some reason or thought they didn't qualify so they didn't get to go there all right but those that did qualify and had three and a half years of teaching of the word of God and see we think all you got to do just walk down the altar and say I accept Jesus Christ as my savior well that's the starting right direction that ain't the whole journey that's what I'm trying to get you to see when you was born into the world what do you two do well well I was just born into the world no you got to eat you got to live you got to prepare you got to do to grow right and so is it in your Christian journey and that's what Nicodemus they couldn't understand Jesus explaining taking the natural life that he was looking at he said you must be born of water and spirit and applying that to him to try to get him to understand what it meant but see those people back there they believed in God they done all they could do those disciples for three and a half years were great believers but they they had to go to Pentecost to receive the new birth alright and see then what do we do what I've just accepted Jesus Christ is my Savior what else can I do what is God done and we use the terminologies and we say well you know abraham believed god what else can we do other anymore than what Abraham did was right but God done some day Brian abraham believed God the Bible said and it was imputed unto him imparted translated down to him our move brought to his room of a point that Abraham the believing is what brought God on the scene right he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness all right and then believing it then it brought God on the scene but what did God do God gave Abraham circumcision there's a sign of the new birth a sign of the change of life or to making us Christians and he gave that to Abraham so what is God done for you and I well I'll tell you order I don't understand the way that you folks talk you know because I've always just thought with this just one of them shook the preachers hand or cried or or said some Creed or some doctrine or some idea you know and where's it saved well where'd you get that from you didn't get it out of the Bible in the Bible they had an experience doesn't matter whether it was 120 in the upper room the 3000 outside later on that day no matter how many or whatever or how long it took they had to have an experience a sensation you don't have to have sensations are stimulations upon your flesh you know beings coming out but the experience is something you live through you've lived through I'm 79 years I've lived through that part alright see because it's been a journey to me alright see then what is the new birth yeah it's the birth of the word that you've heard what was the new birth to the disciples come on what was the new birth to the disciple like I said there were three and a half years and then Jesus teaching them that didn't give him eternal life right they had to go to the Upper Room to receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and he had to die to release that life to where they could come back upon them to give them eternal life so it's a lot more than just saying well you know I believe God I accepted God I'm a Christian that's what's wrong with the world today then you see them just go right see people just go right back I don't throw those stones I just try to tell truth when was the Baptist Church we had this one man we'd go to him and talk to him when they were having a revival and he'd come to the altar and he'd cry and pray and he'd get up and he'd say I'm saved now I'm saved well he never made it to the next night no I'm not telling no joking or lie I'm telling it like it is he never made it to the second night all right so then finally they come another revival time and they go to the we would we go to him and talk to him about accepting it he'd come to the altar he'd cry he'd pray he'd get up he'd say I got it now but he never did get it as far as I was concerned I heard later he did become a Christian well I I hope so but I'm just saying what I knew or know about the story every year he would make the same commitment or ever revival how about you and I come on what have we taught our children well all you got to do is just go to church and be good well Alcoholics Anonymous has got you beat don't mean that is a joke I'll tell us the truth they do go to the meetings and and and hang with it all the time and at least dedicate themselves to that Missy will accept it and it works for a little while Sigma and all the once it just seems to fall away and then you see people just dropping off dropping off leaving and they'll come back again one day when they get contacted again well I didn't know that was to be the Christian life I thought the Christian life was to be Christ to come and live in you and no matter what would come and go from that day on you walked in Christ and believed him and followed him and tried to live the life and tried to walk right and do rock I thought that was the Christian life see we've got to deal with something greater than and that's what I've been trying to do is is to speak to you about the new birth the new birth we've read it from the Prophet over and over when the Christ the mystery of God revealed what is the new birth he said he said it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you shouted not you cried not you spoke in tongues not you've done all of those things that's the aftereffect the baby cries after the baby gets here that's the after-effects are proof that it's alive if something has taken place to the little feller and they cry out all right because that's part of the experience okay but now think about it how many churches teach there under struffoli asking you the question you go to the baptist they have their way and you say you must be born again and and they'll tell you what you need to do you need to accept this you need to do that you need to come to church you need to do that you need to be good you go over to the Methodists they're gonna tell you this and they're gonna take it out you go to the Catholics they're gonna tell you this you go to this when you're gonna tell you this I'm gonna tell you that but where is the new birth involved in it why is it not that Nicodemus it's hard to stay away from that message kind of got my thoughts laid out for but you don't you think that Nicodemus knew all about living a good life don't you think Nicodemus lived a good natural life the position he was in really demanded a life be left are they would remove him from it one way or the other he didn't get by with sin because he was the high priest he was held responsible more than anyone else as being a high priest or a great leader in in Israel because he he was expected to be something well don't you think Nicodemus could tell all about that why was it he didn't understand Jesus who all it is is we just cries out well if I saw we're gonna do what did intimidate Messiah what did Nicodemus just say what I cried nicely I didn't had a good don't you think he did don't you think he served God to the best of them of could be why didn't he just say wooden tit that's what it is this is I've done all these things now Lord Jesus so so I'm saved no I like people I don't mean it's wrong meaning the right way I like intelligent people and that not necessarily how much education you got under so many intelligence I like to talk to intelligence people not college degrees that ain't nothing that's not intelligence to me intelligence to me is how flying common-sense that's intelligence is you just got plain common straight since that's the best intelligent anybody could use all right and you think Nicodemus wasn't that formula night well yet when the Lord Jesus said you must be born again he says I don't understand you if you telling me that I need to shout I need to cry I need to go to church I need to live good enough I've done that all my life come on right put yourself in this situation with Nicodemus don't you think that he had a good Oh he bragged on the Lord Jesus he told him he said no man can do the things you're doing unless God be with him and then Jesus turned back and gave him the greatest report he said you are the teacher he was the greatest of all the teachers and he couldn't understand if it was crying if it was shouting if it was speaking in Talk it was if it was some emotional situation any form whatsoever why would Nicodemus not be able to say I've got that you remember the rich young ruler when the him that said for I've kept these things for my youth you know he said what mustard only 19 I said I've kept these things for my youth but yet he didn't accept Jesus Christ as their Savior but yet he lived all that life do you understand the point that's a message I'll review it when we get to it but think about it when Jesus said you must be born of water and a spirit now that water there is just not you gets your baptism that's part of it go on repent every one of you about what must we do to be safe repented one hard that's part of it now but that's not all the story that's not that water these home out there I'll show you where the Prophet said it that's washing of the water by the word it's not just water baptism and Holy Ghost baptism that puts you in the kingdom it's washed by the water of the word we'll cover that on sanctification when we get down to talking those you see I'm talking basically there's a few people here that come through Pentecost and they know their basic doctrine was to be justified sanctified and how the baptism of the Holy Ghost which rest of us or Baptist Methodist Presbyterian whatever you know and we never had none of that all we have just go to church be good shake hands with the preacher you know pay you tithe make sure everything's running good you know have a good family do all this and you're saved make sure you play the part you know we had an old say in the Baptist well you know that feller made it because he paved the parking lot well in other words our point was he was a good guy because he showed what he was doing he done a lot of good things and that was alright but we had one it was kind of little on the others flaky side of the story and he painted the church will everybody put him in heaven when he died well I ain't got none to do with me I don't care what got done with him that's his business I'm just making a point all right but listen do you realize that we have examples in the Bible that we need to go by and look at you know that Mary made a confession in her life that she was virgin born right she told everybody you know she's virgin born in other words not she be Birds anymore the babies that she had was virgin bowling or not you with me they finally even the Catholics made her virginal that's all right that's nothing to me but the point is you know that she actually denied the Lord Jesus she denied the virgin birth she denied the fact that Jesus was virgin born you remember the story when they were there and they they had been there for about three days and then went back and he wouldn't among them and he's they got to hunting for Jesus and they found out he went back and they found him talking to the scribes and Pharisees and things and the big rulers and all you know and when they did then here comes Mary up and she had given her confession all of her life code at that town these 13 14 years old and her confession had been that she was a virgin and that had a child and fulfilling the scripture within right there in front of everybody she said your father and I taught you diligently acclaiming what that Joseph was the father of Jesus she denied the virgin birth right she denied him being virgin born and by denying all of that it would have put her right in a bad position because that would have made her a prostitute okay but what did Jesus say he said I must be about my father's business but she did not die virgin birth you know what the Prophet says on the sea not air with her shut the Pentecostals denied the birth of the word your denominational Church systems has denied the birth of the word in other words that have word with virgin born they claim him to be one of the three you know the Trinity doctrine came out and they declared him to be one of the three denying him to be Almighty God what about me and you come on you remember what we were talking about on the last message a little bit according to the book of Revelation there's three unclean spirits like frogs comes out in the last days the Prophet said after the opening of the seals it comes out which would mean after he preached the seals come out a new Trinity what is that new Trinity your ideas and my ideas contrary to the word cuz what's the old Trinity come straight from Rome not in the Word of God has no Basics in the word there's no Basics in the word for a Trinity a trial and being YESCO that's what God is but not a Trinity not three persons see we told that you know God in three persons Blessed Trinity where's that in the Bible it's not dark see so we're denying the virgin birth we're denying the fact that Jesus Christ is Almighty God oh I didn't know was that bad you know what we've been taught actually destroys the fact of understanding that Jesus was God when he said I and my father are one he said unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins he declared himself to be Almighty God in human flesh the Bible plainly holds that up all the way through right let's see what are we doing we're denying the word do you say well I think he's a Trinity I think I think there's really three guards well then you're denying the word the same thing Mary done that's what your prophet is illustrating Mary denied the birth of Jesus Christ as to be in virgin and made him the son of Joseph what do we make him if the new birth is what the Prophet said it was and the Bible says it is Jesus said it would he said you must be born again you must be born from above you must be must have a new birth called your natural birth is not good enough was that simply what he was explaining that's what the Lord Jesus was explaining to Nicodemus Nicodemus said all these things I kept all of my life I shouted I cried I've spoken to you understand what I'm making the illustration I'm making the illustration the way we talk it wouldn't back there of they cried shouts well I'm staying it today what we're doing we're denying the fact that Almighty God dwell in human flesh in the man called Jesus Christ but yet claiming him as our Savior right but how do we declare him well how did you get born again well I shouted I cried out spoken up I felt good I had a shout and good time on glory hallelujah I've done all coming now whether you call what I was doing or not that wouldn't work with Nicodemus go Nicodemus had ever better this ducks in the road right plain old language he was a straight up and down guy yet everything in perfect order to fit what Jesus was saying about the new birth but because of his terminologies he couldn't understand him do we understand him how can you have salvation without the blood of Jesus Christ oh I believe what Judas believed and according to the Bible just one oh brother used to say the last time I read it still there according to the Bible the devil's believed in one God and they tremble about it that's according to the Bible now what does that make them saved see what is your new birth that's that's all I've been trying to drive that for a week after week what is your new birth what do you count your point of salvation that's being well I really don't know brother then I just always been a good person went to church and try to do what was right praise God Alcoholics Anonymous like to have you there's a good neighbor that don't make you a Christian come on I keep laying it down don't you think Nicodemus had it and he had everything in line he was a great guy yet everything in perfect order yet he couldn't answer the simplicity of when Jesus said you must be born again the rich young ruler said all of these things I've kept from my youth what Jesus say you like one thing go sell what you got and give to the poor the Bible said he went away sorrowful why because he let his riches get between him and God what about it what is the new birth could we be denying the fact of Jesus being Almighty God no no I believe it president I've always believed Jesus was God well why did you have him as a second person running around or the third or whatever you had him well that's all I know well that's good but what about the truth see what is the new birth if it's none of those signs and one of the things that you deal with you know emotions or sensations or speaking in tongues or crying upfront then what is it the I stand here today to say to you and declare just like the Lord Jesus said you must be born again you must have come about me you all of us must have the new birth if not we're lost yet I can sit and read I can stand here and read faces I don't have to read inside he's telling me I'm lost if you're not born again you are what's the point I ain't arguing with nobody come on if I'm not born again I'm lost what about you I believe the Prophet does that make you something different Nicodemus would tell you he believed all of the prophets right we claim to believe one prophet he claimed we believe every one of them come on church I wish you'd get down one of these days to just thank him sensible we read the Bible and we think more we've got it I've taught you over and over you realize we read the account of Nicodemus and the Lord Jesus takes you two or three minutes to read it we think he gathered helper in a room with him somewhere in about three minutes later he's walking out the door come on that situation could have taken hours for them to sit and discuss my Bible don't say that with common sense you think Nicodemus put his life on the line you think the Lord Jesus met him and said those few words to him and Nicodemus gets up walks out the door something's wrong with your mentor there are there's that common sense part something's wrong with your common sense maybe you're smart but you don't have no common sense they could have been talking for hours about the Scriptures well because it would start out in a good situation Nicodemus making the confession that no man can do the things you do unless God be with him Nicodemus saying you know that about Jesus Jesus saying about Nicodemus he said you are the teacher the greatest of all the teachers of that day stood there with the God of glory and you think they spent about 5 minutes talking over a little situation and got up walk out the door I'm just playing I'm sorry that shows me you don't know how a plain common sense you had plain common sense you'd sit down thank it over what would what would be your argument for them to take hours discussing the Bible pretty good situation we sat on wooden pretty good opportunity for them to be able to discuss the Scriptures but my main point is one thing Nicodemus life and things he had everything in order but he couldn't understand you must be point again all of his life he'd been taught go to church pay your tithe live a good life do all of what God said I do or don't do what he said don't do right and he would sit down saying these things I've done pretty good man wouldn't he you understand he's pretty good man that rich younger older was a good guy he had kept all the commandments yet that didn't make him born-again he said well if he did just went and sold everything give it that have been written off it went sold everything he still had to went to the upper room they come on don't don't go that way with me if he went and sold everything give everything away he would have still had to went to the upper room to receive the new birth because that was their only possibility of receiving eternal life the only possibility and the Bible terminologies are speaking was an upper room experience that they had to be born again what about it could we be like Mary could we be denying the Lord Jesus to be who he says he is maybe that's why we don't have the new birth well I see I don't I know you you're I'm not that smart but I got a little decent common sense I think I've been argued about that a lot that's all right I think we taught don't try to sit down and think about things we must be born again well you got to shout and cry grandma done it and and she's saved here's one that's flat back in your face you know just cause you've done them things don't mean you're going to have them you say in Grand mine in heaven see that close to home story that he ended it between Nicodemus and Lord Jesus if that's where they got anything out the door you said my grandma was lost cause I was there when she shouted will praise God grandma's gonna face god herself because this is one thing I firmly believe ever born-again believer has to have their own personal experience with God now that's as plain as I can believe about anything it's not because mom and daddy were Christians that was a help to bring them to church put him in the right atmosphere and that everything but it didn't save nobody come on I'm this plane this can be even with the way that I'm talking the way that I do and I'm sorry I had a good family that kept me in church I didn't save me and the fact that was the biggest hindrance I had was the church of the day I've told you about it and they're not throwing awful nobody I knew and I told them they'd come talk to me about getting saved one day I said look I said I live a better life than your Deacon board lives and but they didn't want me to explain it they never asked me who or what not they got up and left I said because I live a better life than your Deacon board lives and then you're talking to me if I need to be saved you need to be there talking to them right because I was just honest and sincere that's why I was 18 years old before I was ever converted in any form in a Baptist Church or anything because I was above the point of just accepting this or that or the other you know what all you got to do is just be saved and just oh well you know God understands hell is gonna be full of people that know God understood don't you think that Mary thought she understood she said your father and I Jesus said I must be about my father's business he straightened her out right there in front of everybody now I'm serious and honest I don't even believe Mary had that problem any moment I'm seriously not I think that ended Mary's statement it was only the one time that she flopped wrong no because once she heard that she knew who she was talking to because she knew that was a virgin born son of the Living God she had birth names shorter noted right but brother Dale huh you know and that's what I told you don't misunderstand me there's 120 in the upper room took him three and a half years but the first thing downstairs I don't took him a few minutes I've never taught nothing like anybody would say that you know that you've got to go through a long experience of getting born again no it's according to what you can believe what you can understand there was people that receive the Holy Ghost just from hearing the word but I can quote to where the Prophet said very few will believe all the way to receive in the Hall to go you know why because they don't know come on I'm serious with you and many preachers you ever heard preach on the new birth and keep trying their best to read to you over and over and over and over knowing you're resenting it knowing you're you're not accepting it to be but knowing that the prophet of God told us what the new birth was and we're supposed to be believing him and that the new birth was what the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you those disciples for three and a half years had a great experience but when that Holy Ghost fell in the upper room they went up there is scared to death because they thought that is going to die right they had seen the Lord Jesus and seen what he went through and thought he would be the one to deliver but when they come down to the point they've seen all of that they say we ain't delivered yet they get to the upper room and like I've always said if it's all you got to do is just believe it words the other four are 380 that had seen him after his resurrection the Bible says that I don't that's not me the Bible said though he was seen of over 500 brethren the Bible calls them brethren I'm not saying they didn't go later and receive the new birth no but why did they turn away from him do you know what the new birth is see there we go well I've done this I don't know I didn't ask you that what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally do you come on you won't scripture you don't want an ax to it I believe it were that Peters describing the message going back to him you know in the coming back over after Pentecost and he said listen Peter what is your new birth well I was up here and there's this guy come down and these things happen and we shouted we cried we don't know it now he did to say nothing like that what did he say come on I thought was supposed to be Bible reading Christian didn't it say didn't Peter say this is that that was spoken of by the prophets there's another one of them things do you think that's all they say it this is that he might have spent 30 minutes explaining what this and that was he could go back to what is it Ezekiel he could have went and took a see kill and read it write to him you know what is equal 36 or is it 35 I want to Ezekiel work there's so much to get a new heart and you spirit see we had that all messed up new heart and you know I get feelings I get that he said did I not put my spirit in you but Iran said that new heart a new spirit was not the new birth that's what's your prophets here but I put my spirit in you he said darts the new birth see Peter could have been explaining all of those thing yet we think it's a five minute and it's new probably longer it's over with let see put your own experience in there some time and think about it think about your own experience in life where you come from and what led you to where you're at and what you're doing you're surely not just putting it on you shout at you away where you're at cuz I'll tell you you're wrong I'll tell you you cried you way to where you're out come on I won't argue with that one you didn't do or how to lose you all your life know that a lot of our life Christian life has been crying out on our knees trying to find out from God what to do and where was that wasn't going on I walk out of that Baptist Church I was a deacon and everything else 23 years old ordained a deacon in the Baptist Church and I walked out of there that day I walked out in the backyard no barbecue pit thing that might I got down on my knees and I cried out God now I know I can't go back but I've explained to you water baptism and how your bad this whole tour that you're gonna be baptized again if you go to a Baptist Church now you take my word for it listen lord it through it's finished I'm I'm done I can't go back I gotta go forward but word for word my mother but my brother that was my daddy figure because he was my oldest brother dad died when I was four and I didn't know didn't how no daddy died away but he said what you gonna do Sam he said you want a church where piell's you want listen I don't even know what I'm called to preach I don't know anything about I just know I can't stay here mama said where you going no we're gonna be an agent for a while I found the church but I said I don't know where I'm going I wouldn't glory hallelujah I was down and out go right now nowhere to go nothing to do they what none of them had me hey Church my family was one of the biggest ones in that church I could have pulled some strings with all of my brothers and sisters and took over that church but I knew I wasn't gonna do that nobody's gonna search for God until I found him and already hearing about the message reading sometimes six books in one day things like that I read this constantly brother calling to you I'd sit down there where he was working at and this had books Ireland just read and half the night sometime I already had that working but that wouldn't my new birth I'm gonna I've told you seen the angel of God when I was 11 years old standing in a church that would my new birth and tell you things that happened in my life but I never claimed none of him as my new birth the new birth that I have was the birth of the word when the word come unfolded to me and it's been a fun folding ever since I'll take that as my experience of the new birth what is yours you say yeah but how do I teach my children to teach your children exactly what we're gonna go through you're gonna go through justification you don't repent of your sins that's God to forgive you then you're gonna go to sanctification and how to cleanse and set aside and do then we're gonna go to the baptism the old ago we've got a long ways to go kids hang on but you've been with me long enough to know that I've always just been one time always my love and times is for these children to try to get them to God because I know what the new birth is people that say well well that wasn't what happened to me when I got born again well I'm not - got it wrote the book but if my life patterns the book better and your life patterns the book then I'm I'd be worried about it if I was you right well all I've done is cried no you can't tell me I ain't safe that's where you're at you're doing the same thing you don't understand you're doing the same thing that meri denied Jesus being the virgin birth you're denying him being Almighty God he had a natural birth into the world right and when Nicodemus said how can I do these like he said if I can't get you to see natural things you won't be seeing no spiritual time he said you're going to be born from where I come from are the originals I said look it up it says to be born from above in other words born from where he's born from well he had a birth I thought our new birth was our that part there that Christ is coming to live inside of us I thought that was the deal burger I didn't know it was shouting and crying even I thought it was a person come on church if you don't understand what I'm talking about I believe that new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ which is the person of Almighty God that's come to live in you and me go to spoken words reading those seed read a little bit on that one but brother Branham said for the birth of the word is Christ not of polluted with denominations the early church no denominations just the word and spirit irrigated whether God laid the word down like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated it and Darcy went she brought four children you understand what he's saying God laid the word into them disciples for three and a half years on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost come to in and irrigate that as he's saying or in other words to make the word alive under their Pentecost the word was made alive into their hearts they knew that was Jesus then they died no argument that a revelation of who it was have we ever had that experience let us rather don't understand it go you you seem like you make a you seem like you make the new birth some kind of revelation what are you gonna make it at least minor fit the Bible come on brain what you got I'll be in office come brain won't you God at least I could put what I'm talking about in the Bible because that's where I got it from from the prophets message which is the Bible brought down to us in sermons and messages don't make the manly thing this mixing what God promised to be a messenger but what about it christ being revealed to you well what's our purpose for church than going to church and the preacher and the gathering and doing why don't we just eat drink and be merry and go home and just have a good time and forget the whole time I thought we were supposed to be desiring revelation more than anything right I thought we were to desire revelation more than anything else because the Bible says upon this rock I'll build my church Lord Jesus cetera and the gates of hell can't prevail against it well I priests opened up to the internet and I thought man Oh Lord we're gonna get tore up they're gonna be after us ain't doing it why because if I can read to you what the Prophet said don't you call me on no internet systems and try to tell me how wrong I am I'm gonna tell you that you show me where the Prophet says you show me where the Bible says it and we went all of these years without having any contact from people oh yeah they don't believe it because you know what they don't understand it now I'm gonna say this I'm acquitted only if you don't have the new birth you don't know what I'm talking about youuuu just gettin too strong why why if I don't have the new birth do I have any trouble with whether the words right or not now I'm gonna deny every bit of it marry deny the virgin birth I thought am I wrong in quoting that little random said the bride was to be delivered of a new birth from according to were Malachi 4 I thought that's what he said the bride was to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 now Malachi 4 is behold I send you elijah the prophet well you know what he brought is wonderful but he expects the bride to make the word alive that's all I've ever said this bride is to make alive what that prophet brought it's not a humdrum sitting around going to church being good because you know what you do now argue with me you know what you'll do you'll go to church for a while and you'll be doing good and then all at once you'll just float away you backslide then you slide by hacking and then use backslide and president don't like that is it true is it true well I'm just guilty of exposing it in me and you both come on these issues what is the new birth it's the revelation because listen Church I've taught you from day one that after coming in this mess and I've seen it the new birth starts with you believing and ends when you leave the world right starts when yous beginning when you believe it then it ends when you leave the world and we just quoted a quote to start with that a message of cheer will be down through the endless ages after this world oh well so we just getting started let's don't deny the word do you believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see if not then we're denying the work now come on gonna slap it down and yeah we're now brother down I believe that 4050 years ago when the Prophet was here oh you don't believe it now then so when did he stop being Hebrews 13:8 simple question let's see what do you agree with the word or denied I've talked from day one in this message that Jesus Christ is the same that he's ever been and I've seen him deliver with it if you think he's alright because did not know the new birth is a birth of the word did the prophets say it when we were that quote and want to go God laid the word down and the Holy Ghost quicken that word there is a new birth that's our new birth today as well as it was then if we're brother Dale I've never done I've never had a revelation it's something wrongly then something wrongly what about it a standing it flow through me [Music] [Music] me Holy Spirit what about [Music] do you have the numero are you seeking it well see if you don't know you need it you'll never say it but at least if you know you need it you say kids you can pray for it [Music] Oh [Music] as you experience grown since you accept in Jesus Christ or until the same thing [Music] oh let's don't deny the word and think that we're standing for it if he's the same yesterday today and forever then there supposed to be a bride they would say Amen she's all over the world as he's being born again [Music] what about flow through me Oh singing up to him is like a fire me [Music] as I live by hand to worship [Music] father we thank you for today and we just ask you Lord to go with us neither natural me will come back and you're waiting this afternoon we pray that Lord [Music] that we would stop denying you and start receiving you in confessing you would the main thing Lord I see right now is wrong with all of us we're not saying all this well for us we're in our pity parties and up and down and trying to do everything you know we're just old we were getting older we're getting up this is all war we've done that what does that got to do with it [Music] we just commit it all to you we believe you in Jesus is your name you dismiss me a flow through me holy spirit flow through me if my as doers and to me magnified thy name for me [Music]
