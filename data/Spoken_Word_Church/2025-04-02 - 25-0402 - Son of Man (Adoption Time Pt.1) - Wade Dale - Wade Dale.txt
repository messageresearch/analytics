open heart oh let the word of God imp amen word of God ever true changing me and changing you that's what we need amen we're heading toward a real change though we're heading toward a change of the body and we sure appreciate the Lord and they're predestinated to that too so we want to be predestinated as we're going to talk about and I I appreciate them playing that adoption because that's what we're going to move into we're going to we're going to not get off of the transition to Perfection but I think we've come to the part to now we need to learn how to be perfect and to learn how to be perfect we must come to adoption first all right we must come to adoption first and this is going to be just a an overview and then Sunday we'll get into our to to the meat of it but adoption is again as we said it's a requirement these virtues are a requirement for this end time for us to come to full adoption to where our name is as good in the checkbook as the father's and then all of a sudden there's a transformation that we get to sign it we get to give it all right so we'll get to that though in just a little bit just remember this is coming up baby baptism uh little Emerson's going to be bapt I mean going to be baptized well I was in a Methodist Church last Sunday okay I'm trying to get over all that I hope none of's watching but I'm telling you folks praise God we know what we know I mean praise God we know what we know when brother bham said they were lodges now that's what they are it's just a meeting place that's it brother Donnie and sister Susan were there and and sister Regina they didn't eat donuts everybody else in the sanctuary did but they didn't eat donuts U they didn't recite the Apostles Creed I hope asked Mom if she did she said no but we stood and and we uh uh I just pray for them cuz they just don't know that's all they know recite the Apostles Creed recite the doxology like Aaron said you know it's it's a method I mean John Wesley that's why they're called Methodist but buddy they had a method and that was what they stuck to and uh until I got in a pull pit but anyway we didn't say anything that hurt anybody and and they enjoyed it they they nodded a little loud every once in a while but um we're going to have a baby dedication they were all behind y'all y'all didn't see them and then we'll have a baptism um uh also we're going to have communion in foot washing the next Sunday all right is everybody with me the communion foot washing will be on the 13th I think that's what it is but it'll be the next Sunday all right because what we we're going we'll have visitors here um Anna's family will be here we'll have some visitors for the for the uh dedication and baptism so um we'll just hold off and have communion and foot washing on the thir all right also um sister Jun we're going to have a birthday party for her that a same afternoon right after the baptismal service we will have cake and ice cream downstairs her birthday is the 10th but um this is the closest one to get it to get it close enough next Sunday is going to be a little a little busy too so remember that uh next Wednesday brother Daniel Martinez will be here speaking for us that's Rachel's um and R Mom and Dad's going to be here so brother Daniel will be here Wednesday speaking for us now it looks like again that there's going to be rain on Sunday uh thunderstorms and all that again uh so if anybody can on that sign up sheet or anybody wants to uh I just called the instructor he hadn't called me back but I'll let you know by the way of WhatsApp is on that Saturday at 4:00 at my house we will begin to do like as we did last Sunday or Sunday before last some of you came down and we'll see if Mike can come then we'll start the class then at 4:00 at my house and we'll have uh get something to eat and all that but that'll be on Saturday not Sunday Sunday is going to be raining I I hate that but but um it just happens that way so just remember that um remember if you're going to brother Andre's you need to sign up downstairs for those of you that have not been before uh there's a um a sheet that Joe brother Joe's doing that we'll hand up hand out Sunday of the itinerary what we're going to do we're going to have Friday Fellowship we're going to have Saturday fellowship and and eating and then we're going to have a a youth service at 6 o00 and then Sunday morning and then we'll all go to the farmer's daughter and eat uh that Sunday after church so but I'll get you the itinerary if you don't already have a room I have 14 rooms reserved at quality in and comfort in already all right so if you want one let me know some of them are Kings siiz some of them are doubles so just let me know if you want one or if you want to find your own place like an Airbnb or something um I think Anna and then you did that last year didn't you Anna sister Anna marona and them well they stayed in a nice one and we stayed in a nice one and uh but we're going to stay in the motel with you guys this year so uh let's just remember also remember that church in prayer sure enough that Methodist Church they're looking for a pastor they're they're sheep without Shepherd and they're really looking for somebody and um we sure would love to have the building they had cuz it holds about 250 people and ain't that right so yeah the the the the stage was twice this size at least maybe more you couldn't hey yeah you couldn't lean over and go see you'd have to send a text to the person over on this end to change the uh to change the cord because you'd be so far away from each other but just pray for them uh they went through a fire years ago and the reason where I think I told you but I'll tell you again um a witch went in and burnt the building down burnt the church down the original Church in about 1998 or 99 somewhere in there 2000 well there's a a girl named Rita Bush which went to was teaching school with Anna and they got together and they had a need and their need was Sunday School tables and chairs so we bought them all Sunday school tables and chairs for the young ones and put them downstairs Unfortunately they got seven or eight rooms down there now and they don't even have a Sunday school class so but they're sitting down there uh to be used when if the church gets any bigger so um you love the Lord God thank you for praying for us we appreciate you being um cordial with Brother David he's a good brother I love Brother David he just won't ever hurt you and he'll always inspire you and he's a he's a really good brother and we really appreciate y'all taking care of him so if you got your Bible let's turn to Hebrews 5 verse 8 just remember these things these announcements Sunday will be a little bit busy that'll be all right let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord thank you for knowing that there'd be a group in the end time as we were reading quote back there from brother brandham that he knew that we would want it so he had it here for us Lord you knew we would want this we would want this more than life itself Lord we don't take it softly and lightly Lord we take it with reverence that you'll meet us in this house Lord if we'll do the things we're supposed to do and father that you'll meet us in our house even in our homes and our jobs Lord that we don't have to come to a building just to hear from you father because it's a personal relationship with you father be with us now as we read the scripture bless the hearers Lord be with the speaker father and you speak the words tonight that the people need to hear forgive Lord the ones that are sin sick father be with the ones that are that are sick at home and can't come Lord I pray that you'd be with them Father and bless them ever be with us now in Jesus name amen so we're going to switch a little gears but we got to talk about adoption because if the third poll is pertaining to adoption then we've got to cover adoption uh brother Dale's covered it many times but we got a lot of new people here um so we're going to cover it again we won't cover it much tonight we're just going to set a basis for it so let's read Hebrews 5 verse 8 though he were a son now this is Jesus Christ though he were a son yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered look and being made perfect now remember Jesus Christ in Soul and Spirit was perfect but his body was not perfect yet okay all right so when we come to to wit the Redemption of the body what we're talking about as we get a little bit later on that is coming to the Perfection that our body will even be perfect while we're standing on this imperfect Earth everybody with me and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all of them that obey him second Timothy 2:8 and you can be seated remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wow what about that wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him but if we deny him he also will deny us all right if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself he can't change he can't he can't have a different thought he can't say oops I need to back up he knows what he's talking about we've just got to do what as I was telling him there we just got to plug into the outlet the electricity is there the eternal life is there you just got to plug into it you may be seing the Lord that his Blessing to the reading the word now if we suffer we shall also Reign so brother B tells us and we've done we've read this many many times he talks about power without character or power with character if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together we're going to get into Romans 8 this Sunday for I reog not that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy now look at Paul not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us us as Christians we got to see the Long Haul because remember remember those who endure to the end will be saved those who endure to the end will be saved not the ones that stop off not the ones that get sidetracked the ones that endure to the end will be saved that's thus sayith the Lord unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him now look if Jesus Christ had to suffer so are we going to suffer you say I don't like that well you know what probably didn't like it either he actually said in the garden if you can take this away from me I surely don't want to do this but nevertheless thy will be done why he had a victory the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering you say man I can't now listen you got to go back to the part to where Jesus said or or God said I'll never put no more on you than you can stand you just don't know how much you can stand till you go through a trial when you go through a trial when you come out on the very on the other end of it if if a Christian comes out at the end of it as we've said many times before it doesn't ruin you it'll never ruin a Christian it will make you stronger it will make you know why you're in the will of God it'll make you know why you went through that you'll know personally they won't nobody else know it but you you'll know when you go through a trial everybody's praying for you everybody's with you everybody's there with you to be whatever we need to be but you're alone by yourself more than anybody else so character is a victory not a gift so God's not handing out character you got to earn it character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and now what are we ruling we're ruling this and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same now watch on the same basis that he overcome and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be what revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation the trials of our faith being much more precious than gold that's what God wants us to do but when we come to a place where God is pleased with all that he's going to put a seal on us he's going to adopt us because remember I and I'll I'll I'll have the quote Sunday but I didn't bring it here but brother Brown says look your new birth is not your adoption your new birth is bringing you into the family of God you were born a son born again a son all right everybody with me born again a son you born a son of your par the first time now you born a Son of God from the Son of God this time by the new birth but you can have the new birth and not be adopted but you can't get adopted without having the new birth that's why the new birth is the most important thing because it will it will help you to get to the next step but if you don't have it you don't know how because power without character what is that power that power is the holy ghost power power without that character you might do something wrong with it but God knows when you come to when brother bam came and we'll get to the steps of the adoption later on when he came to a place to where I believe and we'll see it here in a minute where God came to a place to where he sealed him and told him said told the world said if you're going to get it you're going to get it from this man right here cuz remember that's what brother Brown said that happened on Mount Transfiguration Jesus up there said behold you know the Son of God and whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him he said from now on you're going to hear what that guy says and I'm going to speak through that guy in other words God's going to speak through that guy so brother brandham when he comes off that mountain God has sealed him and told him placed him in a place of adoption where whatever he said was what was going to be God God was going to back up now he backed him up a long time ago and the things that he did you know the healings and all that but we're talking about getting the correct Doctrine right getting the correct scriptures right getting the right me right message right to bring the son of man on the scene because the son of man was perfect his words were perfect he didn't make a mistake he didn't have a different Doctrine it was the doctrine sure of the Apostles but remember we'll look at in just a few minutes The Headstone was rejected now what are you talking about when you talk about headstone Stone means what Revelation it's not a rock sitting somewhere but it's a allegory of building something and putting a headstone on top of it that is the head that hold it all together that's where everything comes up to a what a head so the head Revelation was Jesus Christ the head Revelation there's no other Revelation Satan's not your revealer angels are not the revealer of the word God is the only one that reveals the word now what does he do he speaks to people to get you to listen and turn and look cuz remember his message was a what a shout a trump hey the message is here God's telling us the message he told us where it's come he told us where it's coming through it's coming through a prophet in the end time had to be a prophet so Ephesians 1:3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he ha chosen us now look he chose us in him not of him because God chose he chooses Every Soul cuz he's the only one that can make one but he knows that people won't take it the people won't that they'll accept it or reject it and he did according to his for knowledge he knew you would or wouldn't he's just not going to pull you through a tube and make you be a Christian he don't do his business that way according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world where was that c Gene in him before the foundation of the world it just come to development down here when you got the new birth you got what he saw you was going to get before the foundation of the world to me that's so simple but we were alienated though you got to see that we were not born again when we were born the first time why would we have to have to be born again we don't have to be in darkness with these things a lot of these things are terminologies that we say but you were lost you were a sinner I know I was I don't know where people get that they were they were some some happy something that that God spoke to them since they were sucking bottles they might have y'all may be a bunch of goody two shoes but I'm sure I wasn't mom praise the Lord she said no um all your mothers would say the same thing so I ain't worried about it every one of you m was ago but we needed to be saved we needed salvation we were on this side of the chasm but what was on this side of the chasm listen what was on this side of the chasm is what got us took hold but it took hold down here but he saw it take hold down here therefore he could by for knowledge predetermine everything where like brother rown said he's not going to pull you through a tube or he's not going to make you do it so you do have a choice you've got to plug into the outlet now look according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Now watch how predetermined we are to come to a place that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and we'll read in just a few minutes brother R said his will was to adopt you his will was to make get you to a place to where he can leave the company to you and take a vacation everybody with me not looking back and going I hope he hope he writes the right check I hope he don't buy this I hope he don't destroy my company God's not that way he knows what's going to happen and he knows what move you'll make before you make it that's why we have to have character by suffering he watches us through all these trials and tribulations to see how we'll react he knows how we'll react you just don't know how you'll react so now the word adoption means to set put or place all right to set fix or establish to set forth to establish or ordain we have been ordained to adoption or we're receiving the spirit of adoption we'll get to it in Romans the spirit of adoption you're receiving you have the spirit that will get you listen You'll have the spirit in you that will get you to adoption at your new birth all right that's what the Bible's saying you will have the spirit that'll get you there if you've got the spirit he'll get you there but remember you are in between all that you can stop it you'll never stop the will of God but the will of God saw somebody make it and somebody not make it very simple all right what the Holy Ghost was given for we're in a day back there that wasn't half as smart as today think about that that's 1959 think of what he saw then and we're looking at now we're in a day now back there they wasn't half as smart as today they couldn't make an atomic bomb or an automobile they didn't have science and things we have now M things are mysterious things to try and say man blowed together by some dust and so forth take some analysis and try to prove it make in infidels out of people but now when we need it now watch when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit so what's he doing is in the end time this is the time of adoption all right Luther couldn't do it Weser couldn't do it the reformers couldn't do it it had to come through a prophet that's why a prophet had to come on the scene a prophet had to tell us and direct us because remember God's not going to say any tell anything to his children or people except It Be by a prophet that's in Amos what is Amos 2 and9 he'll do nothing he's got to reveal it to a prophet first and then he's going to give it to us all right but now when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he's pouring in his Spirit then those who are resting out you under the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture says crying how long Lord how long now watch did you catch something right there that's it's not who it's that scripture is talking about you see how brother B in 1959 was calling that the bride or Christians come on and we get to the fifth seal he said that ain't what I thought he said that's the souls under the altar that's not the Christians the Christians already gone in the Rapture but partial Revelation in 1959 he was moving up just like me and you move up God was bringing him through this to adoption time in 1959 6061 62 to 1963 we'll get to that in a minute now how long Lord how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power not into one man group of people his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us now remember he's not going to become visible Among Us here in flesh so it's in your flesh it's in us that's a requirement the world will see me no more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you till the end of the age till Christ becomes Vis visible Among Us raises the dead and we go into Rapture all right so let's just for a moment stop for a second and go back to the three PS and see what's going on cuz remember the Genesis secret mystery we're still talking about Genesis 126 that's what I was telling you that's what came to you in your birth that is not all mankind I want to explain one more time that is not all mankind not everybody in the world are Sons and Daughters of God by birth by genetics spiritual genetics everybody with me so that is his children because he said Dominion have power power rule over Dominion you're my children let us make man in our own image and after our likeness in other words he likes us he doesn't like us he loves us we just sometimes don't like oursel and that's what gets in the way but that unfolds or reveals a mystery what is a mystery it's going to happen in this end time in human people Christ is not coming back to the Earth to stand on the earth and destroy it and do whatever he he's going to do it through the bride he's doing it through the bride his feet will not touch this Earth as rotten as it is it will not touch this Earth but he's going to touch your Earth he's going to depend on you because the adoption is what is placing everything he owns placing it on in your hands and my hands to see what we'll do with it and he knows what we'll do with it already we just don't know yet so he sent us a prophet and the prophet has a vision and he sees that there's three things that happen in his life there's little fish there's medium-sized fish and then there's a tent thereby with me we explained all that how God used him in nature because he was he was a prophet of nature he was a prophet of of one of the prophets of Elijah so we had the nature of Elijah all right so the three pulls now what is a pull it's a force that draws someone or something in a particular direction or course of action first and second pull were what we explained this last Sunday they were prayer lines temporary healing first pull was hand second pull was What secrets of the heart but now remember he he thought now he thought as a man he thought the third pole was going to be something great about that prayer line cuz he saw the vision of going into the into the tent or that little room in the tent and coming out people coming out heel hole but remember you keep going and he keeps pounding he's from 1950 something till till 1963 he keeps wondering what it is and all of a sudden God tells him what it is so Millions gathered around brother Randon Millions gathered around Noah actually I believe Noah had a crowd cuz they wanted to see what this idiot was talking about and I'm sorry but they thought he's an idiot cuz it never had rain before why was he building a boat and that boat was not big enough to carry all the people that was on the earth he only Built it by God's instructions in the God instructed him and I'm sure Noah stopped one day and looked at it and said all y'all ain't going to fit in this thing so he came to what a revelation that he was actually preaching his third pull was to the totally lost people every how many years that was up to the 120 that he preached he was preaching to people that would never get in the ark there was only eight people got in the ark and there were billions on the earth at the time and they all died every one of them but those eight people so Millions gathered around brother brandham but in the third Paul he understood then it was the Mysteries being revealed that it was going to be the spoken word of God that God was going to use a man which he used brother brandom and we'll get into something a little bit later on I'll show you where he transitioned from a place to where he would stand and say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him that was in his early part coming up he said I'm waiting on him I can do nothing without him here but if you'll look in 63 64 and 65 the little prayer lines that he called he never said that he went right straight into the prayer line he went I mean it was right straight into discernment he was just Discerning back and forth like popcorn he'd come to a place where he didn't now don't get me wrong he didn't need someone to come on the scene so that he could heal people that person had become so much involved in brother brandham till he was just expressing out what it was already inside of him he come to a adoption power with character what would he give brother brandham back in the earlier times I don't know but he waited until he knew and then he placed him on the mountain so his third poll the mysteries of the word sealed since Jesus Christ Millions left him Millions so now we know that the third pull was the opening of the seals the opening of the word that nobody's ever seen light had not shined on these things before it was hidden mysteries but they were there and it was an adoption Ministry getting people to a placing well I spelled that wrong didn't I to a placing so now look now watch here's where I believe that brother brandham was positionally placed to the world if they believe what happened now this is where brother Brown went on the M on top of the mountain and what happened God placed a sword in his hand you hear I said placed okay he went to a place to be placed and I had my hands out and all at once something hit my hand now it wasn't just odd that a sword appeared in his hand what was what was not odd to me either but what was what was so specific he said it fit my my hand it fit my hand perfectly everybody with me just was his sword just dropped out of the sky and he picked it up like who's that guy with the Aaron King Arthur no this is the sword of the king not King Arthur did I go to sleep I don't know did I go into a trance I don't know was a Division I can't tell you only thing I can say is just the same thing like them Angels was and it struck my hand now watch it struck my hand and what struck his hand a sword and I looked it was a sword and it had pearl handles real pretty and had a guard over the gold it over with gold and the blade looked like something like Chrome like silver only it was real shiny it was so feathered sharp I thought oh my I thought isn't that the prettiest thing just fit my hand he didn't reach and grab it and say man this is uncomfortable no that was the sword of the king but what happened was it had already molded into brother Ram's hand because the sword that came out of his mouth was exactly the sword that came out of God's mouth it wasn't different it felt comfortable just fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I'm always afraid of them things a sword and I thought what will I do do with that and just then a voice shook down through there that rocked the rocks and said it's the sword of the king and then I came out of it the sword of the king now if it said a sword of a king see but it said the sword of the king and there's only one king and that's God and he has only one sword and that's his word what I live by not what I deny what I live by that so helped me God standing over his holy desk here with his holy word laying here it's the word amen now watch oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and secret standing there when this left me in other words when he come out of the vision or whatever it was when it left him something just came to me and said Don't Fear now I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke I have to just tell you the truth just exact L what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pull what was it the opening of the word the mystery something that fit his hand perfect something that fit his in other words it fit his ministry perfect that's why God couldn't come to denomination he didn't take Billy Graham up on the mountain he didn't take o robbers up on the mountain Jack Schuler and all those different ones he took this man upon a mountain and then he was there and when he spoke this there was that authority of hear ye hear if you're going to get anything this is who you're going to get it from cuz brother brandham when he goes into the seals he corrects everything that he had an error about sorry don't throw tomatoes I'm just telling you there's one example right there he always thought that the saints were under the altar crying how long how long and it was not and we'll get into it when we talk about the seals first seal don't know what that was second seal don't know what that was made a horrible mistake mistake if I to U preached old notes U didn't know what the fourth was didn't know what the fifth was he had no idea what they were from one day to the next but oh when they opened up to him see when they opened up to you that gives you a confidence Revelation gives you a confidence when you got a revelation a one true and living God he gave you confidence that you didn't have to listen to a trinitarian idea and then when you had a revelation of water baptism nobody can talk you out of that I looked at our little Community Church the one June and I were married at um there it's not Pine Grove anymore but it's there in town and it said on the and on thing it says um something about something come together in baptism acts 2:41 they're not going to read acts 238 I'll promise you that yeah acts 241 they read that sometimes I think it's acts 241 but they don't have an authority God can't use like I'm sorry he can't use people like I was with and they were devoid of the spirit of God flip-flops shorts look like had pajamas on it's just devoid of that any kind of spirituality of what God would have a set of deacons that would be able to say hey don't you go in there with that with that donut there was none of that they just walked right on in actually handed you a donut don't worry that will not happen here you can go get a donut anytime but what it is though there was no reverence and I mean when you're sitting there speaking to them and they're just you know you they're there but they're not I mean I tried I stayed in the scripture I didn't quote brother brandom I promise you I stayed right in the scriptures and they still just there's no reaction ction to it there's no fervor that hey there's something to that it was just like a meeting where you just come like a lodge like brother R said just a lodge somebody's going well I have a speaker today at the lodge but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself The Works that I do shall you do also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could Express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity now listen we know brother Brandon was the first partaker of this right all right there had to be a first partaker and then the first partaker didn't keep it to himself he gave it out to the five-fold ministry and then the five-fold ministry takes it to the people is everybody with me Jesus is the one that that multiplied the fishes that loaves but he handed it to the disciples and the disciples handed it to the people telling you that there's a Ministry that comes that you've got a headship then you've got somebody that's that that captures that headship and that Revelation and then breaks it out to the people all right and then there would be time come when he would Express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride what are we anointed for adoption we're anointed to a Time time that when God's name's not going to be in that checkbook your name's going to be on the checkbook but you're not going to write it and not know what you're doing the confidence every time brother randam met God every time he met these um the the angels and every time he met the finger Mountain where he had the marriage and divorce and where he met on this mountain where God put the sword in his hand what was that doing that wasn't building my confidence that was building his confidence and when I see his confidence I'm confident that's where a great leader out on the battlefield he's just he he's got to get the confidence of the people but he's got to he can't be one that's just hiding behind the bush saying all right y'all go no he's got to be the one that grabs a sword and takes off first he leads a group of people so brother R took the sword first and it fit his hand perfect so what he preached with a perfect message to accept what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit now I put this in here because it fits but I never read this quote before and I was scrolling through you know a lot of people are are honing in on brother Ram's mistakes believe the sign blah whatever all right they honing in on on his mistakes the mistakes he made the things he did things he said that wasn't right maybe they say I'm saying they said all right let me read you this 1960 as I was with Moses and to Joshua the new commander of the army after Moses had passed on cuz now remember we're going to have a we have a Joshua commission we don't have a Moses commission Moses had a commission to take him to the promised land but remember he messed up all right so God said you're not going to the promised land but I'm not going to keep these people in the wilderness they're going to the promised land somebody's going to take them so he said Joshua as I was with Moses I'll be with you so there was a Joshua commission you and I are under that Joshua Commission Now is what not just take them in but put them where they're supposed to be there's a Ministry that tells us where it'll help you find out where your position is now watch and to Joshua the new commander of the army after Moses had passed on seeing that God stayed with him in his mistakes he held his commission up no matter what Moses done it was Moses office that God respected praise the Lord he was a prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than any Prophet they had when his own sister laughed at him for marry an Ethiopian girl he called him together and said don't you fear God there be one of you who spiritual or Prophet I will speak to him in Visions make myself known to him in dreams but it's not so with Moses I speak lip to ear with him don't you fear God you remember Mariam kind of condemned her brother for doing what he did and what did God do god struckle with Leprosy everybody with me now what happened to Sister Ma remember she slammed the door on brother Bram and said he was the brother Bram saidwell he's here he he he didn't like what you just did remember she had the tumor right almost died from it but then the third pull comes into effect and heals her of the of the tumor but I mean she struck against a prophet you listen these people that strike against the prophet I just think we need to get away from them I don't want to be here when the fire falls on the them cuz remember listen you're not turning him down you're turning God down if that's the man of the hour you're turning God down now watch see that's not a good thing to upon God's people you Hur him when you do so God had commissioned Moses his failures meant nothing God knowed his heart and he one time Moses complained about without having too much to do so God took his spirit and divided it among 70 they had no more Spirit than they had at the beginning but only thing they just had more Machinery that's what we got today more Machinery same amount of spirit God can put his entire Spirit Upon A man watch if he wants to or he can scatter it amongst thousands if he wants to one day he put his whole Spirit Upon A Man Called Jesus now he's scattered it through his church everywhere God keeps his commission so forget about the fs and failures brother B knew he had a message he brought that message and so help me God don't turn it down this is not play pretty they can play all they want to out there this is not playtime the third poll is also two the totally lost that will turn this message down be preached to brother Brown said they'll think they're still getting saved they're still getting healed and they still going to church and a door be shut now look notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on we've read this many times so brother bradam from 47 to 63 we understand that he was working under the first pull and the second pull is everybody with me all right right but when he begins to to declare his message his message was not the first pull his message was not the second pull that's why the angel kept saying quit trying to explain it move on he wanted he wanted him to move on through that and come up to the place to where he come to the third pull or the opening of the word the first pull was healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal now that was the third poll no more there's hire order to reveal F the word than a prophet but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and I don't you know they can search whoever they want to show me somebody that's more Vindicated than brother bradam scripture and by vision and by prophecy and by anything you want to talk about now I ain't talk about his mistakes like I said right there God didn't look at Moses's mistakes Moses was a murderer murder that David murder had his best friend killed just so he could get his wife that he had already been with so he commit adultery but remember God saw something in David he saw his heart and knew if that if David had the new birth he wouldn't have done that but it wasn't time for it he was stuck under or in the order of bulls and goats which covered it didn't take care of it but remember David's going to be there Samson's going to be there all those ones that had those flaws they're all going to be there but they're not bride but the only way the proper can be Vindicated by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word so now look we see that brother brandham started out the scripture there and I think it's in Timothy or somewhere where it says the the angel says do the work of an evangelist everybody with me on that all right now look what did he put in the Cornerstone of the Tabernacle he put what that angel said do the work of an evangelist make proof of your ministry and all these things that was the Cornerstone kind of odd that it was put in the Cornerstone not on top because when he when he started preaching he had to do as we're going to read here in a minute zerubabel wiped off the foundation and built the house restore brother Brown's message to was to restore us back so the Cornerstone of the Tabernacle is do was to do the work of an evangelist now taking sides with Jesus brother randam I don't know how that come black like that but must be important as I have done the work of now as I have done the work of an evangelist and here is my plea if that is pleasing to God and I've done the work all right trusting that I have pleased him what pleased him this is my son and whom I'm pleased to dwell pleased to dwell and then hear you him trusting that I pleased him asking forgiveness for all my mistakes then he may be calling me from the field of evangelism to be his Prophet I cannot be an evangelist if I'm to be an evangelist I cannot be a prophet I'm mixing the two offices that's where I've always fussed about standing on the platform it's never been good or successful I read this last week it's never what it's never been good or successful millions of people got healed on that platform thousands of people hundred thousands people received the new birth under his ministry and he said right here it's never been good successful God has used it but it NE I but I've never thought it was his direct will it's been his per Ive will stand on the platform a vision or two will knock you out almost see that's another thing when he was in the first and second pull he would only get to what eight or 10 people and then they like you saw in that in the p in the show the picture part of him he'd get so weak they'd have to pick him up that didn't happen in' 63 64 and 65 he come to a place of authority where God even had he had authority over his body brother R didn't and God did cuz it was all knock you out almost see then if you tell this person how to straighten himself up and what to do and then the next person stand there he's expecting the same thing and you can't tell him unless something tells you to tell him and then the other people feel like you're a traitor or a backslider think about that sometimes we don't think about that cuz some people be set in the audience they'll have the same identical thing that this person's got this person will receive the healing he'll call them out and that person's not well don't you think there's something something start messing with your mindset well what's you know what's wrong with with me why didn't he call me out all those things like that I'm just glad I didn't have that or a demon or something because you don't tell them what they want to know that's not the office the way a prophet operates so now he did a work of an evangelist but remember he was a prophet but he had to do the work of an evangelist to get the building built according to the Bible we'll read here in just a minute the Chief Cornerstone cornered down here at the bottom Cornerstone to something to build on not cap off with cornerstones at the bottom starts out real real low to the ground Psalms 18:22 the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner the stone which the builders in other words the Revelation which the builders refused who did they refuse The Headstone Jesus Christ but that didn't tear the Lord Jesus he said I'll come back on the day of Pentecost and I'm going to start building my church and I'm going to build it on the cornerstone what the apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone so brother R started the same way a Cornerstone message come back to God get the new birth live right conductor Doctrine do the things of God all those things but that really wasn't his message but it had to prepare people it had to prepare us even us coming through this it had to prepare us for for an event that's right real approaching we can't keep putting it off and say well let's wait till something happens well I'm not waiting until something happens listen we are fulfilling prophecy we're as we were talking the other day um where um brother bisc put on that green shirt and he testified that he was an hour and a half in that Vision before he realized it was the vision hour and a half into the vision he thought his wife had throw tot away she sewed it back up and put it in his pack he says oh I got this shirt and he puts it on hour and a half later he something tells him say look at your shirt could we be the same way could we be already in the Vision hours days weeks months and then just realize cuz Hallelujah it didn't stopped the vision that he didn't know it for an hour and a half that didn't stop what was going on it happened exactly the way brother R said a man with a little hand had on a green Checker shirt same way with the Bible this Bible is to one group of people and that's his bride it's all right so if he's the head Cornerstone he's the Cornerstone but he's going to be the headstone he is the headstone Stone to the church everybody with me that's why the church turns him down as brother Aaron was preaching and I did speak on just a minute over there uh to the Methodist brothers and sisters that a lot of PE boy they had some raised eyebrows too Aaron I said a lot of people want to be saved but you don't want him to be your Lord that's the same way with this everybody wants to have the Cornerstone but they don't want the headstone cuz the headstone is the one with the power the head Stone's the one that's the head of you and that means he's your Lord everybody with me so Stone means Revelation so kids everybody listen when I say Cornerstone headstone I mean a corner Revelation something to build on a head Revelation is Jesus Christ all right devil ain't got nothing to do with this he build his own kingdom and he can try to destroy yours but God's going to have a group of people that he's going to sit down on and cap them off and become their head I just believe it 100% Matthew 21:42 Jesus said unto them this is the scripture he's referring to did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected now the stone the Revelation that the builders supposedly the Pharisees and Sadducees and the religious people today they were supposed to be the builders but they rejected him but that didn't deter him he just come right back on the day of Pentecost as a little bitty Stone a Cornerstone to build on the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth love joy peace longsuffering Faith virtue knowledge Temperance ain't that the fruits and who's this nation us the Gentiles he's taking it from the Jews they've rejected him they rejected The Headstone taking it from them and starts building his church on the day of Pentecost with a Cornerstone message looking to the Head they never deny Jesus was not God or or or anything like that they just didn't listen sure they knew who he was but they didn't know everything about him like you and I do I'm sorry they just didn't and whosoever shall fall on this on this Stone shall be broken but on whom so it shall fall it will grind him to powder so it's okay it's it's best for us to fall on this Revelation and be broken than to have God give you judgment from the top fall and grind you to powder cuz that's what's going to happen in the tribulation that we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked people that turn down Jesus Christ if they turn you down they're turning down Jesus Christ if he's inside of you Ephesians 2:20 and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Revelation everybody with me in whom all the building now building fitly from name together groweth growth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord and whom you also are build it together for a habitation of God through the spirit you and I Isaiah 28 verse 16 therefore thus sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a revelation a precious Revelation a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste listen now remember zerubabel somebody was preaching on this not too long ago zerubabel means sown in Babylon brother randam was born in Babylon okay because he's our zerubabel of the day everybody with me Zechariah 4:6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone okay he's going to bring forth The Headstone so whoever this zerubabel is he's going to come out of the world out of Babylon and he's going to build this church build this building and bring the headstone to sit on top of it therefore with shoutings try that sometime crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of now watch the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it what is his hand it's the working part who's the working part it's me and you and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you behold I send you for who ha despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel now watch with these seven that would make him number eight now there's no eight Messengers but remember there's eight manifestations of God in the end time there's one more which takes us to The Eternity takes us into a Rapture all right is everybody with me those of you who been here a long time you heard brother Dale preach it for years they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth I was looking through the scripture just thinking about things and I was thinking about the the movie there the The Chosen the woman that washed Jesus's feet the Bible says it was Mary Magdalene but um that wasn't who washed his feet so they were a little bit off on that but Watch What Happens here's Jesus here's the headstone everybody with me here's the headstone this is the man he walks into a Pharisees house Simon and remember brother R preached many times Jesus with dirty feet but I want you to watch the allegory here in this in this scene but because when you walk into a man's house in this time of of um of um I said scripture but this time of when Jesus was there or during this there was a custom that they would put oil on your head when you walked in they'd give you oil put it on your head they make you feel cool and then they'd wash your feet remember they did not do that to Jesus so they rejected the head watch what he says though seest thou this woman he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman woman is who Church bride seest thou this woman I entered into thine house th gavest me no water for my feet now what is feet Cornerstone the bottom right here she didn't go to his head she went to his feet it wasn't time to go to the head cuz listen this woman is going to be the head this woman is going to be the one that anoints Jesus's head cuz we're going to be the anointing that anoints that head but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet kissed my feet my head with oil thou dest anoint he was telling them right then that they're going to reject his headship because they didn't do it Simon said no in other words he didn't want to because remember the scripture says he's going to be rejected The Headstone was rejected my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her me Church bride because of what you did your sins are forgiven you oh praise the Lord let's read this right here and then we'll close cuz now we're going to come into a Joshua commission and watch how this works Joshua 1 vers1 and after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead pretty plain he didn't say he's gone away didn't say he's coming back he's dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel now what land is he talking about he's talking about the inheritance of property that they were told they were going to have Abraham wherever your soul or your feet goes that's going to be the possession that's going to be where my people are going to live but right now they're out in this desert there's a couple of million of them and they don't know where they're going they know the promised land's right here but I don't want to be in ephraim's place Ephraim don't want be in manasa's place they were guaranteed they were going to be put where they are the most fruitful come on somebody the most fruitful you can work the best you know what to do in your area remember brother Brown said he didn't want Manasses didn't want corn in this one's field and this one didn't want this and in this one field that's why brother Brown said when the bride realizes who she is what she's doing here what's her position what's her place we'll be an invincible Army because we won't be fighting against each other we'll be figh with each other Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that's a soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given now he didn't say I'm going to he said I have given I've given it to you but what about he didn't say what about Lord what about this journey I got to go through what about this Wilderness I'm in don't worry I'll give you a land you have a promised land that I'm taking you to if you'll just let me get you there every place that the soul your foot from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even to the Great River the river Euphrates now that's over this way and all the land of the Hittites into the great sea which is the Mediterranean all right toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast that's on the west there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land what was the Joshua commission get them in the land get them placed all right he didn't say you didn't have to fight for it because you got to possess the gates of the enemy and I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very good C two times he said this only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law all the 1100 sermons that Moses brought us everybody with me that all right cuz of Moses commission was what to get them out but not to take them in that was Joshua's Commission Now Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand don't go after this Doctrine don't go after this Doctrine you stay with the books and the tapes that thou mayest Prosper wheresoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night read your Bible study but thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong of good courage that's the third time he told him that be Not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever and listen folks look at me just for a second that was a man that didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his soul that's a man that was under the blood of bulls and goats and did the law wow what a great position we're going to read this and then we'll then we'll U musicians come on a seed shall pess possess the Gate of his enemy now watch when they came out of the Wilderness to go into Jordan when God spoke to the famous Joshua and told Joshua to cross over to make the people ready it was in the month of April a month of floods it wasn't a flowery bed of ease the Jordan wasn't about this deep flowing real soft no it was a Roaring River all the um snow had melted from the mountains in Juda and it was overflowing sometimes we look at a river of of our life and we say man this is the worst time in the world for me to even try to get over well pray for me it was a month of April a month of floods looked like it was a poor strategy of God to bring them to that place to that old muddy Jordan the worst time in the world when the river is at its highest usually God lets you get to the last End of the Road the last mile of the way then he steps in if you're a Seed of Abraham believe God and hold his promise for healing for salvation for the baptism of the Holy Ghost whatever it is whatever the enemy is God lets you get something sometime right to the end of the road happened to me happened to you it's happened to all of us and it looks worse than it ever did the doctor said there's not a chance but you're the the Seed of Abraham with a promise that you shall possess the Gate of every enemy now watch this Joshua commission Joshua didn't stand there and try to figure out how to get across the river God told him get the ark get the priest put them in front soon as they touch the water the waters are going to part but now look have your people go several hundred yards behind because they never been that way before let the preachers go first first let the preachers get the message then tell you how to walk across Joshua didn't think how wide Jordan was or how muddy it was he said Gather yourself together sanctify yourself and take the Ark of God and go forward and he possessed the Gate of the enemy why because he was taking a promised people to a Promised Land by a promise of God and was the children of Abraham how many of you are children of Abraham if you're not get in cuz remember we all got to Cross Jordan sometime we'll stop right there come and stand we'll finish Sunday don't look at circumstances I know sometimes we We Fall Down and we think how in the world can we do that anymore I've tried this way and this way and this way well maybe you going to need to quit trying maybe you need to let God do it for you we get oursel we get ourselves in the way a lot of times but if we're under that Joshua commission somebody which now Joshua remember was a time is the Holy Ghost right right everybody with me that's not Joshua is not one man that's going to lead us through brother random came and led us up to the promised land everybody right with me he even showed us into the promised land because he had a vision of the future home he had a vision of the Millennium he had a vision of the Rapture and a vision of the Resurrection he showed us and told us what was going to happen but he couldn't go cuz it it wasn't his commission there's not a Joshua one person a man named Joshua or one man going to lead us out of here it's going to be a collective body of people with a Joshua commission to get us placed where we're supposed to be and listen when you get into that place you got to be able to use it you got to know where you're at folks if you floundering around come for prayer get a prayer clo cry out to God find out your position cuz I'm telling you the devil is going to give you one if you don't find one from God the devil's going to give you something that'll satisfy your outside person that'll give you a feeling that'll give you an emotion but those people when they got placed in the promised land the problem with them is is they didn't kill everybody that they were supposed to kill they left a few of this one to certain place they left some of the Hittites they left some of these people you and I are not supposed to leave one person because remember what happened to Saul the prophet Samuel told him you go down there you kill everything don't leave nothing Samuel walks in and they're sitting there having a party and there set two kings over there in the corner in a jail and Samuel says I hear the Lo of sheep I hear a sound that I shouldn't be listening to and and what are these two men doing here what did that Prophet do he executed those two kings throw the sword at Saul and said you're out of here buddy you're not even worth you not you didn't do what I told you to do to obey is better than sacrifice let's sing a song God bless you if you have a need he the great am man [Music] a That's the Song of the [Music] rede once my heart and [Music] soul by the chains of [Music] s the Great

take it just by a flowery bed of e it might have been a place flowing with milk and honey but it also had enemies in it the enemy had come in and took the land over but God promised the Israelites not those squatters God promised you the promises that he gave us in this Bible he did not promise them to the devil's kids that's the thing we talk about adoption God's not going to adopt the devil's kids he's going to adopt his own children because you're a child of God at the new birth then you get to be placed into what God wants you to be so just remember that Glory [Music] Hallelujah blessing

the Jordan was overflowing it didn't matter if it was that much or or the whole valley they had to get across but did they get across by shovels and did they get across by boats and man-made ideas no they got across because God told them what to do and they got across that way when that priest foot hit that water it didn't just clear it back brother Lise it did just like he did he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you brother Alex he didn't just they didn't trudge across on mud no when they come out of Egypt that big old River I mean that big old Lake the Red Sea it parted and God blew a wind all night and what it done was it made that clay just as hard as a rock so all the camels and all the horses and all the Chariots could get across on dry land same way with Joshua they went across on dry land because he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you as he was with all people as he was with brother randam he'll be with us you just got to believe that now the office of a prophet is over here don't worry about that we're not all prophets okay but we are prophetic people that can understand a prophet that's my whole thing we got to understand the prophet because he's got the mind of God so what are we doing we're actually getting the mind of God through that vessel and I pray that we'll receive that as we continue through this adopt series of adoption that we'll see who we are see what we got open the book look at the will and see what God's give us let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this evening Lord I pray that you'd bless each one be with us Lord discern our things Lord that we need to get rid of father and may we do that Lord may we come to a place to where your you're pleased to dwell not only that but to hear our voice Lord speak as you speak father Lord we've got to come to the place to we realize who we are and what we're doing here father it's getting late all the things we see the world falling apart we see earthquakes we see this now fires and now they're saying now that these next two rounds of tornadoes is going to be the worst that's ever been Lord I pray that you'd give us all shelter hide us under your wings father and be with us Lord as our journey continues we come back together Lord Sunday just be with us Lord be with the ones that are being baptized Lord the ones being dedicated Lord I pray that we'll all dedicate ourselves Sunday also to Lord being more like you father we love you Lord we thank you for these people that you have sent Lord we ask you to be with them on the highways take care of them in the name of Jesus we pray amen God bless you come and the move is on the Lord the move is all
