[26:42] amen
[26:44] we're going to look uh
[26:46] joshua chapter four begin
[26:48] verse uh one through nine
[26:50] i really like these screens this is nice
[26:53] i'm just kind of getting used to no not
[26:55] this this is my first time with all this
[26:57] so all the other brothers have got to do
[26:58] this before so
[27:00] it is nice but anyway praise the lord uh
[27:03] and it says joshua 4 verse 1 says and it
[27:06] came to pass when all the people were
[27:08] clinging past
[27:10] over jordan that the lord spake unto
[27:12] joshua saying
[27:13] take you 12 men out of the people out of
[27:16] every tribe a man and command you them
[27:19] saying take you hence out of the midst
[27:21] of jordan out of the place where the
[27:23] priests feet stood firm twelve stones
[27:26] and you shall carry them over with you
[27:28] and leave them in the lodging place
[27:30] where ye shall lodge this night then
[27:33] joshua called the twelve men whom he had
[27:35] prepared
[27:36] of the children of israel out of every
[27:38] tribe of man and joshua said unto them
[27:40] pass over before the ark of the lord
[27:43] your god into the midst of jordan so
[27:45] there's
[27:47] they're they're doing two things
[27:49] so they're taking one set of stones and
[27:50] they're putting it where they're going
[27:52] to reside but they're going back in
[27:54] where the priests are
[27:55] get back into the back into the jordan
[27:59] it says and you take every man you a
[28:00] stone upon his shoulder according unto
[28:03] the number of the tribes of the children
[28:05] of israel that this may be a sign among
[28:08] you that when your children ask their
[28:10] fathers in time to come saying what mean
[28:13] ye by these stones then you shall answer
[28:15] them that the waters of jordan were cut
[28:17] off before the ark of the covenant of
[28:19] the lord
[28:20] that's the reason i sung that song
[28:24] because you know
[28:25] when he comes in
[28:27] he'll cut him off
[28:29] the swelling of jordan
[28:32] he cut the waters off parted the waters
[28:36] it says they were cut off before the ark
[28:37] of the covenant lord when it passed over
[28:39] jordan and the waters of jordan were cut
[28:41] off
[28:42] and these stones shall be a memorial
[28:43] unto the children of israel forever
[28:46] and the children of israel did so as
[28:48] joshua commanded and took up 12 stones
[28:50] out of the midst of jordan as the lord
[28:52] spake unto joshua according to the
[28:53] number of the tribes of the children of
[28:55] israel and carried them over
[28:58] with
[28:59] he just ran out of
[29:02] we're down
[29:04] with them under the place where they
[29:06] lodged and laid them down there and
[29:08] joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of
[29:10] jordan in the place where the feet of
[29:12] the priests which bear the ark of the
[29:14] covenant stood and there they are unto
[29:17] this day and then we're going to
[29:19] continue down verse 19.
[29:22] pick up verse 19 and say just reading
[29:24] the whole chapter but i just want to
[29:25] read this and it says and the people
[29:26] came up out of jordan on the 10th day of
[29:29] the first month and encamped in gilgal
[29:32] in the east borden border of
[29:34] jericho
[29:36] and these 12 stones which they took out
[29:39] of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal
[29:42] and he spake unto the children of israel
[29:44] saying when your children shall ask
[29:45] their fathers and time to come see now
[29:47] they're asking about the the first
[29:49] stones that's in the water and now he's
[29:51] talking about the others they're sending
[29:52] another memorial up and he said when
[29:55] they asked their fathers and time to
[29:57] come said what mean these stones then
[29:58] you shall say
[30:00] let your children know saying israel
[30:02] came up came over this jordan on dry
[30:04] land
[30:06] for the lord your god dried up the
[30:07] waters of jordan from before you
[30:11] until you were passed over as the lord
[30:14] your god did to the red sea when he
[30:16] dried up from before us until we were
[30:20] gone over that all the people of the
[30:22] earth might know that the hand of the
[30:24] might know the hand of the lord that it
[30:26] is mighty that ye might fear the lord
[30:28] your god forever amen god bless you
[30:31] tonight you can be seated
[30:34] and it's quite interesting reading when
[30:36] you when you start to read this because
[30:40] when when he's speaking of the children
[30:42] of israel coming
[30:44] and then
[30:45] when you when he's speaking there's two
[30:47] sets of stones that they're set up and
[30:50] one's in the water and one's outside the
[30:52] water it's in there it's in their
[30:53] lodging
[30:54] and then
[30:56] he says that
[30:57] he departed
[30:59] the jordan
[31:01] when they come over
[31:03] into the promised land as the red sea
[31:06] was parted for those that came out of
[31:08] egypt
[31:09] so they so you know they all because you
[31:12] know those
[31:13] the young ones
[31:15] as brother wade was preaching on sunday
[31:16] those young ones when they they were
[31:18] born in the journey
[31:20] they were born in the way
[31:23] so they there's a lot of them they
[31:25] didn't know
[31:26] the crossing of the red sea
[31:29] but they heard
[31:30] of the crossing
[31:32] they knew what took place because they
[31:35] had heard
[31:37] what what was taking place in
[31:39] in the journey
[31:42] and so you know here here's here's a
[31:44] young group that that heard all these
[31:47] things but you know they didn't have an
[31:50] experience of their own
[31:52] but here they are this this group as
[31:54] they come up and god gives them an
[31:57] experience just like he gave the
[31:59] children that their fathers when they
[32:01] came up
[32:02] they had they had us just the same kind
[32:04] of experience that they had to go
[32:06] through and you know
[32:08] there's several different things that
[32:10] you just
[32:12] you when you look at this tonight
[32:13] because you know when you see that
[32:16] god
[32:18] he was so real
[32:19] and he was he was so
[32:23] present
[32:25] before the people
[32:28] that when he began to speak and he began
[32:30] to do and he it was there
[32:34] and you know and and and here you know
[32:36] when they were in the
[32:38] in the in egypt
[32:40] when they were in bondage you know god
[32:43] come and spoke to them to bring them out
[32:48] you know he didn't he didn't forget
[32:50] about him
[32:52] but he came
[32:54] and you know and every time that when he
[32:56] when he started to bring them out
[32:58] everything that they came up against he
[33:00] had an answer for and he showed himself
[33:02] present and he showed himself real
[33:06] and he showed himself faithful to the
[33:07] people
[33:09] so that every time anything happened
[33:11] there was not anything that god failed
[33:13] at
[33:14] to give them give them an answer because
[33:17] here they are in bondage to to the
[33:19] greatest nation
[33:21] that's on the face of the earth
[33:24] and here they are here they are living
[33:26] in bondage
[33:27] and they begin to cry out to god because
[33:29] they god didn't forget who they were
[33:32] sometimes they forgot who they were but
[33:34] god didn't forget who they were and he
[33:36] never forgot his covenant with those
[33:38] people
[33:40] and here they are when that when he
[33:41] comes to him in egypt to bring them out
[33:44] within everything that was uh was a
[33:46] hindrance to them that was that was
[33:49] strong and mighty he destroyed
[33:53] you know when you when you go back and
[33:55] you when you begin to read in the old
[33:56] testament when you begin to read each
[33:59] one of the plagues that came what was
[34:01] what was
[34:02] the answer for one of the plagues
[34:04] each plague what was it it was attacking
[34:06] a deity a god that egypt had
[34:10] they worshipped they worshipped the god
[34:12] of the nile well guess what they they
[34:14] couldn't keep it from turning into blood
[34:19] so when you when you began to see all of
[34:21] the things there was each time they had
[34:23] a deity or a god well then god raised up
[34:25] and said you know what your god has no
[34:27] power
[34:28] your deity has no power so you know what
[34:30] i'm going to send fleas
[34:32] and flies and the frogs and everything
[34:35] else
[34:37] and i'm gonna make it so i'm gonna make
[34:39] it so dark that the darkness is failed
[34:43] and here and here and each one of things
[34:45] and you know and then he took and
[34:47] uh slave slayed the first the firstborn
[34:51] of man and beast why because he showed
[34:53] each one of their gods that the
[34:54] egyptians
[34:56] had all of their faith that had all
[34:58] their confidence in who was binding them
[35:01] who had them under bondage but you know
[35:03] what they they had all of their
[35:05] confidence in all this and god went in
[35:06] there and destroyed every one of them
[35:08] he been every one of them
[35:11] i was listening to brother trevor iman
[35:13] some time back and brother trevor was i
[35:15] didn't i didn't know this i thought it
[35:16] was quite interesting that uh the
[35:18] egyptians actually thought that frogs
[35:20] were um very important they were some
[35:23] kind of in their deity you know it was
[35:25] it was a a sin
[35:27] to kill a frog
[35:30] so you know what they had all them frogs
[35:31] and they couldn't get rid of them
[35:34] so you know it's one more night with the
[35:35] frogs but they were there was no way
[35:36] getting rid of them
[35:39] but you know what each one of those
[35:41] things was done to prove to the children
[35:44] of israel that god was present that god
[35:46] was faithful that god was
[35:48] powerful
[35:49] that he had the power to lead them
[35:52] so that everything they went through he
[35:54] gave them an answer to
[35:57] then when he told him he set him in
[35:58] order and he told him he said take the
[36:00] lamb
[36:02] he said he said take take this lamb he
[36:05] said roast it with fire
[36:07] he said no water it has to be roasted
[36:10] with fire all of its intros has to be
[36:14] it's a full lamp
[36:17] now you know when you when you think
[36:19] about that sometimes you know that might
[36:20] not miss most uh
[36:22] appetizing smell
[36:26] when you're racing that whole thing by
[36:27] itself but you know that's what they
[36:29] were supposed to eat they had to have
[36:30] their shoes on their feet their staff in
[36:33] their hand eating that unleavened bread
[36:37] why because he was telling listen now
[36:38] it's time because of what you've seen
[36:41] what i've done
[36:43] what i what i have promised now it's
[36:45] going to come to pass and now it's time
[36:46] for you to leave
[36:48] now it's time for you to we're going to
[36:50] eat this
[36:51] and then we're going to leave and so he
[36:54] give them all everything that they had
[36:55] needed
[36:56] for the journey set them in order and
[36:58] then and then he brought them out
[37:01] but the first time that he brought them
[37:02] out when he brought them out
[37:05] of egypt the first time they have a
[37:07] problem then they then they want to
[37:09] murder moses and aaron
[37:12] they want to murmur and complain why
[37:14] because but they've not seen what god
[37:15] has done up to that point
[37:17] they've not had confidence in what god
[37:19] has done up to that point so when they
[37:20] come to the red sea then all of a sudden
[37:22] here they are it's like what's going to
[37:23] happen
[37:25] you know you just brought us out here to
[37:26] get killed
[37:27] well no god god
[37:30] has set everything in order
[37:32] he's brought you this far
[37:36] know it's for it's further than they
[37:37] would it went on their own
[37:41] it was it was further than they could
[37:42] they could do by themselves and he's
[37:43] already brought them out
[37:47] he he showed that the egyptians were
[37:48] powerless
[37:50] and he brought them out there and then
[37:51] they want to complain well i don't know
[37:52] what are you going to do now
[37:58] and so
[37:59] how ungrateful
[38:01] people can be because of what but god's
[38:04] faithful
[38:05] and he didn't he didn't give up on them
[38:07] they want to give up on god
[38:09] and so here they are when he brings them
[38:11] out and they come to the red sea then he
[38:13] tells moses speak the word and go
[38:15] forward why are you crying to me
[38:18] and so he speaks the word he split then
[38:20] the word the waters part and they cross
[38:22] over
[38:24] and then every time and then you know
[38:26] they were only a few days journey from
[38:27] where they from where they were supposed
[38:29] to be
[38:32] yet yet and all all of the things that
[38:34] god done for them they never were
[38:36] satisfied they never could believe what
[38:39] god done for them that god was going to
[38:41] carry them over
[38:43] then then we see when that when so you
[38:45] know they had all all of those people
[38:48] that didn't believe
[38:49] moses come to a place and tell them that
[38:51] listen
[38:52] you're all gonna die
[38:53] your carcasses will rot in the
[38:55] wilderness
[38:56] the book of numbers tells us he said he
[38:58] said he said your children which you
[39:00] said shall be of a prey
[39:03] will go in and take the land but your
[39:04] carcasses will rot in the wilderness
[39:08] so he made a promise to those people
[39:10] that they would go into that land
[39:12] when when he carried the all all of them
[39:15] all of that way and brought him up to
[39:17] the place and showed everything was
[39:19] faithful
[39:21] what is the scripture tells us when when
[39:23] he come and when he made the ark of the
[39:25] covenant
[39:27] or the ark of the testimony as the
[39:28] scripture tells us he calls it the ark
[39:30] of the testimony what was it it was a
[39:32] testimony of god's faithfulness to the
[39:35] people and showed it was a rebuke to
[39:37] them
[39:38] when he made the tables of stone and he
[39:41] put it in the ark
[39:43] was a testimony against them
[39:45] because moses had went into the mountain
[39:48] to get the word that god had wrote with
[39:50] his finger on the tablet
[39:54] and god had spoken to moses to bring
[39:56] them to that place when god wanted to
[39:58] have fellowship with them one that
[40:00] wanted to have fellowship with each one
[40:01] of them and they were and they could not
[40:03] come to that place oh we don't don't
[40:05] don't let god speak to us
[40:08] moses you go get it we don't want to
[40:09] have we don't want to have to have that
[40:11] fellowship
[40:12] we don't want to have we don't want to
[40:14] have a a kind of relationship like that
[40:17] oh no no no no no we're going to let you
[40:19] do that
[40:21] but see so here here was what what were
[40:23] they doing when moses went into the
[40:25] mountain for for god to give moses the
[40:28] the law give him the word what were they
[40:30] doing
[40:31] they were down there committing idolatry
[40:35] what they do go down there and build a
[40:37] golden calf
[40:40] and here they are in the midst of golden
[40:41] cat well you know what here because you
[40:43] know what they couldn't wait
[40:45] they couldn't wait on god
[40:48] well moses must be gone you know we're
[40:50] all here by ourselves you know so
[40:53] and then you know then all of a sudden
[40:55] it's like hey well um aaron we want you
[40:58] to give us
[40:59] some gods we need something
[41:03] well then then aaron aaron's like well
[41:05] you just you know just give me your gold
[41:07] your earrings and we'll uh then he told
[41:09] moses hey we just threw it in the fire
[41:11] that just come out as a golden calf can
[41:12] you imagine that
[41:15] it was a miracle
[41:19] no the miracle was when god came down
[41:21] and he wrote on a tablet and gave it and
[41:23] moses smashed the tablet
[41:26] but see the the second set that that he
[41:28] was given went into the art well see
[41:30] that was that was a test a testimony
[41:33] that was a rebuke to them because of
[41:35] what god had done
[41:38] when god was was giving them the word
[41:41] and trying trying to have a relationship
[41:43] with him trying to have communication
[41:45] with them wanting to have communion and
[41:47] what they want to do no we just we just
[41:49] want to live like let's just like the
[41:50] egyptians did we just want to have
[41:52] we just want to have just like everybody
[41:54] else and out there and around us you
[41:56] know we just want to have just uh same
[41:58] kind of uh
[42:00] relaxed kind of life and just you know
[42:02] do whatever kind of be religious or
[42:03] whatever but we don't want to actually
[42:05] have to actually be christians we don't
[42:07] actually have to be followers of the
[42:08] word
[42:10] but we're just going to do our own kind
[42:11] of thing
[42:13] and so here they are and and then you
[42:15] know they wanted to murmur and complain
[42:16] this whole time and god's faithful to
[42:18] him and then he
[42:19] has aaron write his put his name on the
[42:22] on the the rod and he put it in the
[42:24] before the tabernacle and you know and
[42:26] it budded
[42:28] say hey you know what y'all y'all want
[42:30] to believe who's in charge with it let
[42:32] me show you what's going to happen
[42:34] and when the rod budded then did he put
[42:36] it in there as a testimony against them
[42:38] it was a rebuke to the people
[42:41] the manna that fell failed
[42:44] all those years that the manna failed
[42:46] for those people
[42:47] every single day they get out you don't
[42:49] have to work you don't have to you don't
[42:50] have to tow you don't have to shovel you
[42:52] don't have to dig holes or pull weeds or
[42:54] nothing like that it just comes out of
[42:56] the sky and all you gotta do is pick it
[42:57] up if you're not too lazy to do that
[43:02] but i mean it was it was it was but it
[43:04] was a supernatural thing that took place
[43:06] every day and you know what they could
[43:07] say we loathe this stuff
[43:10] we can't stand this stuff
[43:12] we can't stand what the fivefold
[43:14] ministry is preaching
[43:17] we're getting sick of this
[43:20] but it was a supernatural thing that god
[43:22] done and he took up an armor of this and
[43:23] he put it in the ark of the testimony
[43:25] and what was it it was a rebuke to the
[43:27] people
[43:29] that god had been faithful to him the
[43:30] whole time and they didn't believe him
[43:34] and it's the same way with you and i we
[43:35] can get to the place where you know god
[43:37] is doing so much has done so much things
[43:39] for us but you know what sometimes we
[43:40] can't have faith to believe that god is
[43:42] on the scene that god is real and when
[43:44] you know when you come up for prayer or
[43:46] you have a need or you have wayward
[43:48] loved ones and we can't trust god to
[43:50] come on the scene and do his work then
[43:51] you know what it's it's a you know it's
[43:53] a slap in the face
[43:54] of god it's a rebuke to us that we can't
[43:56] believe that
[43:59] that god has done so much for us and we
[44:01] can't believe that he can that he's
[44:03] still the same
[44:06] you know just like them all the things
[44:07] that god done he was there on the scene
[44:09] and you know he he was so real and he
[44:11] met every one of their needs and all the
[44:12] supernatural things where they didn't
[44:14] get sick
[44:16] their clothes didn't wear out all the
[44:18] things that they went through and you
[44:19] know what they couldn't be they couldn't
[44:20] believe that god could get them to the
[44:21] next stop
[44:24] every time they come to every time they
[44:26] come you know whatever it was you know
[44:28] they
[44:29] what are we going to do now moses
[44:33] we got to murmur and complain
[44:37] and even even when when he came and
[44:41] you know when when cora and them came
[44:42] and you know they they wanted to rise up
[44:44] and say you know
[44:46] you know you're not the only one that's
[44:48] uh anointed around here you know you're
[44:49] not the only one who knows the mind of
[44:51] god
[44:52] you're not you're not the only one that
[44:53] can do all these things moses
[44:56] we are too
[44:58] and then moses is like well we'll find
[44:59] out
[45:01] well you know if these people have just
[45:04] live a natural life and anything nothing
[45:06] supernatural happens to them then you
[45:07] know what they're of god
[45:09] but you know if something happens to
[45:11] these people then you're going to see
[45:12] that the hand of god is against those
[45:14] people
[45:17] and when the earth opened up swallowed
[45:18] all them and all their belongings and
[45:19] everything and the next day you know
[45:21] they ran from moses and oh and then they
[45:23] stay there out there you killed the you
[45:25] killed the people of god
[45:29] no you just heard moses just told you
[45:33] that god was going to be supernatural
[45:35] and destroying these people
[45:37] and they still don't believe it
[45:41] and so when all these things took place
[45:43] here all the way through god was leading
[45:45] them
[45:47] but you know there's a young group there
[45:49] was a young group that was there that
[45:51] saw all those things
[45:54] you know can you imagine you you go to
[45:57] church and you hear moses preach and
[45:59] moses telling you these things and your
[46:01] mom and dad's like well moses he's just
[46:04] got you know one foot in the grave and
[46:05] one on the banana peel and you know he
[46:07] don't know what he spent too long in the
[46:09] sun and you know he's just you know his
[46:11] mind's a little baked and you know or
[46:13] whatever you know they have all these
[46:14] things where they just want to look at
[46:16] moses and say well moses ain't all that
[46:18] he thinks he is
[46:22] but you know he has you know but there
[46:23] was a group that saw those things but
[46:25] you know what every time they come up to
[46:27] see these hardships and these problems
[46:29] there was a group that was there that
[46:31] actually believed and saw what god would
[46:33] do
[46:34] they saw the faithfulness of god in
[46:36] their midst
[46:40] and you know and they had they had two
[46:42] witnesses
[46:44] out of 12
[46:47] that that actually actually went into
[46:49] the promised land and came back
[46:52] now can you imagine you know
[46:54] you see all these people
[46:56] and these and these spies are coming
[46:58] back and they're having to carry this
[47:00] great big cluster of grapes and all
[47:01] these things and they're telling you man
[47:03] guess what that land is just like god
[47:05] said it was gonna be it's everything
[47:06] that's in that land is flowing with milk
[47:08] and honey everything
[47:12] and and even god said that we that
[47:14] belonged to us that was our inheritance
[47:17] but you know what we look like
[47:19] grasshoppers compared to them there's no
[47:21] way we can go in there and take it
[47:25] well you know it one thing isn't is it
[47:27] greater to god than anything else and
[47:29] he's brought them all that way
[47:32] and all the miracles that that's that's
[47:34] taken place
[47:36] and he's standing there and he's like
[47:38] well i don't i don't know if i can do
[47:40] that or not
[47:42] but those young people were standing
[47:43] there and they heard two men
[47:47] joshua and caleb
[47:51] and they heard the testimony of two men
[47:55] well maybe that maybe they were on the
[47:57] fence sometimes maybe maybe the young
[47:59] people were there and you know sometimes
[48:00] sometimes they were like well you know
[48:02] daddy says this but you know when you
[48:04] hear joshua boy it's so so strong you
[48:06] know it's so real it's so you know it's
[48:08] like boy you know i think i think i i
[48:09] feel like i could do it and it's like
[48:11] you know well mama says this
[48:14] and it's like you know i i don't i don't
[48:15] know you know i i i've started to get a
[48:17] little a little concerned a little
[48:19] scared because when mama talks about you
[48:21] know i don't know if we're gonna make it
[48:23] or not but you know i can hear caleb and
[48:24] caleb is stirring something inside of me
[48:29] so you know then there there's that
[48:31] battle that they have to go through
[48:32] these young people
[48:34] but you know what every single one of
[48:36] those old fighters those men of war
[48:39] the scripture says they died
[48:42] you know what mama died
[48:45] and then daddy died and you older
[48:48] brother and everybody else everybody
[48:50] else is passing on
[48:53] then all of a sudden you know they start
[48:55] to grow up and it's like you know what
[48:56] hey um
[48:58] we get into the place where we may have
[49:00] to do this
[49:02] and it's like i got to make this
[49:03] decision for myself
[49:07] i can i can look at the i can look at
[49:09] the figures of my parents
[49:11] of my grandparents
[49:14] but brothers and sisters then it becomes
[49:16] to us it's like
[49:19] what is are we going to have the same
[49:21] failures
[49:25] you know
[49:26] you know our parents have done the best
[49:28] that they could for us
[49:30] but you know lots of people have seen
[49:32] the the faults and failures of their
[49:34] parents and some people you know that's
[49:36] what's held them back
[49:40] and then other people you know they've
[49:41] seen the they've seen the thoughts and
[49:43] failures of their parents they've seen
[49:45] the shortcomings but you know what that
[49:47] didn't stop them
[49:50] well praise god you know if mama only
[49:53] got so far that's that was mama's that
[49:55] was mama's experience but that's not my
[49:57] experience
[49:58] i've got to have my own experience and
[50:01] if and if daddy could only get so far
[50:03] well praise god that was daddy's
[50:04] experience but he can only get so far
[50:06] but i've got i've got to come to a place
[50:07] where i believe that i can have an
[50:09] experience of my own that i've got to
[50:11] over that i can overcome because i've
[50:13] heard the word that i've heard the word
[50:16] of joshua i've heard the word of jesus
[50:19] the savior i've heard his word
[50:22] the one that's going to lead us over
[50:24] i've heard the word amen
[50:26] now it didn't happen overnight
[50:29] but you know what they began to walk in
[50:31] that word
[50:34] they began to grow and they they began
[50:35] to take a hold of what was what was
[50:37] being preached to them
[50:40] he's like well i don't understand all
[50:41] this i don't underst i don't understand
[50:44] the seals i don't underst i don't
[50:45] understand 70 weeks of daniel i don't
[50:48] understand these things but you know
[50:49] what i still believe it
[50:52] i don't you know maybe i don't
[50:53] understand the oneness of the godhead
[50:55] and i don't understand these things but
[50:56] you know that you know it's still
[50:58] there's something that that draws me
[51:02] you know what they hold on to that
[51:05] he's like well you know they have
[51:06] parents that you know that's walked in
[51:08] the walked in the message and they've
[51:09] turned and walked out and said well i
[51:10] don't know i don't know if this is right
[51:12] or if this is true or get it whatever
[51:13] but you know they still got young people
[51:15] they still holding on
[51:17] they still because they're going to make
[51:19] a decision for themselves
[51:22] and all the way they came through that
[51:23] through that wilderness journey and they
[51:25] seen all the death and destruction and
[51:27] all the ones falling away but you know
[51:28] what there was something that god had
[51:30] spoken to them and it stirred inside of
[51:32] them that that was for me
[51:35] that's mine
[51:36] so when they came to this experience
[51:38] when they came to the waters of jordan
[51:40] and joshua had rose up and and moses
[51:43] came to the end of his ministry and then
[51:46] when he when he come to the end of it
[51:47] then he went to cross over that the lord
[51:50] took him and he raised up joshua and he
[51:52] told joshua you carry the people in well
[51:55] then the scripture tells us that he
[51:57] magnified joshua in the eyes of the
[51:59] people that they understood that joshua
[52:02] was going to carry them over that joshua
[52:04] god had commissioned him and had enabled
[52:07] him to carry them over
[52:09] that that he was anointed to bring them
[52:11] to that place
[52:13] and so when they came to that place then
[52:15] they had the anointing to cross over
[52:18] and so here they are when they're coming
[52:20] to this jordan experience you know what
[52:22] they saw the ark of the covenant go
[52:24] forth the word but went forth and the
[52:26] priests had stepped into the water and
[52:28] the swelling of jordan
[52:30] brother branham said you know it would
[52:32] be the most crazy time the most
[52:34] unscientific
[52:35] time to pick to go cross over jordan
[52:39] who would who would want to cross over
[52:41] jordan at this time because it's so
[52:43] swollen
[52:45] so it's the worst time to try to cross
[52:47] over
[52:49] with all of that water that's coming out
[52:51] of the mountains is such a force
[52:55] and all of a sudden joshua tells the
[52:57] priest
[52:58] you carry the word forth
[53:01] no wonder what the circumstances look
[53:03] like the word goes first
[53:05] make the word the preeminent part
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:09] and as they begin to bring the wa the
[53:13] the ark into the water as they begin to
[53:14] step in
[53:16] then the waters begin to part
[53:20] and as they begin to walk then all of a
[53:21] sudden the priests are beginning to
[53:23] stand
[53:24] the priests are standing in the midst of
[53:26] the jordan and it has spread apart and
[53:29] it's dry land
[53:31] now the priests are still standing there
[53:33] holding the ark in the water
[53:37] and then joshua tells in terms of the
[53:39] people and tells them listen y'all cross
[53:41] over now
[53:43] and
[53:44] what's so amazing about that is if you
[53:46] can't see the necessity of the fifo
[53:48] ministry
[53:50] what is going to bring you over what's
[53:52] going to bring you into the overcoming
[53:54] if you can't see that it takes the
[53:55] fivefold ministry to bring you to that
[53:57] place that i i think you're blind
[54:01] and so many people are spiritually blind
[54:02] it's the necessity because the the word
[54:05] has to be set in order
[54:08] and it takes the fivefold ministry to do
[54:10] that
[54:12] because god spoke through the brother
[54:14] branham the prophet and the prophet gave
[54:17] us the word
[54:18] to set a five-fold ministry in order
[54:21] well you know what he never done away
[54:22] with that it was still
[54:24] paul wrote about it it's all throughout
[54:26] the scripture
[54:28] and so when they set it in order then it
[54:30] takes it takes it's not us
[54:33] but it took the word
[54:35] and the and the and the
[54:39] those priests when they stepped out what
[54:41] was it they were following the word of
[54:43] the prophet
[54:45] they were joshua was the one that was
[54:47] anointed to speak and he spoke them into
[54:50] position and they walked into the water
[54:53] so it's not it's not
[54:55] brother wade it's not me it's not
[54:57] brother louise there nobody like that
[54:58] but it's god speaking through the
[55:01] prophet to us
[55:03] so it's not our message it's not our
[55:05] thought but it's the word of god
[55:07] that we can set things in order that's
[55:09] how we overcome it because if you don't
[55:11] i mean it's so amazing it's so real
[55:14] to understand what we need in this hour
[55:18] what god has called in this hour and
[55:20] people miss it
[55:23] to bring over go over
[55:26] now the waters have parted now cross
[55:28] over
[55:31] cross over this death
[55:38] you know so wherever you are in your
[55:40] christian journey wherever god brought
[55:42] you from
[55:44] wherever it is the word is here
[55:46] the word is here for you to continue on
[55:51] continue to go forward
[55:53] god has set the the ministry in place
[55:55] for you to help you
[55:58] to minister to you now the waters have
[56:00] parted no and it's for us to go forward
[56:02] so they began to walk
[56:04] over into the promised land
[56:08] that's when joshua told him he said
[56:09] every man a tribe from every tribe there
[56:12] was a man that come and he took us
[56:14] the stones
[56:16] and he when he picked it up out of that
[56:18] dry land they carried it and put it in
[56:19] their lodging place they put it in the
[56:21] promised land they laid it up in gilgal
[56:25] there was going to be a testimony to
[56:27] what god had done
[56:30] and so when then they went back into the
[56:32] water and he said you set this set of
[56:34] stones here at their at the where the
[56:36] priest stood in the water
[56:40] and so when when they and then when when
[56:42] all of them crossed over and they set up
[56:44] the joshua set the stones
[56:47] and they had the stones
[56:48] in their in their
[56:50] in gilgal when when the priests came up
[56:53] out of the water
[56:54] then the waters
[56:56] came together and washed over the top of
[56:59] that
[57:01] you know then it as
[57:03] when you read you know when it shows
[57:05] the placing of those stones it showed
[57:10] that the sacrifice that the our our
[57:14] redemption laid there it was christ that
[57:16] took our place
[57:19] he took our place in judgment
[57:23] but you know what he brought us into the
[57:24] promised land
[57:27] and so when he set those stones up in
[57:28] their in their res the residing place
[57:31] when they set up those stones then that
[57:33] was a testimony
[57:35] that was a memorial
[57:37] to those people of what god had done
[57:41] but it was a testimony it was a memorial
[57:44] for what they had all seen
[57:49] because when they crossed over the red
[57:52] sea they failed
[57:55] when god done the miracles before they
[57:57] failed to go on
[58:00] but when he come into this place then it
[58:02] was a it was a it was a memorial to them
[58:05] that god brought them here
[58:06] they didn't do it their sales
[58:08] it wasn't god bringing you over or it
[58:10] wasn't you bringing yourself over it
[58:12] wasn't somebody else it was god that
[58:14] brought you over it was god that brought
[58:16] you into this place and when they came
[58:18] in when they came into this land then it
[58:20] was a then it was a
[58:22] a
[58:23] memorial
[58:26] or or a different term a better term
[58:29] maybe is a landmark
[58:31] and we know we know in the scripture it
[58:32] talks about having a landmark you know
[58:37] and here's here's a few scriptures in in
[58:39] deuteronomy 19 14 it says thou shalt not
[58:41] remove thy neighbor's landmark which
[58:44] they of old time have set in thy
[58:45] inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
[58:48] the land that the lord thy god giveth
[58:50] thee to possess
[58:53] deuteronomy 27 17 said cursed be he that
[58:56] removeth his neighbor's landmark and all
[58:58] the people shall say amen
[59:02] proverbs 28 or sorry 22 28 says remove
[59:06] not
[59:07] the ancient landmark which thy fathers
[59:10] have set
[59:11] so when he was referring back to those
[59:13] and and the
[59:15] the uh definition of a landmark
[59:18] is a place or a thing
[59:21] that carries religious cultural or
[59:24] historical significance
[59:26] so when they set this up it was it was a
[59:28] reminder to them of what god had done
[59:31] for them
[59:32] and he said you always bring back to
[59:35] your children
[59:37] what does the scripture tell he said he
[59:39] said tell your children and your
[59:40] children children and another generation
[59:44] so we continue to tell our children when
[59:46] they ask what does it mean by these
[59:47] stones
[59:49] well you know what we overcame
[59:53] it we took the it was the it was the
[59:54] word of god it was god's grace to us
[59:56] that we overcome this
[59:58] we overcame this when we come through
[1:00:00] this jordan the swelling of jordan and
[1:00:02] god brought us into this land
[1:00:04] this land of promise is ours because he
[1:00:07] promised it to us and he made every
[1:00:09] provision that we had need of he brought
[1:00:11] us to this place
[1:00:15] we got no signal
[1:00:20] praise lord we tied into a different
[1:00:22] signal
[1:00:26] but we see
[1:00:29] when when they begin to
[1:00:31] bring these things when he brought them
[1:00:33] into the land and he showed them this
[1:00:34] then they set that up and that was
[1:00:36] always going to be a position for them
[1:00:39] to look at to remember where they came
[1:00:40] from so they came into this land
[1:00:45] and so when we began to speak of this
[1:00:48] the first first samuel
[1:00:51] chapter 10
[1:00:52] and it says
[1:00:55] and and said
[1:00:57] he said unto the children of israel that
[1:00:59] saith the lord god of israel i brought
[1:01:01] up israel out of egypt and delivered you
[1:01:03] into the hand out of the hands of the
[1:01:05] egyptians and out of the hands of all
[1:01:07] kingdoms and of them that oppressed you
[1:01:10] he said and ye have this day rejected
[1:01:12] your god
[1:01:14] this is samuel speaking
[1:01:16] well i'll get to that in a second he
[1:01:18] said but he rejected your god who
[1:01:20] himself saved you out of your
[1:01:22] adversaries and your tribulations and
[1:01:24] you have said unto him nay but set a
[1:01:28] king over us
[1:01:30] now therefore present yourselves before
[1:01:32] the lord by your tribes and by your
[1:01:34] thousands
[1:01:36] so when they came into the land
[1:01:38] and then and here they are they they
[1:01:41] come into this land and then you know
[1:01:42] how they the the children of israel they
[1:01:44] came in and they began to take their
[1:01:46] positions and we know that uh joshua
[1:01:49] took a took a 12-part uh seven-part book
[1:01:51] and laid out the the uh inheritance to
[1:01:54] each tribe and told them and they went
[1:01:56] forth to take their land
[1:01:58] but you know we know that they didn't
[1:02:00] take all their land
[1:02:01] they couldn't get rid of all of them
[1:02:04] so when they didn't get rid of all of
[1:02:06] the uh
[1:02:09] all the ices
[1:02:10] the highlights and the jebusites and all
[1:02:14] the other problem heights that are that
[1:02:16] are in the land
[1:02:17] you know when all the ites that got in
[1:02:19] their way
[1:02:20] when they didn't get out of that when
[1:02:22] they didn't overcome them when god told
[1:02:25] them to
[1:02:27] then guess what they began to take on
[1:02:31] the spirit
[1:02:32] and the actions of the people that lived
[1:02:34] in the land
[1:02:37] so then they began to act like everybody
[1:02:38] else
[1:02:40] and here they are in the land that god
[1:02:42] give them
[1:02:44] and so when you when here in the in the
[1:02:46] scripture is is samuel speaking to the
[1:02:49] people
[1:02:50] when when they want a king
[1:02:53] and and samuel tells them he says
[1:02:56] has has have i done anything to cheat
[1:03:00] you
[1:03:01] he said if i ever told you anything in
[1:03:02] the name of the lord it didn't come to
[1:03:03] pass he said have i ever done you wrong
[1:03:06] no no no no we love you everything's
[1:03:08] great samuel
[1:03:10] but we still want to we still want a
[1:03:12] king
[1:03:14] they come into this land
[1:03:17] and you're supposed to be a separate
[1:03:18] people
[1:03:20] be separate
[1:03:22] saith the lord
[1:03:24] because you know i have a covenant with
[1:03:26] you and you're not supposed to be like
[1:03:28] everybody else but the thing is is if
[1:03:31] you run everybody out of your possession
[1:03:33] then you know what it's not a problem
[1:03:34] because they're not there
[1:03:38] but then all of a sudden when they get
[1:03:40] into the land and and god tells them to
[1:03:42] utterly destroy it and get rid of all
[1:03:44] these people then it's like well you
[1:03:45] know what we're not going to get rid of
[1:03:47] them
[1:03:48] you know what we'll do
[1:03:50] we'll just have them pay us tribute
[1:03:53] we're going to live with them
[1:03:56] but what do they do
[1:03:58] the longer they stay around these people
[1:04:00] the more they become a thorn in their
[1:04:02] flesh the more time they become a
[1:04:04] problem why because they begin to act
[1:04:06] like them
[1:04:07] because they begin to see what everybody
[1:04:09] else has got
[1:04:11] and they began well i don't i you know i
[1:04:13] i i kind of like that i kind of like
[1:04:15] that it catches my eye
[1:04:19] but you know what it's singing
[1:04:21] oh sin looks great
[1:04:26] but you know that's that's the problem
[1:04:27] it's sin
[1:04:29] and what it what is the cost in the long
[1:04:31] run what's it going to cost you in the
[1:04:33] end
[1:04:36] and when samuel began to tell them all
[1:04:38] after all this time they they they began
[1:04:40] to live and mingle and intermarry and
[1:04:43] just all the different things that they
[1:04:44] had you know they had all these problems
[1:04:46] living around these people
[1:04:48] when god told them to stay separate
[1:04:51] you need to stay away from all these
[1:04:52] people if you run them out you know what
[1:04:54] you got to be you don't have to worry
[1:04:55] about when you got hivites and jebusites
[1:04:58] and and all the amalekites and all when
[1:05:00] they're dead you know what they're not a
[1:05:01] problem
[1:05:04] but you know what when you try to bring
[1:05:05] them together and you try to work a deal
[1:05:07] you can't make a deal with the devil
[1:05:11] you can't you can't work a deal with
[1:05:13] with satan
[1:05:15] you know you're not you're not going to
[1:05:17] be halfway in the world and halfway out
[1:05:20] you're going to lose it
[1:05:22] why because he's going to oh you're
[1:05:24] going to be overcome
[1:05:28] and you know and he told and when when
[1:05:31] samuel come to that place and he and he
[1:05:33] began to cry to god that they wanted a
[1:05:35] king
[1:05:38] here they are
[1:05:39] they got into this land god's brought
[1:05:41] them all this way he's done all these
[1:05:42] great things for him well you know what
[1:05:43] we want to be like everybody else
[1:05:47] well you know what it it just it just
[1:05:49] hurts sometimes it's just it's just a
[1:05:52] little bit uncomfortable
[1:05:53] to be a little separate from ever to be
[1:05:55] a little different than everybody else
[1:05:59] you know what it just it just me it just
[1:06:00] makes me uncomfortable that to have to
[1:06:02] tell people that i'm not i'm not a
[1:06:04] trinitarian
[1:06:07] it makes you uncomfortable tell somebody
[1:06:10] that you know what women don't cut their
[1:06:11] hair
[1:06:13] it makes people uncomfortable tell them
[1:06:15] you know what because that's what the
[1:06:16] scripture says
[1:06:19] well you know i don't you know acts 2 38
[1:06:22] we don't believe in matthew 28 19 the
[1:06:24] way y'all believe it
[1:06:28] when when the holy spirit came down and
[1:06:31] landed on 120 in the upper room and they
[1:06:33] came out and you know what they were
[1:06:34] full of the holy ghost and and jesus
[1:06:37] gave the keys to the apostle peter and
[1:06:39] peter began out with the 12 and they
[1:06:41] began to preach
[1:06:42] under the holy ghost anointing when the
[1:06:44] word had been quickened inside of them
[1:06:46] and the holy ghost the the life of
[1:06:48] christ that took up residence inside of
[1:06:50] them and they began to preach and the
[1:06:51] first thing is he tells them to repent
[1:06:52] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:06:54] christ
[1:06:56] we're not going to touch that can't
[1:06:57] touch that
[1:07:00] well that's the holy that's that that's
[1:07:01] the word
[1:07:03] that was the holy ghost speaking through
[1:07:05] people that was speaking through the 120
[1:07:09] because that's what jesus promised them
[1:07:11] to take place and he said he said you
[1:07:13] will be my witnesses
[1:07:16] into in jerusalem judea and the almost
[1:07:19] other post parts of the earth
[1:07:23] but you know what you got the wrong
[1:07:25] formula you're going to be my witnesses
[1:07:28] but you're toting the wrong message
[1:07:32] okay whatever
[1:07:33] i'll sell you the brooklyn bridge
[1:07:38] but i mean but that was the truth that's
[1:07:39] what he done
[1:07:42] and so when when samuel comes up there
[1:07:44] and he begins to cry out to god for what
[1:07:46] what the people have done he said don't
[1:07:48] worry about it samuel
[1:07:50] i want you to understand something he
[1:07:52] said they didn't reject you they
[1:07:54] rejected me he said they rejected me
[1:07:57] from being their leader
[1:07:59] and he said now they're going to have
[1:08:01] somebody that's going to be just like
[1:08:03] just like the world
[1:08:06] we don't we're going we're going to just
[1:08:07] look like the joneses we're going to act
[1:08:09] like the joneses we're going to talk
[1:08:11] like the joneses
[1:08:13] we're going to go and we're going to
[1:08:14] have all the problems that the joneses
[1:08:16] have
[1:08:18] but we don't see it that way why because
[1:08:20] this this is what we've done
[1:08:22] so when when samuel walks up to him and
[1:08:24] he begins to speak this day he says and
[1:08:26] you have this day rejected your god
[1:08:29] because that's exactly what god told
[1:08:31] samuel
[1:08:33] they rejected they rejected me he said
[1:08:35] you rejected your god and him saying
[1:08:38] saved you out of all your adversities
[1:08:40] and your tribulations and you have said
[1:08:43] unto him nay but set a king over us now
[1:08:45] therefore present yourselves before the
[1:08:47] lord by your tribes and by your
[1:08:49] thousands
[1:08:52] so when he begins to tell them this and
[1:08:53] he says well guess what y'all line up
[1:08:56] and then he begins to call each trump
[1:08:58] and he calls the tribe of benjamin
[1:09:02] and then he goes to through and he calls
[1:09:04] the family
[1:09:05] and as he goes through then he calls
[1:09:08] saul
[1:09:10] and he brings salt lip
[1:09:13] the soul's got a good resume
[1:09:17] head and shoulders above everybody else
[1:09:19] nobody as goodly as as as saul
[1:09:22] he was a great man
[1:09:24] he was a great big tall man but you know
[1:09:26] what the bible says that he was little
[1:09:28] in his own sight
[1:09:30] he had the heart had his heart in the
[1:09:32] right place
[1:09:35] but you know samuel told him said listen
[1:09:36] he said no you've come into this land
[1:09:38] but you know what now you're going now
[1:09:39] you're going the wrong way
[1:09:42] but you want a king you're going to have
[1:09:43] one
[1:09:44] but he said let me tell you what's going
[1:09:45] to happen
[1:09:47] all your possessions are going to go to
[1:09:49] the king
[1:09:51] your daughters are going to work for the
[1:09:52] king
[1:09:53] your sons are going to be servants of
[1:09:54] the king
[1:09:55] all your best possessions are going to
[1:09:57] the king
[1:10:00] you're going you because hey we're going
[1:10:02] we're going to live like we're going to
[1:10:03] live like the world and you're going to
[1:10:05] pay like the world
[1:10:08] but they didn't see it that way no no
[1:10:10] we're going well it's going it's going
[1:10:11] to take the rebuke off us it's going
[1:10:13] it's going to take this stigma off us
[1:10:15] because we don't have a king
[1:10:20] and so they begin to go forward
[1:10:22] and he sets up he sets up a king
[1:10:26] and then when it when set you know when
[1:10:27] samuel speaks to saul and he tells him
[1:10:29] he said go to gilgal
[1:10:32] that's the reason i read that scripture
[1:10:34] earlier
[1:10:35] where were they at when when they set up
[1:10:37] this
[1:10:38] memorial
[1:10:39] they were in gilgal
[1:10:41] now where are they going to get their
[1:10:43] king gilgal
[1:10:45] they're going right back to the place
[1:10:46] they started
[1:10:48] well because it was a memorial god
[1:10:50] brought them over god was their leader
[1:10:53] but no they're going to have their own
[1:10:54] leader they're going to follow their own
[1:10:56] plan
[1:10:57] so they come to come to gilgal first
[1:10:59] samuel 11
[1:11:03] 15 says and the people went to gilgal
[1:11:06] and there they made saul king before the
[1:11:09] lord and gilgal and there they
[1:11:10] sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings
[1:11:12] before the lord and their saul and all
[1:11:14] the men of israel rejoice greatly
[1:11:19] so here here's they they got their king
[1:11:21] they got their wish
[1:11:24] but you know it doesn't take long
[1:11:27] before saul has a problem
[1:11:30] and the people have a problem too
[1:11:34] no no we got this thing solved we got
[1:11:36] this this way we want
[1:11:38] it this is this what that's what we want
[1:11:41] right here
[1:11:42] well then we know later on
[1:11:46] in just a couple of chapters later we
[1:11:47] know that saul has a problem
[1:11:51] those people that he was supposed to run
[1:11:53] out of the land
[1:11:54] that they were supposed to run out of
[1:11:56] the land
[1:11:57] by the name of the philistines
[1:12:00] now they've come back and they started
[1:12:02] making problems
[1:12:05] and now
[1:12:06] they are getting surrounded they're
[1:12:09] getting outnumbered and they're getting
[1:12:10] pressured by the philistines
[1:12:12] and the scripture tells us
[1:12:14] that saul it says in all israel this is
[1:12:18] psalms uh first samuel 13 verse 4 says
[1:12:22] and all israel heard say that saul had
[1:12:24] spent in a garrison
[1:12:27] of the philistines in that israel also
[1:12:30] was had an abomination with the
[1:12:33] philistines and the people were called
[1:12:35] together after saul and gilgal
[1:12:37] and the philistines gathered together
[1:12:40] together themselves together to fight
[1:12:41] with israel thirty thousand chariots and
[1:12:43] six thousand horsemen
[1:12:45] and people as the sand which is on the
[1:12:48] seashore in multitude
[1:12:52] now they didn't have a little problem
[1:12:53] they had a big problem
[1:12:56] but see that's that's the whole thing
[1:12:57] see when you when you allow the devil to
[1:12:59] have his way that's what you end up with
[1:13:03] you don't look you know it looks fine
[1:13:05] until all of a sudden
[1:13:07] you get you're getting a bad place
[1:13:10] you give a place you give place to the
[1:13:11] devil and that's what you end up with he
[1:13:13] takes it all
[1:13:14] and he said and they came up and pitched
[1:13:16] in mitch mash eastward and beth haven
[1:13:20] when the men of israel saw that they
[1:13:22] were in a strait
[1:13:24] for the people were distressed then the
[1:13:25] people did hide themselves in caves and
[1:13:27] tickets and rocks in high places and
[1:13:29] pits and some of the hebrews went over
[1:13:31] jordan to the land of gad and gilead as
[1:13:33] for saul he was yet in gilgal and all
[1:13:35] the people followed him trembling
[1:13:39] sounds like they got a good got a good
[1:13:40] leader there
[1:13:41] he didn't he didn't uh
[1:13:43] build any confidence in them
[1:13:46] they didn't have a lot of confidence in
[1:13:47] him either he said and he tarried seven
[1:13:50] days according to the set time that
[1:13:52] samuel had appointed
[1:13:54] but samuel came not to gilgal and the
[1:13:56] people were scattered from him
[1:13:59] and saul said bring hither a burnt
[1:14:01] offering to me and peace offerings and
[1:14:02] he offered to burn offering and it came
[1:14:04] to pass it as soon as he had made an end
[1:14:07] of offering the burnt offering behold
[1:14:08] samuel came and saul went out to meet
[1:14:11] him that he might salute him
[1:14:14] and samuel said what has thou done and
[1:14:16] saul said because i saw that the people
[1:14:18] were scattered from me
[1:14:20] that and that thou come us not within
[1:14:22] the days appointed and that the
[1:14:24] philistines gathered themselves together
[1:14:26] at mitch mash therefore said i the
[1:14:28] philistines will come down now upon me
[1:14:30] to gilgal
[1:14:31] and i have not made supplication unto
[1:14:34] the lord
[1:14:36] see now he's out of place
[1:14:38] i force myself therefore and offer to
[1:14:40] bear barren offering
[1:14:42] that wasn't his that wasn't his job
[1:14:45] that was not his position
[1:14:47] as we were talking about last time
[1:14:48] that's not his ministry
[1:14:50] that wasn't what god called him to
[1:14:53] and samuel said to saul thou has done
[1:14:55] foolishly
[1:14:57] thou hast not kept the commandment of
[1:14:58] the lord thy god which he commanded thee
[1:15:02] for now would the lord have established
[1:15:04] thy kingdom upon israel forever
[1:15:07] but now thy kingdom shall not continue
[1:15:10] the lord has sought him a man after his
[1:15:12] own heart and the lord hath commanded
[1:15:14] him to be captain over his people
[1:15:17] because thou hast not kept that which
[1:15:19] the lord commanded thee
[1:15:22] so when when everything went wrong and
[1:15:25] he didn't it didn't work out the way he
[1:15:26] planned it he didn't see samuel there
[1:15:29] he didn't he didn't just wait on samuel
[1:15:31] because that was the prophet and samuel
[1:15:33] said
[1:15:35] and he just got a little bit ahead of
[1:15:37] himself
[1:15:38] and soon and then all of a sudden as
[1:15:40] soon as he finished offering the
[1:15:41] sacrifice then samuel shows up
[1:15:45] and all of a sudden then he's in trouble
[1:15:46] because he's he's already broken the law
[1:15:49] he's already broken he's already and so
[1:15:51] then god said listen i rejected you
[1:15:54] you're done and i've given it i've given
[1:15:57] the kingdom over to one who's worthy of
[1:15:59] the kingdom
[1:16:01] i've been after my own heart
[1:16:03] now here so here they are and and the
[1:16:05] place where the where they set up and
[1:16:07] they crossed over
[1:16:08] and they set up this memorial
[1:16:11] and the people come back to that place
[1:16:14] and all of a sudden he does the same
[1:16:15] thing
[1:16:17] they turn the word down they leave the
[1:16:19] word there's there's the memorial there
[1:16:20] was the landmark that was set up for
[1:16:22] them in that place don't leave this
[1:16:26] don't leave this place
[1:16:29] now brother branham says
[1:16:31] and and why little bethlehem when he was
[1:16:33] talking about all the cities that uh
[1:16:36] jesus jesus could have born it been born
[1:16:38] in all these he said then there was
[1:16:40] gilgal another great spiritual place of
[1:16:43] worship
[1:16:45] so there was a so gilgal was a great
[1:16:47] place to have worship
[1:16:51] and then we know that a few chapters
[1:16:53] later in chapter 15 of first samuel we
[1:16:56] know that later on that
[1:16:58] samuel
[1:17:00] comes we go and the lord begins to speak
[1:17:02] to samuel
[1:17:04] and samuel tells him to go tell saul to
[1:17:07] go
[1:17:09] and smite
[1:17:11] the king ag
[1:17:13] and all of the people
[1:17:17] and uh
[1:17:18] the uh
[1:17:19] the amalekites
[1:17:20] and so in chapter 15 it says and then
[1:17:23] the lord then came the word of the lord
[1:17:26] unto samuel saying it repenteth me that
[1:17:28] i have set up saul to be king
[1:17:30] for he turned back from following me and
[1:17:33] hath not repent not perform my
[1:17:34] commandments
[1:17:38] and he grieved samuel and he cried unto
[1:17:40] the lord all night now listen that's
[1:17:42] that's that's the heart of a pastor
[1:17:44] right there
[1:17:47] when you see people not doing what they
[1:17:49] ought to be doing
[1:17:52] and they cry out
[1:17:56] that that that's that's a person that
[1:17:58] stands in the midst and intercedes for
[1:18:00] people
[1:18:06] and
[1:18:07] we don't we don't appreciate it
[1:18:10] i'm
[1:18:12] that's that's just that's just the truth
[1:18:14] people people don't don't know the
[1:18:16] the heartache
[1:18:18] with being being a minister being a
[1:18:20] pastor all the struggle
[1:18:22] and you know we we've had we've got one
[1:18:24] of the best
[1:18:25] in the world and
[1:18:27] i
[1:18:28] appreciate him and
[1:18:30] and we we don't
[1:18:33] sometimes sometimes we we don't we don't
[1:18:35] pay
[1:18:38] we just don't we just don't honor
[1:18:40] the position that and the man that we
[1:18:42] we've had that god's blessed us with but
[1:18:46] but he said he said he cried unto the
[1:18:48] lord all night then samuel rose early to
[1:18:50] meet saul in the morning
[1:18:52] and he told samuel
[1:18:55] saying saul came to carmel
[1:18:57] and behold he set him up a place and has
[1:19:00] gone about and passed on and gone down
[1:19:02] to gilgal
[1:19:05] and samuel came to saul and saul said
[1:19:07] unto him blessed be thou of the lord i
[1:19:10] have performed the commandment of the
[1:19:12] lord
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:18] when i read the what brother aram said
[1:19:20] about kyogle being a place of worship
[1:19:23] because you know when we begin to
[1:19:25] here in a minute you know then he says
[1:19:27] we have we've done the commandment of
[1:19:28] the lord
[1:19:31] then samuel came to saul and saul said
[1:19:33] unto him blessed be thou of the lord i
[1:19:36] performed the commandment of the lord
[1:19:37] and samuel said what meaneth then this
[1:19:40] bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and
[1:19:42] the lowing of the oxen which i hear
[1:19:46] uh
[1:19:48] saul uh we can't hear your testimony for
[1:19:51] your testimony
[1:19:54] your testimony's behind you
[1:19:57] and they're making all that noise back
[1:19:59] there that's that's your that's the
[1:20:00] testimony
[1:20:02] oh no we've done what the lord told us
[1:20:04] to do
[1:20:08] i i don't want to be in his shoes
[1:20:11] he said and saul said they have brought
[1:20:13] them from the amalekites
[1:20:17] now the the
[1:20:19] commission that was given to them the
[1:20:21] commandment that was given to them was
[1:20:23] to utterly destroy the amalekites
[1:20:26] don't bring anything back everything is
[1:20:28] utterly destroyed
[1:20:29] kill everything men women children
[1:20:33] everything that moves and breathes
[1:20:35] slay it
[1:20:37] burn it and get rid of it
[1:20:39] oh no we we've got a we got a better
[1:20:41] plan
[1:20:43] now look look he said for the people
[1:20:45] spared the best of the sheep
[1:20:48] and of the oxen
[1:20:50] to sacrifice unto the lord thy god
[1:20:53] and the rest we have utterly destroyed
[1:20:57] well god didn't want that
[1:21:02] god didn't didn't ask for that then
[1:21:04] samuel said unto saul stay and i will
[1:21:06] tell thee what the lord hath said to me
[1:21:08] this night and he said in him say on
[1:21:11] and samuel said when thou was little and
[1:21:13] not on sight
[1:21:15] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:21:17] of israel and the lord anointed thee to
[1:21:20] be the king over israel
[1:21:22] and the lord sent thee on a journey
[1:21:25] and said go and utterly destroy the
[1:21:27] sinners of the amalekites and fight
[1:21:28] against them until they be consumed
[1:21:31] wherefore did then this thou not obey
[1:21:34] the voice of the lord when this
[1:21:36] but did fly upon the spool and it's evil
[1:21:39] in the sight of the lord
[1:21:42] and saul said unto samuel yeah i have
[1:21:44] obeyed the voice of the lord and have
[1:21:46] gone
[1:21:48] have gone the way which the king sent me
[1:21:50] and have utterly destroyed and have
[1:21:52] brought
[1:21:53] which the lord sent me and have brought
[1:21:55] again the king of amalek and have
[1:21:58] utterly destroyed the amalekites
[1:22:01] well that's that's one of them that you
[1:22:02] didn't that you didn't kill you're
[1:22:04] supposed to destroy all of them
[1:22:06] see if you don't destroy all of it you
[1:22:07] ain't finished the job
[1:22:09] because that's the one that's going to
[1:22:10] be your problem
[1:22:12] but the king took this but the people
[1:22:14] took of the spool sheep and oxen chief
[1:22:16] of the things which should have been
[1:22:17] utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the
[1:22:19] lord thy god and gilgal
[1:22:21] see there's a sacrifice hey we got we're
[1:22:23] going to worship
[1:22:25] that's not the scripture tells us we
[1:22:27] we're supposed to worship in spirit
[1:22:29] and in truth
[1:22:32] follow the follow the word follow the
[1:22:34] truth of the word all the word and the
[1:22:36] samuel said hath the lord has great
[1:22:38] delight and burnt offerings and
[1:22:39] sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the
[1:22:42] lord behold to obey the is better than
[1:22:45] sacrifice and a hearken than the fat of
[1:22:46] rams for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:22:49] witchcraft and stubbornness is as the
[1:22:51] iniquity as iniquity and idolatry
[1:22:54] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:22:56] the lord he has also rejected thee from
[1:22:58] being king
[1:22:59] which is a repeat of what happened
[1:23:02] previously when he offered when they
[1:23:04] were fighting the philistines and he
[1:23:06] went in there and made a sacrifice and
[1:23:07] god rejected him and now he's now he
[1:23:09] went right back to the same place
[1:23:12] went right back to gilgal where samuel
[1:23:15] rebuked him previously
[1:23:18] as brother ernie villanueva would say
[1:23:20] somebody stuck in
[1:23:22] dumb
[1:23:24] stuck in stupid
[1:23:28] but he stuck there
[1:23:30] but you know he just couldn't he just
[1:23:31] couldn't get out of that
[1:23:33] i wouldn't i wasn't going to say that
[1:23:34] word but
[1:23:35] he said it but i
[1:23:37] i was
[1:23:38] not supposed to use that word i guess
[1:23:39] anyway
[1:23:40] uh sucking stupid but anyway um
[1:23:43] for rebellion is a sin as the sin of
[1:23:45] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:23:47] iniquity and idolatry because thou hast
[1:23:50] rejected the word of the lord he hath
[1:23:51] also rejected thee from being king and
[1:23:53] saul said and to say well i have sinned
[1:23:55] for i have transgressed the commandment
[1:23:57] of the lord and thy words because i
[1:23:59] feared the people
[1:24:00] and obeyed their voice
[1:24:02] now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin
[1:24:04] and turn again with me that i may
[1:24:06] worship the lord and samuel said unto
[1:24:08] saul
[1:24:11] i will not return with thee
[1:24:15] because see god had rejected saul so
[1:24:17] samuel was like listen i can't have
[1:24:19] anything else to do with you
[1:24:23] i can go so far but now you're done
[1:24:26] for thou hast rejected the word of the
[1:24:27] lord and the lord hath rejected thee
[1:24:29] from being king of israel and as samuel
[1:24:32] turned about to go he laid hold of the
[1:24:34] skirt of his mantle and it ran and
[1:24:36] samuel said unto him the lord hath rent
[1:24:38] the kingdom of israel from thee this day
[1:24:41] and hath given it unto a neighbor of
[1:24:43] thine that is better than they'll
[1:24:48] so
[1:24:48] samuel
[1:24:50] and saul here they come right back to
[1:24:52] gilgal
[1:24:54] where they had set up
[1:24:56] a memorial
[1:24:57] to come to the word
[1:24:59] god was god brought them this far
[1:25:01] god's going to bring you further
[1:25:03] but yeah you have to have as brother
[1:25:05] graham said you have to have a tie post
[1:25:08] this is this is this is this is this
[1:25:11] marker this landmark this memorial where
[1:25:13] you're coming to and this is where
[1:25:14] you're going to stay
[1:25:18] because you know when when when the
[1:25:19] scripture tells us don't move the don't
[1:25:21] move those landmarks
[1:25:24] don't move your neighbor's landmark why
[1:25:25] because that's his possession
[1:25:28] and and that's what god give him
[1:25:33] because if you
[1:25:35] move the landmark then you're then
[1:25:36] you're a thief
[1:25:38] you're taking what somebody's
[1:25:39] unbelievable because it belongs to
[1:25:40] somebody else
[1:25:42] but you know that's a boundary
[1:25:46] i think brother brother louise preached
[1:25:48] on that some time back to talking about
[1:25:50] having boundaries god set up a boundary
[1:25:52] well that's what those landmarks were
[1:25:54] for was a boundary where you're supposed
[1:25:55] to be
[1:25:58] and here is well i just hearken to i
[1:26:00] just heard you know i just hearken to
[1:26:01] the voice of the people because the
[1:26:03] people that's what they want to do they
[1:26:05] they want to worship god they want to
[1:26:07] offer sacrifices well you know what
[1:26:09] it didn't mean anything to god
[1:26:11] it was a stench in his nostrils
[1:26:14] because if you want to please god then
[1:26:17] you obey the word of god
[1:26:20] then you have faith in what he said
[1:26:22] because he said without faith it's
[1:26:23] impossible to please god
[1:26:25] so you take what god said and then
[1:26:27] that's what he was supposed to do he was
[1:26:29] supposed to go and follow what what they
[1:26:31] were supposed to do they were supposed
[1:26:33] to follow the word
[1:26:36] but they didn't
[1:26:40] and so when you when you come back to
[1:26:43] gilgal when they when they come to this
[1:26:45] place and they receive the word that
[1:26:47] they were supposed to come
[1:26:49] and follow
[1:26:51] now i'm gonna finish up here in a minute
[1:26:54] but
[1:26:54] uh i'm gonna try to
[1:26:57] do this a little a little quick tonight
[1:26:58] but you know there was another man that
[1:27:01] came to gilgal
[1:27:04] and
[1:27:05] there was a there was a prophet came and
[1:27:07] spoke to a man and told him to follow
[1:27:09] him
[1:27:11] and laid his mantle on him
[1:27:14] and that was elijah
[1:27:16] elijah came and they were at gilgal
[1:27:20] and he laid his mantle on elisha
[1:27:23] and he told him to come
[1:27:26] and when god called him when he called
[1:27:28] elisha
[1:27:30] elisha's in the field
[1:27:32] elisha's in the field and he's plowing
[1:27:36] well you know what he didn't he didn't
[1:27:38] sit and and make a lot of excuses well i
[1:27:40] should but you know he said uh pardon me
[1:27:43] just a minute
[1:27:44] and he went out there and killed some ox
[1:27:46] and then bowled it and and fed the
[1:27:47] people and he birthed the
[1:27:49] the uh yoke and everything like that and
[1:27:50] he was like okay let's go
[1:27:54] why because he wrote god call god called
[1:27:56] and the man of god has called him said
[1:27:58] you know what elisha didn't sit around
[1:27:59] and wait and him hauled nothing like he
[1:28:01] got rid of all of it i got nothing to go
[1:28:03] back to
[1:28:04] i burned i burned all that stuff behind
[1:28:06] me i got nothing else to go back to
[1:28:09] and so you know what he started he began
[1:28:11] to walk with with elijah
[1:28:15] and so as as we know that brother ram
[1:28:17] talks about you know he says that he
[1:28:19] began to walk with him and and and the
[1:28:22] message god called man you know brother
[1:28:24] i'm talking about him bringing him into
[1:28:27] training
[1:28:28] he wanted he wanted to bring the he
[1:28:30] wanted to train elisha
[1:28:32] and give him some training and then he
[1:28:34] continues on you can scroll up brother
[1:28:39] throw up there it is so
[1:28:42] save some of the the reading but you can
[1:28:44] read it later but um you know he he had
[1:28:47] this thing that he left all that and he
[1:28:49] came he said now god's god's got to give
[1:28:52] him some training he's he's been
[1:28:53] training him how to keep his eyes on the
[1:28:55] furrow with twelve yoke of ox and and
[1:28:58] one man playing with him he taught him
[1:29:00] some patience
[1:29:01] and how to be patient and train those ox
[1:29:04] to walk straight in the line and he had
[1:29:06] to train some men afterwards he said
[1:29:08] keep them on the bible on the word lined
[1:29:10] up with the word stay straight in the
[1:29:12] line and then even god had to school him
[1:29:15] a little bit he said now terry you hear
[1:29:18] and he said i got to go to guild all the
[1:29:20] lord has called me
[1:29:22] so
[1:29:23] elijah has been called
[1:29:26] but elisha says and the prophet after he
[1:29:29] had felt that power upon him in the robe
[1:29:31] of elijah he said as the lord liveth and
[1:29:33] your soul liveth
[1:29:35] he said i'll not leave you
[1:29:37] he said went on to gilgal which is the
[1:29:39] place of christian confession and
[1:29:41] baptism
[1:29:42] and then he said just stay right here
[1:29:45] this is good enough you've made
[1:29:46] confession in baptism this is good
[1:29:48] enough he said i'm going to bethel which
[1:29:50] means the house of god
[1:29:54] but you know then then he
[1:29:56] he said he was going beyond that and so
[1:29:58] when when he
[1:29:59] come to the place of the house of god
[1:30:01] and then he says no he said as your soul
[1:30:04] lived as the lord lives he said i'm
[1:30:05] gonna follow you
[1:30:07] so he goes to the next place
[1:30:10] and then he continues on from there and
[1:30:12] he goes to the in the next place and and
[1:30:14] what's so amazing is is when you when
[1:30:16] you see that when they cross over in
[1:30:18] joshua chapter five when the children of
[1:30:20] israel cross over they cross over jordan
[1:30:24] they're in the midst of gilgal
[1:30:26] and they feed the passover
[1:30:29] in the plains of jericho
[1:30:32] and when elisha is following elijah
[1:30:36] they're in gilgal
[1:30:40] which brother brown types is
[1:30:41] justification
[1:30:43] so they come to gilgal
[1:30:45] then he says he said but the lord has
[1:30:47] called me to jericho to where the
[1:30:49] prophets are where the school of the
[1:30:50] prophets are
[1:30:51] and he said he said has the thou so
[1:30:53] lived the lord's liveth he said he said
[1:30:55] i'm not staying here
[1:30:57] he said i'm going on
[1:30:59] he said you're going to jericho i'm
[1:31:00] going to jericho and so he follows him
[1:31:03] into jericho where the school of the
[1:31:05] prophets are and they prophesied to him
[1:31:07] he said do you not realize that your
[1:31:08] master is going to be taken from you
[1:31:11] he said well i know that but he said i'm
[1:31:13] still following him
[1:31:14] he said he said he said i've got a
[1:31:16] desire because god has laid his mantle
[1:31:18] upon me and he said he's called me to do
[1:31:20] something so i'm going to follow this
[1:31:22] and i'm going to continue
[1:31:24] and then when he comes to that place
[1:31:26] then then when
[1:31:27] elijah asked elisha he said he said what
[1:31:29] do you want from me what is it that you
[1:31:31] desire he said i want a double portion
[1:31:34] he said i've seen what you've done i've
[1:31:35] seen i've seen the power that you have
[1:31:37] he said i want a double portion
[1:31:40] he said i want he said i want what
[1:31:42] you've got he said i want he said it but
[1:31:45] i want a double portion of that
[1:31:47] he said you've asked a hard thing
[1:31:51] he said but if you see me when i go he
[1:31:53] said you'll receive that
[1:31:55] he had late he'd laid elijah had laid
[1:31:58] his mantle upon elisha in the field
[1:32:01] when he called him
[1:32:04] but you know what come back upon elisha
[1:32:07] when elijah left
[1:32:09] when they left jericho they went to the
[1:32:11] jordan
[1:32:13] they began to walk to the jordan
[1:32:16] and they took that and he smote the
[1:32:17] waters and they parted
[1:32:19] and then we crossed over then elijah
[1:32:21] left but what came back upon elisha
[1:32:25] was that mantle
[1:32:27] he received the mantle
[1:32:29] and brother around top he said it's a
[1:32:30] type of christ and the church as a type
[1:32:33] of of the of the bride receiving it
[1:32:37] and so you know
[1:32:39] when you when you see that how how this
[1:32:41] took place and then he received that
[1:32:42] then he crawled he smote the waters he
[1:32:44] said where is the lord where is the god
[1:32:45] of elijah and he crossed back over the
[1:32:47] waters
[1:32:48] and the people began to see that he said
[1:32:50] the spirit of elijah rest upon elisha
[1:32:54] they began to see what was taking place
[1:32:56] why because elijah was still in their
[1:32:58] midst the spirit of elijah had was
[1:33:00] resting upon him
[1:33:03] and so it's the same way with the bride
[1:33:05] when you when when you see what god has
[1:33:07] called you to
[1:33:09] it's it's up to you but you know you god
[1:33:11] called you
[1:33:14] in the beginning he he brought them over
[1:33:16] jordan he brought them through the
[1:33:17] wilderness and he brought them into the
[1:33:19] land
[1:33:20] which is a type of the baptism of the
[1:33:22] holy ghost the new birth they came in
[1:33:26] but here's elijah the bride in christ
[1:33:28] and here they are and they start rotting
[1:33:30] so you know when when they say well
[1:33:31] praise god you know
[1:33:32] you know you've got the new birth and
[1:33:34] that's it no that's the beginning of
[1:33:35] your next journey
[1:33:38] your journey ain't finished why because
[1:33:40] you're in gilgal
[1:33:43] and you know you're in the place of
[1:33:44] worship
[1:33:46] of instruction
[1:33:47] of rebuke
[1:33:49] each one of those things took place in
[1:33:51] google one because that's where god
[1:33:52] brought them to
[1:33:53] when you start hearing in justification
[1:33:56] so when when you've come into the new
[1:33:57] birth you've not left justification
[1:33:59] you've not finished
[1:34:00] that's where you're starting
[1:34:03] and then you come to jericho you're
[1:34:05] walking toward jordan
[1:34:08] to overcome
[1:34:10] and it's a continuation all the way
[1:34:12] through every step of the way
[1:34:15] and so here they are when they come so
[1:34:17] god is bringing you to that same place
[1:34:19] bringing you to overcoming
[1:34:22] and so you know
[1:34:24] how far how far
[1:34:26] will you go
[1:34:28] just like elisha
[1:34:30] i'm gonna follow you
[1:34:32] all the way
[1:34:34] he's calling you up the statue of a
[1:34:36] perfect man he said add to your faith
[1:34:38] virtue and divert you knowledge into
[1:34:41] knowledge temperance well if he's
[1:34:42] calling you to that then how far are you
[1:34:44] gonna how far are you going well i'm
[1:34:46] going to go all the way lord you call me
[1:34:48] then i'm going to continue to go i'm
[1:34:50] going to go down and continue to go one
[1:34:53] because i'm leading it and it takes us
[1:34:55] all the way back back to georgia all the
[1:34:57] way to jordan you got to cross over
[1:35:00] why because there's a death another
[1:35:02] death
[1:35:04] just just just as as in the beginning
[1:35:06] when you cross over and you there's been
[1:35:08] an overcoming and you've received the
[1:35:10] holy ghost but you know what then
[1:35:11] brother branham says you know when you
[1:35:12] come all this way he said you see you've
[1:35:14] not received the holy ghost
[1:35:17] why because there's another death that's
[1:35:19] going to take place
[1:35:21] why because
[1:35:22] i must decrease that he might increase
[1:35:25] well because there's another place one
[1:35:26] because it's not it's not just him
[1:35:29] speaking but he said he said the bride
[1:35:31] has got to come into rapturing
[1:35:33] conditions she's got to come into
[1:35:34] speaking condition so she's got to come
[1:35:36] back to that place that the mantle that
[1:35:38] was upon elijah will rest upon elisha
[1:35:41] the same spirit that anointed him
[1:35:43] anoints us
[1:35:45] we have the same ministry that he had
[1:35:48] she is him so when he comes back today
[1:35:51] that we have the same ministry that he
[1:35:53] has we come back to the same place then
[1:35:56] you know what if we realize that we
[1:35:57] continue to walk in this journey then
[1:36:00] our word is just as good as the father's
[1:36:03] because we are not speaking our own word
[1:36:05] but we begin to speak what he once spoke
[1:36:08] do we know what he wants done with the
[1:36:09] word that it's him speaking it's not i
[1:36:14] but it's him
[1:36:16] i only i do know what's of myself but
[1:36:19] what i see the father do with the son do
[1:36:22] it likewise
[1:36:23] till we see those taking place how far
[1:36:25] are you going to go
[1:36:27] you come to gilgal to a place of rebuke
[1:36:31] and a place of of sacrifice a place of
[1:36:33] worship that you come to god and god's
[1:36:36] showing you where he's brought you to
[1:36:38] and he's laid these foundations he's
[1:36:40] laid these memorials in your life he's
[1:36:41] shown you how far he's brought you to he
[1:36:44] lays a tie post down and told you you've
[1:36:46] come through justification you've come
[1:36:48] through sanctification
[1:36:49] and you've come to the you've come to an
[1:36:51] overcoming you've come into the land
[1:36:53] well then you know what then every time
[1:36:55] he said brother man said you can know
[1:36:57] where you are with god at any point in
[1:36:59] time he's going to show you the top host
[1:37:02] where you're tied to but how far you and
[1:37:04] i are going to plan on going we can go
[1:37:06] all the way
[1:37:07] however wherever you go i'm going also
[1:37:10] i'm not going to allow myself to be held
[1:37:13] back but i want to go as far as you lead
[1:37:15] me lord wherever you lead me to that's
[1:37:17] how far i'm going to go
[1:37:18] well because you promised the body
[1:37:20] changes there's somebody coming to a
[1:37:22] body james well then brothers and
[1:37:24] sisters that's what god has called us to
[1:37:25] then that's what he requires of us but
[1:37:27] he's made the way
[1:37:29] he's made the way all the way to a body
