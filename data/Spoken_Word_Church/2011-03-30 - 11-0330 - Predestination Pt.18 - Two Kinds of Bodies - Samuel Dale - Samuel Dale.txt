Paul says in all flesh is not the same flesh but there's one kind of a flesh of men Another Kind another flesh of Beast and another of fishes and another Birds now he's just explaining the natural thing right like I said I don't want to get into this this covers the resurrection of what kind of a body and things but I'm not dealing with that now so just stay with me of what we're doing look at verse 40. there there are also celestial bodies which is Heavenly and bodies terrestrial which is Earthly all right now but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star different from different from another in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is shown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and that's the point I want you to get now there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body all right now verse 40 says there are celestial bodies heavenly and they are you know spiritually and they are Earthly terrestrial bodies verse 45 tells you then where do we start from and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul Elijah Adam was made a quickening spirit all right now the first Adam we know who that is and the last Adam is Jesus Christ okay all right so then we'll we'll get back into that later but look in Genesis 1 26 and 27 and we'll read this and we're not going to get down into the total depth of this tonight we just want it's got something I want to get across to you all right so this be a point I want to make tonight of the message you'll be tying in with Sunday's message verse 26 says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sin over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all of the earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now as I said I'm not gonna I'm not trying to deal with anything of the resurrection and and we'll get into just touching some things of what you know of more into what we're trying to get to but I want you to to think tonight with me into tithe in with Sunday's message I wanted to continue on and this kept coming back so uh maybe we need to cover it more now the point I was trying to get across to us on Sunday afternoon it's trying to find out the real you what you really are now we know that we're Body Spirit soul all right we understand that we can read it but do we understand it do we understand which is the most real which part of you is the most real part of you all right we found out that the bodies now we're not going to get a new one but these bodies will one day be destroyed if we go by the grave and and do not take a change all right you know what I'm saying if we're not changing them old quickly when I were going by the grave so these bodies are going to be destroyed all right so we would want that to be the the part of us that would be uh the most important part not that one is greater than the other but still that way and and we know that it is not the spirit of mankind that would be uh you know the the most important part because uh that way we could get into anointed ones and uh we would be dealing on anointed ones as things and see that it would really give us a lot of trouble but we found out that the real center part of you are the most important poor part important part of us is the soul amen you're being right of what you are you're you're you know your your life you're what you're it's actually you and that's the most important thing that there is about us because we went through the scriptures covering it how it doesn't say the body that sinneth because the body can't sin all right the body only displays sin of what the rest is you hit a man over the head you put him out unconscious he can't sin all right then you you just take a spiritual part away from him and and and you know he he he's he's he's got a problem all right but uh the real you is that Soul all right that inward part of you and it's so important until that's the part that God begins to work on where Satan whereas took the the mind the head but God chose the heart the soul of mankind to be able to do his doings I was thinking there the other day you know it's a little bit said something about it this last Sunday was a I hope that everybody really understood what I'm saying because they say now you can learn a new language by sleeping so I guess this past Sunday I got my point across you get what is those you know you sleep through the service at least you know what I'm talking about so so you know all right but uh I'm just going to say that because that's you know we can learn a new language that way so maybe you got something all right but I understand and I I I'll sympathize with you and that's why I say contrary to everybody other preachers you know they'll say you not to do this not to do that um you know put a cough drop in or do something or you know some kind of a something if you don't do that put them in your mouth but now don't go to chewing gum don't don't get into the chewing gum business you know because that'll mess everything up you know but you know don't rattle the papers and and everything try to be as quiet as you can and this would just be human and do the best you can of trying to stay awake because I know on Sunday afternoon is a hard time for us and I understand that but I still like to have the the services all right but now as I said we were trying to explain something of the real you and no matter if it's even in a fallen estate you know even if if it's in just a fallen estate uh an unregenerated person you just think about how great that person is that they can you know that it's almost the Bible says that nothing would be refrained from them you know if he happened to cast them out they would have just went right on and just sweeping along and and what a man can imagine in his his mind he can pretty well come up with it right you know and make it because that's what's the difference between him and an animal because that animal just builds his nest the same does the same it adapts yes it has to but it has does not have the reasoning factor of the human being that comes with the soul all right now in that then with that behind us and thinking I said even just in the natural so I want you to kind of stay in that with me tonight that you know don't get over into uh the new birth as much as as we will Sunday the Lord willing and and all and even like reading 126 and 27 the purpose of reading that is to see that no matter what a man is whether he's lost or not he still is in the image of God and that was the point I was trying to get across you said oh no no he's just in the image of God when he's born again well now that's you know we are little creators uh you know we're we're people and we can can come up with a better way of doing things and and reason out the things that we need to to look at and see how to build something or anything like that you know and and all and but now keep that it'll say now keep that kind of down with me tonight don't don't go into the new birth as much we'll pick that up the Lord willing Sunday and uh continue on with it but I want you to think about what Paul is saying when he was explaining there that in First Corinthians 15 that their celestial bodies Heavenly you know and there's terrestrial bodies which is Earthly all right now then he goes on down to it explains the that about these that there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body okay now so then we know about the natural body right that's easy to comprehend the flesh we live in that's the Natural Body all right but there's also a spiritual body right right hey that's you right you know even in the condition of of where that we're unregenerated you still have that part of you that is more real than your body and your spirit because it's in the image of your maker right he's a Creator we're a little creator right all right and in doing that now Paul at least he's explaining that there's two bodies okay now there's heavenly bodies and there's Earthly bodies all right but I don't believe see he's talking about the resurrection and the things and I don't believe he's talking about an Earthly body here and a Heavenly Body up there all right right now I just don't believe that that's fine but what I think he's talking about because it's all right here amen the resurrection and everything is within you you know right so then what he's really explaining is is that there's two you you have two bodies right you so now wait a minute now if you want it here no no no you have a natural body I hear this the 16 elements all right now and then then within dire is a spiritual body right and no matter if you're you're lost now keep it with me on that so you're happy to understand even if you're lost me a lost person has a soul just like a born-again person has a soul amen right all right because that soul is what you are amen right all right and two see it will have to go somewhere when we die that part that is within us is going somewhere now the body goes back to the dust where it come from huh but inside of you is another body if you want to call it right so we have two bodies one is a natural body that we're living up on Earth come from the earth the other one is a spiritual body which is your soul amen which is your being which is what you are man all right now that comes from God as we read there the other day and and was bringing out on Ezekiel 18 4. that the Bible said All Souls are mine now if there's a soul any word God had to create it right because Satan can't create that's why that I I differ totally with people when they want to just say the soul is just the nature of the spirit I mean you're just you're just making it like it's nothing it's not Connection in in any form but I believe the soul is more real than your body amen amen because that's where we're going to live if you die right now before the change all right you're going somewhere work all right see Sarah or saying we have a place made for us amen and it can be called even to the center see it's called a celestial heavenly me being a part of you all right so then to understand who we are then you'll see where salvation takes place salvation don't take place in your body all right it's only this plane right it doesn't take place in your spirit right right that needs to be under control yeah right so if you can control the spirit Spirit and control the body everything will be under but the real control tower is the inside of you leave right now let's even show in the natural or the unregenerated right did that part of you and I and we'll get to it Sunday when the prophet will get more like sold in prison when he said if he can get that sold or stand still long enough right he said it'll die all right see because you that's the only place the new birth can take place in is the soul of the individual amen if it's in a spirit realm then it's it's just anointed ones that's right amen and all anointed ones would be the same because they'd have the Baptist with the Holy Ghost right the prophet said you know how the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit be and see and die and go to hell all right the real genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit thank you we'll see then when I'm trying to get us to think about is is how do you know whether you're saved or not come on Amen right how do you know well I want to go to church show this anointing month right I I I love God you love God with your spirit yeah that way we can find out what the New Birth really is amen and where it takes place then you'll see why that God had to come down yep that's right he to release the life that he had right because the anointing could come on him and go off of him right he did in the garden it came on him on the River Jordan went out off of him in the in the garden right but not the spirit part of him of life but that great anointing and that's why I can come back on anointed ones right all right people that are not Christians right amen because it's in that Realm all right but it can also come on you and I all right and we'll get back more of that that's what I'm trying to see uh I didn't I didn't think my point got across maybe to me all right and uh I hope some of you isn't over again where you can get what I was talking about anyhow and listen Paul says in verse 45 as it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul right all right now and the life Adam now that's Jesus Christ amen right amen it was made a quickening spirit right all right now he goes on to be specific and I don't want to get too much into it but he goes on into verse 45 and says how be it it was not the spirit that came first right spiritual it was a natural he said wait no way this way because you know he was see you're you're hooked on connection then as to what we'll get to in a minute that Adam was first the spirit name but that's not what Paul's explaining right Paul's explaining the first Adam and the second Adam all right I want to say that just in case you're going down to their reading and and thinking of the point see who came first right the natural atom came first then the spiritual atom which is Christ come into flesh to be able to die for you and I right see the first Adam was Adam the second Adam was Jesus Christ all right now so then that means that see the human being came first right because that would be where we would kind of into the sin and and have to be born again all right now but watch what I'm what I'm getting at now all is explaining that there is a spiritual body and there's a natural body huh right so now why is that spiritual body it would be the real you right all right and being the real you then it would be more real than the body you're living in right yep and see and that's where the the thing will have to come together I believe that one day this inward man it's hard to stay off from preaching on what you want to go on with but I got a point I want to get across but see the inward man is the one that's supposed to be of the controllers right right amen and that's your soul your being you know what you are that's right all right that's what's supposed to control you not be outwards me right the outward is controlled by just natural things of the world and operates according to that but in that inward being which is the soul of the individual and no matter what whether you're saved or lost that show had a an a connection back to God right amen because God made it right right now he never made he never made every so Eternal We'll get to that Sunday he only done that to Adam and bringing it forward and then Jesus Christ was eternal all right but in the the point of where we're you know the natural looking at it then it wouldn't matter whether you ever heard of God or not right that doesn't have anything to do with it that way it's the fact that by being a creation and being made in the image of our creator and having that god-like ability Creator ability Etc it makes us to where we're conscious of God all right why would he make totem poles it you know why would they make animals images why would they make this image or that image or or whatever you know it's because everybody has you know a person a human a soul amen all right really it doesn't have one that's what you are amen yeah do you just say has a soul and that means this you start trying to tack on this or that or the other or move something about don't it's really what you are right amen see no matter what whether you was raised in a Christian home whether you ever heard of God where you was born as a Hot Tot that never knows you're right or your left hand or whatever they're still of Consciousness part of us that wants the worship God right and I've told you over and over if even when I was a young person I would have never went out and done wrong you know yourself the first drink of liquor you took there was something said don't do it the first cigarette you smoke something said don't do it first time you went out and committed adultery something told you don't do it what was that right what was that that was the real you in a god-like condition I don't know how to say it because see you start talking like that people think you're somebody Eternal I'm not talking about eternal but around me and calls the sinner's Soul immortal Immortal I gave you the quote on them now Immortal to us means what eternal but what did it mean to him when he said that right you didn't mean the sinner's Soul was eternal what's he talking about it's in the image of God there's nothing that man can't do that the only thing he can't do is create yeah but he gets so close to that until he can make a grain of corn it looked just like a grain of corn that's right yeah and it tastes just like it it can have every bit of the same elements that the grain of corn had in it but you just can't plan it and get it to grow that's right but you see my point is I'm trying to get to you even in a fallen estate think back in your life think back in your life when you first done something smoke drink or something first time you started cussing you know cursing excuse me where they'll understand the language we use cut us in the South that's right I always told you I never did use vulgar words you know why I like my teeth I wanted to keep them I've seen a lot of people lose teeth on account of a bad word that's come out of their lips so I figured out one day the best thing to do it just not do that um I tried smoking cigarettes very little nice didn't like it right hot chewing tobacco and I've done pretty good for about a week night and all at once thank God one day I got so sick I couldn't stand it you know I never did chew anymore because I had enough common sense to realize that wasn't doing me no good yeah all people to get liquor come back beer and stuff set them out let them drink it he said we'll run it down you just by the way not ain't no difference the only thing you've done you overrode that first thing I told you not to do it right that's right you want to be honcho mucho big old guy and you want to go out and drink like everybody else and brother rattle had the same problem because when the little girl was handed me the cigarette he liked and smoked it and when they had the liquor out there he was gonna he'd like to a drunket but he didn't do it something spoke to him amen right now he said God dealt with him all of his life but you know he said one day he got born again right amen right yeah he said he can see God in everything that he ever saw you know that was when he was a sinner yep before he got born again and if we just realized it and look around us see the world and what it is today especially the technology as I was trying to save our Sunday to look at it now you can just take a telephone and you can call the other side of the world it's just a Split Second I mean I remember when they used to be that when I would make phone calls to some of these foreign countries and things even Jamaica they'd be a little pause in it you know it wouldn't have been a second or two but now you just they just pick up the phone it's just right there you know how to do that well they got all these wires that runs out across there yeah they got a great big old one they call it monofilament not the word for a great big wire you don't have no wires in it it's the way it's money and you know them phone calls just millions of them is going through them wires and they Crossing each other no how come we just don't get all mixed up and find some guy in China and start talking to him of course you will if you try to call Sears and Roebuck or something is that where they're at right come on you call Sears and robot you call the telephone company that's right right you want to report your telephone you call a power company some guy down in Florida answers the phone or somebody over China I don't know who I got it's just a power company well I thought I was talking to somebody near the states now I'm in China but I'll take care of it and they do now who could ever have thought about something like that being so real right I make a joke out of it because it but it's it's true isn't it it's almost a supernatural world that we're living in amen right I told you brother molting him I was in the end of World War II there in 45 right through there they were even setting in on how to decompose a human being send him to California and put him back together and they could decompose him but they couldn't get him back together that was for trouble the prophet of God said travel like a dollar that's right now what was it that went beyond the curtain of time with him right you look back and seeing his body wiggling laying there on the bed did his soul leave his body has to leave it to where there was no soul or no the supernatural element took place that a man could go beyond the curtain of time the soul but you know I remember when he went to hell and he wasn't born again all right you remember that you seen it's in the quote he said I've been in both places but the one when he went down was before he was born again I'm just saying folks do we really understand what it is to be a human mortal a being that is in the image of God and if it wasn't for God controlling us remote said they had two guys in the school they was in they're just you know we're dealing with the atom bomb and the things and all the different things he said they had to keep close check on those two guys he said God they blow the place up because they were again beginning to be smart about what they were doing what about now right what about to be able to take what's in my hand right here and light the world up because a man is a soul in the image of his God and I gave it to you there I have a few quotes you don't have to read all of them and just scan down and look at them but you see man his soul is a spiritual being it's a being is who you are it's the part of you that God's working on yeah if you look at it you'll see what I'm talking about do you see people that get into a religious Society and you see them start dressing better and doing better and quit doing all these things why but you do every bit of that and still be lost but you can do it because of that Soul that's within you in a contact with its maker begins to cry out that's the real you the only way you can ever get born again is to let that soul of you hear the word you see why it's so important the word be preached correctly how can you bring a new birth from what is not true like a man told me one time he said I took my wife to a Pentecostal Church to get a free in the spirit where she can get the Holy Ghost I'm offended in my own That Could my answer could I give that's your brother you mean to tell me a Pentecostal people which is a whole message behind but knowing more about getting the Holy Ghost to come home to an individual than somebody who is in the message without well you didn't like it but it was true you see you can get all worked up in a spiritual Realm and thank you all you're saved you're just love God and you just so great do you know you can do everybody that still belong right that's what I'm trying to tell you he said well it just sounds like you just don't know what you're talking about because you just jumping I'm trying my best to talk to you and me how do you know you're born again right I believe the prophet will sold us the devil and that way you got on him how many of you seen that was following the prophet and you know now they went by garbage cans around the world on these doctrines right but yet people that maybe even brought you into the message we're a day today do you know you're born again if you don't know what you are how can you know you're born to be if you don't know the difference between your spirit and your soul your problem he said but I love God so does the woman that takes her baby out and features to an alligator but you see what is it what is a soul do we could quote a lot from the prophet but what did you he starts talking all in in a message called question and answers and Genesis number one on your notes 53 729 . he's talking about let us make man that who father and son make man their own image people going haywire trying to figure that out because brother Ryan said it was father and son that's not two people the son was the father made manifest in another former but like I tried to preach back younger a long time ago why can't you see that there's a communication gap backwards in between all of these forms you remember that the father and son could talk about how to make a man and that's not two people it was word and spirit is that what your Prophet said word and spirit right coming alive look at it now if a man was made something like that little sacred lot younger or something like that it could not be seen which is a spiritual being he manifested or unfolded himself a little more to make a trinity of himself my father-son only spirit and here was God unfolded himself now down into let us make man which was his son in Offspring from him man in our image he was a supernatural being they don't even have to meet you know the cattles and the field and so forth you said well that Riverdale is only the borned again no it's not every man in the world has created in the image of God right right man or woman agree you're created in the image of God you see why it's so hard to try to preach to you to get it down to you because your mind will run up into something else just stay with me think about your soul and what you are look at the next one this is one we float a lot now I love it and I have for many many years is in the Hebrew Book 1957 8 28. look at the things he calls these this Park now the logos that went out of God which was the the Lord gosh all this began to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in Scholars teaching logos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was a what we call it theophany the acne is a human body that's glorified not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in this glorified State stage but is it is of a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but but it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now and there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make manner on image and our likeness and when Mandy came into that body he had control of the fish in the finals of beasts and all going down didn't look down at the department but the difference between explains a man and an animal they're between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he didn't put an animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany no there's only one eternal theophany we'll get back to that but a theophany simply means a in other words it's a bodily form all right we're gonna get down into it in a minute and we're going to read where the Prophet is talking about celestials and he's talking about Sinners even having a celestial and he calls the celestial the theophany the Lord gosh the soul so just stay with me down on the point of thinking about us natural see God put something into the man that he didn't put an animal right amen he put us over right I know sin entered the picture yes and it could come down to to where that man was lost yes but just remember it was the soul of God that had to come pay the ransom right the body could pay a price it was a covering because the body couldn't take away sin now come with the Natural Body of the Lord Jesus it was a soul that could pay the price that's when he had to come like he did Hebrews number three on he knows chapter 4. with God a man certainly let us make man their own image what was God a theophany a body and our man was made like that and put Over the Garden but there's no man to tell the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the earth like you know an animal I'm glad that theophy come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man listen no matter what you think about you're a person right you're a human you're immoral and that sold us within you is longing for God you put it in the pawn shop you remember that message years ago we blame the devil for putting us in the pawn shop you know we put our own Chef there we sold ourselves to sin you didn't have to do wrong right that's right I didn't drink you didn't have to drink huh why are you just said no just me I couldn't afford it mainly but you can always figure out a way to afford your habit you know afford your habits but you see if we just listen to our shoulder we never went into Rome we went yeah well we can't have it we're I'm going I know I know right we're in Satan's domain sure subject to that but we overrode the Fremont agency that God placed us to where we could make a choice don't blame Adam and Eve that's right well God made me this way now we've done been too much through too many sermons on that right God didn't make you wrong he made you perfect you make Eternal he gave you a perfect soul and a perfect spirit and put it in a body that comes from Mom and Daddy is perfect to that could be made right we reached an age of accountability and we went after that world and it's doing we didn't have to Quincy used to tell me when I come in the message they said well brother Dale what it is the new birth of see I was seeking the new birth they said but when you quit drinking you quit smoking you quit doing those things and I said well that must have been saved all the time because it didn't do it she didn't like that because it destroyed their Doctrine their doctrines was all you got to do is quit smoking drink and chewing that means you're saved I don't mean you're saved right right I mean the alcoholic and almost Anonymous has taken over wow cigarette or non Anonymous has taken over well we just can't see that's what you're saying you're still laying on that old thing that you can't help it right I'm trying to tell you kids you don't have to do wrong those other kids around you are doing wrong you don't have to do it right right well I'll be all right well just beyond amen I never had no trouble with it right they come to me and they talk about their drink I said just get out you leave me alone but they knew I meant it good so just get out of here and leave me alone I don't want to have nothing to do with the junk well if one person could do it another can you see that was not a Christian it was not that I was a Christian no that was before I even joined the Baptist Church I was 18 years old before I even joined a church period you know why because the church is what got in my way the people of the church is what got in my way of them telling me how much they love God and to not watch their lives and you that there was something keeping me from doing those things and they were going out doing it Mike White said they went to that place that time they had to go outside where they could take a smoke break in between the had to have a break in the service to go have a smoke break you see I didn't like it then I told people about it right people came to my house or me and my wife had been married and all they come there and asked me about coming to church I said listen I live a better life than your Deacon board does and but they didn't want me to get started on who was doing what because they knew I could tell them but I said I live a better life than you're a deacon board done and I'm lost you know why that was so because there was a moral obligation of a soul dwelling inside of an individual person when I was 11 years old I saw God in that church that didn't save me I just saw him and I knew he was real and by knowing it was real I wanted somebody to be able to do his jokes and take my hand in the hand of God and bring us together you couldn't do it but you see it was when I lost the things that happens to what most people call Christianity that happened to me when I was lost well you're just an an hour you just you know you like to brag I'm not bragging they don't break into it I'll take you down at home let you get out and walk the streets talk to anybody you want to and you'll find out what I told you is the truth the only time they ever threatened to whoop anybody was three of them at one time because they went off and told I was drunk I said get out here one at the time or all three of you don't make no difference to me because you ain't gonna go tell that because I don't do it was a conscience part of me I've tried to explain something to you I'm not bragging about a person like this I wouldn't have shared that's why I called myself the chief is the sinners why because I want that life of trying to be straight sure I had my problems but I found God that's all I've ever tried to get you to do this is just stop long enough to let God catch up with you but you're trying to be too spiritual right you're trying to save yourself and you can't do it realizing salvation is of God amen and accepted on that basis and said God Take Me As I Am and do something with me I don't want to do these other things you children you don't have to go out there and do those things amen in one day you'll find out that those Brothers around you that used to like and make fun of you they'll come and honor you for what you've done right when I see you really mean it 'll come to you when they need help but you understand I'm just trying to explain a human mortal that that human difference between you and an animal is that Soul that's within you amen amen the center part of you but see it was so deceiving in mankind until I told you it took the prophet now he would interlace it backwards and forth in the older parts of the message but up until 62 basically he taught it body Soul spirit but then when that word began to open unto him he saw it he taught his body spirit and soul but he had his senses correct he didn't have to go back and repreach it right he always give the outside the body five senses CJ still smelling here he always gave the second rim of man whether he called it Soul or Spirit right he gave him five senses memory reason conscience Etc but he said there's only one it's either Faith or doubt he's in the soul yep you're either born again or you're lost but just remember those demons that fail the prophet said they couldn't be like they caught you know in mankind that they press themselves into human flesh now I was looking at it today he said that can't be so because that would make him create orders but he said they can press themselves into you and pervert your nature and that's exactly what we've done we allowed it to take place I've never talked to a person yet that ever drank beer that ever liked the first taste of it have you none of you have ever told me you like beer in your first stages you always said you had to learn to taste of stuff why did you learn oh I want to be like the red that's that devil that's in demons precious and giving us those nature and perverting that soul making that Soul follower after his ways don't worry about it it's bad enough like it is do the best you can you never smoke you never drink you never chew you know don't worry about you're still lost but that's where the trouble is so you think you're saved you think you're saved because you quit doing something when I go to church and I love this message the devil will beat you here you hear a whole lot more than any of us he's not out there in that bar fly junk along there with a garbage can he don't even like it out there that's right drunks and vomiting and all the junk he don't like it out there he wants to come to church why because he was young the Americans Stood Beside the Lord he loves worship right right that's right he loves to hear good music he loves to sing and praise God because he was the anointed Church we think of him the big old guy with the horns you know he got another porch pitch for it you know if you're listening to the message now you watch what I'm saying I'm sorry just trying to get a point to you but see the devil follows you right I told her brother this years ago I said you got on one Doctrine and you went around and around brother and I said had you got off that doctor and went to other places and preached other things Satan couldn't have caught up with you and I said you went around and around on one Doctrine unless he got on the track with you and he caught up when he took you to the bed of adultery which he did he took him to the bed with a young girl his Doctrine took him to a bed with a young girl because he had a dream that he had a seed to plant his wife was already through menopause and he knew she couldn't plant it her it wouldn't do any good he taught I said brother can't you understand preaching the gospel is planting a seed you God was trying to tell you to preach the gospel he thought he was right he never did say he was wrong he never did I love the old man he was my friend but listen the devil get on that line with you you look where it's taken because that's what Satan does a man starts preaching a doctor and you watch him he stays on that one Doctrine Two Souls except another virtue proves him real Jordan whatever he gets on that one doctor and he just stays on it stays on it and stays on it and that's all you ever hear you showed me and one of them hadn't wound up in adultery yet not a name name so you go ahead tell me one it happened and all nine names it has because every one of them that was the founder of those doctrines as far as I know almost to the full 100 of every one of them wind up in adultery you know why because Satan got run on with him and made them enjoy it and have a good time oh wonderful Doctrine everybody was so happy it's glorious and going you know why because we're a soul of people your soul and China you've learned year yearns for God you got to convert it to the nature of following the devil in his ways it desires after God even in the Fallen estate you still don't want to do the things you do if you do there's something wrong with you you know better than to do the things but yet we're just going to do them anyway right but you see I'm not gonna get the message part so we just get on over you can flip over along in the message somewhere in there and you'll find out that run around and start talking about a theophany and he starts to start talking about a terrestrial a celestial because you have two bodies do you understand what I mean two bodies one of them is your natural body the other one is whatever is controlling you the prophet said it's either got an upward pull to it or a downward pool and he said you're naturally born with it going downward but it's still called a celestial a soul a pool According to which one we follow Jesus celestial a Heavenly Body look at number 10 there's nothing else on your nose questions and answers 1954. 103. an evening service you cannot be here a spiritual being a sinner or saint or Saint did everybody find it number 10. you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world if you're influenced from here you're from above so evidently let's have pointed upward or something your Celestial body is waiting up dark but if you're Wicked and hypocritical and different your Celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up there because the fruit that you buy before people proves where you're from so Center has a Celestial body right right what not an eternal theophany glorified condition no it's your soul it's your being Who You Are and it's the one that's controlling us one goes upward nothing goes downward because look where your Prophet tells it that you had to go look at entombment 57 420. number 11 on your nose and here he goes where did he leave when he left the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison now these are not born again Christians right I know what the Bible says it's called a spirit that was in prison but when your Prophet comes in he called it souls in prison and the angel of the Lord verified it beyond the curtain of time see what he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not into long-suffering of days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down let's follow him would you like would you like tonight to follow him a few minutes let's see where he went just below the regions of mortal being Blaze the realm of demon power below that just above that laser shoulder the unjust below it lays the very domain of Satan hell then just above us lays the Holy Spirit then under the altar lays The Souls of just men the next is God himself one going downward one going up where the two Spirits are here on Earth today influences the people of this Earth time which is which one's doing sold in prison 1963 11-10 he's talking about both places he said by the grace of God I say it not to be sacrilegious and if if it's wrong God forgive me I believe I've been in both places see in both places I've seen the redeemed and the blessed and I've seen the lost and where they were at and that's why I stand as your brother today to warn you to flee from that downward path don't you never go that road downward path both places what did he see when he went beyond the curtain of time we'll get to it Sunday the prophet the angel Lord referred to it as sold under the altar sold he didn't say Spirits so much amen sold under the altar is okay as long as you don't say how long how long to avenge our blood that's fifth seals you don't get it all tied up together Souls under the altar is wonderful because that's where we're going it's the soul that's redeemed page 49 in the future home he said their shoulders redeemed said we're waiting the Redemption of the body right shows he said I've been in both places he's talking about it the souls in prison did he preach to those Souls that were unsavable now what did Jesus go preach to when he went down Souls that were unsavable people that had died and went on right amen amen you were worthy they were in their soul their Celestial beings their soul now we're not just Spirits running around because they were Souls wrote around him even describes it to where did he seen the women coming up with their painted faces and their their new engineer clothes right so if there's something motivating you to change that and start making in and painting your face and things then you're going to realize that that's got to be a demon that's not the Holy Spirit or you've got warpaint on one because you're trying to okay but listen folks just get the point of what I'm trying to say being a human being makes us want to serve God don't get that confused with the fact of the new birth brother Dan what was you any different when you received the Holy Ghost not a thing in the world out here I didn't have to quit anything I'd already quit I didn't know how to start lying and cheating I did not cheat I didn't have to quit committing adultery because I quit all that junk I didn't have to quit drinking I didn't have to quit smoking I didn't quit all that while I was a sinner right but you see I know I would not saying because when I heard this Prophet talking about my brother Mo started talking to me I thought I had it yeah but when I heard this Prophet began to describe a human mortal and what he was how did he even wanted to serve God right I would long in his heart David crying out my soul purses after thee oh God but there's no Holy Ghost to be able to get in right but his soul cursed it he didn't want to do wrong the prophet of God says on his way home from the bed with Bathsheba he cried out return unto me the joy of thy salvation amen from God loved David because David had a shoulder that he could deal with David realized God had chose him to be king he was right there in that to walk as much as he could but yet he made a lot of mistakes but yet he called his own judgment when Nathan come to him and told him you know about the story David said and killed a man he said David you're the man he said but you won't die because God has told me you won't it was supposed to be in death to David it didn't matter for him being king or whether he's high priest or who he was adultery was adultery but he said David the son that you bore will not live it will be removed from you it was go back in the Old Testament and read those prophets and how they desired God do that just just read some go read the psalmist I love to read the song If you ever get down and out read the song man look at job don't worry the Book of Job and see how wonderful and he called out to God he desired God and he wanted to walk in a straight life it was never said that job had anything wrong with him right right they accused him of being a secret Center but they couldn't bring out the secrets right right right because there was no secrets he said in other words exposed me and show me what I am tell me where I've done it I made this sacrifice that he said for me to do go back there and study Those Old Testament prophets and those people and how they longed after God that's right now they spent their life trying to serve a God but yet never had that God dwelling within them to a man like Moses it could have been ruler of Egypt and that's all he had to do was remain where he was and take over right he would have been the ruler of Egypt because he already was the yeti sacrificed all of that to try to find what was dealing with him in his heart think about man can't you think about when he was a child and how he was doing and how that something was trying to guide you and take care of you because it was that being of you pet body them people in hell would lend a body he said well what did they look like brother they'll see that's where we want to go to all that junk forgive me for calling junk when I call it like that but you see when you start talking well what kind of a body was that in was it old or was it Young why does it matter the only thing I know brother Ryan said if Santa will stand and be judged in the body he's sinned in and I personally tell you I don't believe he's going to be raised 18 years old now that's my personal opinion you can't find where the Prophet ever said if that's mine because why would God raise him in an 18 year old body and then destroy it now they'll come up in the body they see and then and they'll be old and dilapidated and gone why because they're going to the garbage can right but you see Jesus went to hell and preached to people what God's bodies and people said what help would it matter what you could find out in the 18 elements that are instead of 16 here you know what I'm talking about forget that get out of innovation it's true God had to go to hell and preach to those Souls that was in prison you know what he preached to him they had to be able to hear man right they were their in their Celestial form their soul their being their body their natural bodies decayed upon the world and all of that yeah they were living dark in a torment brother round said it was a constant falling he said there was no burning when the fire burning he said that has been a pleasure you see what I'm talking about see inside of you right now is one way or the other right there is either a body that's taking you upward or there is a body that's taking you downward that body is your soul that's what's going to live after this body is destroyed somewhere if it's lost it'll be in the Realms of the Lost if it's saved it'll be in glory that's right but what are we what if man the Dark Minds will love him remember something right see we only want to go to the next part or the son of man see we want to jump over to something else we want to try to become spiritual how can you find out how you're saved if you don't know what you are right that's right how can you know whether you're saved or not if you don't know what you are that's right all right it'd be a good thing to just go home and sit down and look in the mirror and say God what am I I faked this thing long enough trying to make this that and the other come and speak to me right tell me where I am right but you see that's what people has done on a lot of bases and they come out of it saying oh I love God so I must be right you love with your spirit that's right that's the second round all right your soul is either Faith or doubt do you understand what I'm getting now do we really know what we are and do you really know whether you're born again or not that's right or we like the badges bless God you can't tell me and I've talked to people who said that you can't tell me I ain't saved I believe this prophet's message and I love the prophet's family and he said everybody that loved his family is going to be there but I'm gonna be there because I love his family get into a lot of things yeah like the people of this message you've always got me do you know that there was plenty of people believe brother random was God while he was here while he was traveling about the country to preach and you know they bought the cheapest tape recorders and all kind of things that could be brought don't tell me that junk if I to believe brother Branham was God if I believe brother dick was God every move he made I'd have the best that the world could be I had a big bar and steel to get everything I could get to make him to where that he even whispered and wanted something he didn't have it and I'd have the best Machinery in the world to take pictures of him and keep record of him if I believed him to be God and a brother named Lawrence one time had happened to have a battery-powered tape recorder the old 7 8 reel and out of all of their equipment they had they couldn't get nothing to work and I used to know the message that it was on but he was the only one that got a copy of that message that day do you understand what I mean if I believe today that brother Brown was almighty God what would it matter to me whether I said bag barred or stole I'd have a copy of brother Brown's message in every person's hand in the world if I believed he was God don't you see we make a lot of garbage cans out of our mouth don't be bad big words right of course he winds up like it did with that you know a lot of them believed he was God until he passed away when he passed away they got him another one so they made jewels of God in other words where God passed away so I had to give him another God oh we love it we just love it do you know whether you're saved or no that's it on what basis do you put your salvation I've walked 40 something years in this message so don't talk to me about that when you just love the people that brought us into this message are no longer here it's not because they're dead a lot of them ain't you know that's true see what is man the dark mindfulness why did God choose you and I as I was trying to get across Sunday what do you choose us for that's right the monkeys would have been better home the monkeys would have served him a whole lot better no he chose us he may have seen his life it's his end and even in a fallen estate we're creators amen even just as a moral human being we're it's there's nothing can be withholden from us and what we can actually do right amen he's reading not too long ago about just troops they've got now that can run 24 hours a day they're so trained until they're almost totally inhuman you see I read also of an old Indian years ago was eat up with arthritis need to run 15 miles a day and they could never capture him we make fun of these people like that of the Indians worshiping a a God or something and a lot of those old one like a Geronimo on them had visions and things why they couldn't capture Cochise and those men a lot of them was more in contact with God than all of those the super religious people that we think we are thank God for the truth come on thank God for the truth do you know you're saved what do you put it on amen you better be able to put it on something right what about it what is man the dark mindful loving what do you think about it you have two bodies one natural here on Earth and you've got a spiritual one inside of you that is going to take you somewhere it's going to take you down or it's going to take you up it's According to which one to pull this from and what that's working on and that's your soul that's the real you go back in there and read as I said those Old Testament prophets like David my soul curses I should be yeah along and within his heart until they expend all of the money they had and all the wealth they could gain and the gold and the things to build a great Temple for God to come down in because they cherished well we got here 97 97. boy Jesus got satisfy you so you might have a need the world will try to shine outside response flying drops or whatever you want you here communities lady rolled down to the base of her died but all of them things started breaking up and you said she realized she had lost she started screaming to tell him too lost and used to see me and you know what the preacher said give her another hypo to shatter up run and they quietened that soul of that individual that was crying you can go all your life trying to figure out whether you're saved or not there's a blessed time let's call his face yourself soon amen remember we just place you're on sale that's coming coming soon tonight we shall we shall see the king we dream again Hallelujah God is concerned about the Deidre how about people games location foreign we shall see the king you break one heart we shall see true
