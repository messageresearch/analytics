that's good enough for me happy Mother's Day happy Mother's Day to each and every one of you um brother Joe was talking about what brother Brown said and if those of you that was on WhatsApp know the Brother Anderson sent us a quote where brother Brown says before gospels Matthew Martin Luther and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother but remember she gets you before the gospels do she gets them before Matthew Martin Luke and John's teaching gets them so you got to get them started right amen a good Godly wife good Godly mother a sister in the Lord whether you've had children or not you've impacted somebody's life in being a mother because we can't be mothers we cannot do that so happy Mother's Day and and when we get ready to leave today uh there'll be gifts a gift cards as you leave to all the sisters above the age of 18. all right we're gonna have to kind of a cut off time because that's kind of married marrying age or adult age so 18 and above we have a little gift card for you and uh and a a signed card saying how much we appreciate you as a church right we appreciate every one of you coming I want to read this uh June sent it to me and I want to read it to you it's kind of fitting if you don't mind we got time today we're good all right listen to this I never thought about this but this didn't come from no message believer either what God communes with men in the mountains but not women man has always been commissioned go up on the mountain go up on a mountain I'll talk to you go up on the mountain he never commissioned a woman to go up on the mountain but who was the first person to see Jesus after he was resurrected so this lady wrote now listen to this have you ever noticed how the scripture in the scripture men always go up in the mountain to commune with God yet in the scriptures we hardly ever hear of women going to the mountain and we know why right because women were too busy keeping life going they couldn't abandon babies meals homes fires Gardens and a thousand responsibilities to make that climb into the mountain think about it God comes to the women I was complaining about this to a friend the other day saying that even as a modern woman I feel like I'm never free enough for my from my responsibilities never in a never in a quiet enough or holy enough spot to have that type of communion talking about going up the mountain that I want with God her response floored me she said that's why God comes to women men have to climb a mountain to see God but God comes to women wherever they are I have been pondering on her words for weeks and have searched my scriptures to see what shed was true God does indeed come to women where they are when they are doing their ordinary everyday work remember Mary Mark the different ones he meets him at the well they draw water for their families in their homes in their kitchens and in their Gardens he comes to them as they sit beside sick beds as they give birth care for the elderly and perform necessary mornings and burial rituals even the woman at the empty women at the empty tomb who were the first to witness Christ's Resurrection were only there because they were doing their womenly chore they didn't come there to see Jesus they came to what anoint him they came to do their job their Duty and he met him doing their Duty the chore of properly preparing Christ's body for burial and this seemingly mundane and ordinary task those women found themselves face to face with divinity so if you like me this woman writing it if you ever start to bemoan the fact that you don't have as much time to spend in the mountains with God as you would like remember God comes to you he knows where you are and the burdens that you carry he's he sees you and if we open our eyes and our hearts we will see him even in the most ordinary place and in the most ordinary things praise God this lady's name is Heather Farrell if you want to look her up that was quite profound to hear that from a sister's perspective and sometimes we get all you think you get wrapped up in things it's kind of like Mary and Martha you know they kind of got you know they got a little argument there the Lord you know I'm doing the cleaning and why ain't this one doing he said okay just hang on a minute she's doing her job you're doing yours in other words it made the tables may turn so same way with all of us sometimes we think we don't get to commune with God because we're we run downstairs and have to get the food ready and and like last night we got we had pizza and thanks everybody for coming to bible study it's not Bible studying it was questions and answers all right and we had a real good time real good time in the prayer service and we appreciate y'all coming and um and being a part of it I remember brother Louise is it in Florida today hey brother Stan prices they had a Minister's meeting so he met some people that come from Arizona or somewhere I think remember today we only have one service then we're going to have a baptism service we're going to baptize brother Luke and if anybody else wants to be baptized the water is warm and we will be able to do that as soon as the service is over we'll just continue on down there all right brother Bob will be speaking for us this Wednesday night he preached my sermon again today I like that that's the way I I don't it doesn't bother me that's the way God works you know I didn't call him he didn't call me to ask the subject was preaching on today but uh the Lord lay something on my heart last night about deity and we're going to talk about deity because that has everything to do with a statue of perfect man on the 20th which is next Saturday we have our youth service everybody's invited it's a regular service but it will be for the Youth we're expecting a good many people to come if anybody wants to open their home they can open their home and say I can you know I can take care of a few we got some coming from Macon and brother Robbie says he's probably going to try to get here and with his family and I told him we'd try to find him a place to stay so um I'll be coordinating that with all of y'all during the week and we're going to have a taco bar so I want these sisters to get with sister June and see about what you want to bring everybody knows what a taco bar is it's a it's a it's just it's got all the condiments and you make your own tacos you just walk up make your own not a walking taco like we had in Ohio it'd be a little too messy we'll just keep it as a taco bar so get with sister June and and that will be what we'll have next Saturday will start at three o'clock until and then next Sunday we'll only have one service brother William borlavon will be with us for both services also remember tomorrow I'm having five teeth pulled at one time and a partial put in so just remember me um in prayer that those things will come out they come out already so some of them have some we pray that the other ones just slip right on out all right remember now June the 17th that's next month but I want to announce it because I want to tell you something June the 17th we're going to go fishing at the pond at Terrance and Zach's and have hamburgers and hot dogs or low country boil we'll have something for the men and their and their children uh boys it'll be for the boys only but I talked to brother Andre yesterday we were going to try to go up there that weekend but they have something already planned so brother Andre's always wanted us to get together as two churches and and put a meeting together so I want to propose to you these two dates because in July last year remember about 50 of us went to Ohio so I proposed that we go to brother Andres that weekend that will be in Irwin Tennessee most of you know that because most of you has been there our ministers have ministered there we were there when we were kids but July either the weekend of July which will be Friday Saturday and Sunday July 14th 15th 16th or July 21st 22nd 23rd we'll have a church service on Saturday night one of our brothers will be speaking and then we'll decide Sunday morning he'll speak there but we would love for all of you to come uh we for everybody this is for everyone to go if you would like to do that I don't think we'll get Transportation but it's only three and a half hours so uh we'll pay you gas money or something to get you there or we're all carpool but just keep that that's in July so just be thinking about we brother Andre um suggested we do it then and and we don't have a July service for the Youth so the third Saturday in July will be the 15th all right but he's going to check with his they have a small group and we're going to have to pitch in and help just kind of like we did in Ohio we pitch in and help them a little bit but not not much we'll be okay but there's fishing uh there's um hiking there's mountains there there's Rivers there's a lot of things you can do kayaking canoeing and stuff if we'll get all that together if you'd like to go so weekend of July 14 15 16 or 21 22 23 you let me know either one or one or the other and Hey Brother um Andre will ask his group today and then he's going to call me either tonight or tomorrow all right so and we're going to invite brother Richard Wilson and his church to come too and uh we'll just try to have a good time in the Lord all right so all mine's clear happy Mother's Day again gifts in the back when you walk out the door see brother Terence the tall guy in the back he will give you a gift card now if you got a gift card and you don't like because there's several different things it's gas food coals belts and Target so you know you all have a y'all have a swap meet downstairs after we have the baptism y'all can have a swap meet and say well I don't ever go to Kohl's well I do so let's they're all 25 a piece so no one's gonna get cheated on anything so but we do have gas eats and a place to go buy stuff so just uh we appreciate um anything that the church does all this it's it's um it's something that we want to do for the mothers amen so let's give yourself another hand again this is not bad we got uh we got time to do things but we got one service so we're going to preach just a little while like I said before last night I was thinking about something and and the the word deity and we'll weave it into the statue of perfect man in just a few minutes so let's bow our heads I know we all have needs we all have things that's going on in our life remember brother Louise as he comes back home today and all the ones that are traveling oh good to have brother Aaron and his family back and it's always you know Bob and all them are going it's always a piece of the piece of the body's gone and we're glad when they get back hey man dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this day that you've given us It's A Mother's Day and Lord as you said through your prophet their sets or stands The Fifth Gospel something that will we as men can't be mothers we can't mother a child like a mother can a mother can can enter into things and and emotions and feelings that we as men can't and they enter in Lord as each other as the scripture says the Elder will teach the younger and father we pray that that you'll keep our elder sister strong so that they can teach the younger ones how to do the different things as we was talking about doing sowing and cooking and stuff like that of life but even in scripture and in shining their light to each one father just be with us now and further in this service we thank you for all things we thank you for the church that we can go to a a building with people in it because without the people here today we couldn't have a meeting but father they all brought their little lick of fire and now we're going to put them all together and we're going to hear from you Lord I pray that you would take over this service and you'd be the active participant you'll be the one that does the speaking and the hearing please reveal yourself to us today Lord let us grow stronger and better and higher and closer to you forgive us of our sins Lord we all had we all raised our hands there was a need behind each one Lord I pray that you'd meet each one of those needs father in the name of Jesus we ask amen all right let's read and you'll be seated in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth II Peter 1 says besides this wait a minute I'll get you I forgot to uh make it go up here oh there we go hold on hold on that better okay let's go a little bit more than that have that okay for the ones in the back all right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father what full of grace and Truth II Peter 1. it says then besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and the knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and Godless brother kindness the brother kindness charity look at that scripture back in verse 5 because it's going to be important once we get a little bit further along in the pyramid teaching it's not a pyramid teaching it's teaching on the Statue of perfect man using the pyramid as a graph all right it says add to your faith so as we said many many times before faith is not an ad it's a birth all right faith is not an ad it's a birth because when we get to this brotherly kindness you're going to see that that it can't be that there's that that faith is an ad it's add to your faith so you're taking your faith and you're adding something to it and then we're going to look up at the top of the pyramid where it says Holy Spirit and we're going to see that there's an interval the time to just stop and relax and calm down and we'll look at that as we continue on you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading the word good to have each and every one of you here we got a full house today First Timothy 3 verse 16 says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness that's what we're going to talk about today we've got through we've got through virtue knowledge Temperance patience we're at godliness all right godliness and we'll read that and I want to that's where we're going to weave in I want you to see who you already are not who you're going to be then I want you to see who you're going to be they're by with me I want you got to see who you are first to understand what you're going to be all right and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit saint of angels preached into the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory and that word controversy is without Strife without dispute without quarrel so there's no quarreling about what's going on today it's what we're speaking if we speak the word of God there should be no quarreling we should know the Plan of Redemption for those of you that are new that are not um they've not been here we believe that God had a plan and a purpose and he was going to see it achieved through a group of people not through himself because he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer and to do that he had to make us all right as we were talking last night one of the questions was was Adam the son of man and no Adam was not the son of man Adam couldn't be the son of man because the son of man was some a a person that I just read that came in human flesh through birth Adam didn't come through human flesh and birth he came through human flesh by creation so he can't be your Kinfolk can't be your brother sure he's part of the human race the beginning but he was not your savior he couldn't save anybody couldn't even save yourself but the son of man came to what seek and save those who are lost so he couldn't be the son of man but he was the son of God amen so that's the plan of redemption and we go through and we know that we know as as Christians especially in this church we believe in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we were talking about that a little bit last night because there is a question in people's mind am I really born again is this really happening am I am I a child of God all right and what stage am I in in my journey well you just gotta listen you gotta go to school amen you gotta go school you got to find out you got to talk to God let him talk to you through what through a minister through uh listen to the tapes through through reading through all the different things that and praying amen amen I told him last night we got finished praying and went back went downstairs and I told him I said I don't know what you prayed about but I said for 45 minutes I was asking God to forgive me of the things I've done sorry I was a little selfish last night I prayed for y'all too for a little bit but I prayed because I'm going through some battle all right and I want God to help me all right I don't want to be selfish about it but I do want to slip in there just a little bit and say hey here am I Lord you know we don't holler loud enough I guess but the Plan of Redemption is justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost that puts you in the body of Christ that gives you the new birth or it gives you that faith what the faith of God and I'll and I'll show you a little bit a little bit um well in just a few minutes how that all works Romans 8 verse 29 says for whom he did for no I got a number one by that whom he did 4-0 as we were talking about last night we'll keep referring back if you all have been here last night all of you I wouldn't have to refer back like not so anyway I know you can't be here every time but that's okay but we had a good time last night we learned a lot but he foreign you he knew everything there's not one time God has ever been deceived or something happened that he didn't know we were talking about babies going to heaven and and you know what if you're gonna uh two born-again Believers and you got a little baby and you go into raptures the baby gets stuck here and the other baby goes somewhere now listen the baby's not bright you've got to be specific the baby can't be bride bride is born again right but God's not gonna leave him here apparently hey buddy good to see you man both of you both of y'all back here good to see you so whom he did who God's only one that can for no God the only one who can tell the end from the beginning as you were talking about last night I'm sorry I'm going to slow down a little bit eight billion people throw a piece of paper at me or something if I get too fast Brother Anderson is interpreting so we'll slow down just a little bit I asked you mother day I said you say everything I said he said he has to interpolate and that's okay that's all right Paul Paul priest sermons and um did y'all see that on Facebook the other day where where somebody wrote and said if Paul was here in the United States today we get a letter because remember we go the Corinthians and they got a letter they went to the Thessalonians they got a letter he went to the Romans they got a letter you know they all got a letter we'd get a letter if he was in America today so seven billion people at this moment now there is eight billion people in the world eight billion people God knows every thought they're thinking and going to think their whole term of Life on this Earth one man amen so why are we going to worry about well I just don't know if God can do this and I don't want to worry God he's never run out of memory all right he's the greatest computer that ever was there is no time when you say too full so he foreknew every bit of this every situation you went through going through or will go through he already knows it but remember he's not going to make you do it he's going to see you do it and see you make a choice because you do have a choice remember I told you about the brother the other day and I was watching him online and I just I couldn't believe that a message preacher would look you in the face and tell you you don't have a choice I'm sorry that's not Bible That's not the prophet's message you have a choice you were born with a choice you are a free moral agent until the day you pass away that gives you a god-like quality to choose or reject amen that puts you in a Godlike quality but he saw the choice you'd make he foreknew you therefore he could predetermine because predestinate is predetermined but he didn't predetermine see if if it's like the brother said that we just don't have a choice then it is exactly what brother Brown said God didn't do is put you in a tube and say all right this is where you're going to go no I Like It where where God knows he's so infinite he knows that if that if Monica and Bob would have never married he knows who Bob would have married and what kids they would have that's an infinite God we're finite we we we funnel him down he's not funneled down he's a God that knows everything but he did predetermine that he was going to have a bride yes he was going to have somebody conformed in His image he made sure that as we were talking about last night in Genesis 1 26. he made sure he was going to make someone in His image and in his lightness and they were going to have dominion over the Earth and they were going to multiply and replenish the Earth they were going to do what God Said now listen they did what God Said but they didn't do all what God Said God said multiplying replenish the Earth and never put him in flesh he meant spiritual multiplication Satan said oh I can get into human I can get into human race if I'll just tell them to do this because the animals are reproducing and all these other you know the Beast was reproducing come on somebody that's what he used brother Brown said to you the principles of life and that's the way he could get in was to get in Eve's womb of her mind first and then the act happened there is no way except for rape and drugging and all that there's no way for a for any of us to do what we do without thinking about it first well pray for me but he predestinated someone to be conformed so in Genesis 1 he said let us make man our own image and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea in the foul there and everything that creeps on there the creeps on the Earth so he made a man which was a spirit man first but he didn't want Spirit man he wanted a man in flesh so that's what he did in Genesis 2 7 he took that 126 man put it in the 2-7 man which was as brother Brown says a man standing in the garden with roots like his feet and then here's a man 16 elements of the Earth amen and then he could commune with that man but remember as we were talking about last weekend well we've got a lot of comments about our vowel renewal last weekend I think we probably won't wait as long to do it again that won't wait 15 years I hope we're not here for 15 years more praise the Lord anyhow sorry about that but I hope we're not brother boy to be like hey a hundred and something years old 85 95 okay and Joyce will be as old as you anyway so don't matter it's what Terrence said I'm just telling you what brother I'm saying but we but in devour news you you look and you see that that man God was lonely so he made man so man comes on the earth he commends with God but there's something inside of him there's a desire there's a desire for him to have Fellowship listen with his self he desired to have fellowship with God sure God would come down they would walk on cool today but there was something inside of Adam they said I need to get out to be able to communicate with whatever this is inside of me isn't that what happened So Adam he lays Adam down takes a rib forms a body for Eve out of that rib out of that 16 elements of the earth and then he puts pardon that Genesis 1 26 the female part he puts it into who not Eve woman R Adam their name was Adam before the fall all right she wasn't Eve to laughter the fall happens everybody with me so you see the same way you and I don't have a name we're we're human beings we're all these different things but until you're born again you don't have a name like the name that you're going to get when you get born again amen but he made a group of people to be conformed to His Image so somebody's going to be that because listen that's his desire yes his desire was to communicate with Adam and then Eve and then all that got broke but he said I'll put enmity in other words as we're going to see here in just a little bit he had to come back in flesh himself and become deity engulfed by flesh and by with me I know y'all patient yourself because you're not amen and now so maybe another two hours from now you'll be amen praise the Lord moreover whom he don't groan moreover whom he did what predestinate then he also called all right so one he foreknew what you would do two he then made an earth put you on the earth predetermined what you was going to do buy your free moral agency by your choice then he called you mean your call but if you're chosen already called everybody see that's where people the message are so narrow-minded well they just called us because we had this great seed in us and that's what caught God calls every person because he's a righteous judge and God's going to tell you the day the hour and the minute that he come to you and said be my child and You're Gonna Know It and you're gonna walk away with your head down and you're going to hell sorry like we said last night there's not a black white dog you either got the seal it we're talking about the Seal of God and the sit in the mark of the beast because another question was what would the market be well the mark of the beast is being void of the mark of God or the Seal of God if you're sealed in God you can't get the mark of the beef praise Lord you can't be you can be deceived but you can't be taken that's right when he seals that boxcar it sealed until the day of your Redemption you're sealed in Satan's sealed out come on somebody deity is inside of you God has locked the door not you no I didn't shut the door of the Ark God shut the door of the Ark amen everybody with me now wake up a little bit we'll say Amen I'll help you pace yourself okay I'm the one doing the work up here y'all help me all right so he called whom he called he justified so if he called you and you said I want more of you I can't stand I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired I don't want no more of this as we were talking about last night why would you want your former life if you're a former life is better than the life you got now you don't have what you think you got can I say that one more time you don't have what you think you got if you want pieces of your former life I'm trying to get it out where I never remember a speck of it praise the Lord be called then be justified he did it and whom he justified wow he'd give you a glorified body because he's the one that's going to have to give it to you a glorified body sister I asked last night said brother Brown says no Divine Healing no Resurrection she wanted us to explain me to explain that well look at it do you know today as we speak today up in Gainesville Hospital biggest Hospital in the in the area there's probably several thousand people in that hospital in different stages of hurting and dying but God has sent a healing angel the doctors came they set an alarm but they can't make the bones grow back together they can perform open heart surgery but they can't start that heart back up oh yeah they do the paddle and all that stuff but God's in control and then they can sew you up and you'll never heal unless God heals you so God is healing people that don't even want don't even care about him he's healing me and you if you're 98.6 degrees right now you're being healed as we said last night I read in a paper the other day that you you lose every 10 years you lose after you get like 40 you lose 10 of your muscle mass no way to get rid of that because that's the curse but you can help it and do something about it you can put not put so much put fat around it well praise the Lord anyway I thought I'd bring that out but listen it's healing us right now so no the Divine Healing of God away from that hospital every person in that hospital will die within just a few moments you lose oxygen you lose the firing mechanism that's that's pumping your I we were talking about last night brother Dale's 83 years old he's 83 years old think about that in 365 days then think about how his heart has beat 74 to 80 well with y'all him preaching y'all maybe a hundred a hundred beats per minute from the time of being a baby till now who did that baby God did that oh no my body your soul yeah your soul is your fire mechanism but who made your soul who keeps your soul inside your body the healing angel of God yes sorry to get off of that but that's what's going to be our glorified body is going to be that we don't deteriorate anymore we'll still be 98.6 degrees I believe I don't believe we're going to be a much cold people praise the Lord amen will be who we are but there will be no blood cell deteriorate and then keep deteriorating to keep deteriorating praise God that's what we're heading towards but it's all because of what Grace he's even extending Grace to those people in the hospital right now healing them right now without them even knowing it and don't care so now look the impersonation Christianity 1957 brother Brown said and you're on the basis of what free moral agency that is the ability for you to make a choice amen you can turn it down oh don't tell me you don't have a choice you can preach all you want to brother Brown never preached we didn't have a choice but people in the message say we don't have a choice error you can turn this down or you can accept it to turn it down is to be lost and remain potash and calcium and petroleum but to accept it and to have a white a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit yes part of the logos in you controlling your emotions and when he Coos through his word you coup back and say a man that's your answer to him your answer to him today is amen have faith 1958 someday way back before there was any light on the earth our bodies late in the dust listen our bodies laid in the dust not our soul our bodies laid in the dust we are made of dust potash calcium petroleum Cosmic light God sent forth the great Holy Spirit to brood over the Earth and as he brewed the little flowers began to come and birds flew animals came up from the earth and then came a man and he sinned and separated himself from the fellowship of his God and because of this horrible thing he was commanded by God to return back to the dust of the earth and if we don't take a body change we are going to return back to the dust of the Earth all right because that's God's law he just said it thus Thou Art thus your return but oh Lord God we are so glad that before he returns you have promised a redeemer and today since he has come and sent forth the Holy Spirit again and now he's still brooding over the Dust our bodies and if he raised me and brought me to what I am now without having a choice now if you stop right there brother Brown said you don't have a choice no you didn't have a choice to get here not one of you sat in this building like I said before I tell him last night you go in any Auditorium you go anywhere in the world and you sit down in in the airport and you see five or six thousand people in Atlanta back and forth they all came from the same thing they all came same way everybody came from an act between a man and a woman I don't care if it was done by a doctor with artificial and all this it was a man and a woman and they were born through a womb or come to a woman one of the two amen all right so but remember you didn't have a choice getting here but when you get here you get a choice because I read right here look he made me what I am now without having a choice how much more will he raise us from the dust of the earth after we've made a choice and he has brewed to us and we brewed back to him we love him all right a time of decision 1959 just as Eliza watch that sign on the girl you'll have to watch this sign of the church because Jesus said I don't care what man said I know men say these days and miracles has passed all this stuff is all passed and going by there's no more now you've got to make a choice Jesus said let every man's word be alive mine be true now you've got to make up your mind and you've got to make a choice does that sound like not making a choice look I want you to really read this quote and this may be your last time to make a choice tomorrow may be too late God might have chosen you watch this only a prophet could say this and make sense out of it God might have chose you to eternal life all right but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place don't tell me you were born no special somebody you were born dead and you had to make a choice to receive eternal life if you didn't God's going to give it to somebody else somebody else will take your place wait a minute does everybody believe brother Brown was a prophet okay then we believe this quote right okay I just want to make sure I wasn't in another group second Samuel 22 verse 33 says God is my strength and power he maketh my way perfect now we're heading toward godliness all right Philippians 2 verse 15 that you may be what blameless harmless the sons of God without rebuke wow in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world this is the darkest world ever been and you're a shining light in that Darkness Genesis 17 verse 1 says is when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walked before me and be thou perfect Abram had enough Faith to believe if God told him he was going to make him perfect God was going to have to do it but remember Abram made a mistake he went and he got a Hagar and he went and did this and he he was supposed to go by himself and he took lot with him he was supposed to have this child but now he didn't get the Revelation that it was through Sarah so he took Hagar so see he's making all kinds of mistakes but God what by foreknowledge he saw that Abraham would what endure and that he would have the child with Sarah all right same way with me and you now look perfect is one who lacks nothing in physical strength or beauty they're sound and wholesome that's what we're looking at the Statue of perfect man be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you know what Jesus said so Jesus was saying be thou sound or wholesome a quiet sort of person complete uh morally innocent having integrity one who is morally and ethnically pure that doesn't mean be therefore perfect and that God made Abram perfect and every day the sunshine the bills quit coming hello somebody my power bill just went up 40 50 a month I must be lost that's what people think no I don't mean nothing that means you need to turn your lights off keep sister Regina and okay anyway even in the Rapture even in the Rapture we're going to talk about y'all leaving the lights on in my house you and sister Trudy back there so anyway but that doesn't mean the brother Brown I love what he said though he said cloudy days didn't mean God was against you sunny days didn't mean it was for you either you can't the human things we were talking about last night the human things that we do are human things all right but remember what I told you what does the Holy Ghost do you're going to have problems you're going to have issues you're gonna have things in your life every day but with the Holy Ghost you will learn how to what suppress the fear yes yes cause you got something inside of you that's different from the world this world don't know what's going on they are fearful of everything that's why their heart is weak but if you're perfect you're morally and ethically pure if you have a problem you know how to handle it isn't that a great thing do we remember the time though when we were out floundering around the world and everything went went wrong where did we go we went to our intelligence hello somebody we went to our own intelligence our book you know a self-help book or you know let's go to psychiatrist it's okay if you go it's okay but you don't lean to that lean not to that of the world myself to God read the Bible and I will tell you what you are not what a Scots psychiatrist is going to tell you what you're going to be yeah God's already told you what you're going to be you're gonna be perfect established pure what Marley and ethically pure yeah I really appreciate it I'm going to give a star to who our star needs to go I appreciate the several weddings that we've seen the last few months including these sitting here and Lois and Lucas and Zach and Lily and and uh and like I said before purity something a lot of us can't brag about praise God they're some that can and praise God that there's somebody like Lois and Lucas were here last weekend that when I started to kiss they never kissed before it looked like two two-year-olds well praise the Lord I look at that as innocence now me that's very that's to me that's what God wants he wants you to be so innocent all right finally he got a peck on the cheek because they were trying to aim and you know it just ain't gonna happen but practice makes perfect I asked him the other week and I said y'all get that kissing thing down right they said we good but you know what that's the way with God when you get the new birth you're just a babe in Christ you're a new bride you don't know what's going on because you're innocent of that whether you've been scarred and marred in your human life but in the life of God if you've never been born again and then God burst you into the body of Christ you're a new Creator a creature a new creation you don't know about that you didn't know about all that but we do now we know we've come into purity he gave some Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ look till we all come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God unto what a perfect man unto the measure of the stature that's what we're talking about stature of a perfect man of Christ that we hint for look that we hint for a b y'all got that kissing thing straightened out now like no we're still having problems there'd be an issue there no they had to straighten out they've been practicing that's what we need to do we need to practice with the Lord get our heart right do the things of our he's our lover we're married to him now there's a union that's undefiled well praise the Lord anyway that's what it is when you get born again you get married but you can't stand bride gotta be a wife that will henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried away with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cutting craftedness whereby they lying weight to deceive as I said a couple of Sundays ago I don't want you to really think about this from that scripture you only really believe what you obey if you don't believe that church is important you ain't going to come and you're an unbeliever you don't believe what the Bible says we've got to start believing every word of the Bible not just the part see we like we like to uh we like our own favorite little quotes but why can't you take brother Dale used to bring us 30 and 40 we're talking about the other day he'd bring us 30 and 40 quotes of service he covered that thing thoroughly he would he would take the ones that seemed like I said seem like contrary and make them fit the ones that we say is our Doctrine everybody with me on that all right we pick and choose what we want same way with the Bible well I'll serve you Lord I'll obey you because I believe this but I don't believe that all right when we come to Christianity we should believe the whole word of God not just part of it all right but if it's not your desire then that desire is not in you because I'll read here in just a few minutes brother Brown said if you've got the Holy Ghost you will do what the word says because it's the same person that wrote it is inside of you or he's not inside of you he's just anointing you oh because there's going to be somebody look carried away with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love May grow up into him and all things which is the head even Christ now that word perfecting means completely or complete Furnishing it doesn't mean that you're not going to stub your toe it's not going to mean that that tomorrow that I'm gonna walk in the dentist office and then five teeth that she's going to pull just automatically fall out I wish no they're attached to me and they're going to have to be pulled out because I'm a human all right by old age some of them's already come out that's why we're going to fix them but that doesn't mean one thing about you know if I if I go sit down tomorrow and she sticks that needle in my mouth and it hurts for a moment that don't mean I'm not a Christian oh bro wait you don't lost your Christianity you're hurting you know I lost your Christianity you can't get healed now I don't mean one thing nothing because you know what somebody get healed and not even be a child of God brother Brown says a prostitute can come to the platform get her healing and someone that's a child of God doesn't get their healing because they're thinking about I did this wrong I did that wrong that prostitute just walks to pray and says I believe what that man says so she gets her healing all right completely furnished or Furnishing or equipping in other words when something comes you know how to handle it when something comes your way there's a way that you can not get around it but get through it all right we don't try to go around things we go through them all right so now let's we come to Godliness let's look at this I want you to see something here that we didn't previously bring out but it's um it means Holiness reverence and respect piety towards God that is godliness all right and brother Brown tells us what to be like God all right so how are we going to be like God we got to have a pastor we gotta have a five-fold Ministry you can't press play and become perfect I am so sorry nobody gonna amen that listen that's a fallacy that is a that is a um evil spirit because it's not a spirit that comes from God all right and without controversy great is a mystery of godliness as we were talking about before God was manifesting the flesh oh by the way we know that 2000 years ago Jesus was manifested in flesh what about today amen you are not wood and Bricks and Martyr God one time dwelled in that called a tabernacle he done away with that Tabernacle and now he's inside of me and you now let's read this real quick second Peter 1 verse three this is part of what we've been reading so I'm going to back up and read it according as his divine power hath given unto who all things that pertaining to life and godliness so they start you a perfect man this teaching of we've been a hundred and something sermons is I hope it's helped us even in life even to make our life better and even if it was just a little bit unto life and godliness grow up in God through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of what there's only one divine nature that's God that's deity everybody with me oh that's deity that's something way up there by the way that's something he's deity that's God yep I know that but let's see what the prophet said about that having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this besides this divine nature giving all diligence ad and that's what we've been doing for 100 sermons we've been adding The Virtue add knowledge add Temperance add patience and add godliness and then we'll head to brotherly kindness so let's look and see what deity means a deity is something in other words Supernatural all right the shaping of Western Christianity all Western Christianity is shaped around a deity Now by with me all right Shake Yourself for a minute we're still got an hour to go I'm gonna get to a place all right the word deity means divine Adventure now hope back up here what God tell us we might be what partakers of the divine nature what is divine nature the word deity means divine nature I didn't come up with this I got it off the internet must be true it was coined by Saint Augustine a theologian whose writings were very influential in the shaping of the western Christianity deity comes from the Latin word for God deals all right the divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal goodness and powerfulness or it's a noun that says any supernatural being well listen we got to know who deity is I want you to listen to this it's going to be a long quote but I'm going to read it anyways everybody all right Shake Yourself he swore by himself now listen this is 1954. this is Brother Brown I'm preaching in the early part of his ministry the little corn that come up here now look stop just a minute what are we heading toward we're heading toward the seed that went in the ground to grow and become seed again he's coming after seed he's not coming after plants he's coming after himself he's coming after seed which is what maturity you don't eat corn when it's like this or even like this or even when it tassels you wait till it matures then you can eat corn and then you can take that corn and you can dry it out take that seed if it's if it's heirloom not this junk they got now but you can take that seed and next year you can put it in the ground and guess what it'll do it'll produce two or three years of corn all right that's what God is wanting to do now he's wanting us to come to the divine nature come to maturity so that we can produce more seed more of him so here's brother Brown's thought now in that thought listen the little corn that come up here the first thing the farmer looked and seen these little Sprouts sticking up wonderful he rejoiced after a while they got old and withered away and the corn went on in it the same life that was in this corn down here down here is the same life that's going to be up here it's just going to be more of it more mature in it the same life that was in this corn down here at the first stock is in it up here and then they just went on and on and on so is the church growing on that perfect day when Jesus shall come same Holy Spirit same thing just different dispensation what is our dispensation rapture body change getting out of here that's our dispensation we're not a dispensation of justification anymore full grain full corn full maturity that's a requirement all right to graduate it's a requirement part of the curriculum so if you're going to graduate in the end time Gotta Have It All right just different dispensation now in moving of this look take the heifers the goats everything must be three years old the three different dispensations fatherhood sonship Holy Spirit see three years everything was three years met father son Holy Spirit same God it was under that dispensation is under this dispensation under that dispensation and will always will be the same only one God three dispensations not three Gods three dispensations of the same God all right the same God was in the pillar of Fire was in Christ Jesus right the same one in Christ Jesus didn't go into you oh I'm sorry let's read that again the same one in Christ Jesus in you that's right God in you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God when God condescended and overshadowed Virgin Mary he was alive and a life overshadowed and created a blood cell around itself anyone knows now that the blood cell comes from what comes from the male is that right the life lays in the blood cell and the blood cell is coming from the male not to female we know that all right there's where the life is is in the male sperm notice then God himself not a second person third person the person God himself came into the womb of Mary he went from this great God that brother Ralph tells us in in several sermons and we we we preach it where brother Brown says he covered all space time in eternity you couldn't comprehend this eternal God then you see a little Halo of light then you see a person standing there then you see a world coming into existence he went right back down to a cell that you can't see it's set with a microscope you think it's somebody different no that's what we were talking about last night I I just don't see where people can see that God that Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan well he had to be somebody when he was born God God he was gone when he was born it was God when he died he said oh God can't die no you can't either the inside man came but the outside man sure can then God himself came into the womb of Mary and wrapped himself in a created blood cell [Music] the reason we have eternal life that when that blood cell because of sin was pierced with a sword Yonder and broke in other words at Calvary it freed God Yonder and he broke open the blood cell and watched us and brought us into himself by the Holy Spirit I want you to know what the Holy Ghost is today I want you to really see one somebody was asked last night do you know if you got it well just let's just keep reading let's let brother random explain it all right there you are and now we are sons of God part of God not part of the second person of the Trinity not part of the third person of the Trinity you're part of the creator deity itself lives in every believer every man that's born of the spirit of God is a part of God no wonder he believes in the Supernatural see no wonder I can stand here and I could go up into every Hall at the hospital up there and say God Is A Healer I don't care whether they believe me or not I believe it yeah no wonder he can believe in anything why is it in him is a portion of God wrapped up in your moral body with their sin and everything else has created that body that's inside of you outside of me then now watch but down in there I want you to see this terminology some work of God Alone in regeneration you can't do it your mama can't do it your daddy can't do it I can't do it nobody can do it but God himself there's only way the only way that you're going to get born again is God himself comes down and cleans you up by regening you or giving you a regeneration give you another mom and a daddy hello somebody don't get quiet on me some work of God Alone in regen he does that for you he doesn't do it in a collective body and the quietness of your closet maybe he did it maybe he did it here maybe he did it in a camper somewhere right here motor home you got birth somewhere or either you're getting it or either you didn't get birthed at all but if you are at Birth today this is what God did some work of God alone and regeneration has come down through there what through this by the shedding of his blood and taking away that blood that was in there as a way set it aside set it aside got rid of it pushed it out of the way and entered into this sinful man and put in him a hope that he'd die for it's just as freely as he's standing there speak to him sure he believes him let's continue this long quote Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpent drink deadly things or lay hands on the sick they shall recover this is not just for the preachers praise the Lord Jesus said that why he's become a part of him yes sir God's on the instance of deliver anything he'll make a way when there's no way he makes a way and any man that believes in Him believes the same thing listen if God never heals another person I still believe the Healer I mean we we want to just you know the Bible says lay hands on a sickness shall recover them we all we have all these promises yet when we say brother Michael does something you know he hurts his leg or something he walks up here he wobbles up here and you know we pray for him and we just as human beings we in our thought process it's like man he's gonna walk back through there and he's not going to limp he gets prayed for and here you go now what does that do to your faith it should never make it weaker because he said lay hands on a sick and they shall now we welcome every time everybody microwave Society here we are yeah no we're Crock-Pot Christians it's a slow thing and maybe any man that believes in Him believes the same thing he has to now look brother Brown's going to turn the screws as we always say he's going to tighten them up here right now he's a part of God he's an offspring of God he's a Son of God or a daughter of God and he can't do nothing else because God's right with him he's just a portion of God look everything that God was in a pillar of Fire he emptied into the sun Jesus Christ in him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily is that right the Bible said that God g.o.d himself Jehovah the mighty one the Buckle of The Shield all his Redemptive names everything that he was he emptied into Christ Jesus yeah bye with me and Jesus Christ formed from a blood cell and the outside Shield of the cell itself which was billions times billions smaller than a human eye could see but that was the body of the Lord how about with me that's the the Natural Body of Jesus instead of that was God himself wrapped himself around the blood cell in orders to take his own blood spill his own blood or give it freely that we through the breaking of that blood cell to our mortal when it breaks and our life leads from here and goes out to the Redemption of the blood that God required we can be brought into that body and become a part of God himself as a son of God yeah bye with me brother if you can digest that it'll sure do you some good I wish I had some way just to show you what it is just think of god Jehovah look coming down into the womb of a woman this great big God that created everything he got into a sperm cell went into the womb of Mary he created the egg and sperm placed it in Mary by Immaculate Conception no no feelings or emotions of either one but that was God that was him making his own body man couldn't make him a body because it'd be sinful he made his own body but look folks he's making his own body now he's making his own body right now we take oh that's two thousand years ago listen that baby grew up went through trials and tribulations died for me and you came back on the dead Pentecost and I hope and believe is inside of us coming down into the womb of a woman overshadowed come down in the down to Spirit and he's in there what is he he's the Creator himself he made the very woman in the womb that he was in yes made that woman who Mary God made himself little came down and got into this blood cell and began to build something around him what was it see what caused this thing back there at the beginning blood blood life was in the blood and back there's what caused it in the beginning now take it away God himself has to come down and he made himself real little come into the womb of Mary and created it around himself look a wall human flesh a wall which was the blood cell no man known nothing about it created this blood cell that blood cell pushed to another another one and all the nerves and everything began to come together and God himself living in this making a tabernacle and he dwelt in Christ there's God walking around he said I am my father are one my father is in me he said show us now the father Philip said show me the father and it'll satisfy us Philip have I been so long with him and you don't know me he said when you see me you see the father when people see you in your daily walk do they see the father or your natural father and when you see me you see the father and why I say show me the father I am the father of one my father's living in me now it's not me that doeth the work just him that dwell within me that does the works oh my now listen listen that's what brother Brown said how can I tell a man what's wrong with him how can I tell him what his future will be in 10 years are what he was 40 years ago it isn't me Hallelujah it's him that lives in me that come down that through his blood brought me in fellowship with him hallelujah how could my hands do anything by Healing The Sick hasn't got a bit of power it's not me but it's him that dwells in here that does it he's pointing to somebody how can this man preach the gospel he can't preach no gospel there's nothing in him to do it with wow he's a sinner by Nature but God came down and dwelt in and made him a Son of God and he preached the gospel why does he believe the word because the very God that made the word is preaching right through him the very God that made the word that's why if you got the word inside of you you can't deny the word we were talking about last night if you deny the word of God which is now the message of the hour in its pure form if you turn that down and say it's it's not true it's false then there's just no hope for you folks you just didn't get the Holy Ghost but now listen you can also be in this message for 40 years and get a gold star and die and go to hell because the very God that made the word is preaching right through him how did I see it do you see it there it is the very God that wrote the word is in the man saying that's the truth that's what you're doing today some of you are saying amen because the guy that wrote what I'm telling you about is inside of you quickening and that's the process of saying amen that's the truth I don't care what anybody says that's the truth there it is God in the man look God and the man recognizes his own word that settled it God in here believe all things hope all things endure all things is that right all the scriptures inspired of God God wrote it when God comes in here God recognizes his own word and says sure that's the truth a believer now you go to doctoring it up somewhere that's between you and God but God recognizes his own word oh how that makes us feel God's inspired word listen to this Faith the substance the things hoped for 1951 and the Very God back there in the beginning that role the world the stars and made them from things which didn't appear or made them out of things that do appear and where did he get the material to make it he spoke it into existence by his word he said let there be and it was so watch deity and that a portion of that deity dwells in the heart of every born-again Christian that's my brother Brown could say you're a little creator then what did he say ask what you will it'll be given to you there you are deity fell on the day of Pentecost it's still falling now and men are regenerated made a new person sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit The Life of Christ pressed into them all their drinking immoral habits and everything go out the love of God is like a notary public I happen to be one sister Rebecca is too takes a seal and what we do is we press the seal we we get certified number one then we make sure we're not criminals ourselves and we and we see put a seal on it that signifies that what that paper says that's what it is and then the person that signed it so now look it presses it until the inscription of the seal is pressed in the paper over the signature oh my when Christ signs your name on The Book of Life and the Holy Spirit presses it in there until the Life of Christ is formed in you becomes deity resurrection of Lazarus look deity I'm a part of Charles Brandon because I was born from Charles Brown or my daddy and I'm a part of him I've got a forehead like him my hair is like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my dad listen when cats get together they have what cats dogs get together they have dogs horses get together they have horses man and woman gets together they have humans when man gives itself to God and lets God in you become God and if we become in the spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God God said nothing impossible with you let me read that one more time they said nothing is impossible to God right that's what the Bible says God said there's nothing impossible with you if you'll believe not with God but you deities in man the very God that stood back in the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be a son and you're a part of him God dwells in mankind and him himself man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are it might choke you but study over it a little while he is God dwells in man and man becomes the Son of God not him and himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unwavering faith you got something today stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is God there he is inside of me and you and you know why if they hated him when he was on Earth deity in human flesh they're going to hate you this world is going to come to and and most of it listen anybody that's that's not born again is going to hate you eventually oh yeah they you're good you just strike them somewhere you know hit home somewhere preach the word to him tell them the truth you'll see Jesus told them the truth and they killed him for saying he was God they're going to kill me and you even our influence by saying oh you're some special God person Hallelujah let the world know that if God lives inside of this flesh it is deity it is God according to John 1 1 God was put in flesh and dwelt among the world you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved that word endureth means What Remain abide not recede or flee that's what we were talking about yesterday you know you see people come and and you hate it because you want you want everybody to see the word of God you want everybody to see you they want everybody to have what you got all right okay but you see some coming and you see them disappear well when they disappear something happened endureth means to remain abide not recede or flee start preaching the gospel real hard what happens people hit the door not because Janine just went out and Aaron come here walking in the family back there that I didn't mean that you understand you know what I'm talking about though I mean honestly you said you we're gonna have communion today we're not we had communion last Sunday but we're gonna have communion today everybody's standing let's bring the bread and the wine is about eight or ten head out the door why you tell me why you can call me you can you can call me whatever you want to call me but something's wrong in their life because that's an institution that God said all Christians should do right so don't get mad at me but you head out that back door then what there's something not right inside of you well let's get it right that's all I want I want to I don't I don't condemn them people I pray for them if you don't participate that's your business but you're showing just like water baptism just like today Luke's going to show the world I wish sin no I don't like CNN Fox could be here whatever I wouldn't care show the whole world that we're going to baptize our brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of his sin and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if he continues on everybody with me I'm not ashamed of that baptize them anywhere anytime I go up in them we'll go up to Northeast Georgia Medical Center and I'll baptize him in that new Fountain they got up there if you walk into North Tower it runs down the side of the wall you know it's going to be hard to get it but you can do it you can get them baptized I don't care don't mind but those who endured in the end in other words endure my teaching and endure my preaching and do it by preaching brother now enjoy it Aaron Louise I'm not going to discluding anybody you too Michael does a good job downstairs God's got a hold of that young man and I'm really proud of him I'll give you a rose now [Applause] but those who endure to the end the end to which all things relate the aim or the purpose those who endure to the end shall be saved when you receive a body change as brother Dale's always told us when you take a body change you can say I am truly born again but less endure let's endure to the end and that don't make now let when it says endure that don't mean flowery bed of ease that don't mean the bed is going to be soft that don't mean that that the Thorns are not going to stick your finger if you stick your hand in a rose bush okay but it does mean that you got something inside of you that can help take the edge off of that fear and off of that uncertainty this world is full of uncertainty and and and literally we don't know what's going to next we do I'm not like the world they've got the people that said over here and they say this is going to happen you know they ain't got the people over here that say this is going to happen we're going to go by you know we were going to all go to Bitcoin now bitcoin's gonna fell apart we're gonna go over to this one now this one fell apart well we're going to go to the Dollar well the Dollar's fixing to fall apart God will never Fall Apart so we can put our dependency that God if we put ourselves in Christ that he'll give us what we need let's read this real quick and then we'll close and we're not getting anywhere but we got to Godliness anyway but godliness is deity living inside of you and remember when you get born again that is deity living inside of you but you have taken that little baby and put a baby inside of you because you're a newborn what babe in Christ you got to grow you got what lay it out you got to teach it send it to school it'd be horrible if you took um somebody a baby and never let it never never let it go to school I know we homeschooling different things but I'm talking about just don't teach you nothing oh what kind of horrible thing would you have we got all these kids now that are young adults that's learning how to drive Levi do you have to give him a muscle car he goes that way towards Jefferson home that way we go don't we but you know what we all now listen and there's an example here we got Daddy God sure he's never worried but you're worried you're worried that you can't drive that car right how many of us have went to the drivers to to the to the driver's service to take your driver's test and you're like got this man Only You Marca okay but he drought he used to drive an Idaho where there's four people lives in the whole state so there's more there's more potatoes than there are people in that because we didn't know we it's but look we had studied and I'm gonna ask how many failed our tests the first time so but how many of you failed a test of life more than one time but you know what God's standing there going hey it's okay and then now you know insurance companies will tell you that number one men are worse drivers than women right that's what I said but you're sitting right back there on average why because we'd like to drive fast we like amen he said we like to you know take a thrill the girl's like I don't know if I want to do that or not so the insurance company says that we guys are our insurance is going to be higher because we're more prone to driving fast and having accidents and and all that stuff okay well same way with God he knows that we as human beings some of us are going to be train wrecks to begin with OR car wrecks but it does give us assurance not insurance he gives us assurance that if we make it through that trial that will get to be a better driver and we'll drive like 30 in a 70. as we get older but we're more cautious and that's what happens in the word of God we become more cautious and we become more um we become more you know I was taking a test to get my CDL this was back early 90s and um the guy from Fieldale was giving me the test and and with it would be easier because we knew them and so we're driving along and I turned down this road and the guy says okay I said what's the weight limit on this road I had studied I knew all my sign markers I knew how to look under the engine and find the manifold and find the uh the brakes and find because they're air brakes so you have air brakes and Ryan knows what I'm talking about you have all these different things you got to study I drove right past that sign never even paid attention to it but every road if you'll notice now every road there's a major road has a weight limit sign well you didn't know that that's why I'm preaching today because there's a lot of things you didn't know okay life lesson 473. there's a sign that says and it tells you that you can go down here if you're six wheel right on your right six wheel eight wheel ten wheel and it's got them out 25 000 pound gross weight limit 50 000 pound gross weight it's on it's on every Road I didn't know that until the dry until the instructor the Holy Ghost said hey you missed that sign you missed that sign you missed what that brother was preaching but you know what happened now even now 30 years later I can just about to tell you wherever sign is because as soon as I turned down the road I look to the right and there's that white sign that says the weight limit gross weight limit and all that stuff so anyway little life lesson but that's the way the Holy Ghost does me I don't know if he does you he'll let you take the test and he'll let you fail every once in a while but he'll he'll go hey read the sign it's on every road and it's important you seen those you've seen those things on YouTube where the truck's driving under a under a bridge oopsie it's supposed to be 14 and a half feet and they're like 15. that don't fit under a 14 and a half foot Bridge and the bed comes completely off all right he didn't read his sign because back about a mile before that there was a sign that said Bridge 14 and a half feet limit all right so let's get our sign right all of us the sign is now for us to go up that statue of perfect man add to these things add to your faith virtue knowledge tempers patience godliness you're moving right on up in the line let's read what the prophet says and then we'll stop fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean I just told you about an hour's worth of that it means deity dwelling inside of you and letting it work yes knowing see you when you're born again you got deity inside of you uh you're a baby but you don't know how to walk you don't give a baby a checkbook you sure don't give a baby a credit card you ought not giving me 16. 20. 40. I'll get somebody man's in a minute what does godliness mean I looked up four or five dictionaries it just means to be like God it means to let that deity that's inside of you out and let it work he's asking you to have virtue which is strength he's asking you to have the knowledge of God to know that a preacher is telling you the truth or not telling you the truth some of y'all Sister Barbara did she send you all that WhatsApp that she was out there uh listening to a preacher out there and what you know what she said she said thank God for the ministry in this church because they were not telling the truth they were not telling the truth it was a Doctrine that's prevalent all over the all over the the uh message listen and we'll talk about that maybe one day we're going to have to when we get up to to The Headstone because the headstone message is the sharpening of the pencil it's the sharpening of the sword it's not that you don't have the sword you've got the sword from the beginning you just don't know how to use it brother Brown said then if you've got the sword he said it takes a strong hand of Faith to use it it doesn't matter if you got the prettiest longest sharpest sword if you don't know what you're doing you might cut yourself not the enemy but if you're trained to do the right thing make the Right Moves he said you can take it right straight to the heart of the enemy that's what we'll talk about later on because see that's a faith that's that's more than that Faith that's right here remember brother Brown said faith alone won't do it not just faith in everybody there's a lot of faith but we gotta have rapturing faith and we'll talk about that a little bit later on so to be like God he says oh no I can't do that brother Bramble yes you can you gotta let out what's inside of you let it work if you don't have it please don't sleep until you get it we're not guaranteed tomorrow we're not guaranteed the next two seconds all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you all the things be therefore p-e-r-f-e-c-t brother Brown said even as your father in Heaven is perfect so brother Brown is uh and you can see by by discernment you know he's preaching on virtue and he's you know knowledge he gets the temperance and he makes a couple of statements like well man that's gonna you know knock a lot of us off but when he gets to Godliness he starts feeling that the people are like we'll never be able to do this we'll never be able to get there that's my brother around had to Kate looks like he backs up and he says yes you can be there for p-e-r-f-e-c-t what's that perfect you get way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first so he's telling them you got to add this first can't just jump up there you gotta add this first then when you get up here he's asking you all right let me put in my own words he's asking you to use what you've got he's asking you to use all that knowledge all that virtue all the things that God's given us Temperance patience he's asking you to put it together and realize your deity you're part of deity he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God how many things I could say then he talks about turning to Ephesians let's read this a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he's part of the word of God and in this last days of this bride taking form now this is us the bride taking form just exactly the same power that he was at the beginning he has come through these organizations and so forth listen folks God was in the Baptist one day God was into Methodist one day he's not now uh they split all they want to there's some good people in there but the organization you see what it's doing now it's shutting churches down a whole church the whole uh all of Oklahoma pretty much 50 something churches pulled out of that whatever they're doing to let gay people preach and all that stuff then I read where in Pennsylvania the Methodist Church is saying oh no we own the buildings you all need to leave that's God that's the bride in the end time it's we have enough fighting with each other now there's ain't no fighting over that but but God came through these organizations but remember what brother Brown said they cabbage down in other words they said this is it God said look moving on this is it nope Moving on but listen this is it amen there can't be nothing else but that so we're at the end there's a Doctrine according to Godliness and I just proved it to you by being deity all right godliness with contentment is great gain you know if you if you say that what what is contentment now to me and you contentment is everything is going right every bill is paid your car doesn't skip the check engine light doesn't come on your tires just inflate on yourself on their own self we wished but what is godliness with contentment what is the word contentment a perfect condition of life in which no Aid or support is needed all right sufficiency of the necessities of life a mind contended with this lot now listen we're not supposed to that doesn't mean to sit down you're satisfied where you're at that means you're content where you're at right and I know we're not all as we were talking last night there is there is questions in our mind and and my sister asked she said well how do you know you got the new birth I said I asked him for it every day what brother Dale always tell us I'd rather seek God every day and say Lord give me the Holy Ghost and know that I got it then to just say well bless God I know I got it because I can understand the seals and I'm sitting in the church and I go to Lula and Oklahoma and realize when you get to the end you didn't have it all you had was an anointing that made you feel good hmm so seek him every day of the life every day of your life say God I want more of you I want more of you we talk about Christ was turned out the colonel the wheat see that's what we're looking at we're not looking at plants anymore everybody with me real quick all right just shake yourself just for a minute we're not plants all right because remember justification is two shoots right that's got life in it but it doesn't look like corn for those of you that's growing things you plant corn if it it's going to get about this high before it really doesn't look like grass hey man the only reason you know it's corn is you planted it in that row right but if you were to just walk out there and say what's that well it looks like grass to me start pulling it up no but I promise you once it matures and gets on up and it puts a character he puts on the character of what the seed is when he starts putting on the character somebody goes oh that's corn oh that's a Christian cause they act like it you don't see him on never mind you don't see him on Sunday doing something else laughs here's the word Christ himself himself that's the anointed word which shall come for the rest of his body the bride the anointed of the same water that watered the weed as we talked about also watered the tears anointed ones he's talking about anointed ones at 10 time but remember those who endure to the end shall see the corn those who endure to the end shall see the wheat you will see I'll promise you you go plant corn and if nothing else happens if you get enough water and you get enough fertilizer you will have a couple of ears of corn on that stalk all right you can't make it you can't change it all right only God can change it so he's talking about anointing ones only the word will separate them not the signs we'll talk about that last night now watch right here I'm gonna read this right here this will this will help uh the sister that um that asked that question last night they're anointed in their second realm all right so anointed ones are anointed in their second realm not in their soul all right now look today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God's Got but he can't bring the word word by word he can bring some like I was telling you before went to Memorial Day meeting years and years ago and this brother was preaching on the Millennium and he was I mean I still preach stuff that he preached that he brought out that that I had not seen about the Millennium but he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl at that time every time he was doing that and got caught and got put in jail and he's back out now and if he repents that's okay but at the moment I thought he was weak because he was preaching the word but he fell somewhere he didn't preach at all but he cannot bring that word word by word there's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he'll always fail talk about Satan then he's talking about the faults and only ones shout speaking tongues dance preach the gospel and still a devil look at this promise know that the Lord has set apart him that is Godly for himself he set us apart he did not us if you start blowing your own whistle yeah let God blow your whistle because he'll blow it at the right time the right moment everything will be just right when he Blows the Whistle because he said he would separate us he would set us aside right there's the promise all right everybody with me just for a minute now so Godly that word Godly means Theos it is like God or resemble him in any way just like I said about deity God's representative or vice or vast region of magistrates of judges you were made sorry after a Godly Manner and this is Corinthians but you might receive damage of us of nothing for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this self same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you once you come up to the Statue perfect man when you come come up to Godliness there is a carefulness you're careful you don't jump into things like we read where brother Brown said scrap Heath from ministers people that want to go out past the program of God and they have a wreck if you'll stay in the program of God realize who you are and what you're doing here is that not a quote realize who you are not who I am now who brother Dale is realize who you are and what you're doing here you'll be in Invincible Army together we will be an invincible Army let's continue just for a second all that will live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution what the Bible says but listen the Bible says that Moses Moses could have been the next Pharaoh he could have had he could have had grapes put in his mouth by the most PR the most beautiful women in the world until the day he died never have a one of nothing they'd fan him they'd feed him and he could have a harem of women he could have all he wanted the Bible said he forsook that he forsook that to be the one to lead them out of that wow what about me and you let's don't sell ourselves out for gold silver pearls a good job if your job takes you away from God get another one and all that will live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived I'd rather suffer here and know I got eternal life then as the Bible tells have pleasure as Moses did of sin for a season listen I was telling them last night I'm 63 years old dad's 83. but I've only got about 20 good years left 20 or 25 good years and it's a boast some of y'all are older you got to think about that all right we need to get out of here and go up listen and what I'm saying I'm saying to you young people when I was 25 or 30 years old I did I was I'd have probably said some words I shouldn't have said but I'd have said there's no way I was going to be old enough to draw Social Security start in September June 2. we've grown old together we didn't think about those things 44 years ago there's a lot of things we didn't think about but what are you saying by the way listen life is fleeting doesn't matter if you're allotted 90 years or sister cleita you know getting in the into the late night or middle 90s you're not guaranteed to Mark kids there's a lot of good kids have passed away from one Sunday to the next Sunday we see them then we don't see them anymore you look in the paper and and you see all these young people dying um Cancers and car wrecks and stuff you're not guaranteed but I promise you one thing's for sure if you get born again you're guaranteed eternal life you're guaranteed that you will rise again and there'll be a Divine Healing on one day that your body your old body will never be able to get over whatever's inside of you is going to go get that old body that you lived in and it's going to change it completely into a brand new creation ain't gonna make it eternal that's not a fairy tale folks that's a promise so you can have whatever you want of this world take whatever you want to this world the High Life the high time I've been there it's not worth one second of what I got now not one second I wouldn't trade it would you those of you there's been that's a true would you trade it that's why I'm saying last night how could you even want to go back to something like that wow no thank you look the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation and to reserve the unjust into the day of judgment to be punished that's what I said a little bit of season folks if we're having to go through trials and tribulations right now you may think that you're going through and it's going to last all your life no it's not you go through a little piece of life and you come out on the other end but if you'll come out on the other end with God much better blessed is a man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners and our sitteth in the seed of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night you remember back when you weren't born again though what'd you meditate on what I'm going to do tomorrow how much more money I can make brother John shaking his head how much more debt I can get in right I mean that's that's what that just took our whole life over but now now what and it is a real small part you got to worry about bills and stuff like that but it's all centered around God it's all centered around you believing that there's a higher there's a deity that's not living beside you it's living inside of you because The Godly are not so they're like chaff which the wind driveeth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sent us in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish an ungodly means Wicked a criminal we're all criminals but guess what I had an advocate I had a judge I had a lawyer and I had all the witnesses they said I didn't do it because I went into God's Court one day and he said I didn't see him do it a judge can't do that do you know a judge and a jury can't say I saw that they have to depend on Witnesses right they have to depend on somebody to say I saw that and then they make an opinion on that they have to make an opinion on what they on here say listen I'm not making an opinion on hearsay this is what God say that's right so I'm gonna make I'm gonna form my opinion on what God say because it's a witness we all are witnesses I don't want to be a guilty one I don't want to be a criminal I don't want to be Wicked guilty of sin Romans 5 verse 5 says in due time Christ died for the ungodly thank God because we were ungodly at one time let's keep going on for a minute I want to read just one more thing before we go we talked about reconciliation last Sunday we'll talk about it again I'm gonna go just close your eyes makes people sick when you do that I'm sorry but I want to get down here to the end I want to read something to you in the seventh seal and then we'll get back to brotherly kindness because brother kindness is kind of a lengthy um a lengthy thought but we got to get to this and it's going to be something that's really going to help you and it's going to put everything together for those of you that's been through the hundred and something or those of you that's been through 10 or 15. this is the culmination is is we're going to come to a place that there is an interval and in that interval there something happens all right if something happens in that interval it's not just you know if you say we have an intermission or an interval that means that you know you stop the play or you stop the movie and you go get you something to drink or you go something's happening and you're not just sitting there asleep there's something going on so now notice this being one verse talking about he's on the seventh seed I'm going to read this real quick and then we'll stand our feet we'll sing a song If you have a need we'll worship for a little while and then we'll go to the baptismal pool it's ready to go all right and anybody wants to be baptized we've got plenty of towels we can help sisters brothers whatever needs to be if you need to change some of the sisters talk to a sister to where to go Brothers talk to a brother where to go all right now between the sixth and seventh seal something takes place see and how lovely that's placed just At Its Right Place between sixth and seventh chapter we'll get into that because if you read your Bible Revelations chapter 6 is what when the sale start am I with me take us out for a minute that's when it's that's when it says that in the first deal open and then it goes down to what goes down to number six and then it stops then the seventh chapter comes in there's an interval then in Revelations 8 1 says that when the seventh seal open there was an interval all right if you look between Revelations 10 um 10 6 7 Revelations 10 listen Revelations 10 as an insertion and it's inserted read it you'll you'll get your trumpets your vowels will go to six and stop there'll be an interval or another chapter and then there'll be a seventh we'll get into that but this it's the same thing with right here because that's what's going to happen when you come to a place of that we come to a place of Brotherly kindness and we see that thing it says holy spirit there's your interval thereby with me now listen I want you to look real quick faith is not an ass so you don't go one two three four five six seven eight because brother Brown says seven there's seven ads so add to your faith which is not an ad add one two three four five six there's an interval and there's seven there's an answerable that you got to stop and just say hang on a man and you know what it is to me it's the Providence and grace of God because we've went through this you know it's kind of like it's kind of like you go through um school and you have like six or six periods or seven six periods and then you have a recess all right you have an elective something that you you kind of your mind just kind of you know back a little bit that's what I believe God's doing here he's like he's man we're we're striving one two three four five six take a breather I don't mean go quit going to church take a breather all right and that's what we look watch and we'll close right here now if you notice in the seventh chapter we notice between the sixth and seventh there's an interval an interval between the sixth and seventh chapter of the Book of Revelations and it's between the sixth and seventh seal that this interval is given now we want to notice this very important that we notice this little time I just want you to keep that stick that in the back of your head because we're going to get to it a little bit later on we're going to get to that interval because it is very very very very very very important number one it's important to get there right there's not an interval between one two and three four five six it's between six and seven there's a there's a time to just take a breather stop for a man God knows we're humans and we just sat there and we you know you sit there and you pound and you're pounding you pound your pound all right hang on a minute there's something we're gonna have to deal with in between there we got to deal with and understand that that holy spirit's the same as it is down here but it was something it's something we need up there we gotta have to continue on we had to have Revelations chapter 7 to continue with Revelation chapter eight everybody with me we had to have Revelations 10 inserted between 9 and 11. for the trumpets and then for the vowels and all the different ones you had one two three four five six and then there's an interval there's a stop point and it looks like it's covering something totally different but what it's doing is it's bridging everything together what this is doing right here it's bridging us together from going from a son of God Revelation into the son of man Revelation all right that's what we've been trying to get to for 100 something sermons so let's stand to our feet God bless you thank you for being patient well bro Joe let's sing a song if anybody has a need um come forward

all good and warm I had it on for a couple of days so it's good warm the water's good and warm and uh if it wasn't good and warm we're still going to baptize but uh we sure appreciate every person that's being baptized it's a show that they want to do something different than what they're doing all right I mean we really believe that if you'll repent and be baptized that God will fill you with the Holy Ghost that's the whole that's the ultimatum is to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen and so we're going to go through the ordinances today of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and remember brother Bob will be preaching Wednesday night this coming weekend again get with sister June about what to bring we're going to have taco bar which will be you know it'll be all

brother Luke and anybody else that wants to be baptized all right do you have any father thank you for the time you've given us you give us Lord the word of God and we pray that that as we navigate through life that we will it's okay to look at self-help books and different things but why not just depend on the word of God what you said because it'll never fail it'll never change they'll they'll not be a second edition or a third edition or another Edition it's the Holy Bible and we pray that we will come to that Lord that will be molded in your image as we continue up this statue of perfect

spend here that that many of them teach our Sunday School classes and many of them teach our younger younger girls how to do things of Life father we appreciate each one of them and now father I pray as we go to the water to baptize our brother Lord It's others will make a decision to step out and claim the promise that if we're repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins we shall receive a gift we're going to give all the mothers a gift today the sisters but Lord the gift you give us is eternal life can't buy it not for sale no price on it at all it's free
