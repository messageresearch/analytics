[6:32] hello there we go well josh told me said
[6:35] turn that microphone off they left it on
[6:37] so i turned it off and didn't turn mine
[6:39] on
[6:40] so
[6:41] i don't think you have a problem hearing
[6:42] me
[6:45] thank you sister i appreciate
[6:46] that i like i like this picture see this
[6:50] picture we're going to start using it a
[6:51] little bit as kind of a background
[6:53] um and that kind of shows you uh what
[6:55] we're talking about amen
[6:57] christ is the head
[7:00] we're the body man so we're the body of
[7:02] god but we must have these virtues in
[7:04] our life to be the body of god amen all
[7:06] right sure we're birthed into the body
[7:08] we're sons and daughters down here
[7:11] but he
[7:12] he'd look kind of funny having the head
[7:13] stuck down here on the feet now there's
[7:15] a there's a functioning body there's a
[7:17] lot of moving parts
[7:18] in between the feet and the neck
[7:21] that brings all this thing together so
[7:23] uh
[7:24] i kind of want to give you a little
[7:25] visual there to see and christ is the
[7:27] head that is what we are the christ is
[7:29] the head stone he's the one
[7:32] or what is stone revelation so he's the
[7:34] head revelation all right so
[7:37] uh if you want to let's go ahead and
[7:38] turn to second peter one and we'll uh
[7:41] continue our thought i hope this morning
[7:42] was okay we didn't uh get to where i
[7:45] wanted to get but uh but we can get to
[7:47] it now
[7:48] it's scratching
[7:50] we're trying to
[7:53] benny put
[7:54] brother benny said it was scratching
[7:55] this morning i think it may be coming
[7:57] from our from our
[7:59] collar
[8:01] how about that
[8:05] that better
[8:06] okay i'll be still i'm going to stand
[8:08] here all day just like this
[8:14] second peter chapter one
[8:18] no
[8:19] we'll be all right i like this bear and
[8:20] i do the harness because you don't feel
[8:22] anything on your head that thing would
[8:23] pull you know on your head so i like
[8:25] this underneath
[8:26] the collar but we just got to get used
[8:28] to it so
[8:29] just uh technology sometimes takes time
[8:32] but uh
[8:33] 2 peter 1 verse 1 and let's pray before
[8:36] we get started i know i know i i wanted
[8:39] sisters freedom them to sing that song
[8:40] because it struck me when we were when
[8:43] we were laying the prayer cloths out you
[8:44] know the the song says a wall of fire
[8:47] around me
[8:48] there's nothing now to fear so that's
[8:50] what we got to do we got to get a wall
[8:52] of fire around us amen uh what happened
[8:55] to gaheza and elijah gaheza said
[8:58] in other words
[9:00] there's only two of us here you know and
[9:02] elijah says
[9:03] no
[9:04] more of us than they are them
[9:06] he said open my servant's eyes right so
[9:09] you can see when he did he said there's
[9:10] ring of fire chariots
[9:12] all around that prophet in geheza so we
[9:14] got to see that rim of fire around us
[9:17] to take care of all these
[9:19] natural problems that we got right okay
[9:21] i want to take care of these natural
[9:23] problems because we are we're working on
[9:25] the spiritual man but we got to have
[9:26] that natural man sharp too
[9:28] so that he can uh enjoy the service and
[9:31] not
[9:32] not be sick and you know how sickness it
[9:34] does it takes your mind away from things
[9:36] that's what satan likes he likes to take
[9:38] our mind away from stuff by giving us a
[9:40] sickness or a worry what have i got
[9:42] what's going to happen how long is it
[9:44] going to be out my temperature is going
[9:45] to be this i'm going to be out of work
[9:47] it's all that worry
[9:48] and that fear so let's just take that
[9:50] fear out
[9:51] know that it's the devil
[9:54] know that he's trying to stop you
[9:56] and then just stand there and wait on
[9:58] god to manifest himself so let's pray
[10:00] before we get started
[10:02] the heavenly father we pray today lord
[10:03] that you would
[10:04] sanctify us one more time for this
[10:06] journey that we're on
[10:08] forgive us of our sins and our many
[10:09] mistakes that we make lord
[10:12] we pray that you just touch the ones
[10:14] that are sick lord be with them raise
[10:15] them up for your honor and glory lord
[10:18] truly let there be a wall of fire around
[10:20] us
[10:21] the holy spirit take care of all the
[10:22] things that we have lord the little
[10:24] sicknesses
[10:25] and the worries and the problems lord i
[10:27] pray that you would
[10:29] take them all away lord
[10:31] that we'll look to your word
[10:33] that will believe that your words are
[10:34] truth
[10:36] and that it's our absolute lord
[10:38] and i pray that you should be with each
[10:39] one lord take care of the ones that are
[10:41] not here
[10:42] the ones that are away for different
[10:44] things lord be with brother louise take
[10:45] care of him lord raise him up lord we
[10:48] all bind together and bind that power of
[10:50] satan that's trying to stop his voice
[10:53] from being heard over there in the
[10:54] foreign countries
[10:56] we pray that they'll have a very
[10:57] successful time even from now on lord we
[11:00] pray that you're just blessed take care
[11:02] be with us lord as we open your word and
[11:04] read it
[11:05] may you bless the hearer and the speaker
[11:07] in the name of jesus christ amen
[11:11] ii
[11:12] peter 1 simon peter a servant and
[11:14] apostle jesus christ
[11:16] to them that have obtained like precious
[11:18] faith so who's he's talking to he's
[11:19] talking not to him he's talking to us
[11:20] okay
[11:21] like precious faith with us through the
[11:24] righteousness of god and our savior
[11:25] jesus christ
[11:27] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[11:29] through the knowledge of god and jesus
[11:31] our lord
[11:32] according as his divine power they see
[11:35] that divine power has given us now we
[11:37] ain't got to the virtues yet
[11:40] when i got to the virtues he's talking
[11:41] about we're talking about the divine
[11:44] power hath given unto us all things that
[11:46] pertain to the life and godliness all
[11:48] right the way we live our life and how
[11:50] to live it godly through the knowledge
[11:52] of him that has called us to glory and
[11:54] virtue whereby are given unto us
[11:58] exceeding great and precious promises
[11:59] that by these the prophet said these
[12:01] promises you might be partakers
[12:04] of the divine nature can't partake of
[12:06] the divine nature until you do this
[12:08] having escaped the corruption that is in
[12:10] the world through lust all right stop
[12:12] period
[12:13] and besides this
[12:16] besides this divine nature beside this
[12:18] being a partaker of the divine nature of
[12:20] god and beside this
[12:23] giving all diligence there's that word
[12:25] diligence again add to your faith virtue
[12:27] and diverse your knowledge and all these
[12:29] temperance temperance patience and i'm
[12:31] really going to be glad to get into all
[12:32] these because there really will help us
[12:34] i think and the patience godliness and
[12:36] the godliness brotherly kindness and the
[12:38] brotherly kindness charity
[12:40] for if there's that word if that little
[12:43] word that's very big if these things
[12:45] be in you and abound in you not around
[12:48] you or an anointing that just comes on
[12:50] you while you're at church
[12:57] right
[12:59] if these things be in you then
[13:01] everywhere you go you carry them with
[13:02] you right
[13:04] okay if these things be in you and
[13:06] abound
[13:07] they make you that you shall neither be
[13:09] barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge
[13:11] of our lord jesus christ listen there's
[13:12] only one thing
[13:14] that we as christians should be looking
[13:16] for and that's to be number one be in
[13:18] love with god and waiting for that body
[13:21] change because it's not going to happen
[13:23] a baby is not going to take a body
[13:25] change
[13:28] jesus wasn't a baby
[13:30] he was a man right all right he was a
[13:32] man when his body was changed all right
[13:35] but he that lacketh these things is
[13:37] blind
[13:39] and cannot see afar off
[13:41] and has forgotten that he was purged
[13:43] from his old sins that's why there has
[13:45] to be there had to be a remembrance in
[13:47] the old testament every year of sin
[13:49] remember you read that in hebrews that
[13:51] every year the high priest went behind
[13:53] the veil and he made an atonement for
[13:55] the sins and people forgot about it
[13:59] same thing with you and i
[14:01] now even if the new birth sometimes we
[14:03] forget things
[14:05] and we forget that we were purged from
[14:07] our old sins
[14:08] wherefore the rather brethren give
[14:10] diligence there's that word again to
[14:12] make your calling in election sure
[14:14] for if you do these things you shall
[14:17] never follow right you lord man is
[14:19] blessing to the reading of the word you
[14:21] may be seated
[14:22] but remember this morning as we're
[14:24] talking about the foundation
[14:26] we put it as being required obviously it
[14:30] is
[14:30] but i don't think
[14:32] and i think i was talking to somebody
[14:34] between the break that um
[14:38] most people don't feel it's a
[14:39] requirement so it's not preached on that
[14:41] much it's just it's just that we're in
[14:44] this age
[14:46] and we're up here and that's the
[14:47] automatic process
[14:49] that since we're in the last age we are
[14:52] we got all this
[14:53] and we're just waiting on
[14:55] we're waiting on the bus to pull up as
[14:56] brother dale always says but that's not
[14:58] the truth we all start down there at
[15:01] faith
[15:03] and then we go to virginia's tempers all
[15:04] the way up to the capstone
[15:07] and remember
[15:09] bring the bring the full
[15:11] picture up
[15:14] brother bob's running it today
[15:17] so thanks brother bob for doing that but
[15:18] you see this is the full stature the
[15:20] only way to get into this
[15:22] is to be born again right all right
[15:25] we're going to talk about faith this
[15:26] evening
[15:27] because you are going to have to believe
[15:29] in something
[15:30] i know there's an old song i think it's
[15:32] an old country song said if
[15:34] if you can't don't stand for nothing
[15:35] you'll fall for anything
[15:37] you know and that's the truth if you
[15:39] don't stand for something you got to put
[15:41] you it doesn't matter even when you were
[15:43] a sinner there was things that you that
[15:46] you said this is the way it is and this
[15:47] is the way it is and this is where there
[15:49] was something that you stood for but now
[15:50] we're talking about now life and
[15:52] godliness we're taking those things life
[15:55] you've got to stand for something
[15:57] or you'll fall for anything you'll fall
[15:59] for any doctrine you'll fall for any
[16:01] slight of the devil you know i'm quoting
[16:02] scripture really
[16:04] any slight of the devil or cunning
[16:05] craftiness remember we read it this
[16:07] morning how that false teachers come in
[16:09] and they you know give you something to
[16:11] that they'll give you a false hope right
[16:14] okay but we're talking about the faith
[16:16] of god
[16:18] the new birth is not
[16:20] the faith of the devil
[16:23] or anyone else the new birth is the
[16:25] faith of god
[16:27] being delivered to you you have to
[16:29] believe
[16:31] to see right right not see
[16:34] to believe right all right you say well
[16:37] i don't see
[16:39] myself coming to whatever well that
[16:42] means you don't believe right right or
[16:44] maybe let's put it this way maybe you
[16:46] don't understand how to get it like i
[16:48] was talking about the electrician with
[16:49] with brother tim
[16:51] you you you don't know how to get there
[16:54] because you can have the new birth and
[16:56] not be taught well
[16:58] and not know how to get to a place right
[17:01] okay and what the problem is is when you
[17:03] get the preachers of the message because
[17:05] see peter
[17:07] had to have these virtues working in his
[17:10] life for him to be able for it to be in
[17:13] the eternal word of god he could not
[17:15] preach it presumptuously right
[17:18] brother branham didn't preach anything
[17:20] presumptuously what he preached he saw
[17:23] amen
[17:24] all right because if he didn't then then
[17:26] he's remember what he said he said if if
[17:28] god don't break those seals he said
[17:30] we're just what presuming right right
[17:32] and presuming is it is venturing without
[17:34] authority and that's the problem with a
[17:35] lot of people the message they venture
[17:37] out without the authority god i've got
[17:40] they have the power
[17:41] but they don't have the character yet
[17:43] right okay so power apart from
[17:45] characters what satanic but power with
[17:48] character is fit to what rule
[17:51] you and i must have dominion to me
[17:54] all in a nutshell you don't ever have to
[17:56] come back anymore
[17:58] this is the whole message
[18:00] this is dominion
[18:03] yeah
[18:03] this is the dominion of uh we have lost
[18:07] the dominionship of our patients
[18:09] that's why we need to have the patience
[18:11] of god right because i believe
[18:14] that adam
[18:16] walked in the garden of eden
[18:19] with these virtues
[18:22] because he had the holy ghost
[18:24] and the holy ghost are these virtues
[18:26] right now what did he do
[18:28] now when adam was walking on the into
[18:30] the garden of eden before the fall
[18:33] adam would say
[18:35] that's a lion that's a tiger
[18:38] wind stop wind blow
[18:40] and remember
[18:42] god wasn't looking over his shoulder
[18:47] come on
[18:48] god wasn't looking over his shoulder
[18:49] going now adam i wouldn't call that a
[18:51] tiger
[18:52] no adam was the son of god he had the
[18:54] mind of god god was working through him
[18:57] and god said that's what that'll be for
[19:00] an eternity
[19:01] adam named the animals and they'll never
[19:03] be different right
[19:05] so he had dominion genesis 1
[19:08] 26 let them
[19:11] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[19:13] and over the fowl of the air and all the
[19:15] creeping things on the earth this is
[19:17] dominion
[19:18] because remember when brother branham
[19:20] came to that mountain the storm and the
[19:23] deer and all those things remember he
[19:25] had become he was at the stage of
[19:27] adoption where it wasn't
[19:30] it wasn't god speaking it was brother
[19:32] brown speaking right yeah but it was god
[19:34] speaking you understand what i'm saying
[19:36] but god trusted what he said remember
[19:39] remember he told brother brown he said
[19:40] whatever you say
[19:42] you're out here hunting
[19:44] you're out here doing these things
[19:45] you're out here doing these things what
[19:47] do you need
[19:48] you speak it right all right now he
[19:51] wasn't right here that didn't happen in
[19:53] 1947 but remember the first message
[19:56] brother branham preached was what
[19:58] faith the substance
[20:01] last sermon he preached was
[20:03] bob communion
[20:05] all right first sermon was faith last
[20:08] sermon
[20:09] that's
[20:10] the communion with god right there amen
[20:13] sure your communion with god here it's
[20:14] like like bob and i were discussing just
[20:16] a few minutes ago
[20:18] you have a you know your your wife and
[20:20] you have a the only way i can understand
[20:22] god is by natural things
[20:24] yeah
[20:26] i mean you even when you say
[20:27] supernatural there's a natural in there
[20:30] right supernatural so it had to come we
[20:32] had to learn it naturally
[20:34] like you and your wife you know you your
[20:36] wedding night you consummate the wedding
[20:38] and and it's you know it's like the love
[20:39] between you and god but remember then
[20:42] you learn each other on through the time
[20:44] right
[20:44] that's not just that's not just it
[20:47] you learn
[20:48] you learn to love and learn to do these
[20:51] things same thing with god
[20:53] because your relationship with god
[20:54] starts at the new birth
[20:56] right
[20:57] all right it doesn't stop there
[21:00] it continues on
[21:02] it continues on until it comes to the
[21:05] headstone to where
[21:07] it's like it's like the analogy we use
[21:10] somewhere that
[21:11] uh a little boy five or six years old
[21:15] he's a human
[21:16] he has a brain
[21:19] you know take brother west back there
[21:20] take him your boy
[21:22] he's a human
[21:24] right he's got two eyes on it we got out
[21:26] now you got two eyes on each side of his
[21:27] nose he's got on each side of his nose
[21:31] but now give him your car keys let him
[21:33] drive you home today
[21:35] no no don't shake your head he's a human
[21:37] he's just the same thing you are
[21:40] he ain't got a hairy face like you do
[21:41] but soon he will
[21:44] but give him your car keys
[21:46] he's got every faculty you got
[21:50] right
[21:51] he's got everything you got he's a human
[21:53] being
[21:54] he's your son
[21:56] you should trust him driving a car
[22:00] same way with god
[22:02] god's not going to give you the keys to
[22:03] his car right here
[22:06] he's going to give you the keys to the
[22:07] car up here right he's not going to give
[22:10] you the keys down here yet you are a son
[22:13] right right
[22:14] robby how many people kids have you
[22:16] stopped driving a car at five years old
[22:19] i hope none
[22:22] you stop adults right
[22:24] okay so then they are able
[22:28] by watching by what's instilled in man
[22:31] we come to a place where we say what 16
[22:34] years old you are mature enough to
[22:36] handle driving a car but now let's go a
[22:38] little bit further you take that 16 year
[22:41] old and you don't give him the key to a
[22:43] 250 mile an hour dragster
[22:47] same car
[22:49] four wheels
[22:50] steering wheel brakes clutch
[22:53] it just goes faster
[22:55] so what does he have to do when he turns
[22:57] 16 he has to learn
[22:59] and grow right
[23:01] to drive faster and that's the same way
[23:03] with god that's the way i see it
[23:06] when i started to baby form with god
[23:08] when i started at faith
[23:10] god give me all the things i needed i
[23:12] was always i was a kid i was crying
[23:15] but i was unskillful
[23:18] i only could drink milk
[23:22] but you know what there was a desire in
[23:23] my heart to eat strong meat
[23:25] because see i could look
[23:27] i could look at the adults and say man
[23:29] i'd rather eat that steak
[23:33] than to eat these peas ground up in this
[23:35] baby food
[23:38] you eat right
[23:41] i mean how many of you would want to eat
[23:44] ground up green peas right now
[23:47] no
[23:48] but you know what at one time that's all
[23:50] you can handle right same way with god
[23:52] that's why i said why don't we try to
[23:54] grow with god as the same way that we
[23:56] see ourself grow up because even the
[23:58] godhead can be understood by the things
[24:00] you see
[24:01] all right
[24:02] same thing with adoption they never
[24:04] adopted a little boy that boy had to
[24:06] come to an age to where he could be
[24:09] responsible enough to handle what you
[24:11] give him
[24:12] same way with god
[24:14] same way with god he's not and you know
[24:16] what he doesn't expect you to drive a
[24:18] car at five years old right he don't
[24:20] expect you to do the things at five that
[24:22] you you know that you would do at 50 or
[24:25] whatever
[24:26] but with god there's no
[24:28] you know there's no time limit with god
[24:30] right i've seen some 18 year old people
[24:33] that come into the message get born
[24:35] again be on fire with god that's got a
[24:37] lot more understanding than the people
[24:39] spending the message for 30 years or 40
[24:41] years but it's what but you know what
[24:43] it's what you make yourself available
[24:45] for that's what we're trying to do here
[24:47] is we're trying to make this available
[24:49] where we can all grow
[24:51] don't leave nobody behind
[24:53] we want everybody to grow but there's
[24:55] one thing for sure
[24:57] we're not all going to get to the same
[24:59] place at the same time
[25:01] right so just understand that just to
[25:03] understand that and you know what there
[25:05] are some 16 year olds that i wouldn't
[25:07] give a car key to
[25:10] yet the law legally says he can drive or
[25:12] she a lot of sheath
[25:16] but
[25:17] i wouldn't give them the keys why
[25:19] because of the maturity
[25:21] because of their background because of
[25:23] their training that's the same way with
[25:25] god
[25:27] we need to be skilled in the word of god
[25:29] and the only way we can be skilled in
[25:30] the word of god is to hear it
[25:33] let it come from here down to here
[25:36] i like we're sharing
[25:39] sharon
[25:40] sharon says not up here
[25:42] down here right and that's right right
[25:45] you get it all up here but when it don't
[25:47] go down to here i like that very simple
[25:49] not here here that's what we're trying
[25:51] to do with this this is not head
[25:53] knowledge of god right this is the
[25:55] knowledge that god puts in here that he
[25:58] wants it to work out he wants to uh and
[26:00] i don't think i have it but we'll read
[26:02] it later on he wants us to be a walking
[26:05] instrumentality of god right that's what
[26:07] he wants for all of us
[26:09] but we got to start with a foundation
[26:12] of faith
[26:14] all right now so if these things are a
[26:16] requirement
[26:17] we can't skip one
[26:20] we've got to grow in grace and knowledge
[26:22] we've been here 50-something years since
[26:24] the prophet preached
[26:26] we're still here
[26:27] the reason we're still healed is because
[26:29] i'm not ready
[26:31] i'm not ready that's the reason i'm
[26:33] still here we're all still here because
[26:35] i'm not ready because remember we all go
[26:36] together right
[26:38] so i'm blaming me you need to blame you
[26:42] okay i'm not gonna blame you because i
[26:43] don't know where you are you got to
[26:44] blame you and if you're still sitting
[26:46] here and you're not raptured you need to
[26:48] blame you
[26:52] praise the lord india
[26:55] so now then we look and we see that the
[26:57] headstone was rejected now to take that
[27:00] away is is not that god went away
[27:02] somewhere
[27:04] man's ideas took that away that's right
[27:07] right
[27:08] god didn't ever leave
[27:10] but the fullness of god
[27:13] left
[27:15] it always let me try to put it right
[27:17] it's always been in the word
[27:19] but down through the time in in saying
[27:22] nicea
[27:24] you know the first three church ages
[27:25] they had all these things working in
[27:26] their life right right all right so you
[27:29] get to the fourth church age which is
[27:30] columba you see that they have they
[27:32] eroded it they eat all the effects of
[27:34] the word down and then there had to be a
[27:36] restoration so the head like i said this
[27:39] morning the head had to become a corner
[27:41] right right he didn't leave he just come
[27:44] down here and you know what he's done
[27:45] he's hiding himself sure
[27:48] he's hiding himself down here in the
[27:50] foundation
[27:52] so that he can grow right back up
[27:54] if a corn of wheat die
[27:57] and go on the ground
[27:58] it'll bring forth much fruit
[28:00] but if you don't put it in the ground
[28:03] it'll bite it alone right he would have
[28:05] been the only one could come to maturity
[28:07] but it's not true he wants us all to
[28:09] come to maturity all right so he had to
[28:12] start down here brother donnie had to
[28:13] give us an example that same example
[28:15] that walked on the earth had to be the
[28:17] very first baby example that we have
[28:20] down here amen all right do everybody
[28:22] understand that so when you see
[28:23] cornerstone and headstone sure he's the
[28:25] headstone of the church
[28:26] he's the head which is what the
[28:28] intelligence everything that happened
[28:30] from the neck down has to happen from
[28:32] what's up here right all right
[28:35] amen amen all right has to happen up
[28:38] here first and it goes through here down
[28:39] into your body same way with god it all
[28:42] starts with the head
[28:43] then it flows down through the body
[28:46] because remember sister shepherd's dream
[28:47] they were pouring the water in and the
[28:49] water was boiling out
[28:51] the trash
[28:52] being washed by the water of the word
[28:54] the water was running it out
[28:57] and doing away with our contrary virtue
[29:01] contrary knowledge i said contrary to
[29:03] god our contrary temperance he's burning
[29:06] or pouring or boiling all that brother
[29:08] brown said boiling boiling all that
[29:10] trash out and remember the trash was
[29:12] running down the side of that mountain
[29:15] same way with you and i he's trying to
[29:16] burn the trash out
[29:18] so it's run down the side of the
[29:19] mountain but there's only one way to do
[29:22] that
[29:23] and that's by the new birth right no
[29:26] other way you can you can you know you
[29:29] can make this thing alcoholics anonymous
[29:31] you can suppress that demon so much
[29:36] that's what's happening now
[29:38] these people leaving the message the
[29:40] people turning the message down
[29:42] they never was born again right
[29:46] you can't leave the apex of the of the
[29:48] word
[29:49] and and say that you're born again right
[29:52] so what they done was though just trudy
[29:54] they just suppressed all that back stuff
[29:56] they just suppressed all that down
[29:59] and but you know what happened
[30:01] it's still there
[30:03] still you hide it
[30:05] right it don't go away
[30:07] so i said this this
[30:10] christianity is not alcoholics anonymous
[30:14] and for those of you that don't know and
[30:15] hadn't been through the program
[30:17] alcoholics anonymous is once an
[30:19] alcoholic always an alcoholic you've
[30:21] just got to suppress that thing you've
[30:24] got to do things different you've got no
[30:26] no i don't believe that brother brown
[30:27] said remember that girl georgie carter i
[30:29] believe it was or one of the girls
[30:31] uh that he said she was an alcoholic
[30:34] she was a prostitute he said now she's a
[30:38] wife
[30:39] she's
[30:40] testifying god and she's a christian
[30:42] woman same woman
[30:44] same woman right same person you see but
[30:47] the power of god took that old nature
[30:50] out
[30:50] okay
[30:51] we listen so i was gonna try to say that
[30:53] this morning everybody says you know
[30:55] they talk about the seed being in you
[30:56] and that's that desire listen people
[30:59] if you're a human being
[31:02] god put every human being from adam on
[31:04] this earth with a desire in their heart
[31:07] to serve god
[31:09] you know what the prophet of god said
[31:11] every person on this earth he gave you a
[31:14] desire to serve god now what you did
[31:16] with it and i did with it we took that
[31:18] desire and we went to smoking we took
[31:21] that desire desire we went to drinking
[31:23] we took that desire and went to xyz it
[31:25] doesn't matter
[31:27] but it was a desire to serve god to
[31:29] begin with
[31:31] it's that old nature that we lean to
[31:34] that's contrary to any of this
[31:38] our old nature has a temper
[31:43] don't have a lot of patience definitely
[31:45] ain't got no godliness
[31:46] you understand what i'm saying so what
[31:48] it has to be it has to be not that we
[31:50] suppress it it has to be a total
[31:52] conversion
[31:57] justified is the path we take to start
[32:00] with justification
[32:02] all right we turn from our old sin and
[32:04] we start in a new direction
[32:06] all right we'll get into that in just a
[32:08] minute but let's just to review all this
[32:09] we talk about the cornerstone now we're
[32:11] coming up to where we were talking about
[32:13] faith this morning and we re we read the
[32:16] quote where brother bynum said he said
[32:18] leave it right there we said or he said
[32:21] he said that
[32:22] your faith is going to determine how
[32:24] high you go right okay it's your faith
[32:27] but what what you're going to have to
[32:28] have is
[32:30] is you're going to have to have faith in
[32:32] what a five-fold ministry says
[32:36] didn't i read ephesians 4 he gave some
[32:38] apostles prophets pastors teaching and
[32:40] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[32:42] saints all right so that's how we got to
[32:45] get it
[32:46] we got to listen
[32:47] you got to hear can you get it from the
[32:49] prophet he said you couldn't
[32:52] he said i give it to the ministers and
[32:54] they break it down right okay
[32:58] that's why you know and and i don't want
[33:00] you to get this wrong but brother tim
[33:01] and i were talking about that because
[33:03] a lot of people are
[33:05] are beginning to realize
[33:08] and brother dale's always taught us this
[33:10] that brother branham was not our
[33:12] absolute
[33:14] you hear what i'm saying let me finish
[33:17] because brother branham was a human and
[33:19] he made mistakes just like i make
[33:21] mistakes
[33:22] but the word he brought amen
[33:24] but now remember not the word he brought
[33:27] on paper
[33:30] anybody okay
[33:31] not the word he brought on paper because
[33:34] the word he brought on paper is just
[33:36] what i said this morning they got
[33:37] polygamy
[33:39] two soul
[33:40] seven thunder it all comes out of the
[33:42] message the written part of the what
[33:44] brother branham said they're making all
[33:46] kind of denominations same way with god
[33:49] when god was on earth he wrote there was
[33:51] four books written matthew mark luke and
[33:52] john
[33:54] 30 000 denominations have come from that
[33:57] four those four gospels
[34:00] so it's not the written word that's an
[34:01] absolute
[34:04] it's the written word revealed amen it's
[34:06] the absolute amen so the written word
[34:09] revealed being the absolute we can take
[34:12] matthew mark luke and john and see that
[34:14] the prophet had to come to bring that
[34:16] together take the loose ends put them
[34:18] all back together and say look this is
[34:20] what jesus was saying right amen amen
[34:24] so it's not that that we we
[34:27] brother branham in in the purity of the
[34:29] messages are absolute
[34:32] right right
[34:34] because it's like brother william said
[34:36] the word
[34:38] is the highest apex of god so that's our
[34:40] absolute is the word of god revealed
[34:45] like god because you know what the
[34:46] baptist says god revealed me a trinity
[34:49] out of the bible right
[34:50] no he didn't
[34:53] right he didn't
[34:54] god didn't reveal the trinity to anybody
[34:57] right never was in the bible but man
[35:00] takes that out that's why the prophet
[35:01] had to come
[35:03] to straighten those things out get them
[35:05] all back together and you know what just
[35:06] like we talked about zerubbabel that's
[35:08] what he done he swept that thing off and
[35:10] started again
[35:12] he told the pentecostals he said he said
[35:14] you got to go through these three stages
[35:15] of grace he said you just don't come
[35:16] right here and go well i got the holy
[35:18] ghost because i shouted and spoke in
[35:19] tongues whatever
[35:21] that ain't it
[35:22] zerubbabel swept that foundation and
[35:24] started again and built what god started
[35:27] in the beginning that prophet of god
[35:30] brought us
[35:31] the whole apex of the word
[35:33] amen
[35:34] the prophet of god brought us that whole
[35:36] apex of the word
[35:38] but what our problem is is satan got
[35:40] into that
[35:42] and started injecting
[35:44] two souls seventh on you name the
[35:46] doctrine it doesn't matter
[35:48] because you know what that's not the
[35:49] doctrines
[35:51] doctrines like that never come through
[35:52] here
[35:56] now listen hold on a minute though
[36:00] babies
[36:02] can't be shook
[36:04] mature
[36:06] men cannot be shook women
[36:08] but babies can be shook right
[36:10] right
[36:13] let's read something here
[36:17] let's read number four we're going to
[36:19] start
[36:22] we're not going to read that go to quote
[36:24] number four brother bob
[36:29] we talked about this morning
[36:31] that uh thank you we talked about this
[36:33] morning we have to go through
[36:34] justification sanctification and baptism
[36:36] of holy ghost all right so here we're
[36:38] going to see we saw the analogy that
[36:40] brother brown made about the
[36:43] cup
[36:44] or the glass all right
[36:45] so watch
[36:47] what is redemption redemption is not
[36:49] replacement so we fail as human beings
[36:51] we fail
[36:52] so god's got to restore us back all
[36:55] right so in the restoring back sure the
[36:58] pure word of god had to come through the
[37:00] prophet of god
[37:02] to make us help us understand what god's
[37:05] really what he really was talking about
[37:07] so the plan of redemption is going to be
[37:09] just like the earth
[37:12] right just like the natural earth has
[37:14] got to go through it the spiritual earth
[37:16] has got to go through it first because
[37:17] remember
[37:18] who fell first the earth or man
[37:21] man fell first
[37:22] so everything under him fell
[37:25] in romans eight it says they became
[37:26] subject
[37:28] to the one that it failed they came
[37:29] subject when adam fell the the
[37:32] the animals fell
[37:34] all nature fell well now to take us back
[37:37] he can't start with the earth he's got
[37:39] to start with the one it fell from it's
[37:41] got to start with man when man gets back
[37:43] to the place
[37:45] then nature comes back to the place all
[37:48] right so that's what we're going to see
[37:49] right here and then we'll get started a
[37:51] little bit into
[37:52] into justification sanctification i know
[37:54] it's i know it's simple but sometimes we
[37:57] really need to understand are we really
[37:59] justified right are we really sanctified
[38:02] and honestly do we really have the holy
[38:04] ghost where we can start and begin for
[38:05] god to work in in our life all right so
[38:08] and notice how god makes plain this is
[38:10] on future home 1964. god makes plain to
[38:13] us his plan of redemption oh this just
[38:15] thrilled my soul when i saw it how he
[38:18] makes plain to us here now his plan of
[38:20] redemption
[38:21] now compare that we see with our compare
[38:23] what we see that's what i just told you
[38:25] compare what we see with our own eyes
[38:28] what we see the natural things that we
[38:30] see what god has done to redeem his
[38:33] world he's done the same plan to redeem
[38:35] his people
[38:36] for the unchangeable god changes not in
[38:39] any of his plan or anything such a
[38:42] glorious thing
[38:43] how he led us to himself to a tabernacle
[38:46] in us by three stages of grace
[38:49] just like he's led the world in three
[38:51] stages to come to the world
[38:53] as god will come to the world after it's
[38:56] gone through three different stages of
[38:57] purification that's exactly how he comes
[39:00] to us through three stages of grace i
[39:03] taught that at the beginning see there's
[39:05] a doctrine in the in the message and i
[39:07] know a lot some of you heard it but
[39:08] somebody hadn't that brother branham
[39:09] changed his way he in other words when
[39:12] the seals open he got a greater
[39:14] revelation and it was just to believe
[39:15] the message
[39:17] that was a new birth we've all heard
[39:18] that one or the ones that had heard it
[39:20] know what i'm talking about
[39:22] but what do you say right here
[39:25] i taught that at the beginning
[39:27] i've never changed since
[39:29] why has he never changed since it's
[39:31] god's word
[39:33] you have to keep your threes together
[39:35] your sevens or twelves the numerics of
[39:37] the bible must run perfect or you'll get
[39:39] your picture all messed up if you can't
[39:42] understand it just keep praying you
[39:44] watch it'll cut right in exactly god is
[39:46] perfected in threes
[39:49] see notice how god makes it plain to us
[39:52] and if that wasn't a great confirmation
[39:54] a good a great loving blessing from god
[39:56] when i see this and see that since a boy
[40:00] first time ever christ dealt with me
[40:02] i've still always taught those three
[40:04] stages now where'd he change
[40:08] where did he change he said since i was
[40:11] a boy i've taught these three stages of
[40:13] grace notice if it isn't true now
[40:16] now the first step
[40:17] is repentance toward god right
[40:20] and then follows after that is water
[40:22] baptism water baptism repent
[40:25] it says repent first repent and be
[40:27] baptized in the name of jesus christ see
[40:28] water baptism follows
[40:30] showing that the repentance was genuine
[40:33] amen that's been our problem we've tried
[40:35] to get them to the water without getting
[40:36] them to repent
[40:38] if you get them to repent and then get
[40:40] them to the water
[40:42] much better much better line up there
[40:44] because it says here repent be baptized
[40:46] see what about this and follows
[40:48] showing that repentance was genuine or
[40:50] to remit our past sins
[40:53] that has nothing to do
[40:55] with future sin
[40:57] everybody understand that say amen
[40:59] all right it only remits repent and be
[41:02] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[41:03] what for remission
[41:05] taking away of past sin has nothing to
[41:08] do with the future right right
[41:11] just your sin has been chopped off what
[41:13] you did now stop right there for a
[41:15] moment and it's a whole nother it's a
[41:17] whole another sermon but what he's doing
[41:18] is when he talks about future home
[41:20] with the earth for some of you that
[41:22] don't have a a background like the
[41:25] others the earth went through a water
[41:27] baptism right
[41:28] in noah's day
[41:30] right the flood
[41:32] washed the past sin of the earth off
[41:36] but remember sin still came across the
[41:38] ark
[41:39] once justification in the type of the
[41:42] world being you know everybody was
[41:44] killed except eight people
[41:46] right
[41:47] eight people was all that was saved on
[41:49] this whole world and the bible says as
[41:51] it was in the days of noah so it is
[41:52] today so there was as many people and
[41:54] more on the earth then as they are now
[41:56] right so it took and destroyed everybody
[41:58] but eight people
[42:00] but the very next day that they got off
[42:03] the ark
[42:04] noah made a sacrifice
[42:07] showing that the sin had come on across
[42:09] the earth why do you need a sacrifice if
[42:11] there's no sin
[42:12] so what justification does it chopped
[42:14] off their past sin
[42:16] same way with rahab the harlot how do
[42:18] you think she married that israeli
[42:19] general
[42:22] woman where are your accusers you know
[42:24] what jesus said to the woman they threw
[42:25] down in front of him woman where's your
[42:27] accusers he had to get rid of her
[42:29] accusers same way with rahab everybody
[42:31] was killed in the whole city except her
[42:33] and her family so all the accusers
[42:34] because remember she was a harlot right
[42:37] so she had friends
[42:39] you understand what i mean
[42:40] if they were all killed
[42:42] all of her witnesses were gone
[42:44] okay same way with you and i we did it
[42:48] we did it that woman that was in front
[42:50] of jesus when she was caught in the act
[42:52] of adultery she did the act
[42:55] he just didn't see it
[42:57] jesus didn't see it
[42:59] he couldn't but now if he had if though
[43:00] some of those people would have stayed
[43:02] there
[43:04] he would have had to let him stone her
[43:06] but he got rid of her witnesses
[43:08] and he said
[43:10] i didn't see you do it that's what he
[43:12] does now
[43:14] our sins are covered
[43:16] not just covered they're taken away
[43:19] and that's the same way with the earth
[43:20] the earth sins was wiped off but
[43:22] remember they started sinning the day
[43:25] noah got drunk they come on down and you
[43:27] know they started back sinning again
[43:28] right same way with justification it
[43:30] just chops off what happened in the past
[43:33] and then you got you keep walking
[43:36] you keep walking
[43:38] with number one
[43:40] having faith
[43:42] you got to believe that god cut your
[43:44] sins off if not you're just dragging
[43:46] them with you
[43:48] so see it starts all with faith
[43:49] believing what god said
[43:52] having a conscience of your sin but it
[43:53] being chopped off you can't repent for
[43:56] what adam done you've never done it adam
[43:58] did you just get forgiveness for what
[44:00] you've done
[44:01] the old nature is still there right okay
[44:04] all right the old nature is still there
[44:06] now look if you've got the old nature
[44:08] still there how's the room for this
[44:13] light and darkness can't dwell in the
[44:14] same place
[44:15] okay so you still got darkness you can't
[44:17] have light so see there's no way you can
[44:19] come up this statue of a perfect man
[44:20] having the old nature that you had
[44:23] before amen you can't have that old
[44:25] nature that old nature's got to be dead
[44:27] not put in a closet right we'll get to
[44:29] that in a minute then secondly
[44:31] come sanctification which sets your mind
[44:34] in order for holiness
[44:36] to think right taken away sanctification
[44:39] is a compound greek word which means
[44:41] cleaned and set aside
[44:44] for service
[44:45] not in service
[44:47] see it's sanctification you shouldn't be
[44:49] taking communion you shouldn't be you
[44:50] can't be deacon there's a lot of things
[44:52] you can't do because you're set aside
[44:54] for service you're not put in service
[44:56] yet right okay putting in service for
[44:58] god is putting you in the family amen
[45:01] right here
[45:02] this is what you get this is the
[45:04] household of god
[45:06] all right
[45:07] the rest outside the household of the
[45:09] devil and remember by that picture i
[45:11] showed you justification sanctification
[45:13] was outside the pyramid
[45:16] you're not in the family till you have
[45:17] faith until you help until you're born
[45:18] again all right second comes
[45:20] sanctification which sets our mind in
[45:21] order for holiness to think right take
[45:22] it away sanctification is a compound
[45:24] greek word which means cleaned and set
[45:26] aside for service
[45:28] now what in a type of the earth what
[45:30] happened that what did he say when jesus
[45:33] christ died on the cross
[45:35] he spilled his blood on the earth to
[45:38] cleanse and claim
[45:41] the bodies that were in the earth and
[45:43] all the bodies were in the earth right
[45:45] right to cleanse and claim the earth
[45:47] jesus shed his blood
[45:49] as a type of that sanctification but now
[45:51] remember
[45:52] did that do away with sin
[45:56] they just kept right on sinning
[45:58] 99 of the world never even knew jesus
[46:00] was on the earth
[46:02] amen
[46:04] then the next comes the baptism of the
[46:07] fire and holy ghost
[46:09] that god might dwell in us
[46:12] and the fire of god cleanses our heart
[46:14] from sin
[46:15] and puts the holy ghost inside i thought
[46:17] you already had it
[46:22] no you don't already have it you weren't
[46:24] born with the holy ghost i'm sorry
[46:29] naturally born right
[46:32] spiritually born yes naturally born no
[46:35] you had to receive the holy ghost
[46:37] listen why can't god come on this earth
[46:39] now
[46:43] why can't god come on this earth now
[46:46] all of his people are here he's hearing
[46:47] you and me
[46:49] why can't he physically step on this
[46:51] earth
[46:52] this earth has not been
[46:54] burned off
[46:56] for him to step his foot on this earth
[46:58] same way with you when you were in sin
[47:00] you didn't have the holy ghost right you
[47:02] didn't have the fire of god in you you
[47:04] had to fire the devil
[47:05] right
[47:06] i speak for all of us
[47:10] amen
[47:11] brother branham said he used to wash his
[47:12] car on sunday and watching people go by
[47:14] now if he had to fire god in him he had
[47:16] been in church right right you say a
[47:18] prophet yeah remember he was born a
[47:20] prophet right but he had to receive the
[47:21] holy ghost just like you did right man i
[47:24] said just like you did
[47:26] that's what he said
[47:28] then next comes the baptism of fire in
[47:29] the holy ghost that god might dwell in
[47:31] us in us
[47:33] and the fire of god cleanses our heart
[47:34] from sin and puts the holy ghost inside
[47:37] then we bring forth the same life
[47:40] that this did
[47:42] because that's in us
[47:44] notice in the natural birth when a woman
[47:45] gives birth to a baby the natural life
[47:48] types to spiritual life
[47:50] now let me ask you a question on that
[47:51] one
[47:52] when the baby's in the mother's womb is
[47:54] it alive
[47:56] no it's not
[47:58] brother branham said it's nothing but
[48:00] wiggling muscles just like an animal
[48:03] if you need a quote i'll bring it to you
[48:06] but we know that
[48:07] right it is not a human being
[48:10] when it's in the womb that's what the
[48:12] prophet of god said and i believe it too
[48:14] because there's not
[48:15] there's not there's there's a life being
[48:17] brought forth right
[48:20] but that's just nothing but just the
[48:23] same as a as an animal at that point
[48:26] that's what he said and i agree with him
[48:28] when a woman gives birth to a baby the
[48:30] natural birth first thing happened
[48:31] breaking the water now my point was
[48:34] if we come here with an eternal life
[48:36] already in us he can't type that
[48:39] all right
[48:41] everybody understand what i said
[48:43] he can't type that
[48:44] because if he types it like this
[48:47] then the baby's already alive in the
[48:48] womb the baby's not alive in the womb
[48:50] the baby's not alive until the baby gets
[48:52] here after the water breaks after the
[48:55] blood comes then the spirit the life
[48:58] right
[48:59] grab the little felon spank him and away
[49:02] he goes screaming water blood spirit and
[49:04] now when a baby is born into the kingdom
[49:05] of god he comes the same way
[49:11] how about that
[49:13] now notice sanctification the third
[49:15] stage second stage he's meant the second
[49:17] stage of it cleanses the mind sets the
[49:20] heart the mind of the heart in order of
[49:22] holiness a man can repent of sins and
[49:24] he's still thinking of well maybe he's
[49:26] an immoral man every more looking woman
[49:29] he finds is still there maybe he's a
[49:30] drunkard every time he smells a drink
[49:32] it's still there see
[49:33] but then when he gets sanctified that
[49:35] cleanses that desire out of him
[49:39] see it takes the one of it away
[49:41] he can still be tempted sure
[49:45] but he takes the one of it away still
[49:48] but look still he's not right yet right
[49:50] right you're not in this yet
[49:53] you're not in the family of god yet now
[49:55] look god knows whether you go on we'll
[49:57] go on or not but you don't
[49:58] right
[50:00] god knows who's he is
[50:02] you just don't know it you got to live
[50:04] it you got to go through the experience
[50:06] if not it's not your experience right
[50:10] pretty simple
[50:11] it takes one of it away still he's not
[50:13] right yet
[50:15] then he is baptized with the holy ghost
[50:17] and fire cleansed burnt out
[50:20] cleaned up and then put into the service
[50:23] of god
[50:24] sanctification only sets them aside for
[50:28] service all right
[50:30] everybody understand that say amen amen
[50:32] okay and notice just exactly how that
[50:34] come the message come
[50:36] martin luther justification john wesley
[50:38] sanctification of the pentecostals the
[50:39] baptism of the holy ghost the messages
[50:42] that's where there can't be no more ages
[50:44] of it see we're at the end time three
[50:46] stages baptism cleans the heart with the
[50:49] holy ghost glory
[50:51] that's what i mean about clean it cleans
[50:53] it takes that old nature and kills it
[50:55] right
[50:56] doesn't kill your soul
[50:58] your soul's you
[51:00] it it burns the nature off of that thing
[51:03] that's contrary to all this
[51:05] we're all born contrary to god right i
[51:07] just i just wish we'd
[51:13] i can see
[51:15] it burns my heart i can see more
[51:17] of
[51:18] how that it would be so easy to be born
[51:21] with an eternal seed and that would be
[51:22] just easier and and it would there would
[51:25] be no overcoming and no fighting you
[51:28] just always was this wonderful thing no
[51:30] i was
[51:31] going to hell right that's right i was
[51:34] going to hell
[51:36] and god
[51:38] amen came to me and said hey you want
[51:40] some of me
[51:42] and you either going to say yes or no
[51:46] and then if i said yes he said hey look
[51:48] at all these things i got for you
[51:50] how much better is that brother richard
[51:51] marlowe how much better is that in my
[51:54] heart to know that i had an experience
[51:56] right that i was on my way to hell and i
[51:58] had an experience with an eternal god
[52:01] glory
[52:02] and he thought so much of me he came
[52:04] down and burnt that thing out of me
[52:07] and then he put himself inside of me
[52:10] hallelujah amen
[52:15] benny told me not to move around much
[52:23] 101 kind of wake you up a little bit
[52:26] now he's called the church through
[52:27] justification
[52:29] called it through sanctification and
[52:30] then filled it with the holy ghost and
[52:32] fire
[52:33] and he took it through a process
[52:35] that he himself the holy spirit himself
[52:39] the son of god could dwell in the human
[52:41] heart
[52:43] now look it's not the human heart right
[52:46] the heart of the person is i'll read it
[52:47] in a minute
[52:49] now it has to go through that
[52:51] before
[52:52] he can come into it
[52:57] i thought it was already there
[53:03] no people
[53:04] we were all
[53:06] born in sin right shaping iniquity
[53:09] come forth into this world there's only
[53:12] one man that wasn't born contrary to god
[53:14] right that was god himself
[53:16] amen everybody else was born contrary to
[53:19] god
[53:20] because sex was not the way we were
[53:21] supposed to get here
[53:23] right
[53:24] right
[53:25] spoken word like it was when jesus come
[53:28] notice he done the world where that
[53:30] bride is going to live in the same way
[53:33] his same plan
[53:35] of salvation
[53:37] everybody got that glory
[53:39] the same plan
[53:41] now let's go to number five
[53:45] angel of the lord 1953 brother braham
[53:47] said the new birth
[53:49] is an experience
[53:52] it is a gift of god right
[53:55] it's the seal of your faith
[53:59] because peter doesn't say add to god's
[54:01] faith peter says add to your faith
[54:06] in other words add to what you believe
[54:09] in virtue
[54:11] add to what you believe in knowledge
[54:14] right all right
[54:15] the holy spirit is a seal ephesians 4 30
[54:18] grieve not the holy spirit of god for by
[54:19] your seal
[54:20] until the day
[54:22] of your redemption right so put the um
[54:25] last picture back up there brother bob
[54:29] right there
[54:30] so we have to go through justification
[54:31] what is justification just to start over
[54:33] again what is justification turning
[54:35] around and going in another direction
[54:38] right god i'm i'm tired of living this i
[54:40] look people
[54:44] if i went through it you're gonna have
[54:46] to go through it right right
[54:48] if i'm a son of god and you're a son of
[54:49] god or a daughter of god if i went
[54:50] through it you got to go through the
[54:51] same thing right right
[54:53] i went through that right there
[54:56] i'm tired of what i was
[54:58] i don't want to do that no more
[55:00] god says okay
[55:02] but that's not all
[55:04] i come to church one night
[55:07] stood right here and give my heart to
[55:08] the lord
[55:11] now
[55:12] i may be a little different than some of
[55:13] you because i had a background
[55:16] as far as that goes being different i
[55:18] had a background when i was 14 12 11 10
[55:21] i knew nothing but this message
[55:23] i was raised in this church
[55:25] sharon was raised in this church esther
[55:27] some of the ones that are here we were
[55:29] raised in this church
[55:31] but remember
[55:32] that don't give you free pass
[55:35] to the rapture
[55:37] sharon was telling me she said 30 years
[55:39] 30 years well sister 20 years i
[55:43] did my thing
[55:45] raised in the message knew what the
[55:46] message said
[55:48] but there was never
[55:50] a true
[55:51] justification
[55:53] there was always that little will i'll
[55:55] fall back over here
[55:57] but when i come to that point to where i
[55:59] was done with my past life
[56:02] i believe i came into true justification
[56:04] now i believe my sanctification may have
[56:06] come quicker than yours because i
[56:08] believe god had you know a work for me
[56:09] to do same way with you
[56:12] but see all the desire of all the things
[56:15] that i'd done like chewing tobacco and
[56:16] all the things that i did it went away
[56:18] that day
[56:19] so i may have went a little bit quicker
[56:20] because you got to remember one thing
[56:23] the
[56:23] the people at the 120 in the upper room
[56:26] when they received the holy ghost
[56:28] it quickened all that word that they
[56:30] held
[56:31] and they went from here
[56:33] they went from justification
[56:35] baptist whole ghost to right here
[56:38] in a very quick short period of time why
[56:41] they had a background of the word
[56:43] okay and that don't give you that don't
[56:45] give you free ticket anywhere either
[56:48] you can waste it i did for about 20
[56:50] years
[56:51] i wasted all that knowledge but it was
[56:53] nothing but human knowledge sharon it
[56:56] was up here
[56:57] it wasn't down here
[56:59] i like that that's what it was it was
[57:00] all head knowledge
[57:02] it was all i knew what the what the what
[57:04] happened in the garden i knew that water
[57:06] baptism was right i knew i knew that but
[57:08] it never got down here but this right
[57:11] here true justification sanctification
[57:13] is right here right
[57:15] so i come to a realization then i come
[57:17] to sanctification just like you're gonna
[57:18] have to come to sanctification where the
[57:20] unclean spirit goes out of you
[57:24] okay remember we preached the sermon not
[57:27] too long ago on
[57:28] ezekiel where it talks about
[57:30] a new heart
[57:32] okay with that we got to go through that
[57:34] again
[57:35] right now let's go to number six
[57:37] i'll let brother branham explain it
[57:39] better than i can
[57:41] number six why some people can't keep
[57:43] the victory in 1957
[57:45] yes that's what we need today is the
[57:47] experience of the new birth
[57:49] now i want you to watch the order that
[57:51] ezekiel brought it he said i'll give you
[57:52] a new heart
[57:54] i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put
[57:57] my spirit in you now how many is that
[58:00] three
[58:01] three processes of grace
[58:04] ezekiel taught it before anybody else
[58:06] did
[58:09] i'll give you a new spirit and put my
[58:11] spirit in your heart i want you to watch
[58:13] there's three of it a new heart i'll
[58:15] take the old stony heart away what the
[58:17] old nature
[58:19] and start working on it that's the old
[58:21] different heart you have
[58:23] and i'll give you a new spirit now many
[58:26] times there's been a terrible mistake
[58:27] the people that thought sometimes that
[58:29] that new spirit was the holy spirit
[58:32] that's why you have to be careful in
[58:34] sanctification that unclean spirit will
[58:36] go out and you'll feel good you'll start
[58:38] feeling what religious not christian
[58:39] you'll feel religious
[58:42] right i did feel religious
[58:45] but something's got to come back in
[58:47] to make you the christian
[58:49] all right
[58:50] i want everybody to see this i want
[58:52] everybody i'm kind of like uh saint
[58:54] martin was i want to know everybody in
[58:56] this church has got the new birth amen
[58:58] that's my desire that everybody not that
[59:00] i know it that you know it right right
[59:02] because if you if you know it and you
[59:04] got it i'll know it
[59:07] because you'll act like it right all
[59:10] right now many times there's been a
[59:11] terrible mistake the people who thought
[59:13] sometimes that a new spirit was the holy
[59:14] spirit because remember sanctification
[59:16] brother brown teaches on further in
[59:18] sanctification that you become part of a
[59:20] religious order right so you become
[59:22] religious
[59:24] you become part of a religious order
[59:27] but you can stay in that religion and
[59:29] die and go to hell right
[59:31] never go up the statue of a perfect man
[59:33] right all right now many times there's
[59:35] been a terrible mistake the people
[59:36] thought sometimes that the new spirit
[59:37] was the holy spirit because you know
[59:38] what that new spirit it makes you want
[59:40] to go to church it makes you want to
[59:42] read your bible it makes you want to do
[59:43] because it's a new spirit okay it's a
[59:46] new one
[59:48] that you've never had before
[59:51] but it isn't it's a new spirit
[59:54] god gives you a new why you couldn't
[59:56] even get along with yourself with your
[59:58] old spirit yeah how you going to get
[1:00:00] along with the holy ghost
[1:00:05] god had to give you a new spirit so you
[1:00:07] could get along with his spirit right
[1:00:10] and sometimes people a new heart a new
[1:00:12] heart of flesh so you'll receive it then
[1:00:14] a new spirit
[1:00:15] in that heart and then i'll put my
[1:00:17] spirit in that you see i'll explain it
[1:00:18] to man just hang on new heart new spirit
[1:00:21] my spirit three things he spoke up
[1:00:24] justification sanctification baptism
[1:00:26] holy ghost works the same way all right
[1:00:30] now many times we try to make that thing
[1:00:32] just say well as soon as you get the new
[1:00:34] spirit you quit your stealing you quit
[1:00:36] your line things like that you say oh
[1:00:38] hallelujah i got it and you find out the
[1:00:40] first time anyone crosses your path or a
[1:00:42] little bit oh mercy what a difference
[1:00:45] sure you blow up like a frog eating
[1:00:46] buckshot but let me tell you brother
[1:00:49] that's the reason you never got god's
[1:00:50] spirit that's true oh you say he stepped
[1:00:53] on my toe i'll just not put up with that
[1:00:55] all right that shows what you got in you
[1:00:57] that's true i'll put a new spirit in you
[1:01:00] and then i'll put my spirit in you
[1:01:02] now right here watch this
[1:01:04] now the heart
[1:01:06] is in the center of the emotions of the
[1:01:09] human being right
[1:01:11] anybody see that
[1:01:13] now the heart not not your not the
[1:01:15] thumping part your heart the the very
[1:01:17] person of the center of you
[1:01:20] is the center of the emotions of the
[1:01:22] human being
[1:01:24] your heart is the middle of you
[1:01:27] that's exactly right
[1:01:29] so god puts a new heart
[1:01:31] in the middle of the old man
[1:01:34] then he puts a new spirit
[1:01:36] in the middle of the new spirit
[1:01:41] three rings
[1:01:42] then he puts a new spirit in the middle
[1:01:44] a new spirit in the middle
[1:01:47] he puts a new spirit in the middle of a
[1:01:49] new spirit
[1:01:50] our heart and puts his spirit in the
[1:01:53] middle of the new spirit right
[1:01:57] one more time
[1:01:58] you confused now
[1:02:00] your heart is the middle of you
[1:02:03] so god puts a new heart in the middle of
[1:02:05] the old man
[1:02:08] then he puts a new spirit in the middle
[1:02:10] it puts a new spirit in the middle of
[1:02:12] the new spirit
[1:02:13] remember sanctification
[1:02:15] and he puts his spirit
[1:02:18] in the middle of the new spirit right so
[1:02:20] see you can have this new spirit every
[1:02:21] day of your life and die and go to hell
[1:02:23] right right
[1:02:24] right brother brown said you can have
[1:02:26] beef you can have the
[1:02:28] holy he didn't say you have the new
[1:02:29] birth
[1:02:30] no he said you can have the holy ghost
[1:02:33] anointing your spirit every day of your
[1:02:35] life and dying go to hell well that's
[1:02:36] right here but if he ever puts his
[1:02:38] spirit in the middle of that new spirit
[1:02:42] you're born again
[1:02:43] right
[1:02:44] you're done because his spirit not your
[1:02:46] spirit or not another spirit he puts his
[1:02:48] spirit in the middle of the new spirit
[1:02:51] you're born again now you're a child of
[1:02:53] god now you can grow in god now you're
[1:02:56] just beginning
[1:02:58] you're being born again amen all right
[1:03:02] everybody got that saying man amen all
[1:03:04] right
[1:03:05] now let's read number seven
[1:03:08] we'll make a few comments we'll
[1:03:12] honestly i kind of enjoy this
[1:03:15] because at least i can finish up next
[1:03:17] sunday or the next day
[1:03:20] the unfailing realities of a living god
[1:03:22] because you know if you if you're one
[1:03:24] certain if you preach just one sermon
[1:03:25] you gotta have a punchline
[1:03:27] you gotta raise it to a crescendo you
[1:03:29] know how the
[1:03:30] they got to come up you know to where
[1:03:31] the
[1:03:33] but when you when you're when you've got
[1:03:35] several days to do it or several sermons
[1:03:36] to do it you really don't have to
[1:03:38] just give you some thoughts for next
[1:03:40] week so you can think on them now look i
[1:03:42] want you to watch this
[1:03:44] the unfailing reality is the living god
[1:03:46] in 1960. brother braham said now the
[1:03:48] holy spirit will not misbehave itself in
[1:03:50] one person and behave itself in another
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:55] it will make each person come into its
[1:03:58] character
[1:04:00] because it's the spirit that leads you
[1:04:04] it brings makes you subject to its
[1:04:06] nature
[1:04:08] you don't bring it subject to your
[1:04:11] nature
[1:04:13] it makes you subject to its nature
[1:04:16] and the holy spirit makes you live and
[1:04:18] love to do it
[1:04:20] not just do's and don'ts that takes do's
[1:04:22] and don'ts out right there it makes you
[1:04:25] live and love to do it oh
[1:04:28] how you love to give up the things of
[1:04:30] the world when the holy spirit comes in
[1:04:33] how it cleans you and washes you and
[1:04:35] puts a desire in you to to to follow him
[1:04:40] and a thirst and a hunger for more of it
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:44] for more of it
[1:04:47] just bathing yourself
[1:04:49] he brings
[1:04:51] realities amen man there's more to it
[1:04:54] than just getting born again
[1:05:00] sure you get it all when you believe
[1:05:02] but you don't know what you got
[1:05:06] you just don't know what you got that's
[1:05:08] right
[1:05:10] is that simple enough to explain it that
[1:05:11] way you you get the holy ghost you get
[1:05:13] everything you need you got everything
[1:05:14] you need for your body change
[1:05:16] you just don't understand it right you
[1:05:18] just don't know how to get to it yet
[1:05:20] just same way with that boy back there
[1:05:22] the the um
[1:05:24] i had his name and i just forgot it but
[1:05:26] anyway he's got everything he needs to
[1:05:27] drive the car
[1:05:29] all the faculties he's just not mature
[1:05:31] enough to do it he hasn't understood yet
[1:05:33] what he's got exactly right right same
[1:05:36] way with you and i we've we've got the
[1:05:38] holy ghost it's like i said we've got
[1:05:39] the power
[1:05:41] if you've got the holy ghost you've got
[1:05:42] eternal life in your soul but god just
[1:05:44] doesn't want that to happen he wants to
[1:05:46] take what's in there and move it out
[1:05:50] where to go out
[1:05:51] let's read this next quote right here
[1:05:53] number eight
[1:05:54] if god be with us then where's all the
[1:05:56] miracle
[1:05:57] someone said to me one time i know the
[1:05:59] doctor was talking about a miracle that
[1:06:00] happened among a sick person he said to
[1:06:02] me preacher
[1:06:03] don't you believe if you told them
[1:06:04] people
[1:06:05] to go out and touch a tree or a post the
[1:06:07] same thing would take place
[1:06:10] i said no sir
[1:06:12] i said because you cannot have faith in
[1:06:14] touching a tree
[1:06:16] or a
[1:06:16] post faith is not that loose
[1:06:20] it's got to be based upon some noted
[1:06:24] fact
[1:06:26] you've got to know something about what
[1:06:29] you are having faith in
[1:06:33] before you can drive the car
[1:06:36] before you can have faith in it
[1:06:39] so we first must know how
[1:06:43] and what right
[1:06:44] what god's desire is what god's plan is
[1:06:47] and how to approach
[1:06:50] god by that plan
[1:06:54] and then
[1:06:55] we can walk up boldly to the throne of
[1:06:58] grace and plead what the plan is
[1:07:01] promised us
[1:07:03] everybody got that amen
[1:07:06] you cannot have faith in touching a tree
[1:07:08] or a post
[1:07:09] faith is not that loose it's got to be
[1:07:11] based on some
[1:07:13] noted fact
[1:07:16] so there's where we put the foundation
[1:07:19] of our faith
[1:07:20] on what the word of god says
[1:07:23] not just the letter of the word
[1:07:26] the revelation because remember faith is
[1:07:28] a revelation
[1:07:30] right
[1:07:31] all right let's let's go to number nine
[1:07:35] is your life worthy of the gospel 1963
[1:07:38] when this takes place the thing you'll
[1:07:40] do then you'll find out that the spirit
[1:07:41] that comes in you from the new birth you
[1:07:43] will believe and do everything that god
[1:07:45] says in his word for you to do
[1:07:48] that pretty plain
[1:07:50] and everything that the bible quotes for
[1:07:52] you to do you'll punctuate it with an
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] and you'll not stop day or night until
[1:07:59] you receive it that's right that's right
[1:08:01] and in all this time you certainly above
[1:08:04] everything bear the fruits of the spirit
[1:08:07] so you're bearing the fruits of the
[1:08:08] spirit even as you go along
[1:08:10] you say well i speak with tongues you
[1:08:12] might do that and you might not
[1:08:14] will i shout you might do that you might
[1:08:16] not but there's one sure thing you will
[1:08:18] do you'll bear the fruit of the spirit
[1:08:20] glory
[1:08:23] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:08:25] faith long suffering meekness gentleness
[1:08:26] patience your temper will not be old
[1:08:28] just remember when you get that that
[1:08:30] poisons the holy spirit away from you
[1:08:32] see
[1:08:33] when you temp your temper will not be oh
[1:08:36] just remember when you get to that that
[1:08:38] poisons the holy spirit away from you
[1:08:39] see when you get to a place that you
[1:08:41] want to fuss with everybody you come
[1:08:42] along with there's something wrong
[1:08:44] we get a place where a minister will
[1:08:46] read from the bible
[1:08:47] that it's wrong to do a certain thing
[1:08:49] and you'll just remember there's no
[1:08:51] christianity there at all
[1:08:53] that's now
[1:08:54] that's now that by their fruits you
[1:08:56] shall know them that's what jesus said
[1:08:58] see
[1:08:59] roll it on up
[1:09:01] it's the word and god said so
[1:09:04] that spirit in you will cope with that
[1:09:05] word every time
[1:09:07] because genuine holy spirit will cope
[1:09:09] with the word because the word is life
[1:09:11] and spirit
[1:09:12] now
[1:09:13] let me stop here for a moment he's not
[1:09:15] saying you'll understand every bit of it
[1:09:16] just like driving the car you won't
[1:09:18] understand it you got to be taught
[1:09:20] all right but it's there
[1:09:22] if you've got the holy spirit and you
[1:09:23] hear that word you'll not be contrary to
[1:09:26] it right you can't because look how can
[1:09:29] the word deny the word exactly right if
[1:09:31] you've got eternal life and he is the
[1:09:33] word how can the word deny the word what
[1:09:36] kind of a person would you make god
[1:09:38] that's one thing to know that you're a
[1:09:40] christian and when you come fully when
[1:09:42] you can fully agree upon every word of
[1:09:45] god amen you might say i don't
[1:09:47] understand that part but you'll never
[1:09:48] read that bible and say well i don't
[1:09:50] believe that
[1:09:52] right
[1:09:53] right i mean if you look at this bible
[1:09:54] and say well i don't believe he said
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:57] then you're an unbeliever
[1:09:59] right you're an unbelief that you make
[1:10:00] yourself an unbeliever
[1:10:02] but you can read the word of god like we
[1:10:04] all do and say well now i really don't
[1:10:06] understand that yeah
[1:10:08] i put a comma yeah
[1:10:11] because if it's in the word and you got
[1:10:13] the holy ghost somewhere along the line
[1:10:15] he's going to reveal it to you
[1:10:16] he's got to all right let's finish this
[1:10:18] let's go to christ the mystery guard
[1:10:19] reveal
[1:10:23] now this is
[1:10:24] after the seals this is one of the
[1:10:27] great messages that he preached and he
[1:10:28] preached it mainly on the new birth
[1:10:32] because christ is the mystery of god
[1:10:34] reveal but remember it's not just christ
[1:10:36] it's christ in you
[1:10:38] is the mystery the mystery of this world
[1:10:40] is is that god is now living in a group
[1:10:43] of people
[1:10:45] and we're hid from the world right
[1:10:47] amen the world will not see me anymore
[1:10:52] but you'll see me
[1:10:54] for i'll be with you
[1:10:56] even in you to the end of the world
[1:10:58] right so who's going to see him only the
[1:11:00] people that are in that faith are going
[1:11:02] to be able to see
[1:11:04] truly see what god is and where he is
[1:11:07] you know the denomination says well we
[1:11:09] think this and we think that no we know
[1:11:10] where he's at right he's in the word of
[1:11:12] god
[1:11:14] look christ in you makes him the center
[1:11:16] of life
[1:11:18] of the revelation
[1:11:19] christ's life in you
[1:11:21] makes him the center of the revelation
[1:11:24] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[1:11:27] complete revelation of christ
[1:11:29] christ in you
[1:11:31] which is what the word
[1:11:33] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:11:36] revelation
[1:11:37] of the whole thing
[1:11:39] see what god's trying to do
[1:11:41] what is the new birth then you say well
[1:11:43] brother branham what is the new birth
[1:11:45] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:11:48] personally right to you
[1:11:50] amen the revelation of who that man is
[1:11:54] personally to you not a revelation of
[1:11:56] who the prophet is not a revelation who
[1:11:57] brother daley is a revelation of jesus
[1:11:59] christ
[1:12:00] personally to you
[1:12:03] like i've said many times before
[1:12:06] and i hope you don't get this wrong i'm
[1:12:08] going to say it again
[1:12:10] when we start talking about that city
[1:12:12] it's 1500 miles square right
[1:12:15] that's the law that's a long way that
[1:12:16] city is a pretty big city
[1:12:19] that's where that's where the bride
[1:12:20] lives right that's where the chosen
[1:12:23] elected lady that's where his wife is
[1:12:25] going to live right
[1:12:27] the whole bride of jesus christ is going
[1:12:29] to live in that city
[1:12:31] the blood washed
[1:12:33] the eternal
[1:12:34] all the glorious things that we get
[1:12:37] but 99 of them percent of them people is
[1:12:39] never going to hear about william
[1:12:41] branham
[1:12:42] or have never heard of william branham
[1:12:45] are the message of the hour you
[1:12:46] understand what i'm saying what i'm
[1:12:48] saying i'm not not belittling the
[1:12:49] message what i'm saying is brother brown
[1:12:51] come to turn us back to that man right
[1:12:53] there
[1:12:54] not the revelation of william branham
[1:12:56] see a lot of people get some revelation
[1:12:57] to william branham
[1:12:59] you got to get a revelation of jesus
[1:13:00] christ and that will turn you
[1:13:03] see what is malachi 4 to do turn the
[1:13:05] heart
[1:13:07] of the children
[1:13:09] to the fathers
[1:13:12] that's what the prophet of god did he
[1:13:13] turned us
[1:13:15] he showed us really where christ was not
[1:13:18] somewhere over there what did moses do
[1:13:20] he said god's not over there he's not
[1:13:22] over here he's in he's right here right
[1:13:25] not you joined a church you shook a hand
[1:13:26] or done something different you set a
[1:13:28] creed you promised to live by a code of
[1:13:30] rules see that's the message
[1:13:32] that's the old message
[1:13:34] live by a coat of rules your dress has
[1:13:36] got to be four inches
[1:13:40] but christ the bible
[1:13:41] he is the word that was revealed to you
[1:13:44] and no matter what anybody says now see
[1:13:46] this is the part you got to hold on to
[1:13:48] because that's your foundation
[1:13:50] we'll talk a little bit about that next
[1:13:51] sunday but your foundation is you got to
[1:13:53] believe beyond anything else right you
[1:13:56] got to believe no matter what anybody
[1:13:59] says what takes place
[1:14:02] is christ right pastor priest whatever
[1:14:05] it might be it's christ in you
[1:14:08] that is the revelation that the church
[1:14:10] was what
[1:14:12] built upon so what what is this built
[1:14:14] upon
[1:14:16] the foundation the foundation is that
[1:14:18] you have got to believe
[1:14:23] faith you got to believe in something
[1:14:26] right
[1:14:29] you say well i'm lutheran i'm a baptist
[1:14:31] i'm a presbyterian that don't mean one
[1:14:33] don't mean brother brown snaps his
[1:14:35] fingers that don't mean
[1:14:36] one thing to god not a thing
[1:14:39] not a snap of your finger what is it
[1:14:41] it's christ being revealed and he is the
[1:14:44] word
[1:14:45] and when the word is revealed
[1:14:48] it doesn't just it's not just revealed
[1:14:51] it expresses itself
[1:14:54] it comes out it expresses itself see
[1:14:57] that's god's purpose for jesus christ
[1:14:58] was to express himself
[1:15:01] that was god's purpose to express
[1:15:03] himself so that we can understand a god
[1:15:05] that can't be understood how can you
[1:15:07] understand a god that created something
[1:15:08] from nothing how can you understand a
[1:15:10] god that before the eternal he was
[1:15:12] eternal
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:14] how can you understand that you can't
[1:15:16] but when he come down condescended
[1:15:18] itself to jesus christ i can understand
[1:15:20] that right and i can understand the one
[1:15:22] that created the world lived in that
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] and that was my savior
[1:15:28] that god came see so now he's
[1:15:30] condescended so that we can see
[1:15:32] that great god's purpose for jesus
[1:15:34] christ was to express himself to take
[1:15:36] his own laws and live by his laws cun
[1:15:39] and fulfill his law by death and christ
[1:15:41] god died in the flesh in order to
[1:15:44] condemn sin in the flesh that he might
[1:15:46] bring to himself a glorious bride
[1:15:49] redeemed back that will believe only in
[1:15:52] the word of god and not swap it like eve
[1:15:55] did for intellectual conception of man
[1:15:58] you see it
[1:15:59] that's christ's idea right
[1:16:02] that's god's idea the new birth reveals
[1:16:05] this
[1:16:07] which is what christ in you
[1:16:10] the hope of glory
[1:16:12] all right let's go to one more and then
[1:16:13] we'll stop right here paradox
[1:16:15] 1963.
[1:16:17] that virgin birth was a mystery to the
[1:16:19] people
[1:16:21] they couldn't understand it now this
[1:16:24] message was preached
[1:16:26] right after christ the mystery god
[1:16:27] revealed was preached because it was
[1:16:28] preached on seven in july this was the
[1:16:30] first of august so he's still continuing
[1:16:33] his same thought
[1:16:34] the that virgin birth was a mystery to
[1:16:37] the people they couldn't understand it
[1:16:39] just like the new birth is today
[1:16:41] the new birth is a mystery to the people
[1:16:44] right they can't understand it they
[1:16:47] don't know what you mean
[1:16:49] they have belittled it amen
[1:16:53] watch this
[1:16:55] that same devil's working today right in
[1:16:57] the message of the hour
[1:16:59] they have belittled it bring it down
[1:17:01] saying well just because you believe
[1:17:04] something
[1:17:05] the devils believe the same thing in
[1:17:07] tremble
[1:17:09] it isn't what you believe it's what god
[1:17:11] has actually done
[1:17:14] the new birth is a birth it was a new it
[1:17:17] was a paradox when god brought new life
[1:17:20] to the human race to reject it as
[1:17:23] eternal separation to receive in his
[1:17:25] eternal life
[1:17:26] you're on the look you're on the same
[1:17:28] basis as adam and eve was that's right
[1:17:31] you can take if god puts you on anything
[1:17:33] else
[1:17:34] it would be unjust adam and eve
[1:17:37] so remember because he's the greatest
[1:17:39] judge there is he's the only eternal
[1:17:41] perfect judge
[1:17:42] we can judge on earth and make mistakes
[1:17:44] god can't judge and make mistakes
[1:17:47] it would be unjust to adam and eve each
[1:17:49] adam and eve tonight has got the right
[1:17:52] and wrong setting before them you can
[1:17:55] make your choice you can take god's word
[1:17:57] or leave god's word
[1:17:59] it's up to me and you right you can take
[1:18:01] it
[1:18:03] or you can leave it right but the new
[1:18:04] birth
[1:18:06] is a mystery
[1:18:07] glory
[1:18:10] so the statue of a perfect man
[1:18:12] has to be a mystery sure
[1:18:16] it has to be a mystery
[1:18:18] people cannot understand it
[1:18:21] because it's a mystery
[1:18:24] but um let me hit this real strong
[1:18:29] if you're not born again you're not
[1:18:30] going to understand it right right
[1:18:32] you're going to try your best to live as
[1:18:34] close as you can to it
[1:18:36] but it's just like brother brown said
[1:18:38] the the black bird trying to stick
[1:18:40] peacock feathers into his into his body
[1:18:43] somewhere you're going to shake him off
[1:18:44] and you're going to be still be the
[1:18:45] black bird all right so the basis of
[1:18:48] this whole thing that all today is is
[1:18:51] faith
[1:18:52] is the new birth glory so faith has to
[1:18:55] be something that you believe in
[1:18:59] not just something you believe in you
[1:19:01] got to believe that god
[1:19:03] glory did what he did for you amen not
[1:19:06] for richard marlowe not for danny
[1:19:08] fountain he did it for me
[1:19:10] he didn't die for them he died for me
[1:19:13] sorry
[1:19:14] well you got to say he died for you not
[1:19:16] me because you know what you don't know
[1:19:17] that he died for me i know sure we know
[1:19:20] he died for all of us but i'm talking
[1:19:21] about the culmination of it the
[1:19:23] culmination to get into this right here
[1:19:25] there's a lot of
[1:19:28] there's a lot of people comes right here
[1:19:30] and don't have enough faith
[1:19:32] to get the new birth right right
[1:19:35] right that's wrong they've come right
[1:19:37] here at sanctification and don't have
[1:19:38] enough faith to get the new birth
[1:19:41] see
[1:19:42] let's just explain it like this
[1:19:45] this is the wise virgin
[1:19:48] this is the foolish virgin
[1:19:50] right right
[1:19:53] this is the wise virgin
[1:19:55] because they have oil
[1:19:57] oil is a type of the holy ghost right
[1:20:00] but now listen to this though where does
[1:20:02] the foolish virgins go to to try to get
[1:20:05] the oil right right
[1:20:07] they try to go to the ones that's got
[1:20:09] the oil
[1:20:11] so they're going to try to come you know
[1:20:13] you can't go get gasoline
[1:20:17] i mean you can't go yeah you can't go
[1:20:18] get gasoline at a water station or you
[1:20:20] can't go get water at a gasoline station
[1:20:22] you understand what i'm saying they have
[1:20:23] to come they know they need the oil
[1:20:26] right
[1:20:27] but what do they say they say we only
[1:20:29] have enough for ourself because really
[1:20:32] you're only going to have enough to get
[1:20:33] yourself through
[1:20:36] you you're not going to have enough for
[1:20:37] even for your wife
[1:20:39] or your children or your family you're
[1:20:42] going to have to have enough for you to
[1:20:43] get in now they can come to you
[1:20:46] for the oil but what if the oil's not
[1:20:48] there right right
[1:20:50] what if the oil is not there for them to
[1:20:52] get it
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] like brother brown said about a bounce
[1:20:55] check he said
[1:20:56] somebody goes and writes a check got no
[1:20:58] money in the bank what does it do comes
[1:21:00] back insufficient funds
[1:21:02] let me leave you with that thought
[1:21:03] because as we go up this statue of
[1:21:04] perfect man the first one is virtue
[1:21:08] virtue is what strength right
[1:21:10] you've got to have it to be able to draw
[1:21:12] from it you can't acquire it
[1:21:17] somebody need it and then you'd say well
[1:21:18] i got to go get it no it's got to be
[1:21:20] something that's birthed in you
[1:21:22] each one of these let's stand each one
[1:21:24] of these is a birth
[1:21:27] all right
[1:21:28] this each one this is being we'll read
[1:21:30] it next sunday
[1:21:32] you know what peter the same one and
[1:21:33] said you got to be born again to get
[1:21:35] into this
[1:21:36] same peter said being born again
[1:21:39] by what the incorruptible word of god
[1:21:43] that liveth in the body forever right
[1:21:46] so i want you to think about that till
[1:21:47] next sunday these virtues are a birth
[1:21:51] right
[1:21:52] they are not just
[1:21:56] well i need to have it well i think i'll
[1:21:57] get it no it's a birth it's a birth
[1:22:01] of what the word i believe it's the
[1:22:03] birth of the word you hold on to because
[1:22:05] i don't i i i don't think that uh who
[1:22:08] was that said this morning
[1:22:13] somebody said brother al
[1:22:15] brother al said i ha i'm gonna have to
[1:22:17] listen to this four or five times
[1:22:19] he said cause i'm not gonna get it all
[1:22:21] at one time and he's right
[1:22:24] out of this one hour and 10 minute
[1:22:25] sermon you're probably gonna get 15
[1:22:27] minutes of information
[1:22:28] that you might take back and apply it to
[1:22:30] your life or think about it till next
[1:22:32] week that's why we've been around for 50
[1:22:34] years
[1:22:36] really that's why we've been around for
[1:22:38] 50 years we're only getting a little bit
[1:22:40] at a time but i hope you get enough
[1:22:42] a little bit of the time to carry you on
[1:22:44] to carry you on in the revelation of god
[1:22:47] not a revelation that i got a revelation

[1:22:51] you've got a revelation amen it's got to
[1:22:53] be personally to you i want us to have a
[1:22:55] personal relationship with god

[1:23:19] get yourself in the family you got to be
[1:23:21] involved i want i want everybody to have

[1:28:40] he's your
[1:28:47] it's a desire in our brother's heart for
[1:28:49] this to be done lord and you told us
[1:28:51] that you would give us the desire of our
[1:28:52] heart
[1:28:53] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[1:28:55] christ
[1:28:56] that we believe
[1:28:58] amen
[1:28:59] amen you already confessed it that's all
[1:29:01] you got to do

[1:29:36] they're supposed to accomplish
[1:29:38] in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:03] to be like
[1:30:11] in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:13] give her the desire of our heart
[1:30:15] that everything will work out for your
[1:30:17] honor and glory lord and not for each
[1:30:19] one of us but for you lord
[1:30:21] she's already confessed it and we
[1:30:22] believe it in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:24] let it be done amen
[1:30:45] holy
[1:30:59] and
[1:31:12] jesus
[1:31:19] this morning
[1:31:21] for your home come and get them
[1:31:25] or either at your work
[1:31:42] you know there's one thing i want us to
[1:31:43] understand through all this
[1:31:45] there's a point in time where we all
[1:31:47] come to a place
[1:31:49] to where when we first started you know
[1:31:51] with the lord it was it was wonderful
[1:31:53] and then all of a sudden you know you
[1:31:54] thought maybe god took a vacation and
[1:31:56] you can't find him nowhere
[1:32:00] who all went through that okay
[1:32:02] but he's still there
[1:32:04] he just wants us to grow up
[1:32:07] not be children not cry daddy daddy
[1:32:09] anymore
[1:32:11] the times that we
[1:32:13] we lay hands on the sick that's fine
[1:32:16] but you know there's a lot of times you
[1:32:18] watch brother branham and you watch
[1:32:19] jesus and we're that's our example right
[1:32:22] you watch them you watch brother branham
[1:32:24] in the prayer line and you watch jesus
[1:32:25] in prayer line or talking to
[1:32:27] a demon he don't scream
[1:32:32] the demon's not deaf and god's not deaf
[1:32:36] sure what the problem is though what
[1:32:39] many times we try to get that emotion
[1:32:41] built up to where you get the people's
[1:32:43] faith built up which is fine that's okay
[1:32:46] but now it comes a time to where you
[1:32:48] start talking to devils
[1:32:50] you don't have to scream at him
[1:32:53] going to stay right there until the life
[1:32:55] of god right
[1:32:57] tells him to leave
[1:32:59] remember the the legion
[1:33:01] jesus never laid hands on any of them
[1:33:02] people
[1:33:04] actually the devil said can we go
[1:33:07] they don't even want to stand around
[1:33:08] close by
[1:33:09] the devil the devil said jesus why did
[1:33:11] you come here before our time
[1:33:13] what are you doing here you let us leave
[1:33:15] and you know what he said go
[1:33:17] he didn't scream shout you know beat him
[1:33:19] on the head he said go
[1:33:21] and they said please can we go into
[1:33:23] these
[1:33:24] you know into these animals over here
[1:33:26] you know they were actually in
[1:33:28] subjection to the god that was standing
[1:33:30] in front of them
[1:33:31] when you come up for prayer when you
[1:33:33] break the sound wave when you speak and
[1:33:36] you and you confess something
[1:33:38] believe that it's already done then
[1:33:40] sometimes what we do is we come up here
[1:33:41] and that's okay but we come up here and
[1:33:44] we ask something and then you want the
[1:33:46] preacher to pray then you want god to do
[1:33:48] it you know then you want the
[1:33:49] manifestation of it
[1:33:51] remember god does it
[1:33:54] then he reveals it right the last thing
[1:33:57] is he makes it manifest but he already
[1:33:59] does it when you open your mouth and you
[1:34:01] make that confession of what you need
[1:34:05] doesn't matter who it's for for you or
[1:34:06] somebody else but you make that
[1:34:08] confession right then believe that
[1:34:11] before a preacher prays for you anoints
[1:34:13] you with oil or anything believe right
[1:34:14] then that god heard you first
[1:34:18] he heard you before the foundation of
[1:34:19] the world but see you've got to come up
[1:34:21] and make a confession
[1:34:23] and once you make that confession you
[1:34:25] watch brother branham he'll come up
[1:34:26] he'll say you've got a demon
[1:34:29] and then he'll start going back and
[1:34:31] picking their life out
[1:34:33] and finding out where that demon
[1:34:34] remember the woman that that was in the
[1:34:36] insane asylum he said you could have
[1:34:39] poured 55 gallons of oil
[1:34:42] on that woman's head and that devil
[1:34:43] would have stayed right there
[1:34:45] i know the bible says and we should
[1:34:47] anoint with oil pray the prayer of faith
[1:34:50] but you know you remember what brother
[1:34:51] brown did one time to cast out the devil
[1:34:53] he said the lord's prayer remember that
[1:34:57] our father who art in heaven hallowed
[1:34:59] the devil left
[1:35:00] in me and we didn't have to raise
[1:35:02] anything up he just quoted the word
[1:35:05] right
[1:35:05] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:35:09] in earth that is in heaven the devil
[1:35:11] knew then he was right there in earth
[1:35:14] so that devil just had to leave he'd
[1:35:16] have to scream at him so we don't have
[1:35:18] to scream at the devil but remember it's
[1:35:20] the life behind the name
[1:35:23] that makes the demons tremble
[1:35:26] the life behind the name that makes the
[1:35:28] proud heart humble amen it's the life
[1:35:31] behind the name so what i'm trying to
[1:35:33] get us to see is the life that we live
[1:35:36] it's what the devil's looking at
[1:35:38] remember he's very spiritual
[1:35:40] he knows whether you got it or not
[1:35:44] he knows whether you got it or not
[1:35:46] even before you know whether you got it
[1:35:48] or not because remember he's right there
[1:35:50] behind the
[1:35:51] behind god
[1:35:53] so let's realize that when we come up
[1:35:54] for prayer believe it settled as you
[1:35:58] just brother brown said just walking up
[1:35:59] to the altar
[1:36:01] defeats the devil
[1:36:03] getting out of bed in the morning and
[1:36:05] put your feet on the floor
[1:36:07] all the hell breaks loose oh god
[1:36:11] a born again believers then got up out
[1:36:13] of the bed again
[1:36:14] well you know what you didn't have to go
[1:36:16] you didn't have to shout at no demon
[1:36:18] they know where you're at right right
[1:36:22] they know where my house is if they not
[1:36:23] don't know where yours at they'll soon
[1:36:25] find it
[1:36:27] but you got to take this
[1:36:29] and believe
[1:36:30] that god's already done it
[1:36:32] it's already done even this is already
[1:36:34] finished but we got to go through the
[1:36:36] process of justification sanctification
[1:36:39] and the baptism of the holy ghost to get
[1:36:42] into that body to where we can you know
[1:36:45] what
[1:36:46] i i love brother dick
[1:36:49] but he's not my daddy brother dick's got
[1:36:52] a will right you got a brother that's
[1:36:53] got a will he is i'm not in his will
[1:36:56] because i'm not his son
[1:36:58] i'd like to be
