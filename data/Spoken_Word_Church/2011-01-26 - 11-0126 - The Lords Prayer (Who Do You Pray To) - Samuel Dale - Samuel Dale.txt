we won't be going to Revelations 1 we're going to Luke 11 just kind of a do it in a little different form tonight instead of tying it all together but just pray one for another the Lord would bless and keep each one now the Lord willing next Wednesday uh brother Dale Smith will be here preaching our on this coming up Wednesday so remember that and be much in prayer amen youve heard all the other announcements all of the things so just keep these things in your mind amen Luke 11 very familiar scripture with all of us but we want to just talk a little bit on it and see what the Lord has to say father we thank you for this night that we have that we can gather together thank you for the opportunity together because Lord a lot of people don't have this ability or time lord and there but you give it to us so we ask you now that you would just come and be with us and speak to our hearts and that Lord our thoughts and meditations be Solly upon you forgive our sins and just lead us in thine understanding that we may see you manifest Among Us you promised it so we believe you you said you'd come Among Us and heal the sick and Deliver us from our destructions and you do it by the revealed word of the hour that we're living we pray that you'd guide each one now bless those that are not here remember each one lead us in Jesus name amen very familiar scripture with all of us so when we get down to the the part then you read you say it with me okay when we get down into the second verse and it came to pass that he as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto true then when you pray say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us our daily bread and forgive our sins for as we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil you may be seated the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word now we'll get over into to Matthew in a minute so you can turn to Matthew 6 but I wanted to just read that one because the point is in there where that that they the disciples came to the Lord Jesus and they said teach us to pray all right now I am sure of one thing they had seen his prayers on many occasion be answered so they uh you know they were concerned and they wanted to know how to get their prayers answered well that's that's a a good point and it should be thoughty un to us and uh and we'll get to the main point of it in a a little bit but see I want you to think about that they seen Jesus they heard him pray right and they seen his prayers were answered well you know I mean you you talk to somebody and you say well you know when I see your prayers are answered I I'd like for you to show me how to pray now to me in the Lord's Prayer is the greatest I looked it up and brother brandom said it about three times he said they tried their best to add to the Lord's Prayer and said uh they've never been able to add one word to it because it was so perfect to start with all right so then it's not a you know it it's not something that you can can add a word to it's got everything in there and we'll cover that in a minute now it's got everything in other words everything that would be for Life y everything that would be in any form of living right uh you know Salvation healing anything that you have need of is in the Lord's Prayer now all right now brother Brandon would even at times pray for people and maybe you know they would not be delivered but yet he'd say okay now we're going to pray one more time and Satan you'll come out and he'd pray the Lord's Prayer right right now we look at it as the said to whatever we have need of is contained in that prayer there's a little difference in the wording from Luke than it is from Matthew but still it's the same prayer that was made and they were asking him they don't ask him in Matthew to teach them to pray and you know and that was the reason I was reading in Luke that they do ask him that point now I know that actually here in Matthew is not the prayer of the Lord right that would be in John right 17 right right when Jesus would be praying for us amen and that according to a lot of people is called The Lord's Prayer all right and it was the prayer that the Lord made see all right but yet still now if anybody anywhere in brother brandham you run it in there it's a it's 11 times that he actually uses you know Our Father which art in heaven right and if you ask us tonight as I said you you pray with me you know you read with me if we said now we're going to stand and say the Lord's Prayer we wouldn't go over to John 17 right right right we would go here and repeat you know the things of Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name because that is more or less in what all mankind calls The Lord's Prayer all right now as I said now you you go over to John and that is the prayer the Lord made for us that was not an example prayor as to teach us how to pray right that was a pray a pray that the Lord made right see he prayed for us and our our doings but now when you say the Lord's priy then you're automatically coming here to you know to Our Father which are in heaven because that would be the the basis of of what you're looking at see and as I said now Jesus in his praying he would speak to his father right all right now because that was the the reason that you'd say well now who do you pray to brother Dale that's that's the the the Lord's Prayer is the title but the the real title is who do you pray to remember I mentioned the other day that I was going to speak on that a little bit when I got time so I decided to go ahead and use it tonight and then uh drop back on to what we're on uh in the Book of Revelations but now as I said now I get to Point in the Lord's Prayer is everything right that we would have need of so if you have need of anything if you need material wealth we'll get to it in a minute pray the Lord's Prayer if you need healing pray the Lord's Prayer you need salvation pray the Lord's Prayer because in that is all that you have need of see and that's why that when they ask him you know Lord teach us to pray so he gave them you know a prayer to say and it's not that you have to just go say that prayer in a repetitious form we'll get to that in the in the Book of Matthew here in a minute but it's to knowing what you're praying and my point is to know who we're praying to right you said well brother Dale I I I've always known who to pray to yeah when we were trinitarians we prayed to Jesus to ask him to get the Holy Ghost to intercede to the father that right he said no no no Brother D I never did do that well we see that's that's what we done right because we didn't know who to pray to all right and see now as I said in the message a lot of people that some of the brothers especially about the river Jordans and the thing they're saying don't pray in the name Jesus you know don't pray to Jesus in other words not necessarily not in the name don't pray don't pray to Jesus Anymore CU see you know that would be just a well they don't understand that's right we'll get to that in a minute they don't understand the the whole story story to me then I don't have to worry about it but it's kind of like brother um Lincoln Barner said a man on heard him on the radio one day and said he told him he said y'all are the most mixed up people I've ever heard in my life said you pray and said you ask the father for something and said then you say in Jesus name you know well if you know who the father really is right then you don't have to worry about it all right but now let's get the point get get the point of what I want to bring down and then we'll we'll bring a little point of what I want to bring about you know who do we pray to the all right so now the Lord's Prayer he was praying now the point I want you to notice go to Matthew he was praying to his father right in other words when they said teach us to pray he didn't say pray Your Father which art in Heaven he didn't say that did he right right he said pray Our Father yeah all right now you get on over in there after his resurrection and his coming back to the disciples you remember he said I go to my father and your father amen I think it's John 16 36 I believe what it is I go unto my father and your father I go unto my God right and your God because he knew who he was praying to that's right but the emphasis I want you to get is that he wasn't just praying to the one inside of him because if that would be true why would we even pray outwardly you know what would be the purpose of praying outwardly if you're only think that you're praying only to the one that's inside of you right that's the one thing that I've tried to get you to see about that as long as we're here in this world we're dealing with sunship right we're dealing with intercessory right we're dealing with an advocate you don't do away with that even when you get on the other side it just all becomes into to the one person but now just think with me of what I'm trying to say so let's go to Matthew 6 right let's just read the background now in other words in Luke they said teach us to pray all right let's go over to Matthew and let's get the background and see that the background is what is saying teach us to pray they they were both saying the same thing right right you understand teach us to pray all right in other words what do we need to do to be able to contact the God that you are in contact with and he he gives them the part that we read in Luke but then in Matthew see in his writing look what he says about it he gives an order or a way to approach god so let's take that and just look at it verse one 6th chapter take heed that ye do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven now teach us to pray now Jesus wouldn't saying uh are you listening it it seems to be that you're not following my point right here and maybe it's me but in Luke he said they said teach us to pray right amen now Jesus in Matthew is telling you how to pray right right and prayer is not just words right you said well well that's right we we just pray well now pray the Lord's Prayer you're going to have to pray one and not the other and in one of them it says in heaven the other says in earth right right there's a little difference in the wording but my point is what is prayer well you got to get down you got you know you got to bow down and put your hands up you got to do this or you got to get in front of the prophet's picture or the Lord Jesus Christ's picture what you got to know what is prayer how is it that the Bible spreads pray without ceasing right is that scripture right now how can you pray without ceasing if it's put your hands up B on your knees get to do this whatever how is it that you're going to be able to do that all right now prayer is a more of a state of mind then it is verbal words right that we speak you know yourself sometimes what you do you pray you just pray to you in inwardly don't you right right you don't have to pray outwardly but yet there are times we pray outwardly now in doing it that way and God setting it up then it put mankind into a place like that as we read here that sometimes if we ain't careful we'll get exalted in our prayers what was it there in the book of Acts the the man the the king or whatever he was you remember he was sitting on a throne or doing something there I believe in the book of Acts and uh he got he spoke some great swelling words where they just jumped up and said that is the words of God well God smoted him right there right because he wouldn't have him to share his glory but get my point in that what I'm saying prayer is not just to say words prayer is a state of mind it is no joke where brother random was saying that the little boy just put his ABCs MH and stuck them out in the woods you know and said my Lord and you come by you just put the words together right well because every letter that would be said in the prayer if it was 2 hours long or two words long would be coming out of that alphabetical situation so it's not a point of a joke it's a truth but prayer is a state of mind right you just put your yourself when you're praying put yourself in a state of mind I've listening here not too long ago brother Randon was talking about how that he was going out to pray for the meeting that they had he said he got in one place and said I don't remember exact order but something to this degree and he said that the Thorns was sickening said he moved over in another place and said the mosquitoes started getting him you know now he's out to pray for the meetings and he finally said he he said the mosquitoes was eating him up so bad said finally just said just in other words just eat all you want to I'm going to pray so he just got into his state of praying and he wasn't much concerned about the mosquitos huh see it's a state of mind that's not something to do it and a state of mind has to do with your life right right it has to do with your life and what we're doing so then we can see there that we got a certain way to approach God then all so he says now don't do your you know do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven now if we get all exalted in ourselves what happens okay keep on going verse two therefore when thou doest thine arms or deeds or or you know religious Acts or whatever you want to call it do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men verely I say unto you they have their reward you do it on that account you got your reward what is your reward everybody around you you know I no reward from God but that's what most people want I I believe and I I watch people and they're praying and and I'm not throwing off now on nobody but when I hear people pray sometimes I think they're talking to the congregation they're not talking to God you know watch their prayers you know they're not talking to God they're talking to worth every somebody else can hear the great swelling words that they use to make them think that they're talking to God all right so now watch's the point now but when th doest arms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth now that's within yourself right don't get exalted don't get nothing in the way like that what what it that thine arms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly now this is the scripture that brother brandham was using and and spoke on the seventh seal right we'll read it down in just a minute but it was told him on this when you enter into your closet when he said I don't understand he said enter into your closet and he that pray in secret the Lord shall reward thee openly so it's not just a play something get you get to point now in just a minute what I'm talking about that thine arms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward because they're sin of man is that what we want when we're praying what about the state of mind we're in right do we want somebody else to hear us you know now I don't know whether this happened or not but Billy Paul if I ain't mistaken when it told it said one day he come running in to to they all eaten and he came running in and he he just got his meal and he said his prayer and said his daddy said Son do you think God heard you cuz I didn't now there's nothing wrong with praying quiet and I think he was just making a point to to Billy you know right see we're not to go out and blast them well then then I just won't pray no more outwardly no that's not true because Jesus said pray that the lord of the Harvest would send laborers into the vineyard right you now he's wanting us to pray right it's not the point that we just don't pray and we say well I just won't pray I I'll just do all of I pray it in secret and all now that's if you're doing a lot in secret I ain't worried about it you know what if you're doing a lot of praying to God in secret I'm not worried about the other prayers you and I making because it'll be it'll be taken care of all right but now look what I'm saying don't do like the Hypocrites see they've got their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut thy door pray to the father Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly now have we got to go into a closet back when we were you know years ago I some of the preachers preach like this they said well you need to pray 30 minutes before you put on a tap listen to it I said I only have 30 minutes to listen to the tape right so I said Lord help me and I put the tape on you see they said well you know need to pray 30 minutes before well I wouldn't never get to listen to a tape hard it you know I didn't have time back then have more time now right but I didn't have the time back then what does it mean brother random said when you say enter into the closet well what you need to do is find your closet and and you need to ENT well that's good if that's what you believe if that's your state of mind or your thoughts or whatever enter into the closets and pray in secret but what is it praying to God to reveal his Secrets is what we should be praying amen and he'll reward us openly right because he bring it to us like we were talking about the other day about Sim keeping the worshiper clean where Jacob laid down put his head on the Rock and looked up and there was a ladder going up you know going up to heaven and the angels ascending and descending the Angels going up coming back down what were they doing taking his prayers The Book of Revelation speaks of the prayers of the Saints and one day when they're poured out then the tribulation will take place that's not a as I said you know it's not a bowl full of prayers and then you dump them out those are just points of getting us to see what's going on right now watch what he goes on to say but when you pray use not vain repetitions as the Heathen do for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking now this is a prayerful attitude to get us to the prayer you understand what I said a moment ago prayer is an attitude of mind all right now following this example we see within that what we need to do first our life in line right right have our life in line then our prayers won't be hindered right I mean there scriptures for everything for fasting and things like that but you know and the correct way to do things God didn't leave us without any right anything he gave us the answer to everything that's what I'm saying in Luke it says teach us to pray Matthew he's telling you how to get into the attitude or the correct way to be able to pray the Lord's Prayer to me that's the same thing I can take Matthew now and put it right over with Luke and say Lord teach us to pray he says all right this is the way you do do these things first is your life lined up over here do you pray your pray before men that you may be seen yeah do you do this do you do that just what we've been reading all right we see the he you know what they do screaming and hollering you know loud you hear a lot of people a lot of preachers now come on I'm just talking you hear them praying and it sounds like they're praying off somewhere 40 Mi away because they're real loud you know I mean I know the story don't just go on forget it I know the story God's not deaf either and he's not nervous either you know that's what one group would say well he's not nervous and he's not deaf but see you're using that to try to justify what you're doing we pray and we talk right to our father and we asked him right and he says well have you done these other things is our life lined up up you know if our life's lined up we don't have no right to ask God you know if it's not lined up we don't have no right to ask God to give us anything that's why the the prophet preached a message about it you know repent to be healed you know but see we we're still not to the point that we don't when somebody comes up to be prayed for I don't say all right you confessed all your sins this week we ought to of course you'd have a whole lot less going to be prayed for but you see if our lives that's the point of what I'm trying to get at is Luke just tells you that they said teach us to pray right Matthew is telling you the order are line up to come down to be able to make the prayer cuz he's telling you how to approach it watch let's read verse 7 and 8 now back together but when you pray use not vain repetitions as the Heathen do for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him thank Lord he knows what you have need of well like I said a minute go well they don't need me praying God knows what he knows I need it well now according to that attitude that would not fit back up in all of this other right and according to that attitude God would have no reason to answer a prayer ask a father in my name pray the Lord of the Harvest in the sinful labor right he wants us to pray all right he was almighty God but you know the scripture said he prayed much right he prayed all night one night that's recorded in the scripture now he was the lord of the Harvest we'll get back to it in a minute but who was he praying to I look like he just sat there inside of me something going on there I'm praying that's all right it's all right to do that that's fine the biggest portion probably of my praying is is just within me right that's where I see that scripture where that you know pray without ceasing then that way you can be at work it can be anywhere you can be in a restaurant you can be in a in a in a worldly thing out there and you can be sitting there praying you know what I mean right cuz you can't go nowhere now that there's not a hollering and screaming going on you don't have to go to sports events to find out just anywhere you are but get what I'm saying now this is a background then he gets down to the point after this manner therefore pray ye now he's going to say what he says in the Book of Luke but see Luke didn't put this up here but don't you believe this up here would go with the Book of Luke that's right right as a line up or a way of getting us to a place to pray amen and how to pray and not pray repetitious you know what I mean by that and it's it's not saying when you when you say don't pray repetitions it's not saying that not you don't know you can't say the same thing over and over right that's right but if you read Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come that would be repetitious wouldn't it right if you kept saying the same thing see get it in the correct order of what we're to deal with it doesn't bother God to remind him what his word has to say that's what he wants us to do and prayer then now watch what it say look therefore pray this way Our Father which art in heaven now our father he's got the same father exactly he's got the same father and where is his father which are in heaven right hallowed are sacred are consecrated or Sanctified be thy name now here within these three or four verses as I said you'll find everything you have need of everything you would have need of is in there that's why the prophet would say Okay Satan you won't come out we prayed but said you will come out now and he would pray the Lord's Prayer and Satan would come out right because everything in here that we're reading in this Lord's Prayer is reminding God y of what he come to do right what he said what he was getting us to do the life he wanted us to live the things that we have need of show me what else it would be let's just go through it just for a second see Our Father which art in Heaven how long could you stay on that part Hallowed be thy name and what's his name I remember brother Mo telling him about he was in a u Baptist Church I think it was way back years ago you know and uh the man he wasn't in the church said man at the church asked him to come and teach Sunday school cuz they' heard him talking you know and he said all right and he said uh I'm going to come and just take the Lord's Prayer and said uh you know we'll just take the Lord's Prayer and I'll just teach on it and the man okay that's good and he made it to this far cuz when he got to where he said Hallowed be thy name the man told him he didn't want him to come back anymore see because he got into the name right amen and the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's amen so they didn't want him back but Hallowed be thy name what's his name his name is Jesus I come in my father's name so his father's name would have to be Jesus am and we're going to get down to a point where that that I couldn't find the exact quotation that brother R made but I know it's there but he says you can call him Jesus Jesus and not get nothing because it's the state of mind that you're in that's right amen will you be honest enough to admit that sometimes you pray and it's not actually a prayer of state of mind it's a verbal words that you've used to just say I need to pray would you agree with that I will maybe that's why we don't get what we ask for cuz he said ask the father anything in my name maybe the reason we don't get it is because we're not following this part up here that our correct attitude our correct State of Mind is not come into being because we've not we've done our arms to be heard of men we've done our prayers to be out in the open we've done these things and maybe that's why our prayers are not answered right but look what he says Hallowed be thy name see this is the day we'll get to it in a minute because when Jesus was saying those things of ask anything in my name the father anything in my name if you'll notice right before then it says at that day that's this day right the day of this Revelation the day when we really know who and what the name of Jesus really is that's right cuz you can take the name of Jesus and sometime maybe I'll do it but you can run it all the way back to Jehovah and jehovas see and actually the word Joshua even comes from from the name Jesus and all it comes down to that keeping coming too you know and you can see that it was back there in the Old Testament as was trying to bring out a Sunday where your Prophet said it was D y that those prophets said the name of Jesus now they didn't say Jesus they said Jehovah or Yahweh or or Elohim or whatever but they knew his name that's why it's jvh V see it can't Jehovah is not it that's why the scripture said in my name Jehovah was I never known it's jvh V it can't be pronounced why cuz it's j s u s am that's the best way to say it as I said when the angel Gabriel delivered to Mary he not only delivered a message that she would have a child but he he delivered the message of the name right even named John he brought a name and Jesus is that name right so then when he said ask anything in my name now get what I'm saying the state of mind is what you're doing is not verbal word so you don't have to say Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus you might be saying yo whatever how you pronounce it in Spanish Jesu you might not even be using his name well I said it and that's why maybe we don't get our prayers answered to be in his name means to be in all of the line that we're talking about here if all of this is not correct up above here that we've been reading we don't have no right to expect God to answer our prayers amen it's a state of mind it's not just verb words that we're saying but look what it goes on to thy kingdom come now how long could you preach on that amen Jesus said it you know in in the church AG you start he that overcometh shall sit with me in my Throne as I overcome and sit down in my father's Throne see thy kingdom Throne domain thy kingdom come you're reminding God of the promise that he made are you listening when you're praying this prayer you're reminding him you're recognizing who your father is where your father is at and you're seeing his name right his name is Jesus and then you're seeing that he was going to have a kingdom yep so you're just reminding him so what I said everything we have need of is laying in this prior amen thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven what are we talking about right we're talking about everything we have need of is in this MH give us this day our daily bread both natural and spiritual amen right y we're reminding him that he promised us that he give us our bread watch now and forgive us our debts our sins it says Luke used the word sin it's not debts we don't owe debts to God we owe him our whole life yeah that's right but it's sins forgive us our sins our debts as we forgive those who have sinned against us right and I'm just as honest as I can be but I've never tried to be nothing else I told you I've never tried to memorize the Bible and if you as me actually to quote the Lord's Prayer I would probably not be able to say it in this entire text exactly the way it's written right because I would translate sin I wouldn't say debts because to me that's what it's talking about but it's talking about deaths and other words we owe God everything and then we forgive our debtors those who owe us everything we have need of lead us not into temptation is that a wonderful prayer amen lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil yes for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen that's right see then we stop there then don't we we look at the next verse for if we forgive men their trespasses your heaven if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your your trespasses in Mark 11 we talk about it being that he that sath to this mountain be moved everybody wanton to see mountains moved yeah but Mark 11 is own condition if you keep reading down through about verse 23 24 25 26 it says if we won't forgive we can't be forgiven right now it does not say if I do something to Danny and then I go say Danny I'm sorry that's what we think isn't it let them come and ask me to forgive them I'll forgive them now the Bible say that right the Bible says to forgive it don't put stipulations in it it don't say if they've asked it says forgive as your father in Heaven forgives you see what I'm talking about though see the Lord's priy we just want to section it out and read this part and then see what well we said well okay I'd rather go over here to Luke cuz it's just short but see you me they're both got to be explaining the same thing right so Luke says teach us teach us they did to pray Jesus said okay after this manner after what Manner Matthew 1 through what down to verse n cuz prayer is a state of mind right it's not words that's correct amen we use words and like I say now we say but now but brother Dale we we uh we're just praying to the one inside of us well now do you pray to the one inside of me right then now we're going to get downwards itue for a while right do you pray to the one that's inside of me if all you're going to say is you're going to pray to the one that's inside of you brother Gary what would be the problem then me praying to the one's inside of you if I can only just going to pray that the once's inside of me because if one's inside of me is inside of you then I can pray to the one's inside of you and you can pray the one inside of me but we don't do that do we and to show you how that we get to the point we say well I don't have to pray outwardly that's fine I just pray inwardly you get sick enough and you'll start praying outwardly right you get sick enough you'll cry out for somebody else to pray for you righten and you'll sure start praying out loud cuz you want to make sure that that time that you're needing something that bad that you want to make sure you get in good contact all right so we to understand you can pray all day and not say a word outward it right right amen fine that's right but then sometimes you pray outwardly just make sure it's not to be seen M to be heard a lot of you that listen to Brother Richard then he'll hear this and they they'll probably either life at me or scorned me one but you know we've we've complained two or three times to them about it that their takes was kind of weak with the main point we meant was was was the beginning of their tapes would would be low well there's one thing about it brother Richard and brother Steven don't holler screaming loud out to God you know for him to hear their prayers cuz they pray low and then start preaching loud they hear that till right either life or something about it because that's what they do every one of them they pray low and then when they start preaching they preach loud you don't have to turn the volume up but when they're praying you got to turn the volume up to hear well that's wonderful you know that's that's not being making it to be where that you got to scream and holler for God to hear you it's honor and respect and not doing things to be seen right that's right see talking to God man done at work one time telling about this fell said they had him to pray and said oh said he he prayed such a pretty prayer he said I thought my Lord them beautiful words that man's are praying he said he looked up to see if he's praying he said the Rascal was reading it off now that's what he said reading he said he was reading it well that's all right you know right out the alphabet God knows the words cuz we just read a scripture that he knows what we have need of get in the alphabet but you see it's a state of mind get in the right state of mind and you don't even have to say Jesus Jesus Jesus why because he knows what you're doing amen now Jesus never prayed a prayer and said Jesus I say this in Jesus name right right and are you with me he didn't pray a prayer and say I say this in Jesus name but he prayed to the father right one office or one manifestation communicating with the others to carry things on right not trinitarianism but he never prayed in jesus' name right but he told us to and at that day when the Revelation comes we really know how to pray that's right so they took that name of Jesus and it sounds just like that that down in the dark that they lost the name the brother around would say that what's he saying you mean they forgot to call him Jesus they called him Joe or or something else you know no it was the liking of the revelation of the name that's right is what the problem was cuz they thought it was trinitarianism they lost the revelation of the name not the name they could pronounce it brother Randon made a statement one time and it really amazed me he said I never prayed a prayer that God didn't answer me he said now sometimes he told me I couldn't have it you know you ever noticed him praying like that he said I never prayed a prayer God didn't answer I thought Lord how many times have I prayed so much but you know what that DED on me one day what the man was saying right and you know I've never prayed a prayer that God didn't answer me that's right righten why because all of the other times I was just using words I was just talking y but when it's really sincere in your heart and you get down before God in the right state of your mind toward him he'll hear you right and he'll answer you might not be right when you want it but he'll answer you you understand what I'm getting at that's right here in Matthew we see the setting that brings ourselves into the place that we can actually pray the right attitude the right setting then we can say John 17 where it says I send to my father and your father to my God and your God then it all works out real good don't it see Matthew then explains our attitude because this is right after the Beatitudes right right Beatitudes the fifth chapter right of Matthew this is right after the Beatitudes in the sixth chapter that is explaining it and telling us how to pray Luke covers what the Lord said in verbal words you right verbal words whereas Matthew covers the attitude leading up to where that those verbal words will be accepted you see how important our lives are see they asked him to teach him to pray as he prayed other words we know your prayers have been answered so not teach us to pray that way they knew God heard him or the father heard just say that way where you keep it in mind and they knew the father had answered his prayers don't we want to ask don't we want to pray that way right in the Lord's Prayer then is a summing up of all the things that we have need of Amen to cover the kingdom to cover the the healings the signs the Wonder everything is in the Lord's Prayer so no wonder the devil has to back off when the Lord's Prayer is said not by verbatim words but when the Lord's Prayer is said from a heart of an individual that realizes what that's taking place you're reminding god of what he said just like a little woman there I always think of it like this you remember the little woman there in the scripture you know that he said but the crumbs she said but the crumbs when they fall off of the master's table said we dogs y are allowed to eat them he said he didn't find so much faith in Israel cuz you know what reminded him what he come to do right it reminded him that he come to bring in a gentile dispensation that's right and the dog dos would come to become the children of God right amen reminded him you ever heard brother brandom emphasizing there in the scripture where that the the the the woman you know said thy son of David have mercy on me and he wouldn't even listen to her he said she had no right to call him that but said when she said my Lord amen said he was her Lord she got what she asked for amen but she had to change it from son of David didn't she y That's right well now what do you mean God know when she started praying like that who she was what she talking about yeah but he wanted her to pray right he wants us to pray he wants us to say right see to recognize truly who our father is is what I'm trying to get us to see now Jesus prayed to his father and he said our father was the same father his father then we pray for who how do we pray Our Father which are in heaven we pray to our father don't we we don't pray to Jesus to ask him to intercede with the father right we pray to the father and end our prayers in Jesus name amen cuz that's what he said do you ever noticed that let's see I think I didn't hear but I know the reason I thought on this is what brought it to me that brother brandham would say he said father he said I thank you that you sent your son sure to die in my place am where he could come and heal me and things like that he was a trinitarian was he but he was recognizing all the positions that it took to bring into being that he could make that prayer but you know I've never found him say this I've never heard him say Jesus I'm glad your father sent you right now if it is I'm you know I can be corrected I'm just making a point about cuz you see that would be getting too close to to people wouldn't it we're asked to say father I thank you right that you sent your son to die in my place we know what happened there don't we amen see what I'm saying about the re reation of the hour and times where we are and what we're doing at that day cuz then we're knowing and realizing that God came down himself that's right to die in our place am but see if you turn it around the other way and say son I thank you that the father sent you down that would be another person that's how easy it is to cross it up see what are you doing what are we doing just get over here and get through at that day then you'll know see at that day John 16:23 he says you'll ask me nothing now look what he's saying you need to read that scripture look it up John 16:23 at that day you don't need to ask me nothing he said but he said whatsoever you ask the father or something like believe this in my name y so we're the only people who have outside of coming down from the disciples it was lost down to the ages the revelation of the name not the name itself but the Revelation what was going on but see now we have the name restored cuz it was restored back there in the on the right before zeusa Street or right in that period of time that the name of Jesus was restored why is the prophet using that the name of Jesus he called the Bible calls the name of Jesus an Open Door a revelation of who he is and see then who do you pray to you said well God knows who he is brother Dale why would I be concerned about it I'm glad you thought thought of that cuz you see you just lost a whole thing he knows who he is right why would it not be all right to call him right Jehovah why would it not be all right to call him Yahweh yep H him you see we know the scripture ask anything in my name see and we're not going to pray our prayers in the name of Jehovah right we're not going to pray our prayers and end them with Yahweh or Elohim or we're not going to do that are we you see he does know who he is but he wants wants us to know who he is right that's right I sitting around my house and somebody says well poppy well you know everybody in there knows who I am but that's the not not the right title for my sons and daughters to use son in-law's daughter-in-law they use them because that's respect it's not the title for my wife to use right the correct title for my wife is what husband it's not father a children is Father not husband how many times You' been through that with the prophet listening and then why why wouldn't he he knew he was the son of David why would he not why would not he answer that lady's prayer when she said Son of David have mercy on me he knew who he was he said well what's all this about the name of Jesus and all the God knows who he is we just call him God and that can be an object of worship right right y so we'll pray tonight so we'll say God would you come down and heal this person we ask it in God's name now we're not going to do that are we right who do you pray toen the one that's inside of you this is a background for another M seat all right it won't be Sunday morning but who do you pray to I pray to my father amen right amen and while I'm on Earth I use the name of Jesus right cuz I say in Jesus name am you ever notice the the Baptist especially they'll say they won't say in Jesus name they they'll say for Christ's sake you ever been around and watch them in the name of the Holy One or or Christ's sake they won't say in the name of Jesus so that's what caught me when I was in the Baptist Church and and you know I began to talk to the preacher a little bit about the name of Jesus and didn't mention much to him one but this I think it was him or maybe somebody came in but anyhow that was the way it hit me and doed on me I had to go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz the preacher got up there and I knew the Baptist didn't believe in doing it that way he said now that's the way we all pray for Christ's sake he said from now on let's do what the Bible says pray in jesus' name and you know what the whole church turned around started praying in Jesus name but you know what I done I said Thank You Lord I'm heading to the water as fast as I can go because I saw Jesus name yep to the others it just meant a verbal word to change it from Christ sake you watch it around it you know you watch how people will pray they'll say you know for Christ's sake or in the name of the Holy One or or something like that or father in thy name or something that you see do we pray to our father right now I'm asking you the question me too do we pray to our father or are we still tied up and don't exactly know who our father is could we be we be approaching him wrong that's why people are all looking for a new name right we don't need to try to worry about a new name until we bring in to the point of understanding in the name of Jesus that's right and unless we take it on the order of what Matthew says about it the the the way of laying it down to come to that place for giving and and doing and not praying outwardly and not do you know loud and and not being seen of men and not doing our arms just just be I don't even worried about your name but I've always told you as honest and I could be about it what if it's not a different name but just something about the name of Jesus that we don't understand amen see that way I'm not saying that there's not a new name coming I believe there will be because every day is a new revelation to me that's right every day I see more of the name of Jesus don't you amen compared to where you started at that don't you see more of a day of than new name the name of Jesus amen but you see everybody wants some kind of a something to be able to say and they even said it about brother Brandon said his mouth was formed a certain way so he could speak that word what's the form of your mouth I go this way and say Jesus I go way and say Jes Jesus what it comes out the same right that's right see it's just some kind of a something that's makes it where no nobody else can't do it cuz we'd have to all find out about what to know just like one man told Brother mo one time he said said but said you talk to people that said but they never seen brother brandom said we seen him said when he'd say them things and them gestures he'd make and them way that he'd say it said if you didn't see that you wouldn't know what he's talking about well I didn't know gestures change the words on the tape right you know but who do you pray to I've told you over and over that to me when I look back there and I see him and I can see Jesus Christ all the way through the Bible right I see Jesus Christ all the way through the Old Testament I can see Jesus Christ back there in the in the garden as the creator of God Amen but I'm not talking about Jesus I'm talking about Jesus Christ who is almighty God Amen see I can stand here and say then Jesus Christ would you come and lead us cuz I know who I'm talking about if you could you can say Jesus and if you know who you're talking about the state of mind has brought you to the place that you know that you're talking about Jesus who is almighty God right and that there's never been another name but Jesus right see then that's not Jesus only this recognize in the revelation of the hour that we're living who do you pray to well I pray to the one inside of me I hope that illustration brought out a while ago will help on that you know that when we get sick we start Str screaming we don't pray to the one inside of us all the time and the illustration of where that do you pray to the one inside of me no sister Gail you pray to the one inside of you don't you you ain't trying to contact the one inside of me right I'm trying to get you to see what it means to pray we think it's words but it's a state of mind that you live in y that you can pray all day pray without ceasing but then you pray we call on somebody to dismiss or something they don't pray inside of them do they you pray outwardly right who do you pray to like I said brother brandom would say father I thank you that you sent your son but we don't believe that's trinitarianism right we know that that means exactly what it said that God came down in a form y who do you pray to Jesus had a father and prayed to his father y it's written in the Bible where he was in the garden and the prayer that he made that Lord this cup might pass from me so evidently somebody heard it cuz that's what they wrote down I hope you understand what I'm saying prayer is a state of mind and you can live in that that's where our trouble it is when we don't live in that's why the prophet said Angels don't come to us because of our state of mind but who do you pray to I pray to my father and I know where my father is at he's in heaven I know also that the Holy Ghost is here and I know that that the Christ is here leading us and guiding us the key to the whole thing is what it says in the Book of Revelations to me where John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day right the prophet said the key was he was in the spirit mhm nothing else wouldn't have been worth nothing but you see while we're here in this world we ask the father right in Jesus name cuz that's giving him back then every title every thought if your mind is in in the right order every thought every mind every point is like I said about what it is for the Lord's Prayer you're reminding him of everything he promised you when you use the name of Jesus cuz you're reminding him of all he went through to bring that name into being upon the Earth right not as to letters J esus cuz the prophet said that is used before and many times after said there's many jesuses in the days of the Lord Jesus but there was only one Lord Jesus Christ amen there was only one almighty god let's Stand Together come on musician think on these things think on these things who do you pray to I pray to my father I know my father's name though his name is Jesus when you see it like that brother R said if you don't see Christ in every verse he didn't say Jesus cuz you don't see the j s us s but you see Christ in every verse and you can go back and read it but see one day we'll see Jesus never verse right and we see the who the Christ really is almighty God think on these things just a little thought what we got 237 in spiral book 237 in the spiral book anybody have a need CU you see I believe in that name amen I once was lost in s but Jesus took me in and then a little life from Heaven F my soul he B my heart in love and wrote my name above and just a little talk Jesus our our C all right we'll believe father our brother's coming asking for a prayer CL for somebody that needs to be in church father Satan's got them working seven days a week we don't ask for the company to has to shut down they out the house and make some other ARR making the word that this one can get here Lord you will do that we believe we send this pray be a contact to him that we're praying for him believe with you in Jesus name anybody else a little Jesus Mak now let us have a little Jesus us all about our TR our will you feel your with with burning you will Jesus just Jesus me father you know what our sister and and sister who trying to do the best thing they can do for brother Tom so we ask you Lord Jesus to just let him see where he needs to be is there Lord not at home and do the things he needs to be there where they take care of you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the right the right mind why would the prophet be standing there and he said now let everybody get real serious now don't be running around and often the holy spirit is very timid so he's getting in the right state of mind and things that's what we need to do then our prayers will go through just believe it St and night I him in PR he knows my every just a little with Jesus amen Aus all about our our he will answer the fire turning the fire is burning Jesus amen this is the day this is the day that the Lord has that the Lord we will rej We willj and glad Go been revealed to us this is the day that the we will rej and be glad this is the day this is the day that the Lord has made this is the day right today that the Lord that the Lord we will rejoice we will rejoice and be glad and be glad this is the day that the Lord has will he made a day you know he made a people for the day he made a day but he made a people for the day you know nobody can't I listen we was the other day we brother around and said nobody can't take your place he said but you can't take nobody else's place either you know God chose us for a reason now I don't understand it I'm honest what he need me for right but yet there was a reason right that's right and Satan can't get us till he gets through with the reason he's got for all of us then why are we worried about it we're not concerned but see this is the day to understand going if you notice I just quo in the scriptures but run that in and just look in the concordance at that day we just used the one in John 20 where brother R said that means this day but just look at all the time it says that day at that day you won't ask me nothing cuz you realize who you're talking to so it evidently means that maybe we think we're talking to the wrong person sometimes maybe we have our mind connected in speaking to the wrong one of course we we would never admit it but maybe we are like the Catholics they want to talk to Mary to get her to talk to Jesus to where he can talk to God Holy Ghost then it can go on to God you see we're not in that day we're in the day to understand who we're talking to and who we're talking about and his name is Jesus be the lord of the kingdoms of heart jus surren all Jesus all Jesus I surrender all the kingdom my heart in my heart kingom let me open up those doors and let him in not see they not behind closed doors in their heart you surrender the whole heart the Lord of all luk King Jesus is he Lord Jesus be the Lord Jesus Now sing it let surrender all of it right Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all the kingdom father we thank you for an opportunity of being in here tonight and we pray that Lord what we' said is worthy of being said we pray that as we go on our way home that you would speak to our hearts and our lives during the rest of the week Lord and get us ready for the weekend and that you would be the preeminent one in each one of us we love you father and we thank you that we don't have to worry about it now that we don't have to be concerned and like others are saying that we don't use we'll pray to Jesus well Lord while we're still here in this world you are still God because you are the Lord Of Our Lives Lord maybe one day we'll all turn around to be different but that name Jesus will still be there we love you and we thank you for the revelation of the hour that we're living Just Have Your Way go with us on the way home keep us all in your love in Jesus name amen your dismiss I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to just to you I want to love love till
