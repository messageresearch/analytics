[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Oh, there's honey in the rock, my
[0:05] brother. There's money in the rock for
[0:11] you. Forgive your sins for the blood to
[0:17] cover. There's money in the rock for
[0:21] you. Amen. You believe that this
[0:24] morning? You believe that? Let's sing
[0:27] that once more as our brother come and
[0:28] just turn to one another and say,
[0:29] "There's honey in the rock for you."
[0:31] Shake each other's hand. Greet them in
[0:33] the name of the Lord. Oh, there's honey
[0:36] in the rock, my
[0:39] brother. There's honey in the rock for
[0:44] you.
[0:46] Leave your sins for the blood to
[0:51] cover. Oh, there's honey in the rock for
[0:56] you. Oh, yes, there's honey in the rock,
[1:00] my
[1:02] brother. Oh, there's honey in the rock
[1:06] for you.
[1:09] Leave your sins for the blood to cover.
[1:14] [Music]
[1:21] Amen. Good morning. God bless you all.
[1:23] Happy to be here together. Just pray
[1:27] that we are all thinking the same way
[1:30] with the Lord Jesus Christ. And me and
[1:33] brother D were riding up this morning. I
[1:36] told him
[1:38] to write something down for me. He did.
[1:42] I told him to read what I told him to
[1:44] write down. He started reading
[1:46] it. That's not right. I might have told
[1:50] you to read it, but it's still not
[1:52] right. We all want to be on the same
[1:55] page. That's right. Spirit of God come
[1:58] this morning in this church that we be
[2:01] under one spirit. Amen.
[2:04] Because if you if
[2:06] you are not in like spirit, things ain't
[2:09] going to go right. Just just pray. So,
[2:14] we got it right. It may be a little more
[2:17] than I wanted to read. You want to hear,
[2:19] but go ahead, brother. It's St. Luke the
[2:24] 6th chapter verse
[2:28] 20-36. So, let us pray.
[2:31] Heavenly Father, we are grateful this
[2:33] morning for the privilege and
[2:35] opportunity you have given us to come
[2:37] together to worship. Father, we pray
[2:39] that all of our hearts will be yielded
[2:41] to the one spirit of our Lord Jesus
[2:43] Christ and that he will bless us all
[2:45] together. Lord, let us all pray
[2:47] together, saying together, lift our
[2:49] hearts up unto the same God and same
[2:52] spirit. Lord, we thank you and we ask
[2:54] you for all that we have need of come
[2:56] down upon us in our hearts. If you're
[2:59] not in every heart, Father, we pray that
[3:01] you will find your way and they relieve
[3:04] their spirit unto you. In Jesus name we
[3:07] pray. Amen.
[3:25] St.
[3:26] Luke chap
[3:29] 6
[3:32] 20-36. And he lifted up his eyes unto
[3:35] his disciples and said, "Blessed be the
[3:38] poor, ye poor, for yours is the kingdom
[3:41] of God."
[3:43] Blessed are ye that hunger now, for ye
[3:46] shall be filled. Blessed are ye that
[3:49] weep now, for ye shall
[3:53] blessed ye when men shall hate you, and
[3:57] when they shall separate you from their
[4:01] company, and shall reproach you, and
[4:04] cast out your name as evil, for the son
[4:08] of man's sake.
[4:11] ye in that day and leap for joy. For
[4:15] behold, your reward is great in heaven.
[4:18] For inner did their fathers unto the
[4:21] prophets. But woe unto you that are
[4:25] rich, for ye have received your
[4:27] consolation.
[4:29] Woe unto you that ye shall hunger. Woe
[4:34] unto you that laugh now, for ye shall
[4:37] mourn and weep. Woe unto you when all
[4:40] men shall speak well of you. For so did
[4:44] their fathers do the false prophet.
[4:48] I say unto
[4:49] you, love your enemies, do good to them
[4:53] which hate you. Bless them that curse
[4:56] you and pray for them which despitefully
[4:59] use you. And unto him that smiteth thee
[5:03] one sheep, offer also the other, and him
[5:07] that take away thy cloak, not to take
[5:11] also.
[5:13] And give to every man that askth of
[5:16] thee. And to him that taketh away thy
[5:19] goods, ask them not again.
[5:23] And as you would do to do also to them
[5:28] likewise.
[5:30] For if you love them which love you,
[5:33] what thank ye? For sinners also love
[5:36] them that love them.
[5:39] If you do good to them which do good to
[5:41] you, what thank ye for sinners also do
[5:46] even the same.
[5:48] And if ye lend them to whom ye have
[5:51] hoped to receive, what thank have ye?
[5:55] For sinners also lend to sinners to
[5:58] receive as much again.
[6:04] [Music]
[6:05] Hoping for nothing again. And your
[6:07] reward shall be great and these shall
[6:12] be
[6:15] heful and to the evil.
[6:18] Be ye therefore merciful as your father
[6:22] also is merciful. Amen. God bless you.
[6:39] Thank you, brother Collie.
[6:43] You know that Matthew chapter 6, that's
[6:45] that's my go-to scripture. Sometimes we
[6:48] get in the way the world thinks, you
[6:50] know, do good to those who do good to,
[6:52] but that's not what we're called to.
[6:54] We're called to love the unlovable.
[6:56] We're called to be a witness to those
[6:57] who seemingly don't deserve kindness.
[7:00] Amen. That's the Christian life. And
[7:03] that's what Jesus set as the example. So
[7:06] whenever you want to um and you know
[7:08] that scripture there, that chapter, not
[7:10] to keep talking, but it reminds me of
[7:13] there's a time in the scripture where
[7:14] Jesus said, "Enter into the glories of
[7:16] the Lord." He said, "Well, what do we do
[7:18] to deserve it?" He said, "When I was
[7:20] hungry, you fed me. When when I had a
[7:22] need, you be aware of those things. Ask
[7:25] the Lord each day, lead me, God, to be
[7:28] part of this scripture you said we
[7:29] should be as Christians, as believers.
[7:32] Let the love of God show through in a in
[7:35] a world that the love is just growing
[7:37] cold now and and you see darkness
[7:39] everywhere. Be that light. Go to Matthew
[7:42] 6 and say, "Lord, read read over it over
[7:44] it over it and lead me by your spirit to
[7:47] be that." Amen. Amen. Let's sing that
[7:49] song, the master of the wind. Amen. He's
[7:52] the master of every circumstance in our
[7:54] life, and we're thankful for that.
[8:01] I know the master of the
[8:07] wind.
[8:08] Oh, I know the maker of the
[8:15] rain. And he can calm the storm, make
[8:20] the sun shine again.
[8:25] And I know the master of the wind. Oh,
[8:29] let's sing it once more.
[8:33] And I know the master of the
[8:39] way. And I know the maker of the
[8:47] rain. And he can calm the storm. Make
[8:51] the sun shine again.
[8:56] And I know the master of the
[9:03] wind. My boat of life sails on a trouble
[9:10] sea. Ever there's a wind in my cell.
[9:19] But I have a
[9:21] friend who watches over
[9:25] me when the breeze turns into the
[9:33] G. And I know the master of the
[9:40] wind. Oh, I know the maker of the rain.
[9:47] [Music]
[9:50] He can calm the storms to make the sun
[9:54] shine
[9:57] again. And I know the master of the
[10:04] wind. And sometimes I soar like an eagle
[10:10] through the
[10:11] sky. Above the peaks my soul can be
[10:17] [Music]
[10:20] found. But an unexpected storm may drive
[10:24] me through the high. It may bring me low
[10:30] and never bring me
[10:35] down. And I know the master of the way.
[10:41] [Applause]
[10:44] And I know the maker of the
[10:47] rain.
[10:50] Hallelujah. And he can the stars make
[10:54] the sun shine
[10:58] again. And I know the man. Oh, let's
[11:01] sing that last verse again.
[11:05] Oh, and sometimes I soar like an eagle
[11:11] through the
[11:13] sky. Above the peaks my soul can be
[11:21] found. But an unexpected storm may drive
[11:26] me through the highs. It may bring me
[11:30] low and never bring me down.
[11:36] Hallelujah. I know the master of the
[11:41] know this
[11:44] morning. I know the maker of the
[11:51] rain. And he can calm the storms make
[11:55] the sun shine again.
[12:00] I know the master of the
[12:05] wind. Oh, and I know the master of the
[12:13] wind. Oh, I know the maker of the
[12:21] rain. For he can calm the storm, make
[12:26] the sun shine again.
[12:30] And I know the master of the
[12:34] wind. Hallelujah.
[12:37] Amen. I believe our brother Aaron
[12:39] Roberts, he has a special this morning
[12:41] if he'd like to come and sing it for us.
[12:56] Amen.
[12:58] Amen. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Praise
[13:00] the Lord.
[13:01] Um I have a song I want to sing this
[13:04] morning and uh thank sister Esther for
[13:08] helping me with it, working on this
[13:09] song.
[13:11] Um this month I've lost two men that uh
[13:15] I admired. Um one of you, some of y'all
[13:19] may know, uh Squire Parsons, the singer
[13:22] songwriter, passed away and had the
[13:24] opportunity to meet him more than once
[13:25] in my life. and always really admired
[13:28] him. Um, there's a lot of people that
[13:31] are in the music business, but some
[13:33] people are actually in the music
[13:34] ministry and I really believe Squire
[13:37] that was his calling. That was his
[13:39] heart. And uh, I want to sing this is
[13:42] the first song I sung of his in church.
[13:44] Sung it many years ago. I love this song
[13:46] and I want to sing it this morning. And
[13:49] uh my neighbor, our former neighbor, he
[13:52] was one of my instructors at Athens Tech
[13:54] in air conditioning and he passed away
[13:56] and
[13:58] uh I went to his funeral and we were in
[14:00] the f in the funeral and this song came
[14:03] on my on my mind as they were speaking
[14:06] and and I want I just been on my heart
[14:10] to to sing this song. I love this song.

[18:34] It's the standard.
[18:38] You've heard the story of Paul and
[18:41] Silas, how they were bound and thrown
[18:45] into
[18:47] jail. They kept on
[18:49] praying. They didn't
[18:52] worry. They were serving a God that
[18:55] could not
[18:57] fail. Well, long about
[18:59] midnight, God set an
[19:02] earthquake where the old
[19:05] foundation began to
[19:08] shake. Those prison doors blew open
[19:13] wide and Paul and Silas stepped outside.
[19:18] Yes, he'll deliver me in my time only
[19:23] like those Hebrew children from that
[19:27] fire. He freed and he made 5,000 two
[19:32] fishes and bread and he walked on the
[19:35] water and he raised the dead. And he
[19:39] stood by Daniel in the lion's den. He
[19:44] saved Moses from Pharaoh's
[19:49] men. Open the eyes of the blind to
[19:54] see. I know that he'll deliver
[19:57] me. Now it was David, my God,
[20:02] delivered when before Goliath did stand.
[20:08] He took no armor. He took no weapons,
[20:13] just five stones and a sling in his
[20:17] hand. Yes, he went
[20:20] running to meet that army. He met that
[20:25] Philistine man that stood mighty and
[20:28] tall.
[20:30] He said, "I come in the name of the
[20:34] Lord and know that mighty man did
[20:38] fall." Yes, he'll deliver me and my time
[20:43] on me like those Hebrew children from
[20:47] that fire. He freed and he fed 5,000
[20:51] with two fishes and bread and he walked
[20:55] on the water and he raised the dead when
[20:59] he stood by Daniel in the lion's den. He
[21:05] saved old Moses from Pharaoh's
[21:09] men. Open the eyes of the blind to

[21:33] weapons, just five stones and a stink in
[21:37] his
[21:38] hand. Yes, he went
[21:40] running to meet that army. He met that
[21:45] Philistine man that stood mighty and

[21:53] the
[21:54] Lord. I know that mighty band did
[21:58] fall." Yes, he'll deliver me in my time
[22:03] of need. those Hebrew children from that

[22:16] water and he raised the dead when he
[22:20] stood by Daniel in the lion's den. He
[22:25] saved all Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[22:31] the eyes of the blind to
[22:35] see. I know that he'll deliver
[22:38] me. Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of
[22:44] need. Like those Hebrew children from
[22:47] that fire. He freed and he fed 5,000
[22:52] with two fishes and bread. And he walked
[22:56] on the water and he raised the dead with
[23:00] Easter by Daniel in the lion's den. He
[23:05] saved old Moses from Pharaoh's
[23:10] men. Open the eyes of the blind to
[23:15] see. I know that you deliver me.
[23:19] Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of need
[23:25] like those Hebrew children that fire. He

[23:34] and bread and he walked on the water and
[23:38] he raised the dead and he stood by
[23:42] Daniel in the lion's den. He saved old
[23:47] Moses from Pharaoh's
[23:50] men. Open the eyes of the blind to
[23:55] see. I know that he'll deliver me.
[24:03] Amen.

[24:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[24:11] Amen. Thank God. Amen. And we can say
[24:15] that he's delivered you. You've seen him
[24:16] move in your life and you've seen him.
[24:19] You've seen the hand of God when there
[24:20] was no way. He made a way. Amen. God
[24:24] bless you this morning. Amen. Amen.
[24:26] Let's just give the Lord a hand clap of
[24:28] praise this morning.
[24:34] You may be seated.

[24:40] Christ, a living God.
[24:43] He's just not back there doing miracles.
[24:46] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[24:48] forever. Hallelujah. Still raising the
[24:50] dead. Still feeding more than 5,000.
[24:53] Have you been fed in your life
[24:55] spiritually, naturally? Amen.

[25:00] special for her uh to come up and bless
[25:03] us. And if anyone else has a special,

[32:43] deliverance. Lord, I'm never in this
[32:48] home. sing. Let's sing that last verse
[32:51] again. Oh, and I can see the family
[32:57] gather sweet faces all
[33:03] familiar. And no one knows our feeble
[33:08] anymore.
[33:09] [Music]
[33:12] This lonesome
[33:15] heart is crying. So I'll spread my
[33:19] wings. Let's all stand as a brother
[33:21] comes this
[33:23] morning in this home. Sing also for that
[33:28] place. Hallelujah. I see the pride light
[33:33] that shine.
[33:35] It's just about
[33:39] hometown and I can't see the father
[33:44] standing at the
[33:48] door. This world is just a
[33:52] wilderness and I'm ready for
[33:55] deliverance.
[33:57] Oh, I never in this voice you sing
[34:06] before I see the bright light
[34:11] shine. It's just about home
[34:16] time and I can see my father
[34:21] standing at the
[34:24] door. His word is just a
[34:29] wilderness and I'm ready for
[34:34] deliverance. Lord, I'll never sing his
[34:38] home.
[34:47] It's good to be with you this morning.
[34:48] Hallelujah. I was reading a quote this
[34:51] morning about how you uh you you know
[34:54] you wake up in the morning on a Sunday
[34:56] morning, you might not be feeling that
[34:57] great and you might have troubles and
[34:59] things, but then you come to the house
[35:01] of God and get amongst the people of the
[35:03] Lord and they're all been prayed up and
[35:07] boy, you could feel the atmosphere
[35:08] walking in the door.
[35:11] Thank God for his presence this morning.
[35:14] G. I want to say uh the musicians can go
[35:17] ahead and be seated. I just have a few
[35:19] things to say and just remember um
[35:22] tomorrow is Memorial Day and which is
[35:26] you know that the holiday the
[35:28] celebration for the the ones that have
[35:29] given their lives. So we assure
[35:32] appreciate all the ones that that uh you
[35:35] you were related to you're related to
[35:37] all the ones that um your loved ones
[35:39] that had gave their lives for the
[35:41] freedoms that we have.
[35:44] You know it was Jesus that said that you
[35:46] know you you think about this you can
[35:48] there's a lot of things that we can do
[35:49] for one another but the greatest love
[35:51] that there is is when you give your life
[35:53] to somebody. Greater love hath no man
[35:56] than this, that he give his life, that
[35:58] he laid down his life for somebody else.
[36:01] And uh remember us this next woman week,
[36:03] we're going to be flying out to Arizona.
[36:05] We're going to be taking a little time
[36:07] for my wife and I for vacation and uh
[36:10] and then I'll be preaching for brother
[36:12] Chris Long next Sunday. Amen. And uh and
[36:14] the girls will be at the evening light
[36:16] fellowship camp u for a few days. So
[36:20] just pray for us that the Lord will give
[36:21] us traveling mercies and that the Lord
[36:23] will bless them at the camp and be with
[36:25] us. Amen. When we're when we're
[36:27] ministering for brother Chris over there
[36:29] in in
[36:30] Cottonwood. Well, uh this morning I want
[36:33] to read from Genesis chapter 14 and
[36:35] Revelation chapter 13. But before we go
[36:38] to the word, let's just go to the
[36:39] author. Lord God, we're so grateful for
[36:42] your many blessings to us this morning.
[36:44] We just thank you for your grace, Lord,
[36:46] and for the blessings that you've given
[36:47] to this church. And Lord, for your
[36:49] presence here this morning, Lord. And we
[36:51] just ask, Lord God, that you would come
[36:53] among us, Lord. And Lord, these things
[36:55] that we're going to study out this
[36:56] morning. I pray that you would just pick
[36:58] them up, Lord. And Lord, that they would
[37:00] be food for our souls, Lord. Amen. Lord
[37:02] God, Lord, we we ask, Lord, that you'll
[37:05] just send your anointing to tie
[37:07] everything together and make it plain,
[37:09] Lord Jesus. Lord, send your anointing
[37:11] among us, Lord, to make these things
[37:12] real to us, Lord. we ask in your
[37:14] precious name. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[37:16] Amen. So, uh I want to take just a a
[37:19] study uh this morning on the seal and
[37:22] the mark. And Genesis 14:14, we'll read
[37:25] it says, "Behold, thou hast driven me
[37:28] out this day from the face of the earth.
[37:31] And from thy faith face shall I be hid,
[37:35] and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[37:38] in the earth. And it shall come to pass
[37:41] that everyone that findeth me shall slay
[37:44] me. And the Lord said unto him,
[37:47] Therefore, whosoever slayeth Cain,
[37:50] vengeance shall be taken on him
[37:52] sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon
[37:55] Cain, lest any finding him should kill
[37:58] him. And then if we go over to
[38:00] Revelation chapter 13 in verse 16, we'll
[38:03] read, "And he causeth all both small and
[38:08] great, rich and poor, free and bond, to
[38:13] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[38:17] their foreheads. and that no man might
[38:20] buy or sell save he that had the mark or
[38:25] the name of the beast or the number of
[38:28] his name. God bless you. You can take
[38:30] your
[38:31] seats. You know, I I I I was reading
[38:34] Revelation chapter 13 the other night
[38:36] and I
[38:37] u I I I ran up to the room where my wife
[38:40] was in and I was like, it's it's like
[38:43] reading the newspaper.
[38:46] Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that we
[38:48] have an understanding the day, the hour
[38:50] that we're living in that that you can
[38:53] we can read these things and the Bible
[38:54] is not just uh something obfuscated
[38:57] anymore, something we can't probe it,
[38:59] but it's something that we have clarity
[39:01] of. And you know, Brother Brham said
[39:03] that we need to be able to read the
[39:04] Bible like the newspaper to be because
[39:07] you know, it's it and today we're it's a
[39:09] present tense reality that the things
[39:11] we're reading of that used to be
[39:13] symbolic, now it's actually being
[39:15] unfolding. And I I'm so glad this
[39:18] morning that we've got a message to
[39:19] proclaim that we don't have to hunt for
[39:21] something to preach, that we don't have
[39:22] to probe, but we've got we've got so
[39:24] much there's no there's no end to things
[39:26] to preach. There's not enough time.
[39:28] There's not enough services to preach.
[39:30] This this is the we're living in this
[39:33] season of plenty. You know, thinking
[39:35] about how John there in in the book of
[39:37] Revelation, he went unto the angel and
[39:39] said, "Give me give me that book." And
[39:41] what he was taking was he was taking a
[39:43] revelation. Uh John ate the revealed
[39:46] word of the book. Not just not just book
[39:49] learning, something intellectual, but he
[39:51] was eating a revelation of what that
[39:53] book meant. And and that's our spiritual
[39:56] food in due season. And and brother
[39:58] Brandham would say, you know, as as time
[40:00] goes on, he would say that people have
[40:02] taken the gospel and turned it into, you
[40:04] know, modernist teachings. He said sin
[40:06] and unbelief by false teachers and
[40:08] modernists in the church had turned from
[40:10] God's word and this prophet to a modern
[40:13] theological ter terms of the word. But
[40:15] but we're not see today we're not
[40:16] preaching our own opinions, our own
[40:18] ideas or modern philosophy or modern
[40:22] psychology. But what we're preaching is
[40:24] a capstone scriptural vindicated message
[40:27] to to give us rapture and faith in the
[40:30] day and the hour that we're living in.
[40:32] In Revelation chapter 10, he said unto
[40:34] me, "Thou must prophesy again before
[40:36] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[40:39] kings that that the word that he
[40:41] received from that little book that he
[40:43] opened it up and it was plain. It was
[40:44] made plain. It wasn't sealed up anymore.
[40:46] And now he could he oh, you got
[40:48] something to preach. When the when you
[40:50] eat the book and you become the book,
[40:52] then you got something to preach." Now,
[40:54] now that the the reason I'm framing it
[40:56] up like that is we don't need anything
[40:58] modern to hold the young people. We
[41:01] don't need any modern activities or
[41:03] things to hold people. What you need is
[41:06] the word of God. The word is go of God
[41:08] is what'll give you strength in this
[41:10] hour that we're living in. We don't need
[41:12] all kind of activities and things to get
[41:14] people excited about coming to church.
[41:16] We don't need a long list of things to
[41:18] string out for people to if you come to
[41:20] church, you get a hot dog. If you come
[41:22] to church, you get a hamburger or
[41:24] something. But I tell you what'll
[41:25] attract an eagle is is I'll tell you
[41:28] what'll attract a real son or daughter
[41:29] of God is a word of God demonstrated in
[41:32] the power of the resurrection.
[41:35] And brother Brown was say he said we're
[41:37] living in a modern day. We got to get
[41:38] modern ideas. We got to have shuffle
[41:40] boards in the church, pingpong games and
[41:43] everything to hold our young people.
[41:44] Well, brother or sister, if it ever gets
[41:46] to a time that I have to have a card
[41:48] party in the church to hold an audience,
[41:50] I'll quit preaching the gospel cuz it's
[41:53] lost its power. I tell you, brother,
[41:55] what we need today is the oldfashioned
[41:57] simple gospel, Holy Ghost power preached
[42:00] in its simplicity. Then, if I be lifted
[42:03] up from the earth, I'll draw all men to
[42:05] me. You think what'll draw people to God
[42:08] is his it's that sacrifice that he made
[42:10] lifted up on that cross. if I'll be
[42:12] lifted up, that's what'll draw people to
[42:14] me. And we put all these fake things in
[42:16] front of people to thinking that it'll
[42:18] draw other draw people to the gospel
[42:19] because of that. When the word is what
[42:22] we need, the word is what will give you
[42:24] strength. You think, you know, even in
[42:26] the natural, if you if you go home and
[42:28] all you do is eat Doritos and Pringles
[42:31] and that's your whole diet, the next
[42:33] time a little flu bug comes around, then
[42:35] you're not going to be resistant because
[42:37] what you eat matters. And you've been
[42:39] eating, you've been eating, you've been
[42:40] filling up with potato chips and and all
[42:43] you've been drink instead of drinking
[42:44] water, you just been drinking Coke and
[42:45] Pepsi until you've just about gotten eye
[42:48] on to diabetes or something and when a
[42:50] little flu bug comes around or
[42:51] something, you're not going to be
[42:52] resistant. But I'm not really talking
[42:54] about the natural, though. I'm talking
[42:55] about the spiritual. If if you don't eat
[42:58] if you don't eat the revealed word of
[43:00] God for this day, you're not you're not
[43:02] going to be resistant to the to the to
[43:04] the to the to all the demonic bugs that
[43:06] he comes around. The word is what gives
[43:09] us strength and it's what wards off
[43:11] diseases. So if you want to have
[43:12] strength then get get focused into the
[43:15] word of God. Now now here's where we get
[43:17] into the meat. Brother Bram said in the
[43:20] last days there's going to be two
[43:22] classes of people. Amen. There's them
[43:26] that has the seal. Yep. And this and the
[43:29] others will have the mark of the beast.
[43:32] Now here's some real meat to give you
[43:33] strength. To give you some real
[43:35] strength. Now, you think all the way
[43:38] down through the scripture, there's
[43:39] always been these two classes of people
[43:42] on up to the last days where it
[43:44] culminates. It comes to a maturity. It
[43:47] comes to a place where he'd frame it up
[43:48] that, you know, the devil's got his grip
[43:50] on people. And the Bible said that the
[43:52] two spirits would be so close together,
[43:56] it will deceive the very elected if it
[44:01] was possible. Now, you think that's
[44:03] pretty close, isn't it? Oh, yes, sir.
[44:05] That's that's pretty close. Now, now you
[44:07] know our our mind goes to when we read
[44:09] about this, we start we immediately
[44:11] start looking around the church. Now,
[44:13] come on now. You know, you know that's
[44:14] true. Our mind immediately starts going
[44:16] around, let me see if I can spot it. Let
[44:18] me see if I can but but if if if I want
[44:21] to really discern it, let's discern it
[44:22] in our own self first and the rest will
[44:25] take care of itself. It wasn't that
[44:27] Jesus said, you don't tear up the wheat
[44:28] and the tear. You wait till it comes to
[44:30] maturity. You go don't go around tearing
[44:32] it up and say, I got it figured out.
[44:34] Bless God. I'mma point my finger at you
[44:36] and you're I got it. Because because
[44:38] many times you can't you can't tell
[44:41] until it comes to maturity and really
[44:43] manifests itself. Just like Judas that
[44:45] was sitting there with the disciples all
[44:46] day long for for for three and a half
[44:48] years sitting with them, eating with
[44:50] them and carrying their money back and
[44:51] doing all the things that he did and and
[44:53] and they didn't know even until right up
[44:55] at the very last Jesus told them what
[44:58] was going to happen. And their response
[44:59] was, "Is it is it me?" Now, I think
[45:02] that's a good response to have. Is it
[45:03] me? Because that way I I I I I can I can
[45:06] look into the word of God. And if I'm
[45:08] identified with the word of God and not
[45:10] my opinions and not some modern idea and
[45:13] not some psychology, that's where I get
[45:14] my strength from is when I've identified
[45:17] with the word of God. Amen. Now look,
[45:19] there's one with the seal of God and one
[45:21] with the mark of the beast. A seal and a
[45:24] mark. Two distinguishing
[45:26] characteristics.
[45:28] And brother Bram would say, he said,
[45:30] 'First, I'm going to tell you what I
[45:31] think the mark of the beast is. I think
[45:34] the scripture supports the mark of the
[45:36] beast to be, and then I'm going to tell
[45:38] you what I think the scripture supports
[45:41] the seal of God. Amen. These two great
[45:44] things are ending up soon into two great
[45:47] grips. I I love how he phrases things. I
[45:50] I love to just man just meditate on the
[45:52] the way he phrases it and and think
[45:55] about why he's saying it like that. two
[45:58] great grips. The world is gripped by
[46:02] these two things right now. Amen. Now,
[46:06] now let's let's think about it. Let
[46:08] let's let that mind that was that that
[46:10] was in Christ be in us. Let's let that
[46:12] word begin to absorb into us so that our
[46:15] thinking is changed. And as we listen to
[46:17] this, he's not saying it's something far
[46:19] off somewhere, but it's right now. right
[46:23] now, the mark of the beast or the seal
[46:26] of God and a grip. What's a grip? A firm
[46:29] grasp or possession. Yeah. Right. You
[46:31] grab a hold of something like the
[46:32] devil's got his grip on people today and
[46:35] and and and they're they're in a tight
[46:37] bind once you got your fist wrapped
[46:39] around an apple or something, you you
[46:42] you got it. You're not going to let go.
[46:44] And that's that's what's come to a place
[46:45] of maturity where the devil the devil's
[46:48] got his but on the other side Christ has
[46:50] got his and and and the devil's it's two
[46:53] great grips that that these two sides
[46:56] are now in such a grip until it's it's
[46:58] coming to the very end. The he said the
[47:00] world is gripped by these two things
[47:02] right now. The mark of the beast or the
[47:05] seal of God. And some of them places it
[47:07] way over in the future and some says
[47:09] it's already been in the past. But I
[47:10] believe that there's just two answers to
[47:12] it. Mhm. And that is that the seal of
[47:15] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[47:18] the mark of the beast is rejecting it.
[47:21] Now that's the only two things. And all
[47:24] the people now, now think about this
[47:26] now. Everybody you know, everybody in
[47:29] your family, everybody in the church,
[47:31] everybody in the world from the
[47:34] president, the Congress people,
[47:36] everybody at work, they're all going to
[47:38] be gripped by one or the other. All the
[47:42] people on earth in the last day is
[47:44] either going to be sealed by the seal of
[47:46] God or marked by the mark of the beast.
[47:49] So that now that means there ain't no
[47:50] halfway in. There ain't there's not in
[47:52] the middle of the road. Well, I'm just
[47:54] going to sit on the fence. You're going
[47:55] to be gripped by one or the other. And
[47:58] and if you're not sure where you stand.
[48:00] That's maybe the message today this
[48:02] morning. Be sure of where you stand.
[48:03] Because if you're not gripped by the
[48:05] seal of God, you are going to be gripped
[48:08] by the mark of the beast. you're going
[48:10] to be gripped by one or the other. And
[48:12] this morning, I want to clarify that
[48:14] people have probed at what the mark is
[48:15] for so long. They've Well, the mark I
[48:17] think the mark is the mark is not social
[48:19] security numbers. The mark is not a
[48:22] physical chip. That's right, brother.
[48:24] The mark is not a tattoo. The mark is
[48:27] not Now, hold on to your hat now. The
[48:29] mark is not the COVID vaccine.
[48:32] The mark is not wearing masks during CO.
[48:36] Brother Bob, no. That's not what it is.
[48:38] The mark is not your political party.
[48:41] The mark is not credit cards like they
[48:43] used to think. Well, well, we're getting
[48:45] away from the cash and we're now we're
[48:47] moving into the credit card. That's what
[48:48] they used to think. The credit card, you
[48:50] better stay away from them credit cards.
[48:51] That that's the mark. The but the mark
[48:53] has to be something spiritual.
[48:56] And you read over in Revelation 14 9 and
[48:59] 10. And the third angel followed them
[49:02] saying with a loud voice, if any man
[49:05] worship the beast and his image and
[49:07] receive his mark in his forehead or in
[49:10] his hand in his forehead. Now so that
[49:13] means just as the word changes your
[49:15] thinking then taking the mark rejecting
[49:19] the word will change your thinking. You
[49:22] think different because you have been
[49:25] you have been marked a mark in his
[49:27] forehead or in his hand and you'll act
[49:30] different too. It will be a visible
[49:32] sign. The same shall drink of the wine
[49:35] of the wrath of God which is poured out
[49:37] without mixture into the cup of his
[49:38] indignation and he shall be tormented
[49:40] with fire and brimstone in the presence
[49:42] of the holy angels and in the presence
[49:44] of the lamb. That doesn't sound very
[49:46] nice. I I I I I I feel very inclined to
[49:50] stay as far away from that as I can. You
[49:53] know, if you really grasp what that's
[49:55] saying, it behooves us all to really get
[49:58] into the word of the hour because that
[50:00] is the only way to escape the things
[50:02] that are coming on the face of the
[50:03] earth. Amen.
[50:06] Let's read in Revelation chapter 13.
[50:12] And this is what I was saying. It it
[50:14] reads like it reads like the newspaper.
[50:17] John in Revelation 13:1 he said, "And I
[50:20] stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a
[50:24] beast rise up out of the sea." And we
[50:27] know that's people that the the people
[50:29] the pe the spirit in the people actually
[50:31] elevates the pope to his position. The
[50:33] spirit of the people elevate elevate all
[50:36] all it it it actually produces this this
[50:39] thing. Out of the out of the sea rises
[50:41] the beast. And of course we know what
[50:43] that is. That's the Roman Catholic
[50:45] Church having seven heads and 10 horns
[50:47] that it's a seven heads is a it's a
[50:49] parallel thing. It means those seven
[50:51] phases of the of of come from coming
[50:54] from pagal Rome to papal Rome. But it
[50:57] also means the seven mountains, the
[50:59] seven hills that are there in Rome and
[51:01] 10 horns. Those those dictators, the
[51:03] different rulers that that uh are come
[51:06] up out of him to give it to give him his
[51:08] authority and so forth. And upon his
[51:09] horns, 10 crowns, and upon his heads the
[51:12] name of blasphemy. uh just right out of
[51:15] that scripture there. There's so many
[51:16] sermons that Brother Brian preached,
[51:18] blasphemous names and so many things. If
[51:20] you keep reading, so there's one beast,
[51:22] a beast that come up out of the sea, but
[51:24] you keep reading and there's another
[51:26] beast. Now, this beast is why you better
[51:29] be careful getting all wound up in
[51:31] politics and things. You better be
[51:33] careful what you support or what you
[51:35] endorse. Come on. And and Revelation
[51:37] 13:117 to 11-17 says in verse 11, it
[51:40] says, "And I beheld another beast coming
[51:43] up out of the earth. And he had two
[51:47] horns like a lamb." Now, so now we got
[51:49] another beast that's coming up out of
[51:51] the earth. And brother Ram said that was
[51:53] the American buffalo coming up out of
[51:55] the earth. And he had two horns that
[51:57] were civil and ecclesiastical power. In
[51:59] other words, when you get those two
[52:01] powers united, now now you got a you got
[52:04] a beast that's got some power that can
[52:06] do some things. And he spake as a dragon
[52:09] and he exercises all the power of the
[52:12] first be first beast before him. He in
[52:15] other words, look look at how the Roman
[52:17] Catholic Church worked. How how down
[52:20] through the Middle Ages, they would uh I
[52:22] if you if you didn't agree with them,
[52:25] then here they come. They're going to
[52:26] drag you out of your your home and
[52:28] they're going to kill you. And and so
[52:30] you can see look at the characteristics
[52:31] is what it's saying. Look at how the
[52:33] Catholic Church operated. And then now
[52:36] look at how this mirror how these how
[52:38] these other beasts work and how they're
[52:41] going to operate. It's comparing this
[52:43] one to this one. He exercisth all the
[52:46] power of the first beast before him and
[52:48] causeth the earth and them which dwell
[52:49] therein to worship the first beast whose
[52:51] deadly wound was healed. And he doeth
[52:54] great wonders so that he maketh fire
[52:56] come down from heaven on the earth in
[52:57] the sight of me and Nagasaki. And you
[53:00] might cause a nuclear bomb to explode
[53:01] and a whole world's Whoa. How how do
[53:03] they do that? How do they Well, they got
[53:05] some men out there in the desert and got
[53:07] to thinking and and and and they did
[53:09] something wondrous, destructive, but
[53:11] wondrous. and deceiveth them that dwell
[53:13] on the earth by the means of those
[53:15] miracles which he had power to do in the
[53:17] sight of the beast, saying to them that
[53:19] dwell on the earth, that they should
[53:20] make an image to the beast, which had
[53:23] the wound by a sword, and did live. And
[53:26] he had power to give life unto the image
[53:29] of the beast. Now, here's here's so
[53:31] we've got a beast that rose up out of
[53:33] the sea, and we got a beast that rose up
[53:35] out of the earth. And now this beast
[53:37] that rose up out of the earth. Now he's
[53:39] going to make an image to the beast, to
[53:42] that first beast,
[53:44] that the image of the beast, he had
[53:46] power to give life unto it that it
[53:48] should speak and cause that as many as
[53:51] would not worship the image of the beast
[53:55] should be killed. Yep. And he calleseth
[53:58] all both small and great, rich and poor,
[54:01] free and bond, to receive a mark in
[54:04] their right hand or in their foreheads.
[54:07] And that no man might buy or sell save
[54:10] he that had the mark or the name of the
[54:12] beast or the number of his name. Look at
[54:15] look at the mechanisms of this second
[54:17] beast.
[54:18] He enforces laws, boycots, and
[54:21] regulations to restrict those outside
[54:23] the system, just like the first beast.
[54:26] Now, here comes the second beast. Now,
[54:28] he's he's he's working in the same mode
[54:30] as the first beast. It's not the first
[54:32] beast, but he's got the same
[54:34] characteristics and things as it comes
[54:36] to maturity. Amen. Now, let's pause for
[54:38] a second cuz I thank God that that the
[54:41] devil don't come down until the bride
[54:43] comes up. So, we ain't going to see if
[54:45] you're if you're sealed in God, you
[54:47] ain't going to see the full
[54:48] manifestation of what this turns into.
[54:51] But, but I'm framing this up for you so
[54:53] you have an understanding that you
[54:54] better be sure of where you stand
[54:56] because this is what's it's turning
[54:58] into. Well, well, I think I think our
[55:00] nation is so sweet and nice. But,
[55:03] Revelation 13 is the the chapter that
[55:06] talks about the the United States of
[55:07] America and what we're coming to and
[55:10] it's going to form an image. And what's
[55:12] the image? the World Council of
[55:14] Churches, denominational unity coming
[55:16] together to mirror Rome's authority,
[55:19] forcing all religious bodies under one
[55:23] federated system. And it creates a
[55:25] system of force where now because civil
[55:28] and ecclesiastic power are united, you
[55:30] better do what they say or else they're
[55:33] going to come for you. They're going to
[55:34] come and get you. you better do it
[55:36] because they're working in the same mode
[55:38] that the Roman Catholic Church did down
[55:41] through the middle ages down through
[55:42] history because it's an image to that
[55:45] beast and they will so they will
[55:47] ultimately use legal prosecution social
[55:50] ostracism and even martyrdom against
[55:53] dissenters right now another one of the
[55:56] the final mechanisms of that second
[55:58] beast is deception
[56:01] because it presents itself like a lamb
[56:04] Amen.
[56:06] In other words, it presents itself like
[56:09] a Christian.
[56:11] It presents itself like a Christian.
[56:14] Now, now this is why, you know, the
[56:16] scripture says that everybody will be
[56:19] deceived except for the elect. And
[56:21] you'll find that, you know, people, they
[56:23] look like they've got blinders on their
[56:25] eyes almost to where you can say
[56:28] somebody can come out and say, "Well,
[56:29] I'm a Christian." And it's like
[56:31] everybody just falls for them. But this
[56:33] is this is actually one of the
[56:34] mechanisms of the second beast is it
[56:38] presents itself like a lamb. In other
[56:41] words, listen, if somebody says they're
[56:42] a Christian, you let's say let's say
[56:45] maybe uh maybe some Sunday there's
[56:48] another preacher up here preaching
[56:49] behind the pullpit and they say that
[56:50] they're a Christian, but you better
[56:52] listen to what they say. You better
[56:54] listen when you when you when you're
[56:56] listening online to somebody that says
[56:58] they're a Christian, that says they're a
[56:59] real message believer. Listen carefully
[57:01] to what they say. But I thank God that
[57:03] God give us this word of the hour to
[57:05] give us resistance to things. That's why
[57:07] we don't have to we don't have to worry
[57:08] about you listening to other things. We
[57:10] don't have to put a put a declaration
[57:12] out. You better not go listen to this
[57:13] one over here. You better not you better
[57:15] be careful when you go to camp meetings
[57:17] because you've been fed by the word. You
[57:19] ain't been fed on gospel Doritos and
[57:21] potato chips. You've been fed on the
[57:23] real word of the hour. So you've got
[57:25] some resistance and you know what you're
[57:27] listening to. Listen, this is the
[57:29] mechanism that that second beast uses.
[57:32] Deception, hiding its dragonlike nature.
[57:37] Hiding its dragonlike nature. Now, now
[57:39] isn't that isn't that that should maybe
[57:41] scare you a little bit that that this
[57:43] beast could come in and hide its true
[57:46] nature or or any deceiver could hide its
[57:49] true nature and present itself as
[57:52] something that it's not and the whole
[57:55] world would fall for it. Don't fall for
[57:59] it. Don't fall for it. And the only way
[58:02] you won't fall for it is if you have
[58:04] been eating the word of God. Cuz the
[58:06] word of God is what gives you
[58:08] resistance. In Matthew 24:25, Jesus
[58:11] said, "There shall arise false Christ
[58:13] and false prophets and shall so show
[58:16] great signs and wonders in so much that
[58:19] if it were possible,
[58:21] they shall deceive the very elect."
[58:25] Now, we started off looking at a
[58:28] mark. The whole world's going to take a
[58:30] How many I wonder people how many people
[58:31] are not going to take the mark. You
[58:33] know, Brother Brandon, the way he
[58:34] preached it, he he compared it to like
[58:37] uh Noah and his family. Eight. And then,
[58:40] whoa, whoa. He actually pulled back and
[58:42] compared it to Enoch. Just one. Just
[58:44] one. Just one. And then he preached that
[58:46] sermon. One in a million. Just do you
[58:49] think about how few there will be? And I
[58:53] know I know people for years have shied
[58:55] away from preaching it like this. We
[58:56] want to just preach that everybody
[58:57] that's in the message. Everybody that
[58:59] believes like we or or says that they
[59:01] do. Everybody's sealed. But but listen,
[59:04] the only thing that's going to bear
[59:05] witness of whether you're sealed is
[59:07] whether you really got the seal or not.
[59:09] It's not whether you say you do, but
[59:11] whether you actually do. So what is a
[59:13] seal? Well, the first place a seal in
[59:15] the Bible, brother Ram said, back in
[59:17] days before people had it educated like
[59:18] they are now, their
[59:20] seal was their signature
[59:24] just like we use today as our name.
[59:30] So the seal is somebody's name.
[59:34] The seal is a name. Now you think now
[59:37] here we got a mark and we got a seal. In
[59:40] the old days, he'd he'd frame it up like
[59:42] this. if they couldn't sign their name,
[59:44] that seal, you can't, you know, you're
[59:46] trying to make an agreement. You maybe
[59:47] you you write somebody writes down a a
[59:50] sale or whatever. They're sailing a cow
[59:52] or whatever and they can't write their
[59:53] name. So, they'll put a mark, maybe put
[59:56] some wax on it, seal it up, and that
[59:58] represents their name. To try to copy
[1:00:02] that was a capital fine just like it
[1:00:04] would be now to try to forge a check.
[1:00:07] Somebody's name on a check. So it's like
[1:00:10] it's like a check and you instead of
[1:00:12] writing your name, you forward somebody
[1:00:14] else's name. That would be a capital
[1:00:16] fine. So that seal is somebody's name
[1:00:19] and they would seal it instead of
[1:00:21] signing his name. The seal therefore was
[1:00:24] an extension or emblem by which the
[1:00:28] bearer authenticated possessions,
[1:00:31] decrees or personal commitments.
[1:00:34] Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the
[1:00:36] Holy Spirit, whereby you are sealed
[1:00:38] until the day of redemption." So that
[1:00:40] seal is your baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:42] Why, what's it got to do with his name?
[1:00:44] Hold on just a second. In 2 Corinthians
[1:00:47] chapter 1, it says, "Now he which
[1:00:48] establishth us, which is with you in
[1:00:50] Christ, and hath anointed us, is God,
[1:00:52] who hath also sealed us, and given the
[1:00:56] earnest of the spirit in our hearts."
[1:00:58] Yes, brother. The seal was used instead
[1:01:01] of a name and that name of Jesus, the
[1:01:04] name of Jesus Christ is the seal of God.
[1:01:10] The name of Jesus Christ. Now, now this
[1:01:13] is why brother Brown all you see all
[1:01:15] these stories and things are just coming
[1:01:17] coming to a head all at once. A name is
[1:01:20] more than just a sound or a title. A
[1:01:24] name represents your nature. Y it
[1:01:27] represents your character. It represents
[1:01:30] your authority and it represents where
[1:01:32] you come from. If somebody knows your
[1:01:35] name, they can you can trace your name
[1:01:36] all the way back to to the hills in
[1:01:38] Ireland or Scotland or wherever they
[1:01:40] come from. If you if your name has been
[1:01:42] carried all the way through cuz that's
[1:01:44] what your name represents. And brother
[1:01:46] Brandham years ago, he'd say, "What
[1:01:49] difference does the name mean?" Like
[1:01:51] when you're naming your children, right?
[1:01:54] Come on, brother. You think about how
[1:01:55] how how much effort we took in naming
[1:01:57] our kids because of these statements
[1:01:58] that brother made and and maybe maybe we
[1:02:01] didn't truly understand what he's saying
[1:02:04] that your name means something. He said
[1:02:07] it sure it means something. Your name
[1:02:11] characterizes your life. Right. Amen.
[1:02:14] Now, what if what if Jesus Christ seals
[1:02:16] you with his name to characterize that
[1:02:19] the life of Jesus Christ is now living
[1:02:21] in you? And that same authority, that
[1:02:23] same power, the same origin, the same
[1:02:27] everything that's represented by that
[1:02:28] name is now sealed in you. It's sealed
[1:02:31] his name. He said, "Now, Brother Brham,
[1:02:33] when you're in numer numerology, no, I'm
[1:02:35] not. I'm on thus sayith the Lord." Why
[1:02:37] was it when Jacob, he lived to his name
[1:02:40] as a deceiver, supplanter, Jacob and
[1:02:42] when God changed him, he changed his
[1:02:45] name. God changed Saul to Paul, Simon to
[1:02:49] Peter. Certainly, it has something. And
[1:02:51] Ricky and Elvis, and such names as that
[1:02:54] is the modern American name, which
[1:02:56] throws a child automatically right into
[1:02:58] that. See what I mean? The name of Jesus
[1:03:02] Christ is his identity. Oh. Oh, your
[1:03:05] name means something. And if God seals
[1:03:07] you with his name, then that means
[1:03:09] something. It means something for for
[1:03:11] eternal life. It means something to the
[1:03:13] devil. His identity, his nature, his
[1:03:16] life, his characteristics, his
[1:03:18] authority, his origin, his character. So
[1:03:21] that means that when Jesus said there,
[1:03:23] he said, "Whatsoever you shall ask in my
[1:03:25] name, that will I do." Now, there's a
[1:03:30] token you can hold up over your prayer.
[1:03:31] Amen. When you have a need, if you if
[1:03:34] you're sealed by his name,
[1:03:37] if you shall ask anything, Amen. in my
[1:03:40] name, right, I will do it. Amen. John
[1:03:43] 16, he said, "And in that day you shall
[1:03:45] ask me nothing, verily, verily, I say
[1:03:47] unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the
[1:03:50] Father in my name, he will give it to
[1:03:52] you." Now, that ain't just tacking a
[1:03:54] little phrase on the end of your prayer
[1:03:56] like we say. Say a prayer for I don't
[1:03:58] like that. Brother Ram didn't like that.
[1:03:59] Say a prayer. We don't say a prayer. We
[1:04:01] get into a relationship with God and
[1:04:04] we're praying because we know who we're
[1:04:06] praying to and we know where we come
[1:04:07] from. And we're we're not just reciting
[1:04:09] words when we get on our knees, but
[1:04:11] we're entering into a fellowship with
[1:04:13] God. Hither too. He said, "You've asked
[1:04:15] me nothing in my name until the new
[1:04:18] until the power of the of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:20] fell on the day of Pentecost. Nobody had
[1:04:22] asked anything in his name. Ask and you
[1:04:24] shall receive that your joy may be
[1:04:26] full." What a promise we've got access
[1:04:28] to this morning. That if you ask in his
[1:04:31] name, not just from an intellectual
[1:04:33] conception, not knowing what that means.
[1:04:35] Amen. Not just reciting some words,
[1:04:37] tagging some words on at the end of your
[1:04:39] prayer, but you're asking because you're
[1:04:42] asking from a position of the power of
[1:04:44] the Holy Ghost in your life. And you're
[1:04:46] asking because Christ has stamped your
[1:04:48] life with his seal of approval and
[1:04:50] verified that he's he's now your his
[1:04:52] character is living in you. His
[1:04:54] character abides in you. In John 16, he
[1:04:57] said, "These things have I spoken unto
[1:04:59] you in Proverbs, but the time cometh
[1:05:01] when I shall no more speak unto you in
[1:05:03] Proverbs, but I shall show you plainly
[1:05:05] of the Father. At that day, you shall
[1:05:07] ask in my name, and I say not unto you
[1:05:10] that I will pray the Father for you."
[1:05:12] Cuz why? Because he's living in you.
[1:05:14] He's You don't need somebody else to
[1:05:16] pray. You don't need to go to a Catholic
[1:05:18] church and get a priest to pray for you
[1:05:20] or get go go go to Mary or something and
[1:05:22] have an interceder, but you can ask God
[1:05:25] directly because his life is in you and
[1:05:28] his name means his life is in the
[1:05:30] believer and you have access to the
[1:05:33] promises. And there's we've got that
[1:05:35] promise to the overcomer there in
[1:05:36] Revelation chapter 3. Him that
[1:05:38] overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the
[1:05:40] temple of my God and ye shall go no more
[1:05:42] out and I will ride upon them the name
[1:05:44] of my God. You take that same the same
[1:05:47] characteristics and the same nature and
[1:05:49] write on the heart of a believer. It's
[1:05:51] the same the same God living in you
[1:05:54] living in your flesh. I will write on
[1:05:56] him the name of my God and the name of
[1:05:58] the city of my God which is New
[1:05:59] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:06:01] heaven from my God. Amen. And I will
[1:06:04] write upon him my new name. And
[1:06:06] everybody everybody's been looking for
[1:06:08] what that new name is. But it's not
[1:06:10] going to be something different from
[1:06:11] Jesus Christ because you're never going
[1:06:13] to get away from the character and the
[1:06:14] nature of Jesus Christ. And I tell you
[1:06:16] what will continue to unfold though is
[1:06:18] more about his character. May I when you
[1:06:21] when you come to a place of of maturity
[1:06:24] then it it mean he means something
[1:06:26] different than he did when you were just
[1:06:28] a little baby. It means something
[1:06:30] different. And a new name means that
[1:06:32] something has changed. Something
[1:06:35] different. Something's different than it
[1:06:37] was before. A new name means something
[1:06:39] has changed because a name means the
[1:06:42] character and all the authority and all
[1:06:44] of that packaged up and it's something
[1:06:46] that represented and the name is your
[1:06:48] seal.
[1:06:49] You think about all the ones that that
[1:06:51] got a name changed. Abraham, Abram to
[1:06:54] Abraham, Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to
[1:06:57] Israel. Y even Moses Moses didn't call
[1:07:02] Ohea by his real name in Numbers I think
[1:07:05] it's Numbers 13. He called Ohea Joshua.
[1:07:07] Yep. Right. He and Joshua got a name
[1:07:09] change. Simon to Peter. Saul to Paul
[1:07:14] because what they they got a character
[1:07:16] change. And because they their character
[1:07:19] was changed, their name was changed
[1:07:20] along with it. And brother Brandon will
[1:07:23] say now Jesus said in the last days
[1:07:25] according to St. Matthew the 24th
[1:07:27] chapter and the 24th verse that these
[1:07:30] two spirits Yep. the ones that would se
[1:07:33] was sealed with God and the ones that
[1:07:35] would be marked by the beast the
[1:07:36] antichrist
[1:07:38] would be so close together amen
[1:07:42] until it would deceive the very elected
[1:07:46] if it was possible
[1:07:48] like two vines out in the garden
[1:07:50] wrapping around a fence post and like
[1:07:52] which is which they're going to be so
[1:07:55] much alike amen he said now well some
[1:07:58] people says well communism is the mark
[1:08:00] of the beast
[1:08:02] You're wrong.
[1:08:04] Communism is not the mark of the beast.
[1:08:07] Yet it is. Now look how he said that.
[1:08:08] Communism is not the be mark of the
[1:08:10] beast. Yet it is. But it isn't heading
[1:08:12] up. Because the mark of the beast is
[1:08:15] anything rejecting the seal of God. So
[1:08:19] in a sense, you could say it is, but it
[1:08:21] ain't heading up. It's not. You follow
[1:08:23] the track along and and if you get off
[1:08:26] and look at communism as the mark of the
[1:08:27] beast, you're getting off off your
[1:08:29] course. So the mark of the beast is not
[1:08:31] communism. The mark of the beast it
[1:08:33] moves on up until and and and the mark
[1:08:36] of the beast is what? It's of a
[1:08:38] religious nature.
[1:08:40] Very religious.
[1:08:42] Now there's there's the thing. It's very
[1:08:44] religious. So cunning and sly until
[1:08:46] it'll deceive the very elected if it was
[1:08:49] possible by coming in like a little
[1:08:52] lamb. Well, I'm a Christian. Well, he
[1:08:55] must be a Christian. He says he's a
[1:08:57] Christian. How you going to tell the
[1:08:59] difference?
[1:09:00] Look at the word and look at the fruits
[1:09:03] that are borne by the doctrine that that
[1:09:04] person possesses. Compare compare with
[1:09:07] the scripture. Amen. It'll be so close
[1:09:09] that the very elected could be deceived
[1:09:11] if it will be possible. Now, now we
[1:09:15] we're taking it maybe from the negative
[1:09:16] side, but look at the positive. We we've
[1:09:18] got an elect lady sitting here this
[1:09:20] morning that can listen to a minister
[1:09:21] and tell if it's food for their soul.
[1:09:23] Amen.
[1:09:24] Isn't Isn't that something when you go
[1:09:26] sit into a a special meeting or
[1:09:27] somewhere and something just resonates
[1:09:29] within your heart and you're like that
[1:09:31] that's that's food for my soul. I I'm
[1:09:33] going to take that home with me and and
[1:09:34] it makes me want to go pray more. It
[1:09:36] makes me want to go read my Bible more.
[1:09:38] It makes me want to get along with God
[1:09:40] more. And and you begin to something's
[1:09:42] pulling at you cuz you recognize that
[1:09:44] that's really something that you need.
[1:09:46] the elect lady. We're going to There's
[1:09:48] going to be an elect lady that can tell
[1:09:50] the difference between true doctrine and
[1:09:54] false, between genuine and artificial
[1:09:56] fruits. Now listen to how brother Brown
[1:09:59] said this. He said, "Every sign, every
[1:10:02] wonder anointed man, prophecy, all kinds
[1:10:07] of things going forth, all kinds of
[1:10:10] signs, all kinds of
[1:10:13] wonders." That sounds very deceptive,
[1:10:16] doesn't it? Yeah. How you going to tell
[1:10:18] the difference? And he said, "Watch the
[1:10:21] word for this aisle." Amen. When Jesus
[1:10:24] come and brought the test and said,
[1:10:25] "Search the scriptures, for in them you
[1:10:27] think you have eternal life, and they
[1:10:28] are they that testify of me." Could they
[1:10:30] stand the test? Look how Look how he's
[1:10:33] framing this up. Right, y'all. Y'all
[1:10:35] bear with me now. It's only been 30
[1:10:37] minutes. Y'all sung for an hour, so I'm
[1:10:38] going I'm going to preach until my
[1:10:39] heart's contents.
[1:10:44] Search the scripture. Here's Jesus
[1:10:46] Christ, the word interpreted, standing
[1:10:48] in front of them. And and he's he's
[1:10:51] saying the word test. The word test is
[1:10:53] maybe not like we used to say back in
[1:10:54] the old days where we get real upset
[1:10:56] with one another and give each other our
[1:10:58] version of what the word test. If you
[1:10:59] agree with my opinion of it, then you're
[1:11:01] right. And if you don't agree with it,
[1:11:03] then you're wrong. No, he's saying he's
[1:11:04] saying there's the word standing in
[1:11:06] front of them and and go search the
[1:11:09] scriptures and see if the word standing
[1:11:11] there does the things that the Bible
[1:11:13] said he would do. Now that's the word
[1:11:15] test. He said anyone knows all
[1:11:18] confessions of rocks that can't stand
[1:11:19] the word test is thrown into the heap.
[1:11:22] It cracked is cracked. Water broke. It
[1:11:24] won't stand the test. Oh man, then be
[1:11:26] sent to the scrap heap. God has always
[1:11:28] counted character instead of numbers.
[1:11:31] And does God ever change his mind? He's
[1:11:33] He's talking about how that sto two men,
[1:11:35] Joshua and Caleb, there at Kadesh Barnea
[1:11:38] stood on they they were the only ones
[1:11:40] that passed the word test. And what was
[1:11:42] the word test that they passed? God is
[1:11:45] more than able to deliver these giants
[1:11:48] into our hands. And everybody else did
[1:11:50] not agree with their with their
[1:11:52] accepting the word of their day and
[1:11:54] saying, "I don't care how many giants
[1:11:56] there are. I don't care what the doctor
[1:11:58] says. I don't care passing the word test
[1:12:01] is agreeing with what the word says
[1:12:04] about you and about the day that you're
[1:12:06] living in." Two men stood on that word.
[1:12:08] Caleb and Joshua said, "Wait a minute.
[1:12:11] You two million people shut up just a
[1:12:13] minute is what he said. We are more than
[1:12:15] able to do it. See, we are more than a
[1:12:17] match for them. What was they basing on?
[1:12:20] God said, "I've given you the land as
[1:12:24] yours." The word test means judging all
[1:12:27] things by the word of God, not by
[1:12:29] personal reasoning, religious tradition,
[1:12:32] the tradition of your church or mental
[1:12:34] knowledge. It is not knowledge in the
[1:12:36] intellectual or academic sense. It ain't
[1:12:38] human wisdom, philosophy, or learning,
[1:12:40] or religious creeds, or church
[1:12:42] traditions. God gave Adam and Eve his
[1:12:45] word, and he has never changed it.
[1:12:48] Our defense is the word.
[1:12:53] You know, you know, if Adam and Eve
[1:12:54] would have just stayed fortified right
[1:12:55] behind that word, I was going through
[1:12:58] Walmart or somewhere the other day
[1:12:59] thinking about that. If we just stay
[1:13:00] fortified by the behind the word, then
[1:13:03] the devil can't get us. That's right.
[1:13:05] Just stay behind the word. Soon as they
[1:13:06] slipped out from behind the word and
[1:13:08] here comes the devil sliding right into
[1:13:09] the human race injecting himself. Yes
[1:13:12] sir. Now we find we want to find out
[1:13:15] where they come from. Where do these two
[1:13:18] where did these two things come from?
[1:13:20] Where did this all
[1:13:21] start? The first marking of a human
[1:13:24] being started in Genesis. Genesis 4:15
[1:13:27] when God marked Cain. Amen. God marked
[1:13:30] you. You think God Cain Cain kills his
[1:13:34] brother and God's reaction is y'all
[1:13:37] better not kill Cain
[1:13:40] and he puts a mark on him. And Cain goes
[1:13:43] right out of the presence of God. Soon
[1:13:45] as he's marked, he goes right out of the
[1:13:47] presence of God. God's saying so many
[1:13:50] times that human nature wants to, well,
[1:13:52] I'm I'm going to take somebody did
[1:13:53] something wrong to me. I'm I'm going to
[1:13:55] do I'm I'm going to do something to
[1:13:56] them. But you know, God just cut it off
[1:13:58] right there. No, we're we're not going
[1:14:00] we're not doing that. He he just chopped
[1:14:03] it right off. Thy seed shall bruise the
[1:14:06] serpent's head and his head shall bruise
[1:14:08] thy heel. There's those two things. The
[1:14:10] seed of Christ and the seed of the
[1:14:13] serpent. And you you know you watch
[1:14:16] watch the characteristics of those two
[1:14:18] sides. Watch the lineage of Cain as Cain
[1:14:20] comes down. Scientist, smart men, great
[1:14:23] men on down like that. religious but
[1:14:26] carnal. Intellectual, lacking divine
[1:14:29] revelation, Antichrist spirit, Abel's
[1:14:32] murderer. He rejected divine order. He
[1:14:35] He the blood sacrifice was laid right in
[1:14:38] front of him. He didn't want nothing to
[1:14:39] do with it. He was like, "You're going
[1:14:41] if if I'm going to come to you, you're
[1:14:42] going to come to my way." What a
[1:14:45] horrible way to do it. But yet, you can
[1:14:47] see that same the same thing borne out
[1:14:50] today and the way that so many want to
[1:14:52] come to the gospel. If I'm gonna come to
[1:14:54] Christ, it's going to be my way.
[1:14:59] He acted out of jealousy. He was relying
[1:15:02] on his own works, reason, beauty, form,
[1:15:05] his own ideas about approaching God. But
[1:15:08] you look on the other side, the seed of
[1:15:10] Seth as it come down. Peasants, sheep,
[1:15:13] sheep herders, farmers, spiritual,
[1:15:16] humble,
[1:15:18] faithdriven. They had divine revelation.
[1:15:21] They kept to divine worship. the
[1:15:23] promise, prophecy, and revelation. They
[1:15:26] relied on faith, the blood, revelation,
[1:15:29] obedience to God's revealed will. And
[1:15:31] they were just humble, simple believers.
[1:15:36] Now, hang on to these thoughts as we
[1:15:37] navigate this. You can follow that all
[1:15:40] the way all the way to the seals. What
[1:15:42] is the seals revealing? This the seals
[1:15:44] is revealing these two things. The first
[1:15:45] seal reveals the Antichrist spirit, a
[1:15:48] faker, a fake believer. He's got a he's
[1:15:50] a just nothing but a bluff. He's got a
[1:15:52] bow and no errors down through the the
[1:15:54] the church ages, right? Started out in
[1:15:57] the first church age that on the day of
[1:15:58] Pentecost, they were filled with a real
[1:16:00] bold lion anointing. They come out. I
[1:16:03] know I know what God's word says. A and
[1:16:06] and they were they were willing to stand
[1:16:08] for the truth. But yet combating that,
[1:16:10] as soon as they got rolling, here comes
[1:16:12] here comes the devil, the faker, that
[1:16:14] antichrist spirit, a bow with no arrows,
[1:16:17] faking it with that nickelan doctrine to
[1:16:19] try to control, limit the way that the
[1:16:21] spirit can move in the church, limit
[1:16:23] people, to restrict the Holy Ghost from
[1:16:25] actually moving in people's lives. Now,
[1:16:27] you talk about that's why we've got to
[1:16:30] have the seals open because it gives you
[1:16:32] rapturing faith to see who you are and
[1:16:35] what you're doing. And he said, "Watch
[1:16:37] it. Watch back there how the spirit of
[1:16:38] God lived in Abel. Look how it lived in
[1:16:40] Seth. Look how it lived in Judah. Look
[1:16:42] how it lived in David. Look at the same
[1:16:45] spirit calling out through that
[1:16:46] righteous seed all the way down. Right
[1:16:48] on Abel's side. They wasn't builders nor
[1:16:51] educators or smart men. They were a more
[1:16:53] or less humble sort of sheep raisers and
[1:16:56] peasants that just walk by the spirit.
[1:16:58] Just little peasants that just walk by
[1:17:01] the spirit. Amen.
[1:17:03] See, you don't have to be nothing big or
[1:17:05] a big intellectual giant or go to
[1:17:07] college or anything to be a Christian.
[1:17:09] Just take God at his word. And you can
[1:17:12] understand the seals. You can understand
[1:17:13] the deep mysteries by just just hanging
[1:17:15] on to the word until God reveals it. You
[1:17:18] don't have to you don't have to have a
[1:17:20] big old great big brain like like all of
[1:17:22] these theologians and stuff to
[1:17:23] understand the the little mysteries of
[1:17:25] God.
[1:17:26] Cain's line represents that outward
[1:17:28] religion, self effort and formal worship
[1:17:31] without inner revelation. While Seth
[1:17:34] just just simple, humble, taking a hold
[1:17:37] of what God
[1:17:39] said. Sin didn't start in earth. Brother
[1:17:42] Brown will say it began in heaven and he
[1:17:43] was kicked out of heaven and came to the
[1:17:45] earth. There was nothing else he could
[1:17:46] get into. That's the That's the devil's
[1:17:48] plan the whole time is is to inject
[1:17:51] himself into the way that we think,
[1:17:53] inject himself into the human race to to
[1:17:56] muddy things up. And and that's what
[1:17:58] that mark of the beast is representing.
[1:18:00] How Satan got into the human race and de
[1:18:03] pulled people away from what God really
[1:18:05] wanted them their real God called
[1:18:07] purpose.
[1:18:10] The Bible said that Satan ser that that
[1:18:13] the serpent had a seed. Yeah, I know it
[1:18:15] seems like even today people are getting
[1:18:16] hung up back on that on that doctrine
[1:18:18] that so many of us just take for granted
[1:18:21] and and they're getting hung up on that
[1:18:23] again. But the Bible says that the
[1:18:26] serpent had a seed. Amen. In Genesis
[1:18:29] 3:15, I'll put enmity between thee and
[1:18:31] the woman and between thy seed and her
[1:18:34] seed. Two opposing lineages, one Christ
[1:18:38] seed and the other the serpent seed. One
[1:18:40] spiritual and one perverted. One just
[1:18:43] believing the believing by revelation
[1:18:46] and one the other religious carnal who
[1:18:50] and that conflict that same conflict has
[1:18:52] been playing out all down through human
[1:18:54] history. You know what the beast was? He
[1:18:56] was the mechanism by which Satan That's
[1:18:59] right. could inject himself into the
[1:19:02] human race.
[1:19:04] Think about maybe the devil was roaming
[1:19:06] around the garden trying to figure out
[1:19:07] how he could mess things up, but Adam
[1:19:09] and Eve were fortified behind the word.
[1:19:12] how he's going to how is he going to get
[1:19:13] in there? And then he found he found a
[1:19:15] little gateway. He found a little door.
[1:19:17] That's right. The the beast working in
[1:19:19] the garden, tilling up the soil. And
[1:19:21] here goes the devil. And begins to move
[1:19:23] himself into that arrangement so that he
[1:19:26] can now begin to preach to Eve. And he
[1:19:28] preaches his little he preaches his
[1:19:30] little sermons to Eve and begins to
[1:19:32] because that's how how it all starts. It
[1:19:34] starts in the mind first. He begins to
[1:19:36] preach into the womb of Eve's Eve's
[1:19:38] mind. And still still she starts
[1:19:39] thinking, well, you know, that's a
[1:19:41] that's a pretty good idea. I always
[1:19:43] wondered what my purpose was. God told
[1:19:46] us to multiply and replenish the earth.
[1:19:48] And here here comes the serpent, the
[1:19:50] beast, and he's telling me a way that I
[1:19:52] can accomplish that goal where if she
[1:19:54] would have just stayed fortified behind
[1:19:55] the word, and waited, she would have be
[1:19:58] to realize how that would be manifested.
[1:20:01] By the spoken word, not by some carnal
[1:20:04] act. Not by some carnal act that
[1:20:06] produced Cain. Because Cain was a
[1:20:08] product of carnality. Oh, but but you
[1:20:11] know when you get born again of God,
[1:20:12] when you get born again, it's not a
[1:20:14] product of anything carnal, it's not a
[1:20:16] product of anything intellectual, but
[1:20:18] it's by the spirit of God, by one spirit
[1:20:21] we're born into one body. The brother
[1:20:24] said that beast, that serpent was the
[1:20:26] most subtle of all the beasts of the
[1:20:28] field. Subtle means it's not immediately
[1:20:31] obvious.
[1:20:33] It's it's hard to tell. Here he comes
[1:20:36] and he starts preaching his little
[1:20:38] message. He's subtle. In other words,
[1:20:40] he's preaching something. That's that
[1:20:41] sounds right. He's using the same words.
[1:20:45] Yeah. That God did. He said, "Won't you
[1:20:49] be like God's?" Well, that sounds right.
[1:20:52] And even now at the end time, it sounds
[1:20:55] right, but you better be able to tell.
[1:20:57] You better be able to tell when you've
[1:20:58] got a president standing up and saying,
[1:21:00] "I'm a Christian, but I've never had to
[1:21:02] ask God to forgive me." you somebody
[1:21:04] coming up and say, "I'm a bless God. I'm
[1:21:06] a cre." You better be careful what you
[1:21:08] endorse, what you're standing behind.
[1:21:10] Because it matters what preacher you're
[1:21:13] endorsing. It matters what church you go
[1:21:15] to. It matters whether you understand
[1:21:18] what the image of the beast is and what
[1:21:19] that second beast is. It matters because
[1:21:22] you need to know the difference. Subtle
[1:21:24] means it ain't immediately obvious. It's
[1:21:27] elusive. It's sly and cunning. The beast
[1:21:30] was the most subtle, most shrewd,
[1:21:33] cunning, wisdom, smarter than the
[1:21:36] animal. He was right next to the man,
[1:21:39] right next to him. And because because
[1:21:42] Eve listened to that and then going down
[1:21:45] the line, because that Cain listened to
[1:21:47] the enemy, then all these things
[1:21:50] happened because why? Because Eve
[1:21:52] listened to that, then now we got our
[1:21:54] first murderer. Yes. Because Cain,
[1:21:57] listen to that. He become the first one
[1:21:59] that ever had jealousy on earth. The
[1:22:03] first one that ever had jealousy on the
[1:22:05] earth. Right? Cain by taking on this
[1:22:07] evil took the first mark. Right? God
[1:22:10] marked
[1:22:11] him. No one was to kill him. Just let
[1:22:15] him alone.
[1:22:18] Genesis 4:15 that we read, the Lord set
[1:22:20] a mark upon Cain lest any finding him
[1:22:22] should kill him. And Cain went out from
[1:22:25] the presence of the Lord. Now there's
[1:22:27] there's the mark. There is the
[1:22:29] characteristic of the mark as he went
[1:22:32] out. Amen. From the presence of the
[1:22:34] Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:38] You think about David sitting on that
[1:22:40] hillside praising God, playing his harp,
[1:22:42] worshiping. Here comes a lion and a
[1:22:44] bear. He's like, "Listen, I'm protecting
[1:22:47] my sheep. I'm going after him."
[1:22:49] But on the other side, you've got all
[1:22:51] the way down all all these carnally
[1:22:54] minded that rather than just taking God
[1:22:57] at his word, they they actually they by
[1:23:01] rejecting it, it moves them out from the
[1:23:03] presence of the Lord. It's a spiritual
[1:23:05] distinction that the mark is the mark.
[1:23:08] It's a mark of being outcast for
[1:23:10] refusing God's provided way unlike the
[1:23:13] sealing of the Holy Spirit which
[1:23:15] signifies God's ownership and
[1:23:18] acceptance. As soon as he marked him, he
[1:23:20] went out from the presence of God. You
[1:23:23] got those two lines all the way down.
[1:23:24] Life, what is it? Life and death. Life
[1:23:27] that the church is signed by today. The
[1:23:29] sign of the Holy Spirit that Christ is
[1:23:32] not dead, but he raised from the dead
[1:23:34] and taken in the church. see sealing his
[1:23:37] church there. It begins right them two
[1:23:40] boys right there in the garden of Eden
[1:23:43] right outside the garden and death. The
[1:23:47] mark of the beast a
[1:23:50] wanderer. A fugitive. Don't know where
[1:23:53] he's going. Don't know where where what
[1:23:57] he knows. Don't know what he does want.
[1:23:59] He's a fugitive. Amen. You think now
[1:24:02] that outside of this message, you're not
[1:24:05] going to find your real purpose because
[1:24:08] your purpose is to be you're
[1:24:10] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:24:12] image of the son of God. That's what
[1:24:14] your real purpose is. And outside of
[1:24:17] this revealed word of the day, you're
[1:24:18] never going to you don't know what
[1:24:20] you're here for.
[1:24:21] you all all you can do is is is is uh
[1:24:24] like the world has done just take meth
[1:24:27] and take cocaine, drink drugs, drink
[1:24:30] alcohol, try to find something to fill
[1:24:32] that void to smoke cigarettes, uh seek
[1:24:35] after women, all of that because what
[1:24:37] what they become is just wandering
[1:24:39] stars. There's nothing to fill that void
[1:24:41] ever learning. They're going to school.
[1:24:42] They're learning maybe even learning
[1:24:44] about God, but they're like like Paul
[1:24:46] and Peter and them s waves of the sea
[1:24:49] foaming out their shame. Not not any
[1:24:51] kind a wave of the sea just lands on the
[1:24:53] seashore foams does a little bit of
[1:24:56] foaming and then it just pulls back away
[1:24:58] from the coastline and where's it go? It
[1:25:00] has no purpose. What's where's it going?
[1:25:03] But that that's the mark of the beast.
[1:25:05] The fugitive wandering that had has no
[1:25:07] idea what its purpose is. But Seth Seth
[1:25:11] stayed stayed at home
[1:25:14] and he was with his father
[1:25:17] and God gave him a wife. Right. Amen.
[1:25:20] Brother Brandham said,
[1:25:23] you know, those scriptures where it says
[1:25:25] just aspire to have a quiet life. Yeah.
[1:25:28] Just to know, just to know what you're
[1:25:29] doing here, what your purpose is. We
[1:25:32] don't have to be running all over the
[1:25:33] place trying to prove everybody on
[1:25:34] Facebook that how how good of a
[1:25:36] Christian we are. Just just be settled
[1:25:40] and you're and you're quiet. Have that
[1:25:41] quiet time with God early in the morning
[1:25:44] where where he knows you and you know
[1:25:46] him.
[1:25:48] That's what matters. A mark is a
[1:25:51] distinction. It makes a difference. It
[1:25:53] separates something. But like you say,
[1:25:55] you got one mark against you, a mark.
[1:25:56] But you never said you had one seal
[1:25:58] against you. You got a mark against you.
[1:26:00] Come on, brother. The mark of the beast
[1:26:02] is the wayward, the outcast that refused
[1:26:05] to take and come God's provided way. As
[1:26:09] soon as he was marked, he was sent away.
[1:26:12] These two mark Mark and seal begin in
[1:26:14] Genesis and it comes down through the
[1:26:16] Bible and ends up in Revelation. Can can
[1:26:18] y'all see that this morning that it
[1:26:20] starts in Genesis? We read in Genesis
[1:26:22] and it winds all the way up in
[1:26:24] Revelation 13 and winds all the way up
[1:26:26] in Revelation 14 and just how it came in
[1:26:29] real subtly in Genesis. It come in real
[1:26:32] subtly in Revelation right here at the
[1:26:34] end. It come in real deceptive early on
[1:26:37] and right here at the end comes in real
[1:26:39] sneaky like a lamb. Like a lamb. I'm a
[1:26:43] Christian. I'm saying the same. I
[1:26:45] believe same as you do. Okay, I guess
[1:26:48] you do. Nuh-uh. You better know what
[1:26:50] side you're You better know. You better
[1:26:53] know. Look that brother say they were
[1:26:56] both in the ark. The the dove and the
[1:26:57] crow like the hypocrite and the real
[1:26:59] believer in the same church, same pew
[1:27:01] sitting together. But you know there
[1:27:03] there is not two forms of eternal life.
[1:27:06] There's not a dove and a halfway dove.
[1:27:08] Half half half dove half crow. There
[1:27:11] it's either a dove or crow. There's
[1:27:13] nothing in between. It's either that's
[1:27:15] why everybody on earth is going to take
[1:27:18] one. It's going to be gripped by one or
[1:27:21] the other. Either this one or that one.
[1:27:24] No in between. It can't be me under a
[1:27:27] sin offering all the time and then be a
[1:27:29] sinner. You cannot. You never seen a
[1:27:31] sinner saint. You never seen a black
[1:27:33] white bird, a drunk soberman. No sir,
[1:27:35] you are either a sinner or a saint.
[1:27:39] That's all. Now, what's my take away
[1:27:42] from this? If I'm going to be a saint, I
[1:27:44] I want to be so full far on that side
[1:27:48] that it don't look at all like there's
[1:27:50] any on the other side. I don't want
[1:27:52] anybody thinking I don't want God
[1:27:54] looking at me and thinking, "Well, he he
[1:27:56] says he's a saint, but he's got some
[1:27:58] crow feathers in. I want to be so far. I
[1:28:01] don't want there to be any confusion. In
[1:28:03] other words, so it behooves us to check
[1:28:06] up ourselves. He said, "Notice the crow,
[1:28:08] the dove." Let's notice from Cain and
[1:28:10] Abel that was nothing in the world but
[1:28:13] Judas and Jesus.
[1:28:15] How do you tell the difference by the
[1:28:17] characteristics? Amen. That crow could
[1:28:20] eat dead things, but not the dove.
[1:28:24] That that crow had gall. It could digest
[1:28:26] both clean and unclean food. They could
[1:28:28] go out and eat a old dead horse bloating
[1:28:30] in the road or something, but not a
[1:28:32] dove. See, that's how you tell, right?
[1:28:35] That that crow could consume filth, dead
[1:28:38] bodies, clean food, whatever. And that
[1:28:41] crow represents a hypocrite.
[1:28:44] At church, it's real clean and
[1:28:45] everything, but then when it goes home,
[1:28:47] it's got to watch them old dirty movies
[1:28:49] and stuff. He's got to read them old
[1:28:50] magazines. But a crow, because a crow
[1:28:52] can do that. It can switch back and
[1:28:54] forth. It it don't just stay in the
[1:28:57] clean like a dove. It goes home and it's
[1:28:59] all it's all going. I'm going to go
[1:29:01] right back to the filthy like a old dead
[1:29:03] horse in the road. Right back. But not a
[1:29:05] dove.
[1:29:08] Hallelujah. A crow can fellowship with
[1:29:10] the world and the church.
[1:29:14] A crow's comfortable
[1:29:17] around death. Yep. And spiritual
[1:29:20] deadness. Deadness. Right. But but not a
[1:29:22] dove. Amen. A dove can't find rest or
[1:29:26] peace among death, unclean things. It's
[1:29:29] got to return back like that little dove
[1:29:32] back to the ark for fellowship. Amen.
[1:29:35] And that's why brother Ram said outside
[1:29:37] of heaven, Christianity is the the
[1:29:39] gospel is the a Christian is the
[1:29:42] holiest, cleanest thing. This is a
[1:29:45] clean, holy gospel that we're preaching.
[1:29:49] And so, brother want to say, let's watch
[1:29:51] the smoke. Now, y'all hang on now. I'm I
[1:29:54] I'm sorry, y'all, but I have no
[1:29:55] intention of stopping until I'm done
[1:29:57] this morning.
[1:29:59] We're going until we finish
[1:30:01] this. I've studied and I've labored hard
[1:30:04] and you are going to reap the benefits
[1:30:05] one way or the
[1:30:09] other. Brother said, "Let's let's watch
[1:30:12] the smoke." Now, I love these statements
[1:30:14] that he let's watch the smoke. In other
[1:30:16] words, you know, like if you're a cowboy
[1:30:19] in the woods back in the days when you
[1:30:21] you had to watch out for the Indians,
[1:30:23] uh, uh, the Native Americans. I'm not
[1:30:26] going to be politically correct, but
[1:30:28] that you and you see smoke, you know
[1:30:31] somebody was camping over there. Yes,
[1:30:32] sir. So, you know something's going on.
[1:30:35] And and in other words, when he says,
[1:30:37] "Let's watch the smoke," he's saying,
[1:30:38] "Let's pay attention to the signs or the
[1:30:40] evidence of what is happening
[1:30:42] spiritually." Be attentive to what is
[1:30:44] occurring. It's it's it's revelation.
[1:30:47] The smoke is is is looking at revelation
[1:30:50] versus religion. Cain coming up. He
[1:30:53] offered an offering. He built an altar.
[1:30:56] He belonged to a church. He knelt at the
[1:30:58] altar. He prayed. He worshiped God. God,
[1:31:01] he gave in his tithing. Look at all
[1:31:03] these things, brother. I'm saying he
[1:31:04] done all those things. But the
[1:31:06] difference is the revelation. See, the
[1:31:09] revelation is how you can tell the
[1:31:10] difference. The revelation is the thing.
[1:31:13] Right. When Jesus told Peter, "Flesh and
[1:31:16] blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
[1:31:18] but my father which is in heaven." When
[1:31:20] the spiritual revelation of Jesus
[1:31:22] Christ, brother say, "He is the word. In
[1:31:25] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:31:27] was God." Amen. And the word was made
[1:31:28] flesh and dwelt among us. And when that
[1:31:31] word comes into you, it's sharper than a
[1:31:34] two-edged sword. Amen. Even discerning
[1:31:38] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:31:40] heart. Amen.
[1:31:41] discerning and discerning be means being
[1:31:44] able to tell the difference. There's the
[1:31:47] word coming in.
[1:31:49] Cain said, "I guess my mother eats some
[1:31:51] apples and she had to put on clothes."
[1:31:55] But Abel knew it was blood life cuz in
[1:31:58] the blood is the life and the life
[1:32:00] produces the character or the nature.
[1:32:02] The life produces the character. You
[1:32:04] think about Abel. Now, now let's enter
[1:32:06] into the story. Abel looking over there
[1:32:08] at Cain. Something seems different. I
[1:32:12] know we're supposed to be from the same
[1:32:14] daddy, but something's different.
[1:32:18] And and Abel began to ponder like just
[1:32:20] to dramatize. And God began to woo over
[1:32:23] him and and woo over those thoughts that
[1:32:25] he was having and and and reveal to him
[1:32:28] that it's life. And then you start
[1:32:30] working it out, thinking life. Okay, I
[1:32:34] need to offer I need to offer blood
[1:32:36] because the life is in the blood. While
[1:32:39] Cain is over there with just an
[1:32:40] intellectual understanding, I guess my
[1:32:42] mommy eats some apples. Satan's altar
[1:32:44] was always more beautiful than Abel's.
[1:32:46] Cain come up with with his nice real
[1:32:48] offer. We we know it's got to be fruit.
[1:32:51] So, here comes Cain offering some fruit
[1:32:53] from the field. He's got all these
[1:32:54] little his little cornucopia like we do
[1:32:56] at Thanksgiving. all this the nice
[1:32:58] pumpkins and everything maybe uh that
[1:33:00] he's offering from the field but Abel
[1:33:03] knew it's got to be life and he comes
[1:33:07] over there with his little didn't have a
[1:33:09] nice night sharp knife but he takes it a
[1:33:11] little sharp stone out and goes to
[1:33:13] hacking you know any real religious
[1:33:15] person would look at that and think well
[1:33:17] that that why would I have to come to
[1:33:19] God like that just like a real religious
[1:33:22] intellectual person seeing somebody
[1:33:24] snotting at an altar or rolling around
[1:33:27] crying out to God or or maybe praising
[1:33:30] their hands and worshiping God would
[1:33:32] look over at that and say, "Well, why
[1:33:33] does anybody got to do that? I don't
[1:33:35] want to come to God like that. I don't
[1:33:36] want to come and and and and die. I
[1:33:38] don't want to actually die." You know,
[1:33:39] brother said that Abel had to die with
[1:33:42] his sacrifice. that any real Christian
[1:33:44] that ever comes to God that you can't
[1:33:46] just come with your sacrifice alone, but
[1:33:47] you got to get up there on that altar
[1:33:49] and die yourself to identify yourself
[1:33:52] with his sacrifice to lay yourself your
[1:33:54] life on that altar and die. And that's
[1:33:57] what makes the difference. That's what
[1:33:59] makes the difference between a religious
[1:34:01] person that just comes to church and
[1:34:03] pays their tithe and they're doing all
[1:34:04] the dead works and they can't tell the
[1:34:06] difference between a real true gospel
[1:34:08] preaching and something that's fake and
[1:34:10] somebody that's been alone with God and
[1:34:11] they know what he they know who he is
[1:34:13] and they know where they come from. In
[1:34:15] other words, we say it like this. They
[1:34:17] know who their daddy is. When you know
[1:34:19] who your daddy is and you've looked into
[1:34:20] the word and you've taken God's DNA test
[1:34:23] and you can trace your lineage back,
[1:34:25] then that's where what gives you
[1:34:26] identity. I was talking, we were over at
[1:34:29] brother Jason Watkins and I was talking
[1:34:30] to him about that lady over there in
[1:34:32] India that that that where the the oil
[1:34:35] and the meal that had actually been
[1:34:37] replenished in her house. And you talk
[1:34:39] about I'm going to deviate from my notes
[1:34:40] just for a minute. You talk about
[1:34:42] somebody that can identify themselves
[1:34:43] with the word. She was there a little a
[1:34:46] little pulper had nothing and she she
[1:34:49] had nothing in her house. know, she was
[1:34:51] running out of food and God came on the
[1:34:53] scene and began to replenish the oil and
[1:34:55] the meal until every day she had enough
[1:34:58] to eat from. And she didn't even know
[1:35:00] that story about the little widow woman
[1:35:02] in the Bible that that that had been
[1:35:03] replenished until she was in church
[1:35:05] listening to the gospel being preached.
[1:35:08] And she went up after the after the
[1:35:09] service and told that brother that story
[1:35:11] that you were just telling about that
[1:35:12] little woman in the Bible that the meal
[1:35:14] and the oil was replenished. I am that
[1:35:17] woman. And the preacher said, "Well,
[1:35:18] well, sure, sure. I mean, that's great
[1:35:20] that you identify yourself with the She
[1:35:22] was like, "No, I really am." And she
[1:35:25] began to invite people over to their
[1:35:26] house. And they sat and saw the meal
[1:35:29] rise in that container after they ate
[1:35:31] from it until the seal from that
[1:35:33] container was pressed in the meal
[1:35:36] because it was so full. Oh, she was
[1:35:39] identified with what she was preaching.
[1:35:42] Now, see, that's how you know whether
[1:35:44] you are real and genuine is when the
[1:35:46] word of God is being preached and you
[1:35:48] identify yourself with it because you've
[1:35:51] experienced it and you've been there and
[1:35:53] you know what the preacher's preaching
[1:35:55] about. There's the difference. Oh, Abel
[1:35:59] sacrificed all of his rights. Can you
[1:36:02] identify yourself with that? But oh,
[1:36:04] that religious person like Cain, I ain't
[1:36:06] sacrificing none of my rights. If you're
[1:36:09] a lamb, you've got a right to it, but
[1:36:11] you forfeit your rights to Christ. And
[1:36:13] brother, I'm going say, I got a right to
[1:36:15] get drunk tonight. I'm American citizen.
[1:36:17] I got a right to smoke, but we forfeit
[1:36:20] our rights.
[1:36:22] I act like gentlemen, like ladies, dress
[1:36:24] it and act like it and live it. Forfeit
[1:36:26] your rights.
[1:36:28] And the devil's trick was has always
[1:36:30] been that there there was no difference.
[1:36:32] to cloud the difference to come in like
[1:36:36] suddenly where you can't see the
[1:36:38] difference like the children of Israel
[1:36:40] about to come into the promised land
[1:36:42] just like just like maybe many of us
[1:36:43] here today about to step over into the
[1:36:46] promises of a capstone revelation and
[1:36:48] here comes the devil coming it right
[1:36:51] like like they did with Moab coming in
[1:36:54] here Israel on its road to the promised
[1:36:56] land right and it met Moab with his Moab
[1:37:01] had they worshiped God probably over
[1:37:04] there praising God. Seven altars, seven
[1:37:07] bulocks, seven rams on each altar. Amen.
[1:37:09] Had a prophet. But what was different? I
[1:37:13] I was thinking about this when I was
[1:37:14] coming through the door to the pulpit.
[1:37:17] It sounds like there was a shout of the
[1:37:19] king in the camp. When I was coming
[1:37:20] through, everybody praising God. Now,
[1:37:23] there's a difference is down in Israel,
[1:37:26] there was a pillar of fire that was
[1:37:27] leading them. down in Israel there was
[1:37:29] that you know they had many problems
[1:37:32] many mistakes that you know you could do
[1:37:34] like s see s they're like balam and bail
[1:37:36] looking at the backside of Israel and
[1:37:37] see all the mistakes but yet they had
[1:37:40] the real life the real the true
[1:37:43] bloodstream down there in the camp they
[1:37:46] had the real word of God and the pillar
[1:37:47] of fire and they had a prophet down
[1:37:50] there that was preaching a real true
[1:37:51] vindicated message they had what what
[1:37:54] what what separated them had the real
[1:37:56] true supernatural natural
[1:37:59] characteristics of God.
[1:38:02] We say Israel and Moab were not the
[1:38:04] same. There's a difference between
[1:38:06] religion and revelation. Amen. You know
[1:38:10] what just religion is? It's like uh
[1:38:11] brother Ram told that story. He said
[1:38:13] there was a we were we were having a
[1:38:15] baptismal and and he said I was going
[1:38:18] sometime with a a woman to the river, a
[1:38:20] group of them, and a woman walked out
[1:38:22] there. They're they're doing what the
[1:38:24] Bible says, going to a baptism. Yeah.
[1:38:27] And she got out of her car and come
[1:38:28] across fixing her hair up. Let me get
[1:38:31] ready. Fixing her hair up. She wants to
[1:38:33] be pretty for the baptism. And she said,
[1:38:35] "Go on and take me down and dunk me,
[1:38:37] Brother Random." Now that's that's
[1:38:39] religion. Nothing from the heart. Just
[1:38:42] just just got something weird to say.
[1:38:46] Not not not going down because you won't
[1:38:49] because God's drawing you, but because
[1:38:50] there just maybe just something on paper
[1:38:52] somebody said for you, you need to go
[1:38:54] down and be baptized. But he said,
[1:38:56] "You're not you. You ain't fit to go
[1:38:58] in." That's right. They was going to
[1:39:00] have a singing at the church and some
[1:39:02] girl, she didn't even have enough money
[1:39:03] to get her some kind of a hairdo like
[1:39:05] that. She wanted to get up on the
[1:39:06] platform to sing. And he said, "When I
[1:39:09] found out, I wouldn't let her sing."
[1:39:10] Why? Cuz it ain't about religion. We
[1:39:12] won't Oh, this is a cleaned up Holy
[1:39:15] Ghost fililled gospel. And he said, "We
[1:39:17] need the oldfashioned scouring pad again
[1:39:19] in the church to where we're living
[1:39:21] right and walking right and doing right.
[1:39:24] Oh, we ain't got no place for religion.
[1:39:26] It's a heartfelt religion where you're
[1:39:28] going down in the water because God is
[1:39:30] pulling you and you coming to the altar
[1:39:32] because God's drawing you, not because
[1:39:34] your mama, your daddy, or somebody told
[1:39:36] you that's what you need to do, but but
[1:39:37] God God is pulling at you.
[1:39:41] He said, "What we need to do is like the
[1:39:43] elders, they were they were ordained in
[1:39:44] a minister in one time and in this in
[1:39:46] this old country church and they they
[1:39:48] wrapped the burlap around the he said,
[1:39:50] well, they were actually praying that
[1:39:51] way. They didn't actually do it." He
[1:39:53] said, he said, "Lord, wrap him up in
[1:39:54] burlap sacks and pour kerosene on him
[1:39:57] and set him on fire for the gospel." And
[1:39:59] he said, "That's what we need. We need
[1:40:01] to be lit on fire for the gospel until
[1:40:03] the whole world can see what we stand
[1:40:05] for." Amen.
[1:40:07] There's the question, are we a
[1:40:09] Christian?
[1:40:11] I'm about to close in a minute. Are you
[1:40:14] a Christian? He I asked a girl some time
[1:40:16] ago. Now, this ties in to that image of
[1:40:18] the beast and that second beast there in
[1:40:20] Revelation. He said, "I asked a girl
[1:40:21] some time ago, are you a Christian?" And
[1:40:24] he was over there in Sweden. He happened
[1:40:25] to run into somebody in Sweden that was
[1:40:27] from America. He said, "Are are you a
[1:40:30] Christian?" And she said, "I give you to
[1:40:32] understand I'm an American." Like that
[1:40:35] had anything to do with it.
[1:40:38] That Christian nationalism. Well, bless
[1:40:40] God, I voted for Trump. That means I'm a
[1:40:43] Christian. It doesn't mean you're a
[1:40:44] Christian. Oh, bless God. I went to
[1:40:47] Dollywood and they had a American flag
[1:40:49] on the stage behind and that means I'm a
[1:40:51] Christian. That that doesn't mean you're
[1:40:53] a Christian. It listen we that's what we
[1:40:56] got to be able to understand cuz the
[1:40:58] devil will come in with flatteries and
[1:41:00] he'll come in with subtleties and it
[1:41:02] doesn't mean you're a Christian just
[1:41:03] even because you associate with other
[1:41:05] Christians. He he said like that had
[1:41:07] anything to do with it. Christianity is
[1:41:10] the most cleanest, holiest thing there
[1:41:13] is this side of heaven. And we call
[1:41:15] oursel a Christian nation. We're no more
[1:41:17] Christian nation than any of the rest of
[1:41:19] them are. Amen.
[1:41:22] That'll poke it. That'll poke at some
[1:41:24] people. He said, "I'm glad that I'm an
[1:41:27] American and thankful for it, but I tell
[1:41:30] you, it certainly needs a counter
[1:41:31] revival. It sure does." Listen closely
[1:41:33] now. America needs a counter revival and
[1:41:37] it will not get it. That's right. Amen.
[1:41:42] America, yeah, put this out on the
[1:41:46] internet, America will never be great
[1:41:49] again. As much as what you want to join
[1:41:52] your your societies and things, it will
[1:41:55] not get it.
[1:41:58] It will not get it. There is no more
[1:42:01] revival outside of this word, a personal
[1:42:05] revival.
[1:42:06] America is not going to get a revival.
[1:42:10] It will not get it. No sir, she'll
[1:42:14] never
[1:42:15] rise
[1:42:17] again. But what what my take away from
[1:42:20] that is you better get out. And the only
[1:42:23] way out is up.
[1:42:25] You better get out because it will never
[1:42:28] rise again.
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:32] Now, now listen, while we while we sit
[1:42:34] on this quote, I I want just examine
[1:42:36] ourselves. Why does this offend us so
[1:42:39] much? Why do we get so stirred when we
[1:42:41] read things like this? Is it because
[1:42:44] we're so wrapped up in the identity of
[1:42:47] of of America or something that we get
[1:42:49] offended by that? Where where are we
[1:42:51] getting our identity from? My brother
[1:42:54] Brandon said, I I'm not taking an
[1:42:56] American spirit. I I don't I don't want
[1:42:58] an American spirit. American spirit is
[1:43:01] that frivolity, that laughing through
[1:43:03] the graveyard, laughing at stuff. I I
[1:43:06] don't want an American spirit. I want a
[1:43:07] Christian spirit. I want to be a
[1:43:09] Christian. And I'm an American and I
[1:43:11] live here and I thank God for all the
[1:43:13] rights and all the Memorial Day and all
[1:43:15] those things. But yet, America, America,
[1:43:18] the American
[1:43:20] spirit, the America will never rise
[1:43:23] again. No, I I know I know this pricks
[1:43:25] us a little bit, but he said, "You
[1:43:27] remember how 5 years ago in Chicago
[1:43:29] that's on tape, you got it, Gene?" He
[1:43:31] said, "They'll either accept it this
[1:43:32] year or they'll constantly drop down.
[1:43:36] They will
[1:43:38] constantly drop down."
[1:43:41] And he said, "And they've done it." See,
[1:43:44] and they will do it till she'll finally
[1:43:47] meet her in. Right. Right. Now, if you
[1:43:50] study the message and you understand the
[1:43:52] prophet's message, the next things in
[1:43:55] line for America are a woman's spirit to
[1:43:58] take over. Whether that's a leadership,
[1:44:00] clear leadership by a Roman, the Roman
[1:44:02] system, or a woman becoming president or
[1:44:05] some figurehead like that, but
[1:44:07] nevertheless, a woman's spirit over the
[1:44:10] nation. And then following that, utter
[1:44:14] destruction. Now, that's bearing out
[1:44:17] what he said. She will never rise again.
[1:44:20] Now, see, we find those spirits. He
[1:44:22] said, "Watch, just about the time that
[1:44:24] Jesus came on the scene, Jesus. Judas
[1:44:26] came on the scene." Just about the time
[1:44:29] the Holy Ghost came on the scene, what
[1:44:30] happened? The Antichrist came on the
[1:44:32] scene. Yes. John says, "So, little
[1:44:34] children, be not deceived by it." The
[1:44:37] Antichrist is already at work in the
[1:44:40] world. And he said, "See, it ain't
[1:44:42] coming in these last days. It's already
[1:44:46] there then. It's always been. Amen. Just
[1:44:50] watch just about the time the antichrist
[1:44:53] is holding itself up now and taking all
[1:44:56] the
[1:44:56] churches, even our Pentecostal
[1:44:59] into the big morg up here. Right, the
[1:45:02] confederation of churches. Amen. Which
[1:45:04] will form the image of the beast.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. Now, now I say this in a
[1:45:08] warning way. You know how God always
[1:45:11] does things in an unexpected way.
[1:45:13] Absolutely. We're just going along.
[1:45:15] You're going to to your little watching
[1:45:17] your little shows and and reading your
[1:45:19] little stories and things and all of a
[1:45:21] sudden, wait a
[1:45:22] second. Did that's actually Wait, wait a
[1:45:26] second. We got an American pope. Didn't
[1:45:29] Did wasn't that prophesied years ago and
[1:45:32] then people get to scrambling to go
[1:45:34] getting things lined up and that's
[1:45:36] exactly how this image of the beast is
[1:45:38] going to work out? It's it's going to
[1:45:40] catch people off guard. and and and
[1:45:43] look, brother said, "How far away from
[1:45:45] the spirit of God can you get when you
[1:45:47] start wondering,
[1:45:49] oh, how we see now the antichrist
[1:45:52] beginning to unfold itself, taking a
[1:45:54] hold in the nation, that antichrist
[1:45:57] spirit moving, forming up the world
[1:45:59] council of churches, forming out
[1:46:01] everything until the till the spiritual
[1:46:04] world and the governmental world are
[1:46:07] united. Now the that second beast can
[1:46:10] just do whatever it wants to. If you
[1:46:12] don't agree, then all of a sudden you're
[1:46:14] boycotted and you can't you can't buy or
[1:46:16] sell. You can't you can't uh however
[1:46:20] that unfolds, we'll see because God
[1:46:22] interprets his own word. But
[1:46:25] but you know, back when brother was
[1:46:27] preaching this, they had just elected
[1:46:30] John F. Kennedy.
[1:46:33] And just a few years before that, the
[1:46:36] Catholic Church had voted in Pope John
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:39] 23rd. And brother Ram made this
[1:46:41] statement. He said, "Even elect their
[1:46:43] own man, the other churches forming in
[1:46:44] with it, making one great big
[1:46:46] ecclesiastical
[1:46:47] head." You know, you can see even back
[1:46:49] then the we had the the first Catholic
[1:46:53] president over the United States. That's
[1:46:55] right. And and for us that that are more
[1:46:57] young and don't realize it before the
[1:47:00] first Catholic was president over the
[1:47:02] United States, it was really weird in
[1:47:05] the US for a Catholic to be president. I
[1:47:09] mean you they they had polls mo most of
[1:47:11] the people they would like they they
[1:47:12] would say on the polls, I will never
[1:47:15] vote for a Catholic ever. I don't care
[1:47:18] whether he's a Democrat or Republican. I
[1:47:20] don't ever vote I will never vote for a
[1:47:22] Catholic. Then out of the blue they
[1:47:24] voted for a Catholic and here he is a a
[1:47:27] Camelot looking real nice you know had
[1:47:30] swayed all the women in the country on
[1:47:32] his side because you know his wife had
[1:47:34] all the nice parasols and everything and
[1:47:36] look look it made it look real nice and
[1:47:39] see that's how the devil will come in
[1:47:41] here you've got a a Catholic president
[1:47:43] calls it looks nice and Pope John on the
[1:47:46] other hand Pope John didn't he he didn't
[1:47:49] like swoop in with the world council of
[1:47:51] churches but he cracked open the door
[1:47:54] for unity with other churches. He
[1:47:56] started to open up with his second
[1:47:57] Vatican council. If you go back and
[1:47:59] study those things out, he he cracked
[1:48:01] open the door to where we want unity
[1:48:03] with the rest of the world where before
[1:48:05] Pope John the 23rd, all the other uh all
[1:48:09] the other popes were like the Catholic
[1:48:11] Church has got it. We don't want to have
[1:48:12] any fellowship with anybody else. But
[1:48:14] here he comes cracking open the door to
[1:48:17] what's he doing? Cracking open the door
[1:48:18] for this movement to begin moving. Way
[1:48:21] back then in 1961.
[1:48:24] That's right, brother. Amen. And now
[1:48:27] Catholics are fully mainstream.
[1:48:29] Before before JFK, they they were
[1:48:32] treated like culturally, religiously,
[1:48:34] other just like put in a different
[1:48:35] category. They were they were subject to
[1:48:38] job discrimination, housing
[1:48:40] discrimination, anti-atholic propaganda.
[1:48:43] But now, not now. No way. Look look at
[1:48:45] it now. Years later, Catholics are fully
[1:48:48] mainstream. They have taken over. Even
[1:48:51] at my workplace, everybody I work with
[1:48:53] is Catholic. Everybody, everybody in
[1:48:55] Congress, everybody. Joe Biden was a
[1:48:58] Catholic. It's now we've got now, now
[1:49:01] you have a Catholic president and it
[1:49:03] does not face any real suspicion.
[1:49:06] It's not where they used to be concerned
[1:49:08] about JFK taking orders from the
[1:49:10] Vatican. That's right. You don't have
[1:49:12] that any kind of suspicion anymore.
[1:49:15] Right. Because things have changed.
[1:49:22] I'm I'm I'm skipping ahead so I can
[1:49:24] close. I'm I'm sorry. I'm breaking my
[1:49:27] promise.
[1:49:30] I'm I'm going to close with this story.
[1:49:34] The the real you can follow that that
[1:49:36] strain all the way down through
[1:49:38] scripture of the real religious, the
[1:49:39] carnal. Oh yeah. And the real the real
[1:49:42] true genuine believer is sealed by God.
[1:49:44] Amen. And brother Brandham, he finished
[1:49:46] this story when he was preaching the
[1:49:47] mark of the beast and the seal of God
[1:49:49] with this little story that illustrates
[1:49:52] what it is to be really sealed by
[1:49:54] God when his plane he he was flying into
[1:49:57] Memphis and his plane went down and and
[1:50:01] they put the airline put him up in that
[1:50:03] Peabody hotel, that fancy Peabody hotel,
[1:50:05] you know, where even today you can go
[1:50:07] and they got the ducks. That's their
[1:50:08] their call sign. They got the little
[1:50:09] ducks that'll come out and walk to the
[1:50:11] fountain and swim around. And brother
[1:50:12] Ron said, "I couldn't afford that place,
[1:50:14] but the airline put me up in there." And
[1:50:18] you know, all things work according to
[1:50:20] his will. Seems like, you know, you you
[1:50:24] get all we get all worried because
[1:50:25] things don't happen right or whatever.
[1:50:27] And look look at Brother Brandham, the
[1:50:29] plane's down. They It's broke. They got
[1:50:31] to fix it. They put him up in this hotel
[1:50:33] and he's maybe wondering what's going
[1:50:35] on. And and God eventually, you know,
[1:50:38] they they they uh he he leads him down.
[1:50:41] He he said he got to walk in that
[1:50:43] morning and walked down to and I I
[1:50:45] pulled it up on Google Maps. I was
[1:50:46] looking how far he walked. I know
[1:50:49] brother Andre He had actually traced it
[1:50:51] out and it's miles. He walked and
[1:50:53] walked. He walked down to South Memphis.
[1:50:55] He walked over the little there's a
[1:50:57] little creek that runs at the bottom of
[1:50:58] Memphis. He walked and walked and walked
[1:51:00] and God kept telling him. Now you think
[1:51:02] now in your in my mind if I if I knew my
[1:51:04] plane was I was going to miss my plane.
[1:51:06] I I' I'd be kind of nervous. But he's
[1:51:08] just he's just following the leading of
[1:51:10] the Lord through Memphis, through me all
[1:51:12] way until he got way on the other side
[1:51:14] of Memphis, leading and leading. And now
[1:51:17] on the other hand, on the other side,
[1:51:19] there's this little this little woman
[1:51:21] that that she really had an experience
[1:51:23] with God. And it wasn't put on. It it
[1:51:27] wasn't it wasn't something that she
[1:51:28] could maybe post about things on
[1:51:30] Facebook and everything and get
[1:51:31] everybody to see what a great Christian
[1:51:32] she was. But there on the side of her
[1:51:34] bed all night, she was praying to God
[1:51:37] for her little boy who had got an STD.
[1:51:40] And and she said she she had prayed to
[1:51:42] God for this little boy and and tried to
[1:51:44] raise him up the best she could. And and
[1:51:45] and she prayed until brother Random said
[1:51:48] 2:00 in the morning. She fell asleep on
[1:51:51] her knees praying. On her knees praying.
[1:51:56] Now, now that's now come on now. That's
[1:51:58] how you get something from God. That's
[1:51:59] right. Is be perseverant. Get a little
[1:52:02] bit desperate and don't give up. Don't
[1:52:06] that don't don't and don't pawn off your
[1:52:08] responsibility on somebody else. If God
[1:52:11] gave those kids to you, you could do
[1:52:12] just like that little woman and get
[1:52:14] desperate and pray through until God
[1:52:16] does something. And she fell asleep on
[1:52:18] her knees and she saw God gave her a
[1:52:20] dream of a man walking but down the
[1:52:23] street in a tan suit with a tan hat on.
[1:52:28] Right.
[1:52:30] God working on both ends. So that when
[1:52:33] now here she's entering into the story,
[1:52:36] she knew when that man come look, she
[1:52:39] had so much confidence in what God had
[1:52:41] showed her. There's a revelation that
[1:52:43] she went out and stood until the dew
[1:52:45] fell on her shoulders by that fence. And
[1:52:48] she stood by that fence waiting for her
[1:52:50] answer to come by. Right. Yeah. And when
[1:52:53] brother Brandham come walking by, he was
[1:52:55] singing a old Pentecostal tune and
[1:52:57] whistling or whatever, you know, singing
[1:52:58] a song and not worrying at all about
[1:53:01] that plane. And he come walking by and
[1:53:03] she was standing there and and and she
[1:53:06] said, "How do you do,
[1:53:07] Parson?" And I said, "How'd you know I
[1:53:10] was a parson?"
[1:53:12] She said, "Did you ever read that story
[1:53:13] about the Shinomite woman?" Now look,
[1:53:15] she's identifying herself with the
[1:53:17] scripture. I that's what every every
[1:53:19] born again child of God can do is
[1:53:22] identify yourself with the scripture. I
[1:53:24] said, "Oh yeah." She said, "I was that
[1:53:26] kind of woman." And they went in the
[1:53:28] house and he said, he said, "I I've been
[1:53:30] in king's palaces. I've been in nice
[1:53:33] places all over the world. A nice places
[1:53:35] where it looks like that is where God
[1:53:38] would go to visit." But there in that
[1:53:39] little humble home, she had that little
[1:53:41] sign over the door that said, "God bless
[1:53:43] our home." And he said, "I felt more
[1:53:46] welcome in that little that little
[1:53:48] shanty on the side of the side of a
[1:53:51] nowhere road in the middle of Memphis
[1:53:54] than than I was in King's Palaces." And
[1:53:57] he said, he said, "Auntie, would you
[1:53:59] lead us in prayer?" And he said, "She
[1:54:01] prayed a prayer. She prayed a prayer
[1:54:04] that rang my heart." Amen.
[1:54:08] He knew that she had been in touch with
[1:54:10] the master.
[1:54:12] Then she said, "Won't you
[1:54:14] pray?" And he said, "I knelt down. I put
[1:54:17] my hands on his feet and I said,
[1:54:19] "Heavenly Father, it's after 9:00 as the
[1:54:22] musicians come. My plane's been gone a
[1:54:25] long time. I pray you to be merciful."
[1:54:27] And he prayed just a little simple
[1:54:29] prayer. And then that little boy said,
[1:54:31] "Oh, mama. Oh, mama, it's getting light
[1:54:34] in the room. Amen. Oh, God is getting
[1:54:37] light in the room. Listen, there's a
[1:54:39] difference between the seal of God and
[1:54:41] the mark of the beast. The seal of God
[1:54:43] might be just in little some little
[1:54:45] shanty on the side of the road somewhere
[1:54:48] where God bypasses all the great stained
[1:54:50] glass windows of the world and comes
[1:54:52] down their little simple humble heart.
[1:54:54] Somebody that can tell the difference.
[1:54:57] They can tell when it's a prophet come
[1:54:59] down the road. They can tell when your
[1:55:01] answer is on its way. I wonder this
[1:55:03] morning if you need an answer, if you
[1:55:05] can recognize that your answer is here
[1:55:06] as we stand to your feet. Whatever you
[1:55:08] have need of, we'll say it like this.
[1:55:10] Your answer is here because your answer
[1:55:12] is laying in the word. If we can
[1:55:14] identify ourselves in the word like that
[1:55:15] little woman over there in India that
[1:55:17] could identify herself with a woman that
[1:55:20] when she needed meal and oil, God come
[1:55:23] on the scene. A little woman there in
[1:55:25] Memphis that when she needed something,
[1:55:27] God come on the scene to answer her
[1:55:29] prayer.
[1:55:30] Brother Brham would ask this question to
[1:55:31] the people listening to him. He said,
[1:55:33] "You, would you raise your hand?" Let's
[1:55:35] bow our heads.
[1:55:37] Let's bow our heads. Would you raise
[1:55:39] your hand? Balcony or bottom floor?
[1:55:42] We've combed through and through each
[1:55:43] night. There perhaps was another one in
[1:55:46] there tonight. Raise up your hand. Will
[1:55:48] you do it anywhere?
[1:55:51] Say, "I want to receive." Do you want to
[1:55:54] receive this morning? I know the service
[1:55:57] has been long. Maybe we're tired out,
[1:56:00] but yet God is in the building. Amen. Do
[1:56:02] you want to receive? Just lift up your
[1:56:04] hand, Lord Jesus. Lord, we're living in
[1:56:07] that hour of deception, Lord Jesus.
[1:56:10] Lord, we're living in the hour where
[1:56:11] according to the scripture, everyone
[1:56:13] will either either take the seal of God
[1:56:16] or the mark of the beast. And Lord, you
[1:56:19] see these hands raised up to you, Lord
[1:56:20] God, desiring something from you, Lord
[1:56:22] Jesus. Lord, Lord, where there's a deep
[1:56:25] to call, there's a deep to answer. And
[1:56:27] I'm so glad this morning that we serve a
[1:56:29] God that answers back. And I pray, God,
[1:56:31] that you'll touch every needy heart this
[1:56:33] morning, Lord Jesus. Everyone that's
[1:56:35] reached out to you for a special touch.
[1:56:37] Lord God, be with your people, Lord
[1:56:39] Jesus, as we worship you now. Amen.
[1:56:43] Let's sing it to him. Lord, if you have
[1:56:46] a need, we'll be glad to pray with you.
[1:56:49] For your
[1:56:50] mercy fails me.
[1:56:54] You believe God is in the building.
[1:56:57] I've been held in your hand. Let's just
[1:57:00] take a few minutes to die out to him.
[1:57:02] From the moment that I wake up, he
[1:57:06] doesn't want partial worship. He wants
[1:57:09] everything we can give him. Oh, I will
[1:57:12] sing of the
[1:57:15] goodness of God.
[1:57:21] And all my life you have been
[1:57:28] faithful. And all my life you have been
[1:57:32] so so
[1:57:36] good. With every breath that I am able.
[1:57:43] For I will

[1:57:47] goodness of
[1:57:50] God. I love your
[1:57:55] voice. You have led me through the
[1:58:00] fire in the darkest
[1:58:03] night. You are close like no
[1:58:08] other. Hallelujah. I've known you as a
[1:58:13] father. I've known you as a

[1:59:08] me. In all my
[1:59:11] days, I've been held in your hands.
[1:59:17] From the moment that I wake
[1:59:20] up until I lay my
[1:59:24] head. Oh, I will
[1:59:27] sing of the
[1:59:29] goodness of God.

[2:00:44] me. Your goodness is running after
[2:00:49] running after me. With my life laid
[2:00:53] down, I surrender now. I give you
[2:00:59] everything. Your goodness is running

[2:03:55] where he brought me from. I got so
[2:04:01] much
[2:04:03] to him.
[2:04:09] And
[2:04:12] sometimes while on this way I

[2:06:59] Amen.
[2:07:00] We've got so much to praise him for. We
[2:07:03] just don't have time to praise him. You
[2:07:06] think about when uh Rahab was on that
[2:07:08] wall and the walls came down and she
[2:07:10] married she married into praise. She
[2:07:12] married into the Judah whose banner is
[2:07:14] praise.
[2:07:16] So many things that she look she can
[2:07:17] look back and thank God for bringing her
[2:07:20] out of. Amen. So many things to thank
[2:07:23] God for. When you look back and remember
[2:07:27] what he's done for you and where he's
[2:07:28] brought you from.
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:33] Well, I think you got some announcements
[2:07:35] to make, so I'll just turn it over to
[2:07:37] brother Wade. Let's give our brother.
[2:07:45] Amen.
[2:07:47] We got so much to thank him for. You
[2:07:48] ought to go. You ought to sit down
[2:07:50] sometime and uh just write down Oh, just
[2:07:54] write down on a piece of paper. I know
[2:07:56] that's hard to do because we have
[2:07:58] computers and all that other stuff, but
[2:08:00] just take you a little scratch pad one
[2:08:02] day and just every time you think about
[2:08:03] something God's done for you, just write
[2:08:04] it down.
[2:08:07] May not think of something till the next
[2:08:08] day, write it down. May not think
[2:08:10] nothing till the next day, but just keep
[2:08:12] you a pad there and write down. Listen,
[2:08:14] we always think about all the bad things
[2:08:16] we do have been done, right? We always
[2:08:18] No, let's meditate on the good things
[2:08:20] that he's done for us. Cuz God's good.
[2:08:22] He's not bad. He can do nothing bad.
[2:08:26] He's always doing something good. We
[2:08:28] just got to attach oursel to that. But
[2:08:30] that was wonderful. Best, best, best
[2:08:32] job. Good job. And we pray that that
[2:08:35] anointing will stay on you and when you
[2:08:37] get out there to brother Chris Longs and
[2:08:39] you'll take that same message and preach
[2:08:41] it to them. And man, that was good. Good
[2:08:44] job. Good to see everybody here. Good to
[2:08:46] have our sister that was here today from
[2:08:48] uh she's actually from Romania and uh um
[2:08:51] she was uh here visiting her son. And
[2:08:54] then good to have all the I don't know
[2:08:57] we is there any bautistas that are not
[2:09:01] here. You there's there where's the
[2:09:04] sister? The sisters back
[2:09:06] there. So we got we got them from from
[2:09:09] Honduras. They're there. Yep. The
[2:09:11] husband. You've been here before though.
[2:09:13] God bless you. We appreciate you. Love
[2:09:14] you with the love of the Lord. Thank you
[2:09:16] all for coming and we sure appreciate
[2:09:18] the Lord giving us what we need in the
[2:09:21] hour that we need it in. And we need it
[2:09:23] this hour. Amen. Amen. And and as Bob
[2:09:26] was saying, uh, America is going to look
[2:09:29] great, though.
[2:09:31] Okay. America's going to look great
[2:09:32] because remember peace peace and then
[2:09:35] come in with flattery. There's going to
[2:09:36] be a deception there that everything's
[2:09:38] going up up up. But it's just it's just
[2:09:41] a facade. Exactly. It's a facade. It's
[2:09:44] what? It's what Satan wants you to see.
[2:09:47] Exactly. But see, we
[2:09:49] see and it's and it's really interesting
[2:09:51] that Brother Brown said that in 1955 in
[2:09:54] Chicago cuz that's where the Pope was
[2:09:56] born at that same year when he said
[2:09:59] America's gone. If she don't accept them
[2:10:01] by 1956, she's gone. Well, now you got
[2:10:04] the two married together and we're
[2:10:06] fixing to either be in or be out. The
[2:10:10] door's getting ready to close. I just
[2:10:12] feel it. I know it. Um I pray that you
[2:10:15] pray. Why do we want to pray to stay
[2:10:17] here? Who wants to pray to stay in this
[2:10:20] in this world? Lord, just keep me here.
[2:10:22] Well, you know what? He may just let you
[2:10:24] do that. But I want to be I want to be
[2:10:27] ejected out of this place. Uh this world
[2:10:30] is not my home. I'm just passing
[2:10:32] through. And as as a brother
[2:10:34] said, this is just the beginning. This
[2:10:38] is not the end. This is the beginning of
[2:10:40] your Christian journey is fixing to come
[2:10:42] up. The real one you're heading to.
[2:10:44] Amen. This is the trials and troubles
[2:10:46] and tribulations, but that's going to be
[2:10:48] an eternity of pleasure that we can't
[2:10:52] even think of. You could drive yourself
[2:10:54] crazy trying to think about eternity,
[2:10:56] but just don't do it. Just be satisfied
[2:10:58] that it's here. And then what it'll do,
[2:11:00] it'll lead you and guide you into all
[2:11:01] truth. So, you just depend on that guide
[2:11:03] to lead you and guide you into all
[2:11:05] truth. Uh, next Sunday we got um foot
[2:11:08] washing and communion and brother Bob
[2:11:11] will be gone. Um, I'll be preaching this
[2:11:14] Wednesday night. Just pray for me. I'm
[2:11:16] having a endoscopy on my throat and
[2:11:19] stomach Wednesday morning. So, maybe
[2:11:21] I'll be able to preach Wednesday. I
[2:11:22] should be able to. So, um, and then just
[2:11:25] remember what's coming up. Brother
[2:11:26] Trevor Emans is coming on Sunday. And
[2:11:29] then I want to announce that um,
[2:11:31] Father's Day weekend. We always try to
[2:11:34] do something that we haven't been
[2:11:35] fishing in a long time. But on that
[2:11:38] Saturday, which is June the 16th, I
[2:11:41] think that Saturday, all the men and the
[2:11:44] and the young kids, boys, cuz it's
[2:11:48] Father's Day, we're going to meet at the
[2:11:51] deer lodge and have supper up there at
[2:11:54] about 4:00 on Saturday. Now, if you want
[2:11:56] to go on up early to Helen and do some
[2:11:57] things, if you want to, you can do that.
[2:12:00] But we will as a church group will come
[2:12:02] together with the men and all the men
[2:12:04] and the and the um young men will eat at
[2:12:07] the deer lodge at 4:00. The church will
[2:12:10] be paying for it and that'll be our gift
[2:12:12] to you on Father's Day. So remember that
[2:12:14] there whatever the Saturday is before
[2:12:16] Father's Day. We will go to uh to the
[2:12:19] deer lodge. If you don't know, if you've
[2:12:21] never been before, it's just like today.
[2:12:23] We got a lot to eat. We had a full meal
[2:12:26] today. Yes, sir. You'll get a few You'll
[2:12:28] get a full meal there, too. So, the
[2:12:30] natural meal, but we had a real good
[2:12:32] spiritual meal. I want you listen, the
[2:12:34] atmosphere, the worship, everything was
[2:12:36] done the way I I just really when I when
[2:12:39] I took over, really took over, I wanted
[2:12:41] our worship to elevate.
[2:12:44] All right. We've got the preaching,
[2:12:47] right? Come on, people. We got the
[2:12:48] preaching. Yes, sir. We need But we need
[2:12:51] to make sure we reap every benefit that
[2:12:53] God's got for us. Right. Amen. It's just
[2:12:56] not all the preaching. Yes, it is.
[2:12:57] That's the most important thing. But
[2:12:58] what brings the atmosphere as brother
[2:13:01] Bob said coming out we we were uh we
[2:13:05] were laughing. Uh Abby went to
[2:13:07] graduation and and um she gra or she
[2:13:10] graduated and we went to watch and
[2:13:11] brother Joe and him were there and uh
[2:13:14] Trudy was there. Collins and and they
[2:13:17] were and sister Christine. I'm going to
[2:13:19] tell on all y'all. Every one of you and
[2:13:24] Bella and Zoe. We had several people
[2:13:28] there from our church. Y'all scre They
[2:13:30] screamed the whole
[2:13:32] time. The whole time. Abby Abby Grace
[2:13:35] Roberts come walking down the thing and
[2:13:37] they're
[2:13:39] like I said, "Can we have a little bit
[2:13:42] of that at
[2:13:43] church? Can we have just a little bit of
[2:13:45] that at church?" And when they were
[2:13:47] walking down the aisle, they were
[2:13:48] high-fiving everybody. And I thought,
[2:13:49] "Bob would go crazy if we all stood
[2:13:51] right there." And and as he come in the
[2:13:54] door, we were high-fiving him, you know.
[2:13:56] But listen, they were happy they
[2:13:57] graduated. We better be happy that we're
[2:14:00] heading to a graduation.
[2:14:03] We got to go through the school. They
[2:14:04] went through 13 years. Somebody said,
[2:14:05] "Why are they so happy?" I said, "They
[2:14:07] spent 13 years doing this." Well,
[2:14:09] listen. You plug in that how many long
[2:14:11] hours and years you've been a Christian.
[2:14:14] There's one day you're going to
[2:14:15] graduate. But you got to go to school.
[2:14:18] You got to take the hard knocks. You got
[2:14:19] to take all this. It's a preaching
[2:14:21] spirit up here. I'm
[2:14:23] sorry. All the hard knocks. But one day
[2:14:26] though, that's going to release. And
[2:14:28] when it releases, listen, it's not going
[2:14:29] to release up there. That's right. We're
[2:14:32] going to get changed down here. Amen.
[2:14:34] We're going to have a a resurrection
[2:14:36] down here. This is where our graduation
[2:14:40] day is going to be. And then we're going
[2:14:41] to get out of here. And we're not ever
[2:14:43] going to have to deal with this world
[2:14:44] again. That's right. This world is not
[2:14:46] my home. I'm just a passing through.
[2:14:49] Amen. God bless you. All minds clear.
[2:14:51] Amen. Um,
[2:14:54] just thank brother Bob just just that he
[2:14:56] yielded himself to the Lord. It wasn't
[2:14:58] brother Bob that spoke to us today.
[2:14:59] That's right. Amen. Everybody with me?
[2:15:02] When brother Bob speaks to you when when
[2:15:04] when he speaks like that, that's the
[2:15:05] Lord speaking. And he's speaking to your
[2:15:08] heart, not to your mind. That's right.
[2:15:11] And just remember that mark of that
[2:15:12] beast. The Bible specifically says in,
[2:15:16] not on.
[2:15:18] You can tattoo 666 on your forehead all
[2:15:20] you want to. People tattoo it already.
[2:15:23] All right, but it said in in inside your
[2:15:27] hand and inside your forehead where your
[2:15:29] thinking is. So that's it. Don't be
[2:15:32] looking around trying to find, oh,
[2:15:33] that's the mark of the be. No. If you're
[2:15:36] not born again, you already have that
[2:15:37] mark in your mind because your mind is
[2:15:39] not the mind of Christ. That's I'm
[2:15:41] sorry. That's just it. you if you don't
[2:15:43] have the mind of Christ, if you don't
[2:15:45] have the Holy Ghost that's washed that
[2:15:47] mind of yours and not your brain, I'm
[2:15:48] talking about your mind, your heart,
[2:15:50] your soul. If it hadn't marked that and
[2:15:53] sealed that, then you do already have
[2:15:55] the mark because what is the mark of the
[2:15:58] beast? It's turning the word down. And
[2:16:01] until you get the new birth, you are
[2:16:03] literally turning the word down. That's
[2:16:05] right, brother. You're turning God down.
[2:16:07] Amen. Remember God said Moses or whoever
[2:16:10] it was said they they turned turn no
[2:16:13] Moses they didn't turn you down they
[2:16:14] turned me down right what through Moses
[2:16:17] or through a Christian if you turn God
[2:16:20] down you're just not a Christian you
[2:16:22] can't be you can't fight right God can't
[2:16:26] fight God it's opposing forces and
[2:16:29] that's what we're looking at opposing
[2:16:30] forces anything not word related
[2:16:35] it's the antichrist that's Right. Amen.
[2:16:38] Anything word related is the antichrist.
[2:16:42] And like I said, don't look for the
[2:16:44] sign. I mean, signs are good, but we in
[2:16:46] the right vehicle. I believe I believe
[2:16:48] we're in the right vehicle. And I
[2:16:49] believe we're on the right road.
[2:16:51] Watch the signs. Look for the signs.
[2:16:53] Caution, warning, got to stop. Look at
[2:16:58] the signs. But that's not going to get
[2:16:59] you. You got to have a vehicle first.
[2:17:03] And that vehicle will take us. But I'm
[2:17:05] telling you, I I'm like, Brother Bob,
[2:17:06] every time I pull on a uh I'll go to
[2:17:08] YouTube and I'll look at some of these
[2:17:10] political pundits and all this stuff and
[2:17:12] they're talking about the Pope here and
[2:17:14] you know, the Pope's going to do this
[2:17:15] and Trump's over here going to do this
[2:17:17] and you all you do is see I the world is
[2:17:20] just half are afraid and half are don't
[2:17:23] know and half don't half don't care and
[2:17:25] half are afraid, right? But when you can
[2:17:27] start see what we see, we've had it in
[2:17:29] our mind. We've been preached this for
[2:17:32] years. Brother Brown said it in
[2:17:35] 1955 and then in the 60s the pope's
[2:17:37] going to come out of the United States.
[2:17:39] Well then all we see is
[2:17:40] well here's a political power over here.
[2:17:44] We know it's
[2:17:45] here, right? We know this is over here
[2:17:48] now and we know they're coming together.
[2:17:50] You just watch and see them two will get
[2:17:52] together if they hadn't already got
[2:17:53] together and that's the two leaders of
[2:17:55] who we're talking about. If they ain't
[2:17:56] already got together, they're going to
[2:17:57] get together. That's right. And they're
[2:17:59] going to bring everybody together and
[2:18:01] they're going to bring those preachers
[2:18:02] that were all up there the other day at
[2:18:03] the White House. All they Pentecostal,
[2:18:06] they was charismatic. They were all in
[2:18:08] that room
[2:18:09] together even with the Catholics, right?
[2:18:14] And they come together in unity.
[2:18:18] But see how false that is though?
[2:18:20] Because that sounds good. We're supposed
[2:18:21] to be in unity, right? The Bible tells
[2:18:24] us unity of the faith. We're supposed to
[2:18:25] be in unity together. But that's the
[2:18:27] right kind of unity.
[2:18:30] When they unite, it's going to look
[2:18:31] good. This whole world is going to just
[2:18:33] be drunk. They're already drunk. The
[2:18:37] Bible said they'd be drunk on the wine
[2:18:39] of the fornication. Well, everything
[2:18:41] that's not of God is of fornication. So,
[2:18:43] right what the Bible says. Amen. Okay.
[2:18:45] Anyway, so let's close.
[2:18:48] Sometime Thank you, brother Bob. We're
[2:18:50] just going to keep this right here and
[2:18:51] they'll be here Wednesday night.
[2:18:54] Amen. Thank you, buddy. That's the best
[2:18:55] you ever done. I I appreciate that you
[2:18:57] poured your heart out. I appreciate it.
[2:18:58] Give me one more good
[2:19:03] hand. But just remember these things
[2:19:05] coming up. Remember Father's Day
[2:19:07] weekend, Saturday 4:00. Saturday 4:00
[2:19:10] we'll meet at the deer lodge. If you
[2:19:11] don't know where it's at, we'll all get
[2:19:12] together and go. If you want to go on up
[2:19:13] Saturday and do some they got plenty of
[2:19:15] stuff to do up there, fishing, um putt
[2:19:18] putt, and all kind of stuff up there if
[2:19:20] you want to do it in Helen, which is
[2:19:21] just a few more miles up and you get to
[2:19:23] the deer lodge. So all mine's clear. You
[2:19:25] love the Lord. Amen. He's good to us.
[2:19:28] Amen. He's in the building. Yes, sir.
[2:19:30] And let's just take him home with us.
[2:19:32] Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly
[2:19:33] father, thank you for this day you've gi
[2:19:35] us. Truly, Father, this is a special
[2:19:37] time coming up on Memorial Day. Lord,
[2:19:40] what a memorial we can put in the books
[2:19:43] today of our Christian
[2:19:45] experience that we've been told, Father,
[2:19:48] that you love us. You care for us. We're
[2:19:53] chosen,
[2:19:55] predestinated, and we're in the right
[2:19:57] place. Father, I pray that the ones that
[2:20:00] are not will be convicted so much in
[2:20:03] their heart, Lord, till they'll want you
[2:20:05] more than anything in the world. Father,
[2:20:07] just be with us now. Be the ones that
[2:20:09] were sick that couldn't be here today,
[2:20:10] Father. The ones that are sin sick,
[2:20:13] Lord, that we're we're claiming, Lord,
[2:20:15] all the ones, Lord, that are out there
[2:20:16] in the world, Father. cuz it's being a
[2:20:18] late hour, we're compelled to as the
[2:20:20] Shunimite woman did, she got down on her
[2:20:22] knees and she prayed for that lost son
[2:20:25] that she had. Father, I pray that we'll
[2:20:28] pray for our lost children. Lord, more
[2:20:30] now than ever before. And Father, you'll
[2:20:33] be with us now and take care of us till
[2:20:35] we come back together on Wednesday
[2:20:36] night. Lord, we love you, Father. We
[2:20:38] love the things that you've given us. We
[2:20:40] love the atmosphere you've given us
[2:20:41] today, Lord. Now, we pray that you'll
[2:20:44] not lift that off of us, that it'll stay
[2:20:47] on us, Lord. It'll keep us and anoint
[2:20:49] us, Lord, for the things that we need to
[2:20:50] do the rest of the week. Father, have a
[2:20:52] good Memorial Day tomorrow. Lord, I pray
[2:20:54] that you'd just be with the ones, Lord,
[2:20:55] that have lost loved ones in the wars
[2:20:57] and many different things. Father, that
[2:20:59] even now, Lord, there's still some
[2:21:01] getting killed. And Father, we pray that
[2:21:03] you'd just help each one, Lord, that's
[2:21:05] lost something in their life, Lord. That
[2:21:07] it would truly be a memorial day to you,
[2:21:10] Father. that you gave your life. You had
[2:21:13] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[2:21:14] and you won. Father, you ward it out in
[2:21:17] the garden and you went to Calvary and
[2:21:20] you shed your blood and gave your life
[2:21:21] for a sinner such as me. I thank you for
[2:21:23] that. Father, what a mighty God we
[2:21:26] serve. We pray these things in Jesus
[2:21:28] name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[2:21:30] dismissed. Oh, there's a river of life
[2:21:34] without
[2:21:37] me to walk you up to
[2:21:42] see. Open prison doors. Set the captive
[2:21:48] free. There's a river of life flowing
[2:21:52] out from me. Bring up old
[2:21:56] well within my soul.
[2:21:59] Bring up a
[2:22:01] well and make me
[2:22:04] whole. Bring up a
[2:22:07] well and give to
[2:22:11] me that life
[2:22:17] abundantly. Oh, there's a river of life
[2:22:20] flowing out from
[2:22:23] me. Made the lame to walk and the blind
[2:22:28] to see.
[2:22:30] Open praise and doors set the captive
[2:22:35] free. There's a river of life flowing
[2:22:39] out from me. Bring
[2:22:42] up within my
[2:22:45] soul. Bring
[2:22:48] up and make me
[2:22:51] whole. Bring
[2:22:55] it to me.
[2:22:59] Oh,
[2:23:03] wonder. Oh, there's a river of
[2:23:07] lifeowing down me.
