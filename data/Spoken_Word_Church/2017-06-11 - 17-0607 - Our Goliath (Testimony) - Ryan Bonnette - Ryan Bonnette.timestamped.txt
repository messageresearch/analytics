[0:00] good evening everybody so two Wednesday
[0:02] nights ago brother Terrence mentioned a
[0:04] request a praise report that we had
[0:06] about a tree that fell on our property
[0:08] and I wanted to give you the testimony
[0:13] than the pictures about that can you
[0:15] pull up the first slide please
[0:17] so because what happened was actually
[0:20] very supernatural so it's over the last
[0:23] 10 years gee that's can y'all see that
[0:27] you dim a couple of lights maybe four
[0:29] please so ten years ago Gabby now got
[0:34] married and moved into this little house
[0:35] that we live in and we've been keeping
[0:38] around on that big hickory tree because
[0:40] it's enormous and because of that little
[0:42] hollow place there at the bottom of the
[0:43] tree but it wasn't any real reason to be
[0:46] concerned right off just because it was
[0:48] a still very live tree very strong now I
[0:51] can't see brother Wade next slide please
[1:00] in March of this year though there came
[1:03] a big wind in the storm and the like a
[1:07] tornado force wind just for about five
[1:09] seconds it sound like a locomotive in
[1:11] our backyard and and we started seeking
[1:13] shelter and then all at once it stopped
[1:15] went out the next day and looked and
[1:17] there was now a big crack in addition to
[1:18] her hollow place down the side of the
[1:21] tree about the first 12 feet of that
[1:23] trunk so we started calling around and
[1:27] thinking you know now it's time to have
[1:28] the tree removed so we called several
[1:31] tree companies go back one side please
[1:35] and what we're just going to do is have
[1:37] them cut the limbs off the top of the
[1:39] tree that would remove the threat so it
[1:40] couldn't reach her house maybe 500 bucks
[1:43] is what I was thinking when they said
[1:45] two to four thousand dollars because
[1:47] they're gonna have to bring in heavy
[1:48] equipment so I said no thank you
[1:50] so they're looking into ways of doing it
[1:52] myself which is somewhat irrational
[1:55] because it'd be very dangerous but
[1:57] anyway in the meantime go to the next
[1:59] slide please just so you know what these
[2:02] are also temporarily is a measure to
[2:05] keep try to keep it from falling on
[2:07] house secured it to two other adjacent
[2:08] trees with log change but that really
[2:10] wouldn't keep it off our house
[2:11] permanently that was just in the
[2:12] meantime till I could get
[2:13] I'm done I next slide
[2:16] so here's the setup we've got next slide
[2:24] next slide there's so our house here
[2:29] this is on the back edge of our property
[2:31] can everybody see that okay so our house
[2:34] here oh that's better
[2:37] neighbor's house here other neighbor's
[2:39] house here our utility building us here
[2:41] barn down there so the tree is
[2:43] surrounded by about five structures so
[2:45] any way it would fall in that direction
[2:47] it would desecrate whatever it would
[2:49] land on because a very lively very heavy
[2:51] full of moisture tree so it would be
[2:54] very damaging I'll stand there all I was
[2:58] doing wasn't thing about the scripture I
[2:59] was standing about in this spot where
[3:01] this picture was taken from looking up
[3:03] at it studying and thinking now what can
[3:05] I do to take this down without hurting
[3:06] myself and all of a sudden the scripture
[3:09] came to my mind where Jesus said Luke 17
[3:11] 6 if you have faith as a grain of
[3:13] mustard seed you shall say to this I
[3:16] think it said sick of entry be thou
[3:18] plucked up by the root and be thou
[3:19] planted in the sea and it should obey
[3:21] you so I looked up at the tree and I
[3:23] thought now I can't fall anywhere over
[3:25] this way without doing damage but back
[3:27] on this side is a dilapidated chain-link
[3:30] fence
[3:30] it belongs to an adjacent commercial
[3:33] property already falling in they don't
[3:35] care about the fence evidently so I said
[3:37] to that tree I just slipped up in a
[3:39] quiet voice I said when you fall fall
[3:42] this way I didn't shout I wasn't
[3:45] anointed I wasn't like anything great
[3:47] God hides in such simplicity that
[3:49] sometimes it can be working through you
[3:51] and you not even know it
[3:52] okay God is really incredible in hiding
[3:55] in simplicity and so much to where you
[3:57] won't even realize when he's working
[3:58] through you well that was back in March
[4:01] or so and I went on and forgot about it
[4:04] now I should also mention that on this
[4:08] side of the tree facing our house
[4:11] most of the limbs are on that side and
[4:13] I'm not talking about little in some of
[4:14] these limbs are the size of a small tree
[4:16] themselves and some of them shoot 20 or
[4:18] 30 feet out over a yard so all the
[4:20] weights on that side of the tree if you
[4:22] stand here and look up it's got about a
[4:24] four or five degree lean toward our
[4:26] house
[4:26] and then the hollow place in the cracked
[4:28] place on that side of trees so
[4:30] everything every rational thought would
[4:32] tell you that that tree is going to fall
[4:34] on that house okay but I didn't stand
[4:36] there and rationalize about it those
[4:38] things didn't come into my mind I just
[4:39] simply looked up and said when you fall
[4:41] go this way
[4:43] you know there's a thing in the military
[4:46] I've never been in the military but
[4:48] heard this quote that I like a soldier's
[4:49] duty is not to reason why
[4:51] a soldier's duty is to do or die
[4:54] the desperate or perish but just simply
[4:56] obey what you've been told to do no
[4:59] matter how irrational it seems and the
[5:00] scripture plainly said Jesus didn't say
[5:02] wood the tree lean that way or make it
[5:05] fall the way it's you know wanting to
[5:06] fall in anyway he just said speak to
[5:08] this tree that's it
[5:09] we had a legitimate need we just needed
[5:11] it not fall in our house which wasn't me
[5:13] temps in God
[5:14] I wasn't testing to see what I could do
[5:16] so next slide please
[5:18] at the same time this was going on I
[5:20] didn't realize this but Gabby was inside
[5:23] the house during the same about the same
[5:26] time telling our kids they said mommy is
[5:29] it going to fall in our house they said
[5:30] and she said to them no this tree is
[5:32] going to be like Goliath you know in the
[5:33] story of David and Goliath he was struck
[5:35] in the front but he fell forward he
[5:37] should have fallen backward but I
[5:39] believe God had him fall forward because
[5:40] he was defying God the boss says every
[5:42] knee shall bow you know if you defy God
[5:44] he'll bring you to your knees and bring
[5:45] you down and the fact is Goliath I'll
[5:47] forward when he should have fell
[5:48] backwards so Gaby was telling the girls
[5:50] no baby that tree is going to fall
[5:52] backwards the weight was on the front of
[5:55] the tree search the salt should fall
[5:56] forward
[5:57] she said no it's going to fall backwards
[5:58] so she was making that confession and I
[6:00] was speaking to the tree and we didn't
[6:02] know that either one of us was doing
[6:03] that
[6:04] no but the veil told us to read the
[6:06] message of grace about a week ago I was
[6:08] reading through that about my third time
[6:09] reading that and I've never caught this
[6:11] before sure y'all knew this but this is
[6:14] the second time that brother Branham
[6:15] spoke squirrels into existence
[6:17] I always thought it's just that one time
[6:20] but he says I thought right here for God
[6:23] gave me them squirrels last year to
[6:24] speak into existence took off my hat
[6:26] again and said Lord God you're still the
[6:27] same Jesus you're still God somebody
[6:29] said to me how many do you need this
[6:31] time I said this to the other times
[6:32] limit and then I said I shall have this
[6:34] trend up before 10 o'clock today and
[6:36] strangely the same system there was a
[6:38] very bad mosquito area
[6:39] grows infested with mosquitoes and the
[6:41] kind of a swampland and the great big
[6:43] mosquito came to bite me right by my eye
[6:45] and I said not one of them will bother
[6:47] me this day
[6:48] so speaking the nature and then he went
[6:51] on to say fall into it and he said the
[6:54] Sun will shine within 30 minutes the
[6:55] brother phantoms speaking to nature
[6:56] three times he's commanded nature and if
[6:58] you read on all three of those things
[7:00] came to pass the squirrels came to
[7:02] resistance the mosquitoes went away and
[7:04] the Sun came out so what's happening
[7:06] here Jesus said the meek shall inherit
[7:07] the earth
[7:08] right this is there's a position we're
[7:10] coming to and I believe this is leading
[7:12] up to that now the next slide please
[7:14] this shows you that tree towering over
[7:17] our house it dwarfs the other trees in
[7:20] our backyard it's this middle one right
[7:21] here that's our Goliath okay and this is
[7:26] our little teeny-weeny house and just
[7:29] before I forget to say if the tree were
[7:31] to fall this way we later measure the
[7:33] tree and found out where it would land
[7:34] the top of the tree would be on my
[7:36] Nissan Frontier in our front yard
[7:38] it would have engulfed our house there
[7:43] was another storm that came to Tuesday
[7:48] nights ago 10:30 at night that tree fell
[7:50] now there's only one tree in our
[7:52] neighborhood that we know of that fell
[7:54] there was a lot of wind in a lot of
[7:55] areas I think a lot of damage in North
[7:57] Georgia Noah Green Street had a tough
[7:59] time there was a lot of trees fell on
[8:00] Green Street but in our neighborhood
[8:02] there's only one tree that we know that
[8:04] fell very odd the way this happened but
[8:07] that night the girls are already in beds
[8:09] they weren't stomping and running around
[8:10] making noise so there's no reason we
[8:12] should have not heard that tree fall see
[8:15] anybody ever heard of tree fall it's
[8:17] very violent and very awesome it takes
[8:19] down the tops of other trees with it it
[8:20] brings down whole other trees with it
[8:22] and breaks off the limbs of other trees
[8:23] it grabs everything grab on the way down
[8:25] the the trunk will pop and crack and
[8:28] twist and torque and then finally when
[8:30] it hits the ground it makes a loud thud
[8:31] and you can feel it in your insides
[8:33] shaking if you're within a hundred feet
[8:34] of it well none of that okay the
[8:39] girlfriend bed is sleep I was on this
[8:40] end of the house gaving I was off work
[8:44] that week so I was at home
[8:45] Gavin I were doing our quiet time on
[8:46] opposite ends of the house I was reading
[8:48] so I was well able to hear the storm and
[8:50] she was on this end
[8:52] in the back bedroom the most vulnerable
[8:53] position to be in
[8:55] if that tree should fall in the house
[8:56] and she was listening to brother Bob I
[9:00] think in one year she always keeps one
[9:01] ear open
[9:02] she has an earbud in one ear and she
[9:03] keeps other ear open to hear kids
[9:05] because together so we were both able to
[9:07] hear the storm there wasn't a lot of
[9:08] wind at our house it was done but not a
[9:10] lot and then you know just heavy rain
[9:13] and thunder and lightning all of a
[9:16] sudden we heard a pinging sound on the
[9:17] back of our house sounded like little
[9:18] pieces of bark or debris get in the back
[9:20] of our house where that thing snapped
[9:21] and then we heard Gabi said she heard a
[9:24] few limbs breaking so we ran to the back
[9:26] window and looked thinking that maybe
[9:28] some limbs fell off the tree pitch-black
[9:29] dark about that time to light and lit up
[9:31] the sky and we saw this huge void go to
[9:34] the next slide we saw this great big
[9:36] void where that tree used to stand and
[9:39] it fell exactly where we told it to fall
[9:41] down to the inch exactly the opposite
[9:45] way from our house and I'm telling you I
[9:49] don't know how much wind it would take
[9:50] to make it do that but to overcome the
[9:52] leverage of all those limbs and to write
[9:53] the tree in the first place because it
[9:55] was leaning and bend it backward like
[9:57] that make it fall back had to have taken
[9:58] a lot of land but there wasn't so next
[10:02] slide go back one go back to this
[10:06] previous slide I'm sorry we measured
[10:09] that next one in the length of the tree
[10:10] to be 95 feet we measured it twice we
[10:13] just walked down the length of the trunk
[10:15] on into that neighbor property nothing
[10:17] over there by the way there's a
[10:18] commercial storage building place down
[10:20] here but nothing else for it to hurt it
[10:23] didn't hurt anything except that fence
[10:24] back there 95 feet and we measured from
[10:27] the stump back this way to our house 60
[10:30] 68 feet so it would have completely
[10:33] consumed our home then now the next
[10:36] slide the closest thing came to is that
[10:37] little cheap metal building of ours real
[10:39] thin metal it came within inches of that
[10:42] just a big piece of the of the Barton
[10:45] splintered off of there Thanks slide I'm
[10:48] not a good photographer this the best I
[10:49] could do about getting a side view but
[10:51] basically this is only like the first 10
[10:53] feet of the tree so with your
[10:54] imagination flip that over this way and
[10:56] then add another 85 feet going out that
[10:59] way toward our little house next slide
[11:03] this is just before and after
[11:05] shot of the light that's before he fell
[11:07] standing nice and strong and then after
[11:09] he fell and there's a little Pentecostal
[11:10] kid
[11:11] dancing in our front yard either because
[11:14] it was the last day of school or because
[11:15] the tree fell next time just a closer up
[11:23] view of the same thing and then the last
[11:26] one is a picture of my mom she came to
[11:28] claim the firewood for the next several
[11:30] winters she's got a fireplace so we're
[11:33] going to try to cut it up and haul it to
[11:34] her house but uh the most amazing thing
[11:37] about this is if you look back to the
[11:39] last sermon that was preached here
[11:40] before that happened it was on May 21st
[11:43] this the tree fell on May 23rd May 21st
[11:46] for the Wade the second sermon that day
[11:49] he preached the fall and he preached
[11:52] about the title deed and he was talking
[11:53] a lot about these things about us come
[11:55] back to the position that Adam was in
[11:56] before the fall have dominion with
[11:58] fishes exceeding the fowl of the air and
[11:59] so forth not a coincidence Jesus said
[12:03] the meek shall inherit the earth and you
[12:05] know what's amazing too about this is
[12:06] I'm not standing here to toot mine &
[12:07] Gabby's horn and say we did anything I'm
[12:10] saying all of y'all have done this
[12:11] before y'all but y'all spoken to storms
[12:13] at weather spiritual or natural and move
[12:16] things in your own life you know just
[12:18] don't overlook those things has got
[12:20] hiding simplicity if you really think
[12:21] you'll realize that God was there
[12:23] working through you and just remember
[12:25] the things because what God wants to
[12:27] forget when he does something is for
[12:29] purpose you know thank y'all so much for
[12:31] the time the Lord is he still God amen
[12:42] I appreciate that testimony but I I
[12:45] think we all do that all things are
[12:48] possible to them that believe
[12:49] you know better on I just appreciate
[12:53] their tests
