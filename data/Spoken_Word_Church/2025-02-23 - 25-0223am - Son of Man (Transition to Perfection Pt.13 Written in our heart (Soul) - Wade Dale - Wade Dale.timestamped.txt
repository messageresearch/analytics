[24:20] some
[24:21] light but they didn't have all the light
[24:25] they were reformers we know that he said
[24:28] but you and I say you and I this is our
[24:32] time brother brandham planted the pure
[24:34] seed word of God but there has to be
[24:37] somebody for that rain to fall on to
[24:40] produce something all right what if we
[24:43] took brother John what if brother
[24:45] Brandon preached from 1947 to 1965 and
[24:48] it was never
[24:50] taped it was just hearsay it was just
[24:53] well I heard brother B say this I heard

[25:09] confused I'm sorry without that message
[25:12] of the hour you that's what's going on

[25:16] so they're confused they don't know what
[25:18] to do do we do this do we do that do we
[25:20] believe in this do we believe in that I
[25:21] think we should have today and we're
[25:23] going to get into this a little bit
[25:24] later we should already have that stake
[25:26] put down amen that this is real that
[25:30] this is it there is no other I'm sorry
[25:33] you say well well
[25:34] I God
[25:38] requires one
[25:40] thing live his
[25:42] word not man's opinion that you can do
[25:45] whatever you want
[25:47] to like the Methodist they sprinkle
[25:51] now John Wesley didn't
[25:53] sprinkle John Wesley
[25:56] baptized so who brought that up the
[25:58] founder somebody else during that time
[26:01] said well I think I don't want to get
[26:03] wet today so I'll just get a garden hose
[26:04] I'm sorry and we'll just sprinkle you
[26:07] well that's false that's wrong Jesus
[26:09] wasn't
[26:10] sprinkled if Jesus had to be baptized so
[26:13] do I put me in the water watery grave
[26:16] kill me kill the old me everybody with
[26:19] me so today we're going to talk about
[26:21] written in our heart now when the Bible
[26:23] tells us this we're going to read this
[26:25] when the Bible tells us heart it's not
[26:27] this red thing right here that's pumping
[26:29] blood it's the very core the very center
[26:32] of you so where is this word written

[26:45] might have a you might have an outside
[26:47] emotion you might have a feeling you

[27:28] ones among us today well Lord uh you

[27:32] that that we would turn this a little
[27:34] bit Lord in a little bit different way

[27:38] void but it'll accomplish everything
[27:40] that it said it would accomplish I

[27:44] standing in front of a bunch of
[27:45] Believers that that
[27:47] believe in your word and Lord as it goes
[27:50] forth Lord may you as the prophet of God

[27:59] seed's coming up into maturity father so
[28:01] that you can come and get a mature bride
[28:04] a mature wheat plant but father we've
[28:07] got to come to church and do the things
[28:09] and and have the conduct and the order
[28:11] and the doctrine those things Lord are
[28:13] are done truly from our heart that we
[28:16] love you so much that you died for us
[28:18] you didn't have to but you died to save
[28:21] my stinking soul and Lord my gift back
[28:24] to you is to try our best to live what
[28:27] you said father just forgive us Lord of
[28:29] our many mistakes and our faults bless
[28:31] us now come down in this congregation
[28:33] Lord and you speak to the people and
[28:35] father may we get something from you

[28:51] Jesus name amen everybody say amen amen
[28:57] I want you to practice that about every
[28:59] three
[29:01] sentences okay I got you didn't I 1
[29:05] Corinthians 2 verse 9 but as it is
[29:08] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[29:11] now watch I hath not seen ear hath not
[29:13] heard neither have entered into the
[29:16] heart
[29:18] soul of man the things which God had
[29:21] prepared for them what that love him
[29:23] that Agape him not felo him filo love is
[29:27] is the love you have is conditional the
[29:30] love of God is Not unconditional the
[29:32] love of God can't change if he ever
[29:33] loved you before the foundation of the
[29:34] world you're going to come to that
[29:36] realization somewhere on this Earth that
[29:38] God loved you before you were even you
[29:41] weren't even
[29:42] lovable but he saw you'd be here he saw
[29:45] you would do as we're going to talk
[29:47] about just in a minute well we're going
[29:48] to get the devil on the run today if
[29:50] that's all right that okay he ain't got
[29:52] much room to sit here because we got a
[29:53] house full but uh he's
[29:56] here and he's real
[29:59] if you don't think he is I'm going to
[30:00] give you some of
[30:03] mine but God hath revealed them unto us
[30:07] not by
[30:08] letter now remember I we're going to
[30:10] speak on
[30:12] written
[30:14] Epistles not written with an ink pen not
[30:17] written with a ball or or or a pencil
[30:21] but written in our heart with
[30:24] blood that Jesus on the cross he wrote
[30:27] it in blood and then he told us he said
[30:30] look you got to Worship in spirit and
[30:32] truth you can't worship by the
[30:34] letter but God had to reveal them unto
[30:36] us by his spirit for the spirit searches
[30:38] look all things ye the Deep things of
[30:41] God for what man knoweth the things of a
[30:43] man sa the spirit of man which is in him
[30:46] right we're all controlled today by a
[30:51] spirit absolutely that's why me and
[30:54] brother brother was talking uh the other
[30:56] day um
[30:58] cuz God changes his mind a lot in this
[31:04] message but he doesn't everywhere else
[31:06] cuz people say God told me to do this
[31:07] and then three months later they're
[31:08] going somewhere else if God tells you
[31:10] something he ain't going to back off he
[31:12] ain't going to change his mind you might
[31:14] change yours and I'm like brother Burley
[31:16] we both
[31:17] agreed God may have told them to do that
[31:20] but what God are they talking to what
[31:23] God are they listening to there's a God
[31:24] of this evil age that's so close it
[31:26] could deceive the very so you better
[31:28] know what God you're listening to you
[31:31] say oh there's only one God there's only
[31:33] one Lord Jesus Christ who is God but
[31:35] there's many gods come on people God is
[31:38] an object of worship you can love your
[31:40] car that could be your God some people's
[31:42] jobs is their God
[31:46] Amen now we have received not the spirit
[31:49] of the world now praise God we've been
[31:51] we've been brought out we have received
[31:54] not the spirit of the world but the
[31:56] spirit which is of god that we might
[31:58] know the things that are freely given to
[32:00] us of God one more time and you'll be
[32:02] seated for 2 Corinthians 3 says ye are
[32:05] our
[32:07] epistle written in our hearts known and
[32:10] read of all men now that Ro word written
[32:13] means to engrave or inscribe or record
[32:16] today you're recording what's going on
[32:19] today in your heart your soul is
[32:21] responding to what's going on right it's
[32:25] got to right you can't help it that's
[32:28] why brother B said you're either better
[32:29] or worse when you leave this place you
[32:31] going to keep the demons you brought in
[32:32] or you going to get rid of them one of
[32:33] the two and you can only do it by the
[32:35] word of God so you are our epistle
[32:38] written in our hearts and read of all
[32:40] men for as much as you are manifestly
[32:43] declared to be the epistle what's the
[32:44] epistle it's one to send a message like
[32:47] I said before brother Aaron if we didn't
[32:49] have 1100 sermons if we just if it was
[32:51] just hearsay from a prophet we could
[32:54] preach whatever we wanted to but we got
[32:57] quoes that fit the Bible amen
[33:01] amen but you and
[33:03] I that message is
[33:05] nothing without a group sitting here
[33:08] standing here
[33:09] today it's just
[33:11] words what Paul saying the letter kth in
[33:14] other words he's telling the people
[33:16] you're living Moses letter letter but
[33:20] you're not catching the spirit behind
[33:21] the letter all right everybody with me
[33:24] on that as such trust have we through
[33:27] Christ to God not that we are sufficient
[33:29] of ourselves none of us are to think
[33:31] anything of ourselves but our
[33:33] sufficiency is of God so if I put my
[33:35] sufficiency I'm going to put it in God
[33:38] who also hath made us able Ministers of
[33:40] the New Testament that's why you're not
[33:42] going to get to sit at home and listen
[33:43] you got to come and listen to his
[33:44] Minister I'm sorry that's the way we
[33:47] decided not of the letter but of the
[33:51] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[33:54] giveth life you may be seated in the
[33:55] Lord as his Blessing to the reading word
[33:58] the letter
[33:59] kth you can read this Bible and it will
[34:03] kill you or you can read this Bible and
[34:05] it'll give you life it's your choice
[34:08] it's not my choice today it's your
[34:10] choice everybody with
[34:17] me John 6 verse
[34:21] 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[34:25] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[34:27] I speak unto you this is Jesus they are
[34:30] Spirit he didn't say they are they are a
[34:33] written word he said they are spirit and
[34:36] they are life now that's what I want I
[34:40] want his spirit and his life if I have
[34:41] his spirit and his life I'm good sir
[34:44] then I don't have to build a kingdom
[34:45] down here my kingdom is already built up
[34:47] there yes sir amen is everybody with me
[34:50] amen
[34:53] yes Matthew 11: 25 wherea just keep
[34:58] pointing because Christine's not here so
[35:00] we've got interpretation going on in the
[35:02] room and I get a little bit out of hand
[35:03] so at that time Jesus answered and said
[35:06] I thank thee father now
[35:09] watch this is Jesus
[35:13] talking
[35:15] amen at that time Jesus answered and
[35:17] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[35:18] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[35:21] these things from the wise and
[35:24] prudent but or and has revealed them
[35:29] unto babes all right so that's what we
[35:32] are we're we're newborn babies in Christ
[35:34] when we become a Christian we are
[35:36] newborn babies sometimes we don't get
[35:37] everything but we got to keep growing we
[35:39] got to keep coming we got to keep doing
[35:42] what the things of God not the things of
[35:43] the world right I'm just going to
[35:46] interject this right here instead of

[41:50] service the next
[41:52] whatever but that don't get up devil as
[41:56] you get older he gets a little bit
[41:58] bigger well praise the Lord pray for
[42:02] me but
[42:05] remember there's one
[42:08] thing one thing that's not a demon and
[42:13] that's the Holy
[42:14] Ghost he's a ghost but he's
[42:17] holy he come from God he is God he has
[42:21] defeated every one of those demons if
[42:23] you'll let him right and as you sit here
[42:26] today just know one thing for sure you
[42:30] have on the whole armor of God you have
[42:32] defeated the Devil by just walking in
[42:34] the door you remember brother Ram told
[42:36] that brother said said you fought your
[42:38] whole way to get to church and they said
[42:39] brother what happened he said I just got
[42:41] up put my clothes on and come to church
[42:43] well he don't know how many demons he
[42:44] slayed during that time that was trying
[42:47] to get him to no don't do that don't
[42:48] listen to that man don't go over here
[42:49] don't go over
[42:51] there but let's don't sit at home let's
[42:54] I I'll get to it in just a minute but
[42:56] there's a there's a new commandment or a
[42:58] new way that we're looking at it here
[43:01] because we're transitioning to
[43:03] Perfection well transitioning to
[43:05] Perfection is the transition is there
[43:07] was some demons there that hinder us
[43:10] keep us from doing things now those
[43:12] demons are being
[43:14] shed it'd be just like you shedding
[43:16] everything off right before you come
[43:17] into that door you got layers of of
[43:20] whatever Pride don't get up I don't feel
[43:22] good kids are fighting you start
[43:24] throwing that off and you walk through
[43:25] that door and you say God I'm here
[43:27] I just believe God will meet you
[43:31] here that's why the Bible says forsake
[43:33] not this s together that's what I
[43:36] believe cuz I get a refreshing when I
[43:38] come
[43:40] here I may get it when I go back out the
[43:42] door but I get a refreshing when I come
[43:44] here and see smiling faces see people
[43:47] worship that's another demon oh demon
[43:50] you don't the old you don't need to
[43:52] raise your hands demon well that's okay
[43:54] when you get in heaven you going to be
[43:55] bound like you wouldn't believe and
[43:57] you're going to be an
[43:59] oddball cuz I believe for an eternity
[44:01] we're going to have our hands raised
[44:03] we're going to be praising God
[44:05] absolutely sister we're going to be
[44:06] praising God well why not let's practice
[44:09] here cuz what tells you to not lift your
[44:13] hands a
[44:16] demon what tells you not to listen a
[44:19] devil let's put it where it's supposed
[44:21] to be all right now let's go let's sing
[44:24] let's let's let's get in a sermon now
[44:28] let's see if we can get rid of some of
[44:30] them list of demons y'all got a bunch of
[44:31] them all out of the way you're sitting
[44:32] here
[44:33] today Matthew
[44:36] 13:1 Jesus answered and said unto them
[44:38] because it is given unto you to know the
[44:40] mysteries of the Kingdom or Kingdom of
[44:42] Heaven but to them it is not given Jesus
[44:45] spoke in Parables no one understood him
[44:49] until after he left and came back on the
[44:51] day of Pentecost you know what if God
[44:52] would have come he Brother Joseph he
[44:54] would have come and he would have hung
[44:56] on a cross died for us and he said
[44:59] sianara see you later no he said I'm
[45:03] coming right
[45:04] back and I'm coming back not as one
[45:07] individual with flesh I'm going to come
[45:09] back as a spirit and I'm going to
[45:11] indwell many flesh I'm going to be the
[45:15] final voice to the final age in the end
[45:17] time I'm going to be in a bride that
[45:19] sometimes don't look well I'm going to
[45:20] preach now they don't look well they
[45:22] don't feel well they don't maybe
[45:24] sometimes act well but listen this is it
[45:27] yes there's nothing else left that's
[45:29] right you can put everything you got on
[45:31] everything else but God and you will
[45:34] fail you will fail every
[45:38] time they get to talking about stuff at
[45:41] work and and they're all into that uh
[45:44] and it's okay to invest and it's okay to
[45:46] have money put up but they're checking
[45:48] every three or four days well I made
[45:49] $200 I made $300 my you know my through
[45:52] the post office they have a weird way of
[45:54] doing things but they post it every
[45:57] couple days how much you made or lost
[45:59] according to the stock market or
[46:00] whatever and they said I need well man
[46:03] look at this I made this I
[46:06] said show me the money
[46:10] yeah I only know well I don't have a
[46:12] bold with me I ain't got I'm bold but
[46:15] show me the
[46:17] money they said what do you mean I said
[46:20] that could be gone in a
[46:22] second that's why the Bible tells us
[46:24] that even your life is just vapor
[46:27] it's nothing if you don't have God but
[46:31] if you have God in your soul I promise
[46:34] you it's worth more than listen to this
[46:37] it's worth more than the Creator
[46:39] creating 10,000 more worlds just like
[46:43] this one your one soul is worth more
[46:45] than
[46:47] that it's what you feed that soul with
[46:49] is what gets you here or gets you there
[46:53] keeps you here or gets you there so
[46:55] Jesus spoke in parable so everybody's
[46:57] not going to get this this is going to
[46:58] be puzzling to the world all the world
[47:00] when we trans even the one that are
[47:02] nominal Christians that we're going to
[47:04] transition to Perfection they can't be
[47:06] perfected by an imperfect
[47:09] word all right show me one person in the
[47:13] Bible ever baptized other than the name
[47:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ
[47:17] in the Bible yet somewhere somebody it
[47:20] wasn't God somebody says it's okay to be
[47:24] baptized in titled of father son Holy
[47:28] Ghost God didn't say that the devil
[47:32] did you say oh no I can read where Jesus
[47:35] said baptize in the name father's not a
[47:37] name son's not a name spirit's not a
[47:41] name we have somebody that we can stick
[47:44] a name to his name is the Lord Jesus
[47:46] Christ and he's the one that the bride
[47:48] should be married to not a father or not
[47:51] a son oh by the way you hear the pope is
[47:53] not doing very well folks this thing is
[47:56] coming down to a point real
[48:00] quick we get a pope like like brother
[48:03] Brown said we get a pope out or either
[48:05] close to the United States or in the
[48:06] United States between him and all this
[48:09] other government stuff and I ain't no
[48:10] politician well I guess I am but um I'm
[48:14] a mayor of a city okay A little bitty
[48:15] town I don't dwell in
[48:18] politics there's only one thing that's
[48:20] going to get only side I want to be on
[48:22] is Jesus's side I don't want to be on
[48:24] none of them other sides okay

[49:44] a weight that so easily besets us what
[49:47] is it it's
[49:49] demons it's demonology it's the outside
[49:52] world that influences this world he was
[49:55] delivering a package yesterday to a to a
[49:58] customer and and her van was parked in
[50:00] the yard and I looked on I said oh my
[50:02] word the whole back window said don't

[50:08] oh so I gently laid her package down on
[50:13] her on her stoop there and I eased
[50:17] around I ain't worried about that I
[50:19] ain't no more scared of that or nothing
[50:20] if you're scared of witches then sorry
[50:22] about
[50:24] that like I said I got a ghost but it's
[50:27] holy I ain't worried about them other
[50:29] ghost but that's just the world's
[50:31] thoughts it doesn't matter anymore
[50:34] there's no line of of even
[50:39] morality Romans 16:25 unto them that is
[50:42] of power to establish you according to
[50:45] my gospel Paul says and the preaching of
[50:47] Jesus Christ that's what we're doing
[50:49] today according to the revelation of the
[50:51] mystery so there is a revelation there's
[50:54] a mystery and there's a revelation of
[50:56] that Myst mystery all right like I said
[50:58] before if God would have just took it
[50:59] all with him when he
[51:01] left we couldn't even be sitting here
[51:04] today right if brother Brown just took
[51:07] it all with him we wouldn't be sitting
[51:08] here today but you and I are what
[51:10] written Epistles yes known and read of
[51:13] all men the people in my community they
[51:15] know kind of how we
[51:17] believe cuz we believed it for 50 years
[51:21] it ain't that up down and all the way
[51:22] around and get in the back and hit that
[51:24] take a hammer and hit yourself in the
[51:26] head with it you start cussing like a
[51:28] sailor you say oh Lord Heal My diseases
[51:32] and walk going keep going
[51:34] forward now the himm that is a power to
[51:36] establish you according to my gospel and
[51:38] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[51:40] to the revelation of the mystery now
[51:41] watch which was Kept Secret since the
[51:44] world
[51:45] began right since the world began cuz
[51:49] you know
[51:50] what I was watching CNN had a C-SPAN or
[51:54] whatever it is so they were having a uh
[51:56] they were in Congress and they were
[51:58] having a discussion about
[52:00] factchecking fact got it fact F A
[52:03] factchecking they're fact checking
[52:04] everything Trump did the fact checking
[52:06] all this the fact checking all that the
[52:08] older Kennedy stood up and he
[52:10] said I think one time there was a man in
[52:13] the Bible named
[52:16] Noah and he had a whole lot of fact
[52:24] Checkers it's going to rain it ain't
[52:26] never never rain I'm going to build a
[52:28] boat and save the world you're an
[52:31] idiot we have facts that says you can't
[52:35] do that you know what the end you know
[52:37] what you know what Kennedy said after
[52:38] that he said they all
[52:45] died so listen they can fact check this
[52:48] message all they want to they can dig up
[52:51] garbage against brother randam he was a
[52:52] man we know he was a man he told us his
[52:56] fault
[52:57] he told us where he was wrong he told us
[53:00] when he was in error he told us when he
[53:02] did something against God hello
[53:05] somebody amen
[53:08] amen but those fact
[53:10] Checkers they're the ones that
[53:13] leave that's right and as it happened
[53:16] now didn't the Bible tell us as it was
[53:17] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[53:19] the days of the son of man you can fact
[53:21] check brother R them all you want to I
[53:23] don't care he was a prophet sent from
[53:25] God Vindicated
[53:27] I believe it because it Sparks my heart
[53:29] every time I hear him say a
[53:32] word and it will you too if you'll get
[53:34] the Holy Ghost in your soul other than
[53:37] that you'll what you'll fact check
[53:39] it that's what's happening people are
[53:42] factchecking everything go online
[53:44] sometime see if they they're just a
[53:46] bunch of fat
[53:48] Checkers but they all died in the flood
[53:52] Noah was the only one that made it and
[53:53] his seven CH or six children
[53:58] that was it the fact Checkers have said
[54:01] there's no rain up there
[54:03] no they saw rain one day and they tried
[54:07] to get in that Ark God closed the door
[54:09] of the Ark and that's what we're going
[54:10] to talk about a little bit later on
[54:11] because when we come down to this
[54:13] message at the
[54:14] end we're at the end now amen right but
[54:18] that third pole message that brother Ram
[54:20] had he said Jesus had it and even Noah
[54:22] had it it was to the totally lost the
[54:24] people that the door had already been
[54:26] shut and you can't get
[54:27] in I hate to say that but that's what it
[54:30] is God is going to be what longsuffering
[54:34] is long as he can but there's a time
[54:36] when you got to what get off and On You'
[54:38] got to figure out if you want this or
[54:40] you don't want
[54:42] it cuz listen God's going to shut the
[54:44] door I'm not going to stand here and go
[54:46] now none of y'all can get saved anymore
[54:48] no you just keep
[54:50] preaching Jesus kept
[54:52] preaching Noah kept preaching
[54:56] that's right listen Noah had a
[54:58] revelation they W only going to be but a
[55:00] few people going to get on that boat cuz
[55:02] they ain't big enough for
[55:03] everybody amen plus animals so he had a
[55:07] revelation but you know what he did he
[55:09] didn't stop in about half of the half 50
[55:11] years of the 120 he said ain't n y'all
[55:14] going to make it no he preached until
[55:17] the door was shut even when the door
[55:19] shut even when the door shut he still
[55:22] said Lord more like like like Abraham
[55:25] said Lord if there's 50 in Sodom will
[55:28] you will you will you spare it he said
[55:30] yes sir if there's
[55:32] 50 he got down to
[55:34] 10 he said if you can find 10 will you
[55:36] save it yes well there was only lot his
[55:41] wife two daughters if he' have said four
[55:44] God would have saved
[55:47] Sodom cuz Abraham was his son at the
[55:50] time Abraham was the one that he was the
[55:52] prophet that spoke but when he got to 10
[55:54] he stopped and he couldn't find 10
[55:56] righteous so he destroyed he's going to
[55:58] destroy this world folks you can believe
[56:00] it if you want to this world is in for
[56:03] it and the United States number one cuz
[56:06] you know what God sent a prophet to us
[56:07] in our language in our day and we turned
[56:10] him
[56:14] down but now it's made manifest in how
[56:17] in you and me and by the scriptures of
[56:20] the prophets according to the
[56:22] Commandment of the Everlasting God made
[56:24] known to All Nations for The Obedience
[56:27] of Faith this message has went now to
[56:30] pretty much every country that we know
[56:31] of and that's fulfilling the scripture
[56:33] where Jesus said go into all the world
[56:36] preach the gospel all the
[56:40] world this message have been when it get
[56:42] when it hits Every
[56:44] Nation that's
[56:46] it it never got into China till just
[56:48] several years ago never got into Japan
[56:50] till now few years ago as a message
[56:53] church or two you said boy y'all say it
[56:55] too much on this message message it is
[56:57] the message of eternal life period there
[57:00] is nothing outside this message and now
[57:03] you say well you boy you this message is
[57:06] Jesus
[57:08] Christ now
[57:10] listen now the Greek word for Revelation
[57:12] is apocalypse which means
[57:14] unveiling this unveiling is perfectly
[57:17] described in the example of a sculptor
[57:19] unveiling his work of
[57:21] Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it
[57:23] is an uncovering revealing what was
[57:26] previously hid am that's what a prophet
[57:30] does he gets the mind of God he it's not
[57:33] the mind of God to two or three other
[57:35] people and into to
[57:36] him no it's the mind of God to him
[57:40] that's how a prophet Works read it in
[57:41] the Bible he said I'll do nothing Amos 2
[57:43] and N right I'll do nothing till I
[57:45] reveal it to my servants the prophets so
[57:46] he's not going to do anything you might
[57:48] think you're one prove
[57:51] it like I said
[57:54] before well can have long hair like
[57:57] Jesus did if you'll act like Jesus you
[57:59] can have
[58:02] it number one you wouldn't born virgin
[58:04] so that mean you're
[58:06] out so I just covered that real
[58:11] quick Lord it is an uncovering revealing
[58:14] what was previously hidden now remember
[58:17] John wrote this in about 8096 somewhere
[58:19] in there right the Book of Revelations
[58:21] he was given the he was given the vision
[58:25] and then he wrote it all right now we're
[58:27] living it here everybody with me now the
[58:29] uncovering is not only the revelation of
[58:32] the person of Christ now watch but it's
[58:34] the revelation of his future work in the
[58:38] oncoming bride Church ages all right
[58:42] everybody with
[58:46] me now Bob read this Wednesday night and
[58:49] I've read it several times before going
[58:50] read it again I mentioned it takes the
[58:53] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation listen
[58:55] you're going to fight this message if
[58:56] you don't have the Holy Ghost because
[58:58] it's contrary it's contrary to
[59:01] everything out
[59:03] there but it's proven by the
[59:06] Bible then I mentioned it takes the Holy
[59:08] Spirit to give us Revelation yes
[59:10] sir or it or we will fail to get it I
[59:13] got to slow down a little bit sorry
[59:15] bringing these two thoughts together
[59:17] you'll see that it won't take just
[59:18] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[59:20] book real now remember the whole
[59:23] pretense today is is there is no written
[59:28] Book on a piece of paper and pen that
[59:31] describes the word of God more than him
[59:35] inside of
[59:37] you that's the way he wanted it he
[59:40] wanted it re he listen he even wrote the
[59:44] Scrolls and put them
[59:47] in clay
[59:54] vessels written Epistles
[59:57] known and read of all
[59:58] men as I we' were preaching last Sunday
[1:00:01] the unwritten part you and I are the
[1:00:02] unwritten part they didn't put John DED
[1:00:04] in there or or or um boy Helm your
[1:00:07] name's not in the Bible mine is I'm
[1:00:10] Samuel so y'all all just forget it no
[1:00:14] your name is in there by what
[1:00:16] Association to what you
[1:00:18] believe I believe there was a seventh
[1:00:20] angel messenger cuz God told us in
[1:00:22] Malachi he's going to send us one before
[1:00:24] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:00:25] right so if brother bram's not it we're
[1:00:28] going to have to find one before God
[1:00:30] destroys this world or God's a
[1:00:32] liar did Brother Brown say you take God
[1:00:35] back to the word and he said if he don't
[1:00:36] do exactly what he said you can call him
[1:00:37] a liar that's how much the word of God
[1:00:40] we know that's never going to
[1:00:43] happen because God never changes his
[1:00:46] mind he knew what we needed he knew what
[1:00:48] we needed in this end time he knew we'd
[1:00:51] have demons that we had to navigate that
[1:00:52] others didn't have that's right come on
[1:00:56] internet cell
[1:00:58] phones it's a fight to keep them things
[1:01:01] clean come on
[1:01:03] somebody there's a pool there and it's a
[1:01:07] web for a
[1:01:08] reason a worldwide web everybody's
[1:01:11] caught in it listen I'm using the
[1:01:14] internet now okay we're using the
[1:01:15] internet to get the message
[1:01:17] out but boot devil you might have
[1:01:20] created it but we're using
[1:01:22] it God's been Wi-Fi ever since the
[1:01:25] foundation of the world
[1:01:27] he never needed a cable to hook into
[1:01:29] nothing he's been giving it to us by
[1:01:31] what Wi-Fi all he's doing it right now
[1:01:35] amen it's going to take the operation of
[1:01:38] the Holy Ghost that's why brother R said
[1:01:40] the most important thing is to make sure
[1:01:42] that you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:44] Ghost in your soul not an
[1:01:47] anointing in your soul because your soul
[1:01:50] will verify what I'm talking about if I
[1:01:53] tell you the truth
[1:01:56] by an amen or an OM me one of the two
[1:01:59] that's right that means this book can't
[1:02:00] be revealed to anyone but a special
[1:02:03] class of people amen that's us it will
[1:02:06] take one with prophetic Insight in other
[1:02:08] words we had to have a Prophet come to
[1:02:10] open the word up so that we could step
[1:02:12] into that same prophecy come on
[1:02:15] somebody and we grab the mind of God
[1:02:18] just like he
[1:02:19] did amen I've always believed when
[1:02:22] brother said let's go back in the back
[1:02:24] part of God's mind there in Christ
[1:02:25] mystery G reveal it didn't close when he
[1:02:27] left the mind of God he brought that
[1:02:29] mind and give it to each and every one
[1:02:31] of us and you and I have access to the
[1:02:33] very mind of God the very thoughts of
[1:02:37] God
[1:02:38] right it will require the ability to
[1:02:40] hear from
[1:02:42] God it will require Supernatural
[1:02:45] instruction not just a student can BR
[1:02:47] verse with verse though that's good
[1:02:50] listen sometimes it's good to go to
[1:02:52] school all right but you got to what
[1:02:55] apply
[1:02:56] what that teacher's teaching you or like
[1:02:58] brother John said it does us no good to
[1:03:01] sit and listen and listen unless it what
[1:03:03] comes back this way or shows up in your
[1:03:06] life
[1:03:07] somewhere that's
[1:03:09] right but a mystery requires the
[1:03:12] teaching of the spirit didn't say
[1:03:15] word
[1:03:17] written the teaching of the word by the
[1:03:20] spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[1:03:22] need to hear from God to lay oursel open
[1:03:24] and become yielded to the spirit
[1:03:26] to hear and to know Isaiah 28:9 Whom
[1:03:31] Shall he teach knowledge now we want the
[1:03:33] knowledge of God right we the knowledge
[1:03:34] of the world's okay listen folks kids go
[1:03:37] to school right get a
[1:03:41] degree you'll struggle if you
[1:03:45] don't don't think you can figure this
[1:03:47] thing
[1:03:47] out cuz in the age we're living in you
[1:03:50] got to have something above your high
[1:03:52] school education or you're going to
[1:03:54] struggle all your life
[1:03:56] right but remember when I was growing up
[1:04:00] Janet different ones
[1:04:01] Jo pulling kids out at 16 years old cuz
[1:04:04] brother Ram said education was of the
[1:04:07] devil well that was the devil telling
[1:04:09] him that because brother R never said
[1:04:10] that he said education was of the if we
[1:04:12] lean to that education that's of the
[1:04:15] devil cuz his kids went to school they
[1:04:16] went to
[1:04:18] college but see there's those fact
[1:04:20] checkers
[1:04:26] that's all they did when the flood
[1:04:32] came I promise you you open your mouth
[1:04:35] underwater you going
[1:04:38] drown praise the Lord that's pretty good
[1:04:41] one and Whom Shall he make to understand
[1:04:44] Doctrine now who them that are weaned
[1:04:46] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[1:04:49] in other words you're not still on Mama
[1:04:51] right now folks if you're over about 10
[1:04:54] 12 Liv n I'm just going somewhere but
[1:04:57] all of us know what that means we're
[1:04:59] eating food
[1:05:01] today I like a little milk had some
[1:05:06] yesterday but I also had some real nice
[1:05:09] pork chops that Jun made man they were
[1:05:11] good but that was meat cuz we're meat
[1:05:13] eaters we're we're
[1:05:15] Eagles we love fresh meat we don't like
[1:05:17] meat that's been held
[1:05:20] over so it's a requirement that we have
[1:05:23] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:05:25] EV angelist I am not here to promote my
[1:05:30] office God promoted our
[1:05:33] office if we're God called people God
[1:05:36] said this is how you're going to get it
[1:05:38] I didn't and some people get mad at
[1:05:41] brother brandom they say well he well
[1:05:43] the Bible said it way before he even was
[1:05:45] born that's right God inspired a man
[1:05:48] named Paul to write that in about ad50
[1:05:53] something way a long time ago way
[1:05:56] before anybody was born here in the
[1:06:00] room oh I was going back to that fact
[1:06:03] Checkers you know Noah how was he when
[1:06:06] the flood happened he was in his
[1:06:08] hundreds right right he he died at like
[1:06:11] 600 or something like that they were
[1:06:13] people that I'm sure they went up to
[1:06:15] Noah and said Noah I'm 800 years old
[1:06:18] this ain't never
[1:06:20] happened everybody with me I mean
[1:06:22] there's a lot of people that that live
[1:06:24] way back years years 6 700 years Noah
[1:06:27] this has not ever been
[1:06:29] taught but he was right and what he said
[1:06:34] came to pass so who was the naysayer him
[1:06:38] or
[1:06:39] them this thing's going to come down to
[1:06:43] where if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:46] you're going to be deceived yes and
[1:06:49] you'll go off into a deception and
[1:06:51] you'll never be able to get back I'm
[1:06:54] sorry
[1:06:55] right go to God of this evil Age and and
[1:06:57] uh anointed ones at the end time when
[1:06:59] you
[1:07:01] read sir what is the
[1:07:04] time that's right what is it for is for
[1:07:07] perfecting of all of us I have to have a
[1:07:10] five-fold Ministry so do y'all I love it
[1:07:13] when people like brother Burley brings
[1:07:14] wisdom like he did Sunday and walked
[1:07:17] right down some people's path that he
[1:07:19] didn't know one
[1:07:21] word you know I told him I told him um
[1:07:26] brother K I said you know people are
[1:07:28] they really we really get surprised at
[1:07:31] the supernatural we should not
[1:07:33] be we should not be surprised as
[1:07:36] Supernatural we're Supernatural people
[1:07:38] if you got a problem you had talked to
[1:07:40] me about it you had talk to the preacher
[1:07:42] about it and he comes right here and
[1:07:43] runs right down your aisle and tells you
[1:07:46] your problem and tells you how to fix it
[1:07:48] now that ain't the devil cuz he wants
[1:07:49] you to keep it that ain't the preacher
[1:07:52] cuz he didn't know that was God almighty
[1:07:56] that came that day to help everything
[1:07:57] that you
[1:07:59] needed you say I've never been close to
[1:08:01] God you'll never be no closer to God
[1:08:03] than we gives you a revelation or gives
[1:08:05] you a way to get out of some
[1:08:07] situation that's a God I serve he's not
[1:08:10] somewhere up there he's right here you
[1:08:13] brought him with
[1:08:16] you for the perfecting of the Saints for
[1:08:20] the work of the ministry for the
[1:08:21] edifying of the body of Christ right
[1:08:24] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:08:25] Faith so we got to keep preaching till
[1:08:27] everybody comes to Perfection all right
[1:08:28] or completion you say well you ain't
[1:08:31] perfect I ain't perfect I'm not but I
[1:08:32] serve a perfect God that lives inside of
[1:08:35] me so he can't become imperfect as he's
[1:08:39] coming into
[1:08:41] me
[1:08:42] huh he's still
[1:08:45] perfect and this transition that we're
[1:08:47] transitioning is to let him out and let
[1:08:50] him do his work cuz that's the only way
[1:08:52] we're going to get out of here is to let
[1:08:53] him do his work through to
[1:08:56] us there's not some Supernatural
[1:08:58] spaceship going to come and bring us
[1:09:00] something get us out of here right we
[1:09:02] got to understand what we're talking
[1:09:03] about now spaceship will come pick us up
[1:09:06] that's all right with me but you better
[1:09:09] be ready to go cuz if you ain't have a
[1:09:11] body change you'll die right till we all
[1:09:14] come to the unity of faith of the
[1:09:15] knowledge of the Son of God into a
[1:09:16] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:09:18] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:09:20] we henceforth be no more
[1:09:23] children tossed to and fro
[1:09:26] what devil
[1:09:28] list toss to and fro you got rid of them
[1:09:32] today you ain't
[1:09:33] tossed you see I got a problem now tell
[1:09:37] God say hey I know you're here I want to
[1:09:40] get rid of
[1:09:41] this you know what you don't have to
[1:09:43] have this great
[1:09:45] aura you don't have to have like
[1:09:47] fireworks going off um you just believe
[1:09:51] God cuz remember this thing is a secret
[1:09:54] it's an end individual affair with God
[1:09:57] now you're going to show it as I read
[1:09:58] that where if you got God in your soul
[1:10:00] you're going to let It Shine by your
[1:10:01] face that's our problem sometimes is we
[1:10:03] don't have God in our soul and we
[1:10:06] can't smile
[1:10:09] right we henceforth be no more children
[1:10:12] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:10:13] every wind of Doctrine by what by the
[1:10:15] slight of
[1:10:18] preachers right by the slight of false
[1:10:22] Doctrine cunning craftiness is taking
[1:10:24] you away from from
[1:10:26] God whereby they lie and wait to
[1:10:30] deceive you know the Bible tells us that
[1:10:33] in the end time that there will be
[1:10:35] wolves come to you and sheep's
[1:10:38] clothing
[1:10:40] right do you know there had to be a lamb
[1:10:42] die before they could do
[1:10:44] that and they're professing that that
[1:10:48] lamb died for them but I'm going to tell
[1:10:50] you something you hang around that joker
[1:10:52] long
[1:10:53] enough wolves don't smell like
[1:10:56] sheep wolves don't talk like
[1:10:58] sheep wolves are wolves sooner or later
[1:11:01] the stench is going to come out and
[1:11:03] you'll know who they are because
[1:11:04] everything's going to be exposed here in
[1:11:06] the end time we know
[1:11:10] that hey hello but speaking the truth
[1:11:14] what in love in love okay by speaking
[1:11:18] the truth in love it woke some of them
[1:11:20] up
[1:11:21] by somebody sat their alarm for 5
[1:11:24] minutes from now
[1:11:28] not a bad idea Brother Anderson put that
[1:11:33] up put that on the uh
[1:11:38] speaker I haven't said wake up in a long
[1:11:40] time have I have I done that I done a
[1:11:42] long
[1:11:43] time I should have but by speaking
[1:11:47] speaking the truth and love may grow up
[1:11:49] into him so you got to hear the gospel
[1:11:53] to grow all right eagle food you got to
[1:11:55] eat Eagle food now listen the eagle
[1:11:57] stayed in the barnyard for a little
[1:11:58] while but remember he still was an eagle
[1:12:01] and he when he heard the Cry of the mama
[1:12:04] Eagle he knew her cry not the
[1:12:08] cluck so that's what's happening to you
[1:12:10] and I now this is What dra us not to
[1:12:12] Lula church but this is what Drew you to
[1:12:14] the message you heard from Mama Eagle
[1:12:17] you heard from
[1:12:18] something that was different than
[1:12:20] anybody else or I did
[1:12:26] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:12:28] up into him in all things which is the
[1:12:31] head even
[1:12:33] Christ and brother Brown tells us it's a
[1:12:37] requirement yes these wasn't required
[1:12:40] what these were required but he brought
[1:12:42] his church up the same way his church up
[1:12:44] the same way he's bringing his people up
[1:12:46] all right what through justification
[1:12:48] sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost
[1:12:51] then Peter said give you the Seven
[1:12:52] Virtues the Holy Ghost Christ in the
[1:12:54] person of the Holy and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:57] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[1:12:59] the Holy Ghost and you get all these
[1:13:00] virtues sealed in you these here behind
[1:13:02] we we believe in growth development and
[1:13:04] that's the only way to get it all
[1:13:07] right then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:13:11] call the building not this building here
[1:13:14] this building here call the building the
[1:13:17] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:13:20] Dwelling Place when a man possesses
[1:13:23] these kind I want to be possessed amen
[1:13:25] amen you know we get away from people
[1:13:26] that say I'm possessed or like that
[1:13:28] woman that had to don't make a witch mad
[1:13:30] if she was possessed I don't want that
[1:13:32] kind of possession that's right but I do
[1:13:34] want to be possessed of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:37] possessed with these virtues brother
[1:13:38] rown said when a man possesses these
[1:13:40] kind of things now watch then the Holy
[1:13:42] Ghost comes upon him now watch navigates
[1:13:44] listen to me a minute he he helps you to
[1:13:47] navigate there's two things and I'm
[1:13:50] going to try to weave this into the to
[1:13:52] the sermon that we're going to do in in
[1:13:54] a few weeks at
[1:13:55] Methodist Church but remember when you
[1:13:58] become a
[1:13:59] Christian you're still going to have
[1:14:02] problems probably even more because
[1:14:04] you're going to be persecuted you going
[1:14:06] to have to change your
[1:14:08] ways but what a change it is it will
[1:14:11] take me to my body chain if you don't
[1:14:13] change it's going to take you to a grave
[1:14:15] and it's going to take you into hell
[1:14:16] sorry we still believe in
[1:14:18] Hell
[1:14:20] okay but if you're a Christian today you
[1:14:23] will know how to navigate through that
[1:14:26] problem if you're B listen if you're
[1:14:28] born again Holy Ghost filled God is
[1:14:30] obligated to help you than you Lord
[1:14:34] obligated to help you help you through
[1:14:37] that amen so you're going to have
[1:14:39] problems Christians new Christians
[1:14:40] you're going have problems but you're
[1:14:42] going to know where to get your
[1:14:44] information where to get rid of about 11
[1:14:46] of them demons every day for you or

[1:17:18] my mind about 24 years ago hopefully
[1:17:22] tried to get the mind of
[1:17:23] Christ it'll make you talk different act
[1:17:26] different look at things different it
[1:17:28] just make you different listen when
[1:17:30] Jesus himself was on Earth they thought
[1:17:32] he was
[1:17:33] crazy they called him the chief of
[1:17:37] demons they said you're a wine bibber
[1:17:40] you eat too much you hang around Sinners
[1:17:42] and prostitutes what's your problem Oh
[1:17:45] and listen you don't wash your hands
[1:17:47] before you eat
[1:17:48] either well I don't
[1:17:52] always but Jesus didn't
[1:17:58] man he was only
[1:18:00] known after the day of Pentecost the way
[1:18:03] he was supposed to be
[1:18:05] known even Peter J all them they were
[1:18:08] standing there looking at where you
[1:18:10] going to restore the kingdom hey you
[1:18:11] come back down here you're not finished
[1:18:14] they missed it all right but praise God
[1:18:16] those two angels that stood there and
[1:18:17] said look that same
[1:18:20] Jesus that same Jesus that you see going
[1:18:23] away in a cloud he's going to come back
[1:18:25] in a cloud and he's going to come to a
[1:18:28] group of people and he's going to
[1:18:30] inhabit that group of people and then
[1:18:32] he's going to take them
[1:18:33] home praise God I just believe that 100%
[1:18:37] or I wouldn't be standing here
[1:18:40] today I'm heading out to go to Kentucky
[1:18:42] to do a little Coy hunting I I just
[1:18:45] leave right now here let's go
[1:18:48] no I'm
[1:18:50] compelled to finish what I'm going to
[1:18:52] say am
[1:18:55] but until these virtues here get into
[1:18:56] you you're still off the real true
[1:18:59] foundation of Faith all Christianity is
[1:19:02] based on faith
[1:19:03] folks listen we believe to
[1:19:06] see we don't have to see to believe
[1:19:10] nobody sitting here saw Jesus hanging on
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:13] cross nobody here saw him Ascend nobody
[1:19:17] saw him here come back but I see him
[1:19:20] every day and every person that has the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] right amen right so that makes me a
[1:19:30] Believer and I believe he's coming back
[1:19:33] for a group of people he's not going to
[1:19:35] leave us he even told us he said I'm not
[1:19:37] going to leave you comfortless I'm going
[1:19:38] to send you a comforter that's right but
[1:19:40] he didn't stop there he said I'm going
[1:19:43] to send you a comforter is going to what
[1:19:44] tell you things to come amen but when
[1:19:48] these virtues grow in you and you add
[1:19:50] that to that then you're a living
[1:19:52] Monument you're a living moving
[1:19:57] Idol you know
[1:20:00] everybody everybody in the whole Bible
[1:20:02] even
[1:20:03] Noah had a
[1:20:05] flaw he died a
[1:20:08] drunk okay Abraham gave his wife away
[1:20:14] twice laughed at
[1:20:16] God Samson had women
[1:20:20] problems Rahab was a harlot she knew
[1:20:24] about everybody mail in in the whole
[1:20:25] city of Jericho hello
[1:20:28] somebody but yet God chose to come right
[1:20:30] through
[1:20:31] that to get
[1:20:34] here come on look at
[1:20:37] Paul Paul was having Christians
[1:20:39] killed but he was getting ready to be
[1:20:41] the most powerful agent that God used to
[1:20:44] begin the church
[1:20:47] ages Peter would you pick him as a
[1:20:50] poster boy for
[1:20:52] Christianity a naked Fisher that
[1:20:56] cured that's what he was right he denied
[1:21:01] God
[1:21:03] lied had a
[1:21:05] temper but God used him to tell us about
[1:21:08] these virtues because you know what when
[1:21:09] they got birthed inside of him he knew
[1:21:12] it and when him him knowing it listen
[1:21:15] the only thing I can tell you today is
[1:21:16] what I
[1:21:17] know I'd just be presuming as a prophet
[1:21:20] of God said I'd be presuming if I didn't
[1:21:23] he knew where he was that he knew when
[1:21:26] no seals broke and we're going to look
[1:21:27] at it later on he knew when no seals
[1:21:30] broke that was
[1:21:31] it that was man had never seen that
[1:21:34] before we'll get to that in just a
[1:21:36] second cuz remember we talked
[1:21:41] about we talked about the White Rock and
[1:21:44] to some people it's going to be a little
[1:21:45] bit strange but we'll work up to it so
[1:21:49] now look remembering the Lord 1963 this
[1:21:51] is after he preached the tatue perfect
[1:21:53] man let's remember what he required not
[1:21:56] what we think we ought to
[1:21:58] have remember I told you what's your
[1:22:00] biggest problem when you start a
[1:22:02] conversation that says I
[1:22:06] thought you lose every
[1:22:09] time it's not what you thought it's what
[1:22:12] he said
[1:22:13] amen that's why I'm not standing up here
[1:22:15] trying to beat people to come to church
[1:22:18] God told you to
[1:22:21] come you can you can throw it off on Old
[1:22:24] me if you want to but God told you to
[1:22:26] come to church God through a prophet
[1:22:29] made sure you got here 30 minutes before
[1:22:33] service oh we don't believe that but we
[1:22:35] believe he open the seals if he believe
[1:22:37] he open the seals then you'll do
[1:22:39] that oh don't get
[1:22:41] quiet the truth that's what I said about
[1:22:43] there's a purpose behind everything to
[1:22:45] shed those demons get
[1:22:48] here pray read your Bible get your mind
[1:22:52] on God get it off that you had that
[1:22:55] fight when you came up here with the
[1:22:56] kids or came up here with your husband I
[1:22:59] know ain't one of y'all ever done
[1:23:01] that sister Jessica what you smiled
[1:23:06] about it was this morning she
[1:23:09] said no I'm just
[1:23:12] kidding they both they both have stop
[1:23:16] sign faces they're
[1:23:19] red I'm sorry but it does happen though
[1:23:22] you it does every well Chris going yeah
[1:23:24] brother Chris said
[1:23:27] yeah I might give brother Chris a rose
[1:23:29] he's grown more than than than then a
[1:23:32] lot of people come to the church he has
[1:23:34] grown in in the Lord and I sure do
[1:23:36] appreciate him appreciate the
[1:23:38] family and if I didn't if I have known
[1:23:41] he was going to maybe when if I said
[1:23:42] this a year ago or so when they started
[1:23:43] coming he probably would have fell
[1:23:45] out but you grow up a little
[1:23:48] bit but we've all had that sit every
[1:23:50] situation I gave you every one of you's
[1:23:52] been through
[1:23:53] that so now you know how to handle it
[1:23:56] work your way through it come on to
[1:23:58] church June and I we've had arguments
[1:24:02] before or
[1:24:06] more but I put my hand up on that thing
[1:24:09] where it says at the top you remember
[1:24:11] who preached that sermon brother Daryl
[1:24:14] Warden many many years
[1:24:16] ago he went into the Tennessee football
[1:24:18] stadium and they let him go into the
[1:24:19] back and there's a there's a thing like
[1:24:21] that door with double doors and it and
[1:24:24] then they slapped it and went out to the
[1:24:25] ball field it says today I give my all
[1:24:28] to Tennessee football well why in the
[1:24:31] world can't we give our All to Jesus
[1:24:32] Christ if you didn't notice that it's on
[1:24:34] the back side of that
[1:24:35] door and one other demon leaves is when
[1:24:38] my shoulder gets sore I just reach up
[1:24:39] and touch up and come on in this room
[1:24:42] you say you're crazy preacher amen I'm
[1:24:44] crazy I just believe the demons are
[1:24:47] real but God's more real than they
[1:24:50] are he created them jokers and they the
[1:24:53] one that turned him down
[1:24:55] Satan can't create remember God created
[1:24:58] those angels they just listen to a
[1:25:01] lie are we all right let's remember that
[1:25:04] he required not what we think we ought
[1:25:06] to have but what he said we've got to
[1:25:09] have see we got to have it that way the
[1:25:12] way that he said it amen if it's your
[1:25:16] opinion then it's your
[1:25:17] opinion but opinions like noses what
[1:25:20] everybody's got one so let's look at
[1:25:23] this new conduct this new ministry cuz
[1:25:25] brother random is getting ready to enter
[1:25:26] in to a new ministry everybody with me
[1:25:30] this is where I was going to stop and do
[1:25:31] this so that's how far down the road I
[1:25:33] was if demonology go read those books
[1:25:35] those small books demonology books
[1:25:37] brother R explains a lot what goes on in
[1:25:39] another realm you know what we're not
[1:25:41] alone we're not alone when man says
[1:25:44] there's flying saucers and all that
[1:25:46] stuff that's okay fine with me they just
[1:25:48] don't know brother R says they're
[1:25:49] investigating
[1:25:52] Angels that's right why don't we have
[1:25:54] technology that can keep up with them
[1:25:56] you can't have technology of
[1:25:58] God we
[1:26:01] do cuz remember we're going to travel
[1:26:03] like a thought right right so this new
[1:26:07] conduct this new ministry this
[1:26:09] transition from from imperfection to
[1:26:12] Perfection or from partial understanding
[1:26:14] to per perfect understanding number one
[1:26:17] we got to do is and I think brother
[1:26:18] Chris preached this a long time ago you
[1:26:20] got to know who your enemy is that's
[1:26:23] right study his tactics don't get
[1:26:26] involved with
[1:26:27] him but study his tactics his tactics
[1:26:31] was is what I just said how many times
[1:26:33] has he said you really don't have to go
[1:26:35] to church today you just Mash a button
[1:26:36] and watch it online well God don't God
[1:26:39] ain't into
[1:26:44] buttons God's into
[1:26:47] Overcomers every time you
[1:26:50] overcome that's one Mark against the
[1:26:53] devil that's right have you ever come to
[1:26:56] church and had a bad
[1:26:59] time I'm looking you ever come to church
[1:27:01] and had a bad
[1:27:04] time W you ought to try it
[1:27:08] sometime now watch brother random now
[1:27:10] look he's going into a new ministry what
[1:27:13] did the angel tell him that was going to
[1:27:17] be this new purpose or this new ministry
[1:27:20] how to get there all right everybody
[1:27:23] with me just a few minutes
[1:27:25] right how'd he tell
[1:27:28] him if you'll continue to be
[1:27:32] sincere and
[1:27:34] humble can y'all read that it'll grow
[1:27:38] greater and
[1:27:39] greater and now this ministry is going
[1:27:42] to step higher now into another realm
[1:27:45] where it'll be far beyond what it is now
[1:27:49] do you believe that amen I believe that
[1:27:51] transition to Perfection started in 19
[1:27:54] 58 different he started in 56 said he
[1:27:56] was going to have a new ministry but
[1:27:57] like I said before he thought it was
[1:27:59] going to be something great through a
[1:28:00] prayer
[1:28:02] line cuz he had the vision of the tent
[1:28:04] and all that everybody with me I ain't
[1:28:07] getting into the tent Vision but if
[1:28:08] you're waiting on the tent you going you
[1:28:10] going to be here long long longer than I
[1:28:12] am praise sorry but he saw the prayer
[1:28:17] line going through and people were
[1:28:19] healed or are restored okay you can make
[1:28:23] it whatever you want
[1:28:25] to but I don't need a
[1:28:27] tent I don't need a physical tent to get
[1:28:31] healed the Bible did not tell us to get
[1:28:34] in a tent to get
[1:28:36] healed it didn't say get in a tent and
[1:28:39] be saved it said believe on the Lord
[1:28:42] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:28:44] saved the only T I'm worried about is
[1:28:46] this one and you better be worried about
[1:28:49] your tent
[1:28:54] if you'll continue to be sincere and
[1:28:58] humble that's my
[1:29:00] prayer and this new part that we're
[1:29:02] coming to more sincere and humble than
[1:29:06] ever
[1:29:09] before we don't have to pay for
[1:29:11] it don't cost you a
[1:29:14] dime what it does it requires you to
[1:29:18] overcome what you did
[1:29:21] before brother brandom be more sincere
[1:29:24] and humble that was the most humble
[1:29:26] sincere man ever walked to face of the
[1:29:28] Earth but but but God knew there was a
[1:29:30] part of him that wasn't oh come on
[1:29:33] somebody he was human he was not
[1:29:37] God he had human emotions human problems
[1:29:40] just like we do but like I said before
[1:29:42] we know why I handle it and also I
[1:29:44] forgot to tell you the second one the
[1:29:46] second one is as I've told you many
[1:29:47] times before and I wrote in my Bible
[1:29:48] right here tragedy defines a Christian
[1:29:51] does it destroy him so if you have a
[1:29:53] tragedy in your life and you're not a
[1:29:54] Christian it will destroy your
[1:29:57] life I've seen it
[1:29:59] happen but Christians know how to handle
[1:30:02] it they know where to go to they know
[1:30:04] the power of God they know they can go
[1:30:06] to God they know they've got a support
[1:30:08] group right here and they know they're
[1:30:09] not
[1:30:11] lonely so it defines who you are did
[1:30:15] job we had never known about Job brother
[1:30:19] Alex if he hadn't went through
[1:30:21] problems cuz there was billions of
[1:30:23] people on earth at that time oh
[1:30:26] yeah God just happened to
[1:30:29] say have you considered my servant
[1:30:32] job hey devil devil said I can't even
[1:30:36] get close to him it's like a hot poker
[1:30:37] over there you got this Holy Ghost um
[1:30:41] Veil around that man and I can't touch
[1:30:42] him God said well you know what God
[1:30:45] could have said he said yeah you got
[1:30:46] that right buddy leave me alone that's
[1:30:47] not what he
[1:30:48] said he said okay I'm just going to lift
[1:30:51] that off of him a man that had millions
[1:30:54] of dollars come on people he had houses
[1:30:57] he had children he had land he had
[1:31:00] cattle that you couldn't number he had a
[1:31:02] good
[1:31:06] wife and he was Sting back
[1:31:10] pretty and God is the one that put the
[1:31:14] devil on
[1:31:17] him he said take everything he's got but
[1:31:20] don't take his life oh praise God he can
[1:31:24] do that to me and you cuz Satan can
[1:31:26] never take your life God's the only one
[1:31:28] that can take your life he's the only
[1:31:30] one who can give it he's the only one
[1:31:30] who can take it I just believe that 100%
[1:31:33] Satan can do whatever he wants to to any
[1:31:35] of us he can't kill
[1:31:38] us not until God's finished with us and
[1:31:41] when he's finished with a Christian he
[1:31:43] takes him over in a good place praise
[1:31:46] God for that I'm glad God sent Paul and
[1:31:48] the prophet across the curtain of town
[1:31:50] to tell us what's over there cuz man has
[1:31:52] probed it all these different things
[1:31:54] down oh they're at the feet of Jesus No
[1:31:56] Nonsense they're floating on a cloud
[1:31:58] playing a
[1:31:59] heart or a
[1:32:01] cello it'd be hard to get on the cloud I
[1:32:05] told her I said why don't you play
[1:32:06] something
[1:32:07] small when she rolls that thing it's
[1:32:09] like rolling a person
[1:32:11] in you've seen the
[1:32:15] case but we don't do that we know we're
[1:32:17] not going to play a heart we know we're
[1:32:18] not we're not there listen those people
[1:32:20] in the sixth Dimension are not even at
[1:32:21] the feet of Jesus right right
[1:32:24] right brother Brown said he said where's
[1:32:27] Jesus and angel said a little higher
[1:32:29] what he's in another
[1:32:31] dimension but this Dimension is
[1:32:33] fine stay right here brother BR said
[1:32:37] whatever you do don't miss that he
[1:32:39] didn't say don't miss my next sermon he
[1:32:42] said don't miss that that's what you
[1:32:44] don't want to miss and I'm telling you
[1:32:46] today that you don't want to
[1:32:48] miss now watch you we're talking about
[1:32:51] new it'll be in a new ministry this Min
[1:32:52] now watch this ministry will never cease
[1:32:54] the ministry that we've been under will
[1:32:56] never
[1:32:57] cease God is not an Indian giver he
[1:33:00] doesn't give you something and take it
[1:33:01] back where God gives gifts he never
[1:33:03] takes gifts
[1:33:05] away your gifts remain but if you be
[1:33:08] honest with what you got God will take
[1:33:10] other talents and just keep pouring them
[1:33:14] on I like that he'll keep pouring them
[1:33:19] on if you just keep climbing on
[1:33:24] he's always done it like in Luther
[1:33:26] Wesley the Pentecost on and on there's
[1:33:28] no limit to
[1:33:30] it everybody all
[1:33:32] right so brother Bown said oh this new
[1:33:35] ministry it's not in zerma so he's
[1:33:37] getting he's getting a revelation that
[1:33:39] it's not going to be greater in the
[1:33:40] prayer line cuz he's already telling
[1:33:43] them the thoughts and intents of the
[1:33:44] heart I mean you used to hold them by
[1:33:46] the hand remember and the hand would
[1:33:48] have bumps on it right then he would say
[1:33:50] let's pray and then he said sister you
[1:33:52] still got it let's pray again he said
[1:33:54] sister you don't have it cuz look at my
[1:33:55] hand my hand's fine right but he came to
[1:33:58] a place to where he looked at him and he
[1:33:59] said look he said I see you I see you w
[1:34:03] what about that I see you in a doctor's
[1:34:05] office now they ain't but the doctor and
[1:34:06] that person in that office back then
[1:34:08] they wasn't hidden cameras well there
[1:34:11] was called God but uh cuz he knows
[1:34:15] everything but he said I see he's got on
[1:34:17] a a a blue coat he's got a a tablet in
[1:34:21] his hand he's wearing glasses I mean he
[1:34:23] just sees this thing so
[1:34:26] vivid then you see that one girl this
[1:34:28] one was one that that really got me is
[1:34:31] how your life influences you remember
[1:34:33] what brother R said he told that one
[1:34:35] sister he he she couldn't get over
[1:34:37] something she couldn't get over
[1:34:38] something she kept going she go to
[1:34:39] psychiatrist she go to the doctor she go
[1:34:41] everywhere she came to brother brandom
[1:34:43] brother Bram said oh I see when you
[1:34:47] were I see when you were a little child
[1:34:50] you got scared by a
[1:34:52] dog come on somebody you got scared by a
[1:34:55] dog and that makes you nervous now
[1:34:57] around anything like that he drug that
[1:35:00] right out of her and he said demon you
[1:35:02] can leave now and that demon left and
[1:35:05] the girl was okay but she'd went to all
[1:35:07] kind of doctors well they they probably
[1:35:10] she probably didn't even tell them that
[1:35:12] she got scared by a dog when she was a
[1:35:13] little girl
[1:35:16] remember what a mighty God we serve what
[1:35:19] we got in this day folks people since
[1:35:21] the dawn of time have wanted to see this
[1:35:23] day right here all the prophets in the
[1:35:26] Old Testament wanted to see their word
[1:35:28] become manifest and you and I are seeing
[1:35:30] it
[1:35:32] today so the new ministry the second
[1:35:35] Ministry is leaving the third is
[1:35:36] entering in so I'm glad about it so what
[1:35:39] is the what is the third part of his
[1:35:42] ministry it's going to be the opening of
[1:35:44] The Seven Seals something that man has
[1:35:46] never seen
[1:35:49] before now
[1:35:51] watch I remember brother Jackson we'll
[1:35:54] be done in just a second he is usually
[1:35:56] with us brother Junior Jackson the
[1:35:57] Methodist was a Methodist Minister here
[1:35:59] he is sitting here now he had a dream
[1:36:01] everybody with me be with me just for a
[1:36:03] second wake
[1:36:05] up maybe we need to start sprinkling a
[1:36:07] little bit maybe
[1:36:12] we deacons get some ice water
[1:36:16] ready so he had a
[1:36:18] dream now remember brother randam tells
[1:36:20] us being a prophet he doesn't inter a
[1:36:24] dream until he sees
[1:36:26] it see you can tell me a dream and say
[1:36:29] what do you think I'll just tell you
[1:36:31] what I
[1:36:32] think cuz I wasn't there but brother
[1:36:35] Brandon God showed him the exact Vision
[1:36:38] or the dream that the person had right
[1:36:41] that way they don't leave anything out
[1:36:42] they don't leave a part that they didn't
[1:36:43] want to talk about it's everything so he
[1:36:46] saw this Vision now
[1:36:49] watch then some more Brethren came up
[1:36:52] they had similar dreams now the Lord is
[1:36:53] been real good to me and I have never
[1:36:55] take you to record this morning have I
[1:36:57] ever told you a wrong interpretation of
[1:37:00] a dream because I'll not speak of it
[1:37:02] till I see it over
[1:37:06] again all right and know what he says
[1:37:09] about it then I'll tell
[1:37:11] you so
[1:37:15] watch he told me the
[1:37:17] dream like in Indiana there was a long
[1:37:20] great grassy Hill the water had washed
[1:37:22] all the soil off the the top and it
[1:37:24] became a rock like a ball top on the
[1:37:26] mountain kind of like a
[1:37:28] pyramid and then in this rock there was
[1:37:32] funny writing okay everybody with me
[1:37:34] shake yourself just for a second and
[1:37:37] said I was standing there with all the
[1:37:38] Brethren around the church interpreting
[1:37:41] this writing now that's brother brandom
[1:37:43] interpreting what's on the outside
[1:37:46] everybody with me interpreting the
[1:37:49] outside what's written on the outsides
[1:37:51] like you would see that on the outside
[1:37:53] of this pyramid Rock there was inscribed
[1:37:56] words and he was interpreting that to
[1:37:59] the brothers everybody with me and I was
[1:38:01] standing there with all the Brethren
[1:38:02] around the church interpreting this
[1:38:04] writing in other words giving us to
[1:38:05] right correct water baptism giving us no
[1:38:07] eternal hell and all those different
[1:38:09] doctrines that we're supposed to build
[1:38:11] on but then go to something else all
[1:38:14] right or go higher not something else
[1:38:16] and then when it come to the time I got
[1:38:19] all of it
[1:38:20] interpreted all right
[1:38:23] then somehow or another if I understand
[1:38:25] the dream right I got a hold of
[1:38:26] something like a crowbar or an angle bar
[1:38:29] or something or not an angle bar I me a
[1:38:31] pry bar everybody knows what a pry bar
[1:38:33] is it's got a hook on it and you pry the
[1:38:34] thing off and just cut the top of that
[1:38:37] mountain out and lifted it up now watch
[1:38:40] and on the inside of it was White Rock
[1:38:43] something on the order of granite or
[1:38:45] something on that side some White Rock
[1:38:47] that wasn't written on now watch hang on
[1:38:49] a minute that wasn't written on and I
[1:38:51] said to the Brethren stay here and look
[1:38:53] on this this now remember there was
[1:38:54] nothing for them to
[1:38:56] see hold
[1:38:58] on and while they were looking I slipped
[1:39:02] out from among them and started going
[1:39:05] west and brother Jackson said that he
[1:39:08] saw me going over one Hill another Hill
[1:39:10] getting smaller and smaller going west
[1:39:11] you remember that now we find out I told
[1:39:14] you the interpretation on the Rock and
[1:39:16] the rock is Christ and that was in the
[1:39:18] brother's dream and that's the Bible and
[1:39:20] for all these years the Bible has been
[1:39:22] interpreted what till we've absolutely
[1:39:24] got it the the
[1:39:26] ecclesiastical interpretation through
[1:39:29] right all right in other words the
[1:39:30] truths are being known they've been
[1:39:32] known through his message but that's not
[1:39:34] all of his
[1:39:37] message and the last gift being added in
[1:39:40] the loudest in age which is here which
[1:39:42] is the seventh Angel's time to preach in
[1:39:45] the loudest in age at that time that
[1:39:48] there would be a lot of things that was
[1:39:50] misconstrued down Through the Ages like
[1:39:53] Luther preaching justification but he
[1:39:55] let it run wild CU he didn't live long
[1:39:57] enough they organized it Luther never
[1:39:59] organized it after Luther Wesley did the
[1:40:02] same thing John Smith for the Baptist
[1:40:05] Alexander Campbell but they were
[1:40:07] reformers they didn't live long enough
[1:40:08] to get it all together a lot of these
[1:40:10] Loose Ends we know what loose ends are
[1:40:12] that's false interpretation of the word
[1:40:14] of God all right water baptism he goes
[1:40:16] through all that and now after the Bible
[1:40:18] had been interpreted completely now
[1:40:20] watch then you notice it opened at the
[1:40:23] top of the pyramid like
[1:40:25] rock everybody with
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:29] me not pyramid teaching now that's a
[1:40:31] bunch of garbage and I know it is too I
[1:40:34] know nothing about it it was the shape
[1:40:35] of a pyramid but the cap on the pyramid
[1:40:37] was never put on I've been in Egypt and
[1:40:40] the cap was never on it because it was a
[1:40:43] Cornerstone this was a
[1:40:46] headstone Cornerstone when you get
[1:40:48] started that's right down here you
[1:40:49] Foundation you get your foundation
[1:40:50] started right here then you build up and
[1:40:52] you that thing is actually this right
[1:40:55] here that's holding the thing up
[1:40:57] everybody with me just for a second
[1:40:59] Don't Lose
[1:41:01] Yourself now watch in the church it was
[1:41:03] the Cornerstone the
[1:41:05] church all right the church back in the
[1:41:07] ages it was the
[1:41:09] Cornerstone you know there's couple of
[1:41:11] Christian singers got a couple of songs
[1:41:12] out now and they talk about the
[1:41:15] Cornerstone they never talk about The
[1:41:17] Headstone cuz they don't have him it's
[1:41:20] it's not to the natural world they know
[1:41:23] Jesus come and they know je there was a
[1:41:25] Jesus died on the cross
[1:41:28] that's but they don't know that he can
[1:41:31] come back and get inside of that
[1:41:34] person so they know of
[1:41:37] him but they don't know him like you and
[1:41:38] I know him so in the church it was a
[1:41:41] Cornerstone in the full Church all right
[1:41:43] you ready in the full church it was a
[1:41:45] headstone so it never did come it was
[1:41:48] rejected Christ and it will come and I
[1:41:52] then I believe that when it's coming
[1:41:54] that the church WIll shape up into a
[1:41:56] place from justification sanctification
[1:41:59] Pentecostal message will bring the
[1:42:00] church to such a
[1:42:03] minority not full buildings
[1:42:05] minority and a ministry will be among
[1:42:08] those people till it be exact same
[1:42:10] Ministry that Jesus Christ did that'll
[1:42:12] bring Jesus and catch the whole thing
[1:42:14] away all right just a few more cuz I
[1:42:16] want I want to ask you a question here
[1:42:18] in just a
[1:42:19] minute now this is the dream again a
[1:42:22] different version and notice the next
[1:42:24] thing now you say what a different
[1:42:25] version listen Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:42:27] John there's four different versions of
[1:42:28] thing of what happened everybody with me
[1:42:31] four different angles of the same it
[1:42:33] didn't change the
[1:42:35] message didn't change Jesus one of them
[1:42:38] saw two Blind Men one of them saw one
[1:42:40] they just wrote it down all right now
[1:42:42] listen just a few
[1:42:43] minutes I took some kind of a bar cut it
[1:42:46] off now
[1:42:48] watch and on the inside was White Rock
[1:42:51] now watch again he said that had nothing
[1:42:53] wrote on
[1:42:54] it you with me had nothing wrote on
[1:42:59] it why did he pull the top off if it was
[1:43:02] nothing
[1:43:04] inside and at that time I started to the
[1:43:06] West remember he had to go west for this
[1:43:08] to happen and for him to come back to
[1:43:10] open the seals and I told them all I
[1:43:12] said don't go out west stay here and
[1:43:15] look on this till I return right in
[1:43:19] other words look on what I've taught you
[1:43:21] already until I come back
[1:43:24] stay here and look on this till I return
[1:43:26] went West for the blast returned back to
[1:43:28] the east with the Holy Spirit
[1:43:31] interpreting this Unwritten
[1:43:37] word now if that is a perfectly the God
[1:43:40] Almighty I want you to know what is I
[1:43:42] want you to know what is what am I
[1:43:44] trying to say this for friends is to
[1:43:46] show you we're at the end time all right
[1:43:49] brother Bram what is the vision he talks
[1:43:51] about the Lord he talks about the Third
[1:43:53] P but I want to ask you a question let's
[1:43:54] get on over
[1:43:56] here we talk about the three pulls a
[1:43:58] little bit later
[1:44:01] on but here the art real
[1:44:07] quick but when he begins to declare his
[1:44:09] message what was his message the
[1:44:11] unwritten part everybody with me it
[1:44:14] wasn't a it wasn't writing a new
[1:44:17] Bible but it was an Unwritten
[1:44:19] word just like the love letter
[1:44:24] all right be everybody with me the first
[1:44:27] pull was healing prayer line Second pull
[1:44:31] he was bringing everything all the Loose
[1:44:33] Ends back he was prophesying about what
[1:44:36] they had in the first church age he was
[1:44:38] bringing it back to this church a
[1:44:39] everybody with me so the third pull the
[1:44:42] opening of the word the Mysteries
[1:44:45] revealed all right which was what the
[1:44:47] unwritten part the White Rock that was
[1:44:50] nothing written on but there had to be
[1:44:52] something or he'd have never pull that
[1:44:53] top
[1:44:54] off all right everybody with me cuz I'm
[1:44:56] getting somewhere real quick and then
[1:44:57] we'll
[1:45:01] close now here's a
[1:45:04] u brother Leo and and brother Jee Mercer
[1:45:07] one of them had another dream it's a
[1:45:08] different but watch what
[1:45:11] happens when the young fellow came to me
[1:45:13] with a dream that he had of a pyramid so
[1:45:15] this is a pyramid again standing up in
[1:45:18] this pyramid and he climbed up to where
[1:45:20] I was at and I was standing out on a SA
[1:45:23] or a plate or something like a light he
[1:45:26] said brother brandham how you get up
[1:45:30] there I said brother Leo God has to put
[1:45:33] a person in this position up here I'm
[1:45:38] saying today Lula Church God's got to
[1:45:40] put you in a position just like
[1:45:43] that separated from everything
[1:45:46] else I said now that you've seen now
[1:45:49] that you've seen return back to the
[1:45:52] people and tell them that you believe
[1:45:55] it's of
[1:45:56] God all
[1:45:59] right so I want to ask you a question
[1:46:03] musicians come
[1:46:04] on where does your Revelation put
[1:46:08] you does your Revelation put you on the
[1:46:10] outside where anybody can read and
[1:46:15] interpret the word of
[1:46:19] God I thought we were a special class of
[1:46:21] people I thought I thought we had to
[1:46:23] have prophetic
[1:46:25] Insight I thought we had to be the
[1:46:27] unwritten
[1:46:29] part so what does your real where does
[1:46:32] it put you on the outside of the pyramid
[1:46:34] or on the inside of the pyramid now
[1:46:36] listen souls in
[1:46:39] prison second pull was the discernment
[1:46:41] of the spirits the prophecy first was
[1:46:44] healing the second was the prophecy that
[1:46:46] went forth and know the secrets of your
[1:46:48] thoughts when the word itself was made
[1:46:50] manifest which that's Grace but but
[1:46:53] remember the seventh is to finish now
[1:46:55] watch Jesus's Ministry cons consisted of
[1:46:57] three polls did you know that notice and
[1:47:00] be sincere if he ever was in your life
[1:47:02] now for a minute his first pull was
[1:47:04] Healing The Sick he became a very
[1:47:07] popular
[1:47:09] man all people love signs and
[1:47:13] wonders but the devil can pass out
[1:47:16] Supernatural gifts so he can get
[1:47:18] involved in this
[1:47:21] hello he is involved in
[1:47:23] this everybody believed him seemed like
[1:47:26] is that right when he went forth Healing
[1:47:28] The Sick everybody wanted him in their
[1:47:30] church but one day he turned around and
[1:47:32] started prophesying for he was the word
[1:47:34] and he was the prophet that Moses spoke
[1:47:36] of and when he went to tell them tell
[1:47:38] them how they were living and the things
[1:47:40] they were doing he became very unpopular
[1:47:43] that was his second pull wonder if that
[1:47:45] types right back just a minute the first
[1:47:47] was healing the second oh it could be
[1:47:49] Jesus only it could be Bel Same Spirit
[1:47:53] living in the same kind of
[1:47:57] people condemning or condemned people
[1:48:01] that can never be saved because they
[1:48:03] were condemned before like Judas born
[1:48:06] the son of
[1:48:10] predition first pull second pull third
[1:48:14] pull let's stand our feet you all have
[1:48:17] that same journey to take
[1:48:20] amen and it's a requirement
[1:48:24] to hear the word of God you can't get it
[1:48:26] for yourself you can get
[1:48:29] pieces amen you can get certain things
[1:48:32] but you can't get it all by I can't get
[1:48:34] it all by
[1:48:35] myself but even brother Brown said Jesus
[1:48:38] had a third pool Ministry Noah had a
[1:48:39] third pool Ministry all people have a
[1:48:42] third pull if you look at them in your
[1:48:45] life even you say well man what about
[1:48:47] the first
[1:48:48] pull well the first pull is
[1:48:50] justification that's when you come to a
[1:48:52] sin that you're
[1:48:54] healed remember that was a healing
[1:48:55] campaign the greatest healing was your
[1:48:57] soul not your
[1:48:59] body right and then you come through
[1:49:02] sanctification which is what
[1:49:03] sanctification cleans you out in other
[1:49:05] words takes those demons out of you now
[1:49:08] you might let them back
[1:49:09] in but God takes them out and then the
[1:49:13] Holy Ghost is the third pull listen if
[1:49:15] you get born again today you can't get
[1:49:17] unborn
[1:49:19] again praise God for that I'm glad he's
[1:49:22] not an Indian
[1:49:23] Giver you can't get unborn again that
[1:49:26] ought to make you
[1:49:28] happy so what is a third pole it's
[1:49:31] preaching to the totally lost if you're
[1:49:33] born again the people that not born
[1:49:35] again they're
[1:49:37] lost sorry you said well I'm not a
[1:49:39] preacher you're a LIF
[1:49:42] liver right you're a LIF liver though
[1:49:46] you live your life in front of people
[1:49:47] that is the greatest sermon that could
[1:49:49] ever be but I want to ask you one more
[1:49:51] time can you
[1:49:54] read we can all read the outside of the
[1:49:57] book cuz that was where brother ran
[1:49:59] restored all everything back to the
[1:50:01] faith of the fathers like in the first
[1:50:02] church Age first two three Church
[1:50:05] ages but can you not just read that
[1:50:08] Unwritten part be
[1:50:12] it be that Unwritten
[1:50:16] part can
[1:50:19] you can you do that
[1:50:23] job said oh that my words were now
[1:50:26] written oh that they were printed in a
[1:50:28] book that they were Graven with an iron
[1:50:31] pin and led in the rock
[1:50:35] forever all that led him to one thing a
[1:50:39] revelation that his Redeemer lived yes
[1:50:42] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[1:50:44] he shall stand at the latter day upon
[1:50:46] the Earth and though after my skin worms
[1:50:49] destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:50:53] I'll see
[1:50:54] God Matthew 5:8 blessed are the pure in
[1:50:57] heart for they shall understand God or
[1:51:00] see
[1:51:02] God whom I shall see for myself and mine
[1:51:05] eyes Shall Behold and not another this
[1:51:07] is back to job though my Reigns be
[1:51:09] consumed within me Malachi 4 Malachi 3
[1:51:14] sorry then they that feared the Lord
[1:51:16] spake often one to another and the Lord
[1:51:19] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[1:51:21] remembrance was written
[1:51:23] WR before him for them that feared the
[1:51:26] Lord and that thought upon his
[1:51:30] name his name know who he was know where
[1:51:33] he's at so I have one more question what
[1:51:36] part of you have you have you took
[1:51:38] yourself to say Lord I know the I know
[1:51:42] what went on I know that from 1943 to 19
[1:51:47] 1947 to 1963 you were restoring
[1:51:51] everything back like it was back in the
[1:51:52] first church age but then you gave a man
[1:51:55] a vision and that Vision was all that
[1:51:57] was written on the outside so that man
[1:51:59] could see it cuz you're written Epistles
[1:52:01] remember I went back to you are written
[1:52:02] Epistles known and read of all men they
[1:52:05] read your life whatever what's the
[1:52:06] statement I read you like
[1:52:09] a I can read you like a book why cuz
[1:52:13] that's what you are you are a
[1:52:15] book but are you has it been revealed to
[1:52:18] you that you not only see the unwritten
[1:52:21] part but you are the Unwritten
[1:52:23] part brother brandham in The Sixth Seal
[1:52:26] he said it's gone from you it's not for
[1:52:27] you it's not for you to
[1:52:30] understand but it is for us amen they
[1:52:33] didn't get that Unwritten part you and I
[1:52:35] did sure brother brandham gave us the
[1:52:38] message but it laid there dormant for
[1:52:40] years oh yeah there were people getting
[1:52:42] saved getting full of the Holy Ghost no
[1:52:44] no no problem with that but I'm talking
[1:52:46] about a body Chang people a people that
[1:52:49] the unwritten part who in the world
[1:52:52] where in the Bible is it written that
[1:52:54] Abraham and Sarah took a body
[1:52:59] chain I'm
[1:53:01] waiting
[1:53:04] nowhere but if you read it with
[1:53:07] Revelation that's exactly what
[1:53:09] happened but it took a prophet to tell
[1:53:12] us that brother John or we would kept
[1:53:13] reading it kept reading it said well
[1:53:15] they were just old and had a bunch of
[1:53:16] kids no they got turned back
[1:53:20] young they had a body change
[1:53:23] that was the unwritten
[1:53:25] part you and I at the end time we're
[1:53:28] that Unwritten part we have a part to
[1:53:31] play and you're part of it if you want
[1:53:34] to
[1:53:35] be you can get inside that pyramid and
[1:53:38] you can read what man has never ever
[1:53:42] even looked on
[1:53:44] before listen even your life even your
[1:53:48] life reflects it the world can't live
[1:53:50] the Bible
[1:53:55] they can cuss and still be a
[1:53:56] Christian women can wear their pants and
[1:53:58] still be a
[1:54:00] Christian that ain't what the Bible
[1:54:03] says we have that Unwritten part and
[1:54:06] we're living that Unwritten part that's
[1:54:07] what I want you to get today you are the
[1:54:09] unwritten part that no man on the Earth
[1:54:12] is going to understand except the Bride
[1:54:14] of Jesus Christ in the end
[1:54:16] time no one's going to understand it
[1:54:19] except brother Brown said a special good
[1:54:22] people and I believe you're it I believe
[1:54:25] we're here for a purpose we're not here
[1:54:28] just to be taking up space but if you
[1:54:31] don't know God today you better hurry up
[1:54:35] the doors is getting closed and when and
[1:54:37] God's going to close them listen if he
[1:54:39] left up to all of us um we would we
[1:54:42] would we would go on and on till till we
[1:54:44] try to get everybody saved but remember
[1:54:46] God knows that he could have give
[1:54:48] somebody a million years he could have
[1:54:49] give Adolf Hitler a million years to
[1:54:50] live and he'd have never come to a day
[1:54:52] of repent God knows that cuz he's
[1:54:53] infinite you and I don't we keep
[1:54:56] preaching hoping that everybody's going
[1:54:57] to come in but so did Noah but all of a
[1:54:59] sudden God said get in the
[1:55:02] ark Noah you're finished with your
[1:55:04] message get in the
[1:55:07] ark and he got in the ark and he didn't
[1:55:10] want to shut the door God shut the door
[1:55:14] that's what the third pull is folks we
[1:55:16] are not going to be a foolish group of
[1:55:20] people in the end time we're going to
[1:55:21] know what God wants we're going to know
[1:55:23] when he wants it we're going to know
[1:55:24] what to do with it everybody with me

[2:00:20] you say oh they may not
[2:00:23] you think you're going to make God
[2:00:24] nervous you think you're going to make
[2:00:26] God tired he created a world the one
[2:00:29] you're living on into billions of stars
[2:00:31] around you and he never had to have a
[2:00:32] little sweet tea or sit down on the
[2:00:34] porch take a
[2:00:37] break I think sometimes we do we try to
[2:00:40] figure things out that's going on in our
[2:00:41] life yes he said cast your burdens on
[2:00:46] me he didn't say you try to figure them
[2:00:48] out
[2:00:49] yourself he said You cast those burd on
[2:00:52] me and I'll take care of them for
[2:00:55] you I believe this message is the only
[2:00:57] truth there
[2:00:59] is and I'd physically fight somebody if
[2:01:02] they want to fight about it remember
[2:01:03] that brother that brother R said he was
[2:01:05] going to have hold a meeting and he was
[2:01:06] in there uh getting the building ready
[2:01:09] who was that I don't believe it was but
[2:01:11] he yeah he told the he told a story you
[2:01:13] know the brothers the brothers rinse his
[2:01:16] place out you know and he's he's wiping
[2:01:18] stuff down and he's getting everything
[2:01:20] ready and and the book bully of the the
[2:01:22] bully of the Town walked in the guy that
[2:01:24] thought he knew everything and he said
[2:01:27] who told you you could have this
[2:01:28] building he said so and so he said well
[2:01:30] I'm the so and so and so and so and my
[2:01:32] name's so and so and you can't rent that
[2:01:35] building until you fight
[2:01:38] me he said the man just got down off the
[2:01:40] ladder and laid his paintbrush down he
[2:01:42] didn't
[2:01:45] pray what did he say he said every time
[2:01:48] I hit that man's face he said I must
[2:01:50] fight that I may win
[2:01:52] I must fight that I may win and I
[2:01:55] believe that's the one of the meetings
[2:01:57] that somebody either Dwight moody or
[2:01:59] somebody got saved in because that man
[2:02:02] stood up to that bully well the devil's
[2:02:04] the only bully you got to worry about
[2:02:06] the devil's not a bully I mean God's not
[2:02:08] a
[2:02:11] bully I must fight that I may win you
[2:02:16] got to say that everything you go
[2:02:17] through I got to fight that I may win
[2:02:20] cuz we're Overcomers
[2:02:24] hallelujah

[2:02:29] you just been in a Christian way for a
[2:02:30] while you know it's not but listen what
[2:02:33] little bit of discomfort we have CU all

[2:02:38] drink we can smoke we can you know we
[2:02:40] don't have to go to church if we don't
[2:02:42] want
[2:02:43] to there's an eternity facing every one
[2:02:46] of us today yes sir eternity not time
[2:02:51] not just just an era not just a time of
[2:02:54] life there's eternity facing each one of
[2:02:57] us

[2:03:02] world which is only
[2:03:06] temporal I look in the other day you uh

[2:03:14] had lived in in probably 10 years and
[2:03:16] I've been delivering that route about 10
[2:03:18] years and brother Danny that house has
[2:03:20] just sit there nobody's done anything to
[2:03:21] it
[2:03:22] but that house has gradually
[2:03:27] collapsed just sitting there just
[2:03:29] because of age Brother Gary saying I
[2:03:31] know just because of age and time and a
[2:03:33] man told me one time he said the reason
[2:03:35] that happens is there's no life in that
[2:03:42] house you think about that in your
[2:03:44] spiritual
[2:03:45] walk if you're devoid of God your house
[2:03:48] is
[2:03:49] crumbling but if you got life in your
[2:03:51] house
[2:03:54] don't worry he'll take care of us all
[2:03:57] that's not a promise from me I can't
[2:03:58] promise you that that's a promise from
[2:04:00] the word of God that says we're going to
[2:04:02] make it let's just be the house of God
[2:04:06] let God live in our
[2:04:08] house it's his
[2:04:11] anyway you have to crawl over the cross
[2:04:14] to get to
[2:04:15] hell you know hell was not created for
[2:04:18] us or or the world it was created for
[2:04:21] for the devil and his angels we just
[2:04:23] decided some people just going to decide
[2:04:24] to go there and be devoid of God there
[2:04:27] will be nothing Eternal listen that's
[2:04:29] another thing hell hell's not Eternal if
[2:04:31] hell's Eternal they got eternal life how
[2:04:33] simple is that of a doctrine that boy
[2:04:35] now the Catholics and everybody else
[2:04:36] will say yeah you're going to burn
[2:04:38] eternally no you're not going to burn
[2:04:39] eternally you're just going to go
[2:04:42] away you're just going to go away you
[2:04:44] won't even
[2:04:45] be
[2:04:48] sorry I can't be forgotten amen
[2:04:53] is everybody listening to me I can't be
[2:04:55] forgotten if you're born again today you
[2:04:58] can for an eternity not be
[2:05:01] forgotten Hall cuz the Bible says I'm
[2:05:04] engraved in the palms of that man's
[2:05:07] hand and that's eternal life that's what
[2:05:11] I put my whole future on there's a lot
[2:05:13] of things people put their future on
