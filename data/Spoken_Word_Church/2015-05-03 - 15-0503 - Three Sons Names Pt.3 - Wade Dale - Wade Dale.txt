TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they are an impact on your life okay um like we were talking about in the Bible Study last night each of the dispensations had a word there was a word for every dispensation m u Martin Luther had a word Wesley had a word Pentecost had a word Paul had a word irus all they all had a word to bring and it was the word of God it didn't come from somewhere else it came from it came from God's own mind it was God's mind projected to the people but now in the end time we brought all that up from there to here with an understanding of the justification the sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost what irenius went through what Paul went through all the all the faith of the fathers has been brought back and not only the faith of the fathers has been brought back but these three sons Nam has something definitely to do in your your life not that it was just the Son of God before the foundation of the world and the son of man was Jesus and the son of David's going to be in the Millennium yeah sure that's a dispensation that's but to the Bride of Jesus Christ if we don't get them all in order and know what they are to begin with then I always wondered how the Catholic church I'm trying to word this right I always wonder how the Catholic Church brought things in like that well what it does is the Son of God has characteristics right right the son of man has characteristics son of David had they have different characteristic same person but different characteristics right that's right all right now what the Catholic Church does is they take them and they twist them a little bit yeah then they may marry the mother God then they make this saint this and they make this saint that well now as we come over here on this side follow me now as we come over here on this side we know exactly why these saints were on the earth MH okay yeah there's no doubt Columba he was a saint of the Catholic church at one time but he was a church age messenger then you got all these Saints cilas and all these other people the Catholic Church there what I'm saying is the Catholic Church knows about dispensations they have to because there's a dispensation of this one and this one and this one and this one but what they're saying is is you got to pray to that person right okay yeah they they bypass going to the the son the real son the Son of God they put all these intercessors in between and the Bible says there's no intercessor but one and that's Christ Jesus right but what the Catholic church is they they say well we got this dispensation of of St Patrick or whoever you know well would you pray to him for whatever we were in Colorado one time and I had never I never dealt with a Catholic not a real true Catholic you know you you see these people says I'm Catholic and that's a good easy religion you know CU you can do what you want to and get by with it just go talk to the priest that's right but this lady was a devout Catholic I told somebody the story but she said do you mind if I pray for you before you leave cuz we stayed at her house and our little uh off building and we Hunted mu there on her property and and she said do you mind if I pray for you I said sure I don't care pray pray for your travel so she gets this book out she turns to the patron saint of travel which I can't remember his name but let's just say it's St Patrick she shows the picture of the guy standing there you know it's a caricature or a picture of them and then up underneath there's a prayer for travel so she reads that prayer to me you know so I I said can I see the book so I'm flipping through and I mean there's prayers for everything I mean there's prayers for when you're going through trouble you lose a there's a saint there that you pray to to make intercession you we she was praying she wasn't praying to God she's praying to that Saint in that book she was praying that prayer to that Saint that he will help us on our travel so there's the Catholic Church taking what I mean by the three sons names let's not get it to where it it's it's uh Catholicism yeah well today I'm going to pray to the Son of God because I need but tomorrow I need something in my flesh and I'm going to pray to the son of man and let's pray to the son of David when we pray for Israel no it's not that it's one God one intercessor Christ Jesus and leave it at that okay but we must understand these dispensations because the Son of God did have a work still does I don't say did still has a work cuz he these these these uh forms of God are Eternal that's right remember he gains no new attributes right right he just displays them I was reading uh yesterday brother brandham said he said now that kid there's 15 years old somebody in the audience he said now he has the potential to be a father that's right but he's not one he has the potential to be a grandfather but he's not one the manifestation of him not having a son yet so he can't be a father right but he can be a husband you understand he can be a husband he's a human he works he does all these things I I never heard brother Brown explain it like that but I can't it was may be in here but I'll look it up and read it to you because he was really bringing it out he said now he said I'm a grandfather right he said because I can show you my grandkids and the manifestation of me being the grandfather is I can show you my children watch the same way with God of course God's not a granddaddy but God's a father and for him to have a father for him to be a father he had to have children amen so we're the children of God so let's don't look to him and say well I want to pray that no the Holy Ghost the Father the Son all same person right it's the same one that's right God's our father right there's only one intercessor and that's Jesus Christ and we were reading it last night in Romans why to bringing a thought the thought coming down is heir of God Spirit heir of God that's eternal life heir of God and join HS with Christ will Christ come down in the flesh right cuz verse 14 whatever this was here was made flesh in verse 14 the same person right that's right and the Word was made flesh right so it's not another person it's not even another uh identity it's the same person with another manifestation all right so watch here we see in the beginning was the word now we look that up we talking about Loos we we're not get off of that we're going to go back on a little bit more today in the beginning was the logos and the Loos was with God and the logos was God that's right okay the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made verse 14 and that same logos was made flesh okay now of course this is the son of man that's right right this is the son of man when the word's made flesh that's the son of man dispensation right yes so we're we're SK we're going ahead just a little bit but I want you to see that that same logos that's why last night I was hoping that you know for those of you that didn't make it listen because we we've got this mentality that we're a separate person from God mhm if you got the new birth yeah you're verse 14 that's right that's right right H right that's right right H that's the son of man at the end time that's exactly right yes that's what we got to get to take no take no you know we don't say well the Son of God was here and then we did away with him and now we're in the son of man dispensation no no no he's remember he's the son of God now we're going to read next next Sunday for brother talks about eternal sunship now remember one thing see we got into this discussion with the people that said Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan they said well brother Brown didn't believe in Eternal sunship well I don't either but watch what he's saying he says the way the Catholics put him as an eternal sunship what father Eternal son Eternal Holy Ghost Eternal they're taking three separate personalities three gods and are making that son eternal uhuh can't be but the Son of God always was he don't gain these titles right right before the foundation of the world he was the son of man that's right corre he just hadn't come to that part yet that's right y right now remember God never developed anything he always was yes that's right he never developed a new thought that's right the only the only reason that we're going through this down here on Earth is to understand that man and the only way for us to understand that man he knows that is to come this way okay all right so that's the way to understand that man that's right because he didn't go up there and say well I think I'll go this route and maybe they'll understand me no he knew see because remember he knows your thoughts he knew your thoughts before he come before you come on Earth he knew what you were going to think your whole entire life that's true yes all your problems all your heartaches and your your problems with understanding him yes right right right right see we got to understand that that God knew that we would struggle with put it in there whatever XYZ but he knew though that this word was perfect and if we ever look to that through dumb donkeys teachers lay people whoever doesn't matter but remember like Daddy said last night the seed had to come through the body and the seed is the word so the word has to come through you can't get it yourself that's right nobody can you can't get it yourself you have somebody has to teach you right and you know want you say well I don't know about remember that's what he thought before the foundation of the world that that's what you need and that's why you're going this Direction that's right see sometimes we don't think about that God already knew what you would struggle about before you got here that's right and he put that provision in this written that's why that logos is that logo it's that one that comes and says hey this is who I am and this is what's going on in my mind this is what's going on like we talked about last Sunday uh you take a logo McDonald's well now that's just a an M says McDonald's right but now you and I know when we drive by that logo what's behind that logo they serve hamburgers french fries not hot dog hamburgers french fries biscuit you see what I'm talking about but now that's not written on the logo why it take it take a billboard as big as this church to describe but they've done such a good job promoting their logo logos they they promoted put it to the Forefront they don't put the menu out on the on the board they put the attraction right you can understand McDonald's by the logo mhm you everybody getting what I'm saying yeah yeah same way with God God there's no way you can understand he can't write he the billions and billions of words needed to describe him look the song says we were in the ocean F Sky partment made every stalk on earth a quill and every man 6 billion people ascribed by trade could never write the love of God so what' God do he brought the logos something we can understand that is somebody that's going to step to the forr say man when I say somebody I don't mean somebody else I didn't say somebody else I said somebody that will step up and promote or show what he's all about well what was the long God the word right right amen now physically it wasn't written before the foundation of the world but this is literally the mind of God Amen yes that's right if it's not we need to find something else this is literally and and you know what it's not everything God thought of right cuz he thought of all your thoughts and they're not written in here he thought of all so and so's thoughts but what he done was he narrowed it down to a logo or a logos he narrowed it down to one where we can understand that he is the word so whatever this written word is now look this word has so many layers to it yes it does cuz remember this is the Eternal Word of God yes we're going to be talking about this 10 billion billion years from now that's right come on people this is this is this is life this is what God but what he done was your Bible would be what 8,000 mil thick and 2,000 Mi wide if you put every thought that God had God narrowed it down to the logos this is what I'm going to do I'm going to speak this part of me and then through this part of me you're going to understand the rest of it mhm everybody got that good amen like McDonald's like the logo we're going to put this arch up right we're going to promote McDonald's but behind it you're going to find all the things building employees what they want you know I mean when you see that what goes through your mind cherol you don't go do what cholesterol yeah NY right well see see what you're doing each of you have a different thought of McDonald M but you can't have different thought of this that's right see you can only use the example so far you can there's only one thought of God now there's a lot of things we can think of him but it's not right but when you come down to that logos and you see that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that was his part of him to promote what he's going to do cuz he cuz he he created the world through this amen right all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made right so the logos is the one that promoted the creation of everything right the Locos did the creating right right so the Bible says so brother Brown said that the logos is one he said like a he said now it's like a child playing before the father's door well now to me that's an example there wasn't a little bitty kid in heaven playing in front of another man right but it is an analogy to where you're standing and you're looking and you're seeing that somebody's out there saying let there be and he's just he he's playing he's not playing God don't play yeah but it is would be like a kid going well I think I want Jupiter right over there and I want you know I mean you're just standing there and you're going the Earth is a little too far bring it back this way just a little bit I mean you're sitting there and this this person I want to say guy but he's a person this person is standing there knowing where that star needs to be for 10 billion years from now that they don't run into each other that's right and how in the world can people see that there's a a a a ball just called Earth staying in the same rotation yeah for hundreds of millions of years and never jump you know never falling over this away or or you know moving up this away or or you know sure the Earth wobbles because of what man did but the Perfection of God's going to bring that thing right back the sin's what took tilted it off to the side God's going to bring it back when he brings everything back but I want you to understand that that in the beginning was the word the logo the speech that's when God began to take what he was thinking and speak it okay not another person he didn't create another person to do this it was the father made manifest in what in a form that you can see that's what brother R said form you can see like a father play I mean like a child playing before the father's door he set a sacred light now now to me he's making an illustration because to me if you were to look at the pillar of fire if you were Moses if you were standing with Moses with your revelation of the end time the full Revelation you might have saw a pillar of fire but you have sent Jesus standing in that Pillar of Fire Moses Revelation was Pillar of Fire cuz that Pillar of Fire was going to lead him all the way through but now remember brother Bram said that same Pillar of Fire walked by him in the form of a man when Moses said I want to see you right well just for a second he could see him but he couldn't see his face that's right right because Jesus hadn't come yet that theophany was the same man though same man that walked shorts of Galilee same one that walked in front of Moses same one that talked with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden right amen all right so that's that's where the the logos is not another person and it is called the Son of God because it's not a lower form of God it's another form of God all right you understand that it's another form a different form it's I like to say another I don't like to have different in there that makes it sound like if you say different that's two no it's the same man in another form same man in another form all right he stepped over and manifested it hisself coming from the like brother R said the great Eternal that covered everything he's coming down now and he's going to present his logo to the world his logos M cuz see even the scholars know what the logos is it was the creator it was the one that did the Crea well even in the Bible it says you're the Creator talking about Jesus Christ well they had to know that those two link together see that's what I mean the whole Bible if you look at the Bible the way we see the Bible you got to see one true and living God I don't see how they bring a trinity out all that that's right but they do they know that Jesus created the world but he's a second person of the Trinity yeah a son another something yeah and even the people in the message even the people in the message you know they said well he was another identity I don't even like that no he was just another form I'm the same person but now I have the form of a grandfather didn't change one thing except my thoughts right cuz I have a grandchild that's right but now somebody that doesn't know me I'm just a man I like a man I'm not two people my grandpa's not going to walk in the door the meest to Grandpa no I'm here when my wife walks up I have a manifestation for my wife when my mom walks up I have another manifestation for my mother not the same one as my wife that's why you got to see these dispensations where God is the Son of God then he comes down as the son of man and see son of man is where we really have to understand who he is cu it's God made flesh all right cuz remember the Son of God is what Spirit God that's the spirit that's right amen the Son of God is the spirit that's right amen so that spirit that that Loos was not a flesh man that we know flesh standing creating he was in theophany form right right he was a theophany which is a word body right all right he wasn't this light and then come to that it's just like I said about Moses the Revelation that brother brandham had was sure he was this great thing you couldn't understand but if he was a light and then he become a man he changed his form or he changed his he changed his whole being he can't do that if we were made in His image we were made Spirit man not Spirit Bott of light right we were made Spirit man cuz he was a man right that's right he's been a man the whole time he's never not been a man right if he was then he changed when he said let us make man in our own image all right so in the beginning was the word that's right word was with God and the Word was God right the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and then he talk about he was the light shining in darkness and he talks about John then we'll go down to verse 14 but that logos when he stepped forth and when I say step forth what I'm talking about is I kind of use this analogy if you turn the lights down real low and you and you have this huge Auditorium eternity have this huge Auditorium and it's dark it's black and somebody turns on just a little bit of light well you can see across the auditorium and you notice there's a there's something in the corner you don't know really what it is cuz you can't see it now remember see means to understand okay I'm not talking about physically see it I'm talking about spiritually by the eye of Faith spiritually seeing so there there you notice there's something in the corner well you turn the light up just a little bit more you notice you said well it's not an animal because it's upright you see what I'm talking about as the light comes on more and more you're seeing more but now remember we're going to see this full grown man after a while once the light comes on but he never was not the full grown man that's right right he always was you just couldn't see him that's right or understanding that's right because the light had not shown because see look the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not you can't comprehend when things are dark that's right so he was in that corner of the building see but then as you turn the light on you say well it's a man not a woman so you give it you narrowing it more down okay characteristic then you look in you go more light comes on you go he's got a beard then you got to turn a little more light on so and tell what color his eyes are you see what I'm saying down Through the Ages that's the way God that's the way God brought himself from great Eternal you couldn't understand down to flesh what' he do he turned on more light more understanding that's right so you could see him better that's true amen I want to see you you know yes Open the Eyes of My Heart your heart don't have eyes but that's where you see from that's right that's where you understand you understand from there right all right so let's go let's go to u a couple of quotes here and U cuz I want to really strike this home about this son of God or the logos and I got a problem today I'm leaking I'm spitting everywhere where yesterday to yeah showers a blessing showers a blessing right on the front row yeah Glory all right right here this is on questions and answers we read this last week we're going to read it again now see Jesus was telling God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth see God God had to start the way he did remember cuz that's the only way we can understand it that's why we say well we got a plan well our plans change all the time remember God's plan can't change so whatever he is was or ever going to be he was before we were here amen so what he's doing is is he's you say well it should shouldn't happen that way and then you come to the realization that that's the only way it could happen right that's right like we were talking about Martin Luther you couldn't have brought Martin Luther on the scene and then brother brown right the people wouldn't understood him that's right but you had to bring Martin Luther John Wesley little bit more sanctification the Pentecostals with the gifts the speaking in tongues the healing and all that he had to bring that campaign in then brother Bam could step forth from that and the people would easily accept him at first obviously but not when he started preaching this Doctrine but he was more easily acceptable than he would be just coming from justification to that right God knew that that's why he sent these that's why brother brandham had to come being a prophet he had to show us the characteristics of every Church age some people say well the church age is not that important to me it's very important very important to understand the basic doctrines of this message the correct doctrines of this message you have to understand the church ages the messenger what was brought and why it was brought during that time that's right cuz see if it would if that if we if we say well that was God then that's the only way it could come right cuz see you anything you do you look back and if you say well that come from God you say why' it come that way that's the only way God saw that somebody can understand it may not be you right but that's the way God could be understood by somebody in this world he came that way all right and also remember he came to confuse the wise and prudent that's right what the Bible says all right but you know why because he knew what their thoughts would be he knew they never would come to a realization but he came the way he was supposed to come so that his children the ones he thought knew that was going to accept him would come that's the only way he could come so he had to come to logos the Creator and come all the way down through we'll go through the Old Testament um in a couple of weeks with that logos cuz remember he never never changes he always was a Son of God that's what let me go back to that just a second because the Catholic Church believes in the Son of God second person of the Trinity well that's what brother brand was saying cuz remember he can't ever lose that title right he never can lose the title of Son of God but it's the Son of God in a manifestation of the same God not a separate God or a separate identity as some people in the message say they say well got Eternal sunship they don't even understand what brother R's talking about he's talking about the Catholic form of Eternal sunship which makes that second person of a trinity Jesus the second person of the Trinity he's not the second person of Trinity that's right the Son of God was before the foundation of the world always was and always will be amen amen now God is a spirit now if God created man in his own image his own likeness what kind of man did he create Spirit man right so now this is remember remember this is this is watch what brother Bown saying cuz he's going to back up right here cuz see he says he was in other words but he's explaining something here now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and Creator Spirit man close reading of this now to the one that asked the question we'll find this that God gave the mean of the cattle fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made him in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today now what is is the Holy Spirit the Son of God everybody got that amen the holy spirit is the Son of God because brother BR said the Holy Ghost dispensation down through the church Ages was the son of God dispensation because the holy spirit is not a human man right you understand what I'm saying he anoints or inhabits a human man that's right because God is a spirit he's never going to change from that amen that's why I said you've never seen the father at any time you've seen the manifestation of the father through Jesus yes all right start with the Loos though the Loos had to be the same man that hung on Calvary right so he looked the same all the way through remember God's not some gray-headed Gray beard right with a cane That's Right you've never seen anybody Pro portray it in this world ever of God being a young vibrant man they've always portrayed God as being some old the father yeah the Father Figure Grandpa more than that but you want you know you stand up with a state and he's like this you know understanding God I really don't want a god like that I want one that's always been young and vibrant cuz I believe that's what we're going to go we're not going to be old we're going to be young again right that's right but that's the world looking at the father figure that's right cuz then they see they they can bring Jesus as a separate person see what I'm talking about with the Trinity he bring him as a separate person well he's the young guy that you you know he's the one you're going to see I'm thank God for Revelation to lead just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today so that's the Son of God because remember the son of man is the Son of God inhabiting human flesh right not a separate person same person come down into human flesh to gain the title the son of man all right we'll get to that all right I keep W to scroll with that he was in other words we'll stop right here Adam the first man in the lorder creation of God the first creation was God himself what the logos right the logos stepping forth to where you can understand him not him remember he don't gain anything he gains no new knowledge zero so when that logos stood he knew what he was going to do all the way to the Future home and past the future home and they there was only one path to do it and this is the way it was going to be amen amazing what a mighty God we serve that's why you can't understand the the great Eternal God but you can bring him down into words word I don't even like to say words cuz to me the Bible is one word it's the word it's the Loos amen all right he was in other words the first creation was God himself then out of God comes the Loos oh well that's something coming out well it is when I'm a grandpa that part comes out of me but I don't step over in another form even over here into something else no it's the manifestation of me that part of me comes out right so it's not another person comes out of God and he's standing there right then out of God came the Loos which was the son of God then out of the Loos which was the word in the beginning was the word we read it Word was God word was made flesh and dwelt among out of the lust came forth the man Genesis 1:26 and 27 and God said okay we can say and L God said let us make man in our own image because remember he had children that's right he had children cuz he's already seen them but he had to bring it down to where he can get them out you had to bring it down to where the manifestation had to come out of him which was the word came forth the man oh I get a beautiful picture of my mind if you can take a little trip let's skip go back 100 million years for there was a star moon or anything there was time there wasn't nothing all forever eternity all and every eternity was God and he was there in the beginning now he's looking at a picture no man can see the father at any time no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form now you say oh boy God is not in body form like we see this body form form flesh he's talking about you understand that he's not saying he's not a body form yes because God is not in body form God is a spirit what's he saying he's not saying he's this light floating around no he's in a body form but it's not a body like me and you are looking at a body all right flesh body he's not looking at a flesh body cuz God is not in body form God is the spirit all right no man is seing the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared him first John but notice there's nothing no space No Light No dark no nothing just seems nothing but there's a great but in there in there in all that there's a great supernatural being Jehovah God covered all space of all places of all times now remember this is the prophet going back in the very mind of God and explaining what the mind of God is we got to believe that we got to believe that he is he has gone back God has allowed him to go back as far as man has ever went and F and further to show exactly what God trying to present to the people he's the beginning of creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move an Adam not nothing no air no nothing but yet God was there that was God let's watch for a few minutes no man has seen that now that's the father that's God the Father after a while began to see a little sacred light begin to form like a Halo you can only see it by spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing a great Bast watching what God's doing we'll get right to the question here and you'll see how he brings it in no one has seen God now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of Supernatural looking a little white light for me what is it called by the Bible readers logos or the anointing or the anointing or as I was going to say the part of be God begin to develop in something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it is so he's bringing this down he's he's bringing it to where Moses is at The Burning Bush Moses sees the burning bush but Jesus Christ is the one standing in that burning bush right same thing with this light we see this sacred Halo of light but in that secret Halo of light is that man standing there right but you got to start somewhere so that God can or that man can understand what God is that was a word of God now God gave himself birth to this son which was before there was ever an Adam or heir to make an Adam that will see Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation World way back y now see look what she says but just by eyes of just Supernatural we see a Halo standing there well that Halo don't stand so see what he's he's describing is a man standing there right there's a man standing there cuz we weren't made in the image of a cloud right but he's standing there now that's the Son of God the logos and also we can bring a word Christ in there Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Christ is the creator so Son of God and we'll list these later WR the logos now I can see him playing around like a little child so it's not a light it's a form it's it's a form but but you have to bring the light in to bring it down great this big and then coming down coming down not for his pleasure but for what our pleasure for us to for us to know what he was I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity now then in his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light so that's the logos explaining and beginning to show a physical creation remember everything was created up here in God's mind first that's right but this for us for us to be human for us being humans to understand God we had to understand that that God had a mouth and he could speak that's and what he spoke came into existence amen so that's why he's coming into this he's coming down to this logos where he can speak or be the logo of this eternal destination that we're all going through so that when we look back we see it was Christ amen amen we see it was the son of God we see it was the anointing all these different things we see that by the eye of faith we'll stop right there and continue on down a little bit further so Lord bless you
