[2:38] stomach issues so let's just remember
[2:39] that
[2:40] and remember them also also praise God I
[2:43] don't I I haven't been to the doctor yet
[2:46] but I did get my my chart my chart's
[2:48] pretty accurate I would think yeah well
[2:51] the nurses that would too that we have
[2:52] are shaking their head yes
[2:54] but all all 14 biopsies
[2:58] we're benign
[3:04] that's right
[3:05] that's what we were looking for that's
[3:07] what brothers uh dirty saves what we
[3:09] were looking for but there was two
[3:11] concern areas and they
[3:13] um all came back but none so we sure
[3:16] appreciate that appreciate the Lord
[3:17] giving us Grace a man giving us grace
[3:20] and mercy but we sure do appreciate
[3:22] doctors I you know why I was thinking
[3:24] back there there used to be a thing
[3:26] called exploratory surgery right
[3:29] a while back long time ago they'd have
[3:31] to cut you open and find out what was
[3:32] wrong with you I thank God that somebody
[3:35] created a machine
[3:37] MRI CT scan ever how they got to go up
[3:40] or down they can find out what's going
[3:42] on without
[3:44] them cutting you open like a like a fish
[3:46] but I appreciate the the whoever it was
[3:50] I don't care who it was whirly guy or
[3:51] whoever it was these MRIs and CT scans
[3:53] are are well better so the doctors can
[3:56] can help us I sure believe in doctors I
[3:58] know y'all do too we're not against them
[4:01] none whatsoever so but we sure do
[4:03] appreciate the Lord though because the
[4:05] great physician is the one that we look
[4:07] at and we see that by his stripes were
[4:10] already healed so let's go to Lord in
[4:13] prayer we're gonna
[4:14] kind of deviate just a little bit today
[4:16] because there's something I want you to
[4:18] I want you to praise God about today
[4:22] where the elect
[4:24] we're the bride
[4:26] I want us to show that
[4:29] let's bow our heads Lord thank you for
[4:31] being with us today already
[4:33] Lord in song and worship and I pray this
[4:36] should be with us in the word father
[4:38] you said you sent your word and healed
[4:39] us
[4:40] the Lord May the healing power go from
[4:42] the front all the way to the back
[4:44] and Lord reach out into places like
[4:47] sister Freedom mom and dad and sister
[4:49] Johnny and sister married and all the
[4:52] different ones if I forget somebody in
[4:53] the Lord forgive me
[4:54] but you know who they are Lord that
[4:56] needs you right now
[4:58] and sister Tootsie too the sister
[5:00] Freedom Tootsie being sick we pray that
[5:03] you should touch them Lord and raise
[5:04] them up out of that father
[5:06] we thank you for all things we give you
[5:08] praise and honor that you've even let us
[5:10] live another day that we can breathe and
[5:13] breathe freely and live in a country
[5:15] that for now we can
[5:17] Lord be free and and be able to stand In
[5:20] a Pulpit and be able to congregate
[5:22] together but Lord there may be a time
[5:24] when that's not going to happen so I
[5:25] pray now Lord that we as you told the
[5:28] prophet that we would put things in our
[5:30] storehouse
[5:31] today Lord may we fill up our storehouse
[5:35] as we brought it Lord an empty vessel
[5:38] to use this Lord for your honor and
[5:40] glory and bless your people bless the
[5:41] congregation
[5:42] bless the ones in the Foreign Fields
[5:44] Lord our foreign Brothers Lord we pray
[5:46] that you touch them Father today
[5:48] just ever be with us in Jesus name we
[5:50] pray amen and we do have a few that
[5:53] still that's going out on vacation and
[5:55] we've got some that's going on vacation
[5:56] so we we want to keep them in prayer
[6:00] may have been some horrible wrecks out
[6:03] around the community so we just want to
[6:05] uh
[6:06] prayed Lord's Mercy on all of us
[6:09] in the beginning was the word this is
[6:11] 128 and the Word was with God and the
[6:13] Word was God and that word was made
[6:15] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[6:18] his glory of the glory the only begotten
[6:19] of the father
[6:21] full of grace and truth Jesus answered
[6:23] and sent to them verily verily listen
[6:25] listen I say unto you except the man be
[6:27] born again
[6:28] he cannot see
[6:31] or understand or be a part of the
[6:34] kingdom of God but he's made provision
[6:36] that you can this is what I want to get
[6:38] to today Revelation is 19 6. and I heard
[6:41] it as it was the voice now we look at
[6:44] all these voice it's one voice not voice
[6:46] says and I heard is a word the voice of
[6:49] a great multitude and of the voice of
[6:52] many Waters and as The Voice
[6:56] of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah
[6:58] for the Lord omnipotent reigneth in
[7:00] other words every voice said the same
[7:01] thing
[7:04] every boy said the same thing went to
[7:06] different places thundering Waters but
[7:08] it all came down to one place it's
[7:10] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[7:12] omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and
[7:14] rejoice not be saddened
[7:17] downtrodden no let's be glad and rejoice
[7:20] and give honor to him for the marriage
[7:22] of the Lamb has come that's your new
[7:24] birth remember that happens down here
[7:26] and his wife hath made herself ready
[7:28] down here all right and to her was
[7:31] granted that she should be arrayed we'll
[7:34] look at that word of raid or or clothe
[7:36] or or a garment thrown over us and find
[7:39] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[7:43] is the righteousness
[7:45] the righteousness it doesn't say of God
[7:50] it says the righteousness
[7:53] of saints you may be seated in the Lord
[7:55] as blessing to the reading of the word
[7:57] let's continue on now we know that we've
[8:00] been talking about being born again and
[8:01] and uh some of you have sent messages
[8:04] that they've had a good time with this
[8:06] and I really appreciate
[8:08] um the positive comments sometimes you
[8:10] think man you're preaching on a new
[8:12] birth again brother Dale's preached it
[8:13] for 30 40 years and here we are at it
[8:16] again well you know what somebody needs
[8:17] it
[8:18] I may need it I need a refilling so I
[8:21] need I need being born again
[8:23] all right
[8:25] seeing you have purified your souls and
[8:27] obeying the truth through the spirit
[8:29] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[8:31] that you love one another with a pure
[8:33] heart
[8:33] fervently being born again that word
[8:37] being means be God again to produce I
[8:41] like that to produce again
[8:44] you've already produced a new birth God
[8:46] has produced itself now what you got to
[8:48] do you got to produce
[8:50] you got to produce produce Christ in
[8:52] other words you've got to produce if
[8:53] there's oranges in your the life of the
[8:56] orange plant you've got to produce
[8:58] oranges all right so if you got the life
[9:00] of God in you we are going to have to
[9:01] produce the life of God not just on
[9:03] Sunday and Wednesday not just part of
[9:05] our life uh and you know our graph
[9:08] shouldn't look like this our Christian
[9:10] our Christian walks we sure it is
[9:13] but it shouldn't look like that our
[9:16] Christian experience should be that it
[9:17] carries us through everything and even
[9:20] though we have a bad day or a good day
[9:21] it really doesn't matter we're heading
[9:24] in another Direction being born again
[9:26] not of corruptable seed but of
[9:27] Incorruptible what is a seed that is the
[9:30] word of God so it's being born again by
[9:33] what nine
[9:36] non-truths cannot produce a seed of God
[9:39] all right and non-truth is not of God
[9:42] we'll get to that in just a few minutes
[9:44] down in the church ages there was a lot
[9:46] of non-truth that was not God but he
[9:49] allowed that to happen in Luther's age
[9:51] Wesley's age even in Colombia and
[9:54] different ones he allowed that to happen
[9:56] but he said it would come back to
[9:58] Incorruptible it would come back to full
[10:00] word in the end time and we'll get to
[10:02] that in just a second by the word of God
[10:04] so how are you being born again
[10:06] by the word of God which liveth and
[10:09] abideth forever like I said that word
[10:12] means to produce again be born again are
[10:14] born anew
[10:19] in the message you must be born again
[10:20] brother Brown said look God bless his
[10:23] word and I want to take the subject this
[10:24] morning to Jesus's first Doctrine now
[10:26] what was his first Doctrine you must be
[10:28] born again that was his first Doctrine
[10:31] and we find out that there's so many
[10:33] different meanings that people put to it
[10:35] that's what we've been talking about
[10:36] nearly all churches say You must be born
[10:39] again there's not any religion that says
[10:42] well you just need to just know there's
[10:43] a there's a method I guess you might say
[10:46] to some people that to get born again
[10:48] but it can't be a Creed it can't be a
[10:50] dog man it can't be false Doctrine
[10:53] all right it's got to be the word of God
[10:54] nearly all churches say You must be born
[10:57] again but each one has their different
[10:58] interpretations what it means to be born
[11:01] again
[11:03] now remember to be born again as we were
[11:05] saying before it's not got anything to
[11:08] do with the feeling with an emotion
[11:12] it's an experience
[11:15] you're still what you were until you're
[11:18] actually born again of the spirit of God
[11:20] all those Creeds don't change you
[11:23] all your coming to church don't change
[11:24] you
[11:25] listen to the tapes don't change you
[11:31] let her killeth
[11:33] Spirit given life that's what we'll look
[11:36] at here in just a few minutes because
[11:37] because when we uh in this statue of a
[11:39] perfect man it's got to be the spirit
[11:41] truth everything's got to come together
[11:43] all right for everything to come
[11:45] together we've got to be as the prophet
[11:48] of God told us to be honed all right and
[11:51] then and then
[11:52] um
[11:53] iron has got to fit iron iron can't fit
[11:56] rubber so you got to have the same in
[11:58] other words The Life of Christ is what's
[11:59] growing up and guess what's coming down
[12:01] as a headstone it's the Life of Christ
[12:03] all right so we need to get if we have
[12:06] to let's get back to that
[12:09] let's live the life of Christ all right
[12:12] then all these Mysteries that we're
[12:14] talking about and the voice that we're
[12:16] hearing will be the one that will take
[12:18] us out of here
[12:21] you're still what you were until you
[12:22] actually born again of the spirit of God
[12:24] doesn't change you your Creed joining
[12:26] Church change your idea or good
[12:28] intentions although as good as that
[12:29] might seem it's still not right there's
[12:31] something got to happen remember brother
[12:34] Brown tells us he said that Lutheran
[12:36] Wesley could in other words couldn't get
[12:38] full word because they were reformers
[12:42] now churches that don't have uh the
[12:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost they are
[12:46] reformers
[12:52] can you nod just a little bit louder
[12:56] it's rough Bob you you're supposed to
[12:58] plow this field before me
[13:03] there's something got to happen
[13:06] the new birth is an experience something
[13:08] that takes place so something did happen
[13:11] in Luther's age but yet God still had to
[13:14] wink at his ignorance when he said we
[13:17] still need to be baptized in the name of
[13:19] father son Holy Ghost because that's
[13:20] what the mother Church said and we don't
[13:22] know any different we're going to come
[13:23] out the just shall live by faith we
[13:25] don't have to live by Creed we don't
[13:27] have to live by the
[13:28] um by the Catholic church or the dogmas
[13:30] but then Luther said okay well that's it
[13:32] then
[13:33] but God said no listen that's not all of
[13:35] it that's not full word that's part of
[13:37] the word you got to move on further and
[13:39] then brother Brown said what they all
[13:40] cabbage down he he talks about the
[13:42] Pentecostals they all cabbage down they
[13:45] all stopped as brother Joe was talking
[13:47] about the Wailing Wall if you'll look at
[13:49] them I mean they're moving why because
[13:50] God's in motion God's moving all the
[13:52] time listen in the Garden of Eden when
[13:54] the Masterpiece I'll read it to you in
[13:56] just a minute brother Ryan said when the
[13:57] Masterpiece fell on its face
[14:01] he said God immediately
[14:04] began working to get that thing standing
[14:07] back upright again so praise God that
[14:10] he's still working on me
[14:12] but it's a new birth it's an experience
[14:14] something that takes place
[14:17] so it is not that that brings a new
[14:19] birth in other words decrees and dogmas
[14:21] now the different churches say well
[14:23] except this or believe this I don't want
[14:25] to accept anything
[14:27] Satan can get you to accept anything
[14:31] but when God comes in and burns that old
[14:34] you out and you say oh what a change in
[14:37] my life amen I have new thoughts oh yeah
[14:42] those old thoughts are still there but
[14:44] I've got new thoughts
[14:46] the word has become more alive
[14:51] not like y'all
[14:54] that is a hammer
[14:59] something ought to be sparking inside
[15:02] if it's not sparking Inside by now then
[15:04] we need we need more than walking all
[15:06] over we need to get over
[15:08] get over ourself everybody's looking
[15:10] around at everybody else saying well
[15:11] he's not saying amen so I'm not going to
[15:13] say Amen that's never bothered me one
[15:15] bit
[15:17] Hebrews 11 verse 39 said all these
[15:19] having attained a good report talking
[15:20] about the Old Testament listen
[15:23] we're standing here in a real small
[15:25] microcosm of of this plan of God right I
[15:28] mean we're right here in the moment 2023
[15:30] we're standing here September whatever
[15:32] it is third
[15:33] all right now we are standing in a day
[15:36] where you say well it's you know it's
[15:37] good weather outside and we got tomorrow
[15:39] off and
[15:41] y'all ought to be praising God just for
[15:43] that
[15:44] those of you that work
[15:46] those of you either don't praise God
[15:48] anyway
[15:49] but we're standing in this this one
[15:51] little day
[15:53] but every believer
[15:56] this is what I want you to get today
[15:58] this and another thing I want to bring
[15:59] out
[16:00] today every believer
[16:03] every powerful
[16:07] Paul irenius Martin Colombo think about
[16:12] this Luther
[16:14] Wesley
[16:18] William Branham
[16:22] is that a place waiting on us to come to
[16:24] a place
[16:27] even the Old Testament Saints because
[16:29] they received not the promise now the
[16:30] ones I just told you they received the
[16:32] promise but they didn't receive full
[16:34] promise because it wasn't in their full
[16:36] time to have it you and I are in the
[16:38] full time that that voice is what's
[16:41] going to call us out of here not out of
[16:43] a denomination or out of a Creed but out
[16:46] of this world
[16:48] and they're not going without us
[16:51] God having provided some better thing
[16:55] listen folks this is the better thing
[16:59] that they without us
[17:01] should not be made
[17:04] perfect
[17:06] brother Brown says now and blaspheme
[17:07] misnamed so I believe the reason that
[17:09] there's so much confusion today about
[17:10] the Holy Spirit now look if there's a
[17:12] confusion it's about the Holy Spirit
[17:15] all right
[17:16] because if you don't get the Holy Spirit
[17:18] and you don't get the new birth inside
[17:19] your soul Daniel's 70 weeks the seals
[17:23] will never open to you
[17:25] never
[17:27] open to you without the new birth
[17:29] you will never get a correct revelation
[17:33] of these end-time truths or Mysteries
[17:36] without it
[17:38] without the new birth we're nothing
[17:41] we are confused
[17:44] there's so much confusion today about
[17:46] the holy spirit it's not correctly
[17:48] taught that's why
[17:49] I believe that baptism is taught says
[17:51] just a baptism in other words just throw
[17:53] it out there it's a blanket thing it's
[17:54] not
[17:55] listen it's the life of God yes sir that
[17:59] changes your whole life
[18:01] your own nature
[18:03] don't just throw you away and hide you
[18:06] somewhere now he kills it
[18:10] when you talk about the baptism of the
[18:12] Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that
[18:13] and we've been talking about it for the
[18:14] past several weeks there's a lot goes
[18:17] with that because here in Ezekiel thank
[18:19] God again for a prophet that told us
[18:21] about this new heart that God's going to
[18:23] give us a a new attitude
[18:26] he's going to give us a new way of
[18:28] thinking if he's going to give us come
[18:30] on I mean he said he's taught he went
[18:31] right to the heart yes
[18:34] right to the thing that if it quit
[18:35] beating you're done
[18:37] doesn't matter how sharp the rest of it
[18:39] is you have a heart attack you're gone
[18:41] right okay without some medical help or
[18:44] what more so a new heart will I give you
[18:46] and a new spirit see God was he's he's
[18:50] the one that
[18:51] have you ever thought about this
[18:53] there's nothing new Under the Sun right
[18:55] there's nothing new there's nothing that
[18:57] man has come up with that God of the
[18:59] devil hadn't already thought of
[19:01] and I want to put him in there too
[19:04] amen so these MRIs CT scans
[19:09] all that stuff they can do outside your
[19:11] body without opening you up God's been
[19:14] doing it since the dawn's time
[19:17] God's been Wireless forever
[19:19] he's never he's never needed a
[19:22] connection
[19:23] he just needs you to be what be a
[19:25] willing receptor
[19:28] he's healed people
[19:31] and never even
[19:34] make an inch cut
[19:37] so nothing you under the sun man has
[19:39] just what tapped into God's laboratory
[19:41] and said hey we can take these unseen
[19:44] waves compress them together or what
[19:46] more are these Mac you know if we're a
[19:49] light and magnetic images and they come
[19:51] up with all and that's great fine with
[19:53] me
[19:53] that's okay like I said better than
[19:55] cutting you over the open like a fish
[19:56] and said oh there's nothing wrong
[19:59] so you back up
[20:01] but I will take away the Stony heart out
[20:03] of your flesh
[20:05] has he done that
[20:08] has he softened us up
[20:11] I want you to think about you I'll think
[20:14] about me
[20:15] like Bob said judge yourself
[20:18] now if we judge ourselves righteous then
[20:20] we can judge because we are going to be
[20:22] the judge
[20:23] it's like brother Dale's always said if
[20:25] he was if he was standing at the point
[20:27] of casting the first stone he'd have to
[20:28] cast the first stone
[20:30] like
[20:32] why
[20:34] judgment starts where
[20:36] House of God all right
[20:40] but you're going to take the Stony heart
[20:42] out of your flesh and I will give you
[20:44] a heart of Flesh in other words
[20:46] something he can work with and I will
[20:48] put my spirit within you now there is
[20:51] the holy spirit there is when God burns
[20:53] your old nature out and what vulcanizes
[20:57] his soul hello somebody his soul with
[21:00] your soul the Master Creator that's the
[21:04] man that can produce anything that he
[21:06] says he's inside of you today about the
[21:08] new birth or he's not
[21:11] and I will put my spirit within you and
[21:13] cause you to want to come to church
[21:17] cause you to want to read your Bible
[21:19] cause you to want to do right
[21:25] we're going to read here in just a
[21:26] minute where we've been we've stopped at
[21:27] it for many many times about this statue
[21:30] of perfect man there in second Peter
[21:31] we'll read it if we get to it maybe this
[21:33] afternoon it'll be this afternoon sorry
[21:35] but we're a brother where brother Peter
[21:37] says that if you do these things it'll
[21:40] make you
[21:41] make you you can't help it
[21:44] that's what I want I want why I can't
[21:46] help it
[21:47] why do you praise the lord I can't help
[21:50] it
[21:53] why do you shout I can't help it
[21:56] there's something inside of me that says
[21:58] amen
[21:59] there's something inside of me said let
[22:01] me out
[22:03] and show the world go ahead because the
[22:05] world sees enough junk
[22:10] so I said before even even out in the
[22:13] world be kind to people
[22:15] be nice
[22:17] be nice this world is like Rob's head so
[22:20] cruel
[22:21] it is the most cruel wine because
[22:24] there's no spiritual Rudder there's no
[22:26] even in the churches there's no what
[22:28] they call Christianity Today would have
[22:30] never made it in an old-timey Church
[22:33] Never Would Have Made It they'd have
[22:35] called you a dog and a devil
[22:37] for what they call Christianity now
[22:41] are we caught up with it though are we
[22:44] cut up the same way
[22:49] and behold I send the promise of my
[22:51] father upon you but carry in ascended
[22:54] Jerusalem or Tarry wherever you want
[22:56] Terry Terry here until you be endued or
[23:00] put on like a garment now what did it
[23:03] say in Revelations 19 the bride has made
[23:05] herself ready in other words she has
[23:07] clothed herself
[23:09] listen the arbor meat packing guy did
[23:12] not come and close that woman that he
[23:14] went to pick up that's right
[23:17] she called herself
[23:19] she was waiting ready on the porch
[23:22] oh he's coming ah
[23:26] yeah y'all just as as mom was talking to
[23:30] somebody a doctor one time a doctor
[23:32] friend of hers and she's a a good
[23:34] Pentecostal lady but she said oh and
[23:37] this is to me just listen to what I'm
[23:38] saying she's looking at Mom and sees the
[23:40] Holiness and she sees that that Mom
[23:43] she's and she's supposed to be a
[23:44] Christian herself and she says oh you
[23:47] believe all the Bible
[23:49] foreign
[23:53] don't you believe are you a Christian
[23:57] but that's what the world is they look
[23:59] at you and they go oh you're from that
[24:01] Old Testament Bunch are you from that
[24:03] Old Pentecostal Bunch well praise God
[24:06] they saw a difference some of y'all
[24:07] maybe they won't even see a difference
[24:09] in but praise God if they do
[24:11] until you be endued or clothed with
[24:15] power or dunamis from on high and that
[24:19] dunamis is God's power and that dunamis
[24:23] is an inherent power it's something you
[24:26] get and keep
[24:29] now remember he gave them power see he
[24:32] gave Luther power he gave Wesley power
[24:35] come on people he even gave Columbus
[24:37] power he gave them power over evil
[24:41] spirits now this is a disciples before
[24:44] the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[24:46] Pentecost and Judas was standing there
[24:48] with him
[24:50] he gave them power or exosia which is a
[24:54] temporary power
[24:56] give it to you take it away from you
[24:57] give it to just like an anointing anoint
[25:00] you to do something and then take it
[25:02] right away from you cast out Devils heal
[25:04] all manner of sickness and all minor
[25:07] diseases he just he just laid the
[25:09] blanket out and said hey go
[25:11] and Judas was right there with him
[25:14] but Judas didn't carry on he didn't
[25:16] believe the word
[25:18] to its fullness
[25:20] but actually see a power will give you
[25:22] Authority
[25:24] all right but like brother Bob was
[25:25] saying man we've read it many many times
[25:27] but if you really just break it down
[25:29] that Pro that brother Brown said power
[25:31] without character
[25:34] so see God's not going to give you a
[25:36] whole bunch of power if he knows you're
[25:37] going to start zapping people out of the
[25:39] way you know
[25:40] cars would be driving by themselves I
[25:43] mean never mind
[25:44] do away with him Lord they cut me off
[25:47] and here goes the car with nobody in it
[25:52] my boss oh he's gone
[25:57] see that's power without character but
[25:59] Power with character you pray for the
[26:00] person because they don't know no better
[26:02] they haven't been taught have you ever
[26:04] invited them to church
[26:06] now you can you can get because you
[26:08] can't say Amen to that
[26:10] hmm
[26:14] have you invited them to church
[26:18] my enemies
[26:20] yeah remember I got two gay guys living
[26:22] beside me and I have invited them to
[26:24] church
[26:26] but you shall receive power after
[26:29] because remember before you're powerless
[26:34] you may have this great strength in this
[26:36] great ability
[26:38] Berkeley
[26:41] but without receiving power
[26:43] from on high or dunamis power
[26:47] you're just a wimp
[26:51] now look right let's see this right here
[26:54] and this is where I want to kind of I
[26:57] want to talk to us just a few minutes
[26:58] kind of a little side note
[27:02] and I'll read you a statement that that
[27:04] I believe the lord gave me while I was
[27:06] cutting grass brother Ryan I'm back on
[27:08] the lawnmower again but it's my personal
[27:09] one so I'm cutting my own grass but
[27:12] but the lord gave gave me a powerful
[27:15] statement
[27:16] and I'm gonna go ahead and state it to
[27:17] you and then I'll read it to you in just
[27:18] a minute
[27:19] but you know I was thinking I thought
[27:21] the devil's been doing this you know
[27:23] working in our
[27:25] communities and in our bodies
[27:28] making a sick making us backslide
[27:32] but do you know one thing's for sure I'm
[27:34] gonna read it to you
[27:36] after I read all this I'm gonna read it
[27:37] again
[27:42] read that
[27:48] and you're looking at us
[27:51] never
[27:53] never since Jesus Christ was on this
[27:56] Earth that Satan never had such a
[27:58] formidable opponent we have his answer
[28:00] yes sir
[28:02] he don't know how to deal with us but
[28:05] never before
[28:06] that's why it's a headstone message
[28:09] that's why the message had to come it
[28:11] brings Jesus Christ back to Earth in a
[28:14] bride not coming on White Horse
[28:17] that's Revelations 19 that's after
[28:19] everything's over with but anyway let's
[28:21] go back over here and then I'll read it
[28:23] to you again
[28:24] but I'm going to tell you how
[28:27] brother Brian said look
[28:30] Christ in the true church
[28:32] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[28:35] you say by the way what's this got to do
[28:36] with the Statue of perfect man has
[28:38] everything to do with it you got to
[28:40] realize who you are and what you're
[28:41] doing here you got to realize that God
[28:43] is working through your life
[28:46] bringing these virtues into your life
[28:48] not another group that's coming oh we're
[28:51] just setting groundwork listen there was
[28:53] somebody that did say one time I'm just
[28:55] setting groundwork
[28:59] this is the building
[29:01] this is not the groundwork
[29:03] this thing has come off the foundation
[29:06] and it's a building
[29:09] how to let the Antichrist Spirit would
[29:11] come into the church and defile it make
[29:13] it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[29:17] we see it everywhere
[29:20] listen listen revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:23] now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ
[29:25] is God
[29:27] Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus of
[29:29] the new no matter how hard you try you
[29:32] can't prove there's three gods
[29:34] but it also takes a revelation to make
[29:37] you understand that truth all right so
[29:40] it takes Revelation all right I mean how
[29:42] can you see this God that can be
[29:44] everywhere do everything be a father Son
[29:45] and Holy Ghost and be one person because
[29:47] see I can be a father a son and a human
[29:50] being but I can't be inside of you or I
[29:52] can't be in California I don't want to
[29:54] be in California I can't be in Alaska
[29:56] right but God can
[29:58] because he uh omnipotent I'm I'm the
[30:01] president omniscient he's all those he's
[30:03] God
[30:04] but it also takes a revelation by the
[30:07] Holy Spirit to make you understand the
[30:08] truth that he is one he takes a
[30:10] revelation to see that the Jehovah the
[30:12] old is the Jesus of the new
[30:14] Satan crept into the church
[30:16] and blinded the people to this truth
[30:20] Satan crept into the church
[30:24] and when they were blinded to it which
[30:27] means they accepted it it wasn't long
[30:30] until the Church of Rome stopped
[30:32] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:34] Christ
[30:35] are We Done Yet no watch this
[30:37] Resurrection 1953. see I don't want to
[30:40] blame you people it's the pulpits where
[30:42] it started
[30:46] no wonder that the damnation
[30:48] tree
[30:50] got in the pulpit
[30:52] it's the truth failing to preach the
[30:55] unadulterated word of God
[30:57] and the word of God will produce just
[31:00] exactly what it said it would do
[31:03] but we explain it all away
[31:07] I'll watch it for some other day ours
[31:10] for some other group
[31:13] hmm
[31:14] Masterpiece 1964. listen to this this is
[31:17] a good one now notice
[31:18] then this is my piece when Satan got a
[31:22] hold of it the deceiver he broke through
[31:24] the walls
[31:26] and he marred this masterpiece we know
[31:28] what he did
[31:30] because that that's the way he did it
[31:32] what how did he do it I'll go more in
[31:35] detail of it remember he's talking about
[31:37] the serpent Seed doctrine how he done it
[31:39] this masterpiece was wall
[31:41] by the by the word
[31:43] that's word
[31:44] and the masterpiece Excel itself
[31:48] of the family was fortified
[31:51] by his word
[31:53] all right remember Eve was Adam's bride
[31:57] in tight being the bride of Christ right
[32:00] she fell
[32:01] because she got out from behind the word
[32:03] of God but the broken part that was
[32:06] broken off of the original he's talking
[32:08] about Eve went out beyond that wall now
[32:11] we're talking about a church now not
[32:12] exactly just Eve we're talking about
[32:14] church
[32:15] went out beyond that wall it gives Satan
[32:19] a chance tomorrow
[32:20] and now as you know what I believe on
[32:22] these things to my serpent seed but
[32:24] watch but the great Sculptor
[32:27] thank God for a prophet
[32:29] he didn't leave us out somewhere he
[32:31] didn't throw us out in the ditch didn't
[32:32] leave us out on the limb no he gave us
[32:34] some rope to pull it back watch but the
[32:37] great sculptor when he seen the fall of
[32:39] his family the Masterpiece he wasn't
[32:42] willing just to leave it lay there
[32:46] face down and ruined
[32:49] he went to work
[32:52] immediately
[32:54] to build it up again
[32:56] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[32:58] lay there like that all the time
[33:01] because he is God and he will not be
[33:04] defeated
[33:05] I'll clap anyway
[33:09] be defeated
[33:10] so he went to work immediately and began
[33:13] to build again into his own image
[33:16] a man
[33:18] now we know who that man was it was
[33:20] Jesus Christ all right now look Harvest
[33:23] Time 1964 the prophet of God says then
[33:26] Eve met her failure
[33:28] so did the church now watch so did the
[33:30] Tea keeps saying church so did the
[33:32] church so did the church
[33:35] gave away the denomination rules of man
[33:38] to be ruled by man not controlled by the
[33:42] spirit no more
[33:44] she went away from the word and accepted
[33:46] dogmas who can say Amen congregation
[33:49] says amen but do you know
[33:51] even the Protestants accept as many
[33:53] dogmas as they got I'm talking to the
[33:56] message Believers today
[33:57] when we ask
[33:59] Ed this word or take something from it
[34:01] Satan got her with his same old
[34:04] technique he did Eve compromising
[34:11] that's where he got it and something
[34:14] different from the said something
[34:16] different from the word a Creed or
[34:19] denominations pergament Church age
[34:23] how can you tell the spirits apart so
[34:25] much of two spirits in the framework of
[34:26] the church just give them the word test
[34:29] if they don't speak that word they are
[34:32] of the evil one
[34:34] pay attention as the evil one deceived
[34:37] the first two Brides you said who is
[34:39] that Eve and Israel
[34:42] got it even Israel he had a divorce he
[34:45] had to put he had to put Israel away to
[34:47] get me and you now what have we done
[34:49] with it
[34:51] he will try to deceive the pride of this
[34:54] last day by trying to get her to
[34:57] hybridize herself through Creeds are
[34:59] just plainly turning from the word to
[35:02] any sign that suits her
[35:05] but God never placed signs ahead of the
[35:09] word
[35:11] signs follow the word
[35:14] as when Elijah took the woman told the
[35:16] woman to bake a cake for him first
[35:18] according to the word of the Lord when
[35:21] she did as the word said we ought to cry
[35:23] that sometime
[35:25] when she did as the word said the proper
[35:28] sign came
[35:30] to the word first and then watch the
[35:33] Miracles the seed word is energized by
[35:38] the spirit
[35:39] How can any messenger sent from God
[35:41] believe only a part of the word and deny
[35:44] some of it
[35:45] the true prophet of God in this last day
[35:49] will proclaim the whole word
[35:52] denominations will hate him praise God
[35:56] his words may be as harsh as John the
[35:58] Baptist who call them Vipers but the
[36:01] predestinated will hear
[36:05] and be ready
[36:07] for the rapture
[36:10] the Royal seat of Abraham was like Faith
[36:13] as Abraham will hold
[36:15] on to the word with him for they are
[36:17] predestinated
[36:19] together
[36:21] now in the first seal now he's coming to
[36:23] the seals now he's getting ready to the
[36:24] seals are getting ready to open and
[36:26] watch what he says
[36:28] now watch he said it would be known in
[36:30] the last days but it comes forth in a
[36:31] church symbol do you understand it
[36:34] Church
[36:35] it comes forth in a symbol of a church
[36:37] that they though know there is a seal
[36:40] but just what it is yet they don't know
[36:42] because it's a white horse rider and it
[36:46] only is to be revealed at the last day
[36:48] when this actual seal is broken broken
[36:51] to who not to Christ but to the church
[36:56] he keeps saying church but now watch
[36:58] notice oh my that just makes me tremble
[37:01] I hope that the church truly understands
[37:03] this he want to mean you people he stops
[37:07] he stops something strikes him and he
[37:10] says I'm going to call you Brian that
[37:12] you'll understand it
[37:13] I'm gonna call you Brian in other words
[37:15] I'm gonna separate you from all this
[37:18] I've been talking about a church
[37:20] because out of the church will come
[37:21] abroad
[37:24] I'm going to call you bride see that
[37:26] you'll understand it well who's going to
[37:28] understand it just the bride
[37:33] Christ's mystery God reveal listen this
[37:35] then we stand justified in the presence
[37:38] of God
[37:39] as a drop of ink dropping into a tub
[37:41] full of bleach you'll never find the
[37:43] statement stainless that ain't no more
[37:45] how many believes that
[37:47] you better than you still got your sin
[37:51] it went somewhere
[37:53] it'll never come back again
[37:56] and when man is truly redeemed that
[37:59] predestinated seed that sees it
[38:02] and accepts it
[38:05] sins are demolished
[38:07] it's gone it's separated it's dropping
[38:10] the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ
[38:11] never to be remembered God forgets it
[38:16] and he stands as a son and daughter of
[38:18] God in the presence of God Amen and amen
[38:20] now we are the sons of God not we will
[38:23] be we are now we are redeemed now listen
[38:25] to this we have Satan's answer yes sir
[38:28] there's your answer
[38:31] we're an opponent that he can't stand
[38:33] but we're an opponent that's not going
[38:36] to fail
[38:39] God has Vindicated himself
[38:41] God proves himself to This Promise in
[38:45] this day Hallelujah the headship is here
[38:49] talk about the opening of the seals amen
[38:51] Christ the Risen Lord is hearing the
[38:54] same power of his resurrection that he
[38:56] ever was manifesting himself there's the
[39:00] devil's answer
[39:01] Oneness 1962 love this sermon
[39:08] the kingdom of God
[39:09] is the word of God
[39:11] made back in power
[39:13] we look for all kinds of the kingdom of
[39:15] God the kingdom of God is the word of
[39:17] God Made Back
[39:19] into power so that's my statement I was
[39:21] thinking I thought never since Jesus
[39:23] Christ was on Earth has Satan had such a
[39:25] formidable opponent
[39:27] he swept a lot of good people
[39:30] sorry
[39:32] that all those people are waiting on us
[39:35] some under false Doctrine
[39:38] hello
[39:40] but they're waiting on the perfect one
[39:41] well see remember the Old Testament was
[39:43] waiting on the perfect one too right
[39:45] Jesus Christ well when he showed up
[39:47] there was the perfect one
[39:50] so now where is he at now
[39:53] oh no he's stealing back there in the
[39:54] church ages or he's in heaven or he's
[39:56] over there somewhere no he's in his
[39:58] bride he's not in a church he's in a
[40:00] bride all right
[40:02] so never
[40:04] had Satan had such a formidable opponent
[40:06] then the Bride of Jesus Christ do you
[40:09] believe that
[40:10] I did I did circles in the yard
[40:17] when you try to put the holy spirit in a
[40:19] denomination
[40:21] you can't get a splutter
[40:24] or sputter you'll ruin your engine by
[40:27] getting it full of carbon
[40:29] but oh I'm so glad that there's a ten
[40:31] thousand octane power the word of God
[40:34] and the Holy Ghost to light it up you
[40:37] gotta have the two
[40:39] and to resurrect the power of God into a
[40:42] man's life our woman's life or into a
[40:46] church
[40:47] that shoved that Cadillac down the road
[40:49] under the dynamic power of the Holy
[40:51] Ghost which came back and was waived
[40:53] over the people at the day of Pentecost
[40:55] that's 2000 years ago making him the
[40:58] same yesterday today and forever
[41:01] yes sir that was the first Chief come up
[41:04] from all the prophets
[41:06] which was the Son of God the king of all
[41:08] Prophets
[41:10] we quoted this many times but I believe
[41:12] it more and more today there have been
[41:14] churches churches
[41:16] Brides
[41:17] Brides there's been a bride in every age
[41:21] all right it's been a bride and every
[41:22] age seven of them Seven Ages is already
[41:24] almost passed the seventh one
[41:26] Brides brides churches Brides brides
[41:32] has got to come one
[41:35] there's got to come one Hallelujah there
[41:38] has to come a real bride
[41:42] that one that has not only mechanics but
[41:45] Dynamics
[41:47] makes that church live move in the power
[41:50] of his resurrection
[41:52] I pray that that's our our goal our goal
[41:56] is not to sit in a garage
[42:01] Hallelujah
[42:04] and rust and rot
[42:08] until we come to that place until we
[42:11] find that place what good does it do the
[42:13] Polish the hubs
[42:15] in other words what good does he do for
[42:17] you to come to church if you're not
[42:18] going to do what the word says
[42:20] and the ones of you that don't come to
[42:22] church every once in a while
[42:23] you get born again
[42:25] what good does it do to give her a
[42:27] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[42:30] no Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[42:33] mechanics proves to be right their highs
[42:35] got to be a dynamic to make it work
[42:40] Revelations 10 7 says but in the days of
[42:42] The Voice
[42:44] of the seventh angel
[42:46] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[42:48] of God should be finished as he hath
[42:50] declared in other words a voice
[42:53] has declared to his servants the
[42:55] prophets and The Voice
[42:58] which I heard from Heaven speak unto me
[43:00] again The Voice
[43:06] to this message
[43:08] this message has give us a voice
[43:16] there's been many voices many brides
[43:18] many churches
[43:20] many denominations
[43:23] but there's one remember
[43:25] that's why it's a mystery you got to
[43:27] hear the voice to get the mystery all
[43:29] right everybody with me
[43:33] because you got to take let's take Paul
[43:34] for a minute we've we've went through
[43:36] this many times but
[43:38] Paul goes and he's getting ready to just
[43:40] destroy the Christians he's on his horse
[43:43] he's on his high horse
[43:45] and he's heading towards on the Damascus
[43:47] Road he's heading to put Christians in
[43:49] jail and to cause them to blaspheme to
[43:51] kill him right
[43:52] all of a sudden there's a bright light
[43:55] knocks him off his horse
[43:58] but there's a voice that speaks to Paul
[44:02] Paul or Saul he said at the time saw
[44:06] Saul why you persecuting me now the
[44:08] Bible tells us in several
[44:11] scenarios same way with Jesus when there
[44:14] was a voice from Heaven said many heard
[44:16] the Thunder many Saw the Light
[44:19] many heard something
[44:22] but they didn't hear the voice Paul
[44:23] heard
[44:25] Paul heard the voice
[44:28] listen
[44:29] others heard other things
[44:32] is that what we've been doing for 60
[44:33] years
[44:34] hearing other things
[44:36] because I remember we're out here in
[44:38] Revelations 19 there was a promise that
[44:40] that voice was going to take us and make
[44:41] us the bride mature bride all right
[44:46] so in a sermon or you watch or listen to
[44:49] a tape it doesn't matter no matter how
[44:52] loud I can scream
[44:56] only the elect is going to hear the
[44:57] voice of God
[45:01] as we've said before many people y'all
[45:03] all set in meetings and I told you we
[45:05] said well I don't mean meetings I mean
[45:07] right now
[45:08] there's you're going to get 15 minutes
[45:10] of sermon you're going to get your 15.
[45:12] everybody's going to get there different
[45:14] what you need
[45:16] of a sermon
[45:19] but how many people
[45:21] hear the full word of the day
[45:25] and it impacts them that way
[45:30] you think about it you don't have to hey
[45:32] man you can owe me all you want to if
[45:33] you won't do that that's fine but only a
[45:36] few
[45:37] hear the word for their day
[45:41] others just hear a voice
[45:44] a voice
[45:46] it says in the days of The Voice
[45:51] you and I have heard if you've heard the
[45:54] word of God for the end time you've
[45:56] heard the voice of God
[45:59] why did we need it
[46:01] we needed it for maturity
[46:04] Brides brides voices voices voices
[46:07] voices but there's one
[46:10] you better decide whether you're hearing
[46:12] the right Voice or not it doesn't matter
[46:14] if it comes from me brother Bob brother
[46:15] Aaron doesn't make that the vessel at
[46:18] that moment doesn't matter
[46:22] and I heard it as it were the voice
[46:25] of a great multitude now John is typing
[46:28] who the bride he hears a voice
[46:32] and then the voice of many Waters and
[46:35] then the voice of mighty thunderings
[46:38] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[46:39] omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and
[46:42] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[46:44] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[46:47] wife hath made herself ready
[46:50] and to her was granted that she should
[46:52] be a raid and fine linen clean and white
[46:54] for the fine linen is a righteousness of
[46:57] the Saints
[46:59] listen to this real quick
[47:01] 1961 the comforter we have a great
[47:04] heritage
[47:06] a great sacred Trust
[47:08] that's been given us
[47:11] you might wonder now brother Brian
[47:13] you're talking about sunshine great
[47:15] Sunshine of God's glory to make Healthy
[47:18] Spirits to make us strong Christians
[47:21] that's what we're here to find out
[47:23] tonight in other words
[47:25] how do we get these things how do they
[47:27] come where do they come from what are
[47:29] they
[47:30] show me what it is brother Brandon can I
[47:32] buy it at the drugstore
[47:34] what kind of a vitamin is it
[47:36] you don't buy this in a drugstore
[47:39] but there is plenty of it right close to
[47:42] you
[47:43] if you'll just receive it
[47:45] it's just knowing the formula
[47:48] how to receive it
[47:50] there'd be drugs in a drugstore which
[47:51] has got to be a doctor
[47:53] you don't just walk in a drugstore and
[47:55] say hey give me some you know on that
[47:57] wallet give me some of them pills
[48:00] no you have a prescription right what is
[48:03] that prescription that is your
[48:04] protection
[48:06] because the doctors diagnosed your case
[48:08] he has found out what needs to be done
[48:10] he writes not 45 different voices I mean
[48:14] prescriptions
[48:16] uh right
[48:18] usually they'll just give you one per
[48:20] cheap
[48:22] right
[48:23] so that's what you've been given
[48:26] and watch
[48:28] there'd be drugs in a drugstore but
[48:30] there's got to be a doctor to diagnose
[48:31] the case if he didn't
[48:34] it might kill you
[48:35] so therefore you've got to have a
[48:37] diagnosis of the case
[48:40] you just can't go and take a center and
[48:42] give him the Holy Ghost
[48:46] he's got to repent first
[48:49] he's got to be washed his sins away he's
[48:52] got to be prepared for this vitamin
[48:55] that's going to be given him
[48:59] now we have a sacred Trust
[49:01] you know what a trust is
[49:03] we have an inheritance a Heritage that
[49:06] we inherit as believing children
[49:10] it's a sacred trust and that sacred
[49:13] trust and our sacred heritage
[49:15] look it's the word of God
[49:19] that's not been given to Luther
[49:22] but it's been given to us
[49:25] the full word of God
[49:28] the word itself is the vitamin the word
[49:31] itself God's word that's where a reason
[49:34] I'm so dogmatic as I would call it on
[49:37] standing on this word no matter what
[49:39] anything else says if it's not with a
[49:42] word I don't believe it
[49:44] see if you want to believe it that's all
[49:46] right but to me it takes the word
[49:48] because heaven and earth will pass away
[49:50] but my word shall never fail therefore
[49:53] it takes the word then we're coming to
[49:56] the Token because we're coming up statue
[49:58] of perfect man and we can display the
[50:00] token of the Holy Spirit shows that we
[50:02] have been accepted in Christ and our
[50:04] token that all that we have need of is
[50:07] already purchased by him yes
[50:10] we are identified with our token the
[50:14] token must be ready
[50:16] the blood Covenant blood is not
[50:20] recognized without the token now he's
[50:23] going to tell us what the token is
[50:25] the word assures us of that promise
[50:28] the token is the sign
[50:31] what is the token
[50:34] the two pieces of paper
[50:37] you in the two pieces of paper fit
[50:39] together
[50:40] they fit right back together just like
[50:42] that all right the token is to sign the
[50:44] purchase has been made for us full
[50:46] obedience watch this is where my thought
[50:49] was talking about the full word of God
[50:51] full obedience to part of the word of
[50:54] God that's not entitle us to the Token
[50:56] of the end time
[50:58] but full obedience to the full word of
[51:01] God
[51:02] that's why we don't live in the Old
[51:04] Testament
[51:05] we live in both of them
[51:10] the full word of God yes what happened
[51:13] in the Garden of Eden we know what
[51:15] Abraham did body change we've got all
[51:18] these great Revelations what are we
[51:20] doing with it
[51:21] you sit here half asleep that's what
[51:23] you're doing with it
[51:26] grief
[51:29] you're setting up your favorite Netflix
[51:31] would that brother say series was on
[51:35] no other way is there that you could
[51:37] ever look be entitled
[51:40] to the token
[51:41] until you fully
[51:44] obey the word
[51:45] fully not what somebody has put into it
[51:49] and add it to it but what what God said
[51:52] about it
[51:53] when he said you must be born again that
[51:56] don't mean jump up and down at the altar
[51:58] that don't mean walk back then shake
[52:00] hands with the pastor
[52:01] that don't mean all this foolishness
[52:03] that we've seen done boy he's pretty
[52:05] plain isn't he it don't mean putting
[52:08] your name on a church book it means
[52:10] death to your first big and Life to your
[52:14] second being
[52:16] it means that the blood has been applied
[52:18] and you're identified by the life of
[52:21] Jesus Christ and if he be divine then we
[52:23] be the branches the life that's in the
[52:25] branch is in the vine it bears
[52:28] the fruit amen so I want to ask you a
[52:32] question today
[52:33] let's stand our feet
[52:37] y'all can't stay awake we'll just close
[52:40] and it came to pass it while Apollos was
[52:42] at Corinth Paul having passed through
[52:43] the upper Coast came to Ephesus and
[52:46] finding certain disciples he said unto
[52:47] them
[52:48] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[52:50] you started believing this message
[52:53] and they said unto him we have not so
[52:55] much as heard whether they be
[52:57] a Holy Ghost
[52:58] you can't say that
[53:01] you can't say that
[53:05] Ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no corrupt
[53:07] communication proceed out of your mouth
[53:09] but that which is good the use of
[53:10] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[53:13] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[53:15] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[53:17] unto the day of your Redemption let all
[53:19] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[53:21] clamor evil speaking be put away from
[53:22] you with all malice be kind one to
[53:25] another as brother Bob had that list up
[53:27] there it's just a reverse of what people
[53:30] are in the end time
[53:31] I mean a total reverse of this world and
[53:34] even their thinking all right
[53:36] be put away from you with all malice and
[53:39] be your kind one to another
[53:40] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[53:42] for even as God for Christ's sake
[53:45] has forgiven you
[53:47] then I'll stop right here musicians come
[53:49] on possession the enemies Gates
[53:52] brother Brown said now be real Reverend
[53:53] everybody now just be a real reverent
[53:55] we've been we've already read this quote
[53:57] and we'll read it again
[53:59] because I I believe in the moving of God
[54:02] but I believe in the movement of God as
[54:04] brother Branham believed in the moving
[54:06] of God
[54:07] be still be quiet
[54:10] let God Speak
[54:12] see the holy spirit is so timid how many
[54:15] knows that just real timid Holy Spirit
[54:17] just any little interruption
[54:21] bothers him
[54:24] you won't bother the Holy Spirit
[54:27] interrupt him every once in a while
[54:30] we'll talk about the rest of the gifts
[54:32] going up the statue of perfect man but I
[54:34] want you to see Paul even Jesus you know
[54:38] the song Heard it thunder some heard
[54:41] many different things some saw many
[54:43] different things
[54:44] but God didn't specif didn't come down
[54:47] and just you know if you would have been
[54:48] uh they probably now I say this just
[54:51] probably Moses is walking home with his
[54:54] stick in his hand he's 80 years old he's
[54:56] walking home through the desert and he
[54:58] looks out there and there's a
[55:00] bush
[55:02] and it's just burning red
[55:04] it's just like it's burning up well they
[55:07] may have been Shepherds and all kind of
[55:08] people around different places and they
[55:11] may have looked at it and thought man
[55:12] this is that thing's going to burn up
[55:14] and turn around walked off
[55:17] but Moses something drew Moses
[55:20] Moses got close to it and
[55:23] the bush spoke to him
[55:25] nobody else heard that voice
[55:28] to Moses
[55:30] take off your shoes
[55:32] right then you know when somebody tells
[55:35] you to take your shoes off that's
[55:37] somebody in Authority that's not
[55:39] somebody just hiding behind the bush
[55:41] that's God
[55:43] and he did everything God told him to do
[55:45] take his shoes off not remember brother
[55:47] round said God would have never spoke to
[55:49] Moses if he said now now Lord It's Hot
[55:51] this this Sans hot I think I'll just
[55:53] take my hat off
[55:55] no God said take your shoes off you take
[55:57] your shoes off
[55:59] God tells us to do the things of God we
[56:02] should better start doing the things of
[56:03] god let's sing a song God bless you
[56:05] we'll start this afternoon

[59:30] tell me when when they shall be
[59:37] we thank God for the light
[59:40] have you ever seen if you ever went and
[59:41] seen we saw lighthouses out in uh in uh
[59:44] when we were in Ohio
[59:47] you know it's there for a purpose
[59:49] they don't just stick them out there to
[59:51] look pretty
[59:52] back before there was any communication
[59:54] at all
[59:55] that's how they communicated
[59:57] [Music]
[59:58] that light would go off and it would say
[1:00:01] danger there's rocks right here as far
[1:00:03] as you can see don't come closer
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:06] do we pay attention to the lighthouse
[1:00:09] because if you don't pay attention to
[1:00:10] the lighthouse you will have a wreck
[1:00:12] and we don't want to be a wreck
[1:00:15] listen this life is hard enough as it is
[1:00:17] let's don't make it any harder
[1:00:19] but you're the bride
[1:00:21] you've been called not a church anymore
[1:00:23] you've been called a bride you've been
[1:00:25] called to be clothed you've called to be
[1:00:28] special
[1:00:29] now not that we make ourselves special
[1:00:32] but God said I read you everything
[1:00:34] brother I'm saying everything he said in
[1:00:36] the Bible it's pointing toward a
[1:00:38] word-born bride as brother Ram talks
[1:00:40] about
[1:00:41] a full word born bride not just pieces
[1:00:44] and parts
[1:00:45] this is going to be a full unit that's
[1:00:47] going to leave this place
[1:00:49] and Satan ain't gonna know what to do
[1:00:51] with us he don't know what to do with us
[1:00:53] now he puts you down a flick just sends
[1:00:55] you to the doctor sends you to sickness
[1:00:57] and sends you to to hurting and
[1:00:59] everything else and you just say
[1:01:03] thank you Lord
[1:01:05] somebody's praying for me then you see
[1:01:07] it then then Satan he out of left field
[1:01:10] as you may say Satan feels that power
[1:01:12] coming to smacks him right upside the
[1:01:14] head because he's looking at you
[1:01:16] but there's Saints All Around the World
[1:01:18] praying and here comes the Power
[1:01:21] here comes the healing power and I
[1:01:24] knocks him flat on his face I thank God
[1:01:27] for that I thank God for the power he's
[1:01:30] give the bride that we can pray and be
[1:01:31] confident not just pray but be confident
[1:01:33] that he's going to do what he said he
[1:01:34] would do let's bow our heads dear Lord
[1:01:37] thank you for this day thank you for the
[1:01:38] time that we have
[1:01:40] the coming together of the of the Bride
[1:01:43] of Jesus Christ Lord we believe what a
[1:01:46] prophet said he stood one day and he
[1:01:47] said there's Brides brides churches
[1:01:50] Brides Luther's Wesley Pentecost
[1:01:54] uh all down Through the Ages
