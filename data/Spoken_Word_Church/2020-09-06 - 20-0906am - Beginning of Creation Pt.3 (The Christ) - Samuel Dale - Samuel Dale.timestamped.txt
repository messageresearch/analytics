[27:35] they said some say thou art john the
[27:37] baptist some
[27:39] elise and others jeremiahs are one of
[27:42] the prophets
[27:43] he said unto them but whom say ye that i
[27:46] am
[27:47] and simon peter answered and said unto
[27:49] him thou art the christ
[27:51] the son of the living god all right
[27:55] and jesus answered and said unto him
[27:57] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[28:00] and blood hath not revealed
[28:02] it unto thee but my father which is in
[28:05] heaven
[28:06] and i say also unto thee
[28:10] that thou art peter and upon this rock
[28:13] will i build my church
[28:14] in the gates of hell shall not prevail
[28:17] against it now remember
[28:19] that's what we're bringing it to
[28:21] eventually
[28:22] coming to the point of the bride of
[28:24] christ in the position
[28:25] okay now we'll go to john
[28:30] 3 16. for god so loved the world that he
[28:33] gave his only begotten son
[28:35] now remember his only begotten
[28:39] all right now that means the only one
[28:42] ever begotten that away
[28:45] adam was begotten in the bases
[28:48] that he was created
[28:52] jesus was not begotten in the fact of
[28:55] being created that way
[28:57] he was born from a woman and it was to
[29:00] be in that place in a position so
[29:02] just keep that in mind that we get to
[29:03] that place now only begotten
[29:06] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[29:09] not
[29:09] perish but have everlasting life for god
[29:12] sent not his son into the world to
[29:13] condemn the world
[29:15] but that the world through him might be
[29:16] saved he that believeth on him
[29:19] is not condemned but he that believeth
[29:20] not is condemned already
[29:22] because he hath not believed in the name
[29:26] of the only begotten son of god
[29:29] you may be seated the lord at his
[29:31] blessing to the reading of the word
[29:34] so we will try to have that way
[29:38] we're announcing it ahead of time and
[29:39] all we will try to have
[29:41] communion next uh sunday
[29:44] and all and get back in because i hate
[29:47] to when we can't have the services
[29:49] and things the way that we need to but
[29:52] you have to do the best you can
[29:54] to get by you know we could say well
[29:57] we're just going to do this we're going
[29:58] to do that but that's
[29:59] there's no need of doing that we just
[30:01] continue right along
[30:02] and everything will work out and god
[30:04] will work it out
[30:06] so we're to come to the right place you
[30:08] know in the right time
[30:09] all right now what are we talking about
[30:12] the beginning
[30:13] of creation now title that because of
[30:17] the quote the prophet made in
[30:18] the message but we're reading about
[30:21] where the beginning
[30:22] of the creation of god well right now
[30:25] uh we're we're using the title this is
[30:28] part three
[30:29] of beginning of creation because that
[30:33] way it's not just speaking
[30:35] of one thing it's the speaking of the
[30:37] beginning of the creation
[30:39] of god to come forth as the great
[30:42] jehovah god
[30:44] and thank all of that then it comes into
[30:46] the beginning of the creation of god
[30:49] because you've got to come into this
[30:50] spiritual creation
[30:53] of the son of god and then we'll come
[30:55] over to the church
[30:56] so we're getting it and see that's why
[30:58] i'm using it instead of
[30:59] trying to say the beginning of the
[31:01] creation of god
[31:03] because that's uh that's just bringing
[31:05] it down to a
[31:06] technical point now that we have spoken
[31:10] to
[31:10] services already about this and we'll
[31:13] really view a little bit
[31:16] of the message this morning you know in
[31:19] in our doing
[31:20] all right beginning of creation
[31:24] what is the beginning that was our life
[31:26] service
[31:28] what is the beginning what does
[31:30] beginning mean
[31:31] you say well it just means it starts
[31:34] well those things are human
[31:37] terminologies
[31:39] but not the biblical form of what we're
[31:42] to
[31:42] understand or the the uh the way that
[31:45] god wants us to bring it
[31:47] see and and we've tried to emphasize it
[31:49] over and over that
[31:51] beginning is not we think it's a
[31:53] starting point
[31:56] well that's not said those are okay all
[31:58] of those form
[31:59] but that's not the work the way that you
[32:02] understand things
[32:03] in the biblical form or understanding
[32:07] all right because you're dealing with
[32:10] the beginning of the creation of god and
[32:12] you
[32:12] you keep coming down to where that
[32:14] you're you're coming down to where we
[32:15] are
[32:17] and in doing that it's not it's not just
[32:21] a starting point
[32:23] because what we're doing is we're
[32:24] finding out that
[32:26] uh to me i like it this way i wrote it
[32:28] down to where i'd remember it this way
[32:31] see to me when you talk about the
[32:33] beginning like i'm trying to bring
[32:36] out of what i'm speaking about and
[32:39] trying to
[32:39] quote the things of the prophet and
[32:41] bring it out the way he's saying it
[32:44] is when something comes forth
[32:48] in another form in other words you got
[32:52] it in a form
[32:54] it's in a form all right there's a form
[32:57] there
[32:58] all right but then you can say the
[32:59] beginning of the creation of god you say
[33:01] all right now
[33:02] in another form
[33:05] but it's the same person
[33:09] in another form we're going to be going
[33:11] through the and that's what i'm driving
[33:13] out of the godhead
[33:14] for us to understand what it is see
[33:17] because we're going to be dealing today
[33:19] with like
[33:20] immorphy or the change or the christ
[33:23] to where that we can try to get into
[33:25] that point but it's when
[33:26] something comes forth in another form
[33:31] to make known
[33:34] right and really now listen this may
[33:37] sound funny but listen to my
[33:39] my thinking when something comes forth
[33:43] in another form
[33:45] what it does it makes known the original
[33:49] form
[33:52] that's kind of just let that kind of
[33:55] dwell in your thinking for a little bit
[33:57] that it's it's not a uh
[34:01] doing away with this and coming over
[34:03] here
[34:05] see that's what we think about we get
[34:07] those things in line but that's not the
[34:09] point
[34:09] see my point is when something will come
[34:11] forth in another form
[34:14] all right it doesn't do away with the
[34:17] original form
[34:19] it enhances or magnifies
[34:22] or or makes it to come out into view to
[34:25] where that you can really begin to see
[34:28] all right and it it it
[34:31] takes that no makes that known or
[34:34] reveals
[34:37] what's there see you could never see
[34:40] the bride of christ and who she is
[34:45] unless you had some background
[34:49] to see how all of that come forth so you
[34:52] just say well where's the bride of
[34:53] christ where
[34:54] no see this what i'm talking about
[34:58] goes all the way back into eternity and
[35:01] comes out from that
[35:02] in the position or situation to express
[35:07] the the the way god wanted it expressed
[35:11] all right what's been our thought we're
[35:13] brother branham on questions and answers
[35:15] says
[35:16] god's first creation was himself
[35:21] well that's odd speaking but if you'll
[35:24] think about what he's saying
[35:25] it's not odd see
[35:28] if you'll think of the point that he's
[35:30] saying because what he's saying
[35:32] is something is going to come forth
[35:37] and you say well it had a beginning it
[35:39] had a beginning when it started coming
[35:41] forth
[35:42] but as it comes forth to fulfill that
[35:44] part
[35:46] there it will be then there'll be more
[35:48] to unfold
[35:50] or change a form me
[35:53] and you can begin to see see then that
[35:55] way is my point of why
[35:57] first we see god
[36:00] all right now you're talking about
[36:01] jehovah god elohim self-existing
[36:05] first we see that we see him as he's
[36:08] there
[36:09] all right we have to see him by the eye
[36:11] of faith because we cannot see
[36:14] baptized our natural eyesight
[36:17] so by the eye of faith we see the great
[36:20] supernatural
[36:21] eternal elohim the self-existing one
[36:24] all right but he never had a beginning
[36:29] now he had a beginning in the basis that
[36:32] there was a time
[36:33] he changed his form from one form to
[36:37] another
[36:37] form and as he does that makes him come
[36:41] into manifestation just like
[36:43] well there was a time there brother ray
[36:44] he was just a little
[36:46] little kid running around all right he
[36:48] he had that form that was his
[36:50] form that was the way he was manifesting
[36:53] but see then one day become a teenager
[36:55] one day become
[36:56] all right one day he become married
[36:59] let's see and that made him a husband
[37:04] but did it change his form
[37:08] it didn't change the form of him it's
[37:11] the same person
[37:13] all right see then one day from that
[37:15] wedding that
[37:16] he got married and become you know
[37:18] husband
[37:20] then next you see that he's father
[37:24] all right what has happened it's not
[37:26] another person
[37:28] and he's not a beginning it's uh the
[37:30] beginning part of it all
[37:32] only thing is is it says well okay
[37:35] he couldn't have been a father all the
[37:37] time because he was a child
[37:39] so then that way we understand the
[37:42] terminologies and get into it
[37:44] in in knowing the bible see but there's
[37:47] a day came that he became a granddaddy
[37:51] what is that another form but the same
[37:55] person
[37:58] the all right father son and holy ghost
[38:00] is the same
[38:01] person being made known
[38:04] in a a form all right
[38:09] that he is see and then morphe a form
[38:13] okay so now his first creation
[38:16] was god himself now this we're talking
[38:20] about
[38:20] is the spiritual creation we're not
[38:23] talking about natural things we're not
[38:25] into that yet so
[38:26] hold that point keep this in mind line
[38:29] it across
[38:30] i have not deliberately spoke
[38:34] anything about the flesh man i had to to
[38:37] show the background and the thought
[38:38] but my mind has not been on the fleshly
[38:41] part of the lord jesus christ
[38:46] neither has it been on the fact of god
[38:50] having a bodily form
[38:54] that would be humanly fleshly
[38:59] my whole thoughts has been on the
[39:01] spiritual
[39:03] part the coming forth of god to where
[39:07] that man could comprehend him
[39:10] all right and in doing that he has to do
[39:13] it this way you say
[39:15] no i i think you already done it well
[39:17] now you go talk to him about that
[39:19] because i'm just going to make it plain
[39:22] this is the way he said it
[39:25] and this is the only way it can be done
[39:28] you can fuss with him about what you
[39:29] think he ought to done
[39:31] but i'm not going to fuss with him i'm
[39:32] going to just say this is the way
[39:35] in other words he had to come this way
[39:37] to come down the stages or steps or form
[39:40] or in morphes or whatever to bring
[39:43] himself out into the open
[39:44] to where that he could be comprehended
[39:49] because remember what we brought out
[39:52] in in the lord jesus in the last message
[39:54] we dealt a lot about
[39:55] the how that he declared him
[39:59] he brought him out in the open he shone
[40:02] the father
[40:04] all right but still in doing that
[40:06] mankind couldn't understand because
[40:08] they couldn't follow that line all right
[40:12] but you see you and i are not in those
[40:14] days a word that we shouldn't understand
[40:16] we should understand
[40:19] by having the prophet's message to be
[40:21] able to to study from we should have a
[40:24] whole lot better understanding or
[40:26] opportunity
[40:27] to comprehend what is being done
[40:31] all right see then for him to say that
[40:34] god's first creation was himself
[40:36] that wasn't something that he didn't
[40:38] exist
[40:39] and then he came into existence no it's
[40:42] how that he existed
[40:43] in another form
[40:46] he existed in another form
[40:49] then he comes forth see
[40:52] changing his form not his person not his
[40:56] personality not his do it
[40:58] see the one true and living god it's the
[41:01] main thing i'm trying to get us all to
[41:03] see
[41:03] is to study in that because it'll it'll
[41:05] help us
[41:06] and keep it lined up so he's
[41:10] he wasn't non-existent as far well
[41:13] god just wasn't and well he was just a
[41:15] spirit well remember
[41:17] when you're talking about god and you
[41:20] say he's just a spirit don't use that
[41:22] word just
[41:23] just say he's a spirit leave it that way
[41:25] because when you say he's just
[41:27] you're taking away you're making him not
[41:32] being you're making the spirit man not
[41:34] be anything
[41:36] now remember the spirit being is what we
[41:38] were talking about in the last message
[41:40] and what was it he
[41:43] came forth and made known the father
[41:48] all right now so then he never done away
[41:52] with the father
[41:55] he unveils him he unshows him or reveals
[41:58] him or makes him known
[42:01] and that's what he's been doing so he's
[42:02] been changing his form
[42:06] from the point that something that could
[42:09] not be seen
[42:12] or understood then
[42:15] by the changing of his form
[42:19] then he could show what he was and to
[42:22] change his form
[42:23] he would have to change his form like
[42:25] brother ray as i said he changed his
[42:27] form now you can understand
[42:31] see you can understand
[42:35] that there he was all the time
[42:39] the same person but he's made
[42:43] manifest in more ways or different ways
[42:46] are changing his form
[42:48] all right and see now to do those things
[42:51] then see here comes kathy she has to fit
[42:54] into
[42:55] the picture as well as brother ray did
[42:58] because the day he married see he took
[43:01] another
[43:04] person into his uh
[43:08] showing of himself or are revealing
[43:12] himself see another person got involved
[43:14] that's how we do
[43:15] right that's where we'll get to that and
[43:17] we'll see that when it comes to the
[43:19] bride of christ
[43:20] see she's not a she's not another person
[43:24] she's part of him all right
[43:27] made manifest in another form as we'd
[43:30] say
[43:31] called a bride
[43:34] so don't forget what our point is to try
[43:37] to understand
[43:38] why we'll talk about in the beginning
[43:41] was the word
[43:42] the word was with god and the word was
[43:44] god
[43:46] in the beginning were
[43:49] where did that start or what happened
[43:52] what would be the beginning
[43:54] see and find out these things then
[43:57] will come unveiling be start
[44:00] unveiling to us to where we can see it
[44:04] all right so he was the first now here's
[44:08] here's one that we're going to get down
[44:09] to it
[44:10] when we get to the bride form you'll
[44:12] really this statement will come into
[44:14] view
[44:15] a whole lot more that he becomes more
[44:17] involved
[44:20] it takes more to reveal him in other
[44:22] words that's right
[44:23] that's right what are we doing today
[44:25] we're supposed to be making him known
[44:28] that's the bride she's making him known
[44:34] but not doing away with him
[44:37] it just takes all of the things that god
[44:41] has to unveil
[44:43] for us to be able to see and as i'm said
[44:46] about it then
[44:47] you you study uh eternity goes this far
[44:50] that way as it goes that way
[44:53] it's all right see we're not going back
[44:55] until it becomes a non-existent
[44:59] the further we go that way the more
[45:00] comes into view the further we go that
[45:02] way the more comes into view
[45:04] it doesn't end it just makes that circle
[45:08] and connects it together
[45:09] and we'll see what we're doing here
[45:13] and the purpose in life of what we're
[45:15] doing all right we get the point now so
[45:18] the first creation
[45:22] that we talk about of the creation of
[45:24] god
[45:25] first creation was god himself now
[45:28] remember you've got to stay
[45:30] on the point here of a spiritual
[45:32] creation
[45:34] amen because you're not trying to make
[45:37] him a physical creation
[45:39] because that's what the prophet remember
[45:40] i gave you the quotes i'll give it back
[45:42] in a minute
[45:42] he said god never come in a body bodily
[45:45] form
[45:48] he said god can't be seen he said
[45:51] because god is a spirit
[45:54] see you had to wait six thousand
[45:57] i mean four thousand years as i was
[45:59] trying to explain the other day
[46:01] to come to the bases that he could step
[46:03] on earth in the human flesh
[46:06] sure all right we know that he appeared
[46:08] back there
[46:09] in many ways because that's the christ
[46:14] and the prophet said you say well he
[46:16] never come in human flesh before he said
[46:18] yes he did
[46:19] that he is in human flesh in melchizedek
[46:22] okay
[46:22] now then but what's melchizedek
[46:26] a form of god an amorphy
[46:30] and bringing god out into the open that
[46:33] it could be seen that's what the whole
[46:34] situation about it is
[46:36] the whole thing is studying the word of
[46:38] god to see god as he brings itself
[46:41] from the point of where that we can't
[46:43] comprehend him
[46:46] we can't understand him
[46:49] see i remember that and i i hope you
[46:51] would remember how that you first maybe
[46:53] started thinking about
[46:54] that god is a spirit when you first
[46:56] think about god is a spirit well he's
[46:58] just a spirit he's just floating around
[46:59] he just
[47:01] he just floats around there well the
[47:03] prophet said
[47:05] he's a being
[47:09] he said he's not like the wind so we've
[47:11] got to get away from our thought of what
[47:13] a spiritual being is
[47:17] see we make a spiritual being a lot of
[47:18] time it's something that is non-existent
[47:21] or can't be seen or understood
[47:24] well then what is god doing not what's
[47:26] he doing the whole thing for
[47:27] is to reveal himself to manifest himself
[47:31] or bring himself out into the open
[47:34] all right and see doing that then you
[47:36] can see
[47:37] that he started with a spiritual
[47:39] creation
[47:42] all right now i'm going to take these
[47:44] three and back of backwards
[47:46] to where that you'll follow me later on
[47:48] coming see because
[47:49] you'll see why i've read it like i did
[47:51] because it's over in revelation 3 14
[47:55] in 3 14 it says the beginning of the
[47:57] creation of god the prophet said
[48:00] this is the bride creation
[48:10] because see that's where it finally
[48:11] winds up in the bride it winds up with a
[48:14] spiritual
[48:18] creation
[48:21] entering into a literal creation
[48:24] fleshly and that's as far as it's going
[48:31] now making that eternal is the change of
[48:33] the body
[48:35] but that's as far as it's going so see
[48:37] see why the scripture said
[48:38] the beginning of the creation of god
[48:43] see that that would that throws you i
[48:46] just don't see it
[48:47] so take it in the basis of beginning of
[48:50] creation
[48:52] and let that be the the the starting i
[48:55] mean the ending point of it
[48:56] but see then you've got to back up to a
[48:58] spiritual creation
[48:59] the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:05] then you back up from there to where
[49:07] you're backing up
[49:08] into the mind of god
[49:12] and coming all the way to the beginning
[49:15] so then what is the prophet how he keeps
[49:17] on saying what
[49:18] all god was he pours into christ
[49:27] now christ is not a physical creation
[49:31] see you got to hold on that's what i'm
[49:32] trying to get you to see christ is not a
[49:34] physical creation christ christ
[49:36] christ means the anointed one or the
[49:38] anointing
[49:42] see he came into human flesh
[49:45] and making that human flesh then be
[49:48] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[49:52] see then all god was he pours into
[49:55] christ
[49:57] you don't leave an open hole or a gap or
[49:59] a thought
[50:01] you just move it over in another form
[50:03] why because something else is taking
[50:05] place
[50:05] all right but as it's taking place don't
[50:07] leave the father
[50:10] so all god was he pours into christ
[50:13] that you know i i i know how our human
[50:16] mind goes and i've heard it before and
[50:18] you have to
[50:19] when people get up and be you know
[50:21] preachers especially try to make their
[50:22] points and
[50:23] all god was all see they're all god was
[50:29] well i'm sitting there what are you
[50:30] trying to explain
[50:32] you're emphasizing all god for some
[50:34] reason
[50:36] could it be that they're emphasizing
[50:38] that it's going to make him go
[50:40] out of what out of the way or become
[50:42] non-existent
[50:45] well then if it is then when you pour it
[50:46] over into christ
[50:52] see
[50:54] does that do away with him no that's his
[50:58] reform changing
[50:59] that's where he morphed that's where he
[51:01] changes his form
[51:03] all right see then all christ was he
[51:05] pours into the church well is that going
[51:07] to do away with christ
[51:10] you see i don't mean it to be wrong i
[51:12] just mean it to to wonder what people
[51:14] are thinking
[51:15] because i've heard it emphasized over
[51:16] and over and over oh now now brother all
[51:20] all means all and all is all so all of
[51:23] god was poured into christ
[51:28] if that's the right and the terminology
[51:30] you're using you've done away with god
[51:34] you only got to christ and then if you
[51:37] do away with christ you only got a bride
[51:40] right right see don't do away with
[51:44] each one comes forth in a manifestation
[51:48] into a greater understanding or
[51:51] or are multiplying it like i've always
[51:54] said you know
[52:01] 120 at one time 3 000 another time
[52:06] that's a manifestation or a manifesting
[52:09] of god
[52:10] in a many-membered form what about now
[52:12] for all these thousands of years and
[52:14] it's coming forth
[52:16] right but you see that
[52:19] you you may not follow why did i
[52:21] emphasize so much about it
[52:23] because i i'm trying my best to make
[52:26] sure that our minds doesn't get the
[52:28] wrong
[52:28] point i mean of all god in christ
[52:32] just do away with god okay well i i
[52:36] don't do away with god
[52:37] well where's he at
[52:42] well he's in christ okay that's good
[52:45] he's in christ but did that do away with
[52:48] that
[52:50] just because brother ray became a father
[52:52] did that do away with him as a son
[52:57] no it helps make it manifest it's it's
[53:00] the things that's that you're doing
[53:02] right see it's bringing forth those
[53:05] things
[53:05] see that way we'll be able to understand
[53:07] the godhead all god was he poured into
[53:09] christ all christ in the church
[53:11] take her back to the garden of eden amen
[53:15] right or back to the original condition
[53:18] as the prophet says what are you
[53:22] following me
[53:24] see then god's first creation
[53:28] was himself coming into view
[53:31] but he's coming into view in the
[53:33] spiritual
[53:37] understanding
[53:40] you're not trying to go back there and
[53:42] see if you can find some flesh
[53:45] no let that come on down and then when
[53:48] it does
[53:49] the bible will be right a body thou has
[53:51] prepared me
[53:53] see it'll come on down to that just like
[53:55] i said about the
[53:56] the the uh uh dedicating to the
[54:01] foreign church over there see that was
[54:03] my point there because that was my
[54:04] thought in mind
[54:06] and see each one of those was was a way
[54:09] for god to
[54:10] live or abide for a while
[54:14] but that wasn't all he wanted that's
[54:15] right amen then
[54:17] the next step would they you know david
[54:19] and then
[54:20] solomon you know that that didn't
[54:23] fulfill it because it's still something
[54:24] wrong
[54:26] all right see then you put him
[54:30] and bring him into natural flesh all
[54:32] right you got him in flesh
[54:35] but you still got to get the church
[54:37] involved
[54:39] to bring her to that place
[54:42] so then you're going to see that the
[54:44] beginning of the creation of god our
[54:46] beginning of creation is a better way of
[54:48] saying the words
[54:50] because it simply means at the beginning
[54:52] of creation
[54:54] there was a beginning of creation but
[54:57] that was spiritual
[55:01] and see when you come forth into the
[55:03] next stage which is the christ that
[55:05] we'll try to talk about today
[55:07] now you're coming to another change or
[55:10] in morphe
[55:11] or form but as you're doing it you're
[55:14] coming forth
[55:15] in another form another way or another
[55:18] not another being but another way to
[55:22] make manifest
[55:24] or make known but you got to keep it as
[55:26] spiritual creation
[55:27] because he was not a physical creation
[55:30] back there
[55:31] you got to get the spiritual part of the
[55:34] beginning
[55:34] to where he can you can see then he
[55:36] stands back there
[55:38] in spiritual form and says let there be
[55:43] but yet he's in a phys in a form called
[55:46] the
[55:46] theophany or logos or word
[55:50] or son of god
[55:55] see that's what i said you you say son
[55:57] of god to most people that's two
[55:59] thousand years ago
[56:00] here come a baby on earth that was a son
[56:02] of god
[56:04] no that's the physical part
[56:09] that's the natural part coming forth
[56:13] well see he was back there
[56:19] because he was the one that said let
[56:20] there be
[56:24] see god himself stepped in another form
[56:26] kept coming down
[56:27] coming down and he first he comes down
[56:29] into
[56:31] theophany logos great terminologies for
[56:35] us
[56:35] uneducated people to talk about but
[56:37] that's all right
[56:38] it just makes a point he changed his
[56:42] form
[56:46] all right he starts off as being great
[56:49] eternal jehovah god
[56:52] self-existing
[56:57] then he steps down in or every how you
[56:59] want to call it i'd say
[57:00] ups this is good a word is down because
[57:02] it's eternity
[57:03] but he steps into another form and he
[57:05] does he becomes the word
[57:10] he becomes the christ
[57:16] see that's why when they they come to
[57:17] jesus if you read there's about four of
[57:19] them or five
[57:20] where it speaks of him being the christ
[57:22] the son of the living god or the christ
[57:24] of god see the heart of the christ
[57:28] all right see that was not in no way
[57:31] referring to his natural flesh
[57:35] that was referring to the one that was
[57:37] within him
[57:39] because god brother brown said it like
[57:41] that he said in
[57:42] in body he was a man said in spirit he
[57:46] was god or in soul he was god
[57:48] all right see it was god stepping down
[57:51] or kept coming down
[57:52] until he's actually come out into human
[57:54] flesh a baby with no teeth that's one i
[57:57] love
[58:00] almighty god laying in a cradle
[58:03] as a baby
[58:07] but i know too that he couldn't die for
[58:08] my sins then
[58:11] so he had to keep changing forms
[58:16] you had to have a river jordan where you
[58:18] could say this is my beloved son in whom
[58:20] i'm pleased to dwell
[58:27] god coming toward human flesh is what
[58:30] i'm talking about
[58:33] the beginning there was a beginning of
[58:35] the human flesh
[58:38] right that's why brother branham uses if
[58:42] you'll look at it
[58:43] he uses it this way there is hardly any
[58:46] time that he uses the beginning of the
[58:49] creation of god
[58:50] back in the spiritual sense i'm just
[58:53] laying it down for you to look at
[58:55] he's constantly dealing with
[58:59] the flesh man and he said how did god
[59:02] have a beginning
[59:03] he said in a wound of a woman
[59:08] that was the beginning of the creation
[59:10] of god
[59:12] it was in the wound of a mormon a baby
[59:17] see but you've got to look back and see
[59:20] how that that baby that's laying there
[59:22] is almighty god
[59:26] no no he's a son well okay let's be
[59:29] careful because you see
[59:31] i'll deal with you with son if you'll
[59:33] talk with me about it in my way of
[59:34] talking
[59:35] because to me the first one to come out
[59:37] back there that's what i've been trying
[59:39] to explain what
[59:40] god stepped over in another form in the
[59:43] word
[59:43] or the son because the son is the
[59:47] creator god
[59:48] amen
[59:51] all right and then he keeps coming down
[59:55] to whether it comes into the original
[59:57] way that he wants to be
[59:59] he wanted to be a father a certain way
[1:00:01] that's what i've emphasized to you
[1:00:03] see adam and eve
[1:00:06] adam and eve were created
[1:00:10] you could say that'd make him father but
[1:00:12] not the way he wanted
[1:00:13] right the son of man is the way he
[1:00:17] wanted it
[1:00:20] that's what your prophet said he said he
[1:00:23] become the son of man
[1:00:24] to fulfill his porn of what he wanted
[1:00:27] all right but follow me
[1:00:30] see his first creation then was a
[1:00:33] spiritual creation
[1:00:36] now you can go back and read and listen
[1:00:38] to the prophet saying it
[1:00:39] over and over and he says and what was
[1:00:41] the first man
[1:00:43] he said spirit man
[1:00:48] right what was man first man he said
[1:00:51] spirit man
[1:00:53] he said he created him a spiritual being
[1:00:56] and said that spiritual being led the
[1:00:58] animals in the garden and the thing
[1:01:01] you know right
[1:01:04] see then it's coming forth to manifest
[1:01:06] itself into the open
[1:01:08] to where that you can see that that part
[1:01:11] was
[1:01:11] this coming into being this coming into
[1:01:14] being this coming into
[1:01:15] each thing is a step or stage or a form
[1:01:19] of god coming into the being in another
[1:01:21] way another form another
[1:01:23] point until it finally comes out to be
[1:01:25] the bride of jesus christ standing on
[1:01:27] the earth
[1:01:30] when we get to glory you ain't gonna
[1:01:32] look and see a little halo up here
[1:01:34] and a little light over here a little
[1:01:36] dove over here and all this stuff
[1:01:38] that's catholicism that's your
[1:01:39] trinitarian you're going to see jesus
[1:01:41] and know who he is
[1:01:45] because he said if you've seen me you've
[1:01:47] seen the father
[1:01:50] well i want to see the father he said if
[1:01:51] you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:01:54] well i'm no joke i can't see you because
[1:01:57] that's where our trouble is
[1:02:00] we're blind in by our wording and our
[1:02:02] thoughts a lot of times and that's where
[1:02:04] i keep going over and over and over
[1:02:08] because you see when god gave
[1:02:11] forth in manifestation or changed his
[1:02:14] form
[1:02:15] from the great eternal self-existing
[1:02:19] the next stage was
[1:02:23] him manifesting himself as the word
[1:02:28] right and as it did then that was the
[1:02:32] son
[1:02:34] god gave birth brother branham says
[1:02:40] himself giving birth to a son
[1:02:46] but he wasn't giving birth to a son like
[1:02:48] this
[1:02:49] we think
[1:02:53] you remember how i kept emphasizing and
[1:02:55] i'll keep on him
[1:02:56] brother brown said god came himself he
[1:02:59] never
[1:03:00] sent a son to die for you and i that's
[1:03:02] where we think about it oh isn't it
[1:03:04] wonderful
[1:03:04] oh we love jesus because jesus just come
[1:03:08] down to die
[1:03:09] he was that next person and he's the
[1:03:11] second person or something
[1:03:12] and he come to die in our place oh isn't
[1:03:15] it wonderful how he
[1:03:18] ain't even scriptural
[1:03:22] god came himself
[1:03:30] he took upon himself another form
[1:03:35] to manifest himself as to be called a
[1:03:37] son but the son was back there not over
[1:03:39] here 2000 you know
[1:03:42] not when jesus walked on the shores of
[1:03:43] galilee
[1:03:47] because jesus walking on the shores of
[1:03:49] galilee never declared himself to be the
[1:03:51] son of god
[1:03:53] he declared himself to be the son of man
[1:03:57] all right there was a reason for that
[1:03:59] because only in the son of man could he
[1:04:00] be the father
[1:04:02] the way he wanted to be i'm quoting
[1:04:04] brother branham he could become the
[1:04:06] father
[1:04:06] why because he could sow the seed
[1:04:11] the right of man would have to be the
[1:04:13] one to sow the seed not physical seeds
[1:04:15] now come on
[1:04:17] he'd have to be the one to preach the
[1:04:19] gospel
[1:04:23] in preaching the gospel he poured out
[1:04:25] the seed that would
[1:04:26] eventually be quickened and be made into
[1:04:29] the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:32] all right see he gave himself
[1:04:36] birth to his son not that he
[1:04:39] made another what did he do he just
[1:04:41] stepped in another form
[1:04:44] i want you to see that he just stepped
[1:04:46] into another form
[1:04:47] and became the word that's right
[1:04:51] the logos and logos means speech
[1:04:57] right am i quoting brother branham do
[1:04:59] you need all of these i've got them
[1:05:01] the word logos means speech
[1:05:04] see that way jesus when he stepped out
[1:05:06] there not physically the man
[1:05:08] jesus the flesh man but when he stepped
[1:05:10] out there in the garden
[1:05:12] he could say let there be
[1:05:15] and everything could come into being
[1:05:18] why because he was that word
[1:05:22] right see now you're at john 1 in the
[1:05:25] beginning was the word
[1:05:26] brother was reading a while ago in the
[1:05:28] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:05:29] god and the word was god
[1:05:33] it didn't become god it was god
[1:05:37] he was god all the time he changed his
[1:05:40] form
[1:05:41] but never his character nature or or i'm
[1:05:44] trying to pick up the ones that
[1:05:45] the prophets you he never changed his
[1:05:47] characteristics he never changed his
[1:05:49] nature
[1:05:50] he never changes itself the way we think
[1:05:52] about chain
[1:05:53] he changes his form he just changes to
[1:05:55] another form and manifests itself
[1:05:57] right
[1:06:00] see that way you can keep the godhead
[1:06:02] running correctly and you won't be
[1:06:04] wondering well i got this person i got
[1:06:06] this person i got that verb
[1:06:07] just bring all that together what was
[1:06:10] the quote we gave there last week
[1:06:12] we wrote around and said he was not the
[1:06:13] third person
[1:06:17] he said he was not the second person
[1:06:20] he said it was not even the first person
[1:06:24] he was the person amen yes sir
[1:06:29] see we're bringing god into a basis of
[1:06:32] not a oneness thought
[1:06:38] but into the basis of god manifesting
[1:06:41] himself
[1:06:42] to where we could comprehend
[1:06:47] but see you you understand why the dose
[1:06:49] people back there
[1:06:50] you know they killed him because he said
[1:06:52] he was god
[1:06:57] they literally killed him i used to
[1:06:59] think about that in the baptist because
[1:07:01] there was no way to comprehend we
[1:07:02] couldn't
[1:07:02] we didn't have any thoughts we could do
[1:07:04] a little bit but
[1:07:05] uh when i was in the baptist church i
[1:07:07] would not argue with you that wouldn't
[1:07:08] but one god
[1:07:10] but i couldn't explain it except for god
[1:07:11] in three persons
[1:07:14] when brother moe said you're saying the
[1:07:15] same thing everybody else is saying i
[1:07:17] said okay i won't say that no more
[1:07:19] then he ended that part because i i seen
[1:07:21] what he was saying was right
[1:07:23] all right see then i had to change my
[1:07:26] thoughts but back there
[1:07:27] i always looked at one god and wonder
[1:07:30] you mean they killed a man that never
[1:07:33] done
[1:07:34] nothing but right
[1:07:38] religious people
[1:07:41] the romans didn't kill jesus
[1:07:46] they didn't kill him
[1:07:49] they only allowed or permitted by their
[1:07:52] law
[1:07:55] the jews couldn't kill him remember
[1:07:58] so they had to go to the romans all the
[1:08:01] romans done said okay you go do what
[1:08:03] you're going to do
[1:08:06] all right but you see the romans didn't
[1:08:10] kill him
[1:08:12] the religious people
[1:08:15] i used to think then i thought well lord
[1:08:18] what's wrong
[1:08:20] you mean all you do is good and
[1:08:23] and they kill you
[1:08:29] they said you're a man making yourself
[1:08:31] god no he was god making himself a man
[1:08:35] he was coming forth in the way that he
[1:08:36] wanted to come forth
[1:08:39] and yet all they could do was just kill
[1:08:41] him
[1:08:43] could we be doing that again now let me
[1:08:46] say this because that's what i said i'll
[1:08:47] win these days i'll preach on the
[1:08:48] godhead the way i see it
[1:08:50] because you see if we don't get the
[1:08:51] godhead straight then we're just as much
[1:08:52] of
[1:08:53] a sinner our people as those were back
[1:08:55] there we'll kill him again
[1:08:57] oh no no
[1:09:02] ain't no way that i'd ever kill god
[1:09:05] that's what they done
[1:09:10] the bible says they done it what he says
[1:09:13] they'll do it to you and me what
[1:09:15] thinking they're doing god a service
[1:09:19] that's scripture thinking they're doing
[1:09:21] god a service
[1:09:23] oh no brother dale i'll never i'll i'll
[1:09:25] never kill nobody
[1:09:31] all you got to do is just twist that
[1:09:33] word
[1:09:36] let's see i'm trying to preach one god
[1:09:39] to the bases it would get away from the
[1:09:40] idea
[1:09:41] of saying well you're okay we understand
[1:09:43] now there's just one god
[1:09:44] but we really still really don't
[1:09:46] understand it i just i just brother dale
[1:09:48] i just don't under well
[1:09:49] why don't you listen and go back
[1:09:53] listen to the prophet that's where i
[1:09:55] give you
[1:09:57] the things from the message
[1:10:02] let you listen to the prophet say it
[1:10:05] it's not me saying it then amen
[1:10:12] we have the opportunity to be able to
[1:10:15] comprehend
[1:10:17] the word of god that even the
[1:10:20] theologians and the things like that
[1:10:22] could not in no way ever think about
[1:10:24] understanding it amen
[1:10:28] and he permits that to you and me
[1:10:33] he reveals his secrets to his little
[1:10:35] bride
[1:10:36] amen right
[1:10:40] god begins to unfold itself down now
[1:10:43] let's take that word
[1:10:44] beginning a minute just with a thought
[1:10:47] let's go ahead to number four
[1:10:51] don't just take a few of these little
[1:10:53] thoughts and then just
[1:10:56] leave it laying on that point of what
[1:10:58] we're talking
[1:10:59] trying to talk about
[1:11:06] so what happens this is questions and
[1:11:08] answers that's to me that's the greatest
[1:11:10] message
[1:11:10] there's too two messages who is god and
[1:11:13] uh
[1:11:13] the questions and answers on genesis
[1:11:16] if you want to get anything and stay
[1:11:18] with it you can read for days
[1:11:21] on study and read the whole questions
[1:11:23] and answers because it's going to be
[1:11:24] involved
[1:11:25] so now john he said in the beginning was
[1:11:26] the word one of her and the word was god
[1:11:29] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:11:30] among us
[1:11:32] god unfolding himself down
[1:11:35] to a human being
[1:11:39] compound in your thought to him of being
[1:11:42] a human being to comprehend
[1:11:44] but he's unfolding his down self down to
[1:11:47] where
[1:11:48] the human being can understand him
[1:11:51] take it in two ways and understand it
[1:11:55] now watch how he did it
[1:11:59] how did he do how did he unfold himself
[1:12:01] down to a human being
[1:12:05] that to me is i mean
[1:12:09] i don't know of no other way to say than
[1:12:11] how could a man
[1:12:13] speak like he spoke and not be god's
[1:12:18] using the man's lips come on i'm i'm we
[1:12:20] don't believe brother brown was deity
[1:12:22] but we
[1:12:23] we believe he was led of god a prophet
[1:12:26] god unfolding himself
[1:12:27] down to a human being
[1:12:31] now that's a statement
[1:12:35] that god himself
[1:12:39] unveiled himself all the way until when
[1:12:42] he became a human being
[1:12:44] what was it god was in christ
[1:12:46] reconciling the world and to himself
[1:12:49] brother brother said sure that's why we
[1:12:51] ought to understand he says
[1:12:53] in flesh said that flesh was a man
[1:12:58] he said but in soul he was god
[1:13:03] lord understand that listen and back
[1:13:05] there then when this little
[1:13:06] halo comes and we see nothing yet but
[1:13:09] just
[1:13:09] by eyes of just supernatural we see a
[1:13:13] halo standing there
[1:13:14] now that's the son of god the logos
[1:13:20] see now read it that's the son of god
[1:13:22] the logo
[1:13:23] now i can see him playing around like a
[1:13:26] little child
[1:13:28] before the father's door
[1:13:31] with all eternity you see now then in
[1:13:34] his imaginary makeup he begins to think
[1:13:37] of what things would be
[1:13:41] and i can hear him say let there be
[1:13:44] light
[1:13:44] and when he did an atom busted and the
[1:13:47] sun
[1:13:48] came into existence
[1:13:51] right jesus christ the word not jesus
[1:13:54] the flesh man
[1:13:56] the word created all things
[1:14:00] right look at the next one
[1:14:08] still in the questions and answered on
[1:14:09] genesis
[1:14:11] you talk about a big clunker you know
[1:14:12] how he made the sun then the first thing
[1:14:15] you know a big
[1:14:15] clinker fell off of it weighed about
[1:14:18] just about like the earth
[1:14:20] see the pieces that's that's the
[1:14:22] creation of
[1:14:23] of you know from the the one big ball
[1:14:27] thing blasting out and it's brother run
[1:14:30] said he's what is he doing he's writing
[1:14:31] the bible
[1:14:32] and all because he's putting the the uh
[1:14:36] stars and things into place all right
[1:14:39] what about the earth then this logos
[1:14:41] here
[1:14:42] now the son of god is watching it
[1:14:47] see he has no trouble calling the logos
[1:14:49] the son of god
[1:14:50] well yet we think son of god was 2000
[1:14:52] years ago on the shores of galilee
[1:14:58] right when we say son of god we think
[1:15:00] two thousand years ago on the shores of
[1:15:02] galilee son of god but that was the son
[1:15:04] of man
[1:15:05] he was not fulfilling the office of son
[1:15:08] of god
[1:15:10] he was fulfilling the office of son of
[1:15:12] man
[1:15:13] the word look
[1:15:17] then this logos here the son of god is
[1:15:19] watching he lets it fall for a hundred
[1:15:21] dollars what's he doing he's writing his
[1:15:22] bible
[1:15:23] now we're standing watching it come into
[1:15:26] existence
[1:15:27] he's got something in his mind and
[1:15:29] what's he doing
[1:15:31] he's writing his first bible
[1:15:35] all of the things he's got in mind go
[1:15:37] ahead to the next one
[1:15:43] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:15:46] that is who the lord jesus says he
[1:15:48] is but those words don't mean exactly
[1:15:52] as they sound to us just taking them the
[1:15:54] way they sound
[1:15:56] has made some people in fact multitudes
[1:15:58] of people
[1:15:59] get the idea that jesus was the first
[1:16:02] creation of god
[1:16:05] making him lower than godhead now are
[1:16:08] you listening
[1:16:10] you get the idea that jesus was the
[1:16:12] first creation of god
[1:16:14] which would make him lesser
[1:16:20] right come on
[1:16:23] making him lower than godhead
[1:16:27] if god created jesus as another person
[1:16:33] see then he's lower
[1:16:37] but he says no that's not
[1:16:40] get the idea that jesus was the first
[1:16:42] creation
[1:16:45] jesus wasn't the first creation
[1:16:48] god was the first creation you say now
[1:16:50] you've got to stumble again
[1:16:52] but that's what your prophet said that's
[1:16:53] what i'm trying to get you to see
[1:16:57] jesus was not the first creation god was
[1:17:00] the first creation
[1:17:03] god himself stepped down kept coming
[1:17:06] down coming down revealing himself
[1:17:09] now he's come to the point of being the
[1:17:11] word
[1:17:14] all right he's not jesus the flesh man
[1:17:17] here he's talking about the word
[1:17:19] so you get the idea that jesus was the
[1:17:21] first creation of god making him lower
[1:17:23] than godhead
[1:17:26] you know that's where i've always asked
[1:17:27] a trinitarian who created who
[1:17:29] you say you've got three gods well who
[1:17:30] created who
[1:17:32] he was the first is the father the
[1:17:35] oldest
[1:17:35] well then if the father's the oldest you
[1:17:37] can't have them crow week one go eternal
[1:17:39] and that's your baptist doctrine one god
[1:17:42] in three persons co-equal and co-eternal
[1:17:46] i come from there i ought to know the
[1:17:47] doctrine coequal and co-eternal
[1:17:51] now how would they be co-equal how can a
[1:17:54] father be co-equal with a son
[1:17:58] who created who
[1:18:04] god created jesus and then he created
[1:18:07] everything else
[1:18:08] now watch what he says we know for a
[1:18:11] surety that jesus is god
[1:18:13] excuse me in his first creation created
[1:18:16] all the rest of the universe and
[1:18:18] whatsoever it contains
[1:18:19] but that is not right you know that
[1:18:21] doesn't line up with the rest of the
[1:18:23] bible the words are
[1:18:24] he is the beginner or author of the
[1:18:27] creation of god
[1:18:29] in other words he's bringing into
[1:18:31] manifestation
[1:18:35] author it's like writing it and handed a
[1:18:37] book or what
[1:18:38] bringing it to a creation watch now now
[1:18:40] we know that for a surety that jesus is
[1:18:42] god
[1:18:43] very god he's the creator john 1 3.
[1:18:47] jesus is the creator but not jesus the
[1:18:52] flesh
[1:18:54] jesus the christ that's why they kept
[1:18:57] saying
[1:18:59] he asked him who the man say that i am
[1:19:02] they all said
[1:19:03] you're the christ
[1:19:07] you're the son of the living god
[1:19:10] in other words in plain language they
[1:19:13] were saying
[1:19:14] you are god made manifest
[1:19:17] in flesh they may not have been able to
[1:19:20] comprehend that rightly
[1:19:21] but that's exactly what they were saying
[1:19:24] jesus was god manifested in human flesh
[1:19:30] because that's the only name god ever
[1:19:31] had was jesus amen
[1:19:34] right you see as the unveiling of god
[1:19:38] comes forth
[1:19:39] then you begin to see the things that
[1:19:41] was in your previous
[1:19:42] thoughts and ideas of doctrinal things
[1:19:45] they start going away
[1:19:47] and you start just narrowing it down but
[1:19:49] don't throw away
[1:19:54] because you see what would be the
[1:19:55] difference is whatever you're doing see
[1:19:57] he said it said people think that god
[1:20:00] created jesus and jesus created
[1:20:02] everything else he said that's not right
[1:20:04] amen well brother dale that's what it
[1:20:07] sounds like you're saying
[1:20:08] no i'm not i'm saying one thing for sure
[1:20:12] the father stepped over in another form
[1:20:14] called the son
[1:20:20] that father keeps unveiling himself
[1:20:22] because to me that father
[1:20:24] is the whole god
[1:20:29] that's who he is he's jehovah god he's
[1:20:31] the self-existing
[1:20:32] all right look then go ahead
[1:20:37] i'm just using these where you'll see
[1:20:39] the word form
[1:20:42] the mighty god unveiled before us the
[1:20:44] bible says no man
[1:20:46] has seen god at any time but the only
[1:20:49] begotten of the father hath declared him
[1:20:52] he brought him out in the open now what
[1:20:54] so moses saw him
[1:20:59] moses saw god
[1:21:05] melchizedek was god
[1:21:08] abraham saw him but moses is the one
[1:21:12] where brother brown said because you
[1:21:14] remember moses went and stood in the
[1:21:15] rock and
[1:21:16] he walked by and he saw the back parts
[1:21:18] it was the back part of a man
[1:21:22] moses saw him veiled as a man we find
[1:21:24] that jehovah the old testament was just
[1:21:26] the jesus of the new testament
[1:21:28] dr scofield says you come up with the
[1:21:30] word amorphy
[1:21:32] the word in morphe means in morphe means
[1:21:35] that he
[1:21:36] changes from supernatural to natural
[1:21:40] he just changes his mask we got him on
[1:21:43] today
[1:21:44] he just changed his mask
[1:21:47] right went from one form to another
[1:21:51] not another person
[1:21:57] that's my whole point not another person
[1:21:59] if you'll keep that thought in mind
[1:22:01] it'll clear up the god head to you that
[1:22:04] he's not in another person he's just
[1:22:06] he's the same person in another form
[1:22:09] like brother ray
[1:22:10] was a child he was a a
[1:22:14] husband he was a father his grandfather
[1:22:18] right not a different person
[1:22:23] same person just the way he
[1:22:27] unveils himself or reveals himself
[1:22:32] and see god's finality of what he's
[1:22:33] going to do is going to wind up being in
[1:22:35] his bride
[1:22:36] now i want to get to that one you know
[1:22:38] that part but
[1:22:40] i'm trying to keep this to what you're
[1:22:41] thinking
[1:22:43] because the first couple of messages we
[1:22:46] dealt on
[1:22:47] almighty god what being the first
[1:22:50] creation was god himself
[1:22:52] where that god becomes into view or
[1:22:55] unveils himself
[1:22:57] or reveals himself makes known himself
[1:23:01] and he keeps coming down and then when
[1:23:03] he does outcomes the prophet said
[1:23:07] the logos
[1:23:10] the the theophany
[1:23:13] the word and begins to create
[1:23:22] and then when he creates he keeps coming
[1:23:23] down in his creation
[1:23:25] and he brings man down
[1:23:28] and he creates man
[1:23:31] in the image of himself which was a
[1:23:34] spirit man
[1:23:36] are a spiritual being
[1:23:39] they're in genesis let us make man in
[1:23:42] our image
[1:23:43] you know a spiritual being that's not
[1:23:46] the human flesh
[1:23:48] come on we've been in the message long
[1:23:49] enough for you to understand right
[1:23:50] around said that's the spirit man
[1:23:52] he said in genesis 2 is the flesh man
[1:23:56] genesis 2 was when he was created in
[1:23:58] flesh genesis 1 was where
[1:24:00] he was there in spirit
[1:24:05] and actually genesis you're going to
[1:24:08] have to take this and put it in the
[1:24:09] right
[1:24:09] category because but genesis 1 1 when
[1:24:12] you get over to
[1:24:13] uh 17 18 you remember you followed way
[1:24:17] back before eternity
[1:24:20] because that man that was made in in
[1:24:22] genesis 1
[1:24:24] was a spirit man flesh man
[1:24:29] genesis 2 don't get those two
[1:24:32] involved in in the wrong way spirit man
[1:24:37] he was a spiritual being he was in god's
[1:24:39] image because he was god himself
[1:24:41] who was there adam that's why i've
[1:24:44] always tried to teach it and get you to
[1:24:46] understand it go to blasphemous names
[1:24:48] brother branham in blasphemy his name
[1:24:50] said adam had
[1:24:52] eternal life in his soul
[1:24:56] and he says in the question as an answer
[1:24:58] to conduct and order that eve was in
[1:25:00] adam and theophany
[1:25:03] so if adam had an eternal soul then eve
[1:25:05] had an eternal soul
[1:25:07] they were eternal people the only two
[1:25:09] that was dire that's why i said you will
[1:25:11] get to
[1:25:12] it see adam and eve was
[1:25:15] like from creation straight into the
[1:25:18] point of putting them into
[1:25:19] uh spiritual condition then they were
[1:25:22] brought into natural condition
[1:25:27] but jesus didn't have to come this way
[1:25:29] and then come that way
[1:25:31] he was dead all the time he was why he
[1:25:34] said he was the only begotten
[1:25:35] that's why it is that a way see the only
[1:25:38] one begotten
[1:25:42] we'll get to that in the next message
[1:25:43] the only one begotten
[1:25:45] coming from the wound of a mother
[1:25:49] why because we've got to have a way
[1:25:54] to get these bodies and he had to come
[1:25:57] that way
[1:25:59] for us to be able to handle this
[1:26:01] situation and become
[1:26:03] the children of almighty god let me go
[1:26:04] on all right
[1:26:06] listen what did we get to we're
[1:26:09] uh
[1:26:13] word in morphe which meant that he
[1:26:15] changed from supernatural to natural
[1:26:18] he just changes his mass go to the next
[1:26:20] one
[1:26:23] this is the unveiling of god he says but
[1:26:26] the word kenos
[1:26:28] in the greek does not mean that he
[1:26:30] vomited up or
[1:26:31] his arm went all for his eye went out
[1:26:34] and i mean another person it doesn't
[1:26:37] mean that too
[1:26:39] that is he changed himself he poured
[1:26:42] himself
[1:26:43] into un to amen into another mask
[1:26:47] into another form not another person
[1:26:50] went out of him
[1:26:51] called the holy spirit but it was he
[1:26:53] himself
[1:26:54] you get it god all the fullness of the
[1:26:57] godhead bodily was in this person
[1:27:00] jesus christ he was god and god alone
[1:27:04] not a third person or a second person or
[1:27:06] a first person
[1:27:07] but the person god veiled in human flesh
[1:27:13] jesus was that god
[1:27:17] now that's why i see he could not die
[1:27:20] as son of god
[1:27:25] that's why he kept referring to himself
[1:27:27] and kept himself from referring all the
[1:27:28] time
[1:27:28] he never referred to himself as son of
[1:27:30] god because you can't kill son of god
[1:27:34] now son of man was the human flesh
[1:27:39] the human flesh could die
[1:27:42] and did die when the life left out of it
[1:27:46] that's why the bride of christ has got
[1:27:47] to get to that place i've tried my best
[1:27:49] to preach it for
[1:27:50] for 50 years to you
[1:27:53] the bride of jesus christ is going to be
[1:27:55] the son of man
[1:27:57] your prophet said it made manifest
[1:28:01] here in earth it's the bride or god in
[1:28:04] another form called a bride
[1:28:09] call the bride
[1:28:12] you say yeah but that's just making it
[1:28:13] too much no it ain't we're just making
[1:28:15] us what we are
[1:28:16] we are his children we are his offspring
[1:28:20] if we're his children then we have
[1:28:22] eternal life
[1:28:23] if we don't have eternal life we're not
[1:28:25] his children
[1:28:28] why adam and eve could have eternal life
[1:28:30] in their soul
[1:28:31] but not in their body because they were
[1:28:33] created
[1:28:38] they were created physically spiritually
[1:28:40] first then physically
[1:28:49] god changing his form
[1:28:52] what's the next one
[1:28:57] remember the word form we're talking
[1:28:58] about just take this one and read it
[1:29:01] after he appeared in another form
[1:29:05] onto two of them as they walked and went
[1:29:07] on their way you know that that's the
[1:29:08] two going on the road to emmaus
[1:29:10] another form they didn't understand him
[1:29:14] they didn't
[1:29:14] they didn't know who he was right
[1:29:19] the only way it could be he could be
[1:29:20] made known and really brother branham
[1:29:22] will never emphasize that point but the
[1:29:24] bible tells you
[1:29:25] he was known in the breaking of the
[1:29:26] bread
[1:29:29] but you find where brought around use
[1:29:30] that very much i don't i don't
[1:29:32] understand why he didn't
[1:29:34] i've always studied that that way but
[1:29:36] see they would
[1:29:37] they could not understand him
[1:29:41] but when he was breaking the bread it
[1:29:43] come back
[1:29:45] they knew who that was but the bible
[1:29:46] said he had disappeared and nobody went
[1:29:48] out
[1:29:50] because he was in another form now what
[1:29:54] does that mean
[1:29:55] it means the same thing when mary was
[1:29:57] standing there and thinking it was a
[1:29:59] gardener
[1:30:00] that was in the tombs there you know and
[1:30:03] she's talking to the gardener
[1:30:06] but he finally says mary
[1:30:10] and when he said mary she knew who he
[1:30:13] was
[1:30:15] right why because there was some way
[1:30:18] that he was unveiled
[1:30:20] he was something he didn't understand
[1:30:22] maybe it's the point like
[1:30:24] i've always had it this is this way i
[1:30:25] believe it is
[1:30:27] here he's a young man standing there
[1:30:29] last mary saw
[1:30:30] him with an old man 50. right
[1:30:34] right you know you're not 50.
[1:30:41] and there he stood she couldn't
[1:30:42] understand him
[1:30:45] but when he spoke
[1:30:48] the creator spoke from eternity says
[1:30:51] mary
[1:30:53] she understood then didn't she okay come
[1:30:56] on let's go
[1:30:58] what do we got let's go to one what do
[1:31:00] we got on
[1:31:02] who do you say this is you know the
[1:31:05] unveiling okay
[1:31:07] he sent down the holy spirit which was
[1:31:10] god again in just another form
[1:31:14] on the day of pentecost now these are
[1:31:16] just quotes for using for that go ahead
[1:31:19] to the next one
[1:31:20] he came in another form because that's
[1:31:21] what we want to do
[1:31:23] in the church ages as the age comes
[1:31:26] along
[1:31:27] god just moves in another form and it's
[1:31:30] god all the time the word
[1:31:32] the word made flesh and dwelt among each
[1:31:34] church age
[1:31:35] was god and morphy are changing his form
[1:31:38] each church age
[1:31:40] changing the second church age third
[1:31:42] church age fourth church
[1:31:44] each age was him in another form
[1:31:47] because that's the way he's always go
[1:31:49] ahead to the next
[1:31:51] we'll get down to the end this is off of
[1:31:54] the first seal
[1:31:55] now the holy spirit and the revelation
[1:31:57] of jesus christ is the holy spirit is
[1:31:59] christ
[1:32:01] in another form that's right notice it
[1:32:04] is a lamb that opened the book
[1:32:05] and the lamb is christ go ahead
[1:32:09] we got one more i think
[1:32:13] you see that's where we come with the
[1:32:14] word in morphe you spell it in morphe
[1:32:16] just roll it on up we'll get to the
[1:32:17] to the point when he
[1:32:22] see when the in morphe that means that
[1:32:24] he changed himself
[1:32:27] he come down now listen
[1:32:30] now the greek word there means that
[1:32:33] something that could not be seen
[1:32:36] yet it's there and then it's changed
[1:32:40] and the eye can catch it
[1:32:44] see that's what he's been doing all this
[1:32:45] time
[1:32:47] going from one form to another form
[1:32:53] as to what the eye could comprehend
[1:32:56] all right see that's why mankind how
[1:32:59] could they
[1:33:00] in any way understand here was a man
[1:33:04] stood on this earth i could i can
[1:33:06] understand like i said i couldn't
[1:33:08] understand how that why they killed him
[1:33:10] i could understand why they didn't agree
[1:33:13] with him
[1:33:17] i'm a human being i can understand he
[1:33:19] spake like no man's fake
[1:33:22] i've had a man standing there and he
[1:33:24] said before abraham was i
[1:33:25] am what about all the things the lord
[1:33:28] jesus was saying
[1:33:30] to mankind no wonder they didn't
[1:33:31] understand him
[1:33:33] amen but now we don't have an excuse
[1:33:37] because we have the baptism of the holy
[1:33:39] ghost which is the same holy ghost
[1:33:41] that was back there in him in us
[1:33:44] to teach us the word
[1:33:48] right see changing his form
[1:33:53] all right so thou are the christ
[1:33:58] to peter when jesus asked him what did
[1:34:02] men say
[1:34:03] thou art the christ you're the christ
[1:34:07] one of them says the christ of god
[1:34:09] christ means the anointed
[1:34:11] one or the logos the same word anointing
[1:34:16] and logos and speech is exactly back in
[1:34:19] but if you'll go to that on the
[1:34:21] questions and answers on genesis
[1:34:23] and if you'll just read that first that
[1:34:25] whole message you'll see what i'm
[1:34:27] talking about
[1:34:29] you'll see the very things that i've
[1:34:31] done and i'll be glad to give you the
[1:34:32] notes here most of you having right now
[1:34:35] but to forget you to understand
[1:34:40] see the godhead is easy to understand if
[1:34:42] we
[1:34:44] don't take our thoughts
[1:34:50] we take his thoughts think his thoughts
[1:34:54] on it
[1:34:57] and just think about it
[1:35:01] that same god
[1:35:06] it was back there as the self-existing
[1:35:12] kept changing its form until one day he
[1:35:15] walked on earth
[1:35:18] dwelled in a body
[1:35:23] that same god gave his life
[1:35:29] came back on the day of pentecost in a
[1:35:32] many-membered bride
[1:35:33] right
[1:35:37] changed his form not his person
[1:35:42] not even brother brown said not even his
[1:35:44] personality because if you change your
[1:35:45] personality you change your person
[1:35:46] but it's not even your personality
[1:35:51] god's word
[1:35:56] you understand what i'm getting that's
[1:35:57] the the point we spent
[1:36:00] two services to explain the beginning
[1:36:02] part of it
[1:36:04] this service is to express the fact that
[1:36:07] back there
[1:36:08] as he come forth in another form he
[1:36:11] became the word
[1:36:12] the word the logos the speech the son of
[1:36:15] god
[1:36:17] see that's what i said we thank the son
[1:36:19] of god 2000 years ago that that's our
[1:36:21] terminology
[1:36:22] well now he's saying no he was just the
[1:36:24] word even scofield
[1:36:27] read you you've got a scofield bible
[1:36:29] read it he tells you the amorphies and
[1:36:32] the things
[1:36:32] brother brown probably read a lot of
[1:36:34] that from schofield
[1:36:39] the amorphous and the things like that
[1:36:42] bringing god out into the open that he
[1:36:44] could be understood
[1:36:49] but not doing away with him not doing
[1:36:53] away with anything
[1:36:56] you just keep moving it over brother ray
[1:37:01] as he was a baby he couldn't manifest
[1:37:03] himself in ways but
[1:37:05] there come a day that he could have a
[1:37:07] comprehensions of
[1:37:09] his life and beings because he'd become
[1:37:11] a man
[1:37:14] then he became a father and he became a
[1:37:18] grandfather and
[1:37:20] you know what i'm talking about them
[1:37:22] them the difference in the father and
[1:37:24] the grandfathers
[1:37:26] is grandkids don't ever do anything
[1:37:28] wrong
[1:37:32] right
[1:37:36] you got any grandkids you know what i'm
[1:37:37] talking about they they can get by with
[1:37:39] bloody murder
[1:37:42] but you know what they're the same
[1:37:44] person
[1:37:46] the same being because they're your
[1:37:48] children
[1:37:51] think on these things the christ
[1:37:55] we'll pick that up because he said i'm
[1:37:56] having to make it compound because the
[1:37:58] christ in this
[1:37:59] that i'm talking about is the christ
[1:38:01] that was back there before the world
[1:38:03] that created
[1:38:05] the christ the son of the living god was
[1:38:07] the creator god
[1:38:08] then when peter steps up and says he's
[1:38:11] speaking right directly to the man
[1:38:13] that's standing there
[1:38:17] right that's where we'll pick up at
[1:38:20] peter was speaking right to the man
[1:38:26] a man and says thou art the christ
[1:38:32] the son of the living god
[1:38:38] he said now flesh and blood hasn't
[1:38:41] revealed this to you peter
[1:38:45] but sit upon the revelation of who i am
[1:38:49] remember that
[1:38:51] upon the revelation of who it was
[1:38:54] you know how he's how the prophet
[1:38:56] explained it
[1:38:58] one group over here thinks he was this
[1:39:00] away one thinks he's this way
[1:39:02] but what was he the church is built on a
[1:39:06] revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:08] what that jesus christ is almighty god
[1:39:11] not just built on the revelation of
[1:39:13] jesus christ
[1:39:14] as a man
[1:39:18] but that he was the very god of glory
[1:39:22] and the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:39:24] against that revelation
[1:39:26] but yet it'll beat on it hammer on it
[1:39:28] it's done it over all these years
[1:39:32] but they are the christ and i'll build
[1:39:36] my church on this
[1:39:37] right the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:39:41] against you
[1:39:43] why because you'd be going against him
[1:39:46] but yet not to understand it we're going
[1:39:48] against him do you understand what i
[1:39:50] made there while ago or thought
[1:39:52] was he listening if we don't stay with
[1:39:54] the truth of one true and living god
[1:39:56] we're just as bad as everybody else
[1:39:58] i don't care how much you can quote i
[1:40:01] don't care how much you can read
[1:40:02] in time if it's not something revealed
[1:40:05] to you personally
[1:40:06] we're just as denominational as any
[1:40:08] denomination has ever been
[1:40:10] we're just as denominated as anybody's
[1:40:12] ever been
[1:40:15] so you see now in the last days what are
[1:40:17] the ministers of this message attacking
[1:40:22] come on you that went out tournament you
[1:40:25] that heard these things
[1:40:26] what are they attacking they're
[1:40:27] attacking the revelation of jesus christ
[1:40:34] why because they say well jesus wouldn't
[1:40:35] god until the river jordan
[1:40:39] well the bible said he was born lord to
[1:40:41] christ
[1:40:48] what about it could we be just like
[1:40:50] anybody else
[1:40:52] let's be careful let's walk soft
[1:40:56] in our understanding and keep our ideas
[1:40:59] into that line let's stand together come
[1:41:01] on musicians
[1:41:04] on these things
[1:41:07] how about your understanding of one god
[1:41:10] has it increased over time
[1:41:23] what it says you'll go back to questions
[1:41:25] and answers on genesis
[1:41:26] and just read that message you can't get
[1:41:30] it in those others
[1:41:31] it's for certain in the conduct order
[1:41:33] and doctrine
[1:41:37] but see to understand that jesus christ
[1:41:40] was almighty god
[1:41:42] the christ the christ is the holy ghost
[1:41:45] that we're going to get to next
[1:41:46] which comes into the bride of christ so
[1:41:49] now we've covered what all god was
[1:41:52] he poured into christ christ is the
[1:41:55] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:41:57] and that's the lord jesus christ and
[1:41:58] coming down in his life
[1:42:00] and coming to manifestation now next
[1:42:02] we'll have to
[1:42:03] start dealing with that christ because
[1:42:05] there was a cross in the old testament
[1:42:10] there was a god in the old testament
[1:42:12] that made himself manifest
[1:42:13] in many ways but it was the christ
[1:42:18] not jesus because jehovah the oldest
[1:42:21] jesus of the new
[1:42:23] see then we're just gradually coming
[1:42:25] through understanding
[1:42:26] but we haven't left anything we haven't
[1:42:29] left anything of the father
[1:42:30] haven't left anything of the son we come
[1:42:33] into you and me it won't be leaving
[1:42:34] anything
[1:42:36] he'll be in manifestation
[1:42:42] what we got page 251 all in him
[1:42:47] the might almighty god is jesus
[1:42:50] the prince of peace is he the
[1:42:54] everlasting father
[1:42:56] the king eternally anybody
[1:43:00] in wisdom think on the sides in whom all
[1:43:03] things were made
