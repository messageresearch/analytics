[9:50] let's pray that they get another
[9:51] television
[9:52] so it's not we don't pray for tvs but
[9:56] but we need another screen

[10:40] it's uh
[10:41] for the older ones in the group that

[10:57] one lord so we can get these things on
[10:59] the screen we don't have to pull this

[14:37] on this nation
[14:38] in this world that we don't want to be
[14:40] here lord
[14:41] so we pray that every time with the lord
[14:43] that we speak behind this desk lord that
[14:45] someone will come to you father

[14:49] savior lord and give their heart to you

[14:54] that they'll be lifted up above that and
[14:55] you said come up hither and lord we'll
[14:57] be in another dimension with you father
[14:59] and they'll do what they will on this
[15:01] earth
[15:02] man will destroy each other and be and
[15:03] just be at each other's throat but lord
[15:06] we will be in a place of safety
[15:08] because of the choices we make on this
[15:10] side father just give us this day our
[15:11] daily bread in jesus name we pray
[15:14] amen
[15:15] hebrews 9 11
[15:17] says but christ being coming high priest
[15:18] of good things to come by a greater more
[15:20] perfect tabernacle not made with hands
[15:22] that is to say not of this building
[15:24] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[15:26] but by his own blood he entered in once
[15:28] into the holy place
[15:30] having obtained eternal redemption
[15:33] for us in revelations 11 3
[15:36] and i will give power to my two
[15:37] witnesses and they shall prophesy one
[15:39] thousand two hundred three score day
[15:41] clothed in sackcloth i think we covered
[15:42] that pretty good this morning so we may
[15:45] just skip through some of this but i
[15:46] want to get to two points that i left
[15:48] out because the company was here
[15:50] and that made they may not have
[15:51] understood so let's go to isaiah 65
[15:53] verse 17.
[15:56] for behold i create new heavens i want
[15:59] you to watch how that says that all
[16:01] right
[16:02] the bible is written specifically right
[16:06] it all it has a purpose now remember in
[16:08] revelations 21 when we get to the future
[16:11] home it'll say a new heaven
[16:14] and a new earth
[16:16] this says new heavens
[16:20] and a new earth
[16:23] everybody got that
[16:25] because that is specific over there the
[16:27] future home this is going to be in the
[16:29] millennium where there's going to be
[16:31] layers and layers of heavens
[16:35] we'll get to it maybe not today but you
[16:37] i like when when we read that isaiah 65
[16:40] 66 and the different one says heavens
[16:43] but when you get revelations 21
[16:45] create a new heaven
[16:47] and a new earth all right
[16:49] and the former things will be passed
[16:50] away so the former shall not be
[16:51] remembered nor come into mind and before
[16:53] you all sit down i want you all to take
[16:55] a look over to your right and look at
[16:56] this beautiful group of people now not
[16:58] brother donnie but
[17:00] this beautiful group of ladies
[17:02] standing up here that's your future
[17:06] amen
[17:08] they all pretty much play instruments
[17:10] and they sing and they do the things and
[17:11] they're sitting up here in the front
[17:13] while you couldn't get me to sit in the
[17:14] front at that age for nothing in the
[17:15] world
[17:16] but thank god that they're able to
[17:19] i know even though we told them they had
[17:20] to
[17:21] but
[17:22] i'm just kidding they they sat there
[17:24] they're on the court y'all got to find
[17:25] you another place when i start sitting
[17:26] back over there
[17:28] oh okay all right well y'all can be
[17:30] seated
[17:32] thank you for y'all okay i'll say it
[17:33] with paul no i'll say paul said i can
[17:35] sit with him so y'all can sit over there
[17:38] huh uh-huh yeah freddy you stand listen
[17:40] me and june hadn't sat together in years
[17:42] and mom and daddy they just look
[17:44] 60-something years they never sat
[17:45] together now they're sitting together
[17:47] it's been 60-something years they don't
[17:49] sit together during the service it's a
[17:51] distraction
[17:57] if we can't laugh would cry
[17:59] so anyway so let's go to matthew 16 real
[18:02] quick um brother anderson are you in the
[18:04] back yeah we're going to skip over
[18:06] a little bit of this that we covered
[18:08] today
[18:09] and the reason i said pray about the
[18:10] television if y'all can't turn this back
[18:12] off
[18:13] turn it down you can't can y'all see
[18:15] that
[18:16] those little white spots are getting
[18:18] worse and worse and then finally this
[18:20] thing's going to go out this projector's
[18:22] losing some of its bits and it looks
[18:23] kind of like the it was kind of like
[18:25] constellations
[18:28] no that's not what it is
[18:30] but now it looks more like the milky way
[18:33] and then we're going to get into like
[18:35] the nebula and it's going to get worse
[18:36] and worse so we need to get rid of this
[18:38] thing it served its purpose and get
[18:40] those screens but that's why we put that
[18:42] black screen up so some of you in the
[18:44] back won't be able to see it but some up
[18:46] in the front in the front you definitely
[18:47] can see it looks like a bunch of stars
[18:49] done it
[18:50] you could do the constellations because
[18:51] i can see orion's belt right there
[18:55] listen god's first bible was where
[18:57] in the heavens and the stars all right
[18:59] so maybe we'll get back to that but not
[19:01] right now so let's go to matthew 16
[19:03] verse 15
[19:05] and brother richard and them have worked
[19:06] diligently
[19:08] to try to get the uh they're trying to
[19:10] update and get uh new cameras
[19:12] um
[19:14] and everything made into high definition
[19:16] so that we'll have
[19:17] the best
[19:18] brother brown said you should always
[19:20] have the best amen
[19:23] so now let's look at this because i want
[19:25] to cover this this point and then we'll
[19:26] move on because we used this the other
[19:28] day and brother russ called me and we
[19:30] were talking about this and
[19:31] it really helped him so let's read it
[19:34] and then let me make a comment that i
[19:35] didn't make this morning he saith unto
[19:38] them but who says who do you say that i
[19:39] am and simon peter said thou art the
[19:41] christ the son of the living god and
[19:43] jesus answered and sent unto him blessed
[19:45] art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and
[19:46] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[19:49] my father
[19:50] which is in heaven and i say also unto
[19:52] thee that thou art peter and upon this
[19:54] rock i will build my church in other
[19:56] words upon this revelation
[19:58] of the son of god i'll build my church
[20:01] we read the quote where brother ryan
[20:02] said he built his church on the
[20:03] revelation of the son of god he said i
[20:06] will build my church and the gates of
[20:08] hell shall not prevail against him all
[20:10] right so let's go to the next part where
[20:11] it says son of man because that's what
[20:13] we were wanting to cover this morning
[20:15] and i kind of skipped through that
[20:17] but look if you'll take this
[20:19] and and you'll see the virgins and
[20:21] you'll see the wives you see the foolish
[20:23] and what brother russ and i were talking
[20:25] about but the son of man
[20:27] and i kind of hit it briefly the other
[20:28] day but the son of god revelation
[20:31] will put you in the bride
[20:34] everybody got that so we'll do this real
[20:36] quick so son of god revelation is when
[20:38] you bow your head and say god forgive me
[20:40] of my sins and you go through
[20:42] justification sanctification the baptism
[20:44] of holy ghost you become a newborn baby
[20:48] in christ amen
[20:50] okay you become a newborn babe
[20:52] all right but you don't become a fully
[20:54] mature christian until you go up the
[20:56] statue of a perfect man and you add this
[20:58] and you add this then you add this
[21:00] everybody got that amen you're not no
[21:02] less
[21:03] a child of god
[21:06] when you get born again you're born
[21:07] again you're a child of a god
[21:09] but there are positions in different
[21:13] well the bible calls them
[21:15] but it's really you're not going to have
[21:17] a stack of crowns on your head it's
[21:19] going to be
[21:20] an honor bestowed upon you or something
[21:22] given to you that god's going to give
[21:24] you like god gives us certain gifts he
[21:26] did not give me a gift to sing or to
[21:28] play an instrument but he gave you all
[21:29] gifts to do those things so it's like a
[21:32] gift that god gives you so the wise
[21:34] virgins here's the point the wise
[21:36] virgins
[21:38] are under this son of god revelation
[21:41] everybody got that
[21:43] they received they had oil all right so
[21:46] that's down to the church ages
[21:48] now what about the foolish virgins
[21:52] they're not part of this
[21:56] the foolish virgin is not part of this
[22:00] building of my church because they're
[22:02] not part of his church
[22:04] everybody got that
[22:05] the foolish virgins did not get the holy
[22:07] ghost now they may be sitting in the
[22:09] church
[22:11] but jesus ain't talking about sitting in
[22:13] my church he said i'll build
[22:18] i'll build my church on the son of god
[22:21] revelation but it will end on the son of
[22:24] man revelation where we look at the
[22:27] alive and remain that's what me and
[22:29] brother russ is talking about that's the
[22:31] mystery of god is the son of god
[22:33] revelation will put you
[22:36] in the kingdom
[22:37] everybody got there in the kingdom
[22:39] in the my church part or in the bride
[22:42] but it doesn't guarantee you
[22:46] to be part of the son of man revelation
[22:49] the son of man revelation
[22:51] is when paul says we which are alive and
[22:54] remain are behold i show see here's the
[22:57] mystery
[22:59] we shall not all sleep
[23:02] that's the son of man revelation
[23:05] that's the complete revelation of the
[23:07] son of man when the headstone comes to
[23:08] me and you that's the complete
[23:10] revelation of god
[23:12] and that's where the son of man
[23:14] revelation is is that he lie alive and
[23:17] remain so there's a group of people
[23:19] that's not going to die
[23:22] and they can't do that under the son of
[23:24] god revelation because under the son of
[23:26] god revelation sure it puts you in in
[23:28] the body of christ it helps you to grow
[23:30] but it doesn't put you in a position to
[23:33] be the alive and remain
[23:35] all right so everybody got that
[23:37] so there's there's those different
[23:38] groups that you see the wise virgin
[23:40] foolish virgin is not part of building
[23:42] god's church
[23:46] now they may be support they may go to
[23:49] god's church
[23:51] but when he said i will build my church
[23:53] it will be the born-again believers that
[23:56] he's building nothing else
[23:59] now that doesn't say the foolish virgin
[24:01] is not going to make it
[24:04] to eternal the eternal home or the
[24:07] eternal part but they're not going to
[24:08] ever live in the city they're going to
[24:10] have to stay dead for a thousand years
[24:12] they're going to have to come up at the
[24:13] white throne judgment and stand before
[24:15] god
[24:16] and be judged by what they did do and
[24:19] did not do
[24:21] that scares me already
[24:25] right
[24:25] right
[24:26] but if you get born again and become a
[24:28] wise version
[24:29] you don't have to fool with any of that
[24:31] or worry with any of that food because
[24:33] it's foolish
[24:34] for this virgin so everybody got that i
[24:36] was going to try to cover that this
[24:38] morning but with the
[24:39] with the people here that i didn't think
[24:41] they'd understand so
[24:43] so we'll get through we're done through
[24:45] that so now let's go if you don't if you
[24:47] don't mind brother
[24:48] anderson let's go to
[24:53] number
[24:54] one
[24:56] and it will be way on down past jeremiah
[24:58] we read revelation 6 12 today i skipped
[25:01] this quote i want to cover it
[25:04] there you go
[25:06] because i want to read you a scripture
[25:08] that i left out and that you don't have
[25:09] to pull it up but
[25:12] brother brown said notice there's a
[25:14] whole earth to be purged
[25:16] now see we we should we've already
[25:18] covered the two witnesses
[25:20] we've down to the battle of armageddon
[25:22] is everybody okay with that
[25:24] we're at the battle of armageddon notice
[25:26] there's a whole earth to be purged there
[25:28] will be such a thing that the moon stars
[25:30] and all nature will be purged
[25:32] see what it is the earth is renewing
[25:35] herself
[25:36] being purged getting ready for the
[25:38] millennium
[25:39] the millennium's coming and see
[25:41] everything that's got any filth in it is
[25:43] to be purged during the sixth seal
[25:46] now we know that sixth seal is
[25:49] the judgment seal and it is opened by
[25:51] the two prophets everybody got that say
[25:53] amen don't fall asleep on me already
[25:55] i'll be back there sitting with you
[25:57] all right this is important
[25:59] it's not important don't be here
[26:02] because the ones that don't think is
[26:04] important
[26:05] are not here
[26:08] but now look
[26:10] i want to go to where the prophet of god
[26:12] tells us
[26:14] watch this
[26:15] let's go to revelation see if you find
[26:17] revelations 11
[26:19] 14 no stop right there you're gonna have
[26:21] to find it and pull it up you're gonna
[26:22] work overtime today
[26:24] but this struck me the other day just go
[26:26] to revelations 11 try find 11 14. no
[26:29] it's going to be 11 14.
[26:31] i hit it it's hidden and revealed in
[26:33] simplicity
[26:35] but now look what brother brown said
[26:36] everything's got to be purged
[26:37] everything's purged during what the
[26:39] sixth seal
[26:40] all right so that's the that's the
[26:42] armageddon but i want you to see you say
[26:44] well well by the way that's the sixth
[26:46] seal that's right listen the seventh
[26:48] seal the prophet of god tells us that
[26:50] the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet
[26:53] are the same
[26:54] right
[26:56] so what is the seventh trumpet
[27:00] revelations 11 14. now listen six seals
[27:04] purge the earth a battle of armageddon
[27:06] happens everybody got that
[27:08] bell of armageddon kills everything off
[27:10] the earth all right
[27:12] so now watch
[27:13] so what would be the seventh seal would
[27:16] be us entering in because remember we're
[27:18] still in the seventh day
[27:20] in the millennium
[27:22] we'll read that in a minute it's not the
[27:23] eighth day there we go
[27:25] the second woe is past and behold the
[27:28] third woe which is the third war
[27:30] what's the third world war
[27:32] battle of armageddon
[27:34] the third war third woe cometh quickly
[27:38] revelations 11 15 and the seventh angel
[27:40] sounded
[27:41] and there were great voices in heaven
[27:44] saying the kingdoms of this world
[27:46] are become the kingdoms of our lord and
[27:48] of his christ and he shall reign forever
[27:51] and ever
[27:53] everybody got that say amen
[27:55] see that look the seventh that's the
[27:57] seventh trumpet
[27:59] when the seventh trumpet opens is the
[28:01] same as the seventh seal to me and you
[28:03] now when is this going to happen the
[28:05] kingdoms of this world now what is going
[28:07] to be the millennium
[28:10] it's going to be 12 tribes
[28:13] with a kingdom set up
[28:15] jesus christ being the head of that
[28:17] kingdom
[28:19] and you and i are going to sit there
[28:20] with him but what's going to happen
[28:22] before that in our seventh seal is he's
[28:24] going to have to become
[28:27] the kingdoms of this world
[28:31] the kingdoms of this world
[28:34] are they can't become the kingdoms of
[28:35] our lord and of his christ and he shall
[28:37] reign for ever and ever but watch how
[28:38] this brings us on into the millennium
[28:40] and the four and 20 elders
[28:43] which sat before god on their seats fell
[28:45] upon their face and worshiped god
[28:48] saying we give thee thanks o lord god
[28:50] almighty which art and what it art to
[28:52] come because thou has taken to thee thy
[28:54] great power
[28:55] and hath reigned
[28:57] everybody got that
[28:59] so the seventh seal
[29:01] going into the millennium remember going
[29:03] into the millennium you had to have a
[29:04] sick seal to purge the earth right
[29:07] yeah i had to have a sick seal to purge
[29:08] the earth right
[29:10] amen
[29:11] not just not just sanctification like
[29:14] you got before when you stop doing this
[29:15] and stop doing that no
[29:17] no it's when the statue of perfect man
[29:19] comes and this kingdom is now body
[29:22] spirit and soul become the kingdoms of
[29:24] our lord because listen this is not the
[29:26] kingdom of god yet
[29:28] this was brought here by mama and daddy
[29:30] but it will be changed
[29:33] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[29:34] an eye it will be changed listen why is
[29:36] it going to be changed it's going to be
[29:38] changed because what's inside of you
[29:41] and i was praying this week and you know
[29:43] you yeah i'm feeling a lot better than i
[29:45] was last week thank the lord but you're
[29:47] gonna you're gonna have to fight your
[29:49] way through everything you do
[29:52] don't give up
[29:54] fight for every inch of ground if i go i
[29:57] want to go standing up
[29:59] with my boots on
[30:00] amen
[30:03] i mean really
[30:04] what are you going to do
[30:06] just lay there
[30:08] no
[30:09] and i said lord
[30:12] inside of me
[30:14] is the healer
[30:17] amen i have the new birth
[30:20] it's not just the holy ghost and that's
[30:21] it
[30:22] brother bryan said you get everything
[30:24] you need for your journey
[30:25] when you get the holy ghost
[30:27] now we know we got to grow though
[30:29] because a kid has everything every
[30:31] function that kid needs to be an adult
[30:33] has got it at a baby but you don't want
[30:35] to let them do adult things like drive a
[30:37] car and go to work no
[30:39] remember because so you got to grow and
[30:40] develop
[30:43] so i said lord that thing inside of me
[30:45] has got a healer in it
[30:47] let it out how many times have i told
[30:49] y'all we need to let out what we got
[30:51] inside of them
[30:53] it's been so encapsulated and so held
[30:55] together by unbelief and and and not
[30:59] having faith and not reading our bible
[31:01] as much as we should and not praying as
[31:03] much as we should but there it's already
[31:05] in there if you're born again
[31:07] amen the healer's already there
[31:10] you don't have to sometimes i think we
[31:12] pray and want god to come here
[31:16] i thought he always already was
[31:19] i thought when i got up in the morning
[31:20] he was there
[31:23] i'm just sleeping in my natural body
[31:26] god don't have to sleep listen that soul
[31:28] you got inside of you doesn't sleep why
[31:30] do you think you can think and you can
[31:31] do all these things when you're asleep
[31:34] because you got a person inside that's
[31:36] not asleep
[31:38] amen it's not even tired
[31:41] well i'll let that thing out
[31:43] please let the thing out i said lord
[31:45] that thing is inside of me as a healer
[31:47] let it come out and touch this guy right
[31:49] here
[31:50] let it touch this guy right here
[31:53] sure we like to call people we like to
[31:55] have somebody lay hands on us the man is
[31:58] already inside of you if you're born
[31:59] again just let it out
[32:04] i did i stood the other day and i said
[32:06] lord
[32:09] you're already here
[32:11] you're in here
[32:15] the kingdoms of this world
[32:19] have got to yield to what's inside of
[32:21] you already
[32:23] and let me tell you something it's going
[32:25] to yield to what's inside of you if
[32:27] you're not in the kingdom of god it's
[32:29] going to yield to you in the kingdom of
[32:31] the devil
[32:33] because you know what what's inside of
[32:34] you is going to determine what kingdom
[32:36] where you go anyway
[32:38] you're going to stay here and be
[32:39] destroyed by the kingdoms of this world
[32:42] are you going to take a rapture by the
[32:43] kingdoms of what christ yes
[32:47] kingdoms of our lord
[32:49] and his christ and he shall reign for
[32:50] ever another now when ever and ever now
[32:52] that was one i was going to cover this
[32:54] morning
[32:54] so now thank you for pulling it up
[32:57] brother
[32:58] brother anderson excuse me now let's go
[33:00] we know what jacob's trouble is we
[33:02] talked about that this morning
[33:04] and we talked about revelation six we
[33:07] just talked about that he opened the
[33:08] sixth seal but now what is the seventh
[33:10] seal like i said before the seventh seal
[33:12] is the same as the seventh trumpet so we
[33:14] receive our seventh seal saint our
[33:16] seventh seal
[33:17] body change here
[33:19] everybody okay with that
[33:21] six seals purges the earth sabbath
[33:24] brings christ on the scene right
[33:26] amen so now the earth's got to do the
[33:28] same thing
[33:29] the sixth seal purges the natural earth
[33:33] so that who can be who can
[33:35] because remember brother brown said god
[33:36] can't put his feet on the earth till the
[33:38] millennium right his literal feet can't
[33:40] stand on the earth until the millennium
[33:42] because there's sin here
[33:45] now we're going to look and see too that
[33:47] there's sin here
[33:49] he's inside
[33:51] working his way out like i said before
[33:53] you got to let that kingdom become part
[33:54] of this kingdom
[33:56] and you're going to manifest who you are
[33:58] folks we're going to manifest who we are
[34:00] whether we want to or not we can
[34:02] suppress it for years
[34:04] but one day it's going to all come out
[34:06] it's got to because the kingdom
[34:09] is going to have to come into power one
[34:11] way or the other like we were talking
[34:12] about this morning that beast's power
[34:14] he's going to have a kingdom
[34:16] but he's wanting a natural kingdom
[34:19] he's going to set up a natural kingdom
[34:21] ten kings and he wants to go to the
[34:23] world see all the fineries and and we
[34:26] read it last wednesday he wants
[34:28] everything he wants the gold he wants
[34:30] the money he wants the silver he wants
[34:32] to land why do you think these rich
[34:34] people are buying land now
[34:39] they want to possess something
[34:41] they think possessing something is going
[34:42] to keep them here
[34:44] they can have all they want and keep
[34:45] them here because it's going to burn
[34:46] just like all that other stuff's going
[34:48] to burn
[34:50] but see god burned me out one day
[34:53] god burned you out one day
[34:56] oh and did it feel good because i i i
[34:58] was looking at a quote back here i
[35:00] didn't bring it where brother ryan said
[35:02] the most cleansing thing
[35:04] is fire
[35:06] if you want to sterilize something
[35:09] put some fire on it burn it so brother
[35:12] what do we get the holy ghost and
[35:15] fire
[35:16] and that fire is going to burn out all
[35:18] these things and then you still get more
[35:20] fire
[35:21] to burn out all these things in that
[35:23] second realm so that that middle guy can
[35:25] have what
[35:27] have his way with you
[35:29] amen
[35:31] i hope that's good for the young people
[35:32] too because i want you to understand we
[35:34] we talk about things and we talk about
[35:35] what we're going to do and we talk about
[35:36] these worlds but remember it's an it's a
[35:39] type of what you're going through as a
[35:41] born-again believer
[35:44] because you're going to go through it
[35:45] first
[35:46] before the world goes through it so all
[35:48] these things we're going to talk about
[35:49] the battle of armageddon oh that's a
[35:50] horrible thing well it's a battle that
[35:52] me and you have all the time
[35:54] right
[35:55] in our mind the greatest battle ever
[35:57] fault bob read it this morning
[35:59] greatest battle ever fought is the
[36:00] battle of armageddon in your brain
[36:02] but remember it will come to an end
[36:06] i just read you that old things will
[36:07] pass away behold all things will become
[36:09] new amen right so the kingdom of this
[36:11] world so the seventh seal that we get
[36:13] here the earth is going to literally get
[36:16] one in the millennium
[36:20] because i'm gonna read it to you in a
[36:21] minute there was a promise to king david
[36:24] that he would sit on a throne
[36:27] and rule the 12 tribes of israel
[36:30] in a house or in a temple
[36:33] and that's what's going to happen in the
[36:34] millennium because remember see it's not
[36:35] to us
[36:37] we've already been changed we've already
[36:39] had all that done but they're go there's
[36:40] going to have some people in the
[36:41] millennium that's going to have to come
[36:43] through
[36:45] i will read it here in a minute but
[36:46] there's going to be a heathen and
[36:48] different things but i want to try to
[36:49] get to that
[36:51] today so let's skip over all this down
[36:54] to
[36:56] oh let's see
[36:58] let's go down to quote number two
[37:01] um on our regular notes and thank you
[37:03] for doing that brother
[37:04] anderson whoever else is back there
[37:08] right after revelations 11 7 that's kind
[37:10] of where we were at this morning
[37:13] the two prophets are killed
[37:15] and then we come to the 70 weeks of
[37:16] daniel now watch
[37:20] now let me stop right here just a minute
[37:22] that you might know beyond one shadow of
[37:23] a doubt that i just wouldn't take that
[37:25] one place i can take it through the
[37:26] entire scripture and prove to you that
[37:28] seven days
[37:29] that seven one week is seven years
[37:31] remember we did it in the bibles in
[37:32] genesis
[37:33] i just did it over here in revelation
[37:35] the 13th chapter 11 chapter and third
[37:37] verse look then prophets will prophesy
[37:38] 1200 three score days which is in the
[37:41] midst of the last week after the three
[37:43] and a half years then they're cut off
[37:45] and armageddon sets in so now we're in
[37:47] armageddon so let's continue on with
[37:50] that let's go to the next one
[37:52] number three
[37:53] now here's what we were talking about
[37:54] last week now when he gets the money
[37:56] who's the he this is the beast the
[37:57] antichrist
[37:58] all right when he gets the money now
[38:00] look
[38:01] to be able to get the money he's got to
[38:03] have a system in place
[38:06] he's got to have a kingdom in place he's
[38:08] got to have a his own revelation in
[38:10] place
[38:13] and see you're being deceived by it now
[38:15] if you're not born again
[38:17] you don't have to wait till till the
[38:19] middle of the 70th week of daniel if
[38:21] you're not born again you're deceived
[38:22] under it now
[38:24] because remember he deceives the whole
[38:26] world with this
[38:27] except the people that are sealed by the
[38:29] baptism of the holy ghost now when he
[38:31] gets the money all under control
[38:33] then he breaks this covenant with the
[38:34] jews as daniel here said he would do in
[38:37] the midst of the last half of the 70
[38:38] weeks of daniel
[38:40] and then brother what will he do
[38:42] he will have all of the world trade and
[38:45] commerce
[38:46] and packed with the world
[38:48] now listen at this point in time the
[38:50] world can't get together on nothing
[38:53] right
[38:54] something's gotta happen supernaturally
[38:59] because naturally it'll never happen
[39:02] you can't even get something to come to
[39:03] the league of nations you can't get
[39:04] someone to come to the pack of eight the
[39:06] pack of ten the pack of four and
[39:08] whatever they got going on some of them
[39:10] ain't coming why because they've got so
[39:11] many differences somewhere this is all
[39:13] all these differences are going to have
[39:14] to head under one person
[39:18] and what will it head under religion
[39:23] a pact with the world because he'll hold
[39:25] the wealth of the world completely and
[39:27] during that time then two prophets will
[39:29] rise on the scene and call 144 thousand
[39:31] you you think he's you think brother
[39:33] brown's off but listen that thing's
[39:35] being set up now
[39:37] we were talking downstairs listen
[39:40] ronald reagan was a good president let
[39:42] me put that he was a good president he
[39:44] was good for the economy he was good for
[39:46] america but i'm telling you it's like
[39:48] brother paul said his name was
[39:50] ronald
[39:51] wilson
[39:53] reagan six
[39:54] six six
[39:56] he was a good president
[39:58] but when he got with that pope and
[40:00] destroyed russia he set up the one world
[40:03] government
[40:04] under the pope
[40:07] that was back in the 80s folks
[40:10] for those of you are going who's ronald
[40:12] reagan
[40:13] he was a president in the united states
[40:15] back before some of y'all were even born
[40:18] okay but you'll read about if you'll
[40:19] stay awake in school
[40:21] but he was he was a great economist
[40:23] though the world the united states grew
[40:25] exponentially during his time we had a
[40:27] real good economic he was a good
[40:29] economic president but what he done
[40:31] he got with the pope and they destroyed
[40:33] russia and that
[40:34] took the
[40:35] it took the bear and broke the bear up
[40:38] russia
[40:39] ussr
[40:41] broke it up under
[40:43] who did it him and the pope
[40:46] the beast
[40:49] and the lamb
[40:52] they came up out of the sea
[40:54] with the two horns
[40:56] they did it
[40:58] in the 80s
[41:00] so this thing is not going to have to
[41:01] wait till the
[41:03] you know every how many years it is from
[41:04] now
[41:05] it's being set up now
[41:07] it's just going to keep snowballing when
[41:09] we leave
[41:10] because he's going to take over the
[41:12] wealth of the whole world
[41:14] so during this time two prophets will
[41:15] rise on the scene call 144 000 then what
[41:17] will take place then the mark of the
[41:18] beast revelation 13 will set in because
[41:20] he holds all the commerce trading
[41:22] everything of the world and what will
[41:23] take place then the mark of the beast
[41:24] will come in that no man can buy or sell
[41:26] now listen that is not the mark of the
[41:28] beast that you can't buy or sell
[41:34] go back again folks the mark of the
[41:36] beast is unbelief
[41:38] the mark of the beast is not born being
[41:39] born again the mark of the beast is not
[41:41] buying and selling food
[41:44] but it is under that system of the mark
[41:47] of the beast everybody got that okay
[41:50] thank god the church will be enjoying a
[41:52] great three and a half years in glory
[41:53] don't go through that
[41:55] so that's what we don't have to go
[41:57] through that all right so now
[41:59] we don't have to look at the chart just
[42:01] keep going
[42:03] revelations 19 verse 6
[42:06] no me and you are going to leave so i
[42:08] heard it was the voice of great
[42:10] multitude the voice of many waters the
[42:11] voice of mighty thundering saying
[42:12] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[42:14] reigneth this is not israel this is the
[42:16] bride
[42:17] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[42:19] honor to him for the what marriage of
[42:20] the lamb now remember israel can't marry
[42:23] god that's right
[42:24] they're devo he's divorced him she can't
[42:26] marry her again
[42:28] okay
[42:29] but he marries us
[42:31] and his wife has made herself ready and
[42:33] to her was granted that she should be
[42:35] arrayed and find linen clean and white
[42:36] for the fine linen and his righteousness
[42:38] of the saints in other words we took a
[42:39] body change and we've gone
[42:42] all right blessed are they which called
[42:44] to the marriage supper of the lamb and
[42:45] he said unto them these are the true
[42:46] sayings of god so we take a rapture so
[42:49] we're going to go through this real
[42:50] quick go again
[42:54] now when we go into rapture then
[42:56] tribulation starts on the world we were
[42:58] just talking about that the sixth seal
[43:00] so i saw three unclean spirits like frog
[43:02] i didn't want to get into this while
[43:03] some of them were here
[43:04] this morning so because we know we know
[43:07] what those unclean spirits were
[43:10] it was a trinitarian doctrine but listen
[43:12] it's all doctrine it's false with god
[43:15] it's not just but it is strange that
[43:17] it's three
[43:18] three unclean unclean spirits not clean
[43:21] spirits unclean spirits like frogs
[43:24] but what now look it's the doctrine that
[43:26] comes out of the mouth of the dragon out
[43:29] of the mouth of the beast in the mouth
[43:30] of the false prophet listen they all
[43:32] three are one
[43:34] because they've got the same attitude
[43:36] they've got the same
[43:39] doctrine
[43:40] okay
[43:42] so the three unclean spirits like frogs
[43:44] brother brown said was the trinitarian
[43:45] doctrine the father son holy ghost
[43:48] uh split up of god in three
[43:51] and also the father son holy ghost
[43:53] baptism because they're all false
[43:56] if they're false they're of the devil
[43:57] they're unclean
[43:59] for they are the spirits of devils
[44:01] working miracles which go forth unto the
[44:03] kings of the earth listen what y'all
[44:05] going to do
[44:07] what y'all going to do one day when
[44:10] a guy comes up and says
[44:14] you got to go to a certain place in the
[44:16] united states
[44:18] and sit under a tape ministry
[44:22] and we know that's false
[44:26] but what if they start having miracles
[44:27] one right after the other
[44:35] what if you go to these people that are
[44:36] thinking about this yesterday what if
[44:37] you go to these people that have left
[44:39] the message
[44:40] and then god still got these churches
[44:42] and you hear these churches are having
[44:44] revival
[44:45] they're having the sick healed the dead
[44:47] raised
[44:49] one right after the other
[44:51] what are you going to do
[44:53] well it must be right brother wade no
[44:59] what's verse 14 say
[45:02] for they are the spirits of devils
[45:04] working miracles
[45:07] which go forth unto the kings of the
[45:09] earth and the whole world to gather them
[45:10] together in a great battle of
[45:12] hey we're in a battle like i said now
[45:15] right
[45:16] but what are you going to do
[45:18] when you pick somebody picks up the
[45:19] phone and says hey
[45:21] brother so and so they left the message
[45:23] man they're having they're having a
[45:24] revival they've got people sick healed
[45:26] they got the dead raised they got all
[45:28] these mighty miracles
[45:31] well what are they saying about brother
[45:32] brown oh he was false well what are you
[45:34] going to do
[45:38] i'm asking you because you're going to
[45:40] be deceived if you're not sealed
[45:46] now jesus says behold i come as a thief
[45:48] blesses he that watches keepeth his
[45:50] garment lest he walk naked and they see
[45:52] a shame and he gathered them into a
[45:54] place called in the hebrew tongue
[45:57] armageddon and the seventh angel poured
[45:58] out his vile this is the last of the
[46:00] vials into the air and there came a
[46:01] great voice out of the temple of god
[46:03] from the throne saying
[46:05] it is done
[46:07] there were voices and thundering
[46:08] enlightening great earthquakes such as
[46:09] nonsense men upon the earth so
[46:11] tribulation so mighty an earthquake and
[46:13] so great and the great city was divided
[46:15] into three parts and the cities of the
[46:16] nations fell
[46:18] this is a worldwide event and babylon
[46:20] came in remembrance before god had given
[46:22] to her the cup of the wine of the
[46:23] fierceness of his wrath and every island
[46:25] fled away and the mountains were not
[46:27] found don't get scared folks we're not
[46:29] here
[46:31] don't get scared children don't get
[46:33] scared we're not going to be here if
[46:34] you're born again you're not going to be
[46:35] here
[46:36] and there fell upon men a great hell out
[46:38] of heaven every stone about the weight
[46:39] of a talent about 90 pounds in other
[46:42] words
[46:44] have you ever seen what a hail storm
[46:46] will do in the hail storm the hail is
[46:47] only about maybe the size of a golf ball
[46:49] or even maybe a tennis ball
[46:51] think about it they were weighing 90
[46:53] pounds they'll just they'll crush a
[46:54] building
[46:56] and men blasphemed god because of the
[46:58] plague of the hail for the plague
[46:59] thereof was exceeding great let's go to
[47:01] the next one
[47:03] victor victory day brother brown says
[47:06] it'll finally wind up into the great
[47:08] battle of armageddon that'll be the last
[47:10] of it when she comes to the battle of
[47:11] armageddon that'll settle the whole
[47:12] thing
[47:13] just before the great millennium the
[47:15] armageddon is to clean off the earth
[47:17] see
[47:19] that's what i was when brother claude
[47:20] was preaching the other day you see that
[47:22] sixth seal that sixth seal is opened by
[47:24] those two prophets while they're here
[47:27] and judgment strikes the world
[47:29] through those two prophets but it
[47:31] continues on in through into the battle
[47:33] of armageddon and until everything's
[47:36] destroyed so that six seals not just a
[47:38] boom it's not just an event that just
[47:39] happened because listen your cleaning
[47:42] off is not a one day event that just
[47:44] happens if you're under the sixth seal
[47:46] sanctification of your nature it takes
[47:49] time
[47:51] just like under this battle of
[47:52] armageddon it's going to take time it's
[47:54] not a one-day battle
[47:56] just before the great millennium
[47:57] armageddon is to clean off the earth
[48:00] she re-purifies herself with this atomic
[48:02] blowing so man is going to do it it's
[48:04] going to be an atomic explosion it's
[48:07] going to be men pushing buttons
[48:10] and it's going to be just a nuclear
[48:12] holocaust but it's going to be worldwide
[48:15] not just in one place
[48:17] she re-purifies herself with this atomic
[48:19] blowing and the volcanic ash and things
[48:21] sink
[48:22] this soak the blood of men and upon the
[48:24] earth in sin and crime she sinks beneath
[48:26] the earth the volcanic braze out again
[48:28] and renews and cleans the earth for the
[48:29] great millennium he cleans his church
[48:31] during that time for a people to live
[48:33] here amen i like that see there's coming
[48:35] a time when it'll be great all right
[48:37] let's continue on
[48:39] now
[48:40] what did we say after the battle of
[48:42] armageddon was over what's going to
[48:44] happen
[48:45] there's going to be a millennial temple
[48:47] built it by the jews
[48:51] all right so we know the 144 thousand
[48:53] they die the two prophets die they go on
[48:55] a rapture the battle of armageddon
[48:57] happens here on earth and then they've
[48:58] got to come back sometime and build this
[49:00] temple or who's going to build it
[49:03] we don't know and it's not our business
[49:06] none of our business
[49:07] all right because but but listen to
[49:10] fulfill
[49:13] let's stop just a minute real quick
[49:15] daniel 70 weeks remember what is that 70
[49:18] weeks are determined upon thy people and
[49:20] what else the city
[49:22] now for 69 weeks back before christ
[49:25] they've they've destroyed jerusalem
[49:27] titus after christ was
[49:29] crucified in 1870 titus totally
[49:32] destroyed jerusalem and it's never been
[49:34] built back since
[49:37] never been built back now sure they've
[49:38] got the buildings there i'm talking
[49:40] about the temple
[49:41] the temple's never been
[49:43] restored
[49:45] all right so the temple is going to be
[49:46] restored in the millennium because it
[49:48] will and i mean before the millennium
[49:52] because it's got to take that daniel 70
[49:53] weeks that last week
[49:58] pay attention
[50:00] three and a half years the prophets
[50:01] prophesy and they're cut off there's
[50:03] three and a half more years
[50:05] left
[50:08] to put this temple in
[50:10] because it's to thy people and what
[50:13] the city so it's got to restore the
[50:14] people now who how's the people going to
[50:17] be restored through to prophets
[50:20] restore the people
[50:22] um end of sin reconciliation for
[50:24] iniquity they're going to be born again
[50:26] believers all right
[50:28] amen
[50:29] but now what about the city it's laying
[50:32] in complete destruction because
[50:33] armageddon is going to clean her off
[50:35] even if they tried to build it back
[50:37] and brother brown said that the mosque
[50:38] of omar they'll put a bomb right down in
[50:40] the middle of it so it's going to blow
[50:42] it completely to smithereens so where's
[50:44] the city they got to build one
[50:47] ezekiel 40 in the 5th and 20th year of
[50:49] our captivity in the beginning of the
[50:50] year and the 10th day of the month and
[50:52] the 14th year
[50:53] after that the city was smitten
[50:55] in other words it was destroyed
[50:58] and the self same day the hand of the
[50:59] lord was upon me and brought me thither
[51:01] and the visions of god now what is a
[51:03] vision it's a vision of something that's
[51:04] going to happen
[51:06] brought me into the land of israel
[51:09] set me up on a very high mountain by
[51:11] which was the frame of a city on the
[51:14] south
[51:15] and he brought me through there and
[51:16] behold there was a man whose appearance
[51:18] was like the appearance of brass with a
[51:19] line of flax in his hand and a measuring
[51:21] reed and he stood at the gate and the
[51:23] man said unto me son of man behold with
[51:26] thine eyes and hear with thine ears and
[51:28] set down hard upon all that i shall show
[51:30] thee for to the intent that i might show
[51:33] them unto thee art thou brought hither
[51:35] declare all that thou see us to the
[51:37] house of israel now from ezekiel 40
[51:40] through ezekiel 44 it gives you all the
[51:43] dimensions tells you how many how many
[51:45] where the temple is going to be and how
[51:47] much the dimensions are and i'm not
[51:49] going to get into that because they're
[51:50] going to build it
[51:52] see there's the restoration of the
[51:54] people has already been done
[51:56] now comes the restoration of the city in
[51:59] the last half of the 70 weeks of daniel
[52:01] everybody got that say amen
[52:03] all right we've been taught this many
[52:04] many for many many years all right
[52:06] so now let's go to the next
[52:08] number five six full purpose
[52:13] now look when the tabernacle is erected
[52:16] the resurrection has come
[52:18] the jews has returned
[52:20] christ and his bride has come the jew
[52:22] the 144 000 are sealed the millenniums
[52:26] in other words taking place
[52:28] there will be an anointing
[52:30] when the most holy place
[52:33] will be anointed now what are they doing
[52:35] they're building the temple
[52:38] outer court inner court holy of holies
[52:41] everybody got that
[52:44] because that's the rest restoration of
[52:47] the city now remember it's not the new
[52:50] city
[52:51] that's ours
[52:53] it's the tabernacle that god promised
[52:56] david he would sit on a throne and rule
[53:00] the 12 tribes of israel so there's got
[53:02] to be a city belt for them to do that in
[53:04] all right
[53:06] i'll read some more quotes it'll clarify
[53:07] it here in just a minute
[53:09] for there will be an anointing when the
[53:10] most holy place will be anointed the
[53:12] holy holy of holies and the most holy
[53:15] the most holy place is a sanctuary where
[53:17] god lived between the cherubims
[53:19] now remember there was an outer court
[53:21] right
[53:22] there was an inner court
[53:24] and there was a holy of holies now where
[53:26] was god
[53:28] he wasn't in the outer court
[53:31] he wasn't in the inner court so much as
[53:33] they had the little things they had to
[53:34] do where was god he came down in the
[53:37] inner court and only one priest went in
[53:40] there
[53:41] and did his job and then came back out
[53:43] everybody got there
[53:45] so that's the holiest of holies now
[53:47] remember same thing with me and you
[53:49] outer court
[53:51] inner court memories and conscious
[53:53] imagination holy of holies is where god
[53:56] is
[53:57] me and you that's where god is with us
[53:59] he's inside that holy of holies
[54:02] now
[54:03] what's going to happen here though
[54:05] and and i you know when we studied
[54:07] daniel 70 weeks i thought man where did
[54:08] brother burnham but it's really simple
[54:12] you would think
[54:13] now see here we got to go back just a
[54:15] minute you will think you would think
[54:16] that we have nothing to do with it being
[54:18] gentiles
[54:20] which we don't
[54:22] in building the temple right
[54:24] but where is the holiest of holy people
[54:27] at
[54:29] amen it's us
[54:34] it's us
[54:35] that's why brother brown got the
[54:37] revelation that when when the temple was
[54:39] to be anointed
[54:41] it would not be anointed by a cloud
[54:44] because remember back in solomon's time
[54:47] solomon they dedicated the tabernacle
[54:49] what happened god came down in the cloud
[54:51] and filled the whole place
[54:53] all right
[54:56] the jews sure they're holy
[54:59] but they had a they had a uh their
[55:01] distinction was to build the city
[55:04] and they're not second-rate citizens
[55:05] don't get me wrong but they turned god
[55:07] down so he couldn't make them bride
[55:09] so they can't be the holiest of holies
[55:12] the holiest of holies is me and you
[55:14] there's no holier people on the face of
[55:17] the earth are in heaven
[55:19] besides jesus christ and his bride and i
[55:21] thought we were one yes
[55:23] all right so what comes to that
[55:25] sanctuary is they're going to build this
[55:27] temple
[55:28] and the and 144 000 are going to build
[55:31] this temple and they're going to build
[55:32] it exactly the way ezekiel said and then
[55:35] we come riding back in the millennium
[55:37] we're going to be able to go into that
[55:39] holy of holies because that's who
[55:40] they're that's what they're waiting on
[55:43] they're waiting on the temple
[55:46] to be i don't say re-anointed but to be
[55:49] anointed and it can't be anointed by
[55:51] nobody
[55:53] but christ in the bride
[55:56] the most holy place is a sanctuary where
[55:58] god lived between the cherubims and this
[56:00] time this time christ will set in the
[56:03] most holy place with the anointing upon
[56:05] him what is anointing that's upon him
[56:09] me and you
[56:11] they'll need no sun there for the lamb
[56:13] is the midst of the city shall be the
[56:14] light the sun will never go down in that
[56:16] city as old uncle jim used to say
[56:18] and it never will because christ will be
[56:19] that light the anointed one and the king
[56:21] will come and take his throne for one
[56:23] thousand years
[56:25] to reign let's go to the next
[56:28] now revelations 19. now we read
[56:30] revelations 19 the first world we went
[56:32] up the marriage of the lamb has come
[56:33] we've been at the marriage supper now
[56:35] what's happening at the end of all this
[56:37] to three and a half years of preaching
[56:39] the battle of armageddon they have built
[56:42] the temple and then you and i come
[56:44] riding back into the temple to start the
[56:47] millenniums everybody got that
[56:53] and i saw a new i saw heaven open behold
[56:56] a white horse and he that sat on him was
[56:58] called faithful and true and in
[56:59] righteousness he does judge and make war
[57:05] you got to read this right
[57:08] because remember
[57:12] we're the judge
[57:14] in the future home right before you go
[57:16] into the future home there's a white
[57:18] throne judgment
[57:19] so this is clearly telling you that it's
[57:21] going into the millennium
[57:23] not into the future home
[57:25] because he's going to be a he's death
[57:26] judge and mate war
[57:28] his eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[57:30] head were many crowns he had a name
[57:32] written that no one knew but he himself
[57:34] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[57:36] in blood
[57:37] and his name is called the word of god
[57:39] and the armies which were in heaven
[57:40] followed him upon white horses clothed
[57:43] in fine linen white and clean that's us
[57:46] and out of his mouth goes a
[57:48] sharp sword that with it he should smite
[57:50] the nations now watch
[57:52] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[57:54] iron now i didn't bring it but in the
[57:55] old testament that's exactly what he's
[57:58] going to do in the millennium he's going
[58:00] to rule the 12 tribes of israel not with
[58:03] a rod of iron but he's going to be their
[58:04] king
[58:06] not with a literal rod you understand
[58:07] what i'm saying you got to look at the
[58:08] allegories and he traded the wine press
[58:10] of the wine press of the fierceness and
[58:12] wrath of almighty god and he hath on his
[58:14] veteran on his thigh name written
[58:17] king of kings
[58:19] and lord of lords
[58:21] let's go to number six and see what
[58:22] brother brown has to say about that
[58:24] what is it
[58:26] his people had just crowned him king of
[58:28] kings and lord of lords
[58:30] coming back to his holy temple anointed
[58:32] with the presence of god
[58:34] to live and reign through the millennium
[58:36] with his church amen the appearing with
[58:38] the mighty king to take her place
[58:44] her place
[58:46] who's to her
[58:47] me and
[58:48] you he has no other wife
[58:51] when you hear the word her
[58:54] attacked onto god that's me and you
[58:57] because you don't have two or three
[58:58] wives
[59:00] the appearing of the mighty king to take
[59:02] her place at his side
[59:05] the new royal anointed temple
[59:08] now the sixfold purpose of revelation 6
[59:10] 1 to revelation 19 is fulfilled what's
[59:13] the last purpose of the sixth full
[59:14] purpose
[59:15] to anoint the most holy
[59:18] so the scripture fits right in let's go
[59:20] to number seven
[59:23] back in the 70 weeks of daniel now
[59:25] notice
[59:26] that's where we seen her coming back to
[59:27] the millennial temple over here look at
[59:30] the end
[59:31] of the jewish age
[59:33] what is the end of the jewish age the
[59:35] last half of that 70th week to finish
[59:37] daniel 70 weeks all right
[59:40] at the end of the jewish age the
[59:41] anointed here he comes riding on a white
[59:44] horse those follow him on white horse
[59:46] horses powers
[59:48] dressed in white blood or vesture dipped
[59:50] in blood wrote on him the word of god he
[59:52] cometh the mighty conqueror to set up
[59:54] the millennium coming to the temple
[59:56] glory there he meets
[59:59] that hundred and forty four thousand
[1:00:01] because see he's coming to the he's
[1:00:02] coming into the millennium not to meet
[1:00:04] me and you
[1:00:05] we've been with him the whole time
[1:00:08] but he comes to meet that 144 000 that's
[1:00:10] been sent down here to build that temple
[1:00:12] on the earth to finish the 70 weeks of
[1:00:15] daniel so let's continue on
[1:00:21] now look
[1:00:23] this is the order and then we'll start
[1:00:25] in the millennium and we'll just for a
[1:00:26] few minutes ah the church age ending is
[1:00:29] blacked out the bride is called and
[1:00:31] we've already entered into tribulation
[1:00:32] this is a question someone asked him he
[1:00:35] said no no no i wish that i could not i
[1:00:37] could just have more time on that scene
[1:00:39] the bride when she's taken from the
[1:00:41] church then the church age will cease
[1:00:44] laodicea goes into chaos
[1:00:46] the bride goes to glory
[1:00:48] tribulation period sets in upon the
[1:00:50] sleeping virgins that's what we've just
[1:00:51] been talking about
[1:00:52] for three and a half years while israel
[1:00:54] is getting its prophecy the two
[1:00:56] witnesses then tribulation sets in upon
[1:00:58] israel
[1:01:00] and then comes the battle of armageddon
[1:01:02] which destroys all things
[1:01:04] look and then the bride returns back
[1:01:06] with the groom for a thousand years the
[1:01:09] millennium reign after that comes to
[1:01:11] white throne judgment after that comes a
[1:01:13] new heaven and the earth the new city
[1:01:14] coming down from god out of heaven
[1:01:16] eternity and time blends together now
[1:01:18] remember what we're fixing to talk to
[1:01:19] talk about in the millennium we're still
[1:01:22] in time
[1:01:24] it's not
[1:01:25] now brother i'm seeing eternity and time
[1:01:27] blends together that's when the new city
[1:01:29] comes down
[1:01:31] this city that they build
[1:01:34] over there in israel is not our new city
[1:01:37] that's still reserved in the mind of god
[1:01:40] waiting on revelations over there when
[1:01:41] he sees the new city coming down
[1:01:44] out of heaven so now listen
[1:01:47] why do we have to have this millennium
[1:01:49] all right there's millennialists i've
[1:01:51] read about several ones
[1:01:54] brother branham quotes about a few of
[1:01:56] them so let's read though where do we
[1:01:58] get
[1:01:59] a millennium everybody wake up just for
[1:02:00] a minute
[1:02:02] everybody wake up just for a minute okay
[1:02:04] everybody wait now
[1:02:05] blow that chauffeur
[1:02:07] what do you do it's not even
[1:02:11] don't come anymore without it
[1:02:18] yes
[1:02:18] sir now i want you to blow and blow it
[1:02:21] backwards you know blow it back that way
[1:02:25] think of peter 3 8. now look we talk
[1:02:27] about a millennium this is why we're
[1:02:28] going to have a millennium does
[1:02:29] everybody know why we're going to have
[1:02:30] one
[1:02:32] all right some do not take it peter 3 8
[1:02:35] says beloved
[1:02:37] be not ignorant of this one thing
[1:02:39] that one day is with the lord as a
[1:02:41] thousand years
[1:02:42] and a thousand years as one day
[1:02:45] all right that's bible got it so now
[1:02:48] let's turn to genesis 2 verse 17.
[1:02:52] god is telling
[1:02:55] adam
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] that remember the conditional covenant
[1:02:59] was talking about this morning it was a
[1:03:01] conditional covenant
[1:03:03] do eat this don't eat that
[1:03:06] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:03:08] evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[1:03:10] day
[1:03:12] now what did peter say a thousand years
[1:03:16] is a day
[1:03:17] a day is a thousand years
[1:03:20] for in the day not today listen
[1:03:23] if if eve would have fell dead when she
[1:03:26] did what she did he would demand one day
[1:03:28] 24 hour day right
[1:03:30] but she did not
[1:03:32] she lived whatever 900 years like like
[1:03:34] adam did
[1:03:36] so we know that god can't lie
[1:03:39] so we know that that's what he was
[1:03:40] meaning for in the thousand years or in
[1:03:43] the day that you eat thereof thou shalt
[1:03:44] surely die methuselah live how long
[1:03:48] 969 years we everybody knows that why
[1:03:51] because nobody's ever lived a thousand
[1:03:53] years
[1:03:54] the curse in the garden made sure no one
[1:03:57] lived over a thousand years so what is a
[1:03:59] millennium going to do
[1:04:02] it's going to bring it right back up and
[1:04:04] make that true because they have taken
[1:04:06] then of the tree of life
[1:04:08] and they're going to live a thousand
[1:04:10] years to prove that the sin curse is
[1:04:12] over with somebody has got to live a
[1:04:14] thousand years now it's not me and you
[1:04:18] we're eternal
[1:04:19] we don't have a day or a night
[1:04:21] so somebody's got to be in that
[1:04:23] millennium
[1:04:24] to live a thousand years
[1:04:27] now this is where it might get a little
[1:04:28] bit sticky but
[1:04:29] listen look brother brown they asked him
[1:04:31] one time and i think i got it for later
[1:04:33] they said brother brown will children be
[1:04:35] born in the millennium he says looks
[1:04:37] like they could
[1:04:38] looks like they couldn't
[1:04:41] then he talks about a heathen being
[1:04:42] raised up in the millennium to be
[1:04:44] preached to
[1:04:45] so there's some things in that i don't
[1:04:47] understand but listen remember let's
[1:04:49] just get the gist of where we're at and
[1:04:50] what we're doing and then we'll let the
[1:04:52] lord reveal it to us because if he
[1:04:55] reveals it to us we ain't got to worry
[1:04:56] about we don't speculate and we don't
[1:04:58] assume because you know what that does
[1:04:59] when you assume
[1:05:01] okay
[1:05:03] isaiah 65 17.
[1:05:06] i learned that a long time ago
[1:05:10] now here's isaiah
[1:05:12] behold i create new heavens
[1:05:15] and a new earth
[1:05:17] and the former shall not be remembered
[1:05:19] nor come into mind
[1:05:21] but be glad and rejoice forever in that
[1:05:23] which i create
[1:05:25] for behold i create
[1:05:28] jerusalem
[1:05:33] a rejoicing
[1:05:34] and her people a joy
[1:05:37] it's not a very joyful place over there
[1:05:38] now i'll promise you that
[1:05:42] and i will rejoice in jerusalem
[1:05:44] and join my people
[1:05:46] and the voice of weeping shall be no
[1:05:48] more heard in her no the voice of crying
[1:05:50] there shall be no more thence and then
[1:05:52] thence an infant of days nor an old man
[1:05:54] that hath not filled his day see this is
[1:05:56] the part i don't understand
[1:05:58] maybe the lord will reveal it to you and
[1:05:59] you can help me with it for the child
[1:06:01] shall die a hundred years old but now
[1:06:03] listen
[1:06:04] there's nowhere brother brown said that
[1:06:06] people couldn't die in the millennium
[1:06:10] nowhere
[1:06:11] and there's nowhere in the bible except
[1:06:12] right here
[1:06:15] so
[1:06:16] let's don't get all messed up with it
[1:06:17] because listen remember it's not to me
[1:06:18] and you you and i are to sit and rule
[1:06:20] and reign over that group of people ever
[1:06:22] what that group of people is all right
[1:06:25] but the center being a hundred years old
[1:06:27] shall be a curse see that's
[1:06:29] i'm having an issue with that i'm just
[1:06:31] going to be honest with you i don't know
[1:06:32] everything brother call him out but i
[1:06:33] don't know nothing
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:38] i don't know nothing either there
[1:06:40] and look and they shall build houses
[1:06:43] here's the key they shall build houses
[1:06:46] and inhabit them
[1:06:48] so we know this is not the future home
[1:06:50] because remember the future home you
[1:06:51] don't build that house you're building
[1:06:53] you're building it right now
[1:06:56] this is your part of the future home
[1:06:57] right here by your new birth will give
[1:07:00] you a place to live
[1:07:01] in the future home so we don't have to
[1:07:03] build anything
[1:07:04] you say brother brother they're gonna
[1:07:06] build i think
[1:07:07] it says they will
[1:07:11] and listen they don't built a temple
[1:07:13] before this
[1:07:15] you say built it with what
[1:07:17] here's my here's my take on this whole
[1:07:19] thing
[1:07:20] and this is just me and i may be wrong
[1:07:22] as rain
[1:07:23] but remember it's an atomic war
[1:07:26] so it's not going to be
[1:07:28] that this place is going when we walk
[1:07:30] back down here the bible tells us that
[1:07:32] we'll walk out on the ashes of the
[1:07:35] wicked
[1:07:37] so we're not going to walk out in this
[1:07:39] clean like the new city is going to be
[1:07:41] everybody understand that
[1:07:44] because remember there's not sin in the
[1:07:46] millennium but there's still sin
[1:07:48] there
[1:07:49] underneath
[1:07:51] everybody got that
[1:07:52] all right so we got to get this out of
[1:07:53] the way but my take on it is
[1:07:56] if if the if the
[1:07:59] atomic
[1:08:01] doesn't blow everything up let's put it
[1:08:02] that way
[1:08:04] there's still stuff here
[1:08:06] there's going to be probably still trees
[1:08:07] that make it and there's still going to
[1:08:08] be other things that make it because
[1:08:10] they got builded by something
[1:08:13] rocks
[1:08:15] sticks
[1:08:17] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[1:08:18] they shall not build in another inhabit
[1:08:20] but it says and they shall build houses
[1:08:22] and inhabit them and it's not just one
[1:08:25] house because it says houses
[1:08:27] and look they shall plant vineyards and
[1:08:28] eat the fruit of them where are they
[1:08:30] going to get the seed from if there's
[1:08:32] not something left over
[1:08:39] they shall not build in another inhabit
[1:08:41] in other words
[1:08:44] your daddy bills you know your grandpa
[1:08:45] builds a house and then he passes away
[1:08:47] and gives that house to you and and then
[1:08:50] daddy passes away and he gives that
[1:08:52] house to you that's not what that that
[1:08:54] says you'll build it and not another
[1:08:56] will inhabit it for this whole thousand
[1:08:59] years they shall not plant and another
[1:09:01] eat for as the days of a tree are the
[1:09:04] days of my people and mine elect shall
[1:09:06] long enjoy the works of their hands
[1:09:10] you and i are not going to be doing that
[1:09:13] with the bride
[1:09:15] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[1:09:17] forth for trouble
[1:09:19] for they are the seed of the blessed of
[1:09:21] the lord and their offsprings
[1:09:24] with them now you can claim that one
[1:09:26] of them
[1:09:27] and it shall come to pass that before
[1:09:29] they call i will answer and while they
[1:09:31] are yet speaking i will hear
[1:09:34] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:09:36] together and the lion shall eat straw
[1:09:37] like the bullet that's going to be kind
[1:09:38] of funny to see a lion walk up with them
[1:09:41] great big old teeth sticking down like
[1:09:42] this like this right here
[1:09:44] and they start pulling grass up out of
[1:09:46] the ground yeah
[1:09:48] but that's the way it was supposed to be
[1:09:49] in right that's the way it was before
[1:09:51] the fall
[1:09:53] eat straw like the bullock and dust
[1:09:54] shall be the serpent's meat
[1:09:56] i guess we're gonna have snakes there
[1:09:57] too
[1:09:58] they shall not hurt nor destroy in all
[1:10:01] my holy
[1:10:02] mountain
[1:10:04] saith the lord all right let's go to the
[1:10:05] next one
[1:10:06] isaiah 66
[1:10:10] now to me this is the millennium
[1:10:13] the new heavens it always stays singular
[1:10:16] with earth
[1:10:19] you have heavens
[1:10:21] but you always got one earth it's not
[1:10:23] going to be earth's
[1:10:24] for there's the new heavens and the new
[1:10:26] earth which i will make
[1:10:28] and shall remain before me saith the
[1:10:31] lord so shall your seed and your name
[1:10:34] remain
[1:10:35] and it shall come to pass that from one
[1:10:37] new moon to another
[1:10:40] you've got to count time
[1:10:42] you've got to count time amen amen
[1:10:44] you've got to count time in the
[1:10:46] millennium
[1:10:47] from one new moon to another and from
[1:10:49] one sabbath to another that's a day
[1:10:55] shall all flesh come to worship before
[1:10:57] me saith the lord
[1:10:59] somewhere in the old testament and i'll
[1:11:01] try to find it
[1:11:02] that you're they're still going to
[1:11:04] because what is it it's jewish
[1:11:06] they're going to have feast days
[1:11:10] the three great feast days i can't
[1:11:11] remember one's pentecost and the other
[1:11:12] one's first fruits and the other and
[1:11:14] something else everybody would always
[1:11:15] come to the temple every year three
[1:11:16] times a year or every year they come to
[1:11:18] those three feasts
[1:11:20] and it's gonna continue on why because
[1:11:21] this is a jewish domain that we're
[1:11:23] talking about not a not a gentile domain
[1:11:26] because it's only going to be the bride
[1:11:27] and 144 000 and whoever else comes up in
[1:11:30] all this that we're talking about
[1:11:32] and they shall go forth and look upon
[1:11:34] look
[1:11:35] and they shall go forth and look upon
[1:11:36] the carcasses of the men that have
[1:11:38] transgressed against me
[1:11:41] you might see some dead people i'm just
[1:11:44] reading bible i just want you to see
[1:11:45] that
[1:11:46] and they shall go forth and look upon
[1:11:48] the carcasses of the men that have
[1:11:49] transgressed against me for their worm
[1:11:51] shall not die neither shall their fire
[1:11:53] be quenched and they shall be abhorring
[1:11:56] to all
[1:11:57] flesh let's go to jeremiah 33
[1:12:04] to me this covers every bit of it
[1:12:08] thus saith the lord again there shall be
[1:12:09] heard in this place
[1:12:11] now what is jeremiah let's go back to
[1:12:13] what is jeremiah jeremiah is that's the
[1:12:16] time of captivity that's the time that
[1:12:17] they're going to be dispersed
[1:12:19] during the time of jeremiah god says
[1:12:22] you're going to leave this place i'm
[1:12:23] going to make you leave because i'm
[1:12:24] going to make this place desolate
[1:12:26] because you can't
[1:12:27] live by my order i'm going to get rid of
[1:12:30] you not get rid of you wipe you off but
[1:12:32] i'm going to send you and disperse you
[1:12:33] into other nations
[1:12:36] thus saith the lord again there shall be
[1:12:37] heard in this place
[1:12:39] which you say shall be desolate without
[1:12:41] man and without beast even in the cities
[1:12:43] of judea and in the streets of jerusalem
[1:12:46] they are that are desolate without a man
[1:12:48] without inhabitant and without beast
[1:12:50] the voice of joy and the voice of
[1:12:52] gladness the voice of the bridegroom and
[1:12:54] the voice of the bride the voice of them
[1:12:56] that shall say praise the lord of hosts
[1:12:57] for the lord is good for his mercy
[1:12:59] endure forever and of them that shall
[1:13:01] bring the sacrifice of praise look into
[1:13:04] the house of the lord
[1:13:07] for i will re i will cause to return the
[1:13:09] captivity of the land
[1:13:12] as it was at first
[1:13:15] thus saith the lord of hosts again in
[1:13:17] this place which was desolate without
[1:13:19] man and without beast and all the cities
[1:13:21] therein shall be inhabitation of
[1:13:23] shepherds
[1:13:25] causing their flock
[1:13:26] to lie down
[1:13:28] in the cities of the mountains in the
[1:13:29] cities of the veil and the cities of the
[1:13:31] south and the land of benjamin the place
[1:13:34] about jerusalem and in the cities of
[1:13:35] judea shall the flocks pass again under
[1:13:38] the hands of him that telleth them
[1:13:40] saith the lord
[1:13:41] behold the days come saith the lord that
[1:13:43] i will perform that good thing which i
[1:13:44] have promised until the house of israel
[1:13:47] not to us
[1:13:48] and the house of judah
[1:13:50] in those days and at that time
[1:13:53] will i cause the branch of righteousness
[1:13:55] to grow up unto david
[1:13:58] and look and he shall execute judgment
[1:14:00] and righteousness in that land
[1:14:03] so that whoever's going to rule and
[1:14:05] reign is going to rule and reign and
[1:14:06] execute judgment and righteousness
[1:14:10] so who is it
[1:14:12] king david which is not david himself it
[1:14:14] will be the lord jesus christ the son of
[1:14:16] david in those days shall judah be saved
[1:14:20] and jerusalem shall dwell safely and
[1:14:23] this is the name wherewith she shall be
[1:14:25] called the lord our righteousness for
[1:14:27] thus saith the lord
[1:14:29] david shall never want a man to sit upon
[1:14:31] the throne
[1:14:32] of the house of israel
[1:14:34] god promised david he was going to sit
[1:14:36] on the throne
[1:14:37] and rule the 12 tribes of israel just
[1:14:40] like he did when he was here alive all
[1:14:42] right let's go to the next one
[1:14:46] so now we'll go to revelations 20. and i
[1:14:48] saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:14:50] having the keys to the bottomless pit
[1:14:52] we'll stop right here
[1:14:54] having the keys of the bottom of this
[1:14:55] pit and a great chain in his hand and he
[1:14:57] laid hold on the dragon that old serpent
[1:14:59] which was the devil in satan and bound
[1:15:02] him a thousand years
[1:15:04] so in other words sometime before the
[1:15:06] millennium
[1:15:07] satan is going to be put in a place
[1:15:08] where he can't get a hold of me and you
[1:15:10] or anybody else
[1:15:12] amen and cast him into the bottomless
[1:15:15] pit and shut him up and put a seal on
[1:15:17] him that he should deceive the nations
[1:15:20] no more so look there's going to be
[1:15:21] nations
[1:15:23] we're going to live a thousand years
[1:15:25] so there's going to be nations brought
[1:15:27] up they're going to be vineyards that
[1:15:28] are planted houses that are going to be
[1:15:30] built
[1:15:32] till the thousand years should be
[1:15:33] finished after that he must be loosed a
[1:15:36] little season and i saw thrones and they
[1:15:39] that sat on them
[1:15:40] and judgment was given unto them who is
[1:15:42] that me and you and i saw the souls of
[1:15:44] them that were beheaded for the witness
[1:15:46] of jesus and for the word of god which
[1:15:48] had not worshipped the beast neither his
[1:15:50] image neither had received his mark on
[1:15:51] the forehead or in their hands
[1:15:54] and they lived and reigned with christ
[1:15:55] one thousand years that's the bride
[1:15:58] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[1:16:01] until the thousand years were finished
[1:16:03] this is the first resurrection the one
[1:16:05] we were talking about the one the bride
[1:16:06] comes up in the first resurrection
[1:16:10] because look it says blessed and holy is
[1:16:12] he that hath part in the first
[1:16:14] resurrection on such the second death
[1:16:16] hath no power
[1:16:18] but they shall be priests of god in
[1:16:20] christ and shall reign with him
[1:16:22] 1 000
[1:16:24] years so where's satan going to be
[1:16:28] during this time
[1:16:30] he's going to be
[1:16:32] bound by circumstance
[1:16:36] that he can't work because the bride is
[1:16:38] going to be on earth the 144 000 is
[1:16:40] going to be on earth and if there's
[1:16:42] going to be a heathen if there's going
[1:16:44] to be a fifth sealed jew whatever is
[1:16:45] going to come back into this dimension
[1:16:47] satan can't work in them for a thousand
[1:16:49] years
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] and then after that thousand years he's
[1:16:53] going to have to be loosed and we'll
[1:16:54] talk about that let us read let's read
[1:16:56] this one more luke 1 31 and then we'll
[1:16:59] close
[1:17:00] musicians get ready to come we've just
[1:17:02] been going an hour
[1:17:03] and y'all slept for 30 minutes so
[1:17:07] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:17:09] womb and bring forth the son and shall
[1:17:11] call his name jesus
[1:17:12] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:17:14] the son of the highest and the lord god
[1:17:16] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:17:17] father david and he shall reign over the
[1:17:20] house of jacob forever and of his
[1:17:22] kingdom there shall be
[1:17:24] no end
[1:17:26] he promised david
[1:17:29] let's read one more let's read jeremiah
[1:17:31] 23 and then we'll stop
[1:17:34] i want to try to stay in the bible so
[1:17:35] you take and listen to what the bible
[1:17:37] has to say about this
[1:17:39] behold the days come saith the lord that
[1:17:41] i will raise them to david a righteous
[1:17:43] branch now i read this and i'll read it
[1:17:44] again
[1:17:45] and a king shall reign and prosper look
[1:17:48] and shall reign and prosper
[1:17:51] and shall execute judgment and justice
[1:17:53] in the earth
[1:17:56] i mean literally what's going to happen
[1:17:57] is is is we're going to be in this city
[1:18:02] with
[1:18:03] lord jesus christ
[1:18:06] the bride doing whatever we want to do
[1:18:08] but there's there's there's
[1:18:10] nations out there the 144 000
[1:18:13] the jews
[1:18:15] and they're still doing that now they
[1:18:16] won't be doing any sacrifices you
[1:18:18] understand that but they're still going
[1:18:19] to be doing the things that they did
[1:18:21] because listen jew knows what to do with
[1:18:23] all these feast days and all the
[1:18:24] different things what to bring and what
[1:18:26] not to bring all right
[1:18:28] and then what they're going to come and
[1:18:30] they and god's going to execute judgment
[1:18:34] is there going to be a
[1:18:36] a squabble i mean you know there's not
[1:18:38] going to be traffic court there i don't
[1:18:39] think you know or anything like that
[1:18:41] definitely not going to be a divorce
[1:18:42] court
[1:18:44] so but there will be certain things
[1:18:45] because he can't judge and and and be a
[1:18:48] just judge
[1:18:51] and not have something to judge
[1:18:52] right like it's like brother brown said
[1:18:55] he said we shall rule and reign on the
[1:18:57] earth well now to rule and rain you've
[1:18:59] got to have something to rule and reign
[1:19:00] over
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:03] so there's got to be subjects there to
[1:19:04] rule and reign over
[1:19:06] in his day judah shall be saved and
[1:19:08] israel shall dwell safely this is the
[1:19:10] name his name whereby he shall be called
[1:19:12] the lord our righteousness
[1:19:14] therefore
[1:19:16] come the days come say the lord that
[1:19:18] they shall no more say the lord liveth
[1:19:19] which brought us the children of israel
[1:19:21] the land of egypt but the lord liveth
[1:19:23] was brought up and which led the seed of
[1:19:25] the house of israel
[1:19:26] out of the north country look and from
[1:19:28] all countries
[1:19:31] whether i driven them now remember what
[1:19:33] did god do in jeremiah he dispersed the
[1:19:35] jews
[1:19:37] they tried to get back in certain times
[1:19:38] and he kept dispersing them putting them
[1:19:40] in russia putting them in germany
[1:19:42] putting them in the united states
[1:19:43] putting them in every country in the
[1:19:45] world
[1:19:47] but he promised he would drive them back
[1:19:49] to israel
[1:19:51] i'm going to take you from all these
[1:19:53] countries which i've driven you and they
[1:19:55] shall dwell in their own
[1:19:58] land
[1:20:00] remember what the prophet says that god
[1:20:01] will not dwell will not deal with a jew
[1:20:05] except he's in this homeland
[1:20:08] so they got to get back to the homeland
[1:20:10] now listen
[1:20:11] we saw that in 1946
[1:20:14] and the different ones different times
[1:20:16] where brother brown said they started
[1:20:17] coming back
[1:20:19] but let me tell you something
[1:20:23] they came back to get preached to
[1:20:27] they came back that's the whole thing
[1:20:29] they didn't they think they came back to
[1:20:31] see the messiah
[1:20:32] well they're going to see him all right
[1:20:34] but they're going to see him through two
[1:20:35] witnesses they're not going to see what
[1:20:37] they think they're going to see
[1:20:39] so they're going to see god through two
[1:20:41] witnesses
[1:20:42] and then you know the 144 thousand are
[1:20:44] going to know for surety god is finally
[1:20:48] going to listen to us because we're in
[1:20:50] our homeland we're trying to do
[1:20:51] everything we do god sent us to prophets
[1:20:55] he's given us everything we need
[1:20:57] so they're going to get saved same thing
[1:21:00] with me and you folks let's stand our
[1:21:02] feet musicians come
[1:21:04] that's the same way with me and you and
[1:21:06] our new birth and all the different
[1:21:07] things that we're looking at
[1:21:09] god has given us these provisions like i
[1:21:11] said before he's already given us our
[1:21:13] healer it's already inside of me and you
[1:21:17] our savior is already inside of me and
[1:21:19] you he saved us
[1:21:21] our keeper the one that's going to take
[1:21:23] us up the statute for me man he's
[1:21:25] already in us
[1:21:28] he's not far folks listen if you're
[1:21:30] getting
[1:21:31] what the bible tell
[1:21:34] what the bible tell us
[1:21:37] the bible says if you'll look toward in
[1:21:39] the old testament said if you'll
[1:21:41] look toward the tabernacle
[1:21:45] just look toward it
[1:21:46] and pray
[1:21:48] he said i'll hear you
[1:21:50] i mean look toward the tabernacle pray
[1:21:51] i'll hear you
[1:21:53] well now me and you don't have to look
[1:21:55] at a certain tabernacle
[1:21:58] right here
[1:22:00] right here
[1:22:02] look toward a certain tabernacle
[1:22:04] me and you we're walking tabernacles
[1:22:07] and man we don't have to look at one we
[1:22:10] know we don't have to focus our eyes on
[1:22:11] one place but the jews do that's why
[1:22:13] they have to have a homeland they have
[1:22:15] to have the city being built according
[1:22:17] to daniel 9 27. they have to be back in
[1:22:20] their homeland they have to have the
[1:22:22] temple belt they have to have
[1:22:24] a gathering of the 144 thousand to get
[1:22:27] that millennium started and then live a
[1:22:29] thousand years
[1:22:30] to prove that the sin curse is over
[1:22:33] and then we'll get to the rest
