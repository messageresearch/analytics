TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you saints we're gonna try something a little different this morning try to see if i can can run the slideshow so hopefully all right let's let's just pray before we get into this lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and we just pray lord as we study these things out lord that you'll just open these things to us lord bless brother wade as he studies lord and be with us today we ask in your name so let's let's kind of summarize the uh uh you know when you're when you're studying out scriptures you can uh you you almost like you're looking for patterns you're looking for these little nuggets so let's just kind of backtrack a little bit and and just kind of look at um the pattern that paul's laying out for us as we went through these first three chapters and getting on into chapter four so paul in hebrews chapter one he laid out you know that that who who christ is who this man was that began to speak and he said who bringing the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and we know god has god has that he has a throne in heaven he sat down on the throne of christ when christ was on the earth and then on the day of pentecost peter preached those words that the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i make all my enemies that footstool as as christ sat down the holy ghost sat down in the heart of the believer so now look look at the pattern that paul is laying out for us in hebrews chapter 3 verse 8 harden not your hearts is in the provocation now they're on a journey don't harden your now we're on a journey don't don't harden your heart like they did as they were on that journey harden out your hearts as in the provocation of the day of temptation in the wilderness and in hebrews chapter four verse one hebrews chapter come on in be welcome we're just doing a little sunday school no problem at all we've got plenty of plenty of room plenty of spots to sit so hebrews chapter 4 verse 1. begins to talk about the rest let us therefore fear lest a promise being left left of left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so what's look at this look at this uh the pattern that paul is laying out for us you got a starting point you've got a journey on a journey let's not get hung up in our journey don't provoke god like they did in the wilderness which prevented them from entering into the rest so if you kind of set that pattern in your mind what we're talking about is is we're all you know that's why you know you begin to meditate on how the most most the majority of your christian life is spent on this journey and you're you're going you're trying to get somewhere what and begin to think about that one as we get to hebrews chapter four talking about rest what what really is rest now we know rest is the baptismal ghost and rest is when you seize from your own works and it's christ doing the work in you but maybe maybe begin to think about think about where did your rest come from so what provocation the provocation is kind of the main thought that we're on right now is provocation is when you you do something that makes somebody annoyed or angry so in this case you know i i keep going back to you know if you just believe somebody's word if you if somebody tells you they're going to do something for you are going to makes a promise to you and then you say i i just don't believe that my what a insult that is and think about how compounded that is for god to make promises to us the promise of the baptism in the holy ghost to promise that the seals will be open to us the promise that uh that he will reveal to us what our purpose is in this life that promised that he'll place us all those things and for us to draw back and say well you know i don't believe that god is able to deliver all of those goliaths into our hand i don't i don't believe i'd rather go back to where i started from now so we left off in our last lesson we left off at the 10th provocation which if at this place in the story in the bible the bible that uh moses and god actually he says that there's been 10 provocations that lays out 10 and that at this point in the story there were 10 so the 10th provocation is here they are at kedesh barnea now if you want to know what kiddish barnea looks like this is a picture of that spot and so so picture the children of israel coming up from and of course you know it's of course debatable exactly how they came up from egypt and where they crossed over the red sea and and those kind of things but we know that kiddish barnea was right there at the southern part of israel on this map right here and you think about a little narrow strip of land right there in a little valley and there they were at this at this junction place and they sent spies that traveled all across oh they start started from the southern tip and went all the way across all all up through the northern part of israel exploring everywhere and they came back and only two had a good report only two came back saying let's put it in today's today's vernacular the only two came back saying god is able to reveal these mysteries to us god is able to reveal the entire bible to us god is able to fulfill all of his promises to us the seals are open god is able to change our bodies god is able to to give us to unfold to us the full mystery of redemption god is able to reveal these things to us and the rest of them said well you know there's too many goliaths in the lands there's bullying preachers there's preachers that look like they're uh there's there's a lot of strange things that i don't know where we're gonna be able to to to overcome there's problems in our lives and you know you hear people in the message say well i don't know how we'll ever be perfect not realizing that this gospel is get sent to to change us into his likeness i don't know how we'll ever do it i don't know how we'll ever overcome and so that's the that's the junction time that they came to in this little spot in the middle of the desert so the tenth the tenth place now now brother brown was in the message abs and absolutely he said now you pentecostal people believe when the gifts began to restore to the church of the baptism of the holy ghost and speaking with tongues and you stayed right with that you believe that now that's all right but why do you stop there why do you stop there when israel was on the journey to the promised land and when they stopped in the wilderness they stayed there for 40 years and just a day's journey out of every promise the whole complete promised land so why do they not go into the promised land because they disbelieve god's word and that's the same that's the same question as opposed to us that we believe god's word do we believe that god is able to open up all these mysteries to us to believe do we believe what brother brown said do we stumble at the things that he spoke now see that's that's that that that that wilderness journey you're fighting it out because when you come to rest you're not fighting anymore you're resting there's you you look at that pattern that's being played out you start on your journey and you're wrestling with it why why do the preachers get seem to get so critical of that doctrine over there why do they why do they when they put a chart up on the screen and they point out problems with the chart why why do all these things because you're battling it out you're battling it out in your mind and then when you come to when you come to rest you're at a different place now here they came to they came to this junction time and the way they provoked god was they said they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jafana which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes they rent their clothes because the people began to they you think about the confession they were they so doubted the message that had been given to them that they failed to believe that they were able to go over into the promise now again what's the promised land the promised land is your rest the promised land is the opening of the word the promised land it is the baptism of the holy ghost the promised land is uh is is everything now you think about what a paradox the rest is too that when they get over there into that land of rest they're still going to be fighting what a strange thing that is that you'll be resting but there's still goliaths and candy nights and and moabites and things that drive out of the land what a strange thing we'll talk about that more maybe and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which floweth with milk and honey there there's a good confession that joshua and caleb had god is able to open up these mysteries to us and when you when you start when you when you sit in church and you kind of get all bogged down and you start thinking well i'll never understand this no don't don't you keep keep pressing on sometimes you got to get desperate get to a place where i i got to get it if my life depends on it only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear you the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation baits stoned them with stones and that was the third time moses interceded for the people because god just wanted he said i'm just gonna wipe wipe this lake clean i'm just gonna start fresh with you moses and moses laid before god and said don't don't do that and and you watch how many times moses does this he lays because he's playing the part of christ and he intercedes for the peace he's standing standing in the gap stand between god's wrath and so now now again i know i know last time i mentioned the the labor of ministers and the labor of pastors and i just want to highlight this again because now think about think about this now we read last time 75 percent of pastors report being extremely stressed or highly stressed 90 work between 55 to 75 hours per week many report a serious conflict with a parishioner at least once a month why why is it now i'm not saying this just to be like that sounds like a very downy statistic to quote that's depressing brother bob but the reason for this is because think about this you're in that stage you're under that ox anointing you're laboring and you're moving on you're moving on to your rest and so that's why that's why troubles come is because you're back you're battling and you're wrestling and the people are wrestling the people are wrestling with the things that are said the minister is going through we're we're we're in that that ox stage of moving on toward that rest and so it's it's it's it is it's part of the journey it's part of the journey for there to be battles as part of the journey for there to be battles that ministers meetings where where people have differences opinions and and people grapple and struggle and things as part of the battle for when preachers preach that people in the congregation that wonder what's being said and they and it start just like at bible study when you when you say things that it stirs up you you want to go home and let me study that out more because you're you're like an ox pulling that cart you're laboring and you're struggling and you're trying to get to where you're going and and and brother brown explained this in hebrews chapter four when he was preaching the sermon hebrews chapter four he said they got weary every time they get to a place where a showdown come then what would they do they would fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me why do these bad problems come because you're you're in a journey it's part of the journey part of the journey it's not going to be a flower bed of roses to it where all the all the understanding just dumped out you on you all at once and you just you just understand because god is god's given you a little bit more as you as he as your character is molding and he begins to realize that that you're gonna what you're gonna do with it and and and and it's it's it's it's part of the journey now the the eleventh provocation core the son of ishar the son of kohath the son of levi and daythan and ambayaram the sons of eliah and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took me in and there rose up before moses was certain of the children of israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men are renowned and they gathered themselves together against moses and aaron and said unto them you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord now brother brown compare this that you know ministers and things that they get lifted up within themselves and they begin to say well we don't have to believe the messenger for our day now now notice that you can get so tied up with what hollywood says hollywood the ten commandments movie will make the ground opening up that they'll put that scene when moses went up to get the ten commandments off of the mountain but but really that happened much later see how you you you you need to go back to the bible and study things out to really get the complete picture you can't can't rely on just watching a little movie or uh all there's so many little different television shows and things that get things so blatantly wrong and so hollywood is not our bible the bible the bible is our bible and so in numbers chapter 16 verse 32 it says in the earth open her mouth and swallow them up in all their houses and all the men that i pertained in decorah and all their goods now now brother ram said and why i'm against organized religion why did he tell this story and why i'm against organized religion he said he told them to take sensors that moses did and put holy fire in it and put the incense over the top of it and to wave this holy incense which is the command of god and they come up to make a group of men to control the church where god had commanded one man to do so one man what does that mean that means that everything we preach and everything we stand for comes from comes from the gospel that was preached by that one man in this age just like in every other age in paul's days there was one man that stood for the god the word that for that age and everybody had to everybody's message all the ministers in that age their message had to dovetail with that so we're preaching we're preaching not our own ideas and he wasn't even preaching his own idea but he was preaching a message straight from the throne of god and so we all dovetail with that which dovetails with the bible every we know that everything that brother and preached dovetails with what paul preached and so he said they failed to see that moses was the messenger of that hour see he had thus saith the lord there was nobody on earth like him he had the message and the people failed to see it and moses was exactly what thus saith the lord he said now we find the same thing today good men great men precious men trying to preach the word of god in their hand through some man-made tradition cutting out here and cutting down here and making it this and come join the church and change your membership and spiritually die with that word in their hand so they went so they went uh god moses told them go take the incense take that incense in their hand and they went and they went to minister before the before the tabernacle and god said separate yourselves from those people now now watch out watch this pattern that god told god told moses just i'm going to wipe again he said i'm going to wipe the slate clean and start over with you and moses laid before the lord and prayed and god that's when god told him to go uh uh send aaron before before the people to um uh i'm getting my he laid before the lord and and god told him well to separate all the people and then that they caused the ground to open up now now watch watch after this happen as truly a supernatural event happened where the ground opened up and swallowed all those people that rebelled against moses and then the people what are the people that say they said all the congregation of the children of israel murmuring its moses and aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord now see in this in this day you could say the same thing after we have seen after we have seen the pillar of fire and supernatural things done and still people turn aside turn around and fail to realize that god has done something supernatural in this day now we're almost we're almost to the to the to the 14th so when they finally they began to run out of water and they began to complain and and the people choked with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord and why have you brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and that's when moses temper got the best of him he got so upset that he smoked the rock now now you look at all these types and things where moses he broke the tab the tables of stone uh he broke them and then they had to be remade by god and he lost his temper here and he and he struck the rock again but and all these things actually types were being played out why did moses strike strike the tables of stone and they had to be remade because the word would be in its fullness at the beginning of the ephesian church age and then in its fullness in the last and so the word would would come back in its full power and and why did he strike why did he strike the rock because it actually had to be fulfilled then in the last age that the the the true gospel would be strict it would be smitten forth from the denominational ideas and they would reject it and that's why brother brown preached the message an indictment he said i indict you why for crucifying afresh the son of god for crucifying the word made flesh again god coming back in his people and being manifested visibly with the pillar of fire and the word being preached so but but yet moses his temper got the best of him and he struck that rock and and god said you can't go into the promised land now you think think now moses he didn't lose his eternal life but he lost going into that into the end of that journey he lost just just like how you and i it would get a deep water a little bit but if we fail to get these virtues how are we going to come to a place of adoption if you don't have temperance if you don't have patience if you don't if you don't struggle it out and and work out what's true and what's correct work out your salvation with fear and trembling i heard somebody say the other day well now that we've all been adopted now that's a very weighty thing to say now that we've all been adopted that's that's that's a weighty thing to say be careful with that kind of statement because you got to have all these virtues in you to be to come to a place where god recognizes that his character is is in you and that you're doing you're you're believing his word and then to vindicate that by opening the seals to you and revealing himself to you and filling you with the true baptism of the holy ghost let's uh we're all on an individual journey we're not we're not we're not all coming to the end of the road i i've spoke to a minister years ago where you know some some people get this idea that as soon as you're born again in this age whatever age you're born again then you're at that place in the pyramid now we all start as a baby we all start as a little baby and we all grow and so we all have our own individual growth journey that we're on and just because we're all in this church just because we're all sitting here this morning does not mean that just because just because the ministers are preaching adoption doesn't mean we're all adopted doesn't mean does it just because uh just because uh martin luther was preaching justification didn't mean everybody that was sitting there listening to him understood what he was saying and the very last loathing the light bread and they journeyed from mount over by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have you brought us out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loathes this light breath what what did they what were they loathing they were loathing let's put it in today's understanding they were loathing the deep teaching of the word they were loathing the mysteries being revealed they were loathing preaching about the promised land and what is the promised land the promised land is the message that brother branham was sent to bring in this day the promised land the the true the unfolding of the word and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died which is why paul says harden not to your heart says in the provocation of the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden out your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whoms where he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief now what happened to those that disbelieve now brother branham said and many sermons why it had to be shepherds he said there was only two of them that ever went through that was saved out of a two and a half million two out of two and a half million you see that you say that what happened to them they're eternally gone why because they did not believe the promise of god all of them brother branham jesus said so they said our fathers a manna in the wilderness and they drank from the rock and he jesus said and they are everyone dead eternally separated see everyone now let's let let's sit on that for a little bit now because that's a little bit deep brother brown said then souls are prison now and j saint john john 6 49 is where they eat manna and jesus said and they're everyone dead and he said well well my sister i seen this woman dance in the spirit i've seen them do that i've seen her speak in tongues jesus said many will come to me in that day and say i've done all these things i went to church i paid my tithes i was there in the in the building when they were preaching deep things they man in the wilderness jesus said and they're everyone eternally separated they're dead as eternally gone they perished right there in the wilderness and again as souls in prison now he said when the truth is presented to a person for the last time and they refuse to receive it according to the book of hebrews they are finished no repentance no redemption there is nothing left for them they are eternally separated the bible said so now you think about god gave them chance after chance 14 14 times to test and see if they were going to believe the bible said so looking for the fearful fire and any nation which shall devour the adversary and when truth of the gospel has been proven thoroughly vindicated and then turn around and walk away from it they're finished that's all it's awful but i have to tell it now let's to really understand this i i think we have to you know brother brown when he was preaching the fifth seal he kind of he gave us a glimpse of this the lie that the devil told was thou shalt not surely die now now look at them as they went through that journey they were the place where obviously they believed the devil's lie they believed that well we're not going to die it's okay for us to just to reject the leadership of the holy spirit to reject all the supernatural things that we've seen and so that's what jesus said in john chapter 6 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead why because if you disbelieve god's word you will die in genesis but of the tree of the knowledge of the good and evil thou shalt not death not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is there thou shalt surely die and then the level told that the lie which brotherhood said the lie the lie is you will not surely die if you disbelieve god's word you'll not surely die now now what we want to examine this morning is how how that definition changes depending on where what does that mean does that mean look if you're born again and you fail you you begin to stumble at things and and you don't have all the gaps closed in the definition change a little bit if you die if you disbelieve a little thing you're you're you don't lose your eternal life if you're born again but it still holds true just like eve think about now adam and eve in the garden they just believed that god's word did they lose their eternal life but yet god's word is true and the day they disbelieved they died they died their begot their body began to start taking that downward turn and i'm i'm running out of time here well we got two minutes the musicians can go ahead and come forward brother around said in the message oneness he said now when adam and eve listen to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship with oneness with god was broken at the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listen to the live devil the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it is and the next time we'll talk about rest because that's where we're leading to that's where paul was leading to was rest god bless you [Applause] [Music] you
