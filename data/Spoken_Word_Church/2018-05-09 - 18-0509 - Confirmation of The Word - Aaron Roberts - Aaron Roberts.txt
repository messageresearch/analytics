132 But I like a genuine thoroughbred. Oh, he’s gentle. You can talk to him. He knows who his papa was, who his mama was, who his grandpa and grandma was. He has got pedigreed papers to show where he come from.
133 And I like a pedigreed Christian, that can go all the way back to the Word of God, to the day of Pentecost, and identify themselves there with the saints, where the Power of the Holy Ghost came upon them. That’s a pedigreed Christian. He knows where he come from. He’s not identified with Methodist, Baptist, or nothing else. He’s identified in God’s Word. He knows exactly where he is standing at. The royal Blood of his Father flows through him; the Blood of Jesus Christ. He knows what It does! He believes every Word. God works through him and confirms it with the signs that He promised to follow. He hasn’t got no spiritual amnesia. He’s a genuine thoroughbred. I like that.
Take God at His Word
What He said is true 
What He says He will do

 54-0401 - God's Preparation
2 How many ever dreamed a dream in here, let’s see your hand, just ever dreamed a dream? Well, I suppose there’s at least two-thirds of the people with their hands up; well that would be just about right. There’s probably one-fourth of the people, anyhow, of the world, that never dreams a dream. Now, the reason they don’t dream a dream is because they are real sound sleepers. And we’re told by science that that’s your subconscious, it’s when you… Say, here’s one conscious here; then when that becomes inactive, why, you go into this conscious. And when you’re here, you dream of things that you did while you were awake. And when you’re awake, you remember things that you dreamed about when you were asleep. Now, that’s the dual conscious. That’s the main part.

bless the bride around the world tonight Lord Jesus and Lord just give us hearts to receive and ears to hear Lord Jesus or that we can believe what what is what you've said is true Lord is forever settled in heaven and when we just commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen a little bit lengthy reading here Acts chapter 4 beginning in verse 1 it says and they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the safeties came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them and hold until the next day that was even howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of men was about five thousand and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and and us the high priest in caphis and john and alexander and many as were of the kindred of the high priests were gathered together at jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or ber what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy go said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to this infinite men but what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and beholding the men which was healed standing with them they could not say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they convert among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no further among the people let us straightly threatening the threaten them that they that they speak henceforth to no man in his name in this name amen god bless you tonight you may be seated you know we uh probably very familiar with this scripture but you know when you Peter and John you know when they were on their way to the temple that day to pray you know there was a man standing there who had a real need you know this this lame man had been lame all of his life here he was laying at the temple and you know he had his eyes on one thing and that was alms and he was just wanting something from the people but you know Peter came that day and you know Peter and John as they came that day Peter had something better than what it would then what you know what he was looking for you know he came and he said silver and gold have I none you know he didn't he didn't have what what this man was expecting but you know he said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I be in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and you know and then you know he just stood there I guess he was kind of startled at Peter's response to him because you know he's expecting something put in his little tin cup they're waiting on you know just the same old thing trying to get a little something but you know when when Peter spoke to him and said you know this is what I have you to Peter grabbed ahold of him by the hand because even if the man didn't have faith to believe that Peter had faith to believe he was going to be healed you know Peter grabbed ahold of him and pulled him up and the man got faith because I believe he understood and believed what Peter had to say that he believed in when he got hold then you know he stood on his feet but you know you know the the Pharisees and the scribes is in our scripture reading you know they were all upset that something had taken place you know and here it was you know this man and what was so striking about this scripture that we were reading is you know he stood in the midst of them and said they couldn't say anything about it because they knew this man had laid in the gate of beautiful and had laid there and they had walked right past him and everybody had seen him standing there begging alms of him and as he were staying you know sitting there begging alms and yet this man was standing on there feet standing in their midst you know Peter says you if you're going to examine us if you're going to question us about what we've done they will tell you you know because Jesus because if you're ascribing a Pharisee if you're if you followed anything then you would have known that Jesus walked on the face of the earth you would have known Jesus's ministry and why because Jesus done the same thing Jesus went about doing good casting out Devils and healing the sick he came to do exactly what the father has showed him to do fulfilling the scripture fulfilling the Old Testament the prophecies that were laid out there he was he came because that's what he came to fulfill make it make known to the people the Old Testament prophecies and he came in here he come and then what What did he say because the word that I want to look at tonight it's confirmation what was what was given what was that what was the confirmation because jesus said you know when he told the disciples he said he said the things that I do he said you shall do also he said in greater works the knees the works that I do the things that you see done he said you're going to do the same thing and you know even went before they had received the Holy Ghost he sent them out and was able to do the miracles but it wasn't just the miracles and the things he was preaching the word to him he wanted him to have their faith on the word he wanted him to see the word and that's exactly what he was telling the scribes and the Pharisees you've studied the word you studied the word you know all about it but the problem is is you don't see the fulfillment of it you don't see that it's being confirmed in front of you all the way through the scripture you know there's two people not only this the light man but you know Lazarus we read about the story of Lazarus and you know there he was and you know the scripture tells us that when when Lazarus was with Jesus and in the book of John he tells us that when Lazarus was there he was eating with Jesus and he said many people came to see not just see Jesus but they come to see Lazarus they come to see Lazarus sitting in their midst and you know he said he said the scribes and the Pharisees even took it upon themselves to think that they might kill Lazarus why because he was such a witness here we hear you us and you know he's sitting there you know no doubt all of these people who knew Lazarus because of a bit of his job being a scribe early most people would have known Lazarus they would have known his sisters they would have known all of this no doubt many of them had seen Lazarus laid in a tomb lady laying sick in the house and everybody's waiting on Jesus they're waiting on Jesus to come but Jesus don't come well maybe Jesus will come soon and they're waiting on Jesus to come but Jesus don't come he's got other he's got other itineraries to meet he's going other places why but he but he had a plan why because he was doing exactly what the father had showed him to do he said the son can do nothing in himself except what the father said what he sees the father do he said the sunders black was so when he's seen those things he went about he went around he didn't go and his heartbroken sisters there as they watch his what's their brother died and they bury him in a tomb and no doubt all these other people are watching you know what this is a great family these are people that loved Jesus he's well beloved here you know they can all talk about Jesus everything and you know what he could have come and healed him we've seen that we've seen him heal other people but he lets Lazarus died and they go who watched him what's his sister's cry over his body as they put him in a tomb it where's the loving Lord Jesus where's the tender Lord Jesus where is he now but he's letting water set in a tomb and then this one day this past and we hadn't seen Jesus in two days passes and we still don't see Jesus in three days pass and we still don't see Jesus where's gee so sad we think hope my heart's going to tear out why why is this going on where's Jesus than why Jesus not coming but Jesus came right on time Jesus had a plan there was a word to be fulfilled even when he come and easy go and said well you know if you could you know if he was just here you could have healed him but there was a greater miracle gonna take place there was a greater miracle going to take place and when they walked up there you know she was crying you know told Matt well Lord you know you know you can raise him he said I am the resurrection and the life I'm in the midst right now to raise him not some other time say it's an it's now's the time it's going to take place and then you know when he comes and goes to the tomb you know all the Pharisees in the Sadducees all the people that have seen Lazarus knew Lazarus grew up with him and sent him lay in that tomb and everybody had the same idea he's dead and his body's rotting and now Jesus shows up what's he going to do now we can do exactly what he said he was going to do he is the resurrection whatever the word said was going to take place and then went when they said roll the stone out of the way and he called Lazarus by name and he come forth and they said loosing here he was the man of the day had seen all this stuff take place that a man had died and had been rose from the dead raised from the dead and he was in their midst and yet they couldn't believe it why because it hurt their doctrine it hurt their prison you know their place position their prestige but you know here he was standing raised from the day and they wanted to get rid of him why because they couldn't see that God was in the midst well because they would they would have had to realize I'm wrong I've been wrong all this time I've had I've had my own ideas of my own thoughts and how men has taken the Word of God and they've created their own little doctrine and their own little schemes and all kinds of stuff that you know it wouldn't but when Jesus came on the scene and done the work of God and said prove me by the scripture where I didn't do what exactly what I was what the Bible says that I would do when they come in question him he took them right back to what you said you've studied what you've read what you know what they said well this isn't exactly this he brought him right back to the scripture said show me where I where I hadn't believed where I hadn't fulfilled the word and here he is standing standing in their midst confirmation of the word one because that was confirmation but he asked him said can you believe his up to them can you believe you say that you say that you're Abraham's descendants and that you're Moses disciples when what he did Moses say what did Abraham say what was their faith he said if you'd have known them you know me you didn't own my day you didn't own your day of visitation would you what they missed their day of visitation and there he was Lazarus standing in their midst fulfilling the word they had nothing they could say about it no we just got to get rid of the evidence we got to get rid of that evidence we don't want anybody hanging around Jesus when the lame man was raised and those Peter and John they were saying telling them how you can't tell anybody about what you got to go into synagogues and tell all the people don't don't say anything about this lame man it's late in the gate beautiful all these years that is dead and he's walking around now don't you go around telling what happened y'all take that lame man get him on the fastest ship out of town or on the fastest chariot out of town because we don't want nobody around talking about it don't talk about it but you know what the more the more that they tried to cover it up and tried to hide it and tried to whitewash it and everything like that you know the greater it became it's like well why are you trying to hide it why because there was something there that that they didn't like why because it rubbed them the wrong way it went against their doctrine in the same way it is today confirmation of the word why because the word is being confirmed God is making his word known today he's confirming his word today just like it was back then he's making itself known you know all through the scripture we see there's people that God is trying that you know in all these different situations God wanted people to confirm his word you know you look at all the different people that went through all these different situations that they had to go through in their lives you know what God was confirming the word to him you know Jairus you know when his daughter was sick you know you know he believed on Jesus but you know what he didn't want he didn't want anybody to know where he stood he didn't want anybody knowing what he believed but you know what God wanted him to show his colors show his true colors wanted him to know everybody to see who he was and when it's it when his daughter got sick you know when it came in there was no other help there was no other solution there was nothing else that's going to fix it you know he had to go to G but you know he got to a place when he got desperate you know it didn't matter what anybody thought or what was going on he wanted Jesus and because he knew what Jesus could do and you know it's the same way you know God puts us in situations sometimes they look helpless and hopeless but you know what God wills us to show our true colors God wills us to be in a situation you know that we can step out in faith and believe what what is there we have to we have to stand here and claim what's ours this is from the message spiritual amnesia brother Branham says he was talking about the Thoroughbred he said but I like a genuine thoroughbred so he's gentle you can talk between me knows who his papa was who his mama was who his grandpa grandma was he's got pedigree papers to show where he came from he said I like a pedigree a pedigreed Christian that can go all the way back to the Word of God to the day of Pentecost and identify themselves there with the Saints where the power of the Holy Ghost came upon them that's a pedigreed Christian he knows where he come from he's not identified with Memphis Baptist or int or nothing else or any kind of other stuff that goes around the message because you know they've just carried all that other stuff over into the end of the message they're still Methodists and Baptists and all of that they just go by different names he's identified in God's Word he knows exactly where he is standing at the royal blood of his father flows through him the blood of Jesus Christ he knows what it does he believes every word God works through him and confirms it with the signs that he fought he promised to follow he hasn't got no spiritual amnesia he's a genuine thoroughbred I like that so God wants us in a situation to show who we are because if we know who we are then we don't mind sharing it because you know the one thing about Peter and John you know they know who they they knew where they were standing and you know they marveled at their boldness they marveled at the boldness that they had and you and I we have to be the same way you know take God at His Word be bold you know somebody asked me the other day asked me about you know what does it mean to take God at His Word how would you translate that I told him I told him I said well the first thing off is whatever he said is true the Bible says that let every man be be a liar and God be true I said whatever he said in the past in the present in the future it's all it's all true it's all settled in heaven and don't matter what it is I said because the more science has tried to prove the Bible wrong the more they've proved it right I said it doesn't matter I said because you no matter what's taking place I said because we can put our confidence in what was said in in the Old Testament and what went on whether whether we could prove it or not it's still it's still the truth and it's just like it doesn't matter what if whatever it says in the Bible it don't matter what science tells me this is the truth and this is what I'm going to stand on one of the calls it's it's it's settled in me that this is the truth and I don't have to worry about what somebody says well this is wrong and that's wrong no I can tell you that it's the truth and every time this went through historically we've seen it take place but you know what it only it's taking place in my life that I've seen it real what it says in the scripture takes place and you know it doesn't matter what anybody else says I can prove it because I'm a witness I'm on my own witness so whatever he said it's true because the more people have tried to prove it wrong and tear it down and try to bring out all the mistakes the more they prove it right and so whatever he has said in the past it's true the problem is is man has got it mixed up not God God's not confused and on his word I said but man's kid gets confused on his own work whether God created in seven days seven thousand years if it took ten million years or whatever else you know what God created it and whether or whether everybody tries to believe that God created or it came from a Big Bang it came from you know however you want to look at it I believe God spoke it into existence and it came whether it took because I believe it started just as soon as God thought it and spoke it it came into existence but I already believed that it was in the existence in God's mind so it didn't matter when it came but it came into existence but you know what I don't believe that it was a whole bunch of just willy-nilly you know craziness you know just some haphazard thing that took place that some of the lightning struck a pool somewhere and all of a sudden life started and you know we all descended from monkeys and everything like that but you know they tell you something brothers and sisters you know what it almost be good sometimes that we did come from monkeys because we could revert them back to their ancestors because they act better the grown people do today we got human beings that don't even act like human beings but you know what it's all settled it doesn't matter what took place it's forever settled and it happened just exactly the way God said it took place you know what whatever took place it still happens today God spoke it and instead it came into being I believe that was a creative evolution that took place as God was speaking it come more and more in greater and greater and greater if I see reason that you and I are created in His image because it was God speaking it but it didn't it didn't just haphazardly God wasn't confused on anything well I would like like people get confused on God didn't ever get confused on nothing I ain't never been worried about nothing God ain't ever been scared about nothing because you know what there's nothing to does ever happen anytime anyplace anywhere that God didn't know about ahead of time then we get confused and we get scared and we get worried and always but you know worried ain't never produced one thing that's been been worth anything it's not produced one virtue in anything anybody worry don't do you any bit of good what because the only thing that God came from it came from God was faith and power and love and a sound mind that's what came from God and that's what he gave to you in the new birth but see the thing is is we still get confused why because we're still living an old past house and we still lean on the sole flesh we still like this old flesh get in the way but you know what God has given us the power to overcome this whatever he said is true and it's ever it's forever settled the problem is is it it's got to be settled in you you got to believe that you got to come to that place so whatever he said and whatever he said he's going to do he's going to do it all you got to do is come to the same place to believe it and claim it and it'll come to pass why because the scripture tells us that God had two immutable things that he could that he couldn't tell a lie and his word was true and he spoke it and when he had no knowing greater he swore by himself that he would fulfill his own word and brother Branham said that if then if you come on the scene and you have the same faith that anybody else had that you've ever done it before and you come to the same situation you come to the same condition and have same faith and God does not meet your need does not come and act the same way he's done in the past he said you can call him on the scene and call him a liar why because he called but you know what in the scripture he said he wanted some by the believing take me at my word take me at my word all the way through the scripture he was wanting to find somebody that believing and if you just believe him you know he'll come and do it you know what he has more desired to bless you then you want to be blessed yourself he said he wanted to give us the Holy Ghost more than we wanted to ourselves he wanted to heal us more than we want to be healed ourselves sometimes that's hard to believe but you know what he has a desire for us he has something he wants to give us he wants to bless us but we've got to believe that we've got to believe what the Bible says is true and you've got to put your claim on that you know there was a there was a brother preaching one time and he and he made it comment and I've got a well brother brems has more than one quote on it but you know brother brems said that some people in this world don't dream he said that sometimes people's subconscious and you know there's such deep sleepers or subconscious is separated and everything you know they don't ever dream and he had a had a woman in the church come up to him says well you know my saw and my psychology professor told us that everybody dreams you just don't remember it and he said well sister brother branham's said the Prophet said some people don't drink gee I wonder who I'm going to believe jail wonder who I'm supposed to believe the Prophet or you some psychology professor yeah it's ridiculous if somebody even think that you know people people like you know well it's we ran about it well what brother madam say what does the Bible say people get confused on stuff you know you get everybody you know they get all wrapped up in politics and working on one side working on the other and trying to figure this out and that out and rearranging the deck furniture on the Titanic you ain't going to change nothing you try to talk to people about getting saved and getting filled with the Holy Ghost and getting to a place that you know you have a relationship with God and know where you're going when you die and they look at you cross-eyed working with a working with a guy today works for a heating and air company and he come I was checking on one of our units we had some problems with and he said you know he just you know just the nominal Christian he said you know he said if people would just get excited about Jesus the way people get excited about ball games and TV shows and all this other stuff and you know they were talking about some some TV show that you know one of the characters is is leaving and everything like yeah and you know I mean this you know the ratings just blew up because you know everybody had to tune in to watch this one person on TV well it's fake [Laughter] [Applause] but you know what everybody's so in tune to this we got to figure this out it's ridiculous let me tell you something there's a plan of salvation you know what the god of our the created everything that you've ever seen that you cannot see that put everything in motion you know what he came down from the ramparts of glory and step down into human flesh and died on a cross so do you could receive eternal life that's the greatest love story ever told that's the greatest news story ever told but you try to tell somebody about it you know it's not just some just some thoughts some ideas some craziness that went on but it's a fact let me tell you something when you get into place where you don't know what to do and you don't know where to turn and all of a sudden there's an anchor that holds you in that time let me tell you something that's a great place to be I thank God for that you know one time I had a kidney stone and well they thought was a kidney stone I don't know I was about ready to pass out all I know I was hurting so bad I couldn't think straight I squatted down and for fortunately I had one of my co-workers come to me and I was ready to fall in the floor and I didn't know how much longer I was going to be here I was fading fast and he'd come over to me but you know I got to a place that you know at that moment I had the greatest peace in the world something just come to me and you know what I didn't matter if I died at that moment I had I had Jesus on my side I had something to hold me in that time and you know people people you know they want it they want to hold on to something they want to hold on to some kind of idea or some kind of you know Creed or whatever but you know they come to a place where just like that woman - brother Graham talked about you know the Sunday school teacher you know she lived all her life and held on to what somebody had told her but she had never got to the place that she had put an anchor down herself and got got tie post tied where she was anchored to something and when she come to meet the angel of death when death come in the door she was like you're a deceiver you're a liar because you've told me I'm right and I'm done and on my way to hell see that's that's the time to know you got to know that you know that you know why because you never know when it's going to take place none of us are promised tomorrow we're actually not even promised the rest of this evening but we've got to know that we know that we are in him not just waiting on something but let's be in him let's be in Christ there's a place to be that's where I want to be I want to make sure that I am in there and I want to be everything I can in any M not just some idea not some thought but I want a true revelation of that you know you know we have to have a place that we come to that we have this confirmation of who we are a realization of who we are you know many times people have come through and you know they they think they think they have something but you know what they've not sold out they've not emptied themselves out brother Brent said you know that's what he was what he was looking for was empty vessels that he could feel you know there there was an old saying that said God never turns us away empty unless we're full of ourselves so we've got to come to a place that we can empty out ourselves that we can empty out and put everything behind us let God kill us empty us out but God take and do the work that he wants to do that he can mold us and take his his image and mode us and so that we're like him not try to fit the word to us but the word fits us that he molds us to what we need to be that we're impede out you know people people are so confused on so many things you know with Rosedale has been preaching on the new birth you know and it so is so it'll talk and you know people people don't even understand and you know because it's so because people have gotten to the point now where you know that's so below us one because that's the greatest thing that you can come to and the problem is as people people have devalued it and just and just absolutely made it worthless because you know because you know you know because well I was just born this way and so the problem is it is the data they don't see that you know what they were born in sin shaping in iniquity they come in this world dead and I alienated from the plan of God from the life of God and there's got to be a way made across that chasm that you can come into his presence but wonder what is the problem nobody wants to do that nobody wants to die nobody will say empty themselves out it would when you know brother I'm telling that story about the man you know where do you want to go he's telling Moses the the the man was talking to Mose you know you were spilled and he said you know I want to receive the Holy Ghost he won't know where you go well come on I'll show you where you go go out here in the Pigpen guy here in the muck and the mire and all of that oh I can get out there in that well you don't want it bad enough just like a man said you know he told the Lord said you know he said if you don't you know fill me with the Holy Ghost you gonna find a pile of bones laying in this field I'm gonna stay right here till I get what I want you know do we sell out to that you're not thinking about Hannah when she went into the temple that day and stood there and you know who is Eli whoever it was was standing there and you know he thought she was drunk and she was in there praying and seeking God's face why because there was a rebuke on her there was there was an innocent girl it was such a disgrace and her time to be childless and she said there and being childless and she went in there he said Lord can you remove the reproach off of me she didn't care what anybody thought of her what she looked like why because she was praying to God that he would do something for her and wondering if we ever get to the place that we don't care what people think about us and what people look and see but if we could just get in between us and God and we just come together and get in that place where you can speak to us people don't know what prayer is you know I preached about that to myself sometimes you know why is it because prayers and just talking to God that's what we want to do we will talk to God but that's not the whole thing when does God talk to you can you imagine going to a school going into school and you sit there and you're a chatterbox the whole time go to a classroom set and dance and you run your mouth the whole time chatterbox chatterbox interrupts the teacher everybody like it and then you get done and say you know what that teachers worthless he don't teach me nothing well if you'd sit down and keep your mouth closed and take some notes or something maybe you'd learn something maybe the problem is is if we was talk to God say Lord speak to me and we stay there till we hear from God but we just want to talk to God we won't talk to God we want to act like we know what was going on but if we get to the place say Lord just let me just double stay right here till you tell me what I need and people wonder why can people get into conditions they do why because sometimes things happen to us so God can talk to us we wonder what we get in conditions situations we wonder and then God will come on the scene and talk to us you know it's just like it's just like raising children you have you have children and you can try to talk to him and talk to him but sometimes you got to get their attention I had a had a friend of mine his mom his mama dead they fostered they adopted three and I probably over 30 they fostered and Mizzell angel' had a sayin she said a child's brains leak out of their head but they leak into their seat and she said it takes sufficient and repeated pressure to their posterior and that forces all their brains back into their head and she said that's the problem with a lot of kids they walk around here and they got an attitude why because all our brains are in their seat and what happens we will people get in the same way God tries to talk to him why because all their brains are in their seat like that man said people we got Christians that act like Missouri mules hard-headed as a day is long and they and God has to hit him with a two-by-four and then I started saying he touched me whoa he touched me why because he's got to get your attention and many times we just want to talk to God but we don't him talking to us well because that's what he said prayers are not just talking and I just say in words but it's communion than what is communion this conversation is back-and-forth we do may have to make our positions though but the Bible said that he knows our needs before we ever ask her pray for but do we have we ever sat down in the quad in the night or whenever it is and sit there and say Lord speak to me you know I went to a meeting one time and you know I prayed I said lord I would really love to hear from you tonight just speak something to me that touches me I don't care if it touches nobody else in the play place I want to be touched tonight I want something that speaks to me speaks to my heart and you know I sat down brother Wade and in that meeting I go any honestly it felt like if the brother had a sat down beside me in the pew and said Aaron this is this this is this and he would have called my name and said it hey if it is set right beside me he couldn't have told me any more he did but he didn't call my name and he probably didn't even know he was preaching to me but it spoke to my heart and it just overflowed me but you know I walked out of that same building and there was people sitting in the parking lot well you know he said this and he said that well I didn't like this and I didn't like that and he should have said it this way and he should have said it that way and I was like what did y'all come to church for I've never seen anybody so critical in my life and I was just I just had to walk away I was like it doesn't matter because you know what if you'd have gone in the same mine that I was seeing and it don't make me anything but you know what I believe God spoke to me that night and you know what that's not happening every time but I tell you what hey if either sat down beside me and called my name and told me he could have done any more than what he was doing behind the pulpit but you know anything is as people say well you know everybody gets a little critical about this a little bit that well you know what that's what they came for whatever you come to church for tonight you're gonna get if you if you want to find something to build criticize you'll find something to criticize but if you want to find something that's going to bless you and go to draw you closer to God then you can find it but what you're looking for potestas God has it out there for all of us I think I've told you before about the newspaper editor you know that the man was right wrote him in gave him all of their all their mistakes in the newspaper the editor wrote him back and told him said well thank you sir in our in our paper we put something in there for everybody so you know we decided to you know we put in all these mistakes in there so you could find them so we're so glad to help you out in that yeah so if you're looking for mistakes and bolts where you'll find them but sometimes if you're smart you'll find out then you got more than a lot of other folks do you know if you want to find folks you always find your own got a lot more than trying to find somebody else's and point fingers and all these type things but are we looking to find God or we just kind of find fault we're looking for something from God is God there to meet our needs to fulfill what we what we have a desire for what is your desire tonight what is your what are you hungry and thirsting for because that's what we're looking because that's what God can that's all that he can do is meet your need whatever your confession is whatever you're looking for whatever your desiring for but can we but we do we find what we're looking for are we are we desiring for the things of God and even when when the things in our life go wrong you know you know many times people have have looked and you know they want things to be like this and they want things to be like that and you know and then when everything crashes down and said well that wasn't what I was looking for Lord but you know in the end it comes out exactly the way that God has it planned you know I told the story about and I like the story so you might remember it you might not some of you've heard it but you know the you know the man about pushing the boulder you know God told that man to push the boulder that time you know he's pushing that Boulder push the boulder so gonna he was pushing the boulder all the time pushing pushing pushing they every day pushing pushing pushing never couldn't move that Boulder and you know he just kept doing faithful pushing the boulder pushing the boulder and one day he told God he said God he said I'm a failure you know he said I just can't understand I'm pushing this boulder all the time and I'm moving it anywhere and God told him said I didn't tell you to move it I told you to push it he said but look at look at you look how you used to be what's either to see how you are today look at the muscles that you have the calluses look at you look how its defined you he said I never told you to move it I told you to push it well because the boulder wasn't for you to move the boulder was to make a difference in you and many times we have things in our life that come our way and we wonder why why things if God has allowed these things to happen and why we born the way that we're born you know some people some people are born you know people have have temper and you know they have all kinds of other things in their life that they inherit from other people and they wonder why they have sicknesses and all kinds of ailments and everything and it's like well you know you know this is the fourth fifth generation you know we've all had it we all suffer with it you know well you know what maybe it came down to you to put an end to it there's many people you know they've had many people you know where everybody's got heart disease and everybody's got everybody's diabetic and and everybody's got this and everybody's got that I think about brother Jill Forney you know he was in that doctor's office and he's saying all in pamphlets on the wall you know he was gonna go over and look at their thing and then you know he realized you know what that's not a faith he said God's healed me of that anyway back set out he said I wanna go read that why because that gets tough in your mind it's not built on faith you know everybody says well you got to go have this done your cholesterol all out of whack and do this and that you know the thing is is if we'd have more faith in what God said no no you know I'm not saying be stupid or shutting up shouldn't say that word well listen listen let's not act like we have a low IQ or you know like we've lost our minds or whatever hopefully hopefully that's better you know but you know I mean let you know just like brother Dale was saying you know I'll follow you I'll follow you plan I'll follow your plan but I gonna take you chemotherapy but you know the thing is is is people you know you say people you can't live just any old kind of way and expect things to work out right you know it's amazing they were there they done a study and you know one of the most problems that we have in in this world is as people have sleep deprivation people lack of sleep people have sleep apnea and many other ailments they caused them to like sleep do you know that it over long-term sleep loss if you go without sleep for a long time do you know what's it's your body because I'm not having rest your body will become diabetic they had people that stayed up and you know they were sleep deprived for a long time and you know what they were watching their blood sugar levels going up why because there's a time that your body's got to have rest and people say well you know I'm not want to do this I'm not gonna do that let me tell you something if you know what the old saying is if you're if you have problems and you got to count sheep then it's time to talk to the Shepherd there's a time that we've got to come to a place that we can find because you know what everybody's like well I went to this doctor in this specialist and he's gonna send me this specialist and I got nothing wrong with any of that but you know the thing is is I want to have my faith I want to have my diagnosis from the great physician why because he said by his stripes I'm healed then you know what that's what I want to hold on to long before any doctor tries to tell me I got this or that or I'm dying or any other kind of problem just like that doctor told that man one time and everybody tried to tell him you know you had all them kind of ailments and problems saying like it and it's like is there an expiration date on you somewhere we don't know so oh you know only God knows when you're going to war with us you know when your life is over with but you know what you can sit in and wear yourself to death but your brother Brad said you know there's people that you know they come in and then the doctor was saying you know if we can get them to believe that we can do something for them that there's a way that they can get better they'll get better but if they come in and they get in their mind that there's nothing that can be done and it's over with then they're done and it's same way with you and I it's whatever we have our mind on whatever we believe then they will take place God has a has a way for us a way mate and if we can believe in that then God can do something for us if we can just believe and I want to close here in a minute but you know if we if we can just hold on to God's Word what God has given us what God has showed us then you know what you know it'll come to the place that God is intended for it to come to if we can believe what God is seeing you know brother Brenda in the end the message perfect strength a perfect weakness brother branham's hey so he talks about Mary you know and all the things that Mary went through you know Mary had to believe in something that had never taken place Mary had to believe in a word that was spoken over 800 years before and there had been a lot of women born and a lot of children born but you know what there never had been a woman that can that had conceived and birth the child without knowing a man but it was written in the scripture and in all these years it just become just a ritual of reading a virgin shall conceive a virgin shall conceive and a child shall be born all these things that took place and here it wasn't just a just a ritual that went home but you know what there came a time when that had to be fulfilled and you know she had to believe in something that had never taken place didn't feel anything you know anything but she had it take the angel at his word and she had to wait for something to take place and then she had to continue with that month after month after month even when even when people who began to ridicule her all the things that she had to go through chariot carrying this child she brought forth a son even when everybody talked about her and said that she was no good and she's you know the worst kind of woman and everything like that and yet when she stood there and she took him into the temple for him to be circumcised and Simeon was waiting on that one to come to Kabul fill the word that he had been holding with holding on to all that time and when Anna the prophetess was there and she spoke over what was going to take place why'd he come to fulfill and here she was had this child she carried him all that time she'd mothered him she nursed him she fed him she clothed him everything that she had to do for him here he was hers she held on to this child and she carried him she took care of him and that was hers even even when she she lost him and she found him with this you know with the with the leaders and the scholars speaking on the word you know all the things that she had went through all of those years teaching the walk teaching him to write all the things that she had to do that a mother does taking care of him wiping his nose everything that she had to do for him she carried that child and that was her she raised him up and she held on to what the prophecy was fulfilled what the angel had told her of what he was what he was to do and you know there she was and then and then when he came in and he was out one day and John was in the water and he came down and he was baptized and you know no doubt no doubt she knew all about these things had been witness to many things to see him being anointed for his ministry and coming in and doing the miracles here's the same one that she didn't know no doubt she probably stayed up with him at night when he was sick in different things and yet here's this one doing these miracles preaching the word and how about this how about this mother carrying this child raised him up and all this and in the dirt all this time he's standing there and saying tear down this temple in three days I'll raise it again how would you how would you feel if your child kept telling you this in mind but I came into this world to be the Lamb of God what about if it was prophesied all the things that he said that was going to take place this is my this is my outcome this is what I come to do she'd seen all those things take place send all the miracles all the things that took place and then and then one day when the when Judas betrayed him and he was taken taken by the rulers and everybody had betrayed him and left him you know it breaks a mother's heart to see that how would you you know when you see your child and he's taken and then he's beaten and he's had his beard pulled out and they spit on him can you imagine what she was going through what was breaking this woman's heart when he was when he was whipped and beaten mercilessly and drugged through a street carrying a cross and then they took him an accepting naked when it was a worse worse crucifix in the worst death that anybody could suffer and it was her son she had went through all of that and seen him go through all of that and died on a cross and she had and she had carried that word she held it and yet yet he laid in the he laid in the grave when they laid him in and Joseph stoom and he was there and had been one day in two days and three days and you know what she couldn't wait to get to the tomb the scripture says you know they rose early in the morning why because she had to prepare her son's dead body for burial and she went running to the tomb and you know what what she went running to the tomb and then she would she was there and you know what there's no body he's gone there's nothing there and you know what she's heartbroken she's she's all to pieces and she sees a man he like where did you do with my Lord's body and you know what he was there talking to her and she didn't recognize he was him she wanted to know where his body was and there he wasn't he said Mary in her lower the lowest point brother and said her lowest point when I whacked her she went through all of that and there she was standing and he was in her man speaking to her and many times we get in the same condition the lowest of the lowest the problems that we faced all the different cuz situations that we go through and we wonder where God is and you know what he's in the midst and he's speaking our name he's speaking to you he calls in he's calling your name and he was just like he was he was speaking to Mary and then she realized who it was he said don't touch me he said I've got to ascend but you know he said go tell my disciples you know he come to her you know when when that angel come to this young girl and gave her that word you know years down the road because she imagined being the woman that had been that young teenager to hear that word and then years later standing there and seeing the things that he went through could she you know there's no I don't think she does await that she could have imagined the pain and the agony that he went through to see to be a mother to go through that but you know what it all came together when he came from the grave why because he had promised he had prophesied that he would be raised from the dead and many times we just look at the bad things and we get our eyes on the wrong thing but you know what there's a promise in the word for us why because he's risen from the dead he's alive and he's alive forevermore whatever you have neither than the scripture it's alive and same one that scripture laid in the you know the word was there for her and it was laying in the in the scripture but you know she held on to what was taught to her and you know what he carried her all the way to the upper room all the things that she had went through but you know what there was an upper room experience for and brothers and sisters we have that same opportunity no matter how bad it gets no matter how how worse bad whatever the situation is you know what God has it in control and you know what it'll work out in the end there's a blessing in it people say well how'd it how's that going to be I don't know how it's gonna be I just know that he knows because that's what he said let's all stay in the night as the musicians come if we can just come to that situation and realize that God has it all in control amen no matter how bad it looks no matter what goes home God has it in control and if we can just look we just commit it to him why because he's here to confirm his word whatever though whatever the situation is you know all through the scripture we see the people you know the three Hebrew children you know when they went in there you know they they told them said listen we may die but we're not we're not going we're not going to bow our knee he said our gods more than able to deliver us but you know what if he don't we're gonna die we're gonna die with the testimony whatever it is matter how bad it gets or what happens they had put their stake down they had a testimony and you know what God had to come and honor their faith all right and that's the way it is with you and I if we believe it and meet that same condition he'll come and honor his word Lori amen god bless you tonight 250 ones from all in him mighty God
