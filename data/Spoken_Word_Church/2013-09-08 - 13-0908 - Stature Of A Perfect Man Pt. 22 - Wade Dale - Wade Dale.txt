TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah yeah how about you I'm all right this morning all right so all right let's get started uh your homework was to look up the definition of virtue right so anybody wanna go first but I got it right here but I wanna I wanna see what your definition conversion is anybody got a definition um is the righteousness is the strength that somebody can capitalize under it because like we discuss this morning when the lady that touched uh Jesus called me she felt that she had the faith that he had virtue in him and she got the healing he's the person that's born in in us and the faith that we have we won't be together because if you don't um you know Jesus was standing there drunk and had two prostitutes in his arm you know I mean the woman would never have she couldn't draw any strength from that right she had to know you know like the little woman at the well I know that when Messiah we know the one Messiah coming he'll do these things what was she doing she was identifying what she had got from previous learnings and then she was standing in front of the very Fountain of virtue and she could relate to that all right anybody else um it seems that the virtue that Jesus rather than a moral character because of change there seems to be another another meaning strength you know people that we go get a strength and singing muscle lifting no the strength this strength that they're talking about here is it's more it's more of a value of a person as far as what's inside because you got to have them we'll read some quotes in a minute but um look The Virtue Jesus had the virtue we need can't be different because that's where it come from and it can't be two different virtues that mean the same virtue and it's the same strength and you'll read brother Branham he'll say he got weak he got weak because virtue but he said you did it I didn't do it and he said you did you drew the virtue out of me so that's the same thing with Jesus so there's no and same thing with you and I now you and I now there has been one time in my life that I have felt that weakness and that was in Jamaica several years ago that that the people were drawing so much strength till he has allow them because it's just it's like you'd run up marathon and you had to take two steps but see it's not only for healing actually healing is a very small part of virtue very small the very reason we come to church today is that we feel that brother Dale has virtue to preach the gospel that's going to connect back to you and I right well see that's the same way with Jesus the same way if he had not lived a life preached the word that he was and and all those things then the woman that the whale or the woman that was touching His Garment she didn't ever touch the garments but it was virtue it was strength and it's not it's not physical strength but yes it is strength as far as when you draw virtue out of someone you draw strength and brother Brown they have to carrying him off so it was physical right did they not carry him off the platform did Jesus not sit down and lay down in a boat when they absolute category five storm was going on in the boat and he was still asleep and you know what this wasn't no huge boat right the boat probably wasn't much bigger than that room and he was laying down asleep and the water would probably run around said he was coming from a healing campaign and he was so tired into a physical strength was drawn from him all right so we got to look at that that virtue is strength and it's not sitting here at mine the one I got says manly strength it's not manly as in you know huge muscles bench 600 pounds that's not the virtue was talking about because brother Random Hill he'll tell you you say I've seen people that was you know six foot tall and horseback ten six foot tall pretty big six foot tall and big arms and he said not have one ounce of man in them white there was no strength Inner Strength there was no virtue that anybody could draw from so anybody else have a okay power in the words okay all right Behavior showing World standards goodness virtuousness righteousness morality Integrity dignity rectitude honor decency respectability nobility worthiness and Purity a lot of people and we'll read it I think I got the quote where in the Statue of a perfect man that brother Brown said it's not this virtue is not being a virgin okay has nothing to do with that but it does have something to it you got to keep your life clean you understand but that's virtue after you're born again we're not worried about you doing something wrong you know not being a virgin after you understand what I mean not going in and having an act that you shouldn't have had if you didn't have one when you said or you definitely shouldn't have one when you're a Christian you know you know find you a good woman and get married and have fun and make sure you got your hand up yeah I'm sorry that's what struck me because we have the authority to say and you know once we give that virtue to say we have the guardian speak and say I'm Healed you know whatever that's what really it's inner strong because that's what Authority is no way thank you see that's what I wanted everybody to look and see everybody goes well it was for the woman it was for this one but that faith and virtue's got to come with you verse Peter Peter did not walk up to the gate beautiful and just realized he had virtue now I believe Peter knew he had Birch I believe Peter had been talking to God I believe God will show anything and then when the guy says hey you know Peter said silver gold how about none in other words Peter did like I said many times Peter didn't have to go back to the Bible to get his strength because there wasn't one he was writing it at the time there was Old Testament Scrolls but it didn't have the power come on he didn't have the power that Peter had because Peter was on the mountain when Jesus even said he said now I have a more sugar order property well the more more sure word of Prophecy is is he knew he was standing and that he could give virtue you got to know from the inside you got to know from here that you've got virtue right right and it's a confidence Builder that somebody else can draw strength from that right but you got to have it for yourself Jesus had it for himself Jesus was confident in who he was right program zip code he knew who he was he had all the virtues working in his life because he was doing very virtuous made manifest in the human collection and was able to live a human life and have virtue knowledge temperance so that's good next everybody understand that we got we got we got virtue that is going from you in the virtue of this end it says uh went from him to heal a woman and was sick he was expecting the same virtue in his shirt because he was our example to give to the people he expects us to have mercy to give to her okay got to have confidence before you can give it out but you know what it's a revelation every one of these are a revelation every one of these are is a birth it's a birth of God that's uh we're going to read maybe I think I got one before brother Brown says it virtue a lot of people have virtue there are a lot of people in this world but I like being around and they ain't one bit of Christian that ever was but they have certain characteristics about them that's what I learned but now I'm not gonna sit there and draw strength in my Christian Life from that but in my healing life you have a lot of people even that are that are good in fine apps and and good in this and good in that well it's good to listen to them if they've been successful you know of course Dave Ramsey is more of a Christian based um organization so he can put his in scripture but there are people there are that are out in the world that you could draw strength from as far as your personal life as far as you know personal thing in another but we all got to go back to one thing the Bible tells you how to raise kids why like we just read and husband so we don't have to get it from somebody like a lot of people said before I know Daddy mentioned it a lot that people write um how to raise kids and they've never had a kid in their life right well now to me that's I can't draw virtue from that I can't draw virtue from that I'd rather listen to Gabby I'm honest yeah sure this guy can have a PhD lld d-u-m-b or whatever but I'm going to listen to somebody that's raising three kids they had to listen to somebody that's you know yeah write a book up somewhere and never had a experience with children in their life like you got what technology right and head knowledge is not this knowledge this knowledge is okay but it's got to drop down to here that's why that knowledge right there has nothing to do with your school or your schooling that's right as far as natural school all right but now but watch how these virtues are you better joke okay but virtue or anybody else anybody else got one because it's first roll around we've got about 10 out of one of the paper Conformity of one o'clock at Honda Memorial and ethical principles all right so it all comes back to a an overview is is the life you left right the life you live reflects what's inside of you can't help it is going to happen okay one way or the other and then we can draw as Christians we can draw strength from that and watch what God's doing he's he's not these are Holy Ghost um virtue okay I'm talking about virtue one but virtue is These Are Holy Ghost given virtues so that's the way he acts so when we can connect to that we know that that person's got Holy Ghost virtue and let's go one step further it's got to be exercise that's right not an exorcism it's got to be exercise all right like running all right you gotta keep that heart pumping that's the same thing with virtue when Jesus but now Jesus never got up on a stool or a pedestal and said hey you've got to look at me now he did he was confident in a way where he said I am the resurrection in the life because he was the one but now watch old Peter all right Peter said look on me so you got to have that inner confidence not where you have to he didn't have to get up like a scene out of it what I'm saying uh we look at that at that scene where Peter and whoever that was walking in the gate beautiful is is there's only them two in that one man no if you no there's thousands of people moving around and he probably wasn't the only beggar that was there right right surely the goodness he wasn't the only Banker sitting there all right all right so something happened to that man he had he was calling and calling and Peter said look on us so when he got the man's attention from all this other stuff out here not the man's attention he said silver and gold how about none but such as I have if you're buying the name now the definition of virtue that I saw from the uh dictionary was Conformity to a standard of right or morality which is correct a particular moral excellent virtue and it says Celestial hierarchy a beneficial quality or power of a thing manly strength or courage Valor a commendable quality or trade now look man says it's a commendable quality of trade now brother Brown said it's a requirement it's not just commendable it's required that we be that right it's a requirement that we have these things working in our life and look at this one number six a capacity to act potency Peter has the incapacity to act because he had it in him walking down the road he had potency in other words a man said um I'm for the poor or whatever you know Peter would I ain't got nothing for you man I don't have nothing for you I'm I'm no he had some potency he had what he needed and the man drew it a capacity to act Peter would have never shopped but the Holy Ghost in him was telling him stop and he's looking to say look on me look on us in other words get and remember what brother Brown would say he'd say lady look at me what is he doing he was getting attention to focus in on one thing not a lot of people shouting and speaking in tongues and praying around him or jumping up and down or anything he said look at me well what Peter with the same wife he said look on me all right so right here is the one on the angel of the Lord in 1951 brother Brown said the woman that touched him of His Garment got the blessing she asked for it he felt virtue go out but when them men that knowed he was a Prophet this was a point here I want to make but when the men that noted he was a prophet as a woman at the well knew he was a prophet put a rag around his head and hit him in the head with a reed and said now if you're a prophet tell us who hit you they didn't feel no virtue did they it was the way you approach it now Jesus had the same virtue in him when they put the rag around his head and said prophesy and tell us right because remember Peter even rebuked Jesus because people said Lord everybody's touching you so it's not just the physical touch it's got to be that capacity to act or that strength that's already inside of you all right same way with you your your children natural children they drug should be able to draw virtue I said should be able to draw virtue and strength from you as a parent right and I know we fail miserably doing that but still I've told you many times before I wanted in my life what made daddy act the way he did in his life because he thinks he's a failure and I think he did a good job raising you know raising the children and uh and mom also if you can draw a virtue from that too you draw a virtue really from the mothers from the morning you do the come on I mean because mothers mothers are the one that nurtures you right she's the one that Daddy's kind of there to correct a little bit but that Mother's there to be with you every day you know day in and day out so we have it's the very same virtue though it's the very same virtue but see like I said remember Brothers some people can have a virtue and not have the Holy Ghost there's a lot of virtuous parents out there that raise their kids right and they smoke drink pests and don't you know but normally they it's not that way okay normally if they're sorry parents they're sorry children but if you've got some good got good people that's just being good that's just drawing moral strength from a moral standpoint we're talking about something higher than that come on we're talking about we're talking about Heavenly virtue this is the virtue that comes straight from God not just because you were made by God and you have this virtue because a lot of people like I'll go back again brother remember a lot of people's got these virtues and not even born again but being a good parent and being a God-fearing parent and putting all that together virtue is really to me virtue is whites down there see the pyramid is down there right next to Faith if you don't have that strength for people to draw from me like Lisa said for you to draw off yourself gotta come from you first that Fountain don't flow over there in the corner that Fountain flows from here right all right so you come from right here Jesus said didn't have to go get it you don't have to go get it it should be inside of you but that's one of Virtues down there right next to Faith because without virtue without virtue and confidence in yourself how are you going to have knowledge right because faith is just believing come on now Faith is just there it is I believe it but now virtue virtue you got a lot to deal with with Merchant but it's lying right there in the face that you have faith add to your faith add to what you believe virgin and man when you uh you know to me Peter Peter was a man that was I'm trying to pick my words right Peter was a um sometimes a renegade wouldn't you think cut off a guy there curse Jesus when Jesus even when he resurrected Peter went fishing he's out there naked in a boat you know right everybody swam back and Shore and there was Jesus you know he said I'm going fishing man if somebody that was dead raised from the dead and I saw him three days later I wouldn't be fishing but that was Peter's character but see God took that character that Peter had and he molded that so much to him why didn't Paul come out and show the virtues Paul may have been a virtuous man to start with he was raised under Camellia he didn't have the problems Peter had let me just put it that way right but when Peter got the same he birth Paul did God molded that together and man if you could tell it from anybody you'd have to tell it from Peter fishermen were pretty rough you know how fishermen are pretty rough now you know they're pretty tough individual they're the ones that filled the bar rooms and all that up but for them but for them to see Peter then being Fishers of Men not Fishers of fish and cursing and all that stuff you can draw virtue and strength from that because man something's changed in that verse something's really uh birth it's burped into that person that's what it is these virtues of birth they've birthed into you all right what was your question so when she touched him with his garment she was pulling on his strength is that what it was exactly brother Brandon I'll read it in just a few minutes brother Brown said if just like I said it's not me that does it he said you're pulling the strength from me that's why when he was in a prayer line and he'd be talking to a person even in that video you watch the video he's talking to the person and then he turns his head but when he does that light goes away from that person and goes out in the audience what happened that person out there was drawing something that she needed it was a black sister that she needed something and he turned and he said that life's over that sister's head what happened that lady was drawing virtue Jay from Brother Brown now I don't know because it never happened to me like that but I don't know how in the world because see there were people pulling on him all the time there were just certain ones that I guess was pulling more than the others because because brother Brown said said that you know it's just milky white all over the building that's when he'd fall out and under the anointing well he can only stand it just a little while and because many people were pulling I don't know already picked them out but but that was just God's sovereignty knowing that this person needed it and this person needed this person did it like I said the fruit tree is a substance it's something but it's not seen because they because the woman believes who Jesus Christ was that's right so she knew there was something there that opened the channel the Unseen was what you received yeah and got her view right see the channel opened up right because the other people were touching and moving Jesus around probably in their mental brain they were saying builds above and get out of my way I've got work to do and you understand what I'm saying but the one had a need so here's the need and here's the web here's an aid and here's the well which was Jesus the whale are you or me or anybody here's the whale many times many times you you you shake hands rub shoulders with people and all that but but what about that one person that comes up and says thanks for laying hands on me because I want to take my hands Channel opened up in that spirit world like you said we manifest it but that's what I said about faith and you'll understand this because you show me virtue right show me you know I'll show you this piece of paper the show me virtue I only can show you how virtue Acts because your actions speak louder than you were but I can show you how action how my virtue is because of the action same way with knowledge Paul even says we're gonna get into knowledge because Peter said you can know all Mysteries all Mysteries one God Water by appears on them no eternal hell serpent seed and not have charity you're lost okay not have charity you're lost go ahead let's read a couple of quotes and then we'll read in in mark but why did the person not when the people were beating him on the head they weren't looking for virtue that woman had a need she would had been um well let's just say this she'd been on her period for years she'd never got enough blood in her took me to move around she's been to doctors and Physicians and all these other people but see in her heart she said if I could butt touch the Hamilton garment I'll be made whole she said that see there's the confession now Jesus didn't Jesus remember he was walking down through there and we'll read in a minute and he said turns around says who touched me she must have reached under there and crawled up there and and touched His Garment and then backed out because he turned around he said touch me and then brother animal say the Holy Spirit Led me led him to that person that black sister was pulling his was pulling his virtue and then he went directly to that all right who had her hand up I can see where faith comes first it's like that's what makes that hurt and these people in this place didn't have that failure remember faith is totally something you believe that you can't see that's right now by having that though the virtual show by having that the knowledge of by having that the temperature by having that the patient show oh that's nice to my brother I said New Birth is the most important thing in your life because without the new birth you can't have Godly virtue these are god-given virtues they're not man-given virtues all right the angel Lord we were in that so let's go oh I'm sorry um my friend who said if you can get the people to believe you that's how virtual come out that's right they don't believe you they can't arrest you remember the angel said he said if you can get the people to believe you the point not believe in Jesus believe in you they are nothing will stand in front of you not even cancer okay so that's and you say why not I gotta have faith in God if I see it displayed in a man I don't have to go looking for God I found it oh oh ye are God through the word comes to it that's what I told him about in Kansas I said God wants you to be God it's not that God's tired and God's got too much to do he wants you to be God right why do you make us ambassadors a representative because we got ambassadors all over the world the United States Ambassador who got embassies in every country right now Barack Obama can't be in every country at the same time but he has ambassadors that are in those countries that filter through what he says and then they're the representative of the United States same way with God 's God can God can be anywhere and everywhere he wants to be but he wants to display his attributes through you right I don't think we've come to that realization yet I think brother Dale's trying to tell us something with the um for knowledge of God and all and all that coming showing that you and I we're not just people chosen we're chosen people but not we're chosen we're not chosen by God we're chosen in God okay all right Mark 5 30 and Jesus immediately knowing in himself nobody else knew it but him that virtue went out turned about in the press and said who touched my clothes all right let's keep reading the Greek Lexicon this word for virtue in the Greek means dunamis which is power you've heard brother Ernie Villanova say this word many times if you pay attention dunamis power Mighty Works drink Miracle might that's what that word virtue means strength power and look inherent power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth now what happened with the guards they weren't looking for that like they weren't looking for a virtuous man they weren't looking for that so so there was no virtue there for them to draw The Virtue was there they just didn't open the channel but see inherent power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth now is it go back to the same thing we're talking about I Gotta Have It people draw from it but it says inherent power inherent power inside of you supreme power in control right and what was supreme power and control brother Brown said that was Jesus there the greatest anointing was when he sat down and saw himself in the Bible right there in Luke he said Spirit of the Lord's upon made him you understand close the book gracious words proceeded from his mouth all right power to perform Miracles moral power and Excellence of Soul the power and influence which belong to riches and wealth of course that's manly stuff let's go to loot and the whole multitude is starting to touch him or there went virtue out of him and healed them all right and then you go down to Luke 8 45 this is the different this is the the lady Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter said that there was with him after the multitude thrown the empress date and say us now who touched me and Jesus said somebody touched me Peter you don't understand but you don't want one of these days that's going to happen to you could he not have told him that Peter probably was like no ain't no way because Peter was kind of The Bodyguard for me and Peter was Jesus's bodyguard you know he was you know when they come to get him you know a sword whacked the guy's ear off you know he was kind of Jesus's bodyguard and Jesus said hey somebody touched me and probably Peter didn't understand do you think Peter understood I don't because he just said he said he was kind of rebuking Jesus he said man everybody's hitting here I'm trying to keep him off of you he said no somebody had touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me that's why I knew that all right now let's read right here now perseverance to be persistent to try to make a goal trying to you've got your mind set on something and you're persistent in it because you believe it's the thing that you want and you believe you can get it now pardon me to be persistent you've got your mind made up now that what you're going to do now you cannot have faith in God without knowing the word of God or knowing something about God now someone told me if you touched that post you'll get well you're sick I wouldn't believe that you might do it but that's just a little too strong for my faith I don't believe there's any virtue in that post no more than I believe there's virtue in the stature remind you in the crucifix I believe the virtue is in Christ and Christ is the word so that's where we draw it from right we keep it inside and then it works its way out all right we'll stop right there and you know redirect to that the next Sunday because when Virgin can joined sure well honestly Jesus had nobody to work through until he came back on his dead Pentecost like he wanted to he had no one to work through foreign was very patient in waiting for that time of the day of Pentecost when he had 120 people that were like-minded and he could use
