[0:00] he today we're going to today we're
[0:02] going to talk about something no wait a
[0:04] minute
[0:06] today today we're going to talk about
[0:09] the children of the Kingdom or what the
[0:11] kingdom is
[0:12] so let's turn to
[0:16] Matthew I got so many stickers in here
[0:20] three Matthew 3 all
[0:26] right cuz we went through talking about
[0:29] last week about the New Creation new
[0:30] race of people in Acts
[0:33] 2 started what God wanted uh the word
[0:38] Kingdom means Reign or royal power also
[0:43] it's kind of funny that I looked in the
[0:45] Bible definition and strongs and the
[0:48] kingdom means to become king and
[0:52] queen so that sums up the whole thing
[0:55] both of them are a king that's what it
[0:58] says in SC in the strong concordance
[1:01] that the word Kingdom in the Bible when
[1:04] it's talking about Kingdom it is
[1:06] referring to to become king and queen of
[1:09] a
[1:11] domain kind of striking that God didn't
[1:14] want to leave himself out that's
[1:17] why that the kingdom only started on the
[1:19] day of
[1:20] Pentecost we're the only people that's
[1:22] married to Christ Abraham's not married
[1:25] to Christ Isaiah Jeremiah John the
[1:27] Baptist was not even married to Christ
[1:29] so that's why we're going to talk about
[1:30] this new kingdom in Chapter 3 of
[1:33] Matthew in those days Came John the
[1:36] Baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[1:37] Juda and saying repent ye for the
[1:39] Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:43] hand so there was not a sure there was
[1:45] an Earthly
[1:47] Kingdom God's always had a
[1:49] kingdom um Earthly kingdoms through
[1:52] David and all the all the kings that
[1:54] ruled in in the Old Testament but that's
[1:58] not what God wanted God wanted a kingdom
[2:00] for him and his wife to re over remember
[2:05] he was married to Israel in the Old
[2:09] Testament but that's just a
[2:11] type because they were never born
[2:14] again but that was his wife but what did
[2:16] he do when she started hoing around just
[2:20] say in the
[2:21] natural Bible says except for
[2:23] fornication you can't put your wife away
[2:24] but if you catch her run around on you
[2:26] you can put her away and divorce her and
[2:28] marry again and be right y able to do so
[2:32] and uh so that's what God did he
[2:34] divorced them in the Old Testament
[2:37] looking forward to you and I in the New
[2:41] Testament but this Kingdom if you if you
[2:45] got Scofield bible he does a a really
[2:47] good job says the phrase Kingdom of
[2:50] Heaven is
[2:52] peculiar to Matthew and signifies the
[2:55] Messiah rule Earth rule of Jesus Christ
[2:57] the son of David it's called the kingdom
[2:59] of heaven because it's the rulle of the
[3:00] heaven over the
[3:01] Earth so here we got the man coming with
[3:05] the stone cut out without hands remember
[3:07] Daniel saw all these Earthly kingdoms
[3:10] but at the end he saw
[3:12] one stone break that whole image of that
[3:16] whole Earthly Kingdom all right so and
[3:19] and Jesus said I you know pilot asked
[3:21] him said and we'll read it in a minute
[3:23] said uh is your kingdom going to be of
[3:25] this Earth he said no my kingdom is not
[3:26] of this Earth my kingdom is of heaven so
[3:29] mat um John started out repent ye for
[3:31] the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[3:35] hand and then we know that Matthew in
[3:38] the Book of Matthew Jesus starts
[3:40] preaching the
[3:42] kingdom uh pray like this Our Father who
[3:46] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name in
[3:47] other words thy kingdom come thy will be
[3:50] done the kingdom had not come yet the
[3:51] kingdom was in him but the kingdom had
[3:54] to get out and that's what happened in
[3:55] the book of Acts that's why that Jesus
[3:57] had to die to release the a life so that
[4:00] he could have a queen cuz where did
[4:03] where did um Eve come from Eve come out
[4:07] of Adam all
[4:11] right and that's why that you and I have
[4:14] to be born again to become that bride to
[4:16] go back in the side of Adam or the
[4:18] second Adam all right now let's turn to
[4:22] Matthew
[4:24] 11 oh wait a minute let's go Genesis 10
[4:26] cuz this is where the first Kingdom the
[4:29] word Kingdom in the Bible this is the
[4:31] first time it's used and look who's used
[4:33] it because guess who wants to set up a
[4:35] kingdom
[4:37] first see always wanted to set up a
[4:40] kingdom
[4:42] first 10 Genesis 10
[4:46] 10 let's read verse
[4:49] eight and Kush now these are the sons of
[4:51] ham that came after the fall I mean
[4:53] after the
[4:54] flood and ham is one that brought sin
[4:57] across M because he did what he did to
[4:59] his
[5:00] father and Kush begot Nimrod he began to
[5:04] be mighty one on the earth now Nimrod is
[5:06] one that created
[5:08] Babylon he was a mighty Hunter before
[5:10] the Lord wherefore it is said even as
[5:12] Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord
[5:14] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[5:18] Babel Satan began his kingdom at the
[5:22] Tower of Babel brother Bram will tell
[5:24] you that if you look at he he slops Two
[5:26] Babylons and in brother bram's reading
[5:28] you'll see that he organized he brought
[5:30] things together Nimrod was just like you
[5:34] see brother bandam typed him you see the
[5:37] the the Beast working in Genesis the
[5:39] Beast working in the middle and the
[5:40] Beast working in the end all right cuz
[5:42] it came from an organization in the
[5:44] beginning cuz right here Genesis 10 this
[5:45] is right you know right at the first of
[5:47] the book right after the
[5:50] flood they began to come
[5:53] together you know and
[5:56] U and they all spoke the same language
[5:58] and they remember what God did God
[6:00] confounded the language and that's what
[6:01] sent the people out all over the world
[6:03] that's what sent them out to populate
[6:05] the rest of the of the world so that's
[6:08] the first Kingdom set up and that was
[6:09] the kingdom of Satan cu the kingdom of
[6:12] God was started in the in the uh Garden
[6:16] of Eden God was beginning to build his
[6:19] kingdom in the Garden of Eden he put
[6:21] Adam and Eve there what husband and wife
[6:23] king and queen MH all right well when
[6:26] that got
[6:27] marred he couldn't do that anymore had
[6:30] to stop wait didn't bother God made sure
[6:35] that all his attributes would be
[6:37] displayed but that's what we're going
[6:38] back to King and Queen ruling in the
[6:41] Garden of Eden same thing all right and
[6:44] that was just striking to me that
[6:46] that um kingdom here that it talks about
[6:49] in the Bible especially in the New
[6:51] Testament the definition is to become
[6:53] king and queen of a domain not just
[6:55] King not just king king and
[6:58] queen all right so now let's go to
[7:03] Matthew
[7:06] 11 and John preached the Kingdom of
[7:09] Heaven is at hand John did not preach
[7:12] the Kingdom of
[7:15] Heaven everybody understand
[7:17] that John could not preach the Kingdom
[7:20] of Heaven because the Kingdom of Heaven
[7:21] Wasn't in him right the kingdom of
[7:24] heaven was in Jesus Christ he was
[7:27] preaching repent for the kingdom of
[7:29] heaven is
[7:31] coming right
[7:33] here Behold the Lamb of God takes away
[7:35] the sin of the world coming all
[7:39] right now
[7:43] listen verse
[7:47] seven and what John let me give you a
[7:49] little behind this John the Baptist
[7:51] sends his disciples John's already in
[7:53] jail and he sends his
[7:56] disciples to ask Jesus
[8:00] are you the one that should come or do
[8:03] we look for another in other words John
[8:05] was brother BR said John's the Eagle Eye
[8:07] was filmed over he was doubting his own
[8:09] self now if John had been born again
[8:12] guess what would have happened now John
[8:14] was full of the Holy Ghost we read that
[8:15] last night in the Bible study for those
[8:17] of you that weren't here we John the
[8:19] Baptist was full of the Holy Ghost the
[8:21] Bible say filled with the holy ghost
[8:22] from his mother's womb but that was an
[8:24] anointing that was not a baptism of the
[8:26] Holy Ghost brother randam never said and
[8:28] the Bible never said John the Baptist
[8:31] received the new birth he received an
[8:33] anointing of the Holy Ghost on his
[8:36] Spirit to do a job now not to say John's
[8:39] Soul was black but John's Soul was not
[8:43] born again or he would have not ask this
[8:46] question are you the one or do we look
[8:49] for another that's the same man that
[8:50] stood in the Jordan
[8:52] River saw a man coming said Behold the
[8:56] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[8:57] the world walks right up to him the
[8:59] Bible says John the Baptist was told
[9:01] when he sees this Dove or this Spirit
[9:03] descending on this man and remain that's
[9:06] the man that's going to restore the
[9:08] Kingdom
[9:09] right
[9:14] now several years
[9:16] later John's in
[9:19] prison Matthew
[9:22] 11 something happened to
[9:26] John John didn't backslide but the
[9:29] anointing had left him right his
[9:31] ministry was over it was done
[9:35] finished I've always said before think
[9:38] of this John and Jesus were cousins by
[9:42] what people could see we understand
[9:43] Jesus was no kin to anyone on Earth but
[9:46] Elizabeth and Mary were first
[9:49] cousins all
[9:50] right that made John and Jesus second
[9:53] cousin by by Earthly looking lineage all
[9:56] right and they probably grew up together
[9:58] and and then John at 9 years old went
[9:59] out in the desert remember and then when
[10:01] he they met back together but why didn't
[10:04] Jesus go get John out of
[10:06] prison he was just in there because
[10:09] because he went up to Herod and said
[10:10] told herod's wife he couldn't have that
[10:12] woman as his he Herod was going to marry
[10:14] his brother's
[10:16] wife you know John said can't do
[10:20] that that's all he was in prison for why
[10:23] didn't Jesus just go do some miracle and
[10:25] get his cousin out of the cuz that's the
[10:27] man that introduced him
[10:29] that's right Jesus knew that was the man
[10:32] cuz he said right here in in chapter 11:
[10:34] 7 what went out you to see a reed shaken
[10:37] in the wind but what when you out to see
[10:40] a man clothed in soft rment behold they
[10:41] that wear soft clothing are in King's
[10:43] houses but what went out to see him a
[10:45] prophet yeah I say unto you more than a
[10:48] prophet why didn't Jesus go get him out
[10:50] of
[10:51] jail he could have walked right into the
[10:54] court walked right up and got him out of
[10:56] jail and nobody ever said a word his Min
[11:00] he was finished right he was done God
[11:03] was finished with that man called John
[11:05] the Baptist because when you introduced
[11:08] like brother Rand said he said if the
[11:09] great one is on the scene I must in
[11:12] decrease decrease because here right now
[11:15] is even a group of people that are still
[11:17] Disciples of John
[11:21] some two years
[11:24] later they're still Disciples of John
[11:27] now if you last night the Bible study
[11:29] remember I read way
[11:31] over when Apollos was preaching in the
[11:35] book of
[11:36] Acts which was
[11:39] in what year was that in let's see it
[11:41] was in 8033 another two more years after
[11:45] this was ad31 according to the scofi two
[11:48] years later they're still Disciples of
[11:50] John and they're being taught by
[11:53] Apollos and Paul walks in and says have
[11:55] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[11:56] believe they said we don't know anything
[11:57] about the Holy Ghost we just know know
[11:59] that we were we're Disciples of John
[12:01] remember I read last night M Disciples
[12:03] of John the Baptist two some two to
[12:05] three years after all this event after
[12:07] Jesus had done died and all that why
[12:10] because John the Baptist was a great man
[12:12] they believed on John the Baptist
[12:14] Apollos was preaching by what John was
[12:15] saying that Jesus was the
[12:18] Christ so why didn't Jesus right here
[12:20] just say well let's go get him out of
[12:23] prison no for
[12:26] one he knew that that Ministry was over
[12:30] and the father didn't lead him to do
[12:32] it so his ministry was done and finished
[12:35] but there was no greater man let's read
[12:37] verse n but what went you out to see a
[12:39] prophet yeah I say unto you and more
[12:41] than a prophet for this is he of whom it
[12:44] is written behold I send my messenger
[12:45] before my face which shall prepare thy
[12:48] way before thee verily I say unto you
[12:51] among them that are born of woman this
[12:54] is God speaking it has to be true this
[12:57] is not just Jesus without a word words
[12:59] remember when I preached partial to
[13:01] perfect what Jesus done was perfect that
[13:03] was the perfect will of God if it's
[13:05] written in this Bible it's the perfect
[13:06] will of God right all right verily I say
[13:09] unto you among them that are born of
[13:11] women there hath not risen a greater
[13:14] than John the
[13:16] Baptist now from John backwards look at
[13:18] all the great people Abraham Isaiah
[13:21] Jeremiah
[13:23] Moses that's St a my
[13:25] fa notwithstanding he that is least in
[13:29] the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[13:33] and from the days of John the Baptist
[13:35] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[13:36] suffereth violence and the violent take
[13:39] it by force that's what he was talking
[13:41] about now let's go to Luke and get
[13:43] another angle of this Luke
[13:52] 7 verse
[13:56] 24 and when the messengers of John were
[13:58] departed and he began to speak un the
[14:00] people concerning John what went you out
[14:02] in the wilderness for to seea read
[14:04] shaken with the
[14:05] wind but when he went out yet out for to
[14:09] see a man clothed in soft rment behold
[14:11] they which are gorgeously apparel and
[14:13] live delicately are in King's
[14:16] courts but what went you out for the see
[14:18] a prophet yeah I say unto you much more
[14:20] than a Prophet this is he of whom it is
[14:22] written behold I send my messenger
[14:23] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[14:25] way before thee for I say unto you among
[14:28] those that are born of women there is
[14:29] not a greater Prophet than John the
[14:31] Baptist but he that is least in the
[14:34] kingdom of God is greater than
[14:37] he now but the kingdom of God is the on
[14:41] that has the Holy Ghost right the
[14:43] kingdom of God was not in power yet the
[14:47] kingdom of God during this time was
[14:48] still bottled up in Jesus
[14:51] Christ he had to die to get it
[14:54] out so on the day of Pentecost 120 like
[14:57] we read last Sunday
[15:00] started the new creation new race New
[15:03] Kingdom of people cuz like we said last
[15:06] night in the Bible study you have to
[15:08] listen you have to hear the word you
[15:09] have to hear some kind of a sermon or a
[15:11] a witness or something before the Holy
[15:14] Ghost can fall on you because it has
[15:15] nothing to fall
[15:16] on uh it can't just fall on dry ground
[15:19] or or Barren ground it has to fall on
[15:21] good ground so they had to hear a sermon
[15:24] well theyve heard for three and A2 years
[15:26] that's what the disciples heard that was
[15:28] the Kingdom of Heaven out of three and
[15:30] 1/2 years there's been Untold billions
[15:32] of sermons doctrines false and true that
[15:35] have come out of that 3 and a half years
[15:37] that Jesus spoke but everything from the
[15:39] book of Acts all the way to the Book of
[15:41] Revelations was what it was based on
[15:43] what Jesus taught while he was here
[15:46] right you said oh well that they took
[15:48] some out of the Old Testament come on
[15:50] people who's the one who wrote that in
[15:51] the Old Testament right right the man
[15:54] that was standing on the shores of
[15:55] Galilee okay so Jesus wrote the entire
[15:59] Bible I believe I just believe Jesus
[16:01] Christ not the flesh the Jesus Christ
[16:03] the the God Almighty wrote this whole
[16:06] Bible sure it is all right and but he
[16:09] came had to come on Earth as a witness
[16:11] said for the least in the kingdom is
[16:12] greater than John the Baptist now what
[16:15] kingdom we just talked about a kingdom
[16:17] of heaven now let's turn
[16:20] to
[16:23] John
[16:27] 18
[16:31] let's read the last thing Jesus said
[16:33] about this
[16:35] Kingdom all right this is the last thing
[16:37] Jesus said about the kingdom this is
[16:39] right before they crucify
[16:42] him all right verse
[16:45] 34 Jesus answered him saying thou sayest
[16:48] th oh sorry verse 33 pilate entered into
[16:52] the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus
[16:53] and said unto him art thou the king of
[16:55] the
[16:56] Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this
[17:00] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[17:03] thee of me in other words are you coming
[17:05] up with this or did you hear it from
[17:07] somebody else pilot answered am I
[17:11] Jew thine own nation and the chief
[17:13] priest have deliver thee unto me what
[17:15] hast thou
[17:16] done in other words he did hear it from
[17:19] somebody else that's what he's telling
[17:20] Jesus uh your priest is the one that
[17:22] brought you here Jesus answered my
[17:25] kingdom is not of this world if my
[17:29] kingdom were of this world then would my
[17:30] servants fight see right then and there
[17:33] that's why the Bible said he died a l o
[17:37] n e he died alone there was nobody in
[17:42] his kingdom at that time on the Earth
[17:45] right nobody that's right they wish
[17:48] nobody to fight for
[17:49] him but he said if his kingdom was here
[17:52] if my servants my kingdom was here
[17:55] they'd fight for me but they're
[17:57] not that I should not Bel be delivered
[18:00] to the Jews but now is my kingdom not
[18:02] from hence in other words not
[18:05] here pilot therefore said unto him art
[18:08] thou a king then Jesus answered thou
[18:09] sayest that I am a king to this end I
[18:12] was born was I born and for this cause
[18:14] came I into the world that I should bear
[18:17] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[18:21] of the truth heareth my
[18:25] voice and a sheep and and another sheep
[18:28] or a goat they will not follow right so
[18:31] this Kingdom of Heaven was standing
[18:32] there in Jesus
[18:35] Christ but let's not get into the SE of
[18:38] the seed cuz we we've been over that and
[18:39] over that Jesus said there was a swer
[18:42] went out to seow and what did he sow
[18:44] sowed seed what he say the seed was seed
[18:46] was the word of God who sowed it the son
[18:48] of man what was the children that came
[18:50] up from that it was the children of the
[18:51] Kingdom right
[18:54] us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and The
[18:57] People's soul
[18:58] all right so what are we looking
[19:02] at Jesus was a
[19:04] king he was standing here in front of
[19:06] pilate and he said you say I'm a king
[19:08] and to this end I was born but he never
[19:10] said I am king and queen and I have this
[19:13] Kingdom set up he said my kingdom is not
[19:15] of this
[19:18] world
[19:20] why he didn't have a queen that's right
[19:24] he have a queen with him right eveil was
[19:27] still inside of him
[19:28] right eveeve could not reproduce Adam as
[19:31] long as Eve was inside of Adam right she
[19:35] had to come out of Adam to reproduce
[19:37] Adam right we had to come out of Jesus
[19:41] to reproduce Jesus Christ cuz this is
[19:43] still the law of reproduction law of
[19:45] reproduction is he told uh he told Adam
[19:49] and Eve to multiply and replenish the
[19:51] Earth right right before they were in
[19:54] flesh
[19:56] bodies see we think that that's oh
[19:58] that's sex we sex we sex is going to
[20:00] repopulate the world that's permissive
[20:03] will absolutely that's exactly what
[20:05] happened but that's not what Jesus was
[20:07] talking about or the Christ was talking
[20:09] about in Genesis
[20:10] 1:26 he wasn't talking about sexual
[20:12] birth no he was talking about being born
[20:15] again that to me Genesis 1:26 and 27 God
[20:18] was setting up his kingdom that is his
[20:21] kingdom because that's his bride that's
[20:25] who he was looking for at that time we
[20:26] were in theophany form in died that
[20:29] man but when he put Adam out and then
[20:32] took Eve out of Adam he was beginning to
[20:35] bring that
[20:38] Kingdom see he could
[20:40] say if we were to glean this in
[20:43] scripture and and go back into the mind
[20:45] of
[20:46] God God was
[20:48] saying just what John
[20:52] said but he don't at that time he didn't
[20:55] have to say repent John said repent for
[20:58] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[21:00] Genesis 1 126 and 27 just says the
[21:03] Kingdom of Heaven is at
[21:04] hand CU we didn't have you don't have to
[21:06] repent Genesis 126 never had to repent
[21:08] of nothing
[21:10] right
[21:12] nothing that's
[21:15] God
[21:17] Eternal but he told us to multiply and
[21:20] replenish the
[21:21] Earth
[21:23] how the seed is the word so or so son of
[21:27] man son of man had to come to se the
[21:28] seed now because of the Fall once you
[21:30] get down to the fall then you got to do
[21:32] it this way God wanted it this way
[21:35] remember we was talking about last
[21:36] Wednesday night this is eternal God this
[21:37] long ribbon is eternal God everything's
[21:41] going to work back up to that but down
[21:44] here now is where all this is coming
[21:45] from the kingdom of heaven now has to
[21:47] come up out of what Born Again Believers
[21:51] just like we talked about last night why
[21:53] didn't Cornelius why didn't Apollos
[21:55] Apollos was preaching Jesus was the
[21:57] Christ he was getting converts he was
[21:59] baptizing them under John's baptism of
[22:03] regeneration why didn't they get the new
[22:07] birth cuz they didn't have it to
[22:11] give now does everybody understand that
[22:13] if you were here last night you ought to
[22:14] understood it cuz we really covered it
[22:16] really well last night but for those of
[22:17] you that weren't
[22:19] uh that New Birth come on to that
[22:23] Pentecost to a group of 120 people and
[22:26] that begun the kingdom of God right
[22:30] before that nobody had the new birth in
[22:33] their soul except Jesus Christ and it
[22:35] wasn't a new birth he was the birth
[22:38] right he didn't need a new birth he's
[22:39] born right the first time right okay he
[22:42] didn't need a new birth he Soul was
[22:44] almighty God okay ours comes in a fallen
[22:49] condition and has to be taken back but
[22:51] why didn't apalus and and Cornelius why
[22:54] didn't God just give him the Holy
[22:56] Ghost why didn't he just say well man
[22:58] that sure aren't preaching real good
[23:00] just like we were talking about
[23:02] um you know like U brother Claud and I
[23:06] were talking and somebody we were
[23:07] sitting in here this morning talking
[23:08] about
[23:09] it one old brother um Ray we were
[23:12] talking about people that really preach
[23:13] it's just nothing but just it's just
[23:16] like the reading room at at U at the
[23:18] latterday Saints or wherever they do
[23:20] that reading room thing at just you just
[23:23] reading like a newspaper that's right CU
[23:25] there's no New Birth well they can't you
[23:27] know they're preaching to a th people or
[23:29] or 15 people if they ain't got the new
[23:32] birth they definitely not going to get
[23:33] it for the congregation right now they
[23:35] congregation may go out and hear it and
[23:37] the word spark and they come back with
[23:38] new birth but I promise you one thing
[23:39] they won't stay in that church long if
[23:41] that Pastor ain't got the new birth
[23:42] right cuz you can't come together and
[23:44] degree except you be one right but God
[23:48] was starting in Genesis 1:26 that's what
[23:50] he started to do he started to build his
[23:52] kingdom Satan came into his domain into
[23:54] his kingdom and
[23:56] said I'm going to stop stop that cuz
[23:59] that's what he did he stopped a Son of
[24:02] God and a daughter of God from being
[24:03] born like they should have been born and
[24:06] that's what he's doing right now through
[24:08] spirituality spiritual birth he's trying
[24:11] to keep a son and daughter of God from
[24:12] being born again right that's been his
[24:15] Ploy since the Garden of Eden he just
[24:17] planted a natural seed into Eve through
[24:20] the Beast to pollute it so that God
[24:23] couldn't use it cuz remember he's a
[24:25] perverter Satan doesn't even have a seed
[24:27] cuz the is life Satan doesn't have life
[24:30] God created the devil right God gave the
[24:35] devil power but Satan can't create God's
[24:38] the only one that can take something and
[24:40] and out of from nothing and bring
[24:41] something out the devil has to take
[24:43] something that's already here right he
[24:45] had to take Eve and pervert the world
[24:47] through Eve he had to use a vehicle he
[24:50] couldn't have created a vile woman he
[24:53] can't create a vile
[24:54] man God does all the creating and Satan
[24:57] just
[24:58] perverse but that's the way God wanted
[25:01] it to to be happen in the garden so
[25:02] let's get it straight from the garden of
[25:04] of Eden when or before the Garden of
[25:06] Eden when Adam and Eve were together in
[25:09] theophany in in theophany form in
[25:11] Genesis
[25:12] 1:26 God told them to multiply and
[25:14] replenish the earth now the way they
[25:17] were going to do that was through
[25:19] spiritual
[25:20] multiplication just like we see now that
[25:23] this little church has come from 15
[25:25] people to you know close to 100 sometime
[25:29] why if we're all born again spiritual
[25:32] multiplication that's
[25:34] right seed being
[25:36] planted being a birth becoming out of
[25:40] that that's exactly what Genesis 1:26
[25:43] wanted that's what God wanted right but
[25:47] not in the form of us being in sinful
[25:49] flesh but through permissive will we had
[25:52] to come this way now because he had
[25:55] inside of him an attribute to be a
[25:56] Healer there's no way he could be
[25:59] display that attribute except somebody
[26:01] be sick so he allowed the fall to happen
[26:04] so he could be a savior a redeemer A
[26:06] Healer all these compound names Jehovah
[26:09] J and all Raa and all those things like
[26:12] that but that's not God wanted but
[26:14] remember watch it working back
[26:16] to God said multiply and replenish the
[26:18] Earth spiritual form
[26:20] here guess what it's come to same thing
[26:23] right here
[26:26] right right here was the same thing he
[26:29] said here as he's saying here multiply
[26:31] and replenish the Earth spiritual form
[26:35] multiply and replenish the Earth right
[26:37] here right Jesus said my kingdom is not
[26:40] of this
[26:41] world in other words I can't birth a
[26:44] child not until I get in a
[26:47] bride and he nurtured those 12 disciples
[26:50] and then remember last night as we were
[26:51] talking remember the Bible says the
[26:53] unclean Spirit goes out see that's what
[26:55] Jud that's why Judas had to leave cuz he
[26:57] had an unclean Spirit he had to go out
[26:59] before those other 11 could come to God
[27:03] cuz he was the one that was stopping
[27:04] them per se you know he was the one that
[27:07] was the evil one and once he went out
[27:10] they got together went in the upper room
[27:12] and then here was 12 disciples that went
[27:14] around the world changing the
[27:16] world because of that you just said do
[27:19] you think that we brother brand well
[27:22] that the unrighteous won't be able to
[27:24] sit in the congregation of the righteous
[27:26] do you think it'll literally come to
[27:28] that I think it literally
[27:30] happened brother Brown say somebody
[27:32] could come in and pollute the whole
[27:34] church by being unbeliever or have
[27:36] something in their life and it hinder
[27:38] the whole church cuz you said Anan and
[27:40] Safara come in too and that's the same
[27:42] what happened um ananas and safire were
[27:46] not
[27:49] U let me put it this way they were
[27:54] not they weren't committing adultery
[27:56] they weren't stealing I mean I mean they
[27:57] weren't per se they weren't they didn't
[27:59] go out and do something
[28:01] wrong they just sold what they had and
[28:05] didn't give all of it to Peter and
[28:08] them and they and then Peter asked the
[28:10] question if you reading Peter asked both
[28:11] of them the same question did you give
[28:14] all and and I said yes Peter said you've
[28:18] lied against the Holy Ghost he fell over
[28:21] dead and I think it's going to come to
[28:23] the same way we going to say you've been
[28:25] in this church 20 years you got the new
[28:26] birth yeah I got the new birth Earth Yep
[28:28] you going to have to produce it that's
[28:29] right or God's going to take you out
[28:31] right this place is going to be clean I
[28:34] ain't talking about just this place I'm
[28:35] talking about his kingdom his kingdom is
[28:36] going to be clean before this all gets
[28:38] over okay I mean it's like d said and
[28:42] that's true last night the reason we
[28:43] don't get a lot of things is because
[28:45] we're not close to God like we should
[28:46] and it's going to take persecution I'm
[28:48] afraid we're lay out to sin I don't
[28:50] matter if you full of the Holy Ghost
[28:51] from your toe to your
[28:54] nose you still we're just this is is the
[28:57] age we live in and but God knew it so he
[28:59] made a provision he's going to put us
[29:01] through some persecution that's right we
[29:04] got way too much and that's all of us
[29:07] brother brandham said he said you he
[29:09] said I fast before I come to a service
[29:13] during the day he said I fast and pray
[29:16] for two to three hours they come and get
[29:18] me out of the motel I go straight to the
[29:20] pull pit he said I don't talk to nobody
[29:23] he was telling one time that somebody
[29:24] did actually come in and and tried to
[29:26] shake his hand and say God bless you
[29:28] brother R started talking he said that
[29:29] took me he said it took me you know a
[29:31] long time he didn't say how long took me
[29:33] a long time to get myself back on track
[29:35] when not sure you say well that's a gift
[29:38] it should be all of
[29:39] us that's why I'm telling you if you
[29:41] come to church 5 minutes before the
[29:43] service starts or 15 minutes after
[29:45] you're hindering the service right I
[29:47] don't care if you're just the most
[29:48] spiritual person that ever lived on face
[29:50] this Earth you're hindering the
[29:52] service that's why brother bam said 20
[29:55] minutes before service come in sit down
[29:57] clear your mind pray no we run in
[30:02] throwing stuff everywhere like he said
[30:04] have a fight with their wife or kids
[30:07] fighting in the back you know just
[30:10] that's just things that's going to
[30:11] happen cuz we're lay out to see it but
[30:13] when we ever do I read you that quote
[30:15] last night remember I read in the in the
[30:17] Christ the mystery of God revealed if
[30:19] the church ever all gets the Holy Ghost
[30:21] and they all get all this stuff out of
[30:22] the way she'll be a mighty Army so guess
[30:24] what's hindering us is us right now is
[30:26] what's hinding that's right
[30:28] and that's
[30:29] everybody I don't consecrate my life
[30:31] like I should none of y'all do I just
[30:33] don't think you do I right we don't we
[30:36] don't we don't put you know we don't
[30:39] even hardly put 10% of our life to study
[30:42] you know um and we're the greatest
[30:46] hindrance then it's not the preachers
[30:48] not hindering us it's us hindering
[30:50] so right let's get back on the positive
[30:53] the kingdom of heaven will be here
[30:54] whether we want it to be or not that's
[30:56] right all right I mean the Kingdom of
[30:58] Heaven part of it or not God's going to
[31:00] have a predestinate I read it last night
[31:02] in Christ the mystery God's going to
[31:04] have a bride period she's predestinated
[31:07] to stand she's predestinated to make it
[31:09] in this age and she's predestinated to
[31:12] get into the position she's supposed to
[31:13] get into so your choice is the election
[31:17] part you can either elect to get in it
[31:20] or you can elect to vote for the other
[31:21] guy right you know you bring the devil
[31:24] in or you bring God in it's our choice
[31:26] all the way
[31:27] and that's even hard for people to see
[31:29] that even people in the Statue of a
[31:30] perfect man that goes up that seems like
[31:32] that you know they're so spiritual they
[31:34] can just cut God off anytime they want
[31:36] to and that's the way we do cuz the
[31:38] Bible says grieve not the holy spirit so
[31:40] guess what we can grieve
[31:43] him it says grieve not the holy spirit
[31:45] of God whereby your seal brother R said
[31:47] he's very
[31:48] timid he's a
[31:51] gentleman right the Holy Ghost is a
[31:53] gentleman right remember dad's going to
[31:55] get on that but the Holy Ghost comes
[31:57] brother R say it's a sweet Spirit he
[31:58] said sometimes when that Angel's in the
[32:00] room he said you don't ask him a
[32:02] question what it's a little different
[32:05] that angel is not the Holy Ghost right
[32:07] that angel was somebody sent from God to
[32:08] direct brother randam right but that
[32:11] angel never gave brother randam a
[32:13] revelation of nothing that's right he
[32:16] told him where to find it in the
[32:17] scripture brother brand went and read it
[32:19] in the scripture and the Holy Ghost
[32:20] Inside of brother Bram said that's right
[32:22] right brother Bram just didn't walk in
[32:24] out and say well bless God I had an
[32:26] angel walk through the door and I'm
[32:27] going to preach serpent seat read the
[32:30] read the 1959 he said I studied all day
[32:34] he said I went in back in the scriptures
[32:36] and saw how it tied together all down to
[32:38] the
[32:39] scripture what happened the Holy Ghost
[32:41] then quickened what was inside of him
[32:43] wasn't the angel quickening nothing an
[32:45] angel can't give you
[32:47] anything we're supposed to be greater
[32:49] than the angel right the Holy Ghost
[32:51] Inside of us is greater than the angel
[32:53] because the Holy Ghost Inside of us
[32:54] created that angel right
[32:57] and let Dad get into that so that that's
[33:00] that's okay but let's go back to the
[33:02] kingdom the kingdom of God is now
[33:06] being
[33:07] produced through seven Church ages
[33:10] through seven Messengers through all the
[33:11] people that are in that age some of them
[33:14] look like they just barely made it and
[33:16] you know what brother Bram told us he
[33:18] said some of us will just barely make it
[33:19] that's right by the skin of our
[33:23] teeth and that's okay as long as you
[33:24] make it that's right that's right long
[33:27] as you make it David said let me be a
[33:29] doorm in the house of God at least he
[33:30] was in the house that's right right you
[33:33] know just get me in the house Lord I you
[33:35] know I don't like Brother Ray said he
[33:37] didn't have a call to preach and he
[33:38] thank God for that people told him he'd
[33:40] been the message for 40 years seniority
[33:42] don't make you a preacher I'll promise
[33:44] you
[33:47] that it is good that you have some
[33:49] seniority and you're a preacher it is
[33:51] but like Brother Ray said he said I
[33:53] don't have a call you know what that's
[33:55] good yeah that's all right ain't a thing
[33:59] as long as he knows that right that's
[34:02] better than these people that don't know
[34:04] it and go get in a pull pit can Daddy
[34:06] called and Mama s right he's our brother
[34:09] that's
[34:10] important
[34:12] exactly well we can't all like you know
[34:14] Paul said we can't all be of this and of
[34:16] this and of this and of this
[34:20] no just doing the little things of God
[34:23] that's that's part of the Kingdom cuz
[34:25] the kingdom is really not just just the
[34:27] king and
[34:28] queen it's the king and queen of a
[34:30] domain and a domain is people places
[34:35] houses economy you say God's got an
[34:38] economy absolutely he's got a perfect
[34:40] economy no money involved that's right
[34:43] no money involved that the scriptures
[34:45] what we use economy of God sure what we
[34:48] use for to make our economy we going to
[34:52] walk
[34:52] on so but the kingdom of God is within
[34:57] then that's what we'll start on next
[34:59] week I mean not next week brother Joe's
[35:00] got next week cuz brother Donnie and
[35:01] myself and Dad will be leaving Monday
