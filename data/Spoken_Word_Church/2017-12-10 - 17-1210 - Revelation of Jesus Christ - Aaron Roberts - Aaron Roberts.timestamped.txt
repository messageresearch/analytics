[0:33] Cigna Corinthians chapter 10 chapter
[0:43] 10
[0:45] appreciate brother the weeks filling in
[0:47] for my last Sunday
[0:48] I didn't realize I was gonna do a whole
[0:51] month I just he asked me brother way to
[0:53] ask me if I want to do Sunday school and
[0:55] I thought I thought he meant like one
[0:56] time I don't realize it for the whole
[0:58] month do one thing
[1:00] well I think that voice told me yeah
[1:02] wisely maybe twice and maybe can do next
[1:04] Sunday too
[1:05] no there's just about one time and we're
[1:08] gonna have our Christmas from thing next
[1:09] time you don't give anything you
[1:12] say
[1:14] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[1:16] says now I Paul myself beseech you by
[1:19] the meekness and gentleness of Christ
[1:21] who in presence am base among you but
[1:24] being absent am bold toward to you but I
[1:27] beseech you that I may be that I may
[1:30] know may not be bold when I am present
[1:34] with that confidence wherewith I think
[1:36] to be bold against some which some of us
[1:40] some which think of us as if we walked
[1:45] according to the flesh though we walk in
[1:47] the flesh we do not war after the flesh
[1:50] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:52] carnal but mighty through God to the
[1:54] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:57] imaginations and every high thing that
[1:59] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[2:01] God and bringing into captivity every
[2:03] thought to the obedience of Christ and
[2:06] having in a readiness to
[2:10] revenge all disobedience
[2:11] when your obedience is fulfilled
[2:15] so bless your name yeah so it's not
[2:20] prepared this morning so but haven't
[2:23] have been looking at something look last
[2:27] the last few weeks and
[2:32] won't start up a little a little
[2:35] different this morning and so they don't
[2:38] have a whole lot of time so
[2:42] so a couple little stories don't tell
[2:44] you and
[2:48] need low class participation this
[2:51] morning so if you've heard these stories
[2:53] before please don't answer when we live
[2:55] into somebody that's not heard the
[2:57] stories and let them answer okay
[3:01] this gentleman goes jogging from home he
[3:05] jogs a
[3:07] piece and then he makes a left and he
[3:10] goes so forward he makes another left
[3:13] and he keeps going
[3:14] he makes another turn and as he's
[3:18] approached at home he sees two masked
[3:20] men waiting for tea so
[3:24] from from my little story well sir I
[3:27] told you got two questions for you
[3:29] number one who were the two masked men
[3:32] and number one why did he go jogging
[3:34] from home
[3:38] go jogging from home
[3:42] anybody have any ideas I don't
[3:51] well they don't have the picture so
[3:54] you're you're lacking on that the two
[3:57] the two masked men want to tell you who
[3:59] they are y'all understand the two masked
[4:01] man is the catcher and the umpire
[4:06] so why did he go jogging from home
[4:09] obviously he hit a home run
[4:12] and won and so my story illustrates our
[4:18] thinking right the others the other love
[4:22] story is I had a psychology teacher
[4:25] asked us one time said if you think
[4:26] somebody comes staggering in the room
[4:28] drooling and
[4:30] babbling incoherently
[4:32] and grinning walks up taken
[4:36] that's the week's on the leg and just
[4:39] drilling and babbling incoherently and
[4:41] then crawls under the table legs in the
[4:44] floor what would y'all do I tell him I'm
[4:46] already married
[4:48] say everybody everybody would be saying
[4:51] they'd be saying espera laid and Rabab
[4:54] from because they're Canadians we're
[4:56] leaving and go had to listen yeah I say
[4:59] everybody's got a lot everybody's got a
[5:00] thought in their month well what if I
[5:02] told you if it was a talking
[5:05] say automatically your mind puts us in a
[5:08] place that we're thinking it away and
[5:11] Paul says here that we're supposed to
[5:14] cast down imaginations and bring into
[5:16] our thoughts into captivity under the
[5:19] Word of God right because see are when
[5:23] we don't see things clearly as Paul said
[5:26] you know what we see we only see parked
[5:28] if we don't see things clearly then are
[5:31] we our imagination automatically goes to
[5:34] work sure and if tries to fill in the
[5:36] gaps
[5:37] the problem is is that puts this
[5:40] contrary to the world sometimes
[5:43] and the other thing
[5:48] you know brother branham said that
[5:52] the right mental attitude
[5:55] towards a baby promise of God will bring
[5:57] it to pass
[5:58] do you know what the word attitude means
[6:07] attitude the definition of attitude is a
[6:11] pattern of thinking is a pattern of our
[6:15] feelings
[6:16] the way we think
[6:19] you know that's you know I always talk
[6:22] about kids they say you know kids don't
[6:25] learn to be to be hate you know to hate
[6:28] or to be mean that's something that's
[6:30] learned right and you know there's a lot
[6:32] of kids in this world you know they
[6:33] don't know
[6:35] the difference in people
[6:39] you know they just look because you know
[6:42] that's just like you meet kids and see
[6:44] kids in the store don't know him from
[6:45] anybody but you know they just get
[6:47] together and they have a good time and
[6:49] they you know they just fellowship a
[6:51] half and but you know a lot of people's
[6:54] like well you know this person you know
[6:56] they're black or this person is from
[6:59] another country or they have a different
[7:02] religion for they you know whatever it
[7:04] is that they draw their lines through
[7:06] and you know then they they learn that
[7:09] and they're conditioned that way and so
[7:12] it's always well I have you know we
[7:14] don't fellowship with these people
[7:16] it's all that's a condition is something
[7:19] that's learned yeah
[7:21] and you know
[7:23] many times we we see you know that's as
[7:28] brother branham said he was told by two
[7:31] people drawing outside their circles
[7:34] and he said well I saw Ronnie said I'll
[7:36] draw you back in they said I'm just
[7:39] drawing my circle speaker you know
[7:41] because you know if that was a story
[7:44] that brother Perry Greene always told
[7:46] about brother Branham and
[7:48] when he was in really great had the
[7:51] church in Beaumont Texas was pastoring
[7:53] the church down there brother great
[7:55] brother branham never would go by the
[7:56] greens church and preach but he'd always
[7:59] go to another brothers church and preach
[8:01] there and brother green asks brother
[8:03] brown one day he said brother brown a
[8:05] piece and wanted to you always when you
[8:07] come to you never come to my church he
[8:09] said you'll go to this other brothers
[8:11] Church he said it's very simple brother
[8:14] Perry he said I know if I go to your
[8:17] church that church over there and that
[8:19] brother won't come to your church but he
[8:21] said I know if I go to his church y'all
[8:23] will come
[8:26] and so you know it's just you know it's
[8:29] them
[8:30] drawing the circle beard because that's
[8:32] the way that brother Brandon was able to
[8:34] spread the message you know because he
[8:36] and it takes wisdom sometimes because
[8:39] our thoughts and our our feelings our
[8:42] attitude we don't want to do certain
[8:44] things we don't want to go certain
[8:45] places we don't we don't want to be
[8:47] around certain people and that's the
[8:49] nets are because that's our absolute
[8:51] that's our thoughts that's our feelings
[8:54] and you know some thousand yes none
[8:57] there's not the way that God wants us to
[8:59] be what God wants us to do because you
[9:01] know we are to be the
[9:04] God representative to the world
[9:08] and many times you know
[9:12] God wants us to be a shining light to
[9:16] everybody and sometimes sometimes the
[9:19] people God wants us to talk to his
[9:20] people we don't talk to it yeah you know
[9:23] it's it's though you know it's the
[9:25] people that you know I have an aunt
[9:28] and she's no long to glory my mom's old
[9:32] his sister
[9:34] and you know I remember as a kid you
[9:37] know she didn't have anything to do with
[9:38] this message my grandmother used tried
[9:40] to talk to her about it and you know
[9:42] that was the last thing in the world she
[9:43] wanted to hear about was this message
[9:47] and you know she's like mom don't talk
[9:49] to me about it though and you don't have
[9:51] this thought in my mind I thought Lord
[9:53] if you save her you save me anybody
[9:56] you know I just had this thought you
[9:58] know and I thought man you and you know
[10:01] somebody because I'm sure we all over
[10:04] for me or somebody in our life that you
[10:06] try to share the gospel with and they
[10:09] are the ones that are most adamant most
[10:11] against it
[10:13] they're the ones that push against it
[10:16] brilliance at the most but you know they
[10:18] come and my aunt sloth and
[10:22] her daughters were going to a
[10:24] denominational Church and you know
[10:28] she was praying one day and she said you
[10:32] know what is right God can you show me
[10:35] what's right
[10:36] she said because is it is that what
[10:39] these people say is is the truth or is
[10:41] it what my mom's been telling me all
[10:43] these years to be true
[10:45] and when she sat down and wanted God to
[10:49] show her what that what the truth of the
[10:51] Bible was what the truth of the word was
[10:54] then God began to show her and she
[10:59] accepted the message and become a
[11:00] believer
[11:02] but you know she had to come to a place
[11:05] after all because she had it in her mind
[11:07] you know how things were going to be
[11:11] but we do have to come to a place and
[11:14] put all that aside and you know I told
[11:16] her before she passed one time and I
[11:19] told her yeah I said you know I said
[11:21] I've told many people I said that if God
[11:25] could say you'd say anybody thanks a lot
[11:30] but you know we get that in our mind and
[11:32] we think it's impossible yeah
[11:35] but you know thing is is it's not
[11:37] impossible with God
[11:40] you know sometimes we we look at
[11:43] situations and we wonder why things are
[11:45] the way they are and makes them the
[11:47] situations are are really bad and then
[11:51] continue to get worse but you know
[11:53] Walker maybe sometimes that's what God's
[11:55] won't listen you realize that you know
[11:57] these situations are getting to the
[11:59] place where they need to be yeah you
[12:02] know sometimes we complain about things
[12:03] that the way things happen and why they
[12:06] happen the way they do
[12:08] but you know the the promise in the
[12:10] scripture to me is Romans 8 he
[12:15] said full we know that all things work
[12:18] together for the good to them that love
[12:21] the Lord who are the called according to
[12:24] his purpose
[12:25] how no matter what situation looks like
[12:28] some that's what I look back to because
[12:30] it always works out it doesn't matter
[12:32] how bad how good work it all works out
[12:36] you know
[12:39] you know I've taken many Falls in my
[12:42] life and doesn't love a lot of things
[12:44] that
[12:45] went too smart but
[12:48] you know
[12:49] July the 29th of this year
[12:52] doing something I've done thousands of
[12:55] times
[12:56] stepping off of Leo and
[12:59] falling two feet
[13:01] and brink available I never expected
[13:04] that to happen not in a million years I
[13:06] fall them further than that yet the
[13:07] ground I never got hurt
[13:11] and you know you get you know
[13:15] you changes your whole life everything
[13:18] that you do and you know why why am i
[13:22] what you know crippled one arm did but
[13:26] you know one thing it teaches you it
[13:29] teaches you patience
[13:31] and you know it's a trial of your faith
[13:37] and you know what I've seen God work yes
[13:41] because you know they they told me I'd
[13:44] be a lot you know I'd have a lot more
[13:46] therapy and a lot more problems and you
[13:49] know it's bad when you go in you know
[13:50] like I've said many times when you go in
[13:52] and you see the surgeon and he looks at
[13:55] your CT scan the first thing he does is
[13:57] go
[13:59] look what does that mean he said oh it's
[14:02] bad
[14:03] he's an eight to his bed when you come
[14:06] out of surgery and he tells you that it
[14:09] was actually worse when he got in there
[14:10] than he what he felt
[14:15] but you know I've got my physical
[14:17] therapist told me that you know she's
[14:19] got a patient that broke her elbow and
[14:22] she's been at it longer and she doesn't
[14:25] have as much flexibility than I do
[14:30] and you know thank the Lord I'm up to 15
[14:34] pounds now actually um I actually have
[14:37] more than that but that's what the
[14:38] doctors got me lifting at work so I can
[14:41] actually 15 pounds so so I'm not moving
[14:44] up slightly but you don't
[14:46] it's you know sometimes I sit around and
[14:49] you know the devil will play in your my
[14:51] shirt and you you wonder it's like
[14:55] someone to your life has changed
[14:58] but you know what the promise of God is
[15:01] all things work together for me
[15:06] even one of the things I've been able to
[15:07] testify us because the doctor has been
[15:10] amazed at how well I've did and the
[15:13] physical therapist has been and I've
[15:15] been able to testify about that well
[15:17] because God is good and he's a healer
[15:20] but you know what he'd never prompt they
[15:22] never promised us that we would have
[15:23] problems and trials and heartaches but
[15:27] you know what he always told us that
[15:28] he'd make a way and we come through
[15:30] those
[15:32] and you know what we sometimes the devil
[15:35] to get in our mind and we let him get in
[15:37] our mind and feed us bunch of lives that
[15:40] are not true
[15:43] but you know if we actually believe what
[15:46] God says you know the Bible's already
[15:49] over before it ever been him there they
[15:53] actually they've actually want to
[15:54] believe that
[15:56] and you know there's there's some more
[15:58] things that I didn't I didn't bring them
[16:00] today but there's some neat little
[16:02] things that I'm willing to look at and
[16:04] maybe next Sunday we'll we'll get into
[16:07] some level but you know it's it's pretty
[16:09] amazing what God has given to us and
[16:13] just a little share a little thought we
[16:16] need before we get done and
[16:20] wait didn't think I could do it but you
[16:22] know it's not been that long and I think
[16:23] we get through
[16:26] so he had said much to this morning do
[16:30] you think I could make I could do it
[16:31] short I didn't give the world peace
[16:33] first
[16:37] which others uh there's a Pope brother
[16:39] Brent talks about you and you know he
[16:42] says that you know man was not not made
[16:45] to lie and that's the reason they use a
[16:47] lie detector they can say it because
[16:50] when you tell a lie though I actually
[16:53] changes your body it hasn't a negative
[16:56] effect in your body and that's what a
[16:57] lot of attacker picks up your heart
[16:59] breaks your breathing you changes you
[17:04] it affects you negatively
[17:06] and he said they took over took a
[17:10] ammeter of some sort and
[17:14] this lady was pregnant and when she was
[17:19] praying they hooked her up to this
[17:20] machine and brother Brent says I can't
[17:22] tell how many kilowatts it was or
[17:25] whatever but he said while she was
[17:27] training he said she hadn't she created
[17:30] enough energy enough power in her prayer
[17:32] while she was pregnant they said you
[17:34] could have sent a radio signal around
[17:36] the world 455 pounds
[17:38] he said that scientific
[17:41] and you know this will the reason I got
[17:44] on this suddenly what was going I was
[17:45] reading that do you know what hit me it
[17:47] was like wow that's amazing but you know
[17:50] the first thing comes in our mind well
[17:52] that was her
[17:55] and that's what struck me you know it's
[17:58] our thought is well that was her
[18:01] but you know what it likes if the power
[18:04] of God is if the life of God lives
[18:06] inside of it one person can do it if
[18:09] it's ever been done one time then
[18:11] anybody can do it
[18:14] it's it because he's not a respecter of
[18:17] persons
[18:19] and if we can see the power that it
[18:24] because you know we go back to the
[18:26] scripture and we look at all those all
[18:27] the things that that's taking place in
[18:29] the scripture
[18:30] you know if it's if our attitude is what
[18:34] controls this if our thinking is what
[18:36] controls this if it's been done once
[18:39] then it can be done again
[18:41] and at least it lays before us it's it's
[18:45] a horse yes
[18:48] and many times we think well
[18:51] that's for somebody you know sometimes
[18:55] God wants us realize that's us amen
[18:57] we're the ones that are quick to do that
[18:59] you know go back through the scripture
[19:02] and you know I
[19:06] think it was a no maybe y'all correct me
[19:09] wrong but thing was Elijah
[19:12] he outrun the chariots
[19:15] and you know some of the some of the
[19:17] amazing things have taken place in the
[19:19] scripture when we think wow you know but
[19:22] you know what if we ever had me Joshua
[19:25] token you'll call for the Sun to stand
[19:27] steel and all those different things and
[19:31] we think well that was for them but you
[19:33] know that we could do the same thing for
[19:35] the Browns from the storm out of
[19:36] existence they're saying open the of
[19:39] them hard so running yeah god bless you
[19:41] all this morning
[19:45] [Music]
