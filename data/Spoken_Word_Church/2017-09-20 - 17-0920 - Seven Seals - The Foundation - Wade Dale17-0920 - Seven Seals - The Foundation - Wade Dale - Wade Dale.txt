========================================

to say I want to say to see you hi shining in the light of your glory pour out your man everybody turn around shake hands or somebody's they god bless you god bless you god bless you brother god bless you brother rich for drummers bless you don't stack don't stick me with him things bless you hey somebody good me in the house of Lord hey man good to be here middle of the week where's Bob Bob drop preacher we'll get rid of him we'll get rid of him guess oh here he comes with it now good man you're the man come on what's your face red for all you know bring me some water late but you got it here hey man good to be here hey man good to serve the Lord good to have a place to go to in the middle of the week hey man get some get some refueling if you got your Bibles let's turn now while we're standing to the Book of Revelations chapter 10 tonight we're going to begin our study on the seals but we're going to not get to them for a while we're going to make a foundation we've been talking on it downstairs and I believe the Lord showed us something a couple weeks ago that may help us all because there's many schools of thoughts the seals open or the closed door they dance or they made the seven thunders the voice of seven men they've made the seven thunders polygamy they made the seven thunders this but remember it's got to compare with every scripture in the Bible it's got to compare with every scripture in the Bible can't be something extra written I was reading the quote just a few minutes ago where they told brother Branham boy brother branham you know you could rock that 23rd chapter revelations with the revelation you have you know and he said good he said but you can't add one word or you can't take one word away he said they were trying to trap me it wasn't them it was Satan inside of him trying wasn't a man trying to do it it was a it was the devil inside of them so we still believe in Devils right yeah we brought a couple with us today so we're gonna try to get rid of them trying to kill them all so in these seven seals we're going to tonight we're going to look at a foundation so we'll start with the foundation of the seven seals and we'll read it from revelations 10 and I want to like I said I want to stay on it for a little while I really enjoyed what brother William brought Sunday and I really enjoyed because we're going to get into it in just a minute we're in Daniel he said that you know that I was thinking when he was preaching when he preached on that comma that was 2000 years that comma income past 2,000 years that's the eternal Word of God every period encompasses a certain amount of time they ever come they ever whatever you want to call it in compassed same thing with Daniel Daniel was told to shut up the book 2600 years ago right and the Bible says the wise shall understand and that's today so you got a 2,600 year gap in just a few little words so thank God for the eternal Word of God thank God for the fivefold ministry hey man cuz we would not know these things and like I said we're gonna if you think that the seals are closed and yeah they are if you think they are they are if you think they're open they're open hey man good enough for me cuz if if you don't believe then you become an unbeliever and unbelievers cannot see the Seventh Seal it's not to the unbeliever all right it's only to a special group of people and I think we have been fortunate highly blessed and favoured to to have it being preached to us from the long time ago to now so thank God for that and and Christine is about to get finished with the book and when she does I'm gonna proofread a little bit and then we'll have all of brother Dale 60 sermons on paper so we'll be able to study it and read it just like just like we do I'm not trying to add to nothing to take away but I promise you one thing it'll bless your soul won't bless your heart it bless your soul amen and it's a good foundation to from whence everything comes from that's why I wanted to talk about tonight is basically the foundation that we're looking at because like I said before people in the message you know they think well brother Brant preached the seals and that's it well why are we still here 54 years after the Prophet now listen up don't get me wrong supposedly opened up the Seventh Seal if they're open that was the mystery of redemption that was a remember ba de change that was the rapture that was the capstone coming down 54 years we little slow but you know what gotten you this that's why I told brother Branham to tell the people on that and you heard it on the questions and answers he said it's not even for you it's not even for that group of people and I'll read here also where brother Branham we like to read the quote about the two things that the Matthew ky4 person is supposed to do but we don't read the next chapter we're gonna read the next we're gonna read the next not chapter but your next few sentences we're brother and says only for a certain group of people so let's revelations 10 verse 1 you pray because I have been you pray that the Lord will will give us something we talked about a little bit downstairs and we're still we're on the sixth seal downstairs but I told them we'd try to start doing it again up here but we'll do it maybe a little bit slower so let's bow our heads and and give honor to the Lord dear Jesus we pray today Lord that you will absolutely be the one that speaks your here the same as you were the night that the Prophet broke those seals you have not changed we are not prophets but we are prophetic people we are people who the words come to we are the people that have the listening ears are the receptor to be able to receive revelation to receive supernatural revelation that comes straight from you Satan cannot touch this he is not in this he has nothing to do he can only beat our flesh he can only try to turn us against things but Father in the name of Jesus Christ we rebuked that devil that he'll try to do anything now but we pray that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that that will not happen that we'll be able to flow through this and Lord everything will be done for your honor and glory we pray that you would heal the sick save the Lost give those brothers in the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor Lord probably give us today our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven now as I'm reading this I'm not gonna do so much backgrounding on this one scripture because you should know that when I said mighty angel what are you gonna think when I say mighty angel you're gonna say Christ okay all right and I thought this is a teaching this I told him I'm not gonna move around a lot tonight and I saw another mighty angel brother branham said only Christ it could be all right so that's Christ coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud would go back to revelations 1 and find all these characteristics of this mighty angel because look how it's hidden in the Bible it's a lowercase a the angel of the Covenant was always a little capital hey but that God hid that he hid that from the wise and prudent only a prophet could say well that says another mighty angel that could just be anybody know read the characteristics write the characteristics tells you exactly who that is which is Christ all right rainbow upon his head in his face was that where the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now watch this right here and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write a joy I was about to write something he was not hesitant to write it in other words it wasn't a mystery to him he saw what he saw him was getting ready to write it down in other words it wasn't so mysterious that he said walk I can't write that no he was getting ready to write it down so it must be something real simple where everybody's made of something so mysterious alright and when the seven thunders had other the voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things all right now the seven seals have been open but here says seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered got it and write them not all right and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein and the earth and the things that therein and the sea and the things that are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and I we don't we're going to dwell on this so you can go and be seated as he hath declared to his servants the prophets not one remember every prophet every prophet look back to the previous prophet to see what they say it a man so this seventh angel messenger has got to look back all the way from Moses all the way down to John standing there right now and he had to compare every scripture that's what the Bible says as he hath declared to his servants the prophets plural and then they built on each other remember the the Old Testament prophets built the body of Jesus Christ we're built on the foundation of what the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone amen so I had to compare with every prophet so that's great whatever this great mystery is mystery of God that should be finished had to be declared by every prophet every prophet had their revelation mystery Moses was not to build an ark Noah's was to build an ark Moses was to deliver a group of people Jeremiah was to write down that 70 years you're going to be in captivity and all these other things and he was the one that wrote it and then Daniel was what brother Brown said Daniel look back and read what Jeremiah said knew that it was going to be 70 years he was in the 68th year and he was getting ready to come out so he must have believed what the Prophet said now what did Paul do Paul comes in the New Testament and he doesn't he has no he has no writings of Jesus he has no Matthew Mark Luke and John he only has the Old Testament Scrolls which is what the Old Testament prophets he takes to Revelation from that and writes the New Testament and then so we have to look at the prophets previous and the prophets prior bring them all together that the one mystery of God should be finished now let me ask you a question what do all prophets have in common there's one thing that the whole Bible has in common Redemption Redemption all of them sure now remember when a prophet hits the earth what does he do he declares a war on what the people that turn him down but he brings grace to the ones that accept it and then he brings grace to a group of people he brings judgment to a group of people Jeremiah Ezekiel all the ones are saying Israel if you'll do this if you'll do this but if you don't do this this is what's going to happen all right so we take the things that the prophets said prior and we look at them and we use them because it all is in either redemption of us or Israel the only two groups of people in the Bible Gentiles Gentiles and Jews all right Gentiles this nation's Jews is we know who that is in the Old Testament and moving up into the New Testament and so those are only two people so the so the prophets what they either declare warning judgment or they declare what like Elijah I told you when I was preaching up the five comings of Elijah Elijah was judgment to Jezebel but he was a savior to the little widow woman and man she accepted his message and Jezebel turned it down well what look what she got and look what the widow woman God same way with you and I we come to the end time to this message of the hour and if you totally turn this message down knowing what we know now I don't know it's just gonna be rough and then because what it's the great it's the greatest buts the most simple it's gotta be simple God in simplicity is the first thing that the Prophet to God preached all right so now let's look at something here real quick Ephesians 4 verse 29 through 32 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearer and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption all right you're sealed unto the day of your redemption all right and remember when you're sealed you're sealed with what that Holy Spirit of promise so there's only really one seal and that's the whole ego amen but we're going to talk about though but you say that and now you've got a you've got to put all the revelations and all the what the prophets say you've got to put every bit of that in there amen alright because what it is what is the Holy Ghost that's your Redemption that's your Redemption God redeems you by giving you the Holy Ghost and then but he's not finished with that remember being born again being born again right by the incorruptible Word of God Paul says I died daily you're sealed until the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath I like to read the rest of in wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you amen now I want to ask you a couple of things before we get stuff well let's go and read first quote now this is all familiar to us but I'm gonna keep reading it because brother Branham he emphasizes this in the Laodicean Church days so now this messenger amount come forward but now remember we stop right here we quote it to here but watch I want to sell on the show don't roll it down here but I want you to show you what he said right into that quote now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi four and he would turn the hearts of the children to the father's now he's going to what turn the hearts of the babbling Pentecostal babies back to the Pentecostal fathers of the original Amen that's the son of God revelation that's what God built the church on told John I mean told Peter upon this rock I'll build my church a revelation of those founding fathers and I was telling them back there in the back of minute ago that brother Dale is exactly correct when when he makes the quote that brother Brown said they were closer to the rapture in the first age why because they didn't have any denomination they didn't have any false doctrine but they were beginning to have a little bit of false dr. Amen you've fallen away from your first love okay that alright say man so according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children now from 47 to 63 that's just giving you a time element because remember we had fallen away from the one God and the water baptism and all the things that we see I mean thank God thank God listen there's one thing I thank God for is that he sent a prophet to tell me that if I get born again and have the baptism of Holy Ghost in my soul I do not have to stand judgment every denomination will tell you you're gonna stand before that judgment bar one day I know we're gonna be judged for deeds in the body for the good or bad okay but that has nothing to do with my eternal destination my eternal destination is here but thank God that a prophet come to tell us that amen well you know what it was in the Bible and the first church age they had it right it's just that man had eroded the revelation coming down - now - you know I still in somebody the other day we and it's okay and you think well you you're being too but you know it's done say old you know John died and he's walking on the streets to go talking to Jesus well we know he's not we know he's not that's not that's not true but that's what mama told us that's what granny told us right but it's not true it's false if they're born again they're sitting in the sixth dimension waiting on me and you are there in the fifth dimension waiting on something else right and they're not burning in hell boy he went to hell today he's burned it no he's not burn in hell yet but thank God that we've had a prophet come and tell us all these things lined it right up and just so beautiful well see remember that was the that was the faith of the fathers that was written all through the Bible man has the one that took it and made denomination man has took it and made it three gods and made it Trinitarian I mean water baptism father son Holy Ghost like we were coming out the other day man did that the Bible never changed so so the first thing of the Malachi for man we know who it was the spirit of Elijah was to turn everybody back and get us lined up amen brother Brown did not come I know some people had a problem with that this weekend and I really don't care brother Brown didn't come to tell us how to pray how to how to dress how to act right my granny acted right and she didn't know who the brother branham was that was in the Bible how not to cut your hair and wear pants and how that's not the custom be in the barroom that's what the Bible said man has took and what put a sheet over it basically shut the Bible back up so the Prophet didn't bring us a new revelation he brought us clarity I like that word he brought us clarity because you know we bought dad the church did several years ago we bought him a pair but not clear it was like a thousand dollars and man you could see a gnat scratches nose you know off of a deer 200 yards away but do you know what if you don't focus those binoculars if those binoculars are a little bit off you can't see from here to sister Jeanne I don't care how much it cost so if you don't get to focus right if you don't get it we're both glasses are seeing one that's why the Bible says you're I be hot single amen not your ib3 her - and the message is - now to Lourdes and all that other stuff but anyway we're not here to talk about false doctrine alright but remember that's what the first part of brother Brown now remember he there was no cutoff point everybody says well 47 to 63 there's no cut out point but really during that time brother Branham was doing he was doing an act of restoration he was turning us back to the faith that was originally in this church age right here actually the first three ages were basically one God water baptism was right and all the things and then man got into it but there's a second part that he has to do that is related singularly to you and I tonight write us so you can say he's talking to me hey man he's talking to me - he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 now watch what he says which are the revelations contained in there seven seals now we're going to talk about that in a minute something come to me the other day a knife if it ain't right then we got a man sitting here tell me different it will be these devour Julie's it will be ceased to finally revealed mystery truths that literally now priests on that's a while back that word literally is not a type literally means the person it literally turns you back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers exactly so but now watch look who's it for growth it but consider this also this prophet messenger will be in his nature and manners as were elijah and join the people of that know yes you and i of this prophet messengers day will be as they were in Ahab's day and in John's and since it is only the children whose hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen hey man it's only the children I was watching Saturday his brother William was preaching there was some shuck being shook now listen there's nothing wrong with the show the shuck has a part but the shuck pulls away and the real seed shows forth hey man when you start telling people like brother William did that that I guess they figured that that William was talking they're probably gonna figure I'm talking about something that brother Branham didn't bring that that we're going to bring something he didn't have that's totally fault you got that right no they're just blind by that old Pentecostal age that they lived in that look holiness brother Branham was a prophet and we're going into rapture there's nothing wrong with that but you won't take a body change with that you won't take a headstone revelation with that no no you'll go down to the gray and you come up but the whole show they start shaking their head you know those shop starts do that's why it's kosher they shook their self but only the children who will listen right Amen now let's go they read and Daniel like I said I'm gonna take my time but I'm not gonna take a lot of time so Daniel 12:9 says and and he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end now when is that now that's what I said watch this right here many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand now that one scripture in Compass's 2600 years Daniel was written in about BC 538 verse 2020s about almost 2600 years that that scripture had told Daniel to shut it up don't write anything down now remember we're gonna look brother Brown said he heard the thunders Daniel heard the funders amen but he was free bidden to ride here she's seated up why listen God's not gonna do anything unless there's somebody there to understand what he's saying that's like with the Prophet with brother Branham saying you're not getting it it's not for you live a good simple Christian life go on with the same simple message amen and I hope that's what we're continuing to do now amen but it's given to us it's given to us to understand other things I'll read it Sunday the Bible says the deep things of God brother Branham said supernatural things it's what we're supposed to understand amen that's why your eyes looked in that Bible and you read every denominational idea you had right unless you were a Mormon or somebody else that had a different Bible but if you had the same Bible you were looking in that Bible sample there's a Trinity well there's a water baptism father son alright but now what happened did the Bible chain know the one that motivated you changed you changed because what's inside changed and you began to read it what with those binoculars with the focus where you could focus into one so let's try to not be so you know I don't want to we don't want to sound so mysterious because it's really not we come to this part of the endtime it should be more plain I told I told the luison em the other day we were talking about being simple we're talking about simple do you know that there's I think there's 15,000 don't look it up somebody want to google it later how many words there are in the English language there's five hundreds of thousands right it only comes from 26 letters any number that you come up with 64 is a entry and being being being being being comes from 10 let 10 numbers 0 to 9 how simple can you get you've only got 10 numbers and 26 letters in an alphabet that's why I heard the other day when somebody was saying that you know I Pam's brother Dale said you know the guy comes by and heard the blue boy saying his ABC he said I say my ABCs and said God will filter you know he'll put off well that's the truth everything you want to say to God was from A to Z God put it all together so that's what we're trying to do here don't think that this is so mysterious that we can't understand it but I want us to see one thing tonight if we don't see anything else and I'm short in just a minute but now let's read number 2 now this is 1953 a message called faith now watch this is 1953 listen God bless you I want to tell you just one thing I know I'm holding long but I just want this one little thing I know and I want you to remember there's something fixing to happen remember I told you that now this is 10 years before the seals is open right okay there's a step up coming in the church now see these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while progression in Revelation amen something's moving and I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ nobody when the Prophet says that my ears pop up all right Who am I everyone in our doctrine in our baptism we've come to a place but there's some key that will unlock something here now he saw the book sealed on seven seals and when the Daniel saw the same and when the thunders uttered their voices he said don't write what that was in the scripture but it be revealed in the last day we're at the time we're at kadish right now amen and I want to kind of interject a little something in here I know a lot of you how many of you heard that the denominational world says the rapture is gonna take place on September the 23rd there's big articles about it what's happened is Virgo is in line with Leo and there's 12 stars over the Virgin's head now listen if it's telling them backs their backs back there now if I was the denominational person I'd be worried because they did line up the way they're supposed to never had before all right they've lined up and they've lined up under the first day of the Feast of Trumpets in Israel so buddy that but look just like brother Ram said something's happening but it's not happening to just the Stars it's happening to you and I first it's got to happen to you and I first there's something stepping up coming into church now some things are moving the reason it's moving because I'm gonna tell you something September 23rd we will not have a rapture that's a the Lord goes no man knows the day are the hour we might know the week of the box but not the day nor the hour the denominational world listen without a prophet to tell us what that virgin was with the Sun or the moon over ahead and the Stars and all that brother Branham explained all that so see to me what it does it settles me these revelations did I receive and you receive should settle you the problem is is we have too many questions and questions are unsettling amen that's the reason the dark is real hard to get over the fear of darkness why coach can't see but the same thing in the daylight you can stand and look at the same thing in a daylight and not be scared but in the dark you see shadows you see stuff moving you ought to go deer hunting sometime and get there before dark I mean before daylight trees start walking through the wood and Momma shoots them I promise you you in her defense you can look at something long enough and it'll move I saw it dearie the other day at brother Donnie's I was delivering mail and right down below his house and we see deer there all the time and right down below his house and this this where the wind had blow it everything off they was just and it looked just like a deer laying on the side of the road till I got close to it it was a limb with a bunch of leaves on it okay that's what I'm telling you about this we're looking right at something but the Prophet gave us so much clarity all the prophets they gave us so much clarity that we can actually see that and say that's not a deer are that's a false teaching or that's not there so this is not lined up it's like William said this weekend he said and I told him excuse me told him the other day you can have a beautiful picture the cow the grass and the tree but if the cows in the top of the tree that picture is worthless right except if you're a Picasso maybe you know where you got a eyeball over here and anyway it's trying to be funny but anyway um thank you Julie but when you got the cow but you've got all your players though you've got the cow you've got grass for it to eat and a tree for it to stand under but if you got the caliph in the tree it's totally wrong so that's our problem we've had it where now we're trying now we're getting the picture right I believe we're getting that picture down to what we see clarity to where we can when we come in and open our Bible or when we read the prophets message we don't have that many question at least I don't and I'm hoping that we can convey it to you that you don't because it does me no good to just that I understand it I want you to understand that amen I always pray before I leave this any office I look raise my hand and say Garden do whatever you want to with me during this service but may the people see you may the people understand you and not me and don't worry about me I've stood with headaches and all kind of stuff but and the devil you know what the devil will play with your brain I don't care if you're still preaching hey all the preachers say man hey man that's right you be praying for somebody enough fall to come in your mind just as horrible as it can be why because you live in those those two lives are still there the devil can still enter your brain we're human I mean that's just the way it is - anyway this September 23rd thing don't worry about it there's a step up coming in the church now why because the people are getting ready the people are seeing something amen I at least I am but I want you to that's why I want to go into this and and try to lay the foundation because I was listening to them people talking about the the hurricanes over in the Puerto Rico in places where they have to drill down so many hundreds of feet before they hit torille because if you don't hey if you build a 50-story building or a hundred storey building and that thing sinks this far the whole building topple over they got to get down to a solid foundation and then you start building your building we all know that building anything you got to have a solid foundation so maybe we have a I hope we have a solid foundation man number three let's go to it this is the ephesian church age 1960 1205 as Daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden so now let me let me stop here Daniel heard the seven thunders I'm not worried about the hearing or the seeing Daniel got something come to him the same thing come to John and it didn't scare him are you getting my point John didn't get scared to see it Daniel getting it so it must be something they were familiar with because the the the Lord had to step on the scene in both instances and tell him to seal it up must have been important but it wasn't for that group of people it was for this group of people as Daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden and John heard the voices and this book was sealed listen now what explain something to you real quick I was over in the Philippines a couple years ago and hopefully we're going back but they have a doctrine of 14 seals now if you're reading revelations 5 you read it says on well we can read it but we won't read it we're going to read next Sunday anyway they have a base 14 seals which is seven that brother branham free and then obviously it's gonna be seven that whoever this person that came up with that doctrine is gonna preach and you don't know what its gonna be and I heard some of it and it ain't in the Bible okay so it's their only revelation now brother Brown dimensions that many many times before the seals break listen to me before the seals break he mentions being sealed to in the book and on the backside of the book all right right because I'm going to read it to you right here had seven seals one time he said attached to the back of the book but now when he come to the revelation of those seals and that first seal broke he never mentioned that again because he knew there was only seven seals and then now there's mysteries hidden underneath that we'll look at in just a second but it's not seven more seals to be open because it you run out of your types and everything there's seven seals that's it all right but listen to what he says but I want you to get something I'm gonna show you something in a minute and there's Daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden John heard the voices and this book was sealing that look and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of those seals to be open the mystery of God will be finished no this is 1960 in the church's book in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would be revealed and when that was completely revealed now look when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open to the church now look God being known this church 19:3 but he's one it's not a mystery that's not written in the book he's not talking about that he's not there's one God from beginning to end in this book okay and it's open because the first Church age people saw it all right the mystery will be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open to the church look because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and among us living among us and we're then worshiping the Living Christ that's among us all right so he's showing where he was no watch number four 1961 revelations chapter five this is when he preaches the singular messages all right now we turn quickly because I know there's a baptism of service what is this seventh seal book oh what a great thing did you notice how it says here it was seven seals on the back of the book now if I'm reading the quote it's something Oh may God help us now and give us courage and maybe sooner or later I can get to you get it to you look this is not written in the word it's sealed on the back of the word the book was sealed by these seven seals the whole mystery of the book sealed up in the seventh seal still there you straighten it out right there the whole mystery is revealed in seven seals but now you got to watch hold on this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of Revelation all right which is what I saw on the right hand of him that said upon the throne a book written within and inside written that's what we're reading this morning the backside sealed with seven seals that's Revelations five outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't even say it's sealed in here with seven seals the mysteries of God now look look at me my quote it's sealed in here with seven seals you hear what it's saying right now what is it now notice a seal represents a finished product something that has been already tested proven and then sealed where is we have the earnest of our salvation now by being sealed with the Holy Spirit that is the earnest of our salvation everybody got that say Amen that's our earnest of our salvation but now remember he goes back to the boxcar remember he goes back to the boxcar now listen here's what we're going to get a little testy or are you going to enjoy it one of the things that boxcar is sealed but that doesn't mean the seal is the only thing actually it's not the most important thing what's in the boxcar it's the most important thing what sealed up it's the most important thing because this thing doesn't cost but look if this thing is not if it's broke then you do have a problem so the seat so you know not throwing the seals out but there's two things we're working on here the steel that's put on the box and what's in the box it means that all right say man that's what to me that's the important because it might be that seal may not cost you 25 cents but what's inside that box car may be million and millions of dollars and if it's not put in there correctly amen that's why brother Graham said God won't sell you until you I'm gonna paraphrase until you go through justification until you go through sanctification until you go through the baptism of Holy Ghost and then God accepts your faith then he what seals you until the day of your Redemption are unto the day of your arrival we haven't arrived yet people we're getting there but our arrival there's the body change why it flips people switch when I say look I'm not looking for a rapture sorry bored I don't particularly enjoy that song I'll see you in the rapture because that is a event way out under I'm gonna see them right here this is where I'm gonna see them and then we're gonna go in a rapture like brother Dale said you know I hear my theophany calling me while I do that Great King theophany is calling me but I got a theophany right here that is eternal amen when I die hallelujah by and by well that guy died that wrote that song but that's gonna be a people that's not gonna die the older ones got excited about that and the younger ones didn't wonder how that happens but anyway so the seal but remember the seal sealed something follow me here now because I'm going to give you an example and I'll hope it will it'll help you because many people say that when brother branham open the seals that was it I thought it was a divine reveal mystery truths were hidden under or behind those seals that's the Thunder that's the part that's gonna get us out of here knowing that the wild horse riders Antichrist is not taking us anywhere because for 54 years we've been saying that hey man sorry that mean - but I'm telling you people are so narrow-minded like I read I'm gonna read that quote I'll bring next Sunday brother Graham said people so narrow-minded you could take a lead pencil put it between their eyes and they'd blind them now your prophet said that you know how narrow that is but how narrow-minded just say that brother I'm just open them and I said there's a mystery there's there there's a revelation there's got to come with that and with that revelation comes a power to get us out of here that's our goal our goal is to get the dead out of the ground change our bodies and then we go in the rapture that's what I'm looking for the voice of the resurrection and I believe the prophet of God said is seeing you now problem is is we have one big old question mark because so-and-so is dying and so-and-so died and so on so there's no they didn't die if they're born again they do more alive now than they ever have been hey man the dead in Christ shall rise first if you're not dead in Christ tonight you will not rise don't wait to be dead in Christ then there's no way you'd be dead in Christ and be a dead person no you got to be dead here we buried seven people like Sunday hey man all right so they're dead if they go on and get them new birth or if they already got the new birth they're dead and Christ and if they pass on their rise first that all right amen where was that number five let's read it real quick I don't want to be much past about 8:30 get y'all out of here and the strong angel with a loud ball I'm sorry revelation chapter 5 this was preached on 611 61 Jefferson Bell who is worthy who is able to do this I'm on the rock yeah okay and then the elder said don't wait for the line of the tribe of Judah he is worthy and he has overcome and he took the book and opened the book and loose the seals thereof he never told what happened to them he just loosed them right when we hit them seven seals being open right down through the Bible servants the prophets right amen we're gonna see that we're gonna see how that they all had something to do with the open of these seals a man because this is a complete plan of redemption you can't leave a prophet out no prophet watch when we hit them seven seals being opened right down through the Bible watch what took place right in this seven sealed book that we're into enter now holds the whole mystery of all the redemption blessings of God brother wait I thought that revealed the devil please people please what we'll talk about in a minute remember here's the lamb he's the only one that redeeming you know why cuz it's his book you can't redeem it he's the only one that can redeem it hey man number six revelation of Jesus Christ is preached on six eighteen nineteen sixty-one I've tried to put them in chronological order showing how that he he'd come up toward the opening of the seals and how his his revelation progressed and getting down to the last verse of this scripture portion up here a part of the scripture we will bring in the seventy weeks of Daniel and the last three weeks tied in with the Pentecostal Jubilee that brings in the people to the last seal then be sitting ready for the lamb to open the seals now we know we've been through Daniel 70 weeks and we know for a fact that if we didn't get the right revelation of Daniel 70 weeks that it's not three and a half years that it's seven years after the rapture of the church you couldn't put it in in the seventh seal brother Brown said that he said you can't get it lined up and you can't get it lined up without the true revelation of those seventh of the Daniel 70 weeks mmm that was wonderful how did that the Lord showed us to do that in a in a Jewish way because it's a Jewish it's to Daniel and his people right there was to Daniel in his people so when we started putting the feast days in and start watch that all come together man it was just karbolyn number six revelation I read okay and remember the seals are a mysterious thing the book was sealed and it was on the back now watch here's we said at seven seals that was not even revealed in the book these things are not even written in the Bible now I want to point something to you it's got to compare with every Scripture in the Bible so now let's get the point right here stop right here it's gonna do it in a minute but let's do it right now Thunder number one is not written in a scripture a scripture like the seven seals the seven seals are written in a scripture revelation 6:1 says and when an angel won't one of the seals revelation 6 2 or 3 says when the angel opens second seal there is no scripture that says thunder one open thunder to open okay is that all right that's what he's talking about cuz look I was telling them back in the back seven seals have been preached twice actually thank you Lord three times Daniel 9 the six fold purpose is exactly the opening of the seals to the Jews it's the seal of redemption how they got redeemed is the six fold purpose then Jesus preached them in Matthew 24 and then William Branham preached them in 1963 so this is nothing new nothing new but watch I want you to see something maybe it'll help you right here in just a minute these things were not even written in the Bible so he's not saying that there's something outside see that's where they got they thought he was saying it was something written outside no it's just not something thunder one is thunder two is that's what John was told not to write when those thunders open there under their voices John was getting ready to write it down God said seal it up till the time of the end all right now look but if anybody would give an interpretation of it it would have to compare with the rest of the Bible Oh I'm sure you're going to get a blessing out of this or I think you will I'm trusting you with all right so the seven seals are written in the Bible Matthew 24 revelation 6 and Daniel 9 about 26 or 25 what's that all right written down what they are when they are open when revelation 6:1 not exactly the day but the revelation 6:1 seven said come and see and said when the first Hill opened this happen okay all right that all right everybody say Amen now look number 7 1961 6:18 revelations chapter 5 number 2 as soon as he advertised who is worthy he was advertising the coming of the kinsman redeemer and here he stood a lamb and what did he do walked over to the throne where the Spirit of God was at and took the book out of the right hand the right hand of him that said upon the throne and all the elders fell down and said thou aren't worthy because thou was slain see and then he began became then excuse me his book or at least the book of redemption or the book of intercession in the church age was finished now he becomes the Redeemer now the revealing of how he did it is going to be in those seven seals now we notice in like when the book of the mediatorial work of him was done the work was finished now in the first three chapters of the church finished revelation is one two and three everybody got that revelation is one two and three everybody with me on this and by with me okay all right but now Redemption he doesn't say the devil's to be revealed he said Redemption is to be revealed what is it now when he took this book see that's the people's problem they saw brother Branham open the seven seals and I said I'll prove it to you in just a minute redemption is to be revealed what is it now when he took this book now trying to put on your deep thinking so don't be scared put on your deep thinking cuz we ever get these seven nights you're going to get it now they didn't though he said they didn't get it alright now let's read Gables instructions to Daniel and we'll try to show you something here then we find out Gables instructions Daniel 7:13 1961 we find out that this was sealed with seven seals look and each seal was wrapped around and as the revelation come forth he pulled the seal and undone this read what that seal said and then he undone the next one the scroll and read what that seal said undone the next one it pulled it out and see what that seal said and what the revelation was that's exactly what our seven seals that we're going into shortly we trust that we'll do each seal when it's took off the book will be unrolled and that'll show exactly what taken place that all right say ma'am so now here is our problem in the message brother random open the seals told us that it was the white horse rider was the Antichrist right we didn't take a rapture when he took one yet he saw we're waiting on a date god only knows that day I thought brother Brown said he was waiting on you and I wrapped her time in the adoption series right now remember there was no books back in the Old Testament they were Scrolls you just read we leave this up don't take this off each seal was wrapped around and as a revelation come forth he pulled the seal and undone this and read what that seal said everybody got that say man now look you want to see something tonight this is what I want you to see this is this the seal no this is not the seal this is the seal if you can't see it from back there this is seal says Lamb of God I took it out of analyst Sunday School class look this is not the seal this is a seal brother branham said when the seals will be revealed it'll be the seals we got a revelation of what that sale was what about this come on read your quote in a minute we're brother Branham says the seals is one thing and the thunders is another that's why we took a rapture people because we think this is it we think this is it this is just the beginning this just opens so we can see that you see that see that that's what we're missing we think that's it that's the white horse crop rider was the Antichrist therefore he goes away and then we get what's written under that seal did we not read where brother Branham said what will be the remissed Rees contained in the seven seals the thunders are the mystery containing say it was the seal I'm gonna read you a quote I got a quote where brother Branham said two seals one thing and the thunders a totally different thing hey we got this right brother Branham totally explained what this was the wild horse rider was not the Holy Ghost it was the Antichrist but when it rode away here's your revelation sure that was a revelation but that only got us to this the box seal kept people from seeing what was inside the box car I'm gonna read you right here let's look it's real quick an extra eight verse eight right he also for the Jews as it likened you in the King's name and seal it with the king's ring now look for the writing which was written in the King's name and sealed with the Kings ring may no man reverse now was it the seal that condemned the people or what was written was condemning the people it was this it was just sealed sure this was important because without that you can't see what's inside but that night when those seals were opened brother Bram told us what this was yeah afterwards he told us what this was because remember the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal breaks breaks when it's broke not while I still see when it's broke so you say well you gotta you got something going now watch let's read it now watch when the King sealed it the important part was the riding behind it everybody got that say man all right everybody got that say Amen all right this is the seal this is what seal number one was no this was actually still number two God is king this is the second one I pulled up but you understand what I mean seal one was pulled off and what the the first the first combat beast said come and see and what did the combat be showing the combat beast is not a prophet it's the Holy Ghost we know that but it's not the Prophet to reveal right come and see what this seal is but you gotta remember there's something behind that there's something behind that seal it has to be made known that were literally because this has not turned us back this will turn us back this will turn us home I mean onto a body change hey man listen not saying in people gonna say well now you're saying brother Brown no if it hadn't been for him he broke this thing only a profit only God Himself can show you what this is only God himself look this has already been preached in Matthew 24 and in revelation 6 the problem was we said it was the Holy Ghost the Bible never said it was the holy goat the Bible never said that it was this and that man said that was the whole ego right because brother Branham says we'll read in a minute he said we're only presuming what if he doesn't come what the one that knows all this amen that all right say Amen but see that I believe that will help you the seals are broke this was the revelation of the seal the wild horse riders ran across the second one is the red horse rider and what he did and the black horse rider all that that's what this is but it's not this right it's contained in it's contained in but it's not this that's why we're still here everybody thinks this is it this is not it cuz I promise what I'll tell you right here because remember in 1962 brother Brown preached is this the sign of the answer remember what happened with all that vision and thunder and all the things happening he was kind of he was worried it was the end of the world he was worried it was into him it was where there was a lot of things he was worried about but watch what he says right here says look where the voices was the thunders not in heaven on earth the thunders never uttered from the heavens they uttered from the earth now I want you to think just for a minute how many times how many times have I showed you where brother Branham talks about the book of Redemption right the seven sealed book is a book of redemption not the book of the devil it's exposing the devil it makes him go away it exposes what you thought was previously a revelation right amen but the thunders never utter from heavens they uttered from the earth now remember one thing give me a key the thunders the voice of God when the seal breaks they break down here why don't they break in heaven why why don't they break in heaven it's such a it's just a great mystery why not start up there redemption is not up there read em sit down here there's a key there's a key it's not written in the book people but it's written in every chapter of the Bible only one thing Redemption amen he said we're brother I'm redeemed not until you get a buddy change right right you have the earnest of your inheritance until the purchased possession because you're sealed what to your destination but when you get to that destination is God gonna open your box car and walk in and go where's the stuff where's the goods where's where's the revelation no it's empty we don't want that to happen do we yeah ma'am being silly but it's the truth no look let's read this is this a sign of the end sir they uttered from the earth Nene he reads and I was about to write when I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal capital SCAL seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not it is on the backside when a book is completed not did he say on the front side he said on the backside after it's all done completed then the seven Thunder voices is the only thing that's stuck to the book there's not revealed it's not that it's listen and people will misunderstand me but we're beyond this we're told to go beyond this we're beyond this this has already been preached it's not even written in the book let's go the next one God hiding himself in simplicity and then revealing himself in the same now I don't know what these things mean I'm just as much at the end of my wits to them as perhaps some of you are this morning we have ecclesiastical ideas that's been presented by man but that will never touch it and if you will see it has to come by inspiration it must be God Himself is the only one who can do it the lamb and tonight is that book of redemption of what he preached the night after God and simplicity he preached the breach all right which was the book of redemption so now we're going to read number 11 the breach between the seven churches and seven seals now notice the seven seals holds the mystery didn't say it is the mystery it holds the mystery what does this seal do it holds what's behind it it holds it but when its open its loosed you know what we've done the seven seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those seven seals has sealed in right we're only presuming them things you don't think a prophet knew when he's talking about me what he's talking about now look number 49 let's to save time now notice seven seals on the book has that these seven seals has the book sealed see the book is absolutely sealed do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven seals is broken right it is sealed up with seven seals now that's different from the seven thunders so I prove that that's different he knew it was different that's different from the seven thunders see this is seven seals on the book and the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel sea so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word said the mystery should be finished at that time and this seven seal book remember it was closed here in Revelations five and in Revelations 10 it is open that's why the thunders could what go forth because the book was open then he said John ah don't wreck that all right let's finish what I get to 51 and now we're going to see what that book says about how it became open and it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book the Lambs got to take the book is his anyway in the Lord amen so we've had 54 years the seven seals has been revealed as the seven thunders been revealed that's the question to you but remember I'm gonna read this quote and I'll read it again sunday 1962 is this the time sir they don't have it in the back Matthew 13 verse 11 Jesus told them said the mysteries are for you to know the mysteries of the kingdom are for you to know a member Scofield you know puts them down like 1 through 13 whatever anyway brother branham reason but listen this is quote the mysteries here is the mystery Tama a mystery is Scripture kama is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation despite the revelation there's a supernatural element that goes with this and it's going to take a supernatural people to understand them and it's not gonna be something you can't read you read it every day if you read the Bible every day then all right say man now watch this is in the breach between the church ages and the seals 1963 3:17 alright but then he promises that when that time has finished out there'll be the sounding of the seventh angels voice and then the book will be revealed at that time now don't say nobody them people ain't saved back there but the mysteries that they couldn't understand she was talking about look the shark can't understand weep cuz it's not it grew from the same life of the week but the wheat went right through it out to the end and that shuck was a protector don't kick them out but they won't be ere the seed won't be heir all right now nobody but the mysteries that they couldn't understand how that God can be three and yet one how that the scripture said baptized name Father Son Holy Ghost and turn around say baptized the name of Jesus see old many things how can I eat an apple and cause the wreckage of the whole world see how can these things be but those mysteries are promised to be revealed at the end time it's little loose ends that these great warriors has come on the scene such as Iranians Martin st. Martin public art and the different ones of Luther Wesley and all these see how they have come and just lived long enough to kind of bring a light and shine it but they left many things in the darkness along come the Pentecostal age like the Lutheran age they run out on a limb but still all right don't say they wasn't right they were but there's loosens left that they can that can't be explained but then why the seals hasn't been broke to thoroughly reveal what these things are I want to ask you a question let's stop right here I was telling the guys in the back brother branham said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals right show me one time he preached on marriage and divorce in seal yeah show me brother Ram says surplus he was revealed in seal sure he made a few quotes about serpent seed but he him preached on sir proceedings he'll let me give you a real good one he was getting ready to preach the seven trumpets God told him he supernaturally preached him in the sixth seal I want you to go to that sixth seal and show me but about two quotes about the seven trumpets he said they were supernaturally preached so you can't tell me you've Dana Dana I don't care for message preachers being a message 150-year cannot tell me that everything was broke when the seals broke the seals broke to show what we're seeing now to show one group of people you and I the children that can understand the seals hasn't been broke to thoroughly reveal what these things are see but then in the last age all these mysteries are to be solved and handed out and the seals are to be open by the lamb and reveal to the church and then time is no more how beautiful then the book then is the book of redemption so you can't make this a revelation of the devil this is sure it's revealing or exposing him so you can get the true revelation of this the book of redemption brother Branham many times in the breech calls it the seven sealed book of redemption why keep people get Redemption it's the simplest thing it is to me it's the absolute simplest doctrine that we ever have had its oldest doctrine Jesus said you must be born again oh but it's a higher form it's not just here gotta go on amen we know that but remember I'm staying on the fountain we gotta get a foundation here mm-hmm number thirteen the breach twenty seventh seals in the church ages paragraph 142 and revealed as the seals break and are released to us then we can see what this great plan of the devil is oh sorry then we can see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it's going to be done that tip right there it's all hidden in this book of mystery the seven thunders people is the revelation of supreme Redemption but it was sealed with these little things around here so the man couldn't see the problem is we think this is it this is just the beginning this is to let me and you know that this has been what broke and there's something behind it we thought this was powerful the devil only gets remember our if you'd been downstairs you hear me say revelation six power was given power was given power was given now who gives God power nobody he is the power he gives Satan permitted power but when the power of God comes guess what you get a break amen that all right we're man then when we see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery here it's sealed up with seven seals you see where he separated the two so as the lamb as they don't so the lamb is the only one who can break them and the whole thing here the seven seals got the mysteries of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals then if God willing let him let us pull back those seals look pull back those seals and look down through the book and find out what it's all about oh I hope we have a great time there the mystery of redemption is sealed until this book could not be broken until the last angels message the scrolls there we knowed it was there we know it was redemption we believed it was redemption number fourteen I see the mystery of the seven sealed book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh church 'angels message see the seventh angel begins to sound and there's the mountain boy did he ever D tell him where it was that read that he just told you where it was that look he said now the mystery of the seven C book were revealed at the sounding of the Scimitar today's message see the seventh angel message seventh angel begins the sound and there's the tapes there's the tapes there's the messages wrote out there and we got it in tape and book form he told him he said you got it it's right here study it now at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of God should be finished see at that time now we will notice the book of the mystery of God is not revealed unto the seven angels message is sounded now these points will be important in the seals I'm sure cuz this every bit tie write together now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows that God alone Jesus Christ now but it is a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed at through six church age but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his message he winds up all the loose ends all right so let's go down to the bottom soon save time now you see I'm just not making that up that's the it's thus saith the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh churches the last church age all the loose ends that through these church ages have been proved that will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ that's my brother promising and Christ the mystery of God revealed he said if you missed the seals come back to this message will understood read later on but come back to this message Christ is the mystery of God reveal sending his foot upon the land upon the sea with the rainbow over his head and now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming right you know what our problem was and I know it spelled different but I just I was standing somewhere the other day and there was a pregnant lady and I don't know if she was talking about a breech birth or the her baby was breached or the thought came to my mind now I know the breech that he preached it's not the same spelling but think about it there was a baby hear me out a minute there was a baby that was turned in the wrong direction through seven Church ages there was a baby that could not be born the right way so he had to preach the breech for the redemption to come to turn that baby around and through seven seals that baby was born let's stand her feet god bless your heart I know it's not spelled the same but it means the same to me he had to preach the breech there had to be something brought us from where we were because not that our birth was wrong because you can have a breech birth but you birthed in the wrong direction but when you're turned that was all of us brother Donny but when you're turned literally turn it takes you right back total Redemption all right let's sing something I hope that was okay we'll bring out some more quotes and bring some more things next Sunday afternoon but remember this is what we're looking for we know what the seals are we know what the seals are we're looking for the thunder the thunder that's inside there's never been known by man you said well brother the plan of redemption is so simple thank you John had no problem beginning to write down what he saw John was redeemed John didn't say now Lord I don't know what that means I don't even know what I don't write it so there's a group of people even the first church age second third all the way up did not understand total Redemption Paul spoke of it he said I see through a glass darkly I look at these things he said but I see Jesus comes remember we'll talk about when we get in the seals remember Christ is the seventh seal we know that we know that that's that's perfectly honest he preached six seals there were six there was a six full purpose there were six seals brother Branham says and I got the quote brother mom said six seals finishes Redemption it finishes the redemption man six he'll finish his Redemption and Christ is the seventh seal but now remember what seal was broke by Christ he preached six right he preached six heals he told him what it was they asked him three questions he answered all three right but the mystery was that that man that was dead walked out of a tomb and broke the seal that was put on there was a Roman seal put over that door and that seal that was put over that door said no man can get in and no man can get out but guess what he didn't need to roll that stone away we know that he rolled it away as a symbol because he broke that seal angel didn't break it I believe Christ Himself broke that seal and he stepped right out and guess what when his precious feet hit the earth it was a glorified body there's your seventh theme it's a glorified condition all right let's sing a song god bless you 194 194 say one or two verses and then we'll go nations breaking and Israel's awaking the Gentile today's number when hores encumber eternity soon will unfold the day of redemption is here means hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirits your lamp trimmed and clean look at your redemption is me the fig tree is growing jerusalem's restoring her national life long dethrone today she is calling her latter days fallen we turn our disperse to your honor the day of redemption is here means hearts are failing for food [Music] if you just bless you [Music] [Music] good churches a power [Music] the redemption is to be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and clean look your redemption is here heavens powers are shaking and many are mistaking God's meaning to be of the skies God Church is the power that shaking this hour the day of redemption is night [Music] from this day forward her beautiful [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] spirit your lambs trim name your redemption is everybody good y'all listen I'm telling you it's a glorious time but it's a rough time it's not gonna be easy we didn't bring we didn't bring forks and spoons to this picnic no swords to the battle exactly what we got to do but I'm greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world right hey ma'am so let's let's just pray and be dismissed and just remember all of us in prayer remember now November the 4th not October the 4th November the 4th on Saturday night at 7 o'clock I'll be at brother Tim him preaching a special service up there for most Saturday night so if anybody wants to go I know some of you
